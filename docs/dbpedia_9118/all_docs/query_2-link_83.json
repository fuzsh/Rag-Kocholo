        "text": "Back to Civilization VI\n\nGo to the City article\n\nGold is one of the main statistics in Civilization VI. It is used as the main standardized currency not only of your empire, but also in the entire game world. It is needed for maintaining infrastructure and armies, for trading with other civilizations, and more.\n\nMechanics[]\n\nGold is gathered and spent empire-wide, like Science and Culture. But unlike them, unspent Gold can be accumulated in the player's treasury once automatic expenses are deducted from income. The amount of Gold in the treasury is always visible in the upper left corner of the UI.\n\nRight next to the treasury you can see your Gold flow — the current difference between expenses and income in your empire — which is added to or subtracted from the treasury at the beginning of each turn. Unlike other stats, you can have positive or negative Gold flow, and the latter can severely hamper your development. Note that your Gold flow may sometimes change between turns (for example, due to the beginning of a diplomatic deal, or a switch in policies), so the number you see at the end of each turn may not always match the actual change in your treasury.\n\nUses[]\n\nThe uses of Gold are many and diverse. Although Gold is not essential for the basic development of your civilization or its cities (this is reserved for other stats, such as Culture and Science), it is still absolutely necessary. Since it is the standard currency in the game, it is used to pay for all regular expenses of your empire. The amount of Gold necessary to cover your maintenance costs and any other expenditures is automatically deducted from your treasury at the beginning of each turn. The Gold that is left can be spent on special activities, such as trading with other leaders or making purchases.\n\nMaintenance[]\n\nGold is required to pay the upkeep, or maintenance cost, of almost every unit and building in the game, as well as all specialty Districts (except for the Commercial Hub and the Harbor, which pay for their own upkeep with the Gold they produce). While unit maintenance costs are initially small (around 1-3 Gold), they usually scale with the game era and can become quite large late in the game. A Spearman from the Ancient Era, for example, has a maintenance cost of 1 Gold, whereas a Giant Death Robot from the Information Era has a maintenance cost of 15 Gold. Building and district maintenance costs are fixed. Note that the very first units in the game, the Warrior, the Slinger, and the Scout (as well as the War-Cart when playing as Sumeria) are so simply outfitted that they need no maintenance.\n\nThere is no way to avoid paying maintenance costs, but one may attempt to diminish them with the following policies:\n\nConscription reduces unit maintenance costs by 1 Gold per unit.\n\nLevee en Masse reduces unit maintenance costs by 2 Gold per unit.\n\nIn Civilization VI: Rise and Fall, Second Strike Capability reduces the maintenance costs of all Nuclear Devices and Thermonuclear Devices by 50%.\n\nIn-city spending[]\n\nGold may be used as a currency for making purchases in a city as follows:\n\nPurchasing most units and buildings within a city, if you already fulfill all their requirements (technology, districts, other buildings, etc.). They will appear instantly, and the buildings' effects will kick in immediately. Units, however, will appear with no Movement, so you will not be able to use them until next turn. Note that you are not able to purchase units if there are other units of the same class already present in the same city (or district). Additionally, the price of most civilian units scales every time you purchase them - the more you buy a certain unit, the more expensive it will become.\n\nExpanding the territory the city (and thus your empire) controls. You may instantly purchase tiles that are immediately adjacent to tiles you already own, up to 3 hexes away from the City Center. Note that the price grows the farther the tile is, and will also scale with technological and civic development.\n\nPurchasing districts in a city. This is possible only if Reyna has her Contractor title and is established in the city as a Governor. The cost scales parallel to the Production cost increase of the district being purchased, and the availability of districts that can be purchased depends on all the normal constraints ( Population limit, terrain availability, etc.).\n\n1 Gold is equivalent to 0.25 Production or 0.5 Faith.\n\nThere are ways to reduce the above costs, both with policies and by certain governments.\n\nDiplomatic deals[]\n\nGold is often used as a part of deals with the leaders of other civilizations. You may trade both bulk amounts of Gold (which are deducted only at the time of the deal) or gold-per-turn (GPT) with another civilization, which will effectively alter your Gold flow for the duration of the deal.\n\nOther uses[]\n\nGold may be used to attract Great People via patronage. This is especially useful for empires that developed their Gold capabilities while neglecting other aspects of the game, and can't manage to produce enough GPPs to beat the competition.\n\nThe Suzerain of a city-state may spend Gold to take control of the city-state's military, which will will remain under their control for up to 30 turns.\n\nSources[]\n\nGold sources are numerous, but which ones you are able to use varies greatly in the different parts of the game.\n\nTerrain and resources[]\n\nThese will be your main sources of Gold at the beginning of the game. Gold from terrain is not as scarce as in Civilization V: Brave New World, yet not as abundant as Civilization V: Gods & Kings. Coast tiles and the Oasis feature both grant a base yield of +1 Gold for being worked.\n\nApart from this, bonus Gold yield is provided by numerous Luxury Resources, as well as some Bonus Resources:\n\nCocoa: +3 Gold\n\nCotton: +3 Gold\n\nDiamonds: +3 Gold\n\nFurs: +2 Gold\n\nGypsum: +1 Gold\n\nIvory: +1 Gold\n\nOlives ( ): +1 Gold\n\nSalt: +1 Gold\n\nSilver: +3 Gold\n\nTruffles: +3 Gold\n\nWhales: +1 Gold\n\nWine: +1 Gold\n\nCopper: +2 Gold\n\nCrabs: +2 Gold\n\nMaize: +2 Gold\n\nTile improvements[]\n\nA few tile improvements grant bonus Gold yields. The most important of these are the Camp (+1 Gold; +1 Gold with Synthetic Materials) and the Plantation (+2 Gold; +1 Gold with Globalization). Both of these provide their initial bonus Gold from the very start of the game, which makes them important sources for a nascent empire.\n\nThe following improvements also yield Gold after sufficient technological development:\n\nFishing Boats: +1 Gold with Cartography\n\nQuarry: +1 Gold with Banking (Vanilla and Rise and Fall only)\n\nLate in the game, the Seaside Resort can become a major Gold source. Each one nets Gold equal to its Appeal rating, and since Seaside Resorts may only be constructed on tiles with an Appeal of 4 or greater, they are capable of outproducing any other single tile in your territory (excluding some improved Luxury Resources).\n\nTrading and Trade Routes[]\n\nOne of the major ways to obtain Gold is via Trade Routes, which become available soon after the start of the game after discovering Foreign Trade. Trade Routes to international destinations (both other civilizations and city-states) will garner large amounts of Gold income, especially later in the game when you've established Trading Posts and extended the range of your routes. Note that making routes to city-states of which you're the Suzerain won't net additional income. Domestic Trade Routes may also provide Gold with certain policies.\n\nYou can also get substantial income from making trading deals with other civilizations. There are many things you may trade to the other leaders, getting either GPT or single large payments of Gold in return.\n\nThe problem is that bad diplomatic relations severely hamper trading deals, up to the point of making them impossible. A civilization striving for a Domination Victory, for example, will find it significantly more difficult to strike deals due to the warmongering penalties it has incurred. Not only that, but it will have to be very careful where it sends its Traders - other civilizations which are at war with it will plunder the Trade Routes, severely limiting this income possibility.\n\nDistricts and buildings[]\n\nIn the middle game your main source of Gold will switch towards its dedicated district: the Commercial Hub. Its adjacency bonuses grant extra Gold and are fairly easy to activate (due to the prevalence of River and coastal settlements). Its buildings, the Market, the Bank, and the Stock Exchange, also provide massive boosts (+3, +5, and +7 Gold respectively), and its Specialists grant +4 Gold each.\n\nTrade city-states grant up to +8 Gold in every Commercial Hub in your empire (and in Gathering Storm, in every Harbor) based on the number of Envoys assigned to that particular city-state. The Capital gets an additional +4 Gold per city-state.\n\nAlthough the Commercial Hub is the main source of district Gold income, the Harbor creates substantial Gold income as well. Its Specialists grant +2 Gold each, it generates Gold adjacency bonuses, and its Lighthouse and Seaport grant +1 and +2 Gold respectively.\n\nThe Palace of a civilization's Capital, located in the City Center, also grants +5 Gold.\n\nWonders[]\n\nSeveral Wonders grant bonus Gold upon completion, including:\n\nBig Ben: +6 Gold; doubles the current amount of Gold in the owner's treasury upon completion\n\nCasa de Contratación ( ): +15% Gold to every city that is not on the owner's original continent\n\nColossus: +3 Gold\n\nGreat Lighthouse: +3 Gold\n\nGreat Zimbabwe: +5 Gold; +2 additional Gold on every Trade Route originating from this city for every bonus resource in this city's territory\n\nMachu Picchu ( ): +4 Gold\n\nPetra: +2 bonus Gold yield on all Desert tiles in this city\n\nGold can also be obtained from natural wonders:\n\nCliffs of Dover: +2 Gold\n\nDelicate Arch ( ): +1 Gold yield to adjacent tiles\n\nLake Retba ( ): +2 Gold\n\nPiopiotahi: +1 Gold yield to adjacent tiles\n\nSahara el Beyda ( ): +4 Gold\n\nYosemite: +1 Gold yield to adjacent tiles\n\nPolicy cards[]\n\nMany policy cards grant bonus Gold once their conditions are met.
