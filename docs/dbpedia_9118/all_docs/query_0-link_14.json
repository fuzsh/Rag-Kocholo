        "text": "Mali and Songhai built strong armies that could protect trade within their territories. Their armies consisted of full-time professional soldiers numbered in the tens of thousands—potentially between 50,000 and 100,000 at their strongest.\n\nMali’s founding king Sundiata used his Muslim faith to establish trading relationships with Muslim merchants from North Africa and Arabia. King Sundiata’s grandson Mansa Musa took an extravagant journey to the Islamic holy city of Mecca. He handed out so much gold along the way that Mali’s stories of prosperous West African kingdoms spread. These stories encouraged rulers to establish new trade and diplomatic relationships with the West African empires.\n\nIncreasing numbers of Muslims traveled to Mali and Songhai along the trans-Saharan network. While many of these were merchants, many were not. One group was students and scholars who went to study at Islamic universities and libraries in Timbuktu and Djenne. Others were long-distance travelers and explorers, such as Ibn Battuta (1304 to 1369), who visited Mali in 1351. Batutta, a Muslim, traveled across Afro-Eurasia from West Africa to China.\n\nAs Mali and Songhai expanded regional commerce, neighboring civilizations increased their roles in trans-Saharan exchange. The Hausa city-state kingdoms were one such group. Like the rulers of Mali and Songhai, the various Hausa kings had converted to Islam. By the 14th century, Kano had become the most powerful of the Hausa city-states. It achieved this by becoming the base for the trans-Saharan trade in salt, cloth, leather, and grain.\n\nUnfortunately, as trade prospered across the Saharan, slave traders forced increased numbers of people into slavery. Enslaved people found themselves in a variety of systems of servitude. Rulers in West Africa and Egypt used enslaved people in their militaries as highly trained soldiers. Wealthy families also used enslaved people as domestic servants or concubines. Others mined gold in West Africa or salt in North Africa. Estimates of the total number of enslaved Africans moved across the trans-Saharan trade routes to the Muslim world range from 11-17 million\n\nAs commerce on the trans-Saharan trade routes increased, new trading towns were established while many preexisting cities grew bigger. New cities served as stopover points for merchant caravans to rest and refuel. Other cities became small regional markets where merchants sold goods. Already flourishing trade cities like Timbuktu and Djenne became wealthier and opened Islamic universities, libraries, and mosques.\n\nTimbuktu: Merchants established Timbuktu in the 12th century. The city flourished through trade in gold, salt, ivory, and enslaved people in both the Mali and Songhai empires. Timbuktu also became a center of Islamic learning. Between the 10th and 15th centuries, Islamic Imams (preachers) and scholars established three mosques and schools in the city (Sankore Madrasah, Djinugereber, and Sidi Yahya). The town also became a center of Islamic learning. People across West Africa visited the city to study the Quran and Islamic teachings.\n\nDjenne: Merchants founded Djenne around 800 CE, and it quickly became a hub for merchant activity on the trans-Saharan trade network. Merchants would stop in Djenne on their way into or out of the larger trading city of Timbuktu. Like Timbuktu, Djenne became a center of Islam in West Africa. The Great Mosque of Djenne is one of the most recognizable Mosques in the world and was constructed between the 13th and 14th centuries."
