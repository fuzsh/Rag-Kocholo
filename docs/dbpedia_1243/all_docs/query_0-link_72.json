The first part of this article will establish that political speeches are written in a bilingual environment where the two offcial languages are often in contact. This bilingualism, however, is often homogenised when it comes to speech delivery and publication. Therefore, the second part focuses on the speeches’ paratextual features and the third looks at the speeches’ textual features.",
