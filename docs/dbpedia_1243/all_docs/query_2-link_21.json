In accordance with the Renolution of the last general meeting, the following Memorial was sent UieGorernor-Gcner.1 in Council, respecting the International Fisheries Exhibition, then opened at Sonlh Kensington :— To Hit ExetUauy the Governor-General in Council, Ac. The memorial of the Royal Society of Canada humbly showeth :-That the Society has heard i d««pe.t interest and pride of the success that ha, rewarded the effort* of the Government to PROCEEDINGS FOR 1884. V have Canada properly represented at the International Fisheries Exhibition, opened a few weeks ago at South Kensington. That the Society feels that the exhibit made by Canada will be a most efficient means of adver- tising the groat resources of the Dominion, and must very materially aid in attracting wealth and population into this country. That the Society, in giving expression to the gratification which its members naturally feel, in common with all Canadians, begs leave at the same time to submit to your Honourable Body the ad- visability of the Government taking measures to secure, for the intended National Museum, such specimens from the Fishery Exhibit as may be of permanent scientific value to the Dominion. Therefore your Memorialists trust that your Honourable Body will be pleased to give due consid- eration to this question, and come to a conclusion which will practically promote the cause of Science in Canada. Invitations have been addressed to Literary and Scientific Societies throughout tho Dominion, and the Secretary has received replies from the following bodies, with tho names of their respective dele- gates, all of whom we hope will be present at this meeting : — NAMES OF SOCIETIES AND DELEGATES. 1.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science, however, we are glad to inform you, has appointed as its delegate Dr. Persifor Frazer, of Philadelphia. The following reply has been received from tho Academie Royale des sciences, des lettrcs et des beaux-arts de Belgiqite, and from L'Athcnle louisianais, of New Orleans : — ACADEMIE ROYALE DES SCIENCES, DES LETTHES ET DES BEAUX-ARTS DE BELOIQUE, PALAIS DES ACADEMIES, BKUXELLES, le 9 avril 1884.

The American Association for the Advancement of Science has also forwarded the following cor- dial invitation to the Royal Society of Canada, which wo hope will receive a favourable response before the clone of this meeting : — PHILADELPHIA MEETING: AMIBICAJI ARHOTIATION FOB THE ADVANCEMENT or SCIENCE, SEPTEMBER, 1884. COMMITTEE ON INVITATIONS AND RECEPTIONS, ) April 16th, 1884. j To the Royal Society of Canada. The Local Committee, which has been organized to prepare for the forthcoming meeting of the American Aiimriation for the Advancement of Science on September 4th of this year, mindful of the Wljcordiml reception accorded to the Association at its last meeting in Montreal, is desirous that the NpMuuUtive scientific body of oar sister country should be present at what promises to be one of the PROCEEDINGS FOR 1884. VII most important international gatherings of scientific men which have ever been hold; and therefore cordially invites the members of the Royal Society of Canada to visit Philadelphia on September 4th next, to meet those of the American and British Associations, and of various European scientific societies. The Local Committee, speaking in behalf of citizens of Philadelphia, as well as of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, promises a most cordial welcome to the Royal Society of Canada on that occasion. JOHN WELSH, Chairman of Local Committee. C. W. YOUNG, President of American Association for the Advancement of Science. J. P. LESLEY, President Elect, American Association for the Advancement of Science. It is with much regret that we refer to the sudden death of one of the ablest and sincerest friends of the Royal Society, Dr. Alpheus Todd, for so many years the Librarian of Parliament. All of us know full well the ability and learning of that distinguished gentleman, who had an abiding confidence in the success of the Society, and was considering earnestly, up to the very hour of his death, how he could best assist it in its work of encouraging literary and scientific studies in Canada. Since we last met in this building a year ago, the Marquis of Lome, the distinguished founder of this Society, has left the Dominion, but we are glad to know that he continues to feel the deepest in- terest in its success. The Council would suggest that his name should always appear in the Transac- tions as the Founder of the Royal Society. A resolution on this subject will be submitted for your approval . We have every reason to believe that the successor of Lord Lome takes much interest in the work of the Society, and will not fail to give it that encouragement which a Governor-General can always give. An Address will be formally presented to His Excellency, the Marquis of Lansdownc, asking him to act as Honorary President of the Society, in succession to the Marquis of Lome. We are glad to be able to state that the Parliament of the Dominion has most generously con- tinued its grant of five thousand dollars for the present and following years toward the publication of the Transactions of the Society. We hope that the initiative taken by the Government will incite liberal-minded and wealthy men throughout Canada to make such generous donations as will enable the Society to promote the many objects to which it should devote itself. The British Association for the Advancement of Science has decided to hold its annual meeting in Montreal, in the week beginning August 27th, on which occasion a large number of the leaders in science from the United Kingdom will bo present. It seems fitting on this occasion that this Society should take a part in welcoming to our Dominion such a distinguished body, and it is therefore desira- ble that a Committee should be appointed for that purpose. LIST OF MEMBERS PRESENT. The Honorary Secretary then proceeded to call the roll of members, and the following responded to their names : — P. J. 0. Chauveau, Paul de Gazes, Pamphile LeMay, Faucher de St. Maurice, L. Frechette, Joseph Tasse\", F. G. Marchand, Benjamin Suite, 1'abbe* Casgrain, 1'abbd Tanguay, J. M.

The list of Delegates was then read, and the following Reports were duly presented from the fol- lowing Literary and Scientific Societies in Canada : — I. Prom the Nova Scotian Institute of Natural Science, through Mr. MAKTIN MURPHY, C.E. :— The Nova Scotia Institute of Natural Science was instituted on December 31st, 1862. It may be considered as a result of the effort to represent Nova Scotia at the great London International Ex- hibit i»n of 1862. The Nova Scotinn Commission secured the cooperation of a number of naturalists, •n<) other gentlemen who took an interest in Natural History. The Secretary of the Commission, R. G. Haliburton, Kwj., barristor-at-law, took active stops in convening these gentlemen, with a view to mutual improvement in the study of Natural Science, as well as for the development of the natural resources of the Province. It wa» agree*! \" that a society be formed under the name of the Nova Scotian Institute of Natural Science; That the Institute undertake the publication of lists of the various natural pro- duction* of t!u« Province, with such observations as their respective authors may deem necessary; That, MI fur a* the funds of the Institute will permit, the President's address, the list of native productions, and u election of tin- jiapers read at the meetings by members be published, as the ' Transactions of the Nova Srotian Institute of Natural Science,' and distributed gratuitously to the members.\" The Institute has eutilinued in active operation from 18t!2 to the present time. 'I he session of 18S:!-8-t, just finished, of Proceedings and Transactions, Part I, Volume VI, has IHM-II ju-t published. These volumes are considered us a highly creditable record of original work done in the various ln-audics of Natural Science. Their distribution has been world-wide. The popu- larity of tin- Institute aliro.ul is still increasing. The volumes of the Transactions are out of print, so thai it i' impossible to meet constantly recurring applications for thorn. The annual grant from the Provincial Legislature of from one hundred to two hundred dollars, in connection with the fees of members, has enabled the Institute to print and distribute its Transactions, but not to illustrate them with maps ami figures. The Institute, owes its success largely to the efforts of its secretary, the Rev. I) ll\"in viniiM. I>.C.L. As well as being the most active member, ho is ever zealous, ever working, in the advancement of its interests and in the cause of science.

From the Geographical Society of Quebec, through LIEDT.-COL. RHODES:— I have the honour to report that the Geographical Society of Quebec has done a considerable work during the past year, a portion of which appears in their Bulletin, which is now ore you. As Geographical enterprise moans commercial progress, it is not surprising that PROCEEDINGS FOR 1884. IX there is a growing demand for a better arid more general knowledge of our misknown territories, and this can only bo gained by voyages of discovery, undertaken by a settled government. To the climate of Canada wo must credit the source of all our health and wealth. Cold gives us vigour, the power of reproduction, our numerous populations and the probability of their indefinite increase, while again, it makes it possible to cover our lands with vegetation, and thus ensures fertility on the surface. Canadians need not be deterred by low temperatures, but rather believe scientific and civilized man may live in abundance, where nature has so lavishly prepared the way for an intelligent and educated race to work out its national existence. As the Geographical Society advocates and promotes, on all possible occasions, voyages of dis- coveiy, I am glad to report that : — A Survey by water will bo made this season of Hudson Bay and its Strait, by the Government of the Dominion. An Expedition will also start by land from the lower St. Lawrence to Lake Mistassini and James Bay, equipped for wintering on or about the height of land between the Province of Quebec and the Northeast territory. This party will be under the general ^instructions of Dr. Solwyn, the Director of the Geological Survey for the Department of the Interior. Manitoba, having obtained powers to construct a railway from Winnipeg to Hudson Bay, there will be exploration parties in that direction. The Pacific Railway is now in the Rocky Mountains, opening the way to a better knowledge of those sections ; which are also being further explored by parties from the Geological Survey, under the immediate superintendence of Dr. G. M. Dawson. The United States Government is promoting Voyages of Discovery in Alaska and up the Yukon River, which takes its source in the north-western corner of Canada. A report of (his survey has been sent to us, and appears in our Transactions. Though I am happy to acknowledge much encouragement within the year, from the general pub- lie, to Geographical science, yet I regret to state that both the Dominion and the Government of the Province of Quebec have withdrawn their money grants, leaving us to contend with financial difficul- ties, which may become very embarrassing. The proper view to take of young Societies, such as ours, is the educational. We do not require much more than official recognition, such as we are receiv- ing from the Royal Society of Canada ; but, as our work is essentially of a national character, Can- ada ought not to be the only country in the world without a Geographical Society, which will assur- edly be the case, if we fail through a want of funds. Economy is very well, but the saving of a few hundred dollars by the Dominion Government and by that of the Province of Quebec will not materially add to the public purse, whilst the adult portion of our population will bo the losers from a scientific body's being unable to publish and circulate gratuitously trustworthy information, inde- pendent of and unconnected with the Railway and Land Companies of the period. I beg to tender my respectful thanks to the Royal Society of Canada for a copy of their Proceed- ings and Transactions for 1882-83, as well as for the honor of taking a part in the assemblage of this year. These meetings have a special interest for the members of the Geographical Society of Quebec. W. RHODES, President. QUEBEC, May 16th, 1884. IH. From the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal, through Mr. R. W. McLxcHLAN : — In presenting to the Royal Society of Canada a report of original work done during the past year, the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society would congratulate the country on the organization of such an institution, and hopes that the promises for future literary work and scientific research may bo fully carried out. Pro. 1884. B. j ROYAL SOCIKTV OF CANADA. Th« Societv wu organized in 1862, with a membership of twenty, interested in the colled ion andl •tody of coins and medals, under the nnmo of the Numismatic Society of Montreal. In 18G3, iln Societv undertook the publication of a work describing the coins and medals relating to Canada. Owing to unavoidable delays, such as the death of one member of the committee and the removal of • another from the city, the book was not issued until 18C9. As, since that time many new coins and much information has come to light, a new book on the subject has been undertaken by one of the members of the Society. As it seemed to be the desire of the members to enlarge the scope of the Society, it« name was changed, in 1868, to that of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Montreal. This, while it still retained the Numismatic department as its most prominent feature, permitted the introduction of Arehieological Research in all ite branches. The Society in 1870 was incorporated by act of Provincial Parliament, and in 1872 was made the recipient of a small govern- ment grant, which was continued annually until last year. With the aid of this grant, the Society commenced, in 1^72. the publication of a quarterly entitled, the Canadian Antiquarian and Numis- matis Journal. Hut it is feared that, on account of the withdrawal of the annual grant, this publica- tion may have to lie suspended, or much reduced in size. In this quarterly have appeared the Transactions of ihe Society, original papers and communications, and other matters relating to Arclurology ami Numismatology, e-pecially of the Dominion. The. Membership of the Society, which has never been large, docs not now number over fifty, t'ould the Society succeed in increasing its membership, much more work would' ba; accomplished.

THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION. DR. PERSIFOR FRAZER, delegate from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, then presented his credentials and addressed the meeting, on the invitation of the President :— Mi-. President and Gentlemen of the Royal Society : — I am fully sensible of the double honour which I enjoy at this moment, — that of appearing for the representative scientific body of my country ; and that of being received by this distinguished body and invited to address it. It is not my purpose, however, to occupy any part of your valuable time with purely subjective feelings, for, to my understanding, the occasion of my presence has a vastly deeper significance than any that can be attached to the actor in it. The year 1884 is destined to be memorable in the annals of science. The scientific representatives of that mighty nation which we of the United States, equally with you of Canada, are proud to call the Mother Country, after many attempts, have decided to consecrate the metropolis of their imperial Dominion of the West as the seat of one of their annual gatherings. Your own influential national society has held out its hand to its democratic sister across the southern border, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, inviting her to your annual conference of to-day, and she cordially accepts your courteous invitation and speaks her XM IJOYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA. words of greeting through me, whom she charges moreover to emphasize the formal invitation sent by her to you, the hosta, and to the British Association for the Advancement of Science, your guest*, to attend the Philadelphia meeting in September. What can be more fitting than that scientific men, who know no creed but love of truth, and no boundaries but those which limit our finite effort* to attain it, should set the example to the world of those brotherly amenities ? What portion of the globe can be more fitting to lead in these courtesies than Canada, distinguished for her sturdy efforts in the van of peaceful progress ? And to what people could Canada more suitably offer this graceful invitation than to the United States, her neigh- bour and friend ? Canada and the United States are bound together by many and strong bonds. They have had the same wildernesses to reclaim ; the same problems of the new western life to solve. Our border* separate no hostile people; but Canada's glories are ours, and ours are hers. Indeed, some of the names which shed the greatest lustre on science, literature and art are those of Canadians. Is it not noticeable that the dictionary of the people of the United States, so fecund in expanding itself to meet the want.- occasioned by new conditions of things, has but one adjective to specify the na- tionality of our own illustrious men, one which will apply equally to those of Canada, — American. The American Association for the Advancement of Science has twice made its sojourn in Canada, and ha* twice adjourned under a deep dolit of gratitude for the hospitality of the Canadians. The first time was in lS.r>7, when it was welcomed by General Sir William Kyre, and the second in 1882, when your Miciety, having just sprung into being, armed cap-a-pie — the Minerva of the great northern IkiininiuM — welcomed us with open arms to your metropolis. In this connection, it is not uninter- esting t<> note that Montreal is one of the only four cities of the continent at which the American Association has held two of its thirty-three sessions. It earnestly invites you to give it the opportunity of returning your civilities at the next and greatest of it- meetings The formal invitation to this efl'cct has been already laid before you, and I am here to a»viirc you that it is in no conventional or perfunctory spirit that it has been given. The l»nds uf union which this year will lie established between the scientific men of Canada, Great Britain and the United States will owe no inconsiderable part of their durability to your acceptance and to the presence' of representatives of the lioyal Society in Philadelphia next September ; and these bonds are but the first warps in the net which will one day unite scientific men of all nations in an inter- national, or, rather, a national, organization, of which even now the whispered aspirations of some of the greatest of those who will constitute it lead us to form a vague picture. Indeed, whatever success in the unification <ii\" human interests diplomacy may achieve, it is certain that science will precede it by many years in this direction. May that time soon come.

Attention having been called to the fact that Dr. Hart Merriam, Secretary of the Ornithologists' Union of New York, was present, he was formally invited to take a part in the proceedings of the Society. He accepted the invitation with a few appropriate remarks. A draft of an Address to His Excellency the Governor-General was then submitted to the Society by the President, and formally adopted. The meeting then adjourned until 3 o'clock in the afternoon of that day. SESSION II. (Afternoon Sitting.') ADDRESS OF COUNCIL TO THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL. At 3 o'clock, all the members of the Society having assembled, the President presented the following Address : — To His Excellency the Most Honourable Henry Keith Petty Fitzmaurice, Marquis of Lansdowne, Governor- General of Canada : May it please Your Excellency : — We the President, Council and members of the Royal Society of Canada, beg leave to avail ourselves of this opportunity afforded by our first meeting since Your Excellency assumed the duties entrusted to you by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, as Governor- General of the Dominion, very respectfully to express to you the high gratification with which we welcome the accession to the vice-regal office of one already trained by active participation in public life, and by the experience derived from important administrative duties in the mother country, for the responsible functions which now devolve on you as the representative of our beloved Sovereign and the chief Magistrate of the Dominion of Canada. We beg leave with profound respect to tender to you and to Lady Lansdowne our cordial greet- ings, and the assurance of our earnest wishes that your abode in Canada may be no less agreeable to Your Excellency and to Lady Lansdowne than conducive to the best interests of the Dominion and of the Empire at large. The Royal Society of Canada owes its origin to the enlightened zeal of Your Excellency's prede- cessor, the most noble the Marquis of Lome, who with a view of the more effectually promoting the progress of letters and science in the Dominion, elicited the cooperation of representatives of the various departments embraced in its plan of organization, from the different provinces, to take the ini- tiative in an associated body, on which the Parliament of Canada conferred corporate powers, and Her Most Gracious Majesty was pleased to bestow its distinctive title. During the first two sessions of the Royal Society of Canada, it enjoyed the special aid and encouragement of His Excellency the Marquis of Lome, its founder, and owed not a little of its early success to his courteous and enlightened cooperation ; and we beg now very respectfully to pray that \\ I \\ ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA. the same countenance ind favour may be extended to us by Your Excellency, and that you will b e graciously pleased to accept the office of Honorary President of the Royal Society of Canada. P. J. O. CHAUVEAU, President. JOHN GEO. BOURINOT, Secretary. THE GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S REPLY. His Excellency replied as follows : — Mr. President, Dr. Storry Hunt, Ladies and Gentlemen : — My presence in this room is, I hope, MithVi.-nt evidence that I do not intend to offer an obstinate resistance to the invitation contained in the Addrww, with which you have been good enough to present me. In thanking you for it, I am afraid. I can <lo little more than acknowledge the compliment which you have paid me in asking me to a.Hsume an office which, though honorary, certainly confers some reflected distinction upon the holder I have always felt, that one of the privileges which renders the Governor-General's office most attrac- tive, in to IK- found in the opportunities which he enjoys of becoming acquainted with those persons in every sphere and profession of life within the Dominion, whose acquaintance is best worth making. If that proposition is true generally, it is one from which I am certainly not disposed to recede when I find the members of the Koyal Society ready, not only to welcome the Governor-General to the country, but also to give him un official status in connection with the distinguished body to which they belong. Hut, «ent lemon, I do not forget that I owe the honour which you propose to confer upon me to •ling besides a desire on your part to extend agreeably the circle of the Governor-General's His presence at your meetings is not without its significance. When you applied for litainc.1 permission to assume the title of \"Royal,\" when you determined that the Queen's repre- nUtive should be your Honorary President, you wore giving expression to a feeling that the work were engaged was one which deserved recognition, not only as-of national moment to the ninion, but as one having an ink-rest for the great Empire of which the Dominion forms a part If our conception of that Umpire that, while the mother country shall exert a moral influence t upon her different colonies, each of these as it advances in culture and development ual power, shall, in its turn, exert an influence which shall re-act upon her, sorely it is tcbod statement to say that the mother country has an interest in what you are doing to LC an.l literature in this great Canadian community. And, after all, of the many points veen the Old World and the New, none is closer than that at which the Literature and iwo merge imperceptibly into each other. This is true in regard to the past and not loss true in regard to the present. k back at the history of Canada, we see that the events which led to the colonization ami New France form a part of the history of Old England and Old France «, partly religious and partly political, which led to the earliest settlement on the banks Lawrence and on the Atlantic seaboard of America ; the fierce struggles of race which brought suffering and bloodshed to these shores, are uninte.ligtble unless wt, ,,,„. lh . l,Sht of contemporaneous cvenU in Europe. In the domain of Science, the PROCEEDINGS FOB 1884. XV clings. I cm, alas! lay no claim to a position amongst the distinguished confraternity whom I am addressing. My contributions to Literature have consisted for the most part in the preparation of sundry parliamentary volumes, the colour of whose binding has, I have no doubt, been reflected upon the faces of the unfortunate persons who have had occasion to read them. In regard to Science, I have never even performed the operation which Pope decribes as \" holding the eel of science by the tail.\" It is therefore clear that I cannot aspire even to the lowliest of footstools in this learned conclave. And perhaps it is as well that this should be so, for, to speak quite frankly, I should say that the less you had to do with official interference, however well intentioned, in your affairs, the better for you. The form of government in the world of letters, we all know, is republican, and that literary community will prosper most which depends least upon external guidance and official recognition. I say this with a full knowledge of the obligations under which this Society lies to my predecessor, Lord Lome, to whoso efforts it is probably due that the Society came into existence when it did, and who took so distinguished a part in its first organization. He did so, I think, because it was inevitable that some one should incur responsibility for the first step in the movement, which led to the formation of the Society, and because he was not the man to shirk that responsibility when it involved a good deal of invidious work and exposure to criticism. I think, however, I am right in saying that this step once taken, Lord Lome felt as fully as I do how necessary it is that your independence should bo absolute and complete. Well, sir, if this is true, perhaps I shall bo told that we should push our theories a little further. If it is the case that a Literary Society is likely to prosper in proportion as it is independent of official patronage and interference, may we not say that Literature itself will thrive best in an atmosphere of independence, and that any attempt to impose upon her such an organization as this will do her more harm than good. I can conceive such an argument being held. I can even conceive that a person using it should go on to say that the case of Literature is widely different from the case of the Fine Art,*, because, while the art student of the New World is excluded from the treasures and teachings of the Old, the literary student of the New World has, in these days of cheap books and public libraries, access to the best sources of information, and the noblest examples which the Old World can supply. Well, sir, all this is perfectly true. It is perfectly true that in the age in which we live, thanks to these facilities, thanks to the avenues opened by the public press, to the volumes of our periodical literature, and to the intel- lectual activity of our public life, the influence of such a Society as yours is absolutely incapable of keeping a man of good literary abilities in the background, or of forcing an indifferent performer to the front. To this extent it is perfectly true that freedom from official trammels, a fair field and no favour, should be the password of every friend of Literature. But, sir, is this contention inconsistent with the belief, that there is good and useful work to be done by a Society such as yours? Nothing could. I think, be further from the truth. Your Society has not been formed for the purpose of creating a liter- ary monopoly, or erecting a close literary corporation, or overriding the efforts of individuals or of societies. I have read with pleasure the statements which have, at different times, been laid before you of the objects which the Royal Society desires to achieve. I certainly do not gather from those statements that is your ambition to put the Literature and the Science of Canada into leading strings, or to deprive them of the natural vigour and spontaneity of their growth. What then are the objects of the Society ? May we not say, in the first place, that as man is naturally social and gregarious in his habits, it would be a little hard if the friends of Literature and Science were to be the only section of society without an organization of their own. I think, too, we might say that the need of such an organization, such a rallying point, such a common ground, upon which the representatives of the Literature and the Science of the Dominion may meet together is specially felt in a nation, where the population is as widely scattered, and the centres of intellec- tual activity are as far apart, as they are with us, and where eveiy effort to give cohesion to the dif- ferent portions of the nation deserves encouragement and support. Nor will the effects of its exist- ence be less valuable because it includes representatives of the Literature of both the great races, which dwell side by side in this country, and each of which brings to the common fund a contribution XVI KOYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA. having a distinctive character and importance of its own. That, gentlemen, is, I apprehend, one justification of the existence of the Society. The publication of the handsome volume of Transactions, of which you have boon good enough to present me with a very magnificent copy, affords another. Here, again, we may be asked why cannot you leave those literary productions to sink or swim according to their own deserts, instead of printing them as you do at the public expense ? The answer to thin question is, I think, that there must always be some work which, either because it anticipates |M>|iular taste, or because it is too recondite for the general reader, will be slow to obtain publicity through the ordinary channels. Such work will be conveniently and appropriately brought before the public l.v the |x>riodical issue of your Transactions. I confess for myself, I am not sorry that the solid meal is relieved here and there by a few pieces, which appeal to the reader rather by the classical grace of their construction, and which are capable of being more easily assimilated by an ordinary intelligence. There is one other duty which such a society as this is admirably qualified to perform. I mean that of, upon occasion, speaking and acting with authority on behalf of Canadian Literature ami Science. Its action in this rcspcet may take more than one direction. Tt may take that of cor- respondence with other Associations, either local Societies of which you have several excellent ones in Camilla, or (lie great and learned Societies of Europe and this continent, with many of which you have. I am glad to know, cntahlishcd relations. There is one such Society which is probably in all our thoughts at the present time. I mean that great English Association which later in the year will jiav u- a \\\\-ii to our great delight on Canadian territory. There is, however, another public body with which I can conceive that you may, upon occasion, confer with great advantage. That public |H«|\\- i- the liovenmicnt of the Dominion. I can conceive numerous cases in which it might be of the greatest assistance not only to Literature and Science, but to the Government itself that there fhoiild IK; in existence a Itody from which an authoritative expression of opinion in regard to public questions affecting national culture might, ujion occasion, be elicited. I will give you a single illustra- tion of my ineaniiig. (die case occurs to me in which such a body as yours might operate most use- fully in the manner in which I have suggested. I refer to the case of the Historical Records of this country. Anyone who has had to do with valuable manuscripts knows the difficulty of. on the one hand, rendering these available for the legitimate purposes of the historian, and on the other of restricting their use to proper pel-sons. In England, wo founded a few years ago a standing commis- sion which was entrusted with the task of investigating and reporting upon the groat mass of valu- able materials which are scattered about the country, and of which the existence and value arc often unsusjK-cted by their owners. 1 do not see why your Society should not, to some extent, take the place of (,ur Historical Manuscript Commissions in regard to the historical records which may exist here. The»e are all legitimate openings for your activity, and justifications of your corporate exist- ence. In each of these directions you should be able, without claiming a monopoly, without discour- agement of private efforts, to do good national work in the broadest sense of the word,— work which because it will be the property of the whole Dominion will help to bind its parts more firmly to- gether and to raise your country, not only in the estimation of its own people, but in that of the whole civilized world. I have now only to thank you for the honour yon have conferred upon me, and for the kindly trmu in which you have welcomed me to the Dominion, and last but not least, for the courteous .vhich your addre*. contains to Lady Lansdowne, who, if she had known that the fair sex to bo so largely represented in this room, would, I am sure, have come hero with me. PROCEEDINGS FOE 1884. XVII ADDRESSES BY THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRESIDENT. His Excellency was followed by the President, the HON. P. J. O. CHAUVEAU, who spoke as follows: Milord, Mesdames et Messieurs, — Dans notre derniere rdunion, nous avons du faire nos adieux aufondateur de cette Socidtd, qui nous avait informd de son prochain ddpart. Nous avons tachd d'ex- primor notre reconnaissance au marquis de Lome pour tout ce qu'il a fait pour dtablir cette insti- tution et on assurer la prospdritd. Son Excellence a bien voulu faire A 1'adresse que nous lui avons jiivsontdo la plus graciouse rdponse. Depuis ce temps, Son Excellence et son illustre compagne, la princesse Louise, qui elle aussi avait donnd i cette Socidtd des marques du plus vif intdrSt, ont quittd le Canada, regrettds de toute la popu- lation, et laissant ici de vifs et profonds sentiments d'estime et de reconnaissance. Lour residence au milieu de nous a dtd surtout remarquablo par le patronage dclaire qu'ils ont donnd en toute occasion aux sciences, aux lettres et aux arts. Lafondation do cette Socidtd et celle <lo 1'Acaddmie des beaux-arts en sont des preuves bien dvidentes, et qui, espdrons-Ie, subsisteront longtemps. Enacceptant aujourd'hui le titre de president honoraire de notre Socidtd, et en faisant i I'adresse que nous venons de lui presenter la bienveillante rdponse quo nous venons d'entondre, Son Kxcellenco lord Lansdowno a fait preuve de ses dispositions & favoriser les travaux et les rocherchos littdrairos et scientifiques, ct il nous a fourni de nouveaux motifs d'encouragement dans 1'accomplissement do la tfiche que nous avons entreprise. Cetto tftchc, Messieurs, est agrdable en ce qu'elle a rapport i\\ des objets qui nous sont chors, et sur- tout en co qu'il ost permis achacun do nous d'y suivre son inclination naturollc ct do choisir le genre de travail pour lequol il se connait le plusd'aptitude; mais, d'un autro cotd, bien des oirconstancesparti- culicTes a notre pays, ajoutdos aux obstacles que 1'on rencontre partout ailleurs, rondont not re mission bien difficile. Je ne ferai pas il mos collegnes 1'injure dc croire qu'ils pourraient considdrer lo litre dc memliro de la Socidtd Royale comme purement honorifiquc, comme uno recompense pour dos travaux passes, enfin cornme uno retraite honorable ; mais les devoirs quo ce titro impose sont pour quclquos-uns d'entre nous d'un accomplissement assez ondreux. L'dloignement, les voyages, des occupations diverses, et, pour le plus grand nombre, 1'absenco prcsque complete de loisirs, sont autant de causes qui retarderont peut-Otre longtemps encore los progres de notre jeune Socidtd. Nos deux premieres sessions annuelles ont cependant donnd de bons rdsultats, et fourni une ample moisson de travaux utiles. La publication de cos travaux, ainsi que des comptos rondus de nos ddlibd- rations, n'a pu se fairo que tout rdcemmont. Le tout forme un volume de pnss de sept cents pages, ornd de gravures et de planches. Une grande partie des seize cents oxemplaires qui ont dtd imprimds so distribue en ce moment aux socidtds scientifiques et littdraires et aux bibliotWques publiques, dans le pays et & 1'dtranger. Les essais qui ont dtd lus et discutds dans les sections n'ont pas tous dte imprimds. Le choix de ceux qui devront §tre publids a dtd laissd, d'apres nos reglements, au conseil de chaque section. En gdndral 1'originalitd et 1'utilitd de ces mdmoires ont dtd les motifs ddterminants du choix. Tout on regrettant que plusieurs travaux qui font honneur i leurs autem-s ne se trouvent point dans notre volume, les membres charges de la tdche bien ddlicate d'apprdcier ainsi les oeuvres de leurs coll&- gues ont du cd.ier 4 la ndcessitd de ne pas ddpasser certaines limites quant aux frais d'impression. D'autres mdmoires n'ont pas dtd publids, uniquement parcequ'ils n'ont pas dtd envoyds a temps au comitd chargd de sui-veiller la publication du volume. II ne m'appartient de faire ni 1'dloge ni la critique de ces travaux. Je me bornorai a dire que les essais qui ont dtd lus devant les deux premieres sections, traitant comme ils le font de sujets qui se rapportcnt a 1'histoirc primitive, ;i la ddcouvcrte et ;i la colonisation de ce pays, ct aux ddbuts do Pro. 1884. c. XVIH ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA. noire jeune literature, foment une belle et remarquable introduction aux truvaux qui dovront suivro. II mesuffira aussi d'ajouler quo los imSmoires des'deux sections scientifiques, ceux em-tout qui ont trmlt t U geologic et A 1'histolrc naturclle, sont d'une grande utilitd publique, et forment de> une collec- tion digne d'«tre apprdciee par tous ceux qui s'interessent an deVeloppement materiel do notre continent. Mais il Herait niohoux que 1'on s'imaginat que la Socidt^ n'a pas d'autre objet, d'autre but que la lecture et la publication do ces mdmoires. D'abord chacun d'eux est, au sein de la section, le sujet de discussions tonjours inti-ressantes et souvent tres importantos.

Le oout plus grand d'Alificestout & fait incombustibles serait amplement coinpensd par le profit qui en r&ulterait de toutes maniorex. A ce point de vue n'est-il point tout a fait regrettable que la belle hil.lioth.'-quo du parlement 4 Ottawa ne soit pas anssi complement a 1'abri du feu qu'on 1'avait CSJH'K' d'abord, et que rien ne parai-.se devoir 6tre fait pour conserver la nouvelle bibliotheque qne Ton com- menco i former dans la province de Quebec ? La plus ancienne mai-on d'e\\Iuca(ion du pays a donn<? rdcemment un bon exemplo en faisant do *on nonvMU grand a^minairr <lc thi'..lo^io un odifico '.-ompli-tement incombustible ; et 1'on doit s'estimer fai es PROCEEDINGS FOR 1884. XIX hottreux qu'uno partio au moins do la bibliothiquo do 1'universite Laval, la plus pr<Jcieuse peut4tre qu'il y ait dans le pays, ait pu y trouver place. Quant aux manuscrits et aux anciennes archives, il reste encore boaucoup a faire pour les classer, les mettre 4 1'abri do 1'humidite d'un cote, a 1'abri du feu de 1'autre. C'est un sujot dont notre Soci«St«S s'est dej4 occupe'c, et il suffit d'en reTerer aux travaux de M. LeMoine et a la proposition du Dr Todd. La perte dans ce cas-14 est encore plus irreparable que celle des livres mC-me los plus precieux. La question dcs droits d'auteurwaoceupd les legislatures des pays etrangers 4 plusieurs reprises, et la notro a fait plusiours dispositions 4 ce sujet. On a tenu une conference internutionale en p]urope pour la discuter ; mais tous les efforts qui ont 616 fails jusqu'ici pour concilier les justes droits dos auteurs avec les preventions que Ton fait valoir au nom de la societe n'ont pas encore, il me semble, rendu pleine justice aux families de ceux qui suivent une carriure generalement ingrate. Dans ce pays ou les difficult^ qui entourent le savant et le litterateur sont plus grandes qu'ailleurs, ses droits et ceux de sa famillo dans le fruit de ses labours sont encore moins reconnus et moins protege's que dans plusieurs autres contrees. Jo ne me dissimule point tout co que Ton pout opposer au mot charmant d'un spiritual homme do lettres fran9ais : \"Jo demande, disait-il, que Ton decrete que la propriete litteraire est une proprittt.\" mais, d'un autre cold, si Ton ne pout souffrir quo los droits de la societe soient enticement meconnus, il semble quo dans un pays comme celui-ci, la propriete litteraire devrait durer dans tous les cas toute la vie de 1'auteur, ot pendant un certain nornbre d'aniu'es apres sa mort au profit de ses hc'riticrs ou do ceux ;V qui il aurait pu la vendro. Tandis que des homines qui ont araassd des fortunes dans des entreprises lucralives et quelquefois peu honorables peuvent les transmettre intactesk leurs enfunts, est-il juste que ceux qui ont travaillu pendant toute leur vie pour la plus grando gloire de leur pays ne puissent laisser comme un modeste patrimoine 4 leur famille la propriete de leurs ouuvres ? Et suffit-il de dire que la bonne renomme'e, que la gloire litteraire d'un pore ou d'un ai'eul sont une protection et uno aureole pour leur posterite? Protection qui ne protege pas toujours contre la faim, aureole qui brille tristement dans le vide quo fait la misere ! Pour ce qui est d'un projet qui nous a dej;\\ occupes, celui de fonder des bourses et des concours, il t regrettable que nous n'ayons pour le rdaliscr aucune ressourco pecuniaire. La somme que le parlement federal a genereusement votee pour notre Societe, vote qui a ete rdite're' dans la session qui vient de finir, doit §tre, d'apres les termcs dont on s'est servi, employee uniquement 4 la publication de nos Memoires. Espdrons que plus tard le gouvernement consentira ;\\ voter une somme additionnelle pour les autres fins de notre institution, ouque des particuliers riches dotcront la Societe Royale, commo 1'ont ete d'autres societes du meme genre en Europe et en Amerique, et qu'enfin le Canada aura ses Montyon et ses Bridgewater, comme il a cu ses Laval, ses McGill, ees Masson et ses Girouard. Nous avons adress6, comme nous 1'avions fait 1'tuine'o derniero, dos invitations 4 plusieurs societes eavantes de 1'etranger, et 4 dcs associations litteraires et scientifiques do notre pays, dont le meritc nous 6ta.it connue et que nous nous sommes affiliees. Le rapport du Conseil constate qne plusieurs des societes eirangeres se sont excusees en tei-mes bien sympathiquos ; 1'Association francaise vient de nous transmettre un teiegramme bienveillant, et si I'lnstitut de France ne nous a pas fait encore de reponse officielle, je puis comprendre par une lettro tres gracieuso de M. Marmier que les mSmes dispositions existaient chez les membres de 1'Academie et chez les ministres que 1'annee derniere, mais qu'il n'a pas pu encore cette fois, malgre son grand ddsii- de revoir le Canada, se charger de la mission qu'on lui offrait aupres do nous. II est malheureux qu'avec tous les liens qui existent cntre ce pays et son ancienne m6re patrie, des obstacles incontr61a- bles s'opposent 4 la representation de I'lnstitut de France dans une de nos reunions. Je ne doute pas que tous les membres de la Societe ne forment des voeux pour qu'il en soit autrement 1'annee prochaine. N x ROYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA.

J'ai eu I'honncur de lire anx applandisgemenU d'un anditoire qudbecquois les premieres po&ics qui flgnrent m t.'-t.- .|e c,. volume, et qni ont pour titre: 1'une Canada, 1'antre Qutbec. C'i'tait «V la PROCEEDINGS FOR 1884. XXI trance publique quo la premiere section do cetto socie'te' a tenuo re-comment dans la Hallo dos pro- motions do I'universite' Laval. Le nom do 1'illustro fondatcur do cotte grande institution so trouve ansssi dans ces vers : Where flows the Charles past wharf and dock, And learning from Laval looks down, And quiet convents grace the town. La premiere section a ainsi inaugure', sous la pre'sidence do M. Marchand, un mouvemcnt qui, jo 1'espere, so continuera. Le succes qu'a eu cette reunion i Qudbec engagei a sans douto los autres sections a so re'unir de temps a autres aux endroits los plus commodes. Elles <5taient du resto tres bien represent e\"es it Quebec, la seconde par M. Stewart, la troisieme par notre digne vice-prdsidont, M. Hunt, et par M. 1'abbe\" Hamel, la quatrieme par M. 1'abbe\" Laflammc et par M. Saint-Cyr. Quelques-uns dcs essais et dos poesies qui ont dtd lus dans cctte circonstance seront sans doule transmis pour Ctre publids dans le prochain volume do nos Mdmoires, ce qui me dispense d'en dire plus long sur cet heureux dvdnement. Jo no saurais toutefois trop insister sur tout ce qui pent donner de la permanence, de la continuity a nos operations. Le grand danger — et quellc est Institution si prospere qu'cllo soit qui n'a pas dprouvd des dangers a ses debuts — le grand danger pour notre Societe, e'est le manque de cohesion. Nous nous voyons encore trop rarement et pour trop peu de temps. Deux on trois jours de seances pour le parlement confdddrd des lettres, de 1'histoire et de toutcs les sciences ; c'est bien peu dc chose. Alors quo chaque section — j'allais dire chaque parlement local — siege i son tour aussi souvent qu'elle le pourra ; que chacune se constitue une petite capitalo, ou bien, si on le prdfere, que chacunc uille de ville en ville fairo connaitre notre reuvre. De cette maniere, 1'autonomie des sections so maintiendra ; cllos aUront une vie proprc ; elles rayonneront chacune dans sa sphere; elles attireront 5. elles, chacune d'apres sa nature et ses qualites propros, tout ce qui lui sera sympathique; et cela sans nuire en aucuno maniere aux travaux d'ensem- ble, sans porter ombrage aux grandes assises qui se tiendront ici plus rarement. Dans ces sessions particuliei es, bien des choses que nous n'avons point le temps de faire ou de discuter dans nos reunions gdndrales, pourront etre faites ou discutifes. En attendant, par exemple, que nous dtablissions des concours, chaque section pourra examiner les ouvrages que leurs auteurs vou- dront bien lui adresser, et faire connaitre dans des rapports transmis a la Sod(?te le mdrite de chacun d'eux. Deja, a Quebec, des essais d'un jcune e'crivain canadien ont dt(5 lus et renvoyds a une commis- sion, qui a ddcidd d'en faire une mention honorable. 11 importe surtout do faire connaitre i la jeunesse canadienno que notre Societe\" ne lui ferme point ses portes, qu' olios lui sont au contraire ouvertes en tout temps et a tons dgards. II sufHt qu'un mem- bre de la Socidtd se charge dc la lecture d'un e.ssai pour qu'il soit admis dans nos Mdmoires s'il on est juge\" digne, sur le memo pied quo coux des membres de la Socidtd. Ceci a dej&dtd fait dans les sections des sciences, et dcs homines distingues ont bien voulu nous envoyer leurs travaux. Les sections scicntifiques no rcnferment qu'un petit nombre de mombres de langue fran^aise. Us se sont deja montrds disposes a faire connaitre les recherches des travaillcurs qui prdftrcnt <5crire dans cette langue. Ce n'est pas ici le lieu d'insister sur I'importanco qu'il y a pour cette partio dc la popu- lation A, s'affirmer dans los sciences comme elle 1'a fait dans les lettres ; mais il est bon d'attirer 1'attention dc la jcunesse fi-anco-canadicnnc sur les avantages qui lui sont efforts, pour so frayer un chemin dans cette direction rclativemont nouvelle. II me resterait bcaucoup :i dire sur la tilche qui nous est de\"volue, mais j'ai pout-etrc deja trop long- temps abusd de votre indulgence. Cette tache est importante non seulement au point de vue intellec- tuel, mais encore au point de vue moral et religieux. L'Acad&nie francaise, en choisissant pour sujet du prochain concours de poe\"sie : Sursum corda, ROYAL SOCIETY OF CAttADA. a indiqu* d'un seul trait les dangers quo court la Socidte par 1'abaissemont des caracteros, par la soif de 1'or et de toutea les jouissances qu'il procure. Les travaux intellectuels sent un des meilleurs ddrivatifs centre ces tendances, et c'est pour cela qne la religion lee favorise ot quo plusicurs de ses ministres n'ont point detfaigne\" de faire partie de notre Soeie'te'. Je no saurais terminor sans dire combien nous devons de reconnaissance a Sa Majeste la reine pour It- litre qu'elle a bien voulu nous confe>er, au gouvornemcntct au parlement federal pour 1'octroi de notrc chartc et pour los subventions qui nous ont ete'donne's, a la prosse en gdndral ot aXix amis des sciences ot des lottrw qui ont favorisd notro cntreprise.

Tin- following spcfdi was then made l>y the Vice-President, Da. T. STERRY HUNT :— May it ].le:L-c Your Excellency, — The present occasion, which is the second anniversary of the founding of this Royal Society of Canada, will be memorable for us by your acceptance of the position of Honorary President, in place of its distinguished founder, tho Marquis of Lome. Your predecessor in the high charge of Governor of this Dominion, always alive to its best interests, sought to mark his administration by tho encouragement of whatever might conduce to intellectual advancement, and has made his name honoured among us by services rendered, alike to the Fine Arte, to Literature and to Science. Foremost among these good works the historian will, wo believe, record that of the concep- tion and the organisation of this Society, which ho hoped to constitute on such a basis that it might serve att a bond of union, and a means of friendly cooperation, among all those engaged in tho cultiva- tion alike of letters and of ncicnco throughout our Dominion. He saw tho need of an organization which should conduce to these ends, and conceived the grand idea of welding into one body tho various and complex element* at hand. Not content with establishing separate and independent Academies for tbo»« devoted to literature and to scientific studies, he recognized tho close relations which uniti> tlioc apparently distinct pursuit*, and moreover, felt the importance of the strength which is to bo found in concerted action. From these considerations he was led to conceive of an association which should be for this Dominion something not unlike tho Institute of France, a union of several Academies,— for such is the real constitution of our body, which, with the gracious permission of Her Majesty, calls itMlf the Royal Society of Canada. Considered from the point of view alike of belles lettres, and of our history in civilized times, PEOCEEDINGS FOB 1884. XXIII Canada presents exceptional conditions, demanding especial recognition in the very inception of the plan of the new Society, which includes representatives of two groat European races, with differences of language and of national traditions. This is not the place to recall the heroic story of French colonization in America, of the work of its pioneers in discovery and civilization from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico; nor of the conflict, transferred from the Old World to the New, which ended in the conquest of Canada by Great Britain, and made ite people, — while retaining their language, their institutions, and their laws, — the loyal subjects of the British crown. The scholar, however, notes as a result of all this, the existence in Canada of a people under the British flag, cherishing the sentiment of their French nationality, and proud of the great nation from which they sprang. Kemembering the glorious history of their ancestors on both continents, they have preserved their language as a sacred trust, and by works of history, criticism and poetry, have created in Canada a French literature of which they may justly boast. The existence of this element in the country required, as we have said, especial recognition, and hence in our Royal Society we find a Section which is devoted to this native French literature, and which may become another Ai-adfmie franraise. Side by side with this in our Society is found a corresponding English Section, the members of which, while not neglecting belles lettrcs, have before them a great field of usefulness in history and ethnology, in which there is ample scope for the work alike of French and Knglish students in connection with our aboriginal races. Here the two Sections can work together harmoniously, each in its own language, in antiquarian and prehistoric, researches. Such studies serve to bridge over the interval which in the popular apprehension separates literature from science. This latter, in its wider sense, includes not only mathematical, physical, and chemical studies, but the whole range of natural history and natural philosophy, embracing the three kingdoms of nature. To give to these scientific pursuits due place in the new Eoyal Society, and an equal weight with literature, two corresponding Sections were established, among which, irrespective of language and nationality, the members selected as representatives were divided: the third Section, including mathematics, physics, and chemistry; and the fourth, geography, geology, and general natural history. It is in the world of science that the importance of a national organization such as ours becomes more especially evident. The man of letters may hope to find, in a publisher and a reading public, encouragement and pecuniary recompense for his labour; but the student of science, though he may perchance gain fame, has little hope for such rewards. Yet the field of study before him is vast. In mathematics, in chemical and physical sciences are secrets untold which attract him ; while the natural history of our vast territory provides material which it will require generations of ardent workers to make fullj' known. The student of science asks only for generous criticism, and the means of publication. As regards the latter, scientific pursuits have always, in these latter times, enjoyed the protection and encouragement of enlightened states, and our own government, by its liberal grant for the printing of Transactions, showed in advance its appreciation of the objects and aims of the new Eoyal Society. The first volume, already before the world, will help to prove that we are not unworthy of the confidence reposed in us, alike by our noble founder and by the representatives of the people. Among its con- tributions to French and English letters, and to various departments of science, will be found not a few which will do honour to the country and contribute to the reputation of our young Society. It is, therefore, with satisfaction at the success already achieved, and with confidence in the future, that wo are again met together, after two years of existence, for counsel and discussion. \"While we regret the absence of our founder and first Honorary President, the Marquis of Lome, we are consoled by the consideration that your Excellency has been pleased to become his successor in the Presidency. The traditions of your illustrious family, not less than your own high attainments, assure us that our endeavours as members of this Society will not want your generous appreciation and your encourage- ment. Be assured that it will be our task to make the Eoyal Society of Canada worthy of its high ..IV ROYAL SMCIKTY OF CANADA. position *> a body representing both the letters and the science of the Dominion, and accept our renewed thanks for the honour which you have done us in accepting the position of our Honorary . His Excellency having retired, the meeting adjourned until the following day at 10 o'clock, A. M. SESSION III. (May 21sf.) The President took the chair at 10 o'clock A. M., and the Honorary Secretary read the list of Sucictie* who had not made reports on the previous day. RKPOHTS FROM AFFILIATED SOCIETIES. (Continued.) The following rc|x>rts were then submitted : — IX. From tin- Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club, through DR. BEAUMONT SMALL: — During tho your that ha* elapsed since my last report, the Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club has pur-.no! its >|»--'i:il work of developing the Natural History of this neighbourhood, with all its former vigour and activity, and its prospects have never bccmnoro promising than at the present time. It has added fortv new names to its roll, it has become an incorporated society in accordance with the Ontario statute-;, and marked success has attended its efforts in every branch of Natural History. In the Miinincr months much /.cal was displayed in pursuing tho field-work, and the efforts ef tho Council have been specially directed to rendering this work as systematic as possible. Under tho direction of the leaders, the various branches. — representing Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, Entomology, Conehology and Ornithology,— made numerous afternoon excursions, some of them being held fort- nightly throughout the season. These were well attended by the working-members, and those desirous of becoming acquainted with the study of the branch ; and in many instances they assumed the char- nctorol' classe* for the instruction of beginners. The regular excursions were held monthly, the attend- ance varying from twenty-live to sixty. The first excursion of the season has been arranged for Th 11 ixl ay next, that the Club may have the honour of entertaining the Fellows of this Society on an \"outing\" umong the ever attractive Lnurentians, and to allow those who are interested in Natural History an opportunity of studying this neighbourhood. Our soirees or winter meetings were seven in number, at which Reports of the work done in the sections during the summer were presented, and papers read on subjects of local interest. The following i» the programme : — Dec. 6, 1883.— Inaugural Address, by H. B. Small, M.D. 20, 1883. — Notes on the \" Flora Ottawaensis,\" with special reference to the introduced plant-, by J. Fletcher. Heport of the Ornithological Section. Jan. 7, 1884.— The Sand-plains and Changes of Water-level of the Upper Ottawa, by E. Odium, M.A. Report of tho Geological Section.

Report of the General Zoology Section. Classes of instruction were continued throughout the winter months, that in Botany being espec- ially successful under the direction of Mr. Fletcher. The attendance averaged, and the examination held at the close showed that the course had been earnestly followed. No. 4 of our Transactions has been issued containing eighty-four pages and a plate. It embraces the work of the winter of 1882 (a copy of which is presented herewith). Our Library is now assuming considerable proportions, being entirely formed of publications received in exchange for our Transactions. As they are all devoted to Natural History and kindred subjects, and represent the work of Naturalists throughout the country, they form a most valuable collection of original papers, such as are not to be found in the ordinary scientific works. The Officers for this year, elected at the Annual Meeting in March, are: — Patron His Excellency the Governor-General. President II. Beaumont Small, M.D. Vice-President 1st, James Fletcher ; 2nd, R. B. Whyte. Secretary W. H. Harrington. Treasurer W. P. Anderson. Librarian ....W. L. Scott. Committee Professor J. Macoun, H. M. Ami, F. R. Latchford. As an evidence of the work we have accomplished, the lists, published in our Transactions, are worthy of notice. In the field of botany, 920 plants have been collected; of shells, we have found 208 species ; of birds, 198 ; of fishes, 48 ; and of insects 1,004. This last collection, presented by Mr. Harrington during the past winter, is one of special merit. It is arranged and named after the revised check-list of Drs. LeConte and Horn, and is probably the first so adopted in this country. As all the collections have been made within a few miles of this city, I think we can reasonably claim to have one of the most thoroughly worked districts of Canada. This local study of Natural History is one we would earnestly ask the Royal Society to encourage. Were local societies, instead of wandering aimlessly among the paths of natural science, to devote themselves to this work, and report to the meetings of your Society, there would soon be accumulated a fund of information more perfect and complete than by any other method. BEAUMONT SMALL, President, O.F.-N.C. May 28th, 1884. X. From the Natural History Society of New Brunswick, through Mr. G. F. MATTHEW :— I regret, on this occasion, the absence of our delegate, Mr. Montague Chamberlain, who has been prevented by unavoidable circumstances from attending this meeting. Mr. Chamberlain is one of the most active members of our Society, and could have presented to you the work done by it during the past year in a fitting manner. Details of the operations of the Society during the past year will be found in bulletin No. 3, a copy of which has been sent to you. The active work of the Society during the past year has been Pro. 1884. D. x xv-j HOYAL SOCIETY OF CANADA. chiefly in the department* of Physics, Archaeology, Botany and Zoology, and especially in the study of birds and mammals. Dr. Boteford, our President, has pursued some investigations on the conver- sion of light into heat; other members have explored a village of the stone age at Bocaboc. in Charlotte County, New Brunswick; and a number of botanists in different parts of the Province i.f New Brunswick have made observations on the flora, which have resulted in adding sixty species of flowering plants ty those previously known as inhabitants of New Brunswick. The value of the work of these local botanist* may be learned from the fact that the Dominion botanist ha,s been satisfied to trust to their zealous investigations, and has given his time to the exploration of the adjoining provinces, where the study of botany is not so actively pursued. Mr. Chamlierlain, our delegate, who was to have presented these and other facts to you, has him- self been engaged in the preparation of the list of mummals contained in the bulletin and in pursuing his work of investigating the migration of birds. In this line of study he is working in concert with the American Ornithologist Union, of which he was one of the original promoters. The aim- ami methods of this association have been very ably presented to you by Dr. Merriam, its dele- pi to to the Royal Society of Canada. Tin- Natural History Society of New Brunswick hold its annual field meeting in Juno and a conversazione in April, and conducted a course of free lectures on Science during the winter months. The monthly meetings of the Society were well attended, and important additions were made to its museum anil library. Respectfully submitted, <!. F. MATTHEW, Acting Delegate. OTTAWA, L'lst"
