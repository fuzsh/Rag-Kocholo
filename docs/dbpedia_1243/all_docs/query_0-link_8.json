Questions we will be asking ourselves include: What do these narrative accounts of isolation reveal about the literary impulse behind bars? How does literature deal with (its own) limits?

Why are most women writers excluded from the literary canon? How does the woman artist/writer find her voice in a patriarchal society? Two overarching considerations of the course are whether womens rights are still considered a pressing concern by todays young women and men; and whether it is still necessary to teach a course such as this one, which focuses exclusively on literature written by (cisgender) women.

We will examine the key questions of the genre, including: the human beings place in the universe; the existence of life beyond Planet Earth; mortality and its transcendence; the presence or absence of a deity; the difficulty of social progress; the role of science and technology in shaping human interaction; the ethics of scientific and technological advancement and the role of the state therein; the evolution of concepts of gender, sexual relations, marriage, and reproduction in utopian and futuristic societies; and many more.\n\nGPA units: 1\n\nCommon Area: Literature\n\nTypically Offered: Every Third Year\n\nRUSS 253 — Fire & Ice: Siberia In Fiction\n\nThis course considers Siberia narrative as a distinct tradition (rather than a motif or sub-genre of Russian literature). Of primary importance to this distinction is a world view that regards nature as intrinsically sacred (a characterization that challenges characterizations of Siberia as a frozen wasteland or vast prison camp). While this perception of the earth as iconic is expressed in various ways from ancient oral tales of indigenous Siberian peoples to twenty-first century novels, important shared aspects of the relationship between the Siberian landscape and the people who inhabit it define, shape, and unite the tradition. In it, for example, we repeatedly see the perception of the natural world as an intentional (if not sentient) creator, whose immanence is experienced in the profound yet revelatory silence of Siberias steppe, taiga, and tundra. At its core, the Siberian narrative tradition describes the perception and experience of Siberia as a transcendent and sacred space which, I believe, may answer the following questions: What makes Siberian space sacred? What does it mean to be Siberian? What does Siberia mean to Russia?Readings, films, and discussions in this course focus on the idea of the sacred that grows out of human relationships of the various peoples of Siberia, non-indigenous natives, and other less willing residents of Siberia with its landmass and natural world. You will learn about the geology, ecology, and human history of Siberia and the belief systems and environmental philosophy that grows out of lived experience there. You explore expression and perceptions of the sacred in the following ways: narrative traditions of indigenous Siberian peoples; the rise of Russian monasticism/colonialism in Siberia starting in the sixteenth century and the development of hesychastic prayer practice in Russian Orthodoxy; the dueling views of Siberia from the nineteenth century as both a miraculous land (heaven) and a land of exile (hell); the representation of Siberia as a magical realm of creative and spiritual transformation and transcendence, which includes the discovery of Siberian shamanism by twentieth-century Russian Avant-garde; the birth of the ecology movement in twentieth-century Siberia in part a response to Soviet-era misperceptions and misuses of the environment and natural resources -- and the role of native Siberian narrative and its ecological values. Topics on nineteenth- and twentieth-century narrative include consideration of narratives about the tsarist and Soviet prison that challenge the idea of the sacred in Siberian space. Invited lectures will combine current trends in Siberian narrative and reconsider the future role of Siberia as it relates to global warming, natural resources, and the political and economic policies of the Russian Federation.\n\nGPA units: 1\n\nCommon Area: Cross-Cultural Studies, Studies in Religion\n\nTypically Offered: Alternate Years, Spring\n\nRUSS 254 — Russian Icons: Art & Soul\n\nThe Orthodox icon in Russia is a distinctive art form, a theological text, and an object of veneration.

We consider the meaning of Socialist Realism as a way to practice and understand art. We also discuss the merits and the dangers inherent in the relationship between this kind of literature and Soviet society, one that allowed a nation on its knees to rebuild and modernize as well as one that silenced countless authors. Students are also asked to discern how, in satirical or subversive works, the tenets of Socialist Realism are subverted and their values questioned and why, in today's Russia, there is a growing nostalgia (and market) for Socialist Realist art.

Throughout those centuries, the Mongol invasion, the establishment of Christianity, the intrigues of its leaders and the development of a national consciousness produced stunning works of art, architecture, music, literature, and letters.

By doing so, Benjamin frames translation as a complex relationship between two languages that requires deep thought on issues that range from finding the right word to the notion that there is a common sacred language that translation strives to express. In this course, you will explore various major philosophies and theories of translating from Russia and the West both from one language to the other and within a language itself. Topics will include the role and responsibilities of the translator, the meaning of the original text, the history of translation theories, theories and polemics of literary translation, translation as a literary art and tool of protest, strategies in specialized translations, and the importance of context in translation. You will also learn strategies of translation, as you continue to develop your Russian language skills by encountering a variety of advanced texts and implementing the kinds of strategies that make the process of translation an exciting way of exploring the complexities of two languages at once.\n\nPrerequisite: RUSS 201 or equivalent\n\nGPA units: 1\n\nCommon Area: Language Studies\n\nTypically Offered: Every Third Year, Spring\n\nRUSS 303 — Adv Studies in Russian Culture\n\nAn analysis of literary works and documentary material with the aim of probing Russian cultural traditions of the 19th, 20th and 21st centuries.

The legendary Faust readily sells out to the devil, only to realize that he has robbed his lover of her life, his neighbors of their property, and his society of democratic opportunities. Goethe, who coined the term World Literature, revised and expanded his play devoted to Faust for over half a century. His work garnered him international renown and his successors have updated the bargain for their times, culture, and history. In this course, we will explore similar quests that have cost many their Seelenfrieden (peace of mind) in various contexts around the globe. Further, considering that Goethe was an avid reader and translator of foreign literatures, we will examine how Faust shapes the concept of World Literature. Readings will be supplemented in class by musical and film renderings of the Faust theme.

Readings and discussions will focus on women's desire for knowledge as well as women's articulation of desire - the desire to be different without having to adapt to standards not set by themselves. The goal of self-determination will be differentiated with regard to both equal rights and equal responsibilities.

As well as studying the cultures reflected in these works of art and the emerging technologies that played a role in their mass-production, we will read works by canonical French authors inspired by the rapid succession of artistic movements which shook the 19th-century art world. Through the identification of various artistic strategies and techniques (inc. color theory, composition, perspective, etc.), students will learn to write detailed analyses of the works studied in class.

This period saw new forms of expression from the notion of pathetic fallacy to Science Fictions dystopian worlds emerge alongside the growing presence of news (true and false) of planetary upheaval in the public sphere. We will ask ourselves how representations of volcanic eruption, earthquake, flooding, etc. effect not only the literary, journalistic, and artistic production of the time, but also human wellbeing. How does French societys relationship to nature fluctuate throughout the 19th century? By the fin-de-siècle, does modern France need re-sensitizing to nature? And perhaps most importantly, what can we learn about climate change and our own ecological crisis by uncovering the roots of collapsology and eco-anxiety in these depictions of planetary upheaval?\n\nGPA units: 1\n\nCommon Area: Literature\n\nSTWL 299-S02 — Environmental Culture and the Early Modern World\n\nIn this course we will study how early modern authors and artists tackled questionsof great relevance for today: Does nature have a language and display agency?
