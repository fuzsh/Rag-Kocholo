This active and dynamic woman has always lived life to the fullest and never allowed herself to be brought down by scleroderma. The enormous amount of energy that she has devoted to fighting this terrible disease has evolved into a strong commitment to encourage and help others, and advance the cause of scleroderma. With the tireless support of her husband Gilles Houlé, she was able to motivate other scleroderma patients to get involved and form a Board of directors, thus giving birth in 1989 to Scleroderma Quebec.\n\nSince its inception,\n\nthe organization has come a long way.\n\nHere are some highlights:\n\n1989\n\nCreation of Scleroderma Quebec by Gilles Houlé and his wife, Suzanne Houlé.\n\n1992\n\nScleroderma Quebec becomes a registered charity (no. 89808 9693 RR0001) with the federal Government.\n\n1996\n\nPublication of Scleroderma Quebec’s first newsletter, created by Christiane Dubreuil and Robert Gravel.\n\n1998\n\nAppointment of Yvon Léveillé as chairman of the Board of directors.\n\n1999\n\nEstablishment of a listening and assistance service to support scleroderma patients and their families in several regions of Quebec.\n\n2000\n\nCreation by Robert Gravel of the organization’s first Website.\n\n2002\n\nRobert Gravel is appointed part-time executive director.\n\n2005\n\nEstablishment of the Scleroderma Research Chair at the Faculty of Medicine of the Université de Montréal, the first Scleroderma Chair in Canada.
