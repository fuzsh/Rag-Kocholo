        "text": "THE HEART OF OUR HISTORY: THE EMPRESS OF IRELAND\n\nThe Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-PÃ¨re (formerly the MusÃ©e de la mer) is a non-profit organization founded in 1980 by a group of divers who were all passionate about the Empress of Ireland. They assembled a collection of artifacts recovered from the wreck in the hopes of sharing the story of the May 29, 1914, sinking of the transatlantic liner with as many people as possible. The tragedy claimed the lives of 1,012 people and is, in many ways, comparable to the sinking of the Titanic.\n\n1982 The Site historique maritime de la Pointe-au-PÃ¨re (SHMP) left the exhibit space it had occupied for two summers at the Institut maritime du QuÃ©bec in Rimouski, partnered with Parks Canada, and moved to the Pointe-au-PÃ¨re Lighthouse National Historic Site, which it began to develop. The SHMP is located on a spit that reaches out to the river near the former St. Lawrence pilotsâ station and the wharf. These elements combine to create a distinctly maritime feel and show off a magnificent view of the marine estuary.\n\n2000 The SHMP built the Empress of Ireland Pavilion, which houses a multimedia projection room, an exhibit hall and a visitor centre.\n\n2014 The SHMP marked the hundred-year anniversary of the sinking of the Empress of Ireland. Descendants of passengers were invited to participate in the commemorative activities, and the event was a resounding success. A website has been created to gather their testimonies: empress2014.ca\n\nHangar 14 was inaugurated that same year, complementing the SHMP experience with an exhibition that takes visitors back in time to explore life in Quebec in 1914. Between 2018 and 2019, Hangar 14 hosted a puppet show \"Folie sur l'Ã©pave\", featuring characters inspired by the aquatic fauna of the St. Lawrence whose transformed the wreck of the Empress of Ireland into a museum. Since 2021, Hangar 14 has been transformed into a rest area for our visitors.\n\n2017 The Empress of Ireland Museum expanded, tripling its exhibit surface. With a modernized and immersive scenography, the exhibit introduces visitors to numerous artifacts and testimonies from passengers, along with the history pertaining to dives on the wreck. At the same time, important construction work has been undertaken by Parks Canada to restore the Pointe-au-PÃ¨re lighthouse and station.\n\nTHE ONONDAGA SAGA\n\n2005 The organization broadened the range of experiences available to visitors by acquiring the Onondaga submarine, which was decommissioned by National Defence in 2000.\n\nAfter a number of setbacks, the Onondaga submarine finally came to rest alongside the Pointe-au-PÃ¨re wharf. Over 92,000 people visited in 2009, the first year she was open to the public.\n\n2016 A mural has been painted on the bow of the Onondaga submarine by StÃ©phane Dufresne, a local artist, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the Yellow Submarine song from the Beatles. Several artistic events took place during the season, as we welcomed nearly 65 000 visitors."
