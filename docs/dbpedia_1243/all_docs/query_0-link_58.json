        "text": "Chief Justice Wagner delivered another of his annual press conferences today, his seventh. One was too many, and this was a good reminder of why. Before getting to the point, though, it may be worth repeating what I said on a similar occasion two years ago. The Chief Justice’s sense that the Supreme Court’s role and output should be transparent and intelligible to Canadians is not wrong. Indeed, I wrote, he “deserves praise for thinking about making his court’s role and jurisprudence more accessible. Courts wield public power, and people should be able to know what they do with it.” But that doesn’t mean everything done in the name of transparency and accessibility is wise. In that post, I criticized the Supreme Court’s hearings outside Ottawa. Here, I focus on the press conference itself.\n\nFor one thing, I think it is unseemly in focusing attention on the Chief Justice. Instead of shining a light on the institution which he leads, which is generally to the good, it puts him on a pedestal he neither needs nor deserves. Unsurprising, I suppose, for a man who thinks the court ought to have a bust of him in addition to the flesh-and-blood version, but indecorous all the same. He has no actual news to impart. He is simply attention-seeking, as if he were a common politician, which is the last thing he is supposed to be. There is no reason transparency cannot be combined with reserve ― and self-respect.\n\nBut there are less abstract reasons for avoiding press-conferences. Judges, even when appropriately mindful of the requirements of transparency, aren’t supposed to speak about certain things ― in particular, past, present, and future cases, though they should also avoid becoming political commentators. Journalists, though, don’t necessarily understand this, and ask questions that invite judges to cross these lines. I don’t blame them. Asking questions, even not terribly appropriate ones, is their job, and a press-conference by the Chief Justice is bound to attract journalists who are not especially well versed in these proprieties anyway. The problem, rather, is that the Chief Justice is willingly putting himself in a position where he is tempted to answer questions he should not be answer. And he gives in to the temptation.\n\nThus, according to La Presse’s report of today’s proceedings, he castigated political responses to a reference to “a person with a vagina” in R v Kruk, 2024 SCC 7 (including a unanimous motion by the Quebec National Assembly, because, well, it’s the Quebec National Assembly) as “misinformation”. I don’t care about the merits of particular culture-war skirmish. What is important to me is that judges are supposed to let reasons for judgment speak for themselves. It’s not their role to go out and defend them after the fact. Least of all that of the judges of the Supreme Court of Canada, who are not short of defenders in the media and the academy.\n\nBut perhaps more worrying is the fact that the Chief Justice is wading into the public debate about “disinformation” and its dangers. I actually agree with at least one point he is making, which is that elected officials are a particularly concerning source of bs, or disinformation if you prefer. But, in part for that very reason, they are tempted to legislate against it (when peddled by their partisan opponents of course), and the Chief Justice may well have to rule on the constitutionality of their endeavours. It is unhelpful, to say the least, for him to venture his opinions on the subject in advance.\n\nAnother matter that could end up before him in even shorter order is the litigation about the federal government’s failure to promptly replacing retiring judges, which has resulted in a highly deleterious level of judicial vacancies, and, in turn, to cases, including important prosecutions, not being able to proceed. In Hameed v Canada (Prime Minister), 2024 FC 242, the federal court contrived to find a constitutional violation in this (readers may recall that I was not impressed with its reasons, though the outcome is a closer call), but the government is appealing. It is not difficult to imagine this case going all the way up. So you’d think the Chief Justice would have the good sense to refrain from speaking on this subject. But no, the CBC has the video of his doing so. His remarks are relatively conciliatory, but that’s beside the point. He should shut up about a case that is, likely enough, heading his way.\n\nFinally, the Chief Justice really should not be answering questions about the United States. He knows this, but cannot help himself. Two years ago it was the January 6 events he felt the need to go on about. This time, inevitably, it’s Donald Trump’s recent conviction. La Presse quotes him as saying that he would “not comment that particular situation, what is happening in that country”. There, he knows it! And yet: “I have decided to stop understanding what’s going on”. We would not, oh no we would not, have done without his snark and his “smile” (dixit La Presse). And of course the Chief Justice had to get in a comment to the effect that judicial appointments in the US are “polluted” by partisanship. I bet he’ll tell that to, say, Ketanji Brown Jackson the next time they have one of their Canada-US supreme court junkets. This is perhaps less important than the other issues, but it’s a good illustration of how the press conference format leads the Chief Justice into saying things he himself knows he shouldn’t be.\n\nThis entire exercise is worse than useless. The Chief Justice’s views on the issues of the day do not, contrary to his supposed intent, clarify the Supreme Court’s work to the public. Like his hypertrophied image-consciousness, they only serve to undermine the perception if not the reality of impartiality on which the Court’s legitimacy depends even more than on a broad understanding of its work. The Chief Justice’s apparent conviction that sharing them is valuable comes across as the symptom of an unhealthy self-importance. He has missed to many opportunities to keep quiet already; but there will always be a next one.\n\nIn my last post, I summarized and criticized the Federal Court’s decision in Hameed v Canada (Prime Minister), 2024 FC 242, which declared that the government of Canada has a duty under the constitution to just get on with judicial appointments already. Emmett Macfarlane has made many similar points on his Substack as well. But, as I noted, while the actual reasons given by Brown J were very bad, that doesn’t mean there weren’t serious arguments to be made for the outcome he reached ― though I’m not sure whether any such arguments were actually put to him by counsel. In this post, I review these arguments.\n\nBy way of reminder, the way I see it, there are two key substantive issues, on which I focus. First, is the government’s failure to ensure timely judicial appointments judicially reviewable in principle? And second, if it is, is there a judicially administrable standard by which the constitutionality of government inaction regarding judicial appointments might be assessed? As to the first, the government’s objection has to do with the involvement of constitutional conventions in judicial appointments. As to the second, the difficulty is that there is simply no standard apparent in the relevant constitutional or statutory provisions.\n\nIn reality, the first issue breaks down into several different ones. As Mark Walters points out in a very important article on “Judicial Review of Ministerial Advice to the Crown“, “it is important to distinguish between decisions made by the Governor General based on ministerial advice and decisions of the Governor in Council”. The former include the appointment of Superior Court judges pursuant to s 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867; the latter, the appointment of Federal Court judges pursuant to s 5.2 of the Federal Courts Act. Failure to draw this distinction is a mistake in the identification of the conventions of judicial appointments committed in Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 31, which is carried over in Hameed as I mentioned in my last post.\n\nConventions are, indeed, involved in both situations, but in different ways. In the case of Governor in Council appointments,\n\nAlthough it is only by virtue of convention that the legal powers conferred upon the “Governor in Council” are exercised by the Governor and present cabinet ministers, it is by virtue of law that these ministers, sitting as a committee of the Privy Council, participate with the Governor to make the decision. In these circumstances, ministers are not merely advising the Governor as to what he or she should decide; they are, as a matter of law, joining with the Governor to make the decision.\n\nThe law at issue is, so far as appointments under the Federal Courts Act (and other statutory provisions) are concerned, s 35(1) of the Interpretation Act. What this means, I think, is that there is no ministerial advice that can be reviewed ― or that could be unreviewable ― separately from the decision, or failure to make a decision, by the Governor in Council. Rather, so far as appointments to the Federal Court are concerned, if one can identify a legal duty to make such appointments in a timely manner and a judicially administrable standard against which the exercise of such a duty can be measured, the conventional aspect of the appointments powers is beside the point and there is no obstacle to reviewability.\n\nAppointments on advice, i.e. those to the Superior Courts, are a different beast. Here, conventions do matter. But, as Professor Walters argues, this is not to say that they are not reviewable. Professor Walters’s article is a comment on the challenge brought by Aniz Alani against the then-Prime Minister’s policy, first implicit and then overt, of not making appointments to the Senate. (I blogged about it here.) As he notes, the government’s response was to argue\n\nthat the Crown has the legal authority to act and the minister’s role is only to advise, and it will be added, with emphasis, that the advice is given as a matter of constitutional convention only and so cannot be the subject of judicial review. In this way, executive power may be exercised in a legal black hole. (35)\n\nProfessor Walters suggests that there are two potential “way[s] to address this worrisome conclusion”. (35) Of these,\n\nOne … is to question the assumption that constitutional conventions are never justiciable. Perhaps the time has come to contemplate the possibility of at least declaratory judicial relief when ministerial advice flouts established conventional rules. In this way, the veil of law would be pierced to reveal where real power lies. (35)\n\nThis is the approach Brown J took in Hameed, but he did so in a very clumsy, and indeed quite untenable, manner. I will return to this possibility below, because more can be said about it. But first, let me recount the other option outlined, quite persuasively in my view, by Professor Walters.\n\nProfessor Walters argues that “[t]he idea that ministerial advice to the Crown is a matter unknown to and outside the law … is a misunderstanding that results from the confusion between law and convention”. (37) It is law ― specifically, s 11 of the Constitution Act, 1867 ― that sets up the Privy Council as a body of advisors to the Crown. Convention, of course, is both what dictates that its advisory function is exercised, from time to time, by the ministers for the time being, and that the Crown is required to follow its advice. But the giving of advice, as such, is no more and no less than the Privy Council’s legal duty. And if the advisors fail in the discharge of this duty by offering advice that is unlawful or unconstitutional in itself (e.g. because it was procured corruptly) or because it will result in the Crown breaking the law, they can be held accountable for that:\n\nMinisterial advice to the Crown, though triggered by convention, is given in the performance of a legal duty by ministers who hold a legal office, and the common law has always regarded ministers as legally responsible for the advice they give. Ministerial advice does not operate within a legal black hole. Of course, the old authorities … contemplate either a criminal prosecution or an action in tort, with examples of fraud, corruption, malicious abuse of public office, or flagrant neglect of public duties being given. I am not suggesting that the law historically acknowledged a modern remedy of judicial review of ministerial advice based upon public law principles of rationality, legality and fairness. I do think, however, that once the domain of ministerial advice is understood to be one governed by law, the forms of law that discipline advice must be understood in the usual legal way as expanding with the incremental developments that have shaped modern public law generally. (39)\n\nI find this compelling. And I think that the UK Supreme Court’s judgment in R (Miller) v Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41, [2020] AC 373 (Miller II) can be understood as giving effect to this approach to ministerial accountability. This was a case where the UK Supreme Court treated as reviewable the advice given by the Prime Minister to the Queen to prorogue Parliament. As the Court noted,\n\nthe power to order the prorogation of Parliament is a prerogative power: that is to say, a power recognised by the common law and exercised by the Crown, in this instance by the sovereign in person, acting on advice, in accordance with modern constitutional practice. It is not suggested in these appeals that Her Majesty was other than obliged by constitutional convention to accept that advice. In the circumstances, we express no view on that matter. That situation does, however, place on the Prime Minister a constitutional responsibility, as the only person with power to do so, to have regard to all relevant interests, including the interests of Parliament. [32]\n\nThe appointment of Superior Court judges is not, to be sure, a prerogative power, but one set out in constitutional legislation, but I don’t think that changes the situation. If Canadian courts follow the Miller II approach, then the decisions of the persons and entities with the constitutional responsibility to have regard to the relevant interests, in this instance those of the judiciary and of the litigants who come before it, should be amenable to review, because there can be no suggestion that the Governor General is “other than obliged by constitutional convention to accept [their] advice” ― or, more to the point, prevented from acting in the absence of advice.\n\nNow let’s consider the argument for the justiciability of constitutional conventions. For my part, I have long found the orthodox account of conventions as radically different from legal rules quite unpersuasive. This is not because conventions are judge-made rules, as Brown J claims, but rather because the distinction between rules that have a judicial origin and those that originate in politics simply does not matter very much. Statutes originate in politics too, after all. And of course common law rules aren’t always “judge-made” in the crude Benthamite sense. Many originate in the practices of other actors, commercial ones for example, and/or in the principles embedded in the legal system. Courts can identify such rules ― though, unlike Brown J, they must do so rigorously and carefully ― and apply them.\n\nThe trouble with this argument is that most people don’t agree with it. More importantly, apex courts don’t agree with it. As I am about to suggest, they no longer adhere to the orthodox rigid distinction between law and convention either, but nor are they prepared to simply accept what the Patriation Reference, Re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 SCR 753, described as the crystallization of convention into law. The majority in the Patriation Reference is clear about this, and has never been directly repudiated in Canada or elsewhere. Indeed it was endorsed by the UK Supreme Court in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5, [2018] AC 61, and it too hasn’t been directly repudiated. I can and will go on thinking that these cases are wrong, but a judge bound by one or the other cannot act if it didn’t exist.\n\nBut that’s not the end of the matter either. While things are not especially clear, Reference re Senate Reform, 2014 SCC 32, [2014] 1 SCR 704 may suggest a workaround to the dichotomy between law and convention asserted in the Patriation Reference. In that opinion, the Supreme Court relied on the concept of a “constitutional architecture”, which has something to do with “[t]he assumptions that underlie the [constitutional] text and the manner in which the constitutional provisions are intended to interact with one another”. [26] A law that would interfere with this architecture is as unconstitutional as one that contravenes an explicit provision of the constitution. Because the Court’s definition of “architecture” is sparse if not cryptic, there are different views on what it encompasses. I have argued that “architecture” is, simply put, a codeword for conventions. Others who have written on the subject may take a somewhat different view of the matter, but at any rate I think there is a credible argument to be made that advice, or perhaps even more so lack of advice, to the Governor General is, in principle, judicially reviewable if it would result in the undermining of “assumptions that underlie the text” of the constitution, regardless of the involvement of conventions in the process.\n\nSo where does that leave us? Recall that, for now, we have only been considering the first issue in Hameed: whether the government’s failure to ensure that judicial vacancies are filled in a timely fashion is in principle amenable to judicial review. I have argued that the answer is yes so far as Governor in Council appointments to the Federal Court are concerned, in the same way as failure to perform a statutory duty by any official or entity. The case of Governor-acting-on-advice appointments to the Superior Courts is less clear, but there are strong arguments for their being reviewable too, either on the basis of legal accountability for unlawful advice expounded by Professor Walters and demonstrated in Miller II, or through the invocation of the constitutional architecture referred to in the Senate Reform Reference.\n\nAssuming that the government’s slowness in appointing judges is reviewable in principle, the question nevertheless arises whether there is legal standard by which it can be judged. Or is the pace of judicial appointments the kind of policy or discretionary matter that can only be subject to political, but not legal, accountability? (It is worth emphasizing that political accountability is important and should be pursued regardless of whether legal accountability is (also) available!) As I wrote in my last post, Brown J’s invention of a convention of prompt appointments to serve this purpose is indefensible. Even if violations of conventions are justiciable, they have to be real conventions that exist out there in the political world, and not judicial concoctions. Is there something else?\n\nThis is not obvious, to say the least. It is entirely fair to note that both the Constitution Act, 1867 and the Federal Courts Act make the appointment of judges pursuant to their respective provisions mandatory, using the word “shall”, and that, as Brown J suggests, it would be disturbing if the executive could undermine legislative choices as to the number of judges by refusing to fill the judicial positions created by provincial legislatures and Parliament. At the same time, no one, including Brown J, actually believes that any vacancy existing for any length of time is ipso facto a constitutional or statutory violation. The mandatory language in the relevant provisions is, it would seem, subject to an implicit qualification accepting at least some degree of churn ― and executive discretion.\n\nThat said, this discretion cannot be unlimited either ― Roncarelli v Duplessis, [1959] SCR 121, tells us this much. A Roncarelli-like scenario, where the executive misused its discretion for an improper purpose ― for example to punish a recalcitrant court by refusing to make appointments ― should be easy for a court to deal with. This is not a far-fetched hypothetical: think, again, about the Alani litigation concerning the Senate, and also of the delays in making appointments to the Supreme Court after the debacle of l’Affaire Nadon. But I don’t think that there is any suggestion of improper motive in the current situation; that would be, to quote the one and only Sir Humphrey Appleby, to mistake lethargy for strategy.\n\nProfessor Walters suggests what might be a further constraint on advice-giving discretion:\n\nat least in those cases where the reasons for advice are publicly given or can otherwise be established through evidence … the question of whether those reasons are consistent with constitutional values and structure may well be, in the appropriate circumstances, a question of law for the courts to determine. (40)\n\nBut that doesn’t help much. The whole problem in Hameed is that there is no advice, and seemingly no specific reasons for the lack of any. Again, lethargy, not strategy. Moreover, even apart from that, a government may be able to argue (though I take it that it has not in fact argued) that its slowness in appointing judges is due to the difficulties it encountering in balancing relevant values, such as diversity, with the operational needs of the judiciary. If the reviewing court is inclined to be deferential ― and, as the Supreme Court reminded us in Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest v. Northwest Territories (Education, Culture and Employment), 2023 SCC 31, courts are supposed to be deferential to executive value-balancing, whether that makes any sense or not ― then this may well be enough to let the executive off the hook.\n\nLastly, there is the Miller II move: there, the UK Supreme Court said that prerogative powers are implicitly limited by constitutional principles, such that any use of the prerogative that undermines relevant principles needs to be justified by the executive as being proportional to the interference with the principles in question. There is at least an argument for treating constitutionally codified powers in the same manner as prerogative ones ― though I’m not sure that’s right. If this argument is accepted; and if, further, the Miller II reasoning is to be taken at face value; then it might work in the specific circumstances of Hameed, the government having, rather like in Miller II, not bothered to justify itself. But, for my part, I am not at all convinced that Miller II should be taken at face value: I have argued that, instead, what it really did was to enforce a putative constitutional convention governing the permissible length of prorogations, identified pursuant to an implicit application of the same sort of test I described in my last post. If that is so, then we are back to square one, since there is no plausible constitutional convention to be enforced here.\n\nSo there you have it: I think that failure to ensure that judicial appointments take place to fill the vacancies on Canadian courts is, in principle, judicially reviewable, but there is probably no standard by which timeliness of appointments, as opposed to something like an outright refusal to make any, could be assessed, which makes the question ultimately non-justiciable. That said, I am more confident about the first part of this conclusion than the second ― that is, about reviewability-in-principle than about the lack of standards. This case is complicated, and closer than I thought at first.\n\nWhat isn’t close is the underlying question of what needs to be done. The government should just get on with making those judicial appointments. They may well have sound arguments for avoiding being told to do so by a judge. But this should never have come to litigation in the first place. The Alani case ultimately became moot when the government accepted its constitutional responsibility for appointing Senators. Ideally, Hameed should be concluded in the same manner.\n\nYesterday, the Federal Court delivered a decision declaring that the Canadian government has a constitutional duty to ensure timely judicial appointments and setting out specific targets to attain: Hameed v Canada (Prime Minister), 2024 FC 242. The outcome is a startling one, but it is Justice Brown’s reasons that are truly remarkable, and not in a good way. The outcome, indeed, might even be defensible, at least in part, though I doubt it. But Brown J’s reasons are pernicious.\n\nHameed is something of a constitutional law professor’s crazy exam hypothetical. The bottom line is simple enough. The federal government has long been slow to appoint judges to vacancies that arise, despite warnings from the legal community and indeed entreaties from various institutions and leaders, including, notably, a strongly-worded letter from the Chief Justice of Canada. Is this tardiness unconstitutional on the basis that the government has a duty to fill judicial vacancies promptly as they arise? But to answer this question, or more precisely for the federal court to answer this question, an impressive number of issues need to be addressed, from standing, to federal court jurisdiction, to evidentiary issues, to the nature of the alleged duty, to the remedy. And pretty much each of these issues falls somewhere on the spectrum from not-altogether-straightforward to really quite complex.\n\nThe substantive heart of the case, however, has to do with just two issues. First, is the government’s failure to ensure timely judicial appointments judicially reviewable in principle? And second, if it is, is there a judicially administrable standard by which the constitutionality of government inaction regarding judicial appointments might be assessed? This framing, to be clear, is mine, not Brown J’s, and heavily influenced, on the one hand, by the UK Supreme Court’s decision in R (Miller) v Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41, [2020] AC 373, and on the other, by Mark Walters’s illuminating article on “Judicial Review of Ministerial Advice to the Crown“, neither of which is cited in Hameed despite their relevance.\n\nIn this post, I describe Brown J’s approach to these two issues and explain why it is wrongheaded. In a follow-up post, I will explain why, nonetheless, the outcome of the case on a proper approach to these issues is a close issue that deserves much more careful thought than Brown J has given it.\n\nWhether the government’s role in ensuring timely judicial appointments is justiciable at all, let alone in the Federal Court, is a difficult issue because of the involvement of constitutional conventions. Brown J draws on the Federal Court’s discussion of these conventions in Democracy Watch v. Canada (Attorney General), 2023 FC 31, which found that\n\nBy constitutional convention, when appointing judges to provincial superior courts, the Governor General acts on the advice of the Committee of the Privy Council of Canada. Similarly, the [Governor in Council], which appoints judges to the Federal Court, the Federal Court of Appeal, and the Tax Court of Canada, is defined in the Interpretation Act … as the Governor General acting on the advice or consent of the Privy Council for Canada. The Privy Council is composed of all the ministers of the Crown, who meet in the body known as Cabinet … As such, all federal judicial appointments are made by the Governor General on the advice of Cabinet. In turn, Cabinet acts on the advice of the Minister of Justice … In the case of appointment of Chief Justices and Associate Chief Justices, it is the Prime Minister who provides the advice to Cabinet. [9]\n\nUnfortunately, this description contains two important mistakes. The most glaring but less consequential one lies in the description of the Privy Council as “composed of all the ministers of the Crown, who meet in the body known as Cabinet”. As Professor Walters explains,\n\nThe Privy Council for Canada is established by section 11 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and consists of all present and former ministers of the Crown as well as a variety of other members. … [I]t is only by virtue of convention that the legal powers conferred upon the “Governor in Council” are exercised by the Governor and present cabinet ministers. (34; emphasis in the original)\n\nIn other words, the Cabinet is the political, conventional entity through which the legal body that is the Privy Council acts; they are not the same. The second mistake is more subtle but more consequential: it consists in conflating judicial appointments by the Governor General and those by the Governor-in-Council. I will return to it in the follow-up post, though you will know what I’ll say there if you read Professor Walters’s article in the meantime.\n\nBack to Brown J’s reasoning. On the orthodox view of Westminster-type constitutions, constitutional conventions are, in Dicey’s famous words, “not in reality laws at all since they are not enforced by the courts”. Is it the case, then, that in asking the court to require the Cabinet to provide its conventionally-mandated advice to the Governor General, the applicant is seeking to have a convention enforced, which cannot be done?\n\nBrown J says no. He cites the Patriation Reference (though he at times misnames it as the Repatriation Reference), Re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 SCR 753, for the proposition that while courts cannot enforce a convention, they can issue a declaration stating its import. Moreover, the conventions regulating judicial appointments\n\nform part of Canada’s federal constitutional common law in the sense they are judge-made rules which the courts are entitled and may recognize in the appropriate case through the Court’s declaratory power, notwithstanding they are not laws that may been [sic] enforced by the courts. [122]\n\nA breach of this “federal constitutional common law” by the Cabinet is reviewable by the Federal Court, in the same way as a breach of any federal law by a federal official is reviewable under the Federal Courts Act.\n\nThis is fundamentally wrong. As a matter of positive law as well as learned orthodoxy, it is absolutely not the case that conventions are a form of “constitutional common law”. Indeed, the majority opinion on the legal question in the Patriation Reference explicitly rejects this very view. In dismissing the idea of a “crystallisation” of conventions into legal rules, it says:\n\nThe leap from convention to law is explained almost as if there was a common law of constitutional law, but originating in political practice. That is simply not so. What is desirable as a political limitation does not translate into a legal limitation, without expression in imperative constitutional text or statute. (784)\n\nAs I will explain in the follow-up post (and as longtime readers will know), I am no fan of the Patriation Reference legal question majority. But it is binding on Brown J, whether he is a fan of it or not! He does not refer to this passage, which strikes me as very poor judicial craft. Moreover, the one thing that the Patriation Reference unquestionably does get right is that conventions “originat[e] in political practice”; in no way, shape, or form are they “judge-made”. As the UK Supreme Court put it in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union [2017] UKSC 5, [2018] AC 61 “[j]udges … are neither the parents nor the guardians of political conventions”. [146] One can object to the “guardians” bit; but it undeniably true that judges are not the “parents” of constitutional conventions.\n\nAnd the idea of common law rules that aren’t enforceable by courts makes no sense at all; statutory provisions can be made unenforceable (as parts of the Official Languages Act used to be), but the common law doesn’t exist apart from judicial enforcement. If conventions are just common law rules, then they are in principle enforceable, subject to justiciability concerns in specific cases, and not merely declarable.\n\nBrown J’s treatment of the issue of the standard by which to assess the government’s inaction is, if anything, even more cavalier. He points out that “Parliament has determined what it considered an appropriate number of judges required by the Superior Courts, including the Federal Courts, …. in legislation authorizing that number of appointments” and that failure to appoint these judges not only undermines the judiciary but also amounts to “Canada’s executive government … ignor[ing] the express will of Parliament”. [126] I have no quarrel with that ― on the contrary, this is an important point for, at the very least, the government to consider, whether or not it can also give rise to judicial remedies. But what follows is not so sensible.\n\nThe key passage deserves to be set out at some length. Brown J writes that\n\n[T]he acknowledged constitutional convention that it is the exclusive authority of the Respondents to advise in respect of vacancies necessarily implies the related constitutional convention that judicial vacancies must be filled as soon as possible after vacancies arise, except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nIn this connection, nothing suggests Democracy Watch, which affirmed the existence of the convention, is the last word on the subject. …\n\n[T]he Court should now recognize that the relevant constitutional conventions include not only the responsibility to take steps to fill vacancies as soon as possible, but in this appalling and critical situation, to materially reduce the present backlog to what it was as recently as the Spring of 2016, that is to reduce the vacancies to the mid-40s across the federally appointed provincial Superior Courts and Federal Courts. [129-131]\n\nThis is just terrible. A court cannot simply will “conventions” into existence because they would be useful. The most charitable interpretation I can give to Brown J’s approach here is that he is getting high on his own supply, namely on the confusion between conventions and “judge-made” common law. But, pace Bentham, even those who would describe the common law as being “judge-made” (not an uncontroversial description), would not countenance such blithe creation of new common law rules for no other reason than their seeming desirability. At the very least, there are concerns about the limits of the judicial role in the development of the law that must be addressed.\n\nIf one accepts that it is appropriate for courts to address constitutional conventions, then one must adopt a rigorous approach to identifying them. Indeed, this is no different from what a court will do when dealing with common law or statutory rules ― it will carefully analyse precedents or interpret the legislature’s words, and not just say that a rule must exist to deal with this or that exigency. The methods for identifying the relevant rule vary depending the rule’s type, but not the need for a method.\n\nThere are two methods for identifying conventions. The easy one is by relying on authorities ― one can think, for example, of Andrew Heard’s magisterial book Canadian Constitutional Conventions. The harder one, given the imprimatur of the majority opinion on the conventional question in the Patriation Reference, is a test first developed by Sir W. Ivor Jennings, which asks whether there are precedents for the alleged conventional rule, whether the constitutional actors involved followed the rule out of a sense of obligation, and whether there is a constitutional reason for the rule.\n\nBrown J doesn’t even pretend to follow either of these methods for identifying the purported convention requiring prompt judicial appointments. He points to no authority. Nor does he identify any precedents. This case, of course arises precisely because the government evidently does not follow the alleged rule and does not consider itself bound to do so. Now, that is not fatal: the Patriation Reference also arose out of the actions of a government that refused to recognize and be bound by a conventional rule. But there the Supreme Court pointed to a long course of past practice and acknowledgment of its binding character. That is entirely missing from Brown J’s reasons.\n\nHe thinks that he can simply conjure up a convention nobody’s thought of before, because past decisions don’t get “the last word on the subject”. But the question isn’t whether a case is “the last word”. It’s what conventions actually exist out there in the real world. It is bad enough when courts start “giv[ing] constitutional benediction” to new rights whose time they think has come, as the Supreme Court did in Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v Saskatchewan, 2015 SCC 4, [2015] 1 SCR 245. But awful as that was, still the words of the constitutional text, however distorted from their original meaning, provide some modest measure of constraint even on wilful interpreters. If courts can give benediction to dreamt up conventions, there really isn’t anything they cannot add to the constitution just because they feel like it.\n\nI cannot help but think that Brown J was so completely blinded by what he perceived as the practical necessities of the situation as to cut every corner imaginable on the way to a result of whose vital importance he was convinced. He begins his judgment by asserting that “[a]t its core, this matter concerns” the Chief Justice’s letter to the Prime Minister regarding the pressing need for judicial vacancies to be filled. [1] He is determined not to “allow the current untenable and crisis number of vacancies to remain unacceptably high with the negative consequences set out in the letter”. [126]\n\nBut that’s not how this judging business works. A court case is never about a letter sent by a non-party. I hesitate to speak to the letter’s admissibility, not only because this post is long but also, and more importantly, because the law of evidence is not my forte. But let me just note my puzzlement at Brown J’s repeated reference to that letter as “expert opinion” [12] and indeed “expert evidence” [124] when the Chief Justice wasn’t a witness. Be that as it may, a court case can only ever be about the law. Brown J lost sight of that altogether, and produced one of the more staggering judgments I can think of in a long, long time. (I should note, in fairness, that, assuming his account of the parties’ arguments is complete, he may have been very poorly served by them, especially the applicant.)\n\nThe irony is that there would have been serious legal issues to discuss, and a decision based on careful legal argument would have much better served the cause that Brown J tries to advance. And it is not a bad cause. The slowness of the federal government’s judicial appointments has been discussed, so far as I remember, from its early days in office. When the Chief Justice and Brown J denounce the current state of affairs, they are not wrong. I can only hope that the government takes the underlying message Brown J is trying to send seriously. But if the Canadian judiciary is broken, or nearly broken, the way to put it back together again is not by judges taking the need to do so for a warrant to do it. “Something must be done” is not a legal argument. As I said, I will try to consider actual legal arguments in my next post.\n\nJustice Joëlle Roy, of Quebec’s provincial court, is not amused. At all. And she’ll have you know it. More importantly, she’ll have all involved in a sexual assault and incest case she’d been hearing know it. Even though neither they nor the case had anything to do with Justice Roy not being amused. No matter: as La Presse reported, Justice Roy pulled out of the trial, though a further report confirms the proceedings will after all be able to continue with a different judge (in application, so far as I can tell, of s 669.2 of the Criminal Code). But it’s a most unfortunate story, which reminds us of a fundamental requirement for judicial anatomy: a thick skin, to go with a stiff spine, a solid gut, and a good brain.\n\nJustice Roy’s tantrum is in response to a column by Yves Boisvert, also in La Presse. Mr. Boisvert describes a judgment by Justice Roy in a different sexual assault case, which in his view is badly tainted by an embrace of rape myths of the perfect-victim variety ― he writes that it “is not too far away from the notorious ‘why didn’t you keep your knees’ together, which got an Albertan judge removed from office” (translation mine, here and below). Mr. Boisvert then proceeds to make a broader point about Justice Roy: “Within just seven years of her appointment, she has already been harshly rebuked by appellate courts on multiple occasions,” which he then lists. Not just reversed, mind you, but reversed based on “serious and repeated errors of judgment”, which, Mr. Boisvert argues, raise questions about Justice Roy’s “competence”.\n\nThis is harsh criticism, no doubt. But it is criticism based on facts presented to the reader and detailed so far as a newspaper column permits (though I do wish newspapers ― especially those, like La Presse, that are only published online anyway ― actually linked to judgments when those are available). And, while this wouldn’t excuse unfair criticism, it is worth noting that Mr. Boisvert is a knowledgeable and experienced writer about the justice system. I have had my differences with him, but he is neither a hack nor a rabble-rouser. I haven’t read the judgments he discusses, so I won’t express a definitive opinion on the fairness of his column, but even if one disagrees with it, it does not strike me as a hit piece. And it is certainly not an attack on Joëlle Roy the person rather than Justice Roy the judge.\n\nIn other words, it is a piece of perfectly legitimate criticism directed at the holder of a public office. It is precisely the sort of thing that journalists are expected to do. And office-holders are expected to put up with this sort of thing, because it comes with their station ― no less than the forms of respect and the salaries to which they are entitled. This is no less true of judges than of elected officials, because judges exercise coercive power over citizens. It is, or at any rate it ought to be true, that they do not control the “direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society” and “may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment”. But when they are lacking in precisely that quality which they are called upon to exercise, they not only can but must be criticised for it. To be sure, as I have noted here, there are examples of criticism that goes far beyond what is justifiable, which should be denounced. But even then, that task falls not to the judges themselves, but by those of us who care about the judicial system.\n\nJustice Roy, seemingly, is not of this view. The La Presse story linked to above describes her taking to the bench twice rather than once, in the aforementioned incest trial, to respond to Mr. Boisvert’s column. On the day it was published, Justice Roy described it as a “very vicious personal attack”. The next day, she read a prepared statement calling it “very violent”, and explaining her words the day before as due to her having “been punched. Because yes, words are sometimes like punches, more vicious even, especially when they are of this sort and magnitude.”\n\nThis is a remarkable outburst ― La Presse quotes judicial ethics experts who struggle to recall its like. They also point out that it calls Justice Roy’s “equanimity” (“sérénité“) into question. So it does. Her judgment too ― ironically, perhaps, but unsurprisingly, since that’s what Mr. Boisvert’s column said. To repeat, that column is not a personal attack. It is criticism of the manner in which an office-holder discharges her duties. But even a personal attack does not justify the “words are violence” move that Justice Roy pulls with an obliviousness that would be comical if it were less sad. Words, even very nasty words addressed to public officials, are not violence. It is a good thing that Canadian law no longer recognizes the contempt of “scandalizing the court”, which referred to doing or saying something “calculated to bring a Court or a judge of the Court into contempt, or to lower his authority” ( R v Gray, [1900] 2 QB 36). One can only imagine how Justice Roy would have used it.\n\nI am sure that it is thoroughly unpleasant for a judge to read public criticism, whether on a blog like this one, in a journal article (assuming judges read those once in a blue moon), or in a newspaper. It must hurt, and it must hurt all the more when it follows on from criticism delivered by the Court of Appeal, to which judges are sensitive. But, again, this comes with the office and with the nicer things about it. When you work for the public, especially in a position that involves sending members of the public to prison ― or failing to do so ― you have to put up with public scrutiny and even with public nastiness. If you don’t like that, you always have the option of resigning, and freeing up the spot on the bench for someone who is better able to cope with criticism. Who knows, they might even give less occasion for such criticism into the bargain.\n\nYesterday, the Canadian Judicial Council published a report recommending the removal from office of a Quebec Superior Court judge, Gérard Dugré. I hadn’t followed this sordid story until now, and was a bit wary on seeing the news, especially given that media reports mentioned, somewhat blandly, off-colour remarks and such as grounds for the CJC’s recommendation. Was it a case of tone policing rather than genuine misconduct? It turns out, no ― not at all.\n\nI haven’t been able to find out much about Justice Dugré’s career prior to his appointment to the bench, but here’s at least one indication that it was an accomplished one: back in 2006, he was named Plaideur de l’année ― oral advocate of the year ― by Le Monde juridique. Among other winners of this particular accolade is one Suzanne Côté, in 2008, now of course Justice Côté of the Supreme Court of Canada. Presumably, one doesn’t get this sort of recognition without being a talented and hardworking lawyer, as Justice Côté’s example suggests. Unfortunately, on his appointment to the bench, Justice Dugré did not live up to this kind of standard.\n\nThe CJC report proposes two grounds for his removal, each of them independently sufficient. The first is chronic tardiness in the delivery of judgments Justice Dugré took under advisement. The second, the one that seems to have attracted more media attention, is his persistent misbehaviour in the courtroom.\n\nOn the subject of delay, the report deals with two somewhat different issues. For one thing, there was a particular case where Justice Dugré disregarded his own undertaking to the parties to give judgment promptly in light of the exigency of the circumstances (the matter involved the sale of a family home, and delay resulted in heavy financial costs as well as, obviously, stress and inconvenience). Having let the parties think the case would be disposed of in weeks if not days, Justice Dugré took eight months.\n\nBut this case was, it turns out, merely illustrative. Concerns about Justice Dugré’s slowness were raised early in his tenure. He received both admonitions and help from his Chief Justices and Associate Chief Justices. His assistant kept track of his delays, presumably as part of this process. It was all to no avail. Of his\n\n185 judgments, 60% … were rendered more than six months after being taken under advisement and 18% were rendered more than a year after that date. … [T]here were no other judges who experienced comparable delays in rendering judgments. [67]\n\nOne shudders at the thought of the cost this imposed on everyone involved in these cases ― again, financial cost, stress, delayed life plans. The CJC is right that a judge who behaves like this must not be allowed to continue in office.\n\nAnd then, there are Justice Dugré’s courtroom antics. I will give only a few examples from the litany in the CJC report, which itself, I take it, is only a selection from what had been established during the fact-finding process. It is hard not to chuckle at reading some them ― Justice Dugré’s mannerisms had a certain darkly comedic quality. Only, he was a judge, not a comic, and there were real people at the receiving end of it all.\n\nFor example, in what the CJC describes as “a choice of school case” (in the family law context, I assume), Justice Dugré “[o]n two occasions, proposed a solution whereby the child in question would be sent to boarding school or put up for adoption”. [68] In a civil case, Justice Dugré\n\n[m]ade jokes in reference to allegations of sexual misconduct about a\n\ncolleague of one of the parties. He asked whether one of the parties had\n\nbeen “accused of sexual assault yet”, suggesting that he just wanted to\n\nmake sure that “everyone’s behaved themselves.” The case had\n\nabsolutely nothing to do with sexual assault. [70]\n\nIn a different family law case, Justice Dugré “[s]uggested the complainant’s non-disclosure of certain documents could result in a finding of contempt of court and incarceration in a cell with starving rats”. [71] In the same case, in addition to taking over the examination of witnesses ― for forty minutes at a stretch in one instance, justice Dugré went on the following rant, which the CJC soberly describes as “shar[ing] his views on alcoholism with a witness on the stand\n\nBecause a lot of people drink two bottles of wine a day, one at noon, one in the evening, are perfectly, they aren’t alcoholics at all, because they like wine, and they really like it. And after all, lunch goes on for three hours, and supper goes on for three hours. So, there’s five glasses, in a bottle of wine, so there’s, we’re two people, that makes two glasses, four glasses. Fine. They had two bottles of wine. That’s nothing. But a guy who has one glass of wine, he gets totally enraged, and all that, but he has to be careful, he can’t touch that, he’s not allowed. Because he gets totally crazy. So, that’s what alcoholism is. [71]\n\nTo which one is sorely tempted to say, go home, my Lord, you’re drunk. The CJC doesn’t put it in so many words, but its conclusion is to the same effect: Justice Dugré’s “behaviour in belittling parties and counsel, making inappropriate and offensive comments and not permitting parties an opportunity to present their case, are all sufficient to ground a finding of judicial misconduct”. [82] Again, no disagreement from me on this one.\n\nBefore ending this sorry tale, a word on Justice Dugré’s response to the CJC process. Assuming the report provides a fair account of his arguments (and I have no reason not to assume this), they consisted very largely of procedural quibbles about the manner in which his conduct was investigated and considered. This is of a piece with Justice Dugré’s repeated attempts to stop the investigation in its tracks by filing multiple judicial review applications, which resulted in three increasingly terse dismissals by the Federal Court of Appeal, and two dismissed applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nOf course, a judge investigated by the CJC is entitled to procedural fairness, but there is something unseemly in the extreme when this entitlement is used in an attempt to avoid a conclusion on the merits, instead of to ensure a fair consideration of the case, which there seems to be no reason to think Justice Dugré was denied. I have no problem with a person accused of a crime trying to “get off on a technicality”. But when a public officeholder’s fitness for office is in question, I think decency requires him or her to see to it that a decision on the merits is reached, so long as the process affords him or her a full opportunity to make his or her case. Justice Dugré, for his part, chose not to testify. The CJC is careful to note that no adverse inference should be drawn from this, but from a moral rather than a legal standpoint, I think this is bad form at the very least.\n\nSo while Justice Dugré will now have the opportunity to commence yet another judicial review, I can only hope he does not take it. This is pretty much his last chance to leave a job for which, for whatever reason, he turned out to be utterly unsuited with at least a modicum of good grace. He should have gone long ago. He must do it now. Now.\n\nI recently wrote a post that was sharply critical of the appointment of Justice Michelle O’Bonsawin to the Supreme Court of Canada. The National Post then ran a slightly modified version of it as an op-ed. Rob Breakenridge also interviewed me on my views. Somewhat to my surprise, the responses that have reached me were, on the whole, more supportive than not. While the public reaction to Justice O’Bonsawin’s appointment is almost uniformly positive (except for my post and op-ed, the only other sustained criticism came in The Line‘s editorial, which is more proof that you should subscribe to them), in reality there is a good deal of disappointment, some of it very bitter indeed, within and beyond the Canadian legal community.\n\nThat said, of course, quite a few people were also unpersuaded, or worse, by what I have had to say. I don’t think I have seen anyone attempt to rebut my argument to the effect that, considering the limitations of her career so far and the shallowness of the responses on her government questionnaire Justice O’Bonsawin lacks either the accomplishments or the intellectual excellence to be a Supreme Court judge. Instead, what has been put forward is any number of reasons why either my arguments or I should simply be ignored. In this post, I quickly respond to them, in rough descending order of seriousness and good faith.\n\nYou’re not impressed now, but Justice O’Bonsawin could still turn out to be great!\n\nThis is true, of course. She could. I’m not optimistic as to the likelihood of this, but I’ll be happy to be proven wrong. That said, I don’t think this is a good response to my criticism of Justice O’Bonsawin’s appointment. It’s a bit like saying that buying a lottery ticket is a good idea because one might end up winning. One might, but the odds are bad enough that it’s still an irresponsible decision. And while I’m content to stipulate that Justice O’Bonsawin’s odds of turning out to be a reasonably good Supreme Court judge (not everyone needs to be great!) are better than those of getting a winning lottery ticket, the cost of a bad choice is also rather more than just a few dollars. Justice O’Bonsawin could hold office for more than a quarter of a century. If she turns out to be a dud, c’est long longtemps as Quebeckers say. Appointments to the Supreme Court are not trifles to gamble with.\n\nAnd, by the way, it is always important to remember the opportunity costs of decisions: appointing Justice O’Bonsawin means, among other things, not appointing some other, better qualified judge now. Realistically, it may also mean not appointing a better qualified Indigenous judge to the Supreme Court in the near or medium-term future; at the very least, the pressure for such an appointment will now be much less than it would have been otherwise. True, we’ll never hear about these unmade appointments. But the unseen is no less important than the seen.\n\nYou’re making too much of a silly questionnaire; it’s no basis to assess a future judge!\n\nThere’s something to this too. Justice Rowe turned out not to be the “judge unbound” I had expected him to be based on his questionnaire. Clearly, the method of predicting future judicial performance based on this has serious limitations. But while that may be a good argument against relying on it with respect to most appointments, Justice O’Bonsawin’s case is exceptional in that the questionnaire is well-nigh all that we can judge her appointment on. What is more, it is well-nigh all that that the government that appointed her had at its disposal. Unsurprisingly given the shortness of her career on the bench, Justice O’Bonsawin has written few judgments of importance ― few enough that she listed her PhD as one the top five pieces of writing, and that thesis has been hidden from public view. (By the way: I think some people have made too much of this; I wouldn’t expect to find some sort of smoking gun there; it’s probably boring; but having mentioned it as being one of her most significant outputs, Justice O’Bonsawin should not have kept it secret.) She has no academic publications. Her career as an in-house lawyer was also not the sort that leaves a record that lends itself to serious assessment. If we also ignore the questionnaire, we must conclude she is a cypher. Well, I don’t think cyphers are fit for appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nAdmittedly, some people might disagree.\n\nWe shouldn’t even try assessing a newly-appointed judge! Let’s see how their career turns out and pass judgment once they retire.\n\nFirst, I think it’s worth noting that this argument, which would have applied to every judicial appointment ever, seems to be brand new. Perhaps I have missed it being made in the past ― I’d be grateful if someone pointed me to previous examples ― but anyway I daresay it was not a common one. On the contrary, people were quite happy to criticize, for example, the appointments of Justice Brown to the Supreme Court and of Justices Huscroft and Miller to the Ontario Court of Appeal. People were also happy to praise the appointments of, say, Justice Jamal and indeed that of Justice O’Bonsawin to the Supreme Court, and if it’s too soon to criticize a new judicial appointment, then surely it is also too soon to praise it. I add that the government itself is obviously keen to take credit for its judicial appointments: it evidently doesn’t think that they cannot be assessed until long after it is out of office.\n\nThat said, to be sure, an argument isn’t wrong just because it’s new and convenient. But the claim that judicial appointments can only be criticized (or praised) retrospectively is simply wrong on the merits. Courts, and especially the Supreme Court, exercise considerable power. (Richard Albert has suggested that the Supreme Court of Canada might be the most powerful court in the world. Whether or not he is quite right about this, it is surely a very powerful institution.) At the same time, courts are ― by design, and rightly ― not meaningfully accountable for the exercise of their authority. It is, then, very important that the decisions as to whom to appoint to the bench, especially the Supreme Court, be made with a degree of thoughtfulness proportionate to its importance, and that these decisions be subject to meaningful accountability. Criticism of bad appointments, just like praise of good ones, is not only permissible but essential to ensure the government of the day takes this responsibility with all the required seriousness.\n\nAre you saying only appellate judges/judges who have served on both trial and appellate courts should be appointed to the Supreme Court?\n\nI said no such thing (and indeed I specifically got the Post to drop a proposed edit that might have carried that implication), but quite a few people seem to have concluded that I did. So, in case this clarification is useful, no I don’t think there’s a specific amount or sort of judicial, or indeed any other, experience that is mandatory for a future Supreme Court judge. Some of the smartest and most interesting judges in recent decades were appointed directly from the bar ― namely, Justices Sopinka, Binnie, and Côté. An appointment from a trial court is unusual (Beverley McLachlin was the Chief Justice of British Columbia’s Supreme Court, a trial court, when appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, but she had served on the BC Court of Appeal before). But if a Supreme Court judge can lack any judicial experience at all, then having only trial court experience should be no obstacle. What one would want to see in appointee is a track record of excellence ― whether in practice, in the academy, on the bench, or in some mix of these ― and indications of some degree of brilliance. Again, there’s no one right route to this. Justice O’Bonsawin’s record, however, falls far short of what one would expect on the Supreme Court.\n\nNot that this matters, according to some people. Now we’re getting into really silly territory.\n\nLegal skills/qualifications are irrelevant anyway!\n\nThis too, I think, is a novel argument. And also a bad one. Even on the view that the law often “runs out” and decisions in hard cases have to rely on judges’ moral sense ― not by any means an uncontroversial view, and one of which I am sceptical (at least in this far-reaching form) but a widespread one ― judicial decision-making has to start with the law, even if it turns out that it cannot end there. If we aspire to anything like a government of laws rather than unaccountable personal rule, we should expect and demand that judges be skilful lawyers, whatever else they might also need to be.\n\nYou’re undermining confidence in the Supreme Court!\n\nSure I am. A Supreme Court one of whose members is not qualified for membership and should not have been appointed deserves less confidence than a court of which this is not true. That was the whole point of the litigation around the appointment of Justice Nadon ― another one which plenty of people thought it was permissible to criticize, by the way, including due to the perceived insufficiency of his credentials (which, whatever one makes of them, were considerably stronger than Justice O’Bonsawin). There is no question that Justice O’Bonsawin’s appointment is legal and constitutional. But, as I said in my original post, it is bad for Canada’s legal system all the same, and nothing requires me or anyone else to be an ostrich about it.\n\nYou’re racist/sexist!\n\nWe all knew this one coming, didn’t we? Criticizing the appointment of an Indigenous woman to the Supreme Court is, by itself, conclusive evidence of racism and/or sexism in some quarters of what is sometimes mistaken for polite society. Suffice it to say that attacks on, say, a John McWhorter or a J.K. Rowling from the same quarters are not held to be evidence of racism or sexism. The “principle” on which this sort of response to my post is based is just partisan horseshit. Like Pierre Trudeau, I’ve been called worse things by better people.\n\nI think this about covers it. I should say, though, that there was less real horseshit than I had expected. Perhaps people had already decided that I am too much of a heretic to bother about. Perhaps they are quietly taking notes and not telling me. Either way, I suppose I will not be welcome in the “polite society” whence such accusations originate. That’s as well. I have as little time for it as it has for me.\n\nI remain unpersuaded by the responses to my take on Justice O’Bonsawin’s appointment. She is not Supreme Court material, and should not be sitting on that court. And by the way, my saying so is no slight on her personally. There’s nothing wrong with not being Supreme Court material. Most lawyers aren’t. Probably even most judges, let alone most judges who have only spent five years on the bench. One can be a fine person and even a fine judge without this. But appointing someone who is not Supreme Court material to a role for which she is not qualified is a grave fault. We’re hearing much about whether this or that politician will undermine Canadian institutions. Sadly, the Prime Minister’s and the Justice Minister’s choice of Justice O’Bonsawin does just that.\n\nLast week, the Canadian government announced the appointment of Justice Michelle O’Bonsawin of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to the Supreme Court. As I had done after the appointment of Justice Rowe, I have read the questionnaire in which she explains her views on her career, diversity, and the role of the Supreme Court and its judges. It brings to mind the notorious argument Roman Hruska, a US Senator from Nebraska, made on behalf of the nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the US Supreme Court: “Even if he were mediocre, there are a lot of mediocre judges and people and lawyers. They are entitled to a little representation, aren’t they, and a little chance? We can’t have all Brandeises, Frankfurters and Cardozos.” Justice O’Bonsawin, I am afraid, is also no Cardozo, and no Frankfurter either, for better and for worse.\n\nNothing in particular qualifies Justice O’Bonsawin for the Supreme Court. She had a seemingly ordinary career as in-house counsel, first at Canada post and then as General Counsel at the Royal Ottawa Health Care Group. I presume she has done good work there ― especially in relation to mental health, with which she seems to have been much concerned, given the nature of her job ― but it is not the stuff of stardom. She has been a Superior Court judge for five years and claims that she has “developed significant knowledge and expertise in our three areas of work: criminal, family and civil litigation”. So, presumably, does any other Superior Court judge, to say nothing of those on the Court of Appeal. Remarkably, Justice O’Bonsawin lists her PhD, for which she did most of the work while on the bench ― and which she has made inaccessible to the public! ―, among the “most significant cases or matters that [she] dealt with while in legal practice or as a judge”. Perhaps I am blasé, but this strikes me as a bit pathetic as a qualification for the Supreme Court, though of course, as Justice O’Bonsawin notes, getting it done while also having a demanding day job is a testament to her work ethic and commitment.\n\nJustice O’Bonsawin’s answer to the question about her “insight into the variety and diversity of Canadians and their unique perspectives” is perhaps the most interesting one of the whole questionnaire, albeit for what it says about the “diversity” discourse more than about her. Tellingly, Justice O’Bonsawin speaks more about her various identities ― “as a francophone First Nations woman, a parent, a lawyer, a scholar and a judge” ― than about “the variety and diversity of Canadians”. I’m not criticizing Justice O’Bonsawin here. Of course a single person’s experience of “the variety and diversity of” soon-to-be 40 million people is limited. But her answers hold up a mirror to the way that diversity talk is usually more about oneself than it is about the diversity of one’s fellow-citizens. Another characteristic point: back when she was first applying to the bench, Justice O’Bonsawin simply said that she had grown up off-reserve. Now, she speaks of “[t]he colonial separation of my family from my First Nation”. To me this feels rote rather than heartfelt. But again, that’s what the diversity discourse requires.\n\nThat said, to her credit, Justice O’Bonsawin isn’t entirely down with the programme. She writes that “[a]s Canadians, we must stop focusing on our differences and embrace diversity in order to move our country forward in a progressive manner”. While this ― like much else in Justice O’Bonsawin’s answers ― is more about the feeling than the meaning, the idea that embrace of diversity is compatible with, and even requires, a little less narcissism of small differences is a pretty good feeling to have.\n\nSadly, I have little positive to say about Justice O’Bonsawin’s answers about the role of judges and of the Supreme Court. While they are banal, and no more “unbound”, to use the word I’d applied Justice Rowe, than might be expected of a generic judge appointed by the Liberal government, they are remarkably shallow. A very average first-year law student might have written something quite similar, and received a very average grade for the effort. This applies, by the way, to Justice O’Bonsawin’s writing style (and indeed grammar), though as I said about Justice Rowe, one should not be judged too harshly on the prose with which one fills a government form.\n\nThe first sentence sets the tone. The soon-to-be Supreme Court judge informs us that “The role of a judge in a constitutional democracy requires them to always apply impartiality, act independently and with integrity, and remain cognizant of the pillars of the Constitution and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms”. I’m not sure how one “applies impartiality”, or what “the pillars of the constitution and the Canadian Charter” are. I’m also not sure whether Justice O’Bonsawin actually thinks the constitution and the Charter are two different things ― this is by no means the only place in her questionnaire where she uses this sort of phrasing.\n\nAnother puzzler, from a bit later on: Justice O’Bonsawin writes that “[t]here is a fine balance between constitutional and legislative powers”. Does she mean constitutional rights (she might, because that’s what she is talking about just before). Or some kind of powers that aren’t about legislation? And another one, from the discussion of the Supreme Court’s relationship with its various “audiences”: “Decisions from the Supreme Court of Canada guide litigants through the legal system. This guidance must assure litigants proceed with legal claims well founded in fact and the law.” How can guidance from on high provide this assurance? Does Justice O’Bonsawin mean that it must help litigants formulate sound claims? That would be a sensible thought, but one can only hope that Justice O’Bonsawin’s opinions will be clearer than this, if indeed they are to guide anyone.\n\nLet me now discuss some substantive issues that arise from Justice O’Bonsawin’s answers. First, her thoughts on the constitution. She explains that “[a] judge must continuously interpret the Constitution as a living and breathing document that is reflective of the beliefs and aspirations of generations since its original implementation.” I don’t know what a “breathing document is” ― by my lights, a living one is ghoulish enough, but that’s a minority view. But even apart from that, I’m not sure, about this “generations since” business. What if the “beliefs and aspirations” of the generations that have succeeded one another since 1982, never mind 1867, are not in agreement? Justice O’Bonsawin adds that “[t]he Constitution should not be used as an impediment to individual rights”. Does that mean that when the constitution doesn’t protect a right it ought to be ignored and the right be given “benediction”, Justice Abella-style, by the courts? Conversely, when the “generations since” the constitution’s enactment aspire to impede individual rights ― as they do on a pretty regular basis, which is precisely why rights are protected by constitutions placed out of majoritarian reach ― should judges give way to their views?\n\nThe issue of the judge’s relationship with public opinion arises more broadly throughout Justice O’Bonsawin’s answers ― and she tries very hard to have it both ways. On the one hand, “a judge must remain independent from influence or pressure”. On the other ― in the very next paragraph ―, “[a] recurring and oft heard criticism of the judiciary is that judges are out of touch. In an ever-changing climate, a judge must adapt to respond to these changes.” We are not told what changes exactly judges must adapt to, but telling the judges to evolve with the zeitgeist is not so easy to reconcile with their remaining independent from external influence. On the one hand, Supreme Court judges “do not react strategically to external political pressures”. On the other ― in the very next sentence ―, the reason for not reacting strategically is that “[t]his maintains the legitimacy of the Supreme Court of Canada’s standing and its decisions”. Is this not a strategic consideration? The worst of it is that I am pretty sure Justice O’Bonswain isn’t being sneaky ― I really don’t think she realises what a maze of self-contradiction her answers are.\n\nOne more beat on the issue of external influences. Justice O’Bonsawin warns that “[a] constitutional democracy will face threats, not only from within its borders, but also from abroad which is further facilitated with social media.” This would have been music to the government’s ears, what with its worries about foreign interference, and bodes ill for the prospects of Justice O’Bonsawin standing up its ongoing attempts to censor online communications. Justice O’Bonsawin adds that “[b]eliefs in other areas of the world should not influence or affect how our Constitution is interpreted and applied to all Canadians, absent the pressure of external forces”. Again I don’t know what to make of the last bit ― should beliefs in other parts of the world influence how the constitution is interpreted if external forces are exerted? Let’s just pretend it’s not there. The idea that the courts should pay little or no attention to “beliefs in other areas of the world” is in line with recent Supreme Court decisions such as Quebec (Attorney General) v 9147-0732 Québec inc, 2020 SCC 32, though not with the open-minded self-image that is dear to many Canadian lawyers. But then, Justice O’Bonsawin explains that Canada “must strive to be a beacon for others as to how a constitutional democracy should be protected and fairly applied to all”. So Canadian judges ought not to be influenced by foreign thought, but those foreigners will be oh-so-lucky to learn from us. This too is not new. The majority in Frank v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 1, [2019] 1 SCR 3 took just this approach. I didn’t like it then, and I don’t like now.\n\nLastly, let me return to the issue of rights. What does Justice O’Bonsawin have in mind? She specifically mentions equality, which she explains “is not treating everyone the same but treating everyone with fairness and equity taking their differences into account”. As it happens, I recently urged students to drop the word “fairness” from their vocabulary, because it means nothing in particular and tends either to hide a lack of thought given to the subject or to paper over disagreement. Justice O’Bonsawin, who is a prolific user of the f-word, should do the same. Alongside equality, she also mentions language rights, specifically s 16 of the Charter. And that’s it. Freedom of religion? Freedom of expression? Presumption of innocence? Not that one should necessarily expect a would-be Supreme Court judge to name-check every Charter right in their questionnaire, but the exclusive focus on equality is sadly characteristic of a certain kind of thinking about the law that strikes me as quite impoverished.\n\nThere would be still more to say, but none of it more positive than what I have already said. Let me quote just one more passage:\n\nCharter values, such as substantive equality, dignity, fairness and human rights, are beacons for a Supreme Court of Canada Justice’s reasoning. Respecting these values support the public interest in ensuring all Canadians are treated fairly and equally for all rights protected and shared by all. They ensure national equality before the law, which is a core value of our judicial system.\n\nAgain, some of it plain silly ― Charter values include human rights! Some, incomprehensible ― national equality before the law? Is that equality before the law with Canadian characteristics? None of it is interesting or thoughtful.\n\nI repeat my verdict: Justice O’Bonsawin is a very average lawyer who is out of her depth when it comes to the big-picture questions that a Supreme Court judge is forced ― by no means in every case, but with some regularity ― to turn his or her mind to. I’m sure she is a good and well-meaning person; she may, for all I know, have been a competent trial judge; but neither her career nor her thinking come close to qualifying her for the Supreme Court. Her appointment is transparently political, and it does a disservice to the Court that will have to welcome her, and to the Rule of Law in Canada."
