        "text": "Perhaps the least self-evident right of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen was that of \" resistance to oppression. \" Emerging from the Anglo-American rights tradition as a check on corrupt power, the term was adapted by the marquis de Lafayette for French politics in his Declaration of Rights proposed on July 11, 1789. Following the Bastille's fall and the contestations of the early to mid-Revolution, resistance to oppression would come to suggest a general right to protest against measures violating human rights. Indeed, the revised 1793 Declaration of Rights enshrined insurrection as \" the most sacred of duties \" (le plus saint des devoirs). Yet in the Constitution of the Year III, the right of resistance would be eliminated entirely. Based upon a broad reading of debates in the National Assemblies and printed public sphere, this article examines how revolutionaries attempted to grapple with both the possibilities and limitations of protest as they attempted to construct a democratic regime.\n\nThough recent scholars have argued that no self-defining ‘bourgeois’ identities existed during the French Revolution, such perspectives do not consider the pivotal role Milice bourgeoise forces played in the Bastille insurrection and France’s broader social upheavals of mid-1789. Combatting perceived lower-class disorder, explicitly ‘bourgeois’ units composed of propertied citydwellers mobilized to seize control of and direct the central uprisings that made the Revolution. In Paris, the motley insurgents of July 12 were forcibly disarmed the next day by a militia hastily organized through the city’s former Third Estate voting districts, which moved first against lower-class disorder instead of the royal forces menacing the city. Following the Bastille’s fall, in municipal revolutions across France such units formed the basis for the new National Guard, which thereafter possessed exclusive policing rights. Based upon a wide reading of participant and observer accounts from the early Revolution, this article attempts to explain the role of socially exclusionary identities in motivating collective action in 1789. The French became revolutionary not through a unified uprising of ‘the people,’ but rather under the aegis of a socially exclusive and self-definably ‘bourgeois’ force.\n\nThis dissertation is a philosophical investigation into the concept of sovereignty as well as a historical investigation of the struggles of the French Revolution, analyzed from the perspective of sovereignty. It is argued that any conception of sovereignty, im- or explicitly, contains ideas and practices pertaining to the economic structure of society, political institutions, conceptions of rights, conceptions of citizenship, and spaces of politics understood as sites for sovereign political decision-making. Thus, unlike what is argued by philosophers such as Giorgio Agamben, it is demonstrated how conceptions of sovereignty cannot be completely separated from conceptions of government and practical political arrangements. If a certain subject is, or is to be, sovereign, it cannot govern in whatever way and still remain sovereign. It is furthermore argued that a given author’s or practitioners conception of sovereignty is ultimately disclosed in his or her political practice, or indication of political practice. This is to say that any analysis of a given theorist’s conception of sovereignty cannot rely solely on his or her rhetoric, but must also include the actual political practices entailed in this position. Throughout the dissertation I demonstrate how the concrete political position of a given author can only be identified by analyzing the specific function of his or her individual texts, that is, how it is meant to intervene in a given political situation (what I, following Louis Althusser, have called ‘the conjuncture’). Thus, I criticize the tendency in much existing research on the political theories of French revolutionaries to abstracting, too severely, these theories from the concrete struggles of the French Revolution. My argument is not that one has to reduce the political theories of French revolutionaries to the conjuncture of the French Revolution. On the opposite, my aim is precisely to abstract, what I call, ‘doctrines of sovereignty’ from the French revolutionary context. But it is my argument that this abstraction must be based on a systematic contextualization and de-contextualization of French revolutionary political theory in relation to the specific and ever-changing conjuncture of the French Revolution. The concrete analyses of French revolutionary political theory in relation to the French revolutionary conjuncture shows that the struggles of the French Revolution can ultimately be broken down to struggles between four competing doctrines of sovereignty: corporate sovereignty and absolutist sovereignty pertaining particularly to the political struggles of the old regime between (local) nobles and the royal court, and national sovereignty and popular sovereignty that enter the political scene with the advent of the French Revolution and which come to structure the struggles of the French Revolution. It is demonstrated that whereas the early parts of the Revolution (1789-92) can be understood mainly as a struggle against the old forms of sovereignty, the struggles of the later part of the Revolution (1792-94) are essentially struggles between proponents of national sovereignty and popular sovereignty."
