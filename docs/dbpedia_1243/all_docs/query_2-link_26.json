Based in Wilmington, Mass. with regional offices in the U.K., Japan and China, Agfa Monotype specialized in fonts and font technologies for graphic professionals, software developers and manufacturers of printers and display devices. The company also provided print drivers and imaging technologies to OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).\n\nAgfa Monotype was a wholly owned subsidiary of Agfa Corp. based in Ridgefield Park, N.J. and was part of Agfa's Graphic Systems business unit. Agfa was the U.S. subsidiary of the Agfa-Gevaert Group, one of the world's leading imaging companies. Agfa developed, produced and marketed analog and digital systems primarily for the graphic imaging, healthcare, micrographic, consumer desktop, motion picture and photography markets. Headquartered in Mortsel, Belgium, Agfa had 40 national sales organizations globally, with worldwide sales of 4.215 billion euros in 2003. It had a 7000+ font collection in its Agfa Creative Alliance.\n\nAfter Agfa joined forces with (in fact, absorbed) Monotype, Agfa acquired ITC in March 2000. In 2003, Agfa Monotype acquired Faces Ltd., a typeface distributor in the U.K.\n\nDesigner profiles. History of the company by Lawrence W. Wallis (dead link).

Bye Bye Blackbird performed by Phil Martin in Largo, Florida.\n\nThe final message on his last web page, posted posthumously read: MARTIN, PHIL, 82, of Largo, died Tuesday (Oct. 4, 2005) at Largo Medical Center. He was born in Dallas and came here after retiring as a writer, singer-songwriter, commercial artist, and comedian. As a high school student, he worked as an assistant artist on the nationally syndicated Ella Cinders, and at 18 wrote and drew Swing Sisson, the Battling Band Leader, for Feature Comics. He was an Army Air Forces veteran of World War II, where he served as a bombardier in Lintz, Austria. On his 28th mission shelling the yards in Lintz, his B-24 was hit and he was listed as missing in action until the war in Europe ended. He was a comedian on The Early Birds Show on WFAA in Dallas. As a commercial artist, he founded two multinational corporations to market typeface designs and is credited for designing 4 percent of all typefaces now used. He also wrote columns and articles for typographic publications. Locally, he sang original lyrics to old pop standards in area piano bars, and in 1999 produced 59 issues of the Web book Millennium Memorandum, changing the title to MM2000 when he issued the first edition of the new Millennium on Jan. 3, 2000.

They were the dominant foundry in America until 1933, when ATF went bankrupt. Its collection remains intact at the American Type Founders Company Library&Museum at Columbia University in New York. The Smithsonian possesses most of the original type drawings and many of the matrices, and a number of other institutions and private individuals own matrices.

Its founders are Steve Matteson (type designer, formerly with Agfa/Monotype), Thomas Rickner (of Microsoft fame, where he hinted many Microsoft families), Ira Mirochnick (founder and President of Monotype Typography Inc in 1989 (where he was until 2000) and a Senior Vice President and director of Agfa Monotype Corporation (2000-2003), a self-proclaimed expert in font licensing issues and IP protection), and Bill Davis (most recently the Vice President of Marketing for Agfa Monotype). Also included in this group are Josh Hadley, Brian Kraimer, Jim Ford (since 2005), and Jeff Finger (as Chief Research Scientist, since 2006). On December 8, 2010, Ascender was acquired by Monotype for 10.2 million dollars.\n\nTheir typefaces include Endurance (2004, Steve Matteson, an \"industrial strength\" Grotesk designed to compete with Helvetica and Arial; it supports Greek, Cyrillic and East European languages).\n\nIn April 2005, Ascender announced that it would start selling the Microsoft font collection, which is possibly their most popular collection to date. They also started selling and licensing IBM's Heisei family of Japanese fonts in April 2005: Heisei Kaku Gothic, Heisei Maru Gothic and Heisei Mincho. Ascender's version of the CJK font Heiti is called ASC Heiti.

St. John Hornby]\n\nFounded in 1895 at Ashendene, Hertfordshire, England, by Sir C. H. St. John Hornby and moved in 1899 to Chelsea, London. It was a leader (with the Kelmscott Press and the Doves Press) in the 19th-century revival of fine English printing. Its edition of Dante (1909) is considered an achievement comparable to the Kelmscott Chaucer of William Morris. The Subiaco type used by the Ashendene Press was designed by Sir Emery Walker and S. C. Cockerell from an early Italian typeface. The Ashendene Press, which set all of its editions by hand, issued 40 books in the years from 1895 to 1915 and from 1920 to 1935.\n\nPtolemy was designed in Chelsea by St John Hornby, Sidney Cockerell and Emery Walker, and was cut in 18 pt by Edward Prince for Cervantes's Don Quixote, which was published by the Ashendene Press in 1927. The type used until 1935 was a revival of Lienhart Holle's cut for Ptolemaeus's Cosmographia printed in 1482 in Ulm. Ptolemy in turn was digitally revived in 2019 by Alexis Faudot and Rafael Ribas in 2019.\n\nThe Subiaco type (1902) is now owned by Cambridge University Press. Its punches were cut by E.P. Prince. It is a humanist typeface with blackletter tendencies, and is based on the first roman used in Italy for printing, developed around 1464 at Subiaco by Conrad Sweynheym and Arnold Pannartz.\n\nThe Ashendene Press disappeared in 1936.

Bronx, NY, 1946, d.2007), the founder of BA Graphics in 1994, was a prolific American type designer. With 33 years of experience at NewYork's Photo Lettering, he specialized in calligraphic script typefaces, but not exclusively so. BA Graphics was located in Chester, NY, and later in Toms River, NJ, and now sells its fonts through MyFonts. Many of its fonts published after Alonso's death in 2007 were completed by John Bomparte.\n\nJohn Bomparte wrote this obituary: Throughout his career at the legendary Photo-Lettering, Inc. (one that spanned four decades), Bob created original typefaces and tailored type by modifying, revising and filling out families, fashioning pieces of type for hand-lettered jobs, as well as being involved with the updating of a number of well-known logotypes. Bob was blessed with natural teaching abilities; and those in social and professional circles who had the good fortune to know him considered him not just a type designer but a mentor and a friend. As one such person close to him put it, he was a graphic technician [...] back when computers were not even in site for graphic arts, he would take on any intricate&complex graphic project that others would shy away from and come up with a solution that achieved a masterpiece. I'll always remember someone saying \"this can't be done\" and Bob saying let me see it and a short time later, there it was---done&perfect. I would like to think that attitude rubbed off on me. Along with this gift for teaching and explaining the complex, Bob exhibited a level of professionalism that was unsurpassed. A number of years ago when the need came to make the transition from the traditional to digital way of creating fonts, he rose to the challenge admirably. Towards the last few years of Photo-Lettering, Bob played a vital role in the conversion to digital, of many of the typefaces within the collection, notably those fonts that carry the prefix PL. More recently, Bob Alonso released several fonts through ITC, Adobe and his independent foundry, BA Graphics. Bob was on the cutting edge of his best work, and in the circumstance of his untimely passing, left a measure of unfinished designs. However, the spirit of his typographic talents and his fine sense of humor lives on through the many much-loved, and popular fonts he has left us: fonts such as Cookie Dough, Equate, Elephant Bells and Pink Mouse, to name a few.\n\nAlonso created these typefaces:\n\nAlex (1996).

Berthold, which folded in 1993, had a 2000+ type collection, which came in the hands of Freydank, Körbis, Pillich, Talke GbR in 1996 who lent it out to Berthold PrePress GmbH in 1997 under the name The Berthold Type Collection. Babylon Schrift Kontor GmbH, the company of Klaus Bartels, offered type 1 fonts from this collection for sale since 2000, but it disappeared some time later when Bartels died. BERTLib acquired the original Ikarus data of the Berthold Type Collection (over 2000 fonts) and set out to make high quality OpenType fonts with full support of all European languages, and fully Unicode-compliant. Slowly, these fonts are now being released by BERTLib. Not to be confused with Berthold Types Ltd from Chicago, who produced its library from Berthold type 1 data, not Ikarus data, of the same collection. Because of typename protection by Berthold Types, BERTLib had to change some font names. Some fonts also cover Cyrillic and Greek, but Maltese and Turkish are standard in all typefaces. More research needs to be done about the Berthold bankruptcy in 1993. They had a lot of debts. How can two different companies \"acquire\" or \"get\" the rights and sources of their collection? Who took care of the debts? Were there some underhanded deals? BERTLib twice refused to send me a list of types to which their own names can be matched. No names of digitizers or font BERTLib font designers or BERTLib owners are given. And finally, one has to pay 2.50 Euros just to see a sample of a font. All that makes me think that this company is one of businessmen rather than passionate type designers.

Not without controversy, though, as many claim that the original digital collection was an illegal copy of Linotype fonts [Note: I disagree with that statement--take out \"illegal\"]. In 1999, Bitstream created MyFonts.com, a web site for finding, trying, and buying fonts on line. Bitstream was headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and led dfior some time by CEO Anne Chagnon.\n\nBitstream wrote on the origins of the collection: The Bitstream Typeface Library was developed under the supervision of Matthew Carter, the creator of such esteemed typefaces as ITC Galliard; Snell, Bitstream Charter and Swiss Compressed. Carter, who also serves as Bitstream's Senior Vice President of Design, set uncommonly high standards for the company's highly-skilled design staff. Working from the earliest-generation artwork available, each character of every typeface is hand-digitized on advanced workstations specially programmed by Bitstream's engineers. In building the library, Carter has overseen the licensing of typefaces from such respected international sources as the International Typeface Corporation (ITC), Kingsley-ATF Type Corporation, and Fundicion Tipografica Neufville SA, among others. Bitstream also develops new and original designs. Many countries provide for the legal protection of typeface names only, not the designs themselves. This means that the original names of many typefaces can only be used with a license from the owner. The majority of Bitstream typefaces in this catalog have licensed names (on which royalties are paid), or have historical names that reside in the public domain, or have names to which Bitstream owns the rights. In these cases, the name is used. When the original name is not available for use by Bitstream, an alternative name appears. For example, Swiss 721 is the name that Bitstream uses for its version of the typeface popularly known as Helvetica? Because the original name of that typeface is not widely licensed, there are many offerings of the design with completely different names. It is important to note that the use of an alternative name has no bearing on the inherent quality or authenticity of the typeface design.\n\nBitstream sold a nice 500-font CD for 39 USD around 1996, with all the great text families. This was a fantastic buy, as proved by this quote from John Hudson: I have said it before and I will say it again: I think the development of the original Bitstream library was one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type, and it has set the tone for the disrespect for type shown today. (A bit of background: Bitstream asked Linotype if they could digitize Linotype's library of fonts. Linotype refused, but Bitstream went ahead anyway.) On this issue, read these pages by Ulrich Stiehl and Typophile.\n\nBitstream was offering a 250-font CD. Type Odyssey Font CD (2001). Bitstream has added Greek, Cyrillic, OldStyle versions to many of its families.\n\nNew releases in July 2001: Artane Elongated, Cavalero, Drescher Grotesk BT, FM Falling Leaves Moon, FM Rustling Branches Moon, Picayune Intelligence (by Nick Curtis), Raven, Richfont, Rina, Sissy Boy, Stingwire, Tannarin. In November 2001, Serious Magic entered into a long-term agreement to license 25 Bitstream outline fonts for its new visual communication products.\n\nBitstream has been an exemplary corporate citizen, occasionally producing license-free fonts for the masses, such as their Vera collection.\n\nBitstream's own overstated blurb about itself: Bitstream Inc. (NASDAQ: BITS) is a software development company that makes communications compelling. Bitstream enables customers worldwide to render high-quality text, browse the Web on wireless devices, select from the largest collection of fonts online, and customize documents over the Internet. Its core competencies include fonts and font technology, browsing technology, and publishing technology.\n\nFinally, together with its spin-off, MyFonts, Bitstream was sold to Monotype Imaging in 2011.\n\nCatalog of typefaces [large web page warning].

In 2007, the following BP fonts saw the light: Neutral BP (Kai Bernau, a supposedly neutral sans family), La Police BP, Romain BP and Romain BP Headline (as the creator, Ian Parry, states: Based on the Commission Jeaugeon's models and on Philippe Grandjean's classic character, the Romain BP celebrates the marriage of geometric rationality and elegance, of science and craftsmanship. The Romain BP Text is actually closer to the Commission's model than Grandjean's Romain du Roi. It is more synthetic in its structure, more radical, and thus, more modern. It is a contemporary text typeface based on a structure that was created in 1690, not a revival mimicking Greandjean's shapes.). In 2007, they released Esquire, an upright script headline face. Other fonts are listed on my site under the various designers' names.\n\nIN 2013, the type foundry morphed into Swiss Typefaces, which is jointly run by Ian Party and Emmanuel Rey.

These were marketed as Fluent Laser Fonts (FLF) out of Carmel, CA.\n\nThe FLF series includes Abilene (Western), Alexandria (1986, slab serif family), Black Knight (1991, blackletter), Bodoni FLF (1986), BodoniUltra (1986, a fat didone), Bonnard (art nouveau), ButtonHighlight, ButtonPlain, Calligraphy (1986), Campanile (a great didone face), Checkbox, Chicago FLF (free at OFL), Collegiate (1988, sports lettering), Coventry Script (calligraphic), Cutouts FLF (1992, cargo stencil), Desperado, Dorovar Carolus (1988, Carolingian; see also D790 at Softmaker and Carolingia (1991, William Boyd)), DryGulch, Epoque (art nouveau), FattiPatti, Fletcher Gothic (1992, art nouveau), Galileo (1987, didone), Gazelle (1988, calligraphic script), Gatsby (1986, pure art deco), Giotto, Gregorian (1986, English Gothic style blackletter), Harlequin FLF (1990), Highland Gothic (1992), Jott, Kasse (1992), Kells (modern round Gaelic font, 1988), KeyCaps, La Peruta, Meath (modern round Gaelic font, 1988), Michelle (1992, art deco, marquee face), Micro, MicroExtend FLF (1986, like Microgramma), Monterey (1986, Peignotian), Moulin Rouge (1992, an art nouveau typeface by Richard A.

The contact was Terry Kunysz in Salinas, CA.\n\nOn July 3, 2003, Casady&Greene closed it doors permanently. However, one of its designers, Mike Wright, writes: I believe that all the fonts that were developed by the company are now in the public domain. Robin Casady and I are thinking of putting up a site with free downloads of all of the old C&G public domain fonts--mainly as a way of attracting Mac users to see iData 2.\n\nRobin Casady in 2003: I founded Casady Company in 1984 to publish fonts for the new Macintosh. The name changed with incorporation to CasadyWare, Inc. Around this time I met Mike Greene who was looking for a software project to do after SpellsWell. I talked him into doing a program that became QuickDEX. Later CasadyWare, Inc. merged with Greene, Inc. and became Casady & Greene, Inc. Over the years, my role in management reduced as my interests in other areas developed. In the last ten years I have had no official management duties at C&G.

The timeline:\n\nFounded in 1960 in Brookline, MA, by Bill Garth and Ellis Hanson (Chief Engineer of Photon, Inc). The intention was to apply computer technology to typesetting. The company would go on to influence the world of photocomposing with its low cost typesetters.\n\nIn 1963, the company relocates to Reading, MA, and introduces its Linasec I and II, the first general typesetting computers.\n\nIn 1967, the company relocates to Wilmingon, MA, forms a Type Group and an engineering department, and releases its first typeface, Bodoni.\n\nIn 1968, Compugraphic introduces the phototypesetters CG 2961 and CG 4961. In 1969, the 7200 Headliner machine (the first keyboard-operated machine to set headlines and display type) was added, followed, in 1970, by the Area Composition Machine (ACM) 9000, in 1971 by the CompuWriter machines, in 1973 by the VideoSetter I and II, in 1974 by Unified Compuser and ExecuWriter, in 1975 by UniScan and UniSetter, and in 1977 by the EditWriter 7500, the Mini-Disk Terminal, and the Mini-Disk Reader..\n\nThe first typeface exclusively developed by Compugraphic, is released, Holland Seminar. It was created by Hollis Holland in 1973.\n\n1974: The purchase of T. J. Lyons Press, gives Compugraphic the rights to nearly 2,500 old and antique typefaces.\n\nIn 1981 Agfa bought 51% of Compugraphic, increased that to 80% in 1983 and finally they merged outright in 1989. The new company name is Agfa Corporation.\n\nIn the late eighties, they proposed the scalable format FAIS as an alternative for type 1 and truetype. This format did not survive long.\n\nIn 1992 Miles, Inc (Pittsburgh, PA) bought Agfa/CG. In 1995 Miles changed name to Bayer Corporation. Agfa is the imaging division of this comnpany.\n\nFinally, in 1999 Agfa (after acquiring Monotype in '97) became independent of Bayer. They now own the ITC catalog (and, by virtue of that, the former Esselte/Letraset font catalog too) as well as the others they picked up through the years.\n\nMyFonts sells Garth Graphic (Compugraphic, and now Agfa/Monotype, by Constance Blanchard and Renee le Winter, based on earlier sketches of John Matt, 1979) and Phenix American (Agfa-Monotype), and named in honor of Bill Garth.

Beginning in 1927 Continental also distributed typefaces cast by Frederic Goudy, and two typefaces for Doug McMurtrie. Doug McMurtie and Frederic Goudy were the vice-presidents in 1925 and 1927, respectively. At first Goudy's type was cast at his own Village Letter Foundry, but after 1929 these were cast by the New England Foundry. Despite imports being virtually cut-off during the war years, Continental was still issuing Goudy's types as late as 1944 and may have continued functioning even later. Located at 216 E. 45th street, New York around 1930. They published Specimen Book of Continental Types in 1929. Cary collected 2300 books about printing. After his death, the Cary Collection was presented to the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1969 by the Mary Flagler Cary Charitable Trust as a memorial to Melbert Cary.

Other related companies or company names include ColorSpan and Lasermaster. The quote below is from an ex-employee.\n\nThe original DTC was not truly a type foundry, but rather a division of LaserMaster Corporation based in Eden Prairie, MN. LaserMaster was started in 1985 by Mel Masters (Melvin Newsom) and Lawrence Lukis (the tech guy) whose mission was to bring true WYSIWYG technology to the computer world. Their product was a circuit board that was inserted into the computer's existing system along with a laser printer that housed the same technology. It allowed the computer to accurately display, in high resolution (not bitmapped as the computers of the time), and output equally well. To ensure that the hardware performed as promised, they started with a package of 35 fonts including what they considered essentials such as Avant Garde and Goudy (see attached pdf).\n\nWhile the technology worked as promised, the fonts they bundled with it were not quality. They were purchasing all of their raw data from URW, and originally, they did nothing to improve or enhance them aside from improving their onscreen appearance with a proprietary PC program built to alter only the bitmapped portion of the two-part postscript fonts of the day. It allowed custom bitmapping and hinting of the typefaces, but did nothing to the font's outlines or metrics (spacing/kerning). As such, when included in a review of typeface manufacturers, they received a very poor rating.\n\nThey realized if the fonts were to be a major selling point of their product, it would benefit them to create a team of typographers. DTC was established in the late 80s, but still lacked dedicated supervision and quality control. I was the one hired as Senior Typeface Designer in early 1990. They had just released their first 100 font package and were working on the second. My primary job responsibilities included the design of missing characters (all of the fonts had to have a full 256-glyph complement) and quality control. I spent literally hours upon hours scanning through print outs of each font at varying sizes printed by different manufacturer's printers, pointing out inconsistencies and calling for spacing/kerning adjustments. This lead to the developments of some rules for quality outlines that all designers employed there were required to follow.\n\nWe produced the second 100-font set and were getting ready to decide on what was to be contained in the next set when a major shift in the industry happened, the development of TrueType. To help use make the transition into producing fonts in this new format, they brought in one of the designers from Bitstream (Adobe and Bitstream were the major players of the day) to teach us what was different about the process and how it is rendered and how to produce quality TrueType fonts.\n\nAs training was going on, we received a request for a large 1000-font package from a software manufacturer that wanted to include a hand-picked set of fonts to be bundled with their software. We were never told who the client was, as the software was still in the development phase, but we worked diligently to finish the package within their specified timeframe. Shortly after we completed the project in mid-1991, we were informed that LaserMaster was dissolving DTC. With the advent of TrueType, their dedicated boards and technology were no longer required to get WYSIWYG performance. Sales were declining rapidly and the company made a huge shift into the large format printer field abandoning the type division completely.\n\nI am not certain how or when ProFonts obtained the DTC fonts, but I suspect the URW relationship had something to do with it, since ProFonts has a strong relationship to URW. As far as I know, there was absolutely no connection between DTC in the US and DTC in Hungary.

They had type based on Jenson. Thomas J. Cobden-Sanderson threw the typefaces in the Thames when the press closed in 1916 to prevent anyone from using it again. Ben Archer writes: although William Morris's Golden Type predated this design, it is thought that the Doves Type was more faithful to the design of the original Venetian type of the fifteenth century. Punches were cut by Edward Prince on the instructions of Walker and Cobden Sanderson in a single size and weight only, and used for printing the Doves Press edition of the Bible. This celebrated type was used privately for sixteen years and never released to the general trade. It was lost to history forever when Cobden Sanderson threw the entire font into the Thames river, provoking a bitter argument with his business partner, the master printer Emery Walker.\n\nCobden-Sanderson was born in 1840 in Alnwick, Northumberland, and died in London in 1922.\n\nDigital revivals:\n\nDoves Press Type (1994, Torbjörn Olsson).

Established in 1984, the foundry had 1300 fonts by 2012.\n\nThe font designer and owner was Edward Detyna, who died in March 2014. People are reporting to me that the fonts are in limbo, and that Detyna's family is not replying to requests for information.\n\nOn July 4, 2002, Apostrophe wrote this: I'm currently having a difficult time trying to predict the past of EFF LondonA, EFF Liz, EFF Eric and EFF Formal, to name a few. I have a feeling that these folks just happen to be twins with entities that are currently across the Atlantic from them, namely Adobe Garamond, Cooper Black, Gill Sans and Copperplate Gothic. A friend of Detyna's writes this: When I met him at least twenty years ago, Edward and his associates had a font design studio based in Ascot, near London. He is a mathematician/statistician turned typographer, and was really on top of type design at the time. There are academic articles published on mathematical subjects on the internet. He's an old man now, but still a very smart guy. When he started, with fonts for Acorn RISC-OS (now defunct, but leading-edge British computer of mid-eighties to -nineties), he had very advanced and sophisticated algorithms for anti-aliasing and hinting, and his hand-hinting is still better than almost any other fonts I have used for screen work. He still sells fonts and adapts to user requirements promptly. I recently asked him to adjust the hinting on a font and he turns it around in a day.\n\nJason Koxvold wrote to me in 2017: I knew Edward back in 1990 or so, when I was 13, and he mentored me to a great degree. For a while I worked an internship of sorts at EFF, and then one day, my mother came to see what I was up to---he gave her the job of office manager. He was a tremendously helpful and meaningful person to me then as a very young man with a passion for typography.\n\nClosed captioning fonts for TV, made according to the EIA 708-B specifications, include EFF Sans Serif CC, EFF Serif CC, EFF Sans Serif Mono CC, EFF Serif Mono CC, EFF Casual CC, EFF Script CC, EFF Small Caps CC.\n\nEFF also has fonts for Vietnamese, Greek, Hebrew, and Cyrillic.\n\nEFF Primary is a large family of educational fonts.\n\nEFF Utamaru is an oriental simulation font.
