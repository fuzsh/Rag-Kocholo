MONTREAL: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1934. 11 RED JOHN CAPTURES FEATURE AT LAUREL Earns Close Decision in Renewal of Nanticoke Stakes at Maryland Track TWO CLOSE DECISIONS Spectators and Officials Disagree on Placing of Horses in Steeplechase Event (By The Associated Press.) Laurel, October finishes that were so close that many booed the judges and the success of well backed horses featured the next to last card of the meeting here this afternoon .\n\nOne of the results that caused disagreement was that in the Nanticoke, Red John, representing J. D. mile and tor chief attraction Hertz, was awarded purse over the Shandon Farm's Ashen. P. M .\n\nWalker's Sang Froid, slight choice over the $6.40 winner, lost the place by a length. The time was 1.42 1-5. Ashen, hustled into early command by Wayne Wright, set a fast pace, followed by Sang Froid and Greyglade. The latter stopped half way home but the favorite held on until near the finish line. Silvio Coucci brought Red John from last place, saving ground at stretch turn .\n\nThe grey colt, on the inside. fought it out with Ashen in the final strides. Ashen bore out slightly right at end, a factor that contributed defeat. then Curly headed, baby faced Carl Hanford, riding like his more illustrious brother Buddy, stole some of feature thunder for himself when he rang up his third success of the day astride Triolet in the seventh race. In rounding his triple, the little apprentice rated his mount within striking distance of the leaders, urged Triolet to the front after entering the stretch and sat still as the $8.90 for two shot drew off to by five lengths from Brilliant Rose .\n\nTightwad was a close third, with the favorite Sun Abbot, a fagged out fourth. Considerable booing followed the judges' decision in the steeplechase in which Royal was awarded the verdict over Brad. The latter was well backed, while the winner returned $55.50 for a two dollar straight ticket. Lavisby was a distanced third. Help Me went to the front and had the race cinched to all appearances but he met mishap at the last jump .\n\nLassitude second. also well up, fell and the issue was left to Brad and the long shot that caught the judges' eye. Carl Hanford rode his second winner of the day and his 13th of the meeting when Pretty paying $5, proved best of the platers in the fourth. Carl sent mount to the fore before reaching the stretch and the colt held Kindacorn safe to register handiiv by a length.

The applause and cheers with which the brilliant burlesque, \"Union Pacific\" and the \"Prince Igor\" dances were greeted, made up in part for what ought to have been but unhappily was not, a crowded house. The principal virtue about Col. de Basil's troupe is its magnificent ensemble. This applies not only to the personnel of the company but also to the choreography, the settings and the costuming of each ballet .\n\nIn the case of \"Union Pacific\" it applies to the carrying out virtuosity of a brilvalso liant idea. So far as the dancers are concerned, their characteristic lies in their development of movement to a point at which it joins hands with that rhythm which underlies all art worthy of the name. A Monte Carlo ballet, judging by what was seen last night, never stops once it has begun. Your interest is held without your being aware of it. The movement comes not only from the action of the dancers but also from the scene and its brilliant and varied coloring .\n\n\"Union Pacific\" was the item which held most interest for last night's audience although the Polovtsien dances from Borodin's \"Prince Igor\" ran the former very closely. \"Union Pacific\" is the creation of Leonide Massine who has inserted a single solo dance for himself into it (the only time he appeared last night). The programme of this ballet is a burlesque on the construction of the first transcontinental railroad on the American continent which was completed by rival groups of capitalists in the year 1869. Half of it was laid by Irishmen, the other half by Chinese. The ballet ends with the rival capitalists meeting in friendly accord .\n\nthe workers rejoicing, and the camp followers mourning that the good days of their trade are over. A handy photographer catches everyone in characteristic pose. MASSINE'S COMIC DANCE. The whole thing is motion from beginning to end; the kind of thing the moving pictures might have developed into if they had not talked. Pantomimically, the audience is shown the Irishmen laying sleepers, the Chinese driving home the rails .\n\nThe sleepers are members of the company, the rails of tho Chinese are invisible. Then there is a scene in the big tent where the tired workers take their ease with dancing girls. The overseers of the rival companies fight for the possession of the prettiest of these girls. Massine as the barman does a comic dance with extraordinary fantasy and energy. Tamara Toumanova, who has earned great fame on this continent since her first appearance last year, is a lively Mexican girl .\n\nThe thing is alive with rhythm and color. The settings by Albert Johnson are highly original burlesques in colonial landscape. The music by Nicolas Nabokoff makes use of American popular songs of the middle of the last century. They are treated in a sheerly satirical fashion and, in the writer's opinion, very amusingly and cleverly. The orchestration is crude and loud but the subject calls for it .\n\n\"PRINCE IGOR\" THRILL The dancers from \"Prince Igor\" provide another thrill. The scene is a Tartar camp, beautifully painted by Nicolas Roerich designed the settings for Stokowski's production of \"Sacre Odalisques dance for the benefit of fierce Tartar warriors and stir them to fever heat. There are abductions, and so forth. A primitive bow dance is performed by the said warriors. The whole thing transports you to another world .\n\nYurek Shabalevsky might have stepped out of the pages of Moussorgsky's \"Khovantchina\" or from the \"Thousand and One Nights.\" He was the chief warrior. A cruel, lusty being. The charming Chopin ballet, \"Les Sylphides\" opened the programme. It was given here last year, it will be remembered. While it was difficult to recapture the first thrill, the piece is always worth seeing .\n\nThe foregoing is merely a description of a few of the highlights of the Monte Carlo Ballet's show. To enjoy it one must see it. Let it be said in conclusion that it is the first great show of the season. Efrem Kurtz and Antal Durati lead the orchestra In' adequate fashion. This evening, \"Boutiques Fantasques\" and \"Contes Russes' will be given for the first time, and \"Union Pacific\" will be repeated .\n\nT.

VERDUN SITUATION STILL UNCHANGED One Thousand Heads of Unemployed Families Meet and Sign Petition SEEK GOVERNMENT AID Packed Hall Listens Speeches for Three Hours, With Mayor Ferland at Helm Nearly 1,000 heads of unemployed families in Verdun, assembled at a public meeting held in the City Hall last night, approved by an overwhelming majority of a resolution petitioning the federal and provincial Governments to jointly administer direct relief in the west: end suburb after November 1 \"under such terms conditions as the Dominion and provincial authorities may impose in these matters.\" The adoption of the resolution followed a lengthy review of the municipality's a plight, and copies immediately despatched by telegram to the Rt .\n\nHon. R. B. Bennett, Prime Minister of the Dominion; Hon. W .\n\nA. Gordon, Minister of Labor in the federal Cabinet; Hon. A. Taschereau, Premier of Quebec; and Hon. J .\n\nN. Francoeur, provincial Minister of Public Works. It pointed out that 2,233 heads of families, or approximately 10.000 men, women and children, are now on relief, that the city is without funds to provide this relief after November 1, and that deprivation of the dole would result in untold misery and suffering, and constitute a serious menace to public health. A packed hall listened, for nearly three hours, to speeches delivered by Mayor Herve Ferland, Lyon W. Jacobs, K.C., P .\n\nA. Lafleur, M.L.A. for Verdun, Alderman Wermenlinger, E. J. Leduc .\n\nwho represented the proprietors, and several others. Neither Georges P. Laurin, M.P. for Jacques Cartier, nor John A. Sullivan, K.C., M.P .\n\nfor St. Ann, whom, the mayor said, had been invited to the meeting, were in attendance. Elsewhere, it was stated that Mr. Sullivan, for one, had received no official invitation to be present. CITY BROKE--NO BLUFF .\n\nMayor Ferland declared that it was his intention to see Premier Taschereau -this at the local offices of the Provincial Government, but added: \"We are broke. There is no bluff about it.\" Amounts due from the two Governments for expenditures during August and September might be received today, he admitted, but this sum and much more--a total of owed to the banks on account of loans and could not be used to continue the administration of direct relief. The mayor closed his remarks by announcing that relief cheques for Wednesday and Thursday would be issued today, and that those for Friday and Saturday would go out tomorrow. Furthermore, each family would receive an allotment of wood for fuel. All work .\n\nwhich had been required in for relief, will cease after tomorrow, he. added, and the of the Verdun Unemployment Commission will be! closed Thursday, and thereafter. Lyon W. Jacobs, K.C., self-styled \"friend of the unemployed\" and \"unofficial public defender of Verdun,\" complimented the jobless for their law-abiding and orderly attitude in the face of trying difficulties. P .\n\nA. Lafleur, M.L.A. for Verdun, and an ex that municipality, said that from personal observationi, and from newspapers, what he he agreed had with the mayor that Verdun could carry on with relief no longer. But being a member of the Opposition at Quebec, he was afraid he could not do much at the present time. Besides Mayor Ferland and Aldthe Verdun City Council present at ermen p .\n\nWermenlinger, members of the meeting were Aldermen Camille Dansereau and Paul Lalonde. BUSINESS PARLEYS URGED Skinner Thinks Businessmen Should Confer Ottawa, October practical solution of intra-Empire trade arrangements by Empire conferences of businessmen was advocated by Sir Hewitt Skinner, in an interview here today. Sir Hewitt, now on a visit to Canada, is president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce of Great Britain. The Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference, he believed had set up the ideal for intra-Empire commerce and businessmen could best determine how those ideals could be carried out. Conferences could be arranged through various Chambers of Commerce Domthine inions and colonies .\n\nIt was explained that in many cases the small Canadian trader was not sufficiently aware of English market requirements, and another difficulty was that Canadian unxiety to sell certain of her goods, such as wheat, often interfered with British foreign investment. He said although Great was desirous of buying Canadian wheat, she had vast sums invested in the Argentine which must pay interest. Problems such as he believed, could be worked out by conferences of the businessmen immediately concerned.

TWO HURT IN ACCIDENT Pedestrian and Passenger in Truck Sent to Hospital Walking behind a horse-drawn vehicle travelling east along St. Patrick street, Ville Emard, early last evening, Francois Rozon, 54 years of age, of 5325 Notre Dame street west, was knocked down to the pavement when struck by a motor truck ling in the same direction. Rozon was the St .\n\nLuke pital suffering from head injuries and an X-ray will be taken this morning to ascertain whether he suffered a fracture of the skull. The accident was investigated by Sergeant Miller, and Constables Murray and Brodeur, of the Ville Emard police station. A young girl, 15-year-old Anita Jiovanni, of 2435 Allard street, was also reported to have been injured in the mishap. The girl was travelling in the truck and when the driver, Willie Laurion, of 5236 St. Ambroise, swerved and swiftly applied the brakes to avoid striking the pedestrian, the vehicle overturned and the girl suffered an injured shoulder .\n\nShe went home first and later was taken to the Western Division of the Montreal General Hospital for treatment. PARLIAMENT SITS TODAY IN LONDON Heavy Programme House Reconvening After Summer Holiday (Canadian Press and Associated Press Cables.) London, October 29. A heavy programme of important social, economic and political legislation, headed by the vital problem of home rule in India, faces Parliament, which reconvenes tomorrow after the summer holiday to wind up the affairs of the old session and prepare for state opening of the new by the King late in November. The Cabinet met today to put the finishing touches on the policies it will present, but consideration of the report on India is ly to be postponed, along with most of the other important issues, until the new session. Tomorrow begins the tag-end of the third session of the 36th Parliament since the Union Act of 1801, and it is expected to occupy itself principally with cleaning up the work that was interrupted by the summer holidays .\n\nThe Labor party will again be headed by the veteran George Lansbury, who has made an excellent recovery of his strength after suffering a fractured thigh. Measures for increasing the Empire's defences will be discussed early in the session. The first step in the bigger defence programme was taken before the summer recess when the Government arnounced its intention of expanding the Royal Air Force. British export trade in armaments will be attacked in several ways and at least one demand will be made for an inquiry by a special commission. Slum clearance will be an important subject .\n\nA few forms of aid for the unemployed are certain to be discussed but no specific programme has yet been drawn up. The Government's methods for assisting agriculture will probably cause a sharp clash, as will two highly controversial bills now pending, the incitement to disaffection bill and the betting and lotteries bill. The first of these would give the Government extensive powers in dealing with revolutionary propaganda, strengthening the present laws greatly.

Feels Stevens' Resignation Condemns Bennett Regime SINCERITY CHALLENGED Proof Positive That Prime Minister Never Intended Inquiry to Do Anything, He Charges The double resignation of Hon .\n\nH. Stevens as Minister of Trade and Commerce and as chairman of the mass buying and price spreads committee is a \"complete and formal condemnation of the Bennett Government by one who was one of its staunchest supporters, and proof positive that the Prime Minister never intended the inquiry to accomplish anything remedial,\" in the judgment of Hon. Fernand Rinfret, former Secretary. State and ex-mayor real. In an address to La Reforme Liberale at 4245 St .\n\nAndre last night, the Liberal ex-minister street, flung the Stevens resignation into the teeth of the Government as chaltense, to \"because its the sincerity, people and have demand- the right,\" to know \"who are the big financiers or what are the big companies that got after Mr. Bennett to secure the resignation?\" With Mr. Stevens, who was the guiding hand of the inquiry, now no longer at the head, the a committee continues its sittings \"without force, without significance.\" said Mr. Rinfret. And when the Parliament reconvenes and Mr .\n\nStevens takes his place as a member on the floor of the House, the session will be \"one of the most sensational ever held.\" he promised. The inquiry revealed \"monopolistic control of merchandising and prices dangerous to the country, and especially dangerous in these trying times,\" said Mr. Rinfret. If the purpose of the inquiry was to uncover abuse, if such existed. and suggest remedial legislation .\n\nwhy, asked Mr. Rinfret. should Mr. Stevens as a minister of the Crown be forced to withdraw for doing his duty and acting conformity with the object of the inquiry?\" When returned to power, the exminister promised, the Liberal party will carry on the Investigations of the committee and adopt measures to end the abuses which have been revealed. The action of Prime Minister in squelching the Stevens' pamphlet and securing its author's resignation has once more shown to be an autocrat of the dictatorial type now common in Europe, Mr .\n\nRinfret thought, and conclusively spikes the rumor that the next government in Canada will be a coalition one. \"For,\" said he, \"if the Prime Minister cannot agree with one of his cabinet ministers how can he possibly be expected to get along with those of other political views?\" CHOICE BY INDIVIDUAL. Disagreeing with Camillien Houde that the Mayor, dian is fit only return to the land,\" Major Anatole DRe Plante, M.L.A. for Mercier, in his first public utterance since the mayoralty campaign told the audience that Premier L. A .\n\nTaschereau recognizes of the unemployed do not possess an aptitude for farming, and it is the desire of the Provincial Government SO to solve the unemployment situation that Montreal will be able to keep some of its are skilled in trades or occupations. Farmers and sons of farmers should return to the land, Major Plante thought. It would be better for them and for the province. But the Government had no intention of plucking them out of the cities into the country; it was a matter of their own choosing.
