        "text": "My favorite Christmas story is A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens. Every year I watch or read some version of this classic tale. Last week, I began wondering if there might be a similarly cherished, yuletide parable from France. I tracked down a dozen acclaimed stories, including two by Molière, but they just didn’t pack the same punch. Then it occurred to me to pilfer the stacks of French Canada and voilà, I struck gold. Le Phantôme de l’Avare, or The Miser’s Ghost, is a wonderful cautionary tale, written by Honoré Beaugrand near the end of the 19th century.\n\nBelow you’ll find Beaugrand’s original text alongside my English translation, illustrated with acclaimed portrayals of French Canada.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHonoré Beaugrand was born in 1848 in Saint-Joseph-de-Lanoraie, Quebec, a small parish situated along the Saint Lawrence River between Montréal and Trois-Rivières. At the age of 17, he left Canada for Mexico where he joined a French battalion fighting for the ill-fated Mexican emperor. When the war ended, he traveled to France, then moved to New Orleans where he took up journalism. After a decade of working for newspapers in the United States, Beaugrand returned to Canada. Over the course of his life, he founded a handful of successful journals and became a wealthy man.\n\nA free-thinking Republican, Beaugrand involved himself in the political issues of his day and served as mayor of Montréal in the mid-1880s. Interestingly, one of the issues about which he felt strongly was mandatory vaccination for smallpox. His heightened interest in public health may have been due to his own weakened constitution. Beaugrand suffered from asthma throughout his life and retreated from politics in his early 40s. He spent his final years traveling the world and writing, dying in 1906 at the age of 58.\n\nOther Resources"
