        "text": "This essay traces the change in focus from beur literature in the 1980s to urban literature in the 1990s onwards. Whereas beur literature showed characters torn between their original culture and their adopted culture, urban literature presents characters claiming and asserting their belonging to France and refusing to be confined to racist stereotypes. Relying on a collection of short stories entitled Chroniques d’une société annoncée published in 2005 by a group of writers named Qui Fait la France?, Puig shows how the short stories give fresh and different representations of people living in the banlieue.\n\nThis article deals with the emergence of crime fiction in the Second French Empire during the reign of Napoleon III. This article focuses on components which have enabled the birth of the genre. The emergence of crime fiction matches with several societal changes, such as a new social fascination for criminal figures relayed by a new cheap press, the evolution of police structures or the emergence of a leisure society. Those changes inspired writers, giving them materials to create of this new literary subgenre. It will also focus on new crime fiction’s structures developed by Edgar Allan Poe, then followed and developed by writers from France such as Emile Gaboriau, structures which reverse some usual patterns, allowing crime fiction to become a real independent genre.\n\nThe narrator/writer of Gail Scott’s novel My Paris (1999) finds herself in an overdetermined urban space of contemporary Paris. The space, already multiply written and rich in cultural associations, is re-worked again in the fragmented „diary,” in which the narrator both echoes and contests her literary guides, primarily Gertrude Stein’s work and Walter Benjamin’s Arcades Project. Her Paris emerges as a re-citation of the Paris inscribed in those and other texts, reconfigured from a perspective marked by temporal remove, which is stressed in the novel. Scott explores multiple, criss-crossing spaces of the city: those of architecture, culture, race, gender, nationality. While the text’s concern is to move to and fro “across comma of difference,” and to avoid binary oppositions without obliterating the all-important comma, it politicizes its postmodern concerns. The article explores the postcolonial dimension of Scott’s novel, which, though not necessarily foregrounded, provides an important conceptual thread of the text. The narrator, a bilingual Québécoise, considers spaces of alterity and otherness of Paris, explicitely relating them to Canadian national experience. From this perspective the enticement and impossibility of the unitary construct of a nation symbolized by the republics of France and the United States are explored. The postcolonial reflection is closely related to the notion of a non-unitary, nomad subject that emerges from the novel."
