During a recent in-season tournament game between the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns, Warriors' head coach Steve Kerr displayed his characteristic wry sense of humor.

When sideline reporter Jorge Sedano mentioned a point made by analyst Richard Jefferson, Kerr amusingly replied that he hadn't heard of Jefferson.

"Your Arizona Wildcat brethren Richard Jefferson said you were upset in the under-six timeout about the defense at the rim particularly. What do you have to say to him?" Sedano asked.

Kerr trolls Jefferson

Despite an impressive comeback, the Golden State Warriors suffered a 123-115 loss to the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.

"I'm sorry, who was this guy you're talking about? Richard who?" Kerr replied.

"I've never heard of him."

The Warriors rallied from an early 23-point deficit and managed to narrow the gap to 118-115 with just 19 seconds remaining in the game.

However, Devin Booker sealed the victory for the Suns by making two free throws, preventing the Warriors from completing their comeback in the final moments of the game.

This playful interaction adds to Kerr's history of trolling Jefferson. In a previous incident during an April game, Kerr refused to speak to Jefferson and, instead, requested to talk to play-by-play voice Dave Pasch, who also worked with Jefferson for Wednesday's game.
