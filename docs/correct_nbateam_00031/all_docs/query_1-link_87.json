        "text": "Yahoo!’s Marc Spears reports the Spurs and Warriors have finalized a deal that will send Richard Jefferson to Golden State for Stephen Jackson. Spears adds that the Spurs will also send their 2012 first round draft pick to Golden State. Jackson was with the Spurs from 2001-2003 and was part of the 2003 title team.\n\nThe story first broke about an hour before the NBA trade deadline, when ESPN’s Ric Bucher reported the Spurs and Warriors are discussing trading Richard Jefferson for a familiar face.\n\n“Source: RJefferson for SJackson being discussed.”\n\nJackson was just traded from Milwaukee to Golden State as part of the Monta Ellis-Andrw Bogut swap. Jackson and Jefferson make roughly the same money, with Cap’n Jack having only this year and next remaining on his contract. Jackson is averaging ten points, three assists and three rebounds. When you look at their production, both guys are pretty equal and Jackson’s shooting percentages are actually really bad. But he’s aggressive and still a pretty good defender. He also has a very good relationship with Coach Popovich, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. The deadline is 2 PM San Antonio time. Check back then to see if any other goes down."
