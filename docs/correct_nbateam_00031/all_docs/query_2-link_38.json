        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. — From the moment the Cavs began scheming to play the Warriors, the answer to who would guard Kevin Durant never changed. It always was and was going to be LeBron James.\n\nThe Cavs were at their best defensively when James guarded Draymond Green last year, but the addition of Durant to the Warriors erased that option. James guarded Durant on Christmas and again on Martin Luther King Day at Oracle Arena. He was the primary defender on him to open these Finals, when the Cavs fell in a deep 0-3 hole and were forced to try something different.\n\nSo Tyronn Lue began listening to Richard Jefferson, who has been asking for months to guard Durant.\n\n“Fucking begging for it,” Jefferson told The Athletic. “I’ve been begging for it.”\n\n‌‌‌ Lue ignored him early, but has trusted Jefferson with more minutes and more responsibilities as this series has progressed. He played about 15 minutes in each of the first three games, when Durant made 4-of-6 shots with Jefferson guarding him. Lue increased Jefferson to 22 minutes in Game 4 and assigned him the task of guarding Durant.\n\nDurant missed six of his seven shots while Jefferson was guarding him.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 16 years. I can do things. And the more you give me a little bit of an opportunity, the more you give me a little bit more of a leash, I can contribute,” Jefferson told The Athletic. “The best thing Ty did is he gave me a leash.”\n\nIf the Cavs can somehow rally against the Warriors yet again, part of the reason for it might be Lue’s subtle decision to change James’ defensive responsibilities.\n\nJefferson doesn’t believe he is a Durant stopper. Far from it. At 36 now and in his 16th season, Jefferson realizes his best days are behind him. But he also knows that the Cavs ask too much of James, that no other team in the league relies on one player to do so much – all while playing nearly the entire game. That was never more evident than the closing minutes of Game 3, when James and Kyrie Irving were too exhausted to close out a win against the Warriors. After James was gassed at the end of Game is when Lue made the decision to use Jefferson more in Game 4.\n\n“It takes pressure off of Bron. If I don’t score a point and I make it difficult on (Durant) for 20 minutes, then it’s a successful night,” Jefferson told The Athletic. “But to make Bron be in that position and say, ‘We need you to guard maybe the second-best scorer on the planet and then we need you to facilitate everybody and go get 10 or 12 assists and we need you to go score 30? It’s unfair. It’s unfair.”\n\nJames scored 39 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and passed for nine assists in Game 3 while playing 46 minutes. But the Warriors caught the Cavs in the final minutes, which is all that is separating this from being a tied series. Instead, the Cavs are back in a familiar 3-1 hole.\n\nThe offseason may have already started, however, if Lue didn’t trust Jefferson to guard Durant. That has allowed the Cavs to again use James on Green, who has struggled badly all series offensively, and James is back to freelancing defensively and playing free safety just as he did during the first three rounds of the playoffs.\n\nHe can leave Green to double both Durant and Steph Curry at times and he is the best communicator defensively. Using him this way allows him to talk more and help everyone else.\n\n“You have to give great scorers different looks,” James said. “If you give K.D. and Steph a steady diet of the same guy every single possession, then they’re going to figure it out.”\n\nOf course, it comes with risks. Green has missed an alarming number of open shots the last few games and if he catches fire while the Cavs are helping off him, the series probably ends Monday night. Until that happens, however, Lue may have found something in Jefferson that he’s comfortable using again in Monday’s pivotal Game 5.\n\nJames will guard Durant at the start of the game again as usual, but Jefferson will likely take over once he checks in. He’s giving up inches to Durant and he’s not as athletic, but he’s physical, he gets into his chest defensively and keeping his arms in the air. One Cavs teammate called it the “Delly defense” in honor of the way Matthew Dellavedova annoyed opponents by constantly waving his arms in the air.\n\n“He’s done a great job,” Lue said of Jefferson. “(Durant) is going to score. Fuck, he’s the best scorer in the world. I just think his physicality, taking the challenge into his body, I think he’s been great.”\n\nJefferson understands that Durant could erupt at any moment and score 50 regardless of who is guarding him. Playing it this way, however, is allowing James to conserve more energy on the defensive end so he can accomplish everything the Cavs need him to do offensively.\n\nJefferson got this idea from his first Finals appearance, when he was a second-year forward on the New Jersey Nets and their star guard, Jason Kidd, was struggling to defend Spurs guard Tony Parker while maintaining everything the Nets relied on him for offensively. So coach Byron Scott switched up the assignments and used Kerry Kittles on Parker. Kidd switched to Bruce Bowen defensively.\n\n“It allowed him to rest defensively and then it was like he was shot out of a cannon when he had the ball,” Jefferson said. “You know what I’m saying? This game is never going to change. There’s always going to be things that you can do. It’s not that LeBron doesn’t want to guard his position, it’s just what he’s being asked to do, to do it at the highest rate. Especially if he’s going to play 44 minutes a night.”\n\nA number of Cavs players have privately been aggravated with all the talk during these Finals about Durant passing James as the game’s best player. Jefferson is part of that group that believes James still reigns supreme. He just help in certain instances. That’s what he’s trying to provide.\n\n“You can say Draymond (Green) is a two-way player, but Draymond doesn’t have to score 30 and give you 10 assists and guard the best player the entire game,” Jefferson said. “Kawhi (Leonard) doesn’t have to score 30 points a game. Kawhi’s career high in assists is eight. Go Google it. His career high is eight because he’s part of a great, great high-level system.\n\n“Kawhi is one of the five best players, Draymond might be the Defensive Player of the Year. But there’s one best player in basketball. There’s one. That’s it. That doesn’t mean KD can’t go have 50 on me. It just means that it’s unfair to put LeBron in that position.”"
