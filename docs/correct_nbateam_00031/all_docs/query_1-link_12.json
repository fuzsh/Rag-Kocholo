        "text": "Occasionally, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander takes to Instagram to celebrate a win or big moment with creative captions. In the biggest win of the season yet over the Golden State Warriors, he continued this tradition.\n\nIn the Oklahoma City Thunder’s overtime win, the All-NBA guard collected 40 points, seven rebounds and six assists. This included 10 points in OT to secure the road victory.\n\nIn his latest Instagram post, he captioned it by saying “I was feeling like e-40 in the Bay, so i had to go dumbbbbb”\n\nThroughout the 10-photo/video slideshow, sharp eyes noticed that several slides featured plays where Gilgeous-Alexander humiliated Steph Curry on the court.\n\nSome have interpreted this as Gilgeous-Alexander taking a subtle shot against Curry following a season-defining win. After this was spotted, the IG post took over social media and trended.\n\nWhen discussing the Instagram post, ESPN analyst Richard Jefferson challenged the Warriors to respond on NBA Today.\n\n“Shai challenged the entire Golden State Warrior organization. He challenged their entire fanbase. He challenged everything in their existence. That’s what he’s saying,” Jefferson said. “…Make no mistake that these were direct shots and so now we get to sit back instead of saying, ‘Well…’, — no, these were direct shots at the Golden State Warriors. Their team, their organization and their fanbase. What are you gonna do about it?”\n\nThe Warriors might have to stay patient in order to respond to Gilgeous-Alexander’s post-win trash talk. The Thunder won the season series, 2-1 after taking both games at Chase Center.\n\nUnless they meet in the playoffs or play-in tournament, the next time Curry and the Warriors can play Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder will be next season."
