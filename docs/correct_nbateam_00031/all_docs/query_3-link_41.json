Why Magic Johnson is the greatest Laker ever (according to RJ), how Michael Jordan changed the NBA for everyone, RJ reflects on his New Jersey Nets teams, why he despises The New York Knicks, how he got into broadcasting, reflecting on just how dominant LeBron James was in the 2016 NBA Finals against Stephen Curry and The Golden State Warriors, how he evolved his game by becoming a 3-point shooter, why The Denver Nuggets have the most pressure on then to win the NBA Championship this year, why he's picking The Milwaukee Bucks to win it all and so much more.
