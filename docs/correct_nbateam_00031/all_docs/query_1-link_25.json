        "text": "Q: And how about your college teammate Luke Walton? Richard Jefferson: The luckiest man alive? Oh, yeah, Luke. No, man [laughing], good for Luke. People look at it like, ‘Oh, he’s this, he’s that, he’s so lucky.’ I’m like, ‘Yes, he is lucky, but part of luck is preparing yourself and being a good person.’ When you look at his situation, the Lakers wanted him to come, because he took a year off [from playing] and he had been working with their D-League staff. Phil Jackson wanted him to come and help with Derek Fisher. And obviously there’s his relationship with Steve [Kerr]. So it was like, this dude took a year off and had the Lakers, the Knicks and Golden State calling him. So that just shows pretty much his character, how people respected his basketball mind and his knowledge of the game. So, as much as he is lucky, he was able to look at the situations and pick the best one and it excelled and now he is the interim head coach for the Golden State Warriors. Jesus. I told him he’s going to have to hire me.\n\nIt didn’t take Luke Walton long to win his 2nd championship of the summer — this time in beach volleyball … and his teammates included Richard Jefferson and Matt Leinart. The former NFL and NBA players were part of Team Fletch … which won the coveted Six Man title in Manhattan Beach, CA this weekend. Two awesome things about the victory: First, the former pro athletes mostly rode the bench. Beach volleyball is serious biz in MB!"
