        "text": "Richard Jefferson isn’t hanging ‘em up just yet.\n\nThe 37-year-old announced on his podcast that he will be returning to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017-18 for what will be his 17th season in the NBA.\n\n“I will be starting my 17th season next year, I am not retiring,” he said.\n\nThe former Arizona Wildcat averaged 5.7 points per game in 20.4 minutes in a bench role for the Cavaliers this past season, as they fell to Steve Kerr’s Golden State Warriors in the 2017 NBA Finals.\n\nAfter Jefferson won a title with the Cavaliers in 2016, he informally said he would be retiring, but he backed away from that claim 72 hours later and signed a three-year deal the Cavaliers.\n\nJefferson is set to earn $2.5 million in 2017-18.\n\nGiven that the final year of his three-year contract is non-guaranteed, it does seem there’s a good chance that the 2017-18 season will be his last.\n\nJefferson has played for seven NBA teams, spending most of his career with the New Jersey Nets, who drafted him out of Arizona in 2001.\n\nHeading into the 2016-17 season, Jefferson was the 10th oldest active player in the NBA.\n\nHe can still jump, though:"
