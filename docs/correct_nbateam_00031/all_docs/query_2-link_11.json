        "text": "Since 2011, Jefferson has appeared in the uniforms of the San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Dallas Mavericks and now the Cavaliers. He’s 15 seasons into his career, and he’s still finding ways to make contributions to an NBA Finals team. “It’s impressive,” said Golden State Warriors assistant coach Luke Walton, Jefferson’s college teammate at Arizona in the early 2000s. “He got to the league two years before I did. I’ve been done for years now; he’s still playing at a high level. He’s had a lot of success in his career.\n\nSo he has managed to stay relevant in a completely different role, from the athletic starting scorer of his early years to a savvy contributor off the bench now. His play in the second quarter of Game 2 might have been the highlight for the Cavs in their blowout loss. And when he’s not on the court, he’s bringing the team together and sharing insight via social media. “This team has been closer than everyone has known,” Jefferson said. “Thankfully, because of my Snapchat stories, everyone knows that we actually get along.”\n\nCavs big man Tristan Thompson called it the “most important game of the season,” but the reality is that they’ll have another chance at home if they lose. Surely there must be some part of them that knows this game is not essential, right? “No, [expletive] no,” Cleveland forward Richard Jefferson said. “[Expletive] no. Not a chance. Not a chance. No. We want to win every game. We’ve been trying to win every road game. This series is the first road games we’ve lost. You gotta be greedy in the playoffs. That’s something that I’ve learned in 15 years. Don’t [think], ‘Oh, we have home court.’ Be greedy. If you’re not greedy, it’s going to come back and bite you in your tail."
