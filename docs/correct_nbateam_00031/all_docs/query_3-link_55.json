        "text": "We'll keep updating this story as players across the NBA sign this month.\n\nA person familiar with the decision says free agent Derrick Rose has agreed to sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nRose, a former league MVP who has struggled with knee injuries, will get a one-year contract at the veteran’s minimum of $2.1 million, said the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the team has not announce the agreement.\n\nRose played for the New York Knicks last season and averaged 18 points and 4.4 assists. The 28-year-old Rose’s role with the Cavs is still to be determined. He could be used as a backup or start depending on what the team does with All-Star Kyrie Irving, who recently asked for a trade.\n\nRose drew interest from other teams. He met with Cleveland’s front office on Monday, when the team promoted Koby Altman to be their full-time general manger after he served as the interim GM since mid-June.\n\nGasol stays with Spurs after all\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Pau Gasol has agreed to terms on a three-year contract with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe 7-foot Spaniard and the Spurs came to agreement on a deal that is partially guaranteed for the third season.\n\nGasol declined the $16 million option on his contract in June the intent of signing a longer-term deal with the Spurs. The Spurs re-signed Patty Mills and added free agents Rudy Gay and Brandon Paul.\n\nGasol averaged 12.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.1 blocks in 25.4 minutes per game for the Spurs last season.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\n• Live: Pistons, NBA free agency rumor mill\n\nMore: Stan Van Gundy gambles by swapping Avery Bradley for KCP\n\nHaslem stays with Heat one more year\n\nUdonis Haslem believes he can still play, and the Miami Heat apparently agree.\n\nThe three-time NBA champion has signed a one-year, $2.3 million deal to remain with the Heat for what will be his 15th season. Haslem was already the longest-tenured player in Heat history, with all of his NBA seasons coming for his hometown team.\n\nAmong active players, only Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili have spent the entirety of a career spanning at least 15 years with one franchise.\n\n“It is a great, great, day to have Udonis Haslem sign a contract for his 15th season with the Miami Heat,” team president Pat Riley said Thursday, when the contract was announced. “He isn’t just Mr. 305, he is a true patriarch of the team. Today we are proud to announce that he is back to lead the Heat again.”\n\nHaslem and Dwyane Wade are the only players who were on all three Heat championship teams, 2006, 2012 and 2013. Haslem is extremely popular with the Miami fan base, and 150 children attending a Heat summer basketball camp erupted into cheers when it was announced there Thursday that he had re-signed.\n\nHaslem is Miami’s career leader in rebounds with 5,701, and has appeared in 830 regular-season games — 25 shy of Wade’s record. He’s also seventh on the Heat scoring list.\n\nRondo joins Pelicans\n\nRajon Rondo, who spent last year dipping in and out of the Chicago Bulls' rotations, has agreed on a one-year deal with the New Orleans Pelicans, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nRondo, an 11-year vet, had a tumultuous run with the Bulls last season before suffering a fractured thumb in their first round postseason matchup against the Boston Celtics. It was largely Rondo who helped engineer a 2-0 lead before the injury occurred.\n\nRondo fell completely out of the Bulls' rotation last season for a stretch of five games in January before coach Fred Hoiberg came to rely on him as a veteran presence. Rondo was routinely praised by his teammates for mentoring the team's younger players.\n\nRondo averaged 7.8 points and 6.7 assists last year with the Bulls, marks that were significantly lower than his career averages of 10.7 points and 8.5 assists.\n\nThe 31-year-old will back up incumbent starter Jrue Holiday, who recently agreed to a 5-year, $126 million dollar deal to stay in New Orleans.\n\nEx-Spurs wing Simmons to join Magic\n\nThe Orlando Magic and 27-year-old shooting guard Jonathon Simmons have agreed to a three-year deal, a person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed to USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick.\n\nThe Spurs renounced their rights to Simmons — a former D-League player who reportedly once paid $150 to try out for the Austin Toros — making him an unrestricted free agent.\n\nSimmons — who made a name for himself with some big performances for the San Antonio Spurs in the 2017 playoffs, including a 22-point outing in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals against the Golden State Warriors — averaged 6.1 points on 45.1% shooting in his two seasons with the Spurs.\n\nWizards match Nets offer for Porter\n\nThe Washington Wizards have matched the Brooklyn Nets’ $106 million, four-year offer sheet to keep forward Otto Porter.\n\nUnder NBA rules, the Wizards had two days to match Brooklyn’s offer sheet for the 24-year-old restricted free agent.\n\nPorter becomes Washington’s highest-paid player for the time being, ahead of guards Bradley Beal and John Wall. He set career highs with 13.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, 1.5 steals and shooting and 3-point percentages of .516 and .434 last season, his fourth as a professional.\n\nThe Wizards drafted Porter third overall in 2013 out of Georgetown. Grunfeld said Porter, who has averaged 9.3 points a game in his career, has developed into a vital part of the team’s young core.\n\nJazz add ex-Piston Jerebko, ex-Wolverine Udoh\n\nA person with direct knowledge of the deals says the Utah Jazz have reached agreements to sign free agents Thabo Sefolosha, Jonas Jerebko and Ekpe Udoh. The Jazz also released Boris Diaw, whose 2017-18 salary would have been guaranteed Saturday.\n\nSefolosha heads to Utah after three seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. The 2006 No. 13 overall pick averaged 7.2 points, 4.4 rebounds and shot 34.2% from three-point range last season.\n\nJerebko spent the last two seasons with the Celtics and averaged 3.8 points and 3.5 rebounds last year. He was drafted by the Pistons in 2009.\n\nUdoh spent the last two seasons in Turkey, where he won a Euroleague championship with Fenerbahce. Udoh was the No. 6 overall NBA pick in 2010 out of Baylor, though he started his collegiate career at Michigan.\n\nKCP bets on himself with Lakers\n\nFree-agent guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope reached an agreement on a one-year, $18 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nCaldwell-Pope, who became an unrestricted free agent when the Pistons pulled his qualifying offer, played well this season until receiving a vicious pick from Golden State Warriors center Zaza Pachulia, which caused Caldwell-Pope to miss four games with a shoulder injury.\n\nHe averaged 13.8 points per game in 2016-17.\n\nThe Pistons took him with the eighth pick in the 2013 NBA draft.\n\nEx-Piston Baynes goes to Boston\n\nThe Vertical's Shams Charania reports that former Detroit Pistons center Aron Baynes has reached an agreement with the Boston Celtics on a one-year, $4.3-million deal.\n\nBaynes had opted out of his $6.5 million deal with the Pistons in June.\n\nHe averaged 5.6 points and 4.6 rebounds in 156 games over two seasons with the Pistons.\n\nRaps send Carroll to Nets, get Miles from Indy\n\nThree people with knowledge of the dealings tell The Associated Press that the Toronto Raptors have made two trades, sending DeMarre Carroll to Brooklyn for salary cap relief and landing C.J. Miles in a sign-and-trade with Indiana for Cory Joseph.\n\nThe Raptors agreed to the Carroll deal late Saturday night, then quickly moved to fill his spot as a shooter and wing defender with Miles.\n\nCarroll has two years and $30 million left on his deal, and the cap-strapped Raptors will save millions in tax penalties by making the move. They sent future first- and second-round picks to Brooklyn and also received Justin Hamilton.\n\nMiles agreed to terms on a three-year, $25 million deal with Toronto.\n\nESPN first reported the trades.\n\nEx-Wolverine Tim Hardaway Jr. returning to Knicks\n\nThe New York Knicks have signed free-agent guard Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract.\n\nThe team announced the deal Saturday.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 Hardaway returned to the Knicks after two seasons with the Atlanta Hawks. Last season, he had career highs in scoring (14.5), assists (2.3), rebounds (2.8), minutes (27.3) and field-goal percentage (.455). He has career averages of 11.0 points and 23.4 minutes.\n\nHis father, five-time All-Star Tim Hardaway, is an assistant coach for Detroit.\n\nHarden earns richest contract in NBA history\n\nThe Houston Rockets have signed star guard James Harden to a four-year, $228 million contract extension, the richest contract in NBA history.\n\nThe Rockets said Saturday the extension will run through 2022-23 season but will not kick in until 2019. That means it will not affect their salary cap this season, so the Rockets are free to continue their roster upgrade. They added Chris Paul earlier this summer.\n\nRockets owner Leslie Alexander says Harden’s “incredible work ethic, desire to win, and passion to be the best” make him “the perfect leader in our pursuit of another championship.” Harden says “Houston is home for me.”\n\nHe averaged 29.1 points and led the NBA with 11.2 assists last season.\n\nEx-Wolverine Jamal Crawford goes to Minnesota\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Jamal Crawford has agreed to terms on a two-year deal with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nThe cap-strapped Wolves only had the room exception left to use for the deal, worth about $4.2 million for the upcoming season.\n\nThe 37-year-old Crawford, who played just one year at Michigan, averaged 12.3 points in 82 games for the Clippers last season. He was traded to Atlanta to help make room for Danilo Gallinari and reached a buyout agreement with the Hawks.\n\nCrawford gives the Timberwolves a much-needed scorer off of the bench. It continues an aggressive summer that has also seen the additions of Jimmy Butler, Jeff Teague and Taj Gibson.\n\nWarriors retain Zaza\n\nCenter Zaza Pachulia has agreed to a $3.5 million, one-year contract to stay with the NBA champion Golden State Warriors, his agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Friday.\n\nGolden State’s starter in a three-center rotation last season, the 33-year-old Pachulia averaged 5.1 points and 3.8 rebounds in 14.1 minutes during the postseason, and scored in double digits four times.\n\nPachulia played for $2.9 million last season, willing to take a lower salary to be part of a team that would chase a championship — and he wound up with his first ring after 14 NBA seasons.\n\nCavs add Jeff Green\n\nA person familiar with the negotiations says the Cleveland Cavaliers have agreed to terms on a one-year, $2.3 million contract with free agent forward Jeff Green.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Green averaged 9.2 points and 3.1 rebounds for the Orlando Magic last season. He previously played for Oklahoma City, Boston, Memphis and the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nGreen will turn 31 in August.\n\nHe has averaged 13.5 points and 4.7 rebounds during his career. Green has appeared in 38 postseason games, most recently with the Clippers in 2015-16.\n\nEvans goes to Memphis\n\nGuard Tyreke Evans agreed to a one-year deal with Memphis.\n\nEvans played 40 games between the Pelicans and Kings in 2016-17, averaging 10.3 points, 3.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists.\n\nThe fourth overall pick by the Kings in the 2009 draft, Evans has played in 473 games and averaged 16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 32.2 minutes over his eight-year career with the Kings and Pelicans.\n\nPacers add Collison to backcourt\n\nThe Indiana Pacers have signed free agent Darren Collison.\n\nTerms of the deal were not released Friday amid reports it is a two-year contract worth $20 million.\n\nThe point guard returns to a team he played for from 2010-12. Collison averaged 11.9 points and 5.0 in 139 games during his first stint with the Pacers.\n\nSince being taken with 21st overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft, Collison has career averages of 12.7 points and 4.8 assists.\n\nHe joins a backcourt that will be led by Victor Oladipo and Lance Stephenson The Pacers are rebuilding after trading four-time All-Star Paul George to Oklahoma City and losing point guard Jeff Teague in free agency.\n\nIndiana also waived forward Rakeem Christmas.\n\nBogdanovic leaves Wizards for Pacers\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says the Washington Wizards have renounced the rights to free agent Bojan Bogdanovic so he could agree to a two-year, $21 million deal with the Pacers.\n\nHe could contribute immediately now after four-time All-Star Paul George was traded from Indiana to Oklahoma City.\n\nBogdanovic averaged 13.7 points in 81 games between Brooklyn and Washington last season.\n\nClippers acquire Gallinari in three-team trade\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers acquired sharp-shooting forward Danilo Gallinari from Denver as part of a three-team trade that also involved Atlanta.\n\nIn the swap, Los Angeles sent Jamal Crawford, Diamond Stone, cash considerations and a protected 2018 first-round pick to the Hawks. The Nuggets receive a 2019 second-round pick from Atlanta.\n\nThe 28-year-old Gallinari was selected by New York with the sixth overall pick in 2008. He wound up in Denver as part of the blockbuster deal in February 2011 that sent Carmelo Anthony to the Knicks.\n\nA fan favorite, Gallinari averaged 16.2 points and made 535 3-pointers for the Nuggets. He missed the 2013-14 season because of a torn left ACL.\n\nCrawford played for the Hawks from 2009-11. He’s captured the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year Award three times.\n\nThe 20-year-old Stone was acquired by the Clippers during a 2016 draft-night trade with New Orleans. He played in seven games for Los Angeles last season.\n\nGay joining Spurs\n\nVeteran free agent Rudy Gay agreed to a 2-year, $17 million deal with the San Antonio Spurs, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal wasn't announced publicly yet.\n\nThere's a player option on the second year of the deal.\n\nGay suffered a torn Achilles in January with the Sacramento Kings after averaging 18.7 points and 6.3 rebounds in 30 games. He opted out of a $14.3 million deal to stay with the Kings and test his value on the market.\n\nThough he leaves money on the table, the veteran swing man is now on a viable contender.\n\nUpon agreeing to the deal, he posted a picture of a Spurs jersey on social media.\n\nMiami deals McRoberts to Dallas\n\nThe Miami Heat have traded oft-injured forward Josh McRoberts to the Dallas Mavericks for center A.J. Hammons and a 2023 second-round draft pick.\n\nThe move frees much-needed salary cap space for Miami, which owed McRoberts just over $6 million for next season. McRoberts was limited to 81 games with the Heat in the last three seasons.\n\nHammons is set to make $1.3 million.\n\nBoth players got to the NBA out of Carmel High in Carmel, Indiana. McRoberts graduated from Carmel; Hammons left there and transferred to Oak Hill in Virginia for his junior and senior seasons.\n\nDirk and Dallas remain a match\n\nDirk Nowitzki has a deal with the Dallas Mavericks that sets him up to join Kobe Bryant as the only players to spend 20 seasons with one NBA franchise.\n\nNowitzki signed a two-year, $10 million contract that carries a team option in the second season. A person with knowledge of the deal contract provided specifics on condition of anonymity because the team didn't release the terms.\n\nThe agreement is similar to the one the Mavs and Nowitzki reached last year, although for significantly less money. Last year's contract was for two years and $50 million, and the club declined its option before free agency opened this year.\n\nThe 39-year-old Nowitzki is no longer the primary option for the Mavericks, so a $5 million deal is more in line with his role on a roster that has become significantly younger since the start of last season. The $25 million salary from a year ago was as much about Dallas paying Nowitzki for his loyalty, which included taking less money to help acquire free agents through the years.\n\nNowitzki was second to Harrison Barnes in scoring last season at 14.2 points per game.\n\nJohnson sticking with Heat\n\nJames Johnson is back with the Miami Heat, and has cashed in after a breakout season.\n\nJohnson agreed to terms on a four-year deal that could be worth more than $60 million, a person with knowledge of the talks told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because it hasn't been formally announced.\n\nJohnson had said for months that he wanted to remain in Miami — and based on that salary, the Heat clearly had no desire to let him go elsewhere.\n\nJohnson revived his career in Miami last season, averaging 12.8 points — his best, by far, in his eight NBA years. He shed 40 pounds and finished sixth in the league's Most Improved Player voting. He made $4 million last season, which was the best salary of his career.\n\nVince Carter off to Sacramento\n\nForty-year-old Vince Carter has agreed to a one-year deal with the Sacramento Kings that will pay him $8 million, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports' Sam Amick.\n\nThe Kings will be the seventh team for Carter in 19 seasons. He has spent the past three seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nWith the Grizzlies last season, Carter averaged eight points and three rebounds and shot 40% from the floor. Against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs, Carter became the first 40-year old to hit at least three 3-pointers in a playoff game. He finished the game with 13 points\n\nFor his career, Carter is averaging 18.2 points per game and shooting 44% from the floor.\n\nKelly Olynyk is going to Miami\n\nKelly Olynyk has agreed to sign with the Miami Heat.\n\nAgent Greg Lawrence confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press, after ESPN first reported it would be a four-year deal worth in excess of $50 million.\n\nA 7-foot center with three-point range, Olynyk spent his first four NBA seasons with the Boston Celtics and played mostly as a reserve. He averaged 9.5 points in 278 regular-season games shot a career-best 51 percent last season.\n\nAndre Roberson gets $30M to stay in OKC\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to terms with Andre Roberson on a three-year, $30 million contract.\n\nThe deal keeps Roberson in Oklahoma City, where he has emerged as a top-flight perimeter defender in four seasons with the Thunder.\n\nRoberson averaged 6.6 points and 5.1 rebounds last season. But his real value is on the defensive end, where he often guards the opposing team’s best scorer.\n\nDion Waiters staying in South Beach\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation says Dion Waiters is staying in Miami and has agreed on a new four-year, $52 million contract with the Heat.\n\nWaiters averaged 15.8 points in 46 games last season for the Heat. He was a significant part of how Miami turned its season around after an 11-30 start, going 30-11 in the second half.\n\nThe Heat were 27-19 when Waiters played, 14-22 when he did not.\n\nWaiters missed Miami’s final 13 games with a badly sprained ankle, and the Heat wound up losing a tiebreaker for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. He played for $2.9 million last season.\n\nWarriors add Nick Young, Omri Casspi\n\nVeteran guard Nick Young is getting a new start with Golden State, agreeing to a $5.2 million, one-year contract with the champion Warriors.\n\nIn addition, forward Omri Casspi is joining the Warriors on a $2,106,470, one-year contract. This will be the 29-year-old Casspi’s sixth team as he enters his ninth NBA season, including two separate stints with the Sacramento Kings. He played for Sacramento, New Orleans and Minnesota last season, averaging 5.2 points and 3.1 rebounds in 17.9 minutes.\n\nThe 32-year-old Young last month declined the player option in his contract for next season with the Los Angeles Lakers, which would have paid him more than $5.6 million, and became a free agent.\n\nNow, he’s on a super team.\n\nYoung averaged 13.2 points, 2.3 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 60 games for the Lakers. He will provide the Warriors with the kind of depth they like on a long bench as coach Steve Kerr regularly rotates in his reserves to spell the stars.\n\nJefferson returning to Cavs\n\nRichard Jefferson isn’t messing with any retirement talk this summer.\n\nAfter saying he would stop playing after the Cavaliers won the NBA title in 2016 and changing his mind, Jefferson said Wednesday that he will be back with Cleveland next season — his 17th as a pro.\n\nThe 37-year-old announced his plans on an episode of his “Road Trippin’” podcast.\n\nJefferson, who had contemplated quitting, has one guaranteed season left on his contract worth $2.5 million. He averaged 5.7 points and 2.6 rebounds in 79 games for the Cavs, serving mostly as a backup for LeBron James. He provided Cleveland with a big lift off the bench during the NBA Finals, when he was asked to guard Golden State’s Kevin Durant and was perhaps the Cavs’ most productive reserve.\n\nGordon Hayward goes to Boston\n\nGordon Hayward has chosen to sign with the Boston Celtics and reunite with coach Brad Stevens.\n\nHayward told Utah officials that he is moving on after seven seasons with the Jazz and that he picked Boston, making the announcement on The Players’ Tribune site.\n\nThe deal is reportedly for four years and $128 million, with a player option in Year 4.\n\nHayward played college ball under Stevens at Butler. He leaves a loaded Western Conference to join a Boston team that was the No. 1 seed in last season’s Eastern Conference playoffs. The Miami Heat also were in the chase to land Hayward.\n\nHe was finally an All-Star for the first time last season, averaging career bests of 21.9 points and 5.4 rebounds. Hayward also shot 47 percent, a significant jump over what he managed in the previous four seasons.\n\nPatterson now rolls with Thunder\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says forward Patrick Patterson has agreed to a three-year, $16.4 million deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nPatterson is leaving Toronto to join All-Star Paul George in a new-look Thunder frontcourt, the person told The Associated Press.\n\nThe deal was first reported by ESPN.\n\nPatterson was a valuable reserve for the Raptors, averaging 7.6 points in nearly four seasons. But he struggled badly in last season’s playoffs, shooting 28 percent from the field.\n\nThe Raptors kept Kyle Lowry and Serge Ibaka but Patterson has a chance to fill a need in Oklahoma City, where Taj Gibson left for Minnesota and Domantas Sabonis was dealt to Indiana in the trade for George.\n\nKings add ex-Spartan Randolph, Hill\n\nThe Sacramento Kings added veteran help to their young roster on Tuesday by agreeing to free-agent contracts with forward Zach Randolph and point guard George Hill.\n\nRandolph left Memphis for a $24 million, two-year deal to reunite with former Grizzlies coach Dave Joerger in Sacramento, a person with knowledge of the agreement told The Associated Press.\n\nESPN first reported the agreement.\n\nHill announced on Twitter that he was coming to Sacramento. Yahoo Sports first reported the deal, saying Hill would get $57 million over three years.\n\nAfter a rocky start to his career in Portland and New York, Randolph, who left Michigan State after his freshman year, found himself in Memphis. He spent eight years with the Grizzlies, emerging as one of the central figures of the team’s “grit and grind” mantra.\n\nHe helped Memphis make the playoffs the past seven years, including a trip to the conference final in 2013 when Joerger was an assistant. Joerger took over as head coach the following year and had three years with Randolph, including a trip to the second round in 2015.\n\nRandolph, who turns 36 later this month, averaged 14.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game last season and is still considered one of the better post players in the game.\n\nHe is expected to be a mentor for young big men like Willie Cauley-Stein, Skal Labissiere and Harry Giles, one of the team’s three first-round picks last month.\n\nHill will be expected to provide similar traits in Sacramento, while grooming rookie point guards De’Aaron Fox and Frank Mason III. The 31-year-old has spent nine years in the NBA with San Antonio, Indiana and Utah.\n\nHe averaged a career-high 16.9 points per game last season for the Jazz, helping them make the second round of the playoffs for the first time since 2010. He also averaged 4.2 assists and 3.4 rebounds. He played only 49 games in the regular season because of various injuries.\n\nScott agrees to join Wizards\n\nA person familiar with the deal tells The Associated Press that free-agent forward Mike Scott has agreed to a $1.7 million, one-year contract with the Washington Wizards.\n\nThe deal between Scott and the Wizards was first reported by ESPN.\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Scott, a second-round pick out of Virginia in 2012, played 281 games over five seasons with the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nHis best season was 2013-14, when he averaged 9.6 points per game. He played only 18 games with the Hawks last season because of a knee injury before being traded to the Phoenix Suns, who waived him. He last appeared in a game on Feb. 15.\n\nDurant taking less money to stay in Golden State\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Kevin Durant has agreed to terms on a two-year deal worth about $53 million to remain with the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe deal calls for about $25 million in the first year with a player option for the second season. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the contract cannot be signed until Thursday.\n\nIt represents a significant giveback for the NBA Finals MVP, who could have signed a max deal that would have paid him millions more next season. The concession from Durant gave the Warriors enough room to lock up Stephen Curry to a max contract and bring back Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston.\n\nDurant joined Golden State last season after 10 years in Oklahoma City and helped lead the Warriors to their second championship in three seasons.\n\nHoliday joins Chicago\n\nA person familiar with the situation says the Chicago Bulls have agreed to a $9 million, two-year contract with guard Justin Holiday.\n\nYahoo!

The former Kansas player averaged 8.1 points last season for the Kings, but did shoot 38% from three-point range.\n\nThe Grizzlies made a low-risk decision to see how much Sacramento’s toxic atmosphere over the previous several seasons may have played into McLemore’s struggles.\n\nMemphis ranked 17th in the league in three-point percentage last season.\n\nMillsap leaves Atlanta for Denver\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that Paul Millsap has agreed to terms with the Denver Nuggets on a three-year deal worth $90 million.\n\nThe 32-year-old Millsap gives the young Nuggets a proven, defensive-minded veteran who should fit perfectly with coach Michael Malone and budding star Nikola Jokic. Millsap is a four-time All-Star who averaged a career-high 18.1 points last season with the Atlanta Hawks to go with 7.7 rebounds and 3.1 assists.\n\nYahoo!

It comes one day after an initial agreement fell apart because it violated rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nNene initially agreed to a four-year, $15 million deal. But the deal violated a rule for players who will be 38 during the contract and so Nene became a free agent again.\n\nBut Nene’s interior presence was critical for the Rockets, who have also agreed to terms with P.J. Tucker to add some toughness to a high-scoring roster.\n\nESPN first reported the new deal.\n\nT'wolves add to frontcourt with Gibson\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says Taj Gibson is reuniting with coach Tom Thibodeau, agreeing on a two-year, $28 million deal to join the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nGibson has spent the bulk of his career in Chicago, including five seasons under Thibodeau.

Toronto ended up losing to Cleveland in the second round.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Tucker has averaged 7.7 points for his career and shot 40 percent from 3-point range after joining the Raptors.

The person spoke under the condition of anonymity because the terms of the deal had not been announced.\n\nIguodala, 33, averaged 7.6 points, four rebounds and 2.4 assists this season for the Warriors, playing a significant role off the bench for the champions as their sixth man.\n\nRedick, ex-Piston Johnson heading to 76ers\n\nA person with knowledge of the negotiations says J.J.

But the Jazz locked up the Australian on the first full day of free agency and can now turn their attention to Hayward, their All-Star forward who met with the Miami Heat on Saturday.\n\nIngles averaged a career-best 7.1 points in his third NBA season, then helped the Jazz knock off the Clippers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nEx-Piston Calderon goes to Cleveland\n\nThe Cavaliers have agreed to a contract with veteran Jose Calderon to back up All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving.\n\nCalderon’s agency, Priority Sports, confirmed the deal on Twitter, and a person with knowledge of the details says it’s for the veteran’s minimum, about $2.3 million in Calderon’s case.\n\nThe Cavs struggled to find a replacement for Matthew Dellavedova after he left for Milwaukee last summer. They tried rookie Kay Felder (Oakland University) as Irving’s backup and signed veteran Deron Williams later in the season.\n\nCalderon played for the Lakers and Atlanta last season, his 12th in the NBA. The 35-year-old Spanish native has averaged 9.6 points and 6.2 assists in 789 games.\n\nCarter-Williams gets 1-year deal with Hornets\n\nA person with knowledge of the details says Michael Carter-Williams has agreed to a one-year contract with the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nThe former Rookie of the Year will get $2.7 million to join All-Star Kemba Walker as Charlotte’s point guards.\n\nCarter-Williams was the league’s top rookie playing for Philadelphia in 2013-14 but hasn’t matched that success after being traded to Milwaukee and then spending last season with Chicago.

He developed into a consistent backup last season, averaging 4.8 points and 4.7 rebounds in 66 games.\n\nThe rebuilding Bulls are high on Felicio’s potential and are focusing on developing young players.

Keeping Mills was a priority for the Spurs for many reasons, including how point guard Tony Parker is still dealing with a left leg injury that knocked him out of last season’s playoffs.\n\nMills averaged 9.5 points in a career-best 22 minutes per game last season. He also finished tied with Kawhi Leonard for the Spurs’ lead in three-pointers, with 147.\n\nChampion Warriors keep Shaun Livingston\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation tells The Associated Press that the Golden State Warriors have agreed to a three-year, $24 million deal with backup guard Shaun Livingston.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because a contract cannot be signed until July 6.\n\nLivingston has been an integral part of the Warriors’ two championship teams and three trips to the NBA Finals in the last three years. The versatile guard can play both at the point and off the ball and gives them a defensive dimension on the second unit as well.\n\nIt was the first move the champions made in what figures to be a busy summer.

He spent his first three seasons with Chicago, playing mostly in a reserve role.\n\nRon Baker: I'm staying with Knicks\n\nShooting guard Ron Baker says he is returning to the New York Knicks.\n\nBaker wrote on Twitter he is “excited to be returning to the Knicks next season.” Baker was an undrafted free agent out of Wichita State who appeared in 52 games for the Knicks as a rookie last season.\n\nBaker averaged 4.1 points and 2.1 assists in about 17 minutes per game. He made 13 starts for the Knicks, reaching double figures in scoring five times.\n\nThe Knicks have not announced the deal.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade was not official.\n\nGeorge told the Pacers recently that he planned to leave as a free agent next summer, forcing the team to find a trade before losing him for nothing.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity because neither team had announced the move. The Jazz needed to make the deal before July 1 or would have lost the salary cap room necessary to pull it off.\n\nRubio’s arrival likely means the end of George’s Hills run in Utah.\n\nRubio spent six seasons in Minnesota, delighting Wolves fans with flashy passing and an approachable nature while also suffering through losing season after losing season."
