        "text": "The day many Golden State Warriors didn’t want to come has finally arrived, as Klay Thompson is no longer with the Dubs. It can be said, however, that many saw it coming, especially when Thompson rejected a two-year, $48 million extension offer from the Warriors last season.\n\nThompson wanted more, and he got that eventually from the Dallas Mavericks, who agreed to a three-year contract worth $50 million.\n\nFormer Golden State Warriors vet Richard Jefferson shares Klay Thompson story\n\nThompson’s decision might have come down to having his hurt feelings during contract negotiations with the Warriors. His former teammate and current ESPN analyst Richard Jefferson voiced his support for Thompson, implying that the Warriors owe Thompson for his role in making the Dubs the huge franchise that it has become.\n\n“I know I’ve never shared this before out of respect to Klay. Getting off Elevator Christmas Day. This is on Christmas Day. I get off the elevator and I see Klay. I’m like, ‘Oh Klay, what’s up? What’s up?’ I’m like, ‘Hey, man, keep your mental right.’ He’s like, ‘Man, tell him to pay me my money’.\n\nThis was on Christmas Day. So on Christmas Day, a guy that had won four championships, and I don’t give a damn what anybody says, how much money they gave him over the years, because he turned their franchise around. That franchise is worth billions of dollars, not just because of Steph [Curry], it’s also because of Klay.”\n\nIn any case, it is a new chapter now for both the Warriors and Thompson. The Warriors will be moving on without Thompson, who spent his first 13 seasons in the NBA donning Golden State colors. For Thompson, he will now be focused on chasing ring No. 5 with Luka Doncic and the Mavericks.\n\nFor More NBA, WNBA, and College Basketball Content:"
