        "text": "No KD, no problem\n\nThe Warriors closed out a sweep against the Blazers last night in Portland, escaping with a 119–117 win in overtime behind a 37-point triple double from Stephen Curry.\n\nWe already know that Golden State is the most dominant team of the current NBA era, but what made the Portland series so remarkable is how the Warriors won. Former NBA player Richard Jefferson (who knows as well as anybody how hard the Warriors are to beat) sent just three tweets during the series and do as good a job of explaining the outcome as thousands of words of analysis.\n\nIn Game 2, the Warriors trailed by 17 as late as 16 seconds into the second half. In Game 3, Portland actually led by 18 with 2:28 left in the first half. The most outrageous Golden State comeback was in the clinching Game 4, when the Blazers led by 17 with 1:55 to play in the third quarter.\n\nThe fact that the Warriors were able to come back from deficits of nearly 20 points not just once but in three consecutive games is astounding, and even more so when you consider that they’re missing perhaps the best player in the world.\n\nThey won every game of the series despite spending most of the time playing from behind.\n\nJefferson’s tweets make it clear just how crushing this loss was for the Blazers. No one expected them to actually win the series, and building large leads late in the game like they did was enough to make people think Portland was for real. But in the end it was just like The Hound repeatedly stabbing The Mountain and realizing nothing could stop such a monster.\n\nThere’s one Golden State play to make fun of, though\n\nThe game may not have gone to overtime if Steph hadn’t traveled before taking a potential go-ahead shot with 10 seconds left. I mean, he basically walked the length of the baseline.\n\nHis brother was right there to make sure the refs didn’t miss the call.\n\nThe best of SI\n\nMagic Johnson’s revelations in a lengthy ESPN interview prove he shouldn’t be running the Lakers. ... Please don’t forget that Mike Trout is still the best player of his generation. ... These are the seven places Anthony Davis could land now that he still seems eager to leave the Pelicans.\n\nAround the sports world\n\nMets outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, already out after undergoing surgery on both heels last summer, fractured his ankle in a “violent fall” at his Florida ranch. ... Brian Bowen, the centerpiece of the scandal that got Rick Pitino fired, has his eyes set on the NBA after a year spent in Australia. ... Ezekiel Elliott got handcuffed after an incident at a music festival in Las Vegas. ... Kevin Durant has been spending his time out injured getting really spicy online. ... Todd Frazier and Adam Eaton are engaged in some very stupid beef.\n\nPerfect hidden-ball trick\n\nA huge moment for British (?) hockey\n\nThe Brits didn’t win the hockey world championship but their victory over France in overtime ensured that they’ll stay in the top division while France was relegated to the second tier.\n\nCold-blooded\n\nZion... c’mon, man\n\nThis Naval Academy tradition is always a blast to watch\n\nNot a bad place to catch a game\n\nJeez, such thin skin\n\nNot sports\n\nHeinz had to apologize to Canadians because “MayoChup” has an unfortunate double entendre in an indigenous language. ... Some guy climbed to the top of the Eiffel Tower without assistance and forced tourists to evacuate. ... John Wick 3 just came out and John Wick 4 already has a release date. ... The guy who played Bran Stark initially thought the end of Game of Thrones was a prank.\n\nStranger Things is a softcore porno now?\n\nHannibal Burress is the best\n\nDrunk History is coming back\n\nA good song\n\nShoutout to the Spotify algorithm for resurfacing this band I saw play while they were blackout drunk in a Toronto dive bar."
