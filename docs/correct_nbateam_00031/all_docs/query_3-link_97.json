        "text": "The new defining moment of James’s career is willing his team to a historic Finals comeback to bring the same fans whose hearts he broke and whose jersey-burning hatred he inflamed their first pro sports championship since 1964.\n\nBreaking Cleveland’s championship drought and delivering on the promise he made when he returned from Miami two summers ago is now LeBron’s legacy. This one championship in Cleveland is worth more for James’s standing than both of his titles in Miami combined.\n\nLeBron admitted this in the Sports Illustrated essay he wrote announcing his homecoming: “When I left Cleveland, I was on a mission. I was seeking championships, and we won two. But Miami already knew that feeling. Our city hasn’t had that feeling in a long, long, long time. My goal is still to win as many titles as possible, no question. But what’s most important for me is bringing one trophy back to Northeast Ohio.”\n\nThis series was personal for James.\n\nIt was personal for a son of Akron, Ohio, to bring a championship to Cleveland. It was personal for James to prove that he, not Steph Curry, was the best player in the game. It was deeply personal when the Warriors mocked James for being too sensitive when he stated he felt disrespected by Draymond Green’s trash talk after James and Green became entangled late in the Warriors’ win in Game 4.\n\nThat sequence, which started with James stepping over Green in a highly disrespectful manner that should have resulted in a technical foul and included Green’s fateful retaliatory low blow that led to his suspension for Game 5, changed the course of hoops history.\n\nIncited by the Warriors, James showed the killer instinct he has lacked most of his career, the trait that has separated him from Russell, Magic, Bird, Jordan, and Kobe. He barked at Curry. He didn’t back down when faced with adversity.\n\nLeBron led all players in the Finals in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks. The Finals MVP, he would not be denied.\n\nHe capped Game 7 with a triple-double (27 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists) and scored 11 of his points in the fourth quarter. Golden State scored 13 fourth-quarter points.\n\nLeBron is the most persecuted player in NBA history.\n\nBy nature of his size and outsized talent, he has inspired a legion of haters and detractors. He is operating in an era oversaturated with social media judgment and media scrutiny.\n\nAs Wilt Chamberlain, another aggrieved great, famously expressed, nobody roots for Goliath. An addendum to the Big Dipper’s statement would be that many root for Goliath to fall flat on his face.\n\nWith James’s prodigious talent has come extraordinary expectations. When he has struggled to live up to them, James has responded in puerile and sometimes petty fashion.\n\nAfter he lost his first Finals with the Heat in 2011, James talked about those relishing his defeat having “the same life that they had before they woke up today.”\n\nUnbecoming.\n\nBut basketball fans don’t have James’s reputation to kick around anymore, not after his team became the first to win an NBA Finals after going down, 3-1.\n\nLeBron can’t be branded a loser. Sensible basketball fans felt this way before the Finals, but the argument is completely moot now.\n\nThe back-to-back 41-point performances in Games 5 and 6 with his team’s back against the wall and his clutch play in Game 7 speak for themselves.\n\nJames made the play of the Finals, and one of the great defensive plays in NBA history, when he elevated halfway up the backboard to pin Andre Iguodala’s go-ahead layup with 1:50 remaining.\n\nCleveland fans have memorialized and mythologized their sports hardship with capital letters: The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, The Decision. Now, they have a capital-letter-worthy play on their side: The Block.\n\nAs great as James was, he didn’t do it alone. No player can, which is what the serial Bron bashers fail to acknowledge.\n\nKyrie Irving, who shot just 33 percent in the first two games, averaged 30.8 points over the final five games of the series. Irving hit the hallowed 50/40/90 shooting trifecta in those games, shooting 50.8 percent from the floor, 46.7 percent from 3-point range, and 95.2 percent from the free throw line.\n\nIrving, who hit the series-deciding 3-pointer with 53 seconds left in Game 7, would have been the Finals MVP in almost any other year.\n\nThere will be a tendency to focus on the failure of the Warriors, who wilted when it mattered most. There are already comparisons to the 2007 Patriots.\n\nDwell on that if you desire, but the more appropriate Boston sports comparison is the Cavaliers to the 2004 Red Sox. Just when it seemed that their fans had absorbed yet another gut punch, the team rewarded their faith in historic and euphoric fashion.\n\nFor James, abandoning Cleveland is no longer his legacy. The Decision fades away. For Cleveland, losing is no longer its legacy. The Derision fades away.\n\nJames and Cleveland could only change their stories and their reputations together."
