I should have two rings.\n\n(F***ing Kevin Durant, man!!!)\"\n\nBut he didn't say anything about \"dominating\" Golden State.\n\nI'm not a big \"what-if\" guy, but considering the Warriors led the Cavs 3-1 despite Steph Curry not being close to 100 percent, Draymond Green being suspended for Game 5, Andrew Bogut missing Games 6 and 7, and Harrison Barnes shooting a combined 5-for-32 over the final three games ...\n\n[REWIND: Richard Jefferson: The 2017 NBA Finals much closer than people think]\n\n...I don't see how or why Jefferson believes the Cavs would have \"dominated\" the Dubs in 2017 if Durant wasn't there.\n\nBut everybody is entitled to their opinion and ultimately, who really cares?"
