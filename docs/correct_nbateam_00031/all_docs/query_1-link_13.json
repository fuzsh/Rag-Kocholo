        "text": "Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nCleveland Cavaliers swingman Richard Jefferson told reporters Wednesday the Golden State Warriors' lack of poise was the primary factor that contributed to their downfall after they mounted a 3-1 series lead in last year's NBA Finals.\n\nAppearing at the league's media day in advance of the team's third straight Finals meeting, Jefferson discussed at length how keeping emotions in check will be key for the Cavaliers' opposition, according to KNBR's Kevin Jones:\n\nAs Jefferson mentioned, composure will be key for the Warriors after everything that transpired last season.\n\nA year ago, the Western Conference champions started to unravel when Green was suspended for Game 5 after he exceeded the league's postseason flagrant foul point limit following a physical altercation with LeBron James in Game 4.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Green said he doesn't plan to dial things back this time around just because he was disciplined a year ago.\n\n\"I think there's emotions for everyone in this series,\" he said. \"If there's not, you're in the wrong series. Whether I had been suspended or not I wanted to come into the NBA Finals with high emotions. You don't get here without it.\""
