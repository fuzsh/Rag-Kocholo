        "text": "CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers can be believed now when they say their Christmas rematch with the Golden State Warriors isn't much more than just another game.\n\nFun, yes. Exciting for fans, sure. A growing American tradition, apparently.\n\n\"I mean as years go on, we kind of just don't really give a (expletive) about it no more,\" Cavs reserve center Tristan Thompson told cleveland.com.\n\nThe Cavs and Warriors have played in three consecutive Finals and will meet Monday on Christmas for the third straight season, becoming the first teams to play each other three Christmases in a row since the Lakers and Heat did it from 2004-06.\n\nAt no point during that run of Los Angeles-Miami yuletide clashes was the Christmas game a repeat of the past summer's Finals, so that right there is reason to believe a Cavs-Warriors showdown on this day always carries a little more weight.\n\nThe truth is, almost no Christmas game has a lasting impact that players or fans can still feel a week later, let alone at the end of an 82-game season. And Monday's 3 p.m. game in Oakland, Calif. between the two rivals on ABC shouldn't be any different, for several reasons.\n\nThe winner on Christmas has gone on to lose in the Finals. So it's not a harbinger of things to come.\n\nThe Warriors, who are defending champs and winners twice in three Finals over Cleveland, do not believe the Cavs to be a serious threat, sources told cleveland.com, any more so than the Houston Rockets from their own conference.\n\nThe Cavs, have four key players (Dwyane Wade, Jeff Green, Jae Crowder, Jose Calderon) who weren't here in June for the 2017 Finals, and only have five players left on the roster (LeBron James, Kevin Love, Thompson, J.R. Smith, Iman Shumpert) who've played in all three Finals against Golden State.\n\nAll-Star point guards Isaiah Thomas and Stephen Curry won't play in the game. So if there's a fourth Cavs-Warriors Finals in June, what we see on Christmas will look nothing like what goes on in that series.\n\n\"We definitely over the years, especially the first couple years, grew a strong dislike for them, but I think that's just the nature of the game,\" Smith said. \"The matchups and whoever you guard and schemes, that's all going to be totally different by the time we get to the Finals, so it don't really hold no weight.\"\n\nExcept that one time\n\nThere was one time in this series, the Christmas part of Cleveland-Golden State, where almost none of this was true. Where the game most certainly mattered more than the other 81, and where what happened on the court had a lasting impact.\n\nThe Warriors took the 2015 Finals from the Cavs in six games, clinching the series at Quicken Loans Arena. Cleveland played the whole series without Love and lost Irving in Game 1 to a serious knee injury. The Cavs, and at least some in the national media, felt they'd have been champs had Love and Irving been with them.\n\nThen there was James, whose mission was to bring a championship to Cleveland, seething over the 2015 Finals lost and concerned that the sense of urgency to repeat in Golden State seemed much stronger than the one among Cavaliers to get them back.\n\n'It mattered to LeBron'\n\nJames tried then to downplay the Christmas matchup, but drew so many comparisons between his team and the Warriors in the weeks leading up to the game that it was clear the Warriors were on his mind.\n\n\"Of course it mattered to LeBron, it's just no one knew to what degree until we lost (on Christmas),\" said a source close to the Cavs.\n\nIn an interview Thursday with cleveland.com, James said \"every time you guys asked me, it's always been just another game.\n\n\"Because one day, two days later you've got to be prepared for another one,\" he said. \"It's just the way the game is. I think Christmas Day is a big-time day for our league...but at the end of the day, it's one game and you want to see how you can play versus the top team in the league, one of the top teams in the league and that's Golden State.\n\n\"That's always been the narrative of everybody else putting that out there, not us.\"\n\nWell, OK. His guard is still up.\n\n\"The first one, the first Christmas game, coming in people were like 'Oh, let's try to win the game,' but after that it's like 'ah, it's just going to be a good basketball game at Christmas time,'\" Thompson explained.\n\n\"From a mentality standpoint, Kyrie and I being back and knowing the possibilities of kind of what could've gone down had we been healthy was something that I know played into it for our team,\" Love said. \"And knowing that we had playoff experience now and guys that were super hungry to win. So I think that was a big factor in probably why we were upset we lost that game. That was our first, fresh chance to play them.\n\n\"So, it's hard not to have a Christmas Day game, especially after you lose against a team in the Finals, not marked on your calendar.\"\n\nSo, draw your own conclusions as to the Cavs' mindset heading into that first Christmas game against the Warriors.\n\nBlatt strikes\n\nAs for the game itself, Golden State won 89-83. Then-coach David Blatt didn't play Richard Jefferson at all, and two lineups he used in the fourth quarter were lineups that had never played together before.\n\nIrving and Shumpert were just getting back into the flow after missing the first two months with injuries, but players were upset that Blatt, in an important game, went so far away from a rotation that had included Jefferson, Mo Williams, and James Jones all season.\n\nThere were other reasons for the loss -- Love and Irving shot 9-of-31 from the field and James was 10-of-26. But the Cavs had gone 19-7 with that rotation, and Blatt ignored it.\n\n\"At that time, they just didn't believe in him as coach,\" said a source close to James. \"If anything, the reasons for that were magnified on Christmas.\"\n\nThe Cavs played again the next night, getting blown out in Portland. Players at the timesaid off the record they had basically played in protest of what had happened on Christmas, though every player interviewed for this story now says they don't remember.\n\nCleveland beat Phoenix 101-97 on Dec. 28, 2015, but James scored 14 points and was dour after the game. The next night, Cleveland won again in Denver and James scored 34 points.\n\nBut then-general manager David Griffin saw James refusing to get back on defense so many times in that game, that he interpreted it (and James' overall body language) that he was done with Blatt.\n\nGriffin spoke with James when the team returned from the road trip, promising him that he -- Griffin -- would address the Blatt situation. It was then that Griffin began greasing the skids to remove Blatt from the job.\n\nSo much more happened between then and Blatt's actual dismissal in Jan. 22, 2016, including a 34-point loss at home to the Warriors on Jan. 18.\n\nAnd the relationship between Blatt and James, Blatt and the Cavs' players in general, was always tenuous at best.\n\nBut his ultimate dismissal can be traced, at least in part, to those raw feelings from Christmas that lingered.\n\nT'was kind of a big game."
