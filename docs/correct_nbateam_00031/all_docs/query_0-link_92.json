        "text": "Draymond Green is coming for Richard Jefferson, but not in the physical sense.\n\nThe Warriors star sparred via text with Jefferson over podcast dominance during the All-Star break in a exchange Jefferson shared on his Instagram.\n\nThat Instagram post was prompted by Jefferson bringing up the banter on the podcast he and fellow Cavaliers player Channing Frye have hosted this season, Road Trippin’ With RJ & Channing.\n\nSome further background: Road Trippin’ blew up after Kyrie Irving revealed himself as a flat-earth truther on the podcast, reaching No. 1 on iTunes’ charts. Meanwhile, Green is four episodes into his Dray Day podcast with Bay Area News Group columnist Marcus Thompson II on Uninterrupted.\n\nOK, now you’re ready to read Jefferson explain the back-and-forth with Green.\n\n“At All-Star weekend I get a text from a random number, and it goes ‘Yo this Draymond.’ And I’m like, ‘Okay, what up Dray, what’s going on man how you doing?’” Jefferson said on his podcast. “(He replies) ‘I just want to let you know’ — he just sends this text on All-Star weekend, and he’s an All-Star, he’s got his own thing going on All-Star weekend — ‘We’re going to (bleeping) destroy your podcast.’”\n\nThe text exchange posted by Jefferson further details their conversation.\n\n“I’m two episodes in and haven’t had a guest or anything it’s all me,” Green wrote at the time. “I’m going to destroy you bro.”\n\nJefferson replied with some banter related to the last two NBA Finals.\n\n“Oh and we both know #2 isn’t a accomplishment …. IN ANYTHING,” Jefferson wrote.\n\nCheck out Jefferson’s full post below:"
