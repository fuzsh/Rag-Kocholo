        "text": "At 35, Richard Jefferson has been around the NBA block. He's been to two NBA Finals with the New Jersey Nets and has played for the San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Milwaukee Bucks, Dallas Mavericks and Golden State Warriors. The veteran swingman fills a hole in the Cavs' depth chart behind LeBron James at the small forward position, and the lifetime 38 percent 3-point shooting vet can provide a quick pop of offense.\n\nField Goal: As a junior in college, Jefferson and the Arizona Wildcats basketball team lost the NCAA Championship game to the Duke Blue Devils. Also, in his first two years in the NBA, his Nets lost in the Finals to the Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers. He's ready to finally win a title. \"If I play in 10 games this year and we win,\" he says, \"I'll be smiling ear to ear.\"\n\nGym Pact: In 2007, Jefferson donated $3.5 million to his college alma mater for a new basketball and volleyball practice facility. The school named the building the Richard Jefferson Gymnasium to honor the basketball player's gift. \"I knew it would help tons of student athletes that go to the school,\" he says. \"It was something I wish was there when I was a student.\"\n\nHome Court: Jefferson, who has played in 38 regular season games against the Cavs, is looking forward to playing in front of Cleveland crowds as a member of the team. \"Their fans are extremely diehard,\" he says. \"They want success, and they understand giving your best effort is what's most important.\""
