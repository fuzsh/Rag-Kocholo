        "text": "Steve Kerr hilariously trolled former Golden State Warriors player, Richard Jefferson, on live TV. Having brought up the lack of defense at the rim, Jefferson put himself in the line of fire for the Dubs coach. It’s common knowledge that the Golden State plays small. The lack of a 7-foot big man has them going forward with this. And when a reporter brought up Jefferson’s comment, Kerr had a hilarious reaction to it.\n\nHaving former players on the telecast duties often gives birth to entertaining moments like this, and Richard Jefferson’s easygoing nature certainly provided laughs.\n\nCoach Kerr does not hold back on trolling Richard Jefferson\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n“I’m sorry, who is this guy you’re talking about?” Kerr hysterically retorted. It is quite a comment, given that this is not the first time the two have butted heads.\n\nAlso funny is that the reporter started off with their past relationship, “your Arizona Wildcats brother” before moving to the controversial comment. They might be Wildcats alums, but Kerr and Jefferson have no love lost between them. Last year was quite eventful for Jefferson.\n\nFrom refusing to answer questions from Richard in-game to suggesting that the Warriors crew think he should be fired, the NBA champion managed to get under Kerr’s skin. And now, this would be the latest in their back-and-forth. We can’t be sure if it’s going to be the last, though.\n\nJefferson’s stint with the Warriors\n\nRichard Jefferson was acquired by the Dubs in 2012, and they sent Stephen Jackson the other way to the San Antonio Spurs. In the one year Rich spent with them, he averaged 3.1 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 0.6 assists per game, playing around 10 minutes on average per game. But his best time in terms of stats would be the time with the Jazz.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRead More: NBA Champion Takes Credit for Stephen Curry and Warriors’ Glorious Dynasty: Exploring the Truth Behind Bold Claim\n\nOf course, his earlier games showcase better scores. But in his journey toward the eventual championship, Utah has the better stats. Getting to play 27 minutes per game, he had 10.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, and 1.6 assists per game. His time with the Mavs got him the honor of wearing Kobe Bryant’s number 24 for the last time before it was retired.\n\nAnd finally, two seasons with the Cavaliers led to Jefferson’s championship. The 2016 season for the Cavs was a crucial time period. The 3-1 deficit would have swallowed the team whole if it wasn’t for their historic game 7 comeback.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nEven though Richard’s time with the Warriors did not mark anything remarkable, it certainly paved the way for better things."
