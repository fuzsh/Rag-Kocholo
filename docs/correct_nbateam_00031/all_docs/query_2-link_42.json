The forward announced late Wednesday night that he had agreed to terms on a two-year contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers after playing an integral role in the city of Cleveland winning their first title in any professional sport in 52 years last month when they defeated the Golden State Warriors in a thrilling seven game series.\n\nAccording to The Vertical's Chris Mannix, the pact is worth $5 million and will push Jefferson’s career earns to over $109.5 million when this contract expires after the 2017-18 NBA season.\n\nIn a very appropriate move for the modern world in which we live, Jefferson announced his new contract himself over his Snapchat account. Kenny Ducey of Sports Illustrated got the screen capture below.\n\nJefferson, who just turned 36, had a resurgent season this past year and played a surprisingly key role for the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals. After the series ended, he initially said he would likely retire this off-season but apparently has had a change of heart and will look to get the Cavaliers back to the NBA Finals for the third straight year in the 2016-17 season.\n\nAfter being drafted with the 13th overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft out of the University of Arizona, Jefferson immediately made the NBA Finals in his second and third seasons but fell short to the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio Spurs each time on basketball’s biggest stage. He didn't make it back to the Finals stage until last month, six teams and 13 years later.\n\n\"He's a true professional, and a guy who is seizing an opportunity and moment to be in this position,\" LeBron James said to ESPN after the Cavs beat the Warriors to cut their series deficit to 2-1. \"The last time he was in the Finals was his first and second year in the league (in New Jersey), and I think he's not taking this moment for granted.\n\nJefferson has also been very impactful at his alma mater, the University of Arizona. After the Wildcats hired head coach Sean Miller, Jefferson donated $3.5 million to build a practice facility that now bears his name and has helped Arizona keep pace in the modern day arms race within college athletics. He completed 2.5 years of school before leaving Arizona after his junior year, but plans to finish his degree upon completion of his NBA career, whenever that may be.\n\nOverall, Jefferson averaged 5.5 points and 1.7 rebounds in 74 regular season games with the Cavaliers. In his 21 playoff games, he averaged 5.4 points and 3.4 rebounds per game and played inspired defense against the 73-9 Warriors and their numerous offensive threats.\n\nThis signing also continues the growing trend of athletes announcing their news, with the infiltration of social media into our everyday lives. Kevin Durant announced his signing to the Warriors via Player’s Tribune and now Jefferson has broken his own news via his Snapchat channel. It also marks the first time that he has played two seasons in a row for the same since 2011, when he finished his second season with the San Antonio Spurs."
