        "text": "CLEVELAND — Stephen Curry found his long-range touch and scored 38 points, Klay Thompson added 25 and the Golden State Warriors moved within one win of defending their title by beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 108-97 in Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday night.\n\nCurry had scored just 48 total points in the first three games, but the two-time league MVP made seven 3-pointers and Thompson, his Splash Brother, drained four 3s as the Warriors took a 3-1 lead in the series.\n\nGolden State, which made history with a 73-win regular season, can become the seventh franchise to win consecutive titles with a victory in Game 5 on Monday night at rip-roaring Oracle Arena, where they won the first two games by a combined 48 points.\n\n\"Work's not done, obviously,\" Curry said. \"I'm glad I showed up a little bit, but we're not done. We've still got some work to do.\"\n\nAfter blowing out the Warriors by 30 in Game 3, the Cavaliers had a chance to even the series. However, LeBron James and Co. didn't enough to contain Curry, Thompson or Harrison Barnes, who made four 3s and added 14 points.\n\nThe Warriors made an NBA Finals-record 17 3-pointers.\n\nKyrie Irving scored 34 points for the Cavs, who will need much more in Game 5 or they'll finish as runner-up to the Warriors for the second year in a row.\n\nJames added 25 points, 13 rebounds and nine assists, but the superstar also had seven turnovers and was too passive at times. Kevin Love returned to the lineup after missing Game 3 with a concussion and added 11 points off the bench.\n\nCleveland, which came in 8-0 at home in the playoffs, went 6:36 without a field goal in the fourth quarter, the kind of scoring drought no team can afford against the potent Warriors.\n\n\"A lot less breakdowns than what we had last game,\" Curry said. \"We checked the 3-point line and it was just all-around communication, toughness and effort.\"\n\nWith Golden State leading 88-84, Curry got loose for a backdoor layup and Barnes followed with a dagger 3-pointer, deflating a crowd of 20,000-plus fans clinging to hope that this would be the year Cleveland would win its first pro sports championship since 1964.\n\nBut this seems to be the Warriors' year from start to finish.\n\nOff the mark in the first three games, the Splash Brothers found the pool in the third quarter.\n\nThompson made four 3-pointers and Curry knocked down three from behind the arc as the pair combined for 19 of Golden State's 29 points in the period. Their arrival was a welcomed relief for the Warriors, who had managed to bury the Cavs in the first two games despite minimal production from their two stars.\n\nBut with Golden State's golden season being threatened again, Curry and Thompson stepped up the way they did in the Western Conference finals.\n\nWhen James was introduced before the game, he went through his usual handshake ritual with his teammates before telling Irving, \"Be special.\"\n\nThe point guard was terrific, but Curry and Thompson were just better.\n\nUnlike in Game 3, when they fell into an early hole and never recovered, the Warriors came out strong and stayed step for step with the Cavaliers.\n\nCurry made three 3-pointers in the first half, with his last one giving Golden State a three-point lead. With the Warriors up 42-41, Curry drove to the basket but had his shot blocked by Irving, sending Cleveland's bench and crowd into a frenzy.\n\nThe Cavs closed the half with an 8-2 run highlighted by Tristan Thompson dribbling in circles before making a turnaround jump shot from the corner, not the shot the Cavs were looking for but were happy to accept.\n\nThere were 15 lead changes in the opening half, which ended with Warriors assistant coach Luke Walton getting a technical foul after complaining that there should have been a foul called on Andre Iguodala's shot to end the half.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nWarriors: Thompson wore a wrap on his left leg for protection and support following his Game 3 run-in with Cavs C Timofey Mozgov. ... Surprisingly, one of coach Steve Kerr's first substitutions was James Michael McAdoo, who had not played a single minute in the first three games. ... C Anderson Varejao, who spent 11 seasons with the Cavs before he was traded in February, had three offensive rebounds and made two free throws during a four-minute stretch late in the third quarter.\n\nCavaliers: Love came off the bench for the first time since 2010 with Minnesota. His return didn't have everyone excited. After he went through a rigorous pregame workout along with assistant coach James Posey, Love ran off the floor, where a Cleveland fan had a stern message for him. \"Toughen up, Love,\" he hollered. ... Two coaching giants were among the courtside celebrities. Ohio State's Urban Meyer sat near Cleveland's bench while Pep Guardiola, the Spanish soccer coach taking over at Manchester City after three years with Bayern Munich, wore a No. 23 Cleveland jersey."
