My decision to move on from basketball and the tragic passing of Big Rich. The support of my family and friends have been huge. This video was taken after he bbq‚Äôd for about 20 people, something he would do a few times every summer. All I would do is tell people that I was having people over to my house and the next question was ‚ÄúIs Big Rich on the grill?‚Äù He really was a true OG. I‚Äôm going to miss all his one-liners, his cooking and his ability to make a whole room laugh. Until next time!!!! #RIPPLAYAPLAYA #tripleOG PAPA REALLY WAS A ROLLING STONE!!! üòÇüòÇ‚úäüèΩ"
