        "text": "The Warriors have shown a serious interest in Gay, but their preference to have either small forward Richard Jefferson in the deal (two years, $21 million remaining) or center Andris Biedrins (two years, $18 million) are seen as dealbreakers. Still, the Warriors’ impassioned interest in Gay coupled with the affordability and Grizzlies’ interest in rookie small forward Harrison Barnes makes the situation worth watching. The talks continue to be exploratory in nature for the most part, but the significant level of interest in Gay may prompt the Grizzlies to deal him.\n\nAccording to several people with knowledge of the Grizzlies’ plan who spoke to USA TODAY Sports, they are actively calling teams all around the league to gauge the market value of several of their players, in part, as a way of learning what their new assets are truly worth to other teams. They are, in essence, playing catch-up in this information game that is so crucial to a team’s ability to make the most intelligent and efficient moves possible. The people spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of trade talks. But rival executives have indicated that the Grizzlies are discussing Gay above the rest of the Grizzlies and making it clear that he’s attainable for the right price. The growing sentiment around the league is that Gay is likely to be moved before the Feb. 21 deadline, and it’s highly likely they would demand a starting small forward in return.\n\nThere are indications that the new Grizzlies management team is considering trading Gay — the player who was once seen as the centerpiece of the franchise’s future. But he swears he’s not concerned with the notion that he may leave the only NBA team he has ever known. “It doesn’t bother me,” Gay told USA TODAY Sports of the revelation first made public by Grantland’s Zach Lowe in a Jan. 4 article that he was being discussed with other teams. “It’s not the first time. It’s the league. It’s my seventh year in the league and I’ve pretty much seen everything. If I haven’t seen it, I’ve been a part of it. It’s nothing new. “I’ll be me there (at his possible new team). You are what you can do. Wherever I am, I can be me. As much as you want to be together (as a team), it’s up to the organization whether they want to keep you. For me, I think I owe it to my teammates to play like I play and not be bothered by it. ”\n\nWhile Phoenix, Golden State, Sacramento, and Denver are known to have discussed Gay with the Grizzlies, a person with knowledge of the situation said that Toronto is also very interested in Gay. The talks with the Suns – which were first reported by Yahoo! Sports – are still ongoing and the Grizzlies have expressed interest in small forward Jared Dudley as well as the Suns’ future first round picks. The Raptors’ and Warriors’ situations remain viable, while the talks with the Kings and Nuggets appear to be fruitless. The Dallas Mavericks – who are currently 13-22 and so badly in need of starpower beyond the aging Dirk Nowitzki – are not currently pursuing Gay, according to a person with knowledge of their dealings. The Raptors are widely known to be shopping former No. 1 pick, center Andrea Bargnani, but the Grizzlies may be pursuing point guard Jose Calderon in light of the fact that they are known to be looking for a more suitable backup than Jerry Bayless for point guard Mike Conley.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors, by contrast, have definitively decided to make a real run at Gay. The Raptors might not be able to swing a deal for him. But they’d love to. Sources told ESPN.com this week that the Raptors — who tried to make a play for Gay before the 2012 NBA Draft — remain seriously “interested” in the Grizzlies’ leading scorer and are trying to assemble trade packages to bring the 26-year-old to Toronto after preliminary talks with Memphis."
