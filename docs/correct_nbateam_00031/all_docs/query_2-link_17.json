        "text": "Well, you turned out to be right. You guys made the Finals the first two years of your career. What sticks out to you about that? For a lot of rookies, that is certainly not the case. Richard Jefferson: “I think what sticks out to me most is the teamwork. I just saw a stat the other day — now that I’m in broadcasting everyone wants to use highlights and numbers — but we were the first team ever to make it to the Finals without someone averaging 15 points a game in the season. We had seven guys average between nine-to-14 points. We would have on a given night anywhere from seven-to-eight guys in double figures. It was just a purely team effort. I saw how a locker room, and how important everyone is, from top to bottom to do their job. It was a lot of valuable lessons for me my first couple of years.”\n\nYou also got to play on the Warriors team when they had Mark Jackson and a younger Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green. Did you see this young core back then evolving into this? Richard Jefferson: “I wouldn’t say that I saw them evolving into this. A lot of things went right for this to happen. If you would’ve told me those guys with Klay, Steph, and Draymond, that they’d win a championship in three-to-five years, I wouldn’t have batted my eye at that. Right? Their best players all work hard they’re professionals, they take care of their body and have been around the block. Their families come from — Klay and Steph — both their dads had played in the NBA, and they were really just good dudes. Now, obviously the dynasty and the way they’ve done it, that’s a different story.”\n\nRichard Jefferson: My high school team was named the Rockets. They were the Rockets. I was like, “This is meant to be. I’m really excited. This is awesome. I’m in the Western Conference.” Then, 15 minutes later, they’re like, “Oh, hey, you’re traded to New Jersey for Eddie Griffin.” I remember talking to Byron Scott, the Nets coach, and I was depressed immediately. I had no idea who was on New Jersey. I didn’t know anything about them. I knew they were basically the Clippers of the Eastern Conference, except L.A. at least had “L.A.” on their jerseys.\n\nRichard Jefferson: Pop rules with an iron fist, as he should. There’s a high level of expectation. Your brain gets so mind-f—ed on the things that they want you to focus on that you almost forget to shoot. It was an eye-opener. Before that, even on good teams I played for, it was like, “I’m one of the best players. If I go under a screen when I’m not supposed to, you’re not going to take me out because I average 23 points a game.” Pop didn’t care if you averaged 20 points a game. If you went under a screen that you weren’t supposed to, he was calling a timeout, cussing you out and probably sitting you down.\n\nRichard Jefferson: My favorite thing to do was to dunk on people. Alonzo Mourning. Chris Bosh. Nenad Krstic. Shelden Williams. Kevin Willis. Mark Madsen. Jonas Valanciunas. I would search those out. When I would see new big men come into the league, my favorite thing was to try and get ’em. I could have an open 3, and I would slow down my pump-fake to pull in a defender just so I could go get that big. Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Edy Tavares. Klay Thompson. It was just so much fun, and I was extremely blessed to have such a good string of health that it allowed me to do it in latter parts in my career. When I dunked on MKG, I just put him in a body bag, and I was 34 years old.\n\nRichard Jefferson’s focus has shifted. When he talks about working on his efficiency, he means the ability to communicate clearly in short soundbites with a slow, easy cadence. “I watch games now with a completely different mindset,” Jefferson told CBS Sports. “I don’t necessarily always watch basketball games to see what’s going on with the basketball game. I watch basketball games to listen to how Mark Jackson speaks or Reggie Miller or Chris Webber. What can I take from them? Listening to their timing, figuring out what I would say and how I would say it in those moments. Very similar to a kid who’s watching his favorite basketball player and then going out in the park and trying to emulate that move.”\n\nWhen did you first start thinking about what you’d do when you stopped playing? When did you start really taking this seriously? R.J.: In Golden State, I think my 12th year in the league, I started thinking about it. Once you get to double digits, you kind of start looking around. I was the oldest guy on that team and that was Year 12. And I had a really bad back that year, didn’t play much, but I found joy in mentoring the young core: Steph [Curry] and Klay [Thompson] and Draymond [Green] and Harrison [Barnes] and Kent Bazemore. I found joy in it."
