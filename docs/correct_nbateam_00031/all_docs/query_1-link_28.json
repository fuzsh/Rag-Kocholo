        "text": "Former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson had some very accurate analysis while watching the 2019 Western Conference Finals.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the series and flexed their muscles along the way.\n\nPortland repeatedly jumped out to big leads over Golden State. However, those leads quickly evaporated as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson dominated in familiar fashion.\n\nThat level of domination led to a hilarious series of tweets from the retired Jefferson.\n\nCheck the time stamps on those tweets.\n\nThe first tweet was sent out during Game 2, which the Warriors won 114-111.\n\nJefferson sent the second tweet out during Game 3, which Golden State took by a score of 110-99.\n\nAnd the third tweet came during Game 4, which the Warriors won 119-117 in overtime to book their fifth straight trip to the NBA Finals.\n\nJefferson certainly knows a thing or two about how dangerous the Warriors can be. As a former member of the Cavs, the 17-year pro faced the Warriors in both the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals.\n\nHe also spent parts of two years playing in Golden State alongside Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\n\nLast year was Jefferson’s final year in the league, but he’s certainly staying in the conversation through tweets like these."
