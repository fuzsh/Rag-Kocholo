        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio -- LeBron James and Kyrie Irving each scored 41 as the Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Golden State Warriors, 112-97, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals on Monday night at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif. Klay Thompson scored 37 for the Draymond Green-less Warriors.\n\nThe Warriors lead the series, 3-2. Game 6 is Thursday night at The Q.\n\nHere is a capsule look at the key aspect(s) of the game, which was televised by ABC:\n\nHard to believe, but true: LeBron has won at least one road playoff game in 26 consecutive series, extending his NBA record.\n\nLet it marinate.\n\nNot this time: The Warriors had been 7-1 in closeout games in the past two postseasons, including 4-0 at home.\n\nKing and KI in absolute beast mode: LeBron and Irving simply refused to allow their team to lose the NBA Finals in five games.\n\nIt might happen in six or seven, but it was not going to happen in five.\n\nAccording to Elias, LeBron and Irving became the first teammates to score 40+ in a Finals game.\n\n(By the way: It is past time to stop referring to a \"Big 3'' in Cleveland, at least for this series. Kevin Love seemed out of place for the majority of his 33 minutes en route to two points, three rebounds, two blocks, one assist and four fouls. Don't be fooled by Love's +18 -- he was a passenger on a tour bus.)\n\nIt is difficult to fathom that a player who amasses 41 points (on 16-of-30 shooting), 16 rebounds, seven assists, three steals and three blocks in 43 minutes of an on-the-brink Finals road game could be \"overshadowed.'' But LeBron didn't mind if he was.\n\nIrving's 41 resulted from a Kyriediculous shooting display. He was 17-of-24 from the field, using almost every Uncle Drew move and shot in his repertoire to turn inside-out a terrific defense. Among the players who could not stop him were the Splash Brothers, Thompson and Steph Curry.\n\nOh, by the way: Irving had six assists, three rebounds, two steals and one block and posted a well-earned +20 in 40 minutes.\n\nIrving, in particular, thrived in transition and off screen action, against which Golden State suffered uncharacteristic breakdowns. But LeBron and Irving deserve plenty of credit for having the skills to help force Golden State into those breakdowns.\n\nLeBron, speaking with ABC reporter Doris Burke on the court after the game, said of Irving's performance: \"That was special. That was special. That will go down among the all-time greatest performances in Finals history ... He was spectacular.''\n\nIrving scored 30 in a Game 3 victory and 34 in a Game 4 loss. According to ESPN Stats & Info, he became the first teammate of LeBron to notch three straight games of 30+ points in the playoffs.\n\nDialed-in from deep: LeBron and Irving's 82 would not have been possible by attempting to score on drive after drive after drive. Golden State's defense, even without Green, is too good for that.\n\nLeBron and Irving needed to make plenty of jumpers, and they did so. The list included nine 3-pointers; Irving was 5-of-7 and LeBron 4-of-8.\n\nRemarkable: LeBron and Irving scored or assisted on 97 points. In a playoff game at Oracle.\n\nHow heavy was their lifting? The only other Cav to score in double figures was J.R. Smith with 10 -- all in the first quarter.\n\n(The importance of Smith's 10 cannot be overstated. The Cavs needed to stay connected in the first quarter to an opponent that was itching to blow the roof off \"Roaracle'' en route to a clinching blowout. In part because of Smith, the Cavs trailed by just three (32-29).\n\nMilestone Man: LeBron, who entered averaging 31.9 points in elimination games, became the ninth NBA player with 1,000 points in the Finals.\n\n20+ vision: LeBron has scored 20+ in 174 playoff games.\n\nQuotable: Cavs forward Richard Jefferson, to ESPN host Scott Van Pelt: \"We're basically fighting for plane trips.''\n\nReality of the situation: The Warriors remain in control, and they have history on their side. Teams that led, 3-1, in the NBA Finals have never lost the series (32-0).\n\nThe Warriors don't need to panic in the wake of the Game 5 defeat because of the historic nature of what LeBron and Irving did. It will be challenging for one, let alone both, to replicate.\n\nAnd the Warriors know that they will have Green back for Game 6. Green was suspended by the NBA for Game 5 because of an accumulation of flagrant-foul points.\n\nTo his credit, Warriors coach Steve Kerr did not take the excuse-bait dangled several times by Bay Area reporters in his postgame presser. Those reporters desperately wanted Kerr to rail against the injustice of having been without Green, and how things would have been so much different with him. Kerr essentially gave them the Heisman."
