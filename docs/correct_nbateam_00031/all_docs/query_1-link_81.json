        "text": "The 2016 NBA season was one for the ages. It had so many historical moments that for some, it was one of the greatest in the history of the Association.\n\nA lot of that can be credited to the Golden State Warriors. They broke the record for most wins in the regular season (73-9), dethroning Michael Jordan's legendary Chicago Bulls.\n\nMore than that, they were able to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Western Conference Finals, knocking down the Oklahoma City Thunder before Kevin Durant's infamous decision to join them.\n\nBut, for Richard Jefferson, there's just no way that the Thunder lost that series, as he recently said while discussing with Gilbert Arenas:\n\n“We should have been playing y’all in the 2016. We should not have been playing the Golden State Warriors. Yeah, Klay had a great Game 6 and all that stuff. But dog like, y’all let that s**t go. We thought 100% you guys were the better team, the more rested team, you had a 3-1 lead. You had to beat them one time, and it wasn’t all Russ’ fault. I’m not blaming it on Russ, but there was just too many times where it was turnovers or like mistakes that you’re like ‘dude, you guys are too great to let this slip through your fingers’,\" Jefferson said.\n\nTo be fair, perhaps it was for the best that the Warriors made it to the NBA Finals. At the end of the day, that laid the ground for the Cleveland Cavaliers to win one of the most epic championships of all time.\n\nThe Cavs became the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals, putting the cherry on top of the sundae for a season we'll remember until the end of time."
