        "text": "\"The Warriors have such a bright future!\"\n\nAs long as you don't look at their payroll.\n\nAfter Andris Biedrins' agent announced that he would opt in for next season at $9 million, Richard Jefferson's agent confirmed to CSN Northwest that he will also opt in, this one for $11 million.\n\nNot to anyone's surprise, Golden State Warriors forward Richard Jefferson will exercise his player option for the 2013-14 season and become an unrestricted free agent after the season concludes, his agent Todd Eley of Stratosphere Sports conveyed to CSNNW.com.\n\n“Richard has exercised his option to include the 2013-14 season in his current contract,” Eley said.\n\nvia Warriors F Jefferson opts in final year of deal | CSN Northwest.\n\nSo that's $20 million dollars of cap space, gone. The Warriors have both Jarrett Jack and Carl Landry, key contributors who are free agents. They had a terrific run in these playoffs, but their future isn't terribly bright for improvements, short or long term. They clear a mammoth amount of space in 2014, but then they'll have to re-sign Andrew Bogut and start looking at extensions for Klay Thompson and then Harrison Barnes soon after. The Warriors' braintrust will have its hands full trying to keep this team in contention, let alone taking a step forward."
