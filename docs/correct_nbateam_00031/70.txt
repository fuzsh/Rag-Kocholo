Former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson had some very accurate analysis while watching the 2019 Western Conference Finals.

The Golden State Warriors swept the Portland Trail Blazers in the series and flexed their muscles along the way.

Portland repeatedly jumped out to big leads over Golden State. However, those leads quickly evaporated as Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson dominated in familiar fashion.

That level of domination led to a hilarious series of tweets from the retired Jefferson.

Check the time stamps on those tweets.

The first tweet was sent out during Game 2, which the Warriors won 114-111.

Jefferson sent the second tweet out during Game 3, which Golden State took by a score of 110-99.

And the third tweet came during Game 4, which the Warriors won 119-117 in overtime to book their fifth straight trip to the NBA Finals.

Jefferson certainly knows a thing or two about how dangerous the Warriors can be. As a former member of the Cavs, the 17-year pro faced the Warriors in both the 2016 and 2017 NBA Finals.

He also spent parts of two years playing in Golden State alongside Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.

Last year was Jefferson’s final year in the league, but he’s certainly staying in the conversation through tweets like these.
