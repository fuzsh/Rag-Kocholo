In addition to her sisters,Faiza, Faika, and Fathiya, and her brother, Farouk, she had twohalf-siblings from her father's previous marriage to Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi.Â Â»\n\nMarriage to Shah of IranÂ :\n\nÂ\n\nPrincess Fawzia of Egypt andSudan married Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1919â1980), the Crown Prince of Iran, in Cairo, on 16 March 1939;after their honeymoon, the wedding ceremonies were repeated in Tehran.

After the birth of the coupleâs only child, Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi, Queen Fawziaâthe title of empress was not yet used in Iran at that timeâobtained anEgyptian divorce in 1945, whereupon she moved to Cairo. This divorce was notrecognized by Iran, however, and eventually an official divorce was obtained, in Iran, on 17November 1948, with Queen Fawzia reclaiming her previous distinction of Princess of Egypt and Sudan. A major condition of the divorce was that herdaughter be left behind to be raised in Iran. Curiously, Queen Fawziaâs brother, King Farouk, divorced his first wife, Queen Farida, the same week.\n\nBritish PathÃ© News announces Royal Marriage of Shapour Mohamed Reza Pahlavi to Princess Fawzia:\n\nBritish Gaumont News - Shahpour Mohamed Reza Pahlavi and Bride Leave Egypt for Iran:\n\nIn the official announcement of the divorce, it was stated that âthe Persian climate had endangered thehealth of Empress [sic] Fawzia, and that thus it was agreed that the EgyptianKingâs sister be divorced.â In another official statement, the Shah said thatthe dissolution of the marriage âcannot affect by any means the existing friendly relations between Egypt and Iran.\n\nGaumont British News: Royal Wedding - Shah and Fawzia Arrive in Iran:\n\nGaumont British News: Birth of Shahnaz Pahlavi:\n\nMarriageto Colonel Ismail Hussain Shirin Bey\n\nOn 28 March 1949, in Cairo, Princess Fawzia married Colonel Ismail Hussain Shirin Bey, (1919â1994), a distant cousin and one-time Egyptian Minister of War and the Navy.
