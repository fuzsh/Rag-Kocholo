        "text": "(click on the picture)\n\nJean Dominique (Giovanni Domenico)\n\n(1625-1712)\n\nAstronomer, first Director of Paris Observatory. *\n\nCassini, a native of the County of Nice, is one of the greatest astronomers of his time, and the creator of French astronomy, \" the one who picked up the torch of Astrophysics, fallen off Galileo's hands\" (Paul Couderc).\n\nHe was born, on June 8, 1625, in Perinaldo, at that time in the Nice County, dependent of the Duché of Savoie-Piemont, and today in the Ligurian province of Imperia (Italy). After his studies at the Jesuit College at Genoa, he was named professor at the University of Bologna in 1651.\n\nHis first observations were devoted to the Sun, and carried out with the meridian line, that he had built in San Petronio church.\n\nHis results obtained from 1656 to 1659, made him famous as a mathematician and as an astronomer.\n\nHe gave a new value of the inclination of the ecliptic of 23°29' 15 ' ( the best at his time!), a table of the atmospheric refractions that remained the most accurate for over a century, and he confirmed that the orbital velocity of the Earth was not uniform, in line with Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The latter went against aristotelician physics that assumed uniform movements in the sky.\n\nHe was sent to Pope Alexander VII, by the Senate of Bologna to arrange the difficulties that had arisen between Bologna and Ferrara about the navigation and of the courses of the rivers Po and Reno(1657-59), later on he was named superintendant of the fortifications of Fort Urban and of the fortress of Perugia(1663), and then he was delegated for solving the problems about the course of river Chiana, alternate affluent of the Tiber and Arno(1663-67), which brought into conflict the Pope and the Grand Duke of Tuscany.\n\nAll this time, he continued his astronomical work, and devised a method for the determination of longitudes through observing the solar eclipses (1661), the publication of which was censored by the Inquisitor of Modena. It will be published later in France (1670).\n\nUsing one of the first simple long focal lenses, manufactured by Giuseppe Campani, he turned to the study of planets.\n\nHe discovered the shadows of Jupiter's satellites on that planet, which one took for spots, and deduced their rotational period; he observed an \"exceptional\" spot (the Red Spot), that he called the \"big permanent spot\" and which enabled him to evaluate Jupiter's rotational period (9h56')(1665). He noticed the flatness of the disc and started to draw up tables of Jupiter's satellites(1668), for the determination of longitudes, which will be improved in France (1693). He also evaluated Mars's rotational period (24h40) (1666) and tried to find the more tricky one of Venus (23h20')(1667).\n\nWith all this work Cassini became famous beyond the limits of Italy.\n\nLouis XIVth, who wished \" to make France as well flourishing and illustrious by the letters as it was it by the weapons\", entrusted his minister Colbert with inviting him to join the recently formed Royal Academy of Sciences, and urging him to come to Paris, at the Observatory which was in construction.\n\nThe Pope (Clement IX) , his employer agreed to lend him to France, temporarily.\n\nCassini reached Paris in April 1669, and two years later, he went to live in the Observatory. In 1673, at his request he obtained the French nationality. He never returned to Italy, except for personal trips, or observations. The same year he married Genevieve de Laistre, daughter of the Count de Clermont's lieutenant-general, who was a King's adviser, and bought the castle of Thury, near Beauvais, which became his family residence and whose area was crossed- amazingly!- by the Paris meridian.\n\nAs soon as Cassini arrived at the Observatory, he began a series of observations of the lunar surface which was to lead to the realization of an Atlas (1678), a large Map(1692), and to a theory of the libration and three laws of the Moon rotation, that bear his name.\n\nAt the same time as Richer in Cayenne(1672), he observed the planet Mars at Paris Observatory , and thanks to his excellent tables of refractions, he measured the Mars parallax and deduced from it the Sun parallax to 9' ' 5 (correct to within 8 °/° ). This value increased considerably the scale of the solar system (1674), and gave to Jupiter and Saturn huge sizes. One still find the echo of that event seventy years later, in the Voltaire's Micromégas.\n\nBut, above all, his name remains associated with the planet Saturn.\n\nHuygens had discovered the first Saturn satellite, Titan (1655). Hardly settled at the Observatory, Cassini discovered two others, Iapetus(1671) and Rhea(1672), then he discovered that the breadth of the ring was divided into two parts, now known as 'Cassini's Division'(1675), he saw for the first time, a cloudy strip parallel to its equator (1677), the flatness of the disc and two other satellites, Dione and Thetys (1684).\n\nFinally, he suggested that the ring, considered as solid, could be formed \" of a swarm of very small satellites with various motions that cannot be seen separately\" (1705).\n\nThis opinion was not adopted, even though it was reformulated in the XVIIIth century by Thomas Wright and despite Laplace's mathematical theory of a subdivision in many narrow rings. The Huygens' hypothesis, of the solidity and flatness of the ring prevailed until the mid-nineteenth century.\n\nTo pay homage to him, the consortium ESA-NASA, called 'Mission Cassini,' the unit, including the spacecraft and the Huygens probe, launched in 1997, to reach the Saturn system in July 2004.\n\nWe also owe an important geographical work to Cassini . He took an active part in the measurement of the Earth, by extending the meridian line established from Paris to Amiens by Jean Picard, and he applied his tables of the Jupiter satellites to the determination of longitudes.\n\nCivil and Jesuit missionaries came to the Observatory to be trained to his method of observation of the eclipses of the Jupiter satellites, and sent to him the results of their observations made in Africa, America or China. Cassini marked them on a large \" geographical drawing \", a planisphere of 7,80 meters in diameter, a pen-and-ink sketch on the ground of a tower of the Observatory. Thus, the longitude of the far-off countries could be corrected of more than 20° and that of France of almost 3°.\n\nAccording to his contemporaries, Cassini \" the Great\" had a calm and gentle character, a warm nature and a happy and sharp mind. He knew how to interest the King and his court in his work, and to assert himself by his talent and qualities of organizer, among renowned astronomers such as Jean Picard, Christian Huygens, Olaüs Römer, Giacomo Felippo Maraldi, Philippe de La Hire, who were sometimes called the \"Paris school\" with Cassini as leader.\n\nEndowed with a sound constitution, he could carry on his research until 1711, when he became blind completely, and died in Paris Observatory , on september 14th of the following year, being 87 years old.\n\nHe gave birth to a dynasty of astronomers and Cassini's name remained attached to the history of Paris Observatory during more than one century.\n\nThe CASSINI's dynasty\n\nJean Dominique(Giovanni Domenico), or Cassini I (1625-1712) (1669-1712) **\n\nJacques, or Cassini II (1677-1756) (1712-1756)\n\nCésar François Cassini III of Thury, (1714-1784) (1756-1784)\n\nJean Dominique Cassini, or Cassini IV(1748-1845) (1784-1793)\n\n* Jean-Dominique and Jacques were never appointed as director of the Paris Observatory. The first to be designed was César-François, on November 12, 1771. But Cassini I is worth to be called a director, in regard with the part he plaid in the developments of the French astronomy and the fame he brought to the Paris Observatory\n\n** The underlined dates correspond to years spent as leader or director of the Paris Observatory.\n\nRaymonde BARTHALOT\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nReferences :\n\nJ.D.
