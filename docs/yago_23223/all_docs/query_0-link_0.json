        "text": "Egyptian princess\n\nDominique-France Loeb-Picard (born 23 November 1948),[1] also called Princess Fadila of Egypt, is the French ex-wife of Fuad II, former King of Egypt and the Sudan.\n\nLife and family\n\n[edit]\n\nDominique-France Loeb-Picard was born on 23 November 1948 in Paris as the daughter of Jewish-Alsatian archaeologist Prof. David-Robert Loeb and his French-Swiss wife, Paule-Madeleine Picard. Aged 29, as a student at the Sorbonne, Fadila wrote her doctoral thesis on the psychology of women in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.[2]\n\nMarriage and divorce\n\n[edit]\n\nLoeb-Picard met and began a courtship with deposed king Fuad II; they contracted a civil marriage on 16 April 1976 in Paris, followed by a religious wedding in Monaco on 5 October 1977. Although she married Fuad II long after the loss of his throne, she was still styled as Her Majesty Queen Fadila of Egypt by monarchists.[3]\n\nFadila choose a Turkish yashmak as her bridal headcraft, symbolising her conversion to her husband's religion.\n\nThe marriage ended in divorce in 1996, and afterwards she was styled as Her Royal Highness Princess Fadila of Egypt.[citation needed] In 2002, her apartment in Paris was taken from her due to her outstanding debts. [4] The marriage was dissolved in 2008, and her royal style and title were removed by Fuad II.[citation needed]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nShe and Fuad II have three children:[citation needed]\n\nMuhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id (born 5 February 1979)\n\nPrincess Fawzia-Latifa of Egypt (born 12 February 1982)\n\nPrince Fakhruddin of Egypt (born 25 August 1987)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]"
