        "text": "Your challenge is to have a restored Pharaonic Egypt exist after 1900. At the very least Egypt must be a monarchy using the official title of Pharaoh or it's monarch. Reviving aspects of Ancient Egyptian culture, language, architecture and fashion will give bonus points. Reviving the Ancient Egyptian religion in Egypt will give massive bonus points.\n\nDifficult, the Pharaoh for all (or perhaps because of) the 'ancient Egypt' hype would seem like a heathen to many Muslims. It's be worse than France going monarchist and declaring said monarch to be the 'Sun King'.\n\nGoing to be hard with a POD after 1900.\n\nMaybe prevent the 1952 coup. King Farouk abdicates later and his son takes the throne 1970ish?\n\nIf Faud II still marries Dominique France-Picard, maybe Faud liberalizes Egypt similar to Turkey. Dominique converts from Judaism to Islam and assumes her title, queen Fadila of Egypt. They make peace with Israel.\n\nEgypt's tourist industry booms. Some tour guides wear ancient Egyptian outfits to add to the realism of their tourist experience.\n\nWith reviving the religion. Egypt is Islamic with smaller christian populations. I dont think locals would convert from Islam or Christianity. So perhaps some visiting tourists stay longer term and establish little village communes. These settlers revive the ancient Egyptian religion within their community. King Faud II allows them to stay provided they keep to themselves.\n\nTheir little communities perform regular historical reenactments. and build their villages in the style of ancient Egypt. They give King Faud II the nickname, 'Pharaoh'.\n\nShoshana\n\nWhat if they go fascist? Of course, that wouldn't mean the majority of the population would worship the Egyptian pantheon, but a few hardcore party members might.\n\nI like this direction.\n\nGoing to be hard with a POD after 1900.\n\nMaybe prevent the 1952 coup.

Of course, that wouldn't mean the majority of the population would worship the Egyptian pantheon, but a few hardcore party members might.\n\nNope. No way. No how.\n\nIslam is death on apostasy, literally, and any leader who visibly converted away from Islam (certainly to anything pagan) would have a life expectancy measured in minutes. OK, maybe hours.\n\nI don't see how the original Egyptian religion can come back at all by this point, sorry. However, perhaps a concept of anti-Arabism/pro-Coptism can become the national ethos via a sort of inversion on Nasser's Pan-Arabic rhetoric and philosophy? I'm not sure it'll mean all that much in terms of language, et. al. but it could lead to a resurgence in national pride as being something apart from those \"nomad savages\" or some other such thing. It's not as if Islam = total Arabic identity, just ask Iran or Indonesia.\n\nASB. The Pahlavis fell in Iran because a good deal of Iranians thought he was trying to take the country back to its pre-Islamic culture. Any Egyptian leader who intentionally chooses to resort to pre-Islamic Egypt would also be overthrown.\n\nBesides, the term Pharaoh has negative connotations as a result of Islam and Christianity.\n\nWell, there's Egypt's successor state, the megacity of Luxor in Judge Dredd, where the city is encased in a glass pyramid. The Luxor Judges are highly draconian: lawbreakers who aren't simply killed are imprisoned in a maze underneath the Sphinx, then executed after their sentence is over. The Judges pride themselves that this approach makes Luxor one of the safest megacities in the world. The city and its Judges borrow the iconography and religious practices of Ancient Egypt (though most people worship the single god \"Yad\"). Senior Judges and the wealthy can be mummified. So in this case, all you needed for a restored Pharanoic-ish Egypt was a devastating global thermonuclear war, in addition to the rest of the craziness in Dredd.\n\n\"Pharoanism\" was in fact an influential ideology in Egypt in the 1920's and 1930's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaonism It emphasized the continuity of Egyptian history, and de-emphasized its links with the Arab world, despite its being an Arabic-speaking nation. But I don't know that its adherents ever favored renaming the King (\"Malik\") the Pharaoh, and they certainly did not propose abandoning Islam.\n\n\"Pharoanism\" was in fact an influential ideology in Egypt in the 1920's and 1930's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaonism It emphasized the continuity of Egyptian history, and de-emphasized its links with the Arab world, despite its being an Arabic-speaking nation.

But the more radical the Pharoahnism, the shorter the regime lasts.\n\n\"Pharoanism\" was in fact an influential ideology in Egypt in the 1920's and 1930's. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharaonism It emphasized the continuity of Egyptian history, and de-emphasized its links with the Arab world, despite its being an Arabic-speaking nation.
