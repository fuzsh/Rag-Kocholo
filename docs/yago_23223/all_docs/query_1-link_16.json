        "text": "He was the Sultan and later King of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur. The ninth ruler of Egypt and Sudan from the Muhammad Ali Dynasty, he became Sultan of Egypt and Sudan in 1917, succeeding his elder brother Sultan Hussein Kamel. He substituted the title of King for Sultan when the United Kingdom formally recognized Egyptian independence in 1922.\n\nPrior to becoming sultan, Fuad had played a major role in the establishment of Cairo University. He became the university's first rector in 1908, and remained in the post until his resignation in 1913. He was succeeded as rector by then-minister of Justice Hussein Rushdi Pasha. In 1913, Fuad made unsuccessful attempts to secure for himself the throne of Albania, which had obtained its independence from the Ottoman Empire a year earlier. Fuad also served as President of the Egyptian Geographic Society from 1915 until 1918.\n\nFamily\n\nFuad was born in Giza Palace in Cairo, the seventh son of Isma'il Pasha. His mother was Farial Kadin. As a great-grandson of Muhammad Ali Pasha, Fuad was of Albanian descent. He married his first wife in Cairo, 30 May 1895 at the Abbasiya Palace in Cairo, 14 February 1896, H.H. Princess Shivakiar Khanum Effendi (1876-1947). She was his cousin and the only daughter of Field Marshal H.H. Prince Ibrahim Fahmi Ahmad Pasha. They had two children, a son, Ismail Fuad, who died in infancy, and a daughter, Fawkia. Unhappily married, the couple divorced in 1898. During a dispute with the brother of his first wife, Fuad was shot in the throat. He survived, but carried that scar the rest of his life.\n\nFuad married his second wife at the Bustan Palace, Cairo, 26 May 1919. She was Nazli Sabri (1894-1978), daughter of H.E. Abdu'r-Rahim Pasha Sabri, sometime Minister of Agriculture and Governor of Cairo, by his wife, Tawfika Khanum Sharif. Queen Nazli also was a maternal granddaughter of Major-General H.E. Muhammad Sharif Pasha, sometime Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and a great-granddaughter of Suleiman Pasha, a French officer in Napoleon's army who converted to Islam and reorganized the Egyptian army. The couple had five children, the future Farouk I and four daughters, the Princesses Fawzia (who became Queen Consort of Iran), Faiza, Faika, and Fathiya. As with his first wife, Fuad's relation with his second wife was also stormy. The couple continually fought; Fuad even forbidding Nazli from leaving the palace. When Fuad died, it was said that the triumphant Nazli sold all of his clothes to a local used-clothes market in revenge. Fuad died at the Qubba Palace in Cairo and was buried at the Khedival Mausoleum in the ar-Rifai Mosque in Cairo\n\nMarriages\n\n1.Shivakiar Khanum Effendi (1876-1947)\n\nChildren\n\n* Ismail Fuad (1896-1896)\n\n* Fawkia (1897-1974), who became the mother-in-law of Gloria Guinness\n\n2.Nazli Sabri (1894-1978)\n\nChildren\n\n* Farouk I (1920-1965)\n\n* Fawzia (born in 1921) (Queen Consort of Iran)\n\n* Faiza (1923-1994)\n\n* Faika (1926-1983)\n\n* Fathiya (1930-1976)\n\nTitles\n\n* 1868-1917: His Highness Ahmed Fuad Pasha\n\n* 1917-1922: His Highness Fuad I, Sultan of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur\n\n* 1922-1936: His Majesty Fuad I, King of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur\n\nHonours:\n\n* Order of Nobility, 1st Class of the Ottoman Empire-1893\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus of Italy-1911\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer of Greece-1912\n\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB)-1917\n\n* Imperial Order of Persia-1919\n\n* Commander Grand Cross of the Order of Vasa of Sweden-1921\n\n* Grand Cross w/Collar of the Order of Charles I of Romania-1921\n\n* Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum of Japan-1921\n\n* Knight of the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation of Italy-1922\n\n* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Renaissance of the Hejaz-1922\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Aviz of Portugal (GCA)-1923\n\n* Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion-1925\n\n* Grand Collar of the Order of the Supreme Sun of the Kingdom of Afghanistan-1927\n\n* Grand Collar of the Kingdom of Albania-1927\n\n* Royal Victorian Chain (RVC)-1927\n\n* Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour of France-1927\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of Leopold (Belgium)-1927\n\n* Grand Cordon of the Order of Oumayyad of Syria-1927\n\n* Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle of Poland-1932\n\n* Knight of the Order of the Seraphim of Sweden-1933\n\n* Knight of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri of Siam-1934\n\n* Knight of the Order of the Elephant of Denmark-1935\n\n* Grand Collar of the Order of the Crown of Iran-1935\n\nWikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuad_I_of_Egypt\n\nList of monarchs of the Muhammad Ali Dynasty: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_monarchs_of_the_Muhammad_Ali_D...\n\nH.M.
