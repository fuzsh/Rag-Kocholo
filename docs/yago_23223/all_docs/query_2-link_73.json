        "text": "You’ve probably heard it before. “How do you make a small fortune in wine? You start with a big fortune.” Looking at the list of France’s riches people, this seems to be only partially true. Many of France’s wealthiest persons or families own vineyards. However, there are only a few who have become wealthy thanks to their winemaking. In this article we look at who on France’s Rich List also own vineyards.\n\nMany of France’s wealthiest people own vineyards. Some have made their fortune in wine, but this is unusual. Some have had inherited vineyards as a part of the family fortune. Others have invested in it as one of many businesses they are involved with, and yet others have what you could call “trophy vineyards” (like the ugly expression “trophy wife” – some have both). Why not, if you can afford it, one might ask. One reason to invest in a vineyard can, of course, also be to benefit from some of the tax advantages it offers.\n\nThis is a longer version of an article published on Forbes.com.\n\nIt almost seems to be a hobby of the rich to collect famous wine estates. It even seems to be a bit of a competition between them. Several of the richest names own top chateau in Bordeaux that are almost neighbours. In Burgundy one after the other of the biggest fortunes have invested in vineyards. Here is also where one the allegedly most expensive vineyard land transactions have taken place, when a few hectares were bought for a reported 34 million euro per hectare.\n\nIt is not always easy to know if the rich do own vineyards. Sometimes, it is declared in annual statements; sometimes, it is well-known, but in many cases, those with a fortune don’t necessarily disclose details of what they own. So the listings below are partially hard facts, partially estimates.\n\nTop wine fortunes – The Wine Rich List\n\nOf the biggest French family fortunes, only one is dominated by its wine activity, number five on the Rich List. This single (debatable) exception is Pierre Castel who thus tops the Wine Rich List.\n\nPierre Castel – one could question this since a big part of the fortune is not wine (e.g. beer in Africa). Would require more investigation.\n\nBernard Magrez – also a debatable case, the origin of the fortune is to a large extent in spirits. But today very focussed on wine.\n\nFrédéric Rouzaud – champagne and other wine\n\nCorinne Mentzelopoulos – today, a Bordeaux wine business but the origin of the fortune was grocery stores and real-estate\n\nJean-François and Jean Moueix – Bordeaux\n\nFrançois Faiveley – Burgundy\n\nJean-Jacques Frey – a question-mark, to what extent is this still a real-estate fortune? Today a fairly divers vineyard holding but most importantly Bordeaux\n\nAlexandra and Stéphanie de Nonancourt – Champagne\n\nGérard Perse – today wine focussed, Bordeaux, but the origin was supermarkets\n\nBertrand de Villaine – Burgundy\n\nBollinger – Champagne\n\nCarol Duval-Leroy – Champagne\n\nJean-Hubert Delon and Geneviève d’Alton – Bordeaux\n\nJean-Michel Cazes heirs – Bordeaux\n\nDenis Merlaut and the Villars family – Bordeaux\n\nChristian and Edouard Moueix – Bordeaux\n\nBruno and Marie Borie – Bordeaux\n\nde Boüard de Laforest – Bordeaux\n\nLalou Bize-Leroy and Perrine Fénal – Burgundy\n\nPaul-François Vranken – Champagne\n\nPhilippe Castéja – Bordeaux\n\nMarcel Guigal – Rhône\n\nGilles de Larouzière and the Henriot family – perhaps, but are they now Pinault shareholders?\n\nAlain Thiénot – Champagne\n\nManoncourt – Bordeaux\n\nAlfred Tesseron – Bordeaux\n\nPhilippe Cuvelier – an office supplies fortune, sold off and invested in wine in Bordeaux\n\nPol-Roger and de Billy family – Champagne\n\nJean-Charles and Nathalie Boisset – Burgundy\n\nJoseph Helfrich and Gunther Bimmerle – a recent wine fortune mainly focussed on mid-market and budget wines from many origins\n\nIsabelle Roch and the heirs of Charles Roch and Henry-Frédéric Roch – Burgundy\n\nThis is then the full list of wine-dominated fortunes in France according to my estimates.\n\nThe Wine Fortune list (or Wine Rich List) is obviously very focussed on Bordeaux with 15 mentions and Champagne with 7 mentions, and to a lesser extent Burgundy with 5 mentions but three of them relating to the same property. Just two has another base: one in the Rhône Valley and one based in Alsace but focussing more on mass-market wines.\n\nThis could be further analysed into more detailed categories to understand where wealth comes from in wine, for example “those who have created a fortune with wine” and “those who have inherited and are wealth managers”. Another interesting slicing would be “fortunes based on soaring land prices” (probably most of the ones on the list).\n\nValuation\n\nMaking a valuation of a fortune is not an easy task, so thank you for the great job of the journalists at Challenges Magazine in France. In some cases it is fairly straight-forward, especially when it is question of people who own a stake in publicly listed companies.\n\nBut many of the “wine fortunes” must be very difficult to estimate. For example, how do you estimate a fortune that is to a large extent based on owning, say, Chateau Margaux in Bordeaux? There is no real market value for this prestigious almost 100-hectare estate. But one can of course say that a hectare of Margaux vineyard costs around 1-3 million euro per hectare and since this is the most prestigious one, at the upper end or even more. Even more difficult: Domaine de la Romanée Conti in Burgundy that owns perhaps ten of the most exclusive grand cru hectares in Burgundy. There is nothing to compare with, not at all like in Bordeaux. Perhaps one can say “the most expensive land transaction in Burgundy was – it is said – at 34 million per hectare and the DRC hectares must be way beyond that”. That is probably how they do. (But even at that price, it would be small change for France’s richest person.)\n\n9 (5) – Pierre Castel & family\n\n14 bn euro.\n\nThe first on the list whose primary business is drinks, although a large part is beer in Africa. He started out as negociant in Bordeaux but then branched out into a very successful business in Africa with big beer production. Today, one of the world’s biggest wine producers. The patriarch, Pierre Castel, is currently famously involved in an unpaid tax claim in Switzerland.\n\nThey are more famous for their medium to low-end wines than famous estates. Their brands (fully or partially owned) include Barton & Guestier (Bordeaux), Patriarche (Burgundy), Listel, Kriter, Société des vins de France, Barrière (Bordeaux) and others.\n\nThey have interest in (or own) more prestigious properties through Castel Chateaux & Grands Crus. Some of the more famous being: Chateau Ferrand, Chateau d’Arcins, Chateau Beychevelle (co-owner?), Château Barreyres, Château Tour Prignac and several others. Co-owner of Château Beaumont… The have owned Château Tour-Saint-Christophe, Château Tour-Musset and Château-Haut-Caplane. They may still own them or not. To verify.\n\nThey also own the chain of wine shops called Nicolas.\n\n27 (10) – Ariane de Rothschild & family\n\n4.9 bn euro.\n\nThe Franco-Swiss branch of this banking family heading Groupe Edmond de Rothschild. Interest in or ownership of e.g. Château Clarke, Château des Laurets, Flechas de los Andes, Rimapere (NZ), Rupert and Rothschild Vignerons (South Africa), Champagne Barons de Rothschild, Akaura (Central Otago), Macán (Rioja). Possibly some interest in Château Lafite Rothschild, as well as others.\n\n30 (11) – Ginette Moulin & family\n\n4.5 bn euro.\n\nGaleries Lafayette fortune with some prestigious vineyard interests in Bordeaux: Chateau Beauregard, Château Petit-Village, Château Pavillon Beauregard.\n\n32 (12) – Marc Hériard-Dubreuil & family\n\n4.3 bn euro.\n\nThe family controls the Rémy Cointreau group, which is focussed on spirits but includes some wine, notably the recently acquired Champagne Telmont (previously De Telmont).\n\nAfter the top ten\n\nAs you can see in this top-ten list, few, if any, have built their fortune on wine. For that, you will have to go further down in the ranking, where some family fortunes do stem from wine. You could argue that the first one on the list after this top-ten, who built his fortune on wine, is Bernard Magrez (nr 116, 1.15 bn euro), but that is only partially correct. Today, he owns many chateaux in Bordeaux, but the origin of the fortune is, to a large extent, spirits. Then we have Eric and Robert de Rothschild a few notches further down (nr 118, 1.1 bn euro), owners of Chateau Lafite, but they also have big stakes in the finance business.\n\n75 (19) – Jean-Pierre et Edith Cayard and family\n\n1.5 bn euro\n\nOwners of La Martiniquaise, one of the world’s biggest spirits companies, including a dominant position in Calvados I believe, with wine interests mainly focussed on mass-market brands: Porto Cruz, “the best-selling port brand worldwide”, Quinta de Ventozelo (Douro), Perlino (Prosecco), Cruz Espumante, Dauré vin doux naturel, a brand called “Kir Royale”… And also, the chain of wine shops Repaire de Bacchus (with a much better selection of wines than the other wine shop on this list, Nicolas), and the online shop Wineandco.\n\n75 (20) – Christopher Descours and family\n\n1.5 bn euro\n\nThe EPI holding includes several luxury brands, and also some wine: Charles Heidsieck and Piper Heidsieck in Champagne, Biondi-Santi and Isole e Olena in Tuscany, Tardieu-Laurent (Rhône), Château la Verrerie (Luberon)…\n\n75 (20) – Frédéric Gervoson and the Chapoulart and Gervoson families\n\n1.5 billion euro\n\nA fortune built on marmalade and fruit juice (Andros). Owner of Chateau Larrivet Haut Brion.\n\n21 to 30\n\nGetting closer to “real” wine fortunes\n\nSo far, we have mainly seen fortunes based on other businesses than wine that have also invested in some wine estates, in many cases because it is something that the owner feels passionate about (on top of managing the fortune). Moving down to number 21 and further, some of the fortunes are in fact more focussed on wine, but far from all. Wealthy French people (as of all nationalities) like their vineyards.\n\n87 (22) – Le Lous family\n\n1.4 bn euro\n\nA pharma and health-care fortune (Urgo) that also owns a wine estate in Bordeaux: Chateau Cantenac Brown.\n\n93 (23) – Edouard Carmignac and family\n\n1.3 bn euro\n\nA finance fortune that bought Domaine de la Courtade on the Ile de Porquerol some years ago.\n\n116 (24) – Bernard Magrez\n\n1.15 bn euro\n\nBernard Magrez owns many wine chateaux in Bordeaux as well as in Provence, Rhône, Languedoc and abroad, over 40. The most famous one is Chateau Pape-Clement, followed by, for example, La Tour Carnet, Fombrauge, Clos Haut-Peyraguey, Château La Tour Carnet, Château Les Grands Chênes, Château Moulin de Noaillac, Château Moulin d’Ulysse, Château Hauterive and many others. Today, Bernard Magrez Grand Vignobles is very focused on wine, but the origin of the fortune is in spirits, with the company/brand William Pitters (whisky and other spirits) that he founded in 1964 and later sold. In Spain: Marques de Oro, Temperancia and others; Argentina: Ariès, La Bienvenida; Chile : Leyenda, Serenida and others ; Brazil : Brilho ; Japan : Magrez-Aruga; Morocco: Excelcio, Kahina; Portugal: Ariela; Uruguay: Elegancia; California: Première; Italy: I’mani and more…\n\nAs you can see, even if Pape-Clément is the star of the collection, the bulk of it is much humbler names.\n\n178 (30) – David and Edouard de Rothschild and family\n\n725 M euro\n\nA smaller interest in Rothschild & Cie, like the relatives Eric and Robert de Rothschild above.\n\n31 to 40\n\nA handful of – nowadays – wine-focussed fortunes\n\nIn this section, between thirty and forty, we have a few more “real” wine fortunes, where the activity is actually focussed on wine, even if at least some of them started as a business of another typ. It must be quite hard to estimate the value of these fortunes since much of it is based on assumptions of land value and brand value. How, for instance, can one put a number on the value of the grand cru hectares owned by the DRC?\n\n182 (32) – Olivier Halley and family\n\nA retailing fortune (Promodès, Carrefour) that owns a few wine estates: château de Meursault and châteaux de Marsannay. They previously owned Château la Dauphine in Bordeaux.\n\n195 (33) – Olivier Bertrand\n\n675 M euro\n\nA restaurant fortune that bought Clos de Nonville in 2021, just an hour south of Paris. Perhaps it will soon be served in the group’s restaurants? (Burger King, Hippopotamus, Chez Léon…)\n\n214 (34) – Jean-François and Jean Moueix and family\n\n625 M euro\n\nMajority owners of Château Pétrus (Pomerol, Bordeaux) and owners of the Duclot négociant through the holding Videlot.\n\n217 (35) – Jean-Etienne and François Matton and family\n\n600 M euro\n\nThe family was previously the owners of Château Minuty in Provence. It has been sold to LVMH, as one of the transactions contributing to the rapid rise in vineyard prices in Provence (and the disappearance of many great red and white Provence wines). The family is still shareholders.\n\n217 (35) – Hervé Vinciguerra\n\n600 M euro\n\nWith his company Alix Investment, he was co-owner of Chateau d’Esclans together with Sacha Lichine but sold his stake to … LVMH. I don’t know what his current wine investment is. Perhaps LVMH?\n\n240 (38) – Pierre Gattaz and family\n\n550 M euro\n\nAn industrialist with a fortune based on electronics. He has bought a wine property, Château de Sannes in Luberon.\n\n240 (39) – Patrick Teycheney\n\n550 M euro\n\nA fortune built on retirement homes although he is actually a winegrower’s son. He owns a few wine properties: Châteaux Fleur de Lisse, Château L’Étampe and Château Gaillard in Bordeaux, and an old family property Château La Loubière through the holding Vignobles Jade.\n\n259 (40) – Jean-Jacques Frey\n\n535 M euro\n\nA real-estate fortune that has been diversified with a few wine properties. First Champagne Henri Germain, then Champagne Ayala (later sold to Bollinger – one of them or both? Don’t know), Mumm, Perrier-Jouët also sold rapidly, part owner of Billecart Salmon. I don’t know if he still retains any champagne interests (I am guessing not). Best known for Chateau La Lagune and later Paul Jaboulet Ainé (Rhône), both managed by his daughter Caroline Frey. And finally, Château de Corton-André in Burgundy.\n\n51 to 60\n\nAlmost only wine business fortunes\n\nBetween 51 and 60 we a lot of family fortunes currently involved with wine (with one exception). That is a bit surprising, since even with “only” 300 million euros you could easily afford to buy one, or even a few, very good properties as trophy wineries. Why are there so few trophy wineries in this tranche? Perhaps the reason is that these more “modest” fortunes don’t attract as much media attention as the super-rich so it is less well-known what wine interests they have?\n\nPerhaps you can contribute some knowledge of people owning vineyards in this tranche?\n\n352 (51) – Christophe Gruy and family\n\n360 M euro\n\nA construction and real-estate fortune that also includes Chateau de la Chaize, a very big estate (300 ha) in Beaujolais since 2017.\n\n380 (52) – Hugues Souparis\n\n340 M euro\n\nAn industrial holding (Enowe) that recently (spring 2023) bought a the legendary Irouléguy wine property Domaine Brana.\n\n380 (52) – Jean-Michel Cazes (died on June 23, 2023) and Sylvie Cazes and family\n\n340 M euro\n\nOwners of Chateau Lynch-Bages as well as numerous other wine estates: Chateau Haut-Batailley, Chateau Ormes de Pez, Domaine des Sénécahaux (Chateauneuf-du-Pape), Domaine de l’Ostal (Languedoc), Roquette & Cazes (Douro), Michel Lynch…\n\n437 (68) – Alfred Cointreau and family\n\n290 M euro\n\nHas inherited a 4% stake in Rémi Cointreau, the company that one of his forefathers once co-founded, that includes some wine stakes (see above).\n\nA special mention:\n\n440 (NA) – Patrick Ballu and family\n\n285 M euro\n\nAs far as I know, Patrick Ballu does not own any vineyards or wine company. But he gets a special mention here because his fortune comes from making vineyard equipment. His father is said to have invented the “enjambeur” (straddling tractor) and today Excel Industries makes a wide range of vineyards and winery equipment.\n\n441 (69) – Alfred Tesseron and family\n\n280 M euro\n\nFor several generations a cognac family, the origin of the fortune, they now own Chateau Pontet-Canet. The also own Pym-Rae in Napa Valley, after having bought Villa Sorriso, previously owned by Robin Williams. Another branch of the Tesseron family owned Chateau Lafon-Rochet until recently (2021) when it was sold to Lorenzetti (see that entry).\n\n448 (70) – Eric de Turckheim\n\n275 M euro\n\nA commodity trading-based fortune, and ophthalmology. Part owner of Domaine Près Lasses and château d’Autignac in Languedoc.\n\n71 to 76\n\nThe end of the French 500-Rich List, with one of the few who built his fortune in wine in modern times\n\nIn the last section, 71 to 76 we also have mostly wine fortunes and not so many trophy wineries. As mentioned above, I suspect this is not a true picture but one du to that media focuses a lot on the very biggest fortunes and finds all tiny details about them, where for the “smaller” fortunes at the end of the list media does not look to much in detail on if someone owns vineyards.\n\nInterestingly, here we also have one of the few fortunes that has been built from scratch with wine, and even more remarkable, one that is not focussed on the prestigious regions and famous brands but more on mass-market wines, nr 76.\n\n461 (71) – Philippe Cuvelier\n\n260 M euro\n\nA fortune that stems from office supplies (Guilbert). After selling the group to PPR in 1998 he invests in Bordeaux estates: Clos Fourtet, Château des Grandes Murailles, Clos Saint-Martin, château Côte de Baleau in Saint Emilion, and château Poujeaux in Moulis.\n\n464 (71) – Pol-Roger and de Billy Family\n\n255 M euro\n\nThe two families own Champagne Pol-Roger.\n\n466 (73) – Jean-Charles and Nathalie Boisset and family\n\n250 M euro\n\nThey own the negociant and wine holding Grands Vins Jean-Claude Boisset. Brands included in their house: Domaine de la Bougeraie, Jean-Claude Boisset, J Moreaux & Fils, Labouré Roi, Louis Bouillot, Alex Gambal, Bouchard Aîné & Fils, Ropiteau & Frères, Antonin Rodet, Château de Pierreux, Mommessin, all in Burgundy; Domaine Maire & Fils in Jura; Bouachon, Bonpas and Gabriel Meffre in the Rhône valley; Fortant in Languedoc; Charles de Frere and Haute Couture sparkling; Deloach Vinyards, Buena Vista, Raymond Vineyards, Lockwood Vineyards, Amberhill and Lyeth Estate in California; Villa Moncigale in Provence.\n\n466 (73) – Sophie Defforey and family\n\n250 M euro\n\nDaughter of one of the Carrefour founders. Has taken a stake in the Rhone wine producer and négociant M Chapoutier. (Chapoutier was once on the list himself.) As far as I know, no other wine interests.\n\n466 (73) – Pierre and André Richard and family\n\n250 M euro\n\nA distribution and supplies for cafés fortune (you have surely seen “Café Richard” in a café in France). Owns Chateau la Nerthe in Chateauneuf-du Pape, most famous, but also Château Escalette, Château Gantonnet, Château Victoria, Château Bourdieu-Vertheuil and Château Barbe in Bordeaux, Château de Corcelles and Château des Tours in Beaujolais, and, of course, the distribution business Richard Vins & Spiritueux.\n\n489 (76) – Joseph Helfrich and Gunther Bimmerle\n\n240 M euro\n\nOwners of Grands Chais de France (Groupe GCF), France’s biggest wine exporter and one of the biggest wine companies. Owns some 3500 ha vineyards. Better known for their branded mass-market wines: JP Chenet, Grand Sud, Calvet, Divine, Arthur Metz… But they also own a number of estates: Domaine Sainte-Marguerite, Maison Klipfel, Clos Saint-Jacques, Domaine du Moulin de Dusenbach, just to mention a few in Alsace. They are present in the Jura, Burgundy, Rhone Valley, Provence, Languedoc, Bordeaux, Loire… Some more: Blanc Foussy (cheap Loire sparking), Carod (Clairette de Die), Chateau de Fesles (quite decent Loire wines), Chateau de la Tuilerie (Rhone), Domaine de la Baume, Maison François Martenont (Burgundy négociant), Danubiana (Hungary), Weinkellerei HXM Mainz, Moillard (Burgundy négociant). And, the quite excellent Chilean domaine Viña las Niñas in Cholchagua, recently bought (2022) from the three French founders.\n\nGoes to show that you do not need to focus on exclusive wines to make a fortune in wine. The group was founded in 1979.\n\n489 (76) – Isabelle Roch and the heirs of Charles Roch and Henry-Frédéric Roch\n\n240 M euro\n\nThey are cousins to Leroy and de Villaine (mentioned above) and have 25% of Domaine de la Romanée Conti, DRC. Also owns Domaine Prieuré-Roch that has some 20 ha in Burgundy.\n\nOf France’s 500 biggest fortunes, 77 are involved in wine, 15%. But only 31 of them have a majority of the business in wine, not more than 6%.\n\n— End of list —\n\nApologies to all concerned for errors or omissions!\n\nPlease post a comment for any correction.\n\nThank you to Challenges Magazine for creating the annual list of “France’s 500 richest people” on which this list is based.\n\nOther candidates for the “French wine Rich List”\n\nThere are some others who are not on this list but that could perhaps one day be included, or have (more or less) been there before. Here are a few in no particular order. (Again, “with family”.)\n\nBruno Paillard\n\nThe group Lanson BCC. Bruno Paillard founded Champagne Bruno Paillard in 1981. It also includes today Champagne Lanson, Champagne Chanoine Frères, Champagne Besserat de Bellefon, Champagne Boizel, Champagne De Venoge, Champagne Philipponnat, Domaine Alexandre Bonnet, Maison Burtin. Was previously on the 500 Rich List with 234 M euro in 2017.\n\nDaniel and Florence Cathiard\n\nOrignally professional skiers who built a sports retailing empire (Go Sport, founded in 1976, sold in 1990) that has transformed into a winery group: Château Smith Haut Lafitte, since 2020 an estate in Napa which I don’t know the name of (maybe not yet launched). Also Château Cantelys and Château Le Thil Comte Clary and co-owners of château Beauregard and Chateau Bastor-Lamontagne. They were previously on the 500 Rich List noted with 215 million euros in 2017.\n\nAnthony Barton family\n\nAnthony Barton was the owner of Chateau Langoa-Barton and Chateau Leoville-Barton. Anthony Barton died in 2022. Was previously on the 500 Rich List, noted as 180 million euros in 2017.\n\nHenri Lurton and the family of Lucien Lurton\n\nLucien Lurton was another of the great men of his generation in Bordeaux and another Lurton.

Was previously on the 500 Rich List, noted as 175 million euros in 2017.\n\nLouis-Fabrice Latour family\n\nLouis-Fabrice Latour died in 2022. He headed the big négociant Masion Louis Latour in Burgundy, also owning significant vineyards. Was previously on the 500 Rich List, noted as 175 million euros in 2017.\n\nMichel Chapoutier and family\n\nChapoutier is one of the big négociants of the Rhône valley, originally the north. They now own numerous vineyards and estates, including: Domaine de Bila-Haut, Dominio del Soto, Château des Ferrages, Domaine Roc Folassière, Dos Lusiadas, Domaine Tournon and others. Was previously on the 500 Rich List, noted as 170 million euros in 2017. Considering that Sophie Defforey has taken a significant stake in the company (see above) and they have fallen off the 500-rich list, I can’t help wondering if something has happened?\n\nBrice de la Monardière and the heirs of Anne-Claude Leflaive\n\nDomaine Leflaive is one of the most respected domains in Burgundy.
