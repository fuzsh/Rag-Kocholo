When a student of 29 she wrote her doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne on the Psychology of Women in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights.\n\nEngagement and marriage\n\nIn the royal palace of Monaco, she encountered and commenced a romantic relationship with HM King Fuad II, leading to their marriage on April 16, 1976, in Monaco. Despite marrying Fuad II following the loss of his throne, monarchists continue to refer to her as Her Majesty Queen Fadila of Egypt. The marriage ended in divorce in 1996, and since 1999 she is styled Her Royal Highness Princess Fadila of Egypt.\n\nDivorce and financial difficulties\n\nThe marriage was dissolved in 2008 with the style and title removed by Fuad. In 2002, her Paris apartment was taken from her due to her outstanding debts.\n\nChildren\n\nThey have 3 children:\n\nHRH Muhammad Ali, Prince of the Sa'id (born 5 February 1979).\n\nHRH Princess Fawzia-Latifa of Egypt (born 12 February 1982).\n\nHRH Prince Fakhruddin of Egypt (born 25 August 1987).\n\nTitles from birth\n\n1948-1976: Miss Dominique-France Loeb-Picard.\n\n1976-1996: Her Majesty Queen Fadila, The Queen of Egypt.\n\n1996-2008: Her Royal Highness Princess Fadila of Egypt."
