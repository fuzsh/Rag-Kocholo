        "text": "Josephte4 Noiret dit Picard (Andre3, Alexandre2, Alexandre1, Louis-1 Noiret) was born Abt. 1822, and died Aft. 1851. She married (1) Georges Vezina Sep 09, 1843 in St. Jean Baptiste, L'Orignal, Ontario, son of Louis Vezina and Marguerite Thecle Bordeleau. He was born 1822 in Neuville, Quebec, and died. She married (2) Henri LaLonde Feb 20, 1888 in St. Margaret of Scotland, Glen Nevis, Glengarry Co, Ontario. He was born Abt. 1822, and died.\n\nNotes for Josephte Noiret dit Picard:\n\nSource Family Contact:\n\nJosephte Noiret dit Picard was, I believe, the oldest child. Four of her brothers and sisters (at least) followed her into the South Plantangent, Prescott County area, of Ontario. This area was not developed, and many places went by the names of the Rivers that passed by the farms.\n\nSo many of us were lost on this \"Picard\" name, that when we found, with the help of researches in Hawksberry, Prescott, Ontario the connection with Noiret and Picard, it was a real blessing. The key was that even though the Census of 1851 in South Plantagent, Ontario listed Georges Vezina (Visinaw), and his sons Serphin (Vezina (Visinaw) they listed his wife as Josette Picard. However, we later learned that the record said Josette Picard(?). We did not know what this question mark meant. Then they found the marriage record and realized that her name was Noirette (Noiray) dit Picard. This opened up research for others who were Noirest or Noirettes, not Picard, and the family began to unfold.\n\nI do not know when or where she died. I know the family story, that when she did die, a local Catholic priest had written a testimony that she had no other children. This of course was not true, but Seraphin, her son, was living in the United States, and was distinherited from a farm etc. that should have been his. This was a conflict for quite some time. I do not know for sure the date or place of Georges Vezina's death either. I looked for both of them at St. Isidore in Prescott, Ontario, but without any luck. We had concluded that Josette (Josephte) must have remarried, but did not know for sure.\n\nMore About Josephte Noiret dit Picard:\n\nAka: Josephte Noiret\n\nName 2: Josehpte Noirette\n\nName 3: Josephine Picard\n\nName 4: Josette Picard\n\nName 5: Josette Noiret dit Picard\n\nDate born 2: Abt. 1825\n\nDate born 3: Abt. 1826\n\nDate born 4: Abt. 1827\n\nLocation: 1843, from River Delisle\n\nCensus: 1851, South Plantagent, Prescott Co, Ontario\n\nNotes for Georges Vezina:\n\nSource Family Contact:\n\nGeorge Vezina and Josette Picard are listed in the South Plantagent, Prescott County, Ontario Census for 1851.

About 1879, they moved to Cheboygan, Michigan with thier entire family.\n\nMy mother had known stories of Georges Vezina, since his son, her grandfather, Seraphin Vezina, had lived with various children and grandchildren (He died in his ninties). He stayed with my parents after their marriage in Auburn, Michigan. Seraphin would say in broken English \"I be the only son, but have 11 children\". After the death of his wife, Armena (Marie Lucia Heremine Parent), he was quite lost. He lived for over 30 more years as a widower, with his children in Afton, Michigan, and other places, looking after him. I have pictures of both of them. He had a ready smile, and his wife was considered quite brilliant (of course she is descendent is the descendent of Louis Hebert, Guillaume Couillard etc), and is of the oldest family of Canada.\n\nSource Family Contact:\n\nSt. Finnan's in Alexandria.
