King Fuad II of Egypt and The Sudan (Ahmed Fuad) was born on 16 January, 1952). He ascended the throne on 26 July, 1952 upon the abdication of his father King Farouk. He reigned for less than a year until 18 June, 1953. King Fuad II was modern Egypt's last monarch. He was overthrown when the monarchy and the aristocracy were abolished and an Republic of Egypt was proclaimed.

King Fuad II was less than a year old at the time of his ascension to the throne, thus, he was never formally crowned. He became king following the abdication of his father, King Farouk, and joined his family in exile in Italy. The Regent Council headed by Prince Mohamed Ali represented him in Egypt. King Farouk had hoped that his abdication would appease the anti-royalist forces in the country, and that the baby king could serve as a unifying force for Egypt. Both gambles proved incorrect.

After being deposed, King Fuad II was brought to the French Fourth Republic where he was to be raised. To this day former King Fuad II continues to live in France.

In 1976, the King married Dominique-France Picard (n√©e Loeb), the daughter of Robert Loeb and his wife, the former Paule Picard. She converted to Islam and assumed the title Queen Fadila of Egypt. The couple have three children. They divorced in 1996, and Fuad's former wife was to be styled Her Royal Highness The Princess Fadila of Egypt.
