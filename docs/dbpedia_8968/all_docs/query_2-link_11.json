        "text": "In part one, Xuan-zang the famous Buddhist monk of the 7th century who crossed from China to India encountered the first cities of the Silk Road, crossed the Gobi Desert, and avoided bandits and overbearing monarchs. In part two, Xuan-zang journeyed to the famous city of Kucha and climbed the mountain pass near Tengri Khan losing many people in the dangerous crossing.\n\nAs Xuan-zang traveled further and further west, he was leaving Chinese political influence and going further into areas comprised of steppe nomadic tribes such as the Turkic people, as well as sedentary Iranian people such as the Sogdians.\n\nBut let‚Äôs talk about Turkic people for a moment.\n\nAs we‚Äôve talked about in previous posts, the Silk Road was a fascinating mix of different cultures and people. This was very common in the nomadic world of the Eurasian Steppes because tribes were constantly moving around, encountering new tribes, subjugating new tribes, being subjugated by other tribes, or forming alliances. It was a very fluid, dynamic and extremely dangerous environment. We‚Äôve seen examples in past blog posts with groups like the Scythians and Parthians.\n\nThe Turkic people were another such group. Like many steppe tribes, their origins are very obscure, but they were caught up in this cultural soup, and over time grew and grew into more powerful tribal confederations. As they spread and intermixed with other steppe tribes, they also took on increasingly regional differences among each other.\n\nThus, the Turkish people of the Republic of Turkey (a.k.a. modern T√ºrkiye) and the Uyghurs of north-western China have common ancestry. Some of their ancestors migrated west and contended with the Eastern Romans (a.k.a. the Byzantines), while others fought with the Chinese Tang dynasty onward. Yet in some distant, remote past they began as just one steppe tribe out of countless others and over time grew into a family of ethnicities and languages that spread all over Asia.\n\nIn Xuan-zang‚Äôs time, the Turkic tribes had formed a powerful confederation on the Eurasian steppe called the Western Turkic Khaganate. They called themselves the On oq budun (ê∞Üê∞£:ê∞∏:ê∞âê∞Üê∞ëê∞£) or ‚ÄúPeople of the Ten Arrows‚Äù implying they were a federation of tribes, ruled by a single Qaghan (alternatively spelled Khaghan). These ‚ÄúG√∂kt√ºrks‚Äú, and their empire, remnants of an even larger Turkic Khaganate, were spread out far enough to have contact with China, the Sassanian Persians and Eastern Romans all at once.\n\nGreat Tang (e.g. Tang Dynasty China) would come to rule this entire area at the zenith of its power in the decades ahead, and the Khaganate reduced to a puppet state, but in Xuan-zang‚Äôs time, it was still a land ruled by Turkic people.\n\nMeeting the Khagan\n\nAs Xuan-zang and his party descended the Tian-Shan mountains they came near to the modern city of Tokmok in Kyrgyzstan. More precisely, Xuan-Zang came the ancient capital of Suyab, also called Ak-Beshim, just to the southwest. This region was fed by the Chu river and was a verdant land compared to the desert wastes elsewhere. The Khaganate used these lands as a resting place when not on the march.\n\nThe leader of the Khaganate, Tong Yabghu Qaghan (T«íng Y√®h√π Kƒõh√°n, ÁªüÂè∂Êä§ÂèØÊ±ó to the Chinese) was eager to meet Xuan-zang and provided a fitting welcome. Xuan-zang, for his part, gave the Qaghan a letter of introduction from the king of Turpan.\n\nXuan-zang described the Qaghan thus:\n\nTong Yabghu Qaghan‚Äôs ‚Äúpalace‚Äù was a great yurt, wherein a feast was held. The guests enjoyed such foods as wine, mutton, and boiled veal among other things. Since Xuan-zang was a Buddhist monk, he was forbidden to eat meat and drink alcohol, and thus he was served delights such as rice cakes, cream, mare‚Äôs milk, sugar, and honey instead.\n\nOnce everyone was settled down, Tong Yabghu Qaghan asked poor Xuan-zang to make a Buddhist sermon on the spot.\n\nXuan-zang had to be careful not to ruin the mood of the occasion, so he opted for a sermon on the need for goodwill (metta in Buddhism) towards all beings, and on the benefits of the religious life. The Qaghan was evidentially impressed. In fact, this wasn‚Äôt the Qaghan‚Äôs first encounter with a Buddhist monk. Apparently, some years earlier a Buddhist monk from India named Pabhakarmitras had journeyed through these lands on the way to China, and so the Qaghan was well-disposed to the religion. He even tried to convince Xuan-zang to stay among his people, but Xuan-zang declined. Unlike the king of Turpan, the Qaghan seemginly took no offense and offered to send a ethnically Chinese soldier to accompany Xuan-zang for part of the way.\n\nMore importantly, the Qaghan gave Xuan-zang both gifts and letters of introduction to share with the petty princes along the way, who were all vassals of the Qaghan.\n\nFinally, it was time to leave.\n\nTo Fabled Samarkand\n\nFrom the great yurt camp at Sayub, Xuan-zang was escorted by the Qaghan part of the way, but they eventually parted. After leaving the Chuy region, the land reverted back to desert, namely the Kyzylkum Desert, also known as the Desert of Red Sands. Xuan-zang‚Äôs party journey to the next city, the city of Tashkent (modern Uzbekistan) named Zhƒõsh√≠ (Ëµ≠ÊôÇ) in Chinese at the time, proved difficult, but they did eventually reach it after crossing the Jaxartes River. Of the crossing, Xuan-zang describes the scenery.\n\nXuan-zang does not seem to spend much time in Tashkent (I wasn‚Äôt able to find much description of his time in my limited resources), and continued on in a more Westerly direction towards Samarkand.\n\nFun fact, after crossing the Jaxartes river and passing Tashkent, Xuan-zang and his party entered into lands once ruled by the Bactrian Greeks. To the south and west of Tashkent was the former outpost city of Alexandria Eschate, which had been the most northerly city of the Greeks. It was a strong fortress city under king Euthydemus I, but suffered constantly attacks by the native Iranian Sogdian peoples. By the 1st century AD, the city had reverted back to local control, and the Greeks retreated from the area. By Xuan-Zang‚Äôs time this was all a distant memory.\n\nWe‚Äôll cover Samarkand in the next episode, because things take a dangerous turn in this output of the Sassanian Persians, and also from here, the road will turn back south toward India at last.\n\nIn part one of the journey, Xuan-zang braved the Gobi desert and contended with the overbearing monarch of Turpan, but also beheld many wonderful sites at that venerable city before moving on to Yanqi. After leaving Yanqi, Xuan-zang moved onto the city of Kucha, also called Kuchar in Uyghur (ŸÉ€á⁄Üÿßÿ±) or K√πchƒì (Â∫´Ëªä) in Chinese.\n\nThe Buddhist Kingdom of Kucha\n\nOut of all the cities of the northern Silk Road surrounding the Tarim Basin, Kucha was the largest and most prosperous. As a powerful Buddhist kingdom, Kucha dominated the Silk Road trade in the area since at least the 4th century. Xuan-zang‚Äôs description of the city was as follows:\n\nAs with prior cities, Xuan-zang‚Äôs reputation had proceeded him, and he was greeted by the local ruler, which described as having ‚Äúred hair and blue eyes‚Äù. The king of Kucha at the time was likely either ethnically Sogdian or Tokharian. We saw similar figures depicted in Buddhist art when we looked at the Bezeklik Caves in episode one. The Silk Road north of the Tarim Basin was a fascinating mix of different peoples and ethnicities and it could change from city to city. The Tokharians were distant relatives of other Indo-European people, and their language had some common elements to European languages such as English. Yet, the link between the Tokharians and Westerners is frankly pretty tenuous, but that did not stop researchers in the 19th century who had certain ‚Ä¶ racial theories, from hyping up their contribution to the Silk Road. It‚Äôs important to be cautious and not to draw too many conclusions. Hidden agendas make for bad research.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more interesting to me is how the Tokharians lived alongside totally disparate groups such as Chinese, Turks, Uyghurs, Sogdians and so on, and at times they had friednly co-existence (the Tokharians evidentially revered the Sogdians in particular and tried to emulate them), and at other times they clashed. In other words, pretty typical human stuff. This intermix of cultures and people is what makes the Silk Road so fascinating.\n\nBut I digress‚Ä¶\n\nKucha had a lively material culture, thanks to runoff from the Tian Shan mountains providing plenty of water, and thus a wealth of food and agriculture grew here. It‚Äôs place on the Silk Road also ensured plenty of goods and materials were traded here too. Further, Kucha was famed for its music, and musicians from Kucha were highly sought after. A Kuchean orchestra was staffed at the court of Great Tang throughout the dynasty, and played for official ceremonies and celebrations. My book on Xuan-zang points out that famous songs they played included titles like ‚ÄúThe Jade Woman Hands the Cup Around‚Äù, ‚ÄúMeeting on the Seventh Evening‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe Game of Hide the Buckle‚Äù.\n\nYet, for the Buddhist tradition as we now practice it today, Kucha was even more important for another reason: it was the hometown of KumƒÅrajƒ´va (344‚Äì413 CE) the translator.\n\nKumarajiva the Great Translator\n\nKumarajiva was the son of an Kashimiri-Indian father and a Kuchean mother, and was raised in Kucha. He studied Sarvastivadan-branch Buddhism, an influential pre-Mahayana Buddhist school whose monastic code was adopted by Mahayana Buddhist communities in China onward. However, at some point Kumarajiva converted to Mahayana Buddhism and by age 20 ordained as a Buddhist monk. His fame as a scholar reached China at the time, and he was sought out by the emperor. Our homeboy, Kumarajiva, was imprisoned at one point by a local warlord, but eventually was released by the Chinese emperor, and brought to the capitol of Chang-an (see prologue episode), and was feted.\n\nKumarajiva proved to be an excellent translator, and helped bring many Indian-Buddhists texts to mainsteam China. Because the Sanskrit originals were mostly lost in India, but preserved in Classical Chinese, these works, now core texts in many modern Buddhist traditions, help maintain the tradition today. To name a few that you probably already familiar with, Kumarajiva translated these sutras:3\n\nThe Lotus Sutra\n\nThe Amitabha Sutra (part of the 3 Pure Land Sutras)\n\nThe Diamond Sutra, important in the Zen tradition\n\nThe Shurangama Sutra, important in Chinese Buddhism, especially Zen\n\nThe Sutra of the Ten Stages (chapter 26 of the Flower Garland Sutra)2\n\n‚Ä¶. among many others.\n\nTo reiterate this point: the English translations of these texts we use today come from the Classical Chinese editions that were originally translated from Sanskrit and prakrits by Kumarajiva.\n\nHaving said all that, let‚Äôs return, centuries later to Xuan-zang‚Ä¶\n\nStaying at Kucha\n\nFrom Kucha, Xuan-zang would have to pass through Aksu before crossing over the Tian Shan mountains, but heavy snows in the passes mean that Xuan-zang had to stay in Kucha for two months. During this time Xuan-zang stayed out of trouble, and spent many days discussing Buddhist philosophy with the local community. This included the famous Kizil Caves:\n\nThe Kizil Caves (in Uyghur ŸÇŸâÿ≤ŸâŸÑ ŸÖŸâ⁄≠ ÿ¶€ÜŸä) or K√®zƒ´‚Äôƒõr QiƒÅnf√∫ D√≤ng (ÂÖãÂ≠úÂ∞îÂçÉ‰ΩõÊ¥û, lit ‚Äú1000 Buddhist Caves of Kizil‚Äù) are a massive cave complex and probably one of the earliest along the northern Silk Road used for Buddhist monasticism. The artwork here often shows strong influence from Buddhist-India, or more precisely, the Greco-Bactrian art of Gandhara. However, like the Bezeklik Caves we saw earlier, a combination of local religious iconoclasm, looting by European researchers,4 and subsequent tourism have greatly disturbed the artwork in the Kizil Caves. Here‚Äôs an example reconstruction from the so-called Peacock Room:\n\nIn any case, check out the Wikipedia article I linked above on the Kizil Caves. There‚Äôs simply too much to add here, but needless to say, Xuan-zang must‚Äôve beheld some amazing art in his time, which we will sadly never see again.\n\nSide note: the red haired, blue-eye ruler of Kucha that I mentioned earlier ran afoul of the Chinese emperor, Taizong, a few years later by pretending fealty, while also declaring his loyalty to the Western Turkic Khaganate (more on that soon). Needless to say, China did not take this lying down and soon conquered Kucha just as it did with Turpan. Xuan-zang would be long gone by this point though.\n\nThe Tian Shan Mountains\n\nOnce it was safer to travel, Xuan-zang‚Äôs caravan moved onto the city of Aksu, which in his time was called Baluka (Ë∑ãÁ•øËø¶, Bolujia in Chinese). Xuan-zang‚Äôs caravan was again ambushed by bandits along the way, but once again the bandits were full from another attack and quickly lost interest in Xuan-zang‚Äôs group. I‚Äôd say Xuan-zang was lucky, or the bandits were just lazy. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nAnyhow, Xuan-zang stated that Aksu was very similar to Kucha in many respects, though according to Wikipedia, Xuan-zang noticed that the people of Aksu seemed to speak a different kind of Tokharian language. The Wikipedia article on Tokharian mentions that there were several dialects, all of them pretty different from one another. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt seem that Xuan-zang stayed at Aksu too long though and set out for the mountain passes over the Tian Shan mountains to reach Tokmok. There things took a dangerous turn.\n\nThe Tian Shan mountains are huge, cold and dangerous to traverse. The Khan Tengri mountain is more than 23,000 feet high, and the Bedel Pass near it is one of the few ways to cross over to the other side. Of the mountain, Xuan-zang wrote:\n\nIt took eight days to traverse the pass, and Xuan-zang lost up to 30-40% of his men and countless horses and oxen. Imagine that famous scene from the movie Fellowship of the Ring when the good guys braved the mountain pass, but instead of turning back almost half the party freezes to death. That‚Äôs how serious it was.\n\nNonetheless, the survivors did reach the gorgeous lake of Issyk Kul, now in modern Kyrgyzstan. From here, the caravan would soon reach Tokmok and with it enter the lands of the powerful Western Turkic Khaganate‚Ä¶.\n\nStay tuned!\n\n1 Explained also in part one, the term Hinayana Buddhism is not related to Theravada Buddhism (it‚Äôs seems unlikely to me that they interacted with one another due to geography), but instead is a broad term for all pre-Mayahana Indian Buddhism. It‚Äôs still a somewhat pejorative term, but the relationship between early Hinayana Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism is ‚Ä¶ complicated and not necessarily antagonistic.\n\n2 I would love to talk about the Flower Garland Sutra some time, but it is a TOME, and I‚Äôve only read very small parts of it. The Sutra of the Ten Stages deserves special attention though, and I have read it, but it‚Äôs challenge all by itself to explain in a blog post. Maybe some day.\n\n3 one notable omission in this list is the Heart Sutra. The Heart Sutra is thought to have been compiled in China, not India, as a clever summary of much longer sutras. It gets to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the matter, if you take my meaning. Xuan-zang, as we‚Äôll see later, brings it back to India where it‚Äôs translated to Sanskrit, not from it.\n\n4 The story of Albert Gr√ºnwedel is an interesting example of someone who was a dedicated archeologist, but also kind of unhinged too.\n\nIn the prologue, we introduced the Buddhist monk Xuan-zang and explored the world of Tang-dynasty China. Xuan-zang left this world behind, contravening imperial decree about leaving the country without a permit, to pursue Buddhist teachings in India.\n\nHowever, once he left the Yumen Pass, he immediately ran into a major issue: the Gobi Desert.\n\nThe road from the Yuman Pass to the next stop, the oasis at Hami, was barren, dry, with extreme heat and cold, and not well marked. Xuan-zang, who had little experience with this kind of travel, at one point lost his waterskin, became lost, and collapsed due to exhaustion. It is said that the bodhisattva Guan-yin guided him in his darkest hour to Hami.\n\nThe Hami Oasis\n\nThe town of HƒÅm√¨ (ÂìàÂØÜ), also known as Kumul (ŸÇ€áŸÖ€áŸÑ) in Uyghur, was populated by a Chinese military colony since the Sui Dynasty, but had been cut off from China during turbulent times. At Xuan-zang‚Äôs time, it pledged loyalty to the regional Turk rulers while still maintaining diplomatic relations with the new Tang Dynasty. Some months after Xuan-zang left, Great Tang‚Äôs expansion absorbed Hami into its empire.\n\nHere in Hami, Xuan-zang stayed at a Buddhist monastery where three Chinese monks lived. They were overjoyed to see a fellow monk, and offered him lodging. Xuan-zang did not stay too long here, and moved onto the larger city of Turpan.\n\nThe King of Turpan\n\nThe city of Turpan (Uyghur: ÿ™€áÿ±ŸæÿßŸÜ) also called T«îl«îfƒÅn (ÂêêÈ≤ÅÁï™) in Chinese was a prosperous city since ancient times, and changed hands often, but since antiquity had a large Chinese community, and considerable Chinese cultural influence, especially compared to cities further west.\n\nThe King of Turpan at this time was a devout Buddhist, and gave Xuan-zang a warm welcome upon his arrival, but also pressured him to stay rather than continue his journey. When Xuan-zang politely refused, the King of Turpan begged, cajoled, and threatened him. Xuan-zang was not allowed to leave, and he resorted to fasting to make his point. The king relented, and got Xuan-zang‚Äôs promise that he would stay for a month to preach to the people of Turpan, and would return later upon his return trip.\n\nOnce this agreement was reached, Xuan-zang stayed as promised. He used this time to explore the area, including the ancient city of GƒÅochƒÅng (È´òÊòå), also known as Qocho, which was the former capital of a once-powerful kingdom, where he gave sermons to audiences there. Archeological excavations have show plenty of evidence of a vibrant Buddhist community at the time.\n\nXuan-zang also likely visted the nearby Bezeklik caves as well:\n\nThe Bezeklik caves are a massive grotto that served as a monastery for the local Buddhist monastic community. Many of the walls and ceilings were painted with frescoes of the Buddha, or other famous imagery, though in later generations, these were often defaced or damaged by locals for one reason or another (superstition, religious prohibition against human imagery, or simply raw materials).\n\nFurther, European archeologists looted the caves and brought many works of art back to Europe, only for them to be destroyed later in World War II. Thus, very little remains of the artwork now, but what does remain is simply spectacular, and a shining example of the fusion of cultures along the Silk Road at this time.\n\nOnce Xuan-zang‚Äôs month was completed, the King of Turpan made good on his word. He provided Xuan-zang with many goods, supplies and letters of introduction to the kings further along the road. He now traveled with a caravan toward the next city YƒÅnq√≠ (ÁÑâËÄÜ) known by many other names, including Karasahr (ŸÇÿßÿ±ÿßÿ¥€ï⁄æ€ïÿ± in Uyghur) or Agni from the old Tokharian name, but not before being robbed by bandits! Evidentially, the bandits had already killed and robbed an earlier caravan, and were content to be bribed by Xuan-zang‚Äôs party and left with no further violence.\n\nUpon reaching the city of Yanqi/Karasahr/Agni, Xuan-zang was said to have received a warm welcome, and described a city with ten different monasteries, and with two thousand monks practicing Hinayana Buddhism.1 He did not have flattering things to say about the king of Yanqi though, and later in 643 when the king broke his allegiance with Great Tang, the emperor Taizong, whom we met in the prologue episode, steamrolled Yanqi‚Äôs army and took the king prisoner.\n\nXuan-zang for his part only stayed for one night and moved on toward the city of Kucha. Kucha is an important city in early Buddhist history, but as we‚Äôll see in our next episode, it was caught in a game of political tug-of-war‚Ä¶\n\nUntil the next episode: the Western Turks!\n\n1 The term Hinayana is a loaded term in Buddhism, and frequently misunderstood. It has also been used as a pejorative by Mahayana Buddhists too. Without getting lost in the weeds, think of ‚ÄúHinayana‚Äù Buddhism as any pre-Mahayana Indian-Buddhist school. It is not the same as Theravada Buddhism (the other major branch of Buddhism) since both branches were geographically separate and had little interaction with one another.\n\nI had an idea recently while flipping through my book on the journeys of the Buddhist monk Xuan-zang (pronounced like ‚ÄúShwan-tsong‚Äù). Xuan-zang was the famous Buddhist monk who walked to India in order to bring back more information and texts in order to help develop Buddhism in his native China. In my old post, I covered some of the trials and tribulations of this amazing journey, and even made a fun song. However, looking back the post felt incomplete. I realized that many of these places that Xuan-zang traversed are obscure and forgotten now despite their central importance to Buddhist history, and the journey was so long that it‚Äôs too much to really explore in a single post.\n\nSo, this is the start of a series of posts meant to help retrace Xuan-zang‚Äôs journey, explore places of significance and how they tied into larger history. I don‚Äôt have a schedule yet (these posts take a while to write), but I am working on the next few drafts already.\n\nToday‚Äôs post is the prologue episode, covering China at this time, and why Xuan-zang left.\n\nQuick note: because this episode in particular uses a lot of Chinese names, for the sake of accuracy and modern readers, I am using the pinyin-style accent marks where relevant, and also using Simplified Chinese characters. I also put in lots of hyphens to help with pronunciation.\n\nThe Tang Dynasty\n\nChinese history, until the Republican era (1912 onward) had seen a series of kingships followed by imperial dynasties. Although, we usually call the country ‚ÄúChina‚Äù, the name used by Chinese people in antiquity, and by their neighbors, was often taken from the current ruling dynasty.\n\nDynasties came and went. Some were fairly short-lived such as the Sui, others were incredibly powerful and long-lasting such as the Ming. Some were constantly fighting for their existence, such as the Song, others were fractured into a series of ‚Äúmini-dynasties‚Äù that only exerted control over a region and were unable to unify China.\n\nXuan-zang lived during the last days of the Su√≠ Dynasty, and the early days of the T√°ng Dynasty (Âîê). ‚ÄúGreat Tang‚Äù (Â§ßÂîê) as it called itself, lasted from 618 ‚Äì 907, and was one of the high points of Chinese civilization. The empire expanded very far to the west, along the Silk Road (more on that in future posts) and actively imported all kinds of art, people, ideas, religions and material culture from Central Asia. Compared to earlier dynasties, Great Tang was much more cosmopolitan and less insular.\n\nXuan-zang lived primarily during the reign of the second Tang emperor T√†i-z≈çng (Â§™ÂÆó), who was an incredibly powerful, dynamic ruler. Chinese history still reveres him as of the greatest rulers. Tai-zong aided his father, the first emperor, in overthrowing the previous dynasty. Further, he was a powerful, expansionist ruler with a strong sense of administration, which helped provide stable foundations for Great Tang.\n\nThe Capital of Chang-An\n\nThe capital of Great Tang was the city of Ch√°ng-ƒÅn (ÈïøÂÆâ) in the western part of China. The city was a massive, cosmopolitan center of administration, commerce and culture. Chang-an at its height grew to 30 square miles, which was massive compared to Rome which occupied only 5.2 square miles. The population by 742 was recorded as 2,000,000 residents and of these 5,000 foreigners.\n\nChang-an was easily one of the world‚Äôs greatest cities at the time, and it had a great influence on its neighbors as well: the layout for the capital of Japan, Kyoto, was intended to resemble Chang-an, and great Buddhist masters such as Saicho‚Äôs rival, Kukai, studied there extensively. It was here that many Buddhist texts that came from the Silk Road were translated here as well.\n\nOther religions, such as Nestorian Christianity, Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism and even Judaism and Islam all had a presence in Chang-an.\n\nAs the easternmost point of the Silk Road, it was here that many journeys began or ended‚Ä¶\n\nBuddhism in Great Tang\n\nThe Tang Dynasty is often regarded as one of the high points of Chinese civilization, but also for Buddhism. Buddhism had emerged in China centuries earlier but its spread was slow at first. The native Confucian community particular resented the foreign Buddhist teachings as un-filial, unproductive (since monks did not work fields), and a drain on national resources.\n\nIn spite of the criticisms, it spread nonetheless. Wave and wave of teachings, newly translated texts, and schools of thought were imported from the Silk Road, allowing Buddhism to gradually take root, articulate its teachings better over successive generations, and develop natively Chinese schools of thought such as TiƒÅn-tƒÅi, Hu√°-y√°n, and Pure Land alongside imported schools of thought from India such as F«é-xi√†ng (Yogacara) and SƒÅn-l√πn (Madhyamika). By the time of the Tang Dynasty, massive temple complexes had arisen around Chang-an and other major cities.\n\nThis was a rare time when there was still a connection between Buddhist India and China, allowing a free flow of information. Later, when Buddhism fell in India, and the Silk Road was no longer safe to travel due to warfare, China was cut off.\n\nEmperor Tai-zong himself had a distant relationship with Buddhism in his early reign. He kept it at arm‚Äôs length and strictly regulated. Further, travel in and out of China was tightly restricted, so that while there was commerce and trade, one could only do so with official permissions. More on this shortly.\n\nEnter Xuan-Zang\n\nXuan-zang was the second son of his family. His older brother had ordained as a Buddhist monk, and Xuan-zang decided to follow in his footsteps at a young age. During the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, both brothers came to Chang-an where it was safe, and undertook further Buddhist studies. Since Xuan-zang proved to be a promising student, he was soon given access to advanced Buddhist texts and eventually ordained as a full monk in 622.\n\nAs to why Xuan-zang decided to journey all the way back to India, he is quoted as stating the following:\n\nDuring his studies, Xuan-zang had noticed copyist errors, corruptions of texts, missing texts and other textual issues that prevented a thorough understanding. Thus, he resolved to journey to India, much like a monk named Fa-xian (Ê≥ïÊòæ) had done centuries earlier. He was particularly interested in the writings of Vasubandhu and his half-brother Asanga , who were crucial to the development of Mahayana Buddhism as we know it. Xuan-zang and some like-minded monks petitioned the Emperor Tai-zong to be allowed to journey to India, but never received an answer. He made his preparations, possibly learning some Tokharian language (commonly spoken along the Silk Road at that time) from the foreign quarters at Chang-an, then went west.\n\nBy the time Xuan-zang reached the Yumen Pass (Y√πm√©n GuƒÅn ÁéâÈó®ÂÖ≥) at the western end of Great Tang, he had attracted some unwanted scrutiny by authorities, and wasn‚Äôt permitted to leave. By this point, his companions had lost their nerve, but Xuan-zang was determined to continue. With some help from a sympathizer, Xuan-zang defied imperial orders and snuck around the Yumen Pass to leave China. He was now a criminal, and he was alone with a vast desert ahead of him.\n\nWhat happened next? Find out in next episode.\n\nOne of the most important figures in Buddhism and East Asian history is, arguably, also one of the least known outside of some cultural circles. I am talking about a famous Chinese monk named Xuan-zang (ÁéÑÂ•ò, 602 ‚Äì 664).1 Recently, I found an old, but fascinating book on my shelf I had forgotten about, titled The Silk Road Journey With Xuanzang. This book tells the story of Xuanzang as a young monk, who decided to journey to India to see historical land of the Buddha.\n\nHe is also celebrated in this video from Extra History:\n\nWhy would he do this? In his own words:\n\nBut journeying from China to India can‚Äôt be all that hard, right?\n\nIn fact, it was extremely difficult and dangerous, and a big reason why even getting Buddhism to China was such a big deal in the first place. First, one has to‚Ä¶\n\nCross the Taklamakan Desert, then\n\nJourney through the Kingdom of the Western Turks, hopefully unscathed, then\n\nFollow the Tian-Shan mountains for weeks, then\n\nCross over the Oxus River (modern-day Afghanistan), then\n\nPass over a small mountain range that you might have heard of: the Himalaya mountains, meanwhile\n\nAvoid getting robbed by bandits (Xuan-zang did encounter a few)\n\nAvoid thirst and starvation, and\n\nAvoid exposure to the elements (extreme heat and cold), and finally once India\n\nFollow the Ganges River for thousands of miles downstream to the city of Benares.\n\nThe so-called ‚Äúsilk road‚Äù between China and India was not a simple road that people could just traverse, but a series of inter-connected trade routes, and due to the harsh climate and difficult environments, also a very dangerous one. Powerful steppe warrior tribes of Uyghurs and Turks, not unlike the Scythians, dominated much of these no-mans-lands, and were fickle with whom they protected and supported.\n\nWhile in India, Xuanzang journeyed to many areas. Among other things, he beheld the giant Buddhist statues in Bamiyan, Afghanistan (now destroyed), visited the Jeta Grove where the Buddha frequently resided with his followers, and many of the great cities along the Ganges River before residing at Nalanda University for some time.\n\nTechnically Xuanzang wasn‚Äôt the first Chinese monk to accomplish this. Another monk named Faxian (Ê≥ïÈ°Ø, 337 ‚Äì 422)2 was the first of several. Faxian stayed only in the northern part of India, then took a ship back to China. Xuanzang journeyed all over India, studied at the famous Nalanda University (coincidentally mentioned in the BBC recently) and then walked all the way back too. The trip took a total of 11 years.\n\nWhen Xuanzang returned to China, he was feted by the Emperor and was given a team of translators and scholars to help translate and compile all the texts he brought back. This led to an explosion of information for the Chinese Buddhist community and helped the Yogacara school gain deeper roots in East Asian Buddhism which we still benefit from today. Much of these records were gradually lost in India, but preserved in China thanks to people like Xuanzang.\n\nOne other historical note here, when Faxian came to India, Buddhism was still a prosperous religion, but when Xuanzang visited centuries later, it was clearly declining in some areas, and slowly being replaced with the Hindu religion we know today.3 Some Buddhist monasteries he encountered still maintained certain practices but no longer understood why. Other monasteries still survived as great centers of learning, with others were completely deserted. It‚Äôs not surprising then, centuries later, when Turko-Afghan warriors invaded India and established a Sultanate, Buddhist institutions were easily swept aside.\n\nOne thing that‚Äôs often overlooked is the language barrier. Chinese language and Sanskrit (as well as spoken Prakrits) are miles apart. They have no common linguistic ancestry. The effort to translate old Buddhist texts from Sanskrit to Chinese during the Tang Dynasty had been a major undertaking and required multiple efforts to properly refine the translation. But Chinese Buddhist monks who could actually speak Sanskrit or any Indian language would have been very rare indeed. Xuanzang must have relied on translators, or somehow learned to speak it well enough to survive so long in India. That invaluable ability to speak it fluently would have been very helpful on his return trip when he translated the volumes of texts he brought back to China.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that translating concepts such as the ‚Äúphenomena of the mind‚Äù is much, much harder than translating, say, a shopping list. This was an extremely challenging undertaking.\n\nXuanzang‚Äôs adventure became the inspiration for a 16th-century Chinese novel called ‚ÄúJourney to the West‚Äù (Ë•øÈÅäË®ò). This Chinese novel was hugely popular, and you can often see movies and dramas about it both in China and Japan. In Japan, it‚Äôs called saiy≈´ki. When my wife and I were first married, we enjoyed watching the 2006 drama with SMAP‚Äôs Kattori Shingo as the lead actor. We also have an kid‚Äôs manga version Japanese for our son. Even the image of Goku from Dragon Ball takes some influences from Journey to the West (a simian-like being riding a cloud, for example).\n\nThe book is a fantastic overview of many places along the Silk Road, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, and India that Xuanzang saw and wrote about, and are only dimly understood by Westerners. In many places where the US has been involved in overseas conflicts, it‚Äôs simply amazing how much history has been there, and how many different feet have tread upon that ground, including monks like Xuanzang and earlier by the Bactrian Greeks of Alexandar the Great.\n\nIn any case, I‚Äôve always been a big fan of Xuanzang, and I feel he deserves a lot more recognition in history. So, to help readers remember who he was, I made a song about him based on the original Spiderman theme song ( original lyrics):\n\n‚ô´ Xuanzang-man, Xuanzang-man.\n\nDoes whatever a Buddhist can\n\nGoes around, anywhere,\n\nCatches sutras just like flies.\n\nLook out!\n\nHere comes the Xuanzang-man.\n\nIs he tough?\n\nListen bud‚Äî\n\nHe walked the entire way there.\n\nCan he cross a de-sert?\n\nTake a look over there.\n\nHey bro!\n\nThere goes the Xuanzang-man.\n\nIn the chill of the night,\n\nAt the Roof of the World,\n\nHe crossed a ravine,\n\nWith only a rope bridge!\n\nXuanzang-man, Xuanzang-man,\n\nFriendly neighborhood Xuanzang-man.\n\nWealth and fame, he‚Äôs ignored‚Äî Wisdom is his reward.\n\nTo him, Life is a great illusion‚Äî\n\nWherever there‚Äôs a stupa,\n\nYou‚Äôll find the Xuanzang-man!‚ô´\n\nTry it out a few times. A few parts of the wording are a bit awkward, so I probably need to work on it some more.\n\nP.S.

In Japanese, the same name is pronounced as Genj≈ç.\n\n2 Pronounced like ‚ÄúFa Shien‚Äù.\n\n3 A common misconception is that Buddhism arose from Hinduism, but this is inaccurate. Buddhism and Hinduism both have a common cultural ancestor in the ancient religion of the Vedas. Buddhism ultimately rejected the deistic religion of the Vedas and its veneration of the early gods, relegating them to secondary status, but Hinduism embraced it and gave it much more philosophical weight. Hinduism as we know it simply didn‚Äôt exist, and the religion of the Vedas was more similar to, say, ancient Greek religion around the Olympian gods."
