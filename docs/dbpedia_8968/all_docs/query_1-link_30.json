        "text": "Bilge Khagan (Old Turkic: ð°ð°ð° ð°ð° ð°´ð°ð°£, Bilge qaÎ³an) (683 â 25 November 734) was the khagan of the Second Turkic Khaganate. His accomplishments were described in the Orkhon inscriptions.\n\nEarly years\n\nHe was born in 683, just in early years of Second Khaganate. He campaigned alongside his father from early years as a child. He was created as Tardush shad and given command over western wing of empire in 697 by Qapaghan. He managed to annihalate Wei Yuanzhong's army in 701 with his brother. He also reconquered Basmyl tribes in 703. He also subdued Yenisei Kyrgyz forces in 709, after their disobedience had to reconquer and kill their khagan in 710. He killed Sakal in his invasion of Turgesh in 711 and had submission from Beshbaliq in 713.\n\nIn later years of Qapaghan, he had to fight 4 battles in a year starting from 714, resubduing tribes and nearly was killed in an ambush from Huige forces in 715.\n\nReign\n\nIn 716, Qapaghan Qaghan, the second khagan, was killed in his campaign against the Toquz Oghuz alliance and his severed head was sent to Chang'an. Although his son Inel Khagan succeeded him, Bilge's brother Kul Tigin and Tonyukuk carried out a coup d'Ã©tatagainst Inel Khaghan. They killed him and made him Bilge khagan. His name literally means \"wise king\".\n\nHe appointed his brother Kul Tigin to be Left Wise Prince, which made second most powerful person in realm. He resubdued Huige in 716. Also appointed his father-in-law Tonyukuk to be Master Strategist.\n\nNew reforms and stabilization of regime caused tribes that fled Tujue to come back. Tang chancellor Wang Jun, believing that the GÃ¶ktÃ¼rks who surrendered would try to flee back to the GÃ¶ktÃ¼rk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so. Before Wang's suggestion could be acted upon, however, there was an uprising by the GÃ¶ktÃ¼rks who surrendered, under the leadership of Xiedie Sitai (ð¨è·ææ³°) and Axilan (é¿æç). Xue and Wang tried to intercept them and dealt them defeats, but they were able to flee back to the GÃ¶ktÃ¼rk state anyway. This defeat led to Xue Ne's retirement.\n\nReligious policy\n\nAt some point in his life, he wanted to convert to Buddhism, settle in cities. However, Tonyukuk discouraged him from this, citing Tujue's small numbers and vulnerability to Chinese attack. While Turks' power rested on their mobility, conversion to Buddhism would bring pacifism among population. Therefore sticking to Tengriism was necessary to survive.\n\nLater reign\n\nIn 720, Wang believed that the Pugu (ååº) and Xiedie tribes of the region were planning to defect to Eastern Tujue and attack with Eastern Tujue troops. He thus held a feast and invited the chieftains, and, at the feast, massacred them. He then attacked the Pugu and Xiedie tribes in the area, nearly wiping them out. He then proposed a plan to attack khagan along with the Baximi, Xi, and Khitan. Emperor Xuanzong also recruited Qapaghan Khagan's sons Bilge Tigin and Mo Tigin, Yenisei Kyrgyz khagan Kutluk Bilge Khagan and Huoba Guiren to fight against Tujue. Tonyukuk cunningly launched first attack on Baximi in 721 autumn, completely crushing them. Meanwhile Bilge raided Gansu, taking much of the livestock. Later that year Khitans, next year Xi were also crushed.\n\nIn 726, his father-in-law and chancellor Tonyukuk died.\n\nIn 727, he sent Buyruk Chor (Chinese: æ¢ éå/æ¢ å½å; pinyin: MÃ©ilÃ¹ ChuÃ²) as en emissary to Xuanzong to send 30 horses as gift. He also alarmed him of Me Agtsom's proposal of anti-Tang alliance. This alarm proved to be true when Tibetan general We Tadra Khonglo invaded Tang China in 727, sank Guazhou (çå·, in mordern Gansu), Changle (å¸¸æ¨, in south of mordern Guazhou County), Changmenjun (é·éè», in north of mordern Yumen) and Anxi (å®è¥¿, mordern Lintan).\n\nOn 27 February 731, Kul Tigin died, for which khagan mourned and ordered a great funeral ceremony.\n\nIn 733, he defeated rebellious Khitan tribes.\n\nDeath\n\nJust after sending an emissary to Xuanzong to gain heqin alliance, he was poisoned by Buyruk Chor. He didn't die immediately and he had time to punish the family of Buyruk Chor with death. He died on 25 November734, his burial ceremony took place on 22 June 735.\n\nFamily\n\nHe was married to El Etmish Bilge Khatun, Tonyukuk's daughter. He had several issues:"
