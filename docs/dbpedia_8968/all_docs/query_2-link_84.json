It consists of two parts. In the first part in chronological sequence is told about historical processes since ancient times till getting independence in 1991. In the second part main attention would be given to the contemporary history of Kazakhstan. The existing works on Kazakhstan’s history usually stress the evolution of the statehood on the territory of Kazakhstan. A number of important general histories emphasize that Kazakh people have a millennia-long history. Although some other works do not contain a harsh critique of the Soviet regime nonetheless leaving aside certain positive outcomes such as industrialization, educational progress and national delimitation. Most of already published books offer idea of Kazakh people struggle for their independence for centuries. At the same time in works of Western and Russian authors is advanced the idea that ancient population of the Kazakhstan might have either no very little connection with the modern Kazakh ethnic group. Another principal distinction of the textbook is that it avoids getting the evidences and points, giving comprehensive explanation. On the contrary, it makes students to ask and and to answer the questions themselves. Control questions required students to interpret, to imagine and to rationalize the possible answers because the answers could not be found in the textbook. In the basis of the textbook underlines the idea that the historical past of Kazakhstan was a complex mix of continuity and change. On the basis of the outside forces that caused dramatic changes have been distinguished patterns of the past. The first pattern is the genesis of nomadism. In early Iron Age the entire population of the Eurasian steppes passed to the nomadic mode of reproduction as a main 3\n\noccupation. It was caused by climatic change in Early Iron epoch. At the same time nomadism defined basic elements of the Kazakh ethnic culture – a way of thinking about the world around oneself, about circles of life, which have reached right up to the present day. The second pattern is Turkic epoch. The rise and decline of Turkic empires in Eurasian steppes influenced on changing the anthropological appearance of the Eurasian steppes inhabitants, defined the map of settling tribes, and also the linguistic map of the region. In that epoch did formed basic elements of the Turks ’spiritual culture – the Turkic form of Tengrism and the ancestors’ cult exist up till now. The next large change happened in the Mongol epoch. The Mongol conquest caused large migrations of the population, what in the end hastened ethnic consolidation processes, and forming ethno political structures on the territory of Kazakhstan completed with establishing the first Kazakh state – the Kazakh Khanate. The fourth pattern can be distinguished with coming the Russian Empire. That was the period when were transformed traditional institutions of power, social structure, began modernization. The largest changes took place in the Soviet epoch when was forcibly broken nomadism, the populations centuries-old way of life, was inculcated the Marxist-Leninist ideology which transformed the people’s consciousness. At the same time the Soviet epoch became the time of the rapid modernization, gathering Kazakh land within the framework of the Soviet Republic, legal consolidation of the territory, what subsequently became the base of the modern territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In the textbook is considered the following circle of problems: Genesis of nomadism in the Eurasian steppes. Main traits of the Turk epoch which subsequently became basic components of the Kazakh’s culture up till now. Ethnic processes on the territory of Kazakhstan which completed with the formation of the Kazakh. Configuration of the political infrastructure on the territory of Kazakhstan before its destruction by Russian Empire. Historiographical views from the XIX century till today of the Russian Empire’s policy toward Kazakhstan. 4\n\nP;uralistic view on the Soviet epoch and to the characteristics of the Soviet State. The aim of the textbook is to develop of historical thinking skills while leaning historical content: The ability to identify, compare and evaluate multiple perspectives on a given historical event in order to draw conclusions about that event. The ability to connect historical events and processes to specific circumstances of time and place as well as broader regional, national or global processes. The ability to recognize, analyze and evaluate the dynamics of historical continuity and change over periods of time of varying length as well as the ability to relate these patterns to larger historical processes. The ability to identify, analyze and evaluate the relationships among historical causes and effects, distinguishing between those that are long term and proximate. Thus, in the textbook is realized the idea, that studying the past is far more engaging than memorizing dates. Textbook was designed to engage students in their own learning of history, to assist them in developing historical thinking competencies, but not simply understanding of the chronological sequence of events on the territory of Kazakhstan or an uncritical, history-as-true-fact, spoonfed-hero-worshipping of and the unquestioned glorification of some person in the past. In the realization of the given aim will help not only texts of the chapters, but also the rich didactic material. After each section are offered control questions. These questions required students to interpret, to imagine and to rationalize the possible answers because the answers could not be found in the textbook. Finally such skills will help student to understand the historical facts in relation to today’s and future’s events. When students have acquired the ability to think historically, they able to understand the meaning of the past actions and events, and able to relate, explain and predict the present and future activities emphasized on understanding the chronology of the historical events. 5\n\nІ Part KAZAKHSTAN LANDS INHABITANTS IN EARLIEST PERIOD\n\n1.1. The Stone Age archeological sites on the territory of Kazakhstan The beginning of human history has been reconstructed entirely through archaeological material – artefacts of daily use, tools and weapons, pots and pans, toys and playthings, dress and ornaments, furniture and fabrications of all sorts, objects of and for worship as well as many other items that constitute human culture or cultures. So, archeological sources are very important for reconstructing the periods when the written sources did not emerge Archeologists use their own periodization. The names for archaeological periods in the list of archaeological periods vary enormously from region to region. Dating also varies considerably across wide areas. The three-age system has been used in many areas, referring to the prehistorical periods identified by tool manufacture and use, of the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Since these ages are distinguished by the development of technology, it is natural that the dates, to which these refer, vary in different parts of the world. So, according to this periodization system the Stone Age is divided into the Paleolithic era, the Mesolithic era and the Neolithic Era. As Jeremy Tredinnick mentioned, Kazakhstan’s role in the history of mankind is significant, if to look at the history of settling the earth by first humans. Jeremy Tredinnick emphasizes that although there are many theories about when, in what way and where the first humans moved out of Africa, there is solid archaeological evidence that the ancestors (Homo habilis, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthalensis 6\n\nand Homo Sapiens) migrated from the Middle East to Central Asia and stayed here. According to Jeremy Tredinnick: «Modern-day genome Controling has subsequently shown that the colonization by humans of both northern Europe and Siberia- and from there North America – began in Central Asia and of territory of Kazakhstan»1. When the first hominids had settled on the coast of the Caspian Sea and the ridges of Karatau, Central Asia was a hot, humid savanna under the influence of a monsoonal climate from the south. Therefore, the first people settled near water sources. As soon as the tectonic movements in the Tien Shan resulted in the state of Mountains, the climate had changed. In the conditions of changes in the monsoons and cyclones, increasing continental climate in the arid zone, a considerable part of the Kazakhstan territory was desertificated. Different regions of Kazakhstan in these changing conditions differently responded to these changes. Thus, the Caspian and Turan desert regions are characterized by stability of paleographic conditions. The region is characterized by a favorable climate, an abundance of hunting places and habitats, availability of fresh water. Therefore, on the coast of the Caspian Sea and the Ustyurt plateau remained numerous sites of the Stone Age. Also, the Sary-Arka region, with a combination of small hills and plains was had been for a long time the area of primitive people habitat. But with coming of many years frozen conditions of the ground hominids left the habitat. The next hominid dispersal region is the southeast Karatau range, which climatically had exceptionally favorable conditions. The geological structure of the mountains also favourated the continuous habitation here large herds of animals. Therefore the Karatau range had been a favorite place for settling ancient hominids, who found here food and water sources. So, of the most interest are the early Paleolithic sites Borykazgan and Tanirkazgan. Here were found a wide range of heavily abraded flakes and cores, mostly irregular orthogonal cores, core-like products and modified flakes, but also bilateral chopping tools. 1 Jeremy Tredinnick. Pre-history: Human migrations and the the stone age // See: Tredinnick J. An illustrated History of Kazakhstan: Asia’s Heartland in Context. Published by Odyssey Books & Maps. 2014. – P. 20.\n\n7\n\nEpipaleolithic (the transitional period from Early to Late Paleolithic) sites were discovered also in central Kazakhstan. For example, Kudaykol site with finely flaked blades, often with new technical developments like retouched backs. The Northern Pre-Balkhash area was also the settlement area in the Paleolithic era. In this area sites were found on river and lake terraces, on the tops and slopes of hills. So, at Semizbugu site in Zhezkazgan were stored a collection of stone objects in 1611 units. In East Kazakhstan the most ancient is the Kozybai site. As regards the Upper Paleolithic era in Kazakhstan there are no many completely studied sites. The most complete material for this period are the findings of stone objects at the Karatau range in Southern Kazakhstan, on the Irtysh River in Eastern Kazakhstan, in the Sarysu River in Northern Balkhash area. The Mesolithic period on the territory of Kazakhstan is poorly studied. Today well studied and documented only about two tens Mesolithic sites in Kazakhstan. Mesolithic sites were found there where up till now have not been discovered Paleolithic ones. As a rule, sites located on the banks of rivers and lakes. Remains of housing constructions have not survived. During the Mesolithic period the climate had changed in the first place it was connected with the retreat of glaciers. At that time, formed the hydrographic network, close to the modern, formed the flora and fauna composition close to the modern. Because of the extinction of mammoths, there were going ways to provide the means of subsistence. During the Mesolithic period widely spread use of bows and arrows, bush techniques for making tools, increased mobility of the population. The most important invention of the Mesolithic epoch was the bow. It was stipulated with transition to individual hunting. In the Mesolithic there was also a further fundamental change in the technique of making tools – their size did not depend on the size of the stone. It was possible thanks bush technique what became the basis for making various tools. The most widespread tools became arrowheads, tips of darts, javelins and spears, scrapers for processing skins, hides, knives. Complexes with material remnants of Mesolithic sites do not show significant differences from the sites of the Southern Urals, Western Siberia and the Eastern Caspian region. The heyday of stone processing technique became 8\n\nthe Neolithic period. At this time, there more and more was increasing specialization in making tools. Along with the improvement of pressure retouch technology, appeared new technological stone processing methods: grinding, drilling, sawing, began making stone axes, hoes, grinding stones, mortars, pestles. Currently in Kazakhstan there are discovered more than 800 Neolithic and Eneolithic sites. They are divided into four types: Spring, river, lake and cave. At sited of the lake and river types there are a significant quantity of findings. But the most widespread on the territory of Kazakhstan are spring sites, as arid and semi-arid zones are poor with a river network. Sites at the springs are often temporary and seasonal. One of the features of the Neolithic sites in Kazakhstan is in the fact that most of them are sites of the open type. Neolithic sites of Kazakhstan form several territorial groups. The most important feature of the Neolithic period is the transition from appropriating economy with gathering and hunting to the producing economy with the emergence of animal husbandry and agriculture. But in Kazakhstan, as the findings show, the transition was not so noticeable. As before hunting and fishing were the main sources of food. Obviously, continental climate did not favour the growth of population and there were natural resources enough to meet the needs of the population. Thus, in the Neolithic producing forms of economy on the territory of Kazakhstan did not nave their spreading. The most studied archaeological cultures of the Neolithic period on the territory of Kazakhstan are Atbasar and Mahandzhar culture. The Atbasar culture got its name on the place of the greaControl concentration of sites – The Atbasar area of the Akmola region. Here were surveyed about 200 sites, 20 of them have been excavated. The Mahanzhar culture is located on the bottom of the Turgai gully. Characteristic for this culture topography of sites is the location of the broad plots of the flood lands in the place where the river gets sharply narrow. Almost on all the sites the cultural layer consists of sand and sandy loam and in a large part has been dispelled. The Mahandzhar culture had a characteristic feature – presence of the original dishes. It was thin-walled ceramic tableware, hand-made and having elongate proportions. On the territory of Kazakhstan for the time have been discovered a few Neolithic burials, mostly in Northern Kazakhstan. 9\n\nNone of the burials has external signs on the surface. In all the graves there were arrowheads, in the burials there was no much ceramics. As for the next stage of the archaeological periodization Eneolithic (the epoch of brass instruments introduction to people's life), in Kazakhstan stone industry not degraded, but rose to a higher level. Possibilities on stone processing not only had been implemented to the maximum, but there also was extended the range of production and household equipment. The most striking culture of the Eneolithic epoch is the Botai culture in Kokshetau oblast. In 1980, discovery of Botai settlement by the Kazakh archaeologist V.F. Zaybertom became a major event in the study of the Eneolithic era in Kazakhstan. European scientists have confirmed that just here the horse was first domesticated. The site is located on the right bank of the ImanBurluk river, five km to the south of the Botai junction of the Volodarsky Area of the Kokshetau oblast. The area of the settlement was one hundred twenty thousand sq. km. On the surface were clearly fixed contours of eighty dwellings, the total capacity of the cultural layer, including housing depressions, reached from one point to two meters. Were found about sixty thousand objects made of stone, clay, bone. In the settlement in a large number were found animal bones, most of which, according to L.A.Ermolova, belonged to horses. Also were found bones of bison, aurochs, deer, elks, wolvesdogs, bears, beavers, etc. Stationary excavations at the Botai settlement also continued in subsequent years. During this time (5 years) was found quite informative material. The site industry had a flake character. The presence of various types of tools, their high range was evidence of a diversified economy. In the process of excavation was received large osteological material – about 25 thousand horse bones. Under the excavations it became clear that the settlement was stationary and functioned 300-400 years. Materials of the Botai settlement allowed the author to distinquish a separate Botai cultural type, which spread over a large territory of Northern Kazakhstan. The excavations have shown that they were buildings in the last stage of the settlement existence. So it can be concerned that the Botai is the settlement where the earliest horse domestication has been documented. Thus, the Botai culture marked the type of a community where emerged a new form of economy - mobile cattle-breeding. 10\n\nControl questions: 1. Which of the regions of Kazakhstan became «a favorite place for settling by primitive people with the coming of many years frozen conditions of the ground»? Provide some information to explain why. 2. What are the features of the Neolithic epoch on the territory of Kazakhstan? 3. Give arguments in favor of the discovery by I. Saibert that the Neolithic Botai settlement is a major event in the archeology of Eurasia. 4. Describe two the most studied archaeological cultures of the Neolithic epoch. 5. Why on the territory of Kazakhstan, do not we see signs of the transition to the appropriating forms of economy in the Neolithic epoch? Tasks for independent study: Read Appendix I Rogozinskiy Alexei. Rock sites in Kazakhstan // Rock Art in Central Asia. A Thematic study. November. 2011. Ed. by Jean Clottes. UNESCO. International Council on Monuments and Sites. – Paris. 2011. – P.9-43. After reading the paper write a 500 words essay on the following topic: «Give characteristics of the most large and significant location of petroglyphs on the territory of modern Kazakhstan. Prove the statement why they are potential sites for the World Heritage List and are presented in the Tentative List of Kazakhstan for UNESCO or were included in the World Heritage List».\n\n1.2. The Bronze Age Archeological Sites on the Present-Day Kazakhstan territory At the turn of the first – second quarters of the II millennium B.C. in the Eurasian steppes was invented bronze. Bronze is a copper-tin alloy, sometimes antimony, arsenic, and lead in various proportions depending on the purpose of the product. As compared with copper, it has a number of advantages: differs in hardness, low melting point, a beautiful golden color. Bronze became the main raw material for making tools and weapons. The tribes living on the territory of Kazakhstan in the Bronze Age, left archaeological sites (settlements, cemeteries, mines, rock paintings) that belong to the Andronov archaeological culture. The name was given to the culture on the place of the first excavations of a burial ground in the Andronov village in Southern Siberia. In 1927, archaeologist M.P. Grjaznov found similar burials in Western 11\n\nKazakhstan and established that the Andronov culture sites spread over a wide area - from Minusinsk in the east to the Ural Mountains in the west. Later Andronov monuments have been found in the south of Kazakhstan, in the Semirechye and Central Asia. Thus, in the Bronze Age steppe expanses of Siberia, Ural, Kazakhstan and Central Asia were populated by kinred tribes, that left a bright distinctive culture. In science, it has received the conventional name Andronov. One of the main centers of the Andronov Culture was on the territory of Kazakhstan. Archaeological data evidence that the Andronov population in the overwhelming majority led a sedentary life. Settlements located on the banks of rivers with broad flood plain meadows. Dwellings of big patriarchal families were earth-houses with various household extension and enclosures for cattle. The main occupation of the Andronov population was cattle-breeding and agricultural economy with a evident predominance of pastoralism. Andronov culture had a number of distinctive features. Among them the burial rite was main. The Andronov’s burial structures erected in the form of stone fences of different configurations: square, round, oval. The dead were burned or buried on their side in a doubled-up posture in boxes made of stone slabs or rectangular ground chambers. The second distinctive feature of the Andronov Culture was a peculiar set of pottery with geometric designs. Vessels were made by hand. They had a flat bottom. The outer side of the vessels was decorated with complex geometric patterns. The third feature were forms of metal products. For example, they were characterized by decorations in the form of gold leaf earrings, folded in one and a half turn, decorations of head-dresses and clothes in the form of glasses-shaped or palmate pendants, bangles with spirally twisted ends. The Andronov culture belongs to the early and middle stages of the Bronze Age. Bone material from settlements of the Early Bronze Age suggests that the main occupation was house pastoralism. In herds dominated cattle. There was not many sheep and horses. But gradually, the house pastoralism developed into yaylazhnoe. In the herd increased the proportion of sheep and horses – hardy animals and able to take feed out of the snow. But depending on the geographical factors in some areas began the domesticating wild 12\n\nanimals, in other developed hoe agriculture. Along with agriculture and cattle-breeding an important role played mining of various ores, stone and bones processing. Among the Andronovs were quite developed home trades – producing clothes, footwear, making ceramic tableware, fighting weapons – arrows with bronze tips, spears, maces, axes. In the late Bronze Age on the territory of Kazakhstan appeared another archaeological culture, which on the place of the first findings was called Begazy-Dandybai culture. At an early stage of this culture development was characteristic combination of Andronov’s traditions with new elements - a special type of funerary structures, the presence of vessels of a squat, spherical shape. For the Begazy-Dandybai culture was characteristic another burial rite than the Andronov’s had. Along with the usual, double-up are met stretched bodies on the back. For this transitional stage as a typical monument is Aksu Ayuly II funerary complex to the south of Karaganda. It consists of the same type earthen mounds, with ring fences of large granite slabs, dug in with their edges. These are not ancestral burials of patriarchal-family communities, but the tombs of the most prominent members of the communities. At this early stage of the Late Bronze Age already appeared human burials in the stretched posture. Pottery had also changed more and more adapting to the mobile life. The rapid growth of livestock heads associated with the transition to yaylazhnyi and then to nomadic pastoralism, was reflected in the funeral rite, when the deceased were buried with meat food. In burial places are found a large numbers of domestic animals bones. To the developed stage of the BegazyDandybaш culture belong a number of rich mausoleum-necropoleis: Begazy, Aibas-Daras, Akkoitas, Dandybai, etc. These burial grounds and settlements are characterized by completeness of architectural forms of residential and cultic constructions, a variety of new types of spherical ceramics. At the late stage of developing the BegazyDandybai culture the economy was changing to a nomadic way. Complex funeral constructions of the previous time were replaced by simple ones of large stone boxes without fences. The design of the dwellings was also changed constructions of the ground type became dominant. In general, it should be noted that the period of the Late Bronze Age all over the territory of Kazakhstan was characterized by 13\n\nthe transition of pastoral tribes to the nomadic pastoralism. The Bronze Age pastoralists in the steppes completed the transition to various forms of nomadism at the beginning of the first millennium B.C. in the northern areas of Central Asia. This was a fundamental, qualitative leap comparable in its economic, cultural and political consequences with the so-called urban revolution in the settled oases of the southern regions. The wide-scale introduction of metallurgy contributed to the development of specialized branches of manufacture, including weapon-making. The accumulation of wealth and military conflicts led to the institutionalization of power, and tribal leaders developed into absolute petty rulers. On the ideological level, these processes were reflected in the appearance of monumental tombs for these members of the developing élite. Interregional contacts increased sharply, particularly with the acquisition of horse-riding. Spiritual and material values thus spread rapidly over great distances. A striking example of this is provided by the so-called deer-stones decorated with artistic reliefs, which are known over an enormous area from Mongolia to Bulgaria. The transition to nomadism was also responsible for a fundamental change in the mode of life: the armed rider became the symbol of the new period and we encounter its equipment in burials and in the arts. On this foundation powerful groups of early nomadic tribes were formed around the middle of the first millennium B.C. A new force as powerful as the ancient Orient State entities entered into the arena of world history. Control questions: 1. Give the characteristic of the Andronov culture hallmarks in Kazakhstan. 2. What types of cattle-breeding were developed among the Andronov population? Describe them. 3. Compare the Begazy-Dandybai culture with the Andronov one. Give specific examples. 4. Basing on the archaeological material prove, that at the late stage of the Begazy-Dandybai culture development was changing the economy to a nomadic way.\n\n14\n\n1.3. The Iron Age on the Kazakhstan territory 1.3.1. The Saka tribes on the Kazakhstan territory: sources evidences As prominent Kazakhstani archeologist K. Baipakov mentioned, when the first millennium B.C. began the steppes of Central Asia were marked by a number of factors that came together to facilitate a world-changing phenomenon. Firstly, climate changes had led to increasing aridity on the most part of the Kazakhstan territory, forcing the population to engage in nomadic pastoralism. The numerous bone materials found during the excavations evidence about it. In addition, in this period the rite of horse devoting to the dead got its wide spreading, Controlifying to the growing role of the horse in the life of the region ancient inhabitants. Secondly, the transition to nomadic pastoralism coincided with the invention and use of tools made of iron. The tribes living in that epoch, involved in the genesis of nomadic pastoralism were the Sakas. In contrast to the previous stage of the history the Early Iron Age is represented in written sources of ancient Greek, Achaemenid and Chinese origin. For example, there are mentions of Sakas in the Behistun Inscription of Darius I (521486 B.C.) of Achaemenian Persia as well as Avesta, a set of ancient Iraninan books of the Zoroastrian religion. Some of the information we also find in ancient Greek and Latin sources. The most important among them are data of Herodotus, Xenophon, and latter authors as Arrian, Ptolemy and Strabo. The term 'Tura' is the name by which the Central Asian nomadic tribes were in one of the earliest parts of the Avesta. The Turas are portrayed as enemies of the sedentary Iranians and described as possessing fleet-footed horses. As early as 641 or 640 B.C. the nomads were known in Assyrian sources as the Sakas. Many Greek writers referred to all the nomads of Eurasia, including those of Central Asia, as Scythians; and the Persians designated all the nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes, including the Scythians, as the Sakas. These broad classifications were based on the similarity of cultures and ways of life of all the nomads who spoke Iranian languages as the 15\n\nauthors of the second volume of History of Civilizations of Central Asia assert2. The question of the actual distribution of the different nomadic tribes or tribal groups is debatable, largely because of the dearth of written sources. Moreover, it is well to remember that nomadic life characteristically entailed frequent migrations, with the result that different tribes successively occupied one and the same territory. When it is considered that these tribes were culturally very close to one another it is easy to understand why classical writers sometimes associated different tribes with the same historical events. The Saka tribes were contemporaries of the Royal Scythians, who lived in the Northern Black Sea and Dnieper region, and the Sauromatians who occupied the lower Volga region and southern Ural. For our territory very representative sources on the history of Saka tribes, their material and spiritual culture are archaeological monuments – mounds, cave paintings, treasures of the Sakas’ things. Such monuments discovered by scientists in different regions of Kazakhstan. So, judging by the archaeological findings in the first millennium B.C. Semirechye and South Kazakhstan were the center of settling a large group of Saka tribes, according to one hypothesis identical to the Sakas-Tigraхauda. This region on the accumulation of a large number of royal burial mounds in height more than 20 meters is unrivaled in Central Asia and other regions of Kazakhstan. Unique among them is the Bes-Shatyr burial-ground, which is located on the right bank of the Ili River. It consists of 31 burial mounds, of which twenty one are with stone coverings, and ten with the rubble and earth. Most mounds were plundered. But, nevertheless, they contain valuable archaeological material, the most important of which are new types of monumental structures. In the Saka barrows of the Bes-Shatyr burial ground were discovered perfectly preserved large timbered funeral structures. In 1969-1970 by archaeological expedition headed by K. Akishev was found and excavated another large monument of the Saka epoch – the Kurgan Issyk burial mound consisting of 45 tombs. In one of the mounds with a diameter of sixty meters and a height of six meters under the 2 History of Civilizations of Central Asia.Volume II: The Development of Sedentary and Nomadic Civilizations: 700 B.C. to A.D. 250 / Edited by Janos Harmatta, B.J. Puri, and G.F. Etemadi – Paris: UNESCO Publishing, 1999. – P. 23.\n\n16\n\nembankment were discovered two burial places – central and lateral. The central grave had been completely deformed by robbers, the lateral - turned out to be undisturbed. In the southern and western parts of the cell is placed tableware in the northern part was the remains of the deceased. On the bones and underneath there were numerous items of adornments of cloths, a headgear and footwear, made of sheet gold. At the buried in a large number were found items of weapons, toilets and numerous utensils. Thus, the Issyk burial mound contains the richest material about the culture of the Sakas. Besides the so-called royal burial mounds on the territory of Semirechye and South Kazakhstan were found burials of common members of the communities of the Saka time. To them belong the Kargaly I burial ground to the west from Almaty city and AltynEmel in the Chulak Mountains. The Eastern Aral Sea region is also rich in discoveries of the Saka time – such as the Uigarak and Tagisken burial mounds in the lower reaches of the Syr Darya. In this more arid desert region bodies were placed on cane mats inside light wooden-framed cells interwoven with twigs and canes. Of the items that have been recovered, plagues covered in golden foil, applique clothing and strings on carnelian, turquoise and chalcedony beads illustrate how the deceased were buried. In the Uygarak men wore earrings and the women bracelets and bronze and iron daggers were placed at the feet of both sexes, as well as horse trappings to initiate actual horse burial. A remarkable monument of the steppe part of Eastern Kazakhstan is Chiliktin mound, which was part of a large burial ground of the fifty-one mounds in the form of an earthen embankment. There are no small mounds. It was a large cemetery of tribal leaders and common leaders functioning for centuries. The Chiliktin mound is one of the oldest in Eurasia. There clearly presented applied arts of the Saka tribes. The later stage of the culture of ancient herdsmen of Eastern Kazakhstan is represented with the Berel mounds. Monuments of this type are represented in the well-known Pazaryk mounds of Eastern Altai. The most important of them is the Berel burial ground at the Bukhtarma River. The Big Berel mound in the northern half is occupied with sixteen horses killed for burying. The seventeenth lies next to the sarcophagus-block. The dead horses were placed on a birch bark 17\n\nlining in a certain order. Remains of the horse harness have survived on the horses. In the Big Berel mound apparently was buried a tribal leader. His grave is distinguished with wealth and splendor. The Berel mound provided superb examples of the Scitho-Siberian animistic style. The Horse trappings and weapons reflected the military lifestyle and reverence for nature with numerous fascinating sculpted wooden pierces covered with gold or tin foil. Archeological sites have been founded on the territory of Kazakhstan seemed to demonstrate cultural uniformity throughout the area. Everywhere burials were found in barrows (kurgans) containing similar weapons, horse trappings and works of art. The choice of motifs and their style – known as the ‘animal style’ – pointed to a uniform cultural pattern. All this helped to give rise to the concept of a single Scythian culture, presented throughout the Eurasian steppes, which had spread from a single Centre and belonged to one tribe or people. Control questions: 1. Give the characteristics of the Saka tribes archeological data on the territory of Kazakhstan. 2. Give the meaning and origin if the term Tura. 3. What kind of archeological data support the concept of a single Scythian culture presented throughout the Eurasian steppes.\n\n1.3.2. Emergence and evolution of nomadic pastoralism in Eurasian Steppe The end of the first millennium B.C. and the beginning of our era were a turning point in the history of Kazakhstan. In the economic life of the population of Central Asia and Kazakhstan major changes associated with the invention of iron and the transition to the nomadic way of production. Transition to nomadism allowed humans to settle in the vast expanses. This way of life had existed in the Eurasian steppes for three millennia ahead for many centuries, not only lifestyle, but especially culture. Main factors determining transition to nomadism were physical and climatic conditions and socio-cultural factors. Among scientists, however, there is no consensus about when and why pastoralists in Eurasia passed to 18\n\nnomadism. Some authors believe that the transition of sedentary nomads to nomadism was stipulated by the necessity of developing new spaces with increasing the cattle number (M.P. Grjaznov, K.A.Akishev, K.M.Baipakov). The whole number of researchers adhere to the climatological concept (K.V. Salnikov, L.N. Gumilyov). L.S. Klein sees the main reason for nomadism in the cattle-breeder’s realization of military benefits of the nomadic life. The prominent Kazakh specialist in study of nomadism world renowned N. Massanov considered that G.E Markov’s standpoint was more substantiated. G.E. Markov considered that the transition of pastoral tribes to nomadism was driven by a complex of factors – climatogenic, anthropogenic, socio-economic, political, cultural. A direct incitement according to G.E. Markov was changes in the geographical environment where people in the conditions of climate aridity were not able to feed themselves at the expense of the agricultural economy any longer. As for the time of transition to the nomadic life, scientists are unanimous in the fact that it happened at the turn of the II-I millennium B.C. Among the main factors that led to the transition of cattle-breeders to the nomadic way of life - as the dominant way of production should be distinguished primarily by climatic factors. The vast territory of Kazakhstan being located at the junction of different geographical zones differs with variety of geographical and climatic conditions and is characterized by a number of special features and properties. Geophysically Kazakhstan is mostly a low-mountain plain with vast flat lowlands, elevated plateaus and low-mountain massifs. The southern and south-eastern part is mountainous regions with snowy peaks. The relief features and atmospheric precipitation in combination with other geographical factors determined the hydrographic regime in Kazakhstan. The main part of the water resources is in a field of internal drainage and only the northern part – a wastewater basin (basins of the Irtysh, Ishim, Tobol rivers). Most plain rivers dry up in summer, forming small lakes, saline surfaces, wetlands, or go into the ground, got lost in the sands. This is due to the fact that in Kazakhstan there is a significant predominance of the evaporation quaintly from the water surface over the amount of annual precipitation. In the vast spaces of Kazakhstan dispersed several thousand lakes. Uneven water balance 19\n\nleads to drying up a significant part of the lakes in the summer and autumn, as well as in long-term low-water periods. The geographical position of Kazakhstan – in the central part of Eurasia in the zone of temperate latitudes – defined features and character of natural) – (climatic conditions being the results of the interaction of the underlying surface, solar radiation and atmospheric circulation. The duration of sunshine on the territory of Kazakhstan is quite high, averaging between 2,000 and 3,000 hours per year. Since the quantity of solar radiation influx changes in the direction from north to south, as well as on the seasons of the year, the result is an intense overheating of the earth in the summer, when the value of the total radiation in the south in four times surpass the amount of radiation in the winter months. The consequence of the inland position of Kazakhstan is a sharply continental climate regime, which is characterized by sharp daily, seasonal and annual variations in temperature. Another feature of the climate in Kazakhstan, due to the remoteness from the oceanic moisture source is sharply pronounced aridity. The relative moistening in northern Kazakhstan is 50-30%, and in the desert zone – 5%. The climate of Kazakhstan is also characterized by uneven seasonal distribution of atmospheric precipitation. In winter, on the flat part falls very little precipitation – 50-100 mm (20-30% annual rate), to the foothills and mountains, their quantity increases to 500 mm. The greater part of the precipitation falls during the summer period. Owing to the irregular fall of precipitation already in the spring there is moderately arid weather, and in May – even hot-dry winds. When there is the precipitation particularly little, there is a strong soil desiccation. The soil cover because of uneven distribution of precipitation, soil freezing, action of water melt from snow, strong desiccation, dust storms, hot dry winds and heavy summer rainfall is subjected to erosion. On the territory of Kazakhstan there is often atmospheric drought. The geographical and climatic conditions determine the variety of landscapes. Four natural-landscape zones can be distinguished on the territory of Kazakhstan. The forest-steppe zone is located in the northern part. It is characterized by severe and sharply continental climate, the average maximum snow cover of 30-50 cm and with a length of its bedding in 130-160 days. Active 20\n\ngrowing period of vegetation is 120-130 days. The steppe zone occupies a significant part of the territory of Kazakhstan. It stretches from the northern part of the Caspian depression to the Altai and has 2,200 km. The steppe zone is characterized by a predominance of plains and dry, sharply continental climate. Most of the atmospheric precipitation (50% annual rate) falls in summer. The steppe zone distinguishes with the development of wind erosion, especially in the spring period. The steppe zone is characterized by a more aridity and continental climate. Its soils are chernozem with a humus layer thickness of 25-70 cm and brown with a humus layer of 15-30 cm. The semi-desert zone differs with sharply continental, dry climate, hot summers and severe winters. Its main soils are light brown, there is saline land. The thickness of the fertile layer is small, widespread steppe cereals and desert plants. The most part of the plains in Kazakhstan occupies the desert zone, with hot, long summers, very cold winters, low quantity of precipitation, aridity, seasonal, daily and annual air temperature fluctuations, large sandy tracts. On the whole territory of Kazakhstan is observed ice-covered ground phenomena. The consequence of aridity, uneven seasonal distribution of atmospheric precipitation, the poverty of soil resources, poor water content, atmospheric drought, and also freezing of the soil in winter, strong winds, solar radiation, presence of huge sand masses is very low forage productivity of the vegetation cover. Thus, the geographical conditions of Kazakhstan are characterized by high solar radiation quantity, drought, and sharply pronounced aridity, continental, seasonal climate differentiation, its long-term variability, poverty of water and soil resources, shortage of atmospheric precipitation, what in its turn leads to extremely sparse vegetation cover, sharp fluctuations in its productivity, seasonallyzonal features of vegetation, scarcity and low forage productivity of pasture grasses. As a result, the Kazakhstan areas are a very fragile ecosystem, having heightened sensibility to external factors and human economic activities. As a result, in the arid zone of Eurasia has been developed a special form of socio-cultural adaptation and nature use - nomadic cattle-breeding economy. Another group of factors stipulating transition to a nomadic way of production were socio-cultural factors. In the socio-cultural aspect the emergence of 21\n\nnomadism was predestined to a great extent the previous process of animal domestication and evolution of livestock farming, accumulating knowledge about keeping, using and grazing livestock, organizing a social production system. Many secrets of pastoralnomadic techniques handed down from father to son, from son to grandson and so on for many generations. It was the knowledge of all the nuances and peculiarities of natural cycles, geographical location of seasonal pastures, the shor Control and various routes of migrating, watering-places, hydrochemical composition of water sources, productive cycles of the vegetation cover, degree of eating and assimilating it by the cattle, fattening process and quality of the physical condition of the animals, atmospheric precipitation and spring floods, the time of setting in and melting the snow cover. The cognition process of the habitat natural resources was spontaneous and was accompanied by developing appropriate socio-cultural mechanisms of adaptation, that is, primarily techniques of grazing, migrating and organization of social production in the optimal range, as well as various elements of the material culture and lifestyle itself. This process was based on the gradual increase of cattle-breeding in the structure of cattle farms (the Bronze Age), refusal of agriculture, gradual transition to seasonal movements and periodic driving cattle off and from one place to another. Researchers in the genesis process of nomadism nark out various transitional stages of development: the house cattle breeding when the animals grow close to home, pastoralism – as a form of moving cattle from one grazing area to another, yaylazhnoe cattle – breeding as a distant type of economy, when the herds for the whole summer were driven to the seasonal pastures in the low mountainous and foothill areas or in the steppe. In the cognition process natural of the ecosystem resources were formed a herd structure, developed organizational principles of the ways of production and multipurpose productivity of livestock farming (meat, milk, wool, and transportation), the establishment of the appropriate lifestyle and traditional everyday culture, improvement of techniques and technologies, horsemanship. The importance for studying the nomadism genesis is the analysis of technological aspects, such as horsemanship, appearance of wells, iron tools, improvement of horse equipment, changes in the herd 22\n\nstructure, and principles of organizing social production. A complex of processing methods and skills, socio-cultural mechanisms in combination with the experience of ecological developing the arid Eurasian space made an information and material basis for transition of pastoral-agricultural type of economy to a new qualitative state and provided the possibility of spontaneous and immanent genesis of nomadism. Thus, a significant role in the development of the formation of the nomadic pastoral economy played a variety of technological improvements and technical innovations of the Bronze Age and early Iron Age. They certainly were one of the main factors of the genesis of nomadism, as promoted optimization of material production system, its greater adaptability and adaptability to changing climatic conditions.

The political history of the First Turk khaganate (551-630) This chapter is written on the base of Chapter eleven of the Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia by Sinor, Denis (Cambridge University Press, 2008). The authors of this chapter assert that the Chinese data concerning the origin of the Turks are contradictory and difficult to interpret. But they note strong corroborative evidence provided by the Turk ancestral legends. There are three versions, showing but a minimal thematic overlap. Even the Cou shu – where two of the three legends are given – remarks on their divergence and comments that they agree only in that in both versions the Turks are said to descend from a she-wolf. The first of these, which we may call that of ‘The Abandoned Child Brought up by a Wolf’, is related with slight variations by both the Cou shu and the Pei-shih. It tells the story of a young boy mutilated by the enemy and thrown into a marsh where he has intercourse with a she-wolf. The wolf and the boy subsequently took refuge in a cavern, where the wolf gave birth to ten boys. Several generations later the Turks emerged from the cavern and became the blacksmiths of the Juan-juan. There is another legend, also related in the Cou shu, which, in the words of this source, ‘differs from the other [legend], nevertheless it shows that [the Turks] descended from a wolf’. The third version of the legend gives entirely different story. A third legend is preserved only in a collection of anecdotes, curious and miraculous histories probably compiled in 860 and entitled the Yu-yang tsa-tsu. 25\n\nAccording to this legend, which we may call that of ‘The Spirit of the Lake’, the ancestor of the Turks, who is called Shê-mo-shê-li and lives in a cavern, has a liaison with the daughter of the lake spirit. One day, as the Turks are preparing for a great hunt, the girl says to Shê-mo: ‘Tomorrow during the hunt a white deer with golden horns will come out from the cavern where your ancestors were born [author’s emphasis]. If your arrow hits the deer we will keep in touch as long as you live, but if you miss it our relationship will end.’ In the course of the hunt, a follower of Shê-mo kills the deer. Shê-mo angrily decapitates the culprit and orders that a human sacrifice be established in which a man of that follower’s tribe be beheaded. Today, no one doubts the validity of the Chinese historical works data of ancient Turkic legends as they were received from the Turks themselves and written by Chinese authors. The Turks built their empire on the ruins of the Juan-juan. In 439, when the Northern Wei emperor T’ai-wu destroyed the small barbarian state of North Liang, established in Kansu by Chü-ch’u family, some five hundred Turk families sought refuge with the Juan-juan. The reasons that prompted this action remain unknown, but the sources report that the Turks, all of whom bore the surname Ashina, were settled by the Juan-juan in the Altai, where they worked on the manufacture of iron implements. The Gold Mountain where they worked had a shape of a helmet which in their language was called Turk. The last pages of the Juan – juan’s domination in Mongolia remain unknown. But we know that in 552 the Turks rebelled against the Juan – juanes. The death of Anakui presented Bumin and his Turk people with the task of ruling over a great empire. Two centuries later in the Orkhon inscription were recorded memories of those events: «When high above the blue sky and down below the brown earth had been created, betwixt the two were created the sons of men. And above the sons of men stood my ancestors, the khagans Bumin and Ishtemi. Having become the masters of the Turk people, they installed and ruled its empire and fixed the law of the country. Many were their enemies in the four corners of the world, but, leading campaigns against them, they subjugated and pacified many nations in the four corners of the world. They caused them to bow their 26\n\nheads and to bend their knees. There were wise khagans, these were valiant khagans, all their officers were wise and valiant; the nobles, all of them, the entire people were just. This was the reason why they were able to rule an empire so great, why, govering the empire, they could uphold the law». The founder of Turkic power was a wily politician named Bumin, who bore the title of khagan, or ruler. How he became leader of the Altay Turks is not known. But having forged an alliance with the Western Wei dynasty of China, Bumin deliberately provoked the Juan-juan into a war by demanding one of their princesses in marriage. Aided by Chinese forces, the Turks routed the Juan-juan in 552 and then subjugated neighboring nomadic tribes to become unconControled master of the Mongolian steppe. Bumin, the founder of the Turk Empire, died soon after his victory and was followed by his son Kuo-lo, who ruled only a few months. From the very formation the Turk empire was bifocal. The eastern part, centered on Mongolia, had the supremacy of the two halves. It was ruled by Muhan (553-572), son of Bumin, whereas the western parts fell to Bumin’s brother Ishtemi (553-?). Together, they are the founding fathers of the First Turk khaganate. Because of the large size of the territory, which was controlled by the Turks there existed an administrative division, while retaining significant powers of local rulers. Menander Byzantine, wrote that the First Turk khaganate was divided into four parts. Chinese sources also note a clear division into four administrative units – Central, East, West and the Western Frontier regions. The ruler of the Central region was the Great Khagan. Muhan embarked upon a series of military conquests. He wiped out the last identifiable military forces of the Juan-juan. In the east Muhan defeated the Kitans, in the north he incorporated the Kirgiz into his realm; in the west he defeated the Hephthalites; his might extended from the Pacific to the Western Sea and to Lake Baikal in the north, he subdued «all the countries outside China», as it was rapturously written in Chou shu. Also Muhan was nominally created with the defeat of the Hephthalites, the campaign against them was probably led by Ishtemi, his uncle, who was in charge of the Western Frontier Region. The Hephthalite State was destroyed between 557-561 through the joint action of the Turk khagan Ishtemi and Khosrow I 27\n\nAnushrven, king of the Persians. Cooperation between the Sassanid King and the Turks was not uniformly harmonious; though their alliance was strengthen by Khosrow’s marrying a daughter of the Turk ruler. In their contacts with Byzantium, Persians and Turks both claimed suzerainty over the land of the defunct Hephthalite Empire, the partition of which created a new situation in Central Asia. Since 527 Persia and Byzantium were engaged in a series of wars. The appearance of major power and potential ally on Persian’s eastern border was a fact which Byzantine diplomacy could ill afford to ignore. In contract, an alliance with Byzantium directed against the Persians would have held little political promise for the Turks, whose cooperation with Khosrow – as a joint campaign against the Hephthalites showed could be fruitful. But the deterioration of Turko-Persian relations occurred as Sogdian merchants in pursuit of profit from the trade in silk with Iran and Byzantium had made efforts to this. Sogdian merchants, to whom at the Hephthalite’s power, silk trade effectively assigned, convinced their new lord, the Turk khagan, to send in 568 – a commercial mission to Persia, in order to obtain permission for carry out trade in silk within the country. Although the mission was carried out under the patronage of the Turks, in fact it was Sogdian headed by Sogdian Maniakh. However, Khosrov, fearing the Turks free access to his country and disinterested in a sharp increase in import silk in the Iranian market, what would lower the income of local silk weaving production, bought the silk brought by Maniakh and then burned it. Then Maniakh made an attempt to find a buyer of the silk in the face of Byzantium. In 568, he arrived in Byzantium at the head of the embassy before the eyes of the Byzantine Emperor Justin II who received the Turks with much attention. Byzantium also as Iran was not in acute need of the Sogdian silk, but was interested in an alliance with the Turks against the Persians. So, knowing about it, the Sogdian ambassadors sought to conclude a trade agreement. So the Turkic embassy was received at the imperial court and a military agreement against Iran between the Turks and the Byzantine Empire was signed. The response embassy came to the Turks in August 569 under the leadership of the strategus Zemerhos. Menander gave a detailed and trustworthy account of Zemarkhos' journey to the Turks. 28\n\nManiakh invited Zemarkhos to accompany him on a foray against the Persians. Zemarkhos was also present at an altercation between his host and a Persian ambassador. The Turkic attack on Iran finished with the capture of a several wealthy cities in Gurgan, and soon retur of the Turks to Sogd in 569. Following it Ishtemi carried military operations to the Volga, by 571, he had won the North Caucasus, and soon reached the Bosporus (Kerch). With these actions Khagan cleared roundabout way to Byzantium (through KKhwarezm, the Volga region, the Caucasus and Crimea). In the period between 568 and 576 diplomatic contacts were frequent; the Byzantine historian Menander mentioned seven Roman embassies to the Turks. The inControline war in the First Turk khaganate inside the ruling clan for the inheritance lasted more than twenty years and ended in 603 with the disintegration into two states – the Western Turk khaganate in Central Asia, including Dzhungaria and a part of Eastern Turkestan and Eastern Turk khaganate in Mongolia. It should be noted that the Western Turk khaganate (its self-designation was «On Ok Eli» – «The Ten Arrows State») very considerably differed from the Turk khaganate in the east. In the Western Turk khaganate nomadic life prevailed, but in the Eastern Turk khaganate most part of the population was settled and occupied with farming and trade. The social structure of the Western Turk khaganate was much more complex, it could be rightfully regarded as an early state. On the territory of the Western Turk khaganate existed urban and agricultural culture. There were created with the help of the Sogdians, who put their trade and agricultural colonies on the Great Silk Road – in Semirechye, Dzhungaria, Eastern Turkestan, Northern China. In the V-VII centuries Sogdian intensive colonization in the valleys of the rivers Chu, Talas, Ili resulted in the emergence of a dozen cities and fortified settlements there. Only in the Chu Valley in the VI-VIII centuries there were at least 18 large cities and small settlements. In the Western Turk khaganate the khagan’s power was not as strong as in the east. In consequence of the weakness of the khagan’s power and the fact that tribal nobility was in a constant state of struggle, positions of small and large Sogdian merchants were extremely profitable. They had an opportunity to act as a third force in any large internal or external conflict. Although Turkic 29\n\nkhagans called the Sogdians as tatami – subjects, but their role was very significant, since they control the whole economic life of the state. Control questions: 1. Prove the following statement: the ancient Turks were widely included in international relations of that time (with the Hephthalite Empire, Sasanian Iran and the Byzantium Empire). 2. Define the main stages of the First Turk khaganate political history (551-630). 3. Prove the following thesis: the Western Turk khaganate highly significantly differed from the Turk khaganate in the East. 4. Define the Sogdian’s role in the life of the First Turk khaganate.\n\n2.2. Kazakhstan lands under the Western Turk khagans and its successors’ power The heyday of the Western Turk khaganate came at the time of Shegui (609-618) and Tong Yabghu khagan (619-630) reign. It was the time of the greaControl territorial expansion of the Western Turks. So, Shegui made Altai the eastern border of the khaganate and extended his rule to the Tarim Basin and the Eastern Pemir region. Tong Yabghu (also known as T'ung Yabghu, Ton Yabghu, Tong Yabghu khagan, Tun Yabghu, and Tong Yabğu, T’ung yabghu khagan) was khagan of the Western Turkic khaganate from 618 to 630 C.E. His name is usually translated as «Tiger Yabgu» in old Turkic. Another interpretation of his name is «sufficiency» or «completeness». He was the brother of Shegui (611-618), the previous khagan of the western GökTurks, and was a member of the Ashina clan. Tong Yabghu's reign is generally regarded as the zenith of the Western Turk khaganate3. It was the time of the greaControl territorial expansion of the Western Turks. So, Shegui made Altai the eastern border of the khaganate and extended his rule to the Tarim Basin and the Eastern Pemir region. Tong Yabghu revived active western policy of the khaganate and carried his winter residence to Suyab – a large trade-handicraft center in the Chu Valley (now close 3\n\n30\n\nTong-Yabghu-Kagan // See: http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia.\n\nby Tokmak in Kyrgizstan), but the summer residence – to MingBulak village (not far from Turkestan city). New campaigns widened the Western Turk khaganate borders to the Amu-Darya River and the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountain system. Tong Yabghu maintained close relations with the Tang Dynasty of China, and may have married into the Imperial family. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang visited the western GökTurk capital Suyab in modern Kyrgyzstan and left a description of the khagan. Xuanzang described the khagan as follows: The khan wore a green satin robe; his hair, which was ten feet long, was free. A band of white silk wound round his forehead and hung down behind. The ministers of the presence numbering two hundred in number, all wearing embroidered robes, stood on his right and left. The rest of his military retinue [was] clothed in fur, serge and fine wool, the spears and standards and bows in order, and the riders of camels and horses stretched far out of [sight]. Tong Yehu Khagan is a man of bravery and astuteness. He is good at art of war. Thus he controlled Tiele tribes to the north, confronted Persia to the west, connected with Kasmira (nowadays Kashmir) to the south. All countries are subjected to him. He controlled ten thousands of men with arrow and bow, establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa. Tong Yehu Khagan also sent a Tutun to monitor them for imposition. The power of Western Turks had never reached such a state before\". Tong Yabghu's empire fought with the Sassanids of Iran. In the early 620's the khagan's nephew Buri-sad led a series of raids across the Caucasus Mountains into Persian territory. Scholarly consensus has identified Tong Yabghu as the Ziebel mentioned in Byzantine sources as having (as khagan of the Khazars) campaigned with the Emperor Heraclius in the Caucasus against the Sassanid Persian Empire in 627-628. or any Khazar ruler) and may actually have died as early as 626. These scholars point to discrepancies in the dates between Byzantine and Chinese sources and argue that definitively conflating Ziebel with Tong Yabghu is an exaggeration of the extant evidence. In 627 the Turks penetrated the Gates of Alexander and sacked the city of Derbent (The Citadel, Ancient City and Fortress 31\n\nBuildings of Derbent are part of a strategic Sasanian defence system from the 5th century. Derbent is situated on the western shores of the Caspian Sea, in present-day Dagestan. It was in the position to control the traffic between Europe and the Middle East, and shield the prospering agricultural peoples of the Middle East from devastating raids of nomadic tribes from the steppes of SouthEastern Europe). Movses khagankatvatsi describes the attack thus: «Like waves in the sea, the Turks fell on the town of Chora (Derbent) and destroyed it completely. Seeing the terrible threat posed by this vile, ugly, horde of attackers, with their slanting and lidless eyes, and their flowing hair like that of women, the inhabitants were seized by terror. Especially terrifying were the archers, who were skillful and powerful, and rained arrows down like hail then, like savage wolves, shamelessly through themselves on the people and mercilessly cut them down in the streets and squares of the town. They did not even take pity on the children who hugged their slaughtered mothers, but sucked the children's blood like milk». The Derbent sparked panic all over the country. Albanian forces withdrew to their capital, Partav, then headed into the Caucasus Mountains. The GökTurks and Khazars overtook them near the village of Kalankatuyk, where they were either slain or taken prisoner. The conquerors imposed upon Albania a heavy system of taxation, as reported by Movses: «The Lord of the North [one of the titles of the GökTurk khagan) wreaked havoc all over the country. He sent his wardens to deal with artisans of all kind, especially those skilled in washing out gold, extraction of silver and iron, as well as making copper items. He imposed duties on fishers and goods from the great Kura and Aras rivers, in addition to the didrachma traditionally levied by the Persian authorities». Later that year Tong Yabghu's army joined Heraclius in the siege of Tfilis. Heraclius and Tong Yabghu met under the walls of Narikala. The yabghu rode up to the emperor, kissed his shoulder and made a bow. In return, Heraclius hugged his ally, called him his son, and crowned him with his own diadem. During the ensuing feast the Khazar leaders received ample gifts in the shape of earrings and clothes, while the yabghu was promised the hand of the emperor's daughter, Eudoxia Epiphania. Tong Yabghu placed an army of 40,000 Khazar horsemen 32\n\nat Heraclius' disposal. The initial seige of Tfilis was unsuccessful; both leaders were ridiculed by the Georgian defenders of the city. In 628 Heraclius struck southwards into Persia while Tong Yabghu's army again besieged Tfilis, this time successfully. Many of the defenders were executed, blinded, or mutilated4. Tong Yabghu could establish stronger control in the practically independent before Central Asian states, that earlier only paid taxes. The Western Turkic khaganate had the territory from the Tashkent oasis to the territories of southern Afganistan and north-western Pakistan. Tong Yabghu appointed governors or tuduns to manage the various tribes and people under his over lordship. Besides, Tong Yabghu granted Turkic titles to local Central Asian rulers, as if including them in the administrative hierarchy of the khaganate. And with the purpose to strengthen still more relations with local rulers, he married his daughter to the most powerful of them – the Samarkand ruler. But the tribal nobility did not like despotic character of his governing and in the Western Turkic khaganate began an inter-tribal war. As a result by 630-634 the Western Turkic khaganate had already lost its Central Asian possessions to the west from the Syr Darya river. The Western Turkic khaganate entered into a protracted political crisis, the main reason of which was struggle for power between the nobility of two confederations – the tension between Dulu and Nushibi. In 634 Yshbara Elterish Shir-kagan, supported by Nushibi came to power. Ye carried out reforms, according to which the Irkins and Chors’ chief turned into the rulers appointed by him. Besides, in each area was sent a khagan tribe member-Shad, who not connected with the tribal nobility. With these reforms he wanted to restrict influence and power of local chiefs. But resources of the khaganate turned out to the insufficient to hold tribes in obedience. Thus in 638 Dulu proclaimed khagan one of the sheds, sent to them. After the war between Dulu and Nushibi the Western Turkic khaganate disintegrated into two parts, the border line between which lay along the Ili River. Intertribal dynasty war continued the following 17 years.\n\n4 Tong-Yabghu-Khagan see; http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Tong-YabghuKhagan.\n\n33\n\n(640-657) and led to invasion of Chinese troops in Semirechye. Following the death of Tong Yabghu in ca. 630, the might of the Western GökTurks largely collapsed. Tang China tried to rule over the Western Turks relyinf upon its protégé from the Ashina clan. But the Western Turks did not stop their struggle for independence. The Turgesh khaganate seems to have come into existence towards the end of the 7th century, after a massive revolt against the Western Turks khan, a Chinese puppet. The Turgesh leader was Ushyly (Wushile), who titled himself Baga Tarkhan and led a strong army to victory, putting the puppet khan to full speed flight. His power soon spanned from the present-day Semirechye area to Turfan and Kucha. Ushyly khagan then decided to ally with Tang China and the Kyrgyz people to stem the rise of the Second GökTurk Empire, ruled by Khapghan khagan. In the Chui River и Ili River Valleys he established khagan’s headquarters, the country was divided into 20 regions. Turgesh and GökTurks/Turküts clashed in 698 in a battle fought at Bolchu (in modern Dzhungaria) where the latter side, led by Bilge Tonyukhukh, prevailed: the Yabgu (Ruler of West) and Shad (Ruler of East) of the Turgesh were killed and Ushyly Khaghan himself was taken a prisoner and had to concede vassalage. Eight years after this burning defeat, Ushyly died and was replaced by his son, Soko, who fought to retain independence from the GökTurks/Turküts. The successor of Ushyly khagan Soko defeated the rebelled tribes supported by the Chinese troops. Soko wanted to make Tang China stop invasions in Semirechye. He implemented this task. He was defeated in 701 in Transoxiana, southeast of Samarkand, again by Tonyukhukh, and finally in 711, when he was killed at Bolchu against Kül Tigin and Bilge Shad as he was trying to strike an alliance with Tang China. The Turgesh were put under the rule of Bars Bek; as we know from the Orkhon Inscriptions in those years the main subdivision in Kara (Black) and Sary (Yellow) Turgesh was established. Maybe sensing the impending disaster, Soko's brother Chenu had revolted even before the battle and fled to the court of Khapghan Khaghan. In 711 г. the Eastern Turks defeated Soko’s troops in Dzhungaria and till 715 The Turgesh khaganate stopped its existence. Three years later the Kara Turgesh elected Sulu as their Khaghan. The new ruler moved his capital to Balasagun in 34\n\nthe Chu valley, receiving the homage of several chieftains formerly bond to the service of Bilge Khaghan of the Turküt. He had to struggle on two fronts. In the west the Arabs, who on 714-715 carried on campaigns beyond the Syr Darya threatened the Turgesh. In the east the Chinese threatened the Turgesh. Sulu took action to neutralize the eastern threat. For that in 717 г. he went to a diplomatic trip to Chang'an-the capital of Tang Empire. After that he contracted conjugal unions with three potentially dangerous rulers. He got married to a daughter of Western Turks descendant from Ashina clan, thereby, having legitimated his power. The second wife became a daughter of Bilge Khaghan – the ruler of the Eastern Turk khaganate. The Tibet Tsar’s daughter Sulu became his third wife. Sulu acted as a bulwark against further Umayyad encroachment from the south: the Arabs had indeed become a major player in recent times, despite Islam had not made many converts in Central Asia (that would need some two or three more centuries). Sulu's aim was to reconquer all of Transoxiana from the Arab invaders - his war was paralleled, much more westwards, by the Khazar empire. In 721 Turgesh forces, led by Kül Chor, defeated the Caliphal army commanded by Sa'id ibn Abdu'l-Aziz near Samarkand. Sa'id's successor, Al-Kharashi, massacred Turks and Sogdian refugees in Khujand, causing an influx of refugees towards the Turgesh. In 724 Caliph Hisham sent a new governor to Khorasan, Muslim ibn Sa'id, with orders to crush the «Turks» once and for all, but, confronted by Sulu Khagan, Muslim hardly managed to reach Samarkand with a handful of survivors, as the Turgesh raided freely. A string of subsequent appointees of Hisham were soundly defeated by Sulu Khagan, who in 728 even managed to take Bukhara and later on still inflicted painful tactical defeats upon the Arabs, discrediting Umayyad rule and maybe putting the foundations for the Abbasid revolution. The Turgesh state was at its apex of glory, controlling Sogdiana, the Ferghana Valley It was only in 732, that two powerful Arab expeditions to Samarakand managed, if with embarrassing losses, to reestablish Caliphal authority in the area; Sulu renounced his ambitions over Samarkand and abandoned Bukhara, with drawing north. In 734 an early Abbasid follower, Kha'ris ibn Suraidj, 35\n\nrose in revolt against Umayyad rule and took Balkh and Marv before defecting to the Turgesh three years later, defeated. In 738 Sulu Khaghan, along with his allies Kha'ris, Gurak (a Turco-Sogdian leader) and men from Usrushana, Tashkent and Khuttal to lauch a final offensive. He entered Jowzjan but was defeated by the Umayyad governor Ased at the Battle of Sa'n or Kharistan. The defeat meant death for Sulu – as soon as he was back in Balasaghun he was murdered at the hands of Baga Tarkhan Kül Chor, leader of the Sary (Yellow) Turgesh. This, in turn, laid the foundations for the early demise of the Turgesh Empire, who had so far challenged the might of the Caliphate. When Sulu Khaghan was killed the Kara and Sary (Black and Yellow) Turgesh began a civil war. Kül Chor of the Sary Türgish vanquished his rival Tumoche of the Kara Turgesh and ascended to khanship, not before slaying Sulu's sons. In 739 he enriched his criminal record by killing Hin of the GökTurk Ashina clan, the «legitimate» puppet-khaghan in Tang service. The Chinese reacted by supporting the rebellious Kara Turgesh, which in 742 found in Iltutmish Khutlugh Bilge a new Khaghan, later succeeded by Tengrideh Bolmysh in 753. This last ruler declared himself a vassal of Moyun Chor, the ruling Khaghan of the recently born Orkhon Uyghur empire. The Turgesh civil war came to a sudden end only in 766, when annals record that the Qarluqs smashed the Turgesh. The Qarluqs were the forerunners of the later Karakhanid Muslim state. But the Chinese’s successes people are seriously concerned the governor of the Abbasid Caliphate in the Arab Khorasan (a region located in north eastern Iran) and called opposition from the Qarluqs. In the middle of the VII c. the Qarluqs actively showed themselves in the political life of the Western Turk khaganate, where they controlled the Dzhungar-Altai region and Tokharistan – a name which was given to Bactria (Bactriana, in Persian, was the ancient Greek name of the country between the range of the Hindu Kush and the Amu Darya (Oxus). They remained in the Chinese sphere of influence and an active participant in fighting the Muslim expansion into the area, up until their betrayal of the Tang at the Battle of Talas in 751. In 751 the Chinese and Arabs troops met on the Talas River and several days did not make their mind to join the battle. On the fifth day of withstanding the Qarluqs 36\n\ntook in the rear of the Chinese, thereby having achieved a turning point in the battle in favor of the Arabs. Battle of Talas in 751 was a conflict between the Arab Abbasid Caliphate and the Chinese Tang Dynasty for control of the Syr Darya. The Chinese army was defeated following the routing of their troops by the Abbasids on the bank of the Talas River. The defeat was partly a result of the defection of Qarluq mercenaries and the retreat of Ferghana valleys who originally supported the Chinese. The Ferghana forces successfully (though inadvertently) cut the Chinese troops off from the rest of their army and their route of retreat. The commander of the Tang forces, Gao Xianzhi, realized his defeat was imminent and managed to escape with some of his Tang regulars with the help of Li Siye. Despite losing the battle, Li did inflict heavy losses on the pursuing Arab army after being reproached by Duan Xiushi. Though Gao was able to rebuild his forces within months, he never again gained the confidence of the local tribes residing in the area. The Chinese name Daluosi was first seen in the account of Xuanzang. Du Huan located the city near the western drain of the Chui River. The exact location of the battle has not been confirmed but is believed to be near Taraz (once named Zhambyl), in present day Kazakhstan. Shortly after the battle of Talas, the domestic rebellion of An Lushan (755－763) and subsequent warlords (763 onwards), caused the decline of Tang influence in Central Asia by the end of the 700's. The local Tang tributaries then switched to the authority of the Abbasids, Tibetans, or Uighurs and the introduction of Islam was thus facilitated among the Turkic peoples. Well supported by the Ummayads, the Qarluqs established a state that would be absorbed in the late 9th century by the Kara-Khanid Khanate. With the successful cooperation of Arabs and Turkic peoples, Islam began to exert its influence on the Turkic culture. Among the earliest historians to proclaim the importance of this battle was the great Russian historian of Muslim central Asia, Barthold, according to whom, «The earlier Arab historians, occupied with the narrative of events then taking place in western Asia, do not mention this battle; but it is undoubtedly of great importance in the history of (Western) Turkestan as it determined the question which of the two civilizations, the Chinese or the Muslim, should predominate in the 37\n\nland (of Turkestan)». However, claims that the battle itself was significant are not well-supported by historical evidence. The dry and simplistic recounting of the battle itself in Chinese accounts shows that it may have been no more than a border skirmish. Most of the sources for this battle barely mention the Chinese defeat, leaving a duration of five days undescribed, with exception for the dialogues after the defeat. According to Barthold, for the history of the first three centuries of Islam, al-Tabari was the chief source (survived in Ibn al Athir's compilation), which was brought down to 915. (Unfortunately, this important work was only compiled and published by a group of Orientalists in 1901.) It is only in Athir that we find an accurate account of the conflict between the Arabs and the Chinese in 751, one which decided the fate of the western part of central Asia. Neither Tabari nor the early historical works of the Arabs which have come down to us in general make any mention of this; however, Athir's statement is completely confirmed by the Chinese History of the Tang Dynasty. It must be noted that in all Arab sources, the events which occurred in the eastern part of the empire are often dealt with briefly. Another notable informant of the battle on the Muslim side was Al-Dhahabi (1274-1348). It is of interest to note that the Battle of Talas is seen as the key event in the technological transmission of the paper-making process. The Chinese court eunuch Cai Lun had invented the process in 105 CE. After the battle of Talas, knowledgeable Chinese prisoners of war were ordered to produce paper in Samarkand, and by the year 794 CE, a paper mill could be found in Baghdad, modern-day Iraq. The technology of paper making was thus transmitted to the Islamic world and later to the West. Other than the transfer of paper, there is no evidence to support a geopolitical or demographic change resulting from this battle. Several of the factors after the battle had been taken note of prior to 751. Firstly, the Qarluq never in any sense remained opposed to the Chinese after the battle. In 753, the Qarluq Yabgu Dunpijia submitted under the column of Cheng Qianli and captured A-Busi, a betrayed Chinese mercenary of Tongluo (Tiele) chief (who had defected earlier in 743), and received his title in the court on October 22. Nor did the Chinese expansion halt after the battle; the Chinese commander Feng Changqing, who took over the 38\n\nposition from Gao Xianzhi through Wang Zhengjian, virtually swept across the Kashmir region and captured Gilgit shortly in the same year. The Chinese influence to the west of the Pemir Mountains certainly did not cease as the result of the battle; the Ferghana, who participated in the battle earlier, in fact joined among the central Asian auxiliaries with the Chinese army under a summons and entered Gansu during An Lushan's revolt in 756. Neither did the relations between the Chinese and Arabs worsen, as the Abbasids, like their predecessors (since 652), continued to send embassies to China uninterruptedly after the battle. Such visits had overall resulted in 13 diplomatic gifts between 752－798. Not all Turkic tribes of the region converted to Islam after the battle either – the date of their mass-conversion to Islam was much later, in the 10th century under Musa5. The Qarluqs with their participation in the Battle of Talas in 751 did not spoil relations with Tang China. The reason for approaching the Qarluqs and the Chinese became their common struggle against the Uighurs’ strengthening. In 752 the Qarluqs, having enlisted the Chinese support declared war on the Uighurs. The Qarluq Yabgu struggled for the Eastern Turk khaganate inheritance. His allies became the Yenisei Kyrghyz, Basmils и Turgesh. The war with variable success lasted two years and waged in the very center of the Uighurs lands. With great troubles the head of the Uighurs achieved victory. Consequences of the war were the great importance for the Qarluqs future. The Qarluq Yabgu once and for all lost hopes concerning the khaganate and stopped his struggle for the Turk inheritance. Since then his aspirations were directed on capturing Semirechye and consolidating in Dzhungar and towns of the Tarim Basin. В Semirechye the Qarluqs met with resistance not small Turgesh principalities that on the contrary became allies and vassals of Yabgu, but the Oghuz tribes. General events of the struggle with the Oghuz have been poorly reflected in sources. It is known that in the second half of the VIII в. Oghuz left Semirechye и and went to lower reaches of the Syr Darya. Their head took the Yabgu title, aspirating domination over the Western Turk tribes. During the ninth and tenth centuries, the nomadic Turkic Oghuz 5 Battle of Talas in 751. See online encyclopedia Statemaster.com URL: http://www.statemaster.com/encyclopedia/Battle-of-Talas.\n\n39\n\ntribes formed a principality on the middle and lower reaches of the Syr Darya (Jaxartes), in the Aral Sea region and the area of the northern Caspian with its Yangikent, the town on the Syr Darya. The Oghuz’s power was finally consolidated in Semirechye in 766., when they occupied towns Taraz и Suab. Then the Qarluks began was with the Uighurs for Eastern Turkestan. Despite failures in the wars of the beginning of the IX в. the Qarluqs’s situation, supported by rich Semirechye towns was firm. Trade with Turkic slaves for Abbasids’s quad and control over transit to China on the area from Taraz to Issyk-Kul lake favoured the Yabgu’s enrichment. The futher history of the Qarluqs was absorbed in the late of the 9th century by the Kara-Khanid Khanate. In the East of the Kazakhstan in the Irtysh river steppes formed a community of Turkic tribes, which were called the Kimeks, by contemprory authors. Up to the middle of the eighth century, they lived with the Turkic tribes of the southern Altai and the Tarbagatay to the south and the Kyrgyz of the Yenisei to the east. At some time during the second half of the eighth century or at the beginning of the ninth, the Kimek clans and several tribes moved to north-eastern Semirechye and the foothills of the Dzhungar range, while at the same time, the Kipchak tribes of the Irtysh migrated southwards and westwards. From the ninth to the eleventh century, the Kimek were more densely concentrated in the basin of the middle Irtysh and in north-eastern Semirechye. Individual Kimek groups and a large proportion of the Kipchak occupied the steppes of central Kazakhstan and the northern Lake Balkhash region, extending as far west as the Aral Sea region and the southern Urals. On the middle reaches of the Syr Darya, they roamed the area of Sawran and the town of Turkistan, while their eastern borders stretched to the Tarbagatay Mountains and the Dzhungarian Alatau. Up to the middle of the seventh century, the Kimek, along with other steppe peoples, had been part of the Khaganate of the Western Turks. After its collapse in 656, they gradually developed into an independent tribal confederation. This process received considerable impetus during the ninth century from the fall of the Uighur Khaganate. The head of the Kimek, who had previously held the modest title of shad tutuk, was subsequently called the Khagan. According to Arab and Persian writers of the ninth to the twelfth century, the Khagan enjoyed 40\n\nconsiderable power appointing the leaders of tribes, referred to in the sources as muluk (kings). According to al-Idrisi, power in the clan of the Kimek rulers was transmitted on a hereditary basis. The supreme ruler, the Khagan, had eleven ‘stewards’ whose duties were also transmitted from father to son and he and his court nobles resided in a capital situated in the valley of the Irtysh The Kimek principality, formed at the end of the ninth century and the beginning of the tenth, was divided into a number of domains like the later ulus. The rulers of these appanages, who were the descendants of hereditary tribal rulers, received their lands from the Khagan in return for military service. Some Kimek groups moved for the winter to the steppes between the Ural and the Emba and spent the summer as nomads in the area of the Irtysh, especially when there were severe winters in what is now eastern and central Kazakhstan. Some of the Oghuz also moved to pastures in the Kimek country near Lake Mankur, probably in the foothills of the Alatau. Like the Kipchak and the Oghuz, the Kimek bred horses, sheep, goats, oxen, cows and camels. Sheep, in particular, played an important part in their economy. al-Idrisi, describing the life of the nomads, writes that they ‘used fat instead of vegetable oil and tallow for lighting’. The horses of the steppedwellers were noted for their hardiness and their ability to adapt to the harsh conditions of the arid zone. Gardızı refers to the huge herds of horses raised by the Kimek, and al-Idrisi notes that the nomads preferred horsemeat to beef or mutton and made koumiss (a drink of fermented mares’ milk). The Kimek also possessed cattle, i.e. cows and oxen; these tended to be owned by semisedentary elements, although oxen were also used as draught animals. The steppedwellers usually harnessed them to carts on which they placed their yurts (wooden-framed tents covered with felt). Like the Oghuz and the Kipchak, the Kimek hunted furry animals such as the fox, marten and beaver, and further took the pelts of sable, ermine and predators like tigers and snow leopards. The fur and hides of wild animals and the meat and skins of domestic livestock were sold or exchanged at points adjacent to the settled lands in the south. In the ninth and tenth centuries, the Kimek state was one of the strongest nomadic powers in Central Asia, but it gradually began to decline when the system of semi- independent domains sapped the authority of the Khagans, so 41\n\nthat the Kimek tribal entity collapsed, unable to withstand the pressure of neighboring nomadic peoples6.

Cultural heritage of the Turks 2.3.1. Religions and beliefs of ancient Turks This chapter was written on the base of the article «Ancient Turkic Religious Beliefs (before islam)7». The religious beliefs in the early Turkish states on the plateaus of Central Asia coalesced around three main points. The first of these was a belief in animistic forces. These early Turks attributed conscious life and a discrete in-dwelling spirit to every material form of nature (such as plants and stones), to celestial bodies (sun, moon, stars), and to natural phenomena (storms, earthquakes, etc.). The Uighurs, for example, practiced a form of astrology in which the movements of the moon and stars were consulted before setting out a campaign. The second was an ancestral cult in which the memories of departed ancestors and leaders were kept alive through reverence and animal sacrifice. Upon a death, a period of mourning was observed. The dead were buried, cremated or mummified. A kurgan (earthen barrow), mound or cairn of stones was erected so that the departed 6 Agajanov S. G.

The third element was the worship of the sky god (Gok Tangri). While animism and ancestral cults are common among early tribal cultures, this particular form of sky god worship appears only among the Turks. In this system of belief, the sky god is the Supreme Being. The Blue Turks (who called themselves KokTürk) believed that their empire's formation was a consequence of the sky god's wishes and that their khagan (leader) had been sent to them by their god. Tangri took a personal interest in the independent existence of the Turks, and victory in battle was a result of Tangri's will. Tangri commanded and punished the disobedient, and life and death alike were dependent upon his will. Tangri granted life and could take it back whenever he wished. According to these early Turkish beliefs, Tangri was eternal and the creator of all that existed. He was also singular and could not be reduced to any material form. This is why one never finds idols to Tangri or temples to put them in. Tangri was a great, solitary, spiritual power. The sun, moon, stars, fire and rivers were his hallowed assistants who occupied positions much like the angels, prophets and scriptures of the Semitic deities. During the Uighur period (these were one of Turkic peoples who dominated Mongolia and eastern Turkestan from the eighth to the 12th centuries, now inhabiting northwestern China), the sky god cult was still practiced but had begun to encounter competition from Manichaeanism and Buddishm, which were spreading among the Turks. Both faiths became particularly entrenched during the Uighur control of Turkistan. The original writing system of the Blue Turks was supplanted by that of the Uighurs, which was based on the Sogdian. Under the Uighurs, Buddhist and Manichaean scriptures were translated, and a rich liturgical literature developed. Some time before the 10th century, the Uighurs invented a system of printing that involved making impressions of single-letter molds on paper. This was the forerunner of the printing press and modern printing technology. The communities of the early steppe lander (steppe-dwellers) Turks tended to be political associations rather than religious ones, and for that reason religious leaders did not play as great a role 43\n\namong them as they did among desert and forest-dwellers. The religious beliefs of these people were centered around three fundamental tenets. The first of these was a worship of the forces of nature. Early Turks attributed conscious life and a discrete in-dwelling spirit to mountains, hills, rocks, valleys, streams, springs, caves, trees, volcanic lakes, iron and sword handles. Celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars and natural phenomena such as lightning and thunder were thought to be spirits or deities. There were both good spirits and evil ones. In some inscriptions there are also references to a goddess whose name is given as Umay (Umai). Such animistic beliefs are common among all early tribal cultures. For instance among the Asian Huns, horses and sheep were sacrificed to the sky god, to ancestors, and to the forces of nature during the first month of the year at the palace of their ruler, and in late spring (June) in the vicinity of the Ongkin river. The Blue Turks and Uighurs made similar sacrifices during the same month at the source of the Temir river. The Huns also conducted a similar ritual in the fall at Tai-lin. Among the Blue Turks, there were three sacred rituals held during the year in which sacrifices were offered to Tangri (the sky god) and to ancestors. Both the Blue Turks and Uighurs practiced astrology, determining the advisability of courses of action upon the positions and movement of the planets and stars. The Tabgatch planted beech trees by their graves and regarded them as sacred. Forces of nature called yer-sub (in modern Kazakh, «jer-su», meaning «earth-andwater») were genies or sprits dwelling in hills and springs that were considered to be sacred (iduk) places. Tamik-iduk-bas and Idukotuken are two such sites. In the Uighurs' Kutlu-Dag Efsanesi («Legend of Happy-Mountain»), a rock is held to be sacred because its houses a spirit that gives people strength and fortitude. To cause rain or hail to fall or to make the wind blow, the ancient Turks had recourse to a natural magic involving a stone that they believed to be sacred. The second pillar of this religion was an ancestral cult. The worship of departed leaders and the veneration of ancestors are thought to be a manifestation of a patriarchal social order in religion. The Asian Huns, Tabgatch and Blue Turks frequently offered 44\n\nsacrifices to their ancestors at the mouths of sacred caverns. The deep respect that was held for ancestors is one reason why grave robbery and the despoliation of Turkic tombs was punished so severely. A kurgan, mound or cairn of stones was erected so that the departed spirit would have a place to call its own. Sometimes stone statues (called balbal) were also set up. Only animals, however, were sacrificed to Tangri and ancestors. Human sacrifice was never practiced among the Turks. Only males were chosen as sacrificial animals, and the most valuable of these was of course the horse. Skeletons of sacrificed horses are found frequently in steppe lander Turkic tombs everywhere, from the empire of the Asian Huns to the Hun-Avar tombs of Central Asia. The third element was the worship of the sky god. This was the fundamental creed of the ancient Turks, and in this particular form appears only among them. In this system of belief, the sky god (Tangri, Tengri) is the Supreme Being, the central object of all worship, the source of all power. The Old Turks followed a religious tradition that blended shamanism with what Western scholars have named «Tengrism», a faith worshiping Heaven (Türk. Tengri) as the supreme God and venerating certain mountains as seats of power. Tengrism was never an organized religion and appeared in several forms among almost all the peoples of the Central Asian steppes – Türk, Mongol, and Tangut alike. In its Turkic form, it supported the Turkic social structure, which was built on the basis of a hierarchy of tribes. One tribe is dominant and its chief is the source of a hereditary line of rulers for all. The Turkic form of Tengrism, then, regards any Turkic chief controlling Otukan as supreme ruler (Türk. qaghan) of all Turkic tribes and embodiment of society’s fortune. If Turkic society’s fortune declined, the Khagan was accountable and could even be sacrificed. His son would then succeed to his position. The principle beliefs and practices of the Tangri cult can be more or less determined by a study of Chinese sources and the Orkhon monuments. In a letter sent to the Chinese emperor by Motun, the ruler of the Asian Huns, the latter notes that he had been elevated to the throne by Tangri and that his military victories were won first and foremost by virtue of the sky god's grace.
