        "text": "The tamga signs and titles engraved on coins represent symbols of ruling dynasties and the states they had founded and were associated both with the territory where they ruled, as well as with their origin (ethnicity). In this regard of particular interest are Old Turkic tamgas and titles (“Qaghan”, “Yabghu” (?), “Tegin”, “Tarkhan”) available on the pre-Islamic Turkic coins of Tokharistan region (South- ern Uzbekistan – Southern Tadjikistan – Northern Afghanistan) with Sogdian scripts. On the early medie- val coins of Chach related to the Western Turkic Qaghanate (568-740), there are four types of tamgas – a lyre-shaped one with its varieties, a tamga in the form of two crossed swords, an anchor-form tamga and the diamond-form one, and the fact comes under notice that similar tamgas were engraved on the coins of the Northern Tokharistan of the epoch. Appearance of these tamgas and titles in the territory of Chach and Tokharistan in the Early Middle Ages is directly related to political activities of the Western Turkic Qaghanate and ethno-cultural processes which were taking place in Central Asia.\n\nThe general supposition among Turcologists that there are no inscriptions in Turkic remained from the First Turkic Khaganate has created a “vacuum” in the field about what the official (written) language of the Khaganate was. Although one and only one inscription was based upon as a very weak and insufficient basis, this vacuum was first wanted to be filled with Sogdian, regarding the Sogdian part of the (bilingual) Bugut inscription, one of the inscriptions Bugut and Khüis Tolgoi which are supposed to be the only inscriptions remained from the First Turkic Khaganate. However, together with that the part in Brāhmī script of the Bugut inscription, and the Khüis Tolgoi inscription again in Brāhmī script, which were not able to be read afore, have recently been read being interpreted as a kind of early Mongolic or para-Mongolic, a second official language has been claimed for the First Turkic Khaganate besides Sogdian: “written imperial Mongolic”, the state language of the Ruan-Ruan Empire. But the “new reality” we have exposed in this article is that First Turkic Khaganate left inscriptions in Turkic, that is to say, “the stage is not empty at all”. So, there is not any vacuum about what the official language of the First Turkic Khaganate was. Turkic runic script was in use even in the establishment of the First Turkic Khaganate (552) and on the basis of the existing documents in Turkic in runic script remained from that period, the official/written language of the First Turkic Khaganate was indisputably (“written imperial”) Turkic. Key Words: Tsetsüüh Roof Tile Inscription (552 AD), Kara Katu Inscription (593 AD), the official language of the First Turkic Khaganate.\n\nThe general supposition among Turcologists that there are no inscriptions in Turkic remained from the First Turkic Khaganate has created a \"vacuum” in the field about what the official (written) language of the Khaganate was.

Türklükbilimciler arasındaki, Birinci Türk Kağanlığından kalma Türkçe bir yazıt bulunmadığı genel sanısı, Kağanlığın resmi (yazı) dilinin ne olduğu konusunda alanda bir “boşluk” yaratmıştır. Bu boşluk ilkin, çok zayıf ve yetersiz bir temel olarak tek ve yalnızca bir tane yazıta dayanılıyor olsa da, Birinci Türk Kağanlığı döneminden kalma biricik yazıtlar olduğu sanılan Bugut ve Hüis Tolgoy yazıtlarından (iki dilli) Bugut yazıtının Soğdca bölümüne bakılarak Soğdca ile doldurulmak isteniyordu. Fakat yakın zamanda, daha önce okunamayan, Bugut yazıtının Brāhmı̇̄ yazılı bölümünün ve yine Brāhmı̇̄ yazılı Hüis Tolgoy yazıtının bir tür erken Moğolca ya da Moğolca-benzeri dil (ilgili araştırmacıların savıyla, Ruan-Ruanca) olarak yorumlanıp okunmasıyla birlikte, Birinci Türk Kağanlığı için Soğdcanın yanında ikinci bir resmi dil daha savlandı: Ruan-Ruan İmparatorluğunun devlet dili “yazılı imperyal Moğolca”. Ancak, bu makalede ortaya serdiğimiz “yeni gerçek” şudur ki Birinci Türk Kağanlığı Türkçe yazıtlar bırakmıştır, yani, “meydan hiç de boş değildir”. Dolayısıyla, Birinci Türk Kağanlığının resmi dilinin ne olduğu konusunda herhangi bir boşluk yoktur. Türk oyma yazısı daha Birinci Türk Kağanlığının kuruluşunda (MS 552) bile kullanımdaydı, ve o dönemden kalma, var olan oyma yazılı Türkçe belgeler temelinde, Birinci Türk Kağanlığının resmi/yazı dili tartışmasız biçimde (“yazılı imperyal”) Türkçe idi."
