        "text": "AA tower stands in barren grasslands around 80 kilometers east of Kyrgyzstanâ€™s capital, Bishkek, near the town of Tokmok. Locals call it the Burana Tower.\n\nAccording to legend, a Khan who governed the region in the tenth century built the monument. He had a daughter and hosted a big party when she was born. The ruler invited prominent fortune tellers of the land to join the celebrations.\n\nHe wanted to know what the future held for his baby girl. The soothsayers were unanimous: she would have a long, healthy life and do great things. Among them, one elderly man disagreed. The old fortune teller predicted that the girl would die at sixteen from a spider bite.\n\nShocked, the Khan immediately ordered the construction of a tall tower for the princess that no spider could reach.\n\nWhen she turned sixteen, Khan was convinced that his daughter was safe because of the security measures he had implemented. On her birthday, he presented her with a basket of the choicest fruits of the land. Unfortunately, a spider lurked in the basket and bit the princess, causing her death. Unable to cope with the shock, the Khan died as well, and a portion of the tower collapsed."
