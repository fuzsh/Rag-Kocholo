Turkic Khaganate (552-603) & West Turkic Khaganate(603-704)\n\nThe first mentions of Turks appeared in 542 year in the Chinese sources in which attacks tuzue (Turks) to China from northwest are described. Chinese considered Turks as descendants of hunnu tribes. In VI century the name “Turk” means union of the tribes which have been usual on Altai (mountains).\n\n7 The early Turkic state - Turkic khaganate ( ) has arisen in 551 year when the leader of Turks Bumyn has accepted the title- khagan. The next khagan became the Kara-khagan ( ), then Mukan-khagan ( ), later Taspar-khagan ( ). In years Mukan-kagan has concluded the union with Iran against Eftalits, and they were defeated. Turkic kaganate began to dominate in Central Asia. Then Turks have concluded the union with Byzantium against Persians and Persians have undertaken to pay a tribute.\n\n8 In 587 y.

The main headquarters was in Suyab city, and then it was transferred to Taraz. Turgesh khaganate has become stronger at a board of Suluk-khagan. Big danger for Turgeshs proceeded from Arabs who in every possible way tried to decline Suluk on their side, but he successfully struggled against them, for what Arabs have nicknamed him Abu Muzahim (Butting).\n\n16 Ancient Taraz city.\n\n17 In the middle of VIII century interests of Chinese and Arabs for the influence in this region has resulted to Тalas battle in July of 751 year on Talas river near Taraz city (Talas battle) have extraordinary sharply collided.\n\n18 The main role in route of Chinese have played Karluks, unexpectedly put to them impact rear. This battle was of great importance, it has for a long time put an end to attempts of China to interfere with affairs of this region, on the other hand, it has strengthened influence here Arabs. In 756 year Turgesh khaganate was disintegrated.\n\n19 3. State of Kharlukh’s (756-940)\n\nIt was union by the Karluk’s state – Karluk khaganate ( ) with the headquarters in Suyab.

State of Kharakhanyds (942-1210)\n\nThe ancestor of a dynasty was Satuk Bogra khan ( ) who in 942 year has declared itself as a khagan. This state of Turkic tribes occupied territory of Semirechiem and the headquarters in Balasagun city.\n\n24 In due course their possession has extended from Amu -Darya and Syr-Darya up to Kashgar. Then state have broken up to two parts – eastern and western – Maverannakhr-(territory between Amu -Darya and Syr –Darya) with center in Samarkand.
