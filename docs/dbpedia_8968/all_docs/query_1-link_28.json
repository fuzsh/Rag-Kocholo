        "text": "In Central Asian history, the Turkic Khaganate stands out as the first transcontinental empire. It is stretching from Manchuria to the Black Sea. Established by the Ashina clan of the G√∂kt√ºrks, this empire left a lasting impact. Although the G√∂kt√ºrks spoke Old Turkic, the early official texts and coins of the Khaganate were written in Sogdian.\n\nThe Formation of the First Turkic Khaganate\n\nThe origins of the Turkic Khaganate date back to 546 when Bumin Qaghan launched a preemptive strike against the Uyghur and Tiele groups, planning a revolt against their overlords, the Rouran Khaganate. Bumin aimed to marry into the royal family by receiving a Rouran princess as a reward for his service. However, the Rouran khagan sent an emissary to rebuke him, calling him a ‚Äúblacksmith slave.‚Äù This statement indicates a possible form of vassalage within Rouran society. Disappointed, Bumin allied with the Western Wei to counter their common enemy, the Rouran. In 552, Bumin defeated Anagui and his forces north of Huaihuang.\n\nThe Expansion of the Turkic Khaganate\n\nBumin‚Äôs son, Muqan Qaghan, succeeded him as Illig Khagan of the new khanate. Muqan Qaghan demonstrated prowess in both battle and diplomacy, defeating the Hephthalite Empire, Khitan, and Kyrgyz. Meanwhile, Bumin‚Äôs brother Ist√§mi, titled ‚ÄúYabgu of the West,‚Äù collaborated with the Sassanid Empire to destroy the Hephthalites, who were allies of the Rouran. This conflict solidified the Ashina clan‚Äôs control over the Silk Road and brought the G√∂kt√ºrks into Europe. By 576, the G√∂kt√ºrks had crossed the Kerch Strait into Crimea, and within five years, they laid siege to Chersonesus. Their cavalry roamed the Crimean steppes until 590.\n\nThe End of the Turkic Khaganate\n\nThe Turkic Khaganate divided into two factions after the death of its fourth ruler, Taspar Qaghan, around 583. Although Taspar had intended to pass the title of khagan to Muqan‚Äôs son Apa Qaghan, the high council appointed Ishbara Qaghan instead. This disagreement resulted in multiple contenders for the title, which were cleverly played against each other by the Sui and Tang dynasties. The most significant contender, Tardu, the western leader and son of Ist√§mi, had already declared independence from the Qaghan after his father‚Äôs death. Tardu seized the title and marched east to claim the imperial power in Otukan.\n\nTo solidify his position, Ishbara of the Eastern Khaganate sought protection from Emperor Yang of Sui. In retaliation, Tardu attacked Chang‚Äôan, the Sui capital, around 600, demanding an end to Emperor Yangdi‚Äôs interference in the civil war. The Sui diplomacy incited a revolt among Tardu‚Äôs Tiele vassals, ultimately leading to the end of his reign in 603. The dissident tribes included the Uyghurs and Xueyantuo.\n\nAfter Tardu‚Äôs death, the Eastern Turkic Khaganate weakened, while the Western Turkic Khaganate grew in power. The Western Khaganate, ruled by the Ashina clan and based in the Ili River valley, eventually gained control over the entire territory of the former Eastern Khaganate by the 7th century‚Äôs end.\n\nThe Uyghur Khaganate\n\nIn the 8th century, the Uyghur Khaganate rose to power and established itself as a major power in Central Asia. The Uyghur Khaganate was founded by the Uyghur people, who were originally part of the Western Turkic Khaganate. The Uyghurs were able to unite many of the Turkic tribes under their rule and established their capital in the city of Ordu-Baliq.\n\nDuring the reign of the Uyghur Khaganate, the Turks were converted to Manichaeism, a religion that combined elements of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity. Manichaeism was introduced to the Turks by the Sogdians, a people who had been trading with the Turks for centuries.\n\nIn the 9th century, the Uyghur Khaganate came under pressure from the Kyrgyz, a Turkic people who lived in the Altai Mountains. The Kyrgyz were able to defeat the Uyghurs and establish their own empire in Central Asia. The Uyghur Khaganate was destroyed and the Turks were forced to flee to the west.\n\nConclusio\n\nThe Turks continued to play an important role in the history of Central Asia and the Middle East for centuries to come. They established many powerful empires, including the Seljuk Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, Turkic languages are spoken by millions of people in many countries, including Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nVideo: The Ashina Case ‚Äì Origin of the Gokturks\n\nYou may also like\n\nYou like this article?"
