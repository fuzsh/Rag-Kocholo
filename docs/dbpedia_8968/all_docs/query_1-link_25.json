        "text": "When you think of a powerful Turkic empire, what comes to mind? The most common answer is the Ottoman Empire, a long-time rival of the Europeans for control of the Middle East, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBut long before the Ottomans, a group of blacksmiths in the Eurasian steppes forged the world’s first and largest Turkic empire. They were the Göktürks (Romanized from Kök Türük meaning celestial or blue Turks).\n\nThe First Turkic Khaganate (a Turkic term for empires of the Steppes) stretched from Siberia in the East to the shores of the Black Sea in the West. It was the largest empire in the world in the 6th century.\n\nThe Göktürks were the first to use the term “Turk” to refer to a specific cultural, linguistic, and political group. They set the stage for the rise of later Turkic powers such as the Uyghurs, Kara-Khitans, Khazars, Ghaznavids, Seljuks, and Ottomans, who ruled different parts of Asia, Europe, and Africa, dominating world politics from the Middle Ages to modern times.\n\nWho were the Göktürks? How did they become an important political player in Eurasia? To learn more, let us start with a legendary tale of their origins.\n\nThe Wolf’s Children\n\nThe Göktürks were the first warriors of the Steppes to write their histories in the Orkhon inscriptions, which were commissioned by Bilge Khagan and his brother Kul Tigin in 732. However, the recording was almost 200 years after they first appeared as a political force.\n\nThree myths in Chinese literature describe the Turks' origins. We will discuss the most popular one: the abandoned child brought up by a wolf.\n\nThe legend tells of a young boy who was brutally attacked by enemies and left for dead in a swamp. The child was rescued and nursed back to health by a she-wolf.\n\nDoesn’t that sound familiar? Romulus and Remus and the birth of Rome, anyone?\n\nBut here’s where the story differs. The boy and the she-wolf seek refuge in a cavern. After a few years, the boy, now a young man, impregnates the wolf. They have ten half-human, half-wolf boys. Several generations later, the first Turks arrive on the scene, descended from the half-human, half-wolf men. They become the blacksmiths of the Rourans.\n\nI will explain who the Rourans were. First, let us analyze the legend. The story reads like a traditional creation myth, but sound evidence suggests the tale was metaphorical. We have proof that the early Turks were blacksmiths, famous for their metalworking skills, living near Central Asia's Altai mountains. They produced high-quality weapons and armor that were sought after by armies across Asia. The cavern where the young boy and the wolf sought refuge could be a metaphor for a mine.\n\nThe legend also tells us the importance of the wolf in Turkic mythology. A myth involving the wolf is a common theme in many cultures originating in the Steppes of Eurasia, such as the Indo-Europeans and the Mongols. According to traditional Turkic beliefs, their ancestors were wolves.\n\nSkilled people always find royal patronage, and the early Turks were no exception. The Rouran Khaganate employed them. Who were the Rourans, and why are they relevant to our story?\n\nThe Rise of the First Turkic Khaganate\n\nThe Rouran, also called Juan-Juan or Avar Khaganate, were the ancestors of the Mongols. They lived in Mongolia and northern China. They were the first Steppe power to use the term Khagan (pronounced Kha’an) to refer to an emperor. Later, Khagan became popular among Turks and Mongols.\n\nIn the fourth century, the Rourans and the Northern Wei dynasty, who ruled much of northern China, locked horns in a legendary conflict. You may be familiar with this clash if you’ve seen the movie Mulan, set in this backdrop.\n\nRourans controlled the lucrative Silk Road trade. They hired the Göktürks to make weapons and armor for their army. But the Turks were also talented warriors.\n\nLegend has it thatBumin, head of the Göktürk Ashina clan, put down a rebellion for the Rouran Khagan. Bumin then asked for the princess's hand in marriage. The Rouran chief laughed at the request and rejected it, claiming that a woman of noble birth would never marry a blacksmith slave. Insulted and humiliated, Bumin led a revolt against the Rourans in 551. He routed the Rourans, captured their capital, and declared himself Khagan at the new capital, Otuken, in present-day Mongolia.\n\nThe Göktürks spread west and east, raiding affluent Silk Road frontier towns in Central Asia and China. Istami, Bumin’s brother, ruled the empire’s western half and took the title of Yabgu, equivalent to a viceroy. The primary seat of power remained in the empire’s eastern half.\n\nBumin died in 552, a year after establishing the Göktürk Khaganate. His son Issik succeeded him. Issik’s reign didn’t last long, as he died within three months of ascending the throne. Bumin’s second son, Muhan, assumed power, ushering in a new era for the Turkic people.\n\nExpansion: War, Diplomacy, and Trade\n\nThe two realms of the Turkic Khaganate, east and west, provided a unique opportunity for Muhan and Istami. Uncle and nephew could go in different directions and target wealthy empires in the Middle East, Central Asia, and northern China without relying on each other for orders. The fluid command structure helped in the rapid expansion of the Göktürks.\n\nMuhan conquered the nomadic kingdom of the Khitans in the east and the Kyrgyz in the south. Muhan’s conquests are poorly documented beyond this point. We better understand Istami’s exploits because his forces came into contact with Persians and Romans (Byzantine), who were better at recording historical events.\n\nInitially, Istami allied with the Sassanid Persians to conquer the Hephthalite Huns, better known as the White Huns. Göktürks held a grudge against the Hephthalites because they shielded the Rouran nobles fleeing the Turkic empire.\n\nThe Hephthalites engaged in a long war with the Persians, subjugating the Sassanids and even executing a Persian emperor. Hence, the Sassanids welcomed an alliance with the Göktürks. A joint Persian and Göktürk army routed the Hephthalites near Bukhara in 560. The Göktürks gained greater control of the lucrative Silk Road trade by absorbing the Hephthalite networks.\n\nDespite the initial alliance with the Persians, things soon turned sour. Persians didn’t allow the Göktürk envoys to sell silk in their domain. The next fifty years saw repeated conflicts between the Persians and the Turks, with victories on both sides but no significant shifts in territorial boundaries. The wars with the Persians didn’t prevent the Turks from gaining wealth through trade and finding new allies.\n\nManiah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Istami to bypass the Persians and sell the silk directly to the Romans, the world's largest buyers of silk. In 568, the Roman Emperor Justin II received a Göktürk delegation at Constantinople. The following year, the Turks warmly welcomed a Roman envoy. The Romans and the Turks formed a military, commercial, and diplomatic alliance. The alliance benefitted the Turks and Romans during their conflicts with the Persians.\n\nSogdian merchants were crucial in helping the Göktürks become a commercial power. Diplomatically adept, the Sogdians also aided the Turks in creating the Old Turkic alphabet, the foundation of the Turkic writing system. Writings in Old Turkic have been found as far west as Balkans and Hungary.\n\nIn the east, after Muhan died in 572, his brother Taghpar took over as Khagan. Once a devout follower of the ancient Turkic religion of Tengrism, Taghpar changed his ways and became a Buddhist. He began an ambitious project to construct monasteries and study centers. Taghpar sponsored the Sogdian and Turkic translations of Buddhist canonical works. During his reign, Sogdian and Brahmi, the ancient script of India, was widely used, and we have the best-preserved evidence in the Bugut Inscription. The inscription was written in Sogdian and a language in Brahmi script. The language was believed to be Sanskrit, but in 2014, linguists concluded it was an early form of Mongolian.\n\nFollowing the death of Taghpar, the Khaganate split into two independent kingdoms. The Eastern Turkic Khaganate saw an opportunity to raid China. China was in anarchy in the early seventh century. According to Chinese sources, the Turks launched 67 attacks from the Sui dynasty to Tang rule during the transition period.\n\nThe Chinese soon found a way to settle scores with the Turks. They pitted one nomadic group against the other, and the once-mighty Turkic Khaganate crumbled.\n\nDecline and Legacy\n\nAfter Taghpar died, his son Apa was supposed to be the Khagan. Nivar, Taghpar’s brother, usurped the throne.\n\nApa asked Tardu, the Yabgu from the west, for help to get rid of Nivar. Nivar routed Apa and Tardu’s combined army. However, Apa would not abandon his dream of ruling an empire. He betrayed Tardu and took over the Western Turkic Khaganate, dividing the first Turkic empire into independently ruled east and west.\n\nThe schism in the Khaganate did not mark the end of Turkic rule over Central Asia, but they were weaker than before. The Turks took advantage of the chaos in China to launch raids inside the country.\n\nIn 626, Illig Khan, the Khagan of the Turks, marched onto the Chinese capital, Chang’an, forcing the Tang ruler to accept a peace treaty. Taizong, who ruled the Tang Dynasty, is one of the most famous rulers in Chinese history, and he wouldn’t forget the humiliation at the hands of the Turks.\n\nThe Chinese had centuries of experience fighting nomadic warriors. The Tangs bribed one of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate’s vassals to revolt against the Khagan. This rebellion was enough to destabilize the Turkic realm. Chinese records mention the tribe that rebelled against the Turks, the Huihe. Today, we know them as Uyghurs.\n\nTaking advantage of the revolt, the Tangs crushed the Göktürks at the Battle of Yinshan in 630. Illig Khan was captured and taken as a prisoner. China absorbed the eastern half of the Turkic Khaganate. In 657, the Tangs also conquered the Western Turkic Khaganate. The Turks recognized Emperor Taizong as Khagan of Heaven, making him the first Chinese emperor to achieve such a title.\n\nThere was a brief resurgence of the Göktürks, who defeated the Tang and formed the Second Turkic Khaganate in 682. It lasted until 744 when the increasingly assertive Uyghurs again toppled the Göktürks and established the Uyghur Khaganate.\n\nThe Göktürks ruled a vast territory and controlled a profitable trade route for almost 200 years. Their legacy, however, lasted well into the modern era. After the breakup of the Turkic Khaganate, various Turkic tribes emerging from this realm shaped the politics of Europe, Asia, and North Africa until the 20th century.\n\nThe successors of the Turkic Khaganate, the Ghaznavids, Kara-Khitans, Uighurs, Khazars, Seljuks, and Ottomans played an essential role in world politics from the Middle Ages till the modern era.\n\nToday, there are over 200 million speakers of Turkic languages worldwide, and they can trace their origins to a band of blacksmiths living in the foothills of the Altai mountains.\n\nDo you enjoy tales from lost civilizations and cultures from the ancient world and the Middle Ages?\n\nShare this story with your friends and family and subscribe to this newsletter.\n\nIf you wish to support the newsletter, consider opting for a paid membership or buying me a coffee!\n\nReferences"
