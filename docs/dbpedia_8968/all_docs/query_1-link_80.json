        "meta_description": "A large number of ethnicity have inhabited Mongolia since prehistoric times. Most of these people were nomads who, from time to time, formed confederations that rose to prominence. The first of these, the Xiongnu, were brought together to form a confederation by Modun Shanyu in 209 BC.\r\n         In 1206, Chinggis Khan (also known as Genghis Khan) founded the Mongol Empire, the largest empire in history. The Mongol Empire’s territory extended from present-day Poland in the west to the Korean peninsula in the east, from Siberia in the north to the Arab peninsula and Vietnam in the south, covering approximately 33 million square kilometers. In 1227, after Chinggis Khan’s death, the Mongol Empire was subdivided into four kingdoms. In 1260, Chinggis Khan’s grandson, Kublai Khan, ascended the throne of one of the four kingdoms that encompassed present-day Mongolia and China. In 1271, Kublai Khan formally established the Yuan Dynasty. The Yuan Dynasty was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China until it was overthrown by the Yuan Dynasty in 1368.\r\n        The Mongol court returned to its native land, however, centuries of internal conflict, expansion and contraction brought them fall into Manchu Qing dynasty.  They conquered Inner Mongolia in 1636. Outer Mongolia was submitted in 1691. For the next two hundred years Mongolia was ruled by the Qing Dynasty until 1911. Mongolia declared its independence in 1911 under the Bogd Khan, the spiritual leader of Mongolia’s Tibetan Buddhism. However, the Chinese government still considered “Outer Mongolia” as part of it and invaded the country in 1919.\r\n       In 1921, People’s Revolution won in Mongolia with the help of the Russian Red Army and thus Mongolia became the second socialist country in the world. After Bogd Khan’s death in 1924, the Mongolian People’s Republic was proclaimed and the first Constitution was adopted.\r\n       Mongolia was under a Soviet-dominated Communist regime for almost 70 years, from 1921 to 1990.  In the fall of 1989 and the spring of 1990, new currents of political thought began to emerge in Mongolia, inspired by the glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. In March 1990, a democratic revolution that started with hunger strikes to overthrow the Government led to the peaceful renouncement of communism. Mongolia’s renouncement of communism led to a multi-party system, a new constitution and a transition to a market economy.\r\n       Over the past two decades, Mongolia has transformed itself from a socialist country with a planned economy into a vibrant multi-party democracy with one of the world’s fastest growing economies.",

        "text": "Mongolia is the country of great history. The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Rouran, the Xianbei, the Gökturks, and others.\n\nMongolia has been inhabited for over 800,000 years. Important prehistoric sites are the stone memorials (deer stone, men stone, square burial, petro glyph and burial mound) that were included in to those empires.\n\nAmong the few surviving record is the 13th-century Secret History of the Mongols. Their character and habits at the time are only slightly known to us, because, like other nomads, they lift little in writing. There is some archaeological evidence of early tribal history, but on the whole Mongolian history cannot be compared to English or European histories.\n\n1162 Birth of Temuujin, the future Chinggis khaan\n\n1189 Proclaimed Chinggis khaan after rallying the Mongol tribes\n\n1206 Proclaimed Great khaan of all Mongolia\n\n1227 Death of Chinggis khaan, after defeating Tangut tribe\n\n1229 Ugudei khaan (3rd son of Chinngis khan) proclaimed second Great khaan\n\n1235 Ugudei khaan built Mongol capital Karakorum\n\n1246 Guyug khaan (Ugudei’s son) proclsimed the third Great khaan\n\n1251 Munkh khaan (grandson of Chinggis khaan) proclaimed fourth Great khaan\n\n1260 Hubilai khaan (Munkh’s brother) proclaimed fifth Great khaan\n\nThe Bogd Khaanate of Mongolia was the Government of Mongolia (Outer Mongolia) after collapsing the Qing dynasty between 1911 and 1919 and again from 1921 to 1924 and it was leaded by the Bogd Khaan and highest authority of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia. The Mongols and Tibetans believed that the Manchus ruled Mongolia and Tibet not as Chinese provinces, but under separate treaties. When the Manchu throne fell, Mongolia, Tibet and China were automatically separated.\n\nIn 1921 Mongolian forces led by the Mongolian People’s Party and part of the 5th Soviet Red Army marched into the town of Niislel Huree (Urga) and declared an independent Mongolian state. The Bogd Khaan was made head state as a limited monarch but real power was in the hand of the party.\n\nThe 1990s may be called the decade of change in Mongolia. Mongolia set up legal and constitutional institutions become a democracy in a peaceful process which brought Mongols into contact with the modern world. For most of the 20th century, under the domination of Soviet Russia, Mongolia was virtually closed to Westerners. Mongolian Democracy was the turning point in its time when the country sought economic independence, political and economic reforms and an independent foreign policy. Two years later a new democratic constitution was adopted."
