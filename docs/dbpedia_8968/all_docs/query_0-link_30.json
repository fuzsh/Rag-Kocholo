        "text": "Crisis of the Seventh CenturyOther names Fall of the Western Turkic KhaganateParticipants Western Turkic Khaganate, Eastern Turkic Khaganate, Sassanid Dynasty of Persia, Tang Dynasty of ChinaLocation Transoxiana, around Merv, modern-day TurkmenistanDate 616-658 ADResult Division of the Western Turkic Khaganate between Persia and China\n\nCrisis of the Seventh Century refers to a time period in Central Asia, near the Transoxiana region, from around 616-658 AD. It ultimately led to the collapse of the Western Turkic Khaganate, and its partition between the Tang Dynasty of China and the Second Turkic Khaganate. Although these events are recorded in great detail by contemporary historians of Europe and Asia, it is not clear to modern scholars how or why the crisis originally took place.\n\nHistoricity[]\n\nMost of the original contemporary sources come from Byzantine authors. Simocatta's letters are some of the earliest references, as he frequently encountered embassies in Constantinople from the events that unfolded with the Khaganate itself. The Easter Chronicle was primarily based on eye-witness testimony, including samples of Simocatta's letters, and expands the narrative considerably. Thomas the Presbyter experienced many accounts of the Khaganate while he was living in Syria, as documented in his own Chronicle of 724 AD. Finally, the Nestorian Khuzistan Chronicle gives a more eye-witness perspective of Christians who were actively involved in Transoxiana at the time.\n\nSome non-western sources can give much longer narratives, but are much fewer in number than the Byzantine counterparts. The most detailed account of the event is found in the Old Book of Tang, a massive compiled chronicle of the Tang Dynasty of China. Zizhi Tongjian, compiled much later, gives a very different perspective of the collapse, but pretty much lines up exactly with the other sources. The only complete narrative from Persian accounts is the chronicle of Al-Tabari, the 10th century Muslim author. Two obscure Hadiths of early Muslim literature also make reference to refugees fleeing into Persia during this time.\n\nThese variety of source material are all largely independent (with notable exceptions), some emanating from completely different background and nationality. And as a result, literary analysis shows that no two works share the exact same source, or copied from one another. However, the exact order and methodology of the events are nearly identical every time, and corroborate perfectly with each and every author. This is significant, because it shows that the horror and carnage surrounding the beginning of the crisis era is not a matter of mythology or anecdote, but actually took place in the order of every grotesque detail.\n\nBackground[]\n\nThe Göktürk Khaganate, also known as the Turkic Khaganate or the Göktürk Empire, was founded in 552 AD. At its height, the empire extended from the Transioxiana region all the way through the Mongol plains, and enjoyed contact with both the remnant Roman Empire and the Northern Dynasty of China. The brief Göktürk Civil war in 581 AD split the empire east and west, with the Western Turkic Khaganate under the rule of Niri Qaghan, also known as Tardush. As early as 588 AD, the Göktürks along with the Hephlathite Empire made war against the Sassanid Dynasty of Persia, in an attempt to annex the city of Herat. Tardush died in 604 AD, and was succeeded over the Western Empire by his son Heshana.\n\nAfter being defeated again in the Second Persian War in 609 AD, Heshana reached out with an offer of alliance to the Byzantine Empire, or alternatively offered to create a marriage alliance with a princess of the Sui Dynasty. Emperor Heraclius was particularly interested in using every opportunity to outmatch the Sassanid Empire. The Göktürks followed the Tengri religion, a relatively peaceful version of Turk-Mongolic paganism that was prominent in East Asia at that time. Their primary capital was located in Suyab in modern-day Kyrgyzstan, although the vast majority of their agriculture and economic supply came from the Transioxiana region in modern-day Turkmenistan.\n\nEvents of 616 AD[]\n\nFrom what can be told from all contemporary accounts, the first catastrophe for the Western Turks occurred suddenly without any warning in a single day. It is also known for certain that this catastrophe affected several cities at once, all concentrated within a radius of 100 km. Sources disagree, however, on some of the order of events, especially when it comes to what event came first.\n\nAround the sixth hour (12:00 PM), almost everyone in the city became seized simultaneously with a kind of insanity described as being \"possessed\". Many people walked or jumped off of rooftops to their deaths. Many people slit their throats in suicide, or took measures for self strangulation. However, the majority of people's actions were centered around creating fire, and in large quantities. People set houses on fire, streets on fire, and trees on fire. Personal possessions were no longer sacred, as hand mirrors, tools, and even weapons were all set on fire as paraded around like torches. Livestock, horses and even household pets were set on fire while still alive, and ran off into the fields in flames. Other strange visions were reported on top of this, including hordes of insects (namely moths, crickets and fireflies), a black cloud covering the sky, and people rendered permanently blind.\n\nThe initial madness seems to have ended by the eighth hour (3:00 PM). However, by this point the cities of Transoxiana have been reduced to complete anarchy. Peoples' homes were broken into and vandalized, and in some cases whole houses were turned inside out for valuables. The military was called in from the capital to quell the violence, but the death toll had already reached a staggering proportion. The loss of the farmlands around Trasnoxiana crippled the nations economy as well.\n\nAftermath[]\n\nDue partially to concurrent conflicts with the East Turkic Khaganate, Heshana was deposed the very next year by Sheguy in 617 AD, who seized control of the Khaganate. However, for much of Sheguy's reign the southern portions of the country fell into more uncontrolled chaos. Many Nestorian Christians and Muslims fled from the region at this time to escape the chaos, appearing in the accounts of refugees in Persia and Syria. Sheguy in turn was assassinated by his brother Tong Yabghue in 618 AD.\n\nAfter several years of attempted recovery and stabalization, Yabghue heeded the call of their Byzantine allies, and attacked Persia in the Third Turkic-Sassanid War in 627 AD. They were ultimately crushed and defeated by the Persians, however, allowing the Sassanids to annex the Transoxiana region from its already-weakened state, sacking the city of Suyab in 629 AD. After the Khagan Bolun Cabgu was deposed in 631 AD, the next decade saw the West Turkic rulers changing in rapid succession as the internal government was in a constant state of implosion. Finally, the remnants of the West Turkic Khaganate was completely annexed by the Tang Dynasty in their campaign in 657 AD."
