        "text": "It is not well known, but Chui valley was one of the most urbanized regions of North Kyrgyzstan in the middle ages. According to the Arab-Persian sources, there is a statement about settlements and towns of the Chuy valley as well as routes that linked them. Although, the information on the subject is limited, accurate data is provided about three medieval cities in the eastern part of the valley and they are called Suyab, Nevaket, and Balasagun. All the sites are easily visited from Bishkek but they are not well excavated or established except for Burana tower where you can find a lot of information and also a small museum. The other sites are free to be roamed by anyone and one can easily imagine how large cities they have been at their time from the vast size of walls and the remains of buildings and forts still visible.\n\nAccording to a statement presented to UNESCO, the Upper Chui Valley Silk Road Sites, the ancient cities of Navekat, Suyab, and Balasagyn are located along the major branch of the Silk Road, which was operating in the early and late Middle Ages (6th century AD – beginning of 8th century AD) and served the sub-regions of Semirechie, Issyk Kul, and Southern Kazakhstan.\n\nSuyab and Nevaket were, at different times, political centers of the western Turkic and Turkish Kaganates, while Balasagun was a major town of the Karakhanide state and entire Central Asia. Navekat (today Krasnaya Rechka) was one of the main towns of the Chuy valley together with Suyab (Ak Beshim) and Balasagyn (Burana). Later, medieval sites in the Chui valley expanded significantly and became unique centers of interdependence between Indian, Chinese, Sogdian and Turkic cultures. They were also a connective link between these civilizations thanks to their positions on the Northern Silk Road. People from India, Sogd, Syria, Persia, China, and the Northern Steppes settled in the nearby towns, each bringing their own religious and cultural traditions with them.\n\nBalasagun (or Balasagyn) was one of the vast medieval cities in Chui valley. Now the site is more commonly known as Burana and is mostly known by its old minaret tower. Balasagun was founded in the 10th century AD at the site of an older settlement. Along with Kashgar, Balasagun was one of the capitals of the Eastern Khanate after the Karakhanid state divided. Balasagun was an important stop on the Silk Roads and a place of intercultural exchange there lived followers of Islam, Syra-Nestorianism, and Buddism.\n\nBalasagyn old town is situated about 12 kilometers southeast of Tokmok near the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border. It was an ancient city founded by Sogdians, a people of Iranian origin in the early centuries A.D and remained in their hands until the 11th century. As it was conveniently located between Chuy Valley, Pishpek (Bishkek) and Issyk-Kul Lake, it was the capital of the Kara-Khanid Khanate from the 10th century until it was captured by the Kara-Khitan Khanate in 1134. Balasagun was then seized and mostly destroyed by the Mongols in 1218. It was called Gobalik (a pretty city) in the 13th century and finally lost its importance and disappeared by the 15th century AD."
