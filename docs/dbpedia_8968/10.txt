The Turkic tribes inhabited the western part of Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Many cities, such as Taraz, Suyab, Otrar, Shash were located along the Silk Road. Those times the Kazakh land belonged to the Great Empire of Eurasia to the Turkic El (Bumyn, Estemi and other khagans), the Western Turkic part, which was in the possession of Turgesh, Oghuz, Karluk, Kipchak tribes. Special region for these tribes was Semirechye (Zhetysu).

The city of Suyab was the capital of the Western Turkic Khaganate. Also, the cities of Kungut, Taraz, Merke, Ispijab (Shymkent), Tarban (Otrar), Atlak, Kulan, Kayalyk, Barskhan were developed. Demonstrative achievements of that era are ancient Sogdian money-coins, monuments with the Old Turkic writing "bitik", burial mounds, stone statues, balbals, which were often discovered in modern Kazakhstan (especially the South Kazakhstan region) and on the territory of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan. Especially in the area of Zhetysu, Shash, Ferghana, on the Talas River, the well-known facts about trade relations were dynamically developed. Many findings in the form of money-coins with seals of rulers of the Western Turkic Kaganates were discovered in modern Uzbekistan, in such places as Kanka, Kulaktepe, Aktepe, Khanabad, Kavardan, Kindiktepe.
