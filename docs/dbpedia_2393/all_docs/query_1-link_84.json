        "text": "As an architect, Vasari was perhaps more successful than as a painter. His loggia of the Palazzo degli Uffizi by the Arno opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard, a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is the unique Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the Vasari Corridor, it is one of very few structures that line the river which are open to the river itself and appear to embrace the riverside environment.\n\nIn Florence, Vasari also built the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the Palazzo Pitti on the other side of the river. The enclosed corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the Ponte Vecchio and winds around the exterior of several buildings.\n\nVasari also renovated the fine medieval churches of Santa Maria Novella and Santa Croce, from both of which he removed the original rood screen and loft, and remodelled the retro-choir in the Mannerist taste of his time.\n\nIn 1562 Vasari built the octagonal dome atop the Basilica of Our Lady of Humility in Pistoia, an important example of high Renaissance architecture.[1]\n\nIn Rome, Vasari worked with Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Bartolomeo Ammanati at Pope Julius III's Villa Giulia. Vasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1547, he built himself a fine house in Arezzo (now a museum honouring him), and laboured to decorate its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected to the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of gonfaloniere.\n\nIn 1563, he helped found the Florence Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno, with the Grand Duke and Michelangelo as capi of the institution and 36 artists chosen as members. Vasari died at Florence on 27 June 1574.\n\nThe West Corridor of the Gallery, heads towards the Arno and then, raised up by huge arches, follows the river as far as the Ponte Vecchio, which it crosses by passing on top of the shops. The meat market on the bridge was at this time trasferred elsewhere, so as not to offend the Grand Duke's sensitive nose with unpleasant smells on his walk, and replaced (from 1593) with the goldsmiths who continue to work there today.\n\nThe most important example of Vasari's architecture is the Uffizi (Offices), commissioned by Cosimo I de' Medici to house the functions and records of his government and to impress Tuscans with the vastness of his bureaucracy. By unifying the regions's administration, the building expresses the political unity achieved by Cosimo. Its four stories line three sides of a space that is more like a street than a piazza. The Uffizi derives its effect from the repetition of elements: two Tuscan columns and a pier on the ground story, while on the second story a triplet of mezzanine windows alternates with Michelangelesque consoles. The third story features another triad of windows, and the open loggia of the fourth (now unfortunately glazed) reflects the Tuscan columns of the ground story. The only break in the uniformity comes at the end, where a central arch with a Palladian motif above it opens the vista in the direction of the Arno River.\n\nThe basic outlines of the plan may have been suggested to Vasari by Cosimo I. The building was completed in the 1580s by Bernardo Buontalenti and Alfonso Parigi.\n\nUffizi Gallery\n\nThe Vasari Corridor and Uffizi Gallery, seen from the Arno River\n\nThe Lives\n\nAs the first Italian art historian, he initiated the genre of an encyclopedia of artistic biographies that continues today. Vasari coined the term \"Renaissance\" (rinascita) in print, though an awareness of the ongoing \"rebirth\" in the arts had been in the air from the time of Alberti. Vasari's Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori (Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects) — dedicated to Grand Duke Cosimo I de' Medici — was first published in 1550. It included a valuable treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts. It was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural).\n\nThe work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of Florentines and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art — for example, the invention of engraving. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including Titian) it did so without achieving a neutral point of view.\n\nVasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young Giotto painting a fly on the surface of a painting by Cimabue that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. With a few exceptions, however, Vasari's aesthetic judgement was acute and unbiased. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism — with new materials opened up by research — has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions. The work remains a classic, though it must be supplemented by modern critical research.\n\nVasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of his Lives, and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and Francesco Salviati.\n\nCompetition and \"Competition\"\n\nAccording to the historian Richard Goldthwaite, Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the word \"competition\" (or \"concorrenza\") in Italian in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, but perhaps most notably while explaining the reasons for Florentine preeminence, in the introduction to his life of Pietro Perugino.\n\nIn Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition for commissions each with the others kept them hungry. Competition, he said, is \"one of the nourishments that maintain them.\"\n\nSt Luke Painting the Virgin, fresco in Santissima Annunziata, Florence\n\nGiorgio Vasari, St Luke Painting the Virgin, after 1565, fresco, Santissima Annunziata, Florence\n\nThe sheer scale of his book, the Lives of the Artists reveals just how much Vasari did to dignify his profession and not just himself. He was acutely conscious of the roles the artist could play in a cultured society and he did his best to live as well as to promote the part. He was instrumental in founding the Accademia del Disegno in Florence in the early 1560s and contributed its keynote fresco, St Luke Painting the Virgin, to its chapel with the same dedication at SS Annunziata.\n\nSaint Luke painting the Virgin, (Lukas-Madonna in German or Dutch), is a devotional subject in art showing Saint Luke painting the Virgin Mary with the Baby Jesus. Such paintings were often painted for chapels of Saint Luke in European churches during the Renaissance, and often include the pose of the Salus Populi Romani, based on the legend of Luke's portrait of Mary. Versions of the subject were sometimes painted as the masterpiece, in the original sense, that many guilds required an artist to submit before becoming a master.\n\nThe fresco The Studio of the Painter is part of the paintings decorating the house of Vasari in Florence.\n\nIt is characteristic of Vasari's self-confidence that the artistic and intellectual effort he invested in designing his own home was comparable to that which he expended on the residences of those who commissioned his work. He decorated his house in Arezzo between 1542 and 1548; toward the end of his life he also frescoed his Florentine house, which had been given to him by Duke Cosimo I in 1561. In both cases the paintings refer to the role of the painter, who saw himself in the tradition of ancient painters (to whom individual episodes of both cycles are devoted).\n\nThe Studio of the Painter,\n\nc. 1563, fresco, Casa Vasari, Florence\n\nPalazzo della Carovana on the Piazza dei Cavalieri in Pisa\n\nPisa, Palazzo della Carovana on the Piazza dei Cavalieri\n\nThe Palazzo dei Cavalieri stands on the Piazza dei Cavalieri (Knights' Square) which was for many years the political and social centre of the city. The palace was originally the Palazzo degli Anziani (Palace of the Elders); then in 1562 Giorgio Vasari began the rebuilding and enlargement which produced the magnificent Palazzo dei Cavalieri or Palazzo della Carovana, named after the training courses for knights (cavalieri) of the Order of St Stephen which were held here; the courses were known as carovane (caravans). The imposing façade is decorated with sgraffito ornament, coats of arms and busts of six Grand Dukes of Tuscany (from Cosimo I to Cosimo III). The effect of the building is enhanced by the wide projection of the roof and the handsome double staircase leading up to the entrance.\n\nThe decoration of the façade is also directed by Vasari. It is composed in three layers; the lower part is decorated with 12 constellation of the year, the middle with allegorical figures like Art and Virtue, and the topmost with the bust of the Medici Dukes, and at the centre, the famous emblem of the Medici family.\n\nSince Napoleon founded the Normal School in 1810 and gave the use of the building to the school, it is still occupied by the Scuola Normale\n\nThe words sgraffito and sgraffiti come from the Italian word sgraffiare (”to scratch”), ultimately from the Greek γρ?φειν (gráphein), meaning “to write”.\n\nGraffiti, the bane of all modern cities in the form of spray paint, in its original sense refers to marks scratched onto a surface with a tapered point. The graffito technique has been used since prehistoric times. Decades ago, my father showed me graffito animals, birds and people carved on the tufa cave walls in northern New Mexico. But in Florence, starting in the 1400s, it was a technique of wall design, where the top layer of pigment or colored plaster is scratched through to reveal an underlying layer.\n\nThe historian and artist Giorgio Vasari recorded the graffito technique step by step. First, one paints the wall of a palazzo with a layer of lime plaster, coloured with burnt herbs or other dark pigments. Once the first layer is dry, another is painted on, this time of white plaster, distributed uniformly. On top of this second layer are laid punched-out designs, or stencils, which are reproduced on the wall with powdered charcoal (referred to as tecnica dello spolvero in Italian). A tapered awl is then used to trace the resulting pattern on the wall, cutting through the layer of white plaster to reveal the darker, underlying layer. Thus, by using the same colours as a palazzo’s frescos, the graffito designs could be used to add shadow and depth to the overall decoration.\n\nSalone Dei Cinquecento, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence\n\nWith the growth of his stature and cultural ambitions when he was compiling and writing his book, the Lives of the Artists, the nature of Vasari's commissions fundamentally altered in the final thirty years of his life, from individual works such as altarpieces to grand enterprises in different media requiring a controlling hand over a large body of assistants. To accomplish these great projects he organized a vast workshop on a scale unprecedented in Florence.\n\nMany of his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling paintings in the great Sala di Cosimo I of the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence, where he and his assistants were at work from 1555, and the frescoes he started inside the vast cupola of the Duomo, completed by Federico Zuccari and with the help of Giovanni Balducci.\n\nThe best example of the grand enterprises are the ceiling and walls of the main room, the Sala del Cinquecento, completed 1565. The ceiling is divided into 39 panels depicting episodes from the history of Florence and the Grand-duchy of Tuscany. Along the upper part of the walls are battle scenes by Vasari, below are a series of statues and marble groups.\n\nSalone Dei Cinquecento\n\nThe massive Salone dei Cinquecento (Room of the Five Hundred) once held the Council of the Five Hundred, a governing body created by Savonarola during his short stint in power. The long room is largely decorated with works by Giorgio Vasari, who orchestrated the redesign of the room in the mid-16th century. It contains an ornate, coffered and painted ceiling, which tells the story of the life of Cosimo I de' Medici, and, on the walls, gigantic depictions of battle scenes of Florence's victories over rivals Siena and Pisa.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were initially commissioned to produce works for this room, but those frescoes have been \"lost.\" It is believed that Leonardo's Battle of Anghiari frescos still exist beneath one wall of the room. Michelangelo's Battle of Cascina drawing, which had also been commissioned for this room, was never realized on the walls of the Salone dei Cinquecento, as the master artist was called to Rome to work on the Sistine Chapel before he could begin work in the Palazzo Vecchio. But his statue Genius of Victory located in a niche at the southern end of the room is worth a look.\n\nGiorgio Vasari | Salone Dei Cinquecento, ceiling decoration\n\nGiorgio Vasari, Salone Dei Cinquecento, ceiling decoration, completed 1565, oil on canvas, Palazzo Vecchio, Florence\n\nVasari had a well disciplined army of assistants, and with their aid he was able to cover numerous Florentine and Roman walls and ceilings with frescoes and oil paintings. While these are often unreal and pompous, they seldom lack decorative effect or historical interest. Enormous altarpieces from his studio line the side aisles of Florentine churches, vast battle scenes and smaller decorative works fill the halls and smaller chambers of the Palazzo Vecchio. In the centre the scene of Cosimo's Return from Exile in 1434 is depicted, while other episodes from the life of Cosimo the Elder are around.\n\nThe decoration of large halls with the deeds of the nobility and their ancestors was intended to inspire the viewer's admiration. The depiction of such events from the recent past has a long tradition. Most such cycles in the first half of the sixteenth century, however, are dedicated to a single person or event. By contrast, from the middle of the century onward this genre was increasingly devoted to the representation of dynasties. The first steps in this direction were taken by a family that did not belonged to the old aristocracy, but knew enough to exploit skillfully the memory of its ancestors for propaganda purposes - namely the Medici in Florence during the years of that city's transition from a republic to a principate. Duke Cosimo I openly exploited the depiction of the history of the older Medici in the Palazzo Vecchio to justify his own position. This decoration occupied Vasari and his workshop from 1556 to 1571, with interruptions, and its final version comprised more than a hundred individual depictions of historical themes.\n\nArt in Tuscany | Palazzo Vecchio in Florence\n\nThe Last Judgment\n\nGiorgio Vasari, The Last Judgment (detail), 1572-79, fresco, Duomo, Florence"
