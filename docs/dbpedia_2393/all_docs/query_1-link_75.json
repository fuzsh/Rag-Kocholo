        "text": "Lambrusco: A Guide to the Top Wineries to Taste the Best\n\nPoet Virgilio mentioned it and it's probably more popular than Ferrari in Modena. It's Lambrusco wine, what else?\n\nLearn how it's made, which to choose and which are the best Lambrusco wineries in Modena, Parma and Reggio Emilia.\n\nWhat is Lambrusco\n\nLambrusco is a red sparkling wine with a colour that varies from a deep purply red to light pink as a rosé.\n\nIts name comes from the Latin word labrŭscum, the fruit of labrusca, the savage grape.\n\nHow popular is it?\n\nWell, consider that it's Italy's most exported wine.\n\nIn 1860 Cleto Chiarli started to bottle the Lambrusco that he produced for his tavern in Modena. Previously it had only been available in bulk.\n\nIn the 70s' it was so popular that Enzo Ferrari in 1978 convinced a Lambrusco producer to sponsor the Canadian driver Gilles Villeneuve.\n\nHow it's made\n\nLambrusco has high acidity and low alcohol.\n\nAnd because the grape skins are left on during production, it comes in reddish hues from pretty pink to deep red. This means it’s acidic and refreshing (like Prosecco) but with tannic, red wine qualities.\n\nWhere it's produced\n\nLambrusco comprises 7 DOCs, a mosaic of vineyards enclosed in an area between Modena, Reggio Emilia, Parma and Mantua.\n\nThe official varieties of Lambrusco grape are:\n\nLambrusco a foglia frastagliata\n\nLambrusco Barghi\n\nLambrusco Benetti\n\nLambrusco del Pellegrino\n\nLambrusco di Sorbara\n\nLambrusco Grasparossa\n\nLambrusco Maestri\n\nLambrusco Marani\n\nLambrusco Montericco\n\nLambrusco Oliva\n\nLambrusco Salamino\n\nLambrusco Viadanese\n\nLambrusco wineries in Modena\n\nChiarli\n\nA large producer, one of the oldest with its 160 years of history.\n\nIn 1860 Cleto Chiarli began to bottle the Lambrusco that he produced for his tavern in Modena – previously it had only been available in bulk.Its popularity began with the \"Mention Honorable\" of the Paris' Universal Exhibition in 1900.\n\nTry its Lambrusco di Sorbara \"Premium Mention Honorable\" to have a toast to its glorious past.\n\nInfo\n\nVia Daniele Manin, 15, 41100 Modena\n\nTel. +39 059 316 3311\n\nchiarli.it\n\nCantina Paltrinieri\n\nA small producer of pure Sorbara Lambrusco.\n\nTry Radice, refermented in the bottle, but don't miss to taste their Balsamic vinegar of Modena or, why not, a shot of their grappa.\n\nInfo\n\nVia Cristo, 49, 41030 Sorbara MO\n\nTel. +39 059 902047\n\ncantinapaltrinieri.it\n\nOpera02\n\nOpera02 isn't only one of the best hotels in Modena, a great restaurant and a stunning place to relax on the hills.\n\nMattia is the master of 4 Grasparossa lambrusco: Amabile, Secco, Pura and Rosa (pink).
