        "text": "Francesco I (March 24, 1541 – October 19, 1587) was the second Grand Duke of Tuscany, ruling from 1574 until his death in 1587. He was a member of the House of Medici.\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in Florence, Francesco was the son of Cosimo I de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Eleanor of Toledo. She was the second daughter of Pedro Álvarez de Toledo, Viceroy of Naples, and Maria Osorio y Pimentel, 2nd Marquise of Villafranca. Her father was the lieutenant-governor of Emperor Charles V and the uncle of Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba.\n\nOn her paternal side, Eleanor was the third cousin of Emperor Charles V since their great-grandmothers were daughters of Fadrique Enríquez de Mendoza, a great-grandson of King Alfonso XI of Castile.\n\nFrancesco served as regent for his father Cosimo after he retired from his governing duties in 1564.\n\nMarriage to Archduchess Joanna of Austria\n\nOn December 18, 1565, Francesco married Archduchess Joanna of Austria, youngest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I and his wife Anne of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia, the oldest child and only daughter of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary (1456–1516) and his third wife Anne of Foix-Candale. King Louis II of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia was her younger brother.\n\nHer paternal grandparents were King Casimir IV of Poland (of the Jagiellon dynasty) and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, one of the heiresses of the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Duchy of Luxembourg and the Duchy of Kuyavia.\n\nArchduchess Joanna of Austria’s grandmother, Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, was the daughter of King Albrecht II of Germany/the Romans, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund.\n\nBy all reports, it was not a happy marriage. Joanna was homesick for her native Austria, and Francesco was neither charming nor faithful. In 1578, Joanna died at the age of thirty-one, after falling down a flight of stairs while pregnant with their eighth child.\n\nBianca Cappello\n\nSoon after Grand Duchess Joanna had died, Francesco went on to marry his Venetian mistress, Bianca Cappello, after aptly disposing of her husband, a Florentine bureaucrat. Because of the quick remarriage and similar occurrences among the Medici (Francesco’s younger brother Pietro had reportedly killed his wife), rumours spread that Francesco and Bianca had conspired to poison Joanna.\n\nFrancesco reportedly built and decorated the Villa di Pratolino for Bianca. She was, however, not always popular among Florentines. They had no legitimate children, but Bianca had borne him a son, Antonio (1576 – 1621), in his first wife’s lifetime. Following the death of Francesco’s legitimate son Filippo in 1582, Antonio was proclaimed heir. Francesco also adopted Bianca’s daughter by her first marriage, Pellegrina (1564–?).\n\nThe “Apennine Colossus” in its niche\n\nLike his father, Francesco was often despotic, but while Cosimo had known how to maintain Florentine independence, Francesco acted more like a vassal of the Habsburgs of Austria and Spain. He continued the heavy taxation of his subjects to pay large sums to the empire.\n\nFrancesco had an avid interest in manufacturing and sciences. He founded porcelain and stoneware manufacture, but these did not thrive until after his death. He continued his father’s patronage of the arts, supporting artists and building the Medici Theater as well as founding the Accademia della Crusca.\n\nFrancesco was also passionately interested in chemistry and alchemy and spent many hours in his private laboratory and curio collection, the Studiolo in the Palazzo Vecchio, which held his collections of natural items and stones and allowed him to dabble in chemistry and alchemical schemes.\n\nFrancesco and Bianca died on October 19 and 20 respectively, both at the Medici Villa in Poggio a Caiano. Although the original death certificates mention malaria, it has been widely speculated that the couple was poisoned, possibly by Francesco’s brother Ferdinando.\n\nWhile some early forensic research supported the latter theory, forensic evidence from a study in 2010 found the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria, in the skeletal remains of Francesco I, which strongly bolstered the infection theory and the credibility of the official documents. Francesco was succeeded by his younger brother Ferdinando.\n\nIn 1857, all members of the Medici family were exhumed and reburied in the place where they still lie today, the Basilica of St. Lawrence in Florence. The painter Giuseppe Moricci attended the ceremony and depicted Francesco with a facial droop, a right claw hand appearance, the right shoulder internally rotated, the right calf muscle wasted and a right clubfoot confirmed by orthopaedic footwear within the coffin.\n\nThese are the signs of a right-sided stroke possibly within the internal capsule. The presence of the orthopaedic footwear suggests that this stroke happened significantly before his death. During life, in his official portraits, the grand duke was always depicted as being in perfect physical condition. The cause of his stroke is not known, but malaria is known to cause this condition.\n\nThere is a famous portrait of Francesco as a child by Bronzino that hangs in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Francesco’s marriage to Bianca and the couple’s death was exploited by Thomas Middleton for his tragedy Women Beware Women, published in 1658.\n\nChildren\n\nFrancesco and Joanna had eight children:"
