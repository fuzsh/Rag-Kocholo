Since the 1990 World Cup, \"Nessun Dorma\" has become inextricably linked to both Pavarotti and football.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti is dedicated to the development of the careers of young singers and initiated an international vocal competition in Philadelphia, a competition which has helped launch the careers of many singers. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his career, Pavarotti invited winners to Italy for gala performances of La Bohème, resulting in an historic visit to China for performances of the opera with young singers in Beijing. To conclude the visit, Pavarotti gave the first concert ever held in the Great Hall of the People.\n\nPavarotti created his now world-famous annual charity concert, Pavarotti & Friends, which celebrated its tenth concert in 2003. Bringing together artists from diverse musical worlds, the great tenor has been joined by some of the best-known names in rock, pop and jazz, including Bryan Adams, Anastacia, Jon Bon Jovi, Boyzone, James Brown, George Benson, Bono and the Edge of U2, Mariah Carey, Tracey Chapman, The Chieftains, Eric Clapton, Joe Cocker, Natalie Cole, The Corrs, Sheryl Crow, Lucio Dalla, Celine Dion, Brian Eno, Gloria Estefan, the Eurythmics, Bob Geldof, Enrique Iglesias, Elton John, Grace Jones, Tom Jones, BB King, Ricky Martin, John MacLauchlin, Meat Loaf, George Michael, Liza Minnelli, Eros Ramazzotti, Lionel Richie, Spice Girls, Sting, Barry White, Stevie Wonder and Zucchero. These charity concerts have raised millions of dollars for major medical, vocational and educational initiatives in Bosnia, Cambodia, Kosovo, Guatemala, Liberia, Tibet and for Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan, Angolan in Zambia and Iraqi.\n\nLuciano Pavarotti has been awarded an enormous number of international accolades, including the Commendatore Cross and Grand Official Cross for services to the Italian Republic, numerous Emmy, Gramophone and Grammy Awards (including the 1998 Grammy \"Legend Award\"), Officer of the Légion d'Honneur, Musicares Person of the Year, Honorary degrees from the Philadelphia College of Performing Arts and the Universities of Pittsburgh, Oklahoma City, Parma, Urbino and San Martin Lima, Peru, the Ville de Paris Prize (awarded by Jacques Chirac), People's Choice Award, Kammersänger (presented by the Austrian Minister of Culture).

Four years ago, Pavarotti was appointed a United Nations Messenger for Peace by Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan and, in 2001, the UNHCR (United Nations High Commission for Refugees) presented the tenor with the coveted Nansen Award in recognition of helping to raise more funds for the UN refugee agency than any other private individual.
