        "text": "Bologna\n\nCapital of the Emilia-Romagna region, Bologna is situated 54 m. above sea level, in a pleasant position at the foot of the outlying Apennine ramifications, at the mouth of the plain of the Reno and Savena valleys.\n\nFounded in the 6th century BC. by the Etruscans, with the name Felsina, on a previous Italic settlement, two centuries later it became a settlement of the Boii Gauls; subsequently (191 BC.), already known by the name of Bononia, it became fully romanized. After the fall of the Empire, it was under Byzantine, Lombard and Frankish rule until it became a free municipality (11th century).The foundation of the famous university one of the oldest in the world, transformed the city into the cultural capital of Europe: at the same time, Bologna assumed the precise urban and architectural character still evident today, expanding within successive sets of city walls. In 1513, after being the object of struggles, between the various Signorie and the Papacy, it became part of the Papal State to which it remained loyal, except during the Napoleonic period, until 1859 when, following the Second War of Independence and the Plebiscites, it became a part of the Kingdom of Italy. The history of the University of Bologna, the Alma Mater Studiorum, weaves in and out of the richly textured tapestry of Bologna's history, a significant thread since the early 11th century. Via Zamboni, the present center of the venerable institution, where I had begun my search, has been part of the university's history since about 1803, when Napoleon designated those palazzi the university's home. At the same time he changed it from a church governed organization to the state one it remains today.\n\nThe city is rich in monuments and works of art, notably: Piazza Maggiore, the heart of Bologna, San Petronio (Gothic, 14th-17th century), the Palazzo dei Notai (14th century), the Palazzo Comunale (13th-16th century), the Palazzo del Podest?

During the High Middle Ages it was under the lordship of a number of powerful Earls, of whom little though is known. As time passed, it was able to set itself up as a self-governing municipality or âComuneâ, strenuously defending its hard-won independence by joining the League of Italian Cities, which had formed an alliance against the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.\n\nIts main source of wealth was trade along the Po River, which at the time flowed south of the town. Like many other Italian cities, it was soon a prey of internal sectarian strife between the pro-Emperor party, the so-called Ghibellines, headed by the Torelli-Salinguerra family, and the pro-Pope party, initially led by the Adelardi-Marchesella family and later by the Este family. After a struggle lasting well over a century, this latter family prevailed and established a lordship over the city that was to be one of the longest in Italy. Marquis followed marquis and then duke followed duke. In this long line of successors to the throne, there were many different characters, but all were great lovers of the arts and sciences. The court was the hub of an intense cultural life, indeed one of the most intense in Europe. Its renown attracted artists from all over.

It is the capital of the province of Piacenza. Modern forms of the name descend from Latin Placentia.\n\nThe etymology is long-standing, tracing an origin from the Latin verb, placÄre, \"to please.\" It is thus a \"pleasant abode\" or as James Boswell reported some of the etymologists of his time to have translated, \"comely.\"This was a name \"of good omen.\"\n\nStrategically the city is at a major crossroads at the intersection of Route E35/A1 between Bologna, gateway to eastern Italy, and Milano, gateway to the Alps, and Route E70/A21 between Brescia at the foot of the Alps and Tortona, where branches lead to Torino in the north, a major industrial city, and Genova, a major coastal port. Piacenza is also at the confluence of the Trebbia, draining the northern Apennines, and the Po, the major waterway of northern Italy, draining to the east. Piacenza right from its foundation has been of vital interest to political powers who would control northern Italy, more than any other city there.
