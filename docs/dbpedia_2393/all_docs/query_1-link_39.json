        "text": "One of the many joys of life in Italy is the abundance of good local products. That includes everything from fruits and vegetables, olive oil, leather goods, ceramics, fabrics, and art. And, of course, wine. When it comes to wines there are plenty of great local wines to choose from.\n\nWhen I say local, I mean really local. Not just Italian, or even from the nearby Chianti region. Not even the famous wines of Montalcino and Montepulciano, but wines directly from the hills above Lucca. In fact, when I first moved to Lucca I went in search of one of my favorite Italian summer wines – a crisp white Gavi. It was nowhere to be found. And although I find it easily in the US, none of the Lucchese wine shops carried it. When I asked why, the proprietor of the shop simply gave me a funny look and said that Gavi came from the area around Torino. It wasn’t local, or famous, so he didn’t carry it. OK then. My search to identify my favorite local wines was on.\n\nI quickly learned that I could always count on a wine from Montecarlo, a hill town about 30 minutes outside of Lucca. Both the Montecarlo reds and whites were good and worked well with a variety of dishes. All the local wine stores and restaurants were well supplied with reasonably priced Montecarlo wines. But really getting to know the local wines takes more than just an occasional glass with dinner out or a random bottle from a local shop. The best way to get to know the local wines is to go straight to the winery for a tasting.\n\nSince I don’t have a car in Lucca, it can be difficult for me to get to even the close-by vineyards as many are not reachable by train or bus. That’s why I jumped at the chance to join an excursion to one of Montecarlo’s top wine producers, Tenuta del Buonamico. The trip was organized by The Tuscan Wanderer – a local tour company run by Giovanni, with a big assist from his American wife Loreal. They organize several tours to the vineyards near Lucca (and beyond) as well as non-wine themed excursions. Giovanni provided transportation for our small group to Montecarlo and arranged for us to tour the Buonamico cellars followed by a wine tasting. They also reserved a table for us at the winery’s elegant Restaurant Syrah, where we enjoyed a special meal with – yes - more wine. These small group excursions are a great way to get to some of the more out-of-the-way wine producers in the area and Giovanni always makes it fun.\n\nNot all of the wine goes into the oak barrels. Instead some, about 140,000 bottles worth, is used to make spumante (sparkling) wines. There is a separate area where the “bubbles” are fermented, using the Charmat method. As our tour guide explained, this method involves secondary fermentation in a steel tank, whereas in the traditional champagne method the secondary fermentation occurs in the bottle. The Charmat method is also used in making Prosecco. But don’t call these sparkling whites Prosecco! That name is reserved for wines produced in a different and specially designated area. At Tenuta del Buonamico they make two varieties of Spumante - both a sparkling white and a sparkling rosé.\n\nOne of the most enchanting parts of the winery tour took us into the cellar named “L’Inferno”. This room is the oldest cellar on the property and houses both new bottles of wine and the very oldest wines produced here, going back a half-century or so. There is just something magical about old, dusty wine bottles with their faded labels and old script. They may no longer be good to drink, but they sure convey a taste of history.\n\nOne of the good things about having friends visit me in Lucca is the chance to recommend activities that I think will enhance their experience, things that may not be found in the guidebooks. Sometimes my suggestions include a visit to a “secret” garden, a hidden away little church, a walk beneath Lucca’s walls, or a local festival.\n\nAnother activity I like to recommend - and one of the most fun things to do when visiting Italy - is a cooking class with a local chef. Recently I had the pleasure of spending the day, along with some visiting friends, with Chef Giuseppe Mazzocchi at Extra Virgin Cooking Classes (EVCC) in Lucca. And what a day it was!\n\nTuscan cooking, and Tuscan olive oil, come naturally to Chef Giuseppe. I guess that is what happens when you are born and raised at your grandfather’s olive mill in a small Tuscan village! Giuseppe began to cook alongside his family and many of the recipes he shares come straight from his nonna (grandmother). More than being a talented chef and teacher, Giuseppe has a love for local culinary traditions and flavors that make his classes a wonderful window into Tuscan life.\n\nSome words just don’t translate well. Such is the case with the Italian word acetaio. Google translate will say that it means “vinegar maker”. But that does not begin to describe the people who produce traditional balsamic vinegar. An acetaio is so much more – an artisan, the keeper of an ancient tradition, and a gustatory magician. They are, justifiably, also a proud group of craftsmen. And they are perhaps the most patient people on earth, for the process of producing a traditional balsamic vinegar takes a minimum of 12 years and often much longer. The prized extravecchio (extra old) balsamics are aged 25 or more years. The acetaio often begins to ferment a batch of balsamico that won’t mature in his (or her) lifetime.\n\nWe are not talking your supermarket balsamic vinegar (a poor imitation of the real thing) but rather authentic Aceto Balsamico. As a Denominazione di Origine Protetta (DOP) product it may only be produced in the small geographically designated area of Modena and Reggio Emilia in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy. Once rival cities in the making of traditional balsamic vinegar, today both towns are entitled to use the DOP designation. Having the DOP label also means that there are tight controls to ensure that the balsamico produced is of the highest quality. The controls extend to bottle size, labeling, and even to the classic red wax seal.\n\nOn my recent food tour in and around Parma (arranged by Get Your Guide), I had the opportunity to visit the Villa Medici Ermete near the town of Reggio Emilia. The villa and surrounding vineyards are owned by the Medici family whose main business is tending the vineyards and making Lambrusco wine.\n\nAlongside wine making, they have also produced small batches of traditional aceto balsamico for the last 100 years. Long ago, the vinegars produced were reserved for family use or given as gifts and wedding dowries. Today they are bottled and offered for sale. Alessandra Medici, who oversees the process, describes the making of her aceto balsamico as both a hobby and a passion. In addition to managing the production, Alessandra gives wonderful tours during which she describes the traditional processes used to make and age the vinegar and invites guests into the attic to see (and breath in the scent) where the aging takes place. As a bonus, the tour concludes with a tasting.\n\nThe vineyard estate, with its central Villa Medici Ermete, is beautiful. The tour begins in a small museum in the open-air barn where old farm tools and wine-making equipment tell of the long history of wine and vinegar production on the estate.\n\nAs our guide explained, the process is fascinating yet quite simple. There is only one ingredient used – the must of grapes grown on the estate. The first step is to cook the grape must in a cauldron over an open flame for a full day to begin the process of evaporation. The liquid is then placed in the largest of a series of ever-smaller barrels. A set of barrels is called a battery and at the Villa Medici Ermete each battery consists of 5 barrels. In a long-standing tradition, a new battery is started and labeled with the name of each new baby born into the family. It matures as the child does, aging long past the minimum 12 years and passing on an important heritage. In the acetaia there was one battery which was started nearly 100 years ago, labeled with the name of an ancestor from several generations past.\n\nFermentation occurs in warm weather (a little bit of older fermented balsamico may be added to begin the process) and then in the winter of each year the liquid is moved to the next smaller barrel. The barrels are made of several different types of wood including oak, cherry, and chestnut. Each will contribute to the flavor of the vinegar. The barrels are left open to air, the vent at the top covered by a thin piece of linen, to allow for evaporation. Eventually the concentrated liquid moves from the last barrel in the battery to some even smaller barrels to finish aging. One room in the acetaia was lined with these small barrels.\n\nLastly we tasted the oldest, 25 year balsamic (gold label). This is the highest quality and most prized balsamic vinegar. It is not used in cooking, but is wonderful on strong cheese and also on desserts. The syrupy sweetness compliments strawberries and is wonderful drizzled on some gelato. It may even act as a sort of digestive taken by a spoonful at the end of a meal (in years past is was taken this way to ward off the plague!). The flavor of this long-aged balsamic is a true luxury.\n\nAs with most things, quality and price go hand in hand. The long process of aging, the use of traditional methods, and the relatively small production mean that authentic balsamic vinegars can be quite expensive. The intense flavors, and the way a small amount can turn a dish from ordinary to extraordinary, make it a worthwhile investment. A bottle of the 18 year, silver balsamic now adds wonderful flavor to my kitchen in Lucca. Having seen how it is produced at Villa Medici Ermete family just makes it all the more delicious.\n\nNext week: Part three of the series, Prosciutto di Parma\n\nThe production of local specialty foods goes from field to table in this region of Italy. Wheat, corn, vegetables, fruit and grapes are important crops (yes, I know grapes are fruit but really, they deserve a category of their own, don’t you think?). And then there are the pigs! This region is home to some of the world’s finest, make that tastiest, pigs.\n\nThese products give rise to many of the dishes that define Italian cuisine – filled pastas, tasty sauces, wonderful cured meats, local wines like Lambrusco and Pignoletto, world-famous cheese and exquisite balsamic vinegar. Food is practically religion in this part of Italy and Bologna, Modena and Parma comprise the geographic holy trinity. Consider me una pellegrina (a pilgrim). With culinary pilgrimage in mind, I recently ventured to Parma to learn about some of the regions famous products – Parmigiano Reggiano (parmesan), Proscuitto di Parma (#1 lesson, don’t call this ham!) and Aceto Balsamico (the real deal balsamic vinegar for which there simply is no substitute).\n\nNext up, a food tour arranged by Get Your Guide. This was supposed to be a group tour, but ended up just being myself and my traveling companion (the benefit of off-season travel). Our driver collected us near our hotel and off we went. First stop, the Caseificio Ugolotti, a family run dairy that has been producing parmigiano cheese using traditional methods since 1930. There we observed (and smelled) all the steps in the production of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. The process begins by combining skim milk collected from local, carefully fed cows the previous evening with the morning’s collection of whole milk. 1000 liters of milk is needed to produce just two wheels of cheese!\n\nRennet is added to begin the process of curd formation. This takes place in deep copper-lined vats. As granules begin to form, the expert cheese maker, clad in heavy boots and a rubber apron, breaks the granules up with a long whisk-like tool called a spino. We watched as the cheese masters moved from one vat to the next, wielding their spini in a slow motion ritual which has barely changed over the years.\n\nNext, the milk is heated (temperature is key) and the granules slowly sink to the bottom of the vat, forming a mass. It surprised me to see the cheesemakers repeatedly dipping their fingers into the vats, but the guide explained that their trained hands could tell by feel when the granules were heated just enough and starting to form a loose mass which looks a lot like cottage cheese.\n\nAfter aging, the cheese is inspected by an official inspector who uses a hammer to tap the wheels of cheese. Based on the sound, the inspector grades the cheese and certifies the quality. If a wheel of cheese fails inspection it cannot be sold for human consumption. The mark within the oval shows that the wheel has been approved by the inspector.\n\nI have often wondered about the high price for a really good wedge of Parmigiano Reggiano. Seeing this labor intensive process gave me a new appreciation for the cost. It now seems like a bargain to me!\n\nAt the end of the tour we entered the tasting room. There, we sampled cheeses of different ages (12, 18, and 24 months). Each had a different texture, color and flavor, developed during aging. The chunks of cheese were served with a bit of balsamic vinegar, some bread, and a glass of white wine."
