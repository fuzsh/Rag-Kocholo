There are also concerns that health care workers do not have sufficient personal protective equipment, such as masks, due to shortages.\n\nItaly's Cremona Hospital Intensive Care where the most serious patients infected with coronavirus are being treated. Source: AAP\n\n\"Unfortunately, the sad list of doctors who fell during the COVID-19 epidemic is lengthening,\" the report, published in Italian, said, adding that the list will continue to be updated in memory of the deceased doctors.\n\nOne of the doctors on the list is general practitioner Marcello Natali, 57, who died on the 18 March after sounding the alarm on the lack of medical supplies.\n\nIn an interview with shortly before his death, Mr Natali said he was forced to work without gloves due to supply shortages.\n\nHospitals in Italy have been overrun after the small European nation became the new epicentre of the pandemic, with close to 64,000 cases and 6,077 deaths reported as of Tuesday morning.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNinety-nine per cent of coronavirus deaths in Italy had pre-existing medical conditions, study finds\n\nThe number of deaths in Italy is almost double the 3,153 officially reported in China's Hubei province, where the deadly virus was first identified in December last year.\n\nItalian medics have been forced to make heart-breaking decisions on which coronavirus patients will receive life-saving treatment, as the number of people in need of critical care surpassed the capacity of the health system.\n\nOn Saturday, local time, Italy set the world record for the number of coronavirus deaths in one day with 793 fatalities. On Monday, however, the number of new cases reported dropped from a high of 6,557 on Saturday to 4,789.\n\n\"These are positive numbers but I do not have the courage to firmly state that there is a downward trend,\" ISS' chief Silvio Brusaferro said.\n\nAcross the world, more than 372,000 cases have been confirmed. Of these, 100,885 have recovered and at least 16,380 have died.\n\nCoronavirus symptoms can range from mild illness to pneumonia, according to the Federal Government's website, and can include a fever, coughing, sore throat, fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\nBelow are the names of the Italian health workers who have died during the pandemic\n\nRoberto Stella, Giuseppe Lanati, Giuseppe Borghi, Raffaele Jura, Carlo Zavaritt, Gino Fasoli, Luigi Frusciante, Mario Giovita, Luigi Ablondi, Franco Galli, Ivano Vezzulli, Massimo Borghese, Marcello Natali, Antonio Buttafuoco, Giuseppe Finzi, Francesco Foltrani, Andrea Carli, Bruna Galavotti, Piero Lucarelli, Vincenzo Leone, Antonio Buonomo, Leonardo Marchi, Manfredo Squeri, and Rosario Lupo.\n\nIf you believe you may have contracted the virus, call your doctor, don’t visit, or contact the national Coronavirus Health Information Hotline on 1800 020 080.\n\nIf you are struggling to breathe or experiencing a medical emergency, call 000."
