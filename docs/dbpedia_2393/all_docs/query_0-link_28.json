        "text": "Falloppio [Falloppia, in a variety of spellings], Gabriele\n\n1. Dates\n\nBorn: Modena, c. 1523\n\nDied: Padua, 9 Oct. 1562 (Although a couple of portraits say 1663, and this year is sometimes repeated, Favaro is quite definite on 1562, and he cites incontrovertable evidence.)\n\nDateinfo: Birth Uncertain\n\nLifespan: 39\n\n2. Father\n\nOccupation: Artisan, Soldier\n\nCapparoni says that Girolamo Falloppio was from a noble family which owned property in Padua. Favaro tears this pleasant fantasy to shreds. Girolamo Falloppio was initially a goldsmith and then a freeland scoundrel who, as a soldier, undertook the dirty work of his masters.\n\nFavaro thinks that Girolamo, as the soldier client of a tyrant in control of Modena, was doing well by the time of his marriage (aside from the fact that he had contacted syphilis, as part of the fateful French expedition to Naples that may have carried the disease across the alps). By the time of his death, when Gabriele was about ten, the father was destitute, and his family had severe financial difficulties after his death.\n\n3. Nationality\n\nBirth: Italian\n\nCareer: Italian\n\nDeath: Italian\n\n4. Education\n\nSchooling: Ferrara, M.D.\n\nFalloppio learned medicine initially, not in a university but at the Medical College of Modena. There he carried out a dissection in 1545, and he earned the right to practice in Modena as a surgeon. Realizing the limitations that would always attach to this empirical practice, he took himself to Ferrara in 1545 for formal university study. There is a story that he studied for a time at Padua under Gianbattista da Monte and Matteo Realdo Colombo, but Favaro finds this highly dubious. He studied in Ferrara under Antonio Musa Brassavola from 1545 to 47; Favaro is convinced that he earned the M.D. I will, as usual assume a B.A. or its equivalent. Giambattista Canano was a fellow student.\n\n5. Religion\n\nAffiliation: Catholic\n\nModena was a center of Lutheran sentiment in Italy, and in 1542 Falloppio was among those officially suspect. At some point near then, however, he was nevertheless ordained a priest (and was hence able to inherit his uncle's canonry). He apparently resigned his priesthood before many years.\n\n6. Scientific Disciplines\n\nPrimary: Anatomy, Physiology, Medicine\n\nSubordinate: Surgery, Pharmacology\n\nOf the various works by Falloppio only the Observationes anatomicae (1561) was published during his lifetime and was fully authentic. It is a work of great originality. In this work he made a number of contributions to the knowledge of primary and secondary centers of ossification, to the detailed account of muscles, and to the understanding of the vascular system and of the kidneys. His desription of the uterine tubes was sufficiently accurate that they bear his name. He also explained the physiological uses of various features. With Vesalius and Eustachi, he is often perceived as one of the three heroes of anatomy.\n\nThe remainder of his writings, originally lecture notes, were edited for publication at various times after his death.\n\nHe did extensive work on medicine and in pharmacology. He was one of the early experts on syphilis.\n\nHe was one of the great surgeons of the age, and one who instituted new procedures.\n\n7. Means of Support\n\nPrimary: Academia, Medicine\n\nSecondary: Church Life, Patronage\n\nIn 1548 he received from an uncle an ecclesiastical benefice which he was able to hold in absentia, and from the same uncle he inherited a canonry in Modena. He resigned the canonry at once, but it does appear that he enjoyed the income from the benefice for several years, until he renounced the status of priest.\n\nHe began the practice of surgery when he was still a student, but soon went on to medical study in the university.\n\n1548-9, professor of pharmacy in Ferrara.\n\n1549-51, professor of anatomy at the University of Pisa.\n\n1551-62, professor of anatomy and surgery at the University of Padua and lecturer on simples. His initial stipend at Padua was 200 florins; later it was increased to 270.\n\nIn 1557-9, and then again in 1561, bitterly unhappy at Padua, he negotiated with the University of Bologna to move there. In 1561 he was offered a salary of 400 scudi, and had he not died, he would have moved to Bologna as the Professor of Practical Medicine (Medical Practice?)\n\nFalloppio was famous in his age as a physician. He was called to treat prominent patients as far away as Florence and even Rome. He had a prominent practice among the Venetian patriciate.\n\nIn 1552, at the request of Pope Julius III, Falloppio was given leave from the university to go to Rome to treat Baldovino del Monte, the Pope's brother.\n\n8. Patronage\n\nTypes: Court Official, Eccesiastic Official\n\nThe Grand Duke Cosimo I, when he was seeking to establish his new university as a prominent institution, called Falloppio to Pisa in 1549.\n\nToward the end of his life he became in effect the family physician to the Este of Ferrara.\n\nHe was medical consultant to the Gonzaga in Mantua.\n\n9. Technological Involvement\n\nTypes: Medical Practice, Pharmacology\n\n10. Scientific Societies\n\nMembership: Medical College\n\nHe became a member of the Medical College of Venice in 1556.\n\nHe established a relation with Ghini in Pisa when he was there, and this relation continued.\n\nHe had friction with Anguillara in Padua.\n\nHe corresponded heavily with Aldrovandi. Many of these letter have been published, though I gather not as a collection, but rather in separate works. See Favaro, p. 8.\n\nSources\n\nGiuseppe Favaro, Gabrielle Falloppia Modenese (MDXXIII-MDLXII): studio biographico, (Modena, 1928).\n\nPietro Capparoni, Profili bio-bibliografici di medici e naturalisti celebri italiani dal sec.
