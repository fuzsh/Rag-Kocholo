French Croix de Guerre (war Cross). Unnamed as issued. A cross pattée with crossed swords between the arms. Obverse: The centrepiece bearing the head of 'Marianne' of the French Republic facing right surrounded by 'REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE' and a laurel wreath at the base. Reverse: The dates '1914 1918' on two lines in the centre circle. The Cross has a loose ring suspender fitted to a ball mount on the top arm. A piece of 37 mm green ribbon with seven red stripes, with a bronze five pointed star pinned to the front, is attached to the suspender ring.

The Croix de Guerre was awarded for bravery to military personnel who were mentioned in dispatches. Recipients of the Légion d'Honneur and Médaille Militaire were automatically entitled to the Croix de Guerre. For subsequent acts of bravery, the recipient was awarded a bronze palm leaf for Army citations, a gold star for Corps citations, a silver star for Division citations or a bronze star for Brigade and Regimental citations. This medal is part of a collection assembled by the late Hon. Sir Thomas Hughes, Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales. It was presented to the Memorial in memory of his son, Captain Roger Forrest Hughes, Australian Army Medical Corps, who died of wounds in France on 11 December 1916 and his grandson, Flying Officer Peter Roger Forrest Hughes, 12 Squadron, Royal Australian Air Force, who was killed on active service while flying in the Northern Territory on 3 October 1942.
