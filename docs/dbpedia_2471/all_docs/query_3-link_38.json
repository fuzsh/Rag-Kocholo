It was primarily awarded for bravery or other military virtue on the battlefield. The award was reestablished on 20 July 1940 by the Belgian government in exile for recognition of bravery and military virtue during World War II. The post-1940 decoration could also be awarded to units that were cited.

It continues a Czechoslovak order of the same name created in 1922 as an award for foreigners (Czechoslovakia had no civilian decoration for its citizens in the 1920s and 1930s). It was inspired by the Czech Nobility Cross created in 1814 by the Emperor and King Francis I and awarded to 37 Bohemian noblemen.\n\nRecipients of The Czechoslovak Order of the White Lion\n\nCzechoslovakia – Military Cross\n\nThe Czechoslovak Military Cross 1939 (War Cross 1939) (Československý válečný kříž 1939 in Czech, Československý vojnový kríž 1939 in Slovak) is a military decoration of the former state of Czechoslovakia which was issued for those who had provided great service to the Czechoslovak state (in exile) during the years of World War II.\n\nRecipients of The Czechoslovak Military Cross 1939\n\nCzechoslovakia – Medal of Merit\n\nThe Czechoslovakian Medal of Merit (Československý Za zásluhy) is awarded to members of the Czechoslovak military for outstanding contributions to the Czechoslovak military, not necessarily in in combat roles.

Soon after the outbreak of World War I, French military officials felt that a new military award had to be created. At that time, the Citation du jour (“Daily Service Citation”) already existed to acknowledge soldiers, but it was just a sheet of paper. There are three distinct Croix de Guerre medals in the French system of honours: Croix de guerre 1914–1918, Croix de guerre 1939–1945 and Croix de guerre des théâtres d’opérations extérieures (for wars other than World War I and World War II not fought on French soil). There are are also additional levels within each of the three: a bronze star for citation in the Order of the Regiment or Brigade; a silver star for citation in the Order of the Division; a vermeil star for citation to the Order of the Army Corps and a bronze palm for citation to the Order of the Army.

It was re-authorised on 19 April 1947 for the Greek Civil War (1946–1949) and extended until 1953, covering the Greek participation in the Korean War. It was awarded to Greek and Allied military personnel, as well as to regimental war flags.\n\nRecipients of the Greek War Cross\n\nItaly – Bronze Medal of Military Valour\n\nThe Bronze Medal of Military Valour (Medaglia di bronzo al valor militare) is an Italian medal for gallantry.

Comparable to the French Legion of Honor, but much less frequently awarded, it is open to all without distinction of rank or nobility, not only to Dutch military personnel, but also to foreigners. To date, membership in the Order is extremely rare, and only for exceptional bravery in combat.\n\nRecipients of the Netherlands Military Order of William\n\nNetherlands – Order of Orange-Nassau\n\nThe Order of Orange-Nassau is awarded for longstanding meritorious service to society, the State or the Royal House.
