        "text": "The Croix de Guerre (English translation: Cross of War) is a military decoration of France, first created in 1915. It consists of a square-cross medal on two crossed swords, hanging from a ribbon with various degree pins.\n\nThe decoration was awarded during World War I, World War II and in other conflicts. The Croix de guerre was also commonly bestowed on foreign military forces allied to France.\n\nThe Croix de Guerre may either be awarded as an individual or unit award to those soldiers who distinguish themselves by acts of heroism involving combat with the enemy.\n\nThe medal is awarded to those who have been \"mentioned in despatches\", meaning a heroic deed or deeds were performed meriting a citation from an individual's headquarters unit.
