        "text": "November 11th is Armistice Day, also recognized as Veteran’s Day in America. The World War I armistice began on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918 and marked the end of four years of bitter World War I fighting between Germany and the Allies. Here’s a 100-day multimedia countdown of WWI that takes us up to the 100th anniversary of the armistice.\n\nSunday, November 11, 2018 –\n\nArmistice Day, World War I: It arrived on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in 1918. The war ended after 4-years of fighting including an estimated 11,000 lives killed in the last day of fighting. Henry Gunther was among them, the last American soldier to die. And then, it was over.\n\nFrom the battlefields of France, Belgium and beyond men who were once enemies shook hands, swapped cigarettes, sang songs and danced. From Paris to London, Washington, and New York, armistice celebrations unfolded. The suffering of war replaced by rejoicing. In the video below watch scenes of the WWI armistice countdown and subsequent celebration.\n\nThe armistice meant both sides of the war agreed to stop fighting. It was a defeat for Germany, but not a surrender. The Allies and Germany agreed to the following:\n\nGermany would accept blame for the war with reparations paid for all damages\n\nOccupied lands in Belgium, Luxembourg, and France–plus Alsace-Lorraine would be evacuated by Germany within 14 days\n\nGerman forces must also withdraw from Austria-Hungary, Romania, and Turkey\n\nThe Allies would occupy Germany west of the Rhine River\n\nGermany would surrender 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 8 cruisers, and 160 submarines\n\nGermany would be stripped of heavy armaments, including 5,000 artillery, 25,000 machine guns, and 2,000 airplanes\n\n5,000 locomotives, 150,000 railway cars, and 5,000 trucks would be confiscated from Germany\n\nThe Allied naval blockade would continue\n\nArmistice Day brought relief, celebrations, and joy for millions of people. It also brought a permanent loss of innocence for those countries, including America, and lives, including Americans, who were forever changed by WWI. An estimated 9-million soldiers died in the fighting. Millions more were wounded, gassed and permanently scarred in the war. On 11/11/1918, the bloodiest, most miserable conflict in history until that time was finally over.\n\nWorld War I, the “war to end all wars” wasn’t. World War II would follow 22-years later. History would revisit mankind with another terrible lesson. Millions of lives again would be lost in battle. “It is not enough to win a war; it is more important to organize the peace.” – Aristotle\n\nSaturday, November 10, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I: Through the lens of J. Patras – I recently discovered the stunning and candid WWI photographs of Paris, France photographer J. Patras in a collection at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The vintage images reveal the ravages of war but also the images that tell us more about the personal lives of the men and women who fought the war. Ironically, I could find no photograph of the artist, J. Patras, who took the following photographs.\n\nFriday, November 9, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I’s silent killer – When American troops sailed to France in late 1918 – a silent killer- a highly contagious strain of flu- came with them across the Atlantic to the trenches of the Great War.\n\nWhen the H1N1 strain of the flu struck during the Meuse-Argonne battle it was impossible for General John J. Pershing to ignore its effect on the American Expeditionary Forces. He wrote of the flu epidemic’s effect on his troops who were fighting for their lives in the Meuse-Argonne.\n\n“The total number of influenza cases treated in hospitals was nearly 70,000, of whom many developed a grave form of pneumonia. The death rate from influenza rose to 32 percent of cases for the A.E.F.”\n\nNot even Pershing was immune from the virus he called “the grippe.” His diary shows it forced him to bed for several days under doctor’s orders.\n\nAt the time of the flu outbreak there were no effective drugs or vaccines to treat the killer strain. Some epidemiologists believe the unsanitary trenches conditions in WWI caused the virus to mutate into a global killer strain that hurt the effectiveness of soldiers fighting on both sides of the war. “When these men went down from the flu, and they didn’t even recognize it, said historian and Pershing author Mitchell Yockelson. “The Medical Corps in some cases didn’t know it was the flu immediately. Didn’t really know how to treat it.”\n\nDr. Frederick Holmes, an emeritus professor of Medicine at the University of Kansas School of Medicine wrote that the U.S. Army did a better job of keeping their soldiers in the front lines when the flu epidemic hit than the Germans because U.S. base hospitals could be more quickly reached by special ambulance trains. “They had special wards for influenza patients and, with excellent nursing care, were able to return the majority of them to the front after brief periods of convalescence,” wrote Dr. Holmes. “It is not possible to over-estimate the altruism, value, and importance of the thousands of American nurses who cared for sick soldiers and who stemmed the tide of the influenza pandemic.”\n\nHow deadly was the flu in 1918? In World War I, the flu killed more Americans than enemy weapons. Worldwide, it killed more people (Estimates run as high as 30-50 million people) than the Great War itself.\n\nThursday, November 8, 2018 –\n\nThe Christmas Truce- One of World War I’s most iconic events unfolded early in the war and stood in stark contrast to four years of deadly combat that killed millions of soldiers fighting on both sides of the Great War. It was the “Christmas Truce” of 1914.\n\nIn January 1915, the first eyewitness accounts of the truce began appearing in British newspapers. One of the best told the tale of Britain’s 1st Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment who agreed to an informal truce with German troops in the Rue du Bois sector of France near the town of Armentieres.\n\nTo be sure, there were several “Christmas Truces” involving French, British, Belgian and German soldiers along the Western Front, and German and Russian soldiers along the Eastern Front too. I had not been aware of this. The Armentieres “Christmas Truce” unfolded after both sides agreed to a temporary cease-fire so they could collect and bury their battlefield dead. The truce also allowed German and British soldiers the opportunity to leave the confines of their cold, miserably wet and muddy trenches for a few hours so they could walk across the battlefield without fear of being shot or blasted with artillery.\n\nOne of the best-known accounts of this truce was recorded by British Captain Reginald John Armes. It came in a letter Armes sent his wife and is preserved today in England’s Staffordshire Regiment Museum. Here is what Captain Armes wrote his wife:\n\n“I have just been through one of the most extraordinary scenes imaginable. To-night is Xmas Eve and I came up into the trenches this evening for my tour of duty in them. Firing was going on all the time and the enemy’s machine guns were at it hard, firing at us. Then about seven the firing stopped.\n\nI was in my dug-out reading a paper and the mail was being dished out. It was reported that the Germans had lighted their trenches up all along our front. We had been calling to one another for some time Xmas wishes and other things. I went out and they shouted “no shooting” and then somehow the scene became a peaceful one. All our men got out of their trenches and sat on the parapet, the Germans did the same, and they talked to one another in English and broken English. I got on top of the trench and talked German and asked them to sing a German Volkslied, which they did, then our men sang quite well and each side clapped and cheered the other.\n\nI asked a German who sang a solo to sing one of Schumann’s songs, so he sang The Two Grenadiers splendidly. Our men were a good audience and really enjoyed his singing.\n\nThen Pope (?) and I walked across and held a conversation with the German officer in command.\n\nOne of his men introduced us properly, he asked my name and then presented me to his officer. I gave the latter permission to bury some German dead who are lying in between us, and we agreed to have no shooting until 12 midnight tomorrow. We talked together, 10 or more Germans gathered round. I was almost in their lines within a yard or so. We saluted each other, he thanked me for permission to bury his dead, and we fixed up how many men were to do it, and that otherwise, both sides must remain in their trenches.\n\nThen we wished one another goodnight and a good night’s rest, and a happy Xmas and parted with a salute. I got back to the trench. The Germans sang Die Wacht Am Rhein it sounded well. Then our men sang quite well Christians Awake, it sounded so well, and with a good night, we all got back into our trenches. It was a curious scene, a lovely moonlit night, the German trenches with small lights on them, and the men on both sides gathered in groups on the parapets.\n\nAt times we heard the guns in the distance and an occasional rifle shot. I can hear them now, but about us is absolute quiet. I allowed one or two men to go out and meet a German or two halfway. They exchanged cigars, a smoke and talked. The officer I spoke to hopes we shall do the same on New Year’s Day, I said: “yes, if I am here”. I felt I must sit down and write the story of this Xmas Eve before I went to lie down. Of course, no precautions are relaxed, but I think they mean to play the game. All the same, I think I shall be awake all night so as to be on the safe side. It is weird to think that tomorrow night we shall be at it hard again. If one gets through this show it will be an Xmas time to live in one’s memory. The German who sang had a really fine voice.\n\nAm just off for a walk around the trenches to see all is well. Goodnight.”\n\nYou can read dozens more transcribed letters from different variations of the 1914 Christmas Truce, which is curated by journalists Alan Cleaver and Lesley Park.)\n\nWednesday, November 7, 2018 –\n\n“Black Jack Pershing: Love and War” makes it’s San Antonio premiere tomorrow where General John J. Pershing has quite a historic connection. In February 1917, Maj. Gen. John J. Pershing became commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) with headquarters at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio. Pershing immediately began preparing Fort Sam Houston for the coming World War I conflict.\n\nIn addition to his military duties, Pershing advised and assisted San Antonio civilian authorities as the city and state of Texas talked increasingly of America’s potential entry into the war. General Pershing spoke to any audience that invited him and educated them on the proper duties of a citizen in wartime. He supported the drafting of all-bodied men and convinced Texas Governor James Ferguson to argue his case for a draft before the Texas congressional delegation. After notification on May 2, 1917, that he would be in charge of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe, Pershing left for Washington, D. C.\n\nTwo months later Pershing arrived in Europe to command U.S. troops in WWI combat against Germany.\n\nHere’s another enduring Pershing legacy that involved San Antonio and Fort Sam Houston: ‘Pershing’s Chinese’ leave mark on history, Fort Sam Houston\n\nIn the deeper article link above, you’ll read about Pershing’s efforts after WWI to get Congress to pass legislation allowing Chinese laborers who were loyal to America during the Mexican Pancho Villa Punitive Expedition and during WWI to remain in the U.S., and later to be able to bring their families to America from China.\n\nWriting in the San Antonio Express-News, reporter L.A. Shively noted: “After reaching a peak of 836 individuals in 1900, the Chinese population in Texas declined as a result of the Chinese Exclusion Act signed in 1882. The (federal) law came into being with the intent of preserving jobs for U.S. residents.\n\nChinese immigration nearly ceased for 60 years, except for in 1917 when Gen. John J. Pershing brought 427 Chinese refugees from Mexico.\n\nKnown as “Pershing’s Chinese,” the men had attached themselves to an expeditionary force conducted by the U.S. Army against the paramilitary forces of Mexican insurgent Francisco “Pancho” Villa from 1916 to 1917, explains Edward Brisco in his Master’s thesis titled “Pershing’s Chinese Refugees: An Odyssey of the Southwest.”\n\n“At any truck concentration point, or any sort of military station, one Chinese at least appeared,” writes Brisco. “Pies, doughnuts, candy, tobacco, matches and fruit were stock items that these desert merchants offered for sale. The soldiers bought on sight. There were no competitors. Soap was a dear commodity and none could be found except at a ‘Chinaman’s stand.'”\n\nThe Chinese who came to San Antonio with Pershing’s troops had worked in Mexico for centuries as shipbuilders and servants on Spanish trading ships, working in or around Fort Sam Houston during the buildup for World War I. San Antonio Express-New reporter Scott Huddleston wrote:\n\n“This new wave of Chinese immigrants in San Antonio spoke more Spanish than English, with many living in the “Laredito” area in what now is the western part of downtown, expanding the city’s Chinese population to 600 by the early 1940s. Repeal of the exclusionary law in 1943 made it possible for Chinese Texans to ask their family members overseas to join them.”\n\n“All had dreams of permanent residency in America and felt a deep commitment and loyalty to the Army and to San Antonio as their “rescuers” according to Mel Brown, author of “Chinese Heart of Texas.””\n\nThanks in part to Pershing, San Antonio had the largest Chinese population until the early 1950’s. It still thrives today with many of the descendants of Chinese who arrived with Pershing and his troops more than a century ago.\n\nOne of those descendants is 79-year-old Chinese-American Mitchel Wong, founder of the Austin Eye Clinic in Austin, Texas. Wong started the ophthalmology practice in 1969. He was a University of Texas undergraduate.\n\nWong’s story was chronicled by Qiling Wanga for Reporting Texas in 2016. A century ago, Wong’s grandfather was a baker with Pershing’s troops in Mexico. “When Gen. Pershing went down to chase Pancho Villa, [Dun Wong] baked for Gen. Pershing’s army,” Wong said.\n\nWhen Dun Wong and his wife Lee Shee settled in San Antonio, he opened several grocery stores. “Our family was one of the first Chinese families with a mom and a dad to settle in Texas. There were a lot of single males that did not have their wives with them. But my grandfather had his wife,” said Wong, who graduated from Baylor Medical School before opening his practice in Austin.\n\nThe remarkable Wong family journey to America, citizenship, and legacy came full circle two years ago. The Wong family pledged to donate more than $20 million to UT’s Dell Medical School to create the Mitchel and Shannon Wong Eye Institute.\n\nMy thanks to Phil Bakke for inviting me to screen my documentary in San Antonio tomorrow evening.\n\nTuesday, November 6, 2018 –\n\nRace to Sedan, France – After 42 punishing, deadly days of fighting American troops finally gained the upper hand against the Germans in early November 1918 in the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne. There, more than 1.2 million U.S. troops fought the largest American battle ever. It was bigger than the World War II Battle of the Bulge (500,000 U.S. soldiers), or the WWII Normandy Invasion in which 156,000 Americans participated.\n\nBy the Meuse-Argonne battle’s end, 26,277 Americans were killed and 95,786 wounded. The final American objective of World War I was the rugged region around French town of Sedan. It was a final furious U.S. push to cut off the entire German 2nd Army and sever the enemy railroads that supplied and transported German troops.\n\nSedan was also an important objective for the French. It had been the site of a major French defeat by the Germans during the Franco Prussian War. For those reasons, Sedan was targeted for recapture by the Fourth French Army.\n\nAmerican Expeditionary Forces commander, General John J. Pershing wrote about Sedan in his diary on November the 5th and his desire to see General Theodore Dickman’s U.S. Army’s I Corps be the first U.S. troops to free Sedan.\n\nAfter almost a month-and-a-half of fighting , U.S. troops had finally forced the Germans from the trenches. The doughboys were now chasing them into a hasty retreat back toward the Meuse River and into Germany.\n\nOn November 6, General Pershing’s diary showed his desire for U.S. troops to beat French troops to Sedan. He suggested French General Paul Maistre, whose troops were fighting on the right flank of the American troops, would approve.\n\nGeneral Dickman would have other Allied competition in the glory race to free Sedan of its 4-year German occupation. 1st Division commander General Charles Summerall also ordered his troops to be the first to recapture Sedan. Soon they crossed into the advance line of Dickman’s I Corps troops. In the ensuing chaos, the U.S. troops opened fire on each other. A furious General Dickman called for General Summerall to be court-martialed. Cooler heads ultimately prevailed. The May 1922 edition of the Saturday Evening Post finishes this post.\n\nMonday, November 5, 2018 –\n\nWhy did we call them “Doughboys?” – That’s the nickname given to U.S. soldiers who fought in World War I. Where did the nickname originate? There’s no definitive answer to the doughboys’ moniker that was often applied to the WWI American Expeditionary Forces who fought in Europe.\n\nHere are two theories for the “doughboy” name: Author Paul Dickson’s book “War Slang” cites American journalist H.L. Mencken who said “doughboy” had its origins in the Continental Army soldiers of the late 1700’s who kept the piping on their uniforms white by smearing it with light-colored clay. When the Continental soldiers marched through rain clay on their uniforms turned into “doughy blobs,” thus the doughboy moniker.\n\nAnother explanation and one that makes sense to me based on old film and photos I have seen: The dust that covered American soldiers as they marched through dusty terrain covered them with what looked like baking flour. The video below from my documentary “Black Jack Pershing: Love and War” explains.\n\nOne variation of this account, according to the Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang, came from the Mexican-American War. It described the U.S. soldiers being covered in the dust of adobe soil and were called “adobes,” which author Elizabeth Nix wore “morphed into “dobies” and, eventually, “doughboys.””\n\nWhich doughboy version is most likely true? I can’t say. I side with author Michael E. Hanlon’s Mexican-American war theory.\n\nHe wrote “The Adobe Theory: in a nutshell – in marching over the parched terrain of the deserts of Northern Mexico the infantry stirred up so much dust that they took on the look of the adobe buildings of the region — hence, [after a few phonetic adjustments] doughboys. This theory has possibly the best “fit” to the facts of the campaign in Mexico as known, yet it has no backing from the historical record. It appears to be the product strictly of 20th-century speculation. Nevertheless, it is the favorite theory of doughboy chronicler Laurence Stallings and of this writer as well.”\n\nSunday, November 4, 2018 –\n\nKansas City’s World War I Memorial bathed in poppies- A week from today America and dozens of other countries will commemorate the 100th anniversary of World War I’s armistice. On the 11th minute of the 11th hour of the 11th day of November 1918, four years of fighting that claimed the lives of more than nine-million soldiers ended.\n\nIn Kansas City, Missouri the iconic World War I Memorial which towers above the city, is being lit with thousands of projected poppies this week in memory of those who died in the Great War.\n\nHow did poppies come to represent WWI? According to Smithsonian author Erin Blakemore, after the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium, Canadian doctor John McCrae noticed red poppies growing near one of Flanders’ Fields’ mass cemeteries where hundreds of thousands of British soldiers died. McCrae wrote a poem, “In Flanders Fields,” in 1915, which was published in Britain. “In Flanders fields the poppies blow,” wrote McCrae, “Between the crosses, row on row.” It went on to become the war’s most popular and most recognized poem in the United States and Great Britain.\n\nThe WWI Memorial in Kansas City is notable for many reasons. One historic reason: It was the only place after WWI ended that the Allied commanders would gather with U.S. General John J. Pershing to help dedicate the memorial in 1921. Click on the video below to see the crowds that gathered for the occasion. It reminds us of America’s great sacrifices in the war and how our country honored those who sacrificed their lives in WWI.\n\nSaturday, November 3, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I sparks medical advances – Or as Mary Merritt Crawford, the only woman doctor at the American Hospital in Paris during WWI put it: “A war benefits medicine more than it benefits anybody else. It’s terrible, of course, but it does.”\n\nIt does by necessity and often desperation. World War I brought unparalleled carnage into the 20th century. The new technology of war—heavy artillery, poison gas, long-range cannons, barrage shelling, grenades, and machine guns—caused unprecedented devastation. An estimated 10 million soldiers died in the war. Millions more were injured, many seriously, giving doctors the opportunity and incentive to develop new ways to dramatically improve a soldier’s chances of survival.\n\nAuthor Ellen Hampton wrote: “They went from amputation as the only solution, to being able to transport soldiers to hospitals, to disinfect their wounds and to operate on them to repair the damage wrought by artillery. Ambulances, antiseptic, and anesthesia, three elements of medicine taken entirely for granted today, emerged from the depths of suffering in the First World War.”\n\nFor example, Dr. George Crile and nurse Agatha Hodkins introduced the use of nitrous oxide as a new form of anesthesia for use in surgery for soldiers wounded in combat. The nitrous oxide-oxygen mix put patients into a sleep that allowed surgeries to be performed without leaving them in a state of shock.\n\nFacial reconstructive surgery also took a giant step forward during WWI. Soldiers survived having their jaws and noses shattered by artillery fragments, so surgeons at the American Hospital and Val-de-Grace Hospital in France pioneered new maxillofacial techniques and incorporated dentistry into the treatment of wounded Allied soldiers in France.\n\nOn the battlefields of the Western Front, blood transfusions and various medicines were used to care for the wounded. British Captain Oswald Robertson foresaw the need to stockpile blood before combat casualties arrived for treatment. According to the BBC, Robertson established the first blood bank on the Western Front in 1917. He used sodium citrate to prevent the blood from coagulating and becoming unusable. Blood was kept on ice for up to 28 days and then transported to casualty clearing stations for use in life-saving surgery.\n\nProminent French surgeon Dr. Alexis Carrel realized that the war’s greatest surgical need was a better method to sterilize wounds. He and English chemist Henry D. Dakin developed a system called the Carrel-Dakin solution to irrigate wounds with a sterilizing solution of boric acid and sodium hypochlorite. It saved soldiers’ lives and reduced infection-related amputations. Dakin developed the solution. Carrel developed the apparatus to deliver it.\n\nDelays in treatment often meant the difference between life and death, so innovations in transport changed the nature of medical care during wartime. With the war’s massive casualties, the three-part triage system was elevated into common use. It prioritized the treatment of wounded soldiers for the doctors and nurses who attended them: (1) wounded soldiers requiring minimal care before returning to the front lines, (2) more seriously injured soldiers in need of hospital attention, and (3) soldiers expected to not live despite medical treatment.\n\nBefore soldiers reached hospitals where triage took place, there was a multi-step to move them from battlefield to hospital bed. First, injured soldiers were taken by stretcher to a regimental aid post. Then they were transferred into a motorized ambulance that took them to a casualty clearing station. From there wounded and injured soldiers were taken by hospital train to a base hospital.\n\nThere were other wartime advances in medicine: Mobile X-ray equipment was used near the battlefield to locate shrapnel and bullets in wounded soldiers so they could be removed. New hygiene methods were used in combat trenches to reduce lice-borne diseases being transmitted to soldiers. Many of the new medical techniques developed during the Great War continued to be improved and called into use again during World War II. Some, like the “Dakin Solution,” is still used in wound care centers today around the world more than 100 years after its use in WWI.\n\nFriday, November 2, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I in Rotogravure – During World War I, America’s leading newspapers used a new printing process called rotogravure printing. It employed a technique that resulted in high-quality photo illustrations that could be quickly and inexpensively printed by newspapers. For newspapers like the New York Times and New York Herald, the switch to the new printing technique was an immediate hit with advertisers and readers.\n\nAccording to the Library of Congress, rotogravure produced higher quality halftone reproductions of photos that could be printed using a high-speed roll-on process that used a metal etched cylinder. The metal etchings had recessed cells that held more ink and created prints with high-quality tonal gradations and color depth.\n\nDuring WWI, the New York Times used rotogravure illustrations to regularly report and graphically document the people, places, and events who were a part of the war efforts abroad and at home.\n\n“These pictorials were important tools for promoting U.S. propaganda and influenced how readers viewed world events,” wrote the Library of Congress. As a result, the rotogravure pictorial sections in newspapers became the most widely read section of the paper and provided a great opportunity to reach new customers.\n\nThursday, November 1, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I trivia- Franklin D. Roosevelt may have been the first and only U.S. president to fly a dirigible airship, also known as a blimp or Zeppelin.\n\nDuring World War I, Roosevelt was President Woodrow Wilson’s Assistant Secretary of the Navy. In 1918, he traveled to Europe to inspect U.S. Navy facilities. During FDR’s trip, he visited a French military base in Paimboeuf, France on August 17th, 1918 and was offered a ride aboard a French-built airship. He gladly accepted.\n\nHere is a photograph showing FDR (wearing the dress hat) aboard what is believed to be the deck of a French dirigible. Photo: FDR Library and Museum\n\nHere is what FDR wrote in his personal diary about his airship experience in France:\n\n“I tried my hand at running the lateral stearing[sic] gear and also the elevating and depressing gear. The sensation is distinctly curious, less noise than an areo.[sic] and far more feeling of drifting at the mercy of the wind.” – FDR diary\n\nAccording to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum, Allied airships were primarily used for scouting missions and mine clearance during WWI. They were deemed too vulnerable for use for combat on the Western Front. The Germans did use Zeppelins to drop bombs on France and Britain during WWI. They caused civilian fatalities but were most were effective in instilling fear in people.\n\nKate Argyle, from English Heritage, said: “There was no military advantage. It was all about instilling terror and really that’s what these aerial bombardments did. The Zeppelins would come out of the dark – you couldn’t see them and it was totally random. You didn’t know if you were running towards danger or away from it.”\n\nAfter the war, the use of airships declined as airplane technology advanced and several high profile airship accidents took place. Among them was the infamous Hindenburg crash in New Jersey in 1937. This may explain why FDR’s trip aboard an airship would be the first and last time any future or sitting U.S. president had an airship experience.\n\nWednesday, October 31, 2018 –\n\nTanks, the Devil’s Chariots” in World War I – The earliest renditions of today’s modern, technologically advanced tanks first rumbled into battle during WWI. Those tanks were slow, prone to mechanical failure and hellish to man. They also forever changed land-based combat in war.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci first conceived the tank in 1487 when he wrote; “I can make armored cars, safe and unassailable, which will enter the closed ranks of the enemy with their artillery, and no company of soldiers is so great that it will not break through them. And behind these our infantry will be able to follow quite unharmed and without any opposition.”\n\nMore than three centuries later, da Vinci’s concept was put to practice in 1916. The first tanks used in war were called Mark I’s and deployed by the British in a battle near Flers, France. British designers first called them “landships,” but stuck with the nickname “tank” by the crews that built them because they looked like water tanks.\n\nThe Author Sean Bryant wrote that the tanks “crawled along at under four miles per hour, picking their way through a landscape of shattered tree stumps and mud. As the dawn broke, a single machine made its way through ranks of soldiers, passed into the churned wasteland between the lines, began to fire, and the age of the tank began.”\n\nDesigned and built with the challenges of trench warfare in mind, tanks had the ability to leave the roads. With armor-plated protection, they could tear through barbed wire and roll, while firing guns, across the enemy trench lines.\n\nThe 28-foot-long British tanks required a crew of 8 – a commander, driver, 4 gunners and 2 men to shift gears. At each tank’s center sat a loud, hot, inadequately ventilated engine. “Lacking any kind of suspension, just taking a ride in one could be an unpleasant and dangerous experience,” wrote Bryant.\n\nThe Germans only produced 20 tanks that saw battle in WWI, but converted dozens of captured British Mark I’s for their use in the war. The French produced the largest number of tanks and had the greatest success with Renault FT tanks that only needed a crew of two.\n\nThe FT was the first tank to use a top-mounted turret capable of turning a full 360-degrees The FT is considered by many to have been the truly ‘modern’ tank. It had a layout followed by almost all designs ever since: driver at the front; main armament in a fully rotating turret on top; engine at the rear.\n\nPrevious FT models had been “box tanks”, with a single crowded space combining the role of engine room, fighting compartment, ammunition stock and driver’s cabin. The FT had the largest production run of any tank of the war, with over 3700 built, more numerous than all British tanks combined.\n\nWhen the British attacked German trenches outside Flers, 49 Mark I tanks were launched on the assault alongside infantry divisions. Bryant noted that more than a third of the tanks’ engines failed before they could reach the battle’s starting point. When the attack began more tanks broke, were delayed or became stuck. Final result? Only nine of the tanks reached their goal.\n\n“As the battle raged, wrote Bryant, “the crew of a British aircraft overhead reported, “A tank is walking up the High Street of Flers with the British army cheering behind.” The reputation of the tank was born.”\n\nTuesday, October 30, 2018 –\n\nBattle of Belleau Wood: Leo Bailey’s memories – Sergeant Leo Joseph Bailey was wounded at Belleau Wood in World War I while diving for his dugout during an artillery attack. He spent the next two months recuperating from an artillery shrapnel wound to his right arm in various hospitals. Despite his injury, he later looked back fondly on this period.\n\nIn his memoir, found in the Library of Congress, Bailey recalls the Battle of Belleau Wood, or “Belleau Woods,” as he called it. In the video below, I have narrated and added video support to illustrate Bailey’s WWI story.\n\nMonday, October 29, 2018 –\n\nThe Red Cross in WWI- When America declared war against Germany in April 1917 the American Red Cross began its historic transformation. According to the American Red Cross, it went from a small organization with limited staff and funds to a massive, globally influential institution.\n\nIn the spring of 1917, the fighting in World War I took thousands of lives daily in Europe. Word of the dismal trench conditions in France reached Americans back home and a harrowing reality began to sink in: American combat troops were going to be deployed in Europe in large numbers. Driven by a growing patriotic duty in America, citizens offered help to the Red Cross in greater numbers than ever before.\n\nIn May of 1917, President Woodrow Wilson appointed a War Council for the American Red Cross to raise funds, increase the organization’s reach, and plan how to best use financial resources for maximum benefit in the war. In the first year of the war, the Red Cross steadily expanded with membership growing to 22-million, including eight-million volunteers by the end of the year.\n\nSoon, Red Cross members spread across America in thousands of chapters. Each chapter advertised how members could help the Red Cross effort. The most popular means was by knitting goods. The “Home Service” also became a powerful instrument of the Red Cross during World War I. It provided aid to the families of military personnel. This included providing communication between troops and their families, offering financial aid to families who had lost a serviceman and providing information on acquiring government assistance.\n\nAccording to the International Encyclopedia of the First World War, International Red Cross societies supported their nations’ armies’ medical services during WWI. They brought relief to prisoners of war, sometimes organized their repatriation, and helped their civilian populations.\n\nDespite the universal ideal of an independent, neutral, and impartial Red Cross Movement, the national societies were subordinated to their respective governments. This means that integrated into the war effort, the various International Red Cross societies were also used as a tool for propaganda and the promotion of their countries abroad.\n\nSunday, October 28, 2018 –\n\nMeuse-Argonne Offensive: Albert Carpenter – A 19-year-old student when he enlisted in the 36th Division of the 142nd Infantry, Albert Carpenter served in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in France during the final days of World War I.\n\nAs a soldier in the trenches along the Hindenberg Line, he experienced the gassings, mud, and bloodshed for which the war is infamous. In a series of short but vivid entries, his diary chronicles a single month, October 1918, which he calls “the most eventful month of [his] life.”\n\nSaturday, October 5 – Got up late made a little coffee. Watched the war activities and cannon roaring at the front. Saw 2000 wounded French soldiers go through in ambulances. Last good night sleep.\n\nTuesday, October 8 – Will go over the top in 10 minutes. Later, a heavy artillery barrage. Many Boche (German) prisoners taken and machine guns also and many Americans killed. A German counterattack 4 p.m. unsuccessful. 142nd lost heavy.\n\nWednesday, October 9 – The battle continues. Boche (Germans) burning many towns back of (enemy) lines. Boche lay artillery barrage on relay station, a shell just went over my head and killed Lieutenant (Keith) Lowry. St. Etienne under heavy fire all day.\n\nFriday, October 11 – 142nd casualties still enlarging. Am very weak. Only two good meals since on front. 12 a.m. a gas shell came over. Did not get my gas mask on quick enough. Sent to field hospital. Taken about 20 pills and sent back to lines at 10 p.m.\n\nMonday, October 14 – My Company digs in and prepares for another Battle. Boche (Germans) have good position on Aisne River. Very dark now and then Boche shells would come near. Still raining, sleep in open all night, nearly froze. An awful headache. French artillery close to my (fox) hole.\n\nSaturday, October 19 – Has started to rain again. The river Aisne and Canal Du Nord seem to have made a good stronghold for the (Germans) Boche. We are nearly flanked on the right by the Boches. The French are unable to advance on our right. We may be taken prisoners at any minute. May have to throw my diary away destroy it.\n\nSaturday, October 27, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I: The Faces – A panoramic photo of Spencer, Massachusett’s WWI veterans has been recovered and restored by Brennan Gauthier whose captivating Portraits of War website has brought alive the images of the men and women who served our country in WWI.\n\nBrennan wrote this about the photo: “This photo comes from a small town in Central Massachusetts, not far from my hometown. I found the photo at an antiques flea market in Palmer, MA. The glass was incredibly dirty, and the photo has considerable moisture and mold damage and was in need of some TLC. The variety of service members is incredible! Of particular interest are the Postal Service member, the Marines, two tankers, and a handful of 26th Division members.”\n\nI decided to turn this photo into the video below to reflect on the individual lives of these men who survived the test of war.\n\nFriday, October 26, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I: The Faces – The thousands of photographs I’ve reviewed in my research on World War I has left me with one reflection: How young were the faces of the men and women fighting on both sides of the war. How tragic to know millions of those who served died in their youth. How fleeting life can be.\n\nAs I gazed the photo below of a British artillery company I decided to turn it into a video to reflect on the individual lives so dramatically changed by a war that was to end all wars. It turns out that war was fleeting too. Photo: Smithsonian Archives of American Art\n\nThursday, October 25, 2018 –\n\nWorld War I: Voices from the past – In 1918, Corporal Clarence C. Hope was fighting in the WWI Battle of the Meuse-Argonne when he was separated from his U.S. Army Artillery Brigade and exposed to German poison gas. Click on the video below to watch and hear Hope’s description of his harrowing battle to survive.\n\nWednesday, October 24, 2018 –\n\nArtillery in World War I and Germany’s Paris Gun- WWI ushered in many technological breakthroughs in the development of artillery. These developments made artillery on both sides of the fighting deadlier, and more accurate. An estimated 1.5-billion artillery shells were reportedly fired on the Western Front during WWI.\n\nWorkmen displaying various types and sizes of World War I era artillery shells produced at the Watertown Arsenal in Watertown, Massachusetts. Photo: National Archives and Records Administration\n\nWhich piece of artillery was most intimidating? It wasn’t the deadliest artillery, but Germany’s so-called “Paris Gun” may have been the most psychologically intimidating. The German long-range siege gun, of which there were several, were used between March and August 1918 to bomb Paris.\n\nWhen the guns were first fired, Parisians thought they were being attacked by high-altitude German Zeppelins. This is because the German supergun shells were fired from 81 miles away. The firing from the cannon’s 111-foot long barrel couldn’t be heard.\n\nAs military weapons, the Paris Guns had limitations: Relatively speaking, their shell size was small. The gun barrels wore out quickly. Their accuracy was only good enough for city-sized targets. None of this mattered to the German military: Its goal was to use the guns more as a psychological weapon against the morale of Parisians, and less to destroy the city.\n\nParis Guns, sometimes also called “Big Bertha,” fired 234-pound shells up to a range of 81 miles. On their flight path, Paris Gun shells arched to altitudes of 26 miles- the greatest height reached by man-made projectiles until the V-2 rocket flights 24-years later.\n\nWriter Adam Hochschild described the Paris Gun: “It took about three minutes for each giant shell to cover the distance to the city, climbing to an altitude of 25 miles (40 km) at the top of its trajectory. This was by far the highest point ever reached by a man-made object, so high that gunners, in calculating where the shells would land, had to take into account the rotation of the Earth. For the first time in warfare, deadly projectiles rained down on civilians from the stratosphere.”\n\nBetween 320 to 367 Paris Gun shells were fired during their six-month deployment in France. The shells killed 250 Parisians, wounded another 620 residents, and caused considerable property damage in the French capital.\n\nDeadliest Paris Gun strike? : On March 29, 1918, a Paris Gun shell hit the St-Gervais-et-St-Protais Church causing its roof to collapse, killing 91 and injuring 68 worshippers during a Good Friday service.\n\nIn August 1918, the Allies 100-day offensive forced German troops into a steady retreat. The massive Paris Guns were taken by rail back to Germany. They would never be captured by the Allies. It’s believed the Germans destroyed all the Paris Guns rather than let their supergun technology fall into the hands of the Allies.\n\nTuesday, October 23, 2018 –\n\nAmerican letters from World War I- Thankfully, the memories of U.S. veterans from several wars are archived for all to read through the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress. I wanted to share one touching account recorded by Staff Sgt. Edward J. Bayon who served in the U.S. Army Air Corps in WWI.\n\nAfter the war, Bayon married a French woman and remained in France with the American Graves Registration Service. The Graves Registration Service (See video below) was tasked with the retrieval, identification, transportation, and burial of the American soldiers and American-allied military personnel who died in the war.\n\nIn April 1921, Bayon took on a memorable assignment; To take three barges and float the caskets of hundreds of American soldiers through the rivers and canals of France, Holland, and Belgium. Bayon kept a handwritten journal of his voyage. It was a remarkable trip that revealed the feelings many Europeans had for the deceased U.S. soldiers who died fighting in France and were now making their final journey home. Bayon called his story, “A Thrilling Adventure.” We pick up Bayon’s story here…\n\n“After three barges had been loaded with 952 caskets, I was selected as Chief Convoyer for the trip to Antwerp, Belgium. We left Porte Moselle April 8, 1921 at 4:40 PM towed by horses with a convoyor and poleman or steersman on each barge and the captain and his wife, who cooked our meals, on the leading barge on which I was stationed and which, by the way, was a steam barge but which could not be used until we arrived in the larger canals or rivers. On April 10 we reached Foug and passed through a tunnel which was five kilometers long. At Euville the canal became much larger and we dropped the horses after which the lead barge began towing us with its steam power. On April 11 we stopped for the night at St. Mihiel, where the Americans had fought so gallantly…”\n\nBayon’s trip through France was uneventful if not scenic as the three coffin laden barges poled their way down the Meuse River, the western border of the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne that three years earlier was the site of America’s largest and final victory before Germany’s surrender in the war.\n\n“We left Montcy at 6:30 on April 19 and were now passing through the beautiful Valley of the Meuse. We reached Dame de Meuse at 4:30 PM where the river makes a long sweeping curve with a trestle bridge at its end halfway around the bend. The current takes the three barges in its grasp & threatens to sweep the entire convoy ashore. With the mate on the last barge working frantically with his pole to keep us in the center of the river.”\n\nOn April 21, Bayon and his crew arrived in Belgium where there were no inspections or delays clearing the barges through Belgian Customs. As the barges sailed on Bayon encountered the first real surprise of his adventure.\n\n“April 22 we left Waulsort at 7:30 AM and reach Riviere at 1:30 PM. Up until now not much attention had been paid us but now things began to happen. We had passed unnoticed all through France, the French being inured to War and its terrible results but here the whole town had turned out to meet us with flags and flowers, the Mayor, the Conductor de Ponts et Chausees, school children dressed in their best & the village priest. The Mayor made a short address and flowers and wreaths were placed on the barges which were covered by huge tarpaulins. The word of our passing had gone on ahead and at every village where we had to pass through locks it was a repetition of Riviere. This slowed us down greatly. We reached Namur at 5:30 PM where a beautiful wreath was placed on the leading barge by the Federation National des Combattants de Namur and we tied up here for the night.”\n\nAnd so it would go during the next four days. Belgium had been devastated by Germany’s four-year occupation and intense fighting that left thousands dead and scores of Belgian cities, towns and villages in rubble before American, French and British troops forced a German retreat and surrender. As the three barges made their way across Belgium word spread that the Americans who died in the fighting were coming. On April 24th Bayon and his crew arrived in Liege, Belgium.\n\n“Bugles sounded the Belgium taps as thousands of people lined the banks and bridges over the canal. At the last lock, before the center of town was reached, a Military band boarded the first barge and played dirges soft & low. Everyone was uncovered and many women were kneeling praying and weeping. It was very impressive. At the quai was the governor of Liege, the American Consul and his wife, the commander of the garrison of Liege and many other persons of distinction. The governor made a speech after which I was pushed up on a box to thank the people for theIr kind reception given our dead, in my poor French. The barges were then literally covered with beautiful wreaths and flowers. The band then played the American and Belgium anthems as we proceeded to the next lock with the cavalry still accompanying us. At this lock a repetition of the reception occurred with school children, boys dressed in blue and girls in white lined along the banks with flags.”\n\nSix days later Boyan, his crew and the three barges reached their final destination in Antwerp, Belgium and an end to a story and journey that profoundly touched the former U.S. Army Staff Sergeant.\n\n“On April 30 we left Vorssilaire at 7:00AM and, after going through that maze of waterways and canals that surround Antwerp, we finally pulled into our quay at 3:30 PM—22 days after we had started from Toule, France—where I turned over the three barges and papers into the care of the officer in charge. As long as I live I will never forget this trip and the kindness, courtesy, and thoughtfulness of the Belgium people and the sympathy they exhibited to our American Dead. – Edward J. Bayon”\n\nMonday, October 22, 2018 –\n\nTop-5 World War I movies-\n\nAt least 139 movies, 55 television shows or series, scores of documentaries and hundreds of newsreels have been produced on the Great War. Here’s the oldest, then my five favorite WWI movies:\n\nThe oldest WWI movie dates back to 1917. Director Cecille B. DeMille’s “The Little American.” starred Mary Pickford as an American woman who falls in love with a French and German soldier during WWI. That same year America entered the war against Germany with strong public patriotic fervor. Initially, the Chicago Board of Censors blocked screenings of the silent film in the Windy City. It called the film anti-German and likely to cause a riot. After a legal challenge and jury trial, Artcraft Pictures won the right to show the film in Chicago.\n\nTop-5 WWI Movies:\n\n1. “All Quiet on the Western Front” (dir. Lewis Milestone, 1930)\n\nBased on the 1928 novel by Erich Maria Remarque, this influential anti-war film chronicles the disillusionment of a group of young patriotic recruits amidst the horrific reality of combat.\n\nAfter hearing a professor’s speech about the glory of serving in the German Army several students decide to join the military and “save the Fatherland” in World War I. Soon though, the young men’s patriotic perceptions of war are shattered by their terrible experiences fighting the war. Their war experiences also present a new revelation to the young men: The inability of people back home to comprehend the futility of the war.\n\nIn many respects, “All Quiet on the Western Front” was ahead of its time. Writing for IndieWire, authors Emily Buder and Brandon Latham wrote: “The film’s harsh war imagery and unrelenting cinematography eviscerate the romantic notions of war long before the protest films of the ’70s became a mainstay of war counterculture.”\n\n2. “Wings” (dir. William A. Wellman, 1927)\n\n“Wings” is the most famous silent film about WWI ever made. Its director, William Wellman, was a WWI combat pilot hired by Paramount Pictures to make a realistic Holywood film. He did. The film is notable for its sheer realism and technical air combat sequences.\n\nFilmed over seven months at Kelly Field near San Antonio, Texas, “Wings” went on to win the first-ever Academy Award for Best Picture. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming of the movie. Wellman extensively rehearsed and shot the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over a 10-day period. It used 3,500 extras as infantrymen on a battlefield that was made for the production on location.\n\n“Wing’s upended the movie and social world in 1927 too. It was the only silent film to win an Academy Award that year, and one of the first Hollywood films to feature nudity and a climactic scene of two men kissing.\n\n3. “Paths of Glory” (dir. Stanley Kubrick, 1957)\n\n“Paths of Glory” is one of Director Stanley Kubrick’s best films in the anti-war genre. It stars Kirk Douglas as French officer Colonel Dax whose men refuse to continue a suicidal attack against German trenches and wind up being charged as cowards in a court-martial. Dax, who was a criminal defense lawyer in civilian life, volunteers to defend the men at their court-martial.\n\nThe film exposes viewers to the shell-shocked psychological and physical horrors of war. The anti-war film preceded America’s own Vietnam generation, many who opposed that war. “Paths of Glory” also solidified Douglas’ standing as one of his generation’s premiere action stars.\n\n4. “Gallipoli” (dir. Peter Weir, 1981)\n\nWhen I saw this film at age 25, I had no idea of Australia’s important role and great sacrifices in WWI. Young Australians who fought in WWI are the subject of Peter Weir’s epic account of that part of WWI that was fought in the Ottoman Empire (modern-day Turkey.)\n\n“Gallipoli” put a spotlight on a young Mel Gibson who had a leading role in the film that so keenly illustrates the shock of war and loss of innocence for thousands of Aussie soldiers who fought in the Anzac battlefield at Gallipoli and took part in the futile attack at the Battle of the Nek in August 1915.\n\n5. “Sergeant York” (dir. Howard Hanks, 1941)\n\n“Sergeant York” is a biographical film about the life of Alvin York. One of WWI’s most decorated American soldiers, York initially sought “conscientious objector” status when he was drafted into the war.\n\nThe film was based on the diary of Sergeant Alvin York, who previously turned down several proposals to produce a film on his WWI exploits and fascinating early life as a poor young farmer from rural Tennessee.\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks, “Sergeant York” was the highest-grossing film of the year. It helped launch the career of Gary Cooper too who was cast in the film’s title role and won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of York.\n\nSunday, October 21, 2018 –\n\nGeneral Pershing brings hope on his arrival in France- On June 13, 1917, just more than two months after the United States entered World War I, General John J. Pershing arrived in France with his staff. Arriving in Boulogne on the morning of June 13th, and in Paris that afternoon, Pershing’s advance guard of the American Expeditionary Forces received a hero’s welcome.\n\nEven though thousands of Americans were already serving in Allied uniforms, or as medical volunteers, Pershing’s arrival was symbolic proof positive American troops were now engaged in Europe. It was a welcome sign to America’s allies who had been locked in a two-year stand-off with Germany that had cost millions of lives on both sides in the war.\n\nIn Paris, Pershing’s arrival brought thousands of Parisians into the streets, eager to catch a glimpse of the American general who would command U.S. troops fighting the Germans. Cheering crowds of men, women and children tossed flowers to Pershing and his men and rushed by police lines to wish the American newcomers well.\n\nIn his diary, Pershing wrote that he was at a loss to meet the high expectations of the French government and people. Later, in Pershing’s memoir of the war, he noted, “It brought home to us as nothing else could have done a full appreciation of the war-weary state of the nation and stirred within us a deep sense of the responsibility resting upon America.”\n\nPershing’s heralded arrival in France brought with it a mighty, sobering reality for the American commander- The recruitment, training, arming, supply, and deployment of U.S. troops was going to be a huge challenge for America to overcome.\n\nAs author Patrick Gregory noted, “The lists he (Pershing) had drawn up on his way across the Atlantic included an initial requirement of just over 2,500 artillery pieces of various calibers,, yet current projections of manufacture in the U.S. fell lamentably short of such a figure: U.S. foundries would be able to produce just 80 cannons in September and 40 more in October.”\n\nThere were other monumental tasks on the American military’s to-do list: Deepwater ports had to be prepared in southern France for the troop ships that would soon ferry U.S. troops and tons of supplies across the Atlantic Ocean. Field hospitals, dining canteens, and barracks had to be built for the doughboys in France.\n\nRailroad tracks, 900 miles of them, locomotives and railcars had to be put into place to transport U.S. troops and supplies to the Western Front. More than a dozen lumber mills in France worked around the clock supplying the wood railroad ties that supported the steel tracks the U.S. trains ran on during WWI.\n\nSlowly, but steadily, in the months following Pershing’s arrival, the first 14,000 U.S. troops arrived in France. It was the first stream of American men who would see combat in France and would total more than two-million U.S. combat soldiers who were fighting with America’s allies when the war ended in November 1918.\n\nSaturday, October 20, 2018 –\n\nGeneral Pershing’s War Horse- The heroic deeds and sacrifices of many American soldiers who served in World War I have been widely reported on this blog. Men such as Alvin York, Daniel Daly, and Henry Johnson. Interestingly, horses also became heroes during WWI too. One of them was “Kidron,” the war horse ridden by General John J. Pershing, who led the American Expeditionary Forces.\n\nKidron, a striking dark bay horse (pictured in the portrait above) with two white hind socks, captured the imagination of the American people. He was ridden by General Pershing in some of his early military campaigns but became famous during World War I when used mainly as a ceremonial animal.\n\nKidron was seen by millions of Americans in newsreel films and newspaper photos as General Pershing rode him in the WWI victory parade on the Champs in Paris. Later Kidron was Pershing’s mount during the U.S. military’s triumphal parade through the Victory Arch in New York City and the Capitol in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhy did Pershing, who served as a cavalry officer in the U.S. Army, name his horse Kidron? I’m not sure. In biblical times Kidron was the name of a turbulent brook that flowed between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives. Perhaps this bible verse explains Pershing’s reason’s for the name of his beloved horse:\n\nJeremiah 31:40 – “And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, [shall be] holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.”\n\nUnfortunately, most of the horses who served on either side of the fighting in WWI didn’t survive the war. Exact figures are hard to come by, but an estimated 8 million horses died during the four years of war. Horses and mules, powerful and agile, served primarily as transportation for infantry soldiers and for hauling men, supplies, ammunition, and artillery. They were killed by artillery fire, injured by poison gas, exposed to extreme weather, and suffered from skin disorders and disease. In short, their lives were brutal. In 1915, the Aberdeen Daily News estimated the war horse’s average life expectancy on the Western Front was a mere 20 days.\n\nAccording to author Michelle Harper, “Between 1914 and 1918, the United States sent almost one million horses to the European forces, particularly the British. When America entered the war, another 182,000 horses were taken overseas by the American Expeditionary Forces. Only 200 horses returned to the U.S., and 60,000 were killed outright.”\n\nAfter the war, the American Humane Association established a welfare service called the “American Red Star Relief.” It helped bring home and cared for the U.S. Army’s surviving war horses and mules. On October 15, 1921, a plaque commissioned by the American Red Star was unveiled in the War Department. It reads:\n\n“This tablet commemorates the service and sufferings of the 243,135 mules and horses employed by the American Expeditionary Forces overseas during the Great World War, which terminated November 11, 1918, and which resulted in the death of 68,682 of those animals. What they suffered is beyond words to describe.”\n\nClick on the video below to learn more about the American Humane Association’s Red Star Team.\n\nWhat became of General Pershing’s horse “Kidron?” He died at the relatively ripe age of 36 in 1942 at the Front Royal Horse Cemetery in Front Royal, Virginia. His skeletal remains are now part of the research collection of the Division of Mammals in the National Museum of Natural History.\n\nFor more on this topic:\n\nHorse Heroes\n\nThe Real War Horses of America\n\nCorrection: After this story was published I was contacted by William C. Parke who wrote “Pershing did not ride Kidron in either the NY nor the Washington, DC victory parades. To the disappointment of Pershing, Kidron was in quarantine in Newport News, Virginia, for five months after return from France. Your photo of the horse Gen. Pershing rode in NYC parade is evidently not Kidron. Note that Kidron had distinctive high white hair on his rear legs. (Your painting of Pershing just above the parade one shows the white on Kidron’s back legs.)”\n\nParke should know. Much to my delight, he is the grandson of the WWI officer who gifted Kidron to General Pershing.

Click here to search through and see those documents online. I have chosen a few of my favorites below.\n\nFrench “37” in firing position with U.S. troops from a second-line trench in World War I. Photo: National Archives and Records Administration\n\nCorporal B. E. Williams, 142nd Infantry, Company K, 36th Division, 1918 “The squad I was leading had not gone more than 50 meters when Hinie (German troops) sent over 1 big shell and it bursted in the midst of the squad and knocked out 4 of my men so I only had 6 men in the squad when we started over.\n\nI felt like going to the rear but I fought my way through with only one man left I kept firing all time. There was only 6 squads in the company to cover 500 meters but we was strong and brave men when we reached our objective we had captured almost a battalion of the Bosh (Germans). I was afraid that we would never reach our objective with one man alive but we only had 4 killed and two wounded. All it takes is nerve and the 142 Infantry has it. ‘\n\nPigeon Message from Major Whittlesey, Commanding Officer of the “Lost Batallion,” 308th Infantry, 77th Division, 1918 The so-called “Lost Battalion” was actually comprised of 554 men in the U.S. Army’s 77th Division that found themselves surrounded by German forces in the Argonne Forest in October 1918. Roughly 197 men were killed in action. Approximately 150 others went missing or were taken prisoner before the 194 remaining men were rescued.\n\nThey were led by Major Charles White Whittlesey with orders to attack into the Argonne. Unknown to Whittlesey’s men, the Allied units to their left and right had stalled in their attack on German troops, leaving the 308th surrounded by enemy forces. For the next six days, the men of the “Lost Battalion” suffered heavy losses and fought a fierce battle as American forces tried to rescue them.\n\nFood and water were scarce. Ammunition ran low. Communications were a problem too. Every runner dispatched by Whittlesey to get messages to U.S. troops became lost or ran into German patrols. Carrier pigeons became the only way the 308th could communicate with U.S. headquarters. In the pigeon message below you can read Major Whittlesey’s desperate plea for U.S. units to stop firing on his own dug-in troops.\n\nDespite this, the 77th Division troops held their ground until Allied units were able to break through German lines and open an escape route for Major Whittlesey and his men. Whittlesey was later awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nAuthor Kevin Welker described Whittlesey as a modest and sensitive man who was uncomfortable with the attention he received. “His public speaking was limited to praising the enlisted men with whom he served, the common soldier who received little to no recognition for their uncommon bravery. So dedicated was he to his men of the Lost Battalion that Whittlesey left his sick bed to attend the funeral of a private who served under him.” Welker wrote.

Cox, 132nd Machine Gun Battalion, 36th Division, 1918\n\n“There is no words which will thoroughly explain that feeling or sensation which we all had to contend with while amidst the bursting shells and the pitiful cries of our wounded soldiers and in order to make my story brief, I will conclude by saying the following: I feel confident, that if every living human being on earth could spend a few hours under a heavy barrage fire and could witness the barbarous sights on the battle fields, it would mean Peace and Good will on Earth forever.”\n\nThursday, October 18, 2018 –\n\nBattle of the Meuse-Argonne- While producing the documentary “Black Jack Pershing: Love and War,” I spent a year researching this epic 47-day American battle that would grow to include more than a million U.S. soldiers who fought in World War I.\n\n19-years after the war’s end, John J. Pershing, who commanded American troops in WWI, dedicated the American Memorial in Montfaucon, France. Pershing’s remarks make up one of the finest military speeches I’ve heard. Click the video below to hear General Pershing’s words describing the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne and the sacrifices of those Americans who fought in it.\n\nWednesday, October 17, 2018 –\n\nA soldier’s diary- A Texas farm lad of German descent, Hillie Franz served in the 7th Division and fought the Germans in World War I. While serving in France, he found a nearly unused German ledger book and, in spite of his lack of formal education (Franz’s spelling was often phonetic at best), he decided to record his experiences in the book.\n\nIt’s a century-old book that comes alive again in the Library of Congress’ Veterans War Project. Franz saw his first combat during the Meuse-Argonne battle in which more than 1-million U.S. troops forced a German retreat that along with separate French and British offensive drives ended WWI. What Franz’s account lacks in literacy it more than makes up for in capturing the chaos of the infantryman’s life in wartime.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/295533833\n\nTuesday, October 16, 2018-\n\nThe General and his Fallen Soldiers- General John “Black Jack” Pershing commanded more than 2-million American troops who fought in Europe during World War I. The war is now a century old and claimed the lives of more than 53,000 U.S. soldiers who died in combat. Thousands more died from the flu during the war.\n\nNext month marks the 100th anniversary year of the WWI armistice. On November 11, our country will honor the American men and women who died serving in the Great War. As Armistice Day approaches, this video illustrates General Pershing’s insistence during and after WWI that his American soldiers who died would never be forgotten.\n\nMonday, October 15, 2018-\n\nThe draft and America in World War I- On this date 100 years ago more than 1-million American troops were fighting the Germans in the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne. Another 1-million U.S. soldiers were serving elsewhere in Europe. The soldiers’ service was largely the result of a historic effort to enlist millions of American troops in just 18 months time. To this day, I’m still amazed at our country’s ability to expand its military during WWI in an effort that helped our allies end the war against Germany.\n\nAs historian Jon T. Hoffman noted recently, ” By the time the United States entered the war in 1917, the combatants were waging war on a scale never before seen in history. The experience defined a generation and cast a long shadow across the twentieth century.”\n\nA part of that legacy was America’s ability to go from a largely constabulary U.S. military numbering 220,000 soldiers and officers at the beginning of the war to a combat-seasoned military of more than 4-million at the end of 1918.\n\nTo do this President Woodrow Wilson ordered nearly 400,000 National Guardsmen\n\ninto federal service when the U.S. first declared war on Germany in April 1917. American men though were not volunteering in the numbers needed to raise, train, and deploy an army quickly after the United States declared war on Germany. Not enough though to fill the escalating demand for American troops to fight with French and British allies in Europe.\n\nInitially, President Woodrow Wilson and Congress had hoped 1 million men would volunteer for the army. By May only about 73,000 men had signed up to serve in the military. Other more drastic measures were needed and Congress stepped into the picture. The Selective Service Act of 1917 became law. It was America’s first conscription of soldiers since the days of the Civil War.\n\nUnder guidelines set down by the Selective Service Act, all men, ages 21-to-30 were required to register for potential military service. In August 1918, as American troops in Europe were actively engaged in combat against Germany, Congress debated a proposal to expand the Selective Service age range for all men ages 18-to-45. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker went before Congress to testify saying, “There are two ways of fighting this war. One is to make every possible effort and win it soon, and the other is to proceed in a somewhat more leisurely fashion and win it late.” Two weeks later, Congress amended the Selective Service Act making all men between the ages of 18 and 45 subject to the draft. (66, 40 Stat. 955)\n\nThere were actually three Selective Service registrations during WWI.\n\nJune 5, 1917, was for all men between the ages of 21 and 30.\n\nJune 5, 1918, registered those who attained age 21 after June 5, 1917.\n\nSeptember 12, 1918, was for all men ages 18 through 45.\n\nBy the end of World War I, some two million men volunteered for various branches of the armed services, and some 2.8 million had been drafted. This meant more than half of the almost 4.8 million Americans who served in the armed forces were drafted. Due to efforts to instill a patriotic attitude, the World War I draft had been a huge success.\n\nAfter the signing of the November 11, 1918 armistice, the activities of the Selective Service System quickly waned. In March 1919, all local, district, and medical advisory boards were closed. In May 1919, the last state headquarters closed operations. By July of that year, the Provost Marshal General was relieved from duty, thereby finally terminating the activities of the Selective Service System of World War I.\n\nThe U.S. reinstated the draft leading up to World War II. The military draft remained from the Cold War’s beginning in 1948 through the Vietnam War before it was ended as part of the Nixon administration’s effort to end the war in 1973. Today, American men are still legally required to register with the Selective Service within 30 days of their 18th birthday. All men, ages 18-to- 25 must be registered despite the fact that a draft hasn’t occurred in over 45 years.\n\nSunday, October 14, 2018-\n\nAmerican air power in the Meuse-Argonne- On this date 100 years ago the American Expeditionary Forces were locked in a bitter 47-day battle with dug-in German positions between France’s Argonne Forest and Meuse River.\n\nThe Battle of the Meuse-Argonne was the most important American military contribution to the Allied effort during the Great War. It was also the largest, costliest military operation in American history. More than a million American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines, fought with 135,000 French soldiers in the battle.\n\nAs historian Richard S. Faulkner noted in this detailed history of the battle, “Although the First Army had committed to this battle long before most of its doughboys had mastered the skills required to fight a mass industrialized war, the Americans persevered and gradually ground down the German units opposing them. Unfortunately, this approach came at a high price: 26,277 men killed and another 95,786 wounded as the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) learned how to wage a modern war against a skilled opponent.”\n\nPoorly trained American recruits, logistical breakdowns, cold, wet weather conditions, dense, broken terrain, severely hampered the American doughboys and their infantry units who fought on the ground during the battle. Eventually, the U.S. and French troops routed the Germans after 47 days of fighting and helped force Germany’s surrender on November 11, 1918.\n\nThe Meuse-Argonne also posed challenges and problems for America’s fledgling air squadrons. General Billy Mitchell, regarded as the father of the U.S. Air Force, initially hoped to rule the skies above the Meuse-Argonne battlefield and provide air support to the American and French troops fighting the Germans on the ground below.\n\nAt the battle’s start on September 26, 1918, the French reassigned many of its the pilots expected to fly with American pilots. This meant 75 percent of Mitchell’s planes were flown by American pilots – many of them novices with little, if any, combat experience.\n\nMechanical problems grounded another 20 percent of Mitchell’s planes, leaving just 670 trusted aircraft for the battle. Throughout the campaign, poor weather and rugged terrain further hampered air operations. American air observers had just 10 days of weather clear enough to accurately spot or target German troops during the 47-day Meuse-Argonne battle. “This meant,” wrote Faulkner “Mitchell’s decision to focus most of the American air operations against targets in the enemy’s rear area met with only limited success and drew the ire of many American soldiers. Although the airmen had some success in air interdiction, they could not prevent German air attacks on American ground forces.”\n\nAmerican pilots did play a role in America’s largest battle. In 10 missions flown between September 12 and 29, 1918 over the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne sectors, 2nd Lieutenant Frank Luke Jr. shot down 14 German observation balloons and four enemy airplanes.\n\nBecause German observation balloons were heavily defended, thus dangerous to destroy, Luke’s accomplishments were no mean feat. On his last mission, Luke shot down three balloons near Dun-sur-Meuse, France before he was wounded and his plane forced down behind enemy lines. After landing, Luke reportedly used his pistol to hold off German troops who tried to take him prisoner before dying from his wound. For his skills and bravery, Luke became the first American aviator to win the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nCaptain Eddie Rickenbacker, commander of the 94th Aero Squadron, shot down five German balloons and 10 airplanes during his flights over the Meuse-Argonne. His twenty-six total kills in WWI made him the highest-scoring American ace of the war.\n\nThe United States Army did not begin operating an independent air service until April 1918, beginning with just three squadrons for use in the front lines of Europe. By the time of the November 1918, armistice, 45 American squadrons, consisting of 740 planes, were operating. A total of 7,726 officers and 70,769 men served in the U.S. Army air service.\n\nSaturday, October 13, 2018-\n\nPart 2- World War I: The Commanders – Who are the men who led an estimated 65 million soldiers in battle on land and sea in World War I? In part 2 we profile the last four of the eight World War I generals who played a key role in the fighting along Europe’s Western Front and who played key roles in the outcome of the war that would have a major influence on 20th-century history.\n\nGeneral John J. “Black Jack” Pershing rose to global view as commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in World War I. While Europe entered one of the world’s most deadly wars in 1914, the United States didn’t join the conflict until 1917 when Pershing and his command staff sailed for France and were immediately challenged by the sheer logistics of recruiting, training, transporting and sending into combat what would ultimately be a fighting force of more than 2-million troops in Europe.\n\nGeneral Pershing also faced growing demands by allies France and Britain to “amalgamate” or lend American soldiers to the European allies who were exhausted after from three years of costly fighting on the Western Front. Knowing American troops needed all the time they could get to train for combat against the veteran German army, Pershing refused to place his Doughboys under the command of America’s allies until faced with the do-or-die German Spring Offensive of 1918. That summer, Pershing placed all of America’s fighting resources at the disposal of French Marshal Ferdinand Foch until the Allies stopped the German advance and began their own war-ending offensive.\n\nThe AEF participated in numerous important battles such as the Battle of Cantigny, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, and the Battle of St. Mihiel. Pershing was criticized for operational and logistic errors that initially resulted in high casualty rates for the American troops fighting in Europe. Some historians have noted though that French, British and German troops suffered similar casualty rates when they first entered combat in 1914.\n\nAfter 42 days of bitter fighting in the Battle of the Meuse-Argonne, Pershing’s troops succeeded in cutting the Germans’ lines at Sedan, France on November 6, 1918. Five days later, on November 11, 1918, World War I ended through the combined efforts of the AEF and the European allies. General Pershing and his men were celebrated as heroes who bolstered the spirits of European allies, helped turned the battle tide against Germany, and ushered America onto a global stage as a newly established superpower.\n\nAfter the war, Congress promoted Pershing to the rank of “General of the Armies of the United States.” He and George Washington are the only two people who have received this honor. In 1921, Pershing and several of the Allied commanders from WWI gathered in Kansas City to dedicate the WWI monument. Watch it on the video below.\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/282628653\n\nDouglas Haig was Commander in Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from late 1915, when he replaced John French, until the end of the war in 1918. Field Marshal Haig is remembered as the general who led the British forces in the 1917 Battle of the Somme and Battle of Passchendaele one year later. Both battles resulted in heavy casualties for the British army.\n\nMost historians agree Haig’s contributions to the Allied victory over Germany is undeniable, but even a century after the war he has remained a subject of controversy. The Canadian War Museum comments, “His epic but costly offensives at the Somme (1916) and Passchendaele (1917) have become nearly synonymous with the carnage and futility of First World War battles.”\n\nConversely, Haig led the BEF during the final Hundred Days Offensive of WWI when it decisively crossed the Canal du Nord and broke through the Hindenburg line capturing 195,000 German prisoners. This campaign contributed to the war’s end on November 11th, 1918 and is considered by some historians to be one of the greatest victories by a British-led army.\n\nWhile some held Haig responsible for the worst human loses in British history, others emphasized that he was above all a man of his time and that Britain’s high casualties during WWI simply reflected the military reality of the time.\n\nWhen Paul von Hindenburg was recalled to military service and named commander of the German Eighth Army in August 1914, he faced the advancing Russian First and Second armies on World War I’s Eastern Front who held an overwhelming numerical superiority. After defeating Russia’s Second Army in the Battle of Tannenberg and its First Army in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, Hindenburg pushed the Russians out of East Prussia. The defeat struck a blow to Russian morale and may have been a key factor that sparked the Russian Revolution of 1917.\n\nIn August 1916 Hindenburg was named Germany’s Chief of the General Staff. His popularity in Germany rose to the point of a personality cult. German Kaiser Wilhelm II increasingly delegated his power to the German high command, allowing Hindenburg and deputy Erich Ludendorff to dominate German military policymaking for the rest of the war. When von Hindenburg called the entire German corps from the Western Front to confront the advancing Russians along the war’s Eastern Front weakened German positions in France.\n\nAfter Germany’s 1918 defeat in WWI, Hindenburg retired from the military. In 1925, due in part to Hindenburg’s status as a war hero, he was elected Germany’s president. The BBC noted that Hindenburg’s deflationist policies aggravated Germany’s post-war economic difficulties. Domestic unrest mounted and gave rise to the Nazis party in Germany.\n\nHindenburg was re-elected president in 1932, even as many of his supporters thought the Nazis as a useful – albeit unpleasant – group, worth accommodating. Adolf Hitler insisted on becoming German chancellor in any government in which the Nazi party participated but Hindenburg refused to appoint him. In late 1932, an agreement was reached to form a German government with Hitler as chancellor. Hitler quickly secured almost unlimited political power through terror and manipulations. Hitler was publicly respectful to Hindenburg, who remained in office until his death in August of 1934.\n\nMarshal of France Ferdinand Foch played a crucial role in checking the Germans at the beginning of World War I. In September 1914, he was the key actor in the German defeat at the First Battle of Marne. It effectively ended all German hopes of a quick military victory on the Western Front.\n\nAfter the failed offensive at Ypres in 1915 and huge casualties in the Battle of the Somme one year later, Foch was dismissed but returned as Chief of the French General Staff in 1917.\n\nOn March 21, 1918, the British front in Picardy collapsed under the impact of Germany’s Spring Offensive. By March 24, British commander Field Marshal Douglas Haig was thinking about his embarkation ports in France, and French commander General Philippe Pétain was thinking about defending Paris. The Encyclopedia Britannica noted “The severance of the two armies (French and British) had begun. The Germans, who quickly perceived the situation, were already crying victory.”\n\nBy early May 1918, Foch was made commander in chief of all Allied armies on the Western and Italian fronts. It included the rapidly growing American Expeditionary Forces who were now pouring thousands of U.S. troops into the war on a daily basis. In 1918, Foch was appointed Commander in Chief of the Allied Armies.\n\nAfter repulsing the 1918 German Spring Offensive, Foch co-created the so-called Hundred Days Offensive, a combined attack by American, French and British Commonwealth troops that forced a German surrender in November of 1918.\n\nFriday, October 12, 2018-\n\nPart 1- World War I: The Commanders – Who are the men who led an estimated 65 million soldiers in battle on land and sea in World War I? In part 1 we profile four of the eight World War I generals who played a key role in the fighting along Europe’s Western Front and who played key roles in the outcome of the war that would have a major influence on 20th-century history.\n\nGerman General Erich Ludendorff drew broad acclaim as a key commander in Germany’s 1914 victory over the Russians at Tannenberg on the Eastern Front. Many historians say the Russian defeat helped spark the Russian Revolution and Russia’s withdrawal from the war in March 1917.\n\nOn the Western Front, Ludendorff was less successful. The German defeat in the First Battle of Marne made a mockery of Ludendorff’s “Schlieffen Plan” which called for a quick German victory in the west but instead turned into a stalled offensive.\n\nOn the other hand, Ludendorff, his staff and field officers developed the first modern defensive warfare doctrine for the era of machine guns and artillery.\n\nAuthor Williamson Murray noted that Ludendorff’s “new doctrine rested on the concept of holding frontline positions lightly with machine gunners, with successively stronger defensive positions echeloned in depth. By now artillery was the great killer on the Western Front, so Ludendorff concentrated German reserves and defensive positions in rear areas, out of range of all but the heaviest Allied guns.”\n\nIn 1917, Ludendorff ordered unrestricted submarine warfare against Britain in a failed effort to break the Allied naval blockade of Germany. Ludendorff’s unrestricted submarine warfare, which included the sinking of the passenger ship “Lusitania” only provoked America’s entry into the war.\n\nIn March 1918, Ludendorff launched a full-scale “Spring Offensive” on the Western Front in an attempt to defeat French and British and force an Allied surrender before more American troops could arrive in France and give the Allies a numerical troop advantage in the war. After driving to within 60 miles of Paris, the German offensive met Allied resistance, ran low on supplies and soon found themselves in defensive positions.\n\nAfter the Second Battle of the Marne, Ludendorff privately admitted the war was lost for Germany. An October 1, 1918 diary entry by German Officer Albrecht von Thaer noted General Ludendorff’s comments to his command officers:\n\n“Thus it was foreseeable that the enemy, assisted by the Americans who are eager to fight, would achieve a great victory, a very large, important breakthrough. Then the army in the west would lose its last foothold and flood back over the Rhine in complete dissolution, carrying with it the revolution to Germany. He (Ludendorff) had never shied away from demanding the utmost of his troops. But now that it had become clear to him that the continuation of the war served no purpose, he was of the opinion that it should be ended as quickly as possible, in order to avoid unnecessarily sacrificing the bravest ones, who are still loyal and able to fight.”\n\nOn October 26, 1918, Ludendorff resigned two weeks before Germany’s official surrender in WWI.\n\nAustralian General John Monash was an important Allied commander and architect of the Battle of Amiens which opened the final phase of World War I.\n\nAn engineer by education, Monash led the Australian 4th Brigade during the 1915-16 Gallipoli campaign in Turkey. While the Allies failed to force open a strategic naval sea route to Russia in the Mediterranean, Monash was appointed commander of the newly formed Australian 3rd Division in France.\n\nFollowing the success at the Battle of Messines in 1917, he was promoted to lieutenant general. Shortly afterward, Monash replaced General William Birdwood as commander of the Australian Corps and led his troops in a series of combat victories in the final phase of the war.\n\nSydney Morning Herald Reporter Peter FitzSimons described Monash’s planning for the Australian WWI attack in the Battle of Amiens on highly fortified German troops:\n\n“To begin with, while mathematics had never featured large in the studies pursued by most Generals, for Monash the discipline has been the foundation stone of his engineering career, which is as well, because this logistical exercise is an enormous one, as his pen continues to fly. In this case, he must organise 8000 men, 5000 tons of artillery ammunition – borne in 3000 wagon trips – to move together with several dozen tanks and all come together at much the same place, at much the same time, all without the enemy being aware that anything is different from usual.”\n\nFrom August 8th until the Australian Corps left the battleline in October, the Australian Corps saw almost continuous combat as it helped the spearhead of British Expeditionary Force’s advance to victory in the war. In contrast to most of his Allied and Central Powers’ command counterparts, Monash was also effective in developing combat strategies that minimized casualties to the troops he commanded.\n\nSpanish-born Armando Diaz was Italian General and Marshal of Italy in WWI. He was noted for leading Italian troops that halted the Austro-Hungarian offensive in 1917 and later leading a decisive counter-offensive which led to victory over Austro-Hungarian troops.\n\nInitially a major-general under Luigi Cadorna, Diaz was promoted to Italian Corps commander after the disastrous 1917 Battle of Caporetto. Diaz replaced Cadorna as Chief of Staff of the Italian Army and managed to stop the Austro-Hungarian advance along the Piave River.\n\nIn June 1918, Diaz led Italian forces to a major victory in the Battle of the Piave River. His victory in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto effectively ended the war’s fighting on the Italian Front.\n\nPhilippe Petain of France was considered one of WWI’s greatest generals. Hailed as a national hero, he helped command French troops that turned back the German attack on the 1916 Battle of Verdun. Fought from February 21 to December 18, 1916, the was the largest and longest battle of the First World War on the Western Front between the German and French armies.\n\nA 1964 New York Times article described Petain’s role in the pivotal WWI battle.\n\n“The man who organized the defenses, strengthened the strongpoints, mobilized almost every cannon in the French Army and stood beside the single supply road, “the sacred way,” watching with compassion in his icy blue eyes as men strode up to the front and stumbled back a few days later—this man became the greatest of heroes, “the champion of France,” as Paul Valery, the poet, was later to hail him.”\n\nA year later, Petain was French Commander in Chief in a short stint in which he helped improve discipline and raise morale among French troops which helped them withstand and fend off Germany’s massive “Spring Offensive” in 1918.\n\nPetain’s glorious achievements in WWI were a dramatic contrast to his trial for treason after the end of World War II. He was sentenced to death for leading so-called Vichy France in WWII and collaborating with the Germans. Because of his age, Petain’s death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nIn tomorrow’s Part 2 of “World War I: The Commanders,” we will profile America’s John Pershing, Britain’s Douglas Haig, Germany’s Paul Von Hindenburg, and Ferdinand Foch of France.\n\nThursday, October 11, 2018-\n\nWorld War I: Theaters of War – Most Americans might be surprised to learn there were many fronts in which WWI combatants fought. Most of America’s fighting in the war took place on the Western Front, but the Great War included several other theaters of war.\n\nWestern Front- When the German army charged across the Belgian border in August 1914, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Germans troops quickly drove through Belgium and soon entered France. As the British and French armies fought to stop Germany’s advance a battle stand-off soon ensued. The Germans began digging defensive trenches. When British and French troops failed to break through the German trench lines they began digging their own network of trench lines. Hundreds of miles of trenches soon snaked across France. During WWI, neither side gained more than a few miles of ground along what became known as the Western Front.\n\nEastern Front- Fighting in Eastern Europe between Russia and Germany and German ally Austria-Hungary created what is called the war’s “Eastern Front.” The Eastern front erupted into fighting when Russia invaded East Prussia in August 1914. Germany soon launched a counter-offensive with hundreds of thousands of its troops and pushed Russia back. The attacks and counter-attacks went back and forth for WWI’s first two years with territory frequently changing hands as land was captured only to be surrendered by both sides along the Eastern Front.\n\nBy 1917, the Russian people were weary and demoralized by the huge number of Russian losses of more than 3.3-million military and civilian deaths suffered by the Russian Empire. The Russian government and monarchy were overthrown. The new Bolshevik government signed the treaty of Brest Litovsk with Germany.\n\nWith the Russians out of the war, Germany sent some 700,000 troops from the Eastern Front to join the fighting on the Western Front.\n\nItalian Front- Before WWI erupted in 1914, Italy had traditionally aligned itself with Germany and Austria-Hungary. After initially declaring neutrality in the war, Italy, tempted by offers of more land once the war was won, joined the fighting in April 1915 on the side of the Allies.\n\nThe Italian front is the name given to the fighting that took place along the Italian/Austrian border. The Italians did advance a short way into Austria with some of the heaviest fighting taking place between 1915 and 1917 along the Isonzo river. After their defeat at the 1917 Battle of Caporetto, the Italians were pushed back. Though the Italians managed to harden their defensives, by late 1917 the Germans and Austrians had driven them back to just 18 miles north of Venice.\n\nItalian casualties at Caporetto totaled almost 700,000: 40,000 killed or wounded, 280,000 captured by the enemy and another 350,000 deserted. In the wake of the battle, violent anti-war protests forced Italian Commander Luigi Cadorna forced to resign. General Armando Diaz commanded a new Italian defensive strategy that lasted until the end of the war and drew in the resources of stronger Allied powers which included U.S. troops.\n\nGallipoli- The Gallipoli Peninsula is located in southern Turkey. In 1915, British forces, with French navy support, launched an ambitious amphibious assault on the peninsula.\n\nHad they succeeded in capturing the peninsula, Allied naval forces could have sailed through the Dardanelles Strait, into the Sea of Marmara and attacked the Ottoman Empire’s capital of Istanbul.\n\nTurkish troops kept the Allied troops at bay and after months of fighting, the Allies retreated. The entire mission was an Allied failure. More than 50,000 Allied troops were lost with hardly any land gained by the fighting.\n\nHeavy participation of volunteers from Australia and New Zealand (Anzac troops) in the campaign makes it an iconic moment in those nations’ military histories even as the Turkish victory is celebrated in that country.\n\nThe War at Sea- Even before hostilities began, Germany and Britain competed in a high stakes naval race for mastery of the seas. Britain had a long tradition of being the master of the seas. Germany knew it was unlikely to win a naval war against Britain’s mighty naval fleet and tended to avoid open naval conflict with Britain on the surface of the ocean.\n\nThe 1916 Battle of Jutland was the largest naval battle of the First World War and involved 250 British and German combat ships. It saw the British Navy losing more men and ships but remained a powerful tool while it left the German Navy too diminished to put to sea again while the war lasted. 8,500 sailors, the majority of them British, died in the 36-hour battle.\n\nBritain’s main naval tactic was to keep German ships from leaving their German ports and to block supplies from reaching Germany. Germany’s main naval tactic was to strategically post u-boats in the Atlantic ocean and Allied merchant and naval ships taking supplies, weapons, and troops from America and other countries to Britain and France.\n\nOn 7th May 1915, the passenger liner Lusitania was torpedoed by a German submarine. Nearly 1,200 innocent civilians lost their lives of which 128 were American. The Lusitania attack was a major impetus for America’s declaration of war against Germany in April 1917.\n\nThe Balkan Front– The spark that ignited World War One was struck in the Balkans. Bosnian-Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife in Sarajevo, Bosnia, lighting a fuse to the powder keg drew 32 countries into the fighting. Even so, the fighting in the Balkans region of Southeast Europe is still not well-known today.\n\nIn July 1914 Austria-Hungary declared war against Serbia and started shelling its capital of Belgrade. In late 1914, Austrians troops launched three offensives against the Serbs, forcing a Serb retreat from Belgrade. By the end of 1914, the Serbs counter-attacked and had pushed the Austrians back into their own territory.\n\nIn late 1915, Germany convinced Bulgaria to enter the war. The Bulgarian, German, and Austro-Hungarian armies launched a major offensive against the Serbs. The Great Serbian Retreat began. The remnants of the entire Serbian Army, the Serb King and many civilians retreated over the Albanian mountains in the dead of winter. The victorious Central Powers occupied Serbia, but the Serbian Army still existed.\n\nIn September 1918, a combined Allied Army of French, British, Greek units and the Serbian Army attacked north from Greece. The Bulgarians were quickly thrown back and sued for peace. The Allies pushed German and Austro-Hungarian troops into a steady retreat until Serbia was liberated in October. The Allies were preparing to invade Hungary when the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.\n\nSerbia lost 275,000 soldiers killed and 130,000 wounded. 150,000 civilians were killed in the fighting. Including deaths from famine and disease, the Serbians lost 16% of their population in WWI. Greece lost 26,000 soldiers killed and 21,000 wounded. Casualty figures for Germany, Austria and Bulganian troops fighting in the Balkans were not broken down by which front they occurred in, so remain unknown for fighting in the Balkans.\n\nAccording to the Centre Européen’s Robert Schuman, the total number of military and civilian casualties in World War I was around 40 million. There were 20 million deaths and 21 million wounded. The total number of deaths includes 9.7 million military personnel and about 10 million civilians.\n\n(Sources: WWI Theaters of War, History on the Net, The Telegraph, Imperial War Museum)\n\nWednesday, October 10, 2018-\n\nWorld War I: An old poem and new film bring WWI alive again.\n\n“They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning,\n\nWe will remember them.”\n\n― Laurence Binyon, poet, author\n\nThose words about the soldiers who died fighting in WWI a century ago form the title of a soon-to-be-released film by Academy Award-winning director Peter Jackson. Jackson directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Now he has turned black and white film from the archives of Great Britain’s Imperial War Museum into color and brought new life to the faces of WWI soldiers in his latest the film “They Shall Not Grow Old.”\n\nThe film opens In European theaters October 16th. The video below gives us a great sense of the soon-to-be-released film.\n\nNo North American release dates for “They Shall Not Grow Old” have been set as of this writing.\n\nIt begs the question: “Why have no American movie directors (Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ridley Scott, Ron Howard, etc) taken a stab at the rich trove of U.S. films that captured American soldiers in battle during WWI?”\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration has thousands of WWI photos like the one above and hundreds of WWI films that could rival Peter Jackson’s film. Imagine what archival films like the one below would look like if colorized with added sound that includes the voices of the men who fought the war?\n\nWhat a gift that could be for Americans. It could mean reaching millions of Americans with a new opportunity to learn how important WWI was in our nation’s history. Thankfully, the National Archives staff have engaged in a dedicated multiyear effort to restore and digitize films like the one above for Americans to view. They were filmed originally by units from the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nRegrettably, with the 100th anniversary of the WWI armistice next month, the timely opportunity for an American restoration and colorization effort, which typically take years to produce, may have already passed. In the video below, Peter Jackson explains the impetus behind his decision to produce “They Shall Not Grow Old”\n\nTuesday, October 9, 2018-\n\nWorld War I: The Forgotten War – Or so say many historians and researchers of the so-called “Great War.” If you ask most Americans what they know about World War I, they probably can’t tell you much about it. WWI was fought a century ago. It has since been overshadowed by World War II, The Korean War, Vietnam War and Gulf Wars I and II.\n\nThankfully, as America approaches the 100th anniversary of the WWI armistice on November 11th, the media spotlight has turned, however briefly, on our country’s first large-scale war fought on soil other than our own. It’s a new opportunity to learn about something "
