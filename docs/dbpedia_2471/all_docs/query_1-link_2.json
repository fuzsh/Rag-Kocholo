        "text": "Croix de Guerre, (French: “War Cross”), French military decoration created in 1915 and 1939 to reward feats of bravery, either by individuals or groups, in the course of the two World Wars. This medal may be conferred on any member of the armed forces, on French citizens and foreigners who have been mentioned in army dispatches, and, in special cases, on military units and towns. During World War II there was a proliferation of different conflicting medals. Marshal Philippe Pétain of the Vichy government issued a Croix de Guerre in 1941 and General Henri Giraud of the Free French Forces in North Africa issued a Croix in 1943. By the order (Jan. 7, 1944) of the French National Committee of Liberation, the Croix de Guerre instituted in 1939 was declared to be the only one valid for World War II.\n\nThere are different grades of the Croix which correspond to the level of army (or navy) dispatch that mentions the feat of valour being rewarded. A bronze palm is awarded with the Croix for mention in an army dispatch, a silver gilt star is awarded with the Croix for an army corps dispatch, a silver star for a divisional dispatch, and a bronze star for a brigade or regimental dispatch. A warship cited in a dispatch and receiving the decoration may fly a pennant with the colours of the Croix.\n\nThe Croix design is a large Maltese Cross in bronze with crossed swords; one side of the medal depicts the female head of the Republic with the inscription République Française. The other side has 1914–1918 or 1939–1945 (occasionally just 1939) inscribed on it.\n\nA Croix de Guerre des Théâtres d’Opérations Extérieures (“War Cross of Foreign Theatres of Operation”) was created in 1921 to reward colonial forces serving during peacetime in foreign lands—i.e., Morocco, Algeria, Indochina, etc."
