        "text": "THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nWith the declaration of the Third Republic, on September 4, 1870, a complete and decided change was made in the Étoile de la Légion d'Honneur. By a decree of the 8th of November, 1870, the Government of the National Defence ordered that the Imperial crown above the cross be replaced by a wreath of oak and laurel leaves. The effigy of Napoleon I in the centre medallion was replaced by a laurel-crowned female head facing to the right, typifying the Republic. It is surrounded by the inscription REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE 1870. The reverse has two tri-colours tied at the staffs, and surrounded by HONNEUR ET PATRIE and two branches of laurel on a blue enamelled band. In the Commander's cross of this period several red holly berries are to be seen on each wreath. A variant of this cross occurred in a sale in Paris during 1914, showing a crown instead of the wreath above. There seems to be no authority for these variants, and it is to be assumed that they are merely the result of the maker's idea or his carelessness as to details.\n\nAs at the beginning, the ribbon today is the bright red moiré decreed by the first Napoleon , who is said to have won many faithful followers by his lavish distribution of the \"eagle\" and the red ribbon. As Pliny the elder wrote (Lib. IV, cap. xi, 24) \"It requires lemon as well as sugar to make punch.\" So with the principal decoration of France . The ribbon together with the cross is needed to perfect the attractiveness of the Légion d'Honneur. The brilliancy of the ribbon, the whiteness of the enamelled cross and the blue band of the medallion, blend into a harmonious whole, whose elements are those of the flag of the nation. One might go further and see in the green wreath a suggestion of the colouring of their well kept fields and vineyards, and in the oak the strong spirited loyalty to their land.\n\nDAMES DE LA LÉGION D'HONNEUR. Napoleon I established three Schools for the orphans of the Légionnaires as early as 1805. These were at Saint-Denis, Écouen and Les Loges. The direction thereof was under the Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, but the Chapels and the Educational management were under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of the diocese.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XVII\n\nLégion d'Honneur Third Republic\n\nSome writers record that as early as 1809 Napoleon intended to establish a special form of Decoration for the women in charge of the Maisons d'Éducation de la Légion d'Honneur. Nothing seems to have been accomplished, however, and it was not until 1816 that a Decoration was created by Louis XVIII. This consists of a white enamelled cross pattée surmounted by a Royal Crown. In the angles of the cross are fleurs-de-lis. On the obverse centre in an oval medallion is a gold figure of the Virgin on a blue field, surrounded by the words MAISON ROYALE DE ST. DENIS. On the reverse centre of blue are three gold fleurs-de-lis surrounded by the inscription DIEU LE ROI LA PATRIE. The ribbon is white moiré with red bands. The decorations of the first class are of gold and were for the nuns and higher teachers. The second class, of silver, was for the novices.\n\nIn 1857, under Napoleon III , the decoration was changed. Between the arms of the cross are rays instead of the earlier fleurs-de-lis. The inscription on the obverse reads MAISON DE ST. DENIS. The reverse medallion has in its centre the words HONNEUR ET PATRIE surrounded by the inscription LEGION D'HONNEUR on a white enamelled band. The ribbon was changed to red moiré.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XVIII\n\nDames de la Légion d'Honneur\n\nIn 1881 the decoration was changed to a cross with five branches instead of four. The cross is surmounted by the Palmes d'Académie. The medallion in the centre is circular and bears on the obverse in gold letters, the words LEGION D'HONNEUR. It is surrounded by a band inscribed MAISON D'EDUCATION. On the reverse is the motto HONNEUR ET PATRIE in gold letters on a blue field. The ribbon is also red moiré.\n\nThere is also a Médaille d'Honneur which is for lesser distinction. It is oval in form, bearing in the centre the Cross of the Légion d'Honneur. Above it, the motto HONNEUR ET PATRIE appears—below, MEDAILLE D'HONNEUR. It is surmounted by a suspension ring.\n\nORDRE DE LA COURONNE DE FER. Instituted by Napoleon I on June 5, 1805, after he had been crowned at Milan as King of Italy . It was given to those who had rendered service to the Crown whether in the Army, in the Administration, or in Arts and Letters. The insignia consists of the crown of Lombardy of blue enamelled gold; it has ten ball-tipped points and ten flowers and jewels above the head band. Within the crown on a thunder-bolt is the Imperial eagle, facing to the left. Superimposed on the crown in a medallion is the effigy of Napoleon I , facing to the left, with the Imperial crown and a laurel wreath (green enamel) upon the head. The inscription on the band reads DIO ME LA DIEDE GUAIA CHI LA TOCCA (God gave it to me, Let him who touches it beware.) The ribbon is yellow moiré with a narrow green edging.\n\nThis Order was evidently given to French citizens, as the author has a plaque with the inscription in French. Variants show the head of Napoleon facing to the right. After the fall of the French Empire and the annexation of Lombardy by Austria , the Emperor, Francis I, reconstituted the Order in 1815, but with an Austria n eagle and of course a different crown. This was known as the Austria n Order of the Iron Crown.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XIX\n\nOrdre de la Couronne de Fer\n\nORDRE DES TROIS TOISONS D'OR. This Order was projected by Napoleon I and his plans for it were announced on August 15, 1809, at the camp of Schönbrunn. There seems to have been no decoration definitely established. The authorities on the subject give no description, and the Order probably never went beyond the initial stages. Specimens of the decoration of the Order of the Three Golden Fleeces are sometimes seen, but their appearance is such as to make their genuineness doubtful.\n\nPALMES UNIVERSITAIRES. When the University of France was created on March 17, 1808, three honorary titles were established—Dignitaries, Officers of the University and Officers of the Academy. At first, the emblems of their distinction, the Palmes Universitaires, were embroidered on the coat. Later, silver enamelled palm and laurel branches were adopted, to be suspended by a violet moiré ribbon, and this procedure has continued ever since.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XX\n\nPalmes Universitaires\n\nORDRE DE LA RÉUNION. Founded by Napoleon I in October, 1811, to replace a similar order of Holland when that country was annexed. The decoration is in the form of a white enamelled star with twelve ball-tipped points. This star is superimposed on a gold disc formed by thirty arrows in bundles of five—the arrows representing the thirty Departments of Italy which had been annexed at the same time. The heads of the arrows occupy six of the spaces between the points of the star, while the butts fill the other (upper) six; the whole having the effect of a sun-burst. On the gold band at either side of the point of suspension appears the motto A JAMAIS. On the obverse medallion is a throne surmounted by an eagle holding in one claw nine arrows, to represent the Provinces of Holland; in the other he holds a trident, to signify the ports of Genoa and Hamburg . On one side of the throne appears the lion of Holland; on the other, the lion of Florence , and at the base of the throne is the she-wolf of Rome , showing quite clearly the figures of Romulus and Remus. Around this appears the motto TOUT POUR VEMPIRE on a blue enamelled band. The reverse shows N within a laurel wreath, and A JAMAIS on a blue band surrounding it. The words are repeated on both sides on the outer band. Above this star is the Imperial crown, with the words NAPOLEON FONDATEUR on the blue head band. A gold cross is within the suspension ring. The ribbon is light blue with lateral bands of white. This Order was suppressed in 1815 after only four years of existence.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXI\n\nOrdre de la Réunion\n\nSeveral other Orders created under the Napoleonic influence should be mentioned at this juncture.\n\nORDRE DE L'UNION DE HOLLANDE. Created by Louis Bonaparte (1778–1846) in 1806. After passing through several modifications, its name was changed in 1807 to the Ordre Royal de l'Union de Hollande. The cross is an eight-pointed gold star, white enamelled and with ball-tipped points. Gold bees are in the angles and a gold crown surmounts it. On the obverse appears the effigy of the King, surrounded by the words LODWIJK NAP. DE Ia KONING VANJIOLLAND. The reverse has the lion of the Netherlands , and the legend DOE WEL EN ZIE NIET OM (Do well and look not around). The ribbon is light blue moiré. This Order was abolished in 1810, and those who had been favoured with the decoration were given that of the Order of the Reunion of France , created by Napoleon I in 1811.\n\nMÉDAILLE D'HONNEUR DE HOLLANDE. This medal was authorized on July 18, 1808, by Louis Bonaparte—or Louis Napoleon, as he is frequently called. The object of this was to reward acts of bravery. It was issued in two classes, gold and silver. The medal is 45 mm. in diameter. Around the sides are laurel wreaths. In the centre of the obverse is engraved BELONING VAN UIT-MUNTENDE DAPPERHEID, 14 SEPT. 1809 (Reward for Distinguished Bravery). On the reverse is engraved LODEWIK NAP. DE Ia KONING VAN HOLLAND AAN— (the name of the recipient). The ribbon for this is light blue.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXII\n\nOrdre Royal des Deux Siciles\n\nORDRE ROYAL DES DEUX SICILES. Founded by Joseph Bonaparte (1768–1844), King of Naples , on February 24, 1808. It consists of a red enamelled star of five points with ball tips and gold edges, above which is an Imperial eagle; the whole is surmounted by a crown with a cross within the suspension ring. On the gold ground of the obverse medallion is the prancing horse of Naples , surrounded by a blue band inscribed PRO RENOVA TA PA TRIA. Against the gold background of the reverse medallion is the Sicilian Triquetra with a face in the centre, and on the encircling band is the legend JOS. NAP. SICILIARUM REX. The ribbon is dark blue with a red stripe in the centre. Authorities give different inscriptions for the reverse—JOS. NAPOLEO. SICILIAE REX INSTITUIT; JOSEPH NAPOLEO SICIL. REX INSTITUIT; JOS. NAPOL. SIC. REX INSTITUIT. This Order was continued during the reign of Murat , and until 1815 when Ferdinand IV regained the throne of his kingdom. It was modified by this king, but abolished in 1819 when the Order of Saint George of the Reunion of Sicily was established.\n\nMÉDAILLE D'HONNEUR (Naples). After Murat (1767–1815) became King of Naples in 1808, he authorized a Médaille d'Honneur for the Provincial Legion. This was issued on March 26, 1809. It is of silver and is 38 mm. in diameter. On the obverse is the effigy of the King facing to the left, surrounded by the words GIOACCHINO NA-POL. RE DELLE DUE SICIL. On the reverse is a group of fourteen flags and a crown, with the inscription ALLE LEGIONI PROVINCIALI LI 26 MARZO 1809. The ribbon is light blue.\n\nORDRE ROYAL D'ESPAGNE. Joseph Bonaparte (1768–1844) created this Order in 1809. The insignia is similar in design to the Royal Order of the Two Sicilies but without the eagle and crown. It is suspended by a ring attached to one star point. On the obverse appears the tower of Castile and the words JOS. NAPOLEO REX HISP. ET IND. The reverse has the lion of Aragon and the motto VIRTUTE ET FIDE. The ribbon is red moiré.\n\nORDRE DE LA COURONNE DE WEST-PHALIE. Instituted when Jérome Bonaparte (1784–1860) was King of that Principality, by a decree dated from Paris on December 25, 1809. It was created for the purpose of rewarding both soldiers and civilians for services of importance. There are four classes—Grand Commanders, Commanders, Chevaliers of the first class and Chevaliers of the second class. The decoration consists of a gold crown of eight fleurons, with a blue enamelled head-band bearing the motto of the Order, CHARACTER UND AUFRIKKEIT. ERRICHTET DEN XXV DECEMBER MDCCCIX (Dignity and candour. Founded December 25, 1809). One authority, however, gives this motto as CHARACTER UND AUFRICHTIGKEIT—ERRICHTET DEN XXV DEC. MDCCCIX. Above the crown in the centre, an eagle and a lion stand back to back beneath another crown. At the right is the horse of Westphalia , and to the left is the lion of Hesse . The Imperial Eagle standing on a thunderbolt, bearing the words JE LES UNIS (I united them), surmounts the whole. The reverse is the same except that on the lion and eagle there is a shield upon which the letters H.N. are interlaced. The suspension ring is in the form of a serpent with its tail in its mouth—a symbol of immortality. The ribbon is black with yellow borders.\n\nMÉDAILLE D'HONNEUR (Westphalia). Created by Jérome Bonaparte on June 17, 1809, for sub-officers and soldiers who had served at least ten years and who had distinguished themselves while in the service. This medal is of silver, oval in form, and bears on the obverse a trophy of arms and military equipment. Surrounding this are the words TAPFERKEID UND GUTES BETRAGEN. On the reverse is the Royal cipher J.N., crowned, and the date of the foundation, 1809. The whole is enclosed by a wreath of oak and laurel leaves. The ribbon is sky blue.\n\nA third class medal was also issued in bronze, of the same design, and suspended by a sky blue ribbon with white edges.\n\nDÉCORATION DU LIS. During the early days of the first Restoration, upon his arrival in Paris on April 12, 1814, the Count d'Artois (later Charles X. 1824–1830) caused to be distributed to the National Guard of that City, white ribbons, which were to be worn as a badge of fidelity. To perpetuate the remembrance of this distribution, they were later granted the right to suspend from the ribbon a silver fleur-de-lis. For his attendants this device was surmounted by a Royal crown. Such was the origin of the Décoration du Lis, sometimes called the Order of the Lily. The form of the lily, as well as the design of the ribbon, varies with each Department of France . They are generally to be seen with a white moiré ribbon. Monsieur A.-M. Perrot illustrates in his Ordres des Chevalerie, 1820, eighty varieties of ribbons for this decoration. Occasionally one sees a design with a shield bearing the effigy of the King. There was also used a cross of four arms with a fleur-de-lis in each angle. The centre medallion has one fleur-de-lis and the words VIVE LE ROI. This Decoration disappeared in 1830.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXIII\n\nDécoration du Lis\n\nLYS DES GARDES DU CORPS. It consists of a gilt sunburst surmounted by a Royal Crown. In the centre is an effigy of Louis XVIII, surrounded by a blue enamelled band inscribed VIVE LE ROI. On the reverse is a silver fleur-de-lis and the legend GAGE D'UNION. The ribbon is white with blue edges. Variants of this emblem appear; one has merely a silver fleur-de-lis on each side, while another has the motto HONNEUR ET PATRIE on the reverse.\n\nDÉCORATION DE BRASSARD DE BORDEAUX. This decoration was adopted for the volunteers who accompanied the Due d'Angoulême (the elder brother of Charles X.) when he entered Bordeaux on March 12, 1814. It was officially called Brassard de Bordeaux, or Brassard Vert. At first it consisted of a silk band of green with white borders, worn, as the name signifies, on the arm. Some are all green, others white with green borders. On this band is embroidered a heart and the inscription BORDEAUX 12 MARS 1814. Later, another form was adopted. This consists of an oval gilt sunburst on which is superimposed an oval medallion of white enamel bearing the royal monogram L.L., and surrounded by a green enamelled band with the words BORDEA UX 12 MARS 1814. The whole is surmounted by the royal crown. The reverse is the same. The ribbon is green with white edges. This decoration was discontinued after the revolution of 1830.\n\nDECORATION DU LYS DE BAYONNE. While not official, this decoration was worn by the National Guard of the city of Bayonne in remembrance of its part in the defence of 1814 against the troops under the Duke of Wellington . It is an oval silver medal in the form of a sunburst, having at the centre a convex white-enamelled medallion. On this is the Arms of the City of Bayonne , surrounded by the motto NUM-QUAM POLLUTA (Never dishonoured). The reverse has a silver fleur-de-lis, a crown and the words A LA GARDE NATIONALE DE BAYONNE. The ribbon is white.\n\nDECORATION DES VOLONTAIRES ROYAUX. Carried by the pupils of the Law School and of the Medical School who had organized themselves into a battalion and had accompanied King Louis XVIII to Ghent during the Hundred Days. The decoration consists of a silver white-enamelled cross of four branches, ball-tipped. The whole is surmounted by a crown. In the centre medallion of gold is the effigy of the King, surrounded by a band inscribed DIEU LE ROI ET LA PATRIE. The reverse medallion of red has the date 1815 surrounded by VOLONTAIRES ROYAUX. The ribbon is white with two red lines on either side.\n\nDÉCORATION DE L'AIGLE. When Napoleon I returned to Paris from Elba and re-established the Empire for les Cent-Jours (from March 20 to June 28, 1815), an insignia was issued called the Décoration de l'Aigle. The object of this was to distinguish his supporters from those of Louis XVIII who wore the Décoration du Lys. The badge consists of an eagle surmounted by a crown, holding in its beak a fillet on which is impressed the date 1815. No authority for this decoration has been found, and it is hardly proper to consider it official.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXIV\n\nDécoration de l'Aigle\n\nCROIX DE LA FIDÉLITÉ. Authorized on February 5, 1916, to replace the Decoration of the Lily. It was given to those who were faithful to Louis XVIII upon the abdication of Napoleon I . The insignia is a white enamelled silver star of five points, ball-tipped, surmounted by a fleur-de-lis and the Royal crown, with a smaller fleur-de-lis within the suspension ring. At the centre of the obverse, a gold medallion bears the effigy of the King, facing to right. The medallion is surrounded by a blue band inscribed Fidélité Dévouement. The reverse medallion displays a silver fleur-de-lis on a gold ground surrounded by a blue band inscribed 12 AVRIL,3 MAI 1814, 19 MARS, 8 JUILLET, 1815. The ribbon consists of three bands equal in width, that in the middle being white, the outer ones, blue.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXV\n\nCroix de la Fidélité\n\nDECORATION DE JUILLET 1830. When the people of France revolted on July 27, 28 and 29, 1830, against those who had violated the Constitution, the Chamber of Deputies placed Louis Philippe, Due d'Orléans, a member of the younger house of the Bourbons, on the throne. To reward the citizens who had distinguished themselves during those three famous days, the Croix de Juillet was authorized by the decree of December 13, 1830. Although called a cross, it has but three double pointed arms which are ball-tipped. It is on a wreath of oak leaves and surmounted by a mural crown. At the centre of the obverse, are red, white and blue enamelled bands encircling the Gallic cock, with the words PATRIE ET LIBERTE on the red band. The reverse is similarly banded with 27, 28, 29 JUILLET, in three lines on the blue centre, 1830 on the white band and DONNE PAR LE ROI DES FRANÇAIS on the outer band of red. The ribbon is sky blue, edged with red.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXVI\n\nDécoration de Juillet, 1830\n\nThere are several variants of. this decoration. On one there is no crown above the cross and the inscription 27,28,29, JUILLET, appears on the red band, while 1830 is in the blue centre. The reverse has PATRIE ET LIBERTE on the red band with DONNE PAR LA NATION in the blue centre. Another variant is composed of three enamelled tricoloured flags instead of the cross, while the centre is a reproduction in miniature of the silver medal next described.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE JUILLET. This medal was also authorized and is in silver. On the obverse appears the Gallic cock of France standing on a flag within a wreath of oak leaves, around which are the words A SES DEFENSEURS LA PATRIE RECONNAISSANTE (A grateful country to its defenders). On the reverse are three laurel wreaths intertwined, encircling the dates 27, 28, 29. Beneath, JUILLET 1830; above, PA TRIE ET LIBERTE. On the edge of the medal, DONNE PAR LE ROI DES FRANÇAIS. The ribbon is red, white and blue.\n\nMÉDAILLE DES BLESSÉS DE 1848. After the Revolution of 1848 and the abdication of Louis Philippe, General Cavaignac submitted to the Assembly the desirability of issuing a medal to reward those who were wounded at that time. This does not seem to have been adopted by the Legislative authorities. There was, however, a medal made and issued called the Médaille des Blessés de 1848. This may have been devised by a society of the veterans of that eventful occasion. The medal is of silver, 20 mm. in diameter. On the obverse appears the figure of a woman with a helmet on her head. Her right hand holds a flag, and the left a fasces. The words REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE appear on the face. The reverse has within an oak wreath 22, 23, 24 FEVRIER, 1848; and outside the wreath, BLESSE POUR LA LIBERTE, and the name of the recipient. The ribbon is red, with a blue and a white stripe on one side only.\n\nMÉDAILLE DES VICTIMES DU 2 DÉCEMBRE 1851. This decoration was of the same class as the Médaille des Blessés de 1848. The obverse is the same but the reverse has the words VICTIME DE 2 DECEMBRE 1851 within an oak wreath, while around the edge appears in relief DEFENSEUR DU DROIT, and engraved below is the name of the one to whom the medal was awarded. One in the author's collection bears the name \"Vve. Benjamin Colin.\" The ribbon is like that described above— red, with a white and a blue stripe on one side only.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE 1849. After defeating Garibaldi at Rome in 1849 and holding that city for the Pope, the French troops taking part in the campaign were rewarded by the Papal authorities with the Médaille de 1849. This was a round medal of 30 mm. and was issued in gold, silver and bronze. On the obverse are the Pontifical emblems, surrounded by a wreath of laurel and the words SEDES APOSTOLICA ROMANA. The reverse bears the inscription in five lines, PIUS IX PONT. MAX. ROMAE RESTITUTUS CATHOLICIS ARMIS COLLATIS. AN. MDCCCXLIX (Pius IX Pontifex Maxi- mus restored to Rome by the Armies of the United Catholics). This is suspended by a white ribbon with a yellow stripe in the centre.\n\nCROIX DE MENTANA. Authorized by Pope Pius IX in 1867. This was to reward troops that had taken part in the defence of the Holy City and assisted the Church of Rome . This decoration was recognized and accepted by the French Government in 1868; and Frenchmen who were entitled to it were permitted to wear the cross under the same conditions as the British medals for the Baltic, and the Turkish and British medals for the Crimean campaigns. It is a silver four-armed, eight-pointed cross. On the obverse are the Pontifical emblems at the centre with the words FIDEI ET VIRTUTI. On the arms of the cross is the inscription PP PIUS IX 1867. On the reverse medallion is a cross and laurel wreath with the words HINC VICTORIA above. The ribbon is white with two blue stripes.\n\nMÉDAILLE MILITAIRE. Authorized on January 22, 1852, during Prince Louis Napoleon's Presidency of the Second Republic. It was issued for bravery and long service in the army and navy to junior officers and enlisted men. This decoration ranks with the Distinguished Conduct Medal of England . It is now also awarded to men of the allied forces. It consists of a silver-gilt wreath of laurel leaves, tied at the base and at the top with narrow gilt fillets. In the centre of the obverse on a gilt ground, is the head of Louis Napoleon facing to the left, and around this on a blue enamelled band, the words LOUTS NAPOLEON. The reverse bears the inscription VALEUR ET DISCIPLINE. The whole is surmounted by a gilt Imperial Eagle with head to the right, holding in its claws a thunder-bolt. On the reverse the tail of the eagle extends over the blue enamelled band and the wings are attached to the silver-gilt wreath. In a second model, the lightning-arrows are more pronounced and the eagle's tail falls short of the centre band. The wings too are free from the wreath, and the entire piece is somewhat thicker than the first type.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXVII\n\nMédaille Militaire\n\nSecond Republic First type\n\nOn November 8, 1870, just fifty-five days after the proclamation of the Third Republic and the downfall of Napoleon II, a decree was issued modifying the Médaille Militaire. The centre of the obverse displays the head of Ceres. On the encircling band are the words REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE 1870. The reverse centre is unchanged. The eagle is replaced by a trophy of arms and an anchor. These are the same on each side, and are fastened to the laurel wreath. In a still later type the trophy of arms is plain on the reverse and is attached to the medal by a ring under the anchor so that it is movable. There is also a slight variation in the way the hair of Ceres is tied. The ribbon has always been the same—orange, edged with green.\n\nAn interesting variant of the Médaille Militaire was adopted to reward the Annamite troops who were worthy of distinction. It consists of a round silver medal, surmounted by a dragon and two crossed Chinese swords. In the centre are Chinese characters equivalent to the reverse inscription, PROTECTORAT DE L'ANNAM ET DU TONKIN VALEUR ET DISCIPLINE, surrounded by oak and laurel leaves.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXVIII\n\nMédaille Militaire\n\nThird Republic Second Type\n\nORDRE DU MÉRITE AGRICOLE. This Order was established on July 7, 1883, to reward those who had distinguished themselves in agricultural development. The decoration consists of a six-pointed, white-enamelled star superimposed upon a wreath of olive leaves. In the centre is the head of the Republic, surrounded by a blue band inscribed REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE. The reverse gold centre has the words MERITE AGRICOLE 1883, in three lines. The ribbon is green, edged with red.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE SAINTE-HÉLÈNE. Napoleon III instituted on August 12, 1857, a bronze medal to reward all living soldiers and sailors who had fought for France from 1792 to 1815. It is an oval bronze wreath with a crown above, and has in the centre the effigy of Napoleon I facing to right, and the words NAPOLEON I EMPEREUR. On the reverse is the inscription, CAMPAGNES DE 1792 A 1815 A SES COMPAGNONS DE GLOIRE SA DERNIERE PENSEE. SAINTE-HELENE 5 MAI 1821. The ribbon is dark green with seven narrow red stripes. While this is officially styled the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, it is frequently mentioned as the Medal for Napoleon's Veterans. When Napoleon III adopted the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, it was the first time that any medal or decoration had been given to the rank and file of service men to distinguish their having been in the armed forces of France . Although no service medals were authorized by France for her soldiers and sailors who had served in the Crimean War, the Governments of England , Italy and Turkey distributed medals similar to their own to some of the French troops.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXIX\n\nMérite Agricole\n\nMÉDAILLE D'ITALIE. Authorized by Napoleon III by a decree dated August 11, 1859, to reward all troops who had served in the campaign in Italy . It is a silver medal consisting of a wreath of laurel branches tied at the four points, forming the rim of the medal. In the centre is the effigy of the Emperor facing to the left, surrounded by the words NAPOLEON III EMPEREUR. On the reverse are the names of the battles, MONTEBELLO PA LEST RO TURBIGO MAGENTA MARIGNAN SOLFERINO, and the legend CAMPAGNE D'ITALIE 1859. The ribbon has red and white stripes, seven of the former and six of the latter.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXX\n\nMédaille de Sainte-Hélène\n\nMÉDAILLE DE CHINE. The expedition to China in 1860 was soon followed by a similar reward of service. On January 23, 1861, a decree was issued authorizing this medal. The obverse is similar to the medal for Italy . The reverse bears on the outer edge, EXPEDITION DE CHINE 1860, and in the centre are inscribed the names of the engagements, TA-KOU, CHANG-KIA-WAN PA-LI-KAO PE-KING. The ribbon is yellow, bearing on the face the Chinese characters signifying Pe-King.\n\nMÉDAILLE DU MEXIQUE. Following the Expedition to Mexico of 1862–1863, another silver medal was authorized on August 29, 1863. This followed the previous medals as to the obverse. The reverse bears the inscription EXPEDITION DU MEXIQUE 1862–1863, and the names of the engagements, CUMBRES CERRO-BORREGO SAN-LORENZO PUEBLA MEXICO. The ribbon is white silk with red and green rays, crossed, and surmounted by the Mexican eagle, holding a snake.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE LA GUERRE DE 18701871. The Frenchmen who took part in the Franco-Prussian war and served in France and Algeria during the years 1870–1871, received no insignia whatever from their Government to testify to their service until 1911. Just forty years after the Treaty of Peace with Germany , a silver medal was authorized called the Médaille de la Guerre de 1870–1871. This was given to all living veterans who had served under the tri-colour in that war. The medal bears on its face the head of the Republic and the words REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE. On the reverse is a trophy of arms with the inscription AUX DEFENSEURS DE LA PATRIE on a tablet below, and the date 1870–1871 above. The ribbon is green and black stripes. The volunteer troops in this war are allowed to wear on the ribbon a bar inscribed Engagé Volontaire.\n\nIn 1885, and following all other campaigns and expeditions in which the army and navy of France took part, silver medals were authorized. Space would hardly allow all these to be described in detail. They are given below in the order of their issuance:\n\nMédaille du Tonkin. For the expedition to China and Annam in 1883, 1884 and 1885. On the reverse appear the names of the engagements Sontay, Bac-Ninh, Fou-Tchéou, Formose, Tuyen-Quau, Pescadores. The medal for the men of the Navy, in this campaign has, in addition, the engagement, Cau-Giai, which precedes the others. The ribbon is yellow with four green stripes.\n\nMédaille de Madagascar . For the expedition of 1885. Ribbon light blue and green, in longitudinal stripes.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXXI\n\nMédaille de 1870–71\n\nMédaille du Dahomey. For services in that section in 1892. Ribbon yellow and black stripes.\n\nMédaille Coloniale. For services in Africa and the Colonies. This was authorized in 1893, and many bars were given for the different engagements. The ribbon is light blue, with one wide and two narrow white stripes. Gold bars were given for De l'Atlantique à la mer Rouge (The Marchand expedition), Mission Saharienne, Congo-Gabon, and Centre-Africain. The bars of silver were for Adrar , Afrique occidentale Française, Algérie , Centre-Africain Cochinchine, Comores , Congo , Côte d'Ivoire , Côte d'Or, Dahomey , Guinée Française, Guyane , Haut-Mékong, Haut-Oubanghi, Iles de la Société, Iles Marquises , Laos et Mékong, Madagascar (the second Campaign), Mauritanie , Nossi-Bé , Nouvelle Calédonie , Sahara , Sénégal et Soudan , Tchad , Tonkin , Tunisie and Maroc.\n\nMédaille de Madagascar . For the second expedition of 1894–1895, and 1896.\n\nMédaille de Chine. For those who took part in the defence of the legations in Pekin in 1900–1901. Ribbon green and yellow stripes.\n\nMédaille du Maroc. Authorized in 1909, for all who took part in the military operation in that country, or in protecting property there. The ribbon for this is similar to the Médaille Coloniale, but in green with one wide and two narrow white stripes. The bars given with this medal are for Casablanca , Oudjda , Haut-Guir, Fez; and many others have since been added.\n\nCROIX DE GUERRE. By the law of the 8th of April 1915, a bronze cross was authorized to reward Officers and men of all ranks of the army and navy of France and of the Allied forces who were mentioned in despatches. This was called the Croix de Guerre. The decoration is a bronze cross with plain edges. The hilts of two crossed swords fill the lower angles; the points, the upper. In the centre medallion is the head of Ceres facing to the right, surrounded by a band inscribed REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE. On the reverse is the date 1914–1915. In later types, this was changed each year of the war as follows, 1914–1916, 1914–1917, 1914–1918. The ribbon is dark green with seven red stripes, the same as used for the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène.\n\n\"The different classes of despatches for which a recipient was awarded the Cross may be recognized by the following embellishments attached to the ribbon: Army Despatch. Small bronze laurel branch (Palme en bronze). Army Corps Despatch. Silver-gilt star. Divisional Despatch. Silver star. Brigade, Regimental or similar unit Despatch. Bronze star.\n\n\"Every time a man is mentioned in despatches, he receives a corresponding sign. Thus, a man may wear the Cross with, say, the silver star and the Palmes en bronze. When the ribbon of the Croix de Guerre is worn in undress uniform, the appropriate embellishment in miniature is worn on the ribbon. When a recipient of the Croix de Guerre has been awarded five Palmes en bronze he wears instead a silver Palme.\"\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXXII\n\nCroix de Guerre (avec palme)\n\nCROIX DE GUERRE DES THÉÂTRES D'OPÉRATIONS EXTÉRIEURES. This decoration was instituted by a decree of April 30,1921, to reward those of the Army, Navy and civil affairs who had shown exceptional efficiency in their service to the country or its colonies after the signing of the Armistice, especially outside the war zone of France and Belgium. The cross is similar to the Croix de Guerre, except that the reverse medallion has the inscription THÉÂTRES D'OPÉRATIONS EXTÉRIEURES. The ribbon is sky blue edged with broad red bands. The bestowal of this honour carries with it the same privileges as to subsequent citations as does the Croix de Guerre with respect to the wearing of the Palme en bronze or the Etoile d'argent.\n\nIt ranks with that cross which should be worn immediately following the Médaille Militaire; in case of both, this cross should follow the Croix de Guerre of 1914–1918.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE LA GRANDE GUERRE, 1914–1918. In the issue of January 29, 1921, of L'Illustration, Paris , is a represen- tation of the medal designed by Alexandre Morion. This was awarded first prize in the competition for the War Medal of the World War. The obverse bears a symbolic head of France , wearing a trench helmet—a modern Minerva, facing to the left. The left hand is holding a sword. Laurel wreaths are on the shoulder. The reverse has in the centre in three lines, GRANDE GUERRE 1914–1918. Around this, with letters resting on an oak and laurel wreath is the inscription REPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE. The suspension ring or loop is very broad, and attached to the medal by sprigs of laurel. Under the law of June 28, 1920, this Medal is to be awarded to all who served in the Army and Navy between August 2, 1914, and November 11, 1918 including the various organizations working with them.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE VICTOIRE. At this writing it has been impossible to obtain a specimen or an authentic description of the Victory Medal of France . Owing to the delay of the authorities in issuing this, some manufacturers of medals in Paris have issued one, but this is not official.\n\nIt is of bronze, bearing on the obverse the winged figure of Victory. In her right hand she holds a sword, and in the left hand a laurel branch. On the reverse, across the centre, is inscribed LA GRANDE GUERRE POUR LA CIVILISATION 1914–1918 with laurel branches above and below. The rainbow ribbon is adopted as by all the Allies.\n\nMÉDAILLE DE LA RECONNAISSANCE FRANÇAISE. One of the most highly prized of the recent Decorations of France was adopted in July, 1917. It is called the Médaille de la Reconnaissance Française. Its purpose was to reward those who had distinguished themselves in acts of devotion to the public interest in the Great War, and for work among the people. At least one year of service is necessary although a few exceptions have been made. It is issued by a decree of the President of the Republic. The medal is of three classes, gold, silver and bronze and is 30 mm. in diameter. On the obverse, an artistic design by Desbois depicts a womanly figure bending over to assist an injured soldier. The reverse is plain, save for a palm branch and the words RECONNAISSANCE FRANÇAISE. The ribbon is 38 mm. wide, of white moiré silk, with blue, white and red stripes each side.\n\nFRENCH DECORATIONS Pl. XXXIII\n\nMédaille de Victoire\n\nThis decoration has been conferred on several American and British citizens for their charitable work during the late war, and is considered by some a higher distinction than the Légion d'Honneur.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing Orders, Decorations and War-medals, there have been many other awards. These have been issued for Education, Life-saving, Service in the Police and Fire Departments, Merchant Marine, and other Government Departments, and conferred chiefly on civilians. They are of gold, silver or bronze, according to the importance of the award. The numismatist, therefore, will have no inconsiderable task in securing specimens of all the French medallic awards. 7 Most of these are called Médailles d'Honneur. They are as follows:\n\nMédaille des Instituteurs 1818 Médaille de la Société de Secours Mutuel 1852 Médaille Coloniale de l'Instruction Primaire 1895 Médaille de l'Instruction Publique en Indo-Chine 1895\n\nIssued by the Ministry of the Interior:\n\nMédaille d'Honneur de Sauvetage.

XXXIV\n\nReconnaissance Française\n\nIn addition to the above, similar medals are issued by the Government for services in Algeria.\n\nH. Leduc writes in his book Histoire des Décorations en France , p. 125:\n\n\"Following the instruction of the Grand Chancellor of the Order of the Légion d'Honneur for the execution of the ordinance of April 16th, 1824, the only Royal Orders allowed are:\n\nSaint-Esprit\n\nSainl-Michel\n\nSaint-Louis\n\nMérite Militaire\n\nLégion d'Honneur\n\nSaint-Lazare and Notre - Dame - du - Mont-Carmel réunis.\n\n\"All subjects of the King (Louis XVIII) decorated with one of these Orders must be furnished with brevets or with letters of advice, stating their nomination and signed by the following:\n\nFor the Saint-Esprit , by the Chancellor of the Order.\n\nFor the Saint-Michel , by the Ministry of the House of the King.\n\nFor the Saint-Louis and the Mérite Militaire, by the Ministers of War or Marine.\n\nFor the Légion d'Honneur, by the Grand Chancellor of the Order.\n\nFor the reunited Orders of Saint-Lazare and Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel , by the Minister of the House of the King.\n\n\"The last Order has not been conferred since 1788 and is being discontinued.\n\n\"All others claiming classification among the French Orders, such as those of the Saint-George de Franche-Comté, Saint-Hubert des Ardennes, de Lorraine et du Barrois, du Saint-Sépulcre de Jérusalem , and all others under whatever title or denomination, whether given by Commissions, Chapters, Corporations, Associations, Brotherhoods, Arch-brotherhoods, so-called Grand Masters or their Delegates, Governors of General Administrators, etc., are declared abolished, consequently null, illegal and improper. Those who do not surrender them immediately are subject to penalties under Article 259 of the Penal Code.\"\n\nChronological table of other French Orders, which ceased to exist at the time of the Revolution: 8"
