        "text": "I am doing some research on my father's WWI history. The particular battle he was involved in and which interests me was, I believe, the 2nd Battle for Kemmel Hill 24-25 April 1918. He was an officer in the 24th Royal Field Artillery which was defending the French. From his memoirs (somewhat glorifying war):\n\n\"Was there ever a bigger thrill in anyone's life than that day in April 1918 when I was in command of the 'sacrifice battery' of field artillery at Kemmel Hill. Every man and every officer was either killed or wounded, every gun was disabled, all our infantry killed or captured, and only four of us with feeble Lewis guns and the Bosche just a few hundred yards off. That to my mind was just superb, and I could have 'gone west' that day feeling as elated as any old warrior bound for his Valhalla.\"\n\nThere is clear evidence that the French awarded the Croix de Guerre to the RFA unit, I presume the 24th Battery. The following, though, is anecdotal evidence which I would like to confirm.\n\nWhen the medal was awarded, my father was back in England recovering from gas and injury. So the medal was received by the officer who took over the unit after the battle who was not present in the action for which the award was made. That officer spent the rest of his life with the symbol of the medal on his lapel. His brother states, on the internet, that \"It opened many doors from him.\" The same officer also was the recipient of the British Military Cross, awarded in 1919. The only explanation I can see was that it was awarded as a British recognition of the French award.\n\nHe was pestered by his brother for a detailed account of the action that led to the award and he clearly dodged those questions. In spite of the background he remained a war comrade of my father and my mother described how his wife once drew her aside asking about the story of the medal because her husband would never talk about it.\n\nI have copies of the war records held at Kew for both my father and the officer referred to. My father's shows that he was injured (gassed) the date of the battle, whilst the other officer was involved in various staff movements at the time. The dates of the gazetting of both medals is given in the officer's records. I have tried unsuccessfully to track down the entries in the London Gazette. But I have been advised that they will likely only show the name of the medal recipient and the date of the award, basically information I already have from his file. What I really want are official details - the unit, the battle, the dates - justifying the award.\n\nMy next line of enquiry will be on the French side. Does anyone have any suggestions?\n\nThanks for those responses.\n\nI should declare some relevant information. I am based in Australia. Both my father and the other officer were also Australian. I suspect enlisting in the British rather than the Australian army was a class thing for both men. From my father's memoirs:\n\n[My father (from Devon)] impressed on me the honour that was mine in being an officer of the British Army.\n\n“I’d rather have you as a subaltern there than a Major in the Australian Army,” he told me. Needless to say I didn’t think the same as pay at that time was 8/6 per day,\n\nplus a few allowances, and that of the Australian Major 35/- per day\n\nSo at present I can only access information online. The Kew records I have were copied by my daughter when she was in London recently. The advice given by Mark seems to require the ability to visit the National Archives.\n\nChris's post has two links which I have tried. The London Gazette link gives me a \"This site can't be reached\" message, presumably because I am in Australia. I think I had already tried that website before for the same result. There are other databases for the London Gazette which I tried unsuccessfully. But I was discouraged from trying further by advice from the Archives' staff that I was unlikely to get any more information from the Gazette than I already had - the medal's name, the name of the officer and the Gazette date (late 1918). I am unsure if the Gazette date is the same date as the date of the award ceremony. My best guess is that it will be a later date.\n\nThe other link was to 'The French Journal Officiel' which I also tried. The heading for the page I reached (translated) was: ' Official Journal of the French Republic. Laws and decrees'. The year could be specified. Searching 'Croix de Guerre' gave me entries only about the medal, not a list of awardees, consistent with the heading ' Laws and decrees' I keyed in the officer's name also and predictably drew a blank with that as well. I tried working back to the root URL but that didn't help either.\n\nNot sure who would be cast in an unfavourable light, but to be fair don't know how anyone can help you should you wish to get to the bottom of this without providing the names of the officers.\n\nThat said we should at least consider the facts against the wholly fictitious account of a 'sacrifice battery' in your original post.\n\nBack to basics I assume we are discussing the 24th Brigade R.F.A., who along with the 2nd Brigade R.F.A. and together with associated units formed the 6th Division Divisional Artillery. The 24th Brigade was commanded by Lt. Col J.A.C. Forsyth D.S.O. and comprised 110th Battery commanded by Major P.J.C. Honnor M.C., 111th Battery commanded by Major F.M.A.Wood; 112th Battery Commanded by Mjor W.S. Ironside, D.S.O.,M.C. and 43rd Battery commanded by Major J.B.Tod. These senior officers were in command as shown from the 1st March 1916 to 1st June 1916 (dates relevant to your query only). They were supported by a Captain and four to five 2/lieutenants. The full list of officers can be found in the Divisional Commander's war diary which you can download from the TNA.https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/results/r?_dss=range&_ro=any&_hb=tna&_srt=1&_q=\"WO+95%2F1591\"\n\nNote it has been split up by TNA so may be more complete.\n\nThese lists clearly give a continuity of command of 24th Brigade RFA.\n\nUnfortunately the month of April 1918 is missing from the Divisional Commander's war diary. It may be misfiled, I haven't looked.\n\nHowever there is correspondence to show the appreciation of the Commander 14th French Division, but no mention of a C de G either to any unit of the Division, or any individual. There are rare instances of the award being made in the field to individual officers and men by French Commanders but usually foreign awards were granted by the C.O. of the unit concerned. Essentially, a quota would be received from High Command and officers and men were nominated by the C.O., unlike British and Empire recommendations which passed up the change of command there was a certainty about the receipt of foreign awards and often they were given to staff officers.\n\nTurning to the events of the 24/25 April the war diary of the 24th Brigade (also available from TNA\n\nhttps://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C7352313) shows that on the 20th April 1918, 'The French on our right carried out a successful operation and advanced their line in front of Ridge Wood. One battery of the 24th Brigade assisted with a protective barrage....' There was a raid by the 2nd Bn D.L.I. on the 21st but nothing of any real significance for the remainder of the month of April, some counter battery work with the RGA and really that was about it.\n\nThere was further co-operation with the French in May, but owing to the topography of the salient the batteries were subject to frequent gas attacks which caused most of the casualties in these months, especially towards the end of May, so much so that Division was compelled to issue a reminder about protective measures but sadly no 'Valhalla' just the dreadful routine attrition of the Salient.\n\nLetter from the French Commander\n\nEdited 16 July , 2019 by kenf48\n\nI was going to release the name and provide details before I became uncomfortable knowing that people with a possible military background would be viewing the exercise. How would they feel if an outsider got hold of their military file and used it to ask questions about their background, even fifty years after their death? This forum lists the numbers of replies but not reads but I am guessing for every person who replies there would be several who just read the post. And no one has recommended the officer's name should be suppressed. . I would have thought his family would never get to see this thread - but it may be picked up by a Google search of his name. At least the record will show I was ambivalent about the choice I am making. After all the enquiry is about learning the truth\n\nHis name was Gerald Steinfeld Kaye. I attach extracts from his file. The type-written document I believe was in a response to the 1935 'Service Enquiry' from the Australian War Memorial also attached. He also served in the Australian Army in WWII, so he is likely to have requested his credentials in WWI be sent from England before enlisting again.\n\nThe document mentions his service in the London Yeomanry before the war. This was under the name Gerald Steinfeld Kornblum, a name which he changed by deed poll presumably because of anti-German sentiments at the time (also in his file).\n\nFor those war historians on this forum the numbers of the various units are obviously important, but much less so for me. Some people are querying my claim that the 24th Battery was in the 24-25/4/1918 battle. My use of that number comes from my father's (1964) memoirs which my sister, the historian, quoted in a book she was writing before she died in 2007 (this helps explain the lateness of my involvement):\n\n\"My career was an experience of many heavy battles, many hard knocks, a lot of luck but bad breaks at the wrong time. By 1916 I had become a Major in the 24th Regular Battery of RFA (est. 1576). My father was even prouder than I was. But being heedless of one’s own danger and heedful of the men under my guard cost me my first battery command in 1916.\"\n\nBut I doubt that will satisfy Ken who wrote about my first quote \"... the wholly fictitious account of a 'sacrifice battery\". I have to restrict myself here to measured language. Does Ken think that all my posts are based on fiction or is it just the quotes? From whom does he think the fiction comes from? My father? Me? What about the attachments? Does he think they are fakes too? What are Ken's credentials for deciding between fact and fiction, 100 years after the fact, beyond being a GWF Lieut-General? An actual Lieut-General perhaps recently retired?\n\nMy father received three mentions in despatches signed by Churchill one of which is on my wall, but no medals for gallantry which he always regretted. But I doubt if Ken would believe that either even if I posted a copy of a certificate.\n\nBack to the story. The 24th Battery is also shown in one of the extracts from Kaye's war records attached dated 28/2/1918. But I am not hung-up on that particular unit. If it proves to be another that's fine.\n\nMax writes about the 'Croix de Guerre with Palms'. As you can see the two mentions in the Kaye record extracts cite only the Croix de Guerre. But in the brother's testimony on tape on the Australian War Memorial website -\n\nhttps://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C282538\n\n- he seems to say 'et Palm'. I believe the tapes were made before the internet so the 'palm' mention is likely to be genuine. I have already transcribed relevant parts of the 3 tapes.\n\n2nd cassette around 37m 20s:\n\n\"The French made rather a fuss about Neuve-Église which had seemingly gained time at a critical juncture. There was an investiture, .... Gerald, ... received an [word unclear] award of the Croix de Guerre et palm. .... He heard later that the original recommendation had been for the Legion of Honour but that this had been disallowed on the score of a lost battle. ...\n\n\"On post war visits to France he would wear the ribbon of the Croix in his lapel, in French style. It opened many doors. He was also told that his name had gone to British HQ for a DSO. This was also disallowed.\"\n\nThe 'Neuve-Église' sentence seems to be all there is in the recording to justify the medal. The brother seems to regret Gerald 'only' received the Croix de Guerre and the Military Cross.\n\nAround the 17m of the third cassette:\n\n\"Long years ago Gerald showed me the citation of his Croix de Guerre. ... It told in florid French officialese how Captain Kaye of the British Royal Artillery had fought his battery effectively on the 9th April 1918 under appalling conditions and murderous fire and had displayed truly British sang- froid.\"\n\nThe 9th April 1918 date conflicts with my belief that the medal was awarded for action on the 24-25th April. But he is remembering from 'long years ago'. He does not explain what had happened to the citation - obviously a precious document - since then. I am confident that his date is wrong, but that is another reason why I am enquiring.\n\nFive documents are attached from Kaye's file with lots of dates and units for you historians to investigate. I have war records for my father and two other of his fellow officers and an actual extract from the war diary of a third officer for the 24th April 1918 (in my sister's records) which places my father in command at the time, but suffering from gas. The only useful information in their official records is that both my father and the third officer were transferred after injury / gassing on either 24th or 25th April 1918.\n\nThis is a very long post but I hope that it helps someone more skilled with war research and better placed than me find some crucial information.\n\nMy reading of the docs presented are as follows\n\n25/2/18 - posted to 24th Battery\n\n3/3/18 - Kaye goes to Shoeburyness on a course\n\n17/3/18 - whilst on a course made Acting Capt as a 2 i/c of a gun battery (this would be the 24th as no other posting recorded)\n\n30/3/18 - Kaye returns to his unit from the course (again the doc would indicate this is back to 24th Battery\n\n26/4/18 - Kay is posted to 72 Battery (also in 38th Brigade RFA) and is subsequently inidicated to be I/C of that Battery\n\nSo agree with MaxD.\n\nMy conclusions from the data presented is\n\nThe docs make no mention of any \"staff\" appointments during the relevant period.\n\nThe docs would indicate, on the face of it, that Kaye was present on 24/5-4-18.\n\nHe was 2 i/c of the battery on 24/5-4-18\n\nIf one accepts the assumption the C de G was awarded to the Battery for the action did the Battery CO also receive one? Was the CO womba's father?\n\nThere is no evidence direct documentary evidence (yet found) that the C de G was awarded to Kaye for the battery's action on 24/5th. Indeed womba says from the French version it was awarded for actions on 9/4/18\n\nKaye was posted out of 24 the day after the battle. So if he did take over the 24th it was literally for one day. This would rather suggest, but not confirm, his presence with the 38 Brigade RFA on that date.\n\nI think Ken may have been looking at the wrong unit. Ken is a fine contributor to the GWF who gives his time and energy freely\n\nSo, all in all, my dispassionate conclusion is the evidence above and so far known does not prove, or in some cases, contradicts the contention that is the subject of this thread. Other evidence is clearly required to make a strong case for the contention.\n\nEdited 17 July , 2019 by Mark1959\n\nI would differ in my reading of the events of the latter part of April, supported by the war diary of 38 Army FA Brigade and that of HQRA 25 Division.. The operational sequence of events was:\n\n11 April - 38 Brigade placed under orders of HQRA 25 Division and positioned in the Neuve Eglise area Kaye is serving in 24 Battery.\n\n21 April - 154 French Division came into the line and took over the front covered by the artillery of 25 Division (which included now 38 Brigade)\n\n23 April - 38 Brigade (and 11 Brigade) handed to 154 French Division. These two brigades are now the only British field artillery brigades covering the 154 French Division front.\n\n23 April (from 38 Brigade war diary) intense [enemy] shelling of the rear areas during the afternoon which quietened by 9 30 pm. 4 wounded and 20 horses.\n\n24 April - Quiet morning and afternoon, French assaulted Kemmel at 9 30 pm and took Kemmel. Prisoners warned of an attack liable the next day. All warned.\n\n25 April - SOS fired at 2 30 am, all communication lines lost. Intense [enemy] bombardment at 8 30 am, 72 Battery was heavily shelled and \"suffered considerably\" with all officers wounded, the battery temporarily being commanded by a gun number 1. Numerous casualties and continuous intermittent shelling until 10 pm. Capt Kaye to temporary command of 72 Battery. (his record has the posting recorded)\n\n26 April - Quiet day\n\n27 April - French counter attack on Kemmel hill reported successful.\n\n4 May - 38 Brigade withdrawn for a move to XV Corps area.\n\nNow we come to the bit that is the nub of the discussion.\n\nThe diary records, on 2 May - Col Audipert, CRA French Division presented Croix de Guerre for services during the brigades attachment to the French division to a list of officers and men which includes Major (sic) Kaye. They are to be found in the London Gazette.\n\nThe diary also includes a routine order dated 18 May 1918 by the same officer naming in divisional artillery orders a larger number of officers and men of a number of artillery brigades, including 38 Brigade, each with a short commendation. The one for Kaye (as commander 72 Battery) reads:\n\nHas commanded his battery from 23 April to 1 May 1918, showing exceptional sang-froid under murderous bombardments and a more than perfect contempt for danger (my translation).\n\nFrom the above:\n\nThere was no unit award (as said before that honour has only ever gone to one RA battery - 5 Battery)\n\nOne could see how in the story of that day, words like \"sacrifice battery\" might creep in to the telling, such a phrase would of course not appear in the war diary.\n\nMaxD\n\nthe war diary is WO 95/294/10"
