        "text": "Military decoration of France\n\nThis article is about a French military decoration. For the Belgian decoration known as the Croix de guerre or Oorlogskruis, see Croix de Guerre (Belgium).\n\nAward\n\nCroix de GuerreType\n\nMilitary decoration (four class decoration)\n\nFour degrees:\n\nCroix de Guerre with Bronze Palm\n\nCroix de Guerre with Gold Star\n\nCroix de Guerre\n\nCroix de Guerre with Bronze Star\n\nAwarded forIndividuals who distinguish themselves by acts of heroism involving combat with enemy forcesDescriptionA bronze cross with swordsPresented byFranceEligibilityMilitary personnel only, often bestowed to members of allied countriesCampaign(s)\n\nOther wars not fought on French soil\n\nClaspsNone for wars or campaigns; stars and palm denote level of each medal awardedStatusActiveEstablishedApril 2, 1915\n\nThe Croix de Guerre (French: [kʁwa də ɡɛʁ], Cross of War) is a military decoration of France. It was first created in 1915 and consists of a square-cross medal on two crossed swords, hanging from a ribbon with various degree pins. The decoration was first awarded during World War I, again in World War II, and in other conflicts; the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures (\"cross of war for external theatres of operations\") was established in 1921 for these. The Croix de Guerre was also commonly bestowed on foreign military forces allied to France.[1]\n\nThe Croix de Guerre may be awarded either as an individual award or as a unit award to those soldiers who distinguish themselves by acts of heroism involving combat with the enemy. The medal is awarded to those who have been \"mentioned in dispatches\", meaning a heroic deed or deeds were performed meriting a citation from an individual's headquarters unit. The unit award of the Croix de Guerre with palm was issued to military units whose members performed heroic deeds in combat and were subsequently recognized by headquarters.\n\nAppearance\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croix de Guerre medal varies depending on which country is bestowing the award and for what conflict. Separate French medals exist for the First and Second World War.\n\nFor the unit decoration of the Croix de Guerre, a fourragère (which takes the form of a braided cord) is awarded; this is suspended from the shoulder of an individual's uniform.\n\nAs the Croix de Guerre is issued as several medals, and as a unit decoration, situations typically arose where an individual was awarded the decoration several times, for different actions, and from different sources. Regulations also permitted the wearing of multiple Croix de Guerre, meaning that such medals were differentiated in service records by specifying French Croix de Guerre, French Croix de Guerre (WWI), etc.\n\nFrench Croix de Guerre\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three distinct Croix de Guerre medals in the French system of honours:\n\nRibbon Awards Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (for World War I service) Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (for World War II service) Croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures (TOE), for wars other than World War I and World War II not fought on French soil[note 1]\n\nFurthermore, the French collaborationist government created two croix during World War II. These croix are now illegal under French law and wearing them is outlawed:\n\nRibbon Awards Croix de Guerre (Vichy France; for World War II service) Croix de Guerre de la Légion des Volontaires Français (for World War II service)\n\nThe Croix was created by a law of April 2, 1915, proposed by French deputy Émile Briant. The Croix reinstated and modified an older system of mentions in dispatches, which were only administrative honours with no medal accompanying them. The sculptor Paul-André Bartholomé created the medal, a bronze cross with swords, showing the effigy of the republic.\n\nThe French Croix represents a mention in dispatches awarded by a commanding officer, at least a regimental commander. Depending on the officer who issued the mention, the ribbon of the Croix is marked with extra pins.\n\nMentioned in Dispatches:\n\na bronze star for those who had been mentioned at the regiment or brigade level.\n\na silver star, for those who had been mentioned at the division level.\n\na silver-gilt (gold) star for those who had been mentioned at the corps level.\n\na bronze palm for those who had been mentioned at the army level.\n\na silver palm stands for five bronze ones.\n\na silver-gilt (gold) palm for those who had been mentioned at the Free French Forces level (World War II only).\n\nThe French Croix de guerre des TOE was created in 1921 for wars fought in theatres of operation outside France. It was awarded during the Indochina War, Korean War, and various wars in the decades that followed. It is the only version of the Croix de Guerre still considered active, though it has not been presented since the Kosovo War in 1999.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, a new Croix de Guerre was created by Édouard Daladier. It was abolished by Vichy Government in 1941, which created a new Croix de Guerre. In 1943 General Giraud in Algiers created another Croix de Guerre. Both the Vichy and Giraud Croix were abolished by General de Gaulle in 1944, who reinstated the 1939 Croix.\n\nThe Croix de Guerre takes precedence between the Ordre national du Mérite and the Croix de la Valeur Militaire, the World War I Croix being senior to the World War II one, itself senior to the TOE Croix.\n\nUnit award\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Croix can be awarded to military units, as a manifestation of a collective Mention in Despatches. It is then displayed on the unit's flag. A unit, usually a regiment or a battalion, is always mentioned at the army level. The Croix is then a Croix de Guerre with palm. Other communities, such as cities or companies can be also awarded the Croix.\n\nWhen a unit is mentioned twice, it is awarded the fourragère of the Croix de Guerre. This fourragère is worn by all men in the unit, but it can be worn on a personal basis: those permanently assigned to a unit, at the time of the mentions, were entitled to wear the fourragère for the remainder of service in the military.\n\nTemporary personnel, or those who had joined a unit after the actions which had been mentioned, were authorized to wear the award while a member of the unit but would surrender the decoration upon transfer. This temporary wearing of the fourragère only applied to the French version of the Croix de Guerre.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion Devonshire Regiment of the British Army along with 5 Battery RA were awarded the French Croix de Guerre with palm for its gallant defence of Bois des Buttes on 27 May 1918, the first day of the Third Battle of the Aisne. The Croix de Guerre with palm was also awarded to 2nd Battalion Kings Shropshire Light Infantry for Gallantry near Bligny, part of the Second Battle of the Marne. Several other British Army battalions would receive the award before the end of the war.\n\nUnited States acceptance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United States military, the Croix de Guerre was accepted as a foreign decoration. It remains one of the more difficult foreign awards to verify entitlement. The Croix de Guerre unit and individual award were often presented with original orders only and rarely entered into a permanent service record. The 1973 National Archives Fire destroyed most of the World War II personnel records which are needed to verify a veteran's entitlement to the Croix de Guerre award. However, foreign unit award entitlements can be checked and verified through official unit history records. Veterans must provide proof of service in the unit cited at the time of action in order to be entitled to the award. Individual foreign awards can be checked through foreign government (France) military records.\n\nRegarding the United States in WWI, on April 10, 12, and 13, 1918, the lines being held by the troops of the 104th Infantry Regiment, of the 26th \"Yankee\" Division, in Bois Brûlé, near Apremont in the Ardennes, were heavily bombarded and attacked by the Germans. At first the Germans secured a foothold in some advanced trenches which were not strongly held but, thereafter, sturdy counterattacks by the 104th Infantry - at the point of the bayonet - succeeded in driving the enemy out with serious losses, entirely re-establishing the American line. For its gallantry the 104th Infantry was cited in a general order of the French 32nd Army Corps on April 26, 1918. In an impressive ceremony occurring in a field near Boucq on April 28, 1918, the 104th Infantry's regimental flag was decorated with the Croix de Guerre by French General Fenelon F.G. Passaga. \"I am proud to decorate the flag of a regiment which has shown such fortitude and courage,\" he said. \"I am proud to decorate the flag of a nation which has come to aid in the fight for liberty.\" Thus, the 104th Infantry became the very first American unit to be honored by a foreign country for exceptional bravery in combat. In addition, 117 members of the 104th Infantry received the award, including its commander, Colonel George H. Shelton.[2]\n\nIn World War II, the 320th Bombardment Group received the Croix de Guerre avec Palme for action in preparation for and in support of Allied offensive operations in central Italy, April–June 1944. It was the first American unit in this war to be awarded the citation.[3] Members of the 440th AAA AW Battalion (Anti-Aircraft Artillery - Automatic Weapons) of the U.S. Army also received the Croix de Guerre avec Palme (unit award) for stopping the German Ardennes counter-offensive in holding the town of Gouvy, Belgium for 41⁄2 days at the beginning of the Battle of the Bulge on December 16, 1944. Gouvy is midway between St. Vith and Bastogne. Commanding Officer of the 440th, Lt. Col. Robert O. Stone, and Pfc. Joseph P. Regis, also received an individual award of the Croix de Guerre avec Palme. On June 21, 1945, French General De Gaulle presented the following citation to the 34th United States Infantry Division: \"A 'division d'elite', whose loyal and efficient cooperation with French divisions, begun in TUNISIA, was gloriously continued throughout the Italian campaign, in particular during the operations of BELVEDERE when the 34th Division, despite the difficulties of the moment, displayed most courageous efforts in support of the operations of the 3rd Algerian Division. This citation bears with it the award of Croix de Guerre with Palm.\" Soldiers of the US Army 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment \"Geronimos\" were awarded the Croix de Guerre with Silver Star, For Service in the Southern France campaign. The 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters by the Germans they killed, were as a unit awarded this medal. 171 members were personally awarded the medal along with the nations highest award, the Legion of Honor. The 509th Unit colors bear the Streamer embroidered \"MUY EN PROVENCE\".[4]\n\nOn March 30, 1951, the President of the French Republic, Vincent Auriol, pinned not only the Croix de Guerre with Palm but also the Legion of Honour on the flag of the Brigade of Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy in recognition of historic contributions of the Naval Academy, particularly the contributions of alumni to victory in World War II. The flag of the Brigade of Midshipmen does not display streamers for either award, nor do Midshipmen wear the fourragère, despite apparent entitlement to do both.[5]\n\nToday, members of several US Army and Marine Corps units that received the fourragère for combat service during World Wars I and/or II are authorized to wear the award while assigned to the unit. Upon transfer from the unit the individual is no longer authorized to wear the fourragère. Wearing of the decoration is considered ceremonial only and it is not entered as an official military individual or unit award in the service member's permanent service records. Units currently authorized to wear the French fourragère are:\n\nUS Army\n\n2nd Infantry Division \"Indianhead\" – For service during WW I with the I Corps, US First Army, American Expeditionary Forces (AEF)\n\n3rd Infantry Division \"Marne Division\" – For service during WW I with the III Corps, US First Army, AEF & in WW II with VI Corps, US Seventh Army, Sixth US Army Group, AEF\n\n4th Cavalry Regiment \"Raiders\" – For service during WW II as the 4th Cavalry Group (Mechanized) VII Corps, US First Army, Twelfth US Army Group, AEF\n\n16th Infantry Regiment – For service during WW I in the 1st Infantry Division, I Corps, US First Army, AEF\n\n28th Infantry Regiment \"Lions of Cantigny\" – For service during WW I in the 2d Infantry Brigade, 1st Infantry Division, I Corps, US First Army, AEF (Regiment deactivated as of 9 April 2015)\n\n369th Infantry Regiment \"Harlem Hellfighters\" – For service during WW I in the French 16th and 161st Divisions (Regiment reorganized and re-designated as of 20 July 2007 as the 369th Sustainment Brigade, 53d Troop Command, New York Army National Guard)\n\n371st Infantry Regiment (United States) \"Red Hand Division\" / \"Buffalo Soldiers\" - was a segregated African American regiment, nominally a part of the 93rd Division, that served in World War I under French Army command. The 371st was awarded the French Croix de Guerre as a unit award. Following a review of Medal of Honor recommendations, one enlisted man, Freddie Stowers, received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1991 for actions in the assault on Côte 188. During the war, one officer received the French Légion d'Honneur, 22 officers and men received the Distinguished Service Cross (United States), and 123 officers and men received the French Croix de Guerre.\n\n102nd Cavalry Regiment - For service during WW II [6]\n\n106th Cavalry Regiment - For service during WW II - 121st CRS: Fourragère; 121st CRS: French Croix de Guerre with Palm; 106th Group: French Croix de Guerre with Palm\n\nUS Marine Corps\n\n5th Marine Regiment \"The Fighting Fifth\"\n\n6th Marine Regiment \"The Fighting Sixth\"\n\n6th Machine Gun Battalion (Deactivated 13 August 1919)\n\nNote: Only members of the above named USMC units, including attached Navy personnel, are authorized to wear the French Fourragère for their unit's service during WW I as the 4th Marine Brigade, of the US Army 2d Infantry Division, I Corps, US First Army, AEF:\n\nNotable recipients\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividuals in World War I\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbert J Perron (World War I) 5724, private, Awarded French Croix de Guerre with palm, order no. 11.722 \"D\" dated November 19, 1918, General Headquarters, French Armies of the North and Northeast, with the following citation: \"He displayed great courage during the night of October 4, 1918.
