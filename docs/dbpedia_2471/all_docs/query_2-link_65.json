Item # Fra-294 (28)\n\n$28.00\n\n1914-1915 commemorative medal for nurses and medical personnel . Designed by Ovide Yencesse, a well known and respected medallist.

Unit was stationed in either Germany or Austria at the end of the WW2. Lack of the manufacturer would indicate this example was produced in Austria during unit's stay in the region (as part of the French occupational forces) - purportedly by the firm of 'Klammer' (according to French sources). Rather attractive design, multi coloured enamels. Shows age and nice patina. Condition is very good, no damage to enamels. Copper (or gilding metal) with brass cog wheel overlay.

Good quality, no chips to enamels. Great looking decoration. Unknown vintage. 43mm wide. Item # Fra-105 *SOLD*\n\n*SOLD*\n\nWW1 badge for the wounded Allies. These were mainly used prior to the official 1916 (December) release of the Wounded Medal (Medaille Blesses). Purportedly, it was intended as a badge of distinction for all Allies (who qualified). According to our research, there were 3 distinct 'types' of this badge:\n\n- 1st pattern in form of the oval badge with a down-turned sword and a pinback (see image below in Sold section). This pattern seems to be the most common.\n\n- 2rd pattern (offered here) in form of a medal. Rare.\n\n- 3rd pattern in form of a cross with symbols of 4 Western Allies ( USA, Great Britain, Italy and France). This is the rarest of all and likely introduced after 1917.\n\n1st and 2nd patterns used symbology of several Allies (Russia, Great Britain, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, Japan and France). All used same motto: \"GLORIA VULNERATIS PRO JURE ET LIBRETATE\" (Glory to those wounded for right and liberty). All featured red cross enamelled centers.\n\nGreat example of the 2nd pattern, struck in silver. French silver hallmark (boar head) to the suspension along with maker's mark (it is too obscured to make out). We do not know if ribbon is proper for no literature informs us about this. Nevertheless, it is an old-period ribbon and arranged for wear by a Lady (bow). . Shows light wear, spotty darkening. . 26mm in diameter. Item # Fra-133 *SOLD*\n\n*SOLD*\n\n1830 Cross of July (Revolution). Croix de Juillet 1830. Amazing example of the very 1st type of this decoration. There were at least 3 types known along with few sub-types. These differ by inscriptions (mainly) and small details. Suspended from well made Mural Crown. Ribbon seems original. Gold center disks, silver frame. Enamels in near perfect condition (these are usually found with considerable damage), only slight chipping to reverse's red band and minor scratch on the blue. Few minor chips to green but really hard to notice. Decoration is very well marked by Maker (very early mark of Arthus Bertrand or Bacqueville - mark of these firms was quite similar in appearance), 2 silver hallmarks (1819-1838 and 1838-on) along with undistinguishable mark on the crown (it is probably a Provincial office mark). There were only around 2000 awards of all types (not counting the medal of July which was approved somewhat later) awarded, making it rather rare. Original issues (such this one) were awarded to civilians directly involved in fighting against the Royal troops, also politicians and individuals involved in establishing the provisional government leading to the Constitutional Monarchy of Louis-Philippe. Significant award in French history. Item # Fra-144 *SOLD*\n\n*SOLD*\n\nMedallion of the 5e régiment de cuirassiers (5th Cuirassier Regiment).

Item # Fra-135 *SOLD*\n\n*SOLD*\n\nFrance - Order of Saint Michael. This Order was originally created by Louis XI in 1469 with very limited membership (36). This was later expanded to larger numbers. The Order's purpose was mainly to ensure allegiance of ranking nobles to the Monarch, therefore it should be considered a purely Royal Order. Between the 15th and 18th centuries the Order was awarded with various degrees of importance and numbers as the Order of the Holy Ghost surpassed the importance of the St. Michael Order. Louis XVIII made some eleven awards of the Order in 1797 and one in 1798, but did not bestow the Order again until after the Second Restoration when, in 1816, 13 more awards were given. The last nominations made under the ancient Monarchy were in 1828. Louis-Phillipe abolished all old Royalty Orders (except that of the Legion of Honour which was not a Royal award).\n\nOffered here is a mid- to late-XIX century re-make. Older members often had additional insignia made for various purposes, often by means of casting much like this particular piece. Made in bronze, complete with length of proper ribbon and arranged for wear around the neck. Nicely detailed, uniface badge. 65mm x 43.5mm. Very interesting.

Fleur-de-Lis on reverse slightly larger than usual. Original ribbed suspension ring. Ribbon seems original or a very old replacement. Typical enamel chipping to tips of arms, not excessive. Enamels to ribband not chipped. Wreath enamels remarkably intact, all but very top leaves (part where crown is suspended). Nicely detailed crown topped by Fleur-de-Lis.

Also, centre disks are of 2 part constructions (blue ribband is separate from middle) which was consistent with Presidency and all 1st Empire types. Crown is superbly detailed and of somewhat different appearance (because of eagles it is proper for 2nd Empire period). Some very old repairs to tips (good quality with hard enamel - undaubtedly to keep from further chipping). Green enamels intact. Silver mark to bottom of wreath ties (boar head for 1838 +). Maker mark obscured so this one shall remain a mystery. Very nice original ribbon. Great piece for discerning collector. 42.5mm wide, 67.5mm (bottom to tip of crown's cross).
