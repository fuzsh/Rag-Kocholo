        "text": "The Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 was adopted by France on 2 April 1915 to recognize acts of gallantry and courage by members of the French and Allied militaries. The award could also be conferred on civilians who undertook acts of gallantry and courage during wartime and a collective award could be conferred on a military unit or a municipality destroyed by enemy attack. The degree of importance of the award was indicated by the level the recipient was mentioned-in-despatches and an emblem placed on the ribbon. From highest to lowest the emblems were a palm leaf for army level despatch; a silver gilt star for corps level, a silver star for divisional level, and a bronze star for brigade or regimental level. Additional awards of the Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 were represented by the addition of another ribbon emblem."
