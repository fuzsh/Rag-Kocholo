        "text": "The only information appearing to be available for this unclaimed clasp can be found in the London Gazette issue of 1849, where the approved NGS clasps were published:\n\nBoats of ‘Fawn’ under Lieut. Morgan. Action with cutter and schooner ‘Guadaloupe’, and capture.\n\nA search of the Navy List from 1793-1815 reveals a total of 18 commissioned officers with the surname of Morgan. Of these, 9 have a Lieutenant’s commission date after 25 July 1809 or died before that date and can be ruled out. Of the remaining, three died between 1817-22 before receiving a promotion and must also be ruled out. Out of the remaining six, four have entries in either Marshall’s or O’Byrne’s Naval Biographies, two with service records, but these two do not mention anything about the action, which would be highly unlikely if it resulted in the man’s promotion. This leaves four potential candidates, one being promoted as late as 1827, he is probably not the man. The remaining three were promoted to Commander between 1814-16, and could all have been the man in charge. Unfortunately, all died between 1817-43, and it’s not likely much biographical information on either of them can be found.\n\nName Lieut Cmd Died MORGAN, John Fortescue 15 Sep 1806 12 Oct 1814 9 Dec 1843 MORGAN, Thomas 10 May 1809 16 Nov 1814 Apr 1843 MORGAN, Charles 15 Jun 1781 1 Jan 1816 1817 MORGAN, James (1) 2 Sep 1783 25 Apr 1827 1835\n\nOne would have to search the muster books for HMS Fawn to identify who the Lieutenant was.\n\nR-Adm Sir Thomas Byam Martin, GCB\n\nA veteran of the American Revolutionary War. As Captain of HMS Santa Margarita captured the French frigate Tamise, June 1796. Commanding HMS Fisgard he captured the French Immortalité off Tory Island in October 1798. In the Baltic in August 1808, as Captain of HMS Implacable, took part in the capture the Russian ship Sewolod. Served on the ‘Flag Officer’s Committee’ overseeing the institution of the NGS medal in 1847-50. For more details see: O’Byrne (1849).\n\nKCB 2 Jan 1815, GCB 3 Mar 1830, Kt.B 1814, KS (Sweden) 1808\n\nDied on 21 Oct 1854"
