Came to England c1910-11 to work as a hairdresser. Married Hilda Vera Sarah Gardiner Gurney in 1912, the daughter of the owner of a gentleman's outfitters in Hockley, Essex, where he first worked. Eventually he worked at hotels including the Savoy, Piccadily, and Cecil - known to customers as 'Mr Louis'. By 1914 they had one child, Louise, who is shown in a copy photograph (see file) as Louis returns from the war. Louis served as a soldat in the French Army during the First World War, as a sniper, and was awarded the Medaille Militaire and the Croix de Guerre; he was credited with shooting down a German aeroplane near Reims in 1917, from which the clock was presented to him as a souvenir (modern mount). Another copy photograph shows Louis in the uniform of the 63rd Infantry Regiment, with his sergeant, reputedly killed the next day. Later had 3 more children - Lou, Rae and finally Julian (born 1936). The medals etc donated by Rae, who was accompanied to the museum by her nephew Colin, son of Louise.\n\nObject Details\n\nCategory\n\nDecorations and awards\n\nRelated period\n\nFirst World War (association)\n\nMaterials\n\nwhole: metal/cloth\n\nDimensions\n\nRibbon: Width 37 mm\n\nwhole: Diameter 37 mm\n\nCatalogue number\n\nOMD 6551\n\nOur collections information\n\nWe have over a million object records online, and we are adding to this all the time.
