        "text": "Description\n\nInstituted in 1915 for heroism.\n\nMedals, awards, decoration, insignia, documents, equipment, of military, police, private, and irregular military style organizations. We sometimes sell small weapons but we do not sell working firearms. If a thing happens to be military but is hundreds of years old I stop thinking of it as a military thing and start thinking of it as a relic or an antiquity. I suppose that means that “militaria” really starts around the middle of the 19th century or so, when uniforms became normal. Does that seem right to you?\n\nOver the decades I’ve been selling collectibles my market has been about 97% coins, 2% paper money, 1% everything else."
