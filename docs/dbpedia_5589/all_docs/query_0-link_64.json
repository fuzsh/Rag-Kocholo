        "text": "I saw almost none of the Oscar-nominated movies (I really should get out to the mall more often), but that didn’t stop me from voting! (Neither did my ineligibility to vote). Here’s my ballot.\n\nThese are not predictions, by the way. I care not a fig for how the Academy will vote.\n\nBest Picture\n\nThe only nominee I saw was Spotlight, which was very good, so it gets my vote. It’s a very realistic portrait of the sort of people who work at newspapers, and how important to the best of them is getting to the truth of a story, even when that truth may destroy friendships, family relations, political convictions, and religious beliefs. I thought last year’s winner, Birdman, was vastly overrated, so I didn’t make the mistake of paying good money to see The Revenant.\n\nBest Actor\n\nDidn’t see any of the nominees.\n\nBest Actress\n\nCharlotte Rampling. She probably won’t win for political reasons, but 45 Years is a great film and she’s great in it. So is Tom Courtenay, whom I first saw in The Dresser 33 years ago.\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nRuffalo in Spotlight. Again, the only nominated performance I actually saw.\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nRachel McAdams was very good in Spotlight, and I’ve been a fan of hers since Slings and Arrows, but Jennifer Jason Leigh pulled off the double whammy of playing a vicious killer in The Hateful Eight and a shy office drone in Anomalisa, so even though technically she was only nominated for the first of those, I’m voting for her.\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nAnomalisa. Better than any of the live action nominees, I’m sure. Maybe the best movie of the year.\n\nCinematography\n\nThe Hateful Eight. Go 70 mm!\n\nCostume\n\nAfter watching the trailers of all the nominees, I’m going with Cinderella. Not going to watch the movie, however. Mad Max is disqualified from Best Costume because half the cast is naked.\n\nBest Director\n\nTom McCarthy, Spotlight. To a stauch auteurist comme moi, Best Picture is always synonymous with Best Director.\n\nBest Documentary.\n\nDidn’t see any of them, but I bet they’re all boring. For the record, the best doc of the year was Listen to Me Marlon.\n\nBest Documentary Short\n\nWho cares?\n\nBest Editing\n\nSpotlight again, but really, where does direction end and editing begin?\n\nBest Foreign Film\n\nHaven’t seen any of the nominees, but I may try to get to Son of Saul soon, which is playing in town.\n\nMake-up\n\nNo nomination for The Danish Girl?\n\nMusical Score\n\nThe Hateful Eight. Go Ennio Morricone!\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“Simple Song #3” from Youth, a flawed but beautiful film.\n\nProduction Design\n\nThe announcement of this category marks the perfect time to go to the kitchen and whip up some nachos.\n\nBest Animated Short\n\nHey, are those nachos done yet?\n\nBest Live Action Short\n\nTime to fast-forward to the In Memoriam reel.\n\nSound Editing and Sound Mixing\n\nNo, I can’t tell the difference either.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nWho cares, it’s all done with computers now anyway.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nI almost saw Brooklyn, decided it wasn’t worth my time or money, went to a cafe and read a book instead (Bill Bryson’s The Road to Little Dribbling, very funny!).\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nSpotlight again. Not quite the best movie of the year imho but by far the best movie to earn multiple Oscar noms. Btw: the dialogue for Straight Outta Compton is the worst thing about that movie, so a win for the (caucasian) screenwriters would be a real embarrassment for the so-white Oscars.\n\n(Saturday, August 2 at 8:00 on Turner Classic Movies)\n\nIn its review of The Pink Panther, Variety managed to use the word “yocks” twice in the space of four very short paragraphs: “The yocks are almost entirely the responsibility of Peter Sellers” and “Capucine, sometimes awkward and over-intense as if she were straining for yocks…” Good old Variety!\n\nThis month’s TCM screening is part of a series called “Essentials,” introduced by Robert Osborne and Drew Barrymore. Listening to Drew’s valley-girl voice, it’s hard to believe that she’s John’s granddaughter (“I close the iron door on you!”). Drew is very knowledgeable and has interesting things to say (which is why she’s been co-hosting for over two years), but still.\n\nConsidering this movie was released the year I was born, it is perhaps not surprising that I would remember the animated title sequence better than the movie itself. Long after the Phantom (the jewel thief in the film) was forgotten, the cartoon panther was matching wits with the cartoon detective on Saturday mornings accompanied by Henry Mancini’s theme music. The Pink Panther was drawn by Fritz Freleng, one of the animators responsible for Warner Brothers’ Looney Tunes.\n\nExiled middle-eastern princess Dahla (Claudia Cardinale), aging British playboy Sir Charles Lytton and his American-educated son George (David Niven and Robert Wagner), and French police inspector Jacques Clouseau and his wife (Peter Sellers and Capucine) all descend upon an Italian ski resort for jet-set socialite Angela Dunning’s (Brenda De Banzie) latest bash. Inspector Clouseau is on the trail of a jewel thief called The Phantom who always seems to strike at Dunning’s parties. The princess has the eponymous diamond in her possession, and just about everybody else is plotting to steal it, although for most of the film they are all too busy falling into bed with one another to make much progress on that front.\n\nIt’s the Sixties, it’s a ski lodge, it’s Technicolor. That means sweaters, lots of brightly colored sweaters!\n\nMany people watching The Pink Panther nowadays are disappointed that Peter Sellers is off screen so much of the time. In fact, the movie was originally intended to be the first in a series for David Niven, whose womanizing adventurer Sir Charles is sort of a cross between Nick Charles and James Bond, but as the panther tried to do in the opening credits (adding his name to the list of writers, for instance), Sellers stole the show, and all the subsequent sequels, prequels, and remakes belonged to Inspector Clouseau.\n\nPersonally, I like the fact that we don’t get too much of Inspector Clouseau. I don’t think his pratfalls and violin-playing would have been quite enough to carry the whole film (Stanley Kubrick knew how to get the most out of Sellers, casting him in multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove so that the humor did not become repetitive). Contra Variety, The Pink Panther works as an ensemble comedy for the most part, though Robert Wagner turns out to be the Zeppo Marx of the group. The slapstick is balanced by some surprisingly witty and sophisticated dialogue, as when Sir Charles seduces the drunken princess on the tiger-skin rug. That rug alone is good for a few yocks.\n\nThe physical comedy gets more and more elaborate toward the end. Police and thieves converge on a costume party at which the diamond is finally stolen, which leads, naturally, to a whole box of fireworks going off indoors, sending everybody into the streets for a grand car chase. An old man wanders into the city square watching cars go by in all directions driven by gorillas, zebras, policemen (whose uniforms look as ridiculous as any of the other costumes, and knights in armor. The concluding trial scene is anticlimactic, but it does provide a final twist. It is unusual to see a movie, even in the Swinging Sixties, in which an adulterous wife neither returns to her husband nor is punished for her infidelity.\n\nFor all you car freaks out there, that is a 1960 Autobianchi Bianchini Cabriolet, driven by a gorilla.\n\nDirector Blake Edwards started out in television with Mike Hammer and Peter Gunn (which also featured famous Henry Mancini theme music) before making his name as a film director with Breakfast at Tiffany’s. Claudia Cardinale could not speak English, so Princess Dahla’s lines were over-dubbed by Canadian singer Gale Garnett, who would have a hit a year later with “We’ll Sing in the Sunshine.”\n\n(Friday, August 1 on Turner Classic Movies)\n\nOut of Lee Marvin’s 35-year career playing slow-talking henchmen, steely-eyed killers, and hardened Marines with thousand-yard stares, throwing coffee in Gloria Grahame’s face in The Big Heat, upstaging Marlon Brando in The Wild One, going up against a one-armed old man (Spencer Tracy) in Bad Day at Black Rock, lifting weights in Shack Out on 101, getting shot by Jimmy Stewart (or so goes the legend) in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence, and walking through Point Blank, came only one Academy Award. That Oscar was for Friday’s prime-time film, Cat Ballou. Call it corny or dated or schlocky if you must, but underestimate this movie at your peril.\n\nMarvin plays Kid Shelleen, a washed-up drunken old gunfighter hired by Cat (Jane Fonda) to protect her father, who is being hounded off his land by another gunfighter, Tim Strawn (also played by Marvin), in the employ of the English lord who bought up their town for his mining operation. Also helping out, or trying to, are two outlaws (uncle and nephew, though they are about the same age) who have never been in a gunfight, and Jackson Two-Bears (Tom Nardini), an Indian cowhand who is more civilized and sensible than anyone else in Wolf City, a slapstick precursor to Little Big Man.\n\nStubby Kaye and Nat King Cole provide unreliable musical narration, belting out a banjo ballad containing no more truth than the Kid Shelleen dime novels that Cat hides in her volume of Tennyson. The first gag warns us that the humor will not be too refined—the sheriff’s men are testing out the gallows from which they will hang Cat; they tie the noose around a sandbag in the middle, so when it drops it looks like they are hanging a pair of breasts.\n\nShelleen himself is a mess when we first see him. Even after a night’s rest in the barn, he’s still utterly soused, a gunfighter who literally can’t hit the broad side of a barn. A little hair of the dog provided by the whiskey bottle that Jackson “carries around to annoy the sheriff” steadies Kid’s aim and inspires his oratory for about 45 seconds before he tears his trousers and lapses into a sentimental speech about the past glory of the gunfighter (“I’ve never seen anyone get through a day quicker” remarks one of the outlaws). I have a friend who can recite this speech by heart, including every squint, lurch, and high note. The next day he is no better, mistaking a funeral candelabra for a birthday cake.\n\nAfter our heroes fail to prevent Strawn from killing Cat’s father (a scene which would have been a “dark turn” for the plot if it weren’t so funny) they take place in Hole-in-the-Wall, legendary refuge of hardbitten outlaws who have seen better days. As Kid enters the local watering hole, he is given the come-on by an octagenarian saloon-girl. From here, Cat, a sort of Madame Bovary of the Wild West, convinces the others to act out their roles in the pulp novel playing in her head and plots her revenge. The gang rob a train, Kid has his show-down with Tim Strawn, Cat confronts the Englishman and ends up accidentally shooting him, leading to where the movie began, with her in jail awaiting her rescue and/or execution.\n\nThe secret to Fonda’s appeal is how she keeps her mouth at least slightly open throughout the whole film.\n\nSome notable things to look out for include a very well-choreographed square dance that ends in a brawl when the local bigots object to Jackson dancing with the white women (giving the lie to the balladeers’ claim that the town is full of good honest folk), Tim Strawn’s prosthetic tin nose (legend has it he lost his real nose in a fight: “If I was gonna be scared, I’d be scared of the fellow that bit it off” sensibly remarks Cat’s dad), Kid’s corset, and John Marley’s snappy, crotchety performance as Frankie Ballou.\n\nI have two problems with this film. First, the satire seems to go off in two directions at once. It takes place in the year 1894, long after the heyday of the gunfighter has passed, and it is never clear whether the point is that the legends of the old west were never true, or if it’s simply that their time has gone. There are intimations that the kid and his fellow outlaws were once as fearful as they pretend (this leads to some of the film’s momentary attempts at poignancy, as when an aging whore sings, “All my tomorrows were yesterday”) , but the balladeers are creating a legend right before our eyes that is instantly manifestly false.\n\nThe other problem I have is with the romance between Cat and Clay, the younger of the two outlaws. There is a brief moment of rivalry between Clay and Kid that doesn’t quite ring true, but if anybody deserves Cat, it’s Jackson, who doesn’t even try, and I suspect that his race is the only reason the screenwriters didn’t consider that angle.\n\nIf the plot of Cat Ballou resembles a typical western, that’s because, like Dr. Strangelove, it is based on a straight novel, The Ballad of Cat Ballou by Roy Chanslor. In one scene, Frankie Ballou, irritated by Cat’s concern for her safety, accuses her of being crazy, like her late mother, who “saw moon-men crawling down the walls!” It’s a funny line, but in a more realistic dramatic context, it wouldn’t be funny at all. Chanslor also wrote the novel Johnny Guitar, made into a movie, directed by Nicholas Ray and beloved of Godard and Truffaut, in which Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge have a famous showdown, so lady gunslingers would appear to be his specialty.\n\nCat Ballou was director Elliot Silverstein’s first movie after a decade in television (Dr. Kildare, The Twilight Zone). He made four more features between 1967 and 1977 before returning to TV, ending his career with four episodes of Tales From the Crypt:\n\nThe Happening, a hippie caper flick starring Anthony Quinn and Milton Berle; Faye Dunaway’s first film.\n\nA Man Called Horse, in which Richard Harris has his nipples pierced.\n\nNightmare Honeymoon, a hillbilly horror movie.\n\nThe Car, about a diabolically possessed Lincoln Continental.\n\nI haven’t seen any of these yet, but they sound…interesting."
