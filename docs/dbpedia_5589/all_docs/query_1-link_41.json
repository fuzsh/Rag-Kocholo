        "text": "At the top lurks the colliery, a frightening tower of industrial dominion. It represents the power of the company, which can turn any employee out on his year without a second thought. Yet its size also comes to represent the strength of collective action. Ford gradually turns the set from a menacing watchtower into a sturdy platform for the men.\n\nEven this newfound strength, however, doesn’t change the nature of the job. These men work in the most dangerous, cramped circumstances imaginable, in a time before sane safety regulations. The shots of the tunnels themselves, though rare, linger in the memory.\n\nThe Morgan family home, meanwhile, is surprisingly malleable. Early in the film, when the house is still packed with all of its children, it is cozy and intimate. The walls are mostly unadorned and the ceilings seem low, as if the Morgans live in a cave. Their wealth is not in their decorations, but in themselves.\n\nOnce Huw’s brothers and sister have begun to leave, however, the place suddenly seems cavernous. The ceilings tower over the boy and his parents. Domestic scenes become tableaux like these, with shadows lurking everywhere.\n\nEven in shadow, however, the home remains a place of warmth. Huw’s school is a different story. The first of his family to attend, he is instantly mocked by a teacher who refuses to believe a coal miner’s son could learn. The classroom has extremely high ceilings and a great deal of natural light, but it is a place of pompous cruelty.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that Huw decides to forego more education and enter the mine. Yet Ford’s point is not that the men of this village all belong in the mines. Rather, it is about the reclamation of dignity from the high-ceilinged institutions of the British ruling class. How Green Was My Valley honors the lives of those who abide in cavernous homes and work in the perilous, narrow mines. Its visual language, dominated by low ceilings and heights of industry, is an essential component of this mission."
