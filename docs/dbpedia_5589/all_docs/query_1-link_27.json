        "text": "How Green Was My Valley (released October 28, 1941)\n\nDirector: John Ford\n\nStarring: Walter Pidgeon, Maureen O’Hara, Anna Lee, Donald Crisp, Roddy McDowall\n\nProduced by: Darryl F. Zanuck\n\nWritten by: Screenplay by Philip Dunne, based on the novel by Richard Llewellyn\n\nMusic by: Alfred Newman\n\nCinematography by: Arthur C. Miller\n\nDistributed by: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nWorking the Coal Mines\n\nHow Green was my Valley was another film I’d heard about for years but never paid much attention to. It turned out to be a pleasant surprise, but not without its occasional frustrating moment. The first thing that struck me was the musical score. It was composed by Twentieth Century Fox’s music director, the great Alfred Newman. The reason the music was so memorable was not only due to its great lyricism but it contained some of the longest pieces of musical underscoring I’d ever heard in a motion picture. And when we weren’t graced with that beautiful Newman score, the characters (Welsh coal miners and their families) were belting out what sounded like traditional Welsh tunes throughout the first quarter-hour of the movie.\n\nThe film is a story about the proud, hardworking Morgan Family, headed by the stern but lovable patriarch, Gwilym Morgan (Donald Crisp). His large family of six boys and a girl (Maureen O’Hara) live in a small village in a valley in Wales and make their precarious living by working the dangerous coal mines of the region. The story starts with a grown Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowell) saying a sad farewell to his village as he leaves it for the last time. The poignant narrative smacks of seasoned writer Philip Dunne who was nominated with an Oscar for his effort. A scene shot at the family dinner table where Mr. Morgan demands quiet is rendered: “I never met anybody whose talk was better than good food.” Brilliant stuff.\n\nWe are transported back in time to the village as Huw recalls it as a child. The long introductory piece of the film contains the perfect amount of happy memories as Huw narrates to us. Within the space of seventeen minutes or so we are surprisingly settled into the story. We learn of Mr. Morgan’s work ethic and loving family life and even the addition of a daughter-in-law (Anna Lee). We are also treated to a burgeoning love affair between the young Angharad Morgan (O’Hara) and the newly appointed pastor Mr. Gruffydd, played with much sensitivity by Walter Pidgeon. All this is beautifully laid out for us in the small space of a quarter-hour. It proves an example of excellent storytelling on film.\n\nOf course, this being touted as a drama, the good times (if such a thing can exist in a Welsh coal mining town) are not long to stay. We learn that the mine owners cut the meager wages of the miners as they find other men who arrive and are willing to work cheaper. This forces the Morgan family to break up as the sons feel the need to form a union and strike in response to the wage cuts. This eventually leads to two of them packing up and heading out for America.\n\nOne minor frustrating plot point I had with this film was the love affair that began between Angharad and the preacher, Mr. Gruffydd. In true Hollywood style, it is allowed to slowly blossom as one of the film’s undercurrents, but ends with no fairytale finale. One almost feels cheated. But upon further reflection, the way it was filmed seems much more poignant and right; the boy doesn’t always get the girl in the end.\n\nIt is interesting to note our old friend, Walt Pidgeon returns one year later to star as Clem Miniver in the Best Picture Winner for 1942, Mrs. Miniver. Whoever his agent was at the time, he did a damn fine job of placing Walt in some excellent roles. His character of the mild-mannered preacher of the village, befriending young Huw and helping him to walk again (after the boy saves his mother from drowning in icy waters) are some of the film’s highlights. How could Huw Morgan turn out as anything but a superior man when he has the honest and decent influences of both his fine father and Mr. Gruffydd to guide him?\n\nOne of the lighter moments of the film occur when two villagers head to Huw’s school to “instruct” Mr. Parry, Huw’s tyrannical teacher, the niceties of the art of boxing. It is quite hilarious and one gets from it a great sense of revenge.\n\nThe finest scene and surely one of the best speeches in the film comes near the end when Mr. Gruffydd confronts the gossiping townsfolk and elders in the church. Angharad Morgan is not allowed to marry Mr. G because he himself forbids it, as much as he loves her. His higher calling as a preacher forces him to admit he could not support her as comfortably as he would like. Angharad eventually marries the wealthy son of the mine owner, but we are in no doubt where her heart truly lies. Later she ends up divorcing him and lives alone in their large house outside the village. And now the evil tongues of the villagers begin to wag and have created a scandal where none existed. They spread the untrue rumors that the preacher and Angharad have been having an affair. Deciding that the villagers are unworthy of his guidance, Mr. G comes out fighting in his last night in church, giving the gossiping congregation a stupendous and much deserved comeuppance. It’s a wonderful scene and Walter Pidgeon carries the day with his portrayal of a wronged man striking out at those who have wronged him with nothing but the truth.\n\nThe film concludes on a dark note. Death comes to the Morgan family with the dangerous coal mines claiming another member. This time, the patriarch, Gwilym. But through the sadness and loss one feels that young Huw has enough foundation to be raised and live the rest of his life as an honest and decent human being. That sense resonates strongly well after the picture ends and I’m sure the same sentiment was felt by the Academy Members when it came time to hand out the Oscars for Best Picture, 1941\n\n–kak\n\nNot So Green\n\nOne of my favorite first lines of a book is from Louis Sachar’s novel for kids called Holes. “There is no lake at Camp Green Lake.” It makes me think of the movie we watched last night.\n\nThere is no green in How Green Was My Valley.\n\nThe film was originally slated to be filmed in Wales, but the outbreak of World War Two stopped that. It was actually filmed in California, and done in black and white because of the complete lack of green in that location. But it wasn’t just because it was filmed in black and white. Green to me is a color I associate with spring, promise, and hope. This movie was devoid of these things.\n\nThat, however, does not mean I didn’t like the movie. I did, actually. Which is surprising, since I tend to get angry at stories like this. The Grapes of Wrath comes immediately to mind. While I can appreciate John Steinbeck is a good writer, it doesn’t necessarily mean I like his stories. I read The Grapes of Wrath my senior year of high school and only finished it out of spite. There was no shred of hope anywhere in the book and that made mad as hell. And yet I found myself liking How Green Was My Valley.\n\nI am nothing, if not full of contradictions.\n\nThis is another book made into a movie that I have not read. Richard Llewellyn published his novel in 1939 about the Morgan family living in a mining town in Wales. Just two years later it won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. It beat out such heavy hitters as Citizen Kane, The Maltese Falcon, and Suspicion. That surprised me greatly. The movie was good, but better than any of the three mentioned above? This movie reviewer does not agree. I suppose the lesson I am learning here (albeit rather slowly) is that the movie that wins all the marbles is not necessarily the best one.\n\nPolitics seems to ruin everything it touches with its slimy fingers, doesn’t it?\n\nReflecting on what I liked about the film brings me to this conclusion: even though there was a never-ending stream of obstacles for the Morgan family to face (and we’re talking debilitating illness, scandal, and sudden death) they always seemed to rally. There was genuine love between the family members and a sense of pride in the family name.\n\nI’ve been ruminating over the reason why I liked this story better than The Grapes of Wrath, and I’ve come to a conclusion. The Morgan family, no matter what tragedies life throws at them, retains dignity. I did not feel the same way about the Joad family from Oklahoma. Perhaps time and space have clouded my memories (and I am NOT about to reread the book to confirm anything), but I feel the Joads gave up.\n\nThe secondary story of this film involved Angharad and the preacher, played respectively by Maureen O’Hara and Walter Pidgeon. While the attraction between them is evident, the preacher tells Angharad he won’t marry her because he has nothing to offer her as a husband. Brokenhearted, Angharad marries the son of the coal mine owner out of spite and moves away. Towards the end of the film she returns, sans spouse, and the gossips in the village start whispering the salacious word, “divorce.” A rumor is spread that Angharad would leave her husband to marry the preacher, which causes such a scandal that Angharad is the town pariah, and the preacher is forced to move away; but not before delivering a stinging speech to his deserving congregation.\n\nHappy happy, joy joy.\n\nReally, when I come to think of it, no one in this picture has a happy ending. So why did I like it? Good writing, likeable characters with strong spirit, and earthy humor would be a start. While I can’t say I thought it should have won best picture, it was a satisfying and solid effort.\n\n~Anna\n\nNext up: In the Heat of the Night (1967)"
