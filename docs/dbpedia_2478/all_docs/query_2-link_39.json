        "text": "Post by Deleted on\n\nThose of you who visit the Songwriting department may recall my tune, \"The Terre Haute Waltz.\" I'm happy to report that it has made it onto a compilation album intended to help raise money for a statue of Paul Dresser (the author and songwriter) in Fairbanks Park in Terre Haute. It is a project of Art Spaces, Inc., a group involved in sticking art and sculpture in public spaces in Terre Haute.\n\nThe record is part of the \"Year of the River\" project which is intended not only to raise money for the statue, but also raise awareness about the Wabash River, which runs through Terre Haute. All the songs have some connection to the river. There are 13 cuts on the record, and they got a variety of Wabash Valley-related acts, including Roxie Randle, who is on the verge of making it in Nashville, the international touring bluegrass band Diamond Hill Station and young local folkies Yearbook Committee, which has been a SXSW showcase band. So it is an honor to be in that company, and it is for a good cause.\n\nFor recording, we kept it simple. I played guitar and sang, Amy Brockman sang harmonies, Ric Lee played fiddle and Bob Nordquist added harmonica. The song came out with just the right \"lilt\" and if they ever post a link online, I'll post it. I was happy with how it turned out. It makes you feel like you're sitting on the river bank and watching the Wabash flow by.\n\nSo for all those who contributed thoughts about the tune when I posted it over at the Songwriting section, I say \"thanks\" because all the insights helped mold the finished product.\n\nI hope Dean Wormer is ok with this post....\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nCongratulations on the recording, David.\n\nFor what it is worth, I think the repeated 'Dean Wormer' references reveal a chip on your shoulder and an unneeded stirring of the shit.\n\nI know, but after what I considered a rather innocuous post, Dean Wormer sent me a message telling me I was \"in everybody's face\" and warning me that I had \"NO chances. Behave or leave\" and so I really don't have a firm concept of what I'm allowed to post. I feared a post tooting my own horn, so to speak, may invoke the dean's wrath. I guess it didn't."
