        "text": "\"The Furniture\" is our weekly series on Production Design. You can click on the images to see them in magnified detail. Here's Daniel Walber...\n\nMy Gal Sal is a pack of lies. The 1942 musical, ostensibly a biopic of songwriter Paul Dresser, is almost entirely fabricated. Of course, that hardly matters. Accuracy is no prerequisite for the Best Production Design Oscar, which Richard Day, Joseph C. Wright and Thomas Little won for the picture. No one will be mad if some details are fudged in musical numbers like “Me and My Fella and a Big Umbrella.”\n\nThat said, My Gal Sal is interesting because it’s all nonsense. It’s a window into the way Hollywood projects itself onto the past, a compendium of historical kitsch.\n\nDresser (Victor Mature) begins the film in a strict, Indiana home. His minister father objects to his music, so he runs away and gets a job with a medicine show.\n\nEventually he meets Sally Elliott (Rita Hayworth), an established Broadway star. They don’t hit it off right away, but he meets her again in New York City. Their on-again-off-again romance, troubled by his sudden success, drives the rest of the plot...\n\nBut the real Sal of the title song wasn’t Sally Elliott, who never existed. She was Sally Walker, the proprietor of Evansville, Indiana’s most prominent brothel. She and Dresser were involved for the better part of a decade. They fell out in 1889, well before he got famous.\n\nThis narrative fix isn’t just a simple act of censorship. It’s central to the image that the film projects of the “Gay Nineties,” an insistent nostalgia that governs everything from the script to the sets.\n\nIt’s obvious from the very beginning, a brief introduction to Dresser’s music that arrives even before the opening credits. Soldiers cheerfully belt out “Mr. Volunteer,” their twilight song blessed by an enormous floating decal that reads “Remember the Maine.”\n\nBut the Gay Nineties mean more than the Spanish-American War, which didn’t even break out until 1898. They were also a time of tremendous opulence. This Gilded Age is most evident in My Gal Sal’s version of Broadway, where sets mimic the ballrooms of 5th Avenue mansions.\n\nThe final number is deconstructed but over-the-top, its tremendous arches hovering above a palatial veranda.\n\nThis is still how we often remember the 1890s, with its opulent Vanderbilts and Rockefellers. But the decade was not really a time of widespread prosperity, particularly after the Panic of 1893. For most Americans, life did not look like this at all. But My Gal Sal sticks resolutely to the glitz and glamour, conjuring up a series of increasingly overwhelming cakes.\n\nThe stage also gives My Gal Sal’s designers the opportunity to project an image of the era’s popular culture as well. The aforementioned umbrella number includes a backdrop painting of San Francisco’s Sutro Beach, a public saltwater swimming pool that opened in 1896. Thomas Edison even shot a film there. It burnt down in 1966, but would have certainly been known by audiences in 1942."
