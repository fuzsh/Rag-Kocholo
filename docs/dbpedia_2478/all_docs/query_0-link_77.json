        "text": "The runner-up of the top 5 WGBs remains Motown’s Number Ones, while David Ruffin: Who He Was drops to third place. Slipping from third to fourth position is The Blues of Frances Burnett, while Arresting Levi Stubbs slides to fifth, dislodging Marvin Gaye: Phenomenon from the top 5.\n\nThe continuing popularity of the Burnett piece has been a delight, especially since few know who she was, and despite the fact that that she recorded an early Smokey Robinson jewel, “Your Mother Called On Me Today.” (You can find Kim Weston’s later recording of the song on YouTube and elsewhere, but Burnett’s superior original is tough to track down. Try this link, at about 29:45 minutes in.)\n\nAnd so to the many other destinations on the Boulevard, subdivided into the following categories: Stars and Superstars; Songs and Songwriters; The Boss; Musicians and Backroom Believers; Motown Abroad; Releases, Re-Releases, Reviews; Awards and Charts; Books, Movies, Websites; Images and Style; Places; Looking Ahead, and Back.\n\nThe blog post dating is British: that is, the day is shown first, followed by the month and year. Plus, the title contains a link to each particular blog post. Oh, and feel free to add your comments. They will be read. “Unique visitors” means what it says.\n\nSTARS AND SUPERSTARS\n\nStevie’s African Vision (7/6/24) Stevie Wonder becomes an honorary citizen of Ghana, a country he has often talked about moving to.

And then there were those who came back.\n\nTemptin’ Temptations (14/3/23) For years after Ain’t Too Proud opened on Broadway, the show makes its way across the Atlantic to London. And Smokey Robinson reflects on an earlier Temptations dramatisation.\n\nSmokey: Life After Motown, Part 2 (31/3/23) A second glance at Smokey Robinson's post-Motown productivity, involving plenty of friends and, er, a Cracker Barrel deal. Oh, and a gold-certified single, too.

To help, she turns to British singer/songwriter Paul Stuart Davies.\n\nA ‘Monument’ on the Airwaves (27/5/22) Stevie Wonder’s KJLH serves a California community. “Listening to the radio when I was a kid was what got me interested in music,” he said after acquiring the station.\n\nFrom Plainfield to the Motor City (8/4/22) George Clinton graduates from Jobete U, and five town blocks in New Jersey are named Parliament/Funkadelic Way in his honour.\n\nMarvin: on Vinyl and (Finally?) on Film (1/4/22) The return of What’s Going On at 33rpm (premium vinyl, what else?) and the promise of Marvin Gaye’s life on screen, dramatised.\n\nReaching Out, Sounding Strange (15/10/21) Smokey Robinson thought it was too different, and the Four Tops felt the same way.

There’s a Chevrolet Corvair involved, too.\n\nThe Strength to be Strong (3/2/23) “It is a love of mine for life,” mused Barrett Strong about his work and his career.

It took decades to settle matter, and in court, of course.\n\nForward into the Past (13/5/22) Motown sends its hits back to the front line. You remember Joe Harnell, yes? Maybe the Impact of Brass?

Familiar names alongside those less well-known, but hitmakers all.\n\nRepolishing Jobete’s Jewels (4/9/20) Classic Motown copyrights continue to attract contemporary remakes in a variety of styles, while even one or two unlikely choices turn up. Remember the soundtrack music of Berry Gordy’s The Last Dragon, anyone?\n\nTime in a Bottle (21/8/20) Frank Wilson’s signature song continues to be loved – and sold. Plus, its latest use in a commercial, for the premium whiskey brand launched by his daughter.\n\nNorman…Is That You?
