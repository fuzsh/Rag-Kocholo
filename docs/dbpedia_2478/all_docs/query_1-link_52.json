        "text": "The single aesthetic attribute of vintage Paul McCobb furniture is that the designer completely forsook ornament — his pieces have no flourishes. And yet, because they are honest — McCobb’s chairs, desks and dining tables are made of solid wood, usually maple or birch, often paired with frames and legs of wrought iron; the cabinets are traditionally scaled; the seating pieces have historic antecedents such as the Windsor chair — his mid-century modern work has warmth and presence.\n\nYou could call the Massachusetts-born McCobb a man of parts. As a furniture designer, his work combined the attributes of many of his now better-known peers.\n\nLike the work of Bauhaus designers such as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer, McCobb's furniture had purity of form and line. Like the designs of Florence Knoll and George Nelson and his associates, McCobb’s work was efficient and purposeful. And even like George Nakashima, he was adept at interpreting traditional forms, in particular those of chairs, for the 20th century.\n\nMore than any other designer besides Russel Wright, with his ubiquitous ceramic tableware, McCobb was arguably responsible for the introduction of modern design into middle-class American households — if for no other reason than that he designed the 1952 set for the original Today show.\n\nMcCobb, a repeat recipient of the Good Design Award from the Museum of Modern Art, also designed cohesive lines of furnishings, such as his best-known Planner Group, that gave homes an instant “look.” He designed for several companies, most notably Directional, which was home to McCobb’s Origami chair.\n\nIn 1949, in partnership with New York furniture salesman B.G. Mesberg, McCobb set up the Directional Furniture Company, a​ brand known to vintage mid-century modern furniture collectors everywhere. Directional opened its doors after McCobb created the high-end Directional Modern line of sofas distributed by the New York-based Modernage Company. Directional also produced designs by other legends such as Paul Evans and Vladimir Kagan.\n\nAs you can see from the offerings on 1stDibs, McCobb designs are the pin-striped suit, or the little black dress, of a decor: an essential.\n\nFind vintage Paul McCobb credenzas, bookcases, nightstands and other furniture on 1stDibs.\n\nBrilliant self-trained American designer Paul McCobb collaborated with New York salesman B.G. Mesberg to create what is now a widely revered collection of mid-century modern furniture called the Planner Group. Produced by renowned manufacturer Winchendon Furniture Company, vintage Planner Group dressers, credenzas, chairs and other pieces bring honesty and heritage into any interior.\n\nMore than any other designer beside Russel Wright, the Massachusetts-born McCobb was arguably responsible for the introduction of modern design into middle-class American households — if for no other reason than that he designed the 1952 set for the original Today show.\n\nOf McCobb’s cohesive lines of furnishings, his best-known Planner Group gave homes an instant “look.” McCobb designed for several companies, most notably Directional, the New York firm he cofounded with Mesberg that also produced designs by other legends such as Paul Evans and Vladimir Kagan.\n\nKnown for their superior quality and affordable prices aimed at new homeowners, vintage Winchendon case furniture, side tables and desks were must-have staples for middle-class Americans in the postwar years. McCobb and Mesberg’s Planner Group for the manufacturer boasts a wide range of furnishings created in woods such as walnut and maple.\n\nMcCobb drew on the simplicity of Shaker furniture and Windsor chairs and was an advocate for modular furniture. A new homeowner could plan for properly furnishing each room with the Planner collection — a brochure touted its versatility — beginning with a couple of pieces from the series and gradually introducing more seating, cabinets and tables, stacking and combining as needed.\n\nMcCobb shared the limelight with the likes of celebrated American designers Charles and Ray Eames and was supposed to appear in a 1961 issue of Playboy magazine — a mid-century tastemaker of sorts — alongside other designers such as Eero Saarinen, Harry Bertoia, Jens Risom and Edward Wormley. A social and charismatic figure, McCobb can be found in photos from a party that took place the night before, but he was too hungover the next day to join the photo shoot.\n\nFor more than a decade beginning in 1950, the Planner designs comprised the best-selling furniture suite in the United States.\n\nFind vintage Planner Group furniture and other Paul McCobb furniture on 1stDibs."
