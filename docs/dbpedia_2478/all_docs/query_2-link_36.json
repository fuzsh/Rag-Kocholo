        "meta_description": "Paul Dresser has been one of the most well known actors, songwriters from the state of Indiana. Flourishing in the late 19th Century, one of his songs was also designated the state song of Indiana by the Indiana General Assembly. It was this place in Terre Haute where he was born and was raised. The family moved places but only to return here at his birthplace. The house has changed its original location as threats to tear down the building during urban renewal made the Vigo County Historical Society made amends to shift it to its current location. The society now operates the building as a museum but only via appointment. In 1967, the Indiana General Assembly gave the home a title of State Shrine and Memorial.",
