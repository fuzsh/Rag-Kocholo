        "text": "No Nonsense Mid Century Furniture Design\n\nPaul McCobb moved from Boston to New York to pursue his dream of becoming a designer. When it came to design he was completely selftaught but his profound understanding of perspective paved the way for his emerging career as one of the most important designers of the time. Perspective and scale in particular became a trademark for McCobb, whose tables, shelves and even lamps were the result of meticulous attention to the room the design would inhabit. Thin lines, simplicity of form and a distinct lightness characterise the works of Paul McCobb. He was a realist and a perfectionist and his design pieces are a clear reflection of his personality. McCobb’s recipe for no-nonsense design, where only the essential is required to obtain both functionality and aesthetics, is a recipe we respect through our relaunch of McCobb's Planner coffee tables. Details such as the narrowing of the welted steel by the “feet” of the base is how one recognises a genuine McCobb design."
