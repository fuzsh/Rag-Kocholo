        "text": "(1859–1906). In the late 19th and early 20th centuries Paul Dresser was among the leading songwriters in the United States. He is best known for his composition “On the Banks of the Wabash,” which was adopted as the state song of Indiana in 1913.\n\nAn older brother of novelist Theodore Dreiser, he was born in Terre Haute, Ind., on April 22, 1859; he changed his surname in 1873. Dresser held a variety of jobs before beginning his musical career in Indianapolis as part of a medicine show. In the 1890s he began to work in Tin Pan Alley, the New York City district that was then the center of the song-publishing industry in the United States. He composed and published more than 100 songs, including such popular hits as “The Blue and the Gray” and “My Gal Sal.” Dresser died on Jan. 30, 1906, in Brooklyn, N.Y. His birthplace in Terre Haute is preserved as a state shrine and memorial."
