        "text": "Benjamin Goldwasser (b. Mishawaka, December 17, 1982 - ) -- Singer, songwriter, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist. Raised in West Port, New York, Goldwasser took piano lessons, played in the high school jazz band, and dabbled in rock 'n roll. While a student at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, he formed a friendship with Andrew VanWyngarden. As a mockery towards corporate America, the two would sign their e-mails to each other as \"MGMT,\" which became the name of their band they formed in college in 2002. After moving to New York in 2005, the pair went on tour with Of Montreal. About a year later, MGMT signed a record deal with Columbia. With Goldwasser and VanWyndgarden functioning as the core of the band, MGMT has released four very successful albums. In fact, Congratulations (the sophomore effort) reached #2 on the Billboard chart. Their only single to chart is \"Kids\"from the first album Oracular Spectacular. In 2010, MGMT was nominated for a Grammy in the \"Best New Artist\" category, and \"Kids\" earned the band a nomination for \"Best Pop Performance.\" The band has also earned three nominations at the MTV awards and two wins at the Music Video Production awards. Sometimes described as a synth pop band, MGMT's distinctive sound is due in part to Goldwasser's keyboard playing."
