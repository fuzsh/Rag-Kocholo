        "text": "Energy prices throughout the US, 1978-1979\n\nTable 1 shows the price per million BTU's produced in various regions across the country and by urbanization. Table 2 shows the average yearly expenditure for energy over the recorded period for families by region and urbanization. Source: Family Economics Review Summer 1981, pg. 27\n\nNew home sale prices by characteristic - 1970s-1990s\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau's Characteristics of New Housing series tells average and median sale prices of new homes by number of bedrooms, square feet, and also by region of the country. First choose a report by date, then use the \"Search in this Text\" feature for the phrase \"SALES PRICE,\" or just \"price.\" Here is an example of a table from 1979 showing average sales price and median sales price of houses according to the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, fireplaces, etc.\n\nMedian gross rent by state, 1940-2000\n\nGross rent is defined as \"the monthly amount of rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.). This source shows data by state and for the U.S. as a whole. Source: U.S. Census of Housing, choose unadjusted figures.\n\nHospitalization, total average cost per day - 1950 to 1976\n\nNote: This shows the average cost to the hospital per each day of a patient stay (see further explanation). \"Current dollars\" refers to the actual dollar cost during the year indicated. See the percentage paid by insurance, p. 31."
