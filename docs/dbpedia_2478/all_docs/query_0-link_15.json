        "text": "I have lived in Indiana my entire life (nearly 50 years), and I'll admit there is a bunch of information below that I did NOT know. If you like learning new things, especially about the great state of Indiana, the following will be right up your alley.\n\nDo You Know These 18 Indiana State Symbols?\n\nState Aircraft: P-47 Thunderbolt\n\nThe beautiful machine pictured above is the \"Hoosier Spirit II\" (formerly known as \"Tarheel Hal\"), and she is on display right here in Southern Indiana, at the Evansville Wartime Museum.\n\nState Bird: Cardinal\n\nThe redbird is also the state bird for Kentucky, Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nState Flag\n\nThis design became our official state flag in 1917. The torch in middle represents liberty and enlightenment. The 13 stars represent the 13 original colonies. The five stars along the top represent the additional states that joined the union. The big start right above the flame represents us, Indiana.\n\nState Flower: Peony\n\nDid you know the official flower of Indiana is the peony? I did not. Heck, I didn't even know what a peony looked like. I reckon I do now, and I reckon peonies are quite pretty.\n\nState Fossil: Mastodon\n\nWho knew Indiana even had an official state fossil? Does every state have an official fossil? Anyhoo, Indiana's is the mastodon.\n\nState Gun: Grouseland Rifle\n\nThis beautifully ornate rifle is named after the estate (Grouseland) that was home to Indiana native and the 9th President of the United States, William Henry Harrison.\n\nState Insect: Say's Firefly\n\nI think it's a rite of passage for kids growing up in Indiana to chase fireflies in the hopes of catching some, usually in an old margarine container with holes poked in the lid.\n\nState Language: English\n\nThe state language of Indiana is English. I didn't realize we had a state language. I'm gonna assume that most states (I realize not all) have English as their official language.\n\nState Motto: \"Crossroads of America\"\n\nState Nickname: The Hoosier State\n\nState Pie: Sugar Cream Pie\n\nThe sugar cream pie is the state pie of Indiana - it even says so right there on the packaging, so it must be official.\n\nState Poem: \"Indiana\"\n\n\"Indiana\" was written by Arthur Franklin Mapes, who often reflected on his youth and his affection for his hometown of Kendallville, IN.\n\nGod crowned her hills with beauty,\n\nGave her lakes and winding streams,\n\nThen He edged them all with woodlands\n\nAs the setting for our dreams.\n\nLovely are her moonlit rivers,\n\nShadowed by the sycamores,\n\nWhere the fragrant winds of Summer\n\nPlay along the willowed shores.\n\nI must roam those wooded hillsides,\n\nI must heed the native call,\n\nFor a pagan voice within me\n\nSeems to answer to it all.\n\nI must walk where squirrels scamper\n\nDown a rustic old rail fence,\n\nWhere a choir of birds is singing\n\nIn the woodland . . . green and dense.\n\nI must learn more of my homeland\n\nFor it's paradise to me,\n\nThere's no haven quite as peaceful,\n\nThere's no place I'd rather be.\n\nIndiana . . . is a garden\n\nWhere the seeds of peace have grown,\n\nWhere each tree, and vine, and flower\n\nHas a beauty . . . all its own.\n\nLovely are the fields and meadows,\n\nThat reach out to hills that rise\n\nWhere the dreamy Wabash River\n\nWanders on . . . through paradise.\n\nPurdue.edu\n\nState River: Wabash River\n\nState Seal\n\nThe illustration above has been the official state seal for Indiana since 1963. The question that has been debated ever since is whether or not that sun is rising or setting? What do you think?\n\nState Snack: Popcorn\n\nIt makes sense considering how many doggone corn fields we have in Indiana, that our official state snack would be popcorn - made with Indiana corn, of course.\n\nState Song: \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\"\n\nOur state song was written by Paul Dresser, a native of Terre Haute, back in 1897, it would officially become the Indiana state song in 1913. The song is an homage to Dresser's youth spent near the Wabash.\n\nState Stone: Limestone\n\nState Tree: Tuliptree"
