His performances have been called “electrifying” by the New York Times; “gentle, poignant, and deeply moving” by the Washington Post; and on WQXR by Krzysztof Penderecki for “the greatest performance yet of Capriccio per Sigfried Palm”. A 2016 recipient of the prestigious Avery Fisher Career Grant, Jay made his debut with the New York Philharmonic in 2013 and worked with Alan Gilbert in 2016 as the artistic-director for Ligeti Forward, a series featured on the New York Philharmonic Biennale at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Forthcoming discs include George Perle’s cello concerto with the Seattle Symphony and Ludovic Morlot (Bridge), a disc of Beethoven, Debussy, Stravinsky and Pintscher (Victor Elmaleh Collection), and a collection of works commissioned for Campbell by David Fulmer (Tzadik).

With 45 members spanning 20 different countries at its core, the MCO works as a nomadic\n\ncollective of passionate musicians uniting for specific tours in Europe and across the world. The\n\norchestra is constantly on the move: it has, to date, performed in 36 countries across five\n\ncontinents. It is governed collectively by its management team and orchestra board; decisions are\n\nmade democratically with the participation of all musicians.\n\nThe MCO’s sound is characterized by the chamber music style of ensemble playing among its alert and\n\nindependent musical personalities. Its core repertoire, ranging from the Viennese classical and\n\nearly Romantic periods to contemporary works and world premieres, reflects the MCO’s agility in\n\ncrossing musical boundaries.\n\nThe orchestra received its most significant artistic impulses from its founding mentor, Claudio\n\nAbbado, and from Conductor Laureate Daniel Harding. Pianist Mitsuko Uchida, violinist Isabelle\n\nFaust and conductor Teodor Currentzis are current Artistic Partners who inspire and shape the\n\norchestra during long-term collaborations. In 2016, conductor Daniele Gatti was appointed Artistic\n\nAdvisor of the MCO. Concertmaster Matthew Truscott leads and directs the orchestra regularly in its\n\nperformances of chamber orchestra repertoire.\n\nMCO musicians all share a strong desire to continually deepen their engagement with audiences. This\n\nhas inspired a growing number of offstage musical encounters and projects that bring music,\n\nlearning and creativity to communities across the globe. Feel the Music, the MCO’s flagship\n\neducation and outreach project, has opened the world of music to deaf and hard of hearing children\n\nthrough interactive workshops in schools and concert halls since 2012. MCO musicians are equally\n\ncommitted to sharing their passion and expertise with the next generation of musicians: since 2009,\n\nthey have, through the MCO Academy, worked with young musicians to provide them with a high quality\n\norchestral experience and a unique platform for networking and international exchange.\n\nIn recent years, the MCO’s major projects have included the award-winning Beethoven Journey with\n\npianist Leif Ove Andsnes, who led the complete Beethoven concerto cycle from the keyboard in\n\ninternational residences over four years, and the opera production Written on Skin, which the MCO\n\npremiered at Festival d’Aix en Provence under the baton of composer George Benjamin, performed at\n\nMostly Mozart Festival in New York and toured, as a semi-staged concert production, to major\n\nEuropean cities. In 2016, the MCO and Mitsuko Uchida embarked on a multiple-season partnership\n\ncentred on Mozart’s piano concertos. Upon the conclusion of a complete cycle of Beethoven\n\nsymphonies, the MCO and Daniele Gatti continue their focus on Robert Schumann’s symphonic work.\n\nThe Mahler Chamber Orchestra looks forward to a diverse array of projects in spring 2018, including\n\nappearances at major festivals worldwide. Highlights include two tours led by Artistic Advisor\n\nDaniele Gatti focusing on symphonic repertoire; the launch of a long-term partnership with\n\nHeidelberger Frühling; the MCO’s first US residency, at Ojai Music Festival, in collaboration with\n\nits 2018 Music Director Patricia Kopatchinskaja; a semi- staged concert performance of George\n\nBenjamin’s Written on Skin at Holland Festival; and the MCO’s debut at Audi Sommerkonzerte, where\n\nit shares the stage with violinist Pekka Kuusisto in an open-air concert.\n\nThe Mahler Chamber Orchestra has been awarded the Special Mention Prize of the German Design Award\n\n2017 in recognition of its brand identity.\n\n“one of the most fertile musical minds to emerge in the U.S. over the past generation” – The Financial Times\n\n“a natural musical genius who continues to surpass himself” – The Washington Post\n\n“masterly modernist music of implacable seriousness” –The New Yorker\n\n“Hersch’s language never hesitates to leap into the abyss – and in ways that, for some listeners, go straight to parts of the soul that few living composers touch.” – The Philadelphia Inquirer\n\nMICHAEL HERSCH\n\nDescribed by The New York Times as a composer of works “often startling in their complexity, beauty and demonic fury,” Michael Hersch’s music been performed in the U.S. and abroad under conductors including Mariss Jansons, Alan Gilbert, Marin Alsop, Robert Spano, Carlos Kalmar, Yuri Temirkanov, Giancarlo Guerrero, and James DePreist; with the major orchestras of Cleveland, Saint Louis, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, Baltimore, Dallas, Seattle, and Oregon, among others; and ensembles including the String Soloists of the Berlin Philharmonic, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, Ensemble Klang, the Kreutzer Quartet, the Blair Quartet, NUNC, and the Network for New Music Ensemble.

Of the premiere The New York Times noted: “Death casts a long shadow over the recent work of Mr. Hersch … But in On the Threshold of Winter Mr. Hersch has given himself the space to burrow past anger and incomprehension in search of an art fired by empathy and compassion.” Over the past several years, Hersch has also written new works for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Alban Berg Ensemble Wien, the Library of Congress, and Holland’s Ensemble Klang. Other notable recent events include European performances by the Kreutzer Quartet of Images From a Closed Ward in the U.K. and Sweden, and the premiere of Of Sorrow Born: Seven Elegies, a work for solo violin commissioned by the New York Philharmonic, premiered at the orchestra’s Biennial.\n\nBorn in Washington D.C. in 1971, Michael Hersch came to international attention at age twenty-five, when he was awarded First Prize in the Concordia American Composers Awards.
