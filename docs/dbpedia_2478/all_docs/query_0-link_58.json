        "text": "Varner: Act II, a special fundraising campaign debuting in conjunction with a comprehensive renovation of Varner Hall, launched this fall. This campaign will create opportunities for SMTD students to reach new heights in the performing arts. The student opportunity fund will support undergraduate and graduate students in SMTD and provide student enrichment experiences beyond the classroom. These enrichment experiences are a critical component to success, especially in the competitive field of the performing arts, and also allow students to develop important skills such as collaboration and teamwork, creative authorship, design, global learning, civic engagement, critical thinking and the ability to learn from constructive criticism. Your support prepares students to flourish in the performing arts and contribute, in very meaningful ways, to our community and the world. Want to leave your mark on Varner Hall? You have the chance to name a seat in the newly-renovated Varner Recital Hall, opening March 2023. Your gift to name a seat can celebrate your personal love for the arts, honor a loved one or be a surprise gift to the art lover in your life. For more information and to support Varner: Act II, click here.\n\nOakland University student and dance major Aliyah Spears was recently interviewed with her mother WNEM TV 5, where they discussed their involvement with Social “U,” a 501(c)(3) non-profit that provided social interaction and community involvement for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities who have aged out of the education system. “Many of these adults do not have any means of socialization once they have completed their education, significantly impairing their quality of life post-graduation,” said Spears, who serves as assistant director of the Social “U” group in Saginaw County. The group holds a meeting each month that features a theme and correlating activities of all kinds. “Some of our activities include holiday dances, holiday parties, luaus, hoedowns, carnivals, trips to local sporting events, community service projects, game nights, arts and crafts, and much more,” Spears said. “Our mission at Social ‘U’ is to provide a place for these adults to connect with others, have fun, and be their amazing selves.” You can watch the full interview on YouTube.\n\nDr. Amanda Ross joined the OU music faculty this fall as visiting assistant professor of music (trumpet).
