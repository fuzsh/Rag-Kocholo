Paul Dresser

Johann Paul Dreiser was born on April 22, 1859, at 318 South Second Street in Terre Haute. He was the fourth child in a family of thirteen children that included the famous author Theodore Dreiser. The Dreiser family was a German Catholic family, and Paul's father had hopes of him becoming a priest. Paul tried and failed to please his father by attending St. Meinrad's seminary. In the end, though, music was Paul's calling. He left Terre Haute at the age of 16 to pursue a music career, and at this time he also changed his name to Paul Dresser (stage name). Dresser was satisfied for a while traveling throughout the Midwest to play in medicine and minstrel shows. After a while, he decided to settle in New York City to compose.

While in New York City, Dresser was doing exactly what he loved. He was writing and publishing music. He even became a principal owner of the publishing house Howley, Haviland, and Dresser. Through this publishing company, he composed many songs including the Indiana state song "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away." During the 1890s, Dresser was one of the most popular composers of the time. Sometimes, though, too much success can lead to quick failure, which is what happened to Dresser when he became to free with his money. By 1904, he was having financial difficulties, and he failed to adapt to the changing musical styles. Soon, Dresser became ill and died at his sister's house on January 30, 1906, at the age of 47. For such a short life, he had many accomplishments that are still celebrated today, especially in Terre Haute, Indiana. Dresser's boyhood home can now be found in Fairbanks Bank Park on Dresser Avenue with his beloved Wabash River as its backdrop.
