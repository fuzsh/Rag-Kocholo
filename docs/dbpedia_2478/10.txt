Paul Dresser (born April 22, 1859; died January 31, 1906) was an important American songwriter in the late 19th century and early 20th century. He is most noted for composing what would become the state song of Indiana (the state of his birth), a song called "On the Banks of the Wabash". He was born Johann Paul Dreiser Jr. in Terre Haute, and was an older brother of the novelist Theodore Dreiser (1871-1945).

Dresser worked as an actor, playwright, songwriter, producer, and music publisher. He composed more than 100 songs on Tin Pan Alley, in New York City. At the peak of his fame, in the 1890s, he was the most popular songwriter in America. He created his own publishing house in 1901 to produce his works.
