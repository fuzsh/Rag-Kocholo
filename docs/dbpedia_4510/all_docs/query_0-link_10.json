        "text": "WARREN BUFFETT: OK, we're going to be ready to go in just a minute if everybody gets their seats.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nVOICE: Warren? Just want to double check something. We’re just going to stick in —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: One through eight.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nVOICE: (Inaudible)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: One through eight.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nVOICE: (inaudible)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe’ve got 6 or 7000, anyway, sticking around, I think.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nOK. If anyone who has questions wants to go to the microphone, we're going to start here in just a minute. And we will start — there will only be eight zones from this point forward, because we have everyone in attendance in the main hall. So we will rotate around eight zones. We'll stay until about 3:30. And we'll start in zone 1.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Charlie Sink (PH). I'm from Lexington, North Carolina, as you can tell by the accent.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy question relates to the General Re purchase. I wondered — I've read your letters through the years and I've been trying to learn a little bit investing in insurance companies.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nDid you buy General Re, mostly because — I know mostly because of the float — because you think you can grow the float? I know it's not growing significantly now. Or did you buy it because you felt like you could do better with the investments?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI've read, also, that companies who seem to be trying to follow the Berkshire model are trying to get a certain amount of investments to equity — is that something that you focus on? That's my question.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. The first two parts are correct. We certainly — we don't think the float will grow rapidly in the near-term future at all. The float changed, it actually declined very slightly in the first quarter.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, at a level of 6 billion or so of premiums, the paid losses are likely to run at a rate that would cause the float to remain more or less steady. So it will take a period when premiums grow, for the float to grow.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd the premiums would have to grow fairly substantially to have any significant impact on the float. And like I say, that will not happen in the short term. We expect the float to grow over the longer term.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe expect that General Re will probably grow considerably faster in international markets than the domestic market.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe think that their reputation, which was a good as could be found, from an operational standpoint, from a technical standpoint, a managerial standpoint, will be further enhanced by Berkshire's capital strength.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo we think their reputation is likely to grow over the years and we think the premium volume will follow, but not in any major way at all for a few years, at least.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd then we addressed earlier in the meeting, we think there is the opportunity to do better with that float from time to time in the future.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut right now that is not a plus that it's in our hands, and it may not be a plus a year from now. We think at some point it will be a plus. We also pointed out in — that there are some — there could be some tax advantages to be included as part of Berkshire as well. So there's some things going for it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut none of them will have — they will not have an impact in 1999, and they may well not have an impact in 2000.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe obviously think Berkshire, 10 years from now, will be worth more on a per share basis with General Re included than if it were — than if we had not made the deal.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe don't necessarily think that's the case on a one-year or two-year basis. But it is our judgment on a 10-year basis.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie? (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: I would say that if we, in the future, do as — one-third as well with the new float that came to us with General Re as we've done on average in the past, it will work wonderfully.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf you take our past use of float in the history of this company, it would be an interesting study if anybody ever stretched it out.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. My name is Greg Kaza (PH) from Oakland County, Michigan. I'd like to thank both of you gentleman for your hospitality this weekend.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy question deals with price deflation. Could you please explain how technological advances and productivity increases are affecting our non-fixed income holdings, especially insurance?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well I think that, to the extent your question implies — the question, how has technology affected the inflation rate, the advances in technology? I've heard Alan Greenspan make a lot of interesting comments on that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think it baffles him to some extent, but he also recognizes that there's some important, very hard-to-measure factor that has caused inflation not to behave in the way that most people expected, with this drop of employment, general prosperity, et cetera.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I think he attributes it, in some part — but again, immeasurable — to what has been happening in the information technology world.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nObviously, low inflation is good for fixed-income investments, but that's been reflected to a significant degree in a long-term rate that's at about 5 1/2 percent now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou know, it is — it does look, at the moment, like an almost perfect world, in terms of the macroeconomic factors. And that probably is a reason why people are enthused about stocks.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd it's a reason — and it’s a good reason, in terms of price inflation — it's a good reason why bonds have behaved well over the last, really, since 1982.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI don't know the answers to what it means for the future. I have to believe that it's very good for this country to have the lead in information technology that it does on the rest of the world. I mean, we —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt seems to me, as a non-expert, that we are so far ahead of the rest of the world, in terms of the leading — having the leading companies and the money flowing into it, the brainpower flowing into it, that it's hard to think of it — who's in second place.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I think that's helped this country in some very significant way. But I don't know how to measure it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well I would say that Berkshire's businesses, on average, are less likely to be obsoleted by new technology than businesses generally. New steel-toed work shoes? I do not anticipate a significant change in the technology. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I think we have more of the stuff that's sort of basic and hard to obsolete than many other corporations do.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. As we mentioned in the report, we think all of that activity is very beneficial from a societal standpoint. Our own emphasis is on trying to find businesses that are predicable in a general way, as to where they'll be in 10 or 15 or 20 years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that means we're looking for businesses that, in general, are not going to be susceptible to very much change.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe view change as more of a threat into the investment process than an opportunity. That's quite contrary to the way most people are looking at equities now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut we do not get enthused about — with a few exceptions — we do not get enthused about change as a way to make a lot of money.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe try to look at — we're looking for the absence of change to protect ways that are already making a lot of money and allow them to make even more in the future.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo we look at change as a threat. And whenever we look at a business and we see lots of change coming, 9 times out of 10, we're going to pass on that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd when we see something we think is very likely to look the same 10 years from now, or 20 years from now, as it does now, we feel much more confident about predicting it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, Coca-Cola is still selling a product that is very, very similar to one that was sold 110-plus years ago. And the fundamentals of distribution and talking to the consumer, and all of that sort of thing, really haven't changed at all.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYour analysis of Coca-Cola 50 years ago can pretty well serve as an analysis now. We're more comfortable in those kind of business.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt means we miss some — a lot — of very big winners, but we would not have picked those out anyway.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt does mean also that we have very few big losers and that's quite helpful over time.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, the peanut brittle has very little technological change, too. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: They better not change it. (Laughs) We like it just the way it is.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Esther Wilson. I live in South Sioux City, Nebraska.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy husband and I will have some new money in the early 80s of our lifehood. We have a daughter, 50 years old, who will inherent anything we have.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy question is — I also have a four percent interest on a mutual fund that is non-taxable. Are there any better ways to invest our money? (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, those are tough questions. I mean, I — you know, I run into friends of mine all the time where they come into a lump sum at a given time.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, you know, Charlie and I do not have great answers about investing sums of money for people who are not really active in the process.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, if, as we said earlier, if we were working with small sums now, we would start looking at a whole bunch of very small situations and some things that we might know how to do on a small scale.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut for the average investor who wants to own equities over a 20 or 30-year period, we think regular investment in some kind of very low-cost pool of money, which might well be an index fund, probably makes as much sense as anything. But it's important to keep the cost down.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou know, I have close to a hundred percent of my net worth in Berkshire. I'm comfortable with it because I like the businesses we own. And — but, you know, I didn't buy it at this price either.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo I don't like to go — I never recommend anybody buy or sell it. And, Charlie, do you recommend anything?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: I think it’s — if there's anybody in the room who thinks it would be very easy to come up with a one-liner for a great no-brainer investment tomorrow with a great slug of new money, I wish they'd come up and tell me what it is. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe don't have any solution to that one. It's harder for us now than it has been at other times.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, there's been a couple of times — in 1974 there was something in Forbes — in '69, the reverse of that situation. And then, I think, I wrote an article for Forbes — I can't remember exactly when it was — about how equities almost had to be more attractive than bonds at that time. And bonds weren't that unattractive.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, every now and then you can say you're getting a great deal for your money in equities. Or sometimes you can say you're getting a great deal for your money in fixed-income investments.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou can't say that now, so what do you do? You know? In terms of new money, we find ourselves sitting and waiting for something and we continue to look.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut we are forced to look at bigger ideas. So if we were working with smaller funds we'd be much more likely to find something than we are in our present situation.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAs Charlie says, we really don't have any great one-line advice on it. I wish we did for you. Zone 4 —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: I —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Go ahead.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: The real long-term rate of return from saving money and investing it has to go down, from recent experience in America, particularly equity-related recent experience.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe wealth of the world can't increase at the kind of rates that people are used to in the American equity markets. And the American equity markets can't hugely outperform the growth of the wealth of the world forever.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, you —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: We ought to have reduced expectations regarding the future, generally.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, dramatically reduce them, because, you know — we mentioned earlier, 53 percent of the world stock market value is in the U.S.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWell, if U.S. GDP grows at four percent, five percent a year, with one or two percent inflation, which would be a pretty — would be a very good result — I think it's very unlikely that corporate profits are going to grow at a greater rate than that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCorporate profits, as a percent of GDP, are on the high side already and you can't constantly have corporate profits grow at a faster rate than GDP. Obviously, in the end, they'd be greater than GDP.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that's like somebody said that New York has more lawyers than people. I mean — (laughter) — there's certain — you run into certain conflicts with terminology as you go along if you say profits can get bigger than GDP.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, if you really have a situation where the best you can hope for in corporate profit growth over the years is four or five percent, how can it be reasonable to think that equities, which are a capitalization of that corporate — of corporate profits — can grow at 15 percent a year?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, it is nonsense, frankly. And people are not going to average 15 percent or anything like it in equities. And I would almost defy them to show me, mathematically, how it can be done in aggregate.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI looked the other day at the Fortune 500. They earned $334 billion on — and had a market cap of 9.9 trillion at the end of the year, which would probably be at least 10 1/2 trillion now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWell, the only money investors are going to make, in the long run, are what the businesses make. I mean, there is nothing added. The government doesn't throw in anything. You know, nobody's adding to the pot. People are taking out from the pot, in terms of frictional cost, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and all of that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut the 334 million [billion] is all that — is all the investment earns. I mean, if you want to farm, the — what the farm produces is all you're going to get from the farm.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf it produces, you know, $50 an acre of net profit, you get $50 an acre of net profit. And there's nothing about it that transforms that in some miraculous form.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf you own all of American — if you own all of the Fortune 500 now, if you owned a hundred percent of it, you would be making 334 billion. And if you paid 10 1/2 trillion for that, that is not a great return on investment.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd then you say to yourself, \"Can that double in 5 years?\" It can't — the 334 billion — it can't double in 5 years with GDP growing at 4 percent a year, or some number like that. It would just produce things that are so out of whack, in terms of experience in the American economy, it won't happen.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo any time you get involved in these things where if you trace out the mathematics of it, you bump into absurdities, then you better change expectations somewhat.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: There are two great sayings. One is, “If a thing can't go on forever, it will eventually stop.” (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd the other I borrow from my friend, Fred Stanback, who I think is here. “People who expect perpetual growth in real wealth in a finite earth are either mad men or economists.” (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello. I'm Murray Cass from Markham, Ontario. First off, Mr. Buffett, Mr. Munger, I'd like to thank you for being so generous with your time every year at these meetings.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMr. Buffett, many in the academic community call you lucky, or a statistical outlier. Mr. Munger, I'm not sure what they call you. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, you're free to speculate on what they call him. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I know you don't like to forecast the equity markets, but maybe you would dare to forecast the evolution of the debate between proponents of the efficient market theory and value investors.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nDo you think there will ever be a reconciliation? And I'm talking especially about what's taught at the business schools.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd as an addendum, are your designated successors, are they outliers as well?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: (Laughter) Well, we like to think they are. And then, they may be more outliers than we are.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe market is generally — you know, I — to me, it's almost self-evident if you've been around markets for any length of time, that the market is generally fairly efficient.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's fairly efficient at pricing between asset classes, it's fairly efficient in terms of evaluating specific businesses.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut being fairly efficient does not make — does not suffice to support an efficient market theory approach to investing or to all of the offshoots that have come off of that in the academic world.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, if you'd believed in efficient market theory, and been taught that and adapted — adopted it for your own 20 or 30 years ago, or 10 years ago — I think it probably hit its peak about 20 years ago — you know, it would have been a terrible, terrible mistake.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt would have been like learning the earth is flat. It just — you would have had the wrong start in life.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nNow, it became terribly popular in the academic world. It almost became a required belief in order to hold a position.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt was what was taught in all the advanced courses. And a mathematical theory that involved other investment questions was built around it, so that, if you went to the center of it and destroyed that part of it, it really meant that people who’d spent years and years and years getting Ph.D.s found their whole world crashing around them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI would say that it's been discredited in a fairly significant way, over the last decade or two. I mean, you don't hear people talking the same way about it as you did 15 or 20 years ago.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut the market generally is fairly efficient in most ways. I mean, it is hard to find securities that are inefficiently priced. There are times when it's relatively easy. But right now, for example, it's difficult.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThere — I don't know exactly how much it's holy writ, still, in business schools.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI certainly get the impression, as I go around talking to business schools, that it is far less regarded as, you know, sort of unquestioned dogma that it — like it was 15 or 20 years ago.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe University of Florida now has some courses in valuing businesses. University of Missouri's putting in one.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I think the high priests of efficient market theory are probably not in the same demand for speaking engagements and seminars and all of that as they were a decade or two ago.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's hard, though — it's very interesting. It's hard to dislodge a belief that becomes sort of — becomes the dogma of a finance department.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's so challenging to them and, you know, they have to, at age 30 or 40, to go back and say, \"What I've learned up to this point, and what I've been teaching students and all of that, is silly,\" that doesn't come easy to people.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you know, Max Planck, the great physicist, said that even in physics, the old guard really didn't accept the new ideas. The new ideas prevail, in due course, because the old guard fades away, clinging to the asininities of the past.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that's what's happened to the hard-form efficient market theorists. They're an embarrassment to the scene and they will soon be gone. On the — (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nPeople who think the market is reasonably efficient, or roughly efficient, of course, are absolutely correct and that will stay with us for the long pull.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Thinking it's roughly efficient, though, does nothing for you in academia. You can't build anything around it. I mean, that — what people want are what they call elegant theories. And it just — it doesn't work.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou know, what investment is about is valuing businesses. I mean, that is all there is to investment. You sit around and you try to figure out what a business is worth. And if it's selling below that figure you buy it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThat, to my — you can't find a course virtually in the country on how to value businesses. You can find all kinds of courses on how to, you know, how to compute beta, or whatever it may be, because that's something the instructor knows how to do. But he doesn't know how to value a business. So, the important subject doesn't get taught. And it's tough to teach.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think Ben Graham did a good job of teaching it at Columbia, and I was very fortunate to run into him many decades ago.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut if you take the average Ph.D. in finance and ask him to value a business, he's got a problem.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd if he can't value it, I don't know how he can invest in it, so therefore, he — it's much easier to take up efficient market theory and say it doesn't make any difference because everybody knows everything about it, anyway.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd there's no sense in trying to think about valuing businesses. If the market's efficient, it's valued them all perfectly.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI never known what you talk about on the second day in that course. I mean — (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe first — you walk in, you say, you know, \"Everything's valued perfectly, and class dismissed.\" So, it puzzles me. But I encourage you to look for the inefficiently priced.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 3. Berkshire, incidentally, was inefficiently priced for a long time. And it wasn't on the radar screen of — if you asked an academic how to value it, they wouldn't have known what to look at exactly. Yep.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. Zone 5, please.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger. My name is Grant Morgan (PH), I'm here from New York City.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nEarlier, you had acknowledged that it is a more difficult investment and business environment today than it was when you first started out.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy question is, if you are starting out again today in your early 30s, what would you do differently or the same in today's environment to replicate your success? In short, Mr. Buffett, how can I make $30 billion? (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Start young. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie's always said that the big thing about it is we started building this little snowball on top of a very long hill. So we started at a very early age in rolling the snowball down.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, of course, the snowball — the nature of compound interest is it behaves like a snowball of sticky snow. And the trick is to have a very long hill, which means either starting very young or living very — to be very old.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe — you know, I would do it exactly the same way if I were doing it in the investment world. I mean, if I were getting out of school today and I had $10,000 to invest, I'd start with the As.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI would start going right through companies. And I probably would focus on smaller companies, because that would be working with smaller sums and there's more chance that something is overlooked in that arena.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, as Charlie has said earlier, it won’t be like doing that in 1951 when you could leaf through and find all kinds of things that just leapt off the page at you. But that's the only way to do it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, you have to buy businesses and you — or little pieces of businesses called stocks — and you have to buy them at attractive prices, and you have to buy into good businesses.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that advice will be the same a hundred years from now, in terms of investing. That's what it's all about.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd you can't expect anybody else to do it for you. I mean, people will not tell — they will not tell you about wonderful little investments. There’s — it's not the way the investment business is set up.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWhen I first visited GEICO in January of 1951, I went back to Columbia. And I — that rest of that year, I subsequently went down to Blythe and Company and, actually, to one other firm that was a leading — Geyer & Co. — that was a leading analyst in insurance.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, you know, I thought I'd discovered this wonderful thing and I'd see what these great investment houses that specialized in insurance stocks said. And they said I didn't know what I was talking about. You know, they — it wasn't of any interest to them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou've got to follow your own — you know, you've got to learn what you know and what you don't know. Within the arena of what you know, you have to just — you have to pursue it very vigorously and act on it when you find it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd you can't look around for people to agree with you. You can't look around for people to even know what you're talking about. You know, you have to think for yourself. And if you do, you'll find things.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. The hard part of the process for most people is the first $100,000. If you have a standing start at zero, getting together $100,000 is a long struggle for most people.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I would argue that the people who get there relatively quickly are helped if they're passionate about being rational, very eager and opportunistic, and steadily underspend their income grossly. I think those three factors are very helpful.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 6.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger, thank you very much for your hospitality. Excuse me, my name is Yvonne Edmonds (PH) and I'm from St. Petersburg, Florida. And thank you also for being so kind as to spend all this time answering our questions.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI have two related questions regarding insurance. The first is, I suspect that many of us know less about insurance than about equities and I wonder if you could please put some references for us on the Berkshire Hathaway website that might help us increase our knowledge about insurance.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe second question is, perhaps, related to the first, I just — the fact that I don't understand it, but The Wall Street Journal, on March 19, published an article entitled, “When Insurers Pass Trash, Some Are Left Holding the Bag.” And that \"some\" included Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt focused on passing the workers comp trash to, among other groups, to Cologne Re.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd to make a long story short, the assistant general counsel for General Re, which, as I understand, now owns most of Cologne Re, said this is a classic example of an insurance company seeking growth in a very competitive market by writing business outside its area of expertise — namely within workers’ comp — when their area of expertise is life reinsurance.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMr. Graham went on to say, and then I'll stop, \"Don't write business you don't understand. Second, proper controls are critical in the insurance business. Lastly, if a business opportunity appears to be too good to be true, it probably is.\"\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf this is true, could you tell us how this came about? What measures are being taken to see that it won't happen again? And what might be the ultimate cost to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders? Because I gather that the — only the tip of the iceberg has been represented in the charge to Cologne Re.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. Those are good questions.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd let's take the first one first about the website and having a list of reference documents, or something that would help you understand insurance. You sound like you understand it pretty well already. The — (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI can't think of a good book that I've read on the subject. I got my knowledge of insurance by reading — well I got this huge head start by having a fellow named Lorimer Davidson, who is now 96, spend four hours or so with me one Saturday morning in January 1951, explaining to me how GEICO worked.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I — it was a marvelous education, and it got me so interested, in not only how GEICO worked, but how its competitors worked, how the industry worked, that I just started reading a lot of other reports.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI never — I guess I took one course in school on insurance. I don't remember a thing from it. I have no idea what the text book was or anything. It had no value to me.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo I never really had any background in insurance. My — you know, nobody in the family was in the insurance business.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd until I talked to Davy, I really — it just hadn't been something that crossed my mind. The only reason I was down there was because I’d — my hero, Ben Graham, was listed in \"Who's Who\" as being the chairman of Government Employees Insurance. That's —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf he had been the chairman of, you know — he was also the chairman of the Market Street Railway Company in San Francisco.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nFortunately, I went down to GEICO instead of out to see the Market Street Railway Company. (Laughter) It was closer.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut I — my own education about insurance came from just reading lots of, lots of reports.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, I would say that if I started the day fresh and I didn't know anything about the insurance industry to speak of, and I wanted to develop some expertise, I would probably read the reports of every property-casualty company around.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I would go back some time and I would read — I would probably get the best manuals and look at them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI would just do a lot of reading. I used to go down to the Department of Insurance in Lincoln and go through the convention reports and the examination reports.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI’d — they'd give me some little table someplace and I'd keep asking them — (laughs) — for these reports and they'd have to go way down in the bottom of the Capitol to get them out for me. But they didn't have much else to do so they were always happy to do it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that's the way I learned about it. And it happened to be a productive field to learn about it that way. And I really think that something akin to that is the best way now. I can't think of — you know, you can read some analyst reports.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think you can learn something, frankly, by reading the Berkshire Hathaway annuals for 20 years and reading the insurance section. I think it'll teach you something about the economics of insurance. So, I would do it by reading.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd if you can find somebody that knows the business well, who's willing to spend some time talking to you about it, they can probably shorten the educational period and give you some help on that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: The second question about what's been called — what’s the Unicover [Managers Inc.] affair that Cologne Re set up a 275 million — Cologne Life, I should say — set up a $275 million reserve against.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nFirst of all, I would say for the losses to be incurred on that business, the 275 still represents the best estimate.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIn other words, it may be the tip of the iceberg in terms of the loss to the industry, because no one else has acknowledged any losses. This is amazing. I mean, believe me, there are plenty of other losses out there.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe said we were going to lose 275 million. I think that's a good estimate. But I think a lot of other people are going to lose very — they have to lose significant money. Somebody has to lose some significant money besides us on that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd so what we have reported may be the tip of the industry iceberg. I don't think it's the tip of the General Re or Berkshire Hathaway iceberg.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's our best estimate today of what that loss will be. If that estimate changes, I will let you know through the quarterly reports or, if it was really material, we'd have some announcement. But I don't anticipate that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut we'll report to you faithfully, I promise to you, as to how that loss develops over time.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe — what you read makes a great deal of sense about when something's too good to be true, it usually is and that sort of thing.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe distribution of the losses in the Unicover affair will, probably, not be fully settled 10 years from now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, I have seen these things before in insurance and in other areas, but particularly in insurance, where there are multitudes of parties, and there are allegations of stupidity, there's allegations of fraud, there's allegations of misrepresentation, there's allegations of everything.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThere are so many people involved, there are so many factual matters to be determined. There will be lots of litigation. It will take a long, long time to sort out the litigation. In the end, the losses will get paid by somebody. Our best estimate we've put up is 275 million.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut we may find out far more in coming months and years, as to the involvement of other parties or — we can find out a great many things, because there will be lots of litigation, not necessarily involving us, but that we will, as a — even as a viewer of — we will be learning things about what took place.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nUnfortunately, there have been some similar things in insurance. We were involved in something that had some similarities to this at National Indemnity, 20-odd years ago. And it was very expensive to us.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt didn't cost us that many millions of dollars, but it happened at exactly at the time that the stock market was down around the 600 on the Dow, and we did not know how big the losses would be. And therefore, it caused us to have to be more conservative in investing in equities than would have otherwise been the case, if this hadn't been hanging over our head.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo conventional accounting will never pick up the loss that we suffered in that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt was called the Omni affair. And like I said, it had some — I'm sure it had many differences, too, but it had some similarities. And, you know, it can — it's distracting to have something like this that obviously — there was some mix of mistakes, there's some mix of misinformation. All of that will have to get sorted out.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nOur best guess right now is that, when it's all done — 10 years from now, 15 years from now — the 275 million will be our loss. That most certainly won't be the exact figure. But like I say, if there's any reason to revise that number upward, we'll let you know promptly.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt is the nature of insurance that you get unpleasant surprises from time to time.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nLoews Corp. bought CNA in the early 1970s. And just in the last few years, there was a fiberboard settlement on a policy, I believe, that was written in the late '50s. And there was a, as I remember, a billion and a half dollar loss on something where the premiums were a few thousand dollars.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nGEICO has lost, as I remember, $60 million on a book of business that was written in the early 1980s, where the total premium was less than $200,000. You know, how much of that is stupidity, how much of it is fraud, or who knows exactly? But you can get some very unpleasant surprises in insurance.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd unfortunately, this will not be the last one. It won't occur in the same place, it won't occur exactly the same way. But the nature of insurance is that the surprises are on the unpleasant side.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's not the kind of thing that happens when you're writing personal auto insurance or anything of the sort. But when you write business where the claims pop up 10 or 20 or 30 years later — I think we've got a claim, a small workers’ comp company that we have, that goes back 20-odd years, 25 years or so, and it's just popped up to life in the last year or so. And it costs real money.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo it's a business where the surprises can come big and they can come late. And that will happen even with good management. But with good managements, you'll have fewer such surprises.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well, that was a marvelous question. And imagine anybody asking a question of how to get educated — who knows how to educate people? It's the same way you educate the dog by rubbing his nose in it. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd generally speaking, that was a dumb error. That was an amateur's mistake.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt doesn't mean that General Re is suddenly full of amateurs. It was a rare lapse, just as at Berkshire, we think the Omni affair was a rare lapse. I don't think we've repeated it since. Have we, Warren? I can't think of a single one.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: But again, you know, we don't know that we've repeated it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well but —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: These things pop up later. No. No, the answer is we haven't repeated it. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: So yes, it was a dumb, amateurish error. These things do happen. We don't think it reflects a sudden lowering of the intellectual standards of General Re, which are probably the best in the world. It's just one of those things that does happen once in a while.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd there's one good side to these things, it does make you more careful. It really refreshes your attention to get banged on the nose like that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah, and it remains to be seen where the costs of that will be born. Because the entire set of facts, in terms of what was committed to and all of that, it has not been resolved yet.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIn the Omni situation, we had significant disputes on the facts for some time, and we eventually recovered a fair amount of money that, for a time, it didn't look like we would recover.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, you know, the final chapter on this is not going to be written for some time, but it was appropriate to set up $275 million as a reserve, in terms of what we know at this time. And that number could go up. It could also go down, depending on the facts that we discover.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 7.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Mike Seeley (PH) from Summit, New Jersey.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWould you please revisit the question of share repurchase for Berkshire Hathaway?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe have heard, today, your comment about the price of Berkshire having been inefficiently priced from time to time in the past. We know that there are now more shares outstanding.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I'm curious as to whether the buildup of cash is causing you to spend more time looking for investment situations where you're more comfortable on the 10-year outlook. Thank you.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: The question of repurchasing shares — and I made that comment about it being inefficiently priced at times — at those times it always seemed to us — and we were incorrect in some cases — it always seemed to us that there were other securities that were even less efficiently priced.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWhen Berkshire in 1974 sold at $50 a share, I might have thought it was cheap. But I also was looking at the whole Washington Post Company selling for 80 million when I thought it was clearly worth 400 million. And I did not think that Berkshire was underpriced then as the Washington Post Company was.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that has been true at various times when — there have been times when I thought Berkshire has been underpriced, or even significantly underpriced, but at the same time I was finding other things which I felt were even more attractive.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd like I said, many times I was wrong. We would have been better off buying our own stock instead of buying the things that I was buying.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut the — if we have money around, and we think Berkshire is significantly underpriced, and we're not finding other things to do with money, it obviously makes sense for us to repurchase Berkshire shares.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think it's difficult for most companies in this market, even though repurchases are probably at close to an all-time high, if not at an all-time high, I think it's difficult for most companies to be repurchasing — have a repurchase of shares make a whole lot of sense these days.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, I do not think they're getting much for their money, because we don't want to buy those shares ourselves. And it’s — and I'm talking about the stock of various companies in America.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd yet, companies are much more enthusiastic about repurchasing shares now than they were 20 years ago when they were getting far, far greater returns from repurchasing.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe will always — it's an option that we will always think about. And we're unlikely to do it unless we think it's fairly dramatically underpriced because it's simply — we would want a big margin for error in making that kind of a decision that — not want to — we would not want to buy a dollar bill for 95 cents, or 94 cents, or 93 cents.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut there is some level where we would start getting excited, if we didn't have other uses for the money. Charlie.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: I've got nothing to add to that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 8.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Good afternoon. Wes Thurman from Stanford, California.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou mentioned earlier about the power of the brands on the internet. And I really can't think of a better brand, at least in my name, as the Berkshire Hathaway brand.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd, I guess, going forward, have you thought about ways to use that Berkshire Hathaway name, you know, further on the internet to capitalize on the reputation you've built over the past decades as a —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. That's a very good point and it is something that could be of real value. It's already probably of some value to us with the brands that we're associated with.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, I do think that Executive Jet or the NetJets program associated with Berkshire Hathaway, that — Borsheims associated with Berkshire Hathaway, Berkshire Hathaway Life associated with Berkshire Hathaway — I think those brands are enhanced by the association with Berkshire, as some other brands would be.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut I think that's got a long way to go. I think you're dead right on that, that the internet reinforces the necessity for trust in dealing with people.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, you are getting further and further removed from the face-to-face dealing where you can go back to the store the next day or look at the person who sold it to you the next day and get an adjustment or something of the sort.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou're really having to place more and more trust in somebody you're never going to see. And I think you're right that Berkshire Hathaway, if it behaves itself properly, can get a reputation for trust that will be far greater than that possessed by the average company.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that when we properly associate that with some of our brands that those brands will be enhanced by the association.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo I — no, I've thought a lot about what you're talking about there and so have our managers. And it's something that we intend to capitalize on in the future.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's rather interesting, I mean, if you look at the companies that do business with people where there's no face-to-face interaction, either with the company itself or some intermediary like a retailer or anything of the sort, I mean, you've got Dell Computer, now you have Amazon.com.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut GEICO is doing business with, now, 3.7 million policy holders and it'll do — before the year is out — it'll be close to 4 1/2 million, and probably 4 billion-8 or so of business with people that have never met anyone from GEICO, they've talked to someone on the phone.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut we are one of the largest companies in the United States, in terms of doing business on a direct-to-consumer basis. We're doing it with people who on average are paying us $1,200 a year or thereabouts for a promise.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo we have a connection that people that talk about the Amazons of the world, where people are buying X dollars’ worth of books, we’re — have a much more direct connection with people who tend to renew with us year after year.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThat is based on trust. I mean, it's not based on the neighbor next door who is — who they can go to if they have a problem. It's based on the fact they trust this company that's in — back in the District of Columbia, Washington, to perform in the future.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that's a huge asset. And it's growing daily. I mean, we are adding policy holders every day who are signing up with us, who have never met anybody from the company. And that, already, I mean, it's a very big asset. It will be many times bigger, in my view, 10 years from now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe Berkshire Hathaway umbrella that gets involved in one company after another like that, that people trust, I mean, we can be in an awful lot of homes over the years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd as more and more business becomes done on an indirect basis, or a direct basis with the consumer, the power of that, in my view, should grow. And we just have to be very smart about how we maximize that growth.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Nothing to add.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. Zone 1.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. My name is David Zelker (PH) and I currently live in Redmond, Washington where I work for one of your good friends. So if I get into trouble for having taken a busy Monday off work, maybe if I give you a call you could put in a word for me.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: If it's without pay, we won't complain. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: It's vacation, yeah.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMy question is about how you two assign value to certain intangibles that I know you look at when you value companies.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnyone who's read your writings knows that you look for great management and economic moats, as you call them, that enable companies to raise prices and margins.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI'd like you to drill down with us and tell us what, to you, are the signs of great management and economic moats.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd furthermore, do you try to put a dollar value on those management and moats and other intangibles when you value companies? And if so, can you guide us through your thinking there?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd lastly, I'm interested in how you pick your discount rate. I'm actually a — an alma mater of yours from business school and I learned a bunch of junk about beta, too.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI read that you just assign the Treasury rate. And I'm not sure if that's right, but I'd love for you to talk about your discount rate. And I'd really appreciate as much detail about your thinking as you can give us, please.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. We do — we think, in terms of the Treasury rate, but as I said earlier, that doesn't mean we think once we've discounted something at the Treasury rate, that that's the right price to pay. We use the Treasury rate just to get comparability across time and across companies.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut a dollar earned from a horseshoe company is the same as a dollar earned from an internet company, in terms of the dollar.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo it is not worth more, based on whether somebody — it comes from somebody named dot-com, you know, or somebody that — named, you know, the Old-Fashioned Horseshoe Company. The dollars are equal.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd our discount rates, they reflect different expectations about future streams of income, but they don't reflect any difference in terms of whether it comes from something that the market is all enthused about or otherwise.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe moat and the management are part of the valuation process, in that they enter into our thinking as to the degree of certainty that we attribute to the stream of income — stream of cash, actually — that we expect in the future and the amount of it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean it is, you know, it is — it's an art, in terms of valuation of businesses. The formulas get simple at the end.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut if you and I were each looking at the chewing gum business — we own no Wrigley, so I use Wrigley fairly often in class — pick a figure that you would expect unit growth of chewing gum, you know, to grow in the next 10 or 20 years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nGive me your expectations on how much pricing flexibility you have, how much danger there is that Wrigley's share of market is dramatically reduced. You can go through all of that. That's what we go through.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThat is — and in the — in that case, we are evaluating the moat. We are evaluating the price elasticity, which interacts with the moat in certain ways. We're evaluating the likelihood of unit demand changing in the future. We're evaluating the likelihood of the management being either very bright with the cash that they develop, or being very stupid with it.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd all of that gets into our evaluation of what that stream of money looks like over the years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut the value of — how the investment will — works out depends on how that stream develops over the next 10 or 20 years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWe had a question earlier today that made certain suppositions about what could happen at Berkshire. And the formulation was exactly right. The question of what numbers to use is another question, but the formulation was proper. And that formulation — the moat enters into that. If you have a big enough moat, you don't need as much management.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou know, it gets back to Peter Lynch's remark that he likes to buy a business that's so good that an idiot can run it, because sooner or later one will. Well — (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThat's — I mean, he was saying the same thing. I mean, he was saying that what he really likes is a business with a terrific moat where nothing can happen to the moat. And there aren't very many businesses like that. But then — so you get involved in evaluating all these shadings.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThis [a can of Coca-Cola], not the cherry version, but the regular version — this one, has a terrific moat around it. There's a moat even in this, you know, in the container.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou know, I — there was some study made as to what percentage of the people could identify blindfolded what product they were holding just by grabbing the container. And there aren't many that could score like Coca-Cola in that respect.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo here you've got a case where that product has a share of mind. If there's 6 billion people in the world — I don't know what percentage of them have something in their mind that's favorable about Coca-Cola, but it would be a huge number.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd the question is, 10 years from now is that number even larger, and is the impression just a slight bit more favorable, on average, for those billions of people that have it? And that's what the business is all about.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf that develops in that manner, you've got a great business. I think it's very likely to develop in that manner, but that's my own judgment.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think it is a huge moat at Coca-Cola. I think it varies by different parts of the world and all of that. And I think, on top of it, it has a terrific management.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut that — there's no formula that gives you that precisely, you know, that says that the moat is 28 feet wide and 16 feet deep, you know, or anything of the sort. You have to understand the businesses.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd that's what drives the academics crazy, because they know how to calculate standard deviations and all kinds of things, but that doesn't tell them anything. And that what really tells you something is if you know how to figure out how wide the moat is and whether it's likely to widen further or shrink on you.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well, you aren't sufficiently critical of the academic approach. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe academic approach to portfolio management, corporate finance, et cetera, et cetera, is very interesting. It's a lot like Long-Term Capital Management. How can people so smart do such silly things? And yet, that's the way it is.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: That's the great book that needs to be written, really, is, you know, why do smart people do dumb things?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd it's terribly important, because we've got a lot of smart people working with us and, you know, if we can just exorcise all the dumb things, you know, it's just amazing what'll happen.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd to some extent, the record of Berkshire, to the extent it's been good, has been because we — not because we've done brilliant things, but we've probably done fewer dumb things than most people.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut why smart people do things that are against their self-interest is really puzzling. Charlie, tell me why. (Laughs)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Well the — you can argue that the very worst of the academic inanity is in the liberal arts departments of the great universities.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd there, if you ask the question, what one frame of mind is likely to do an individual the most damage to his happiness, to his contribution to others — what one frame of mind will be the worst?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd the answer would be some sort of paranoid self-pity. Couldn't imagine a more destructive frame of mind. Now you have whole departments that want everyone to feel a victim. And you pay money to send your children to places where this is what they teach them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's amazing how these pockets of irrationality creep into these eminent places.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nOne of the reasons I like the Berkshire meetings is I find fewer of those silly people. (Laughter and applause)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: He excluded the head table from (inaudible). (Laughs)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Zone 2.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Gaylord Hanson. I'm from Santa Barbara, California.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd I'm a rookie as an investor with Berkshire Hathaway, because I only started investing last November. And if this is a typical annual meeting, I will be here every first Monday of May the rest of my life. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: And we'll be glad to have you. Thanks. (Applause)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Now I'm very proud to have finally uncovered Berkshire Hathaway and am an investor. But I may have made a slight error in which issue to buy, A or B.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI watch my investments rather closely, and I do believe in buying and holding. I don't buy and trade at all. I buy — I've got things I bought 10, 15 years ago, and I still have them, and I've made a lot of money.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut I made an — I make an analysis, every December 31st, on my portfolio. And I looked at Hathaway A and I looked at Hathaway B on January 1st, and again on the 23rd of April. Hathaway A was up 10 percent since January 1st. Hathaway B was 5.3 percent. Now I don't like that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nNow, I must confess that I'm not inclined to buy a $77,000 stock and buy one of your 5 or 10 shares. But in this instance, because I bought a fair little bit of it, I bought the B and my increase in value, per share, is 4.7 percent less in B than in A. And I got to have that explained to me — (laughter) — by Mr. Buffett.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. (Applause)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Have one other — one further comment. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nYou mentioned the 30 times the B being an A value. Well, if I multiply the value on the 23rd of May — of April — of $2,474 per share by 30, I come up with 74,220 but the price of A was 77,000.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nNow I want to know whether I'm stupid or some good intelligent answer from Mr. Buffett.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. The — (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIf you read what we've got, both in the original offering on the B, as well as on the website, explaining everything, the A can always be converted into 30 shares of B.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, it can't sell for anything other than a very tiny amount less than 30 shares of B. And if it went below that, arbitrage would occur. But it doesn't convert the other way.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo there's no question that, whereas a share of B can never be worth more than about 1/30th of A, it can be worth less, because the conversion doesn't run the other way.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nNow at year-end, I didn't look at the prices, but obviously the A and B were at almost parity, or probably at parity from what you say.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd at that level we say that if you're buying at least 30 shares of B, you're better off buying the A because you can always go — you can always convert it into 30 shares of B. And without having paid any premium, you can't lose money and you can gain money if the B goes to a discount.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThe B will periodically go to a discount against the A. It depends on the supply and demand of the two securities. The B will not go to a premium above the A of any significant amount because then conversion occurs. And we've had a lot of conversion occur.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI have personally said on the website, for example, that I think when the B is at more than a two percent I would rather buy the B, if it was me.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut if it's at less than a two percent discount, I'd probably buy the A, because I just think that you've always got the right to go one direction and you don't have the right to go the other direction.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI would predict, as I think I did just a little earlier, that if you take the next 10 years, you're going to find a significant number of months when the two stocks trade at parity, at 30-to-1 relationship, and you're going to find a significant number of months when the B sells at a discount.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWhen people who are buying smaller amounts are the more aggressive buyers of the stock, they will push the B up to the point where A gets converted into B. And that means that the B is selling at a slight, very slight, premium over the A.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd when you find times when people are, on balance, preferring their larger buyers, maybe institutional buyers, then the A will tend to sell at some premium.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI think that — you may have picked on April 23rd. My guess is it's narrowed a little bit, because I think it's a 3-and-a-fraction percent discount at the moment.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut I would sort of use that guideline I stuck on the website, although there's nothing magical about it. Those will be the prevailing facts.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI mean, if the B is selling at 2,500 and the A is selling at 75,000, a 30-to-1 relationship, and you were buying at least $75,000 worth of stock, I'd advise you to buy the A because you — the next day, if you wanted to you could convert it into 30 shares of B. And —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut you can't buy 30 shares of B and convert it into one share of A.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, I'm not sure on the day you actually bought — if you bought B, it sounds as if you did — on the day that you actually bought B, I don't whether you were buying it at a discount or not. Most of the time last year it did not sell at a discount.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nMost of the time this year it has sold at a discount. There will be times when it will sell at parity and there will be times when it sells at a discount.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCharlie?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. When you made your original decision to buy the lower priced of the two stocks, you made a mistake. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Well, if he was buying at least 30 shares —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah. Yeah. If you were buying at least 30 shares.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd now that the stock, the B stock, is down to such a discount versus the A, Warren is saying he would hold the B. What could be simpler? (Applause and laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: We'll try and make both the A and B work out fine. (Laughs)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut it — there — you should understand the relationship of the two. And we tried to be extremely clear about that when we brought up — we had a page that — which we devoted precisely to that point.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd we have put — I put this thing up on the website because I was getting some mail that was questioning this. People clearly didn't understand it, so I put this up on the website.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd if you click on the — our homepage, you will see some reference to something else you can click that says the relative situation on the A and B. And I hope it's clear.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: OK. Zone 3.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Gentlemen, hi, I'm David Butler from here in Omaha. A comment and then two quick questions. Comment is regarding the annual reports.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI read a lot of annual reports for a living, and I sort of start off with the assumption that I'm going to have to spend 20 to 30 hours looking at 5 years of 10-Ks and 5 years of annuals, probably some 10-Qs and going through a lot of numbers to have any kind of idea how the company really is working.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd comparing that to Berkshire, which has basically crystal-clear clarity, it's quite refreshing to read honesty, and it's quite refreshing to see accounting that's actually presented in a clear fashion and that doesn't try to hide facts.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo as a shareholder and as an investor, I'm very grateful for the effort and for the high quality of your annual report. And I think we ought to give Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger a hand — (applause) — for that.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nOK, now that I've brown-nosed a little bit. (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Here comes the zinger, huh? (Laughter)\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yeah. I'm nervous about the derivative operations that General Re has. Now, right now the balance sheet figure says that there's a $400 million net asset position, but there are also some really hairy derivatives, the swaps and the floors and caps.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd knowing that, in the past, you haven't used those types of leveraged derivatives, I'm wondering if that's going to change now.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd then secondly, in terms of going through an intrinsic value calculation, when you and Mr. Munger think about intrinsic value, obviously, a big part of that is the marketable securities portfolio.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nDo you think of intrinsic value, in terms of the marketable securities, as what their market value is, in terms of their look-through earnings, or is there a separate intrinsic value calculation that you sort of roll into the overall Berkshire intrinsic calculation?\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: Yeah. I'll answer the second part first. On the intrinsic value, we tend to use the market prices in the way we think about things, although there are times when we feel that we own securities that are worth far more than they're carried for.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd we've mentioned that once or twice. There was a time in the mid-1970s, if you'd look back at our 1975 annual report — I may be off by a year, one direction or other — probably 1974, because I — we valued the securities at market.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut I — in the body of the report, I said we really think these things are going to worth — be worth a hell of a lot more than they're selling for currently. That was an unusual remark for somebody, if you knew me, that would be an unusual remark for me.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd at that time, I would have said that, in looking at the intrinsic value of Berkshire, I would have said that I was quite comfortable marking these things up in my mind. I wouldn't have done it with the public, but I would have done it in my mind.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nBut under most circumstances, we tend to think of the market value as being representative of it, that that is the price at which we could buy or sell that day.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd if we thought they were ridiculously high in relation to intrinsic value, we'd probably do something about it. And they certainly haven't been so low that we've ever felt like marking them up in recent — in our own minds — in recent years.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: The question about the derivatives business, it's a good business — it's a good question — because it involves big balance sheet numbers and big off-balance sheet numbers in relation to the amount of money made, and particularly in terms — in relation to the amount of money made in terms of the capital employed.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd the credit guarantees, the long-term nature, all of that makes that something that we will want — we do want to look at always very hard.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nIt's a business that people can get in trouble in and they can get in trouble while the accounting sails along merrily.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nI remember when Charlie and I were at Salomon, we found — we didn't find it, other people found it finally, but — mismarked derivative positions that were very substantial that had gone on for a long period of time.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAnd this was with paying a lot of money to auditors to look at them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nAm I right about that, Charlie, on that? Charlie was on the audit committee.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: The worst glitches were that the books just got so out of control, not in the derivative department, but there were just multimillion dollar errors.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: But we found mismarks, as I remember —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yes.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: — in the 20-odd millions on —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yes.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: — positions —\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nCHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. Both.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nWARREN BUFFETT: In some cases, because the contracts got so complicated that the people that were valuing them didn't understand them, and — at least partially didn't understand them.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nThere's a lot of potential for mischief when people can write down a few numbers on a piece of paper and nothing changes hands for a long time and their compensation, you know, next month and this year, depends on what numbers are attached to a bunch of things that are not really — where they don't come to fruition for a long time. And particularly when you're guaranteeing credit or anything of the sort.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph\n\nSo, you're very correct in observing that, when the numbers are big in relation to the amount of profits, you want to look very carefully, because if anything goes wrong, it could go wrong on a fairly big scale, and you're not getting paid a lot for running that type of risk.\n\nSync Video to Paragraph"
