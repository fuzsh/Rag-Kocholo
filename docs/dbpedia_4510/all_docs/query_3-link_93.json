        "text": "\"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round\" is swell. So is \"Itsy Bitsy Spider.\"\n\nBut to be honest, they'd be lucky to squeak by with a 40 on \"American Bandstand.\" They don't have a good beat. And you can't dance to them.\n\nUnlike \"Uptown Funk,\" \"American Girl,\" \"Twist and Shout,\" and a dozen other songs that are part of the curriculum of Songs for Seeds, a franchise for pre-schoolers that is opening up its first Jersey location in Ridgewood starting Sept. 4.\n\nThey're adding rock and roll to the children's formula.\n\n\"We like to call it Not Your Mama's Music Program,\" said owner Courtney Karasin. \"We do the Beatles, we do Justin Timberlake, we do Elvis.\"\n\nA rock-flavored pre-school program\n\nThis singing and activities program for kids five and under — and their parents — is infused with a rock sensibility. Not just in the choice of cover tunes played by the guitarist-singer who leads the sessions, but in the original music created for the franchise. \"It's all early education, based on this rock vibe,\" Karasin said.\n\nEven the \"welcome song\" that's sung each session has a jazzy feel. \"Welcome, welcome, everybody welcome, so glad you're here...\"\n\nAnother original song, \"Join the Band,\" has a beat straight out of Queen's \"We Will Rock You.\" \"Knees knees clap, knees knees clap,\" Karasin said. \"It leads us to talking about instruments. We hand out kids' instruments: tambourines, maracas.\"\n\nThere are currently up to a dozen Songs for Seeds locations — including two in Connecticut, and two in Long Island, owned by Karasin. The Ridgewood location is her fifth, and first in this state. The 45-minute classes, held at the Ridgewood YMCA at 112 Oak Street, run for 10 consecutive Wednesdays at 9:30, 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. The full semester is $350. \"We offer a 20 percent sibling discount, and we also pro-rate classes, if someone wants to join after we start,\" Karasin said (they also can be hired to host classes elsewhere).\n\nParents are included\n\nThe concept here, Karasin said, was not merely to create a more cutting-edge version of the usual pre-school program — one that today's kids would appreciate.\n\nIt was also to appeal to parents, who attend these weekly sessions with their tots. There's only so many times an adult can listen to \"Old MacDonald\" without reaching for the Ibuprofen.\n\n\"Instead of just something people would take their kids to, we wanted it to be fun for parents as well as kids,\" Karasin said. \"Something they would both enjoy coming to. So let's make it current, let's make it exciting, let's make it educational. And the fun thing is, a lot of these kids, once they become two and up, they recognize these cover songs on a lot of shows. So if they hear 'Shake It Off' or 'Uptown Funk' on TV or on the radio, they're so excited by it.\"\n\nSongs for Seeds takes off from another business, Apple Seeds, founded in New York a dozen or more years ago. It's a series of all-in-one play spaces designed with urban families in mind.\n\n\"It was for families in cities that didn't have backyards and places for their kids to play in cold weather,\" Karasin said. As part of its menu, Apple Seeds offered science activities, art activities, cooking activities — and music activities, under the rubric 'Songs for Seeds.' That was the program that took off. \"It became this big runaway success and they decided to start franchising it,\" she said.\n\nA background in pop\n\nKids who attend Songs for Seeds get more than a survey course in American pop music. Though that part definitely appeals to Karasin, a Westchester resident who got her own professional start at MTV, where she worked from 2008 to 2016. \"I wanted to work in some field I really felt connected to,\" she said. \"The whole rock vibe, working with young musicians, which I did a lot at MTV — there's certainly a connection there. Plus I love working with children.\" (She has three of her own: a six-year-old, a four-year-old and a five-week-old).\n\nIn addition to the covers, which the gamut from Pat Benatar to Van Morrison to Taylor Swift to the Beatles to the Jackson 5, there is also a lot of bespoke material by franchise songwriter Mister Ray. There are songs that teach numbers and letters and shapes. There is a song about how to give a high-five — a thrilling new concept for any three-year-old hipster. There are songs about Roy G. Biv, and the colors of the spectrum.\n\n\"We take a trip around the world every week,\" she said. \"We hear a song from a different country, and we put the lights down low and we have a strobe light and everybody puts out their plane wings, and then we take an imaginary trip.\"\n\nAnd there are also songs that incorporate games. Which, in turn, incorporate learning.\n\nName that snout\n\n\"We have a spinning wheel where we uncover the parts of an animal, bit by bit,\" Karasin said. \"We sing a song. 'Let's spin the wheel and make a match, we'll find an animal front and back...' And they're uncovered, one part at a time. We reinforce animal sounds, for kids, with the visual way the animal looks.\"\n\nPart of the rock and roll attitude of Songs for Seeds is that kids don't have to participate in any activity. They can Do Their Own Thing.\n\nBut whether they choose to tune in, turn on, or drop out, they'll certainly come away with something worthwhile, Karasin said.\n\n\"This is really an open space, for kids to explore for themselves,\" she said. \"Which is different for every child. A lot of the little ones that aren't in the front of the room engaging, are the ones who go home and repeat the entire class for their parents.\"\n\nFor more information"
