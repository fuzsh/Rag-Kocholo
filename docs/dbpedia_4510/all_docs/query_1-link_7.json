        "text": "My newborn is always making grunting sounds and squirming while sleeping. Why is my baby moving or making noises while sleeping? #anchor\n\nNewborns go through two different sleep cycles: quiet sleep and active sleep, and they spend about half of their sleeping time in each.(1,2,3) Active sleep is similar to REM sleep for adults, but there is one huge difference:⁣\n\nFor adults, our skeletal muscles are paralyzed during this stage — for young babies, they are not. Instead, babies move around, make noise (grunting noises and cries), and sometimes even open their eyes, all while they're actually sleeping!(1,3)\n\nDuring these early months, your baby’s brain and body are still working hard to learn vital skills, like digestion, even when they’re sleeping. With all of that hard work and development happening during active sleep, we can expect to see your baby consistently moving as well as making grunting sounds, moaning, and even occasionally crying out.\n\nIf you heard that in the night, would you hop out of bed and immediately pick up that baby? Did you know that doing this could be unintentionally waking your baby at night? Let me explain.\n\nAll of these babies are moving and may even cry out. But...they are all asleep! This is active sleep. Active sleep can be why you swear your baby is awake from 3:00-6:00 am “fighting the swaddle” or struggling with gas. If you mistake this active sleep period as baby being awake and jump in right away, you may accidentally wake your baby!⁣\n\nSo, if you’re hearing your baby making grunting sounds, moaning, or whimpering in their sleep, know that these are typically normal newborn active sleep sounds. However, if your baby is sick, sounds congested, or you’re concerned about whether what you’re hearing is normal, please check with your pediatrician.\n\nWait, Cara! Are you telling me not to go help my crying baby in the night?#anchor\n\nNo! Not at all! If your baby needs you, you will respond. But before we respond, we simply stop and observe.\n\nTake a moment to listen to your baby before you react. Give your baby 30-60 seconds before you rush to pick them up. This will help determine if your baby is just going through that active sleep or if your baby is actually awake!⁣\n\nShould I ever be concerned about my baby making noises while sleeping?#anchor\n\nAlthough many noises your newborn makes during active sleep are completely normal, there are some noises that may be cause for concern. If you're seeing any of the following, it's time to call your doctor or seek medical attention:\n\nHigh-pitched, squeaking sounds(4)\n\nRapid breathing that is greater than 60 breaths per minute(5) and lasting more than a few seconds or happening repeatedly throughout the night.\n\nStruggling to breathe. This may look like retractions (ie. sucking in between or underneath your baby's ribs), grunting after every breath(5), or labored breathing.\n\nI understand it may be difficult to know what’s a normal sign of active sleep and what may be something more. If you have any concerns about your baby, please always talk with your pediatrician.\n\nHow long does newborn active sleep last? #anchor\n\nNewborns spend nearly half of their sleep time in active sleep.(1,3) With newborn sleep cycles lasting about 50 minutes, nearly 25 of those minutes are in active sleep.\n\nWhen do babies outgrow active sleep?#anchor\n\nYou’ll likely notice that your baby is making much less noise while sleeping after those newborn months have passed. Around the time your baby is 3-5 months old, their sleep cycles begin to shift into more adult-like sleep stages.(2,3) It’s during this change that active sleep decreases.\n\nMy baby is active, noisy, and making grunting sounds in their sleep. And with all of this going on, I can’t sleep! What can I do? #anchor\n\nYour sleep is vital to the overall well-being of you AND your baby. So, now that you know all about newborn active sleep, here are some tips for how to make it less disruptive during the night:\n\nMove the bassinet farther away from you. (Think across the room or even in your closet or bathroom if it’s well-ventilated.)\n\nSet up the sound machine (use code CARA20 for 20%) between you and your baby.\n\nTurn down the volume on the monitor if your baby is sleeping in a different room.\n\nAre you wondering about when to move your baby into their own room? My blog about room sharing goes into depth about the research regarding room sharing and will help you decide when the time is right. When you're ready, here's a step-by-step guide to transition baby from your room to the nursery.\n\nIf you need more help with your baby's sleep, my no-cry Will I Ever Sleep Again? newborn class will give you the tools you need. I’ll guide you every step along the way in laying a healthy sleep foundation for your little one."
