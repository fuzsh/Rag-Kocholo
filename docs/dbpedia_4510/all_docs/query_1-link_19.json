        "text": "What is autism?\n\nAutism, now called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder. ASD is a developmental disability caused by differences in your child’s brain. People with ASD may behave, interact and learn in ways that are different from other people. They may have trouble with social interactions and with interpreting and using nonverbal and verbal communication.\n\nAutism definition\n\nAutism means your child may have:\n\nDifficulties interacting with other people or differences in how they interact with others.\n\nTrouble using and understanding nonverbal communication, like eye contact, gestures and facial expressions.\n\nDelayed or absent language development.\n\nTrouble forming and understanding relationships.\n\nRepetitive motor behaviors, like flapping arms, body rocking or repetitive speech or play.\n\nInsistence on sameness in environment or routine.\n\nIntense or unusual interests.\n\nSensory aversions, like dislike of loud noises, or sensory-seeking behaviors.\n\nHow well your child can function in day-to-day life depends on the severity of their symptoms. Given that ASD varies widely in severity and everyday impairment, the symptoms of some people aren’t always easily recognized.\n\nAutism vs. autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — what’s the difference?\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association changed the term autism to autism spectrum disorder in 2013. ASD is now an umbrella term that covers the different levels of autism. The autism spectrum includes conditions that providers used to consider separate, including:\n\nAutism.\n\nAsperger syndrome.\n\nPervasive developmental disorder — not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).\n\nAsperger vs. autism — what’s the difference?\n\nHealthcare providers don’t officially recognize Asperger syndrome as its own condition anymore. They used to consider Asperger and autism as different conditions. The symptoms that were once part of an Asperger’s diagnosis now fall under the autism spectrum. Providers consider Asperger’s a mild form of autism. Some people still use the term Asperger’s syndrome to describe their condition.\n\nWhat is high-functioning autism?\n\nHigh-functioning autism isn’t an official medical diagnosis. However, some people use the term to describe a mild form of autism that requires lower levels of support. People on the mild end of the autism spectrum can speak, read, write and handle basic life skills. Providers used to call this Asperger syndrome.\n\nAutism vs. ADHD — is ADHD on the autism spectrum?\n\nAutism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have many similarities, but ADHD isn’t on the autism spectrum. The symptoms of ADHD and autism can overlap. Both conditions cause children to have trouble paying attention, and both can affect their social skills. These overlapping symptoms can sometimes lead to incorrect diagnoses.\n\nADHD and autism are related genetically, as well. Having one of these conditions increases your child’s risk of having the other. And a child with autism has a higher chance of having a close relative with ADHD.\n\nHow common is autism?\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ASD affects about 1 in every 44 8-year-old children.\n\nAutism in boys and children assigned male at birth (AMAB) is much more likely than autism in girls and children assigned female at birth (AFAB). It’s more than four times more common in boys and children AMAB than in girls and children AFAB.\n\nWhen might you begin to wonder if your child has autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?\n\nResearchers believe ASD is a disorder of very early brain development. The behavioral signs of autism characteristics typically surface between the ages of 1.5 and 3 years old.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of autism?\n\nAutism symptoms range from mild to severely disabling, and every person is different. You should consider the following signs of autism as possible indicators that your child may be at risk for the condition. If your child shows any of the following early signs of autism, get in touch with their healthcare provider. They may recommend a referral for an autism evaluation.\n\nSigns of autism include difficulties with social interactions, such as:\n\nYour child doesn’t look at you when you call their name or responds inconsistently.\n\nYour baby doesn’t smile widely or make warm, joyful expressions by the age of 6 months.\n\nYour baby doesn’t engage in smiling, making sounds and making faces with you or other people by the age of 9 months.\n\nYour baby doesn’t babble by the age of 12 months.\n\nYour baby doesn’t use gestures such as reaching or waving by the age of 12 months.\n\nYour baby doesn’t play any back-and-forth games, like “peek-a-boo,” by the age of 12 months.\n\nYour toddler doesn’t say any words by the age of 16 months.\n\nYour toddler doesn’t speak any meaningful, two-word phrases (not including imitating or repeating) by the age of 24 months.\n\nAny loss of speech, babbling or social skills.\n\nSigns of autism also include specific behaviors, called restricted or repetitive behaviors or interests:\n\nYour child often lines up toys or plays with toys the same way every time.\n\nYour child must follow certain routines or has extreme reactions to small changes in routine.\n\nYour child has obsessive or very unusual interests.\n\nYour child has significant sensory aversions, like dislike of loud noises, dislike of how certain clothes fit or feel or very picky eating.\n\nYour child has sensory-seeking behaviors, like looking out of the corner of their eye at objects (peering), sniffing or licking objects.\n\nWhat causes autism?\n\nThere’s no clear-cut cause of ASD. Research supports genetic and environmental factors as some causes of autism. Scientists believe there could be many different causes of ASD that act together to change the ways people develop. They still have a lot to learn about the causes and how they impact people with ASD.\n\nIs autism genetic?\n\nGenetics do play a role in autism. But healthcare providers have only identified specific genetic causes in 10% to 20% of cases. These cases include specific genetic syndromes associated with ASD, such as fragile X syndrome, and rare changes in genetic code.\n\nAre siblings at greater risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?\n\nAutism is hereditary. When one child receives an ASD diagnosis, the next child has about a 20% greater risk of developing autism than normal. When the first two children in a family have ASD, the third child has about a 32% greater risk of developing ASD.\n\nDo vaccines cause autism (ASD)?\n\nMany scientifically sound studies have proven that vaccines don’t cause autism. When children suddenly show symptoms of ASD, some parents mistakenly blame a recent vaccination. No reliable study has found any proven link between childhood vaccination and autism.\n\nWhat are the risk factors for autism?\n\nThis field of study is an active one for research. Current known risk factors for autism include:\n\nBirthing parent of age 35 or older.\n\nUse of valproic acid or thalidomide by the birthing parent during pregnancy.\n\nPremature labor and birth.\n\nComplications during birth.\n\nLow birth weight.\n\nHaving a sibling with autism.\n\nHaving certain chromosomal or genetic conditions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the complications of autism?\n\nA wide range of physical and mental conditions often come along with autism. These conditions may include:\n\nFeeding issues.\n\nPoor sleep.\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) problems.\n\nEpilepsy.\n\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nAnxiety and depression.\n\nOther mental health conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nHow is autism diagnosed?\n\nGetting an autism diagnosis can be difficult. There’s no autism test, such as a laboratory test, to diagnose the condition. However, healthcare providers can perform specialized screenings and evaluations. The steps in the process of getting an autism diagnosis include the following.\n\nDevelopmental surveillance\n\nYour child’s healthcare provider will look at your child’s developmental history and behavior. They’ll likely ask you to record your own observations to share with them at your child’s appointments. This is an active, ongoing process where you watch your child grow and discuss your child’s skills and abilities with their provider.\n\nDevelopmental screening\n\nScreening is a more formal step and takes a closer look at your child’s development. Your child’s provider may utilize a questionnaire to screen for autism. This includes questions and checklists to compare your child to other children of the same age. This test doesn’t provide a diagnosis, but it can indicate if your child is on the typical developmental track or needs a more formal evaluation.\n\nFormal evaluation\n\nFormal evaluation takes a more in-depth look at your child’s development. A trained specialist, such as a child psychologist or a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, will observe your child and give them a structured autism spectrum test. They’ll also ask you questions and have you fill out questionnaires. The results of a formal evaluation will show your child’s strengths and challenges and can help determine a formal diagnosis."
