        "text": "How to Use Active Listening Skills to Coach Others\n\nActive listening requires you to listen attentively to a speaker, understand what they’re saying, respond and reflect on what’s being said, and retain the information for later. This keeps both listener and speaker actively engaged in the conversation.\n\nActive listening and reflecting, responding, and giving feedback aren’t always easy. Here are some helpful active listening tips for managers:\n\nPay close attention to the speaker’s behavior and body language to gain a better understanding of their message.\n\nSignal that you’re following along with visual cues like nodding and eye contact; ask clarifying questions to ensure your understanding.\n\nAvoid potential interruptions — from technology (e.g., phone or email notifications) and from humans (e.g., knocks on your door).\n\nKeep an open mind. Rather than evaluating the message and offering an opinion, simply make the speaker feel heard and validated.\n\nConfirm you’ve understood what the speaker has said by verifying your understanding.\n\nBe an attentive listener and have your toolkit of active listening techniques at the ready for whenever coaching conversations occur.\n\nAt CCL, we help leaders go beyond basic active listening skills so that they’re better equipped to truly listen to understand others — including the facts, feelings, and values that may be hidden behind the words actually being shared. At the organizational level, training people how to listen more effectively helps provide role models for the next generation of leaders and builds a workplace culture of truth and courage.\n\nGrow Your Active Listening Skills\n\nIf you want to grow your active listening skillset and you’re ready to take the active listening challenge, read on!\n\n6 Active Listening Techniques\n\nThe Active Listening Skillset\n\nEnhancing your active listening skill set involves more than just hearing someone speak. When you’re putting active listening skills to practice, you should be using these 6 techniques:\n\nPay attention.\n\nWithhold judgment.\n\nReflect.\n\nClarify.\n\nSummarize.\n\nShare.\n\n1. Pay attention.\n\nOne goal of active listening and being an effective listener is to set a comfortable tone that gives the speaker an opportunity to think and talk. Allow “wait time” before responding. Don’t cut the person off, finish their sentences, or start formulating your answer before they’ve finished. Pay attention to your body language as well as your frame of mind when engaging in active listening. Be focused on the moment, make eye contact, and operate from a place of respect as the listener.\n\n2. Withhold judgment.\n\nActive listening requires an open mind. As a listener and a leader, be open to new ideas, new perspectives, and new possibilities when practicing active listening. Even when good listeners have strong views, they suspend judgment, hold any criticisms, and avoid interruptions like arguing or selling their point right away. This can be easier if you maintain an open body posture. For example, having your arms resting on the side, rather than crossed across the chest, can signal a greater degree of openness.\n\n3. Reflect and validate.\n\nWhen you’re the listener, don’t assume that you understand correctly — or that the speaker knows you’ve heard them. Mirror their emotions by periodically paraphrasing key points. Reflecting is an active listening technique that indicates that you and your counterpart are on the same page.\n\nFor example, the speaker might tell you, “Emma is so loyal and supportive of her people — they’d walk through fire for her. But no matter how much I push, her team keeps missing deadlines.”\n\nTo paraphrase, you could say, “So Emma’s people skills are great, but accountability is a problem.”\n\nIf you hear, “I don’t know what else to do!” or “I’m tired of bailing the team out at the last minute,” try helping the other person label their feelings: “Sounds like you’re feeling pretty frustrated and stuck.” This can be a way to make them feel validated.\n\n4. Clarify.\n\nAsk questions about any issue that’s ambiguous or unclear. As the listener, if you have doubt or confusion about what the other person has said, say something like, “Let me see if I’m understanding. Are you talking about …?” or “Wait a minute. I didn’t follow you.” Asking for clarification shows you are paying attention.\n\nOpen-ended, clarifying, and probing questions are important active listening tools that encourage the speaker to do the work of self-reflection and problem solving, rather than justifying or defending a position, or trying to guess the “right answer.”\n\nExamples include: “What do you think about …?” or “Tell me about …?” and “Will you further explain/describe …?”\n\nWhen engaging in active listening, the emphasis is on asking, rather than telling. It assumes the other person has valuable input, and maintains a spirit of collaboration.\n\nYou might say: “What are some of the specific things you’ve tried?” or “Have you asked the team what their main concerns are?” or “Does Emma agree that there are performance problems?” and “What’s going on? Is there any other information that might be helpful to find out?”\n\n5. Summarize.\n\nRestating key themes as the conversation proceeds confirms and solidifies your grasp of the other person’s point of view. It also helps both parties to be clear on mutual responsibilities and follow-up. Briefly summarize what you’ve understood while practicing active listening, and ask the other person to do the same.\n\nGiving a brief restatement of core themes raised by the speaker might sound like: “Let me summarize to check my understanding. Emma was promoted to manager, and her team loves her. But you don’t believe she holds them accountable, so mistakes are accepted and keep happening. You’ve tried everything you can think of, and there’s no apparent impact. Did I get that right?”\n\nRestating key themes helps with understanding and accountability.\n\n6. Share.\n\nActive listening is first about understanding the other person, then about being understood as the listener. As you gain a clearer understanding of the other person’s perspective, you can begin to introduce your own ideas, feelings, and suggestions. People are more receptive to new ideas and suggestions when they feel understood.\n\nOnce the situation has been talked through, both you and the other person have a good picture of where things stand. From this point, the conversation can shift into problem-solving: What assumptions are we making? What hasn’t been tried? What don’t we know? What new approaches could be taken?\n\nAs the listener-coach, continue to query, guide, and offer, but don’t dictate a solution. Your “coachee” will feel more confident and eager if they think through the options and own the solution.\n\nUsed in combination, these 6 active listening techniques are the keys in holding a coaching conversation.\n\nActive Listening Is Important, But It’s Not Everything\n\nLeaders, Remember That Actions Speak Louder Than Words\n\nIf you’re a leader of others, know that as important as active listening is, just listening alone is not enough to ensure that others to feel listened to.\n\nAs our research has found, when employees speak up with suggestions or concerns, they still won’t feel heard if their leaders don’t then take action on what they learned. When leaders do act on what they heard, employees are more likely to raise suggestions or share ideas in the future. In fact, the perception of feeling listened to is 2x greater among those who shared with their leader who then took an action, than among those who shared with a leader who then did nothing.\n\nSo leaders, remember that the last and the most important step of active listening is taking action on what you hear, and that is an essential building block of truly compassionate leadership.\n\nThe Benefits of Active Listening\n\nNext, it’s important to take a step back and understand why active listening matters.\n\nIt conveys the message that what others have to say is valuable. This is a way to make employees feel reassured and included, and can signal qualities such as being open-minded and valuing knowledge and expertise.\n\nIt facilitates understanding between individuals or teams. Wanting to be understood is a fundamental goal in relationships and is a key determinant of relationship quality. Listening to others also sends positive signals about interest, respect, and support.\n\nIt builds psychological safety. Being a thoughtful listener, asking questions, seeking clarification, and encouraging others to share their perspective will reinforce your role as a spouse, friend, colleague, coach, and mentor. It can also help build a sense of belonging at work.\n\nIt enables you to coach others more effectively. Being a strong, attentive listener will lead your co-workers and direct reports to share more information with you, such that you’ll likely have a greater grasp of relevant issues and will be able to take appropriate action. You’ll also see improvements in your relationships as a result.\n\nIt provides an example of a listening-oriented climate. By consistently demonstrating how to actively listen, and the importance of listening, you help establish a shared expectation of how others should hear one another.\n\nOnce you begin to put the active listening skillset into practice, you’ll notice the positive impact it has in a number of areas, including in leader effectiveness, in personal and professional relationships, and in various social situations.\n\nNow that you understand what the 6 active listening techniques are, seriously consider whether you are a truly active listener.

We often assume it’s obvious that we’re practicing active listening and that others know they’re being heard. But the reality is that research shows most of us vastly overrate our listening skills.\n\nAs leaders, we get distracted by technology, overloaded with information, and often struggle with active listening. We may have difficulty hearing bad news, accepting criticism, and dealing with people’s feelings. Even with the best of intentions, you may be unconsciously sending signals that you aren’t listening at all. This increases the risk of misunderstanding, which can decrease psychological safety and leave others feeling alienated.\n\nYou may need to brush up on your active listening techniques if any of the following questions describe you. Do you sometimes:\n\nHave a hard time concentrating on what’s being said, especially when the person speaking is complaining, rambling, or gossiping?\n\nFind yourself planning what to say next, rather than thinking about what the speaker is saying?\n\nDislike it when someone disagrees or questions your ideas or actions?\n\nZone out when the speaker has a negative attitude?\n\nGive advice too soon and suggest solutions to problems before the other person has fully explained their perspective?\n\nTell people not to feel the way they do?\n\nTalk significantly more than the other person talks?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, you’re not alone.\n\nAccess Our Webinar!\n\nRegister for our upcoming webinar, Why Action Can Be a Critical Part of Active Listening, and learn how to improve your active listening skills and hear ways to go beyond just listening to create a space that fosters employee voice.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Active Listening for Leaders\n\nWhat are the 6 active listening skills?\n\nAccording to our research, there are 6 active listening skills that leaders should practice, including paying attention, withholding judgement, reflecting, clarifying, summarizing, and sharing.\n\nWhat are real examples of active listening?\n\nSome real examples of behaviors that show active listening include encouraging the speaker to offer their ideas and solutions before you give yours. Or, you may consider restating the speaker’s key points and checking whether your summary is accurate. Finally, if you don’t agree with the speaker’s analysis or comments, you may suggest revisiting the topic at another time. This allows both parties to withhold judgment, and gives time to reflect on the conversation.\n\nWhat are the qualities of a good listener?\n\nA good listener is an active listener. They practice attentive listening, understand what the speaker is saying, reflect before they respond, and retain the information for later. Good listeners also use active listening techniques like making eye contact, nodding to acknowledge their understanding, and avoiding interruptions during the conversation.\n\nMore questions?
