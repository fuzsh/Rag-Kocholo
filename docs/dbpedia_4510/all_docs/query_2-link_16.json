In case you missed the first two parts, which highlighted albums from 1950 to 1969 and 1970 to 1979, you can find them here:\n\nThe Albums of My Life – Part 1: 1950-1969\n\nhttps://raspberriesmarvin.wordpress.com/2021/07/06/the-albums-of-my-life-part-1-1950-1960-2/\n\nThe Albums of My Life – Part 2: 1970s\n\nhttps://raspberriesmarvin.wordpress.com/2022/06/03/the-albums-of-my-life-part-2-1970s/\n\nFor those of you who just joined, in the early days of my music listening and collecting, my tastes were pretty rigid: Pop, Rock, Soul/R&B. That was it. As the years passed, my tastes expanded, and I began to revisit music that in my youth would never have found its way onto my turntable.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s dive into the music from 1980 to 1999. Happy reading, and I hope you find something that piques your curiosity!\n\n1980s\n\nIn the 1980s, record sales reached unprecedented heights, producing some of music’s most legendary artists and albums. During this decade, I became more discerning with my purchases and primarily focused on artists that I had been following for years, although a handful of new artists did manage to make it onto my list.\n\nThe albums are arranged chronologically based on their year of release.\n\n1. Seconds Of Pleasure – Rockpile\n\nReleased 1980. Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds, along with Billy Bremner and Terry Williams, brought their talents together to create a truly remarkable album, among the best of the past 40 years. The added bonus of the 45rpm that included Edmunds and Lowe’s covers of the Everly Brothers’ songs was delightful.\n\n2. Tonite You’re Mine – Eric Carmen\n\nReleased 1980. On Carmen’s fourth solo release, ballads and rock songs combined nicely. The single “It Hurts Too Much” had all the necessary elements to become a big hit, but unfortunately, the song like the album went unnoticed.\n\n3.Rave On – Artful Dodger\n\nReleased 1980. Here’s a recommendation for you: Artful Dodger, a band from Virginia, whose music was a perfect balance between Rock and Pop. Lead vocalist Billy Paliselli was one of the best.\n\n4. Phil Seymour (1st Solo Album) – Phil Seymour\n\nReleased 1980. Seymour, who previously played drums in the Dwight Twilley Band, demonstrated his talent as a solo artist. Side 1, features exceptional Melodic Pop music, with the standout lead single “Precious To Me.”\n\n5. Love Stinks – J Geils Band\n\nReleased 1980.

Included hit singles “Fire Lake” and the title track.\n\n10. Hotter Than July – Stevie Wonder\n\nReleased 1980. Looking back on Stevie’s hit-filled catalogue, this release sometimes gets overlooked. If for nothing else but “Master Blaster,” it’s a worthwhile addition to his sterling credentials.\n\n11. Heartland – Michael Stanley Band\n\nReleased 1980. Ohio has made a significant contribution to Heartland Rock, and one of its finest was the MSB. The track that stands out is “He Can’t Love You,” which became their first national Top 40 hit.\n\n12. Glass Houses – Billy Joel\n\nReleased 1980. Joel’s career was on the rise after the success of his latest album, ‘The Stranger.’ His first release of the new decade was packed with chart-topping tracks including “It’s Still Rock And Roll To Me” and “You May Be Right.”\n\n13. The Game – Queen\n\nReleased 1980. Moving farther away from their anthemic sounds of the 1970s, they delivered songs that were shorter in length, resulting in two blockbuster hits: “Another One Bites The Dust” and, “Crazy Little Thing Called Love.”\n\n14. The Innocent Age – Dan Fogelberg\n\nReleased 1981. This album is impressive for maintaining focus throughout its four sides. The standout tracks include “Same Old Lang Syne,” “The Leader Of the Band,” and “Run For The Roses,” while “The Reach” is a showcase for its stunning beauty.\n\n15. Mecca for Moderns – Manhattan Transfer\n\nReleased 1981.

Dedication – Gary U.S. Bonds\n\nReleased 1981. With the assistance of loyal fans Steve Van Zandt and Bruce Springsteen, and backing from E Street and Southside Johnny’s band, Bonds made a powerful comeback with an outstanding collection including the hit single “This Little Girl.”\n\n17. Face Value – Phil Collins\n\nReleased 1981.

Marshall Crenshaw (1st solo album) – Marshall Crenshaw\n\nReleased 1982. Crenshaw’s first album is a great blend of Pop, Rockabilly, and Country music. There is a melodic strength throughout. “Cynical Girl” remains a standout track even after all these years.\n\n30. The Nylon Curtain – Billy Joel\n\nReleased 1982. The hit song was “Allentown,” but the Vietnam War story of “Goodnight Saigon” sets the tone for the entire album. An often-overlooked album in Joel’s collection.\n\n31. Thriller – Michael Jackson\n\nReleased 1982. A game-changer in the music and video industry, and part of a trend that saw album sales reach new heights. It also broke a record by having the most Top 10 singles released from one album.\n\n32. Men Without Women – Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul\n\nReleased 1982. Little Steven’s debut solo album continues the Soul-Rock sound he perfected with Southside Johnny.\n\n33. IV – Toto\n\nReleased 1982. Despite steady radio airplay from Classic Rock stations, the band’s album sales were getting sluggish. ‘IV‘ reignited their career, garnering multiple Grammy awards.

The Dream Of The Blue Turtles – Sting\n\nReleased 1985. Sting’s initial solo album tip-toed into the realm of jazz.

The title song, as well as “Someday,” and “Fearless Heart” are standouts.\n\n54. Graceland – Paul Simon\n\nReleased 1986.

Tunnel Of Love – Bruce Springsteen\n\nReleased 1987. Just as he followed the huge success of ‘The River’ with the stark, low-key ‘Nebraska,’ he followed the mega ‘Born In the USA’ with this subtle release. Songs like “Brilliant Disguise” and “Two Faces” gave some insight into what was happening in his personal life.\n\n63. Cloud Nine – George Harrison\n\nReleased 1987. The last album released in George’s lifetime. The hit single, “Got My Mind Set On You” brought him extensive radio airplay.\n\n64. Copperhead Road – Steve Earle\n\nReleased 1988. Earle’s audience was growing steadily, and the title song solidified his status as a singer with something to say. Covering a variety of subjects and dipping into politics, he reached a turning point thematically.\n\n65. Volume 1 – Travelling Wilburys\n\nReleased 1988. Who saw this coming? Given the talents within, the quality of the music shouldn’t have been a surprise. The lack of ego and the group camaraderie was a revelation. The music has lasted.\n\n66.

The Croz’s second solo album, and first since 1971’s ‘If I Could Only Remember My Name’ was more about coming back into the world professionally and personally. It showed that he was still a vital singer/songwriter.\n\n70. Flowers in The Dirt – Paul McCartney\n\nReleased 1989. Thanks to the help of Elvis Costello as co-writer on tunes such as “My Brave Face” and “You Want Her Too,” this collection ranks high on Macca’s solo list.\n\n71.

Mystery Girl – Roy Orbison\n\nReleased 1989. The last album by Roy was released after his passing. It was a #5 hit on the Billboard Album Charts.

This album was recognized for Linda’s successful collaborations with Aaron Neville, particularly the chart-topping track “Don’t Know Much.”\n\n76. March – Michael Penn\n\nReleased 1989. Despite not being able to replicate the success of this debut and the hit single “No Myth,” Penn is still a skilled songwriter and musician.\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, popular music shifted towards dance-pop, while hip-hop emerged as a new favorite for radio airplay. The rise of ‘grunge‘ from Seattle also established itself as the new Rock genre. However, my list of albums does not include any of these trends.\n\n1. The Neighborhood – Los Lobos\n\nReleased 1990. The troubadours from East LA remained musically head and shoulders above much of the competition. The title track continued to explore both their musical and hereditary roots.\n\n2. Representing the Mambo – Little Feat\n\nReleased 1990. Even going through a variety of personnel changes, the level of musicianship has never wavered, and they’ve stayed true to their original sound.\n\n3. I Fell In Love – Carlene Carter\n\nReleased 1990. Carter is the daughter of June Carter, and her rich heritage comes through in many of the songs here. This is country music as it used to be before it became homogenized.\n\n4. Dear 23 – the Posies\n\nReleased 1990. From Seattle, but they got lost amongst the other bigger names and successes that came out of the city. Some spine-tingling Power Pop on tracks like “Suddenly Mary” and “Golden Blunders.”\n\n5. Shooting Straight In the Dark – Mary Chapin Carpenter\n\nReleased 1990. The album gained popularity thanks to the success of the songs “Down At The Twist And Shout” and “Right Now.”\n\n6. Pretty Blue World – Billy Falcon\n\nReleased 1991. He’s made a successful career co-writing with Bon Jovi. This solo release showed that even on his own, he had a knack for Pop/Rock.\n\n7. Into The Great Wide Open – Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers\n\nReleased 1991. Back to the Heartbreakers fold after the solo ‘Full Moon Fever,’ no steps were lost. From the title track to ‘Learning To Fly’ and ‘Kings Highway,’ this is some of the band’s best material. Jeff Lynne helps again.\n\n8. Better Days – Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes\n\nReleased 1991. With songwriting help from Little Steven and Springsteen, Southside returns to the sound that made him such a prominent figure on the Asbury Park scene in the 1970s. New songs that sounded like classics on the first listen.\n\n9. Vagabond Heart – Rod Stewart\n\nReleased 1991. After a few underwhelming releases, Rod offered a solid effort that included popular singles such as “Rhythm Of My Heart” and “The Motown Song.”\n\n10. New Moon Shine – James Taylor\n\nReleased 1991. One of JT’s most complete collections. “Shed a Little Light,” Copperline,” and “I’ve Got To Stop Thinkin’ Bout That” are some of the standout cuts.\n\n11. Stax The Complete Singles 1959-1968 – Various\n\nReleased 1991. A gigantic collection of every single Stax single that mattered. A ‘must-have’ for all music fans.\n\n12. Out Of TheCradle – Lindsey Buckingham\n\nReleased 1992. His third solo album saw Lindsey fine-tuning his sound and pushing farther away from Fleetwood Mac. Sonically perfect, Rock/Pop highlighted by expert playing.\n\n13. Little Village – Little Village\n\nReleased 1992. For a short time in the early 1990s, this band got a lot of attention. It brought together Ry Cooder, John Hiatt, Nick Lowe, and Jim Keltner for a one-off that meshed Funk, Rock, Soul, and Country into a listening pleasure.\n\n14. Duophonic – Charles & Eddie\n\nReleased 1992. The story goes that these NY’ers met on a subway, and one noticed that the other had a copy of Marvin Gaye’s ‘What’s Goin’ On’ album in hand. Their debut garnered two tasty radio hits, “Would I Lie to You” and “Love Is Beautiful Thing.”\n\n15. Human Touch & 16. Lucky Town – Bruce Springsteen\n\nReleased 1992. Dual releases that were for the most part solo Springsteen. While they’ve become lost within Springsteen’s catalogue, each album contains some memorable tunes.\n\n17. Hitsville U.S.A. 1959-1971 – Various\n\nReleased 1992. A brilliant collection of all the key Motown hits from its peak period. There’s nothing that you’d want that you won’t find here. Great liner notes as well.\n\n18. Kiko – Los Lobos\n\nReleased 1992. Once again, the troubadours from East LA deliver. Their ability to consistently write strong, thoughtful material is impressive.\n\n19. New Miserable Experience – Gin Blossoms\n\nReleased 1992. With cuts like “Hey Jealousy,” “Found Out About You,” and, “Allison Road,” there just wasn’t anything wrong with their second release.\n\n20. Untitled – AJ Croce\n\nReleased 1993. AJ’s first release had a superb combination of Jazz/Blues-styled songs. Far from the sound of his dad, Jim, and clearly carving his own name.\n\n21. Winter Light – Linda Ronstadt\n\nReleased 1993. A commercial disappointment, but massively accepted by critics. One of Linda’s strongest efforts, as she paid notice to underrated songwriters like Anna McGarrigle and Eric Kaz.\n\n22. Off The Ground – Paul McCartney\n\nReleased 1993. A strong albeit unrecognized effort that was highlighted by “Hope Of Deliverance,” “Looking For Changes” and, “Peace In the Neighbourhood.”\n\n23. Tuesday Night Music Club – Sheryl Crow\n\nReleased 1993. Crow’s debut was a highlight of the early 90s. “All I Wanna Do” was a chart-buster, but the album was loaded with stellar tracks.\n\n24. Return To Pooh Corner – Kenny Loggins\n\nReleased 1994. It’s an album designed for children, filled with simplicity and beauty. Featuring contributions from Graham Nash, David Crosby, and Amy Grant.\n\n25. August and Everything After – Counting Crows\n\nReleased 1994. The band’s debut sounded like a combination of early Springsteen, Dylan, and Van Morrison. Lead singer/songwriter Adam Duritz’s brilliance shines. The hit singles “Mr. Jones” and “Rain King” were highlights.\n\n26. On the Floor of Heaven – The Blue Shadows\n\nReleased 1994. Led by Billy Cowsill and Jeffrey Hatcher, who were the primary singer-songwriters. Their music was characterized by a Country-Rock style that bore a resemblance to the sound of the Everly Brothers.\n\n27. What A Crying Shame – the Mavericks\n\nReleased 1994. The strength of their third release is marked by the fact that many tunes are still in the band’s live repertoire 30 years later. The title track still resonates.\n\n28. Big White Lies – Chris Von Sneidern\n\nReleased 1994. Thirty years ago, ‘Goldmine’ magazine picked this release as the all-time best Power-Pop album. High praise, but it has remained near the top of many lists.\n\n29. Wildflowers – Tom Petty\n\nReleased 1994. One of the most important releases in Petty’s catalogue. This solidified his status as an artist who could succeed independently of his band.\n\n30. Ain’t Had Enough Fun – Little Feat\n\nReleased 1995. With this release, the band introduced female vocalist Shaun Murphy into the fold. There was a slight change in their sound, but they continued with a funky and soulful style.\n\n31. Thinkin’ About You – Trisha Yearwood\n\nReleased 1995. The title cut helped propel the album onto both the Pop and Country charts. Trisha’s talent for capturing Linda Ronstadt’s mood and feel set her apart as a unique vocalist.\n\n32. Music For All Occasions – the Mavericks\n\nReleased 1995. The band continued to prove their versatility with hit singles like “Here Comes the Rain,” “All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down,” “Missing You,” and their cover of “Somethin’ Stupid.”\n\n33. Tonin‘ – Manhattan Transfer\n\nReleased 1995. The Transfer’s album of cover songs was arranged and performed with their own creative and distinct vocal and musical style. Who knew “Let’s Hang On” could work as a samba?\n\n34. Sings the Hollies in Reverse – Various\n\nReleased 1995. A diverse collection of independent Power Pop musicians covering the works of the Hollies. A few of the tracks arguably surpassed the quality of the original versions.\n\n35. Garage Demos Part 1 & 36. Garage Demos Part 2 – Venice\n\nReleased 1995. Two sets of brothers/cousins and siblings of the Lennon sisters. Their ability to harmonize ala CS&N, the Eagles, and the Beach Boys, caught my ear. These two releases collected some of their early work.\n\n37. Feels Like Home – Linda Ronstadt\n\nReleased 1995. Linda returns to her country-rock sound with a collection that ranks among her best and also among her most underrated.\n\n38. Bryndle – Self Titled\n\nReleased 1995. This album has no weak tracks. Considering the talent of the members – Wendy Waldman, Karla Bonoff, Andrew Gold, and Kenny Edwards – this came as no surprise.\n\n39. Big Money Item – The Greenberry Woods\n\nReleased 1995. Chock-full of tasty tunes from a band that should have lasted longer. The jangle rings loudly!\n\n40. Bringing Down the Horse – The Wallflowers\n\nReleased 1996. In the late 90s, their debut album dominated FM radio with its hit singles “6th Avenue Heartache” and “One Headlight.”\n\n41. Fashion Nugget – Cake\n\nReleased 1996. Their second album, but the first to come to my ears, thanks to the cover of “I Will Survive,” “Daria,” and, “The Distance.”\n\n42. All My Relations – the Neville Brothers\n\nReleased 1996. The Neville’s settle into a comfortable rhythm. Their focus remains on the spiritual message that runs throughout.\n\n43. Sheryl Crow – Sheryl Crow\n\nReleased 1996. An excellent collection showcased by the hit singles “If It Makes You Happy” and “Everyday Is A Winding Road“. This was a worthy follow-up to “Tuesday Music Club.”\n\n44. That Thing You Do – Various Artist’s Soundtrack\n\nReleased 1996. All original music captures the idealistic essence of 1960s Pop music.\n\n45. High Lonesome Road – Vince Gill\n\nReleased 1996. This release climbed to the Top 5 on the Country charts and the Top 30 on the Pop charts. Includes the hit singles: “High Lonesome Sound,” “Worlds Apart,” “Pretty Little Adrianna,” “A Little More Love” and “You and You Alone.”\n\n46. Marigold Sky – Hall & Oates\n\nReleased 1997. Although it did not achieve great commercial success, it is a remarkably strong release that even Darryl Hall ranks among the best from the duo.\n\n47. Play On – Scott McCarl\n\nReleased 1997. McCarl served as the bassist and vocalist on the last Raspberries album ‘Starting Over‘. His solo album was a Power Pop delight.\n\n48. Tremolo – Blue Rodeo |\n\nReleased 1997. They have had widespread recognition and admiration across Canada. “Falling Down Blue” and “It Could Happen To You” are among the standout tracks.\n\n49. Destination Anywhere – Bon Jovi\n\nReleased 1997. Credit must be given to Bon Jovi for effectively stepping away from his band’s style. “Janey Don’t You Take Your Love To Town” remains a personal favorite.\n\n50.

A superb release highlighted by the single, “If You Ever Have Forever In Mind,” which is a timeless blend of Country and Pop music.\n\n60. Global – Cowsills\n\nReleased 1998.

Heather was the opposite of other Country artists who were gravitating towards a more Pop-oriented sound. Her music remained true to the classic Country sound of the 60s and 70s, and her voice was a perfect match.\n\n65. The Globe Sessions – Sheryl Crow\n\nReleased 1998.
