        "text": "Make sure that you have the latest software on your connected iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\n\nPut both AirPods Pro in your ears and check that Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is turned on.\n\nCheck whether Adaptive Audio is enabled. Adaptive Audio adjusts noise-control settings based on your surroundings.\n\nClean the microphone and speaker meshes with a dry cotton swab. Sometimes Active Noise Cancellation can be affected if debris or earwax builds up. If this happens, you might experience:\n\nA loss of bass sound\n\nAn increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise"
