I heard it first because one of the tracks was on a playlist of Caroline Polachek’s that I started listening to when I was working with her. I think Caroline is a really interesting artist as someone who is more in the mainstream pop world. Her tastes are so eclectic. We’re in very different worlds, but we definitely share similar ideas. They’re both worlds that have expectations about how things should sound, and we’re both trying to get away from that a bit."
