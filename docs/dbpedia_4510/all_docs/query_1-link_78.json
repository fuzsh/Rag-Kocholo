They want to sing, dance, shout, use slang, challenge conventions. This is where Soundtrap comes in.”\n\nTamar Brown\n\nNew York City DOE Teacher\n\n“My goal is for my students to be people who can think on a deeper level. Project based learning, which Soundtrap greatly supports, takes them out of the 'give me the answers' mentality and forces them to think and create on their own.”\n\nKelly Martin\n\nNew York City Teacher\n\n“Soundtrap is a game changer for my students.
