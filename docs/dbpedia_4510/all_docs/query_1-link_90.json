In order to dispose of yard waste and woody debris, we encourage you to use methods such as composting or using your local landfill. If you must burn, use caution and follow Ontario’s Outdoor Burning Regulations.\n\nFires are to be ignited no sooner than 2 hours before sunset and extinguished no later than 2 hours after sunrise. Always have tools/water adequate to contain the fire at the site. Know the rules for safe outdoor burning. Read the full set of Outdoor Burning Regulations.\n\nResidents within municipal boundaries must also check with their local fire department for burning restrictions, or permitting requirements prior to burning.\n\nForest fire updates\n\nNortheast Region\n\nNo new wildland fires were confirmed in the Northeast Region by early evening on Sunday, August 18.\n\nAt the time of this update, there are 31 active wildland fires in the Northeast Region.
