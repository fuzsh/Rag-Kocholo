        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nThe cost of Audien hearing aids starts at $99–$249 per pair, which is very low compared to other brands.\n\nYou can purchase Audien hearing aids online, without seeing an audiologist or licensed hearing instrument specialist.\n\nThe company offers two in-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids designed for mild to moderate hearing loss, and two personal sound amplification products (PSAPs).\n\nIs finding affordable hearing aids a top priority for you? It is for many hearing aid shoppers—more than 28% of respondents in our Reviews Team’s survey of hearing aid users ranked price as the most important thing they look for in a hearing aid.\n\nSince Audien offers some of the least expensive hearing devices on the market, our Reviews Team created this independent review of Audien hearing aids, which breaks down the following:\n\nPros and cons of the company\n\nDifference between hearing aids and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs)\n\nVarious Audien hearing aid models\n\nCosts and how to pay for Audien hearing aids\n\nAudien customer reviews\n\nOur goal is to help you to decide whether Audien is right for you. For more information on finding the right hearing aids and why our Reviews Team named the Audien Atom Pro “Most Affordable,” see our best hearing aids review.\n\nWhy trust our expert review?\n\n5,300\n\n12\n\n1\n\nOur Reviews Team recommends products and services we believe will provide value in the lives of our readers. We’ve spent more than 5,000 hours conducting in-depth research on hearing aid devices to give you the most accurate hearing aid review. To make these selections, we:\n\nConsulted with audiologists and geriatric care experts\n\nMystery shopped 18 brands\n\nSurveyed hundreds of hearing aid users\n\nTested various models of hearing aids\n\nInterviewed experts in the field\n\nRead thousands of verified customer reviews\n\nRead more about our hearing aids review methodology.\n\nWhy we chose to review Audien\n\nOur Reviews Team chose to evaluate Audien because the company offers a potentially cost-effective alternative to traditional hearing aids, which cost $4,600 per pair on average.1\n\nIn our Reviews Team’s survey of hearing aid users, nearly 30% of respondents said the biggest challenge with their hearing aids was the high cost. With price being such a concern for many potential hearing aids customers (especially older adults on a fixed income), we wanted to review a company like Audien that produces some of the most affordable hearing aids on the market.\n\nAudien hearing aids are also easy to purchase—you can buy them online without a prescription, and all models have rechargeable batteries. Rechargeable batteries are another highly valued hearing aids feature—respondents to our survey rated rechargeable batteries as the second-most important hearing aids feature, behind only digital noise reduction.\n\nThe combination of low price with desirable features made our Reviews Team want to take a closer look at Audien hearing aids and Audien reviews.\n\nPros and cons of Audien hearing aids\n\nTable 1 Comparison of Audien hearing aid models, as of January 2024\n\nAudien hearing aid models\n\nAudien Atom\n\nCost: $99\n\nDimensions:\n\nTop (part that’s outside of your ear): 1.4 cm x 0.9 cm (height x length)\n\nBottom (part that fits inside your ear): 0.4 cm H x 0.4 cm L\n\nWeight: 1.9 grams\n\nType of hearing aid: In-the-canal (ITC)\n\nType of hearing loss: Mild to moderate\n\nBattery type: Rechargeable\n\nBluetooth compatible: No\n\nThe Audien Atom is the company’s most affordable model. It’s an in-the-canal hearing aid that only weighs 1.9 grams, which is approximately the weight of two U.S. dollar bills.2\n\nThis model includes a wireless charging dock with compartments for each hearing aid. The dock plugs into a standard wall outlet and takes 4–6 hours to reach a full charge of 20 hours of use.\n\nThe Atom is the only Audien hearing aid that automatically turns off the hearing aids while charging, which can help speed up charging time.\n\nBesides rechargeable batteries, the Atom is a basic model with no special features such as Bluetooth technology, noise reduction, or directional microphones.\n\nAudien Atom Pro\n\nCost: $249\n\nDimensions:\n\nTop: 1.1 cm H x 0.8 cm L\n\nBottom: 0.3 cm H x 0.3 cm L\n\nWeight: 1.85 g\n\nType of hearing aid: In-the-canal (ITC)\n\nType of hearing loss: Mild to moderate\n\nBattery type: Rechargeable\n\nBluetooth compatible: No\n\nThe Audien Atom Pro is even smaller than the Audien Atom. The Audien Atom Pro uses a wireless charging dock and has a longer battery life compared to the Atom, with a battery life of 24 hours after 4–6 hours of charging.\n\nThe longer battery life and smaller size are the main distinctions between the Atom and Atom Pro. Otherwise, like the Atom, the Atom Pro has no special features typically found in other, more expensive hearing aids.\n\nThis model is a good option if you’re looking for a smaller Audien hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss, or a hearing aid with a long battery life.\n\nWhat is a hearing aid vs. a hearing amplifier?\n\nA hearing aid is “a small electronic device that you wear in or behind your ear,” according to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders.3 It consists of a microphone, which converts soundwaves to electrical signals, and an amplifier that increases the power of the signals, sending them to the ear through a speaker. You can adjust the volume of Audien hearing aids, but only with a screwdriver provided by the company. Most other hearing aids allow you to adjust the volume using a button/dial on the hearing aids themselves or through the company’s app (Audien has neither).\n\nHearing amplifiers, also known as personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), “are intended for people with normal hearing to amplify sounds in certain situations, such as recreational activities like birdwatching or hunting,” according to the FDA.4 The FDA doesn’t regulate PSAPs for safety and effectiveness as they do with hearing aids. Unlike some brands of hearing aids, you don’t need to consult with a hearing aid professional or audiologist to purchase a hearing amplifier. But to determine whether you need a hearing aid or PSAP, it’s recommended you undergo an in-person hearing test with an audiologist to gauge your level of hearing loss. If you’re not able to attend an in-person test, you can also take an online hearing test.\n\nBased on these definitions, two out of the four hearing aids Audien offers are not classified as medical-grade hearing aids, but rather as PSAPs. The EV1 and EV3 are not medical-grade hearing aids, while the Atom and Atom Pro are medical-grade hearing aids registered with the FDA.\n\nDisclosure about Audien marketing claims\n\nIn May 2021, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich announced an “Assurance of Discontinuance” against “Budget Hearing Aids and its subsidiary, Audien (Budget), to stop the company from misleading consumers about over-the-counter hearing devices. Budget owns several websites and advertises ‘FDA APPROVED’ or ‘FDA REGISTERED’ hearing devices, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved any over-the-counter hearing aids.”5 Audien complied with the notice and has stopped referring to its hearing aids as “FDA approved.”\n\nAudien hearing aids alternatives\n\nOn the Audien website, you may notice that Audien offers two other devices called the EV1 and EV3. These devices are not FDA-registered, so they are not considered hearing aids. The EV1 and EV3 may not be the best options if you’re looking for a medical grade hearing aid and one that has advanced features. If budget is your main concern and you’re looking for a simple solution, these two PSAPs might be an alternative choice for your hearing needs.\n\nBut again, it’s recommended you undergo an in-person hearing test to help determine whether a PSAP is a viable alternative.\n\nHistory of Audien\n\nArthur Garber founded Audien, one of the newest hearing device companies, after searching for an affordable hearing aid for his grandmother and finding that people were paying thousands of dollars to purchase hearing aids when they cost far less to produce. Audien hearing aids range from $99–$249 per pair.\n\nAlthough Audien hearing aids are inexpensive, Audien has claimed in the past that its hearing aids are “similar technology to $5,000 hearing aids” and “can be used for Tinnitus management.” But because Audien has not provided evidence to support these claims, the National Advertising Division of the Better Business Bureau recommended that Audien stop making the claims, and Audien complied and removed these claims from its advertising.6\n\nPurchasing Audien hearing aids\n\nHow do I purchase Audien hearing aids?\n\nTo purchase a pair of Audien hearing aids, visit the Audien website and add the hearing aid to your cart to check out. You can pay by credit card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Discover).\n\nOur Reviews Team found the Audien website very easy to navigate with transparent prices and an easy checkout process.\n\nHow much do Audien hearing aids cost?\n\nAudien hearing aids range from $99–$249 per pair, depending on which model you choose. The company does not offer an option for financing or payment plans. But Audien does offer a 45-day free trial period during which you can return your hearing aids for a 100% refund.\n\nAudien hearing aids are cheaper than traditional hearing aids because they are sold directly to the consumer. Ordering hearing aids online may be more convenient and easier than going to a hearing center or audiologist. On the other hand, in-person consultations with an audiologist or licensed hearing instrument specialist can offer such benefits as customized fit and ongoing support, as well as helping you determine what type of device is best for you (e.g., a hearing aid or hearing amplifier).\n\nAlso, only in-person appointments with audiologists can diagnose the cause of your hearing loss.\n\nIn 2017, Congress passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act to make it easier for people to buy affordable hearing aids.7 Although over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aids are not available as a formal category of hearing aids yet, they won’t require a prescription or audiologist visit once the category has been approved by the FDA.\n\nFor more information about OTC hearing aids, check out the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Resources from the American Academy of Audiology and our over the counter hearing aids page.\n\nDoes insurance cover hearing aids?\n\nMost insurance plans do not cover the cost of hearing aids, but there are a few options you may be eligible for: Medicare Advantage (Medicare C), Flexible Spending Account (FSA), Health Savings Account (HSA), or benefits for veterans or active members of the military.\n\nUnlike Medicare Part A and Part B,8 Medicare Advantage,9 also known as Medicare C, may offer coverage for your hearing aids. If you have Medicare C, check with your provider to see what benefits they offer for hearing aids, if there are limitations, and if you qualify.\n\nAn FSA is “a special account you put money into that you use to pay for certain out-of-pocket health care costs,” according to HealthCare.gov, and an HSA is “a type of savings account that lets you set aside money on a pre-tax basis to pay for qualified medical expenses.”10 According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the cost of hearing aids and batteries, repairs, and maintenance are considered medical expenses for an FSA or HSA.11\n\nIf you are a veteran or active member of the military, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs covers medical services like audiology, and you may be eligible for hearing aid assistance.12\n\nCheck out Benefits CheckUp to learn more about benefits in your area.\n\nAudien app and accessories\n\nAudien does not have a smartphone app, which many other hearing aid companies do offer. Without an app, you might be missing out on telehealth services, custom programs, and the ability to adjust the volume and frequencies of your hearing aid.\n\nThe company offers three accessories: the Audien Hearing Accessory Pack; Atom Pro Charger + Case; and the Atom Charger + Dock.\n\nAudien Hearing Accessory Pack: This pack costs $12 and comes with an accessory case, 12 replacement earbuds, a cleaning brush, a screwdriver for volume adjustments, and eight earwax guards. Users can adjust the volume on their Audien hearing aids using the screwdriver, which may be a cumbersome process. Most hearing aids let the user adjust volume using either buttons on the hearing aids themselves or through the company’s app.\n\nAtom Pro Charger + Case: This charging kit costs $24 and comes with a charging cable, power block, and an Atom Pro charging case.\n\nAtom Charger + Dock: This accessory costs $14 and includes a charging cable, charging block, and an Atom dock.\n\nAudien customer service and satisfaction\n\nThe Audien website includes tutorial videos on setting up, wearing, and cleaning your hearing aids. You can also reach out to Audien’s support team by phone, email, or live chat.\n\nPhone: You can reach Audien’s customer support at (205) 255-1112, Monday through Friday, from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. PT.\n\nEmail: You can contact Audien via email at support@audienhearing.com. The support team has a 24-hour response time.\n\nLive chat: The live chat option can direct you to resources for setting up your hearing aids, troubleshooting, ongoing maintenance, returning, and reporting lost or damaged hearing aids. Chat can be found at audienhearing.com/support.\n\nWhen reaching out to Audien customer service, our Reviews Team received mixed results. Some phone calls were answered immediately, others were answered after 10 or more seconds. And the live chat option doesn’t involve chatting with an actual person—our Reviews Team found the live chat uses what it calls an “Answer Bot” (a software program rather than customer service employee) to direct you to articles and other resources on the Audien website that can help answer your question. A live person never actually communicates with you in the chat.\n\nIn our Reviews Team’s independent survey, more than 28% of Audien hearing aid users said the biggest challenge with their hearing aids is that they don’t work as they should, compared to 9% of all respondents. About 14% of Audien users said their hearing aids were uncomfortable to wear, compared to 10% of Widex users. The survey also indicated that more than 14% of Audien users reported their hearing aid doesn’t have enough features compared to 5% of MDHearing users.\n\nAudien maintenance, warranty, and care\n\nAudien warranty\n\nAudien offers a one-year warranty for defective hearing aids and guarantees a replacement. The warranty does not include broken, lost, or water-damaged products.\n\nHow to clean Audien hearing aids\n\nIn our Reviews Team’s survey, respondents reported that Audien hearing aids were about as easy or difficult to clean as hearing aids from other companies. More than 16% of respondents said their hearing aids were extremely easy to clean, while more than 23% said it was difficult. That’s compared to 28% of Audien hearing aid users who said their hearing aids were difficult to clean, and another 14% who said their Audien hearing aids were neither easy nor difficult to clean.\n\nOn the Audien website, tutorial videos explain how to clean the Atom and Atom Pro hearing aid models. The first step is to turn off your hearing aids and then remove the ear dome, which is the small piece that fits inside your ear. Brush off any debris with the black cleaning brush included with each device.\n\nNext, you’ll clean the tip of the hearing aid, also known as the receiver. If you have a wax guard on the tip, remove it before cleaning. Audien recommends using a rubbing alcohol swab or wipes to clean the tip thoroughly. After you’ve cleaned around the tip, replace the old wax guard with a new one using the special tool that comes with your hearing device. After the new wax guard is in, wipe down the rest of the hearing aid. Finally, clean each ear dome before putting it back onto the hearing aids.\n\nHow to charge Audien hearing aids\n\nThe Atom and Atom Pro both use a wireless charger. Here are the steps to charge your Audien hearing aids:\n\nTurn off the hearing aids before charging. (Note: The Atom Pro will automatically turn off when charging.)\n\nPlug the micro USB end of the cable into the charging dock.\n\nInsert the USB end into the two-prong wall charger.\n\nPlug the charger into the wall.\n\nPlace hearing aids into the hollow section of the charging dock with the removal wires facing down.\n\nHearing aids will magnetically click into place, and a red light will indicate the devices are charging.\n\nThe red light will turn solid green when the charging is complete (after 4–6 hours).\n\nAre Audien hearing aids water-resistant?\n\nNo, Audien hearing aids are not water-resistant, which may be an issue for those who prefer to wear hearing aids in the shower. Taking out hearing aids each time you shower or swim can take more time and be less convenient. Other brands, such as Phonak and Jabra Enhance, offer water-resistant hearing aids.\n\nReturns\n\nAudien offers a 45-day return policy, which is common across the industry, with company return policies averaging from 45–100 days for most hearing aid companies. That means you have 45 days to return your Audien hearing aids for a 100% refund. Audien’s policy starts the day after receiving your shipment, and if you receive a defective pair of hearing aids, Audien will give you a free replacement.\n\nWho is best suited for Audien hearing aids?\n\nAudien hearing aids are suited for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, and not for those who have moderately severe to profound hearing loss. For example, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, moderately severe to profound hearing loss is from 56 decibels to 91+ decibels (decibels are a measure of sound levels).13 That is approximately the average noise level of an office or air conditioner, according to 3M’s noise navigator.14 In another example, you might have moderately severe hearing loss if you can only hear 71 dB or higher sounds, such as a dishwasher or electric mixer.\n\n“If you have a flatter or less sloping shape to your hearing, you will likely be a good candidate for in-the-canal devices,” said Sarah Lundstrom, AuD, ABA Certified in Audiology, a fellow of the American Academy of Audiology, and a member of the Florida Academy of Audiology. “Many of the small devices can be very discreet and are good for people who are unable or uncomfortable with something resting on the outside of their ear. [Though], you may have to sacrifice some additional features such as Bluetooth or rechargeability in order to have those small devices.”\n\nLundstrom also said that “some people who have good low-frequency hearing and poorer high-frequency hearing find that in-the-canal hearing aids make them feel occluded (plugged up), like when [they] have a cold or fly on a plane. This can be bothersome and cause poorer hearing.”\n\nLindsey Jorgensen, AuD, PhD, is an associate professor in the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of South Dakota, and added that if discreet hearing aids are “battery operated then the batteries are smaller and more difficult to use. Additionally, when the aids are smaller, there are fewer features that are able to “fit” in the aid. Therefore, the aid may not have some of the high-end features that are in slightly larger aids.” Dr. Jorgensen is a fellow and board member of the American Academy of Audiology.\n\nTable 2 Audien vs. other brands comparison, as of January 2024\n\nWhat to consider before buying hearing aids\n\nOur Reviews Team recommends considering many features before buying hearing aids, including your budget, type of hearing loss, technology, and batteries.\n\nBudget: Hearing aids can range from $100–$6,000. If you’re looking for other affordable hearing aids, our Reviews Team named Audicus “Best Budget-Friendly Bluetooth” in our best hearing aids review.\n\nType of hearing loss: According to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, hearing loss ranges from normal to profound. If you have severe hearing loss, our Reviews Team named the Phonak Naída Paradise P-UP as “Best for Severe Hearing Loss.”\n\nTechnology: Advanced hearing aid technology includes directional microphones, feedback cancellation to reduce background noise, and streaming via Bluetooth. Our Reviews Team chose Oticon More as the hearing aid with the “Most Advanced Smart Features,” since it has advanced technology that results in a more balanced and precise listening experience.\n\nBatteries: Many different hearing aid batteries are available, including zinc-air (disposable) and lithium-ion (rechargeable) batteries. The hearing aid model you choose will determine what kind of batteries you can use. Our Reviews Team picked ReSound One as “Best Rechargeable” for its long battery life.\n\nAudien hearing aid reviews from customers\n\nCustomer reviews vary for Audien among different sites, including the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and Trustpilot. As of January 2024, on BBB, Audien has a B rating and a customer review rating of 4.19 out of 5. On Trustpilot, Audien has a “great” rating, with 3.9 out of 5 stars.\n\n“I am very happy with my experience with Audien. The first pair I got I had to send back since they were too big and wouldn’t fit right. Even before I got the ones I was returning processed, the replacement was on the way. Then something was wrong with them. They let me return them and sent me another one right off. I am so proud to say that I have them right now.”\n\nANTHONY, VERIFIED CUSTOMER (TRUSTPILOT.COM)\n\n“I purchased two pairs of Audien Atom hearing aids. One for my 90 yr old mother and one for my husband. They both loved them! My husband was able to turn the ** down to a normal volume. My mother could hear me the very first time I said something without having me repeat it several times. She was excited and a bit teary eyed.”\n\nKAREN, VERIFIED CUSTOMER REVIEW (BBB.ORG)\n\n“The first pair I had worked well till I charged them. So they sent another pair that had the same problem. So I am not pleased with them.”\n\nBRENDA, VERIFIED CUSTOMER REVIEW (BBB.ORG)\n\nBottom line\n\nAudien is a relatively new company that supports those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The company offers inexpensive devices in two different models, the Atom and Atom Pro. Be aware that EV1 and EV3 models are not classified as medical-grade hearing aids, but rather PSAPs.\n\nAudien hearing aids may be the right choice if your main focus is on price, and if you have mild to moderate hearing loss. Audien hearing aids are about $4,450 cheaper than the average hearing aids, a significant savings that can make the difference for those who could otherwise not afford other hearing aids.\n\nAudien hearing devices might not be the right choice if you’re searching for advanced technology or special features. Other hearing aid companies, such as Phonak or Widex, offer cutting-edge technology and features, including water-resistant hearing aids, telecoil, and Bluetooth capability.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nAudien hearing aids are good and they work, but they don’t include a lot of features, such as tinnitus masking or Bluetooth. The company only offers one type of hearing aid, in-the-canal (ITC), and has two models suited for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. If you’re looking for a cost-effective alternative to traditional hearing aids, with no audiologist or hearing professional consultation needed, Audien hearing aids might be a good fit.\n\nAudien is a legitimate company and sells two models online. The company has a B rating on the Better Business Bureau and a customer review rating of 4.14 out of 5. On Trustpilot, Audien has a ‘great’ rating, with 4.1 out of 5 stars.\n\nAudien hearing aids range from $99–$249 per pair, depending on which model you choose. The Atom costs $99 and the Atom Pro costs $249 per pair.\n\nThe Audien EV1 and EV3 models are amplifiers, also known as personal sound amplification products (PSAPs), while the Audien Atom and Atom Pro are Class I FDA-registered hearing aids.\n\nWhile both are over-the-counter hearing aid brands, Audien has a lower price range ($99–$249) compared to MDHearing ($299–$699). In fact, Audien has the lowest starting price for any OTC rechargeable hearing aid on the market.\n\nAudien only offers CIC-style hearing aids, while MDHearing produces behind-the-ear (BTE) and in-the-canal (ITE) styles. In terms of battery life, you’ll get 20–24 hours from Audien hearing aids, and 15–20 hours from MDHearing hearing aids.\n\nAs for tech features, Audien does not offer Bluetooth capability. While MDHearing does build Bluetooth connectivity into its Volt Max model, it is only at a basic level; allowing you to connect through the app to make adjustments to your hearing aids (not streaming).\n\nWhen it comes to warranty and financing, MDHearing comes out on top with a two-year warranty and financing options vs. a one-year warranty and absence of financing options with Audien. MDHearing also offers remote audiology support for the entire life of your device.\n\nOverall, our Reviews Team gives Audien a higher rating of 3.91 out of 5 points, and 3.27 for MDHearing. You can read more about MDHearing in our in-depth review.\n\nAudien is not FDA-approved, but both its Atom and Atom Pro models are registered with the FDA.\n\nHave questions about this review?
