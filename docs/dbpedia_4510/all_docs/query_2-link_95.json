        "text": "It’s here. The long awaited new song off Nightwish‘s upcoming album “Yesterwynde”, out Septemeber 20th, is finally here. The new track titled “The Day Of…” is something shockingly new, but still reminds the typical Nightwish sound.\n\n“The Day Of…” is definitely not a heavy song, different from the band’s latest single “The Perfume Of The Timeless“. It’s a more relaxed, humming-along song. The new track also brings children’s voices in a choir along. “The Day Of…” reminds the typical Nightwish sound, as vocalist Floor Jansen’s singing is still on point – nothing entirely mind blowing this time though – and the song also has this type of mysterious, dark, melancholic feel to it, which is very Nightwish like. “The Day Of…” ends in a way that feels like the song is opening up, as Floor’s voice gets higher and the whole sound opens up.\n\nTuomas Holopainen, keyboardist, producer and lyricist of Nightwish, says in a short YouTube video on the band’s official page:\n\n“The Day Of…“, our second single, well that’s something else musically. It’s something very different that we have ever done. You get this lovely 80s feel to it, but when it gets really controversial are the lyrics. So let’s wait for the storm.”\n\nLyrically speaking, this new track does surprise, but is at the same time something that can be expected by Nightwish. When usually Nightwish songs talk about nature and the evolution, some time they take a more serious and society critic way. Just like the song “Noise” from Nightwish, also the new single “The Day Of…” critics today’s society. In an interview with German rock radio station Rock Antenne, Tuomas Holopainen sums up the meaning of the lyrics of “The Day Of…” pretty well:\n\n“The song is about fear […] and controlling people with fear and that’s what leaders, religious leaders, political leaders have done for millennia and today, especially media, it’s something that rubs me the wrong way every single day, because even though the world is still filled with problems that we need to address – there are some terrible goings on – we are being fed this nonsense constantly about you have to be afraid of the end of the world and we’re living in the worst times ever, the world is coming to an end, Y2K, the end of the Mayan calendars… How many times have we been predicted the end of the world and it’s never happening, so the song has a very optimistic, positive message under it, that even though there is so much going on, that we need to address in this world, don’t forget that you are extremely lucky to be alive, you have a few decades in the sun to live your life, [so] make the best out of it and try not to fear all.”\n\nYou can agree on this statement or not – also about the new sound of this new single – but you can have a try yourself and listen to the song below to form your own opinion!"
