        "text": "Ischgl opens the ski season on November 25th, 2021. The highlight of the winter season kick-off are, with Il Volo and Alice, two powerful-voiced acts at the legendary \"Top of the Mountain Opening Concert\" on November 27th. 2-G (vaccinated or recovered) applies all concert attendees. Comprehensive protection concepts ensure the greatest possible safety for guests, employees and locals, even beyond the opening.\n\nWith an elegant winter opening, Ischgl sets the course for a high-quality skiing experience in one of Europe's top ski resorts. As early as November 25th, the Silvretta Arena will open for business with over 239 kilometres of slopes from Ischgl to Samnaun. The day ski pass is also the entrance ticket to the concert and costs 65 euros per person on the day of the event. With a valid ski pass for two days or more, admission to the concert is included. All information at ischgl.com\n\nVisitors to the winter opening can look forward to two powerful vocal acts this year with the internationally celebrated Operatic-Pop trio Il Volo and the Italian pop singer Alice. The live concert, which will take place in Ischgl Dorf surrounded by a breathtaking nighttime mountain backdrop, begins at 6:00 p.m. 2-G (vaccinated or recovered) applies to all concertgoers aged 12 and over - children under the age of 12 must present a valid Covid test. “In the coming winter season, we want to continue to do our utmost to play our part as responsible hosts by ensuring comprehensive health and safety standards. The aim is and remains to be one of the safest destinations in the Alpine region for our guests,\" clarifies Alexander von der Thannen, chairman of the Paznaun - Ischgl Tourist Association.\n\nSafely into the winter season\n\nThose in charge of the Silvrettaseilbahn AG have spared no effort to ensure a safe winter season 2021/2022 and have invested around 700,000 euros in hygiene measures. \"We have installed new\" intelligent \"camera systems on the three cable cars in Ischgl, which optimize waiting times in the queuing areas by means of density measurements and mobility analyses,\" explain Günther Zangerl and Markus Walser, CEOs of the Silvrettaseilbahn AG. The shortened waiting times are displayed in real time on the smartphone. All cable car cabins are disinfected using cold fogging equipment to eliminate 99.99 percent of viruses, bacteria and spores in the cable car cabins. The same method is also used daily in the ski buses as well as in sports shops, ski depots, toilet facilities, elevator cabins and the first aid stations. The Paznaun was also one of the first regions to introduce wastewater monitoring in order to be able to identify possible clusters in advance. This comprehensive safety package, as well as strict monitoring and compliance with the legal framework, is intended to provide guests with a maximally safe and relaxed vacation experience. Currently, one is still waiting for the official regulation for the nationwide rules regarding this year's winter skiing operation. However, it can probably be assumed that a 3-G rule (tested, vaccinated, recovered) will apply in the ski area and that FFP2 masks will be compulsory for cable car rides.\n\nIL VOLO - internationally acclaimed Italian vocal talents\n\nIL VOLO's music is well received internationally. Their self-titled debut album \"IL VOLO\" (2010) reached platinum status and entered the US Billboard Top Ten, the first but surely not the last victory on their road of success. This is proven by numerous, sold-out world tours, as well as awards such as the Golden Creator Award given by YouTube or 10-times gold and 12-times platinum for their 13 released albums. Today, ten years after their debut as a trio, the former talent show participants Piero Barone, Ignazio Boschetto and Gianluca Ginoble are internationally celebrated stars with their Operatic Pop. They are the first Italians to sign with a major US label (Geffen) and the only Italians to be invited to perform at “We Are The World For Haiti” alongside 80 great musicians from all over the world. In Ischgl, concertgoers will get a taste of their “10 Years - Live” world tour, which is expected to take place in 2022."
