        "text": "History highlight:\n\nOn this day in 1999, Moby released his fifth studio album, the critical and commercial success, Play. Although it eventually became the top-selling electronica album of all time, with more than 12 million copies sold worldwide, it had a very modest start. “The week Play was released, it sold, worldwide around 6,000 copies,” Moby told Rolling Stone. “Eleven months after Play was released, it was selling 150,000 copies a week. I was on tour constantly, drunk pretty much the entire time and it was just a blur. And then all of a sudden movie stars started coming to my concerts and I started getting invited to fancy parties and suddenly the journalists who wouldn't return my publicist's calls were talking about doing cover stories. It was a really odd phenomenon.” The key to the album’s breakout success was licensing the mostly instrumental tracks in movies, TV, and commercials. Built from Alan Lomax field recordings, old soul and gospel samples, and danceable electronic beats, the songs are immediately unforgettable.\n\nOn the same date in 2016, Moby put out Porcelain: A Memoir, detailing his rise to success.\n\nAlso, today in:\n\n1963 - Relative newcomers Bob Dylan and Joan Baez appeared with Pete Seeger at the first Monterey Folk Festival.\n\n1965 - Michael Trent Reznor (known professionally as Trent Reznor) was born today in 1965, making him 59 today.
