        "text": "Massachusetts is spoiled to have been the subject of or mentioned in some cool songs over the years.\n\nThink \"Massachusetts\" by the Bee Gees, \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" by Dropkick Murphys or \"Boston\" by Kenny Chesney. James Taylor mentions the Berkshires in \"Sweet Baby James.\" The late Jimmy Buffett shouts out Buzzards Bay in \"Volcano.\" If you've ever been to a winning Red Sox home game, you've heard The Standells sing \"Dirty Water\" on your way out of Fenway.\n\nThe songs are classics, the artists legendary.\n\nThen, there's \"Massachusetts\" by Ylvis. The Norwegian comedy group behind 2013 megahit \"The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)\" released a song all about the Bay State as a follow-up. It lacked the global appeal of its predecessor so it's OK if you haven't heard it. That said, a decade after its release, it's worth a second listen.\n\nBehold the Commonwealth's unofficial European anthem in all its NSFW glory:\n\nFar away across the oceans\n\nAn undiscovered paradise\n\nForget New York and California\n\nThere's a better place - now close your eyes...\n\nLest you think Vegard Ylvis√•ker is earnest as he sings the praises of Massachusetts, a place he \"can't believe\" is real, remember that he's a comedian. The song and the music video are absurd in all the right ways.\n\nREAD MORE: Massachusetts Song in Fred Armisen 'SNL' Sketch Is a Keeper\n\nYlvis spits straight facts about Massachusetts, including that it's a four-hour drive from New York (only true if you're driving from, say, Cape Cod), that it's the 14th biggest state (it's the 45th; Montana is the 14th) and, in an especially weird twist, that it's the home of Nelson Mandela (that would be South Africa).\n\nThe song stays true to places in Massachusetts, mentioning Attleboro, Haverhill, Suffolk County and Pingryville, a village in Ayer and Littleton. You can picture the Ylvis guys looking at a map of Massachusetts and picking out the names they liked.\n\nYlvis is still around and, according to YouTube, still spreading the good word about Massachusetts at concerts.\n\nMaybe if we start a petition to make \"Massachusetts\" our official state song, we can get the guys to perform here.\n\nOh, and just to get in stuck in your head again after a long break, here's \"The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?)\" You're welcome."
