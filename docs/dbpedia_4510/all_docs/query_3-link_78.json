        "text": "Band: X-COMM\n\nFrom: Los Angeles, California\n\nTheir formation story:\n\n(Revel Ian, drums): \"Back in May of 2023, I was getting really into punk/hardcore music and soon after I really wanted to start my own hardcore band. Originally I wanted to call the band 'Excommunicado' after watching John Wick 4. A day later, I quickly realized that Excommunicado would be a pretty big mouthful of a band name. I then thought of 'No Communication' but then realized that was too bland of a name. I was struggling to find the perfect name so I abbreviated the name and quickly landed on X-COMM.\n\n\"Soon after, I quickly recruited my friend Adan Escoto on bass and his friend Erek Gracias on guitar. As much as we love Erek, we soon realized he wasn’t the right fit. Adan and I lost touch for a while and then in November of 2023 we started jamming again hoping to find the right singer/guitarist. We wrote vicious riffs that soon turned into our first songs and were ready to play them as a full band.\n\n\"I put out a flyer on my Instagram describing our sound trying to find a guitarist/singer. The next day I opened my DMs and found a message. It was my friend Michael Gatto from a band I liked called 2dust saying he would sing and play guitar in the band. I was extremely excited and quickly told Adan. X-COMM was born.\n\n\"We practiced all the time and wrote many heavy hardcore bangers while doing so. We played our first show in March of 2024 as a trio in Venice, California. We played a of couple shows as a trio after our first show. Then, Jay Vargas, a sick guitarist from Venice, came on our radar. On April 6th 2024 we played our first show with Jay Vargas and after that X-COMM became a much heavier and tighter band as a whole. In July 2024 we put out our first EP titled Westside Punks.\"\n\nTheir sound in their own words:\n\n\"X-COMM has a very tight, loud, and heavy sound with ripping guitars and an intense rhythm section. Basically, It’ll make you want to destroy everything around you. Our influences are many various hardcore/punk/metal bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, Slayer, Minor Threat, Fugazi, Discharge, Bad Religion, and Black Flag.\"\n\nLatest release info:\n\n\"We recently we recorded our first EP at Secret Hand Studios in Van Nuys, California titled Westside Punks. We made our sound the heaviest we could by recruiting Roy Mayorga (Nausea, Ministry, Soulfy, and Jerry Cantrell to name a few) to produce our EP.\n\n\"Thank you to Jeff Friedl for letting us use your space, Steve Layani for creating the album art, and Cameron for engineering.\"\n\nFuture plans:\n\n\"More shows, more music, and hopefully, a tour somewhere in the future. We have a record release show this Saturday (August 10th) in West Hollywood.\"\n\nWhat other bands from their region should we check out?\n\n\"There are many really good bands that we play with that need love such as Who Cares, Pinche Perro, Seaside Screams, Reject Your Reality, and many more!\"\n\nX-COMM on social media: Instagram"
