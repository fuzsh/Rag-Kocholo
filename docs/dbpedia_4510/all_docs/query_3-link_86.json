        "text": "Oxford Reading Tree & Oxford Levels\n\nHere at Oxford we publish our own reading scheme – the Oxford Reading Tree. The Oxford Reading Tree has over 800 books across different fiction and non-fiction strands including Biff, Chip and Kipper Stories, Songbirds, Traditional Tales, and in Fact. Your child’s school probably has some books from the Oxford Reading Tree and you might even have learned to read with Biff, Chip and Kipper yourself.\n\nWhat are Oxford Levels and Book Bands?\n\nThe books in the Oxford Reading Tree are graded across 20 levels to support your child from first starting to read in Reception to being a fluent reader in Year 6. These levels are matched to the general Book Bands colours.\n\nOxford Levels and Book Bands\n\nDownload our full table of Oxford Levels and Book Bands used at primary school. Find out which Level is best suited to your child, and how Levels 1–20 relate to Book Bands.\n\nThis information is intended as a guide only.\n\nTake a look\n\nLevel 1 books are for children who are just beginning to learn about books and reading. At this stage, your child is likely to be learning the alphabet at nursery, and may be able to recognise some simple, common words.\n\nSome books are wordless, with pictures telling the story. Wordless books provide lots to talk about, and help your child learn how to hold a book and turn the pages.\n\nApproximate age: 3–4 years old\n\nSchool: Nursery\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Lilac | Read with Oxford Stage 1\n\nTaken from The Hedgehog.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 1 >\n\nLevel 1+ books are for children who are just beginning to use simple phonics to read words like ‘sat’ and ’pin’. The books use words that are familiar and predictable, and the pictures help convey the meaning of the story.\n\nApproximate age: 4–5 years old\n\nSchool: Reception\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Pink | Read with Oxford Stage 1\n\nTaken from A Dragon Balloon.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 1+ >\n\nBy this stage, your child will be able to use their knowledge of letters and sounds to work out new words, though they may still need help.\n\nPictures are used to help convey story meaning, and sentences are still mostly short and straightforward. Stories become very slightly more complex as your child becomes more comfortable reading more words.\n\nApproximate age: 4–5 years old\n\nSchool: Reception\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Red | Read with Oxford Stage 2\n\nTaken from Jack.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 2 >\n\nAt this level, your child will be using phonics to help them read slightly more complicated words, including words with common digraphs like ‘ee’, ‘oa’, ‘ch’, and ‘th’. They will use phonics knowledge to work out less familiar words.\n\nApproximate age: 4–5 years old\n\nSchool: Reception\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Yellow | Read with Oxford Stage 2\n\nTaken from The Right Home.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 3 >\n\nBy Level 4, your child will be using their phonics knowledge to work out words quickly, and will know a range of common tricky words (like ‘said’, ‘some’, and ‘what’) by sight. They are likely to be more confident in giving their opinion about stories and non-fiction texts.\n\nApproximate age: 4–6 years old\n\nSchool: Reception and Year 1\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Light Blue | Read with Oxford Stage 3\n\nTaken from The Stinky Plant.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 4 >\n\nBy Level 5, your child will start learning alternative spellings for the sounds in words – for example, they will learn that the letters ‘ou’ can be pronounced like ‘ow’ or ‘oo’.\n\nLevel 5 books may contain words with apostrophes, such as ‘didn’t’ and ‘wasn’t’. They will also introduce children to unusual words that extend their vocabulary, like ‘terrible’ instead of ‘bad’.\n\nApproximate age: 5–6 years old\n\nSchool: Year 1\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Green | Read with Oxford Stage 3\n\nTaken from The Parachute.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 5 >\n\nStories in Level 6 are longer and more complex than in previous levels.\n\nBy Level 6, your child will often notice when their reading does not make sense, and they will go back to correct themselves without being asked to. They will be able to work out many words automatically without sounding them out. They will be working on more alternative spellings for different sounds – for example, they may know that the ‘igh’ sound can also be spelled ‘ie’, ‘y, or ‘i’.\n\nApproximate age: 5–6 years old\n\nSchool: Year 1\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Orange | Read with Oxford Stage 4\n\nTaken from Who Eats Who.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 6 >\n\nAt Level 7, most children can read out loud quite fluently and can usually find the answer to a question within a section of text. Your child will get used to words with unusual phonics patterns, such as ‘beautiful’, ‘eye’, and ‘any’. Words with several syllables will often be included.\n\nApproximate age: 5–6 years old\n\nSchool: Year 1 and Year 2\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Turquoise | Read with Oxford Stage 4\n\nTaken from Planet Exis.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 7 >\n\nAt Level 8, children are generally more confident in their reading and know most common, non-decodable tricky words. Level 8 stories are often split into chapters. Your child is likely to enjoy choosing which books to read, often reading some of the text in order to help them decide.\n\nApproximate age: 6–7 years old\n\nSchool: Years 2 and 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Purple and Brown | Read with Oxford Stage 5\n\nTaken from Mini Marvels.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 8 >\n\nOnce your child is at Level 9, they will be able to read most words automatically, either silently or out loud. With non-fiction texts, they will be able to use features like indexes, headings, and photo captions to find information.\n\nApproximate age: 6–8 years old\n\nSchool: Years 2 and 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Gold and Brown | Read with Oxford Stage 5\n\nTaken from False Alarms.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 9 >\n\nBy Level 10, your child will be building up their stamina to read longer texts. They will use parts of unfamiliar words to help them work out the meaning (for example, spotting that ‘clarify’ is a bit like ‘clear’ so ‘clarify’ means ‘to make clear’).\n\nApproximate age: 6–8 years old\n\nSchool: Years 2 and 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band White and Brown | Read with Oxford Stage 6\n\nTaken from A Life in the Sky.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 10 >\n\nChildren at Level 11 usually show a good understanding of what they are reading, and automatically take account of punctuation when they read. Your child may begin to read between the lines more confidently, working out information that may only be hinted at in the text.\n\nApproximate age: 6–8 years old\n\nSchool: Years 2 and 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Lime and Brown | Read with Oxford Stage 6\n\nTaken from Tasty Travels.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 11 >\n\nBy Level 12, your child will be using clues from a text to help them work out the meaning of words. They will use inference and empathy to understand the narrator’s feelings.\n\nApproximate age: 6–8 years old\n\nSchool: Years 2 and 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Lime+ and Grey | Read with Oxford Stage 6\n\nTaken from The Crayfish Catchers.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 12 >\n\nBy Level 13, your child will probably be able to read for 20 or 30 minutes at a time. They will be learning to skim and scan non-fiction texts to find information and answer questions.\n\nApproximate age: 7–8 years old\n\nSchool: Year 3\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Grey\n\nTaken from Peter and the Wolf.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 13 >\n\nChildren at Level 14 can read increasingly complex stories and non-fiction confidently and fluently. Your child will be able to express an opinion about a story or non-fiction book, and may sometimes back up their opinion with quotations from the text.\n\nApproximate age: 7–9 years old\n\nSchool: Years 3 and 4\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Grey\n\nTaken from Grace the Pirate.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 14 >\n\nBy Level 15, your child will sometimes independently read several chapters of a book in one go. They may be introduced to more technical language and demanding vocabulary. At school, your child will probably be learning to understand charts and diagrams in non-fiction texts.\n\nApproximate age: 8–9 years old\n\nSchool: Year 4\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Dark Blue\n\nTaken from Animal Tales.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 15 >\n\nAt Level 16, your child will be more confident in using inference, learning about characters through dialogue as well as direct description. They may be able to retell a story from the point of view of a different character.\n\nApproximate age: 8–10 years old\n\nSchool: Years 4 and 5\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Dark Blue\n\nTaken from Exploring the Deep.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 16 >\n\nBy now, your child will be reading books and non-fiction texts that are very varied in structure, tone, language, and approach. They will be able to detect and discuss some of the ways in which an author’s writing can influence how readers feel about a book.\n\nApproximate age: 10–11 years old\n\nSchool: Year 6\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Dark Red\n\nTaken from The Rise of the Empty People.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 19 >\n\nAt Level 20, children can read challenging, age-appropriate novels and non-fiction texts independently and fluently. They know that there may be different layers of meaning in a text, and will be able to identify some underlying themes and ideas.\n\nApproximate age: 10–11 years old\n\nSchool: Year 6\n\nEquivalent to: Book Band Dark Red\n\nTaken from Selkie Summer.\n\nBrowse free eBooks at Oxford Level 20 >\n\nWhich series are in Oxford Reading Tree?\n\nBecause children need a diverse range of texts to build their vocabulary, and we know that different children are engaged by different genres and topics, Oxford Reading Tree has developed an extensive range of series to help schools teach children to read, to enjoy reading.\n\nOxford Reading Tree series include:"
