        "text": "Celebrating the release of their new album\n\nSnow Patrol have announced two relatively intimate concerts for next month to celebrate the release of their eighth studio album ‘The Forest is the Path.’\n\nGary Lightbody, Johnny McDaid and Nathan Connolly will play the 1,500-capacity KOKO in London on Wednesday 11th September and the 1,000-capacity Belfast Ulster Hall on Friday 13th September – the same day ‘The Forest is the Path’ is released.\n\nTickets for the London and Belfast will fly fast when they go on sale from Absolute Radio Tickets at 10am on Wednesday 14th August.\n\nThe two concerts precede Snow Patrol’s major UK & Ireland arena tour in February 2025 that visits London, Birmingham, Cardiff, Hull, Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and Belfast. Tickets are available HERE.\n\nAlongside announcing the two album launch shows, Snow Patrol have also premiered their new single ‘All’, which you can lend your lugholes to here:\n\nFrontman Gary Lightbody says of the track: “All was written by Fraser T Smith and myself in late November of 2022. This was almost exactly a year before we would ask Fraser to produce the album. The first time we recorded the album it didn’t work out and we would then ask Fraser to step into the producer’s chair in December of 2023 and he was a dream to work with.\n\n\"The first day of writing with him I walked into the studio and he had already got some music going. It was all very much “hi, how are you, what about this?” and BAM we were off. I love when that happens. Not really a fan of the small talk. I like big talk. And when you’re writing a song with someone you have to get to the big talk (or what’s the point), so why wait?\n\n\"My memory is that it all came together very quickly. I wrote a melody and some words while Fraser built the track and in a couple of hours we had a really great rough version of the song.\n\n\"Then Johnny and Nathan put some extraordinary guitars, keys and piano on it, not to mention incredible backing vocals and so many things which lifted the song massively. Another example of the three of us being locked-in together on this record, it felt like something truly special was happening in the studio.\"\n\nSnow Patrol’s UK tour dates:\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024\n\nLondon KOKO – Wed 11th\n\nBelfast Ulster Hall – Fri 13th\n\nFEBRUARY 2025\n\nLondon The O2 – Sat 15th\n\nBirmingham Resorts World Arena – Sun 16th\n\nCardiff Utilita Arena – Tue 18th\n\nHull Connexin Live – Wed 19th\n\nGlasgow OVO Hydro – Fri 21st\n\nManchester Co-op Live Arena – Sat 22nd\n\nDublin 3Arena – Tue 25th\n\nBelfast SSE Arena – Thu 27th\n\nBuy Snow Patrol tickets\n\nThe original names of famous bands, including Snow Patrol:\n\nListen to Absolute Radio across the UK on your digital radio, the free Rayo app, by hitting that play button on the bottom of your screen or by asking your smart speaker to \"play Absolute Radio\"."
