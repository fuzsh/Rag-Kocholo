        "text": "0 to 6 months\n\nHold your baby close and look at them as you talk to them. Babies love faces and will watch you and respond as you talk.\n\nChat about what you're doing as you feed, change and bathe them.\n\nSing to your baby – this helps them tune in to the rhythm of language.\n\nRepeat the sounds your baby makes back to them – this teaches your baby lessons about listening and taking turns in a conversation.\n\nTalk in a sing-song voice – this helps to keep your baby's attention.\n\n6 to 12 months\n\nName and point to things you can both see, for example, \"Look, a cat\". This helps your baby learn words and, in time, they'll start to copy you. As your baby gets older, add more detail, such as, \"Look, a black cat\".\n\nStart looking at books with your baby – you do not have to read the words on the page, just talk about what you can see.\n\nOnly offer a dummy when it's time for sleep. It's hard to learn to talk with a dummy in your mouth. Aim to stop using dummies completely by 12 months.\n\nPlay games like \"peek-a-boo\" and \"round and round the garden\". This teaches your baby important skills like taking turns, paying attention, and listening.\n\n12 to 18 months\n\nIf your child is trying to say a word but gets it wrong, say the word properly. For example, if they point to a cat and say \"Ca!\" you should respond with, \"Yes, it's a cat\". Do not criticise or tell them off for getting the word wrong.\n\nIncrease your child's vocabulary by giving them choices, such as, \"Do you want an apple or a banana?\".\n\nToys and books that make a noise will help your child's listening skills.\n\nEnjoy singing nursery rhymes and songs together as your baby grows, especially those with actions, such as \"Pat-a-cake\", \"Row, row, row your boat\" and \"Wind the bobbin up\". Doing the actions helps your child to remember the words.\n\n18 to 24 months\n\nRepeat words, for example, \"Where are your shoes?\", \"Are you wearing blue shoes today?\" and \"Let's put your shoes on\". Repetition helps your child to remember words.\n\nUse simple instructions – your child will understand some instructions at this age, such as \"Get your coat\" or '\"Shut the door\". Keeping instructions short and simple will help your child understand.\n\nTry asking \"Where's your...\" – ask your child to point to their ear, nose, foot, and so on.\n\nLimit your child's daily TV time - playing and listening to stories is more helpful when they're learning to talk.\n\n2 to 3 years\n\nHelp them build sentences – your child will start to put simple sentences together at around age 2. Try to reply using sentences that are a few words longer. For example, if they say, \"sock off\", respond with \"yes, we're taking your sock off\".\n\nGet your child's attention by saying their name at the start of a sentence. If you ask a question, give them plenty of time to answer you.\n\nTeach them about words that go together – for example, you could show them a ball, teddy and a rattle and then say the word ‘toy’.\n\nStart using sounds with meaning (symbolic sounds), like saying \"whoops\" or \"uh-oh\" when you drop something accidentally, or saying \"meow\" while showing them a picture of a cat.\n\nSwitch off the television and radio – background noise makes it harder for your child to listen to you.\n\nTalk as you clean – children this age love to help. Chat about what you're doing as you do chores like shopping, cooking and cleaning together.\n\nThe Speech and Language UK website has more information about stages of speech and language development at different ages.\n\nYou can also find activities for you to try with your baby or child on the Words for Life website.\n\nThink your child may have a speech or language problem?\n\nIf you're worried about your child's speech or language development, talk to your GP or health visitor. If necessary, they'll refer your child to your local speech and language therapy department.\n\nIf you prefer, you can refer your child to a speech and language therapist yourself.\n\nFind answers to common questions about speech and language assessments, and information about assessment services on the Speech and Language UK website.\n\nHow to help your bilingual child\n\nLots of children grow up in a family where more than one language is spoken. This can be an advantage to children in their learning. Knowing another language will help the development of their English.\n\nThe important thing is to talk to your child in whatever language feels comfortable to you. This may mean that one parent uses one language, while the other uses a different language. Children adapt to this very well.\n\nVideo: when will my child start talking? (1 to 2-and-a-half years)\n\nIn this video, a health visitor talks about when you should expect your child to start talking."
