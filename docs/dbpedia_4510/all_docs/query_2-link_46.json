With Soundrop there are no hidden fees, no fees for collaborators, and you always get paid on time!\n\n“I love how easy it is to get my stuff up on stores, and I know that Soundrop has a vested interest in my music succeeding. And whenever I run into issues, it’s easy to reach someone to ask questions or troubleshoot.”\n\n“Soundrop has changed my life. The only reason I have been able to be a full-time artist has been because how easy Soundrop has made it to monetize my music and get it to my biggest supporters.\n\n“My favorite thing is how artist-centric they are. I don’t use other distributors because of the customer service and relationship I get from Soundrop. I look forward to working with them for a lifelong journey of music.”"
