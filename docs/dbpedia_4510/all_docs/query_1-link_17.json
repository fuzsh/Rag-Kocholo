        "text": "Perhaps no other milestone besides walking generates as much anticipation as a baby's first words. Everyone wants to see—and hear—what their child has to say. But it takes children time to develop language skills. Many babies do not utter \"mama,\" \"dada,\" or \"baba\" until well into their first year. So, if your toddler is not talking, how do you know if they are developmentally on track or a late bloomer?\n\nRead on to learn about your baby's developing speech, signs of language disorders, and what to expect with language development.\n\nWhen Most Babies Start Talking\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), most babies go through the following milestones when learning to talk:\n\n4 to 7 months: Babbling and mimicking repetitive sounds (bah, dah)\n\n6 or 7 months: Mimic simple words (mama, dada, dog, go)\n\n8 to 12 months: Attaching meaning to gestures, words, and phrases\n\nBy 1 year: May say one or two simple words (mama, dada, bye)\n\nWhen Most Babies Say Their First Word\n\nMost children will say their first word around their first birthday. But every child and situation is unique, and what is \"normal\" for one baby may not be the norm for your kid.\n\nThis means some children will utter their first true word at 7 months while others may remain mum until 17 months. Still, if you are worried about your toddler not talking, you can (and should) speak with a health care provider.\n\nSigns of Language Disorders in Toddlers\n\nThe signs of language developmental disorders are grouped into two categories: expressive and receptive language. Expressive language is how a child uses words to express themselves, while receptive language is how a child understands language. Signs of disorders are different for each.\n\nExpressive language disorders\n\nSome of the most common symptoms of expressive language disorders in toddlers include difficulty with the following:\n\nUsing gestures\n\nExpressing themselves\n\nAsking questions\n\nSinging songs\n\nNaming objects\n\nUsing words correctly\n\nGenerally speaking, toddlers with expressive language disorders have problems expressing thoughts and ideas. This can extend to asking questions and using gestures.\n\nReceptive language disorders\n\nToddlers with receptive language disorders may have difficulty with the following:\n\nFollowing directions\n\nUnderstanding what people say\n\nUnderstanding gestures\n\nAnswering questions\n\nPointing to things when asked\n\nLearning new words\n\nSometimes, kids can have both expressive and receptive language disorders. In addition, older kids can have reading and writing delays, which may be related to a learning disability.\n\nHow to Help a Toddler Learn to Talk\n\nThe age at which kids begin talking typically ranges from 6 to 18 months. In general, there is no need to worry if your toddler isn't talking and seems \"behind\"—even if they are at the older end of that range.\n\nOf course, if your child is 19 months old and still not talking, you may be concerned, but this, too, can be normal. It takes some children longer to master speech than others. Ask a health care provider or consult a speech pathologist when in doubt. Doctors tend not to worry too much unless a child shows other warning signs (like those above) or hasn't spoken by age 2.\n\nIn the meantime, the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association recommends the following for helping toddlers learn to talk:\n\nEncourage your child to say simple sounds after you (like \"ma,\" \"da,\" and \"ba\").\n\nPretend to have conversations with your child when they babble.\n\nRespond to their gestures.\n\nEncourage them to mirror you with games like pat-a-cake and peek-a-boo.\n\nTalk to them about activities you do and places you go.\n\nPoint out colors and shapes.\n\nCount the things you see.\n\nUse gestures like pointing.\n\nName animal sounds.\n\nWhen your child says a simple word, add a sentence, like \"Dog. Yes! That's a dog. He's going for a walk.\"\n\nRead to your child.\n\nThese activities prepare your child for talking by helping them understand the meaning behind gestures and words. It also gives them practice with the art of conversation.\n\nHealth Conditions That Can Affect Speech Development\n\nThere is not always a known cause for speech delays, but certain conditions can cause a speech delay. These include:\n\nAutism\n\nFrequent ear infections\n\nBrain injury\n\nCerebral palsy\n\nDown syndrome or Fragile X syndrome\n\nFamily history of speech delays or language problems\n\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorder\n\nHearing loss or deafness\n\nLearning disabilities\n\nLow birth weight\n\nStroke\n\nSince speech delays can sometimes be caused by previously undiagnosed medical issues, seeking a health care provider's input if you suspect a delay is essential.\n\nTreatment for Speech Delays in Toddlers\n\nTo diagnose whether a toddler not talking is due to a speech delay, a health care provider will interact with your child, order a hearing test, and refer you to a speech pathologist for testing or an early intervention program.\n\nFormal speech therapy is often recommended for speech delay. However, if your toddler has an expressive and receptive delay, your child may need further evaluation to screen for a communication disorder, developmental delays, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or another developmental concern.\n\nQuestions to Ask Yourself if Your Child Is Not Talking\n\nIf you're experiencing difficulty understanding or communicating with your toddler and are starting to worry if there might be a problem, ask yourself the following questions.\n\nDo They Show Interest in Others?\n\nWhen at home and other people enter or leave the room, your child should notice and react. Reactions could include smiling when seeing a familiar person, crying when you leave, or trying to follow you as you exit a room. Your toddler should be interested in what other people are doing, for instance, if someone is eating, reading a book, or playing with a toy nearby.\n\nDo They React to Music?\n\nMost toddlers show some sort of reaction to music. If your child is clapping their hands, swaying or attempting to dance, shaking their head, humming, or attempting to sing, then don't be concerned. If they don't do these things, there could be a problem.\n\nDo They Mimic the Sounds Around Them?\n\nWhile everyone's voice will have unique characteristics, your toddler's speech patterns should reflect what they hear around them. Their long a may be drawn out or show a bit of twang if you're from the South, for example, and that's perfectly normal. Their long a or any of their vowel sounds should not sound consistently off or inaccurate to your ears, though.\n\nDo They Pronounce Consonants Correctly?\n\nIf your child's vowel sounds sound pretty normal to you but they have their own way of saying certain words that don't seem to improve over time, that can be grounds for concern. Examples of this include frequently leaving off the beginning or ending consonants or always replacing a t for a c sound.\n\nDo They Know and Respond to Their Name?\n\nWhen you say your child's name, they should turn their head toward you or look directly at you. Babies as young as 6 months can do this. Talk to a health care professional if it hasn't happened by your child's first birthday.\n\nWhen to See a Health Care Provider\n\nIf your toddler is not talking or meeting milestones such as babbling by 9 months or pointing by 12 months, then it may be time to talk to a pediatrician or health care provider.\n\nTypically, a late-talking child will catch up with their peers. However, research suggests that speech delays can persist in 40-60% of cases, and these kids are at greater risk of social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive problems in adulthood.\n\nFor these children, the consequences of waiting can be devastating. Undetected disorders have been linked to poor reading and academic performance and also emotional problems. \"I've seen children as young as 3 who are self-conscious about their speech, which can lead to low self-esteem,\" says Marilyn Agin, MD, a neurodevelopmental pediatrician, medical director of the Early Intervention Program in New York City, and co-author of The Late Talker: What to Do if Your Child Isn't Talking Yet.\n\nYou may want to talk to a health care provider about your concerns if:\n\nBy 9 months, your infant has yet to babble, or they babble with few or no consonant sounds.\n\nBy 12 months, your baby looks at something they want but does not use gestures, like pointing, to show you what they desire.\n\nBy 16 months, you still haven't heard your child's first word(s).\n\nBy 24 to 30 months, your child has not spoken in two-word phrases, like \"more cookie.\"\n\nBy 36 months, your child says only single-syllable words with no final consonants (\"ca\" for cat, \"beh\" for bed), don't ask questions, and have frequent tantrums when not understood.\n\n\"You know your child best,\" says Dr. Agin. \"If, deep down, you suspect there's something wrong, and you're not satisfied with the response from your pediatrician, make an appointment with a speech pathologist or a neurodevelopmental pediatrician.\""
