        "text": "Key Takeaways\n\nSound levels are most commonly measured in decibels (dB), which range from barely audible to loud enough to cause physical pain.\n\nThe risk of hearing loss starts at around 70 dB.\n\nExposure to sounds at 85-decibel levels and above damages your hearing.\n\nA normal conversation registers at around 60 decibels.\n\nExposure to sounds at 120 decibels may cause discomfort, and 140 decibels is considered the threshold of pain.\n\nWhether the cause is genetic, age-related, or environmental, approximately 60 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss. Preserving your hearing health is important for basic communication, balance, health, and even brain acuity. Regardless of your age or your degree of hearing loss, it’s important to limit excessive noise exposure and use protective equipment when you’re around loud sounds for extended periods of time.\n\nOur Reviews Team assembled this guide to help you better understand decibels, the measurement of sound, and how sound impacts your hearing health.\n\nWhat are decibels, and why do they matter?\n\nA decibel is a measurement that expresses the relative intensity of a sound pressure level (SPL). This is calculated relative to the threshold of human hearing, which is 0 decibels. Decibels are essential for setting guidelines and safety standards for sound exposure limitations. Rather than setting a subjective standard (how loud a sound is to the subject), the objective nature of a decibel measurement, which measures how intense the sound energy is in a confined space, makes regulation significantly easier.\n\nHow sound is measured\n\nSound is measured in decibels, which are measured on a logarithmic scale. The two types of scales for measurement are linear and logarithmic.\n\nA linear scale is used for measuring the space between two points, like distance and length. In contrast, a logarithmic scale is used to measure values based on human perception, which has a broad range of possible quantities, like power and intensity.\n\nBrightness and sound are both examples of values measured on the logarithmic scale. The larger the decibel, the more intense the sound. As sound intensity increases, our ears become less sensitive to small changes.\n\nDecibel levels chart\n\nSound data sources: Noise Sources and Their Effects and Levels of Noise in Decibels.\n\nHow is hearing loss measured?\n\nHearing loss is measured using a chart called an audiogram, which plots a person’s hearing thresholds in each ear. For example, a person can have no degree of hearing loss in their right ear but have moderate hearing loss in their left ear.\n\n“An audiogram is expressed using decibels hearing level (HL) rather than decibels sound pressure level,” noted Brad Ingrao, AuD, a practicing audiologist since 1992 and active member of the Hearing Loss Association of America. He further explained this is because “[Decibel sound pressure level] is the actual physical measurement of the sound energy,” whereas “[Decibel hearing level] is a conversion of decibel sound pressure level to normalize the audiogram graph relative to how people with normal hearing hear pitch.” In other words, an audiogram measures a person’s degree of hearing loss by comparing their results to a graph of how a person without hearing loss hears.\n\nEach threshold in the table below represents a range of decibels, which may be hard for a person of the indicated hearing loss degree to hear. For example, an adult with no hearing loss can generally hear sounds above 25 decibels but may have trouble hearing decibels between 0–25 decibels. Alternatively, an adult with severe hearing loss can generally hear sounds above 90 decibels but may have trouble hearing sounds below and between 71–90 decibels.\n\nTable 2 Degrees of hearing loss\n\nHow do I know if a sound is safe?\n\nAccording to the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, “Long or repeated exposure to sound at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss.” The higher the decibels, the shorter the exposure time is before hearing damage may occur. For example, a motorcycle (95 decibels sound pressure level) can cause damage to hearing after about 50 minutes of exposure, but being around a jet plane taking off with no hearing protection gear can cause immediate damage or even cause eardrums to rupture. According to Sumeet Kumar, PhD, who is a geneticist and the founder of GenesWellness, this is because “the inner ear has tiny hair cells that vibrate when hit by sound waves, which translates them into signals the brain understands as sound. Loud noises can damage these delicate cells, resulting in hearing loss.”\n\nEven if you’re around sounds less than the 85-decibel threshold, you may not experience discomfort or actual pain in your ears, but you may become annoyed with the loudness. The physical effects of intense sound are just one way to tell if the sounds you’re hearing may be unsafe for an extended period of time. Thankfully, there are a couple of ways to measure whether a sound you’re around is at a safe level.\n\nHow to measure decibel levels\n\nThe most basic way to measure sound is by using a sound level meter. Stores, like Home Depot, sell hand-held sound level meter devices that show the decibels on a screen with an accuracy within 1.5 decibels. If you have a smartphone, you can choose from various phone applications to work the same way using the microphone on your device.\n\nNIOSH Sound Level Meter App (Apple device application store)\n\nNoiSee (Apple device application store)\n\nSound Meter – Decibel & SPL (Android device application store)\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, you can use the Noise App, which pushes an alert when your phone microphone detects decibels that may cause hearing loss if exposure continues for an extended period of time (determined by the decibels detected).\n\nProtecting your hearing health\n\nAccording to Kumar, even just “a single loud blast can cause irreversible damage, affecting one’s hearing permanently.” One of the easiest ways to protect yourself against hearing loss is to limit exposure to loud noises. This can be in small increments, like reducing the volume in headphones or earbuds when listening to music or audiobooks, or on a larger scale, like opting out of events you know will exceed the recommended exposure.\n\nGeneral hearing health protection tips:\n\nBe mindful of the volume on your devices (television, smartphone, and tablet), and reduce the volume when you can.\n\nIf using headphones or earbuds, keep the volume low and take frequent breaks.\n\nUse quiet products when possible (for example, purchasing quieter appliances and power tools).\n\nUse hearing protection, like earplugs, if you’re going somewhere potentially loud and can’t control the volume (for example, in a movie theater or at a school play).\n\nLook for notices (through email or on paper flyers) with warnings of excessive noise and avoid locations accordingly.\n\nAs with many factors impacting your health, there are some you can control and others you can’t. Those out of your control include workplace noise, outside ambient sounds, and live events. Just because the intensity of these sounds is out of your control, doesn’t mean you can’t use protective gear to keep yourself safe.\n\nOccupational noise\n\nHearing loss is one of the most common disabilities claimed by veterans of the U.S. armed forces and is one of the reasons those who work on aircraft carriers (140 decibels sound pressure level) and other flight decks are required to wear protective gear.\n\nNoise is a unique workplace hazard because exposure also occurs outside the workplace. For example, even if a regulation limits exposure to decibel levels for a plant worker to five hours daily, the same worker can still surpass the limit just by walking around outside after work. In contrast, a person exposed to radiation or toxins in the workplace will likely only come into contact with the hazard at work and nowhere else, making it easier to regulate and protect workers. If you’re working in a loud work environment, like in the military or in construction, follow the protection tips below.\n\nOccupational noise hearing protection tips:\n\nWear the required protective gear (ear plugs, ear muffs, noise-canceling headphones) and consider purchasing even stronger protective gear than required.\n\nIf possible, choose a job where you’re around loud noises less frequently or request a position change in a quieter location.\n\nIf you have control over the equipment used, consider purchasing quieter tools.\n\nIf you’re working in an environment where no noise protection is advised and you’re noticing hearing loss, contact your local Occupational Safety and Health Administration branch and learn about your options.\n\nTake advantage of disability and other programs if hearing loss occurs while working in a loud environment.\n\nLive events\n\nLive concerts and other events can be fun, but they can also cause temporary and sometimes permanent hearing damage if they are too loud for too long. Since these are usually events you choose to attend, be mindful of how often you’re going, how long the event will be, and whether the venue is enclosed or open air. Enclosed venues often amplify noise, but even events at open-air venues can be harmful to your ears.\n\nLive event hearing protection tips:\n\nOpt out of unnecessary and easily avoidable events.\n\nUse protective gear, like foam earplugs, ear muffs, or noise-reducing ear plugs, which still let sound in but work to reduce excessive noise (these are a great alternative for concerts when you want to hear music but still protect your ears).\n\nWhen you’re somewhere, like a concert or sporting event, sit somewhere far from the loudspeakers.\n\nIf possible, take breaks by walking away from the venue and having time away from the loud noises.\n\nBottom line\n\nDecibel measurements are important because they give us a standardized and versatile means to quantify sound levels across a broad range. This enables us to not only understand hearing loss and find treatment options, like hearing aids, but also helps us set sound-related safety standards in the workplace and in everyday life. If you’re worried about whether a sound you’re around could be damaging to your hearing, download one of the smartphone applications above, or purchase a sound level meter from your local hardware store. This way, you can test the sound around you and ensure you stay safe.\n\nHave questions about this review? Email us at reviewsteam@ncoa.org.\n\nSources"
