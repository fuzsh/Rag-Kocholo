Talk with your child’s doctor, share your concerns, and ask about developmental screening.\n\nIf you or the doctor are still concerned:\n\nAsk for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate your child more; and\n\nCall your state or territory’s early intervention program to find out if your child can get services to help. Learn more and find the number at cdc.gov/FindEI."
