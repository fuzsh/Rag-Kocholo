(NOTE: The AFM contact for this date lists Brian, Carl, Dennis, Alan and Bruce as having played on this track. However, on the surviving session tape, only Brian, Carl and Dennis are clearly audible on the basic track, which includes just drums, organ, one guitar and tambourine. As Brian was on the studio floor, Bruce was in the control booth, helping Chuck Britz direct the session. The tambourine apparently was played by Alan Jardine or an uncredited Terry Melcher; Brian has named the latter on at least one occasion.)
