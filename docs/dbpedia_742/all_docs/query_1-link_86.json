Because she suffered from chronic rheumatoid arthritis that sometimes required her hospitalization, Albanese’s mother provided for herself and her son with a government disability pension. For most of his childhood Albanese believed that his father had died in an automobile accident, but his mother revealed to him when he was 14 that he was the product of a shipboard relationship with an Italian steward on the cruise ship on which she had traveled to Europe. Pregnant, unmarried, and Roman Catholic, she had returned to Sydney to live with her parents and concocted a fictional marriage to and death of the man whose last name she assumed. Only after his mother’s death did Albanese pursue information about his father, whose whereabouts he learned by investigating the records of the ship line on which his mother had traveled. In 2009 Albanese, then age 46, traveled to Italy to meet and begin a relationship with his father and his half-siblings.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAustralian Government and Political System\n\nFrom his mother Albanese inherited a loyalty to three fundamental institutions on which to base his belief system: Catholicism, the South Sydney Rabbitohs rugby league team, and the Australian Labor Party. At age 12 he participated in his first political action, joining with fellow public housing residents to successfully block an attempt by the local government to sell their homes. In 1979, while still in his teens, Albanese joined the Labor Party. After attending St. Joseph’s Primary School in Camperdown and St. Mary’s Cathedral College in central Sydney, he worked for roughly two years for Commonwealth Bank. Then, benefiting from the tuition-free university policy that had been introduced by Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, Albanese matriculated at the University of Sydney, where he participated in student government while earning a degree in economics.\n\nRising career in politics\n\nFollowing his graduation in 1984, Albanese began some five years of work as a research officer for the Labor politician who would become his mentor, Tom Uren, then minister for local government and administrative services, later deputy leader of the Labor Party. During this period Albanese also served (1985–87) as the president of Young Labor in New South Wales. From 1989 until 1995 he was the assistant general secretary of the state’s Labor Party, and from 1995 to 1996 he acted as a senior policy adviser for New South Wales Premier Bob Carr.\n\nIn 1996 Albanese was elected to the seat in the federal House of Representatives for Grayndler, the constituency in which he had grown up. He would be reelected nine times (1998, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2022). In his maiden speech in the House, he said, “For myself, I will be satisfied if I can be remembered as someone who will stand up for the interests of my electorate, for working-class people, for the labor movement, and for our progressive advancement as a nation into the next century.” Having begun his political career as a member of Labor’s hard left, Albanese rose slowly through the party’s ranks, acting as an early and forceful advocate of LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage. He also took an active role in arguing against the construction of Hindmarsh Island Bridge in South Australia, an issue that not only pitted developers against environmentalists but also divided members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders communities.\n\nAlbanese’s tenure on Labor’s front benches began with his service as shadow minister for ageing and seniors (2001–02) and continued with a number of other shadow ministerial appointments until 2007, when Labor regained power. He became minister for infrastructure, transport, regional development, and local government (2007–10) in the first government of Kevin Rudd and leader of the House (2008–13). He also served as minister for infrastructure and transport (2010–13) and minister for regional development and local government (2013) for Rudd’s successor, Julia Gillard, and as deputy prime minister (2013), minister for broadband, communications, and the digital economy (2013), and deputy party leader (2013) when Rudd returned as prime minister. A confidante of both Rudd and Gillard as well as a true believer in party unity, Albanese was shaken badly by the acrimony and self-inflicted wounds to the Labor Party that resulted from Rudd and Gillard’s internecine power struggle. Following Labor’s loss of power in the September 2013 federal election, Albanese assumed a new set of shadow ministerial portfolios: shadow minister for infrastructure and transport (2013–16), shadow minister for tourism (2013–19), shadow minister for cities (2014–16), and shadow minister for infrastructure, transport, cities, and regional development (2016–19).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In 2013 he served as host and curator of an episode of the popular Australian late-night music-video television show Rage, on which he revealed a predilection for alternative rockers from the 1980s and ’90s, such as Nirvana, the Pixies, and Hunters and Collectors. A gig as a deejay at a Labor Party fundraiser led to other charity events at which “D.J. Albo” shed his suit and donned a polo shirt and leather jacket to spin records. During this period a craft brewery in Albanese’s electoral district named a beer Albo in his honour. In 2019 Albanese separated from his wife of some 19 years, Carmel Tebbutt, onetime deputy premier of New South Wales.\n\nLeadership of the Labor Party and the 2022 national election\n\nThe demise of his marriage was not the only loss that Albanese suffered in 2019. After leading in preference polling for most of the run-up to that year’s federal election, Labor, under the leadership of Bill Shorten, fell at the final hurdle and was bested by incumbent prime minister Scott Morrison and the Liberal-National coalition. In the wake of Labor’s devastating defeat, the party turned to Albanese, who was elected unopposed as party leader in late May 2019. His attempts to distinguish himself as the leader of the opposition were complicated, however, by the arrival in Australia of the global coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic early in 2020, which by necessity put Prime Minister Morrison in the spotlight and often relegated Albanese to the penumbra. Still, even as he supported the government’s efforts to combat the virus, Albanese was not averse to pointing out what he saw as mistakes in Morrison’s response to the crisis. He was particularly critical of the government’s slow implementation of the country’s coronavirus vaccination program (lambasted as a “stroll out”), which would contribute mightily to a precipitous fall in the public’s approval of the prime minister’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nIn January 2021 Albanese’s life reached another important crossroads when he was involved in a two-automobile collision in Sydney in which he sustained serious injuries. The accident left him determined to do everything he could to make an impact as a public servant and to undertake healthier life choices. In the process he lost some 40 pounds, and, hoping to make himself a more attractive candidate, he underwent something of a style makeover that included new eyeglasses and a spruced-up wardrobe.\n\nAs he positioned himself to take on Morrison in the election that would be called for May 21, 2022, Albanese adopted a seemingly cautious approach to policy—dubbed “small target”—that distanced him from a raft of specific policies that had proved unpopular for Labor in the 2019 election. Nevertheless, in the wake of another round of widespread bushfires and flooding in 2021 that was widely blamed on climate change, Albanese staked out a climate policy that set a carbon emissions reduction target of 43 percent by 2030 and promised to increase the share of renewable energy in the national electricity market to 82 percent. While these targets were less ambitious than those cited by Labor in the 2019 campaign, they were in marked contrast to Morrison’s proposed 26–28 percent cuts. Albanese also pledged to increase the minimum wage and to provide more government support for health care, child care, and nursing homes. For their part, Morrison and the coalition took a familiar page from the Liberal playbook and claimed that a Labor government would wreck the economy through its incompetence and overspending on social programs.\n\nFor many voters, the election shaped up as a personality contest between Albanese and Morrison, whose leadership style struck some Australians as blustery and autocratic. Neither candidate, however, had high approval ratings in opinion polling. It may then have been more a rejection of Morrison than an enthusiastic embrace of Albanese when voters sent the Liberal-National coalition packing by handing it 58 seats in elections for the 151-seat House of Representatives while vaulting Labor into power with an absolute majority of 77 seats. A raft of community-recruited independent candidates who were focused on gender equity and climate-related policy had contributed mightily to Labor’s victory by displacing a number of Liberal incumbents. In the end, Albanese prepared to the lead the country by saying:\n\nMy fellow Australians, it says a lot about our great country that a son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing down the road in Camperdown can stand before you tonight as Australia’s prime minister.\n\nPremiership\n\nIn September 2022 Albanese notched a significant victory when legislation was enacted setting the goal of a 43 percent emissions reduction by 2030. Other initiatives introduced by his government involved care for the aged, subsidized childcare, reduction in the cost of medicine, and paid leave for victims of domestic violence. After a landmark encounter with Xi Jinping in Indonesia in November 2022, Albanese managed to reset relations with China, prompting the cancellation of Chinese embargoes on Australian timber and coal. Nevertheless, in March 2023 former Labor prime minister Paul Keating lambasted Albanese for signing a $368 billion deal to purchase nuclear submarines from the United States (the “worst deal in all history,” according to Keating), an agreement that Keating argued would antagonize China and bind Australia too closely to the U.S. Albanese’s extensive diplomatic travels in 2022–23 included trips to England for the memorial service for Elizabeth II and for the coronation of Charles III.\n\nHigh on Albanese’s agenda was the desire to conduct a national referendum on whether the constitution should be amended to formally recognize Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples as well as to create the “Voice to Parliament,” an Indigenous body to advise the government on policies that affect Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Like other supporters of the proposal, the prime minister hoped its adoption would be an important stride toward reconciliation between the Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islander peoples and the country’s non-Indigenous majority. Opponents of the proposal, mainly conservatives, argued that it was unnecessary and lacked sufficient details.\n\nHeld in October 2023, the first referendum put to Australian voters in more than two decades, it required assent from a majority of voters nationwide as well as majorities in at least four states to pass. In the event, some 60 percent of those who participated in the vote rejected the proposal, and it failed to gain majority support in all six states. The result was a stunning blow for the country’s Indigenous people and a major failure for Albanese, who reacted to the defeat by saying:\n\nThis moment of disagreement does not define us. And it will not divide us. We are not Yes voters or No voters. We are all Australians. And it is as Australians, together, that we must take our country beyond this debate without forgetting why we had it in the first place. Because too often in the life of our nation and in the political conversation, the disadvantage confronting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has been relegated to the margins. This referendum and my Government has put it right at the centre."
