        "text": "Lifting the lid on diabetes rates in Brisbane\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nWith diagnoses increasing at a higher rate than both heart disease and cancer, diabetes is Australia’s fastest growing chronic condition.\n\nToday, one in 20 Australians are living with type 2 diabetes, which accounts for 85% of all diabetes diagnoses.\n\nWhere type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, type 2 is developed over time and is often linked to ‘unhealthy’ lifestyles such as obesity, inactivity, and poor diet. Of all type 2 diagnoses, 60%of cases are considered preventable with simple lifestyle changes.\n\nDespite the condition’s preventability, we find ourselves in a ‘21st century epidemic’.\n\nWith reach throughout the state, Y Queensland have not only observed the impacts of diabetes in our immediate communities but have seen the benefits of engagement and healthy lifestyles on individuals through our services.\n\nWe know that there is work that can be done to create happy, healthy, and connected communities, and it starts on our doorstep in South East Queensland.\n\nLast month, we published a study on the need and desire for a type 2 diabetes prevention program in our South East Queensland communities. Teaming up with The University of Queensland (UQ) to conduct our research, we wanted to better understand the risk profiles of the people we engage with every day through our facilities, and their interest in diabetes prevention programs.\n\nCollecting community responses\n\nOur survey was delivered to our community through an anonymous survey. Using the Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool, our aim was to better understand a participant’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the next five years.\n\nThis tool uses responses to various demographic (e.g., age) and behaviour (e.g., physical activity) questions to develop a risk score, with the higher the score, the higher the risk.\n\nWe also asked participants if they would be interested in taking part in a diabetes prevention program. To help prioritise our offerings, we also asked their postcode, Y membership status, and their nearest Y branch. The survey was promoted for four weeks , and this is what we uncovered.\n\nThe results\n\nA total of 575 people took part in the survey. All participants in the study were currently engaged in our centres—with 20 locations taking part in the research.\n\nWe found:\n\n41% of respondents had a diabetes diagnosis within their immediate family and / or had a personal history of high glucose levels\n\n37% of respondents measured for one or more high risk factors in their lifestyle (ie, smoking, limited fruit and vegetable consumption, not meeting minimum weekly exercise requirements)\n\n38% of respondents were found to be at high-risk of developing type 2 diabetes within the next 5 years.\n\n48% of respondents had a waist measurement which fell into either the medium-risk or high-risk category.\n\nRespondents who reported living in relatively disadvantaged areas were more likely to score in the high-risk category for diabetes.\n\nFor our Group Manager for Fitness and Recreation, Michael Tsiamis, these results present an opportunity.\n\n“Y centres and gyms across the Greater South East Queensland region are embedded in community and have remained highly attended across all locations despite COVID-19, cost of living, or geographic distance,” he said.\n\n“We have a responsibility in our communities to not only address diabetes, but demonstrate that healthy, connected, and happy lifestyles are possible through our accessible fitness programs.”\n\nWhen asked their personal interest in a healthy lifestyle diabetes prevention program, 68% of respondents demonstrated an interest, with those who were more at risk sharing a comparatively higher level of interest.\n\nMichael said that interest and appetite is the first step for uptake, referencing the Y’s unique (and popular) fitness program for Cancer Survivors which responded to a niche need in community.\n\nOur learnings\n\nWith diabetes so deeply embedded in the Australian health landscape, it is time to act—and it starts in our community centres and gyms.\n\nOur research with UQ identified that there is both a need and a desire for diabetes prevention programs to be delivered in the community.\n\nFor the whole Y team, this research marks the start of a new journey under our continued efforts to empower our community through engaged, healthy, and happy outcomes.\n\nOur Y Queensland CEO, Damian Foley, sees further opportunity for us in research, planning, and development of diabetes prevention programs.\n\n“We’re looking forward to utilising our findings to empower our people so that our communities and their loved ones take control of their health outcomes through the support of Y centres and gyms across the state,” he said.\n\n“Our joint study with UQ has forged a valuable pathway to address what it confirmed as a widespread issue in Queensland, and we are committed to harnessing this momentum.”\n\nWhilst continuing to support our communities, we also look forward to helping ‘lift the lid’ on diabetes in South East Queensland, and integrating prevention measures into our services.\n\nWe are continuing our partnership with UQ to trial the Small Steps for Big Changes diabetes prevention program. This program will be trialled in four centres—Caloundra, Bowen Hills, Warwick, and Victoria Point.\n\nProfessor Genevieve Healy, who is the Australian lead of the trial and was senior author on the study, is enthusiastic about the opportunities and learnings the partnership can provide for communities in South East Queensland.\n\n“Our initial study showed that there was both a need and a desire for diabetes prevention programs like Small Steps for Big Changes in the Y community. We are excited about working in partnership with the Y to help understand how this brief diet and exercise program can be sustainably delivered, and the impacts of it on health and wellbeing,” she said.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\n7 Million Milestone for YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nThe YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program reached an incredible milestone this year, celebrating more than 7 million free breakfasts served since the program began in 2006.\n\nOne thing that has remained constant throughout the program’s 17-year history, however, is its dedication and mission to reducing the number of students disadvantaged by hunger and poor nutrition in schools across Southeast Queensland.\n\nYMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program Manager, Amanda Maystone-Towell, said her team is proud of the work they do together “to help over 13,500 children each week”.\n\nAmanda Maystone-Towell (YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program Manager) at the program's warehouse in Kingston.\n\n“Knowing children are attending school, starting classes with a full tummy ready to learn and be engaged with their school community is the most gratifying experience for us,” Amanda said.\n\n“We often stop to consider the impact of what we do and reflect on the value of the social impact to children, families and their futures the Y supports.”\n\nAmanda says research shows “regular and consistent access to healthy breakfast options makes children feel valued and sees them thrive”, with positive impacts on classroom behaviour and academic performance.\n\n“With a full tummy children can focus on their learning and work at hand… rather than feeling defeated when hunger is all that is consuming them,” Amanda said.\n\n“We also know that engaged education creates better positive outcomes for the children, linking this to further education and long-term employment prospects.”\n\nFeedback from school staff also highlights how the program enhances student engagement and school connectedness.\n\n“Relationships with teachers, faculty and their peers, as a whole school community can be stronger,” Amanda said.\n\nThe operation and logistics of the YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program is powered by a small, core team of three staff members, four casual delivery drivers and one tireless volunteer “who has been a support for our program since 2012,” Amanda said.\n\nWith the generous support of Foodbank Queensland, Clem Jones Group and Club Southside, as well as local sponsors and volunteers, YMCA is able to provide all equipment, food, supplies and delivery at no cost to participating schools.\n\n“We couldn’t do our work without the Donors and Sponsors who support our program,” Amanda said.\n\nWhile the YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program started with just five schools in Logan in 2006, the program now reaches 169 schools and stretches across South East Queensland.\n\n“We always aim to ‘never say no’ to a school,” Amanda said.\n\nTo learn more about the YMCA Schools' Breakfast Program, or to find out how you can volunteer or make a donation, visit ymcabrisbane.org/services/schools-breakfast-program.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nABC Interviews YMCA Social Impact Manager\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nYMCA Social Impact Manager, Gary Adsett, interviews with ABC Radio Brisbane on 24 December 2019.

This year’s theme, \"Keep the Fire Burning! Blak, Loud and Proud,\" highlights the enduring strength and vitality of Indigenous cultures, calling everyone to stand in solidarity and amplify the voices that have long been silenced.\n\nStories from Our Community\n\nAs part of the celebration, we asked some of our First Nations staff and volunteers for their insights:\n\nDebbie, a Waanyi woman and Community Engagement Administrator at The Buzz Community Centre, emphasises the importance of NAIDOC Week in maintaining and preserving culture. \"The theme to me means celebrating culture,\" she shares.\n\nIssy, a youth member from the Southern Downs in the Queensland Youth Parliament, sees the theme as a call for unity and pride. \"Be proud, be loud, and be yourself. Don't shy away from your heritage; it's yours, so own it,\" she advises younger generations.\n\nKait, a proud Bundjalung woman and youth member for Lockyer in the Queensland Youth Parliament, encourages embracing one's culture. \"No matter how much you know about your culture, just do what you can and be proud of it. Try to get involved,\" she says. Kait also shared how she helped organised NAIDOC Week celebrations at a school, educating young children about First Nations history and culture through fun activities.\n\nCelebrations Across Y Queensland Centres\n\nHere’s how some of our centers celebrated NAIDOC Week:\n\nMiami OSHC created a “community tree” artwork to symbolise connection, led by a First Nations educator.\n\nCheeky Monkeys Playgroup enjoyed activities like Rainbow Serpent Collages and Aboriginal Dot Painting.\n\nEdens Landing OSHC painted hands in the colors of the Aboriginal flag, forming a flame to reflect the theme. A Cultural Infusion program during Vacation Care helped deepen children’s understanding of Indigenous culture.\n\nThe Y Acacia Ridge Early Learning Centre emphasised learning about First Nations history, culture, and achievements. Educators and children built a visual fire out of sticks and handprints, learned songs like “Taba Naba” and “Inanay,” and explored Dreamtime stories and the significance of the flags. They also walked together inspired by the “Walking Together” episode on Play School.\n\nBrisbane South Junior engaged in various activities, including creating artwork, making polymer clay earrings, and cooking a ‘Bush Tucker’ feast with Indigenous chef Marnie Parker. With 34% of students identifying as First Nations, Brisbane South Junior is proud to support their awareness and connection to Indigenous culture.\n\nCommitting to Cultural Heritage\n\nNAIDOC Week is an opportunity for all Australians to learn about First Nations cultures and histories and to participate in celebrations of the oldest continuous living cultures on earth. Through our collective efforts, we can forge a future where the stories, traditions, and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are cherished and celebrated, enriching the fabric of our nation. At YMCA Queensland, we are committed to celebrating and learning about the rich traditions of Australia’s First Nations people, igniting a renewed commitment to acknowledging, preserving, and sharing this cultural heritage.\n\nJoin us in celebrating NAIDOC Week and honoring the unyielding spirit of our communities.

We know that this holistic approach to education is best delivered through a flexible individualised learning environment.\n\nThe proposed expansion of the vocational school will provide an opportunity for more young people to access a safe and adaptable learning environment in the Redlands.\n\nThe proposed facility will be built next to the current vocational school building. It will be a single storey building, which will include new flexible spaces to enable cross-functional use, and a screened recreation area.\n\nWidespread benefits\n\nThe proposed facility will also create more useable space for the community to access. Outside of school hours, both school buildings will be used to run community programs as well as being made available to the wider community for hire.\n\nThe youth hub operates a safe environment for young people, aged 12–25, to run activities and recreation events.\n\nThe proposed facility will:\n\ncreate more useable space for the community to access, where young people can connect through activated spaces and tailored programs\n\nprovide more social and educational infrastructure for the community\n\nprovide access to vocational education, and a journey to employment, for young people who would benefit from the facility.\n\nDelivering a new community asset\n\nTo provide these improved facilities for our young people, YMCA will request that the Deputy Premier and Minister for State Development, Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning designates our premises for the development of infrastructure for educational facilities through the Ministerial Infrastructure Designation (MID) process.\n\nThe MID process is an alternative assessment pathway to lodging a development application with local government. Instead of applying for approval from Redlands City Council, we will be applying to the Minister.\n\nA MID provides for the timely delivery of essential community infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and healthcare services.\n\nTo support the MID proposal a range of technical assessments are undertaken. These assessments help us to understand the possible impacts of the development and how these impacts would be addressed.\n\nAll the documents supporting a request for a MID are included in a single ‘environmental assessment report’. This report refers to both the built and natural environment of the area, and includes the findings of the technical assessments.\n\nYMCA is a registered charity and not-for-profit organisation. Applying for a MID provides an opportunity for us to save costs associated with Council’s development assessment process, which we can then reinvest into the facility and our students.\n\nWriting an environmental assessment report\n\nThe requirements for requesting a MID are set in the Planning Act 2016 and the Minister’s Rules and Guidelines v1.1 (which falls under the Planning Act).\n\nThe environment assessment report for this project will include:\n\na response to the criteria for requesting a MID, outlined under the Act\n\nan explanation of the proposed development\n\narchitect’s plans\n\npossible impacts from the development and how they would be addressed (e.g. traffic and environmental)\n\ndocuments to be distributed during the formal engagement period and any engagement activities which may be held.\n\nParking and access\n\nThe proposed project does not include any new vehicle access points. It will use the current access from Link Road.\n\nFollowing advice from our traffic planner, we will not be providing any new car parks as part of the proposal.\n\nPrivacy\n\nThe proposed facility is one storey, which means people in our building will not be able to look down into neighbouring properties.\n\nThe proposed facility has also been designed to keep a six metre setback from the rear boundary. The building’s immediate neighbours are the stormwater channel and Parklands Court Park. This setback next to the stormwater channel means that we will be about 55 metres from residences in Cassowary Circuit.\n\nThe YMCA appreciates the importance of the environment and the landscape to our neighbours and our students. As a result, the expansion has been designed to retain all trees on site and allow space for new trees in the future. This will also provide a natural buffer to the new building.\n\nHow to find out more about our plans for the future and the MID process\n\nPlease visit our Drop-in Session on Saturday 28 May 2022 between 1pm and 3pm at The LINK, 128 Link Road, Victoria Point to discuss our plans or the MID process with project team representatives.\n\nIf you have questions about our master plan, or any comments, you can also contact the project team at This email address is being protected from spambots.

I was consistently finding myself in trouble, breaking the law, I knew this was not me so I was focused to make better decisions.”\n\n“Then one day in custody I realised this isn’t me, this is not who I am, I need to make better decisions. I want to be better, I want to provide, I want a future.”\n\nA career supporting young people\n\nAfter studying to become a support worker, Josh has helped hundreds of young people through his work in detention centres and Youth Off the Streets, before moving into education.\n\nNow a Senior Youth Worker Lead at the Y, Josh identified a need to introduce programs that brought awareness of Indigenous culture to staff and students.\n\nJosh Fearn (centre) with Moreton Bay Senior Campus Youth Workers Morris Hodges (left) and Krystal Wighton (right).\n\nHis first initiative at the Y Vocational School Moreton Bay was connecting with local traditional owners and establishing a didgeridoo program aimed at helping students connect with their culture and feel confident to identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander within the school community.\n\n“All of a sudden we've gone from three or four kids saying that they identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander to having 15 kids in that one term,” Josh said.\n\n“We had so much interest we opened it up to non-Indigenous kids as well so we can support that reconciliation – making sure our Indigenous kids and non-Indigenous kids are working together, having a good understanding of different cultures.”\n\nAnother popular program Josh has co-created is the school’s Aboriginal Art Program. Facilitated by Uncle Goma Conlon, the program teaches young people about the meaning of Indigenous symbols in artwork and provides an opportunity for Indigenous students to create their own story using Aboriginal symbols.\n\n“Once they understand and start creating their own story and start painting, they don't want to go back to class because they're enjoying it so much,” Josh said.\n\nAnother highlight for Josh and the students was creating a cultural dance program, where Indigenous students learn a traditional dance over several weeks that they perform at the Year 12 Graduation Ceremony in front of a crowd of over 500 people.\n\n“I thought to myself what's the best way I can really support these young Indigenous and non-Indigenous kids and break that cycle of not being shamed and getting up there being proud of their culture,” Josh said.\n\n“We got them all sized up with all their outfits they have to wear. We've got them painted up then we went into town and we all got up there and danced and it was probably one of the highlights the organisations has ever seen.”\n\nJosh Fearn (left) with Moreton Bay Senior Campus Youth Worker Mathew Galo (right).\n\nMaking all Y Vocational Schools a culturally safe space\n\nJosh’s passion for integrating Indigenous culture into the Y Moreton Bay has seen every YMCA Vocational School site now adopt cultural programs, giving students more opportunities to thrive and find their identity though vocational schooling.\n\n“I say this to the kids all the time I wish I had one of these vocational schools growing up because it would have been right up my alley, I wasn't fit for mainstream.”\n\n“It's so important because it gives them opportunities like smaller classrooms, they get more support from the teachers, youth workers, counsellors, vet youth workers, so they're getting support so much more than what they'll get in a mainstream school.”\n\n“My next goal and focus is now is trying to implement having an Indigenous staff member at each site to support their Indigenous kids because I think it's so important.”\n\n“I've overcome so many barriers and that's what I want to encourage with these young people to do the same. Some of them are probably going through the same thing I went through and I said to them, you can overcome these stigmas, it’s about what you want to put into it.”\n\nJosh Fearn (left) with Moreton Bay Senior Campus Head of School Domenic Heidke (right).\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nMango Hill Community Centre Raffle Success\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nThis holiday season, our Mango Hill Community Centre put smiles on faces with their special Christmas Raffle.

Cooking was able to provide a path to connect and build relationships that have now carried beyond the kitchen and into our community.”\n\nThe dynamic cooking workshops, which were funded by the Queensland Government, were a celebration of global and local food that showcased the talents of Laetitia Chaumeron (French), Melanie Groves (German), Mili Misra (Indian), Tianni Hamilton (Torres Strait), Denise Fauth and Edith Budd (Malaysian) and Patricia Owen (Ecuadorian).\n\nTianni is a proud Torres Strait Islander for whom food evokes vivid memories of family, togetherness, celebration and the exchange of stories and knowledge.\n\nShe said she had found a second home at the Cannon Hill Y thanks to their Wellbeing Wednesday, which provides attendees with free food, access to laundry and social connection, and it was there she was asked to contribute to the Multicultural Cookbook.\n\n“Growing up with Indigenous culture, every week we had a curry. It’s a dish I associate with my family and one that I was excited to share with my community through this process,” Tianni said.\n\n“I was scrolling on social media one day and saw a post in our community page; the Y up the road was giving away free loaves of bread to the community. I figured I should go and check it out.\n\n“It was like coming home. Ever since the first time I visited the Cannon Hill Y, I felt like I has a social group. Every week now I block time in my work roster to make sure I can attend Wellbeing Wednesdays.”\n\nFree copies of the cookbook have been made available to centre regulars, as well as the option of a digital download that shares not only the recipes but the stories of the women and the dishes they have lovingly created.\n\nWhy not try one for yourself?\n\nLaetitia Chaumeron’s Ratatouille\n\nIngredients for eight people: Two eggplants, two capsicums, four zucchinis, six tomatoes, two onions, three garlic cloves, one bay leaf, a pinch of pepper, two sprigs of thyme, one tablespoon of tomato paste (optional) or crushed tomatoes, three tablespoons of white wine, a pinch of salt, two tablespoons of olive oil.\n\nSteps\n\nDice the vegetables.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a Dutch oven (such as a cast-iron cocotte or sauté pan).\n\nAdd the onion and eggplant.

Meet Elena – a Psychology and Public Policy Major, and a young person making a difference.\n\nElena first heard about YMCA when she became involved with the Youth Mentoring Program, and her positive experience as a youth mentor is one of the reasons she has stayed with the organisation today.\n\n“You could really see the positive impact it had on the young people we met. They became so engaged and eventually opened up about applying what they had learned in the program to their own lives, which was really rewarding.”\n\nAt YMCA we believe in giving young people a platform to have their say. We asked Elena for her thoughts on the most pressing issues facing young people today.\n\n“I think the most pressing issues facing young people today are climate change and a lack of political representation. Young people are generally written off as being disengaged or uninterested in politics, but I don’t think that’s the whole picture. Our political system is not very open to new ideas, so the diverse and passionate opinions of young people are ignored. [The issue of] climate change is fairly self-evident, and progress on addressing it is painfully slow.”\n\nOutside of her educator role, Elena is currently helping with research for a new Specialist OSHC evaluation framework.\n\n“I’m usually at OSHC in the mornings before school; supervising play, preparing their afternoon tea, hearing their views, and seeing their creativity. [As a research officer] the tasks of the day vary, but are always interesting. I do everything from data entry and analysis, to literature reviews, and assisting with focus groups.”\n\nElena’s immediate goal is to visit Europe, but hopes that her career leads her to doing social research or working with community organisations.\n\n“I really like the environment at YMCA. At each volunteering or working role, there’s always a very positive environment. I think the Vocational Schoolsare fantastic, as there’s a real need for more flexible educational services.”\n\nWe asked Elena to describe an idea for a new social impact program that she would like to see YMCA implement in the future.\n\n“All of the current social impact programsare amazing, but if I could choose I would probably create a program focusing on giving community support to young asylum seekers and refugees in the community. Giving support to people who are newly arrived is critical and gives a positive foundation to the new lives they are building. My parents survived a lot of conflict and trauma before coming to Australia as refugees. They worked and sacrificed a lot to provide a good life for my sister and me. I have never heard them complain or lose their compassion for others despite what they have been through.”\n\nWe asked Elena how the public can get involved to make a difference in their community.\n\n“The general public can get involved by keeping an inclusive mindset and listening to young people in their lives. Getting involved isn't limited to donating or volunteering YMCA is such a diverse and wide-ranging organisation with a great range of services, there's a way to get involved that will suit anyone.”\n\nWe're excited to see what amazing things Elena will achieve!\n\nIf you've found Elena's story inspiring, check out some of the ways that you can get involved in your community too!\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nWhere Young Musicians Network: Kelly Talks \"The Space\"\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nYou may recognise this face if you’ve ever visited our Youth Space and Vocational School, \"The Space\" North Lakes. Brisbane, meet Kelly. Kelly is a receptionist at The Space, with a keen interest in computers, everything tech, and playing and listening to music. He’s previously played with and supported some big bands, in front of big crowds, and is currently working on developing his own video game.\n\nWe asked Kelly what he loves about The Space.\n\n“While I’ve been involved in some really cool things here, my favourite events are the hard-core shows that we’ve run. There really isn’t a North Side all-ages venue for this music scene, which makes it difficult for young people and young bands to get experience, exposure, and share something they are passionate about to like-minded people. It’s also a great way for young musicians to network with other bands and build their audience, and assisting with their shows has been such a killer experience.”\n\nKelly describes a day in his life at YMCA as “sporadic, but in a good way.”\n\n“I think most people who work in reception or admin would agree – but it’s good, and some days are challenging. [My job] definitely keeps me on my toes. I work with some pretty amazing people, which makes my days great. I definitely don’t wake up not wanting to go to work.”\n\nKelly recently attended Inspired Leaders Camp at Camp Leslie Dam, where he learned about the importance of understanding intentions versus perceptions, as well as how broad the YMCA really is.\n\n“We have some wonderfully talented staff across the organisation and learning that it’s not just this way where I am, but what seems to be everywhere, was lovely to see.”\n\nWe agree, Kelly. We truly agree!\n\nBe sure to read more about The Space, where we encourage young people to socialise and be creative in a safe, structured or unstructured environment!\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Brisbane Wins National Social Impact Award\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nYMCA Brisbane is proud to announce it is the winner of the Excellence in Social Impact Measurement Award, for its Impact Measurement Methodology program, in the 2019 SIMNA Awards.\n\nThe SIMNA (Social Impact Measurement Network of Australia) Awards celebrate Australian organisations, social enterprises, businesses, and impact inventors that undertake or support social impact measurement.\n\nYMCA Brisbane facilitates 10 Social Impact programs to tens of thousands of people each week, with programs including: Independent School, Community Housing, Schools’ Breakfast Program, Social Enterprise, Vocational Education and Training and School-Based Mentoring programs.\n\nThe Excellence in Social Measurement Award is described as the ‘Gold Logie’ of social impact awards. In winning this award, YMCA Brisbane is recognised for the design and implementation of its highly-effective ‘Impact Measurement Methodology’ program. Central to the Impact Measurement program is the development of Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) frameworks to evaluate the organisation’s Social Impact programs.\n\nGary Adsett, Group Manager YMCA Social Impact, said, “I am incredibly honoured that YMCA Brisbane has been recognised for building a culture that values social impact and outcomes measurement. We believe that if it’s worth doing, it’s worth measuring. Our Impact Measurement program provides tangible evaluation results to inform our decision-making processes and meet the needs of our beneficiaries. We will continue to develop and apply measurements to maximise the social impact that we make.”\n\nSimon Faivel, SIMNA Chair and Director of SVA Consulting said: “The SIMNA Awards are a national celebration of those growing and shaping the practice of social impact measurement in Australia. New community-based approaches that build resilience across generations are a broader investment across Queensland’s youth and young people. The standard of excellence demonstrated by YMCA Brisbane's Impact Measurement Methodology is to be commended.”\n\nThe judging panel took into consideration that YMCA Brisbane is a long-established and trusted name in community service delivery. It unanimously concurred that its application expressed the best practice and embodiment of the Principles of Social Value.\n\nJudging panellist, Dr Emma Lee, commented: “The YMCA has a long and trusted name in youth and young peoples’ service delivery. Their achievements are singular in the levels of impact across families and communities – whole societies are benefiting and being uplifted to demonstrate real social and cultural value within socio-economic outcomes built from the ground-up. This field of social impact demonstrates Australian innovation at its best.”\n\nYMCA Brisbane began measuring impact approximately six years ago. The organisation continues to use the information generated from impact measurement for planning and decision-making purposes in a transparent and accountable way.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Campaign Aims to Get Every Child Swimming In Safety\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nOn 1st November 2012, a new national TV campaign from the YMCA, in partnership with the SBS Foundation, called for all Australians to learn to swim as annual drowning rates continue at alarming levels.\n\nThe 30-second campaign launched on SBS in an attempt to raise awareness about the importance of learning to swim to save lives among our nation’s most “at risk” communities, namely our Indigenous population and new migrants, many of whom have not grown up around open water. These communities are also more likely to be faced with financial and geographic barriers to learning to swim, barriers that need to be broken, according to the YMCA.\n\nThe YMCA’s plea – that it’s never too early or too late to learn, swimming is a skill for all ages, genders and ethnicities – echoes that of Royal Life Saving Society Australia which is currently calling for swimming lessons to be compulsory for all school children. However, the YMCA believes the need for swimming lessons extends a lot further than among children, with 205 of the 284 drowning deaths in Australia in the year to June 2012 aged 25 and over.\n\nWhat’s more, Indigenous Australians are over three times more likely to drown than other Australians.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Creates Course To Beat The Rat Race\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nOne of Brisbane’s oldest organisations, the YMCA, has come to the rescue of the River City, creating a solution to defeat the dreaded rat race by turning the iconic Brisbane River, Botanical Gardens and Goodwill Bridge into a fun obstacle course pitting participants against a range of challenging (but very achievable) obstacles.\n\nThe YMCA Rat Race gives busy Brisbaneites the perfect chance to escape the daily grind and join their friends and colleagues in a fun and friendly team event supporting the YMCA and their YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program.\n\nYMCA Brisbane Marketing and Fundraising Manager Jane Barr-Thomson said the Rat Race offers a great opportunity for people across South East Queensland to take part in a fun event and support a program designed for people of varying fitness levels.\n\n“The Rat Race is a perfect opportunity for people across South East Queensland to get together with their friends and family for a fun and friendly team event supporting a much needed program,” Ms Barr-Thomson said.\n\nThe Rat Race supports the YMCA School’s Breakfast Program, which was designed to help improve disadvantaged Queensland student’s academic, community and behavioural outcomes.\n\nMs Barr-Thomson said the YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program is an important service feeding students disadvantaged by hunger and poor nutrition before they start school for the day.\n\n“We all know breakfast is the most important meal of the day and over the past 10 years, the Schools’ Breakfast Program has served more than three million breakfasts to students across Queensland,” Ms Barr-Thomson said.\n\nThe YMCA Brisbane is one of Brisbane’s oldest organisations offering the community a range of services and youth programs to more than 10,000 members every week.\n\nRegistrations for teams to participate in the YMCA Rat Race are open now with the Family and Team Events taking place Sunday 15 October 2017.\n\nPeople can register their team to compete in either the 8km team event or the family friendly 4km family event. Both courses start and finish in Captain Burke Park under the iconic Story Bridge.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Mobilises Millions to Break Basketball World Record\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nMillions of people were mobilised on Saturday 13th October, for the YMCA World Challenge 2012 Hoop Springs Eternal - a coordinated celebration of the YMCA and the work it does to build strong communities and empower young people.\n\nYMCA events took place in thousands of local communities across five continents and included a global basketball shoot-out.

We get new students who have previously experienced significant barriers in coming to school and studying, who after spending several weeks at the Y, say they’ve found a place they can call home.”\n\nStudents enrolled will have the opportunity to select a vocational pathway to follow, with options like hairdressing, automotive, hospitality, engineering and more.\n\nCurrently, 60 students are enrolled at the YMCA Vocational School Redlands Campus.\n\n“There’s a real need in the Redlands to offer young people new avenues to gain employment after school, and a learning environment with increased support. The facility also has an onsite community centre, creating venue hire spaces and offering events everyone in the Redlands can enjoy outside of school hours.”\n\nOver $5 million has been invested into building the Vocational School, with the State Government pledging $2.5 million of funding to see the education resource delivered to the Redlands community.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Schools' Breakfast Program is Breaking News\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nThe School Breakfast Program made its ‘1.8 million breakfasts’ milestone and has attracted media attention. On May 27, the ABC New Team attended the YMCA Vocational School Campus to interview the YMCA and Foodbank about the positive influences the School Breakfast Program is having on young lives.\n\nThe program gives students the opportunity to achieve their very best, by providing them with much needed sustenance to start their School day. Research suggests that breakfast is important for students as it helps to boost energy levels and improves concentration at School.\n\nAlso, Volunteers, School partnerships and business supporters all play a vital role in the success of the program. Tip Tip and Foodbank generously donated specially designed YMCA aprons to the volunteers who serve breakfast to students. There has also been an increase in volunteers since the program was initiated, who donate their time with the goal of helping others. The School Breakfast Program has received great and well deserved publicity and YMCA are proud of everyone who is involved.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program Launches New Networking Initiative\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nThe YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program team has launched a new networking initiative to support staff, volunteers and school communities providing free, healthy breakfasts to students across Queensland.\n\nThe Program’s first networking event was held on Thursday 6 October at Bremer State High School and brought together a passionate group of supporters, from teaching and administrative staff to not-for-profit and local government representatives.\n\nIpswich Mayor Teresa Harding was also in attendance and spoke of the inspiring impact the Breakfast Program was having on 38 school communities in the region.\n\nThe YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program currently supports more than 140 schools and provides 100,000 free breakfast meals to Queensland students each month, many of whom attend school without eating a substantial meal — if any food at all — before leaving home in the morning.\n\nWhile the Program’s mission is to reduce the number of students disadvantaged by hunger and poor nutrition, YMCA CEO Damian Foley recently highlighted the additional benefits of children attending school with a full tummy.\n\n“Our research tells us that 96% of schools see demonstrable positive impacts on educational outcomes after implementing our breakfast program, including increases in school connectedness, student focus and participation, and improved behavioural outcomes,” Mr Foley said.\n\nProgram Manager Amanda Maystone-Towell and her dedicated team plan to hold quarterly networking events to connect with participating schools and communities, support their staff and volunteers, share information and ideas, and celebrate local achievements.\n\nMs Maystone-Towell also explained that the events will aim to reduce the stigma of food insecurity, ensuring the Schools’ Breakfast Program is “part of the daily conversation with children, youth and families and a positive place to start their day”.\n\nPlans are already underway for the next quarterly events to be held in Logan, followed by the Brisbane region.\n\nTo learn more about the YMCA Schools’ Breakfast Program, to register your school or to donate, please click here.\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nReturn to YMCA News\n\nLatest Articles\n\nYMCA Springfield Lakes Christmas Appeal 2023\n\nAuthor\n\nPublished\n\nCategory\n\nShare\n\nIn the spirit of giving, the YMCA Springfield Lakes Christmas Appeal has once again united the local community to spread joy and support to those in need.
