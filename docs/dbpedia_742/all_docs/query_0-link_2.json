        "text": "Formidable Truth - stori blong Ms. Shireen Malamoo\n\nThis Australian South Sea Islander recognition day tribute goes to Aunty Shireen Malamoo as 2021 marks her 85th born day. A force to be reconned with Aunty Shireen remains a proactive founding board member and honorary patron of Sydney based Australian South Sea Islanders - Port Jackson (ASSIPJ).\n\nASSIPJ was inspired through the continuum of national work by ASSI organisations such as TGCASSICA.\n\nThe rebirth of a Pyrmont, Sydney NSW based ASSI representative gave platform to a collective of families from northern rivers and Queensland that have spent their working careers south of the border. ASSIPJ started as a working group with the support of the City of Sydney Council Deputy Lord Mayor Ms. Marcelle Hoff in 2009 followed by official company registration in 2010.\n\nAunty Shireen Malamoo identifies herself as Aboriginal / Kanak woman who has made great strides in educating Australia on a shared history. A proud mother of five Aunty Shireen spent four decades in Sydney throughout her career living in Redfern on Pitt Street NSW. The above image hung in 2012 as part of the permanent Indigenous Sydney Elders portrait exhibition at the Australian Museum by photographer Mervyn Bishop.\n\nAunty is the grandaughter of a Sugar Slave Blackbirded from the island of Tongoa in Vanuatu with a direct descendant from chief Tom Tiplomata. Many ASSIs are also of dual and tricultural First Nations heritage which sees Aunty Shireen as an Aboriginal traditional owner from the Birrigubba, Juru clan on Plantation Creek of the Burdekin in Ayr far north Queensland.\n\nDuring the 1860s Blackbirding islands inclusive of Tongoa saw entire male populations stolen, communities devastated with kastomary systems, and cultural practice freedoms were tormented. To add to the generational trauma of this heinous act some forty years later under bipartisan government support and union push came the mass deportation of some 7,000 people and their families under the ‘1901 White Australia’ policy. These policies shaped Aunty Shireen’s view on her life’s path in witnessing the suffering of her people under the oppressive Queensland regime, growing up on a town camp, really shaped her illustrious fifty year career of unwavering advocacy in social justice for Indigenous and ASSI communities. Aunty Shireen’s measured and determined focus has always been the simplistic act of ‘Truth telling’ and ‘Growing up’, this terminology is today reflected in the political narrative, embraced by many eminent politicians and activists.\n\nIn recognising Aunty Shireen’s body of social justice work we share some of the highlight of her career that bought about political change and in many cases better outcome for her peoples.\n\nFrom 1996 – 2017 NSW Justice Health & Forensic Mental Health Network, Aboriginal Health Medical Research Council (AHMRC). Roberta Sykes Indigenous Education Foundation.\n\n2010 Represented Aboriginal Australia in Rome in 2011 at the recent beatification of Mary Mc Killop. 1991 to 1993 as one of the first Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).\n\n1999 Citizen Award presented by Minister Andrew Refshauge from South Sydney Council for saving Douglas Street park from developers.\n\n1974 saw Aunty Shireen’s political activism enhanced when she spent time in Papua New Guinea (PNG) doing a 12 month community development course it was there she met and worked with PNG’s first Prime Minister Michael Somare.\n\nIn the 1970s work for the Department of Social Security in Townsville, Queensland. The Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care included membership of the Finance Committee and the establishment of the Goodo Day Care Centre on Palm Island.\n\nThe world celebrates many of those first Indigenous filmmakers with the likes of Rachel Perkins, Warwick Thornton and Erica Glynn.\n\nAs a representative to the City of Sydney Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island advisory panel in 2011 Aunty Shireen’s work was insistent on the inclusion of the word ‘Invasion’ to accurately describe the 1788 arrival of the first fleet in the 2030 city plan preamble, the council included the term, which caused a split among councilors who believed it was ''divisive''. Aunty Shireen received threats as a result however she was not perturbed.\n\nSimultaneously the ASSI social justice issues were put back on the public agenda with elder members as part of a working group that were excited to support the revival of the ASSI call for political change in policy and legislation. Aunty Carriette Pangas (nee Togo) designed the ASSIPJ logo, Aunty Nellie Enares, Dr Bonita Mabo, Uncle Graham Mooney, Aunty Avis Deguarra, Victor Corowa and Aunty Shireen Malamoo. The elders called on community and their political cohorts on the road once again to recognition for a forgotten people. The next generation founders are still todays directors chairwoman (Waskam) Emelda Davis, Mr. Shola Diop and Binette Diop.\n\nIn 2020 ASSIPJ marked 10 years since its formation under Aunty Shireen’s and the elders honorary patronage and political leadership defying odds and pushing the political agenda on not only a local but national and global scale.\n\nAunty Shireen Malamoo featured as part of the 'Footprints' documentary as an important education resource for the 25th Anniversary since Commonwealth recognition. This resource was complimented with the ASSIPJ compilation of an academic reference guide namely Hardwork. This term was used by the South Sea Islander forebears around the dinner table when drinking tea one would say ‘pass the hardwork’ referred to the sugar.\n\nThe arts pave a foundation of resilience for Aunty Shireen as a self-proclaimed artist her personal works were exhibited in the 2009 Pondering the Spiritual, Washhouse Gallery. In 2011 she exhibited in Woora Moorditj Yorgas (Wild Deadly Women), Agathon Galleries - Sydney. Her works are held in collections across Australia and more recently acquired in 2020 (2019 works Black People of Elegant Grace, A Choir to Heal) by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to gift the Vanuatu Halls of Justice Museum.\n\nOur first celebrated jazz artist having Aunty Shireen performed with her band The Pacific Main Stream jazz band, internationally acclaimed Johnny Nicol and the New York Jazz Qt Mimi Jones – Camille Thurman.\n\nAunty Shireen’s national and global reach sees her portrait hang in the Australian Museum, Old Parliament House and she has been the subject of three Archibald prize nominations (2016,2017,2018).\n\nAs an Aboriginal/Kanak artist Aunty Shireen’s work is influenced by her determination and deep interest in Black affairs from a world scale perspective.\n\nAwards include:\n\n2019: Blackmores Mercie Whellan Women’s + Wellbeing – Life time achievement Award.\n\n2016: NSW Council for Pacific Communities ‘Overall Outstanding’ and ‘Education’ Award."
