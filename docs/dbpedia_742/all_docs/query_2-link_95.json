        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, « Tuesday. -\n\n.Jack Dempsey; thc heavywciglit\n\nchampion of the world, ; Bas been\n\nfound \"not guilty\" on the charge of\n\nhaving attempted to evade the Ameri\n\n. can military draft during the war.\n\nMrs. Maxine Dempsey, former wife\n\nof Jack Dempsey, thc champion\n\nheavyweight, boxer, is an csemplifica\n\n, tion \"of the familiar truth that \"hell\n\nhas no fury like a..woman scorned.\"\n\nIn . a fit of jealousy she informed\n\n(he. authorities that Dempsey was lia\n\nble to, but. had evaded, military ser\n\nvice during the-.war,, and has been in\n\nSan Franoigeo.-3g,''testify for the Go\n\nvcrnme'nt\"\"'pràs«Mit.ion ef her former\n\nhusband and his manager, Jack\n\nKearns, on the charge\n\nThis is Mrs. Dempsey's story: -\n\n\"Those who criticise me for telling\n\nthe truth about Jack should picture\n\nme negelected in a small mining town\n\nwhile he was getting plenty of money\n\nand fame. I helped him when he was\n\nan unknown lighter. Then when he\n\nknew about \"Whip'Willard lie divorced\n\nme. . Did I get any motor cars or\n\npretty clothes as a..resnlt? No. All\n\nI got was neglect. And not' even\n\nwhen the American Legion beean to\n\ninvestigate Jack's enlistment did 1 say\n\nanything until one nay after he was\n\nafraid I would' testifv against him, I\n\nreceived a photograph. I was mad.\n\nAnd I wrote a letter to a newspaper\n\nsaying that Jack was a slacker. That\n\nstarted things. '\n\nIt is apparent from Mrs. Dempsey's\n\nstory that theM'fe cf herself and her\n\nhusband was riot nil milk and honey.\n\nShe tells how tho champion for days\n\nbefore a fight becrme quarrelsome,\n\nmorose, and sullen. Then she relates\n\nwith evident relish how on one occa\n\nsion she had hit him. \"It was after\n\nhis ficht with \"Willie Meehan, and he\n\nbad one eye cut oneu. Wc ouarrellrd.\n\nI struck at the bad eve. missed it.\n\nbnt hit the other.\"\n\nMrs. Dempsey says that Kearns it\n\ntho only man who can handle the\n\nchampion. She adds that if Carpen\n\nter hopes lo defeat him he must d\"\n\nso in the fourth or Pf th round. \"Jack\n\nis very strong at first but he has a\n\nbad back which begins to weaken at\n\nthe fourth round. Then they get him\n\nfilled with strychnine, and if ho gets\n\npast the fifth he is a hard man to\n\nbeat.\"\n\nMrs. Dempsey said that she had Ker\n\nown recollections of her husband's\n\nfight with \"Fireman Jim\" Flynn in\n\nNevada, in February, 1917, when\n\nFlynn.was credited with knocking him\n\nout, although spectators at the time\n\ndeclared that Dempsey \"lay down.\"\n\n\"For days before that fight,\" she\n\nsaid, \"Jack practised dropping after\n\na right swing on the jaw. He told\n\nme after the fm ht that when Flynn\n\nhit him it was so ficht that ho nearly\n\nforgot to lie down!\"\n\nTho defence in the trial tried to\n\nshake the testimony 'of bis former\n\nwife, that she onjjr rr-cefrKTiXIO dollars\n\n(£180) from the time that Dempsey\n\nanswered the questionnire in Janu\n\nary, 1918. to December 1 in the same\n\nyear. The evidence of telegraph op\n\nerators showed that Dempsey sent his\n\nwife several stuns, and she is said to\n\nhave remarked on one occasion that\n\n\"Fred Fulton must have hit Jack a*\n\nhe jarred 200 dollars loose from him.\"\n\nThe jiidge excluded evidence relat\n\ning to the period of the Dempseys'"
