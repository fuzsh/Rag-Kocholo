        "text": "Regional City\n\nVery Safe LNP 18.2%\n\nMP\n\nJack Dempsey (LNP) since gaining this seat at the 2006 election. Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services.\n\nProfile\n\nCovering the built up area of the city of Bundaberg, the electorate of Bundaberg is completely surrounded by the electorate of Burnett. Covers 65 square kilometres. (Map)\n\nBackground\n\nBundaberg had one of the longest Labor histories of any electorate in Queensland until being won by current MP Jack Dempsey at the 2006 election. It was first won by the Labor Party in 1896 and stayed in official Labor hands until 1957. At the 1957 election, sitting Labor MP and State Treasurer Ted Walsh defected to the QLP (later DLP) with the rest of his Cabinet colleagues after being expelled from the Labor Party in the great 1957 split. Walsh was to retain Bundaberg until 1969 when it reverted to being an official Labor Party seat.\n\nBundaberg was held by Labor's Clem Campbell from 1983 until retiring in 1998 when he was succeeded by Nita Cunningham, who managed to narrowly withstand a surge in One Nation support at that year's election. Cunningham increased her majority in 2001, but there was a 9.6% swing to the National Party in 2004. Bundaberg was then rocked by the revelations of poor medical treatment by an overseas doctor at Bundaberg Hospital. Cunningham retired through ill-health in 2006, a trigger used by Peter Beattie to hold an early election.\n\nThere was a 6.3% swing to the National Party's Jack Demspey in 2006, winning the seat at his second attempt and becoming the first National MP for Bundaberg. Dempsey added another 5% to his margin at the 2009 election at the LNP's first election, and boosted his margin to 18.2% at the 2012 election after a swing of 12.2%..\n\nPast Election Results\n\nYear Winning Party 1950 ALP 1953 ALP 1956 ALP 1957 QLP 1960 QLP 1963 IND 1966 IND 1969 ALP 1972 ALP 1974 ALP 1977 ALP 1980 ALP 1983 ALP 1986 ALP 1989 ALP 1992 ALP 1995 ALP 1998 ALP 2001 ALP 2004 ALP 2006 NAT 2009 LNP 2012 LNP\n\nColoured tab indicates seat won by a party forming government\n\n2015 Ballot Paper (5 Candidates) Party The Greens LNP Palmer United Party Australian Labor Party"
