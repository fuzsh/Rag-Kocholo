        "text": "FARGO — It must have gone through the minds of many in Fargo-Moorhead that July 4, 1923.\n\nWhat better way to celebrate America, they thought, than to cheer on a Minnesota guy — an underdog —hoping to take down a world champion? (They would eventually also surprise him in the middle of the night in his pajamas. More on that later.)\n\nSome called it the \"fight of the summer\" that Independence Day 100 years ago, as Minnesota boxer Tommy Gibbons challenged the heavyweight champion of the world, Jack Dempsey.\n\nWith the fight happening 800 miles away in Shelby, Montana most people in town couldn’t afford the trip. And with only 1% of American households in possession of a radio, most here also couldn’t listen to the play-by-play at home.\n\nSo what’s a local boxing fan supposed to do?\n\nAbout 3,000 of them headed to downtown Fargo and gathered around The Forum newspaper building to listen to a “megaphone man” shout out the blow-by-blow, round-by-round action from an office window.\n\nAccording to newspaper reports the crowd filled the block between the Masonic Temple, The Forum and Northwestern Bell. According to a map provided by Mark Peihl of the Clay County Historical Society, that’s basically the area of First Avenue between Fourth and Fifth Streets North between what is now Gate City Bank and the Fargo Public Library.\n\nCars at first filled First Avenue in front of the window of The Forum offices where the report was being megaphoned. But drivers were asked to move their cars to make room for the people standing and listening.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, it was the biggest crowd that ever attended a newspaper party in Fargo and was double the size of any crowd that ever attended a Forum election party to listen to election returns as they came in.\n\nLet’s put it this way, Jack Dempsey was a huge star, the World Heavyweight Boxing Champion from 1919 to 1926. More popular, some said, than Babe Ruth. Consider his biography from encyclopedia.com.\n\n“William 'Jack' Harrison Dempsey ushered in the age of big-time sports. His rise from hobo to heavyweight champion to Hollywood celebrity not only gave boxing the stamp of legitimacy but became the prototype for every superstar athlete that followed.”\n\nSo when Minnesota boxer Tommy Gibbons got the chance to challenge Dempsey for his title, you can bet his fellow upper Midwesterners would be rooting for him to win.\n\nTommy Gibbons was born into a boxing family in St. Paul in 1891. In his biography in the International Boxing Hall of Fame, Gibbons was said to have learned to box at the YMCA when he was just a kid. He followed his older brother Mike into the ring.\n\nTommy Gibbons turned pro when he was 20, fighting first as a welterweight and later becoming a middleweight and heavyweight. At the age of 33, he was considered a little past his prime to take on Dempsey. However, he had made enough of a name for himself and packed a powerful enough punch to earn his shot.\n\nThe fight took place in tiny Shelby, a northwestern Montana town with a population of around 500. Seems like an odd place to have a fight, but city leaders had a plan.\n\nJust the year before, oil had been discovered in Shelby. The town already had train service so leaders figured if they could host a major sporting event, they could attract new businesses and tourists to town. They could use the new oil revenue to help build a huge boxing venue and offset other costs of the match, including paying the boxers.\n\nThe boxing ring was built on top of a farm field and Shelby was ready to host the match. All the while, people lining the streets of downtown Fargo were ready to listen.\n\nGibbons went into the fight confident, but a definite underdog. He was older and smaller than the champ. Some analysts predicted he wouldn’t last the entire fight.\n\nGoing into the fight, J.A. Purcell, the “Sporting Editor” of The Forum said Gibbons' ability to dodge Dempsey’s blows might be his best strategy. Purcell contended that punching at an empty space rather than landing a hard punch is harder on a fighter’s endurance. The key would be to tire Dempsey out rather than match him punch by punch.\n\nPurcell said, “The St. Paul man is not nearly as rugged as the champion and for him to attempt to put up a give-and-take fight would be the height of foolishness.”\n\nWhen the fight started both men seemed to have their own strategy. Dempsey threw punches to Gibbons' head and Gibbons attacked Dempsey's body.\n\nGibbons was able to duck from many of Dempsey's shots, probably making it easier for him to stay in the fight. Dempsey's mobility, however, made it hard for Gibbons to punch Dempsey's stomach and ribs.\n\nThe crowd lining the street in Fargo hung on every word from the \"megaphone man\" and cheered Tommy with every punch. The match lasted the full 15 rounds with Dempsey winning by decision and retaining his title.\n\nWhat happened after the fight, in both Shelby and Fargo, would keep things interesting.\n\nWith the fight now over, film crews from all around the country had to hop on planes to get the film back to their respective audiences. That wouldn't be easy. The planes battled a fierce electrical storm in eastern Montana that caused the white-knuckled sports writers and photographers to say a few Hail Marys. Many of the planes heading to markets on the east coast made pit stops in Fargo, making the airport here extra busy for a Wednesday night.\n\nFor readers in Fargo, Thursday morning's paper brought written news and photos from the fight they only heard via megaphone the day before.\n\nThe Forum seemed exceedingly proud of their timely coverage. Two photos of the fight ran on the front page “just 21 hours” after the conclusion of the fight.\n\nBut more excitement was to come.\n\nThe Forum also announced that Tommy Gibbons would be rolling through town on his train back to St. Paul. A crowd of 2,000 people showed up at 1:00 a.m. on July 7th at the Northern Pacific Depot in Fargo.\n\nThey apparently wanted to show their appreciation to the man The Forum said “had earned a spot in the hearts of American fans” by staying the full 15 rounds and ruining Dempsey’s knockout record.\n\nGiven the late hour, Gibbons was in his pajamas, asleep in his stateroom, when the train pulled into Fargo and toward the crowd he didn’t even know had gathered. He was “agreeably surprised when awakened from his slumbers” by the shouting and thunderous cheers of his admirers.\n\n“The likable boxer donned a bathrobe to greet his friends,” The Forum wrote. Gibbons thanked them for their moral support and spoke at length. The train reportedly started pulling out of the station while Gibbons was still addressing the crowd.\n\nDespite the popularity of the fight in places like Fargo, it was a bust for the city that hosted it. Ticket sales were disappointing. Many in Shelby and nearby communities couldn’t afford to buy tickets. Attendance was estimated between 8,000 and 12,000 in an arena said to hold 40,000. Only some of the attendees actually bought tickets, despite Shelby organizers offering a last-minute discount.\n\nMany people, in fact, were able to watch it without paying a penny. Ticket takers and sellers were reported to have left their posts when the match began, so they could go inside and watch it themselves. With their posts now unguarded, the line of people who might have purchased the discounted last-minute tickets just went inside without paying.\n\nBecause Shelby had guaranteed payment to the fighters, it was a financial disaster. Reports differ on exactly how many banks in Shelby failed as a result of the fight, but it appears to be at least two and as many as four.\n\nJack Dempsey and his manager Jack Kearns walked away with around $300,000 (about $5.2 million in 2023 dollars).\n\nIn 1989, the L.A. Times called Kearns “one of the great sports conmen of the century.\" He was accused of taking advantage of the naivete of Shelby and in fact, he frequently joked later in life about “the banks Jack and I broke in Montana.”\n\nBecause Gibbons was the challenger and eager to take on Dempsey, his deal was much less lucrative. He agreed to get paid beyond expenses only if there were money left over after Dempsey’s cut. Of course, there wasn’t. So he walked away with nothing except the $2,500 to cover his expenses.\n\nJack Dempsey kept fighting but lost his title to another underdog in 1926, Gene Tunney. He continued to do exhibition matches and a rematch with Tunney but stopped fighting for good to become a philanthropist and actor in the 1930s. He made a comeback in the 1940s, served in the military in WWII, and became a restaurateur and author. He died in 1983 at the age of 87. His boxing record was 69-6-9.\n\nGibbons would retire from boxing in 1925 after getting knocked out by Dempsey’s nemesis, Tunney. His record was an impressive 55-4-1. He once said he left boxing, “while I still had my senses.”\n\nAccording to the Minneapolis Star, Gibbons was well-liked, generous, and “tremendously popular.”\n\nGibbons was elected Ramsey County Sheriff and served for 24 years before retiring in 1959. He also enjoyed spending time at his lake home in Osakis, Minn. He died in 1960 at the age of 69.\n\nThe town at the heart of the financial disaster, Shelby, got back up after its knockout. The town now has a population of around 3,100 and embraces that chapter in its history. In fact, organizers are holding a centennial event on July 4 at the site of the fight.\n\nPeople of Fargo-Moorhead, of course, you're welcome to stand on the sidewalk outside The Forum in hopes that you can hear the news from the Shelby event that day, but so far we haven't been able to hire a \"megaphone man.\" So you best just go online."
