        "text": "April 19, 1926, the El Paso Times reported that between 7,000 and 8,000 spectators had watched Jack Dempsey, heavyweight champion of the world, \"toy with three sparring partners for seven rounds and outbox Farmer Lodge for four rounds\" during the opening of the Juarez Coliseum.\n\nThe exhibition bouts were April 18. Dempsey spent April 17 in El Paso:\n\nGreeted and cheered by young and old El Paso, on his arrival here yesterday, Jack Dempsey, world's champion heavyweight, spent a busy day winding up with a visit to the Country Club last night.\n\nBetween shaking hands, refusing cigars and drinks, and changing clothes, Dempsey was kept on the jump from the time he alighted from the train at the Union Depot, coming directly to the Times-Herald office, where he wrote a story and assisted in making up The Herald sport pages.\n\n\"Don't — if you would be a champion — smoke cigarettes or drink liquor,\" Dempsey advised El Paso newsboys in a talk given before a mob of youngsters and grownups at Hotel Paso del Norte.\n\n\"A clean body and mind is the first thing to be considered in any championship material. Remember first to be good boys and keep your health and strength while you work or play. If you do this you are made of championship material,\" Dempsey advised his young admirers, whose faces glowed with pleasure as the champion gripped each small hand in his own powerful right \"mitt.\"\n\nFeels responsibility\n\n\"I never used to think much about drinking,\" said Dempsey afterward, \"But when I got the championship and began to realize how small boys were regarding me, it gave me a sense of responsibility that I never dreamed of having. That's the real reason why I don't drink or smoke. If I have to set an example, I'm going to set a good one.\"\n\nDuring his two-mile training joust yesterday morning, Dempsey called on his friend Harvey Wilcox at the Lone Star Motor Car company offices. A crowd of big-eyed youngsters kept him company.\n\nFollowing his talk to the newsboys, he drove around the city, going to Juarez at noon, where he and members of his party were guests of S.G. Gonzales at luncheon. Included in the party with the champion were Floyd Fitzsimmons, Michigan City prize fight promoter; Mr. Grant, Dempsey's legal adviser; Jerry Landeau, trainer; Gus Wilson; Curley Morgan; County Clerk W.D. Greet; John McIntosh; and Detective Sgt. Charles Matthews.\n\nAfter luncheon, Dempsey was the center of attraction at the Popular Dry Goods company store, where he again greeted young El Paso with handshakes, cheery smiles and championship advice.\n\nGoes to races\n\nFollowing the reception at the Popular, the champion was a guest of honor at the Juarez race meet opening. Along with Gen. E.B. Jackson and Mayor Almeida, Dempsey was honorary judge of the revival handicap, feature event of the racing card.\n\nAfter the races, Dempsey returned to his hotel in El Paso, dressed for dinner and was again the guest of Mr. Gonzales for dinner.\n\nImmediately after dinner, he motored around the city with friends and was the guest for a short time of El Pasoans at the Country Club, leaving early and retiring for the night at 10:15 p.m.\n\nHis schedule for today included a five-mile walk early this morning, followed by a shower and rub down by his trainer and the paying of several social calls on El Paso friends.\n\nThousands of fans\n\nThousands of fight fans from all sections of the southwest are making El Paso and Juarez their Mecca today to see Jack Dempsey, heavyweight champion of the world, step ten rounds with Farmer Lodge, the St. Paul heavyweight, and two of his partners and Marty Cutler, who trains with Lodge.\n\nThe fight marks the opening of the new Juarez Coliseum, a fight stadium that seats 12,000 people.\n\nDempsey will enter the ring about 5 o'clock this afternoon while the first bout on the program gets underway promptly at 4. The champ will be escorted by the same entourage that has accompanied him on all of his recent trips.\n\nLodge In good shape\n\nFarmer Lodge, his husky opponent, is in the best condition of his career, according to his manger, Lloyd Stannard.\n\n\"The big boy's eye is entirely healed up and I am sending him in there to give everything he's got,\" Stannard said last night. \"He is familiar with the champion's style and I am confident that he will be there at the finish. Lodge has been promised a fight in the Coliseum on May 30 if he makes an impressive showing against Dempsey.\n\n\"Lodge trained with Dempsey formerly and established the record of being the only sparring partner that the champ never knocked out. Lodge also went 15 rounds with Firpo in Buenes Aires without being knocked off his pins.\n\n\"The St. Paul boy's problem is condition, and I am satisfied that he is right on this score. Hard work will get Lodge up among the real contenders. I regard this Dempsey tour as the first step toward a hard campaign.\"\n\nDempsey's opinion of the Farmer was indicated yesterday when he slashed to pieces the schedule made for him by the El Paso promoters and arranged his affairs so that he could get as much rest as possible.\n\nIndications were last night that the bowl would be crowded to capacity before the champion entered the ring. The best seats are practically sold out and the ticket office literally swamped with orders last night.\n\nAmple parking space will facilitate the handling of the crowds, and people will be on hand to take care of the cars.\n\nNext week: the Times report of the opening of the Juarez coliseum and Dempsey's exhibition.\n\nTrish Long is the El Paso Times' archivist.
