        "text": "One night while in his mid-seventies, Dempsey was leaving his New York restaurant as two young men attempted to mug him. Dempsey held them until the NYPD arrived.\n\nHe knocked-out millionaire Howard Hughes. Hughes wanted to see \"what it would be like to spar with the heavyweight champion\".\n\n1927 rematch against Gene Tunney known as \"the long count.\" Dempsey knocked Tunney down for 14 to 18 seconds in the 7th round, but the referee did not start his count immediately, so Tunney got the extra time, then got up at 9 and went on to win the fight.\n\nHe had two daughters named Barbara. His first was born in 1936, with wife Hannah. His second daughter, with wife Deanna, was already named Barbara when he adopted her.\n\nRetired in 1927 but made a comeback in 1932 fighting over 100 exhibitions, sometimes knocking out 5 opponents in one night.\n\nPictured on one of fifteen 32Â¢ US commemorative postage stamps in the \"Celebrate the Century\" series, issued 3 February 1998, celebrating the 1910s.\n\nIn 1940 at age 45, he knocked out 3 professional wrestlers in the month of July.\n\nEarly in his career was knocked out in one round by \"Fireman\" Jim Flynn. A year later, Dempsey knocked out Flynn in one round.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mr. Dempsey served as a celebrity spokesman (even before the practice was commonplace) for the Chicago based DeVry Technical Institute (now DeVry University).\n\nHe had two daughters with his wife Hannah. Joan Hannah was born in 1934 and Barbara was born in 1936."
