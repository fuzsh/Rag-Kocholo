        "text": "Following the 2019 review of the South Australian Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs Commission Act 1980, the South Australian Multicultural Bill was developed to replace the Act.\n\nThe Bill reflects feedback received during a consultation period, which strongly supported the need to bring South Australiaâ€™s multicultural legislation into the 21st century.\n\nThe centrepiece of the new legislation is the South Australian Multicultural Charter which will consist of a set of principles defining what multiculturalism and interculturalism mean to all South Australians.\n\nThe development of the Charter will be led by the new South Australian Multicultural Commission, which will conduct community consultation as a vital part of the Charter development process."
