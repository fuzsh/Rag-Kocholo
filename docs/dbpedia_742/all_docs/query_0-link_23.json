        "text": "Life Without Barriers showed their support for National Reconciliation Week 2023 (NRW) by hosting, supporting and attending events held across the country. Here are some of the highlights.\n\nNew South Wales\n\nNational Reconciliation Week event in Orange\n\nWe supported partners Orange Aboriginal Medical Service at their NRW event. Orange turned on glorious weather for the day, which featured great talks and activities - most notably a community art piece where people placed handprints to represent the ongoing Reconciliation in Orange.\n\nOne of the highlights was a dance performance by another of Life Without Barriers' partners, Dinawan's Connection and students from Canobolas High School.\n\nReconciliation Week celebrations with partners at Tuggerah\n\nOur partners Walkabout Coffee and Culture held an NRW event drawing guests from the care sector, construction, education, hospitality, corrections and retail sectors.\n\nBilly and Lauren Duroux gave an emotional and personal presentation about their personal and family connections to NRW. Through their stories, audiences were shown how past government policies and injustices that were committed against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had an impact then, and how these acts continue to carry on impacting people today.\n\nThis was then followed by a yarning circle where attendees spoke about what Reconciliation Week meant for them.\n\nLuke Barnes, Life Without Barriers Cultural State Lead, said,\n\n“I had a great afternoon with our partners at Walkabout Coffee and Culture at their yarn up and presentation for Reconciliation Week.\"\n\n\"People from different backgrounds truly come together in Reconciliation. I was also lucky enough to receive a painted Coolamon from Billy as a recognition of Life Without Barriers and Walkabouts' ongoing partnership now and into the future.”\n\nRising from the Embers Festival in Newcastle\n\nRob Russell, National Director - Reconciliation, participated in the University of Newcastle’s National Reconciliation Week events, ‘RAPS In The Region’, and he joined other staff for the Rising From The Embers Festival.\n\nHeld on the lands of the Awabakal people, the festival brings together like-minded individuals and local organisations who share a passion for environmental sustainability and innovation.\n\nAttendees heard from Pro Vice-Chancellor Indigenous Strategy and Leadership, Mr Nathan Towney and Reconciliation Partner, Loren Collyer, on the role business and organisations have to play in the upcoming referendum on the Voice to Parliament.\n\nKoojay Corroboree\n\nRandwick Council and the La Perouse Local Aboriginal Land Council held the annual Koojay Corroboree on Coogee Beach, a stunning backdrop to electric performances by Aboriginal Dancers, including the Jannawi Dance Clan, and the Gamay Dancers from the Gujaga Foundation.\n\nSaltwater Dancers - students from Chifley Public School - performed three dances: ochre dance, pipi dance and Lyrebird dance. Warada Dance Group, meaning waratah, are students from Matraville Soldiers’ Settlement Public School who are practising culture. They raise awareness in the wider community and share stories through song and dance.\n\nA highlight was the Doonooch Dancers, who invited all the children to come to the sandy ‘stage’ to learn and take part in traditional dances. This was met with a burst of enthusiasm as the many schoolchildren in attendance rushed down to the sands.\n\n“The atmosphere was joyful and enchanting. I felt very lucky to experience the performances and learn more about what they meant.\"\n\n\"It touched all of us – I could see what I was feeling reflected in the faces around me, and it brought us all together,” said Michelle Tan, Senior External Communications Advisor.\n\nNorthern Territory\n\nBlak Talk’ at Garrmalang Festival\n\nWe listened to a panel talk on ‘The Voice – Let’s Talk about the Questions’. Moderator, Ursula Raymond was joined by panellists, Senator Malarndirri McCarthy, Dr Wendy Ludwig and Tony McVoy SC to discuss the referendum that will decide whether to give First National Australians a Voice to the Australian Parliament and the Government.\n\nWhen asked about what can non-Aboriginal and Torres Islander people do to support the voice, Dr Wendy Ludwig said, “Given we are only 3 per cent of the population, we are not going to win the vote on our own.\"\n\n\"Take responsibility for spending time educating other people in your families, in your social groups, and in your workplaces about what the real question is.\"\n\n\"What is the question? Do we need to have a set of principles and a group of people that are taking responsibility for putting our views on the table at a national level? That’s all we are asking for. That’s it.”\n\nKerrin Schallmeiner, Senior Marketing Advisor, said, “The future of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is in the hands of all Australians. It is our responsibility to build support for The Voice to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait people to be able to have a say in shaping their destiny.”\n\nReconciliation Week BBQ in Alice Springs\n\nThe Alice Springs Day Program hosted a BBQ where there were some ball games, music and dance.\n\n“We had a good time with the Day Program and Supported Independent Living participants,” said Devine Mizha, Disability Support Leader, who shared some pictures from the day.\n\nQueensland\n\nNational Sorry Day event with partners Link-Up QLD and Micah Projects\n\nWe had the honour of attending and hosting a table with our partners at Link up Queensland and Micah Projects for National Sorry Day.\n\nThe event gave attendees a chance to come together to reflect, reconnect, heal and acknowledge the impact of the past policies spanning more than 200 years, including the forced removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from their Kin and Country to Government owned Missions and Non-Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander families.\n\n“Every year, we hold this event where we hear from many different Elders and young people where they and their families have been affected by these past policies for many generations,\" said Silvia Jones-Terare, Life Without Barriers Cultural Support Worker.\n\n“This year, we had the honour to listen to Uncle Ken Murphy, Chairperson of Link-Up Queensland, who provided the Acknowledgement to Country. We heard from Uncle some of his story, and from two younger men about their journeys. One of the men is supported by Life Without Barriers, and another supported by Link Up.\n\n“We had the deadly young men from Hymba Yumba Independent School who did some amazing dancing for us. As well as an amazing choir that has been performing every year and telling their stories through songs.\n\n“Last but not least, we had our very own superstar and amazing Life Without Barriers Youth Worker Edgar Conlon performing on the day. We always love Edgar’s performances and are so proud of him!” said Silvia.\n\n“A special mention to Aunty Leoni and her delicious Fried Scones that she made for everyone today! We had many compliments.”\n\nSilvia shared about the multi-talented Leoni Lippitt, Queensland State Lead, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Initiatives. Leoni said;\n\n“Great morning with Uncle’s Acknowledgement to Country, two awesome speakers sharing their stories of connecting to family and Country. Thank you to all who supported the day, much appreciated.”\n\nSouthside Mabo Promotion Day 2023 – MABO Day Celebrations\n\nLeoni Lippitt and Darryl Monaghan joined the Torres Strait Islander community and friends at the Southside Mabo Promotion Day on the grounds of the Ngutana - Lui Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cultural Studies Centre in Inala.\n\nThe organisers made sure it was a fun day filled with exciting activities for the whole family, including lei making, face painting, tattoos, zaazi making, weaving, hair braiding, dancers and much more.\n\nThere was plenty of entertainment on the day and prizes for the best dressed - floral edition!\n\nAs one of the speakers said, “It's always awesome to see the Torres Strait Islander community come together, whether you're from the East or the West. Our people need to support one another; we all become stronger together, we have resilience, and we are able to accomplish bigger things for ourselves and our people”.\n\nDarryl enjoyed the music and watching the dances, and the various styles and movements, which included all ages. Leoni was happy to share the culture of her people with her colleague and friend.
