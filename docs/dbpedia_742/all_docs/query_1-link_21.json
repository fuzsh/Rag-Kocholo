        "text": "The power to define: Who is 'Aboriginal'?\n\nEver since white people mixed with Aboriginal people, they have struggled to define who is 'Aboriginal'.\n\nRacist definitions of Aboriginal identity\n\nFrom 1910 to the 1940s white people classified Indigenous people into castes. They defined\n\na 'full-blood' as a person who had no white blood,\n\na 'half-caste' as someone with one white parent,\n\na 'quadroon' or 'quarter-caste' as someone with an Aboriginal grandfather or grandmother,\n\na 'octoroon' as someone whose great-grandfather or great-grandmother was Aboriginal.\n\nThese \"one-dimensional models of Aboriginality\" pervaded literature of that time and were used in an effort to categorise Aboriginal people to determine if they were allowed or denied certain benefits. Today these words are considered offensive and racist. In fact, racism lies just beneath the surface and it \"bubbles out\" when Aboriginal identity is discussed.\n\nUse of these terms stopped in the 1960s. Instead, authorities tried to find alternate definitions of Aboriginal identity, which, however, were still influenced by colonial thinking. Since legislation for Indigenous people was a state matter, each state found its own definition for 'Aboriginal'. Examples:\n\nWestern Australia: a person with more than a quarter of Aboriginal blood.\n\nVictoria: any person of Aboriginal descent.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament defined an Aboriginal person as \"a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia\", a definition which was still in use in the early 1990s.\n\nStop insulting Aboriginal people or we may have to consider calling white Australians half-caste convicts.\n\n— Uncle Chicka Dixon, Aboriginal activist\n\nThree-part definition of Aboriginal identity\n\nIt took a 'Report on a Review of the Administration of the Working Definition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders' in 1981 to propose a new definition (my emphasis):\n\nThis is called the 'three-part' definition of Aboriginal identity and was soon adopted by all Commonwealth departments. The definition is also known as the tripartite test and was used in the High Court's Mabo decision in 1992.\n\nIf you were to define your Aboriginality you could answer these three questions as follows :\n\nDescent: \"I am a descendant of the Ngunnawal Nation from the South Slopes and Southern Tablelands of NSW\".\n\nIdentification: \"I am an Aboriginal person and a proud descendent of the Biripi people of Taree and I proudly identify as an Aboriginal person\".\n\nCommunity: \"I am known as an Aboriginal person within the Aboriginal community of Yass, where my father was born and in the Chippendale/Redfern areas of Sydney where I grew up and in Earlwood where I now live\".\n\nVariations of this definition were used later by legislative and government bodies. Many Aboriginal persons carry 'certificates' from Indigenous organisations which state their Aboriginality.\n\nHowever, the fact remains that a white authority defines who is an Aboriginal person rather than Aboriginal people (see further below how Aboriginal people define their identity).\n\nWithout our voices, Aboriginality will continue to be a creation for privileged opportunists and will always be about us rather than by us.\n\n— Julie Tommy Walker, Innawonga woman and Aboriginal leader\n\nFact\n\nUntil 1 July 2016, the Tasmanian government had a much stricter \"test\" of Aboriginality than the Commonwealth, which resulted in the Commonwealth counting 18,000 Aboriginal Tasmanians, while the Tasmanian government counted only 6,000.\n\nIdentity is choice\n\nAs you might have gathered from the previous section, non-Aboriginal people have long tried to define what 'Aboriginal' is. But do they have licence to do that?\n\nImagine your mother has an Aboriginal mother and Indian father, your father's parents are Scottish and Italian. Who are you? What is your identity?\n\nYou alone can choose your identity. You might feel strongly about one of the four heritages your parents gave you. Maybe its culture, customs and history resonates with you in a particular way. Maybe its country is calling you.\n\nThis is no different for Aboriginal people of mixed descent. Some choose to identify as Aboriginal because they feel strongly connected to that part, often because they are living in the country and on the land that connects them with their Aboriginal heritage. Others choose not to. We need to respect either decision and not question why they made it.\n\nStan Grant is a broadcaster and journalist whose mother is of mixed descent. He feels as if \"the very essence of belonging has been ruptured and the certainty of heritage blurred\". Stan chose to identify as a Wiradjuri man, but it's a choice that, for him, is not done and dusted.\n\n\"I am an Australian – yet my history tells me that my sense of citizenship and belonging is fragile and fraught,\" he says. \"I belong to a nation; I belong to family and a people and yet I am an individual free to determine for myself who and what I wish to be. But how do I do that?\"\n\nIt's a question many Aboriginal people ask themselves.\n\nWhat it is to be Indigenous has become a puzzle not easily explained, nor simple to comprehend.\n\n— Stan Grant, broadcaster and journalist\n\nVideo: A discussion about Aboriginal identity\n\nWatch a 5-minute extract of the SBS programme Insight: Aboriginal Or Not?\n\nThis was episode 19 of the 2012 season, broadcast on 7 August 2012.\n\nHaving to confirm Aboriginality is a major hurdle and offends\n\nEven 30 years after the three-part definition Aboriginal people are still asked to \"confirm\" their Aboriginality to services and bureaucrats.\n\nA confirmation of Aboriginality is usually required when applying for grants, university courses, unemployment and housing assistance, school programs or when applying for jobs which require an Aboriginal applicant.\n\nBut Aboriginal people still encounter major hurdles during the application process.\n\nRosie Gillman, from NSW, has always identified as Aboriginal, has paperwork signed by a government department that she is Aboriginal and a researched family tree that proves she is Aboriginal.\n\nYet in 2010 \"two major organisations\" she approached did not confirm her Aboriginality. Another woman she knows successfully applied, but her brother's application was also rejected.\n\nJack Charles is one of Australia's most renowned Aboriginal actors and was born to a Bunnerong woman and a Wiradjuri man. He was involved in setting up Australia's first Aboriginal theatre group, Nindethana, in Melbourne in 1971, performed in the 2012 Sydney Festival production I am Eora, about Sydney's Aboriginal community, and starred in the feature film Bastardy.\n\nYet that was not enough for the federal government's arts funding body, the Australia Council, which strictly followed protocol and demanded Charles prove his Aboriginality before it considered his application for a grant to write a book about his life.\n\nDeeply offended, Charles rejected to continue rehearsals for productions at the Sydney Theatre Company and Belvoir St Theatre.\n\nThe Council changed its protocol following the incident, and Aboriginal people are no longer forced to prove their identity when applying for grants.\n\nProblem: No standard for recognising Aboriginality\n\nSeveral problems impede recognition of Aboriginality:\n\nOrganisations do not recognise each other's paperwork.\n\nThere appears to be a lack of consistency between agencies (some have accepted statutory declarations).\n\nThere is no governing body regarding Aboriginality. It is left up to the individual organisations to interpret government rules.\n\nNo national register or directory of Aboriginal people exists.\n\nServices insist on confirming Aboriginality to avoid abuse. Like any system of services that aims to provide a benefit to a minority of society, Aboriginal services are subject to abuse by a small number of dishonest people. Some have therefore called for a national database of Aboriginal people to resolve \"once and for all\" the controversial issue of proving Aboriginality.\n\nSometimes non-Aboriginal people identify as a First Nations person for various reasons - some perceive benefits in doing so, others might see it as a \"fashionable\" thing to do or because they claim links to First Nations people. It is not respectful, however, and such people are often called race shifters, a term that emerged from North America.\n\nIf we can't work out who our own people are, how can we expect non-Aboriginal people to understand?\n\n— Ray Gates, Mentoring Program Coordinator, National Association of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Physiotherapists\n\nIs there genetic proof of Aboriginality?\n\nProposals of genetic testing as a means of proving one's Aboriginality have sometimes been dismissed on the grounds that 'race' and 'ethnicity' are social, cultural and political constructs which cannot be tested objectively.\n\nHowever, genome sequencing of a comprehensive study of Aboriginal Australians showed that Aboriginal people adapted biologically to the environment due to their long occupation of the continent, changing their genetic structure. The evidence suggested desert groups were able to withstand sub-zero night temperatures without showing the increase in metabolic rates observed in Europeans under the same conditions.\n\n\"People have changed and adapted over deep time as the country has ... we just don't see that in any other Homo sapiens populations,\" explains the co-author of the study, Dr Michael Westaway, of Griffith University.\n\nGenetics and migration\n\nAnother study suggests that Aboriginal people from the Eurasian population before Asian and European populations split from each other, probably 62,000 to 75,000 years ago, which matches the current accepted span of Aboriginal occupation (around 65,000 years).\n\nAs mankind expanded eastwards, Australian Aboriginal people left an early Asian expansion wave and migrated south. This explains the close genetic relationship to Munda speakers of India, the Aeta from the Philippines and Bougainville Papuans. Aboriginal people are also genetically closer to Asians (Cambodian, Japanese, Han, and Dai) than Europeans (French).\n\nThese findings suggest that before invasion Aboriginal people and Papua New Guinean Highlands people were genetically isolated from other populations, but not necessarily from each other.\n\nThe study confirmed that Australian Aboriginal people are \"one of the oldest continuous population histories outside sub-Saharan Africa today\".\n\nVideo: Australia's genetic history\n\nWatch Professor Eske Willerslev discuss the genetic history of Aboriginal Australians (Natural History Museum, University of Copenhagen).\n\nI never declared my ancestry. I didn't have to. White Australia pointed, sometimes even shouted it, out to me.\n\n— Lillian Holt, academic and writer\n\nFact\n\nAboriginal children of the desert regions are born with naturally blonde hair. It turns naturally to black around the time they are nine to ten years old.\n\nAboriginal people defining their Aboriginality\n\nPrior to colonisation the First People of Australia identified themselves by their nation. They would say \"I'm a Dharawal man\" or \"I'm an Eora woman\". Some country names around the greater Sydney area include Gundungurra (near Goulburn, south-west of Sydney), Dharawal (Woolongong), Eora (Sydney).\n\nMany Aboriginal people identify themselves as belonging to several nations for example as \"Yuwaalaraay and Gamilaraay\". This is because\n\ntheir parents or grandparents come from these nations. Traditionally they would've come from the same nation, but contemporary relationships often involve partners from different Aboriginal nations;\n\nthey have lived in two places and identify themselves with each.\n\nWhen people ask me where I am from, I say, \"I am from here, I am Kabi Kabi, Teribalang Bunda, Goreng Goreng and I have connection to South Sea Island heritage\".\n\n— Cheri Yavu-Kama-Harathunian, Coordinator Nulloo Yumbah Learning Spirituality and Research Centre at CQ University\n\nAnother way Aboriginal people identify is by their boundary or state name.\n\nAboriginal boundary (state) namesStateNameNew South WalesKoori, Goorie, Koorie, Coorie, MurriVictoriaKoorieSouth AustraliaNungaWestern AustraliaNoongar Northern TerritoryYolngu (top end); Anangu (central)QueenslandMurriTasmaniaPalawa, Koori\n\nStories of Aboriginal identity\n\nAboriginal people see their Aboriginality as much more than DNA alone – there is a mental component as well, an understanding of what it is to be Aboriginal that has been passed down, not brought in or learned academically.\n\nArtist and teacher Yalmay Gurrwun (Marika) Yunupingu addressed a crowd during the Human Rights and Social Justice Award 2014 keynote as follows. How do you think this introduction compares to that of a non-Aboriginal person?\n\n\"I’d like to introduce myself first 'Yol ŋarra? Who am I'? and where I’m from. My name is Gurruwuṉ Yunupingu also known as Yalmay which means special sand on a Dhuwa land and Gurruwuṉ means a special walking stick that two ancestral beings used when they started their journey from East to West. Marika is my maiden name before I was married into the Yunupingu family. Marika means ‘thunder and lightning’. My skin-name is Gamanydjan.\n\n\"My clan and Bäpurru [tribe] is Rirratjiŋu which is the language I speak, my father’s language. I am Dhuwa moiety which I inherited through my father’s side. My ḻikan [ancestral connection] is Gunitjpirr Guṉuwaŋa these are the special names identifying who I am just like your identification card on your driver’s licence. But we don’t carry our identification like a card, we live who we are.\"\n\nLet's be clear, Aboriginal identity is defined by us, no one else. We are a diverse peoples reflecting the contemporary Australia we all inhabit.\n\n— Jody Broun, Co-Chair National Congress of Australia's First Peoples\n\nVideo: \"I am not the problem\"\n\nAboriginal activist and former actor Rosalie Kunoth-Monks gave probably one of the most powerful statements of her identity. She replied to criticism of John Pilger's film Utopia in a Q&A broadcast on 9 June 2014 (transcript below).\n\nCheri Yavu-Kama-Harathunian says Aboriginal people accept those into their communities who claim to be of Aboriginal descent, regardless of their appearance.\n\n\"And if someone, coloured green, with scales instead of skin, a big bulging eye in the middle of what we call our forehead, and breaths blue smoke from what we call nostrils, comes to me and tells me that they are Aboriginal, I will say, 'Welcome home, you have just added one more number to our peoples population.'\"\n\nUniversity of Adelaide student Nathan Kauschke offers a more real-life experience when he reflects on the moment he first faced coming into an Aboriginal community.\n\n\"Being fair skinned, I was scared shitless of how the Indigenous community would receive me. I felt out of place until a gentlemen approached me, welcomed me and said 'it's been a long time brother'. I felt like a star as that man was Charles Perkins and his acceptance of me was the proudest day of my life. He knew who I was, he knew my soul.\"\n\nHowever, not all experiences are that positive. Bruce Pascoe, author of the acclaimed book Dark Emu, was deeply hurt when in late 2019 an Aboriginal woman accused him of not being Aboriginal and filed a complaint with the Home Affairs Minister who forwarded the matter to the Australian Federal Police (AFP). A few weeks later the AFP closed the case because it could not identify an offence.\n\nWhile Pascoe acknowledges that his Aboriginal roots are \"distant relationships\" they are nonetheless important to him, a choice he has made which should be respected.\n\nJudging Aboriginal people by their skin colour is a mistake that you should avoid. \"In Indigenous communities, that’s a very dangerous point,\" explains Nathan McGuire, a man from the Whadjuk Noongar people (Western Australia) and business man. \"It’s deeply layered, and tied into the history of invasion and colonisation. While skin tone is an important conversation in some communities, for Aboriginal people like me it’s a traumatic thing for someone to hear, and triggers deep emotions that surround our treatment in the past and today.\"\n\nPoem: Who Am I?\n\nNowhere to run and hide Its suicide People drunk Nowhere to bunk People fight I run and stay out of sight Boys in blue I don’t know what to do I’m poor But I won’t knock on a door My life is sad But I’m not bad I’m on my own All alone No one there So why would you care? I stay alive To survive I don’t know my ABC, 123 So what does that mean to me? Who am I? All I want to do is cry You may know me I don’t know my family\n\nThank you for sharing your poem, Sharon. Read more Aboriginal poetry\n\nWe, as First Nations peoples are not Australians. We are who we are. If individual Aboriginal people choose to be assimilated and seek to be part of the invader society, then good on them! But they must not pretend to talk for those of us who seek to be known by our own national identity of belonging to an Aboriginal nation state.\n\n— Michael Anderson, Aboriginal rights activist and leader of the Euahlayi tribe\n\nAlthough quite a few Aboriginal people would agree with Anderson and not consider themselves Australians, the High Court in 2020 found that \"you can be an Australian and not an Aboriginal person, but you can't be an Aboriginal person and not an Australian\".\n\nLate discovery\n\nIt is not uncommon that some Australians discover later in life that they have Aboriginal ancestors.\n\nIt might be because their parents hid this aspect from them, that family records don't exist or were destroyed, or that they have an incomplete family tree (e.g. due to the Stolen Generations).\n\nSuddenly the pressure is on to redefine one's identity, and possibly to also do a crash course in the culture you now identify with, as Aboriginal singer Casey Donovan knows only too well.\n\nShe new very little about her Aboriginal background. But when she shot to fame after winning Australian Idol in 2004 she had to catch up fast. \"After Idol, all of a sudden the media was asking me about my culture and I didn't know the answers. It was a shock for me. As soon as I could drive, I went up to Nambucca to an Indigenous learning centre to get to know my family and my heritage.\"\n\nOf coconuts, eggs and bananas\n\nIdentity Intact\n\nNo matter how much you dilute Mix, match and try to pollute Our identity remains intact Something you can't change, that's a fact Our spirit is not measured by the shade of our skin But by something stronger found within A place you can not touch or take away It will remain shining out till our dying day We all connect with it again No matter how far we've been.\n\nThis poem was written by Deidre Currie, Tweed Heads, NSW . Read more Aboriginal poetry.\n\nThe very fabric of what it means to be Aboriginal [is] that being, living and breathing the journey, walking the land as proud Aboriginal people, knowing the importance of being respectful within our community and wanting with all your heart and ability to make positive change.\n\n— Paul Ralph, CEO KARI Aboriginal Resources Inc\n\nWhat does it mean to be 'Aboriginal'?\n\nIn this section Aboriginal people define for themselves what it means to be Aboriginal.\n\nA friend of mine put it this way: \"To be Aboriginal is many things and different to all. But at this moment, to me, it includes to follow a path to those who journeyed before you, similar but different, to hear the secret and loving stories of the land with understanding, to be independent, to hear and see with feeling that which can not be seen with open eyes, be part of a group, be as natural as the land, and to be hospitable and enjoy hospitality.\"\n\nMick Gooda, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, said: \"For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples it is our beliefs, our culture, and our family histories that contribute to our sense of who we are and what we mean to others. They are our source of belonging – and they anchor us and steer our course through our lives.\"\n\nPoet and Bayili woman Zelda Quakawoot says that Aboriginal people have \"a long and deep connection to land, the sea, and this is reflected and proven through the continued practises of tradition. This includes ceremonial activities relating to manhood, womanhood and nature, taboos about marriage and other customs within groups of people, division of labour according to hunting and gathering groups, and the special ways we identify and caretake land and sea areas. These are the things which identify the First Nation of a country.\"\n\nYou can only be a proud Aboriginal person if you carry your own learning and cultural lifestyle with you.\n\n— Galarrwuy Yunupingu, Chairman Yothu Yindi Foundation\n\nTo me, Aboriginality is about that shared experience, that shared culture and that shared pride.\n\n— Amy McQuire, Aboriginal journalist\n\nIn-between black and white\n\nBruce Pascoe, an Aboriginal writer and language researcher, from the Bunurong clan of the Kulin nation, reflects on missed opportunities to learn more about his culture:\n\n\"My insight into Aboriginal Australia is as abbreviated as my heritage has allowed. It is as if I have been led at night to a hill overlooking country I have never seen. I am blindfolded but at dawn the cloth is removed and I am asked to open my eyes for one second, any longer and I will be killed, and then asked to describe that country.\"\n\nI haven't felt like I fitted into the binary of black and white. Often in our lives we inhabit the in-between world, the different spaces that come up between the extremes.\n\n— Peter Waples-Crowe, Koori artist\n\nI tell my grandchildren you might not want to go to an Aboriginal dance and you might not want to talk our language, but the whitefella still calls you Aboriginal, I don't care how you act like the whitefella. You are still Aboriginal, you can't change that.\n\n— Joyce Injie, Aboriginal woman, Yinhawangka tribe\n\nPatrick Dodson, a respected Aboriginal elder and leader, received the 2008 Sydney Peace Prize. In his thank you speech he described what peace means to him, revealing his notion of Aboriginal identity at the same time, in an almost poetic manner .\n\n\"Peace from the drunks, the alcohol abuse, the violence, and the molestation that takes place... Peace from the harassment from police, peace from discrimination and racism, that people experience when they try to get a flat or a house or seek to get a job. Peace from the gazing eyes of the public as you enter a room because of the colour of your skin. Peace because of the unsettled nature of our relationship with this country, which was once ours and has since been taken over... And a peace that comes from knowing that you have to justify who you are every day of the week just because you are an Aboriginal person.\"\n\nBeing Aboriginal is about relationships\n\nBeing Aboriginal is a lot about relationships. Here's an extract from a Welcome to Country given by Rob Welsh, Chairman of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council in Sydney, which illustrates in a humorous way what this means in practice .\n\n\"This is a bit of wisdom that comes from one of my elders in Redfern. I was walking along Redfern Street, and an elder came up to me. And he said to me: 'Rob, as a leader in this community, there's something you gotta know. And what I'm going to tell ya affects the Aboriginal people in Redfern and right around Australia. But it also affects the people from right around the world, every culture.' He looked at me and said: 'Rob, where there's a will, there's a relative!'\"\n\nSecurity to aisle three' can generally be translated as 'identifiable Aboriginal of any age shopping in aisle three'.\n\n— Sharon Livermore, Aboriginal poet\n\nLateral violence—when Aboriginal people go against Aboriginal people\n\nSome Aboriginal people are very suspicious of their kind getting too close to whitefellas.\n\nAboriginal lawyer and elder Noel Pearson from Queensland, ALP powerbroker Warren Mundine, and Aboriginal academic Marcia Langton were all met with suspicions by their own people because they engaged with people from all sides .\n\nSome members of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities express suspicion of those who do not fit their model of Aboriginal authenticity--questions of identity becoming a powerful mechanism to run each other down . Negative behaviour like this is known as \"lateral violence\".\n\nTwitter responses\n\nAfter One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson said there was no definition of Aboriginal in an interview in November 2016, Aboriginal people took to Twitter to express what being Aboriginal meant for them.\n\nHere are a few selected responses . Can you find a common thread?\n\n\"Having to get an Uber because a Taxi wont pick you up.\"\n\n\"Being called racist for calling out racists.\"\n\n\"Walking in the shops with mates but you're the only one followed around.\"\n\n\"When your success is met with 'Yeah, but you're one of the good ones' and your failure is met with 'Told you so!'\"\n\n\"Being told you speak well for an Aboriginal.\"\n\n\"Going to more funerals than weddings.\"\n\n\"Being told by a school mate at my reunion that the day I was born was the darkest in my town's history.\"\n\n\"Being told you're too pretty & smart to be Aboriginal.\"\n\n\"Teacher tells you the Stolen Generation[s] [were] conceived from a good genuine place and [were] meant to help Aboriginal people.\"\n\n\"Having to work twice as hard for a fraction of the success.\"\n\n\"Being 10 years old & watching your dad get locked up for skateboarding on a footpath & [jay]walking.\"\n\n\"Identifying as Aboriginal only to be told 'Don't worry, I couldn't even tell'.\"\n\n\"Having to put up with people who talk really slow at you, often in tiny patronising voices.\"\n\n\"As a[n] 8 year old, you and your cousin having to empty your pockets after paying for your items.\"\n\n\"Being strong & proud, connection to my home country, caring for others, family & community, having respect for Elders.\"\n\nHow do I prove I am Aboriginal?\n\nSometimes you discover an Aboriginal ancestor in your family and you start asking yourself: Am I Aboriginal too? How much 'Aboriginality' does it require to be Aboriginal? Who can 'prove' that I am Aboriginal?\n\nIn other cases, you know you are Aboriginal, but you have to prove it to an employer or organisation.\n\nAboriginal or Torres Strait Islander heritage is voluntary and very personal. You don't need paperwork to identify as an Aboriginal person. However, you may be asked to provide confirmation when applying for Aboriginal-specific jobs, services or programs (for example grants).\n\nStep 1: Prepare yourself for the process\n\nThe process to prove your Aboriginality can be stressful, as Nyikina academic Emily Poelina-Hunter experienced first-hand when she applied for her job at RMIT University.\n\n\"Collating family history evidence can be difficult and emotionally distressing; there is a fear of community rejection; and a fear that your potential employers may be thinking that you’re 'faking it' while you’re waiting for the confirmation document to arrive,\" she explains.\n\nThe difficulties arise because getting evidence of Aboriginal descent and community acceptance depend on how invasion and the time since impacted your family, something that's out of your control.\n\nGather as much information about your family history and heritage as possible. This can be, for example,\n\nbirth, death and marriage certificates,\n\noral history (stories), or\n\nphotographs.\n\nStep 2: Prepare the paperwork\n\nWhat you need is a confirmation letter from an Aboriginal incorporated organisation. To get it, you need paperwork that satisfies the three-part definition of Aboriginality (You are of Aboriginal descent, identify as Aboriginal and are accepted as such by your community).\n\nYou'll need two statutory declarations: one asserting that you self-identify as Aboriginal; a second asserting your community connections. Then send both to an Aboriginal incorporated organisation, ideally one in your community.\n\nThat organisation then sends your confirmation letter to your employer (or the organisation requesting it).\n\nPrepare yourself mentally for potential disappointment. \"The three-part test for Aboriginality is an 'all or nothing' test,\" says Emily, and blames colonisation for some Aboriginal people's failure to fulfill all three parts of the definition. The confirmation letters remind her of the old certificates of exemption issued during Australia’s White Australia policy era.\n\nOrganisations to contact are, for example:\n\nYour Local Aboriginal Land Council.\n\nThe Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS). About 20% of the Family History requests are about “Proof of Aboriginality and Torres Strait Islander Heritage” . Note that AIATSIS can only provide information to clients on how they might obtain proof of their heritage, but cannot make a determination.\n\nIf family members were removed from your family (Stolen Generations), you can get help with finding your family.\n\nTeaching resources\n\nReview the lyrics of Cher's song Half-breed and listen to the song on YouTube (see video below).\n\nHow do you think a \"half-breed\" feels in society?\n\nWhy do people call her that name?\n\nList all the parallels you can find between this song and experiences of Australian Aboriginal people. Use their poetry if you get stuck.\n\nThink of two ways how the last line of the song could apply to Aboriginal people.\n\nHalf-breed\n\nMy father married a pure Cherokee My mother's people were ashamed of me The Indians said I was white by law The White Man always called me \"Indian Squaw\" [Chorus:] Half-breed, that's all I ever heard Half-breed, how I learned to hate the word Half-breed, she's no good they warned Both sides were against me since the day I was born We never settled, went from town to town When you're not welcome you don't hang around The other children always laughed at me \"Give her a feather, she's a Cherokee\" [Repeat chorus] We weren't accepted and I felt ashamed Nineteen I left them, tell me who's to blame My life since then has been from man to man But I can't run away from what I am [Repeat chorus]"
