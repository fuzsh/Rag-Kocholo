Our family recipes have been passed down from generation to generation, including our famous macaroni and cheese and potato salad.\n\nOn Saturday, July 27, 2024, instead of opening at 12:00 noon we will be opening at 2:00 pm due to a private function. We are sorry for any inconvenience this may cause. Thank you."
