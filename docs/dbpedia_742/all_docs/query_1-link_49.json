        "text": "The Albanese government has proposed to enshrine in the constitution an Indigenous voice to parliament, which would be voted on in a referendum.\n\nThe historic national vote will take place on Saturday 14 October.\n\nWhat has happened already?\n\nThe simple referendum question for us all to vote on and the final wording of the constitutional amendment has been decided as follows:\n\nThe question:\n\nA Proposed Law: to alter the Constitution to recognise the First Peoples of Australia by establishing an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice.\n\nDo you approve this proposed alteration?\n\nThe proposed alteration to the constitution:\n\nChapter IX Recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples 129 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice\n\nIn recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Peoples of Australia:\n\n1: There shall be a body, to be called the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice;\n\n2: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice may make representations to the Parliament and the Executive Government of the Commonwealth on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples;\n\n3: The Parliament shall, subject to this Constitution, have power to make laws with respect to matters relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, including its composition, functions, powers and procedures.\n\nThe referendum requires a majority of votes in a majority of states to succeed. If the vote is successful, parliament will then design the voice via legislation.\n\nFor those who have never voted in a referendum before – or for those who need a refresher – here is what you need to know about how to vote.\n\nThe voting process is similar to an election, but not exactly the same. Pre-polling is now open across the country. Pre-polling centres are open until 14 October. You can find polling sites near you by going to the Australian Electoral Commission website. Postal vote applications will become available soon. For more information, see the AEC website.\n\nThe official “yes” and “no” pamphlets have been published online by the AEC, triggering fierce debate about their contents.\n\nThe pamphlets contain arguments for the “yes” and “no” cases written by politicians who voted for or against the bill in parliament.\n\nIt’s important to note the pamphlets are not fact-checked by an independent source or external authority. They have been published by the AEC, but it has no role to play in verifying their content.\n\nGuardian Australia has fact checked and annotated both pamphlets, here:\n\nThe yes campaign’s voice to parliament pamphlet – annotated and fact checked\n\nThe no campaign’s voice to parliament pamphlet – annotated and fact checked\n\nThe Australian electoral commission has set up a website to help voters understand the constitution and the referendum. The AEC will track campaign funding and is running a disinformation register.\n\nWhat is the voice to parliament and how would it work?\n\nThe voice would advise parliament and government on matters affecting Indigenous communities. The Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, has said she will ask the voice to prioritise Indigenous health, housing, education and jobs.\n\nConservative critics have raised fears the voice could spur court challenges, but a majority of leading constitutional lawyers have all either spoken strongly in favour of the voice or rebuffed concerns about the legal effect of its representations.\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nBurney said the voice is a way for Aboriginal and Islander people to directly advise all levels of government about laws and policies that affect their lives. “It’s about drawing a line on the poor outcomes from the long legacy of failed programs and broken policies, and listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people,” she said.\n\n“Things like incarceration and child removal. Housing, health and educational outcomes. This voice is about making sure that what happens in the federal parliament is going to be a positive step forward both in terms of us as a nation, but also the life outcomes for First Nations people in Australia.”\n\nHow would the voice be structured?\n\nThe referendum working group advising the government says the design of the voice will be guided by the following principles:\n\nIt will provide independent advice to parliament and government.\n\nIt will be chosen by First Nations people based on the wishes of local communities.\n\nIt will be representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.\n\nIt will be empowering, community-led, inclusive, respectful, culturally informed and gender balanced. It will also include youth.\n\nIt will be accountable and transparent.\n\nThe voice will work alongside existing organisations and traditional structures.\n\nThe Calma-Langton co-design report recommended the national voice have 24 members, with gender balance structurally guaranteed.\n\nThe base model proposes two members from each state, the Northern Territory, ACT and Torres Strait. A further five members would represent remote areas due to their unique needs – one member each from the Northern Territory, Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. An additional member would represent the significant population of Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland.\n\nMembers would serve four-year terms, with half the membership determined every two years. There would be a limit of two consecutive terms for each member.\n\nTwo co-chairs of a different gender to one another would be selected by the members of the voice every two years.\n\nThe Calma-Langton model proposed a national voice with two permanent advisory groups – one on youth and one on disability – and a small ethics council to advise on probity and governance.\n\nHow would local and regional voices feed in?\n\nThe co-design report proposed 35 regions, broken down by state and territory. Communities and governments in each state and territory would jointly determine these.\n\nLocal and regional voices would provide advice to all levels of government to influence policy and programs, and advise the non-government sector and business.\n\nThe report outlines their roles, how they would be constituted and the principles they would embody, like cultural leadership, community-led design and empowerment.\n\nThere would be “a clear, two-way flow of advice and communication” between them and the national voice, the report said.\n\nWhat would an Indigenous voice to parliament not do?\n\nThe national voice would be an advisory body to the Australian parliament and government. It would not deliver services, manage government funding, be a clearing house for research, or mediate between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations.\n\nHow would disputes be resolved?\n\nThe report recommended mediation in the first instance. If that failed, matters would go to an independent review. The report suggested there be an agreed list of people with appropriate experience to conduct such reviews, and at least one of the reviewers should be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person.\n\nIt suggested the final decision-maker could be the relevant minister, alongside two respected, independent Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people."
