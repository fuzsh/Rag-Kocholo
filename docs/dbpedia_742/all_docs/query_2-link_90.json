        "text": "John “Jack” Dempsey, 64, a lawyer and partner at Dickinson, Wright in Ann Arbor, is making his first run for elected office. A historian and published writer, Dempsey is also president of the Michigan Historical Commission, to which he was appointed in June 2007.\n\nQ: What skills have you gained from your career and personal experience that would help you as a trustee, and how would you apply those skills to working in township government?\n\nA: For 30 years my law practice has centered on improving government and restoring power to the people. I’ve long advocated for streamlined, transparent, and responsive government. As historian and published writer, I’ve developed research, analysis, and presentation skills for effective, accurate public communications. As church trustee/elder, I understand how to respect diverse opinions and focus on priority needs of individuals in group settings. Key for a township trustee is commitment to acting as a fiduciary: how to plan and care for someone else’s property. I’ve exercised this responsibility on various statewide governing boards; I’ve been chair and president of several, for multiple years. I offer voters a combination of experience and character that would improve how the board deals with the public and amongst itself.\n\nQ: Much has been said about the current board’s relationship with some elements of the community, and about poor relationships between some board members. How would you, as a trustee, work toward being able to disagree more agreeably, and toward gaining the respect of all voters, even those who speak up to oppose board actions?\n\nA: My campaign pledge to follow a personal ethics code if elected, and advocate a strong code for the board, includes a commitment to respecting others’ viewpoints and listening positively to the public’s input in all forums. My campaign has centered on positive ideas without personal attacks. That leadership example would help foster a board culture that is not defensive about concerns or evidence that contradicts official positions, but rather is receptive and open-minded. Informed opinions – even if critical of township government – are an opportunity for re-assessing those positions, rather than a threat. My vow is to be honest, transparent, accountable, and respectful of the people’s will.\n\nQ: What is your view of the Plymouth Arts and Recreation Complex becoming a public, taxpayer-supported entity for Plymouth and Plymouth Township residents? What is your view of recent improvements to township recreation facilities, especially Plymouth Township Park?\n\nA: I’m against raising taxes; government needs to live within its means. A trustee must be tenacious on efficiency, open to creative ideas, and laser-focused on ensuring every tax dollar is spent carefully – it is the public’s money, not the board’s. I’m for historic preservation and support PARC’s publicly stated mission. The facility has potential to become a beneficial community asset. One of its leaders states “there are many ways to obtain financial support without raising local taxes.” But recreation decisions must be based on actively seeking the input of all residents. The proposed amphitheater fails this test, and it ignored the approved 2010 recreation plan. The board needs to make public safety, recreation, and budget decisions in accord with the will of the people.\n\nQ: Name your top two priorities for Plymouth Township and briefly describe how, as a trustee, you would go about addressing those priorities.\n\nA: Public trust in the board and public safety must be improved. The current board has shown a tendency to put itself at odds with the public and each other. We need a township government that listens to and resembles the great community it is to serve. I would assertively take government to the people, holding open sessions, seeking input through all means available, and shaping board policy accordingly. I would not accept anything less than complete openness and transparency in all board activities. We must not waste tax dollars on non-essentials and provide the highest quality of emergency response to our residents, especially seniors and the disabled. Efficiencies will enable reopening of Station 2 for the benefit of the entire populace."
