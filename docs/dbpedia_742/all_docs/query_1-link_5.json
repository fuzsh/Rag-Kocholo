Closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians\n\nThe Hon Jenny Macklin MP, Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs\n\nThe Policy Challenge\n\nThe Australian Government's reform agenda — both in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and across governments — is to address the structural and systemic problems that are producing appalling outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\nA generation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children — Australian children — is at stake. Time is fast running out. This fact is acknowledged by Indigenous elders and leaders, as well as by government...\n\nIndigenous Australians must be involved in developing and driving solutions. Actions like the National Apology are working to build the trust needed to work together on getting results.\n\nOur 'closing the gap' commitments require effective engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at all levels. Government needs to involve Indigenous people in the design and delivery of programs locally and regionally, and share responsibility for outcomes. Solutions developed on the ground must be driven by the communities that will ultimately determine their success or failure...\n\nThe Government went to the election with a commitment to set up a national representative body to provide an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voice within government. We will soon begin formal discussions with Indigenous people about the role, status and composition of this body.\n\nMay 2008\n\nNote – Use of the terms ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ and ‘Indigenous peoples’\n\nThe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner recognises the diversity of the cultures, languages, kinship structures and ways of life of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. There is not one cultural model that fits all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples retain distinct cultural identities whether they live in urban, regional or remote areas of Australia.\n\nThroughout this issues paper, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders are referred to as ‘peoples’. This recognises that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders have a collective, rather than purely individual, dimension to their livelihoods.\n\nThroughout this report, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are also referred to as ‘Indigenous peoples’.\n\nThe use of the term ‘Indigenous’ has evolved through international law. It acknowledges a particular relationship of Aboriginal people to the territory from which they originate. The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has explained the basis for recognising this relationship as follows:\n\nIndigenous or aboriginal peoples are so-called because they were living on their lands before settlers came from elsewhere; they are the descendants – according to one definition – of those who inhabited a country or a geographical region at the time when people of different cultures or ethnic origins arrived, the new arrivals later becoming dominant through conquest, occupation, settlement or other means... (I)ndigenous peoples have retained social, cultural, economic and political characteristics which are clearly distinct from those of the other segments of the national populations.\n\nThroughout human history, whenever dominant neighbouring peoples have expanded their territories or settlers from far away have acquired new lands by force, the cultures and livelihoods – even the existence – of indigenous peoples have been endangered. The threats to indigenous peoples’ cultures and lands, to their status and other legal rights as distinct groups and as citizens, do not always take the same forms as in previous times. Although some groups have been relatively successful, in most part of the world indigenous peoples are actively seeking recognition of their identities and ways of life.[1]\n\nThe Social Justice Commissioner acknowledges that there are differing usages of the terms ‘Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander’, ‘Aboriginal’ and ‘indigenous’ within government policies and documents. When referring to a government document or policy, we have maintained the government’s language to ensure consistency.\n\n© Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.\n\nThis work is copyright.

In the Apology speech, the Prime Minister stated that:\n\nOur challenge for the future is to embrace a new partnership between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The core of this partnership for the future is closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians on life expectancy, educational achievement and employment opportunities. This new partnership on closing the gap will set concrete targets for the future.\n\nIn furtherance of this commitment, in March 2008 the Australian Government and federal Opposition also signed a Statement of Intent to work in partnership with Indigenous people and their representative organisations to achieve equality in health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-Indigenous Australians by the year 2030. This statement provides bipartisan support to:\n\ndevelop a comprehensive, long-term plan of action, that is targeted to need, evidence-based and capable of addressing the existing inequities in health services, in order to achieve equality of health status and life expectancy between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non- Indigenous Australians by 2030.\n\nensure the full participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and their representative bodies in all aspects of addressing their health needs.\n\nrespect and promote the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples... and\n\nmeasure, monitor, and report on our joint efforts, in accordance with benchmarks and targets, to ensure that we are progressively realising our shared ambitions.\n\nThese are welcome commitments and ‘first steps’ to a new partnership in Indigenous affairs.\n\nIt is now time for us to flesh out these commitments to ensure the full participation and input of Indigenous peoples into government decision making at the national level.\n\nAnd this, ultimately, is what the discussion about a new National Indigenous Representative Body is about.\n\nIt is about our place at the table in making the decisions that impact on our communities, on our men, our women and our children.\n\nIt is about creating a genuine partnership with government and across society:\n\nWith shared ambition, so we are all working towards the same goals and not at cross purposes.\n\nWith mutual respect, so we are part of the solutions to the needs of our communities instead of being treated solely as the problem.\n\nWith joint responsibility, so that we can proceed with an honesty and an integrity where both governments and Indigenous people accept that we each have a role to play, and where we each accept our responsibilities to achieve the change needed to ensure that our children have an equal life chance to those of other Australians.\n\nWith respect for human rights, that affirms our basic dignity as human beings and provides objective, transparent standards against which to measure our joint efforts.\n\nTo this end, in 2007 I initiated research to identify the key considerations that will need to be addressed in establishing a new National Indigenous Representative Body.[2]\n\nThis paper sets out the findings of that research. It addresses a series of issues for consideration in the process of establishing a new National Indigenous Representative Body. Namely:\n\nFirst, what lessons can be learned from mechanisms for representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples at the national, State/ Territory or regional level that have previously existed or that are currently in place?\n\nSecond, what lessons can be learned from mechanisms for representing Indigenous peoples that have been established in other countries?\n\nAnd third, what options are there for ensuring that a National Indigenous Representative Body is sustainable?\n\nThe research does not substitute for broad-based consultation with Indigenous communities. Indeed, the research does not state a preference for a particular model for a National Indigenous Representative Body – it merely identifies the many and varied issues that need to be considered in the formulation of the new Body.\n\nThe paper raises challenges for both the federal government and for Indigenous people.\n\nFor the government, it will be of critical importance that you articulate what you are not prepared to support in a new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nI encourage the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs to articulate what the government sees as the major benefits of a national representative body and accordingly, what roles the government hopes it will fulfill.\n\nI am not suggesting that the government should be prescriptive and close off debates that may need to be had. But ultimately, we need to minimise the differences between what the Indigenous community expects of its representative body and what government is prepared to support.\n\nIf we don’t ‘close this gap’ between the expectations of government and the Indigenous community, then a new body may face the same credibility difficulties that have beset previous representative bodies. This will limit the ability for the representative body to have influence with government. It may limit the representative body’s ability to be an effective agent for change for the Indigenous community.\n\nThe responsibilities of a new National Indigenous Representative Body are two way – to government and to Indigenous people.\n\nAnd for Indigenous people, the challenges that exist in establishing a new National Indigenous Representative Body are many.\n\nWe should resist the temptation to slip back into old habits. This is not about reviving ATSIC. The ATSIC Review of 2003 did not recommend the abolition of ATSIC but instead proposed a restructure and close adherence to a series of key principles. I am confident that Indigenous people will draw on the lessons from the ATSIC Review while also looking beyond the ATSIC model when setting out their hopes and expectations for a new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nI consider that perhaps the greatest problem that ATSIC faced was that it was ‘blamed’ for the lack of progress in addressing Indigenous disadvantage, despite the simple fact that it had few responsibilities for service delivery that could contribute to achieving this goal. This was a key finding of the ATSIC Review in 2003.\n\nI see significant benefits for a new National Indigenous Representative Body to not exercise the service delivery responsibilities of government. As for all other Australians, let government be responsible for delivering services to Indigenous citizens. We don’t want to take the blame for second class treatment by government anymore.\n\nLet the new Representative Body set the vision for our people’s future, provide the guidance to achieving this and advocate for understanding for the consequences that flow from our status as the First Peoples of this nation.\n\nA new National Indigenous Representative Body will also have to operate in a vastly changed environment from when ATSIC existed. This is one with:\n\nconcrete commitments from government to closing the gap, with a partnership approach at the centre of this process;\n\na renewed focus on reconciliation, following from the National Apology to the stolen generations;\n\na whole of government system for delivering services to Indigenous people where the primary responsibility resides with mainstream government departments; and\n\nsignificant environmental challenges facing all Australians, and where the traditional knowledge, practices and land use of Indigenous peoples will have a significant role to play in preserving the quality of life of all Australians.\n\nA new National Indigenous Representative Body will also be created within the context of rapid advances internationally in the recognition of the rights of Indigenous peoples – developments which the new Australian government has indicated it supports and respects.\n\nIt is essential that as Indigenous peoples we have a seat at the table and are involved in the big debates that affect our communities. It is not credible to suggest that we should not have such involvement.\n\nMy hope is that we can, in partnership with government, develop a new National Indigenous Representative Body that engages with different sections of the pan-Aboriginal and/ or Torres Strait Islander community – be it women, men, our youth and children, communities in different geographical locations, traditional owners or stolen generations members.\n\nAnd I hope that a representative body will operate in such a way as to inspire and support our people, while also holding governments accountable for their efforts, so we may ultimately enjoy equal life chances to all other Australians.\n\nThe first step on this road is mutual respect and a partnership. A National Indigenous Representative Body is an essential component of achieving the long overdue commitments to closing the gap.\n\nTom Calma\n\n(signature)\n\nSection 1: National Indigenous Representative Bodies in Australia – A History\n\nIndigenous Australians have often organised themselves in an attempt to effect political and social change. Many Indigenous organisations were created as a result of this, particularly over the past century. These organisations were independent of government and were often defined by their specific objectives. Such organisations became focused on particular campaigns rather than systemic issues of Indigenous representation.\n\nWhen the federal government became heavily involved in Indigenous affairs following the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, more focus was given to how Indigenous peoples could be represented within the mechanisms of government.\n\nText Box 1 below provides an overview of developments relating to national Indigenous representative bodies in Australia over the past fifty years.\n\nThis section will make brief mention of the activities of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines & Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) and then focus on the three organisations that have been involved in national Indigenous representation:\n\nthe National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC);\n\nthe National Aboriginal Conference (NAC); and\n\nthe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).\n\nThis section describes their structure as well as the problems and challenges that were faced by these organisations during their lifetime. It is fair to say that each new body learnt from the lessons of its predecessor. Many concrete outcomes emerged, not the least of which was the capacity building and advocacy development that emerged amongst the Indigenous polity. This is available to be tapped again in a new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nText Box 1 – Overview of national Indigenous representative and advocacy bodies in Australia\n\n1957 - Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines & Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) established independently of government.\n\n1973 - National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC) established.

It was able to leverage widespread community support following the 1967 referendum into a groundswell of acceptance for the principle of land rights.\n\nIts membership base was in organisations rather than individuals. Its 1975 constitution allowed for two categories of member organisations. Category ‘A’ organisations were required to agree to the five basic principles of FCAATSI and were exclusively concerned with Aboriginal affairs, or had a standing committee so concerned.\n\nCategory ‘B’ organisations were those that supported the objectives of FCAATSI but could not qualify for category ‘A’ membership. Category ‘A’ organisations could send up to five delegates to the Annual General Meeting. Category ‘B’ organisations could send two. Voting for the Executive was limited to the Aboriginal delegates of these organisations, but nomination and election to the Executive committee was open to non-Indigenous peoples.[4]\n\nDebate over the principle of Aboriginal control of the Executive split the Council at its 1970 annual meeting.[5] Debate continued at least until the 1977 meeting, when a revision to its Constitution was proposed, but by that time it representative functions had been taken over by the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC).\n\nMany of the principles of both equality and particular Indigenous rights that FCAATSI fought for have been widely recognised, with attention now turning to their effective implementation.\n\nIn the period since FCAATSI existed, the principle of self-determination has supported national bodies being comprised exclusively of Indigenous members. There are, however, existing organisations which are Indigenous/non-Indigenous alliances. Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation (ANTaR) works with an Indigenous Reference Group. Reconciliation Australia (RA), a not-for-profit corporation, has Indigenous and non-Indigenous people on the Board. Nevertheless, they are widely perceived as non-Indigenous organisations. Their effectiveness could perhaps be enhanced by the existence of a National Indigenous Representative Body that could act as an external point of reference for their programs.\n\nNational Indigenous Representative Bodies in Australia, 1972 – 2008\n\n1) National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (NACC), 1972 - 1977\n\nThe NACC was the first unified national Indigenous organisation that represented Indigenous views. Prior to the NACC, the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI) had evolved as the major organisation promoting Indigenous interests from the 1950s. While FCAATSI played a central role in the success of the 1967 referendum, its leadership was largely non-Indigenous.[6] Following the election of the Whitlam government the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gordon Bryant, created the NACC.\n\nStructure\n\nThe NACC was an advisory body made up of 41 nationally elected Aboriginal people who advised the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal policy.[7] It was envisaged that the structure of the NACC would be detailed by the first elected representatives of the body. There appears to have been little structural development of the organisation before it first met.\n\nThe Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA), under the leadership of Charles Perkins, held 16 regional consultations to promote the idea of the NACC and to mobilise the Indigenous population to vote in the subsequent NACC elections. To a large extent these consultations were successful, with approximately 78% of Indigenous peoples voting in November 1983.[8] The constitution developed by the NACC gave it executive, or policy-making, and administrative powers, contrary to the government’s desire that it remain simply advisory. Throughout its short life, the NACC remained organisationally under-developed.\n\nAutonomy, Resilience and Vulnerability\n\nThe NACC was ultimately vulnerable for a variety of reasons.[9] It is helpful to categorise these reasons as both internal and external.\n\nRegarding external vulnerabilities, firstly there were major tensions between the NACC, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) and the Minister. Minister Bryant often gave preference to the advice of NACC over that of the DAA. This led to hostility between the DAA and the NACC. This situation reversed when Minister Bryant was replaced by Senator Jim Cavanagh as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. No clear relationship between all stakeholders appears to have been clearly articulated.\n\nSecondly, the NACC desired greater independence and did not wish to simply act as an advisory body. Without the support of the government in this aim for autonomy, the public were unsupportive of such a move.\n\nRegarding internal vulnerabilities, firstly the NACC was unable to develop a coherent organisational structure that could deliver for its constituents. This situation was almost certainly at least partly due to the under-resourcing of the organisation by government. However, the limited capacity of the organisation was also due, in part, to the lack of clarity members had about their roles, the relative inexperience of the secretariat and a lack of focus by the members on internal structures rather than external advocacy.\n\nFurthermore, the NACC is seen to have lacked cohesion as an organisation. The elected members often failed to agree among themselves on issues of importance. A constant tension was seen to exist between the interests of Aboriginal people living in more rural and remote ‘traditional’ lifestyles and urban Aboriginal people. This tension was fuelled by the opinions of non-Indigenous advisors to the government at the time.[10]\n\nUltimately, the NACC did not have the capacity to develop into an independent, agenda-setting policy organisation due to a lack of government support for such a function and the NACC’s unmet need to develop coherent policy position regarding its functions and structure.\n\n2) National Aboriginal Conference (NAC), 1977 - 1985\n\nFollowing the election of the Fraser government in 1975, the new Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Ian Viner, established an inquiry into the role of the NACC. Reporting in 1976, the inquiry found that the NACC was restricted in its role due to the lack of clarity given by the previous government about its aims and functions and the desire of the NACC to be more than purely a consultative body.[11] As a result, the NACC was effectively abolished, and the NAC was created in 1977, with the first elections held in November of that year.\n\nStructure\n\nThe NAC was created as a government consultative body comprising 35 full-time salaried members. The NAC had state branches and territory branches and a national executive of 10 members. The Executive represented these branches and was chosen by the branch representatives rather than a broader national membership. An annual meeting of interested Indigenous constituents was held, to ensure that the elected representatives might be accountable to their constituents. None of the three tiers of the organisation were bound by any decisions of the others. Ultimately, the organisation was a further entrenchment of the government view that a national Indigenous representative body should be merely consultative in nature, without executive authority or guaranteed ministerial access.\n\nAutonomy, Resilience and Vulnerability\n\nThe NAC, like the NACC, was unable to consistently develop coherent national policy positions on matters of national importance in Indigenous affairs. Successful positioning was often based on the efforts of particular executive members, a state/territory branch or other Indigenous organisations who were members of the NAC.\n\nThe structure of the organisation as created by government also led to what has been characterised as an inherently cautious organisation.[12] This was partly based on the fact that the government’s intention that the organisation not be controlled or heavily influenced by urban activists succeeded in limiting the voice of that constituency in the NAC. Tensions between the NAC and the bureaucracy remained as a legacy of the DAA’s relationship with the NACC, contributing to the destabilisation of the organisation.\n\nTwo reports into a replacement structure for the NAC were commissioned following the election of the Hawke government in 1983. The O’Donoghue report concluded that the NAC produced “politicians” rather than advisors, had not adequately represented the diversity of Indigenous interests and had not realised coherent policy positions. Further, the body was unable to work with other Indigenous organisations or government departments.[13] The report recommended that a more regionalised organisation be created to give greater voice to the broader Indigenous constituency.\n\nThe other report, the 1984 Coombs report, suggested that a new organisation be based on regional representative structures and that it make provisions for the representation of existing Indigenous organisations. The Coombs report suggested that a new body should have significant responsibility over Indigenous expenditure.[14]\n\n3) The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), 1989 - 2005\n\nATSIC was established following the Coombs and O’Donoghue reports on the principle that the new organisation should be built around regional mechanisms. In 1986 the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Gerry Hand, recommended that a new organisation replace the NAC. Following the introduction of enabling legislation, major consultations were conducted with the Indigenous community. This significantly changed the basis of the legislation and greatly regionalised its structure. The new organisation, ATSIC, was ultimately created in 1989 and began operation in 1990.\n\nStructure\n\nThe ultimate structure of ATSIC resulted from various political compromises which were required to ensure the realisation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (Cth). The Bill was significantly amended to address concerns from the Opposition and minor parties that ATSIC was not adequately accountable, either administratively or financially, to the public or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.[15]\n\nAs a consequence, the Minister remained at the top of the legislative structure, and retained significant power over decisions made by elected representatives. Consequently, there were inevitable tensions between ATSIC’s responsibilities to the Minister and its duties to Indigenous constituents. The organisation was given a broad mandate to formulate and implement programs for Indigenous peoples and to monitor the effectiveness of its own and other nominated programs.\n\nFurther, ATSIC was empowered to develop policy proposals at all levels, to advise the Minister on all matters and to undertake research necessary to enable it to perform its functions. The Commission controlled and managed a budget to create and implement programs. For the first time, a national Indigenous representative body had the power to both advise government and to fund and deliver programs.\n\nAlong with establishing unique functions, the Parliament created a unique organisational structure to deliver ATSIC’s mandate. Central to this structure was a separation of power between elected representative and administrative arms.\n\nThe elected representative arm consisted of regional councils grouped into regional zones – including, for the first time, Torres Strait Islanders. In each zone, regional councillors would elect one of their own members to the national Board of Commissioners. The Board was legally responsible for determining financial priorities, developing budget estimates and reports, and ensuring the organisation acted in accordance with its powers.\n\nRegional Councils were given the power to formulate a regional plan for the improvement of the economic, cultural and social status of Indigenous peoples and to assist ATSIC and other bodies in its implementation. In addition, regional councils were tasked to prepare budgets for approval by the central organisation, and to act as a local advocate for the views of regional communities.\n\nThe administrative arm was staffed by public servants and was given the task of implementing the policy and program priorities determined by the elected representatives.\n\nAs the created structure was untested for a statutory authority, the legislation that created ATSIC was subject to regular review.\n\nATSIC was given the power to review the operation of its own legislation and make recommendations for its amendment. Two reviews conducted in 1993 and 1998 raised somewhat similar concerns. Firstly, both highlighted shortfalls in the legislation itself, stating that while an object of the legislation was to coordinate the formulation and implementation of policies, ATSIC did not have the power to act in a specific co-ordinating role, or enforce the cooperation of the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments.[16]\n\nSecondly, the reviews aimed to provide less onerous funding arrangements between ATSIC and State and Territory governments[17] and increase government accountability through an annual monitoring and reporting function for ATSIC.[18]\n\nUnfortunately the majority of recommendations emanating from these reviews were never implemented.\n\nThe Howard Government announced the first comprehensive external review of ATSIC in November 2002. In April 2003, it further announced a separation of powers between ATSIC’s policy making and service delivery roles as an interim measure to remove the potential for conflicts of interest in decision-making over funding. ATSIC was subsequently stripped of all resources and funding superfluous to administrative requirements ostensibly to free its elected arm to focus on larger policy issues and these were transferred to a new body, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Services (ATSIS).\n\nThe Hannaford review produced its Report in November 2003. Among its terms of reference was consideration of the adequacy of representation and advocacy of Indigenous views, the role of Regional Councils in service and program delivery, and the establishment of a Ministerial veto power over ATSIC’s decisions.\n\nAfter wide national consultation the final Report, titled In the hands of the regions, recommended urgent structural reform enabling greater regional control and a permanent division of ATSIC’s administrative and elected representative roles (to be achieved through a single body - i.e. by reunifying ATSIS and ATSIC). The national body would then become responsible primarily for developing policy and reviewing a national plan, informed by regional plans and specifically-tasked national committees.\n\nThe review team also recommended that ATSIC be given greater ability to develop more effective relationships with State and Territory governments through multilateral agreements.[19]\n\nThe then Minister for Indigenous Affairs pledged to consider the issues which were raised in the Report and deliver a reform package in 2005. Before any of these recommendations could be considered, let alone implemented, the organisation was abolished.\n\nAn overview of the findings of the Hannaford review of ATSIC is contained in Text Box 2 below.\n\nText Box 2 – Overview of key findings and recommendations of the Hannaford review of ATSIC (2003)\n\nAutonomy, Resilience and Vulnerability\n\nSince the demise of ATSIC, there has been much analysis of the problems experienced by the organisation and the weaknesses of its legislatively determined framework. Four organisational structural issues were identified:\n\nFirstly, there was confusion surrounding ATSIC’s broad powers and functions.\n\nSecondly, tension existed between policy development and program delivery.\n\nThirdly, the relationship between regional councils, the Board of Commissioners and the bureaucracy required clearer definition.\n\nFourthly, the Parliament failed to define the relationship between ATSIC and the different governments, or grant ATSIC the power to hold these governments accountable.\n\ni) Clarity about powers and functions\n\nWhile ATSIC was given a broad mandate, it did not capitalise on its functions and was simultaneously blamed for problems that were the responsibility of other agencies.\n\nATSIC’s function of monitoring the effectiveness of programs required the “active cooperation and involvement” of Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, who remained the major Indigenous service providers.[20] The legislation that established ATSIC was silent on how this relationship was to be developed and failed to provide ATSIC with executive authority to require effective cooperation.\n\nInstead, public confusion existed, often fuelled by political rhetoric, about the nature and scope of the organisation’s powers. The Howard government often blamed the organisation for failing to make major progress in ending Indigenous disadvantage, even though ATSIC administered less than 50% of Indigenous-specific Commonwealth funding.[21] Clearer legislative provisions to give fuller expression as to how ATSIC was to realistically achieve its mandate were required.\n\nii) Tension between policy development and program delivery\n\nConfusion about ATSIC’s broad mandate led to a disproportionate focus on program delivery. As the organisation developed, it became increasingly difficult for it to negotiate its dual policy and program roles. Eventually, program delivery became the focus at the expense of policy development. As a result, the organisation became hostage to government grants and funding cycles, increasing financial accountability and constant cycles of reporting, audit and evaluation.[22]\n\nThis occurred at the expense of policy development that could have actually informed governments as how to better run the majority of Indigenous programs. This effectively led to a failure to hold government accountable for program delivery.[23]\n\nThe desired effective relationship transformed instead into one between the government as ‘funder’ and ATSIC as the ‘contracted service provider’.[24] Under-resourcing of policy development led to a lack of Indigenous participation in government policy and program development. In 2003, the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock, split the administrative and funding arm from the representative arm of ATSIC in an attempt to resolve this problem. The abolition of ATSIC occurred soon after, so there was no effective evaluation of this separation.\n\niii) Relationship between regional councils, the Board and the bureaucracy\n\nWhile it prescribed broad functions, the legislation governing ATSIC failed to define key relationships, leading to tension and conflict between these three key stakeholders. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ATSIC was directly accountable to both the Board and the Minister. This limited the ability of the bureaucracy to support conflicting agendas between the Board and the government. Recommendations to change the structure of the organisation to allow the Board to appoint the CEO were ignored.\n\nAlso, while the Act established the respective functions of the Board of Commissioners and the regional councils, it was to a large extent silent on the interrelationship between the two. While regional councils were given the capacity to advise on national funding priorities, in practical terms they became focused on program management.[25] Instead, a top-down approach resulted regarding funding decisions and policy development, resulting inevitably in the centralisation of power in the national organisation.[26] Indigenous peoples were therefore less able to affect the processes of the organisation.\n\niv) Relationship with governments\n\nATSIC was further incapacitated by having limited power to compel the Commonwealth, State or Territory governments to act on its policy advice. While the organisation was given the task of monitoring the effectiveness of Indigenous programs, ATSIC had no executive authority to persuade governments to cooperate with its scrutiny. As the organisation focused on program delivery, various governments were able to escape criticisms about their own unproductive Indigenous policies and programs.[27]\n\nThis was especially the case for State and Territory governments, who remained responsible for the majority of Indigenous expenditure. The Commonwealth government had the ongoing problem of holding other governments accountable for tied grants, leaving ATSIC unable to track government expenditure on Indigenous programs and forcing them to attempt to plug the gaps in State and Territory services through the capacity of the regional councils.[28]\n\nIn a sense this relieved the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments from as stringent accountability as ATSIC necessarily focused more on program delivery. Consequently, ATSIC was hampered in its ability to contribute to long-term policy debate or innovative policy development.\n\nATSIC’s focus on program delivery meant it could not contribute adequately to government policy formulation. Although ATSIC had a monitoring function, the organisation had no coercive power to hold governments accountable or guarantee that they would act on their advice. Consequently, various levels of government and within government acted without Indigenous involvement and were able to escape criticism for their own shortcomings in Indigenous affairs.\n\nLessons learnt from previously existing National Indigenous Representative Bodies\n\nThe strengths and shortcomings of previous representative organisations created by government are complex and depend often on the political and social environment of the nation at any given time. However, there are some key and recurring factors as to why representative bodies have not been sustainable and have been hampered in their effective operation – often despite major investments by individuals, groups and Boards.\n\nFirstly, there has been a recurrent failure to adequately define the key relationships between governments, the representative body and other stakeholders in Indigenous affairs. In this regard there was a lack of clarity in the relationships between national representative bodies and State and Territory governmental structures. There were also inadequate links and processes between the national body and other regional structures and processes.\n\nSecondly, there has been a failure to clearly articulate and detail the functions of the representative body in accordance with the stated aspirations of Indigenous Australians. This has manifested as incoherent organisational structures that were unable to meet the multiple objectives of a representative body. There was a lack of clarity both internally within bodies and externally on the roles and functions of the body, and hence there arose competing and unmet expectations of representative bodies. This caused problems particularly where the representative body was not provided the authority and resources to fully undertake functions such as program delivery, but was nonetheless expected to fulfil these functions. There were also tensions that arose from having a single body being responsible for advocacy, policy development, program delivery and evaluation – which created conflicting responsibilities. The lack of clarity was accompanied by inadequate resourcing that limited the capacity of a representative body to fulfil its multiple objectives.\n\nThirdly, past representative bodies have also been plagued by tensions arising from the need to represent a diversity of Indigenous interests, including interests of both urban and rural/ remote communities as well as interests of specific members of the community including, Indigenous women and youth.\n\nFinally, each organisation has to varying degrees been constrained by government and the bureaucracy in pursuing their own priorities as galvanised from the wishes of its Indigenous constituents. Underlying this has been a lack of government support for a strong independent agenda setting policy organisation, as opposed to a mere advisory body. Therefore, each organisation has been unable to act with sufficient independence from government, a core and repeatedly asserted desire of Indigenous peoples throughout Australia.\n\nThese lessons learned from previous mechanisms for national Indigenous representation can help identify what issues need to be discussed when considering the scope of a new National Indigenous Representative Body, particularly in relation to the roles and functions of the body, its level of independence and its relationships with government at the national, State/ Territory and regional levels.\n\nTo assist in clarifying these issues, this paper reproduces at Text Box 2 the proposed principles and vision for a representative body as articulated by the 2003 Hannaford Review of ATSIC. Due to the abolition of ATSIC there was not an opportunity at the time to consider the usefulness of these principles assisting to define the key features of a new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nSection 2: Current mechanisms for representing Indigenous peoples at the national, State/ Territory and regional levels\n\nDespite the absence of a National Indigenous Representative Body, there exists a range of organisations that advocate for the interests of Indigenous peoples. This includes through:\n\nan extensive array of national peak bodies that represent the different sectoral interests of Indigenous service delivery organisations;\n\nland councils, native title representative bodies and prescribed bodies corporate established through the native title and land rights and native title systems;\n\nregional mechanisms for representing Indigenous people that exist in some parts of the country; and\n\nmechanisms established by State or Territory governments to represent Indigenous peoples in policy making processes.\n\nSome of these organisations or mechanisms are representative of different communities or sectors of Indigenous peoples, whereas others base their advocacy on their service delivery role.\n\nThis section of the paper identifies the key features of a range of different organisations and mechanisms that currently exist across Australia. While none of these organisations or mechanisms is capable of addressing the sheer breadth of issues required from a National Indigenous Representative Body, they do provide a substantial base on which to build.\n\nEach of these organisations or mechanisms, therefore, has a role to play either in contributing to the operations of, or through their relationship with, a new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nThis section of the paper concludes by considering what issues are raised for the operation of a new National Indigenous Representative Body in light of these existing mechanisms, as well as in relation to the post-ATSIC arrangements for delivery of services to Indigenous peoples at the federal level, which have substantially changed the operating landscape for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nAny National Indigenous Representative Body will need to be alert to how it can effectively work with the regional and State/ Territory representative bodies, and the current administration arrangements in place for Indigenous affairs.\n\nNational Indigenous Peak Bodies\n\nThere exists an extensive array of national Indigenous peak bodies. A critical issue in the development of a new National Indigenous Representative Body will be deciding how these peak bodies will interact and inform the work and decision making of the new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nGenerally speaking, existing Indigenous peak bodies represent the different sectoral interests of Indigenous service delivery organisations. In other words, they deal with a particular professional area or service delivery role. This differentiates the role of these peak bodies from those of a National Indigenous Representative Body. The National Body would need to consider all different perspectives in developing a clear vision of how to advance the overall wellbeing and priorities for indigenous peoples at a national level.\n\nMany of these peak bodies are also elected, some with direct representation from the community level. Peak Indigenous bodies offer significant expertise and experience that should be drawn on by the new National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nText Box 3 below provides an overview of a number of existing national Indigenous peak bodies and how they are constituted.[29]\n\nText Box 3 – Overview of existing National Indigenous Peak Bodies\n\nLand Councils and Native Title Representative Bodies\n\nNationwide, there are 17 Native Title Representative Bodies (NTRBs) and Native Title Services (NTSs), established under the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth). NTSs do not have a representative role. Many NTRBs emerged out of local ‘land councils’, which were established under State and Territory land rights legislation which predated the native title system. Many of these land councils have a long history of representing Indigenous interests at a regional or State/Territory-wide level.\n\nThe first land councils were established in the Northern Territory under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 (Cth) with a range of responsibilities to run land claims and manage existing land trusts by taking instruction from traditional owners on development issues. Since the introduction of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth), these land councils effectively operate under two statutes and as a result have two sets of operational responsibilities.\n\nNew South Wales also has a land rights system, which is established under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1983 (NSW). The NSW Aboriginal Land Council network operates as a two –tiered structure, comprising the peak statutory authority – the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (NSWALC) – and 121 Local Aboriginal Land Councils (LALCs). The objectives of both NSWALC and the LALCs is generally to “improve, protect and foster the best interests of Aboriginal persons” within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nBoth the NSWALC and LALCs are governed by elected Boards. The 9 Councillors that make up the NSWALC Board are elected to represent each of the regions that the 121 LALCs are grouped into across the state.\n\nAlthough native title advocacy, agreements, claims and determinations are a central focus of NTRBs, NTSs and land councils under State and Territory land rights legislation, these bodies increasingly undertake roles in related areas of land management, community development and employment and training programs. Land management units have developed into significant resource centres receiving support from a range of government and non-government agencies to run programs from ranger groups to Indigenous ecological knowledge maintenance.\n\nThe range of support services and programs, their structure and election procedures and the increased regionalisation of some land councils or NTRBs have contributed to imbuing these institutions with some degree of representativeness for Indigenous communities in certain parts of Australia.\n\nHowever, their legitimacy, authority, resources and effectiveness is not uniform. They are usually governed by a membership that has achieved land rights grants, or has achieved or asserts native title. They are not usually representative of those Indigenous groups that cannot demonstrate traditional ownership of areas covered by the land council or NTRB, nor do they always have close ties to existing Indigenous community service organisations. They are, nevertheless, important bodies in the wider landscape of Indigenous representation, particularly at the local and regional level.\n\nThere are a further range of organisations that are beginning to operate through the native title system. These are Prescribed Bodies Corporate (PBC). The prime object of prescribed bodies corporate is to hold the native title rights and interests granted by a determination of native title on trust or as an agent for native title holders. Once the determination is made a PBC is then registered on the National Native Title Register as a Registered Native Title Body Corporate (RNTBC). The primary roles of PBCs are to:\n\nProtect and manage determined native title, in accordance with the native title holders’ wishes; and\n\nProvide a legal entity through which native title holders can conduct business with government, and others, interested in accessing or regulating native title lands and waters.\n\nAs at 30 June 2008, there were 57 RNTBCs, and 12 determinations of native title currently awaiting determination to become Registered Native Title Body Corporates. While funding support is limited for such bodies, and they are differently constituted, they are emerging as a new organisational structure that has representative responsibilities in relation to traditional owners who have had their native title recognised.\n\nThere are a further 12 determinations of native title currently awaiting determination of a Prescribed Body Corporate, to become the Registered Native Title Body Corporate.\n\nRegional Authorities – Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA)\n\nThe Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA) began as an ATSIC Regional Council in 1990 and became an independent statutory authority by amendment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (Cth) in 1994.\n\nIt consists of two parts: a Board of 20 Indigenous elected members resident in the region and an Administration staffed by Australian government public servants headed by a General Manager appointed by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs.\n\nThe Board includes 18 representatives from the island communities of the Torres Strait plus two more elected under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 (Cth), that replaced the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (Cth). Considered to be the political arm of the TSRA, the Board determines budget allocations and policy, sometimes within the parameters of portfolios.\n\nUnified regional Indigenous governance structures have existed in the Torres Strait for decades.[30] The TSRA is currently the principal Commonwealth agency co-ordinating Indigenous affairs in the region. Its predecessor was the Torres Strait Regional Council (TSRC) that existed in the late 1980s, and which drew its membership predominantly from another regional representative Islander body, the Island Co-ordinating Council[31] (ICC). The councils have powerful responsibilities under the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 (Qld) which establishes 17 Island Councils and the Local Government Act 1993 (Qld) which establishes the Torres Shire Council, both of which come together in the Island Coordinating Council (ICC).\n\nAs well as being responsible for formulating, administering and monitoring the effectiveness of programs to individuals, councils and community organisations in key development areas (such as economic, employment and training, housing and environmental, social and cultural, policy co-ordination), the TSRA is the regional representative body for native title and land and sea management. It advises the Minister for Indigenous Affairs on matters relating to Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal Affairs in the Torres Strait.\n\nThe TSRA therefore combines representative, policy-making and administrative elements within the one body.\n\nThe current functions of the TSRA include:\n\nRecognising and maintaining the special and unique Ailan Kastom of Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait;\n\nFormulating and developing programs for Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal people living in the Torres Strait, and monitoring the effectiveness of its own and other bodies’ programs for them in the region;\n\nDeveloping policy proposals to meet their national, State/ Territory and regional needs and priorities;\n\nAssisting, advising and cooperating with their communities, organisations and individuals at these levels;\n\nAdvising the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs on matters related to Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal affairs in the area;\n\nTaking necessary action to protect sacred or significant Torres Strait Islander or Aboriginal cultural material and information; and\n\nCollecting and publishing statistical information as requested by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Act 2005 (Cth) s142A).\n\nElections are held every four years. While voting is open to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents, there are fewer of the latter in most island communities. All prospective candidates must, inter alia, reside for at least two years prior to an election within the ward they wish to represent and be Indigenous peoples. It should be noted that Torres Strait Islanders living in the Torres Strait are outnumbered by those resident on mainland Australia, who nonetheless share a “common sense of history and identity”.[32]\n\nChairs of Community Councils contribute 17 Board members. One elected ICC member represents five constituencies on Thursday Island on the Board (Tamwoy, Rosehill, Aplin, Waiben and Quarantine [TRAWQ]) and the remaining two members represent Port Kennedy (Thursday Island), as well as Horn and Prince of Wales Islands.\n\nThe Queensland government is currently amalgamating the Islander Councils into a single local government structure with the existing jurisdictions becoming the responsibility of Community Boards.[33]\n\nRegional Indigenous representative arrangements post-ATSIC (2005 - current)\n\nFollowing the abolition of ATSIC, the then Commonwealth government committed to the establishment of regional arrangements for the representation of Indigenous peoples. This was to be based on the negotiation of Regional Partnership Agreements (RPAs) and Shared Responsibility Agreements (SRAs) with Indigenous communities, families or clans. The government had also committed to supporting the development of regional Indigenous representative structures in the place of ATSIC Regional Councils.\n\nIn 2005, consultations were undertaken nationally with Indigenous peoples on the type of representative structures that should be supported in each region. The outcomes of these consultations are discussed in the Social Justice Report 2005.[34] It reveals a mix of different models that were proposed by Indigenous communities.\n\nSince 2005 however, only two such regional representative structures have been supported through the signing of RPAs or SRAs. These are:\n\nthe Ngaanyatjarra Council in Western Australia; and\n\nthe Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly in Northern New South Wales.\n\nThe Social Justice Commissioner has identified the absence of regional representative arrangements (with the exception of these two arrangements) as the most significant problem with the operation of the post-ATSIC arrangements for Indigenous affairs. In the Social Justice Report 2006 he stated:\n\nPolicy is being developed in a vacuum at the national level, with no connection to Indigenous experiences at the local and regional level ... what this ... demonstrate(s) is the lack of coherence between the different levels of service delivery and policy...\n\nIn practice the new arrangements are a top down imposition – with policy set centrally and unilaterally by government, confirmed in bilateral processes with State and Territory governments (again without Indigenous input) and then applied to Indigenous peoples. The absence of regional mechanisms for engagement with Indigenous peoples is a critical problem...[&][35]\n\na) Ngaanyatjarra Regional Partnership Agreemen[t]\n\nThe Ngaanyatjarra Regional Partnership Agreement (RPA) in Western Australia was signed on 12 August 2005.[36] The agreement relates to 12 discrete communities of the Ngaanyatjarra lands. It sets out strategic approaches and projects for joint action by government and the Ngaanyatjarra Council, a community organisation, in partnership with Ngaanyatjarra people and communities. The term of the RPA is until 30 June 2008.\n\nThe RPA is a statement of mutual intentions but does not create any legally binding obligations. The parties to the agreement are the Australian government, the Western Australian government, the Ngaanyatjarra Council and the Shire of Ngaanyatarraku.\n\nThe objectives of the RPA include:\n\nEstablishing partnerships and sharing responsibility for achieving measurable and sustainable improvements for people living in Ngaanyatjarra lands;\n\nProviding better coordinated and resourced programs and services to achieve improvements in priority areas;\n\nEstablishing mainstream programs and improving access to them;\n\nReducing inefficiencies; and\n\nDeveloping a Strategic Investment Plan for the region.\n\nThe Ngaanyatjarra principles that underlie the agreement include:\n\nrecognising existing capabilities and capacity;\n\nmaintaining control of Ngaanyatjarra affairs;\n\nrecognising the role of the Ngaanyatjarra Council and its capacity to drive planning and negotiation;\n\nmaintaining and strengthening traditional Ngaanyatjarra cultural and social values and connection to land;\n\nrecognising need for change and innovation to improve living conditions;\n\nwishing to live in communities on traditional country that have the best achievable standard of living and healthy and safe environment;\n\nsecuring core infrastructure funding and developing all participating communities; and\n\nsupporting an education system that provides children with relevant and useful mainstream education while also reinforcing culture.\n\nThe representation structures allowed for the Ngaanyatjarra Council to represent and consult those communities in the area that wished to be represented by the council, and facilitate the development of SRAs. The government agreed to support the Council in its representative role by actively engaging with the council and funding it to fulfil its role, and agreeing not to establish another representative arrangement for communities that have endorsed the council’s representative status.\n\nThe intended outcomes of the RPA included improved regional capacity; establishment of structures to manage the RPA (i.e. Regional Partnership Committee and Agreement Coordinators Group to monitor and develop the partnership), reduced red tape, and development and implementation of the Ngaanyatjarra Strategic Investment Plan (20-30 year vision). Progress for the RPA is to be monitored by all parties in accordance with agreed timeframes and indicators.\n\nb) Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly\n\nThe Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly (MPRA) is the regional governance and engagement forum for 16 communities in the northwest region of New South Wales. It operates in the same geographic region as the previous ATSIC Murdi Paaki Regional Council. The Murdi Paaki region in NSW was also one of eight COAG whole of government trial sites since 2002.\n\nCommunity working parties (CWPs) exist in each of the 16 member communities. The CWPs operate under a Charter and Code of Conduct and have developed individual Community Action Plans.\n\nOn 22 August 2003, Murdi Paaki entered its first SRA with the Australian and NSW governments. Under the Agreement, the ATSIC Murdi Paaki Regional Council was acknowledged as the peak regional body and primary point of Indigenous community contact. The Murdi Paaki Community Working Parties (Working Parties) are acknowledged as the peak community bodies and primary points of Indigenous community contact in each community across the region.\n\nThe Agreement incorporates the regional priorities identified by the community and establishes the responsibilities of all parties. Within Regional Priorities, specific priorities and agreed outcomes for each community in the region were agreed to be detailed in separate Shared Responsibility Agreements between the Community Working Parties and the governments.\n\nA subsequent agreement has been reached recognising the Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly as the principal regional Indigenous governance body (replacing the ATSIC Murdi Paaki Regional Council).\n\nThe MPRA has currently entered into six regional agreements and 12 SRAs with the government.\n\nThe Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly finalised a Regional Plan in 2006. This plan has used as its foundation the 16 Community Action Plans, and previous planning documents developed by the Murdi Paaki Regional Council.\n\nThe Plan identifies 10 key areas where the Regional Assembly can enable initiatives, through its influence and representation of the Murdi Paaki region. They are: community governance, economic development, employment and enterprise development, housing and infrastructure, young people, health, law and justice, families, education and culture and well-being.\n\nThe Murdi Paaki Regional Assembly has stated that its’ Chair and members will use the Plan to:\n\nConvey community priorities as gathered and developed from the sixteen CWP’s Community Action Plans at the regional level. This plan will be used to coordinate partnership and funding initiatives from government agencies and non-government service providers that will benefit all communities. The Regional Plan will also be used by the Regional Assembly to influence the development of policies and programs that affect Indigenous peoples within the region.[37]\n\nc) Post-ATSIC regional representation for Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland\n\nIn the 2006 census count there were 29,515 Torres Strait Islanders and 17,813 persons of both Torres Strait islander and Aboriginal origin in Australia - a total of 47,328 people. Of this only 15% were living in the Torres Strait. Of the remaining proportion of Torres Strait Islanders who live on the mainland, 61% lived in Queensland.[38]\n\nThe needs and interests of Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland are distinct from those living in the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait Regional Authority represents the interests of those living in the Torres Strait Islander region (see the discussion of this regional authority above - ‘Regional Authorities - Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA)’). Under ATSIC the interests of Torres Strait Islanders living on the mainland were represented through the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board (TSIAB). The TSIAB was responsible for advising the Government on issues specific to Torres Strait Islanders on the mainland.\n\nWith the abolishment of ATSIC, the TSIAB was also abolished and the needs of mainland Torres Strait Islanders were expected to be met through the new federal service delivery arrangements. This included mainland Torres Strait Islanders interests being addressed by the local Indigenous Coordination Centres (ICCs) through Shared Responsibility Agreements (SRAs) and other arrangements. The Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination (OIPC) absorbed the Office of Torres Strait Islander Affairs, but continued to fund the National Secretariat of Torres Strait Islander Organisations Limited (NSTSIOL), to represent mainland Torres Strait Islanders in dealings with government departments, statutory corporations and the Aboriginal community.\n\nThe removal of distinct representative bodies for mainland Torres Strait Islanders has meant that the under-representation of their interests in the delivery of government programs and, policies and services has continued if not increased. Since 2004 the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner has sought to assess the adequacy of arrangements for the participation and representation of mainland Torres Strait Islanders. In the Social Justice Report 2005, the Commissioner noted that with the abolition of TSIAB the participation of mainland Torres Strait Islanders was no longer assured.[39] The Commissioner reported that very few Torres Strait Island Corporations on the mainland had been involved in the new arrangements for service delivery, and that the bodies responsible for implementing them, namely the ICCs, had very limited understanding of the specific contexts and needs of mainland Torres Strait Islanders.[40]\n\nThere is no indication that there have been any improvements to this situation more recently. There have been no SRAs or RPAs signed with mainland Torre Strait Islander Communities.\n\nThis situation of the mainland Torres Strait Islanders highlights the need for diversity in Indigenous representative bodies. It demonstrates that, particularly at the regional level, all Indigenous groups cannot be homogenised into a single representative body, but require distinct representative arrangements.\n\nState and Territory Government representative arrangements, post-ATSIC (2005 – current)\n\nFollowing the abolition of ATSIC, several States and Territories sought to develop replacement regional models for Indigenous representation.[41] The Western Australia and New South Wales governments both convened forums and embarked upon consultations with Indigenous peoples to identify options for representative bodies.[42]\n\nOne example of an advanced regional model was the Kulari model of regional governance in the Kimberley region of WA. Involving three tiers of governance with an over-arching council, it involved the retention of the then-existing ATSIC Regional Councils. It included a level of community working parties to enable access, participation and capacity building at the grass roots level.[43]\n\nThe NSW Government discussed options at the Our Future Our Voice Summit in 2004, on three models including a regional assembly model (based on the Murdi Paaki model), the Coalition of peak Aboriginal Bodies (building on existing organisations) and the Combined ATSIC/ Land Council model (where local land councils input to regional councils, which in turn input to State land councils).[44]\n\nThe Northern Territory government considered a model of Regional Authorities under the ‘Overarching Agreement on Indigenous Affairs between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Northern Territory of Australia 2005-2010’, and the ‘Building Stronger Regions – Stronger Futures Strategy.’ This latter strategy was the first step in the current process of amalgamating existing community councils that is underway in the Northern Territory.[45]\n\nIn 2005 Victoria established the Premier’s Aboriginal Advisory Council (PAAC), chaired by the Premier. Secretariat support for the PAAC is provided by Aboriginal Affairs Victoria. PAAC provides advice to the Government on strategic issues in Indigenous policy, and acts as a forum for Indigenous community perspectives to inform government direction and processes.\n\nPAAC supplements existing Indigenous consultative arrangements in other portfolios and broad-based community consultations on specific initiatives.[46]\n\nThe South Australian government established an interim Aboriginal Advisory Council with the role to oversee the application of the ‘Doing it Right’ policy framework and report to the Premier. Members include the Minister, representatives from ATSIC State Council, leaders of land councils, other Aboriginal peak bodies and community leaders.[47]\n\nIn 2008, following the recommendations of this Advisory Council, the government appointed a Commissioner for Aboriginal Engagement, Mr Klynton Wanganeen, and established a permanent South Australian Aboriginal Advisory Council.\n\nThe Commissioner is a point of contact for Aboriginal people to express their concerns, which the Commissioner will identify to the government and work towards having resolved.\n\nThe new permanent Advisory Council will provide the government with advice on existing programs and policies and help shape future policies and services relating to Aboriginal people, ensuring that Aboriginal views are part of government policy-making. The Council will have ten members each appointed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation for a term of two years.[48]\n\nThe Australian Capital Territory government announced the establishment of an elected representative body for Indigenous peoples in May 2008. Elections have now been held and seven members appointed for a three year term to advise the ACT government on Indigenous issues. Details of this new representative body are provided in Text Box 4 below.\n\nText Box 4 – ACT Government’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elected Body (ATSIEB) - 2008[49]\n\nThe ‘new arrangements’ for the administration of Indigenous affairs at the federal level post-ATSIC (2005- current)\n\nIn the wake of the abolition of ATSIC and ATSIS in 2005, the federal government introduced a series of reforms to the administration of Indigenous Affairs[.] These reforms are documented and analysed at length in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner’s Social Justice Report for 2004, 2005 and 2006.\n\nThese arrangements, which continue today, have substantially changed the operating landscape in which any National Indigenous Representative Body will operate.\n\nUnder these new arrangements, policy and service delivery at the federal level is the responsibility of mainstream government departments. All Indigenous specific programs have been retained and sit alongside mainstream programs within these departments.\n\nThere have also been a range of mechanisms established within government aimed at delivering a more coordinated, holistic or ‘whole of government’ response to Indigenous affairs. These include the establishment of:\n\nA Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs that is chaired by the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, and involves Ministers with relevant portfolios across the government. Its purpose is to provide high level direction to the Australian government on Indigenous affairs as well as reporting to Cabinet on policy and expenditure.\n\nA Secretaries Group on Indigenous Affairs that is composed of the heads of Australian government departments, chaired by the Secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet, and which provides support to the Ministerial Taskforce and reports annually on performance across the whole of the federal government on Indigenous affairs.\n\nA National Indigenous Council (NIC) that was an appointed council of Indigenous experts to advise the Ministerial Taskforce on policy program and service delivery issues. The NIC’s status as a hand-picked body with no ability to independently consult with Indigenous people meant that it enjoyed very little credibility with Indigenous people. Its mandate expired in December 2007, when the new government decided not to continue with it.\n\nAn Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination (OIPC) that coordinates government policy development and service delivery in Indigenous affairs, across the whole of government.\n\nA network of regional Indigenous Coordination Centres (ICC) that co-locate staff across federal government departments in regional offices to coordinate whole of government responses to Indigenous issues on a regional level. The location of these offices is in the same regions that had been adopted by the ATSIC Regional Councils.\n\nA ‘Single Budget Submission for Indigenous Affairs’ whereby all items relating to Indigenous affairs are considered by the Ministerial Taskforce in a single budget document to promote integrated whole of government activities and allocation of funding.[50]\n\nPolicy development is guided by a national framework of principles for government service delivery to Indigenous peoples agreed by the Councils of Australian Governments (COAG). Since 2005, there have been a series of commitments made by COAG that guide Indigenous affairs. Most notably, in 2007 COAG adopted a series of targets to close the gap in Indigenous disadvantage and agreed to a reform agenda through COAG.\n\nThe COAG commitments and new arrangements at the federal level were also reflected in bilateral agreements between the federal Government and State and Territory governments.\n\nIt is notable that in the absence of a National Indigenous Representative Body, the commitments through COAG and bilateral agreements that set the basis for the relationship between governments and policy directions for Indigenous affairs, have been made without any Indigenous participation or consultation. Indigenous representative structures at all levels are needed to partner governments in planning and determining appropriate service delivery arrangements.\n\nLessons learnt from existing mechanisms for representing Indigenous peoples at the national, State, Territory and regional levels\n\nThe range of national, State/ Territory, and regional level outlined above demonstrate that a diversity of Indigenous representative bodies is currently in existence in Australia. However, none of these bodies or the combination of them can adequately provide the comprehensive representation that would be met by a National Indigenous Representative Body.\n\nEach category of bodies illustrates strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to representation that can be usefully drawn upon in developing a new National Indigenous Representative Body. This includes understanding how the different models are structured, what functions they fulfil, how their membership is constituted, and the processes for electing the representative body.\n\nThe national peak Indigenous bodies commonly represent different sectoral interests of Indigenous service delivery organisations. While some of them may have a role in representing the interests of their Indigenous membership, it is often restricted to the specific sector that they primarily work in. Within their relative areas of interest the peak bodies can be a valuable source of information and input. It will be important to consider how the new Representative Body can ensure these peak bodies will interact and inform the work and decision making of the new National Indigenous Representative Body. In terms of membership, it may be useful to consider if there should be a special category of membership for these bodies, particularly for those that are elected by an Indigenous membership.\n\nThe Land Councils and Native Title Representative Bodies are limited in their scope for representation as they only generally represent Indigenous groups that can demonstrate traditional ownership of areas covered by the land council or NTRB. They are, nevertheless, important bodies in the wider landscape of Indigenous representation, particularly at the local and regional level, particularly as a source of information and input.\n\nThe Torres Strait Regional Authority is a useful model to look to in terms of how to structure the membership and functions of a representative body. It also can be a guide on how to resolve the tensions of having multiple functions of representation, policy-making and administrative elements within the one body.\n\nImportantly, the new National Indigenous Representative Body will have to consider how to interface with this regional body in terms of ensuring Torres Strait Islander participation at the national level. It will also be important to consider how to separately include the representation of mainland Torres Strait Islanders in the national body.\n\nThe recent development of a representative group in the ACT and advisory committees, such as in South Australia and Victoria, are initiatives that have not existed previously, even during the era of ATSIC. There has been a lack of clarity in past national Indigenous representative bodies on their relationships with States and Territory bodies and mechanisms. It will be critical to ensure that consideration is given to how the new National Indigenous Representative Body will interface with these State/ Territory mechanisms.\n\nA National Indigenous Representative Body will also have to bear in mind the current administration mechanisms for Indigenous Affairs that were put in place post-ATSIC. These arrangements relate primarily to program delivery required to meet government commitments. A key feature of these arrangements is the devolution of service delivery to the regional level, through the ICCs and mechanisms such as the SRAs and RPAs. Another key feature of the new arrangements is the transfer of Indigenous specific programs to mainstream departments. A new National Indigenous Representative Body will have to consider structures for informing all mainstream departments on Indigenous Affairs.[51] It will be important for the new National Indigenous Representative Body to ensure that clear and consistent mechanisms are in place with the relevant bodies (i.e. COAG Ministerial Taskforce on Indigenous Affairs, Secretaries Group on Indigenous Affairs, the Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination and regional Indigenous Coordination Centres). This will be important for ensuring consistency between program delivery by these bodies and the work of the new National Indigenous Representative Body, particularly in terms of linking national policy development with regional level program implementation.\n\nA new National Indigenous Representative Body will have to determine how to effectively engage and link with these regional and State/ Territory representative bodies, to ensure complementary and supplementary relationships are established.\n\nSection 3: National Indigenous Representative Bodies in other countries – some comparisons\n\nThis section of the Issues Paper provides examples of Indigenous Representative Bodies that have been established internationally. These include:\n\nthe Assembly of First Nations (AFN) in Canada;\n\nthe National Congress of the American Indian (NCAI) of the USA;\n\nthe Sami Parliament of Sweden; and\n\nTe Puni Kōkiri (TPK) of New Zealand.\n\nThe perceived strengths and weaknesses of these different models are considered. The critical difference between the models is whether self-governance is aspired to and what ‘purchase’ or persuasiveness these structures have with government.\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians: United States of America\n\nThe National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) was founded in 1944 to facilitate unity and cooperation among tribal governments for the protection of their treaty and sovereign rights. It strives to inform the public and Congress on the governmental rights of American Indians and Alaska Natives. It now comprises 250 member tribes from throughout the United States. NCAI monitors federal policy and has input into federal decisions that affect tribal government interests.[52]\n\nThe NCAI provides a forum for policy development among tribal governments to:\n\n(1) Protect and advance tribal governance and treaty rights;\n\n(2) Promote economic development and health and welfare in Indian and Alaska Native communities; and\n\n(3) Educate the public toward a better understanding of Indian and Alaska Native tribes.[53]\n\nMembership is made up of tribes, organisations and individuals. It includes the Alaskan Native tribes.\n\nTribal members must be an identifiable group who have substantial numbers of their members living on the same reservation or general locality. They must maintain a unified tribal organisation which does not fission. They must be recognised as a tribe by the US Department of Interior, Court of Claims, the Indian Commission or a State.[54]\n\nAny individual with Indian ancestry is eligible for membership. Such individuals must be a member of a recognised tribe. Non-Indians may be admitted as non-voting associate members on payment of an annual fee. Organisations may also be admitted as members on the same terms. The Executive Director may confer membership to applicants, subject to review by the Executive Council.[55]\n\nThe NCAI is currently addressing a range of issues that range from:\n\nService programs for Indian families, targeting Indian Youth and elders;\n\nPromotion and support of Indian education;\n\nEnhancing health care, including reducing substance abuse and HIV-AIDS;\n\nSupport of environmental protection and natural resources management;\n\nProtection of Indian cultural resources and religious freedom Rights;\n\nPromotion of the Rights of Indian economic opportunity; and\n\nProtection of the Rights of Indian people to decent, safe and affordable housing.\n\nNature and Extent of Mandate and Decision-Making Authority\n\nThe supreme powers of the Congress reside with the members meeting in General Assembly. The General Assembly meeting of members may delegate its powers to the Executive and Officers of the NCAI.[56]\n\nThere are two official meetings of the Congress each year – the Annual Convention and the Mid-Year Conference.\n\nThe officers of the Congress are divided into two categories:\n\na) the Administrative Board Officers (ABO) which consists of the President, First Vice-President, Recording Secretary and Treasurer, and\n\nb) 12 Regional Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe Administrative Board officers are elected by secret ballot on nomination from the floor at the Annual Convention. The Regional Vice-Presidents are elected by regions (according to procedures established by each region) meeting in caucus at the Annual Convention at a time appointed after the election of the ABO members. Only tribal government officials or delegates in good membership standing can qualify for nomination, election or office in the Congress.[57]\n\nIndividual Indian members are entitled to one vote and tribal members are allocated between 100 to 180 votes according to size; e.g. tribes with up to 500 members get 100 votes while tribes consisting of more than 7500 members get 180 votes.[58] All officers are elected for two year terms and can only serve two consecutive terms.[59] Elections take place each odd numbered year.\n\nThe NCAI also has an Executive Council which comprises the Administrative Board Officers, the 12 Regional Vice-Presidents and one delegate from each member tribe. This Council meets once in annual conference although the Constitution does provide for additional meetings in certain circumstances.[60]\n\nThe powers of the Executive Council include administration of the organisation’s affairs under the Constitution, management of funds and bona fide contributions, to enable policies consistent with the Annual Convention.[61]\n\nThe NCAI also has an Executive Committee which comprises the Administrative Board Officers and the 12 Regional Vice-Presidents. It has power to employ the Executive Director and has the full authority to act for the Executive Council between meetings of the Council. This Committee reports in writing to the Council. The Executive Director is the administrative head of the Congress and is subject to the direction and policy set out by the Executive Committee.[62]\n\nThe President is authorised to appoint committees and sub-committees. Examples include:\n\nThe Human Resources Committees, which has various sub-committees including Education, Health, Indian Child and Family Welfare, and Elders;\n\nThe Litigation and Governance Committee which has sub-committees on Tribal Gaming and Taxation and Human Religious and Cultural concerns;\n\nThe Veterans Committee; and\n\nThe Rules and Credentials Committee.[63]\n\nThe NCAI has 250 member tribes and thousands of individual members from throughout the United States. There are said to be over 550 recognised tribes in the USA and this may impact on the Congress’ ability to provide broad representation.\n\nThe NCAI has developed a Policy Statement which provides direction on tribal sovereignty, treaty rights, federal trust responsibility, health, housing, education, environmental quality, and physical, spiritual, traditional, and cultural customs and practices.[64] These stem from the NCAI’s key objectives: respect for tribal governance and the federal trust relationship; support for healthy Native communities and people, and preservation of human dignity and cultural integrity.\n\nThe NCAI pursues these objectives as follows:\n\nRespect for tribal governance and the federal trust relationship: Effective USA and tribal government dialogue and consultation (including Alaskan Native tribal governments and Native Hawaiian rights); the exercise of tribal self-determination and governance; the acknowledgement of tribal sovereignty and receipt of adequate resources for Indian programs and land management.\n\nSupport for healthy Native communities and people: The development of appropriate, sustainable and diversified economies on Indian Land; training opportunities on reserves; accessible housing, transportation infrastructure and information technology; support for a tribally-driven health care system; commitment to Indian education; tribal law enforcement and sentencing; child protection; and development of tribal resources.\n\nPreservation of human dignity and cultural integrity: Ensuring the maintenance and transmission of practices and language; protecting Indian tangible and intangible cultural heritage; recognition of the wider rights of indigenous peoples; and the ending of racially discriminatory practices.\n\nRelationship with State governments\n\nWhen Indian lands were ceded to the United States the government’s ensuing legal commitment was codified in treaties, federal law, executive orders, judicial opinions, and international doctrine. Three general obligations were created by this:\n\nprotection of Indian trust lands;\n\nprotection of tribal self-governance; and\n\nprovision of basic social, medical, and educational services for tribal members.\n\nThe NCAI and the states through the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) have reached agreement on a State-Tribal Relations Project to promote cooperation between the tribal and state governments.\n\nThis Project acknowledges that States and Indian tribes have a broad range of common interests and shared responsibilities to use available public resources wisely and effectively. The Project aims to coordinate and realise the objectives of 50 state governments and 550 tribal governments with respect to education, health, economic development, law enforcement and cultural and environmental maintenance. It also aims to avoid state-tribal litigation due to jurisdictional disputes.[65]\n\nHow the Organisation is Funded\n\nThe NCAI is funded through annual membership dues. These dues are payable at the Annual Convention of each year for the following year until the next Annual Convention.\n\nAn individual voting member pays $40.00 and can pay $1,000.00 for life membership. Tribal membership dues are calculated according to the annual income of the tribal government. Those with less than $500,000 annual income are at the bottom of the dues scale and pay a membership of $110.00 per annum. Those at the top of the scale are those with an income of $30 million or more and they pay $25,000 per year. An individual associate member pays $40.00 whilst organisation Associates pay $500.00 annually.[66]\n\nMembers of the Executive Committee are not entitled to any salary, fees, remuneration gratuities or other form of compensation from the NCAI for serving on the committee.[67]\n\nThe Assembly of First Nations – Canada\n\nThe Assembly of First Nations (AFN) is the national organisation representing First Nations citizens in Canada. The AFN represents all citizens regardless of age, gender or place of residence. The Assembly of First Nations is a national aboriginal advocacy organisation.\n\nThere are over 630 First Nation’s communities in Canada. The AFN is intended to present the views of the various First Nations through their leaders in areas such as: Aboriginal and Treaty Rights, Economic Development, Education, Languages and Literacy, Health, Housing, Social Development, Justice, Taxation, Land Claims, Environment, and a whole array of issues that are of common concern to Aboriginal Canadians which arise at any given time.\n\nThe Chiefs meet annually to set national policy and direction through resolution. The National Chief is elected every three years by the Chiefs-in-Assembly.\n\nThe Chiefs meet between the annual assemblies every three to four months in a forum called the ‘Confederacy of Nations’. The membership of the Confederacy consists of Chiefs and other Regional Leaders chosen according to a formula based on the population of each region. First Nations’ Chiefs in Canada are elected in accordance with Indian Act regulations or by traditional governance practices of the country’s First Nations.\n\nHistory of the Assembly of First Nations\n\nThe origins of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) are rooted in the post-World War I activism of Indian veterans returning from the war. The League of Indian Nations of Canada fought against assimilation from the early 1920’s and into the 1930’s. The League laid the foundations for the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB). The Brotherhood consisted of the presidents of provincial and territorial organisations.\n\nAfter the Second World War, First Nations again attempted to form a national lobby group. The North American Indian Brotherhood (NAIB) was established in the late 1940’s, but like its predecessor, the NAIB’s efforts were hindered by a lack of nation-wide support and suppressive government actions, causing it to be disbanded by the early 1950’s.\n\nIn 1961, the National Indian Council was formed to represent three of the four major groups of Aboriginal people in Canada. However, the National Indian Council found the task of uniting all of the various First Nations people’s interests into one national lobby to be challenging.[68]\n\nIn 1969 the federal government introduced a White Paper which called for the assimilation of all First Nation peoples into the mainstream of Canadian society. The National Indian Council joined forces with the federally appointed National Indian Advisory Council to defeat the White Paper. Their efforts were coordinated through an executive – the National Indian Brotherhood (NIB).\n\nIn 1970 the Indian Association of Alberta produced a Red Paper replacing the White Paper. In the same year the first nationally elected President was chosen for the NIB.\n\nIn the late 1970’s the Canadian government decided to patriate the Canadian constitution from Bri"
