It was Dempsey’s first major fight, and within a year, Dempsey would go on to defeat Jess Willard to become world heavyweight champion, a title he held for seven years.\n\nRegarded by many as the apotheosis of the professional fighter, Dempsey trained for his fight against Fulton with Jimmy DeForest, a prominent athletic trainer and promoter who operated gymnasiums in West Allenhurst and Asbury Park over the years.\n\nTraining some of the top fighters of the day, including Jim Jeffries, Jersey Joe Walcott and Luis Firpo, DeForest’s training sessions attracted crowds and he rented out the Long Branch Casino for fights and dances. On November 1, 2006, DeForest was selected to the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame.\n\nSources:\n\nJack Dempsey. (2021). Biography, updated October 22, 2021.
