        "text": "Queensland Premier Campbell Newman has dumped two members of the Liberal National Party's pre-election frontbench team while promoting former leader Lawrence Springborg in his new cabinet line-up.\n\nSix days after leading the LNP to a crushing election victory over the Bligh Government, Mr Newman has announced which MPs will become ministers in his first cabinet. The 19-member cabinet includes just three women.\n\nNewman's first ministry: the full list\n\nHealth challenge for returning Springborg\n\nNew faces are new Toowoomba South MP John McVeigh – who has a farming and agribusiness background and will be the minister for agriculture, fisheries and forestry – and former Townsville deputy mayor David Crisafulli, who will be local government minister.\n\nMr Newman, who spent last night ringing his colleagues with news about their positions, has appointed Mr Springborg as the new health minister, with former Australian Medical Association boss and first-time MP Chris Davis named in the non-cabinet role of assistant health minister.\n\nMr Springborg was the LNP leader who presided over the merger of the two conservative parties in 2008 and led the party to the 2009 election but expressed anger at the process by which Mr Newman was installed as leader in 2011.\n\nMr Springborg served as deputy leader to John-Paul Langbroek after the 2009 election loss but went to the backbench when Mr Newman announced his controversial bid a year ago to lead the LNP to the election from outside Parliament. Mr Springborg is the only person in the cabinet to have previously served as a government minister.\n\nBefore last weekend's election, the LNP's shadow cabinet had 18 members plus Mr Newman. Two of these shadow cabinet members have missed out on jobs in the first Newman cabinet – former industrial relations spokesman Ted Malone, who will instead head a parliamentary committee, and former main roads and fisheries spokesman Mark Robinson.\n\nAdditionally, long-serving LNP frontbencher Fiona Simpson will not receive a cabinet position and will instead serve as Queensland's first female Speaker of the Parliament.\n\nAsked why Mr Robinson was left out of cabinet, Mr Newman said: \"Because at the end of the day, there are only so many positions available.\"\n\nThe former Bligh government cabinet had 19 members including the Premier. Mr Newman has opted to keep the same number of cabinet members, but will introduce assistant minister roles instead of parliamentary secretaries. Assistant ministers will not sit in cabinet, but will help the government oversee several portfolios.\n\nThe 11 assistant ministers include newly elected MPs Lisa France (natural resources and mines), Tim Mander (sport and racing - a nod to his background as an NRL referee), Gavin King (tourism), Steve Minnikin (public transport), Rob Molhoek (child safety), Ian Walker (planning reform), Deb Frecklington (finance, administration and regulatory reform), David Kempton (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs), Saxon Rice (technical and further education) and Robert Cavallucci (multicultural affairs).\n\nDeputy Premier and Minister for State Development Jeff Seeney and Treasurer and Trade Minister Tim Nicholls have already been sworn in to their senior roles, but the full cabinet was not announced until today, when departmental structures were finalised. Mr Seeney will also be the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning.\n\nMr Langbroek will be education, training and employment minister, while Scott Emerson will be the transport and main roads minister.\n\nThe Attorney-General will be Jarrod Bleijie, who had this portfolio in the shadow cabinet.\n\nAndrew Powell will be Minister for Environment and Heritage Protection, Bruce Flegg will be Minister for Housing and Public Works, and David Gibson will get the Police and Community Safety portfolio.\n\nFormer health spokesman Mark McArdle will be moved into the role of Energy and Water Supply Minister and Andrew Cripps will be Minister for Natural Resources and Mines.\n\nUnlike Ms Bligh, Mr Newman has opted not to name a specific Minister for Women. However, LNP staffers said the Office of Women would fall within Tracy Davis's responsibilities as Minister for Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services.\n\nThe Science, IT, Innovation and The Arts portfolio will go to Ros Bates, while Jack Dempsey has been named Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs and Minister Assisting the Premier."
