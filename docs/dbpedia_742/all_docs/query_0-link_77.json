        "text": "The culmination of the recent Referendum Council (2017) was the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for ‘constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country’. The available arguments on constitutional recognition can be examined through the historical, political and legislative challenges faced by Indigenous Australians, and the pathways to sovereignty through agreement and treaty making in settler nations historically and politically similar to Australia. The development of a position for recognition and constitutional change emerges through consideration of the extensive consultation already put forward by Australia’s Indigenous peoples, and in their resultant recommendations. Deciding if Australian society is ready or able to consider these changes, can be observed in the achievements to date towards the re-establishment of an Indigenous presence in everyday contemporary life, and through stated support of constitutional change through opinion polls.\n\nThis note extends my previous analysis of the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples (‘First Nations’) by providing guidance on the optimal approach for this recognition. The guidance is founded on the concepts of efficiency and equity. An optimal recognition is defined as one that achieves both objectives simultaneously. Efficiency flows from a dynamic recognition that changes over time relatively easily, as exemplified by a treaty-based approach. The equity criterion has, as a proxy, legal pluralism, whereby constitutional recognition enlivens ‘Indigenous jurisprudence’ through mechanisms such as self-governance. The proposal is to combine efficiency and equity by guaranteeing the collective rights of Indigenous Australians in accordance with universally recognised principles and norms of international law, such as the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (for which the Commonwealth of Australia announced its support in 2009). Thi...\n\nThis is an edited version of a presentation to the Australian Institute for International Affairs on 16 May 2023. The authors explain the origins of the proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to the Australian Parliament and why the Voice should be enshrined in the Australian Constitution. They also compare how other countries ensure that Indigenous peoples’ interests are properly considered in the processes of government. They conclude by noting that the proposed Voice is a modest request by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to be seen in the Constitution and heard in the democratic life of Australia.\n\nThis article approaches the Report and recommendations of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians from the perspective of constitutional theory. It argues that the Expert Panel's Report and proposals strong reflect the constitutional theory of the American constitutional theorist Jack Balkin, as set out in his books Living Originalism and Constitutional Redemption: Political Faith in an Unjust World. The article claims that the Expert Panel conceives of the functions of the Australian Constitution in much the same way as Balkin conceives of the functions of the United States Constitution as simultaneously basic law, higher law and our law. The article also claims that the Expert Panel's adoption of this kind of thinking, which is misplaced in the Australian context, can be seen as a critique of the legitimacy of the Australian Constitution. The Expert Panel implicitly suggests that the Australian Constitution can be made more legitimate. Finally, the article also claims that the Expert Panel is engaged in a project of constitutional redemption."
