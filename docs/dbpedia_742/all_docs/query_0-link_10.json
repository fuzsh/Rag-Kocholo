        "text": "Details about confirmed and rumoured cuts from within Police and Community Safety Minister Jack Dempsey's portfolio.\n\nCuts already confirmed by government\n\nEmergency Management Queensland:\n\nJobs would go from Emergency Management Queensland's Kedron headquarters, which manned the command centre of the Queensland Government’s response to the January 2011 floods, Minister Jack Dempsey has confirmed. Mr Dempsey could not say how many jobs would be lost but said his portfolio was trying to find \"efficiencies'' to minimise the job cuts. Two senior sources told brisbanetimes.com.au about 250 jobs would be lost from emergency management, including some from the Kedron headquarters. ‘‘Yep, up to around 250 staff from around the department,’’ the source said. A second source agreed between 200 and 250 staff could lose their positions statewide. The Department of Community Safety had 2154 non-frontline full-time-equivalent positions, according to a June 2012 audit.\n\nPrison workshop operations:\n\nThe seven-day-a-week operations of workshops at five Queensland prisons would be wound back to five days a week in a move to save $3.5 million a year, Minister Jack Dempsey announced on August 16. The move triggered swift, unprotected industrial action among jail guards. At the Lotus Glen prison in far north Queensland, the Townsville Correctional Centre, the Capricornia Correctional Centre in Rockhampton, the Maryborough Correctional Centre and the Brisbane Women’s Correctional Centre, prisoners are involved in sewing, tailoring and other work such as metal fabrication. In a letter to the public sector union, Together, Deputy Commissioner Peter Bottomley said the scaling-back would likely affect 36 instructors engaged at the prisons, but insisted their employment was not at risk. Mr Dempsey said redundancies may be offered to those who did not want to take other positions.\n\nDarling Downs jail closure:\n\nThe Darling Downs Correctional Centre near Toowoomba would be closed to save money, Community Safety Minister Jack Dempsey said on July 17. Mr Dempsey said more than 40 full-time staff at the prison and its associated dairy would be relocated or offered redundancy.\n\nBurleigh police beat and other savings, $186.5 million:\n\nA future Gold Coast police beat at Burleigh Heads was axed as part of $186.5 million in government savings outlined by Treasurer Tim Nicholls on June 14. Police Minister Jack Dempsey said the government would still boost police officer numbers.\n\nRumoured cuts:\n\nPrison escort services:\n\nTwo sources told brisbanetimes.com.au the government was looking to privatise prisoner escort services between prisons and courts. On August 16, Minister Jack Dempsey confirmed outsourcing the work to private companies remained an option. He had also discussed finding savings from prisoner escort services with police ministers from other states. Mr Dempsey said he was looking at greater use of technology to allow simple guilty pleas or court “mentions” to occur via video-link.\n\nJail sale:\n\nThere have been uncorroborated reports the government is looking to sell the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre at Wacol, which has been run for 20 years by private firm GEO Group in Victoria. However, Minister Jack Dempsey said on August 16 Queensland was not looking to sell one of its prisons to a private prison operator. “We have no plans for privatisation. None,” he said. Mr Dempsey acknowledged that he did meet with prison operators regularly and was meeting with one company at the end of August."
