        "text": "William Harrison \"Jack\" Dempsey (June 24, 1895 – May 31, 1983) was an American boxer who held the world heavyweight title between 1919 and 1926. Known as \"The Manassa Mauler,\" Dempsey was a tremendous puncher famous for his exciting fights, many of which set financial and attendance records.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nA champion is someone who gets up when he can't.\n\nDempsey's definition of a champion. [[1]]\n\nHoney, I just forgot to duck.\n\nTo his wife on losing the world heavyweight title (September 23, 1926) - quoted by Ronald Reagan in 1981\n\nNobody has to go hungry today. There is plenty of work for a man who wants to work. A kid can make plenty of dough for himself doing almost anything. I was hungry. I had to fight my way along. Freights and the like, fight, fight all the time. The life was tough, but it hardened you.\n\nJack speaking to The Ring Magazine (May 1956)\n\nWhen I was a young fellow I was knocked down plenty. I wanted to stay down, but I couldn’t. I had to collect the two dollars for winning or go hungry. I had to get up. I was one of those hungry fighters. You could have hit me on the chin with a sledgehammer for five dollars. When you haven’t eaten for two days you’ll understand.\n\nGrantland Rice quoting Dempsey, Book of Boxing, page 299.\n\nAbout Jack Dempsey\n\n[edit]\n\nHe should’ve been the only heavyweight anybody ever thought of when they thought about the greatest heavyweight champion. I mean he had everything. He could punch, he could box. He was mean and determined.\n\nTrainer Ray Arcel[[2]]\n\nThere's no place for pity in the ring. Many fighters can't bear to hammer a helpless opponent in the ring. They don't want to hurt him. But look at Dempsey he was probably the greatest rough and tumble fighter who ever lived.\n\nDan Morgan, fight manager[[3]]\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:"
