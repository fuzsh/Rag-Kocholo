        "text": "The Queensland government has denied more public service jobs, including police-related positions, are being cut.\n\nThe public sector union Together says members have reported more stealthy job cuts across several departments.\n\nIt said the cuts affected jobs in health, the Queensland Police Service, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and Multicultural Affairs, Agriculture, and Fisheries and Forestry.\n\nA spokesman for Police Minister Jack Dempsey says job cuts to the police service were completed by June 30.\n\n\"While the QPS is managing some vacancies on the books as per usual no one has been made redundant over what was announced in the budget restructure process,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for Agriculture Minister John McVeigh also said any job cuts are part of last year's budget and department restructure.\n\nÂ© AAP 2024"
