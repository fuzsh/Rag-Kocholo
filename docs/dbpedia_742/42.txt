Jack Dempsey, who held the heavyweight boxing title from 1919 to 1926 and then, during his long retirement, set a standard of dignity rarely equaled by a former champion, died yesterday. He was 87 years old and had been suffering from a heart ailment.

The police, who were called to the Dempsey apartment at 211 East 53d Street, said his wife, Deanna, had found him on the bedroom floor at about 4 P.M. He was pronounced dead shortly after 5.

The cause of death was not immediately determined, but officials of the New York Medical Examiner's office said he had died of natural causes.

The former champion, who for years had greeted fans at a restaurant that bore his name on Broadway in midtown, had been in declining health in recent years.

A year ago, he was admitted to the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where a pacemaker was implanted as treatment for a slowed heart beat.

Mr. Dempsey, who was born in Manassa, Colo., on June 24, 1895, and became known as the Manassa Mauler, won the title in Toledo, Ohio, on July 4, 1919. He knocked out Jess Willard in the third round of an open-air bout, whose flickering movie images have become a staple of television documentaries.

He lost the title to Gene Tunney on a 10-round decision in Philadelphia on Sept. 23, 1926. When he lost in a rematch the next year, the celebrated ''long count'' bout, Mr. Dempsey ended his active ring career, but he staged a series of exhibitions from 1931 to 1942.

Mr. Dempsey's body will be at the Frank E, Campbell Funeral Home today and tomorrow. Funeral services and burial will be private. An obituary appears on page B4.
