        "text": "Ours is a Fiduciary Role..\n\nAt Impetus Arthasutra, we follow a \"Principle-Based Approach\" in managing our client's Investments, based on what we have learned during the last three decades of our professional practice in the industry.\n\nWe play the role of a \"Lighthouse\", during volatile times and Black Swan events, guiding our Investors to safe harbor as much as we aim to get the best Risk-adjusted returns on their Investments.\n\nWe take our Fiduciary Responsibility very seriously as that is what has helped us build our business over the last 30 years.\n\nIt all begins with making a financial plan to meet your goals after understanding your Investment objectives, return expectations, risk tolerance, and then crafting an Investment plan to achieve the goals. It continues with regular reviews of your Investments and keeping you updated regularly on both the challenges and opportunities in the ever-changing Financial Markets.\n\nWhat We Do\n\nWe are Portfolio Managers under SEBI Portfolio Managers Regulations.\n\nCreating and managing a unique Investment Portfolio of Securities, listed in the Indian Capital Market, based on your Financial Goals and Risk Tolerance, is what we do.\n\nAt Impetus, we empower your financial journey with personalized Investment Strategies, crafted to align with your unique goals.\n\nOur 30 years of experience and expertise in the Financial Market ensure a seamless and hassle-free experience for our clients.\n\nImpetus Is Distinct\n\nImpetus makes a distinction as we correctly understand the binding between the Financial and Emotional Well-being of every individual. We also recognize the fact that, as the financial goals of each individual is different from another, the Financial Planning for each individual also has to be different and personalized.\n\nImpetus Arthasutra Private Limited was established in 1994 to provide research-based Investment Management Services for institutional and individual investors. Over the past 30 years, it has evolved into a full-fledged Portfolio Management Company providing comprehensive Investment Management Services to high net-worth clients in India and abroad.\n\n“Geography is History” in its true sense for the clients of Impetus, as they experience a hassle-free Investment Management environment irrespective of their residential status. “Your Account” on our website provides comprehensive & up-to-date details about the Investments under our management for each Investor.\n\nHolistic Approach\n\nUnless a holistic approach is adopted in planning and managing the Investments, the Investor would seldom achieve their financial goals. Educating the Investor about the need-based Financial Planning rather than trend-based Investments is most essential. As what is in trend today may not help an Investor to achieve his/her financial or life goals going forward.\n\nActual needs or financial goals of the Investor need to be ascertained as the first step.\n\nMeticulous evaluation of the resources, aspirations and risk appetite of an individual before making any major Investment decisions is the second step.\n\nOne has to remember that emotional, personal and spiritual factors also need to be taken into consideration along with financial resources while making Financial Planning for any individual. Financial well-being alone can not make an individual happy unless it is matching and coinciding with other aspirations of that individual.\n\nInvestors often demand performance benchmark related to their Investments but very few demand or even look at the performance benchmark related to the successful achievement of their overall planning objectives. An Investor with proper Financial Planning would hardly be worried about the volatilities of the markets as the well thought-out strategies would enable a smooth sailing in troubled waters.\n\nRegular Wealth Check-Up Is As Essential As Health Check-Up\n\nWe need to bear in mind that Wealth Management is an ongoing process until the Investor achieves his/her financial goals. It requires a periodical review of the portfolio of Investments and fine-tuning of asset allocation based on the changes in the Investor’s profile or overall environment in the world of Investments.\n\nWe all, as individuals spend years building up good savings. It would be desirable to spend quality time while making plans for the Investments of this hard-earned savings."
