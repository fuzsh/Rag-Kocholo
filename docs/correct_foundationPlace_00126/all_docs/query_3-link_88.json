However, we should be aware that the external environment is intertwined and complex, the domestic effective demand remains insufficient and the foundation for sound economic recovery and growth still needs to be strengthened. At the next stage, we must follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, adhere to the general principle of pursuing progress while ensuring stability, fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, accelerate the efforts to create a new pattern of development, and strive to promote high-quality development. We must work harder to invigorate the market and stimulate the internal impetus, and consolidate and enhance the momentum for economic recovery and growth, so as to ensure the sustained and sound development of the economy.\n\nâ\n\nNotes:\n\nâ\n\n1. The growth rate of GDP and its sub-items are calculated at constant prices. The growth rates of value added of industrial enterprises above designated size and its sub-items are calculated at comparable prices. Both are real growth rates. The growth rates of other indicators are nominal growth by using current prices unless otherwise specified.\n\nâ\n\n2. According to the auto-revision function of the seasonal adjustment model, revisions are made to quarter-on-quarter growth of GDP and to month-on-month changes of the value added of industrial enterprises above designated size, investment in fixed assets (excluding rural households), and total retail sales of consumer goods. The revised figures, quarter-on-quarter GDP growth for the second quarter of 2024 and month-on-month changes of other indicators for June 2024 are as follows:\n\nâ\n\nThe quarter-on-quarter growth of GDP in 2023 and in the first and the second quarters of 2024 are 1.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 1.5 percent, 1.2 percent, 1.5 percent and 0.7 percent respectively.\n\nâ\n\nMonth-on-Month Growth Rate of Other Indicators\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n3. Industrial enterprises above designated size are industrial enterprises with annual revenue from principal business over 20 million yuan.\n\nâ\n\nAs industrial enterprises above the designated size change every year, to ensure the data comparability between years, the coverage of the data of the same period last year used for estimating year-on-year growth rates like that of products output, are as consistent as possible with the current period and different from the coverage of the data published last year. The main reasons are as follows: First, the statistical units change. Every year, some enterprises are included in the survey as they meet the threshold, while some enterprises are removed from the survey because of downsizing. Besides, enterprises that have newly gone into operation, been bankrupted, canceled their registrations or had their business licenses revoked also cause impact. Second, duplicated outputs across regions of enterprise groups have been removed based on the ad hoc surveys since duplication is found in the products output of some enterprise groups.\n\nâ\n\n4. The Index of Services Production is the change of production in the reporting period compared to the base period with the price factors deducted.\n\nâ\n\n5. The scope of the total retail sales of consumer goods include all legal entities, establishments and self-employed individuals involved in retail trades or providing catering services. Specifically, businesses above the designated size include wholesale enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals), retail enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) and lodging and catering enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) with annual revenue from principal business over 20 million yuan, 5 million yuan and 2 million yuan respectively.\n\nâ\n\nAs the wholesale, retail, and lodging and catering enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) above the designated size change every year, to ensure the data comparability between years, the coverage of the data of the same period last year used for estimating year-on-year growth rates like that of the retail sales of consumer goods by businesses above the designated size is consistent with the current period and different from the coverage of data published last year. The main reasons are: some enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) are included in the survey as they meet the threshold, while some enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) are removed from the survey because of downsizing every year. Besides, enterprises (businesses, self-employed individuals) that have newly gone into operation, been bankrupted, canceled their registrations or had their business licenses revoked also cause impact.\n\nâ\n\nOnline retail sales refer to the retail sales of goods and services realized through internet trading platforms (including self-built websites and third-party platforms). Goods and services include physical goods and non-physical goods (e.g. virtual goods and services).\n\nâ\n\nThe total retail sales of consumer goods include the online retail sales of physical goods, but not the non-physical goods.\n\nâ\n\n6. The retail sales of services refer to the total value of services directly provided by enterprises (establishments, self-employed units) to individuals and other units for non-production and non-operating purposes in the form of transactions. It aims to reflect the value of services with the nature of consumption sold by service providers in monetary terms, including the retail sales of services in transportation, accommodation, catering, education, health, sports, entertainment, and other fields.\n\nâ\n\n7. The growth rates of investment in fixed assets are calculated on a comparable basis.\n\nâ\n\n8. Data of imports and exports are from the General Administration of Customs.\n\nâ\n\n9. Employed people refer to people aged 16 and above who have the ability to work and engage in gainful employment for remuneration payment or business income.\n\nâ\n\n10. The median of the nationwide per capita disposable income of households refers to the per capita disposable income of households which lies in the middle of all surveyed households ranked from low to high on the basis of per capita disposable income level.\n\nâ\n\n11. Due to the rounding-off reasons, the subentries may not add up to the aggregate totals.\n\nâ\n\nIn case of any differences between English translation and the original Chinese text, the Chinese edition shall prevail."
