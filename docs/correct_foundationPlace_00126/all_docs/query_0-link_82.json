        "text": "Today marks a pivotal moment in Anthology's journey as we unveil our revitalized brand identity. This transformation reflects our unwavering commitment to innovation in education technology and our promise to deliver unparalleled learning experiences.\n\nBut more than that, today is a celebration of the tremendous collaboration that has brought us to this significant milestone. It’s not just a visual change — it is a fundamental shift in our philosophy and approach. This revitalized brand is a demonstration of our future direction.\n\nA Bold Refresh\n\nAny time a company pursues a rebrand, people ask why. What does this bold move represent, and why is the timing right? It’s no small feat, so we did not take this decision lightly.\n\nThe impetus for change came with the recognition that our brand must reflect our strategic vision for the company and our purpose. While our legacy served as a valuable foundation, we also needed to realign our brand’s personality with the desire to be bold, empowering, and refreshing.\n\nWe started by clearly defining our purpose, or our “why.”\n\nWe exist to boldly change what education and technology can make possible together.\n\nThis is what drives us and inspires us.\n\nAs we dove deeper into our rebranding journey, we affirmed the deep resonance of our name, Anthology. It captures the very core of what we offer: the best of education and technology. The word anthology is defined as a collection of valuable works. To us, it represents a curated collection of best-of technologies, each chosen to contribute to a richer educational experience.\n\nOur new brand also places our customers at the center of this transformation. Many of our customers were integral in this process, and we sincerely appreciate their support in going on this journey with us.\n\nWe also know the world of higher education has changed dramatically. You could say that we are changing together.\n\nPost-pandemic trends, issues, and innovation are redefining the course of higher education’s future—perhaps faster and with greater impact than in any other sector today. Artificial intelligence, recruitment and retention, digital teaching and learning, full learner lifecycle engagement, and operational efficiency are just a few of the topics at the forefront of every higher education leader’s mind.\n\nIn response to this transformed environment, our new brand identity is a testament to our commitment to our customers. It signals that Anthology is leading the charge in delivering meaningful innovation that empowers institutions to tackle today's and tomorrow's challenges.\n\nPower of Together™\n\nWe hold the simple belief that together, education and technology have the power to create life-changing opportunities for everyone, everywhere. Institutions, educators, and learners with the right technology and the right technology partner have exponentially greater power to succeed. To nurture sustainable career paths. To open doors and create life-changing opportunities around the world.\n\nWe call this the Power of Together, and it’s not just a tagline for us—it's our approach to innovation and a guiding principle behind everything we do.\n\nThrough this evolution, we're pledging to support our customers and help them navigate the complexities of the modern educational landscape, ensuring they remain at the cutting edge of present and future educational demands.\n\nWhen you choose Anthology, you get:\n\nGuidance from the change leader in the EdTech space, empowering you to navigate fast and unprecedented change boldly\n\nThe most intelligent solutions in the industry, with built-in data insights that help you make the most strategic decisions for your entire institution\n\nA proven partner in driving the best outcomes possible, plus confidence in knowing that everything we do happens in close partnership with our customers\n\nBuilding the future is a thrilling adventure. If you’re a creative director, graphic designer, or copywriter, you know how many iterations it takes to refine and perfect a brand's portrayal. Hundreds of words, color palettes, and images did not make the cut. Many late nights, brainstorming sessions, and in-depth reviews with a fully engaged executive committee led us to this moment. It was truly a collaborative effort led by a diverse group of Anthologists who love this industry and have a passion for EdTech.\n\nI would like to invite you to learn more:\n\nNews Release\n\nAbout Us\n\nSpecial thank you to Michelle Mierzwa for her relentless focus on excellence and expert guidance"
