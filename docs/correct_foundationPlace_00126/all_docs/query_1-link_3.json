        "text": "Services industry growth to drive opportunities in the Office and Business Park sector in Tier 1 cities.\n\nFive Investment Perspectives into the India Office and Business Park sector\n\nIndia has long been recognised as a country with immense potential, but it was often hindered by bureaucracy and red tape. In recent years, however, India has made laudable strides, with its economic growth leapfrogging other major countries, in part driven by concerted government-led reforms and sector-focused initiatives that have shaped a more business-friendly climate, particularly for foreign investment.\n\nToday, India has forged ahead into a new era, and the country holds much promise with the largest youth population in the world1 and the second largest labour force2 globally. Investors can look forward to sustained returns from key beneficiaries of these structural advancements, particularly in the Office and Business Park sector.\n\nKey Beneficiaries – Technology Sector to Witness the Highest Growth\n\nIndia is recognised as a key tech hub, with its cities ranked among the top three15 in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region and among the top 1016 globally. It is also the top offshoring destination for IT companies across the world. As a result, sectors such as the Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI), Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)17 and Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO)18 will stand to benefit the most from the national directive towards becoming an even more digitally enabled economy.\n\nThe IT/IT-enabled Services (ITeS) industry accounted for 7.4%19 of India’s GDP in Fiscal Year 2022 (FY2022), and its market share is expected to hit 10% by 2025. Total industry revenue is estimated to have reached US$227 billion in FY2022 (+17% YoY), with further expected growth to US$350 billion by FY2026 (CAGR of +11.4%) (see Figure 2), underpinned by the growing demand for new technologies including cloud and analytics.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n1.
