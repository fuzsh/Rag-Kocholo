        "text": "Responses by Peter Larkin, creative director, Marcel Legane, developer and Matt Jefferies, designer, Nice and Serious\n\nBackground: Impetus–The Private Equity Foundation (PEF) is the driving force behind many great charities, helping them deliver the right support to more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The site we created communicates its work in a more engaging way to potential donors, volunteers and policymakers.\n\nHighlights: A simplified navigation that allows users to find out about Impetus–PEF’s work more easily. The bold, fullscreen hero imagery helps bring the impact the nonprofit organization management company has to life and surface the many different ways users can support its work.\n\nChallenges: One of the most difficult aspects of the site was catering to a diverse audience. Through many rounds of iteration on the navigation structure—using personas, card sorts and testing—we arrived at a solution that was simple yet comprehensive.\n\nFavorite details: The video header on the homepage was a great way to utilize footage that Impetus–PEF already had available. Because of the way the subjects interact with the camera, it just grabs users’s attention as soon as they land on the page.\n\nTime constraints: The client really understood the importance of getting the site right and wanted to make sure the content was perfect, so we actually had a much longer lead time than originally planned. This meant we could be really thorough and launch a great product. We’re not always this fortunate!"
