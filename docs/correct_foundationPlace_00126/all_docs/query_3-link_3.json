This program accelerates creating value using data in direct support of your strategic business objectives. Furthermore, it leverages specific use cases to jump-start enterprises’ data flywheel and create value-based outcomes throughout the entire process of building a data platform.\n\nHow the D2E Program Works?\n\nThrough the Data-Driven Everything Program, AWS and Impetus experts will engage with your business and technical stakeholders in a two-day workshop.\n\n1. Think Big\n\n‘Think Big’ with the Mobilize workshop, which sets the basis of a modern data strategy and creates a compelling data-driven vision.

Start Small\n\nDeliver greater value and credibility through the Mindset and People & Process workshops that allow you to scale capabilities beyond the original use case. Build the right organizational and process model that aligns with your modern data strategy\n\n3. Scale Fast\n\nThrough the Technology workshop, establish a scalable technology foundation and we can help you scale with a 6-to-9-month roadmap of priority projects.\n\nRegister here to schedule a workshop with us."
