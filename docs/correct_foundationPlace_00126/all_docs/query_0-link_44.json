        "text": "Impetus Gurukul is a coaching institution situated in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. It is a coaching institute that prepares for entrance exams like JEE Mains, JEE Advanced, NIMCET, CUET, Jamia Millia Islamia entrance, NDA, SSB, etc.\n\nIt is a coaching institute that is best known for NIMCET exam preparation. I joined their Magical Capsule Course last year i.e. 2023 and it is a course that quickly covers all the topics of NIMCET, CUET entrance exam in just approximately 4 months and it was an online course. Also, there are other courses as well which prepare you for different MCA entrance exams. According to me, it was one of the best decisions of my life that I thought that I should join this institute. The teachers here are so well-versed in their fields that if you have any doubt in any section be it Mathematics, Reasoning, English or Computer, they try their level best to clear your doubts. Especially, one of the best teachers from whom I studied during that time was Dr. Sharad Neha Gupta Sir. He is the best teacher of Mathematics. He is a master of his field and is so confident that he can solve any mathematics question that is given to him.\n\nMy Mathematics was weak before I joined this institute and my main aim was to clear NIMCET with a good rank and get into a good college. So, that was the time when I decided that I should join a coaching institute. So, I scrolled through different platforms i.e. Google, and YouTube to check which institutes prepare the students for MCA entrance exams. At first, it was difficult for me to find good coaching because it is not that easy to find coaching institutes that are preparing students for MCA exams conducted across India. So, after a few days of searching a good coaching, I got to know about Impetus Gurukul.\n\nAt that time, I only had roughly around 5 months to prepare for the NIMCET Exam. So, I joined their Magical Capsule Course. The fees for this course were so low that anyone can pay it. That’s one of the beauties of this coaching institute that they do not charge you much unlike other coaching institutes. The topics in this course were covered so nicely and briefly that almost all of my doubts were cleared. If you think that your Maths are not that good, my suggestion to you would be that you should join this institute and start studying from Sharad Sir. Also, other teachers are also good, it’s your choice and ability from whom you grasp things faster. The reasoning section is also covered by Sharad Sir (most of the time). The mock tests that were given to us were so nicely curated that they contained easy, medium as well as difficult questions. Full-length as well as sectional mock tests were given to us. The teachers also solved many previous year’s papers to give us an idea of how the real paper would look like, how the questions could be asked, etc.\n\nThe fees for other courses such as the JEE Mains course or other courses are also not that high. Also, the teachers here conduct different fun sessions to release the stress of the students. I remember that before we were going to appear for the exam, Sharad Sir conducted an online session for magical capsule course students and an offline session for the students who were studying live from him in Bhopal where the institute is located. In that session, he cleared all our doubts and also assured us that we could crack this exam. “Be confident and do not panic” were the words that he again and again said during his session which increased our confidence and helped us in clearing the exam.\n\nFor more details, you can check their website (https://www.impetusgurukul.com/). Overall, I can confirm by saying that Yes you should join this institute if you are preparing mainly for different MCA entrance exams. You will love being here."
