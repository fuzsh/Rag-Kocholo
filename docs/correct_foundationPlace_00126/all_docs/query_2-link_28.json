        "text": "To ensure a promising future for education, it is imperative to strike a balance between redesigning physical schools in a futuristic format and leveraging the resources of EdTech. The Government of India recognizes the pressing need for this transformation and has thus introduced several schemes and policies that foster the growth of the emerging education paradigm, propelling the EdTech startup industry to achieve greater success.\n\nThe government’s National Education Policy focuses on skill development at the grassroots level which has led to the emergence of a more empowered and educated workforce. The EdTech industry in India is expected to receive a major boost as a result of these efforts. Not just this, but one of the most significant impacts of the government’s push for upskilling and the merger of technology in education is the widespread availability of online learning resources. Kids are now learning to use computers at a young age, which opens up new opportunities for them. With the internet and mobile devices becoming increasingly accessible, online learning has become an affordable and convenient alternative to traditional classroom education. This has been particularly beneficial for students in remote areas or those who face socio-economic barriers to education.\n\nAdapting a Multi-dimensional Approach\n\nThe push by the government promotes the use of new-age technologies like Metaverse, ed-gaming, NFTs, and immersive classrooms in EdTech startups which is making education more personalized, engaging, and effective for students. By creating interactive and immersive learning experiences, EdTech startups are making learning more enjoyable and less intimidating for students. This not only improves students’ academic performance but also helps them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, personalized learning experiences help students learn at their own pace and in a way that suits their unique learning style, which can increase student engagement and retention.\n\nThese technologies have revolutionized the way students learn and are making education more customised and interactive for students. EdTech startups are at the forefront of this revolution and are leveraging these technologies to create innovative learning experiences that are tailored to the needs of individual learners.\n\nDrives New Innovation\n\nThe exceptional support extended by the Government of India towards EdTech startups is a big enabler in encouraging them to innovate as much as they can. The Ministry of Education has received a significant boost in the Union Budget 2023, which is expected to have a transformative impact on India’s higher education and EdTech sector. The budget document states that for the fiscal year 2023-24, the government has earmarked INR 1,12,898.97 crores to the Ministry of Education, which is a substantial increase from the previous year. This funding allocation is expected to provide much-needed resources and support to the education sector and help accelerate the growth of EdTech startups in India.\n\nPositioning India as a Global leader in EdTech\n\nAccording to data from Tracxn, a startup intelligence platform, the Indian EdTech sector has seen a total investment of $2.2 billion across 298 deals between 2014 and 2020. And another report by NASSCOM and Zinnov estimates that India’s online education market will reach $10.4 billion by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39%.\n\nThe Indian government’s push for digital education and its recent budgetary allocation to the Ministry of Education is contributing massively to the growth of the EdTech industry in the country. The government’s support for innovation, research and development, and the promotion of entrepreneurship has created a conducive environment for EdTech startups to flourish and position India as a global leader in the industry. Thanks to the support, Indian EdTech startups are able to leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as AI, machine learning, and blockchain, to create innovative products and services that are transforming the way education is delivered. These startups are also offering personalized and affordable solutions to cater to the diverse learning needs of students, particularly in remote and underserved areas of the country while also tapping into the global market.\n\nOverall, the growing demand for skill-based learning, the availability of online learning resources, government support and increased investment in the industry are all contributing to its growth and success. The EdTech industry is playing a critical role in democratizing education in India and providing access to high-quality learning resources to all, regardless of their socio-economic background or location. However, strong support by the government towards increasing scholarship opportunities for upskilling at both schools and higher education levels will help boost the industry growth even further along with of course making upskilling education more accessible.\n\n(The author is Ms. Ritika Amit Kumar, Co-Founder, and CEO of STEM Metaverse and the views expressed in this article are her own)"
