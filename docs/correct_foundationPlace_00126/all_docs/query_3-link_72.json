Modern ‘born in the cloud’ applications can scale up or down on-demand, and are built to support multiple organizations from a single cloud, while providing total isolation of different users, desktops and data, as security requirements warrant. But users require the flexibility to access applications from the cloud, regardless of whether it's a cloud-native one. Cloud-native desktops are making this both possible and practical, in terms of performance, security, portability, and more. During this session, we will discuss how cloud-native technology is being used in government to deliver a seamless desktop-as-a-service experience for both IT personnel and for users.

They need to unlock insights from data such as clickstream, geo-location, sensor, server log, social, text and video data. However, becoming a data-first enterprise comes with many challenges. Join this webinar organized by three leaders in their respective fields and learn from our experts how you can accelerate the implementation of a scalable, cost-efficient and robust Big Data solution. Cisco, Hortonworks and Red Hat will explore how new data sets can enrich existing analytic applications with new perspectives and insights and how they can help you drive the creation of innovative new apps that provide new value to your business.\n\nSPARK USE CASE- Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Electricity Market Bi...\n\nSPARK USE CASE- Distributed Reinforcement Learning for Electricity Market Bi...Impetus Technologies\n\nSPARK SUMMIT SESSION - A majority of the electricity in the U.S. is traded in independent system operator (ISO) based wholesale markets. ISO-based markets typically function in a two-step settlement process with day-ahead (DA) financial settlements followed by physical real-time (spot) market settlements for electricity. In this work, we focus on obtaining equilibrium bidding strategies for electricity generators in DA markets. Electricity prices in DA markets are determined by the ISO, which matches competing supply offers from power generators with demand bids from load serving entities. Since there are multiple generators competing with one another to supply power, this can be modeled as a competitive Markov decision problem, which we solve using a reinforcement learning approach. For power networks of realistic sizes, the state-action space could explode, making the RL procedure computationally intensive. This has motivated us to solve the above problem over Spark. The talk provides the following takeaways: 1. Modeling the day-ahead market as a Markov decision process 2. Code sketches to show the markov decision process solution over Spark and Mahout over Apache Tez 3. Performance results comparing Mahout over Apache Tez and Spark."
