By using, accessing, or purchasing our applications, products/services, and/or websites (the “Product/Service”), you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.\n\n“Personal Information” is any information, whether correct or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, that relates to you and which, alone or in combination with other information, could reasonably be used to identify you. However, it does not include publicly available information lawfully made available to the public from federal, state, or local government records.\n\nWe may make changes to this Privacy Policy from time to time. Therefore, we will indicate the most recent updated date at the top of the Policy and highlight any significant changes to the Policy.\n\nInformation we collect\n\nWe collect/ receive your Personal Information in multiple ways, depending on which product/service, applications, or websites you use and how you interact with us.\n\nInformation you provide, and we collect from other sources\n\nYou may choose to share personal and additional information with us by purchasing or interacting with our “Product/Service,” through various means including, but not limited to:\n\nWhen you create and manage a user account regarding any of our products/services\n\nRequest technical support from us\n\nRequest any information as a prospect\n\nCommunicate via email, telephone, or online chat\n\nUpload information through our “Product/Service”\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\n\nSubmit job applications\n\nParticipate in surveys\n\nParticipate in tradeshows\n\nFor some “Product/Service,” we may ask you to provide following information, including:\n\nBasic personal details (e.g., your name, title, and gender)\n\nContact details (e.g., your email address, postal address, and phone number)\n\nProfessional details (e.g., the name of your organization and any professional organization memberships)\n\nAny other Personal Information you choose to provide us (e.g., in communications with technical support services, marketing teams, or while provisioning our products/services)\n\nIf you are an internal stakeholder (employee, contractor, freelancer etc), we may also seek your consent to process:\n\nBank account information (for payroll processing)\n\nCriminal records (from background verification process)\n\nAcademic qualifications, Professional details (for interviews)\n\nIdentity data (National Unique identifier (Aadhar), PAN data, Passport information)\n\nWe may also collect this information indirectly from publicly available sources (such as your employer’s Website or professional social networks such as LinkedIn) or third-party data providers that maintain individuals’ contact information lists.\n\nInformation we collect\n\nWhen you access or use our “Product/Service,” we may collect certain information about your device and your use of our “Product/Service.” Such information may include:\n\nName and Version information about the web browser\n\nDate/time stamp of your visit to our Website (s)\n\nProducts/services you purchased, with related pricing\n\nIf you are using a mobile device, the model of the device and its operating system\n\nYour I.P. address\n\nInformation about your usage of our Website including what pages you use, the frequency of your use, links that you click, and how often you log in\n\nCookies and similar technologies\n\nWe may collect certain information by automated means when you use our websites, such as cookies. A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser and store information or settings on the device. The information we collect enables us to serve the returning visitors better. For example, it can “remember” and auto-populate your email address in the future. We also use cookies to track responses to our marketing materials, such as emails and online advertisements. In addition, your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies.\n\nSome of our websites also use marketing automation technology (Pardot) to collect data on visitors’ behaviour. These Pardot cookies help us track your visits to our websites and enable us to create an engaging marketing experience for you. We also use Pardot cookies to understand your interactions with our emails and ensure we send you relevant information. Specifically, Pardot cookies let us know whether you have opened our emails or which links are clicked. Please click here for more information on Pardot’s privacy and cookie policy.\n\nSome of our websites may also feature cookies associated with certain unaffiliated companies. By engaging with such other companies’ sites, for instance, by clicking the Facebook “Like” button found on our Website, such companies may place session or persistent cookies on your device. This may allow these third parties to collect information about your online activities over time and across websites. The use of these cookies is subject to such third-parties cookie policies, which we strongly recommend you review.\n\nWeb analytics and interest-based advertising\n\nWe may use web analytics services on our websites. The service providers that administer such services use cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the site. The information collected through these means (including I.P. address) is disclosed or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate the use of the Website or for advertising purposes, as described below.\n\nSome of our online advertising takes place through Google Display Advertising. As a part of this program, we use Google Analytics features such as Retargeting. In addition, we and the operators of these ad networks, including Google, may use third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) – and in some cases, first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) – to inform, optimize, and serve ads across the internet based on a user’s past visits to our Website.\n\nYou can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads using the Google Ads Preferences Manager. To disable Google Analytics in general, please download the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics provided by Google at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. To learn more about other ad networks, including how to opt out, click here.\n\nDo not track\n\nSome web browsers and mobile devices incorporate a “do not track” feature that signals to websites and online services that you do not wish to be tracked when enabled. However, because there is no accepted standard for responding to the do-not-track signal, we do not recognize or respond to these signals.\n\nHow we use the information we collect\n\nWe may use the information we collect from you to:\n\nManage any accounts that you may have with us\n\nValidate your identity\n\nSend personalized marketing messages via email, post, and telephone.

We are not responsible or liable for the content of any such websites, any use of such websites, or the information or privacy practices employed by the providers of such websites.

We have included this section to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), and any terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this notice.\n\nYour Rights and Choices:The CCPA provides consumers with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.\n\nAccess to specific information and Data portability rights: You have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable request, we will disclose to you: (i) the categories of Personal Information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources for the Personal Information we collected about you; (iii) our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we share that Personal Information if any; (v) the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you (also called a data portability request); (vi) if we sold or disclosed your Personal Information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing: (a) sales, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and (b) disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the Personal Information categories that each category of recipient obtained.\n\nDeletion request rights: You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:\n\ncomplete the transaction for which we collected the Personal Information, provide a product or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;\n\ndetect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;\n\ndebug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;\n\nexercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;\n\nenable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;\n\ncomply with a legal obligation;\n\nmake other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.\n\nExercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion rights: To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please email a valid consumer request to PrivacyOffice@impetus.com.\n\nOnly you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information.\n\nYou may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within 12 months. A valid consumer request must: (i) provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collect Personal Information or an authorized representative; and (ii) describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to understand, evaluate, and respond to it properly. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you. Therefore, we will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.\n\nResponse timing and format: We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover 12 months preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. Our response will also explain why we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or unfounded. If we determine that the proposal warrants a fee, we will tell you why we decided and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.\n\nNon-discrimination: We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: (i) deny you Products or services; (ii) Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; (iv) suggests that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. However, we may offer you specific financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.\n\nChanges to Our Privacy Notice\n\nWe reserve the right to amend this privacy notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will post the updated notice on the Website with an effective date. Your continued use of our Website following the posting of changes constitutes your acceptance of such changes."
