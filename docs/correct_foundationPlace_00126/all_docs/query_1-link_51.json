Childhood friends in Texas remember David as a gentle, loving man who considered becoming a chiropractor. Traveling to Humboldt County in the midst of the timber controversy, David learned tree-climbing and nonviolent protest tactics; he took the wood's name \"Gypsy.\" The story of his vibrant life and tragic death at 24 is documented in 'A Good Forest For Dying,' by Patrick Beach (2004). On the 20th anniversary of Gypsy's death, community leaders, friends, and fellow activists established this fund to provide an annual scholarship for a local high school senior or first year student at Humboldt State University or College of the Redwoods who has demonstrated commitment to issues of forest ecology through volunteer and/or academic projects.

Its focus is to reconnect the hearts, hands, and minds of people to the natural environment. The cultural relationships of indigenous peoples with their ancestral homeland environments are becoming more imperiled with each generation. Indigenous knowledge is founded in practice and belief; without being a component of ecosystem process, the functional role of humans is removed from our landscapes. Traditional Ecological Knowledge, practice, and belief systems can be revitalized, and it may be our best chance at learning to live with fire in our rural communities once again. It is with great hope this fund will grow to support our work in the western Klamath Mountains and beyond.

The truth is that many people of color in Humboldt communities feel unsafe, unwelcome and experience discrimination -- in short, their experiences are not equitable to those of people who identify as white. Most of us don’t want that to be true. However, we can’t change this unless we understand how these differences manifest individually, institutionally and collectively, and address racial inequities across organizations and at every level of society.

Betty and Al enjoyed a happy marriage and modeled what the words “for better or worse” really mean. When our mother developed Alzheimer’s, Dad was her unwavering caregiver, teaching himself how to cook, clean (sort of), and even the family tradition of home canning.\n\nBetty and Al loved visiting our beautiful North Coast.

Many of us who live here chose it for that very fact. Yet, a long history of uncontrolled resource consumption, combined with current pressures such as a growing human population, increasing cannabis cultivation, aquaculture, renewable energy projects, and climate change, have caused and will continue to cause damage that needs to be remedied, mitigated, and prevented in order to maintain that diversity. The Humboldt Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Fund was established by local author, biologist, and educator, Ken Burton, in 2022 to support environmental and conservation efforts in the county, with an emphasis on needs related to wildlife and wildlife habitat. Projects that will have direct, measurable effects, such as invasive species control, fish passage enhancement, habitat restoration, and reintroductions, are preferred. Please consider donating to this fund to help make Humboldt County an even better home for its wildlife - and by extension its human inhabitants!\n\nDonate to Humboldt Wildlife and Habitat Conservation Fund\n\nHumboldt-Del Norte County Medical Society Future Physicians Scholarship Fund\n\nThe Humboldt-Del Norte County Medical Society, a component of the California Medical Association, was founded in 1886 to represent physicians on the North Coast. The purposes of the Society are to promote the science and art of medicine, the care and well-being of patients, the protections of the public health, and the interests of the medical profession; to cooperate with other organizations of like purposes; and to unite with similar societies in the state of California as component societies of the California Medical Association.

We are hoping to build this fund into an endowment to make it sustainable for the future.

They were both very much working class individuals who lived through the depression era and well as WWII. Jack served in the military as an Intelligence & Reconnaissance Specialist earning a Silver Star along with other medals for his demonstration of courage and bravery in battling the enemy across France, Belgium, and Germany until he was wounded and then went to Great Britain to work on allied airplanes. After the war he returned to Ferndale for a time to work on a dairy before moving to Berkeley where he married Donell. They had both attended grammar school and high school (except 12th grade which was not taught in Petrolia). Jack worked at Pacific Lumber Company (PLC) for approximately 18 years. During his last 2 to 4 years at PL Jack started building up a small herd of heifers and cows and milked both morning and night before going to work at PL. The McCanless Dairy started by Jack in the early 60’s is now run by Jack’s grandson and is now over 500 cows in size. Jack never had the advantage of having FFA classes in high school or animal science classes at the college level. He basically learned the dairy business by talking with other Ferndale dairymen and working 7 days a week. That is why Jack would like the idea of scholarship funds going to an individual that has demonstrated a very strong work ethic and has an interest in pursuing Agricultural Science, may have had to overcome other life challenges and may have not had the advantages that other more fortunate students have had.\n\nDonell graduated from Berkley in 1947 with a degree in education. After her three sons reached school age she began her teaching career teaching at Price Creek Elementary, a one room, classes first through eighth grades. A significant part of her teaching career was as a Special Ed teacher in Ferndale Elementary where she worked with young kids who had different needs than some of the regular students. She received great gratification in working with her Special Ed kids and went above and beyond occasionally rewarding a student or group of students with a weekend trip to the family cabin in Petrolia or some other fun activity.
