        "text": "Power is among the most critical components of infrastructure, crucial for the economic growth and welfare of nations. The existence and development of adequate power infrastructure is essential for sustained growth of the Indian economy. The fundamental principle of India’s power industry has been to provide universal access to affordable power in a sustainable way. The Ministry of Power has made significant efforts over the past few years to turn the country from one with a power shortage to one with a surplus by establishing a single national grid, fortifying the distribution network, and achieving universal household electrification.\n\nIndia’s power sector is one of the most diversified in the world. Sources of power generation range from conventional sources such as coal, lignite, natural gas, oil, hydro and nuclear power, to viable non-conventional sources such as wind, solar, agricultural, and domestic waste. Electricity demand in the country has increased rapidly and is expected to rise further in the years to come. In order to meet the increasing demand for electricity in the country, massive addition to the installed generating capacity is required.\n\nIndia is the third-largest producer and consumer of electricity worldwide, with an installed power capacity of 429.96 GW as of January 31, 2024.\n\nAs of January 31, 2024, India’s installed renewable energy capacity (including hydro) stood at 182.05 GW, representing 42.3% of the overall installed power capacity. As of April 30, 2024, Solar energy contributed 82.63 GW, followed by 46.16 GW from wind power, 10.35 GW from biomass, 5.00 GW from small hydropower, 0.59 from waste to energy, and 46.93 GW from hydropower.\n\nThe non-hydro renewable energy capacity addition stood at 15.27 GW in FY23, up from 14.07 GW in FY22.\n\nIndia's power generation witnessed its highest growth rate in over 30 years in FY23. Power generation in India increased by 6.80% to 1,452.43 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) as of January 2024. According to data from the Ministry of Power, India's power consumption stood at 1,503.65 BU in April 2023.\n\nThe peak power demand in the country stood at 243.27 GW in January 2024.\n\nThe coal plants registered a PLF of 73.7% for the first nine-months period in FY23 compared to 68.5% in FY22 for the same period.\n\nThermal power plant load is estimated to improve by 63% in FY24, fuelled by strong demand growth along with subdued capacity addition in the sector.\n\nIn the current decade (2020-29), the Indian electricity sector is likely to witness a major transformation with respect to demand growth, energy mix and market operations. India wants to ensure that everyone has reliable access to sufficient electricity at all times, while also accelerating the clean energy transition by lowering its reliance on dirty fossil fuels and moving toward more environmentally friendly, renewable sources of energy. Future investments will benefit from strong demand fundamentals, policy support and increasing government focus on infrastructure.\n\nThe Government of India is preparing a 'rent a roof' policy for supporting its target of generating 40 GW of power through solar rooftop projects by 2022. It also plans to set up 21 new nuclear power reactors with a total installed capacity of 15,700 MW by 2031.\n\nThe Central Electricity Authority (CEA) estimates India’s power requirement to grow to reach 817 GW by 2030. Also, by 2029-30, CEA estimates that the share of renewable energy generation would increase from 18% to 44%, while that of thermal energy is expected to reduce from 78% to 52%.\n\nThe government plans to establish renewable energy capacity of 500 GW by 2030."
