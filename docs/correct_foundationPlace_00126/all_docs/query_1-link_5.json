The objectives can be summarized as below: - First-hand experience and insights into implementation of distributed deep learning networks. - Thorough view of GraphLab (including descriptions of code) and the extensions required to implement these networks. - Details of how the extensions were realized/implemented in GraphLab source – they have been submitted to the community for evaluation. - Arrhythmia detection use case as an application of the large scale distributed deep learning network.\n\nReal-time Streaming Analytics: Business Value, Use Cases and Architectural Co...\n\nReal-time Streaming Analytics: Business Value, Use Cases and Architectural Co...Impetus Technologies\n\nImpetus webcast ‘Real-time Streaming Analytics: Business Value, Use Cases and Architectural Considerations’ available at http://bit.ly/1i6OrwR The webinar talks about- • How business value is preserved and enhanced using Real-time Streaming Analytics with numerous use-cases in different industry verticals • Technical considerations for IT leaders and implementation teams looking to integrate Real-time Streaming Analytics into enterprise architecture roadmap • Recommendations for making Real-time Streaming Analytics – real – in your enterprise • Impetus StreamAnalytix – an enterprise ready platform for Real-time Streaming Analytics\n\nNext generation analytics with yarn, spark and graph lab\n\nNext generation analytics with yarn, spark and graph labImpetus Technologies\n\nThis document provides an overview of next generation analytics with YARN, Spark and GraphLab. It discusses how YARN addressed limitations of Hadoop 1.0 like scalability, locality awareness and shared cluster utilization. It also describes the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) which includes Spark, and how companies like Ooyala and Conviva use it for tasks like iterative machine learning. GraphLab is presented as ideal for processing natural graphs and the PowerGraph framework partitions such graphs for better parallelism. PMML is introduced as a standard for defining predictive models, and how a Naive Bayes model can be defined and scored using PMML with Spark and Storm.\n\nThe Shared Elephant - Hadoop as a Shared Service for Multiple Departments – I...\n\nThe Shared Elephant - Hadoop as a Shared Service for Multiple Departments – I...Impetus Technologies\n\nFor Impetus’ White Papers archive, visit- http://lf1.me/drb/ This white paper talks about the design considerations for enterprises to run Hadoop as a shared service for multiple departments. As Hadoop becomes more mainstream and indispensable to enterprises, it is imperative that they build, operate and scale shared Hadoop clusters. The design considerations discussed in this paper will help enterprises accomplish the essential mission of running multi-tenant, multi-use Hadoop clusters at scale. The white paper talks about Identity, Security, Resource Sharing, Monitoring and Operations on the Central Service. For Impetus’ White Papers archive, visit- http://lf1.me/drb/"
