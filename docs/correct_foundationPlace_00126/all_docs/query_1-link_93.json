        "text": "3\n\nFuture Directions in Ocean Sciences\n\nThe possibility of and the need for studying the ocean on a global scale provide a major impetus for new partnerships in oceanography. The design and deployment of a global ocean observing system, now being discussed, will be possible only with the cooperation of ocean scientists and governments throughout the world.\n\nTHE SCIENCE OF OCEANOGRAPHY\n\nOceanography, the science of the sea, serves many purposes while deriving impetus from many sources. All of oceanography—physical, chemical, geological, and biological—is driven by scientists interested in advancing basic knowledge. Ocean scientists have made a number of exciting discoveries in the past 30 years that have changed our view of Earth. The discovery of oceanic eddies has been important for an understanding of ocean circulation, propagation of sound in the ocean, fisheries productivity, and other ocean processes. Verification by ocean drilling that Earth's crust is divided into moving plates that are created at mid-ocean ridges and recycled into Earth's interior replaced the traditional view that the surface was essentially static. Discovery of dense colonies of animals and bacteria at some deep-sea hydrothermal vents demonstrated that organisms could thrive in ecosystems based on chemical energy from Earth's interior rather\n\nthan directly on energy from the Sun. Study of the combined ocean-atmosphere system has provided sufficient knowledge of interannual climate variations that scientists are now able to forecast El Niño climate disturbances months in advance.\n\nOver the next decade, oceanography will continue to provide exciting discoveries by contributing new understanding of Earth as a system and by helping us understand how humankind is altering the system. It is now essential (and possible) to study ocean processes on a global scale. The oceanography of the next decade will take place in the traditional marine science disciplines and at the boundaries of these disciplines. New partnerships among oceanographers working in different disciplines should lead to new discoveries about the ocean's role in climate change, the function of mid-ocean ridges, and coastal ocean processes.\n\nAdditional oceanographic studies in the coming decade will focus on how ecosystems affect global cycles of important chemicals and, conversely, how changes in the global environment affect marine ecosystems. Studies of ecosystems at hydrothermal vents and hydrocarbon seeps will refine our ideas about the conditions under which life is possible and about the origins of life. More of the ocean floor must be explored to determine the extent and nature of deep-ocean vents, their ability to support novel organisms, and their importance in global chemical cycles. Continued study of the ocean's chemistry should bring new understanding of the past state of Earth, how ocean processes operate today, and the contribution of sources and sinks of various chemicals. The study of deep-ocean sediment cores will provide more information about past natural cycles of Earth's climate, with which present climate fluctuations can be compared. Oceanographers will achieve a better understanding of the variability of the circulation of the world ocean. The interaction of climate with this circulation is only poorly known, but there is evidence that the transport of surface water to depth can vary greatly even over as short a time as one decade.\n\nUnlike many other sciences driven by scientific curiosity, aspects of marine science have immediate and obvious practical applications. These include, but are not limited to, the control of climate by ocean circulation, chemical and biological reactions to climate change, understanding fisheries productivity, movement of pollutants, and the problem of coastal development in the face of rising sea level. Oceanographers are fortunate to take part in a science that is fascinating, compelling, and intellectually challenging. Oceanography is also a science whose outcome is of\n\nimmediate societal application and in which the financial stakes are potentially immense, for example, the economic impact of a reliable forecast of a sea-level rise. Because the societal implications of the science are readily apparent to policy makers, they may demand answers to purely practical questions in the short term. This pressure can distort the investment in basic science, undermining the quest for basic understanding that remains key to the long-term solution of practical problems. Thus the functioning of oceanography in the United States should focus both on sustenance of the underlying basic science and on specific answers to practical questions of short-term urgency.\n\nThis chapter summarizes the concerns of basic scientists, with some focus on the interaction of basic science with more practical problems. Several themes are common throughout the discussion, which is divided by classical disciplines. First is the growing sense that the basic science now encompasses the global ocean scale. This capability and the need to conduct global-scale studies have led to the planning of large-scale, long-term cooperative experiments. Primarily planned and executed with National Science Foundation (NSF) support, they focus the work of many scientists on global ocean research. These large programs are usually managed through national or international consortia that involve many scientists, agencies, and often countries. Such programs will explore new questions and test new mechanisms for working together in the next decade. Global uncertainties are rapidly moving much of oceanography from the capabilities and interests of single or small groups of investigators for a limited time to the involvement of many individuals, institutions, and governments for decades. Mechanisms must be developed for these new large-scale efforts to be sustained in a scientifically and technically sound manner, by coordinating the plans of other nations, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual scientists.\n\nSecond, all sections of this chapter emphasize the dependence of the subject as a whole continued technical developments. The ocean is remarkably difficult to study, given its size, opacity to electromagnetic waves, and general hostility (e.g, its corrosiveness, high pressures, and turbulence). The health of all disciplines depends directly on the continued development of new tools designed to solve their fundamental sampling problems. In the past decade, oceanographic sampling improved through incorporation of new technologies from other fields, such as remote sensing, material science, electronics, and computer science. A fundamental change arising from the use of these new technologies is\n\nan increase in the quality and the volume of data collected. Accompanying this change is a significant increase in each oceanographer's capacity to study ocean phenomena, an increase that raises the costs for each oceanographer's science. As the cost per oceanographer for scientific equipment and facilities has increased, the field has responded with increased sharing of facilities, such as ships and submersibles, and equipment, such as the new accelerator mass spectrometer for carbon-14 measurements. The development and shared use of expensive facilities are likely to continue in the future. Yet even with shared facilities, inflation-adjusted research funding for the ocean sciences has remained nearly constant over the past decade, while the number of Ph.D.-level academic oceanographers has increased by about 50 percent and societal pressures to predict man's effect on the ocean have also increased. The growth in the scientific capacity of each investigator and the number of qualified investigators, coupled with nearly constant funding, has resulted in partial funding for some ocean researchers.\n\nThird, the resolution requirements of oceanographic models and the complexity of model physics have always outstripped the largest computational capability anywhere. As understanding of the ocean becomes more sophisticated, more sophisticated models are required. The nurture of computational capability is reflected across the disciplines.\n\nFourth, the understanding of the ocean and of the problems of oceanographers has progressed so much in the past several decades that all disciplines are now capable of new accomplishments in a seemingly endless number of areas. The problem is that the potential far exceeds the resources likely to be available, and the difficult task of setting priorities within and across disciplines will be amplified.\n\nThe foundation of knowledge about the ocean that is now used in policy decisions was gained largely through Office of Naval Research (ONR) and NSF investments in basic research over the past several decades. Yet the demand for quick answers to purely practical questions sometimes obscures the need for investing in basic science, which remains the key to long-term practical applications. Under pressure to provide immediate solutions, mission agencies may be tempted to focus only on the short term. One example of the importance of basic research is a 1961 study that is now contributing to the debate about climate change—the question of whether ocean circulation has two stable states. Both the geological record and numerical models suggest that, at some times\n\nin the past, ocean circulation was unlike today's and that it could switch rapidly from its present state to a radically different one. When the ocean was in this alternate state, Earth's climate was not at all like today's. This idea dates back to a paper written by Henry Stommel (1961), an academic scientist driven primarily by his own curiosity and supported by ONR and NSF. The paper had little impact for more than 20 years. Now regarded as seminal, it illustrates the need to sustain basic science so that future generations will have a knowledge base from which to develop their policy decisions.\n\nThe authors of the following sections were asked to discuss the dominant issues of their disciplines and to lay out the grand themes, providing a scientific underpinning to discussion of the new partnerships. Ten years is probably the outer limit of an attempt to suggest what the major science themes will be. A decadal report written in 1960 would almost surely have missed the revolution in plate tectonics and thus would have been hopelessly wrong in its discussion of some dominant scientific themes in 1970. On the other hand, such a report could have captured accurately the methodologies of work at sea and the human resource requirements. Of course, the central questions of the field did not change either—although an intellectual revolution in the way they could be discussed occurred.\n\nThe decision to organize this chapter according to traditional oceanographic disciplines was not arbitrary (the coastal ocean is a special case, discussed below). Anyone who reads each section will perceive exciting and important scientific problems that cut across many or even all disciplines. Examples are the growing importance of paleoceanographic studies that involve geology, geophysics, chemistry, biology, and physical oceanography because of their climate implications. Likewise, the study of ridge crests cuts across geology and geophysics, biology and chemistry, and even slightly, physical oceanography. Nonetheless, the board believes that there is a danger in declaring such interdisciplinary studies as the likely focus of future marine science efforts. Without denigrating the science done on such problems, interdisciplinary studies clearly build on the foundations of chemistry, physics, geology, geophysics, and biology. These, in turn, depend directly on their nonmarine counterparts of physics, mathematics, numerical methods, and other fields that provide the intellectual fertilization of marine studies. The history of ocean sciences suggests that one cannot have good interdisciplinary science without good disciplinary foundations, and it is essential that the traditional\n\noceanographic disciplines retain their identity and vitality. One needs to encourage scientists working on interdisciplinary problems, but they must first be expert in one or more of the basic disciplines. Just how such fostering should take place is the subject of debate, and the reader will detect a degree of disagreement as to how we should move forward. Working out various combinations of scientists and institutions is a major challenge for our academic institutions in the next decade. The board makes no specific recommendation except to note that the strength of the U.S. scientific community is its ability to tolerate and encourage great diversity in its institutions.\n\nBecause the following sections were written by a number of different authors, they differ in style and content. The sections are not meant to be all inclusive but instead to provide a flavor of the excitement of each discipline of oceanography.\n\nThe treatment here of coastal oceanography is anomalous because it deals with a geographic region—that is, shorelines, estuaries, bays, and the continental shelf—and not a discipline. The large percentage of the U.S. and world population that lives in the coastal zone, and the multiple human uses and impacts on the coastal ocean, place this area of oceanography much more conspicuously and immediately in the public policy arena. Unlike the participants in deep-water marine science, states, cities, and private enterprise are all prominent players in understanding and using the coastal ocean. The interplay of the basic sciences of fluid flow, chemistry, biology, shoreline physics, and geology with public policy concerns leads to a near-term urgency that cuts across scientific disciplines. However, it is important to recognize, as this report does, that the foundations of understanding must rest firmly on the underlying basic sciences.\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY\n\nSummary\n\nThe great volume of water in the ocean exerts a powerful influence on the Earth's climate by absorbing, storing, transporting, and releasing heat, water, and trace gases. The goal of physical oceanography is to develop a quantitative understanding of the ocean's physical processes, including circulation, mixing, waves, and fluxes of energy, momentum, and chemical substances within the ocean and across its boundaries. Addressing such problems will require sustained large-scale observations of the world ocean\n\naided by advances in measurement and computational technology. Designing and deploying a global ocean observing system are among the most important and difficult tasks for physical oceanography and climate studies for the next decade. Such a system would incorporate existing measurement programs as well as observations that are not yet routine.\n\nSeveral topics will dominate physical oceanographic research in the coming decade. Research in modeling, ocean mixing, thermohaline circulation, and water mass formation processes will be important. To achieve their scientific objectives and to make more complete ocean observations, physical oceanographers must use both proven methods and new technologies, including acoustic techniques; measurements made from volunteer observing ships; satellite observations and data relay; and measurements of the distributions of trace chemicals.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe ocean consists of nearly 1.4 billion cubic kilometers of salty water, about 97 percent of the free water on Earth. In comparison, the atmosphere holds only about 0.001 percent. This volume of water exerts a powerful influence on Earth's climate by transporting heat, water, and other climate-relevant properties around the globe and by exchanging these properties, as well as greenhouse gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons), with the atmosphere. Net ocean absorption of greenhouse gases and some greenhouse-induced heat from the atmosphere can delay greenhouse warming of the atmosphere. Predicting future climate conditions depends on learning what controls ocean circulation and water mass formation, and whether the system is predictable, even in principle.\n\nPhysical oceanography, like many fields of science, consists of theory, observations, and numerical models. Physical oceanographic theories use the equations of fluid dynamics, modified to account for Earth's rotation and shape (e.g., O'Brien, 1985). A goal of physical oceanography is to develop a quantitative understanding of the ocean circulation, including fluxes—of energy, momentum, and chemical substances—within the ocean and across its boundaries. Physical oceanographers must contribute to the increasing societal emphasis on measuring, predicting, and planning for changes in global climate by improving understanding of the physical factors that maintain the overall physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the ocean. Advances in measurement and com-\n\nputational technology will continue to contribute to advances in physical oceanography.\n\nStudies of climate change put the skills of oceanographers to a severe test. The time scales are long: interannual, decadal, and beyond. Physical processes are three dimensional and involve interaction of the ocean with the atmosphere. Winds transfer momentum and promote mixing and evaporation. Atmospheric temperature influences the density of ocean surface layers through effects on seawater temperature and salinity (through ice formation and melting), which in turn modify the atmosphere. Development of the physical state of the ocean is difficult to model because it involves the complex interaction of processes that operate on vastly different time and space scales. Nonetheless, progress is being made. Techniques that will permit better and more frequent observations are being developed, and advances in numerical modeling will soon permit representation of the major components of ocean circulation.\n\nOcean observations reflect the state of the ocean and hence the forces acting on it. Because observations are made in a corrosive, turbulent environment with high pressures at depth, they are difficult and expensive to obtain. Because of the size and variability of the ocean, measurements are always incomplete in space and time. Yet understanding the ocean depends on adequate measurements, and to make them we need to use technologies that permit a view of the global ocean. Technologies based on acoustics, space-based remote sensing, and underway automatic measurements could all be applied to global-scale observations.\n\nPredictions of the ocean can be carried out only when the initial and boundary conditions are provided from observations with an accuracy and precision consistent with the physics present. Because oceanic observations are so expensive, models and theories must be used to help determine the most cost-effective measurements and measurement systems.\n\nGlobal Ocean Observing System\n\nPhysical oceanographic observations and modeling are becoming global, but the resources required to deploy and sustain large-scale observations of the world ocean are enormous. The exact configuration of a global ocean observing system is unknown, but it would probably include existing observations from satellites, moored open ocean sensors, volunteer observing ships, and the global sea-level network, as well as other observations that are\n\nnot yet defined or collected routinely. The scientific and technological results from several ongoing large-scale research programs—the Tropical Ocean-Global Atmosphere program, the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study—should be used to design an operational observation system that is effective, affordable, and consistent with our knowledge of the scales of ocean biology, chemistry, and physics. It would be the largest field enterprise ever undertaken by the oceanographic community, and it must have an international and multidisciplinary scope well beyond previous experience. The design and implementation of a global ocean observing system (GOOS) must involve ocean scientists substantially because the design is extremely important to the science itself and depends on firm scientific understanding. Designing and deploying a GOOS is one of the most important and difficult tasks for physical oceanography and climate studies in the next decade. The United States should take a major leadership role in both the research and the operations.\n\nBecause of the present paucity of ocean data, numerical models are important in the development of a GOOS. Models will be used to interpret available data for testing possible system designs and, ultimately, to interpret the data from such a system.\n\nMajor Research Topics for the Coming Decade\n\nSeveral topics will dominate physical oceanographic research in the coming decade. The list is incomplete; the topics mentioned received some emphasis during the Ocean Studies Board workshops as representing key research issues and include the following: research in modeling; ocean mixing, including interior mixing and the surface mixed layer; thermohaline circulation; and heat and freshwater fluxes.\n\nOcean Modeling\n\nThe central focus of numerical modeling of the ocean has been, and continues to be, directed toward fluid dynamics, but the models have importance far beyond physical oceanography. For example, communities of organisms in the upper ocean live in a delicate balance, depending on the stability of the water column, its mixing rates, and its large-scale vertical and horizontal fluid movements. Our limited ability to predict the movements of the upper ocean limits understanding of basic biological processes.\n\nThe transfer of gases between atmosphere and ocean is central to the carbon cycle; this transfer relies on many scales of circulation and mixing.\n\nCombined atmosphere-ocean simulations at interannual time scales require more accurate ocean models. The present generation of coupled atmosphere-ocean models exhibits unacceptable drifts (Manabe and Stouffer, 1988). Climate forecast models must be free of even small systemic errors that accumulate over long simulated periods, hiding the signals that are sought. To understand and mimic the paleoceanographic record, a major test of global models, one must be able to carry model integrations over time scales corresponding to thousands or tens of thousands of years. It is not clear that ocean and atmosphere behavior is predictable on scales of decades or longer. The limits of predictability are being explored as a research topic.\n\nThe global ocean is so large and its circulation occurs over such a variety of space (tens to thousands of kilometers) and time (days to centuries) scales that ocean circulation modeling has always overwhelmed even the largest supercomputers. This situation will probably remain for some decades to come. Thus it is a major intellectual challenge to design models of ocean circulation with time and space increments small enough to model processes adequately, given foreseeable limitations in computing resources.\n\nProminent features and processes that must be incorporated more accurately into physical oceanographic models (in a manner consistent with observations) include the effects of complex bottom topography on deep-water masses, deep vertical and horizontal mixing, eddies and fronts in the upper ocean, the interaction of water flow and diffusion of a variety of properties, boundary effects at the seafloor and surface, and the dynamics of shallow and deep boundary currents.\n\nOcean Mixing\n\nInterior Mixing Large-scale ocean circulation is coupled with, and partially controlled by, small-scale mixing processes. Understanding the places, rates, and mechanisms by which the ocean mixes heat, salt, and momentum is crucial to understanding the circulation of the largest scales and essential to any capability to predict future oceanic states. It is intimidating to realize that to understand the dynamics of large-scale circulation and convective water mass formation, we must also understand the physics acting on the smallest scales (centimeters and millimeters). Heat-\n\ning, cooling, flow, and mixing processes act together to determine physical properties of the ocean. Changes in any one of these processes can affect the global climate system. Significant progress in the observation of ocean mixing processes and in the interpretation of these observations has been made, but understanding remains inadequate.\n\nThe capability to compare direct mixing measurements (through microstructure and purposeful tracer releases) with natural mixing (estimated indirectly from natural tracer distributions) is rapidly accelerating our understanding of mixing processes (Watson and Ledwell, 1988). The results of such comparisons will direct future research. For example, if deep-sea observations confirm that mixing rates are lower than predicted, attention will focus on mixing processes in the benthic boundary layer and continental slopes. If tracer studies indicate significantly more mixing than is seen by direct measurement, double diffusive and other mechanisms, will be explored. With new observational techniques and a clear measurement strategy, significant progress can be expected in the coming decade in the study of ocean mixing.\n\nSurface Mixed Layer The primary production that supports the entire marine food web occurs in the upper sunlit portion of the ocean (the euphotic zone), where photosynthesis occurs. Our growing concern for climate variation makes understanding the uptake of carbon dioxide related to photosynthesis of particular importance. Fortunately, several developments over the last few years in biological oceanography, marine chemistry, and ocean physics promise advances in the study of the biological-chemical cycles in the euphotic zone. Exploitation of new techniques could significantly improve our ability to predict various aspects of global environmental change, including the ocean's role in sequestering carbon dioxide.\n\nThe topmost layer of the ocean is called the ''mixed layer\" because the waters are mixed by wind, waves, and currents. This layer is often nearly homogeneous in temperature and chemical characteristics, and is bounded by the sea surface and a layer of denser water. The transfer of gases between atmosphere and ocean depends primarily on mixed-layer processes. Understanding the physics of the ocean surface mixed layer, and its coupling with the ocean interior and the atmosphere, is essential if the combined biogeochemical systems of ocean and atmosphere are to be represented correctly in ocean models. Mixed-layer studies are among the endeavors of physical oceanography in which strong\n\ninteraction with the fields of biology and chemistry is particularly rewarding. The rates of heat, water, gas, and momentum exchange across the ocean-atmosphere interface must be estimated better from easily measured or calculated environmental parameters (e.g., wind, temperature differences across the air-sea interface, waves, and stability of the mixed layer).\n\nBecause photosynthesis involves the conversion of carbon dioxide and nutrients into living material and oxygen, the euphotic zone is an immediate sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The flow and mixing of water masses and the transport of nutrients and particles that control phytoplankton populations depend on physical oceanographic processes. Understanding the mixed layer is a complex problem involving studies in marine biology, chemistry, and physics. In a crude sense, the mixed layer can be regarded as controlled by a set of chemical reactions in which biological processes determine most of the reaction rates (nutrient fixation and regeneration) and physical processes (advection, mixing, and particle sinking) determine the rates at which reactants and products are provided to or removed from the system.\n\nThe physical oceanographer's approach to studying the surface mixed layer involves measurement of currents and horizontal variations to determine advection, microstructure measurements to study turbulent fluxes, and measurements of deeper properties to infer vertical flows. Chemical oceanographers study the latter process using time-dependent tracers to estimate the vertical path of water masses and observe changes along it. Both methods can be strengthened by a model that integrates the measurements.\n\nThermohaline Circulation In a few limited regions of the ocean, a combination of low temperature and high salinity produces dense surface water that flows into the deep ocean and spreads laterally to initiate global-scale thermohaline circulation. Deep-reaching convection occurs in the northern North Atlantic Ocean and around Antarctica. These water masses spread throughout the ocean and force deep ocean water, which has been made more buoyant by the downward diffusion of heat, to upwell slowly. Eventually, the upwelled water migrates back to the sinking regions to complete a thermohaline circulation cell (see Gordon et al., 1992). Water masses formed in different regions vary in terms of temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, and stored carbon content. The relative contribution from each source region determines the ocean's average temperature, salinity, and other properties, such as carbon storage. In addition, this downward flow of surface water pro-\n\nvides a link between the atmosphere and the deep ocean. Thus a better understanding of the global climate system requires a detailed understanding of the thermohaline circulation, its vulnerability to change, and the processes that govern water mass formation rates. Once these factors are understood, they can be represented in global ocean and climate models.\n\nThere is evidence that surface salinity fluctuations in the high-latitude North Atlantic Ocean control the thermohaline circulation by altering North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation. One possible mechanism to slow NADW formation is capping of the ocean surface with low-salinity water, such as Arctic Ocean waters (Weyl, 1968). During the last century, there were at least two episodes of low surface salinity water in the northern North Atlantic Ocean [the latter during the late 1960s and 1970s is referred to as the great salinity anomaly (Dickson et al., 1988)] that drastically reduced or stopped convection and NADW production. Changes in the twentieth century are very small compared to suspected changes in NADW formation rates during the swings between glacial and interglacial periods (Boyle, 1990).\n\nThe Indian Ocean is a strongly evaporative ocean. Lacking a northern polar region, the tropical heating of the Indian Ocean cannot be vented by flow to the north. Strong evaporation in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf forms warm salty water that, like the Mediterranean outflow, is small in volume but adds significant heat and salt to the deep ocean. The role of the Indian Ocean in larger-scale thermohaline circulation remains unclear and should be studied in the coming years.\n\nThe sea ice cover of the Southern Ocean acts to decouple the ocean from the atmosphere, limiting cooling of the ocean by the polar atmosphere. The insulating blanket of sea ice protects the ocean from the cold atmosphere. The extreme seasonality and rapid spring melting of the Southern Ocean sea ice cover suggest that the heat carried into the surface layer by the upwelling of deep water is a key in understanding the Southern Ocean sea ice budget; the buildup of heat within the mixed layer under the winter ice cover induces melting even before solar radiation melts the ice from above. Ocean heat flux also limits sea ice thickness during the winter to less than 1 meter, in contrast to the 3-meter ice of the more stable Arctic Ocean.\n\nHeat and Freshwater Fluxes The ocean interacts with the atmosphere in affecting the heat and freshwater fluxes that control the climate system. Estimates of the fluxes to and from the ocean\n\nand atmosphere are difficult to obtain with adequate accuracy, and at the present time there are serious conflicts among values estimated from atmospheric models and data, from oceanic models and data, and from the boundary layers in the two media.\n\nThe ocean and atmosphere contribute roughly equally to the transport of heat from lower latitudes toward the polar regions—a transport that is required to maintain the global radiation balance at the top of the atmosphere—although the relative importance of the two transport mechanisms varies with latitude. The massive amounts of water moving in the ocean render it a crucial transporter of moisture, but we have little idea of the sizes of freshwater sources and sinks over the ocean (Baumgartner and Reichel, 1975). Their distribution must have profound effects on the distribution of rainfall over land, an important component of the climate in habitable regions of the world. Low surface salinity caps the ocean, attenuating convection and deep-reaching water mass formation. High surface salinity, combined with surface cooling, allows deep convection and ventilation of the interior of the ocean.\n\nWe need to monitor changes in ocean surface salinity globally. Satellite sensors monitor sea surface temperature and its anomalies, but monitoring sea surface salinity and its anomalies on a global scale is beyond present capabilities, as is determination of the temperature below the very surface.\n\nOver the last decade, oceanographers have begun making direct estimates of the north-south ocean heat and freshwater transports using transoceanic hydrographic sections and modern measurements of strong boundary currents and then comparing them with the more uncertain indirect estimates based on atmospheric data. To understand heat and freshwater transport fully, oceanographers must describe the general ocean circulation and its variability. It is discouraging, however, that since 1985, only six transoceanic hydrographic sections, the backbone of the observations needed to determine the north-south fluxes, have been carried out: at 47°, 24°, and 10° north latitude in the Pacific; 32° south latitude in the Indian Ocean; and 11° north latitude in the Atlantic. Overcoming organizational and funding obstacles for these long hydrographic sections takes major effort by individual scientists. However, WOCE has plans to make the necessary measurements for determining the ocean heat transport in each ocean basin at several latitudes (WOCE Scientific Steering Group, 1986). This work is a central focus of WOCE and is clearly needed if understanding of how the present climate system works is to progress.\n\nProvision for continuing such observation beyond the end of WOCE is essential.\n\nMethods\n\nTo achieve their scientific objectives, physical oceanographers must use both proven methods and new technologies to make more complete ocean observations.\n\nVolunteer Observing Ships The maritime industry is a resource for ocean research and monitoring that can no longer be viewed as simply an adjunct to the academic research fleet. On the contrary, its integration into a global ocean observing system would provide far greater and more frequent access to the ocean than will ever be possible with research vessels alone.\n\nVolunteer observing ships (VOS) offer opportunities to study and monitor the ocean with a coverage and frequency that are unthinkable by any other means. With the advent of new and more sophisticated remote sensing techniques, such as ocean color scanners, altimeters, and scatterometers, it is plausible that the demand for direct observations will increase, for several reasons. First, the need for calibration measurements will grow. Second, the ocean color scanner will observe numerous signals that require in situ samples for identification, interpretation, and analysis. Third, as coverage of the ocean surface improves, a concomitant need for improved subsurface coverage is inevitable.\n\nWithout doubt, a major impediment to the use of VOS is the lack of automated instrumentation for nonscientists on moving commercial ships. Most instruments are designed for trained personnel on research vessels equipped with laboratories. A new approach to the VOS concept is needed. It will require discussions and planning with the maritime industry internationally to develop new modes of cooperation. The community must think of VOS as a potential platform, and ship operators must be persuaded that oceanographic work is to their benefit. At the same time, the development of instrumentation optimized for use on VOS must be encouraged, including the following:\n\nModern sensor packages are needed that can be dropped and retrieved repeatedly along a ship's route to measure salinity, oxygen, and fluorescence (primarily from phytoplankton). Data obtained by the sensors could be transferred to a small on-board computer for analysis and transmission to data centers.\n\nDisposable free-falling sensor packages should be developed\n\nthat travel to great depths and transmit their data via acoustic signals or return to the surface and broadcast to satellites. Sensor packages could transmit data for any ocean observation that can be measured in situ. Disposable sensor packages can transmit data via a thin wire that detaches when the sensor reaches its maximum depth, but free-falling sensors could travel much deeper and measure more accurately than present devices.\n\nVOS could tow instruments to measure various ocean characteristics. When ship routes and sampling locations coincide, passing ships could retrieve data from moored instruments (e.g., moored current meters and inverted echo sounders) by acoustic signals. At the least, commercial ships equipped with acoustic Doppler current profilers could measure upper ocean currents and heat fluxes routinely.\n\nRemote Sensing by Satellite Satellites observe vast areas of the ocean surface daily, obtaining data at a far faster rate than surface vessels and instruments (e.g., Stewart, 1985). Satellites also aid physical oceanography by transmitting data gathered by in situ ocean sensors combined with highly accurate positioning information. The availability of surface and subsurface instruments has greatly increased the volume of data beyond that possible from ship-based observations, and the instruments provide valuable time-series data.\n\nSatellite sensors are used to map natural infrared and microwave radiation emitted from the sea surface. Infrared radiation provides images of sea surface temperature patterns. Radiation in the microwave frequencies is used to map sea ice distribution in areas of the globe that are otherwise poorly accessible. Phytoplankton blooms can be monitored from space with sensors that respond to the visible and near-infrared radiation reflected by plankton chlorophyll, integrating the effects of temperature, nutrients, and the physical structures and processes of the ocean surface layer. Suspended sediment is also measured by visible sensors. Surface winds are measured by satellite scatterometers. The sea surface slope can be measured from space by radar altimeters with accuracies adequate for determining many features of ocean circulation. This is the only practicable method for global-scale continuous observation of circulation. Synthetic aperture radar on satellites can measure sea state, internal waves, and ice conditions with very high spatial resolution.\n\nAlthough satellite data yield a nearly continuous view of the ocean, it is important to note that complementary in situ obser-\n\nvations from ships or instrumented drifters are required to improve the mathematical relationships (algorithms) for calibrating satellite observations to in situ values.\n\nA suite of satellites launched by the United States, the European Space Agency, and Japan and with many joint satellite missions should provide many data required by physical oceanographers during the next decade. Advances in physical oceanography are tied closely with satellite views of the ocean and telemetry of data from Earth's surface. Coordination of satellite projects with ocean science objectives and in situ ocean measurements is required. The satellite time series of sea surface temperature, winds, sea ice, ocean color, and ocean height must be continued without interruption to provide a complete record of their variability.\n\nTracers Distribution of ocean properties can be used to depict the pattern of ocean currents and the effects of mixing within the ocean because water masses from different source regions vary in their physical and chemical signatures. Traditionally, temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nutrient concentrations have been used to track the movement or spreading of ocean water masses. Other more exotic chemicals present in minute concentrations (tracers) are now commonly used to track water masses. For example, chlorofluorocarbons, carbon-14 and tritium from atmospheric nuclear bomb testing, and other natural and synthetic substances with known rates and times of input to the atmosphere have been used as tracers. Tracers average the spreading action of ocean circulation at a variety of scales and integrate the effects of many processes. The infiltration of naturally occurring and synthetic chemical tracers into the ocean provides insight about the time scales of ocean circulation and mixing. The development of baseline time series of tracer concentrations is important.\n\nAcoustic Techniques Because the ocean is transparent to sound but opaque to light, acoustic techniques provide oceanographers with the opportunity to see the interior of the ocean. In a real sense, the hydrophone array serves as the underwater eyes and ears of the oceanographer. The enormous bandwidth of available underwater acoustic instrumentation (10-3 to 106 hertz) allows sound to be used as a probe of structures and processes whose scales range from millimeters to ocean basin scales. The ocean is especially transparent to low-frequency sound. Consequently, underwater sound is becoming an important means of studying the three-dimensional structure of the ocean below its surface. Continuous measurements of current velocity from shipboard acoustic\n\nsensors give a two-dimensional record of ocean currents to several hundred meters. Acoustic techniques are also used to track subsurface floats and transmit information between ships and sensors at depth. Yet, sound is an underemployed tool in oceanography. Significant advances should be made during the next decade in physical, biological, and geological oceanography as a result of thoughtful application of acoustic principles and techniques for direct probing and information transfer. Because of its inherent global nature, the acoustic monitoring of ocean climate is a strong candidate for a global ocean observing system.\n\nThe air-sea interface provides a variety of challenges and opportunities to the oceanographer using acoustic techniques. The formation and subsequent collapse of bubbles are important sources of sound whose monitoring could provide an estimate of wave breaking intensity from which gas transfer rates could be inferred. Such measurements give important insight into poorly understood sea surface physics. The passive measurement of rainfall-generated sound is a way to measure precipitation in the open ocean. Direct measurement of precipitation is difficult to obtain and generally inaccurate. Better measurements of precipitation over the ocean are important because of its effect on the global heat and water budgets.\n\nSome of the oceanographic applications of underwater sound are simple. Others will require improvements in our understanding of the physics of sound propagation in the sea and improved signal processing techniques and instrumentation.\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR MARINE GEOCHEMISTRY\n\nSummary\n\nStudies of chemicals dissolved in seawater, adsorbed on suspended particles, incorporated in living or nonliving organic material, and buried in seafloor sediments have yielded much information about Earth processes and past conditions. Environmental conditions are imprinted on particles that fall to the seafloor and are buried over time. With adequate understanding about processes that affect chemical concentrations and forms after deposition, sediments recovered by seafloor drilling can illuminate Earth's environmental history for millions of years into the past. In addition, modern ocean processes can be studied by measuring the concentrations of trace elements and compounds in seawater. For example, measurement of trace element distributions is a major tool used by physical oceanographers to study ocean circulation.\n\nThe ocean is a chemical reactor, with inputs, internal reactions, and outputs. Inputs are received from continents via rivers and airborne transport. Other chemicals enter the ocean from hydrothermal sources, primarily at mid-ocean ridges. As oceanic crust is subducted beneath continents, elements are expelled from both the crust and its overlying sediment layer. Finally, a minor proportion of input to the ocean comes from cosmic sources. Inputs are the least understood part of the reactor.\n\nElements are redistributed in the ocean by circulation and mixing, and are transformed through chemical reactions and biological activity. Chemicals finally exit the reactor through incorporation into seafloor sediments. The residence time of chemicals in seawater and in the sediments depends on properties of the chemicals, as well as chemical, physical, and biological conditions. Chemical oceanographers seek to understand the present reactor and then, from examination of changes in the outputs over time, determine variations in the reactor's behavior and the compositions and fluxes of inputs in the past. With this information, the limits of future oceanic changes under given climatic and tectonic scenarios can be estimated.\n\nFuture studies in chemical oceanography will be aided by new instruments that are capable of analyzing a wide variety of elements and isotopes contained in small samples. Greater knowledge of processes controlling fluxes, redistribution, and removal, and improvements in our ability to read the sedimentary record are likely in the coming decade.\n\nIntroduction\n\nMarine geochemistry integrates several oceanographic disciplines. The aims of marine geochemistry are (1) to understand the inputs of elements from the continents, mantle, and cosmic sources into the ocean over time; (2) to understand the process of material removal from the ocean to the sediments and oceanic crust; (3) to understand the process by which elements and their isotopes are redistributed; (4) to determine the mechanisms of chemical coupling between the ocean and the atmosphere, and interpret the sedimentary record of past oceanic change; and (5) to study marine organic compounds both in their relation to the above factors and to the global carbon cycle, and as detectors of oceanographic properties over time.\n\nOceanic sediments record environmental events over the past 180 million years of Earth's history. Ocean water in which sedi-\n\nment particles are formed or through which they pass is both an agent of transport and the site where information about environmental conditions is imprinted onto components that eventually become part of marine sediments. Geochemical signatures in the sediments complement the sedimentological and paleontologic record in special ways. Oxygen and carbon isotopes in marine calcareous shells or tests and organic remains provide insight into ocean surface temperatures, ocean circulation, and the extent of ice storage in past glaciations. Trace elements such as cadmium and barium add to our understanding of deep-ocean circulation and upwelling. Isotopes produced by cosmic rays, those originating from uranium decay, and those produced or enhanced by human activities, provide information on chronology, sediment properties, oceanic upwelling, deep-water formation, and transport of elements. The unique properties of the isotope ratios 87Sr/86Sr, 206Pb/207Pb, 143Nd/144Nd, and 187Os/186Os permit insights into the geologic questions of plate tectonics because the isotopic composition of seawater reflects the isotopic composition and relative importance of each source, for example, material derived from the mantle and continental rock weathering.\n\nAlthough present in greatly diluted concentrations, marine organic substances play a key role in the global carbon cycle as modulators and tracers of oceanic processes. For example, organic remains account for approximately 20 percent of all carbon buried in marine sediments and thus are an important sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide. The burial of organic matter and its subsequent oxidation essentially control atmospheric oxygen levels over geologic time. Dissolved organic matter in seawater may contain a mass of carbon comparable to that in terrestrial biomass and could potentially affect atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations on a time scale of a thousand years—the ocean's turnover time. In addition, organic molecules in particulate and dissolved forms are important vehicles for the transport of reducing power, nutrients, and trace elements throughout the ocean and across the air-sea and sea-sediment interfaces. Organic molecules in the marine environment are couriers of unique information about the sources, pathways, and histories of the associated particles and water.\n\nThe Ocean Reactor\n\nThe ocean receives dissolved and particulate material from a variety of sources and pathways. Traditionally, river inputs were\n\nregarded as the major contributor of dissolved material. Wind transport of dust was recognized as adding to the particle flux borne by streams, and the input of altered volcanic material to deep-sea sediments was clearly identified by the 1960s. Within the past 15 years, deep-sea hydrothermal activity, predominantly at spreading centers, was found to be important as both a source and a sink of elements. In addition, a significant flux of dissolved material may be expelled from sedimentary wedges and underlying oceanic crust as they descend into the mantle through subduction zones. Cosmic dust and cosmic ray-produced nuclides are not a major input to the ocean in terms of volume, but are important as tracers and for understanding episodic influxes of significance to the history of our planet.\n\nElements are redistributed within the ocean in dissolved form by horizontal and vertical advection, diffusive mixing, and incorporation into particles. Chemical species are removed from the ocean as particles settle to the seafloor; they also react directly with the seafloor as the result of diffusion and circulation through sediments and the oceanic crust. Seafloor sediments and altered rocks undergo secondary reactions over time, and their composition may change substantially. From a chemical point of view then, the oceans are a large chemical reactor with multiple feeds and outputs. Chemical oceanographers want to understand the present reactor and then, from examination of changes in the outputs over time, determine variations in the reactor's behavior and the compositions and fluxes of inputs in the past. With this information, the limits of future oceanic changes under given climatic and tectonic scenarios can be estimated.\n\nGeochemical study of the oceanic water column and the output of elements to the sediments is now relatively mature. The descriptive phase is largely complete, and studies of mechanisms are growing more numerous. For inputs of elements to the ocean, however, quantitative research is difficult and, in the case of inputs from the continents, may not correctly reflect disturbances in terrestrial inputs caused by humankind. These disturbances have occurred on time scales of a few years to several centuries, and the ocean has not yet equilibrated to the altered inputs.\n\nFluxes\n\nQuantitative measurement of river inputs is difficult because measurements of fluid discharge from rivers are uneven in quality, frequency, and distribution. Because the best data are avail-\n\nable from developed regions of the world, they do not necessarily represent areas less impacted by human activities.\n\nMany of these same uncertainties apply to airborne inputs. Transport is strongly seasonal and diffuse, and thus is difficult to measure. Wind erosion rates are sensitive to the nature of the land cover and therefore to changes in land use. Windborne particles efficiently scavenge volatile chemicals released to the atmosphere by volcanism, biomass burning, and industrial activities. Thus the chemical composition of windborne dust is sensitive to pollution. In addition, photochemical reactions occur in the atmosphere, changing the chemistry of the atmosphere and particle-bound chemicals.\n\nHydrothermal activity in the deep sea is driven by volcanic processes in the oceanic crust, predominantly at spreading centers. Seawater seeps into crustal rocks, entering convection cells in the rocks, and is heated to 300 to 400°C. In the course of this circulation, elements in the seawater react with the hot basaltic rocks; some chemicals are removed (e.g., magnesium, sulfate, and uranium) and others are added (e.g., mobile elements and gases). The fluxes of elements at any one site are difficult to quantify, and it is not feasible to measure the thousands of sites that differ in rock temperature and composition. To account for observed isotope concentrations in seawater (e.g., strontium), a volume of water equal to the world's ocean must circulate through the hydrothermal system at temperatures above 325°C every 10 million years. However, estimates of hydrothermal circulation based on heat lost in the formation of the oceanic crust are about five times lower. If the higher estimate for hydrothermal circulation is correct, this process is as important as rivers for the input of many elements to the ocean. Hydrothermal processes would stabilize seawater composition and thus act as a geochemical flywheel, potentially damping large-scale changes induced by long-term climatic and tectonic changes. Yet, if the lower estimate of hydrothermal circulation is correct, hydrothermal activity is a minor factor in the cycling of ocean elements and is important for only a few. The major inconsistency between the fluxes based on isotopic and thermal constraints, apparent since the first hot springs were found in the deep sea 15 years ago, remains to be resolved.\n\nThere is evidence that hydrothermal circulation at relatively low temperatures (a few tens of degrees) away from spreading centers may also be important for fluxes of elements. However, it is not yet possible to calculate even the vaguest estimate of the chemical fluxes involved. Recent seafloor exploration and ocean\n\ndrilling show that the ocean crust and its overlying sediment expel water in the subduction process. Given the great compositional and tectonic diversity of active subduction zones, it will be impossible to estimate the geochemical significance of these processes to the oceanic element cycles until much more exploratory work has been done.\n\nRedistribution\n\nAll the inputs will react with seawater. Reaction processes in the zone of mixing between river water and the upper ocean are quite well described qualitatively. These processes include desorption of elements from suspended particles, coagulation and precipitation of colloidal material, scavenging by organisms, and vertical transport. Processes associated with the formation of particle plumes above hydrothermal vents have been studied extensively. These particles oxidize rapidly and appear to scavenge both a large proportion of the hydrothermically transported trace metals and a significant component of elements from ambient seawater.\n\nAs mixing progresses, ocean circulation is increasingly dominant in dispersing inputs until they cannot be traced directly back to their source. Large rivers can be considered as point sources of material to the ocean superimposed on a diffuse background input from smaller streams. Penetration of the river signal into the deep sea follows complex pathways that are regionally diverse, depending on the current regime and the configuration of the coastline and the continental shelf. Because even unpolluted rivers usually carry elevated nutrient loads relative to coastal seawater, their discharge induces large phytoplankton blooms. The phytoplankton settle toward the seafloor, carrying nutrients and scavenging dissolved substances. In confined systems with high nutrient inputs, settling organic material can fuel bacterial activity and lead to oxygen depletion of bottom waters. The complex coupling of inorganic and biological processes, postdepositional reactions in the sediments, and strong seasonality of inputs produce a system whose chemical transport is difficult to quantify. Estuarine processes make it difficult to estimate river inputs of the more reactive elements to the open ocean. Because of this complexity, chemical oceanography in the coastal ocean has been relatively neglected even though that is the site for some of the most intense biogeochemical interactions in the entire ocean.\n\nHigh-temperature hydrothermal fluids create great buoyant clouds of fine-grained sulfides and oxides upon their turbulent injection\n\ninto the surrounding water column. These clouds rise above the vents until their density equals that of the surrounding seawater. On ridges with high rift walls (e.g., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge), the plumes often stay within the confines of the bounding rift walls. The precipitates and dissolved material they scavenge then accumulate on the walls and floor of the rift valley. On fast-spreading ridges with low walls (e.g., the East Pacific Rise), the plumes rise above the walls and are dispersed in the middepth circulation. Fine-grained vent-derived particles can be transported for thousands of kilometers, slowly settling out to form a compositionally distinctive shadow in the sediments. Unreactive species, such as helium, delineate plume flow.\n\nIf redistribution of elements occurred only by the physical dispersal of dissolved material and suspended particles near their sources, geochemical patterns would be related solely to input functions. However, the chemistry of the ocean reactor is determined primarily by organisms and chemical kinetics rather than by thermodynamics. Essential nutrient cycles are controlled largely by the metabolic processes of living organisms. For nonnutrient elements, scavenging by nonliving organic materials is much more important. Settling particles are reactive enough to adsorb and transport a large variety of elements to the bottom. Because bacteria continue to degrade this material, the concentrations of many elements increase with depth and along current flow lines.\n\nSurface productivity shows strong regional variability. The vertical particle flux and the intensity of scavenging and release also vary by region. For geochemical purposes, satellite pictures of ocean productivity must be projected into the vertical dimension to appreciate the fact that strong lateral variations in reactivity occur (reactivity is the intensity of the chemical reactions that are driven by biological activity in the ocean water column). Vast areas, such as the subtropical gyres, are quite unreactive; these are surrounded by a coastal rim of high reactivity. Other zones of high reactivity correspond to areas of physical upwelling.\n\nThe combination of lateral and vertical transport and continuous reaction of particles suggests that the water column distribution of elements at a particular location may have little influence on local processes but, instead, reflects the integration of processes over various time scales and distances. The best example of this effect is the deep silica maximum found throughout the Indian and Pacific oceans. It results from strong upwelling and associated high productivity of siliceous plankton in relatively\n\nsmall areas at these oceans' northern boundaries, and subsequent vertical transport and dissolution of their siliceous tests at depth.\n\nThe flux of particles to the seafloor is apparently the most important mechanism by which elements are delivered to the sedimentary reservoir. However, many complex processes, primarily biological, can occur after initial deposition. Particles falling from above are the only source of nutrition for many bottom-dwelling organisms. Thus this material is ingested and excreted repeatedly by a variety of species and is also subject to continuous bacterial degradation, reducing its carbon content and destroying the functional groups responsible for scavenging reactive elements from the water column.\n\nSinks\n\nThe two most important properties of the ocean system that control the uptake of chemical species by the sediments and oceanic crust are its oxidation state and its temperature.\n\nChemical reactions in sediments involving oxidation and reduction depend on the amount of oxygen present, which in turn depends on metabolic activity and diffusion from the overlying water column through the pore fluids. Where metabolic processes exceed the oxygen supply through diffusion, the sediments become anaerobic. This condition creates diffusion gradients in the oxic-anoxic transition zone from above and below, affecting a range of chemical reactions. The transition zone rises through the sediment column as sediment accumulation progresses. Understanding and quantifying these processes are crucial for studies of global change because of their implications for interpreting the sedimentary record.\n\nThe character of the crustal sink for oceanic dissolved material changes with the temperature of the water-rock interactions. At high temperatures, the reaction environment is anoxic. Sulfide-forming elements are precipitated; elements that form insoluble oxides in the reduced state, such as uranium and chromium, are also precipitated. Soluble materials, such as boron and alkali compounds, are completely removed from the rocks. Magnesium is removed but calcium is released. At the very high temperatures (>400°C) associated with recent eruptions, phase separation can occur, producing a dilute aqueous phase and a residual brine. Subsequent mixing of these components appears to be responsible for the large variations in salinity observed in hydrothermal flu-\n\nids. Details of this process are not understood. A major unknown is the mechanism responsible for maintaining the salinity and temperature of the vent fluids at a given site at stable levels over periods of years.\n\nLow-temperature weathering of the oceanic crust appears to constitute a major sink for alkali compounds and is accompanied by extensive hydration of the rocks. When the crust is subducted, this chemically bound water, along with the elements it can transport, most likely is released and migrates. The water may accelerate melting and participate in the eruption process in volcanic arcs.\n\nMarine Organic Substances\n\nThe biochemicals that fuel marine organisms are photosynthesized and then respired in the upper ocean on time scales of hours to days. Only about 20 percent of the photosynthetic product escapes from the sunlit surface ocean as sinking particles, and less than 0.5 percent is ultimately preserved in marine sediments. Living organisms comprise only about 1 percent of the organic matter in the ocean. The remaining organic matter is primarily a dilute solution (about 1 part per million) of ''dissolved\" macromolecules (i.e., material that passes through filters with a pore size of 0.5 micrometer). The turnover rate of this dissolved pool is now under discussion; the traditional view is that the pool turns over at a rate of thousands of years. The alternative view is that, because the pool of dissolved organic material contains excess carbon-14 relative to what is expected in thousand-year-old organic material, it must turn over more rapidly. Because of the challenges of isolating or directly characterizing this extremely dilute component of seawater, only about 20 percent of the organic molecules have been described.\n\nA little over a decade ago, a novel suite of organic lipids was first reported in sediments from the Atlantic Ocean and the Black Sea. The component molecules have a linear sequence of 37 to 39 carbon atoms containing one to four double bonds, with an oxygen atom doubly bonded to the second or third carbon in the chain. These long-chain alkenones were found to be produced by the marine coccolithophorid algae Emiliania huxleyi and related species that are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical oceans. The same molecules were also discovered in sediments dating back to the Miocene (about 20 million years ago).\n\nIt was later demonstrated in the laboratory that the average number of double bonds (extent of unsaturation) in these alkenones\n\nof E. huxleyi and related algal species increased at lower culturing temperatures, apparently a chemical response to maintain membrane fluidity. Brassell et al. (1986) discovered that in natural deposits the average number of carbon double bonds in alkenones from Quaternary sediments of the northeast tropical Atlantic showed a strong inverse correlation, over the past 120,000 years, with the temperature of the near-surface ocean water as inferred from the stable oxygen isotopic composition of coexisting calcium carbonate shells of the planktonic foraminifera Globerigerinoides sacculifer. This observation suggests that the relative changes in water temperature at the ocean surface during at least the past 100,000 years could be inferred from the stratigraphic record of alkenone composition in the underlying sediments. Prahl and Wakeham (1987) calibrated the alkenone paleothermometer for E. huxleyi within ±0.5°C and they provided evidence against the idea of diagenetic alteration of the molecular temperature record in the marine water column.\n\nThe alkenone paleothermometer has potential applications beyond simple confirmation of stable oxygen isotopic records of sea surface temperatures. For example, alkenone measurements can be applied readily to bulk sediment samples. The alkenone paleothermometer thus ranks as one of the major contributions in the past decade of marine organic chemistry research to understanding paleoceanography and paleoclimatology.\n\nThe application of the alkenone paleothermometer was made possible by the recent development of gas chromatographic ratio mass spectrometers, instruments that measure the stable carbon isotopic compositions of individual organic molecule types separated during the rapid (approximately one hour) gas chromatographic analysis of complex organic mixtures.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nAnalytical Methods\n\nThe chemical processes occurring within the ocean reactor are kinetically controlled except in high-temperature regimes, where thermodynamic equilibria may be inferred. These kinetic processes are driven largely by organisms; they involve chemical reactions that are difficult to reproduce in laboratory experiments because of their complexity and variety. Thus, the general strategy in studying the marine geochemistry of the present ocean and its variations in the geologic past is to pose questions in which\n\ncauses are inferred from measured distributions, that is, as an inverse problem. Variations in measured concentrations reflect changes in the relative importance of these causes. This inversion is constrained by different chemical properties of the elements of the periodic table, their valence states, their isotopes, and the compounds they form. It follows that this strategy requires the measurement of a vast array of chemical properties. Although technology development is required for measuring some of these properties, each of the elements and forms is not equally important diagnostically. Extraction of all the information useful in constraining the inversion is a prodigious analytical task.\n\nUntil recently, each available instrument could analyze only a few elements at the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy levels necessary for their concentration in natural samples. Thus no laboratory could perform more than a small fraction of possible measurements. Over the past 10 years, the sensitivity of instruments has increased vastly. Accurate and precise multielement analyses on single samples are now feasible, and multiple collector thermal ionization mass spectrometers have increased the sensitivity for a wide range of elements and isotopes. High-energy accelerator mass spectrometry allows the measurement of the cosmogenic radioisotopes in the study of a wide range of geochronological questions; it also allows exploitation of the unique properties of these isotopes in a variety of tracer studies. Plasma source mass spectrometry makes it possible to perform accurate multielement analyses on extremely small amounts of material. This technology eases measurement of refractory elements that, because of their low volatility or high ionization potential, are difficult to measure with conventional techniques.\n\nMass spectrometry for the measurement of δ18O, δ13C, and other light isotope systems are well established, as are methods for determining radiogenic isotopes. New developments in high-resolution thermal ionization mass spectrometry for the measurement of 230Th, 232Th, 234U, and 238U and the negative thermal ionization mass spectrometric measurement of 187Os/186Os have improved our capacity to use these isotopes in marine geochemical studies.\n\nImproving Our Knowledge of Fluxes\n\nMuch more research needs to be done to quantify continental inputs to the oceanic reactor. An important adjunct to studies of fluxes will be long time-series measurements that will allow an\n\nestimation of variability of fluxes. Weathering processes are traditionally regarded separately from oceanography, but oceanic techniques are essential to trace the pathways by which material enters estuarine mixing zones through rivers, progresses across the shelf, and finally moves into the deep sea. For some elements (e.g., iron), delivery to the world ocean by this route is negligible because of their insolubility in seawater. Soluble elements pass through the coastal ocean with little loss. Research on this topic has great societal importance because chemical fluxes substantially alter global climate, coastal pollution, and possibly harmful algal blooms and fisheries production.\n\nThe strength of airborne transport of particles is known to vary widely with climatic conditions. Airborne transport is the one direct pathway between the continents and the surface waters overlying the deep ocean, and its importance as a supplier of micronutrients (e.g., iron and selenium) needs to be more firmly established. It is possible that the productivity of some areas of the ocean is controlled partially by the amount of airborne trace metals. This area of research is an active one.\n\nEstimates of the hydrothermal flux range over a factor of five. The mechanisms responsible for the wide salinity variations and the temporal stability of the values at a given site are not understood. Both of these problems can be resolved only by systematic investigation of vent fluids from different sites and by development of additional tracers of both the subsurface reaction processes and the characteristic hydrothermal inputs to the global reactor.\n\nFluid inputs from the mid-ocean ridge flanks and from subduction zones are perhaps best studied by drilling and pore water sampling because the flow across the seafloor-water interface may be too diffuse for discrete sampling in the water column. Much improved down-hole sampling and measurement capabilities are required. Systematic sampling of representative ridge flanks and subduction zone complexes is needed, using the complete range of modern geophysical tools.\n\nUnderstanding Redistribution and Removal in the Ocean\n\nThe general circulation of the global ocean has been relatively well described. From the geochemical point of view, much remains to be learned about the relative importance of the removal of elements at ocean boundaries versus in situ removal by settling particles. The spatial and temporal variability of processes con-\n\ntrolling the vertical flux of elements needs to be characterized. The same is true for the evolution of the chemical properties of sinking particles traveling through the complex food web in the water column and on the seafloor. In the upper waters and thermocline, large horizontal variations in primary productivity and higher levels of food webs have been observed, but little is known about the lateral variability of deep-ocean ecosystems. The effects of ecosystems on the chemistry of particles passing through them are largely unknown. It is important to know whether there is a simple proportionality between surface productivity and the chemistry of the underlying water column or whether the particular faunal assemblages in the water column exercise a major role in controlling element concentrations.\n\nThe mechanisms of sediment interactions and diagenesis are well studied for the major constituents, nutrients, and oxygen; much more work is needed on the behavior of minor and trace constituents. Intensive research on the behavior of trace elements in the most reactive upper few meters of the ocean is also necessary. Descriptions of composition changes need to be developed for the various sediment types and environments through all phases from initial burial to subduction.\n\nReading the Record\n\nComplete decipherment of the proxy record contained in the concentration distributions of trace elements and isotopes in sediments requires an understanding of the pathways of input and the mechanisms of redistribution, removal, and transformation of the elements studied. A given tracer may record a single aspect or some combination of these factors. Ideally, multiple tracers should be used as a check on internal consistency. Because only a small number of tracers are now available, much development work is required.\n\nIt is known that the continental inputs of a number of potential tracers are changed markedly by human influence, which makes estimates of their response to environmental changes difficult. River inputs are often strongly mediated by coastal processes and hence are sensitive to sea-level variations that change the size and character of the coastal ocean. Comparative studies of shelf-dominated systems (e.g., the Yangtze and Yukon rivers) with systems in which rivers discharge directly over deep waters (e.g., the Columbia and Congo rivers) may be informative.\n\nThe relative importance of physical and chemical redistribu-\n\ntion processes and the mechanisms of sediment uptake must be established for each tracer; this will be difficult experimental work. Postdepositional redistribution processes must be characterized for the range of sedimentary environments. The establishment of reliable proxy records merits high priority because it is the most direct constraint on the modeled mechanisms of previous global changes in environmental processes.\n\nDIRECTIONS FOR MARINE GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS\n\nSummary\n\nThe plate tectonic paradigm, first quantitatively described more than 25 years ago, provides an integrated physical and chemical framework for understanding the geological evolution of Earth. Marine geologists and geophysicists played a critical role in the development of this paradigm. By linking marine magnetic anomalies to geomagnetic reversals of Earth's magnetic field, marine geophysicists were able to confirm seafloor spreading and provide quantitative estimates of seafloor spreading rates. Through holes drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Project, marine geologists were able to extend the geomagnetic reversal time scale back nearly 200 million years, providing a framework within which to reconstruct the past positions of the continents and the opening and closing of ocean basins.\n\nThroughout most of the 1970s, the major emphasis in marine geology and geophysics was on large-scale kinematic descriptions of relative plate motions and their consequences for the geological evolution of ocean basins. However, by the 1980s, the focus of the field had shifted toward more process-oriented studies centered around understanding how oceanic crust and lithosphere are created, how these processes are related to the underlying mantle, and the consequences of seafloor spreading on ancient ocean circulation and climate. Four themes currently dominate research in marine geology and geophysics: (1) the formation of oceanic crust and lithosphere along mid-ocean ridges, and the associated volcanic, hydrothermal, and biological processes; (2) off-ridge processes and their relation to mantle convection; (3) the structure and tectonics of active and passive continental margins; and (4) the record of past climate change and ocean circulation preserved in marine sediments. In addition to these four themes, there is increasing interest in the study of coastal processes including sediment\n\nerosion and transport, and estuarine and delta sedimentation. Coastal processes are discussed elsewhere in this report.\n\nIn the 1990s, marine geologists and geophysicists will begin a major, decade-long study of the global mid-ocean ridge system through the Ridge Inter-Disciplinary Global Experiment (RIDGE) program. The long-term goal of this program is to obtain a sufficiently detailed spatial and temporal definition of the global mid-ocean ridge system to construct quantifiable, testable models of how the system works, including the complex interactions among the magmatic, tectonic, hydrothermal, and biological processes associated with crust formation. Among the goals that are achievable in the next decade are a global characterization of the structure and energy fluxes along the entire 50,000-kilometer-long mid-ocean ridge system and the establishment of a permanent seafloor observatory on an active ridge segment to investigate the scales of variability in tectonic, magmatic, hydrothermal, and biological processes associated with the formation of new oceanic crust.\n\nThe ancient ocean crust contains unique information about mantle convection and composition. An improved understanding of the chemical and isotopic record of mantle convection and the variation of melt production through time is likely in the next decade. Mapping crustal composition on an ocean basin scale will require hundreds of shallow holes to be drilled into ocean crust. Directly sampling the suboceanic mantle will require the development of new drilling technology beyond that presently available to the ocean drilling community. New seismic tomography techniques for imaging the Earth's mantle will allow marine geologists to begin to relate mantle convection processes to melt production rates, lithospheric stress and intraplate deformation, and the variation in chemical and isotopic composition of the crust. Vastly improved seismic images of the suboceanic mantle are possible if an array of seafloor seismic stations is established in the 1990s to augment the global digital seismic network.\n\nContinental margins are the locus of lithospheric deformation, sediment accumulation, and substantial and chemically distinctive magmatism. Subduction and rifting processing at margins determine the size, shape, and distribution of continents and result in complex and dynamic interactions among oceanic crust, continental crust, and mantle systems. A basic description of the nature and evolution of many margins is available today, but understanding of the dynamics of margin development is still very limited. The development of new technology for probing the deeper structure of continental margins, and new conceptual advances in\n\nareas such as sequence stratigraphy and fault dynamics, provide an opportunity for the development of fundamental new insight into margin structure and evolution. What is needed is a coordinated, interdisciplinary research effort involving both land-based and sea-based research programs over the next decade.\n\nMarine sediments provide an important record of geological processes including past global climates. For example, analysis of marine sediment cores has provided critical information on the importance of Earth's orbit in short-term climate change. Marine sediments also provide a record of global sea-level changes, sea surface and bottom water temperature variations, changes in ocean current patterns, the volume of water locked in polar ice caps, and the effects of a changing physical and chemical environment on the evolution of marine life. Through drilling and coring, especially in high-latitude regions, paleoceanographers are poised to make major advances in our understanding of the natural variability in global climate systems in the coming decade.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe plate tectonic paradigm forms an integrated and linked physical and chemical framework for the flow of energy and mass through Earth (Figure 3-1). Radioactive decay of material within Earth's interior produces heat and creates a convective system that transports heat and material from deep within Earth to shallow levels. Upper mantle rocks partially melt, producing basaltic magma. Much of this melt is preferentially focused along the world-encircling mid-oceanic ridge, where oceanic crust is created. In time, the oceanic lithosphere (the oceanic crust and upper mantle) will be recycled into the mantle at convergent margins. The oceanic crust and some sediment are carried back into the mantle, and the crustal components dehydrate, pumping water and gases into the overlying mantle, causing partial melting and fractionation, and creating silica-rich rocks, ore bodies, and explosive volcanism along the overlying volcanic arc.\n\nAs oceanic crust ages and moves away from the ridge axis, it modifies Earth's environment. The chemistry of seawater is altered as the oceanic crust cools and exchanges elements with the seawater that circulates through it (see \"Directions for Marine Geochemistry\"). At convergent margins, some sediment is scraped off the subducting crustal plates, injecting fluids rich in dissolved constituents into the overlying ocean waters. Moreover, the aging oceanic lithosphere serves as a repository for sediments that\n\nrepresent a coherent high-resolution continuous record of environmental changes on time scales from years to millions of years. Given the mobility of crustal plates, the geometry and location of ocean basins and continents have changed through time. This changing plate mosaic has had a profound effect on global sea level and on ocean and atmospheric circulation.\n\nIn essence, plate tectonics is the surface expression of a solid Earth geochemical cycle. An understanding of how this cycle has operated in time and space is a fundamental starting point for Earth systems research, and it unifies the field of marine geology and geophysics. The four principal elements of this research are (1) the oceanic ridge and lithosphere, (2) off-ridge processes, (3) ocean margins, and (4) ocean basin sediments.\n\nOceanic Ridge and Lithosphere\n\nThe global mid-ocean ridge is perhaps the most striking feature on the solid surface of our planet. Sections of the ridge extend along the floor of the world's ocean to a length in excess of 50,000 kilometers. The mid-ocean ridge dominates Earth's volcanic flux and creates an average of 20 cubic kilometers of new oceanic crust every year. Two-thirds of the annual heat loss from Earth's interior occurs through the generation and cooling of the oceanic lithosphere, partially by the circulation of seawater through fractures in the hot oceanic crust. This hydrothermal circulation facilitates a major chemical exchange between seawater and oceanic crustal rocks that acts as an important regulator of the chemistry of the ocean and of the volatile content of Earth's interior. The most stunning manifestations of this circulation are the high-temperature hydrothermal vents along the ridge axis.\n\nMany discoveries of ridge phenomena have been made over the past decade, and a number of sophisticated technological tools have been developed for detailed investigation of the seafloor and the subsurface crust. High-temperature hydrothermal vents, for example, were discussed only as theoretical possibilities before their discovery in the Pacific in the late 1970s. High-resolution swath mapping and side-scan sonar imaging systems have only recently begun to provide information on the detailed morphology and structure of ridge systems. Multichannel seismic imaging techniques have advanced and thus have enabled marine geologists to begin imaging the magma chambers that lie below the ridge axis (Detrick et al., 1987). Much of the promise of this new technology remains to be realized. Detailed sampling and map-\n\nping of the mid-ocean ridge, for example, have been confined to only a small fraction of the total ridge length. The diversity of volcanic and tectonic processes manifested along the ridge axis, as a consequence, has not yet been fully defined. More fundamentally, the complex and linked processes of magmatism, hydrothermal circulation, development of vent ecosystems, and lithospheric evolution are only dimly understood. The dynamics of these processes have not yet been elucidated because of the lack of in situ observations of sufficient duration and diversity to determine the important interactions and time scales.\n\nFor a better understanding of mid-ocean ridge processes and their impacts on the chemical, physical, and biological evolution of the oceanic mantle, crust, and hydrosphere, specific aspects of the ridge system will require focused research efforts. Some are discussed below.\n\nMantle Flow, Melt Generation, and Magma Transport Beneath Mid-Ocean Ridges\n\nPlate spreading and the generation of new oceanic crust and lithosphere along oceanic spreading centers involve a variety of complex and interrelated geodynamic processes: upwelling and horizontal divergence of the solid mantle beneath spreading centers, pressure-release melting of this upwelling mantle and segregation of the partial melt from the deforming solid matrix, the emplacement and solidification of melt at shallow depths to create the oceanic crust, and the cooling of the crust and mantle to form the oceanic lithosphere. These processes are still among the more poorly understood aspects of the seafloor spreading process. Two of the most important questions are (1) the pattern of mantle flow beneath mid-ocean ridges, and (2) the geometry of the melting region in the mantle and how melt migrates to the ridge axis. Simple plate-driven flow, due to viscous coupling of the asthenosphere to the separating lithospheric plates, predicts a simple two-dimensional upwelling pattern more than several hundred kilometers in width. Pressure-release melting of this upwelling mantle is thus expected to occur over a very broad region beneath mid-ocean ridges. One of the first-order paradoxes in our present understanding of mid-ocean ridge geodynamics is how partial melt formed over such broad regions beneath ridges migrates to the extremely narrow (1-to 5-kilometer-wide) zone of eruption observed at mid-ocean ridges. We also have only a very crude un-\n\nderstanding of how this two-dimensional plate-driven flow develops into a more three-dimensional upwelling pattern along some ridges and how this flow affects, or is affected by, the observed segmentation of oceanic spreading centers.\n\nBy deploying an array of ocean bottom seismometers across a section of the mid-ocean ridge and recording a sufficient number of seismic events at different ranges and angles, it should be possible to improve the resolution of the seismic structure of the shallow mantle beneath a ridge crest. A major goal for the next decade is to carry out one or more of these studies on the mid-ocean ridge.\n\nProcesses That Transform Magma into Oceanic Crust\n\nThe transformation of magma into oceanic crust at spreading centers has fundamental implications for the mechanisms of heat and material transport from deep within Earth to the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The important processes that transform mantle melt into oceanic crust and the role of crustal chambers are poorly understood. The global distribution and physical properties of magma chambers at oceanic ridges and their temporal and spatial variability should be determined. Internal dynamics of magma chambers are important factors that must be understood, along with their effects on the structure and composition of the crust, the transfer of heat from the magma chamber, and the physical and chemical processes occurring at the interface between the magma chamber and the overlying region of seawater circulation.\n\nProcesses That Control the Segmentation and Episodicity of Lithospheric Accretion\n\nThe use of new technology, such as satellites, swath mapping, and side-scan sonar, has revealed that the global rift system is segmented and that the pattern of segmentation varies temporally and spatially. It is essential to understand the physical processes controlling segmentation and its temporal and spatial variation as well as the processes causing episodic production along individual segments and their boundary zones. Melt migration and eruption, faulting, fissuring, and stretching must also be better understood so that the individual processes and their possible interactions can be studied and interpreted.\n\nPhysical, Chemical, and Biological Processes Involved in Interactions Between Circulating Seawater and the Lithosphere\n\nHydrothermal plumes that issue from seafloor vents link the oceanic lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere through complex physical, chemical, and biological interactions (Rona et al., 1986). A detailed understanding of the individual processes that constitute a hydrothermal system will provide insight into many problems in biological, chemical, geological, and physical oceanography. Although present research on seafloor hydrothermal circulation has begun to address a few of these problems, new approaches and a more focused effort will be required to achieve an interdisciplinary view.\n\nDistribution and Intensity of Mid-Ocean Hydrothermal Venting\n\nThe character of hydrothermal plumes is determined by both crustal processes and the oceanic environment. Changes in the plume can reflect events with diverse spatial and temporal scales, such as magma chamber evolution, changes in the subsurface hydrothermal plumbing, and shifting bottom currents. To understand these complex interactions, we must study hydrothermal plumes over a wide range of scales in time and space: from the scale of the individual vent plume fluctuating over a period of seconds up to the 1,000-kilometer scale of the large ocean-basin plumes estimated to contain the integrated output from 100 years of hydrothermal venting. An important new research direction is to move from the realm of general observation to the quantification of rates and processes in hydrothermal plumes.\n\nIn summary, an improved understanding of the mid-ocean ridge system will require focused efforts. Present technologies are relatively well developed for establishing the occurrence of spatial variations within the ridge system, but obtaining observations of temporal change will be challenging. Global-scale reconnaissance surveys can help in selecting sites for more focused regional studies in which coordinated experiments would involve a range of long-term measurements. A common requirement of many of the recommended studies is accurate age information on time scales between a decade and a million years. Innovative approaches to dating hydrothermal fluids, rocks, and biological materials will be necessary to meet this requirement.\n\nOff-Ridge Processes\n\nOff-ridge processes can be studied to determine how Earth functioned in the past and whether there are additional temporal variability and forcing functions that will not be discovered by studying the geological present. The seafloor contains a record of the creation of the oceanic lithosphere. In addition, important questions concern changes in the oceanic crust as it ages. The older oceanic crust also contains information concerning mantle convection and composition. Several important investigative themes can be identified.\n\nChemical and Isotopic Record of Mantle Convection\n\nBecause the mantle is overlain by the crust, it is not possible at present to sample the suboceanic mantle directly, except in tectonically anomalous areas (e.g., oceanic fracture zones). The basalts that are derived from the mantle, however, are indirect mantle samples that have been modified by partial melting and partial crystallization. Because the oceanic crust is thin and its composition is similar to the magma, and because the spreading center provides a relatively permeable and free pathway to the surface, ocean ridges are the sites where the magma is least modified. Thus ocean ridge basalts typically provide the least adulterated record of mantle composition and temperature. Mapping crustal composition can provide quantitative information about the size, distribution, and composition of mantle reservoirs and the efficiency of convective stirring. This information is a record and an opportunity to map indirectly the composition and temperature of the mantle.\n\nVariation of Melt Production (Convective Vigor) Through Time\n\nThere is strong evidence that plate separation rates and basaltic magma production rates along ridges and within plates are not constant. For example, a 50 to 75 percent increase in the rate of formation of oceanic crust and a doubling in the production rate of basaltic magmas between 120 and 80 million years ago (Figure 3-2; Larson, 1991) has been documented. The changes may be due to a large mantle-derived super plume that may have lifted off the core-mantle boundary and have been responsible for increased seafloor spreading and large-scale oceanic plateau production (e.g., Ontong Java and Kerguelen plateaus). It has been suggested that the super\n\nplume had major geological consequences, including considerable increases in eustatic sea level, paleotemperature, oil generation, black shale deposition, and species diversification of phytoplankton and zooplankton. Such an event has profound implications for our understanding of mantle dynamics, oceanic plateau formation, and global environmental change.\n\nStructure and Composition of Oceanic Crust\n\nAn understanding of crust formation cannot be achieved in the absence of better knowledge of the composition of the total ocean crust. This information would allow solution of a host of long-standing controversies, including the relationship between crustal structure and spreading rate, the origin of the seismically defined stratigraphy of the oceanic crust, the total magnetization of the crust and how it is distributed with depth, and the depth and nature of hydrothermal interaction in the crust.\n\nKnowledge of Stresses Acting on Oceanic Lithosphere and Intraplate Deformation\n\nThe observational basis for plate motions is well established, but the relative importance of the forces (ridge-push, trench-pull, and plate-drag) that act on the plates and cause them to move is unresolved. In addition, the stresses that act upon the oceanic lithosphere at or near plate boundaries are poorly understood. Determining the stresses required to create these structures is key to understanding the tectonics of these environments (Zoback et al., 1985).\n\nOcean Margins\n\nContinental margins are a principal site of lithospheric deformation, sediment accumulation, and mass flux on Earth and the site of substantial and chemically distinctive magmatism. Understanding their nature and origin will provide knowledge of the history of the ocean basins, and because the margins are progressively incorporated into the continental mass by plate interactions, the knowledge is also essential to our understanding of the mechanisms of continental evolution. In the next several years, the opportunity exists for researchers to develop a fundamentally new understanding of margins, a leap that may parallel that brought about by the plate tectonic revolution some 25 years ago.\n\nA basic description of the nature and evolution of many continental margins is available today. However, understanding of the dynamics of margin development has not grown at the same rate. Knowledge of continental margin structure and motion has progressed, but understanding of the margins is limited by the need to understand the basic physical processes that accompany margin formation. Continental margins research must embrace a unified approach that emphasizes the important role of process-oriented interdisciplinary programs. Further, margins cross the shoreline, and such efforts will further enhance the developing synergism with Earth scientists involved in land and ocean research.\n\nFault Dynamics and Lithospheric Deformation\n\nAny approach to the problems associated with lithospheric deformation demands the use of many tools. A wide-ranging field-mapping program is needed specifically to establish the link between surface deformation and deformation in the lower crust. For example, the configuration of large faults at depth in the crust and the structural fabric associated with distributed deformation in the upper mantle must be established by large-scale seismic imaging and tomographic techniques. Laboratory studies are also essential to establishing the constitutive laws for frictional behavior of both large deformation zones and discrete fault zones and defining their variability with strain, strain rate, and fluid content. Models of fluid flow in deforming porous media and methods to relate the models to observable quantities for field observation are required.\n\nMantle Dynamics and Extension\n\nUnderstanding the interaction between mantle processes and lithospheric extension will require a focused multidisciplinary effort. Wide-ranging field-mapping programs must be designed to establish specific links between surface deformation and deformation in the lower crust. Large geophysical experiments will be needed to define the modern structure of rifts and margins and the thermal and dynamic state of mantle beneath young, presently active rifts. This work must be combined with geological mapping and thorough geochemical studies of magmatic systems to determine the nature of mantle sources, the history of melting, and fractionation. The development of shear-wave techniques\n\nand electromagnetic methods to increase their sensitivity to the detection of fluids will be particularly relevant.\n\nRecycling\n\nMass flux studies needed to understand convergent margins as dynamic systems will involve integrated field, analytical, experimental, and theoretical studies that draw from geochemistry, petrology, and geophysics. Such projects require marine as well as land-based studies and careful integration of results from the two. Sampling must include fluids, melts, sediments, crust, and gases from the entire subduction zone, the subducting plate to the back-arc zone. Theoretical and experimental studies are an essential addition to these geochemical and geophysical programs. Existing studies have related only to isolated aspects of mass fluxes at convergent margins. However, the results of these studies can be used in conjunction with samples from existing and planned Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) and Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) holes drilled offs"
