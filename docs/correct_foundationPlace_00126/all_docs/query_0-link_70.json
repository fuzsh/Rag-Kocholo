        "text": "ProMinent GmbH, a leading supplier of water treatment solutions, will exhibit at IFAT (Hall A3, Booth 451/550). The world's leading trade fair for water, sewage, waste and raw materials management will take place in Munich from 13 to 17 May 2024, offering the ideal platform for presenting the latest trends in the industry. This time around, ProMinent will focus on waste water and potable water treatment.\n\nIn respect of waste water, ProMinent will spotlight what is known as the fourth cleaning stage and sludge dewatering, thereby emphasising its continued commitment to developing efficient and sustainable waste water treatment solutions.\n\nThe fourth cleaning stage improves waste water purification in municipal sewage plants and involves the use of advanced processes such as ozone treatment to remove micropollutants (drug residues, etc.). ProMinent will show how sewage plants can utilise these technologies not only particularly effectively, but also in an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient manner.\n\nSludge dewatering is important for sewage plants due to the related savings on waste disposal costs. The various waste water treatment processes produce several thousand tonnes of sewage sludge every year, which must then be disposed of via incineration or landfill at a charge. Therefore, the highest possible dry matter content should ideally be achieved. Visitors to the ProMinent booth will be shown how the sludge produced can be dewatered efficiently.\n\nWith regard to potable water treatment, ProMinent positions itself as a technology-independent supplier in the disinfection sector. The company has extensive expertise in various disinfection processes, such as UV, ozone, electrolysis and chlorine dioxide. At the trade fair, it will focus on electrolysis, a safe and economical solution for disinfecting potable water. ProMinent electrolysis systems enable waterworks to provide germ-free drinking water, even in large quantities.\n\nIn addition, ProMinent's measuring and control technology and digital products will be integrated into both theme worlds.\n\n\"IFAT is an excellent opportunity for us to present our latest solutions to an international audience,\" says JÃ¶rg Engemann, Managing Director of ProMinent Deutschland GmbH. \"We look forward to showcasing our leadership in water and waste water treatment and connecting with professionals from around the world.\""
