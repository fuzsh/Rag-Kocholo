The school kits, which consisted of essential supplies for learning, were distributed to support staff’s children to support their education. A total of 100 school kits were distributed during this initiative. The event held on October 1st, 2023, was a heartwarming occasion where the children of the support staff received these school kits with smiles and gratitude. The company’s leadership, employees, and the children’s families were present to witness this meaningful gesture.

Similar events will be taking place across Impetus’ offices across India in the coming month.

To make this initiative possible, employees at Impetus Technologies generously contributed towards the procurement of these school kits. The organization, in turn, matched the employees’ contributions, effectively doubling the impact of the initiative.

Sanjeev Agrawal, CHRO of Impetus Technologies, expressed his appreciation for the support staff and said, “Our support staff plays an indispensable role in the smooth functioning of our organization. We are committed to supporting them and their families. We believe that education is the foundation of a brighter future, and we are delighted to contribute in our own small way to the education of these young minds.”

Impetus Technologies remains dedicated to its CSR initiatives and aims to continue making a positive impact on the communities it operates in.
