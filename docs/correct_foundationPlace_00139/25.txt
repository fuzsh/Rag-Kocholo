Heidelberg, Germany | Singapore | Jakarta, Indonesia, October 29, 2021 â SNP Transformations SEA Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner SE (the SNP Group), a world-leading provider of software solutions for digital transformation processes and automated data migrations, has completed a successful SAP S/4HANA go-live with a move to the Azure Cloud for PT United Tractors Tbk, the largest heavy equipment provider in Indonesia, in collaboration with PT Astra Graphia Information Technology (AGIT). Following this success, the Astra Group has selected SNP and AGIT for multiple SAP S/4HANA transformation projects this year.

United Tractors, a subsidiary of PT Astra International Tbk (Astra), one of Indonesiaâs largest and leading business groups, was gearing up to expand its business by implementing a synergy-based and diversified business model in various business units. The associated digitalization involving the migration to the new SAP S/4HANA business suite with lower cloud operating costs was identified as a priority to support business growth, influence the companyâs ability to adopt next-generation business processes, and enable it to make informed decisions quickly based on real-time insights. The need of the hour was a reliable, time-efficient and cost-saving approach, accommodating the highest flexibility regarding the coverage of data transformation requirements and with minimal downtime.

Lie Gunadi, Corporate Strategic and Technology Division Head, PT United Tractors Tbk, says, âAs part of United Tractorsâ digital transformation journey, the company planned to upgrade its existing ECC 6.0 (on-premises) to significantly improve its operations via a host of optimization strategies. A rapid implementation to move the core business system to S/4HANA and the cloud was imperative to manage demand for innovation, customization and transparent real-time analysis, ensuring business agility â an essential aspect for staying at the top in todayâs increasingly intense market environment. Apart from resolving the data transformation challenges, SNPâs CrystalBridgeÂ® and BLUEFIELDâ¢ approach delivered as per United Tractorsâ ambition for a leaner, higher-performance S/4HANA target system in Azure. A high degree of automation and reliability combined multiple projects simultaneously and reduced the data footprint with selective data migration, lowering TCO at minimal downtime and risk and achieving a single go-live within budgeted timelines. Thanks to SNP, we are on an accelerated path to becoming an agile intelligent enterprise.â

Gerald Faust, Managing Director and CEO, Asia Pacific and Middle East, SNP Transformations SEA Pte Ltd., adds, âSNP is delighted to be part of United Tractorâs strategic endeavor to become an intelligent enterprise with an automated and accelerated transformation to SAP S/4HANA as they transformed their data, business and systems from on-premises to Azure. In the wake of this success, SNP has been engaged to extend its proven expertise to more automotive and heavy equipment companies, dealing with Komatsu, Daihatsu, Toyota, Honda and others within the Astra Group. SNPâs approach supports business growth and paves the way for integrating emerging technologies including big data, embedded AI, in-memory HANA database and real-time analytics.â

Widi Triwibowo, President Director, AGIT, comments, âAs a strategic IT arm of the Astra Group, we combined our expertise with SNP to significantly drive United Tractorsâ operations, leading the industry through a host of digital, data transformation and cost optimization strategies with an outlook for business continuity and agility. SNPâs software-centric data transformation platform CrystalBridgeÂ® and selective data migration approach BLUEFIELDâ¢, which flexibly combines the best of Greenfield (new implementation) and Brownfield (system conversion) approaches, offered a low-risk acceleration of the S/4HANA transformation to the Azure Cloud through automation and specialized data visualization. The proven, reliable methodology combined multiple projects â New GL, Business Partner and Unicode conversion â delivering clear advantages in terms of costs, system downtime and project runtimes.â
