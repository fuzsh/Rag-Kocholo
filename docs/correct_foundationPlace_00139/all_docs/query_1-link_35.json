        "text": "Sustainability & ESG\n\nWhat we do today determines what the world will look like tomorrow. (Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach)\n\nAt Exasol, we believe that it is possible to have a positive impact on the world and society if every one of us does his or her best. That’s why we take the responsibility we have as a company to society very seriously. We aim to create more than just economic value through coordinated social engagement, an environmental and sustainability strategy that adapts to the circumstances, and responsible corporate governance!\n\nUN Global Compact – Ten fundamental principles for how Exasol conducts business\n\nExasol aims to contribute to the fulfillment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and considers the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact as a foundation for good and responsible business conduct. Therefore, we joined the UN Global Compact and are member of the UN Global Compact Netzwerk Deutschland e.V. Exasol shares the core values of the UN Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption and is committed to making continuous progress in these areas. Hence, we conduct regular internal assessments about our potential and actual impacts on those topics, especially on human rights and environmental protection.\n\nEnvironment\n\nProtecting our planet is close to our heart:\n\nExasol calculates its carbon footprint on an annual basis in order to be transparent about our share of CO2 emissions in this world and to identify opportunity for optimization.\n\nExasol wants to commit in line with levels required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, reducing its emissions for GHG Protocol Scopes 1 and 2. Furthermore, Exasol has also committed to continuous measurement and monitoring of emissions from Scope 3 in an effort to reduce these as much as possible. We have already taken various measures in support of this.\n\nAmong other things, the office building at our headquarters in Nuremberg and most of our smaller offices already use green electricity. In addition to the fact that some servers in our data centers already use green power, we further reduce the emissions of our core business through sustainable suppliers and service providers along our supply chain.\n\nFor more information, please see our Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2023 (download below) and our Corporate Carbon Footprint Report 2022. The Corporate Carbon Footprint Report 2023 will be published in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nDownload\n\nSocial\n\nFor our employees, a very important aspect of life at Exasol is learning and development. We support our employees in an individual and structured way.\n\nAn integral part of the employee journey is at the very beginning with recruitment philosophy and approach. We believe in hiring the best talent using our comprehensive recruitment process to ensure a fair and diverse selection.\n\nContinuously improving the employee experience is a cornerstone of our people strategy. One of our tools used to measure employee engagement is a monthly pulse survey and an annual holistic engagement survey based on a proven methodology by Gallup.\n\nExasol truly values diversity and inclusion. We have a highly engaged diversity team, diversity trainings and further important initiatives such as our regular culture talks and “women group” for networking, coaching and knowledge exchange.\n\nFor more information, please see our Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2023.\n\nDownload"
