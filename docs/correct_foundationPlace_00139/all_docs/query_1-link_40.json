        "text": "Discover how BEST bridged the gap in SAP with their innovative solution for Vendor Reconciliation.\n\nUnlike time-consuming, inconsistent, manual reconciling in Excel - and other non-SAP third-party solutions that require data extracts - with the BEST Vendor Recons Module, you reconcile directly in SAP.\n\nEnhance your existing SAP investment and functionality by accessing all SAP details from your real-time online reconciliations. With online approvals in SAP and automated system controls, you can now ensure standardisation and consistency throughout your vendor reconciliation process. Have complete visibility and control using the available real-time management reporting.\n\nJoin Michael Webb from G3G and Suresan Ellary from BEST to learn more about the BEST Vendor Recons development journey and how our customers are benefitting from this SAP Add-on module's functionality.\n\nG3G serves as BEST's Implementation and Support Partner in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n\nAs this is a Partner sponsored webinar, there may be some restriction on which members can attend. This means that even if your initial booking is accepted, we may contact you to cancel your booking."
