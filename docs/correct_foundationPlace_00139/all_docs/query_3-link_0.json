        "text": "SNP Establishes SAP® Focused Build at REWE, Paving the Way for S/4HANA\n\nREWE pursues ambitious goals in introducing S/4HANA for processes in finance and accounting: Several SAP systems and processes are to be harmonized in the financial and accounting sector in order to consolidate them into a new central S/4HANA system. At the same time, standard templates and mandatory group-wide requirements are to be defined, and numerous internal developments to be evaluated and reduced to a minimum in S/4. The inconsistent initial situation also reflected the project organization: Project members from multiple organizational areas came together and contributed different previous knowledge and various perspectives on IT tools,processes and methodology.\n\nAudi AG moves to SAP S/4HANA® at top speed\n\nIn line with their slogan “Vorsprung durch Technik,” Audi AG are investing in state-of-the-art technology and IT architecture. Following SAP’s announcement that maintenance for older product versions will end, the focus is on SAP S/4HANA. With multiple projects in the pipeline, Audi AG implemented two simultaneously at the start of 2023, introducing SAP S/4HANA Finance to establish a central finance system and migrating to SAP S/4HANA in the area of maintenance logistics. Both projects ran quickly and securely thanks to SNP.\n\nSNP Implements Matrix42 Integration with SAP Solution Manager for Vossloh\n\nVossloh decided to extend its ALM (application lifecycle management) processes by introducing a second tool called Matrix42. Both tools needed to play to their individual strengths in order to improve the ALM processes even further. In order to meet these ambitious goals and adhere to the tight schedule, it was decided that SNP should become the implementation partner of choice.\n\nSwiss technology group completes complex ERP migration to SAP S/4HANA\n\nThe Bühler Group was planning to strategically modernize its ERP system landscape that had grown over time and migrate to the fourth SAP product version S/4HANA. The global company opted to collaborate with SNP to save time and costs as well as reduce risks. Working together, the complex project was completed quickly. The key success factors were the software-based end-to-end approach as well as the selective data migration.\n\nMigrating SAP data to Snowflake in less than three weeks\n\nLooking to streamline their operations and drive innovation, Swiss electric services company Romande Energie opted for moving their SAP data to the cloud and building a data warehouse. They chose the Snowflake Data Cloud platform, which offers advanced reporting capabilities and facilitates data sharing. Apart from the new functions and the option to report on data throughout various systems, the shift to the cloud also came with cost savings.\n\nTime-critical carve-out drives restructuring program at SHW Automotive\n\nThe SHW Group stands for intelligent manufacturing in the automotive sector and is experiencing rising demand. To drive this development going forward, the company needed to transform its Powder Metallurgy business segment into a separate legal entity. Technically speaking, they needed to spin off the existing SAP system at the company code level. SNP delivered the audit-proof solution quickly and with minimized system downtime.\n\nSNP’s industrialized transformation approach accelerates global SAP S/4HANA® program at BSH​\n\nThe BSH Group is planning to fully transform and modernize its global SAP ERP systems. The aim is to create a new IT landscape in the SAP S/4HANA environment that is consistent, flexible and easy-to-maintain in order to optimize business processes and make technological leaps in the future. BSH wants to migrate 39 production sites in Europe, the USA, Latin America and Asia to SAP S/4HANA. Due to the complexity of the project, the company has opted for a step-by-step (wave-based) approach. The staggered SAP S/4HANA roll-ins need to be as fast and cost-effective as possible. They require a highly automated and secure methodology to ensure that the data is accurate and traceable. Minimizing project disruptions is another crucial aspect, as they can lead to considerable additional costs.\n\nBruce McKinnon to join SNP as Senior Strategic Advisor for the Asia-Pacific region\n\nHeidelberg, Germany I Singapore, July 15, 2024 – The Heidelberg-based software and consulting company SNP SE is continuing its strategic transformation. The leading provider of software for digital transformation, automated data migration and data management in the SAP environment has just announced that Bruce McKinnon will join the leadership team as Senior Strategic Advisor.

Bringing with him decades of consultancy experience at both a partner and managing director level, Bruce McKinnon’s expertise will strengthen the SNP leadership team across the region. The former leader for SAP-related business at Accenture for Asia-Pacific and the Middle East also played a major role in laying the foundation for SAP’s services business across Asia-Pacific. He has helped organizations across a range of industries, including the public sector, financial services, consumer products, retail, manufacturing, transport and energy. Mr McKinnon will take up his new role with immediate effect.\n\nRising up to the cloud: SNP publishes meta study on S/4HANA migrations\n\nHeidelberg, Germany, July 9, 2024 – SNP SE, a leading provider of software for digital transformation, automated data migration and data management in the SAP environment, has published a meta study examining the current state of SAP S/4HANA migrations. The study “Rising up to the cloud – RISE with SAP & SAP S/4HANA” summarizes the results of various studies and user surveys from a technical, operational and strategic perspective. The key finding is that while companies are still facing challenges, they also see opportunities – and are increasingly relying on RISE with SAP for the migration.\n\nTransformation World 2024: SNP expands its CrystalBridge solution for improved integration and greater business agility\n\nHeidelberg, Germany, June 21, 2024 – SNP SE, a leading provider of software for digital transformation, automated data migration and data management in the SAP environment, announced at its flagship conference Transformation World the expansion of its CrystalBridge solution with new capabilities.
