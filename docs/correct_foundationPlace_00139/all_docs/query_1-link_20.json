        "text": "Gapless\n\nA combined approach offers clear advantages in terms of costs, system downtime and project runtimes. A software-based end-to-end solution optimally prepares systems as well as processes for the far-reaching modernization work and carries it out quickly and securely. After the transformation, data management guarantees high data quality and maximum added value. If companies combine the move to SAP S/4HANA and the cloud, they create the basis for responding efficiently to current and future changes in their business models. Only those who can adapt quickly and flexibly in the market can maintain and even strengthen their position.\n\nNo half measures\n\nThe conversion to SAP S/4HANA and the path to the cloud are two super trends that are central topics for most users for the next few years. While the cloud conversion initially proves to be an infrastructure issue, the SAP S/4HANA implementation should be seen as a combination of technical migration and business transformation, in the context of which processes are adapted and optimized in order to leverage the potential of SAP S/4HANA in the best possible way. Many customers initially take the approach of moving existing SAP ECC systems to the cloud and then migrating to SAP S/4HANA years later. Although these two projects can be clearly separated, higher overall costs, disruptions and interruptions to ongoing operations, and longer transition periods with restrictions on the use of SAP systems are to be expected as a result.\n\nFor the cloud infrastructure, it is important to determine the framework conditions reliably and automatically. Decision-makers want to know what the individual target configuration in the cloud looks like, what additional flexibility and further advantages the move to the cloud will bring, and what costs this will incur in ongoing operation. Automated cloud sizing solutions are available for this purpose, which cover these requirements much faster, more flexibly and more securely than previous approaches. The analysis and definition of the cloud infrastructure can be perfectly combined with an SAP S/4HANA assessment - creating the basis for a combined transformation project.\n\nGood data for even better performance\n\nSAP systems have grown over many years in most companies, which often results in a \"proliferation\". The data quality is often very heterogeneous, there are a large number of different, non-standardized processes, a high proportion of in-house developments and lots of interfaces. A selective migration approach offers the opportunity for targeted system optimization as part of the cloud and SAP S/4HANA conversion: in the sense of a clean core strategy, an optimized mix of old and proven functions as well as modernized processes is created as a new foundation. The result is a leaner, higher-performance target system with significantly higher data quality and also with lower cloud operating costs. For example, many thousands of euros can be saved over a typical cloud subscription term of three years if the database is 5 TB instead of 7 TB.\n\nIf there is a merge or carve-out scenario, there is no way around selective migration anyway: Certain areas of the original system must be specifically cut out and transferred to an existing or new target system. In a classic, non-software-based approach, selective migration means a high time outlay with many manual and error-prone steps. A software-based, highly automated approach shortens many processes and the project duration by up to 75 percent as a result.\n\nBest in Class\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for companies in cloud and SAP S/4HANA migrations is certainly the predictability of the project and the question of the \"value\" of the transformation. When selecting an IT consultant and service portfolio, care should therefore be taken to ensure that a high degree of predictability can be guaranteed with a sound value calculation and software-supported project planning even before the actual transformation. An experienced partner network should be available for the important area of transforming business processes when switching to SAP S/4HANA. The bundled know-how of hyperscalers, system integrators or consulting firms offers advantages: All potentials can be worked out, a customer-specific strategy can be defined, and possible reservations about the path to the cloud and to SAP S/4HANA can be eliminated.\n\nDecision-makers are made aware of the significance of the changeover for their own company and the benefits that go hand in hand with it. Partnerships can ensure that solutions and methodologies are optimally embedded in an overall concept to meet the companies' overall requirements for an SAP transformation, the path to the cloud, and additional tasks, such as in the area of \"managed services\" - an amalgamation of best-in-class providers for various requirements and successful transformations.\n\nSoftware makes the difference\n\nThe classic approach to SAP transformations is usually based on implementing projects with high consulting costs but without dedicated transformation software. Companies do not incur any additional licensing costs for transformation software. However, planning and forecasts for the large-scale project are subject to great uncertainty. How the transformation project will really proceed, how long it will take - significantly longer without software than with! - and exactly what the result will look like is difficult to define in this way. There is a smarter way, starting with a comprehensive analysis of the transformation project. This is used to determine exactly what the concrete framework conditions for a transformation look like, which path is best for the customer, and how the project will proceed in terms of time and individual steps - a blueprint is created.\n\nThe use of software offers maximum transparency and predictability for customers even before the start of a transformation project, as well as a clear concept for IT consultants and partners for the implementation of IT and business transformations. And even after a project, companies benefit entirely in terms of a seamless end-to-end transformation: Changes can be responded to more quickly, and new requirements and important innovations can be implemented quickly."
