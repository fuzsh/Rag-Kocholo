        "text": "KTG Agrar AG is one of the leading agricultural enterprises in Europe, and has again obtained bank-alternative financing through its second corporate bond. \"With this bond, the investors invest in the future-oriented agriculture industry, as the demand for farmland, healthy food and clean energy is growing constantly\", says Siegfried Hofreiter, CEO of KTG Agrar AG. The company has been producing high-quality agricultural commodities and CO2-neutral energy from biogas on farmland for more than 15 years. Hofreiter:\n\n\"With this bond, we wish to further strengthen our financial base, while building on a sound foundation to continue acceleration of our sustainable growth course in core business areas.‚Äù\n\nyoumex Invest AG, Frankfurt, has again supported KTG Agrar AG in the placement of the second corporate bond with a coupon of 7.125 % and a term of 6 years. In a similar fashion to the first issue of the Biowertpapier in September 2010, youmex carried out the placement swiftly and efficiently, mainly with institutional investors.\n\n\"We have strong placement power thanks to our network of investors, which we have been cultivating carefully for more than 10 years. This is not only a condition for the successful issue of a small and mid cap bond, but also for every other type of capital transaction. We have previously structured and placed several corporate bonds of medium-sized companies and groups, and are amenable to further assignments,\" says Andreas Wegerich, CEO of youmex Invest AG, the Lead Manager Institutional Sales."
