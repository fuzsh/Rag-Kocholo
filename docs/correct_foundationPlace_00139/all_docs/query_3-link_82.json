However, the world changed in 2022. A huge wave of inflation began across the world which, for the time being at least, is still to peak in many places. So, the question arises: How does this affect company ZEPYEXMSRW#;I[MPPITPSVIXLIMWWYIJVSQJSYV different perspectives; the effect of current uncertainty on valuations; the cost of capital in an inflationary environment; the difference between cost and income inflationary pressure; and finally, accounting and XEEXMSRMWWYIW-RSYVƤRHMRKW[IXEOIMRXSEGGSYRX hypotheses from the university thesis of our former colleague, Dr. Márk Radó, written in the late 1990s as well as his PHD thesis written in the late 2000s, and give thanks for his collaboration. BUSINESS FOCUS /2 INFLATION AFFECTING COMPANY VALUATIONS Ʉ - n recent years, businesses were operating in an environment in which inflation wasn’t even a consideration in strategic or operational decision- making. The abundance of cheap money and the shortage of qualified labour caused an astonishing rise in prices in several sub-markets (various raw materials and asset classes such as real estate and some stock groups showed significant price inflation), however, consumer price levels in general remained almost stationary. As a result, interest rates fell to unprecedented depths (just look at the negative base interest rates appearing in several countries). However, while there were many challenges and much uncertainty, the general rise in prices could for the most part, be ignored.\n\n3. 3/ BUSINESS FOCUS INFLATION AFFECTING COMPANY VALUATIONS The Issue of Uncertainty -RXSHE]ŭWIRZMVSRQIRXFSXLMRƥEXMSRERHXLILYKI fluctuation of foreign exchange rates are causing enormous uncertainty. Other international events taking place around us, including the Ukrainian war in Europe, create yet further uncertainty. In such an environment, investors are more hesitant as their relative expected returns increase which has a negative effect on the value of real assets, including company value. In order for relative return expectations to decrease, we would need a return to the 4-5 years of economic stability that we had prior to the COVID pandemic. It’s important to note however, that market uncertainty can damage GSQTER]ZEPYEXMSRWVIKEVHPIWWSJMRƥEXMSRWSIZIR a recessionary environment and resulting fall in inflation won’t necessarily result in a decrease in relative return expectations - this would require the remaining causes of uncertainty, such as the Ukraine war, to disappear. 'SWXSJ'ETMXEPMRER-RƥEXMSREV])RZMVSRQIRX Risk-free interest rates, which have increased as a result of inflationary pressure, also move nominal return expectations significantly upwards, which once again sparks a decline in company valuations. Therefore, in order for company valuations to increase again, risk-free interest rates must start to decrease. -RƥEXMSREV]4VIWWYVISRXLI'SQTER]'SWX7XVYGXYVI and Income In an inflationary environment, the relative valuation of some companies may also change.
