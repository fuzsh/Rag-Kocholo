Novastone Capital Advisors connects talented entrepreneurs, investors, and SMEs within the framework of its Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program. Program participants search for and buy an SME, and then become its CEO to operate and grow the company, not only solving succession issues while protecting the capital of investors, but also ensuring continuity and value creation following the acquisition. What is Novastone Capital and Novastone Capital Advisors? Novastone Capital is a single-family office, based in Switzerland. Novastone Capital Advisors (“NCA”) was founded by a group of entrepreneurs from the JEQMP]SJƤGIGSQQYRMX]PIHF]'LVMWXMER1EPIO')3 of Novastone Capital, to initiate and manage the Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program, on behalf of Novastone Capital and its program members. Program members include European single-family SJƤGIWERHIRXVITVIRIYVW[LSWTSRWSVXLITVSKVEQ participants. Think of it as a real-life post-corporate career MBA, where highly talented executives-to-be with entrepreneurial ambitions are given the framework and support to acquire and operate a private company.

Can you explain more about these funds and how this led to the concept of the Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition program? A Search Fund is a process in which a group of investors back a talented individual to search, buy, grow and IMXEGSQTER]Ʉ8LIGSQTERMIWGLSWIREVIX]TMGEPP] those facing a succession issue. Search Funds have existed as an asset class since the early 1980s and independent research from Stanford shows they have average Internal Rate of Return above 30%. As CEO of Novastone Capital, we invested in our first Search Fund in 2013. It was one of the first Latin-American Search Funds launched and a highly successful investment. Following the exit, we became a Limited Partner (LP) of a Fund-of-Search Funds launched by one of the initial investment’s co-investors. Novastone Capital did in fact, previously endorse and fund a candidate to research a company to acquire, buy and run, yet our experience with Search Funds has been that sharing an investment where no one person has control and the process is collaborative and centralised through a program is the best approach and yields the best results. Furthermore, I was also fortunate enough to meet a top- tier professional who opened my eyes. He believed the traditional approach of launching a Search Fund himself, and knocking on 12-15 different investors’ doors raising 35-40 thousand Euros at a time, was not the solution. I agreed and it prompted me to devise and run an in-house program for Search Fund investing for single-family SJƤGIW*SPPS[MRKXLIGSQTPIXMSRSJQ])IGYXMZI1% at INSEAD in Lausanne, I launched the program, which VIHYGIWXLIMRIJƤGMIRGMIWSJXLIXVEHMXMSREPQSHIP[MXLSYX compromising the expected return. ;IEVIXLISRP]ƤVQFYMPHMRK7IEVGL*YRHTSVXJSPMSWEW a program, having invented the concept. Which geographies do you cover and do you have plans to expand? We currently operate in two regions; Europe and North America. We started with Switzerland and Germany and the European program has expanded to include Italy, Spain, and the UK, as well as Central and Eastern European countries such as Hungary and Poland. We expect to expand the program to France, the Nordic and Benelux countries later this year. The European program has the capacity to take-on 12-15 participants a year. However, quality comes first; one year we might find 7, the next, we could find 20. Quality is what makes the difference and makes everything work: candidates able to attract the sponsors and convince the business owner that they are the right person to take over. There is no room for error, which is why our selection process is so rigorous. Our North American program is also live where we LEZISYVƤVWXJIQEPITEVXMGMTERXERH[ILSTIXSPEYRGL in Canada very soon. What are you looking for in an entrepreneur? Selecting the candidates is a very challenging process. There are basic attributes such as character, being hard-working and being able to take on responsibility, that are a must. The ideal candidate would normally have a good educational background, operational experience, i.e., be running a company in a high/ general manager position, and have entrepreneurial experience. In fact, many of our candidates have already co-launched a company. The program is about trying to make a change, creating value and writing your own company story. It is not for everyone, which is why we spend a great deal of time and care selecting the participants. Though entrepreneurs and situations differ case by case, which type of companies do your entrepreneurs look for? In general, we have two types of candidates: those who have moved from one industry to another and are therefore, focusing on companies in 3-4 industries and others specializing in a single vertical. The program itself is quite industry agnostic. It can work with either type of candidate. However, there are several elements in the target industry that we generally want to see. First, we want to make sure XLIVIEVIWYJƤGMIRXGSQTERMIWMRXLIGLSWIRMRHYWXV] Sometimes we have a candidate who wants to buy ;IEVIXLISRP]ƤVQFYMPHMRK7IEVGL*YRH portfolios as a program, having invented the concept.\n\n3. a hotel or a luxury brand and there are only 20-100 targets, which will not work. We want industries where there is a pool of hundreds, if not thousands of companies to search through. Second, we favour industries that are not too capital intensive, have limited cyclicality and are growing. Of course, when it comes to the balance sheets, they should FILIEPXL]ERHTVSƤXEFPIFYXSXLIV[MWI[IEVIƥIMFPI Third, we prefer industries within geographies known to the program participant. For example, Viktor was the standout candidate during his assessment period. As his industry knowledge and expertise is focused on Hungary, we have a participant in Hungary! Finally, candidates will usually try to solve succession issues, because it is a mandate of the program. We particularly favour companies where, within the owner’s family there is no successor; where the controlling shareholder does not want to sell to a competitor or a private equity investment fund; and where there is a personal connection between the retiree and the incoming executive. As succession is a big issue in our economy, the program is not only making a dream come true for these entrepreneurs-to-be, but also solving an issue for society. As the selection process is very strict, these business owners know, that when someone representing the program is knocking at the door, that individual comes with accreditation and quality and is sponsored by the program members with capital to follow-through on the closing of the acquisition. Where would you like to see the program 10 years from now? Ideally, we will become a global program. After consolidating our operations in Europe and North America, the plan is to expand to emerging markets, with regional programs. Currently we have two in mind, one in Latin-America and the other in India. There are also other developed markets where this issue is quite important: Japan and Australia. Australia is a bit easier to access, as it is a smaller market and English is the REXMSREPPERKYEKI-R.ETER]SYHIƤRMXIP][ERXXSƤRH an open partner, as cultural issues and differences are quite relevant. Why emerging markets? We want to be able to support executive talents who have the skills to become entrepreneurs but have not had the means to acquire the right level of education or expertise. One of my personal dreams, for example, would be India and to be able to partner up with a local entrepreneurial family SJƤGIERHHIZIPSTXLITEVXRIVWLMTMRXS[LEX[IEVI currently creating with top business schools in Europe. Furthermore, being able to offer scholarships through an education program to very talented individuals who HSRSXLEZIXLIƤRERGMEP[LIVI[MXLEPXSIRVSPMRXSE Executive/MBA program at a top business school and then segue them into our program. ;LEXMW]SYVEWTMVEXMSRJVSQEƤRERGMEPTIVWTIGXMZI# Are your expectations the same as those of a private equity? It is very different. The motivation driving the performance of the asset class is business savviness and entrepreneurial thinking and acting. Our program is about giving entrepreneurs the opportunity to be successful, to create value. That is why we are different from the conventional private equity approach of doing deals, where overall it is more about financial engineering, trying to squeeze as much as possible out of the target company to increase shareholder return at the private equity capital provider level. The compensation structure is also very different. The purpose of the program is to sponsor the participants to find companies and create value at the acquired company.
