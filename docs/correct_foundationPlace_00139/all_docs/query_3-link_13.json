        "text": "SNP SE and Scheer GmbH Seal Agreement on Strategic Partnership\n\n- SNP and Scheer join forces to enable customers to implement transformation projects quickly and flexibly using SNP's CrystalBridge(R) software\n\n- The four-year contract focuses on migrations to SAP S/4HANA\n\nHeidelberg and Saarbrücken/Germany, Oct. 20, 2020 - SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner SE, a world-leading provider of software solutions for digital transformation processes and automated data migrations, and Scheer GmbH, an IT consulting firm focusing on business and process management in the SAP environment, have signed a contract for a strategic partnership. The cooperation agreement focuses on the use of the SNP software CrystalBridge(R) - The Data Transformation Platform by Scheer's customers, primarily in the DACH region and the Benelux countries. The Gold Partnership agreement was concluded at the end of September and has a term of four years.\n\nWith this strategic partnership, both IT companies want to enable customers to carry out complex transformation projects quickly and securely by harnessing SNP software for automated data migration. This particularly applies to migrations to SAP S/4HANA - also in conjunction with a cloud transition to Microsoft Azure. Scheer will provide process consulting and the system conversion \"Easy Move to Azure\" including subsequent cloud operation at a fixed price and will also utilize the new SNP software component \"Cloud Move for Azure.\" The IT companies have developed a training plan together to train and certify Scheer employees to use CrystalBridge(R) and provide the best possible service to customers.\n\n\"A growing number of companies are currently facing complex transformation projects, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" says Michael Eberhardt, Chief Operating Officer (COO) at SNP. \"The newly formed strategic partnership with Scheer allows us to provide fast and secure transformations for a large number of customers. Especially for migrations to SAP S/4HANA, we can offer particularly flexible and secure solutions by combining Scheer's extensive consulting expertise with our competence in automated data migration.\"\n\n\"Transformation projects for the move to SAP S/4HANA are a key issue on the agenda of SAP users for the next few years,\" confirms Mario Baldi, CEO at Scheer. \"Thanks to the cooperation with SNP, we can offer our customers an even better basis for their transformation projects - ensured by the use of SNP solutions, successful implementation is delivered in the shortest possible time. The new technological basis enables us to apply our expertise to implement process optimizations more easily.\"\n\nThe strategic partnership between SNP and Scheer builds on their successful cooperation over the past nine years, during which they have already carried out several transformation projects together, including migrations to SAP S/4HANA.\n\nAbout Scheer GmbH\n\nScheer GmbH is the flagship company of the Scheer Group, which has locations in various European countries as well as in the USA, Singapore and Australia.\n\nA consulting company with proven process expertise, Scheer GmbH helps companies to develop new business models, optimize and implement efficient business processes, and operate their IT systems.
