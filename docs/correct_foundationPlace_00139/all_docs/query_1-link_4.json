This is the next milestone in the long-standing partnership of the two companies, which are developing the joint CoE to drive innovation and modernization in an efficient manner. At the heart of the collaboration is IBM’s Rapid Move program, which helps companies to implement their SAP S/4HANA transformation. The program is leveraging the SNP software platform CrystalBridge addressing the growing market of hybrid S/4HANA migrations.\n\nWith the new CoE, IBM and SNP are creating a highly efficient and scalable “delivery engine” with global reach.

Together with SNP, we enable companies to modernize and optimize their business-critical SAP workloads in an unmatched way – and we have been doing so for many years. We understand our clients' desire for hybrid SAP S/4HANA transformations, and the IBM Rapid Move Center of Excellence is just the supercharger it needs.\"\n\nJens Amail, CEO at SNP, adds: “The powerful synergies between IBM's Transformation Consulting expertise and our market-leading software platform CrystalBridge accelerate the delivery of tangible business value to our clients. Together, we have already facilitated the efficient and secure move of over 100 companies to SAP S/4HANA, and the demand for software-based hybrid migrations continues to grow. It is amazing to see what has already been achieved in this partnership, and we are thrilled about what’s ahead – this is just the beginning of our journey.”\n\nAbout SNP\n\nSNP (ticker: SHF.DE) helps companies worldwide to unlock the full potential of their data and shape their own tailored journey towards a digital future.\n\nSNP’s Data Excellence Platform CrystalBridge® and the BLUEFIELD™ approach have set a comprehensive industry standard for restructuring and modernizing SAP systems faster and more securely while harnessing data-driven innovations in the cloud.\n\nThe company works with around 2,600 customers of all sizes and in all industries worldwide, including 21 of the DAX40 and 95 of the Fortune 500.
