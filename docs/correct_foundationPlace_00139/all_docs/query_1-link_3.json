        "text": "In 2023, order entry increased to approx. EUR 266 million, and group revenue to around EUR 203 million.\n\nOperating results (EBIT) improved significantly by approx. EUR 4 million to around EUR 11 million; currency-adjusted, the increase would be approx. EUR 11 million versus 2022.\n\nOperating cash flow turned positive, totaling around EUR 12 million in 2023.\n\nHeidelberg, January 31, 2024 – SNP SE (ISIN: DE0007203705), a leading provider of software solutions for digital transformations, automated data migrations, and data management in the SAP ecosystem, achieved significant growth for all key financial indicators in 2023.\n\nAccording to the preliminary and unaudited figures for the fiscal year 2023, the company expects order entry of around EUR 266 million for the full year, which will be around 10% higher than the mean value of the recently published order entry forecast (EUR 230 to EUR 250 million). Compared to the previous year, this reflects an increase of around 37% (order entry 2022: EUR 193.6 million).\n\nGroup revenue will be in line with the most recent forecast despite the significant negative effects of highly volatile exchange rates in Argentina. It will increase by around 17% to approx. EUR 203 million (revenue forecast: between EUR 200 and EUR 205 million, 2022: EUR 173.4 million).\n\nThe operating result (EBIT) is expected to be around EUR 11 million (forecast for EBIT: at the upper range of EUR 5 to 10 million or even slightly higher). This corresponds to an increase of around 60% or around EUR 4 million compared to the previous year (EBIT 2022: EUR 6.8 million); currency-adjusted, the increase would be around EUR 11 million versus 2022.\n\nOperating cash flow improved significantly to around EUR 12 million due to the strong operational performance and enhanced cash management processes (2022: EUR -0.5 million).\n\nJens Amail, CEO of SNP, comments that “2023 was a successful year for SNP. More and more customers and partners put their trust in our solutions, and thanks to the incredible work of our global team we made strong operational progress in all critical areas. Global market leaders like E.ON, TE Connectivity and Würth decided to strategically partner with SNP. The software share of our business increased, our ecosystem is thriving and we show strong growth in our international markets. In addition, I am particularly pleased with the results we have achieved in earnings and operating cash flow, in spite of currency headwind and other one-off effects. Based on this foundation we will continue to execute our operational plan to address the high demand we see in the market, and we optimistically look into 2024 and beyond.”\n\nThe figures are based on preliminary and unaudited Group figures. The company will publish the audited annual financial statements and a forecast for the current fiscal year on March 27, 2024.\n\nAbout SNP\n\nSNP (ticker: SHF.DE) helps companies worldwide to unlock the full potential of their data and shape their own tailored journey towards a digital future.
