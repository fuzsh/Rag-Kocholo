        "text": "As part of the Diamond Initiative, ConVista Consulting AG was once again named “Partner of the Year” by SAP.\n\nFor the first time, the ConVista Group employs more than 1,000 people\n\nThe management team changes: Jörg Renger joins Faktor Zehn as managing director and member of the board of ConVista Consulting AG. At the same time, Pawel Midon, former board member of Axxiome AG, becomes a new board member of Convista. Oliver Kewes, long-time spokesman of the board and Co-CEO, steps down from the board and resigns from his duties as Co-CEO. His tasks will be taken over by Martin Hinz as future CEO and Spokesman of the Board and Dr. Klaus Heimes as Business Unit Manager and responsible for Finance & Analytics.\n\nEnowa AG becomes part of the Convista Group and substantially complements the two core sectors of industry and insurance. Active Business Consult Germany has also joined ConVista Consulting AG, complementing the company’s offering for the industry sector.\n\nWith the “Partner of the Year” award, SAP recognizes the expertise and innovations of ConVista Consulting AG.\n\nConvista will be led by a dual leadership from 2017: Martin Hinz and Oliver Kewes, both of whom have been on the Executive Board for years, will start as co-CEOs.\n\nFounders and existing shareholders of ConVista Consulting AG decide to sell significant parts of their shares to private investors. This secures the company’s financing in the long term and permanently resolves the transition from the founders. The company thus remains independent and privately owned.\n\nConvista is awarded as Great Place to Work® for the eighth time in a row. At the same time, Convista lands in first place among the ten best employers in NRW. In addition, the business magazine “brand eins” lists Convista for the second time as one of the 278 best consultancies in Germany.\n\nIn May, the in-house children’s group goes into operation at the Cologne office, so that new parents can find a quick way back to work.\n\nThe Berlin office also opens its doors at the end of the year. This means that Convista is now represented at five locations in Germany.\n\nIn October, Convista celebrates its 15th founding anniversary.\n\nAround the same time, the consulting firm decides to establish a subsidiary in Singapore as a result of a strong partnership with SAP Asia.\n\nIn the course of the growing internationalization of the group as well as the diversification of its customer base and service portfolio, the Convista Group adapts its organizational structure. This includes, among other things, the introduction of service lines whose structure is based on the consulting focus. The management of the Convista Group, which up to now has been mainly carried out by the parent company, is transferred to the internationally composed Global Board.\n\nWith Faktor Zehn as an expert for Java-based and non-SAP software, Convista strengthens its service offering in the insurance industry in the areas of product and inventory management, mobility and sales and service systems.\n\nTowards the end of the year, Convista opens a new office in São Paulo, Brazil.\n\nThanks to the merger and further personnel recruiting, Convista now has 526 employees.\n\nConvista succeeds in combining business with Fact S.L. Spain. The consulting firm is the market leader for SAP solutions TRM and FAM on the Iberian peninsula. The companies thus effectively combine their SAP expertise.\n\nIn the same year, an Austrian subsidiary is founded with the aim of establishing a local presence and supporting Eastern European business development.\n\nIn total, more than 230 people now work for Convista.\n\nFor the first time, Convista participates in the nationwide “Great Place to Work” competition and immediately lands in the top 10 in the category of companies with 50 to 500 employees.In the same year, CC ConsPrep becomes the first Convista software product to be certified by SAP.\n\nDue to continuous growth and the resulting increase in the number of employees, the Cologne office moves to the Rheinauhafen. Convista now employs 117 people worldwide.\n\nStrong growth and the battle for the best employees are some of the reasons for converting the German parent company into an AG in 2002. This decision now enables a large number of employees to acquire shares in Convista.\n\nThe company has 38 employees.\n\nConvista expands as early as 2000. A stock corporation is founded in Switzerland to meet the growing demand for expertise there. The company concept is based on that of Germany. Here, too, the company is organized and managed as a partnership.\n\nAt its core is the idea of combining technical consulting with professional understanding to achieve the best possible benefit for the customer. With SAP as the technology basis, the consulting focus was placed on the processes of the insurance industry. At this point, eight employees work for Convista in the newly opened Cologne office."
