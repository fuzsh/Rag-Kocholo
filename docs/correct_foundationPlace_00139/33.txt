Heidelberg, March 30, 2023 – SNP Schneider-Neureither & Partner SE, a world-leading provider of software for digital transformations, automated data migrations and data management in the SAP environment, achieved a year-on-year increase in order entry, revenue and EBIT in the fiscal year under review. Revenue increased by 3.9% to EUR 173.4 million compared with the previous year. On a like-for-like basis, group revenue increased by 9% (2021 like-for-like: EUR 169.4 million). Both the Service business and the high-margin Software business contributed to this increase. At the same time, EBIT increased by 8% to EUR 6.8 million (2021: EUR 6.3 million). The EBIT margin increased slightly to 3.9% (2021: 3.8%). SNP is confident that it will be able to achieve further growth by continuing to implement its growth strategy in 2023 and in the coming years.

Jens Amail, CEO of SNP, points out: “While we did not meet the targets we set ourselves, we can look back on a successful 2022: The highest annual revenues in the history of the company demonstrate how resilient and innovative our business model is. In 2023, we will drive our successful software and partner strategy to the next level, aligning all processes of the company with the critical success factors of a software business and expanding our international footprint. This will enable sustainable and profitable growth”.

Software and partner strategy boosts revenue and earnings

Group revenue increased by 3.9% to EUR 173.4 million (2021: EUR 167.0 million). Of this, Service revenues accounted for EUR 117.3 million or approx. 68% (2021: EUR 115.8 million or approx. 69%). At EUR 56.1 million, Software revenues accounted for around 32% of group revenue (2021: EUR 51.2 million or approx. 31%). On a like-for-like basis, group revenue increased by 9% (2021 like-for-like: EUR 169.4 million). Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) reached EUR 6.8 million, around 8% above the previous year’s figure of EUR 6.3 million. Accordingly, the EBIT margin also increased slightly to 3.9%, up from 3.8% in the previous year.

SNP successfully drove forward its software and partner strategy in fiscal year 2022. At the technical level, the software platform CrystalBridge® was expanded and, in particular, supplemented with the product SNP Glue (software for connecting to cloud data platforms) and the SNP OutboardTM Suite (automated data archiving, decommissioning and housekeeping).

SNP has therefore bundled its software solutions together to a greater extent. In the partner business, transformation factories were set up to help ensure that SNP products are increasingly included in partner sales. SNP also further expanded its global partner network and now maintains contractual relationships with 14 of the 20 largest IT consulting companies. At the end of 2022, SNP sold its remaining shares in its Polish consulting unit, therefore simplifying the group structure and placing a stronger focus on its core business – software-based data migrations and data management in the SAP environment.

Order entry on a like-for-like basis around 10% up on previous year

Order entry was slightly up on the previous year at EUR 193.6 million (2021: EUR 192.1 million). This order entry growth was especially driven by the software and partner strategy, which continues to gain market acceptance. On a like-for-like basis, order entry increased by around 10%. The Service segment accounted for EUR 128.2 million of the order entry, the Software segment for EUR 54.9 million and the EXA segment for EUR 10.5 million. Around 33% of the order entry was generated via partners. Compared with the previous year, the order backlog decreased slightly by 3% to EUR 131.8 million. This was due in particular to adjustments for exchange rate fluctuations and project volumes that were ultimately not ordered.

Equity ratio increases by 2.1% to 40.5%

SNP is also very well positioned in terms of capital. Compared with the end of the previous year, equity increased by EUR 5.0 million to EUR 107.2 million. With a slightly lower balance sheet total, the equity ratio reached 40.5% (2021: 38.4%). Following the issuing of five-year promissory notes with a total volume of EUR 32.5 million, non-current liabilities increased by EUR 18.8 million, while current liabilities decreased by EUR 24.9 million.

Outlook for 2023: Growth in order entry, revenue and EBIT

SNP expects positive business development in fiscal year 2023. For 2023 as a whole, the SNP Group expects the following:

• Order entry and revenue will be driven in particular by the software and partner strategy, which continues to gain market acceptance, and growth rates will be significantly above those of the previous year (order entry 2022: EUR 193.6 million; revenue 2022: EUR 173.4 million).

• EBITDA and the operating result (EBIT) will increase at a moderately higher percentage rate than revenue (EBITDA 2022: EUR 17.6 million; EBIT 2022: EUR 6.8 million).
