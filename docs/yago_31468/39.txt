The correct answer is A. John McCarthy.

LISP is a programming language that was created by John McCarthy in 1958. It is one of the oldest programming languages still in use today. LISP is a functional programming language, which means that it focuses on the functions that a program performs rather than the data that it manipulates. This makes LISP well-suited for artificial intelligence applications.

Marvin Minsky was a cognitive psychologist and computer scientist who was one of the founders of artificial intelligence. He did not create LISP.

Alan Turing was a mathematician and computer scientist who is considered to be the father of theoretical computer science. He did not create LISP.

Allen Newell and Herbert Simon were cognitive psychologists and computer scientists who were also founders of artificial intelligence. They did not create LISP.
