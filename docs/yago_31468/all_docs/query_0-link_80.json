How come he doesn’t get more attention, from the informatics press? [McCarthy’s life ended in 2011 after these comments were made.]\n\nAnd he seems not alone in this, same applies to EdsgerDijkstra and DonaldKnuth, maybe Knuth gets some attention, but not much. [Dijkstra’s life ended in 2002 after these comments were made.]"
