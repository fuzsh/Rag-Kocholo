The Project JMC team is continuing to help realize his objective. In this site you will find all John's work, including his social commentary, and acknowledgements of his outstanding contributions and impact. Additional comments, suggestions, stories, photographs and videos on John and his work are very welcome. Please send them to the Project JMC team.\n\nStanford University celebrated John's extraordinary accomplishments in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Sunday March 25, 2012 during the AAAI Spring Symposium.\n\nJohn McCarthy remains an inspiration. Enjoy your exploration of his website!"
