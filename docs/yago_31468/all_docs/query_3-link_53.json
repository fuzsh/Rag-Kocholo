        "text": "Artificial intelligence researcher, John McCarthy, has died. He was 84.\n\nThe American scientist invented the computer language LISP.\n\nIt went on to become the programming language of choice for the AI community, and is still used today.\n\nProfessor McCarthy is also credited with coining the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" in 1955 when he detailed plans for the first Dartmouth conference. The brainstorming sessions helped focus early AI research.\n\nProf McCarthy's proposal for the event, external put forward the idea that \"every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".\n\nThe conference, which took place in the summer of 1956, brought together experts in language, sensory input, learning machines and other fields to discuss the potential of information technology.\n\nOther AI experts describe it as a critical moment.\n\n\"John McCarthy was foundational in the creation of the discipline Artificial Intelligence,\" said Noel Sharkey, Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield.\n\n\"His contribution in naming the subject and organising the Dartmouth conference still resonates today.\"\n\nProf McCarthy devised LISP at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which he detailed in an influential paper in 1960, external.\n\nThe computer language used symbolic expressions, rather than numbers, and was widely adopted by other researchers because it gave them the ability to be more creative.\n\n\"The invention of LISP was a landmark in AI, enabling AI programs to be easily read for the first time,\" said Prof David Bree, from the Turin-based Institute for Scientific Interchange.\n\n\"It remained the AI language, especially in North America, for many years and had no major competitor until Edinburgh developed Prolog.\""
