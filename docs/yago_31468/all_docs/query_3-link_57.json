        "text": "AI has become so ingrained in our everyday lives that it's difficult to comprehend life without it\n\nIt is undeniable that the technology industry has seen a wide variety of innovations over the years. The use of artificial intelligence at any level has proved to be fantastic. It automated a significant number of workers, reducing human effort and has led everyone to believe that there is even more to come.\n\nAs per report of Artificial Solutions, \"Recent results from a large survey of machine learning researchers predict AI will outperform humans in many activities in the next ten years, such as translating languages (by 2024) all the way to working as a surgeon (by 2053). Researchers also believe there is a 50% chance of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years and of automating all human jobs in 120 years.\"\n\nNearly every aspect of our lives is being affected by artificial intelligence machines in order to boost profitability and enhance our human capabilities. AI has become so ingrained in our everyday lives that it's difficult to comprehend life without it.\n\nAs a result, we will be eternally grateful to those who were the driving force behind this incredible technology and who have contributed to making computer science even more human-like and efficient.\n\nWhat is the root of the word \"Artificial Intelligence\"?\n\nAfter playing a significant role in defining the area devoted to the creation of intelligent machines, John McCarthy, an American computer scientist pioneer and inventor, was called the \"Father of Artificial Intelligence.\" In his 1955 proposal for the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, the first artificial intelligence conference, the cognitive scientist coined the term. The intention was to see if there was a way to create a machine that could think abstractly, solve problems, and develop itself like a human. \"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can, in principle, be described so precisely that a machine can be made to simulate it,\" he claimed.\n\nMajor AI Accomplishments by John McCarthy\n\nProgramming languages, the Internet, the web, and robots are just a few of the world's technological innovations that John paved the way for. He coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence,\" invented the first programming language for symbolic computation, LISP (which is still used as a preferred language in the field of AI), and invented and established time-sharing. Human-level AI and commonsense reasoning were two of his major contributions.\n\nAccording to Britannica, \"McCarthy received (1951) a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton University, where he briefly taught. He also held professorships at Dartmouth College (1955–58), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1958–62), and Stanford University (1953–55 and 1962–2000).\"\n\nHis efforts in the field of artificial intelligence have been immaculate throughout his career. McCarthy's contributions were widely recognized and he received numerous awards. He has won a number of prestigious awards, including:\n\nIn 1971, he received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery.\n\nIn 1988, the Kyoto Prize was awarded.\n\nIn 1990, he was awarded the National Medal of Science in Statistical, Computational Sciences, and Mathematics by the United States of America.\n\nIn 2003, the Franklin Institute awarded him the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Cognitive Science and Computers."
