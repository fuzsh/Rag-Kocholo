INDIAai's expert team will answer your questions.\n\nSend your questions to: askindiaai@mail.nasscom.in.\n\nWhat distinguishes Artificial Intelligence from Human Intelligence? - Krithik Sai, Mangalore.\n\nArtificial Intelligence tries to make computers that can act and do things like humans, while Human Intelligence tries to make people more adaptable by combining different ways of thinking. The human brain is analogue, while machines are digital.\n\nArtificial intelligence is based on human insights that we can figure out in a way that machines can do tasks easily, from the most basic to the most complicated. On the other hand, manufactured insights aim to learn, solve problems, think, and see. Furthermore, human intelligence and behaviour come from what people have done in the past. And it's all based on people's ability to change their surroundings with their knowledge.\n\nWho is the father of Artificial Intelligence? - Mangalam Krishnan, Trichy.\n\nResearchers have used the phrase \"artificial intelligence\" and its associated technology for a long time. This technology has been around for a lot longer than you might think.\n\nHere are some crucial events in the history of AI.\n\nJohn McCarthy was one of the most influential people in the field. He is known as the \"father of artificial intelligence\" because of his fantastic work in Computer Science and AI. McCarthy coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in the 1950s. He defined it as \"the science and engineering of making machines that are smart.\"\n\nAlan Mathison Turing, a British logician and computer pioneer, did some of the first significant work in artificial intelligence in the middle of the 20th century. In 1935, Turing wrote about an abstract computer with an infinite memory and a scanner that moved symbol by symbol through the memory, reading what it found and writing more symbols.\n\nIn 1955, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon made \"Logic Theorist,\" which they called the \"first artificial intelligence program.\"\n\nYann Andr√© LeCun is a French computer scientist focusing on machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience. LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoffrey Hinton all worked on deep learning and won the 2018 Turing Award. This award is often called the \"Nobel Prize of Computing.\" People sometimes call the three the \"Godfathers of AI\" or the \"Godfathers of Deep Learning.\"\n\nGeoffrey Everest Hinton is a cognitive psychologist and computer scientist born in Britain and living in Canada. He is best known for his work on artificial neural networks. Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun won the 2018 Turing Award for their work on deep learning, also done by Hinton. Some people call them the \"Godfathers of AI\" or the \"Godfathers of Deep Learning.\"\n\nYoshua Bengio is a Canadian computer scientist best known for his work on deep learning and artificial neural networks. People sometimes call Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun the \"Godfathers of AI\" and the \"Godfathers of Deep Learning.\"\n\nWhat advantages do conversational AI chatbots have for FinTech companies? - Suratkumar, Banaras\n\nFintech companies need AI-powered chatbots to keep customers interested and make them feel heard and valued. It improves the overall customer experience even more, which leads to a significant increase in sales and income. On the other hand, chatbots are always on and give precise answers to customers' questions. Fintech chatbots can help people make decisions quickly and provide unbiased financial advice. They have access to such information, including details about how markets work and how liquid money is. So, chatbots in fintech have the following benefits in addition to being able to solve customer problems quickly:\n\nChatbots provide a prompt and concise response to a client's question in a supportive manner. Also, it is always available, with no breaks, so that customers can get their questions answered quickly.\n\nClients only need clear explanations for any complicated financial process. Chatbots give clients a smooth experience by getting rid of any problems that might come up.\n\nThey have a lot of ways to verify your identity, ensuring that your information stays safe and doesn't get out by accident.\n\nA conversational AI chatbot gives better customer service because it can answer questions, take complaints, and give personalized advice.\n\nDo directors choose the actors who most closely resemble the historical characters in movies based on actual events using AI, computer vision, etc.? - Harini Nagaraj, Chennai.\n\nNot at all. First and foremost, the director's purpose is to tell a compelling story, which frequently necessitates some factual embellishment (or a lot). Much less important than casting a talented actor or, in some cases, an established star in the role is a resemblance to the actual person. If the individual is well-known, makeup can enhance the similarity."
