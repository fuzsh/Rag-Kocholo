There are a lot of \"clever\" C algorithms, that rely on the fact, that 0 is false and every other value isn't.\n\nThe same applies at large to API calls, like in POSIX or Linux kernel, some of which return 0 on failure, while some -1 (there's a rule of thumb, when to apply which, but it is just folklore, so often it is broken). Considering the fact, that at McCarthy's time, those things weren't developed yet, you can see his \"prophetic\" power even here."
