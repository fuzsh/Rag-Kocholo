Lisp provided us with the ability to write the algorithms that we needed.\n\nWe can search thousands of pricing and scheduling options in the time it takes the other airline engines to search several hundred. And, thanks to our lisp-based algorithms, we can adapt our questions to become more narrow or broad depending on the situation."
