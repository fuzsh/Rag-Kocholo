        "text": "Well, technically, McCarthy didn't actually create LISP, the way we know it. McCarthy created a formalism for reasoning about programs, that looked a fair amount like LISP, but not exactly. Steve \"Slug\" Russell realized that it would not be difficult to implement that formalism in a computer program on the IBM 704, and did so.\n\nIt was a bug in that original program that gave us the traditional formatting of LISP lists. The code was supposed to display\n\n(A, B, C)\n\nand a bug caused it to display\n\n(A B C)\n\ninstead. Everyone who saw it liked the comma-less form better, and the bug became a feature.\n\nThe names CAR and CDR came directly from the IBM 704 architecture."
