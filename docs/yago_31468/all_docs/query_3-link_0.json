        "text": "John McCarthy (born September 4, 1927, Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.—died October 24, 2011, Stanford, California) was an American mathematician and computer scientist who was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence (AI); his main research in the field involved the formalization of commonsense knowledge.\n\nMcCarthy received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics (1948) from the California Institute of Technology and a doctorate in mathematics (1951) from Princeton University, where he briefly taught. He also held professorships at Dartmouth College (1955–58); the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1958–62), where he worked on the earliest time-sharing systems; and Stanford University (1953–55 and 1962–2000), where he founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab (SAIL), one of the leading centres for research in the field.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nComputers and Technology Quiz\n\nMcCarthy coined the term artificial intelligence in 1955, and he created the computer programming language LISP in 1958. LISP was initially used primarily by the AI community, owing to its great flexibility due to its expressive power. Though its use declined in the 1990s, in the 21st century there was renewed interest in LISP, especially in the open-source community."
