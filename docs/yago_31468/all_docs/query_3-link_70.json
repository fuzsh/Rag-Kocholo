        "text": "John McCarthy\n\nFounder, Managing Partner\n\nJohn McCarthy, Founder/Managing Partner of McCarthy Strategic Solutions, LLC, is the most experienced and connected Republican lobbyist in Kentucky with over three decades of managing political, policy, and corporate operations at the highest levels. At every seminal moment of politics and policy in recent Kentucky history, John McCarthy has been squarely in the middle of shaping the Commonwealth’s future.\n\nJohn opened his lobbying shop in 2005 after a long and successful career as a political operative and government official. He served as Chairman of the Republican Party of Kentucky in 2004 after serving as the Special Assistant to Governor Ernie Fletcher in 2003. Prior to joining the Fletcher Administration, John built a successful government affairs practice for a law firm and served as a senior-level government affairs official for Humana and Columbia HCA. In 1990, John volunteered on the reelection campaign of U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Four years later, he ran one of the most important congressional campaigns in the nation, electing Ron Lewis from Kentucky’s second district (a special election which portended the revolution to come).\n\nAlong the way, John also served as a senior aide on a gubernatorial campaign and at the Republican Party of Kentucky. He has become a trusted counselor to just about every Kentucky Republican leader of the last 25 years, maintaining relationships in Washington, Frankfort, and in county courthouses across the state. Reflecting this, McCarthy was elected in August 2023 by the Republican Party of Kentucky as National Committeeman on the Republican National Committee.\n\nJohn is an avid fundraiser and advisor to U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell, U.S. Senator Rand Paul, Congressman Brett Guthrie, Governor Matt Bevin’s team, Senate President Robert Stivers, and House Speaker Jeff Hoover. Since 2004, he has played a central role in recruiting candidates and raising money for the eventual GOP takeover of the state House. There isn’t a better-connected Republican in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nIf you are looking for the most loyal, connected Republican lobbyist who has a deep understanding of the complex policy issues shaping our state and nation, John McCarthy is the right counselor for you.\n\nJohn is a graduate from Centre College. He lives in Louisville with his wife Cindy and their three daughters Austin, Eloise, and Charlotte. He volunteers his time to several charitable organizations in the community."
