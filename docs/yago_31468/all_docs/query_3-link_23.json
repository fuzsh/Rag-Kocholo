        "text": "Today at nazaries intelligenia, we celebrate International Inventors' Day.\n\nAs a technology company that develops software products for clients and SaaS, and as developers of IoT technology (Industry 4.0, Smart Cities, etc.), we value the significance of this day: \"Recognizing and promoting the crucial role that inventors have played throughout history.\" As a technology company, we want to honor those figures who, through their contributions to the ICT sector, have become known as \"Great Technological Inventors.\" That's why we want to give a special mention to John McCarthy (1927-2011), a prominent scientist who played a fundamental role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nFrom Humble Beginnings to Shaping the Future of Computing\n\nJohn McCarthy (1927-2011), a prominent scientist who played a pivotal role in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), is remembered as a mathematical prodigy who paved the way for a world of opportunities. Despite his humble origins in a family of European immigrants during the Great Depression, McCarthy displayed his talent from an early age in the field of mathematics.\n\nMcCarthy, whose family moved to Los Angeles in search of employment opportunities due to his younger brother's delicate health, worked in various jobs such as a carpenter and fisherman. Despite his circumstances, McCarthy demonstrated his passion for mathematics by requesting permission from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) to study their used books. This talented teenager made remarkable progress in his studies. By the time he officially enrolled at Caltech to pursue mathematics, he had already attained a considerable amount of knowledge, which enabled him to skip the first two courses. He ultimately graduated in 1948 and obtained his doctorate in 1951 from Princeton, both in mathematics.\n\nHis contributions\n\nHowever, McCarthy's focus was on a much more ambitious goal: creating intelligent machines. In 1956, he organized the influential Dartmouth Conference, where he coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" for the first time. He defined AI as the science and engineering of developing intelligent machines. He proposed that all aspects of learning and intelligence could be precisely described in a way that would allow machines to simulate them.\n\nIn the years that followed, McCarthy established artificial intelligence laboratories at prestigious universities, whose legacy is still evident in current AI research. Despite the technological limitations of the time, McCarthy was an unwavering optimist. He believed that machines could think and argued that the limitations lay not in the machines' capacity but in our inability to write programs that fully harnessed their potential.\n\nIn addition to his fundamental contribution to AI development, McCarthy was also essential in the creation of the LISP (LISt Processor) programming language, which influenced the development of AI. LISP stood out for its programming structure based on lambda calculus and became an essential tool for early computer hackers who attempted to play chess on IBM's primitive machines in the late 1950s.\n\nJohn McCarthy also contributed with the concept of \"General Artificial Intelligence\" (GAI), where he advocated for the creation of AI systems capable of performing a wide variety of tasks in a manner similar to a human, as opposed to AI systems specialized in specific tasks. This idea is known as \"General Artificial Intelligence\" and remains a long-term goal in AI research.\n\nMcCarthy promoted the use of logic and formal reasoning in the construction of AI systems. This implies that machines should be able to represent knowledge and reason logically about it to make informed decisions.\n\nHe also introduced the concept of \"intelligent agents,\" which are AI systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and act accordingly. These agents are a fundamental part of modern AI and are applied in fields such as robotics and recommendation systems.\n\nFurthermore, McCarthy devised the theory of \"time-sharing\" in computing in 1961, allowing multiple users to interact simultaneously with a central computer, a concept that became a cornerstone of the future development of the Internet.\n\nThroughout his career, McCarthy advocated the idea that artificial intelligence should go beyond mimicking behaviours and focus on creating machines that genuinely learn and think like humans. Although, towards the end of his career, he realized that his purist vision of AI was immensely ambitious and challenging, his contributions earned him the prestigious ACM Turing Award in 1971.\n\nIn summary\n\nJohn McCarthy laid the groundwork for Artificial Intelligence by defining its goal, developing key tools like Lisp, advocating for the concept of general AI, and emphasizing logic and reasoning as essential components. His work has had a lasting impact on the field of AI and paved the way for numerous advancements in the creation of intelligent systems.\n\nJohn McCarthy passed away on October 24, 2011, but his legacy endures as the \"father of AI\" and one of the founding fathers of modern computing, leaving an indelible impact on science and technology. His vision continues to inspire generations of scientists and technologists in the pursuit of creating intelligent machines.\n\nWe hope you have enjoyed this article about the life of John McCarthy in our small tribute to one of the \"Fathers of Artificial Intelligence.\""
