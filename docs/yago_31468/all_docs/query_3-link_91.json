        "text": "The Highlander Folk School became known to 1960s activist its pioneering experimental work with \"freedom schools,\" the grass-roots academies held in churches, beauty parlors, and ho the South, that observers agree were crucial to the cognitive lib made the civil rights movement possible (Morris, 1984; McAda Less well known are Highlander's earlier struggles nurturing ind ionism in the South during the 1930s. Highlander is one of many organizations that facilitates progressive collective action among indigenous groups, one of those that Aldon Morris has dubbed \"movement halfway houses.\" In this review we consider Highlander's miraculous longevity in contrast to the seemingly typical instability among this class of organizations by comparing it with the experience of the \"labor colleges.\" These schools offer examples of the little understood phenomena of movement mentoring organizations.\n\nAmerican sociologists have been intrigued with the phenomena of social movements. They have studied and analyzed movements ranging from those on the left-wing aimed at overturning the social order to those on the right-wing aimed at restoring an earlier order. But they have not neglected moderate movements with ameliorative goals or movements with no apparent political goals or implications (e.g., movements related to individual deviance such as alcoholism or to a belief in the end of the world). To understand the rise and fall of all of these movements--and their related movement organizations, which normally are the unit of analysis--sociologists have focused upon members. Leites and Wolf [1970] call this a \"hearts and minds of the people\" approach, which assigns primary importance to the state of consciousness of members and potential members. The development of group consciousness, the relation of a group's life situation to the formation of ideology and to social action have been primary concerns of this study and analysis.\n\nWe stress a different approach. Our \"resource mobilization\" approach emphasizes the resources, beyond membership consciousness and manpower, that may become available to potential movements. These resources support the growth and vitality of movements and movement organizations. This view does not necessarily deny the existence of grievances. It stresses the structural conditions that facilitate the expression of grievances.\n\nAlthough the literature on social movements is vast, there has been surprisingly little systematic analysis of the interaction of social movement organizations (but see James Q. Wilson, 1973; Zald and Ash, 1966; Gusfield, 1966, Nelson. 1974). Of course. practitioners and the practical theorists have developed strategies for interorganizational relations. Lenin knew how to freeze the Mensheviks out in the cold, and his able disciple, Willi Muenzenberger, knew how to create a popular front. Naturally enough. practical theorists have not analyzed the range of possible forms of social movement organization interaction, normally concentrating instead upon problems of the moment.\n\nDuring the 1970s a theoretical shift occurred in social movement and collective behavior scholarship. Movement was away from grievances, relative deprivation, and interactional processes and towards organizational structura4 and political factors. Dramatic changes in the research methodologies were also associated with the shift. We explore those changes with a systematic comparison of research articles in major U.S. journals of sociology before and after the theoretical realignment. Between the early 1960s and the recent period, research designs became far more diverse, supplanting the earlier methodological hegemony of survey designs. Researchers increasingly utilized units of analysis other than individuals and employed mobilizing and political opportunity structures as key independent variables.\n\nThe waves of public protest events that accompanied the early years of the transition from Communism in the former Soviet republic of Belarus offer the opportunity to explore the short-term interaction between state repression and the ongoing choice of protest form by challengers. Using police (militia) records of public protest events between 1990 and 1995, we examine the evolving choice of protest form by collective actors in Belarus. We develop expectations about how the strength of social actors interacts with the extent and form of state repression in shaping protest form. Analyses show that as democratic access expanded and state repression waned during a \"democratic opening\" weak collective actors came to dominate the protest arena, staging mostly pickets and vigils. As state repression escalated, however, strong collective actors reentered the protest arena, but, in response to the escalating state repression, employed mostly the picket/vigil protest form that, during less repressive times, had been the weapon of the weak collective actors.\n\nProtest events occur in historical time and geographical place. In the U.S., some places are now constitutionally privileged with respect to citizen access and free assembly and speech. These venues are known as the traditional commons or the public forum. It is our contention that in recent years (1) these spaces have been shrinking in number, (2) citizens have experienced increasing difficulty in gaining unrestricted access to them, and (3) such venues are no longer where most people typically congregate in large numbers. Nevertheless, as we will show, when citizens gather to express dissenting views toward the government at the turn of the twentieth century they overwhelmingly choose spaces in the public forum to do so.\n\nJohnson, Erik and John D. McCarthy. 2005. “The Sequencing of Transnational and National Social Movement Mobilization: The Organizational Mobilization of the Global and U.S. Environmental Movements.” Pp. 71-94 in Transnational Protest and Global Activism. Donatella Della Porta and Sidney Tarrow (eds.) Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlfield.\n\nIs the mobilization of national and transnational social movements, as reflected in their organizational dynamics, mainly a top down or bottom up process? That is, does the increasing density of populations of transnational social movement organizations (TSMOs) promote subsequent growth in the density of populations of state level social movement organizations (SMOs), or visa versa? We approach the research question by analyzing the co-evolution of the populations of transnational and national environmental SMOs in the U.S. between 1945 and 2000. Our findings indicate that, early in the period under observation, growth in the population density and rate of founding among national environmental SMOs preceded growth among international TSMOs, demonstrating a clear sequence in the rapid emergence of the two movement populations. There is some indication that this process is reversed temporarily in the more recent time period. We discuss the generalizability of these results to other nations, movement populations, and levels of geographical scope. We conclude with a brief discussion of the elements necessary to construct a more rigorous test of the top-down thesis of mobilization."
