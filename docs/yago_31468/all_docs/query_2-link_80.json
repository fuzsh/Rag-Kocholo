        "text": "Definition\n\nLISP is a multi-paradigm family of programming languages. It was and is popular in artificial intelligence research, but also for teaching programming fundamentals in elite schools.\n\n“Lisp is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized syntax. Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older. Like Fortran, Lisp has changed a great deal since its early days, and a number of dialects have existed over its history. Today, the most widely known general-purpose Lisp dialects are Common Lisp and Scheme. (Wikipedia, retrieved 17:56, 10 April 2008 (UTC))”\n\n“Common Lisp is well suited to large programming projects and explorative programming. The language has a dynamic semantics which distinguishes it from languages such as C and Ada. It features automatic memory management, an interactive incremental development environment, a module system, a large number of powerful data structures, a large standard library of useful functions, a sophisticated object system supporting multiple inheritance and generic functions, an exception system, user-defined types and a macro system which allows programmers to extend the language. CMUCL, retrieved 17:56, 10 April 2008 (UTC)).”\n\nOn a personal note: LISP is the only programming language, the main contributor to this Wiki ever liked. Same is true for a special purpose PC I worked with in the late eighties, a Symbolics 3620. It was the future in many ways. I started this page because I do teach some more recent stuff like JavaScript or PHP basics to non-programmers and sometimes (like today) I just wonder why those languages are so ugly and so unreliable compared to what we had 20 years ago and after some googling I found out that LISP and even AI is well alive and maybe even coming back a bit. Maybe I should trash PHP teaching at TECFA and go for Scheme instead :)\n\nToday, there are still several popular flavors of LISP, e.g.\n\nCommonLISP (the dominant LISP before the 90' \"AI winter\"\n\nScheme\n\nEmacsLISP (to program the Emacs editor)\n\nFurthermore, there exist libraries for various programming languages and that implement subsets of LISP or Scheme or implement at least some features.\n\nIn education\n\nA large part (or even the majority) of Intelligent tutoring systems have been programmed in LISP or on top of expert system engines programmed in LISP.\n\nLisp-based web servers can be used to implement adaptive hypertext systems.\n\nTutorials and documentation\n\nShort introductions and overviews\n\nWhat made LISP different, by Paul Graham, 2002.\n\nCrossing borders: The beauty of Lisp by Bruce Tate, IBM DeveloperWorks, Feb 2007.\n\nLisp (programming language) (Wikipedia)\n\nBeginner's tutorials\n\nA Quickstart to Common Lisp by Nick Gibson.\n\nLisp for the Web by Adam Petersen, April 2008\n\nBooks\n\nThe Common Lisp Cookbook, a “book containing recipes and other information about the preparation and cooking of food.

It is open source / free software, with a permissive license. In addition to the compiler and runtime system for ANSI Common Lisp, it provides an interactive environment including a debugger, a statistical profiler, a code coverage tool, and many other extensions.”. A branch from CMUCL, it runs on a number of POSIX platforms, and experimentally on Windows.\n\nCLISP. “CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, CLOS, MOP, a foreign language interface, i18n, POSIX and Perl regular expressions, a socket interface, fast bignums, arbitrary precision floats, and more.”. Runs under Linux, MacOS X and Windows (via cywin)\n\nCMUCL. A free implementation of the Common Lisp programming language which runs on most major Unix platforms.\n\nGCL The GNU implementation of Common Lisp.\n\nClozure CL “(often called CCL for short) is a free Common Lisp implementation with a long history. Some distinguishing features of the implementation include fast compilation speed, native threads, a precise, generational, compacting garbage collector, and a convenient foreign-function interface.”\n\nCommercial\n\nAllegro Common Lisp (Franz Inc.)\n\nLispWorks.
