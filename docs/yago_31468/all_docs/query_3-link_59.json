        "text": "Profession: Computer Scientist\n\nBiography: John McCarthy was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist who made seminal contributions to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) as an academic discipline. He is widely regarded as one of the founding fathers of AI, having coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" in 1955 and organized the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, which marked the formal beginning of AI research.\n\nMcCarthy's most significant contributions to AI include his development of the Lisp programming language in 1958, which became the primary programming language for AI research and is still used today. He also introduced the concept of time-sharing, a method that allows multiple users to share computing resources simultaneously, which was a major breakthrough in the early days of computing.\n\nThroughout his career, John McCarthy was a leading figure in AI research and a key advocate for the field. He founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) in 1963 and received numerous accolades for his work, including the Turing Award in 1971.\n\nBorn: September 4, 1927\n\nBirthplace: Boston, Massachusetts, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rabbit\n\nStar Sign: Virgo\n\nDied: October 24, 2011 (aged 84)"
