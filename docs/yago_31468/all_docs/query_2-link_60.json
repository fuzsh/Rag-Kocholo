        "text": "Today, there are two of the most common AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer programming languages are LISP and Prolog. They are designed with two distinct programming paradigms, and LISP is a functional language, whereas Prolog is a formal language. The main difference between these languages is that LISP was considered a computation model based on the theory of recursive functions. In contrast, the prolog includes a set of formal logic specifications that employ first-order predicate calculus.\n\nIn this article, you will learn about the difference between LISP and Prolog. But before discussing the differences, you must know about LISP and Prolog with their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat is LISP?\n\nLISP is an abbreviation for \"LISt Processing\". Lisp is a computer programming language family. It is a functional computer language that was created and used by John McCarthy and the MIT group in 1960. It was primarily utilized in the computer science research initiatives, such as those involving artificial intelligence (including theorem proving, intelligent systems, robotics, natural language processing, etc.).\n\nThe most distinguishing characteristic of LISP language from other languages is the equivalence of forms between program and data, which means that LISP can execute data structures as programs, and programs may be altered as data. Furthermore, despite iteration, it is more dependent on recursion as a control mechanism (looping).\n\nLISP generates an interactive environment for running its programs. In an interactive environment, the main program alters the form, and the user inserts the main program as a sequence of expressions to be inspected at the terminal. It doesn't utilize block structure or any other type of complex syntactic organization, and it utilizes calls to communicate with the other functions running simultaneously.\n\nComponents of LISP Programming\n\nThere are mainly two components of LISP programming. These are as follows:\n\n1. Atoms\n\nAtoms are the types of identifiers that are utilized in imperative languages. It includes symbols and numeric values.\n\n2. Lists\n\nThese are an essential component of LISP programming is list processing, which is why they are utilized as a data structure in LISP. Unlike lists in other languages, these lists are defined by delimiting their components within parentheses rather than utilizing the insert and delete operations.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of LISP\n\nThere are various advantages and disadvantages of LISP. Some advantages and disadvantages of LISP are as follows:\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt has clear and concise syntax and semantics.\n\nLisp allows programmers to create faster apps. It helps to develop the app in less time and sprint faster.\n\nIt provides a broad range of primitives for creating, modifying, and removing lists.\n\nLISP notations are referred to as meta-notation or M-notation.\n\nLISP's control structures are relatively straightforward.\n\nLISP functions are completely defined in the form of expressions.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt takes some time to get accustomed to prefix notation and mountains of parentheses.\n\nThere are few job prospects for Lisp developers.\n\nThere isn't anything like a Common Lisp environment.\n\nThe comparatively small ecosystem puts off many users compared to Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++ syntax.\n\nWhat is Prolog?\n\nProlog is a logic computer language that is utilized in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. It is a member of the logic computer language family. Prolog is a declarative language in which computations are carried out by querying the relations that are specified as rules and facts. Prolog was created in 1970, and it is one of the oldest logic programming languages and one of the most common AI programming languages today (along with Lisp). Although it is a free language, there are numerous commercial variants accessible.\n\nOne of the first logic computer languages was Prolog. It aids the users in several tasks, including term rewriting, type systems, theorem proving, expert systems, natural language processing, and automated planning. It also aids in the development of graphical user interfaces (GUI), administrative apps, and networked applications. Furthermore, it is appropriate for rule-based logical inquiries, including template filling, database searching, and voice control systems.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Prolog\n\nThere are various advantages and disadvantages of prolog. Some advantages and disadvantages of prolog are as follows:\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt contains a database of data structures in language and human thinking.\n\nIts execution is based on the definition of predicates.\n\nIt supports pattern matching and backtracking.\n\nIts rules are created using recursive thinking, which is comparable to an applicative language.\n\nIt is declarative, compact, rational, interpretive, and modular by definition.\n\nIt uses simple coding to store and operate data lists.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe \"NOT\" logical condition is not supported by the prolog computer language. It doesn't support negative statements.\n\nIt doesn't support graphic capabilities. If you require visuals, you must utilize the turbo prolog.\n\nThe prologue sequence has an impact on the programming language's efficiency.\n\nIt is difficult to understand the various algorithms and code for input and output processes.\n\nThe \"OR\" logical condition is not supported by the prolog computer language.\n\nIt is a first-order logic programming language. It doesn't explicitly support second-order logic.\n\nKey differences between LISP and Prolog\n\nHere, you will learn the various key differences between LISP and Prolog. Some main differences between LISP and Prolog are as follows:\n\nLisp is the second-oldest high-level computer language after FORTRAN, and it has evolved significantly since its inception. On the other hand, prolog is a logic computer language related to artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.\n\nThe Lisp programming language was designed and developed by John McCarthy. On the other hand, the Prolog language was created by Alain Colmerauer and Robert Kowalski.\n\nLISP programs include functions, conditional evaluation, recursion, and iteration. On the other hand, Prolog is made up of directed control search, patterns, loops, and backtracking.\n\nThe LISP program was released in 1958. In contrast, the prolog program was released in 1972.\n\nLISP and Prolog datatypes are quite distinct, whereas LISP not using predicates. In contrast, Prolog not using property and association lists.\n\nLISP is based on functions in a global environment. In contrast, Prolog is based on rules and facts.\n\nIn LISP, data transit in program function returns, binding of local and global variables, and parameter passing by value are all supported. On the other hand, Prolog binds the data or numbers with the variable via unification.\n\nProlog supports the logical computing paradigm. In contrast, LISP supports the functional, reflective, procedural, and Meta paradigms.\n\nHead-to-head comparison between the LISP and Prolog\n\nHere, you will learn the head-to-head comparison between LISP and Prolog. Various head-to-head comparisons between LISP and Prolog are as follows:\n\nFeatures LISP Prolog Full form LISP is an abbreviation for LISt Processing. It has no full form. Definition It is the second-oldest high-level computer language after FORTRAN, and it has evolved significantly since its inception. It is a logical computer language related to artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Language Types It is functional programming. It is logic programming. Program LISP programs include functions, conditional evaluation, loops, recursion, and iteration. It includes directed control search, patterns, loops, and backtracking. Designer It was designed and developed by John McCarthy. It was created by Alain Colmerauer and Robert Kowalski. Development year It was released in 1958. It wasc released in 1972. Based on It is based on functions in a global environment. It is based on rules and facts. Data Types It has symbolic and numeric atoms, lists and list structure, and property and association lists. It has symbolic and numeric atoms, predicates, lists, and list structures. Transmitting data In LISP, data transit in program function returns, local and global variables binding, and parameter passing by value are all supported. It binds the data or numbers with the variable via unification. Variable It has lexical or dynamic scoping of free variables, bound variables, and local variables using Let blocks. Its variable scope scoping is confined to a single rule or fact. Supported Paradigms It supports the functional, reflective, procedural, and Meta paradigms. It supports the logical computing paradigm.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, LISP and Prolog are common programming languages for developing AI-based applications. The primary distinction between Lisp and Prolog is that LISP is a computer programming language that supports the reflective, functional, algorithmic, and Meta paradigms. In contrast, Prolog is a computer programming language that supports the logic programming paradigm. LISP utilizes mathematical characteristics of functions, which are difficult to program, whereas Prolog utilizes facts, resolution, rules, query, and unification, which are simple and easy to program. Prolog functions similarly to the human brain, employing pattern matching, backtracking, and a hierarchical structure that humans easily understand. On the other hand, LISP is easier for computers to control."
