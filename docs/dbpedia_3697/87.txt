Confederation Centre Art Gallery offers a fascinating array of historic and contemporary Canadian visual arts. The collection and programming reflect Canadian identities, and the origin and development of the country.

During your visit, you will see a mix of traditional art forms such as painting, drawing, printmaking, photography, and sculpture, as well as digital works, installations using various technologies, and contemporary interdisciplinary works.

The Gallery has a national mandate to develop appreciation and understanding of Canadian visual arts, presenting an average of 12 exhibitions each year. There are four main exhibition halls on two levels, plus smaller exhibition spaces at the entrance and in the Frederic S. and Ogden Martin Concourse Gallery of the Centre. In addition, a collection of public sculptures can be found on the L.W. (Lou) MacEachern Plaza.

The Gallery is a public space for your engagement with art and ideas – we hope you will visit often.

Confederation Centre Art Gallery holds a significant collection of Canadian historical, modern, and contemporary art, artifacts, and archival records.

Since the Gallery began collecting in 1964, its holdings have grown to over 17,000 items including a comprehensive research collection on the works of Charlottetown-raised, Robert Harris (1849-1919), painter of the iconic group portrait, The Fathers of Confederation.

While 19th and early 20th century holdings are acquired less frequently than contemporary works, we are fortunate to have pre-Confederation works by such artists as Cornelius Krieghoff, George Thresher, and Fanny Amelia Bayfield. Early 20th century artists George Pepper, Kathleen Daly, and Frederick B. Taylor are collected in some depth.

Québec painter Jean Paul Lemieux’s commissioned mural, Charlottetown Revisited, 1964, is a highlight of the Confederation Mural Collection, as is the 1997 painting, Those Who Share Together Stay Together, by Jane Ash Poitras. The Expo ’67 Collection of Fine Craft, while slightly out of scope, is a fascinating time capsule of that centennial year. Similarly, the L.M. Montgomery Collection of 16 novel manuscripts is a delightful anomaly, with international cultural resonance.

The collection continues to grow through the generosity of donors and we are very grateful for this support.
