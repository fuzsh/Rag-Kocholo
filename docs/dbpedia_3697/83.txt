Waves' Offense Trumps Zags for Eighth-Consecutive Win

Box Score SPOKANE, Wash. â€” Another remarkable offensive effort from the Pepperdine women's volleyball team trumped Gonzaga in Charlotte Y. Martin Centre on Thursday night, as the Waves collected 25-13, 25-23 and 25-20 set wins en route to a sweep and the program's eighth-consecutive victory.

Pepperdine improved to 5-0 in the West Coast Conference and 9-6 overall this season with the win over Gonzaga (3-13, 0-5 WCC). It's the sixth time during the Waves' current winning streak that the team has won in straight sets. It was the second-straight match that the Waves fired off at a .321 clip or higher, as the squad also hit for a .356 clip against San Francisco at home last Saturday.

Three Waves hit for double-figures, all at a .321 clip or higher, led by Birdie Hendrickson who blasted a tied season-high 14 smashes on a season-best .480 success rate. Meg Brown had a team-high .526 hitting percentage while producing 12 kills and Grace Chillingworth posted 11 smashes. It's Chillingworth's 11th double-figure kill match of the season, while Hendrickson and Brown have amassed seven and five double-figure kill matches respectively.

WAVES VS. BULLDOGS

PLAY-BY-PLAY

After exchanging points to open the match, kills from Meg Brown, Vanessa Polk and Birdie Hendrickson pushed the Waves ahead to an 8-5 lead. A block collaboration from Polk and Emily Hellmuth kept the momentum going and more smashes from the same pair of Waves extended Pepperdine's lead to 14-8. The squad would not slow down either, going on another 4-0 run courtesy of more kills from Hendrickson and Grace Chillingworth, eventually leading by 10 at the 22-12 mark. A pair of kills from Hellmuth and Hendrickson, with an attack error from across the net would end the set 25-13 in the Waves' favor.

The second set proved to be tighter than the first after the Zags burst out to a 4-0 run to kick things off. Blocks from Brown and Hellmuth, along with kills from Brown and Chillingworth, tied the score back at 6's. After a short see-saw battle to 11-all, the Bulldogs found a few points to pull ahead by three. Pepperdine was able to capitalize on a few Gonzaga errors to tie things yet again and eventually worked to a 19-17 lead with another set of block collaborations from Chillingworth with either Brown or Polk. Kills from Hellmuth and Chillingworth kept the Waves ahead and a final pair of smashes from Hendrickson closed the set 25-23 and gave the Waves an opportunity to close the match in three.

Though the home team built a 10-6 lead to kick off the third set, successful attacks from Chillingworth and Brown, along with an ace from the latter tied the score at 11-apiece. Three nearly-consecutive kills, with a pair from Polk and one from Chillingworth, fueled a Pepperdine run en route to a 15-11 lead. A pair of smashes from Hendrickson and a solo block from Polk helped the cause and continued the advantage, 18-14. The Waves kept rolling with an ace from Riley Patterson and a pair of kills from Brown and Hendrickson to end the set 25-20 and complete the sweep.
