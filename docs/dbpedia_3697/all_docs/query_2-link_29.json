And in five college seasons and three programs Amber has totaled 1,151 kills, 482 digs, 120 blocks, and 115 service aces.\n\n• She graduated from the University of Georgia with a degree in Risk Management and Insurance and is set to earn a graduate certificate in Leadership Studies from USD.\n\nIsadora Terçariol\n\n• Setter Isadora Terçariol joined the Toreros as a transfer from Brazil in 2020 and has been a valuable contributor to the program ever since, totaling 1,763 assists, 406 digs, 102 blocks, and 41 service aces as USD made three consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n• She has emerged as one of the WCC's top setters in 2023, with her 10.08 assists per set ranking second in the league alongside her first-ever WCC Offensive Player of the Week selection back in October.\n\n• Isadora is set to graduate with degrees in Psychology and Sociology.\n\nA HELPING HAND\n\n• After not seeing any game action last season, Isadora Terçariol has emerged as the WCC's top setter in 2023, averaging 10.21 assists per set through 24 matches that ranks 46th nationally.\n\n• A native of Säo Paulo, Brazil, Terçariol joined the Toreros as a transfer before the pandemic-modified Spring 2021 season.\n\n• She has since totaled 1,786 assists in a San Diego uniform, including a team-high 745 in 2023.\n\n• The 1,500th assist of her career came in USD's 3-0 sweep of Pacific at the JCP on October 7.\n\n• Terçariol was named WCC Offensive Player of the Week on October 9, making her the first San Diego setter to earn the honor since first-team All-American Gabby Blossom was selected on November 7, 2022.\n\nLEYLA BLOCKS WELL\n\n• San Diego native and La Jolla High School alum Leyla Blackwell ranks 24th nationally with an average of 1.31 blocks per set.\n\n• Her 115 total blocks through 25 matches in 2023 are the most on the USD roster and rank second in the WCC.\n\n• Blackwell has been named the WCC Defensive Player of the Week seven times in her career, including twice this season.\n\nMILESTONE WATCH\n\n• Leyla Blackwell notched her 450th career block last Thursday at LMU and is now just 15 away from reaching 500 in her career. She is also just 60.5 career points away from 1,000.\n\n• Madi Allen, who has started the season with 15 consecutive games with at least 10 digs, earned her 1,000th career dig on October 14 at San Francisco.
