        "text": "Morgan Davenport\n\nWomen's Volleyball 10/5/2023 8:21:00 PM by Athletic Communications\n\nWaves' Offense Trumps Zags for Eighth-Consecutive Win\n\nBox Score SPOKANE, Wash. â€” Another remarkable offensive effort from the Pepperdine women's volleyball team trumped Gonzaga in Charlotte Y. Martin Centre on Thursday night, as the Waves collected 25-13, 25-23 and 25-20 set wins en route to a sweep and the program's eighth-consecutive victory.\n\nPepperdine improved to 5-0 in the West Coast Conference and 9-6 overall this season with the win over Gonzaga (3-13, 0-5 WCC). It's the sixth time during the Waves' current winning streak that the team has won in straight sets. It was the second-straight match that the Waves fired off at a .321 clip or higher, as the squad also hit for a .356 clip against San Francisco at home last Saturday.\n\nThree Waves hit for double-figures, all at a .321 clip or higher, led by Birdie Hendrickson who blasted a tied season-high 14 smashes on a season-best .480 success rate. Meg Brown had a team-high .526 hitting percentage while producing 12 kills and Grace Chillingworth posted 11 smashes. It's Chillingworth's 11th double-figure kill match of the season, while Hendrickson and Brown have amassed seven and five double-figure kill matches respectively.\n\nBIG WAVES\n\nBirdie Hendrickson (Rogersville, Mo./Logan-Rogersville HS/Florida): 14 kills, .480 hitting %, 6 digs\n\nGrace Chillingworth (Tustin, Calif./Foothill HS): 11 kills, .321 hitting %, 7 digs, 3 blocks\n\nMeg Brown (Santa Ana, Calif./Mater Dei HS): 12 kills, .526 hitting %, 3 blocks (1 solo), 1 ace\n\nIsabel Zelaya (Tomball, Texas/Concordia Lutheran HS): 36 assists, 9 digs\n\nRiley Patterson (Sonora, Calif./Sonora HS/Pacific): 11 digs, 8 assists, 1 ace\n\nVanessa Polk (Saint Louis, Mo./John Burroughs HS): 6 kills, 4 blocks (1 solo)\n\nEmily Hellmuth (Dallas, Texas/Highland Park HS): 5 kills, 2 blocks (1 solo)\n\nWAVES VS. BULLDOGS\n\nA dominant Waves' attack helped the cause in Spokane, as Pepperdine finished with 49 kills on an impressive .321 success rate, while allowing only 34 kills on a .124 clip across the net. The Waves stunned with 16 kills on a .355 output in the first set alone, while keeping the Zags to six kills on a -.030 hitting percentage. Pepperdine also led 8.0-6.0 in blocks and 43-33 in digs, while Gonzaga led 4-2 in aces throughout the match.\n\nPEPPERDINE ATTACK BY SET\n\nSet K E TA Pct\n\n1 16 5 31 .355\n\n2 15 7 38 .211\n\n3 18 3 37 .405\n\nTTL 49 15 106 .321\n\nGONZAGA ATTACK BY SET\n\nSet K E TA Pct\n\n1 6 7 33 -.030\n\n2 13 8 43 .116\n\n3 15 5 37 .270\n\nTTL 34 20 113 .124\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nAfter exchanging points to open the match, kills from Meg Brown, Vanessa Polk and Birdie Hendrickson pushed the Waves ahead to an 8-5 lead. A block collaboration from Polk and Emily Hellmuth kept the momentum going and more smashes from the same pair of Waves extended Pepperdine's lead to 14-8. The squad would not slow down either, going on another 4-0 run courtesy of more kills from Hendrickson and Grace Chillingworth, eventually leading by 10 at the 22-12 mark. A pair of kills from Hellmuth and Hendrickson, with an attack error from across the net would end the set 25-13 in the Waves' favor.\n\nThe second set proved to be tighter than the first after the Zags burst out to a 4-0 run to kick things off. Blocks from Brown and Hellmuth, along with kills from Brown and Chillingworth, tied the score back at 6's. After a short see-saw battle to 11-all, the Bulldogs found a few points to pull ahead by three. Pepperdine was able to capitalize on a few Gonzaga errors to tie things yet again and eventually worked to a 19-17 lead with another set of block collaborations from Chillingworth with either Brown or Polk. Kills from Hellmuth and Chillingworth kept the Waves ahead and a final pair of smashes from Hendrickson closed the set 25-23 and gave the Waves an opportunity to close the match in three.\n\nThough the home team built a 10-6 lead to kick off the third set, successful attacks from Chillingworth and Brown, along with an ace from the latter tied the score at 11-apiece. Three nearly-consecutive kills, with a pair from Polk and one from Chillingworth, fueled a Pepperdine run en route to a 15-11 lead. A pair of smashes from Hendrickson and a solo block from Polk helped the cause and continued the advantage, 18-14. The Waves kept rolling with an ace from Riley Patterson and a pair of kills from Brown and Hendrickson to end the set 25-20 and complete the sweep.\n\nNEXT UP\n\nOn Saturday, the Waves trek over to Oregon for another WCC matchup, facing Portland at 1 p.m. at Chiles Center.\n\nFOLLOW\n\nFollow the Waves on Facebook and Twitter, @WavesVolleyball, and follow the team on Instagram, @peppvolley.
