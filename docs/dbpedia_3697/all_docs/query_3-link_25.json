Please consider using one of our other centers during this construction work. For more details, please visit North Mecklenburg Recycling Center Construction Project.\n\nSolid Waste and Recycling is a division of the Mecklenburg County Land Use and Environmental Services Agency. It is responsible for managing solid waste processing, overseeing full-service drop off centers, and conducting residential, business and school community outreach efforts focusing on sustainability and waste reduction.\n\nMecklenburg County does not collect curbside materials. The collection at your home is the responsibility of the municipality in which you live.
