        "text": "Dr Charlotte de Mille is Associate Lecturer at The Courtauld Institute, and curates The Courtauld Gallery’s music programme. With them she co–authored Animating Art History, a joint initiative with Central St. Martin’s and the University for the Creative Arts, which was long–listed for a Clore Award in Museum Learning. She recieved a St Andrews University Public Engagement with Research Award 2018 (group award for ‘Virginia Woolf and Music’ project), and a Touring Exhibition Group Bursary in 2017. She was part of the Museums Association Transformers Influence Career Development Programme 2017. She was Visiting Scholar at Lingnan University, Hong Kong in 2018, and Mid-Career Fellow at the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art 2020. This was followed by a Paul Mellon Centre Research Continuity Fellowship in 2021.\n\nHer MA special option is Music and Art: Appropriation, Remediation, Reproduction.\n\nSelected Research\n\nBooks\n\nBergson in Britain: Philosophy and Modern Art 1890-1914 Edinburgh University Press, 2023\n\nThe artist exists ‘to see and make us see what we do not naturally perceive’.\n\nCharlotte de Mille illuminates the pivotal role of Bergson’s philosophy for UK artists and art critics before 1914. Her interdisciplinary approach integrates philosophy, art criticism and art history, offering new avenues for investigation. An Epilogue considers the proximity of Bergson’s thought on temporality, perception, intuition and subjectivity to art history,from Alois Riegl and Aby Warburg to practitioners today.\n\nEdited Collections\n\nThe Bloomsbury Handbook to Music and Art, co-edited with Sarah Mahler Kraaz, Bloomsbury, 2023\n\nThis volume brings together prominent scholars, artists, composers, and directors to present the latest interdisciplinary ideas and projects in the fields of art history, musicology and multi-media practice. Organized around ways of perceiving, experiencing and creating, the book outlines the state of the field through cutting-edge research case studies. For example, how does art-music practice / thinking communicate activist activities? How do socio-economic and environmental problems affect access to heritage? How do contemporary practitioners interpret past works and what global concerns stimulate new works? In each instance, examples of cross or inter-media works are not thought of in isolation but in a global historical context that shows our cultural existence to be complex, conflicted and entwined. A panel of contributors to the volume will introduce key themes and discuss the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration.\n\n‘A new turn in humanities scholarship’ – Simon Shaw Miller, Emeritus Chair of Art History, University of Bristol\n\n‘an agenda for change: both for individuals, artistically and conceptually, and for the myriad collective ways that humans dwell on the planet – Aaron S.
