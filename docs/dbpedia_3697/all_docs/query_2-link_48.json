        "text": "Saint Mary's Athletics / Tod Fierner\n\nWomen's Volleyball 2/12/2021 11:26:00 AM\n\nVB | Saint Mary’s Heads North for Two at Gonzaga\n\nSPOKANE, Wash. — After heading down to the southern-most school in the WCC, Gaels Volleyball now heads north to the northern-most college in the WCC in Gonzaga. Saint Mary's and the Zags will meet up for a pair of matches starting Sunday, February 14 and play on back-to-back days, as is customary during this unique 2021 spring volleyball season,\n\nTHE DETAILS\n\nSaint Mary's Gaels (1-5) at Gonzaga Bulldogs (1-3)\n\nSunday, February 14 at 1:00 pm and Monday, February 15 at 1:00 pm\n\nCharlotte Y. Martin Centre – Spokane, Wash.\n\nWatch Live (Sun.) | Live Stats (Sun.)\n\nWatch Live (Mon.) | Live Stats (Mon.)\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\nThe Gaels were on the road at #21 San Diego last week and were on the wrong end of a pair of straight-set sweeps. Despite the outcome, the Gaels were much improved on Monday in the second match, as they have been all season in the second match of these back-to-backs. Saint Mary's took the Toreros deep into each set, scoring at least 21 points in all three sets on Monday. The closing points weren't there, however, as the Gaels have now lost four-straight within the WCC.\n\nBESTS AFTER THREE\n\nAbigail \"Abby\" Matoso found herself putting up a career-afternoon, setting new personal bests in digs (12) and service aces (3) while she spent the afternoon as the Gaels libero. She also tied a career-best in assists with four, which she accomplished against LMU earlier this season…Saint Mary's did not record an attacking error in the third set to go along with their 14 kills, for a hitting percentage of 42.4%...Chandler Cowell set a new career-best with three assisted blocks in the three sets against San Diego, and she now has career-bests this season in kills, assists, digs, errors, solo blocks, and assisted blocks for single match totals.\n\nABOUT GONZAGA\n\nThe Zags have played four matches this season, with a 1-3 mark thus far. After their opener against San Diego was postponed, they won their first match of the season against Pacific in five sets, but have lost their last three. Kennedy Croft has been the leader of the attack so far for the Zags with 40 kills in four matches, but much like the Gaels, the attack has not been a strength for Gonzaga as a team, attacking at just 14.6% and allowing opponents to hit at 22.6%. Perhaps this match comes down to the service line, where the Gaels are averaging more aces than the Zags, but Gonzaga handles serves a bit better.\n\n#GaelsRise\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#19 Chandler Cowell\n\nOH\n\n5' 10\"\n\nJunior"
