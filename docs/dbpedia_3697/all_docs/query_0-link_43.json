At any time during your visit, please feel free to ask for assistance or guidance from our event staff.\n\nParking\n\nParking is available at prevailing rates in the NASCAR Hall of Fame Parking deck adjacent to the Charlotte Convention Center. Parking for guests with disabilities is also available here, but they must display proper state identification.\n\nDrop off / Pick up\n\nDrivers may drop off and pick up passengers with mobility issues at the South College Street or Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard entrances of the building.\n\nEntrance / Elevators\n\nThe center has accessible entrances from South College Street, Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Brooklyn Village Avenue at the pedestrian bridge entry. We also have accessible entrances at the Caldwell/Ballroom Lobby Entry on Caldwell Street for Crown Ballroom events.\n\nConcessions\n\nConcession stands and food carts are located throughout the center. Upon request, food service hosts will read menus located at each concession outlet.\n\nRestrooms / Water Fountains\n\nAccessible restrooms and water fountains are available throughout the center.\n\nFirst Aid / Emergency Situations\n\nLicensed first aid technicians/EMTs are on staff for most exhibit hall events, and other events expected to exceed 2,000 people. If you need first aid assistance, please contact the nearest security guard or police officer. In the event of an emergency, please follow the directions of emergency personnel and staff.\n\nService Animals\n\nOnly service animals are allowed inside our venues.\n\nUnder the ADA, a service animal is defined as a dog that has been individually trained to do work or perform tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the dog must be directly related to the person's disability. Public entities must allow miniature horses to accompany people with disabilities where reasonable. Four factors may be used to determine what is reasonable:\n\n• The miniature horse is housebroken.\n\n• The miniature horse is under the owners control.\n\n• The facility can accommodate the miniature horses type, size, and weight.\n\n• The miniature horse does not compromises legitimate, necessary safety requirements.\n\nEmotional support, therapy, comfort or companion animals are not considered service animals under the ADA.\n\nThese terms are used to describe animals that provide comfort just by being with a person. Because they have not been trained to perform a specific job or task, they do not qualify as service animals under the ADA.\n\nHEROES CONVENTIONJUNE 14-16, 2024\n\nCharlotte Convention Center\n\n501 S.
