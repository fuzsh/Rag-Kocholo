        "text": "About The Block Collection\n\nThe Block Museum houses a collection of over 6,000 artworks, with a foundation in works on paper, including prints, drawings, and photographs. In recent years The Block has expanded its collection with acquisitions of contemporary art across media by an international array of artists. Recent gifts and purchases have included videos, sculpture, drawings, photographs, and installations by artists such as Paul Chan, Omar Victor Diop, Felix Gonzalez Torres, Catherine Opie, and Carrie Mae Weems. Building upon these strengths the Block continues to seek gifts of art that connect to Northwesternâ€™s broad curriculum and deepen our representation of modern and contemporary culture globally and from diverse perspectives.\n\nThe core of our current collecting mission includes a commitment to living artists; a connection between the past and the present; and a cross-cultural, global perspective.\n\nSearch the Database\n\nMost Recent Acquisitions"
