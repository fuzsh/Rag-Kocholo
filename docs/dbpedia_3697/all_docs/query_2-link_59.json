        "text": "San Diego travels to Gonzaga, Portland this week\n\nSan Diego Toreros (11-9, 8-2 WCC) • Gonzaga (6-14, 3-6 WCC) • Portland (16-5, 5-2 WCC)\n\nCharlotte Y. Martin Centre • Spokane, Wash. | Chiles Center • Portland, Ore.\n\nLive Stream • theW.tv | Live Statistics • USDToreros.com\n\nSocial • Facebook.com/USDVolleyball • Twitter.com/USDVolleyball • Instagram.com/USDVolleyball SAN DIEGO – San Diego begins a two-week stretch of three road matches this week when it travels to Gonzaga and Portland.\n\nThe Toreros (11-9, 8-2 WCC) have swept four straight conference opponents and are in second place at the midway point of the WCC season.\n\nUSD swept both the Pilots (16-5, 5-2 WCC) and the Bulldogs (6-14, 3-6 WCC) earlier this season at home.\n\nBoth matches will be streamed on theW.tv and live statistics will be available via USDToreros.com.\n\nLAST TIME OUT\n\n• The Toreros extended its winning streak to four matches last week with sweeps against Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount.\n\n• Megan Jacobsen registered a team-high 11 kills to lead the Toreros past the Waves on Thursday night in a match televised nationally on ESPNU. Jacobsen played a major role in that effort, hitting .688 on the night and racking up 11 kills – just two shy of her career high.\n\n• Cami May hit double-digits in kills for the second consecutive match, contributing 10 on the night. Roxie Wiblin and Katie Lukes had eight kills apiece on the night and hit .412 and .467, respectively.\n\n• Addie Picha and Wiblin paced the Toreros at the net, recording three blocks apiece. Picha broke the 100-mark with her first denial of the match and now has 102 blocks on the season.\n\n• Kelli Barry and Annie Benbow chipped in double-digit digs with 13 and 10, respectively.\n\n• Cami May registered a season-high 12 kills to lead USD past LMU.\n\n• Katie Lukes joined May with 12 kills to lead a strong offensive effort in which USD (11-9, 8-2 WCC) hit .344 on the day. Addie Picha and Roxie Wiblin contributed seven kills apiece.\n\n• USD limited the Lions to a .173 hitting percentage behind seven blocks by Picha and three apiece by May and Hannah Patrick. Roxie Wiblin and Kelli Barry led the team with eight digs apiece.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST GONZAGA\n\n• USD is 52-9 all-time against the Bulldogs and will enter Thursday's contest on a 46-match winning streak. The Toreros have not dropped a match against Gonzaga since Sept. 30, 1994. USD has won 15 consecutive sets against the Bulldogs.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST PORTLAND\n\n• The Toreros are 54-9 all-time against Portland and have won each of the past three matches. USD had a 45-match unbeaten streak against the Pilots from Oct. 16, 1992-Oct. 15, 2015.\n\nLEADING THE ATTACK\n\n• Roxie Wiblin leads the team with 191 kills (2.69 per set). Lauren Fuller is second on the team with 165 kills (2.80 per set), followed by Addie Picha with 157 (2.21).\n\n• Anna Newsome and Laura Madill have shared the responsibility at setter and pace the team with 461 and 324 assists, respectively.\n\nPICHA AT THE NET\n\n• Addie Picha has been stellar defensively and leads the Toreros with 109 blocks (1.54 per set). Picha has accounted for 67.7 percent of USD's blocks this season.\n\nSTRONG FIRST IMPRESSIONS\n\n• The Toreros have gotten significant contributions from its freshman class this season. Kelli Barry has spent a majority of the time at libero and leads the team with 191 digs. Katie Lukes, Laura Madill and Annie Benbow have also contributed significant time in the lineup.\n\nON THE DEFENSIVE SIDE\n\n• Freshman Kelli Barry has played well at libero and leads the team with 191 digs (3.13 per set). Roxie Wiblin is second on the team with 137 digs (1.93 per set).\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#12 Lauren Fuller\n\nOH\n\n6' 3\"\n\nSenior\n\n#9 Megan Jacobsen\n\nMB\n\n6' 2\"\n\nJunior\n\n#1 Anna Newsome\n\nS\n\n5' 9\"\n\nJunior\n\n#7 Hannah Patrick\n\nOPP\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#4 Addie Picha\n\nMB\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSenior\n\n#8 Roxie Wiblin\n\nOH\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#18 Katie Lukes\n\nOH\n\n6' 2\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#5 Annie Benbow\n\nL\n\n5' 3\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#2 Kelli Barry\n\nL/DS\n\n5' 5\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#6 Laura Madill\n\nS\n\n5' 11\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#10 Cami May\n\nOPP\n\n6' 2\"\n\nSophomore"
