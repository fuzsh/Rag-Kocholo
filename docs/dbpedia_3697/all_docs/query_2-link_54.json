        "text": "Can I be my own guarantor?\n\nA resident can act as their own guarantor if they can show documentation as outlined in the lease agreement that they have income greater than three times the rental installment.\n\nWhat paperwork is required with a guarantor?\n\nThe guarantor will need to sign the guaranty agreement. If the resident is not of legal age to execute a contract, the guarantor will be required to sign both the lease and guaranty agreement.\n\nWhen is a guarantor required?\n\nAll residents require a guarantor to complete the guaranty agreement.\n\nCan I setup recurring payments?\n\nYes! Save time in the future and never miss a rental installment by setting up recurring payments. You just need a few minutes and your checking account or card info to setup payments. Click here to login to the Resident Portal and get started.\n\nDo you send me a bill every month?\n\nNo, bills are not sent to residents each month, but you may see payment reminders posted around the property.\n\nHow can I make a payment?\n\nWe accept credit cards, debit cards and ACH payments online through our Resident Portal. We are unable to accept cash.\n\nWhat is an installment?\n\nThe typical lease term is approximately 11.5 months of occupancy which coincides with the university's academic calendar. The resident is charged a total rent amount for the contracted occupancy period. The lease agreement will reflect the total rent amount typically divided into 12 equal installments due August 1 - July 1. These installments do not represent a monthly rent amount and are not prorated.\n\nWhen are the installments due?\n\nInstallments are due on the 1st of every month per the payment schedule outlined in the lease agreement.\n\nAre there insurance requirements for signing a lease at the community?\n\nYes! The community requires all residents to obtain minimum coverage of $100,000 in Legal Liability to Landlord (LLL) insurance. There are multiple options to satisfy this lease requirement:\n\nOption 1: Residents can purchase the policy of their choosing so long as it satisfies the minimum insurance requirements above as further described in the Required Insurance Addendum made a part of the lease. Residents must submit proof of acceptable insurance to American Campus Communities via LeaseTrack at leasetrack.ai/acc or ACC@LeaseTrack.AI.\n\nOption 2: If you do not provide proof of insurance with the requisite coverage, American Campus Communities may satisfy the insurance requirement for you by placing coverage for your unit under a LLL policy as described in the Required Insurance Addendum found in your lease. You will be charged a monthly for premium, taxes and an administrative fee for, among other things, the expense of processing monthly payments and administering the program.\n\nAm I allowed to request a specific unit?\n\nYou can list your preferences on your housing application, and we will do our best to place you in the unit that fits those requests. All requests are served on a first-come, first-served basis and are taken in order based on the date your lease was received.\n\nCan I request specific roommates?\n\nYes! You can search for and match with specific roommates in the RoomSync app. Change your mind? No problem! You can modify your matches if your preferences change up until the matching period close date.\n\nDo you have a roommate matching service?\n\nYes! Our roommate matching program is powered by RoomSyncâ€“a roommate matching app. You will have the opportunity to create a personal profile, search, filter, chat and match with other residents who will be living in the community. You decide what matters most when narrowing down your search. Want a roommate with the same major? You got it! Prefer to live with someone who goes to bed early? No problem! Looking for a roommate who enjoys college football? No sweat! You control your search and matching criteria to find the perfect roommate."
