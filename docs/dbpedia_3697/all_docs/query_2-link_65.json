His work ranges from major monographs and exhibitions devoted to the eighteenth-century artists William Hogarth and Joshua Reynolds, to publications on the contemporary artists George Shaw and Frank Auerbach. He also co-edited and contributed to the major online publication, The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition: A Chronicle, 1769–2018. More recently, he has been making films about different aspects of British art, and is in the process of completing a film project focusing on The Procession, a celebrated installation by the artist Hew Locke.\n\nHallett, who grew up in mid-Wales, attended his local secondary School in Tregaron, Cardiganshire. He took his undergraduate degree at Pembroke College, Cambridge, and studied for a master’s degree and a PhD at The Courtauld. He was an Andrew W. Mellon Fellow at Yale University in 1990–91.
