        "text": "“A Voyage with Mary Roach,” held in the HUB-Robeson Auditorium at Penn State, was the much anticipated culminating event of the 2014 Centre County Reads/CALS Community Read slate of programming.\n\nOn April 15, over 250 people from the university and the larger Centre County community braved an unexpected snowfall to hear author Mary Roach speak about her adventures researching Packing for Mars.\n\nThe night began by announcing the winners of this year’s writing contest, “Writing the (Un)Known.” Then, moderator Katie O’Toole and Roach took the stage. O’Toole, an instructor in Penn State’s College of Communications, has worked for 24 years at Penn State Public Broadcasting as a producer, writer, and on-air host. Roach, dubbed “America’s funniest science writer” by the Washington Post, is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal, Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void; Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers; Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex; and Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. Packing for Mars is a New York Times Editor’s Choice.\n\nO’Toole and Roach regaled the audience with their lively dialogue, which roved freely across both disciplinary and personal boundaries. Highlights include the many moments of laughter, such as when Roach recounted asking her husband to join her in an MRI machine in the name of research for Bonk, as well as her explanation of how astronauts need to be re-toilet-trained due to the effects of low gravity on the bladder’s stretch receptors. The audience was also treated to the intricacies of Roach’s writing and research process, which she laughingly described as “chaotic” due to her limitless sense of curiosity. “I have no boundaries” Roach deadpanned, “there’s no ‘too much’ for me.”\n\nThe last segment of the night was devoted to audience questions. While Roach wouldn’t disclose the topic of her next book project, she did confide that she had spent her time in State College shadowing and talking to Penn State scientists and researchers. The audience also learned that Roach traces her journalism roots to a childhood admiration for the titular character of The Mary Tyler Moore Show and a stint as a publicist at the San Francisco Zoo.Finally, when asked to transmit a message of encouragement to the Penn State Lunar Lion team, Roach raised a first in the air and shouted, “GOGOGOGOGOGO!”\n\nRoach’s passion for her work—at one point, she described herself as “easily amazed and awed”—was infectious. The crowd’s palpable enthusiasm during the event evidenced the success of this year’s Centre County Reads/CALS Community Read selection of Packing for Mars in cultivating the shared sense of wonder unique to community literature.\n\nAbove: Mary Roach and Katie O’Toole trade stories about their rides in NASA’s infamous “Vomit Comet,” the reduced gravity aircraft simulator used for training astronauts.\n\nThroughout the spring term, 2008, Penn State’s Center for American Literary Studies, in partnership with the Penn State University Libraries\n\nand the Penn State Institute for the Arts and Humanities, sponsored a Community Read of Ernest Hemingway’s powerful 1929 novel, A Farewell to Arms. The Community Read featured a number of Hemingway-related lectures and discussions of the book that took place throughout March and April of 2008.\n\nThe book was chosen by Penn State Professor of English Sandra Spanier, General Editor of the Hemingway Letters Project, Cambridge University Press.\n\nCommunity Read Undergraduate Essay Competition–Spring 2008\n\nAs a part of the Community Read, a prize of $500 was awarded to the best analytical, interpretive essay about any aspect of Ernest Hemingway’s novel A Farewell to Arms. Essays will be judged on originality, eloquence, and acuity.\n\nCommunity Read 2008 Calendar of Events\n\nWednesday, March 5, 7:30pm, Boardroom of the Nittany Lion Inn\n\nProfessor James Nagel, “The Biographical Context of Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms”\n\nDr. James Nagel is the Eidson Distinguished Professor of American Literature at the University of Georgia and has written more than twenty books on topics in American literature. He is the author ofHemingway in Love and War (which was made into a Hollywood film directed by Lord Richard Attenborough, starring Sandra Bullock and Chris O’Donnell). Professor Nagel will discuss the discoveries he has made while investigating Hemingway’s First World War experiences and reflect on the ways in which Hemingway fashioned his life into the stuff of his novel, A Farewell to Arms. He will also reflect on his own experiences in taking Hemingway’s life to Hollywood.\n\nThursday, March 6, 4:30pm, Foster Auditorium\n\nAuthor Tobias Wolff, “Still With Us: No Farewell to Hemingway”\n\nPenn State University Libraries, Charles W. Mann Jr. Lecture in the Book Arts\n\nWorld-renowned author Tobias Wolff is a master of the short story and the memoir. He has written four acclaimed books of stories, including In the Garden of the North American Martyrs (1981), Back in the World(1985), The Stories of Tobias Wolff (1988), and The Night in Question(1996), and three of his individual stories have received the prestigious O. Henry Award. His memoir This Boys’ Life (1989), which tells the story of his difficult adolescence in the Pacific North West, was made into a major motion picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Ellen Barkin. His brilliant follow up, In Pharaoh’s Army: Memories of the Lost War (1994), constitutes a memoir of his tour of duty in Vietnam. His recent novel, Old School (2003), his first foray in that genre, focuses on the character of a young writer eager to meet and impress his literary idol, Ernest Hemingway.\n\nCommunity Read Discussion Sessions\n\nTuesday, March 25, 7:30pm, 102 Kern Building\n\nFacilitated by Professor Deborah Clarke, Penn State Department of English, and Josephine Berry Weiss Early Career Professor in the Humanities and Assistant Professor of English and Comparative Literature Jonathan Eburne.\n\nTuesday, April 1, 7:30pm, 102 Kern Building\n\nFacilitated by Paterno Family Professor Michael Bérubé and Assistant Professor Emily Harrington, Penn State Department of English.\n\nTuesday, April 8, 7:30pm, 102 Kern Building\n\nFacilitated by Professor Robert Caserio and Assistant Professor Linda Selzer, Penn State Department of English.\n\nWednesday, April 16, 7:30pm, Foster Auditorium\n\nJonathan Bank, Artistic Director, Mint Theater , New York, New York\n\nBeginning in February of 2008, Mr. Bank’s Mint Theater will present Ernest Hemingway’s little-known play of the Spanish Civil War, The Fifth Column, a work written in 1937 which has not been produced for the stage since 1940. Mr. Bank will speak about the thwarted production history of the play and compare it to a play written by Hemingway’s wife of the 1940s, war correspondent and novelist Martha Gellhorn. Gellhorn’s play, Love Goes to Press: A Comedy in Three Acts, written shortly after their divorce, was a hit on the London stage in 1946 and a flop on Broadway. Both wartime plays present characters recognizable as Hemingway and Gellhorn. With the help of two students from the Penn State School of Theater who will act brief scenes from both works, Mr. Bank will bring the conversation between Hemingway and Gellhorn to life.\n\nThursday, April 17, 7:30pm, Foster Auditorium\n\nDr. Susan Beegel, “Hemingway’s Personal Farewell to Arms”\n\nSusan Beegel holds a PhD in English from Yale University and is Adjunct Associate Professor of English at the University of Idaho. For fifteen years, she has edited The Hemingway Review, a scholarly journal published by the Ernest Hemingway Foundation. Beegel is the author or editor of three books as well as more than fifty articles on Ernest Hemingway, other writers, and various aspects of American literature and history. Beegel’s talk will address how Hemingway altered autobiographical materials to create one of his most compelling fictions. Her lecture will explore the causes and nature of World War I, Hemingway’s service as an ambulance driver on the Italian front, his wounding, and his love affair with nurse Agnes von Kurowsky during his recuperation in a Milan hospital.\n\nReading Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms\n\nFriday, April 18, 7:30pm, Ballroom, Atherton Hotel\n\nCommunity Read Gala Roundtable\n\nFeaturing:\n\nProfessor Sandra Spanier, Penn State University\n\nSpanier is a leading scholar of the works of Ernest Hemingway and General Editor of the Hemingway Letters Project, which will result in the publication by Cambridge University Press of a 12-volume scholarly edition of the writer’s more than 6000 letters. The project is supported in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities and designated a We the People project, “a special recognition by the NEH for model projects that advance the study, teaching, and understanding of American history and culture.” In addition to her scholarly work, Spanier also has been active in international collaborative efforts to conserve Hemingway’s papers in Cuba and to restore his long-time home outside Havana, and she serves on the Board of the Finca Vigía Preservation Foundation. Spanier’s work on A Farewell to Arms has focused on the enigmatic and controversial character of Catherine Barkley. She will begin the Gala by offering her comments on Barkley’s role in A Farewell to Arms, considering the World War I context, Hemingway’s theories of composition, and what the unpublished manuscripts reveal.\n\nWith Invited Panelists:\n\nProfessor Debra Moddelmog, Ohio State University\n\nDebra Moddelmog is Professor of English and coordinator of the Sexuality Studies Program at The Ohio State University.
