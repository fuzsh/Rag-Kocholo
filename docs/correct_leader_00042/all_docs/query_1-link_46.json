        "text": "The California Center for Climate Change Education at West Los Angeles College, an initiative of the Los Angeles Community College District, was established by the California State Legislature through the passage of Assembly Bill 1913 which states the purposes of the Center:\n\nA. “Serve as a resource for community colleges on climate change education with the understanding that at its core, climate change is a global issue of equity and social justice;\n\nB. “Build a clear climate change pathway that leads to appropriate certificates, degrees, and employment opportunities;\n\nC. “Enhance partnerships with nonprofit organizations that encourage the development of student internships and work-based learning opportunities;\n\nD. “Explore and expand internships, pre-apprenticeships, apprenticeships, and other work-based learning opportunities in the equity, environmental justice, and green jobs sectors;\n\nE. “Partner with local and regional entities to support the workforce training needed in the greening of the energy grid and other industries;\n\nF. “Develop and sustain an annual urban climate change and sustainability conference.”\n\nThe Center will implement the goals as outlined by the Legislature through the development of important internal and external partnerships all committed to the premise of developing the leadership and advocacy necessary to confront climate change.\n\nIn addition to serving as the location of the Center, West Los Angeles College also has the only degree and certificate program in Climate Change Studies in any California community college. Additionally, woven into the College’s mission a statement on the institution’s commitment to environmental responsibility. As an indicator of the District’s commitment to sustainability and environmental issues, the Board of Trustees passed the “Clean Energy and Sustainability Resolution” to “eliminate the District’s carbon-energy use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to protect the vulnerable communities the District serves from the negative impacts of the climate change crisis.”"
