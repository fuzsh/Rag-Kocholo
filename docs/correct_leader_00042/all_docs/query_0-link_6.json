Shortly after the Second World War, both national industry and the government agreed on the merit of a new technical University, since at the time, only the University of Delft existed. That’s when Eindhoven was elected to build the second technical University. Dut after the opening in 1956 it quickly became apparent that the demand for engineers was not fully met by this University alone. Hence, competition arose between Enschede, Arnhem, Assen, Leeuwarden, Deventer and Zwolle for who would be eligible to situate the third technical University. Deventer and Enschede-hengelo came out as the best candidates, but thanks to passionate lobbying and the attractive building grounds of the Drienerlo estate, Enschede-hengelo was elected to be the best choice. \n\nThis choice was made definitive by minister of education Jo Cals with the following words: “The persuasive force by which was pleaded for the settlement of a technical University on Drienerlo, as well as the willingness of its sacrifice, that has been shown by industrial and other companies, makes the signed expect that, given the settlement of a technical University, powerful support can be expected by the authorities and communities in this area.”\n\nAnd that’s how we, as the University of Twente, owe a lot to both minister Jo Cals and all the sponsors of the (now) University Fund Twente for establishing our beautiful University. And minister Cals still has traces on the campus. We named the Calslaan in his honour, the entry of the Spiegel is known as the Calshall, and in this same hall you can fine a bust of Jo Cals.\n\n#utwente #alumniutwente #universityoftwente #utwentelife #tbt\".",
