        "text": "Dean's Message — Addressing FCS, Ag Teacher Shortages\n\nMackay Junior-Senior High School agriculture teacher Trent Van Leuven recalled having a world-renowned expert on speed dial when one of his classes encountered something puzzling while dissecting the reproductive tract of a dairy cow. Van Leuven, ’09, got the answers he sought by consulting his former University of Idaho animal sciences professor, Amin Ahmadzadeh. Van Leuven, who is the 2024 Idaho Teacher of the Year, attributes much of the success he’s enjoyed in the classroom to the broad agriscience education he received while enrolled in U of I’s Department of Agricultural Education, Leadership and Communications (AELC), as well as the continued support of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS). CALS collaborates with the College of Education, Health and Human Sciences (CEHHS) to address teacher shortages in two growing fields — agriculture and family and consumer sciences (FCS). Graduates of both programs emerge with a broad knowledge of their disciplines, uniquely preparing them to enter rural Idaho school districts as “utility players” equipped to tackle a variety of classes. Van Leuven, for example, must teach eight different ag-related subjects per semester — such as fish and wildlife, welding and agricultural economics.\n\nCALS runs the only state-approved teacher licensure program in agricultural education, and 93 of Idaho’s 172 working agriculture teachers received either a bachelor’s or master’s degree from U of I. AELC recently added two new faculty members, and its student enrollment is growing steadily. Nine AELC students are currently completing their student teaching in agricultural classrooms throughout the West. Kattlyn Wolf, AELC interim department chair, anticipates the department will graduate 12 students in 2025, about 15 students in 2026 and about 20 students in 2027. AELC students take a host of courses across CALS, preparing them with a general understanding of a breadth of agricultural disciplines. Prior to graduating, AELC students are paired in classrooms with trusted past graduates, where the student teachers are observed by AELC faculty. Aspiring agriculture teacher Hannah Davis, for example, is now student teaching in Nez Perce. Davis has been assigned to teach greenhouse courses and feels well prepared thanks to the CALS courses she was required to take. “U of I does a good job of setting a foundation for people. They create teachers whose knowledge of agriculture is an inch deep but a mile wide,” Davis said. “If an agriculture teacher is at one school and moves to another one and they really want you to teach horticulture, I think it’s better to be exposed to those things so they don’t catch you off guard.”\n\nAELC prepares agriculture teachers to follow a model with three overlapping components — classroom instruction, a student organization (FFA), and a supervised agricultural experience involving hands-on, real-world experiential learning activities. The economic impact of Idaho high school students’ supervised agricultural experience projects, such as completing a livestock project for a county fair, was estimated at more than $20 million in the past school year. Furthermore, about 1,000 FFA members visit the U of I Moscow campus each June to participate in the annual Idaho State FFA Career Development Events, and AELC employs the state’s FFA Association executive director, Clara-Leigh Evans. The result of combining these three circles has been graduates who are well prepared for the rigors of a demanding job and go on to have far greater career longevity than U.S. teachers in general.\n\nThe Margaret Ritchie School of Family and Consumer Sciences offers a similar teaching program — equipping aspiring FCS teachers with a broad knowledge base through a diversity of classes taught by the school’s experts. Aspiring FCS teachers may either earn a 30-credit teaching certification with an FCS emphasis or participate in a 60-credit FCS bachelor’s program that can be paired with teaching curriculum and a student-teaching experience through CEHHS. In 2025, the school also plans to expand upon its summer FCS “base camps,” which will provide continuing education opportunities for FCS teachers across every content area. The FCS teaching program is overseen by Professor Sonya Meyer and Trevor White, an academic advisor and peer liaison within the school. “That bachelor’s in family and consumer sciences is a great general degree that opens so many doors,” Meyer said. “We are the ones who teach life skills.”\n\nThese teaching programs require students to put in hard work across many areas of study. They’re certainly not for anyone looking for a shortcut. We happen to think that’s a good thing, given the importance of the work they do in preparing the next generation of community leaders, as well as the stability and versatility well-prepared agricultural and FCS teachers afford to their school districts. Our results speak for themselves.\n\nMichael P. Parrella\n\nDean\n\nCollege of Agricultural and Life Sciences\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nCALS has 14,000 acres of land for research and teaching and operates 9 research and extension centers across Idaho. CALS faculty conduct 35% of the sponsored research at U of I and brought in $91.6 million in funds toward sponsored research in 2023. CALS employs more than 200 individuals with a research appointment. Limagrain Cereal Seeds paid more than $489,000 in wheat variety royalties for using varieties developed by the CALS wheat breeding program.\n\nOur Stories\n\nNew IAMP Program Manager\n\nAs an avid home gardener who also tends to a residential fruit orchard and a few goats, Berkley Ridenhour raises much of her own food and is always trying new ways to improve her production efficiency.\n\nRidenhour will soon dramatically scale up her pursuits in sustainable agriculture as the new program manager with the University of Idaho-led Innovative Agriculture and Marketing Partnership (IAMP), formerly known as Climate Smart Commodities for Idaho.\n\nIAMP is funded with a five-year, $55 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), representing the largest single grant in the university’s history. It will seek to build markets and increase adoption of climate-smart production practices on more than 200 farms throughout the state. U of I and its funded partners — including the Idaho Association of Soil Conservation Districts, the Nez Perce and Coeur d’Alene Tribes, The Nature Conservancy Agricultural Program in Idaho, Desert Mountain Grassfed Beef and Arrowleaf Consulting — hope to roll out the program this spring. Producers who wish to receive notification when the application period opens should email iamp@uidaho.edu.\n\nIAMP has a goal of preventing 31,000 to 70,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents from entering the atmosphere annually while offsetting emissions equivalent to the annual consumption of 6 million gallons of gasoline. The program offers producers of major Idaho commodities including barley, beef, chickpeas, hops, potatoes, sugar beets and wheat annual payments of $38 to $74 per acre for enacting designated sustainable agricultural practices, allowing producers to stack practices to increase incentives.\n\nCovered practices will include cover cropping, cover cropping with livestock grazing, reduced or no-till, interseeding, precision fertilizer application and partial nitrogen fertilizer replacement with biochar, among others.\n\nRidenhour joined U of I on Nov. 16 and is based at the Moscow campus. Her duties include project management, administrative support, serving as a liaison with funded partners, assembling required quarterly reports for USDA, planning meetings and aiding in budget monitoring, among other responsibilities. Many details of the IAMP program are still being finalized.\n\nRidenhour appreciates that her job will give her the chance to do on-the-ground environmental work while providing direct support to farmers.\n\n“It supports producers in trying new practices. It helps take out a little bit of the risk in trying something new that might be more climate smart,” Ridenhour said. “It can be hard to take that risk when it’s entirely your own investment and you’re not sure how it’s going to turn out. Hopefully the incentives are such that they alleviate some of that uncertainty or help farmers to try new practices more.”\n\nRidenhour holds a bachelor’s degree in English literature from Utah State University. She has relevant experience having worked for The Nature Conservancy for more than 12 years. Her first position with the nonprofit was as a conservation coordinator supporting a team involved in combating aquatic species in the Great Lakes. From 2018 until recently, she worked for The Nature Conservancy’s Canada Program, participating in Indigenous-led conservation projects, as well as Natural Climate Solutions projects with an emphasis on agriculture. In that capacity, she helped implement several large grants.\n\nUnlike other programs that pay producers for trying sustainable agricultural practices, IAMP also entails sophisticated monitoring to gauge the environmental benefits of various practices in Idaho’s climate, conditions and soils. Furthermore, one of the funded partners, Arrowleaf Consulting, will aid in efforts to identify and develop markets and supply chains to fetch a premium for sustainably raised commodities.\n\nSanford Eigenbrode, a university distinguished professor of entomology, and Erin Brooks, a professor of agricultural engineering, co-lead IAMP. Extension staff have been attending agricultural conferences and other events for producers to raise awareness about the grant and say interest is strong.\n\nIAMP is funded by USDA’s Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities Program, award No. NR233A750004G038."
