        "text": "2023-24 Academic Year\n\nWith the beginning of the fall semester, more than 400 faculty, staff, and students volunteered to participate in the AI Working Group.\n\nBased on feedback provided by the campus community, the group restructured into four main focus areas with co-leads: Education, Industry, Research, and Society.\n\nThe group will periodically review these areas to determine if new themes should be added as the AI landscape continues to evolve.\n\nSummer 2023\n\nThe summer 2023 AI Working Group—comprised of more than 60 University faculty, staff and students—organized into seven teams, each tasked with examining different aspects of AI on campus: access and equity, communication, data acumen, ethical considerations, industry and workforce, integrity in education, syllabus guidance, and training needs.\n\nMay 2023\n\nIn response, the Office of the Provost; Research, Innovation and Impact, and Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight, with support from the Faulty Senate, surveyed faculty, formed a steering committee, and assembled a team of faculty, staff, and students to facilitate a campus-wide conversation around these discussions.\n\nWhen considering the integration of new technologies, two issues are of particular interest in the context of higher education:\n\naccess equity (ensuring equality of access to emerging information tools)\n\nacademic integrity (understanding how these tools can be used with high integrity across instruction and scholarship)\n\nWhy the urgency? These AI technologies are tools like electronic calculators, smartphones, and information search tools that will be integrated into higher education in due time. What’s different, though, is the scope and speed. The range and rate at which these technologies are being introduced will continue to increase, leaving little time to understand the impact of one technology before the next technology needs to be considered.\n\nSpring Semester 2023\n\nThe rapid emergence of novel information technologies like ChatGPT, BING, DALL·E, and Perplexity has the potential to reshape higher education from the classroom to the laboratory.\n\nThese tools swept across academia, including the University of Arizona, sparking many conversations across campus about AI's benefits, opportunities, challenges, and ethical implications in higher education."
