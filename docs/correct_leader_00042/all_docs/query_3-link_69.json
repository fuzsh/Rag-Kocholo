Mash your banana, then mix this with the oats, protein powder, baking powder, blueberries and lemon curd.\n2. Give this a good stir and make sure everything is combined before stirring in the milk.\n3. Add some spray oil or greaseproof paper to an ovenproof baking dish or cake tin, and then pour in the oat mixture to the tin. Making sure it’s evenly spread out.\n4. sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mix, and then pop in the oven for 20-25 minutes at 180.\n5. Once this is cooked, cut into six even squares.\nThis can be eaten hot or cold, I like to warm mine up and serve with a dollop of yoghurt.\n\nif you’re on a weight loss journey this is a quick and simple breakfast cooked in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. That will be ready for you for breakfast for six days. All we have to do is grab it out of the fridge out of a little little bit of yoghurt and you’re done. There is no excuse that you can’t have a yummy breakfast in the morning, especially if you’re busy with the kids.\n\n#macro #fitness#food#bunbury #nutritioncoach\".",
