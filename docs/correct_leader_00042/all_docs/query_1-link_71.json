        "text": "“You can’t be busy and frenetic and bouncing off the walls with 100 projects if you’re obsessed about doing something really well.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\nCal Newport is a professor of computer science at Georgetown University, where he is also a founding member of the Center for Digital Ethics. In addition to his academic work, Newport is a New York Times bestselling author who writes for a general audience about the intersection of technology, productivity, and culture. His books have sold millions of copies and been translated into over forty languages. He is also a contributor to The New Yorker and hosts the popular Deep Questions podcast.\n\nHis new book isSlow Productivity: The Lost Art of Accomplishment Without Burnout.\n\nPlease enjoy!\n\nListen to the episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Overcast, Podcast Addict, Pocket Casts, Castbox, Google Podcasts, Amazon Music, or on your favorite podcast platform.Watch the interview on YouTube here.\n\nBrought to you by AG1 all-in-one nutritional supplement, Eight Sleep’s Pod Cover sleeping solution for dynamic cooling and heating, and Momentous high-quality supplements.\n\nThe transcript of this episode can be found here. Transcripts of all episodes can be found here.\n\n#722: Cal Newport — How to Embrace Slow Productivity, Build a Deep Life, Achieve Mastery, and Defend Your Time\n\nThis episode is brought to you by AG1! I get asked all the time, “If you could use only one supplement, what would it be?” My answer is usually AG1, my all-in-one nutritional insurance. I recommended it in The 4-Hour Body in 2010 and did not get paid to do so. I do my best with nutrient-dense meals, of course, but AG1 further covers my bases with vitamins, minerals, and whole-food-sourced micronutrients that support gut health and the immune system.\n\nRight now, you’ll get a 1-year supply of Vitamin D free with your first subscription purchase—a vital nutrient for a strong immune system and strong bones. Visit DrinkAG1.com/Tim to claim this special offer today and receive your 1-year supply of Vitamin D (and 5 free AG1 travel packs) with your first subscription purchase! That’s up to a one-year supply of Vitamin D as added value when you try their delicious and comprehensive daily, foundational nutrition supplement that supports whole-body health.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Momentous high-quality supplements! Momentous offers high-quality supplements and products across a broad spectrum of categories, and I’ve been testing their products for months now. I’ve been using their magnesium threonate, apigenin, and L-theanine daily, all of which have helped me improve the onset, quality, and duration of my sleep. I’ve also been using Momentous creatine, and while it certainly helps physical performance, including poundage or wattage in sports, I use it primarily for mental performance (short-term memory, etc.).\n\nTheir products are third-party tested (Informed-Sport and/or NSF certified), so you can trust that what is on the label is in the bottle and nothing else. If you want to try Momentous for yourself, you can use code Tim for 20% off your one-time purchase at LiveMomentous.com/Tim. And not to worry, my non-US friends, Momentous ships internationally and has you covered.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by Eight Sleep! Temperature is one of the main causes of poor sleep, and heat is my personal nemesis. I’ve suffered for decades, tossing and turning, throwing blankets off, pulling them back on, and repeating ad nauseam. But a few years ago, I started using the Pod Cover, and it has transformed my sleep. Eight Sleep has launched their newest generation of the Pod: Pod 4 Ultra. I’m excited to test it out. It cools, it heats, and now it elevates, automatically. With the best temperature performance to date, Pod 4 Ultra ensures you and your partner stay cool, even in a heatwave. Plus, it automatically tracks your sleep time, snoring, sleep stages, and HRV, all with high precision. For example, their heart rate tracking is at an incredible 99% accuracy.\n\nPod 4 Ultra also introduces an adjustable Base that fits between your mattress and your bed frame to add custom positions for the best sleeping experience. Plus, it automatically reduces your snoring when detected. Just add it easily onto any bed.\n\nAnd now, listeners of The Tim Ferriss Show can get $350 off of the Pod 4 Ultra for a limited time!

And I think that’s frustrating for a lot of the internet generation because it takes a really long time.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\n“There was no hustle culture. That’s the interesting thing. When you go back and study people producing things of real value, using their brain, they were smart and they were dedicated and they worked really hard, but they didn’t hustle and they didn’t work 10-hour days day after day. They didn’t work all-out, year-round. They didn’t push, push, push until this thing was done. It was a more natural variation. They had less on their plate at the same time, and they glued it all together by obsessing over quality.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\n“There’s nothing more quixotic than the overburdened worker who is trying to not say no, but get the person who’s giving them the work to voluntarily agree to not give them the work. It never works. If someone’s trying to get you to do something, and you’re like, ‘Well, I guess I could, but I am pretty busy,’ they’re never going to say, ‘You sound busy. Don’t do this.’ They’re like, ‘Yeah? Good. Well, I’m glad you can do it. Here you go. Get this off my plate.'”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\n“Slow productivity produces good stuff. It doesn’t just make the workers happier. It doesn’t just make you happier. You produce better stuff. I mean, your company has more profit. Your clients are happier. You can charge more for the services you offer, so it’s not zero sum. It’s more win-win than anything else.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\n“Busyness doesn’t produce high value.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\n“Don’t try to convince people of new things. Explain to them what they already know in a way that lets them take better action.”\n\n— Cal Newport\n\nPEOPLE MENTIONED\n\nWalter Isaacson\n\nJoe Rogan\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nLex Fridman\n\nRyan Holiday\n\nAndrew Huberman\n\nJordan Peterson\n\nCharlie Rose\n\nKevin Kelly\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nMrBeast\n\nEzra Klein\n\nPeter Thiel\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nSteve Martin\n\nSeth Godin\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis\n\nChristopher Nolan\n\nRamit Sethi\n\nWarren Buffett\n\nKevin Rose\n\nStatler and Waldorf\n\nSebastian Mallaby\n\nMichael Lewis\n\nDave Barry\n\nJoe Abercrombie\n\nIsaac Newton\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda\n\nGeorgia O’Keeffe\n\nAlfred Stieglitz\n\nMarie Curie\n\nSisyphus\n\nDon Draper\n\nMartha Stewart\n\nMark Rober\n\nDerek Sivers\n\nJane Austen\n\nLeonardo da Vinci\n\nQuentin Tarantino\n\nGreta Gerwig\n\nJohn Grisham\n\nMichael Crichton\n\nLinda Stone\n\nFrederick Winslow Taylor\n\nPeter Drucker\n\nD.T.
