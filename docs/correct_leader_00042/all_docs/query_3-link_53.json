        "text": "Wendyliz Martinez has been awarded an American Dissertation Fellowship from the American Association of University Women (AAUW). The fellowship, which provides significant financial support in the final year of dissertation-writing, recognizes woman scholars whose work is of the highest academic excellence and who are committed to serving women and girls in their personal or professional communities.\n\nCongratulations, Wendyliz, on this major recognition of you and your work!\n\nCarmin Wong has co-authored, with a collective of fellow scholars, educators, and artists, the Furious Flower Syllabus. This open-access syllabus, sponsored by James Madison University's Furious Flower Poetry Center, is designed for students at all levels and contains a series of lesson plans to introduce readers to the world of Black poetry. As she notes in an interview with Furious Flower, the purpose of the syllabus is \"building a community—a network, a space—for Black poetry to continue to not only exist but to be celebrated.\" The syllabus was awarded a 2025 Divergent Award by the Initiative for Literacy in the Digital Age, which recognizes innovative approaches to promoting literacy that extend beyond the classroom and are responsive to an increasingly digital world.\n\nWong is also a contributing author to The Playwright's Toolbox, a reference book featuring advice for (and by) emerging and established playwrights.\n\nA profile of Wong and her far-reaching, innovative work can be found in the PennStater alumni magazine here.\n\nCongratulations, Carmin, on these exciting projects and recognitions of your work!\n\nCourtney Murray appeared as a guest on the most recent episode of C19 Podcast, produced by C19: The Society of Nineteenth Century Americanists. She currently serves as leader and editor of the G19 Collective, C19's graduate student collective.\n\nIn this episode of C19 Podcast, Murray previews the 2024 C19 conference with fellow C19 members, focusing particularly on the meaning and importance of this year's conference theme, \"The End.\" \"I want to hone in on ends being beginnings,\" says Murray, who sees parallels between her experience as \"a graduate student coming to the end of my graduate career\" and ongoing \"conversations about the end of the humanities.\" The question remains, in Murray's words, \"What needs to end so we can move forward and begin?\"\n\nCongratulations, Courtney, on this opportunity to represent G19 and the important contributions and concerns of emerging nineteenth-century Americanist scholars!\n\nCourtney Murray has recently been awarded several internal and external fellowships to support the completion of her dissertation. These include the American Antiquarian Society's Jay and Deborah Last fellowship, which supports research projects that draw heavily on visual materials; as a short-term visiting academic fellow, she will conduct research on African American print coverage of slave voyages and ships. She has also received a second short-term award—the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Fellowship—from the Library Company of Philadelphia and the Historical Society of Pennsylvania.\n\nAdditionally, Murray has been named a 2024-2025 center and institutes fellow with Penn State's George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center. She has also been named one of only four residents to Penn State's Humanities Institute for Summer 2024.\n\nCongratulations, Courtney, on all of these fantastic accomplishments!\n\nPheolyn Hayes and Courtney Murray have been named 2023 Junior Fellows with the Library of Congress. Junior Fellows work with the Library's extensive special collections, bringing awareness to parts of the archive that have historically been underrepresented or marginalized.\n\nHayes will work with the Library's Archive of Public Broadcasting Online Exhibit Curation program, where he will curate a new exhibit on public broadcasting's coverage of the histories and cultures of Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and/or communities of color over the past 70 years as part of ongoing efforts to recover, digitally preserve, and make accessible public broadcasting programming.\n\nMurray will work on the Library's Researching the 19th and Early 20th Century Black Press project, performing research and writing essays to increase discoverability of African-American newspaper titles as part of a major initiative to digitize a collection of miscellaneous 19th- and early 20th-century newspapers from the Black American press while expanding collection access and providing context for many individual newspaper titles.\n\nCongratulations, Pheolyn and Courtney, on being awarded these exciting fellowships!\n\nRobert Nguyen and Gabriel Lorenzo Aguilar have been awarded the Raymond E. and Roberta Lombra Outstanding Graduate Research Award from the College of the Liberal Arts at Penn State. This award acknowledges \"high-quality contributions\" by graduate students in the humanities and social sciences whose work has been published in peer-reviewed journals or books. Rob was recognized for his article \"Middle-out from Bottom-up: Engineering and Close Reading Code in HBO’s Silicon Valley,\" recently published in Configurations. Gabe was recognized for his article \"World-Traveling to Redesign a Map for Migrant Women: Humanitarian Technical Communication in Praxis,\" recently published in Technical Communication. Congratulations, Rob and Gabe, on this great achievement!\n\nMiriam Gonzales, a past CAL Graduate research assistant, has accepted the position of Associate Director of will (a nationally recognized gender and social justice program) and affiliate faculty in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (WGSS) at the University of Richmond. In her administrative role, Miriam will mentor and advise student leaders and supervise will's internship program; in her faculty role, she will help expand WGSS course offerings to include queer studies and environmental humanities, among other areas. As a founding co-coordinator of Penn State's English Grad Futures initiative, Miriam has helped prepare graduate students for diverse career opportunities just like this one—congratulations, Miriam, on your own job market success!\n\nThe Penn State Digital English Studio, which develops and offers resources for using technology in teaching and scholarship, has been awarded the Janice M. Lauer Institutional Achievement Award in Rhetoric and Composition Doctoral Studies by the Consortium of Doctoral Programs in Rhetoric and Composition. This award recognizes \"institutional innovations with broad impact [that are] replicable, sustainable, [and] inspirational.\"\n\nCongratulations to the entire team of faculty, graduate research assistants, and staff at the Digital English Studio—Stuart Selber, Dan Tripp, Leslie Mateer, Rachel Wiley, Joe Bueter, Su Young Lee, Sierra Parker, Evvy Blatstein, Aidan Fletcher, and Lynn Setzler—for this acknowledgment of your important, innovative work!\n\nRobert Volpicelli, a PSU Alumnus and CALS Dissertation Fellow -- who now serves as Assistant Professor of English at Randolph-Macon College (VA) -- recently published his first book, Transatlantic Modernism and the US Lecture Tour, with Oxford University Press. Deriving from his dissertation project, Transatlantic Modernism is the first comprehensive study of modernist authors on the US lecture tour, a widespread phenomenon that accounted for many Americans' first encounter with international modernism. Attending to these encounters, the volume reroutes our understanding of modernism away from the magazines and other mass media that have so far characterized its circulation and toward the unique form of cultural distribution that coalesced around the tour. Congratulations, Robert!\n\nNathaniel Windon, a former CALS Dissertation Fellow, has accepted a tenure-track position beginning in Fall 2022 at Xavier University, where he will serve as Assistant Professor of English (specializing in pre-1900 American literature). Nate earned his PhD in 2018 under the direction of Christopher Castiglia. In addition to serving as a CALS Dissertation Fellow, Nate was also awarded a CALS Graduate Research/Training Award to support research for his dissertation, now his first book project, entitled Superannuation: The Making of Old Age in Nineteenth-Century America. Congratulations to Nate, and to Christopher, for this job-market success!\n\nCarmin, along with higher education graduate student Gabriel Pulido, was also awarded multiple university sponsorships to support her and Gabriel's digital interdisciplinary archival project, TRACING: Black Women's Poetry from 1895 to the Present. This project invites contemporary Black women poets to engage with and (re)interpret the writings of late 19th- and early 20th-century Black women poets to illuminate the voices of Black women writers often underrepresented or overshadowed in history. By upholding the lives, legacies, and interiority of these Black women poets, TRACING positions oral poetry within literary studies and gives space to Black women whose intellectual and artistic contributions and/or personal identities have not historically been recognized in academic discourse. Congratulations, Carmin and Gabriel!\n\nLiana Glew, former CALS Dissertation Fellow and CALS Graduate Research Assistant, has accepted the role of Prison Education Program Manager with the Penn State College of Education's Restorative Justice Initiative. The RJI eliminates barriers to educational access and civic engagement for those who are currently and formerly incarcerated; since its founding in 2015, the initiative has worked with and provided resources to over 200 incarcerated individuals. In her new role, Liana will work to recruit and train additional instructors as part of the RJI's Higher Education in Prison program. Congratulations, Liana, on your job-market success—an important reminder of the range of meaningful, impactful work one can do with an English doctorate!\n\nJason Maxwell, 2013 CALS Summer Dissertation Fellow, has a new book, The Two Cultures of English: Literature, Composition, and the Moment of Rhetoric, out now from Fordham University Press. Jason will also transition onto the tenure track beginning fall 2019, serving as Assistant Professor of English at the University at Buffalo. Jason credits his time spent as a CALS Fellow as an important moment in his professional maturation at Penn State: \"The CALS award gave me the space and time to develop the material in my dissertation in a way that wouldn't have otherwise been possible. The award supported me at a crucial moment in my professional development as a scholar, and its effects can still be felt many years later.\"\n\nMichael New, recipient of a CALS Graduate Award for a Research or Training Seminar, recently completed his dissertation on jazz and African American poetry under the direction of Aldon Neilsen. Dr. New was a lecturer in English and American Studies at Keene University, but in fall 2016, he began a tenure-track assistant professorship at St. Anselm College in Manchester, NH, where he will teach in the areas of African American literature, poetry, and cultural studies."
