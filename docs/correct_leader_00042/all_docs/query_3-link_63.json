To help support our reporting work, and to continue our ability to provide this content for free to our readers, we receive compensation from the companies that advertise on the Forbes Health site. This compensation comes from two main sources. First, we provide paid placements to advertisers to present their offers. The compensation we receive for those placements affects how and where advertisers’ offers appear on the site. This site does not include all companies or products available within the market. Second, we also include links to advertisers’ offers in some of our articles; these “affiliate links” may generate income for our site when you click on them.\n\nThe compensation we receive from advertisers does not influence the recommendations or advice our editorial team provides in our articles or otherwise impact any of the editorial content on Forbes Health. While we work hard to provide accurate and up-to-date information that we think you will find relevant, Forbes Health does not and cannot guarantee that any information provided is complete and makes no representations or warranties in connection thereto, nor to the accuracy or applicability thereof.\n\nThe Forbes Health Calorie Calculator estimates the number of calories your body uses each day. If you want to lose weight, it calculates the number of daily calories you need to consume to achieve your weight loss goal. It also displays how long it will take you to reach your goal weight safely.\n\nCalculating Daily Calories To Maintain Weight\n\nTo calculate your daily calorie needs to maintain your weight, the calculator considers your:\n\nResting metabolic rate (RMR)\n\nPhysical activity\n\nThe thermogenic effect of food (the calories you burn while processing food)\n\nEach of these components requires a different amount of calories.\n\nEat Smarter With Noom\n\nPowered by technology, coaches and psychology, Noom teaches you tips and tricks to develop a positive relationship with food so you can enjoy the foods you love without guilt or shame.\n\nStart Your Free Trial\n\n1. Your RMR requires the most energy, far more than physical activity or food processing. It can be measured scientifically in a lab or estimated using an equation. In this calculator, your RMR is measured using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation. It’s the most reliable formula, according to a review of studies in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. It calculates your RMR based on your sex, weight, height and age.\n\n2. Physical activity burns calories, so athletes need to consume more calories than people who don’t exercise. An activity factor—ranging from 1.2 for people who are sedentary to 1.9 for extremely active people—is assigned based on your physical activity level. The calculator then multiplies your RMR by this number.\n\n3. The thermogenic effect of food makes up the remainder of your daily energy needs (approximately 10%). To find this number, the calculator takes your RMR multiplied by your activity factor and multiplies that number by 10%.\n\nCalculating Daily Calories To Lose Weight\n\nTo determine your daily calorie needs to lose weight, the calculator decreases the number of calories you use each day by 25%, resulting in a new recommended daily calorie intake. Our Forbes Health Calorie Calculator panel of experts recommended this equation for safe, sustainable weight loss.\n\nThe calculator won’t display fewer than 1,200 calories a day no matter your starting weight. “If you go below that, it’s very difficult to get all the macronutrients and micronutrients you need for optimal health,” says Melina Jampolis, M.D., a Forbes Health Advisory Board member.\n\nThe Forbes Health editorial team consulted Forbes Health Advisory Board members Melina Jampolis, M.D., Toby Amidor, R.D. and Sabrena Jo, M.S., the senior director of science and research at the American Council on Exercise (ACE), for this calculator. They reviewed the methods used by this tool to calculate daily calorie needs to maintain and lose weight.\n\nWhile calorie counting may not be for everyone, some people may find it has advantages. For one, the act of simply tracking your calorie intake can help you become more aware of your patterns and behaviors when it comes to food consumption. Becoming aware of the calories you’re eating daily is often the first step toward a behavioral change in the way you consume calories.\n\nCertain individuals may also find power in the act of counting numbers, rather than focusing solely on the type of food they’re eating.\n\nAnd arguably the biggest benefit to counting calories is possible weight loss, however, you should speak to a health professional when counting calories for weight loss as it can be difficult to sustain and is an often temporary solution.\n\nFor certain people, calorie counting may lead to some negative outcomes. First off, each person’s body is different. The amount of calories one burns can vary depending on factors including what we eat, our metabolism and the overall health of our gut.\n\nAdditionally, as a 2015 Open Heart journal article notes, a cycle of losing and regaining weight from fad diets or yo-yo dieting can be harmful to a person’s health and can lead to the development of health concerns like hypertension or insulin resistance . Shifting attention to food quality over quantity, explain the authors, is often a better way to reduce obesity and its related conditions\n\nAnother possible risk of counting calories is the potential for the development of an eating disorder such as anorexia, binge eating or bulimia nervosa. Recent research has also connected the use of calorie tracking apps with perpetuated behaviors or attitudes toward disordered eating."
