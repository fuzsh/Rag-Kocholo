This morning a public hearing on the action was held at the Capitol, attended by Dean Wintersteen and John Lawrence, acting vice president for extension and outreach. The Alliance for Iowa State message distributed last week contained several points the college provided to the President’s office on the value and relevance of the center. The college also distributed information and impact points on the center in alerts sent to several external groups, including a grassroots group of citizens who support legislative requests for the Agriculture Experiment Station, leaders of local ISU Research and Demonstration Farm associations and the college's young alumni group. Please remember that faculty and staff who feel strongly about this issue should follow university guidelines on political activities prepared by the University Counsel, especially related to one’s time and equipment.\n\nResearch\n\nUSDA Releases Video on CALS Poultry Research\n\nThe USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture’s Center for International Programs has released a video on CALS researchers collaborating with the University of Edinburgh to understand how chickens and turkeys respond to avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), a costly and infectious disease. “The long-term goal of our research is to reduce the negative impact of respiratory APEC on the poultry industry through the development of veterinary and breeding control strategies,” said Susan Lamont, animal science.
