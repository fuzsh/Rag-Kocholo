        "text": "Bio\n\nAmber Beseli is an Adjunct Assistant Professor in Agricultural and Human Sciences. Prior to joining the AHS department, Amber worked in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) as the Program Director of CALS Global Academy, a specialized office dedicated to designing custom technical and leadership trainings for international agricultural professionals. Through this role, Amber hosted 20 training programs with professionals from 21 different countries.\n\nAmber has a passion for introducing NC State students to the international side of agriculture. One way she accomplished this is through the two courses she has created and teaches: “Global Issues in Agriculture,” which is designed to introduce students to international agricultural issues and development projects; and “Trends and Culture of the Agricultural Workforce,” which is designed to to introduce students to cultural diversity, the value it adds to the agricultural workplace, and how to increase, improve, and support cultural diversity in the workplace. Amber also has a strong passion for study abroad. She developed and co-directed a new program titled “Germany and Czech Republic: Food, Energy, and Society” and co-directed a new program titled “Netherlands: Agricultural Innovations, Agritourism, & Agri-food Products.”\n\nAmber’s passion for agricultural education started to develop during her time in high school FFA and on the family farm in Western, NC. Her introduction to other cultures and international agriculture came from her experiences studying abroad at The Prague Institute, on CALS faculty-led programs, and on international horticultural field trips.\n\nPrograms and Initiatives\n\nGermany and Czech Republic: Food, Energy, and Society study abroad program\n\nNetherlands: Agricultural Innovations, Agritourism, & Agri-food Products study abroad program\n\nThe Agricultural Institute’s Agricultural Operations Management certificate program\n\nPrimary Teaching Responsibilities\n\nAGI 134: Trends and Culture of the Agricultural Workforce\n\nALS 495: Global Issues in Agriculture\n\nContributing Websites\n\nhttps://cals.ncsu.edu/international-programs/students/study-abroad/germany\n\nProfessional Honors/Offices/Recognitions\n\n2020: Manuscript research highlighted in the Crop Science Society of America’s News Magazine: Volume 65, Issue 5.
