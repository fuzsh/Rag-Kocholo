        "text": "Mia Bostic, Charlottesville, Virginia, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am taking a gap year to pursue world travel and work part-time as a manager for a local company.\n\nHow did your department influence you?\n\nMy department has absolutely defined my experience at Virginia Tech. The department prides itself on inclusivity and community. It thrives off of the relationship between students and professors. The classroom environment is full of discussion, jovial jokes, and thoughtful speculation about real-world problems. I have loved being a part of it.\n\nWhat hands-on experiences did you have as a student?\n\nHaving the opportunity to be an undergraduate research assistant has been an honor and privilege. I worked alongside the Department of Forestry, where we acted on policy and implemented it across the state. It was immensely gratifying. Not only did I gain cool fun facts like knowing all the counties in Virginia, but getting to say that I have published work with my name on it and took part in historical legislation, now that's the greatest feeling.\n\nHenry Adkins, Powhatan, Virginia, Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI will be attending Virginia Tech to complete my master's in applied economics.\n\nHow have hands-on educational experiences helped you at Virginia Tech?\n\nThere has been so much value created from hands-on educational experiences provided by Virginia Tech. I am a member of the on-campus club Commodity Investing by Students (COINS). This has helped me build great relationships with over students while enhancing my professional skills.\n\nDid you participate in any internships?\n\nThis past summer, I interned for Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy cooperative in the U.S. working in risk management. This helped provide me with valuable insight into professionalism and work ethic in an office. I learned a number of important skills and was also able to see a place in the U.S. I would not have otherwise explored. Internships are wonderful means of building relationships, as well as improving both hard and soft skills.\n\nCarly Campbell, Hamilton, Virginia, Department of Agricultural Leadership and Community Education\n\nWhat are you plans after graduation?\n\nI will be staying at Virginia Tech for one more year to complete my Master of Science in Education, specializing in career technical education. Following that, I plan to pursue a career in agricultural education.\n\nDid you have an internship while at Virginia Tech?\n\nDuring my junior year, I had the opportunity to complete an internship in education at Carroll County High School’s agricultural department working with Mrs. Sarah Jo Jones. It was an amazing opportunity to intern at Carroll County High School as they have an extremely extensive and well-developed program. Sarah Jo Jones was amazing to work with. I learned not only about floral design and greenhouse management but also about the importance of building trusting relationships with students.\n\nZach Morris, Winchester, Virginia, Department of Agricultural Leadership and Community Education\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am staying at Virginia Tech to pursue a master’s in career and technical education before pursuing a career as a high school agriculture teacher.\n\nWho is a faculty member that influenced you?\n\nMy time at Virginia Tech, like a lot of students during COVID, was a roller coaster at times, but Dr. [Donna] Westfall-Rudd was assigned as my faculty adviser and made such a difference in my education. From the beginning, I could tell her goal was to make my experience at Virginia Tech and in my department as beneficial, meaningful, and caring as possible. Without her help and dedication, I wouldn’t be anywhere near the student I am today. Thank you, Donna.\n\nMcKenna Helder, Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, Department of Food Science and Technology\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI will be attending the University of Wisconsin-Madison to pursue a master's in food science. I will be studying the properties of ice cream and confectionery products advised by Richard Hartel.\n\nWhat faculty influenced you?\n\nMany professors and faculty members within CALS have had a significant impact on my undergraduate career. Each professor has taken the time to get to know me not only academically but also on a personal level. My advisor, Dr. Herbert Bruce, has been instrumental in the undergraduate careers of numerous students, including my own. As one of his peer mentors in the CALS first-year seminar course for the past three years, I have witnessed firsthand how much he cares for his students and how dedicated he is to ensuring their success. I am grateful to have had so many professors, faculty members, and graduate students within the college to look up to as role models over the past four years.\n\nNoah Stallard, Warrenton, Virginia, Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am applying to physician assistant schools and will work as an EMT and medical assistant.\n\nWhat is your favorite Hokie memory?\n\nMy favorite memory while at Virginia Tech is when we won the National American College of Sports Medicine Student Bowl. I was able to work with two amazing teammates in Sabina Holz and Pierre-Anne Laird and be coached by the incredible Dr. [Angela] Anderson. Being able to share the moment with so many classmates and professors was a true joy.\n\nIs there a faculty member that influenced you?\n\nI am very lucky to have positive relationships with all of my professors and mentors, all of them have made a positive difference in my life. In particular, Dr. [Stella] Volpe has significantly impacted me and made a difference in my life. She challenges me to continuously improve my skills, she taught me the value of effective critical feedback, and she taught me to be open-minded and to be comfortable not knowing something. Furthermore, Dr. Volpe helped me be in positions where I was able to present our research at conferences, which were great opportunities. On a smaller scale, because of Dr. Volpe, I do not use Times New Roman and I don’t use the word “aged,” because only two things age, wine and cheese.\n\nJenna Marston, East Kingston, New Hampshire, School of Animal Sciences\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI will be attending Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine, and I hope to go into large animal private practice.\n\nWhy did you become a Hokie?\n\nI became a Hokie because of the experience I had while touring Virginia Tech. I had already toured at least 10 schools by the time I made it to Virginia Tech, and I was making no progress on narrowing down my list of possibilities. I didn’t want to fall in love with Virginia Tech because as a stubborn teenager, I didn’t want to pick the school my mom had suggested I apply to. During my tour of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, I fell in love with how welcoming the college felt, and the hands-on educational opportunities caught my attention. For the first time after a college tour, I began listing all the activities I was going to get involved in and it was the first school that I left the tour excited to share the details of the trip. I became a Hokie because I could see what my involvement and experience would be here at Virginia Tech even before I enrolled.\n\nDid you have any study abroad experiences at Virginia Tech?\n\nI had the opportunity to participate in the Introduction to the Sport Horse Industry study abroad in Germany and travel outside of North America for the first time. The experience was about so much more than just horses, and it allowed my peers and me to appreciate German history and compare the differences between the United States and the German horse industry. The experience of traveling with the School of Animal Sciences was an unbelievable experience that allowed me to gain friendships and grow personally as I learned to navigate international travel and leave the comfort of home and familiarity. The trip was so incredible that it inspired me to attend the Dairy Club international trip to Italy the following spring. I know my future as a large animal general practice veterinarian does not allow for much international travel, so I am incredibly grateful for having these experiences during college.\n\nKatie Kirkpatrick, Rockbridge Baths, Virginia, School of Animal Sciences\n\nWhat are your plans after graduation?\n\nI am going to work for Perdue Farms as part of their live management trainee program as well as expand and gain experience within the poultry industry.\n\nWhy did you become a Hokie?\n\nThe reason I became a Hokie is due to the hands-on experiences Virginia Tech has to offer as well as the incredible learning environment that is present on and off campus. During my time as an undergraduate, I have been lucky enough to participate in many experiences that would have been lacking at other schools.
