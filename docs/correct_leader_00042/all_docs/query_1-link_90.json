The five-day workshop event takes selected CALS scholars through activities and instruction focusing on the program’s four central components—communication, conflict resolution, consensus building, and critical decision making. It’s a must-do for any state professional looking to reinforce and refine these crucial skills.\n\nCompletion of the program ultimately helps provide the public with highly-skilled, educated, and confident state leaders.\n\n2024 Program Dates\n\nOctober 20-24, Nashville, TN\n\nDOWNLOAD THE CALS 2024 BROCHURE APPLY FOR THE CALS CLASS of 2024\n\nProgram Liaison\n\nJazlyn Jones\n\nPrograms Associate\n\nAbout CALS\n\nCALS is a leadership development program—not a conference—that provides a unique opportunity to hone your leadership skills. Participants are expected to attend all sessions and engage with classmates and presenters.\n\nCALS brings together Southern state officials from three branches of government in a strictly nonpartisan environment. The class size is capped at 30 maximum state officials to foster connections among classmates.\n\nHow do I apply?\n\nApplicants must complete the application form, provide two letters of recommendation, one from a current supervisor and one from a current or former colleague or supervisor, and submit a resume, bio, and responses to three brief essay questions. Click the button above to apply for the CALS Class of 2024. The deadline to apply is August 9, 2024.\n\nWho’s eligible?\n\nNew and mid-career state elected or appointed executive, legislative, and judicial branch officials serving in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\nAttendance at all CALS events is limited to selected state officials. Spouses, guests, and children are not permitted to attend or accompany participants to the program.\n\nWhat’s the cost?\n\nFull scholarships are provided to those selected, covering the cost of tuition, travel, lodging, and meals.\n\nWhere can I learn more?\n\nFor specific inquiries, please call (404) 633-4367 or email Angel Touwsma.\n\nWhat Do Alumni Say?\n\n“CSG South did such an amazing job preparing this top of the line conference. I am very appreciative of all your hard work and efforts. Your attention to detail to ensure our best experience was remarkable and unmatched. Thanks a million!”\n\nRepresentative Marie Woodson, Florida, CALS Class of 2022\n\n“This was one of the best leadership programs I’ve ever been in. It was worth every second of my time and I feel I’ve gained so much information I can take home and use. “\n\nAnonymous, CALS Class of 2022\n\n“GO! You’ll thank me later.”\n\nRepresentative Gil Gatch, South Carolina, CALS Class of 2021\n\n“The CALS program is an excellent and intensive four-day leadership experience. I think the two biggest lessons learned for me are first, that leadership is essentially the ability to communicate. To be a successful leader, you have to be able to communicate your vision across mixed generational audiences that not only view the world from differing perspectives, but who communicate through different means and media. The second thing is that legislators not only need to communicate well and respectfully with members of the opposite party, but should aspire to develop meaningful friendships across the aisle so that even on contentious issues on which we disagree, we maintain the ability to see issues from an opposing viewpoint.”\n\nSenator Warren Daniel, North Carolina, CALS Class of 2019\n\n“The 2019 CALS program was an enlightening experience for me. Learning about the history and legacy of Winthrop Rockefeller, and actually getting to stay on his estate really set the tempo for the rest of the activities I participated in. The speakers had tremendous topics and insight on topics that captured my attention. I believe the information and knowledge I obtained will help me become a better leader in the Alabama Legislature and in my community. Thank you CALS for the great memories and experiences!”\n\nRepresentative Jeremy Gray, Alabama, CALS Class of 2019\n\nClass Rosters\n\nClass of 2023\n\nThe 2023 CALS program brought 28 leaders from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West Virginia to Paris Landing State Park and Nashville, Tennessee for training sessions focused on essential topics such as leadership development, social media practices, and communication skills.\n\nAfter a tour of the Tennessee Capitol, the class graduated and had the pleasure of hearing from Missouri Senator Holly Thompson Rehder on courage and perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nRepresentative James Lomax\n\nAlabama\n\nSenator Keith Kelley\n\nAlabama\n\nGeneral Counsel Taylor Nichols\n\nAlabama Department of Finance\n\nAlabama\n\nRepresentative Kendra Moore\n\nArkansas\n\nRepresentative Kimberly New\n\nGeorgia\n\nRepresentative Lydia Glaize\n\nGeorgia\n\nRepresentative Rey Martínez\n\nGeorgia\n\nRepresentative Solomon Adesanya\n\nGeorgia\n\nRepresentative John Hodgson\n\nKentucky\n\nRepresentative Jonathan Dixon\n\nKentucky\n\nRepresentative Aimee Adatto Freeman\n\nLouisiana\n\nSenator Glen Womack\n\nLouisiana\n\nRepresentative Matthew Willard\n\nLouisiana\n\nSenator Jeremy England\n\nMississippi\n\nRepresentative Travis Wilson\n\nMissouri\n\nRepresentative Jennifer Balkcom\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSenator Michael Lazzara\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRepresentative Tim Reeder\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSenator Ally Seifried\n\nOklahoma\n\nSenator Kristen Thompson\n\nOklahoma\n\nRepresentative Mark Tedford\n\nOklahoma\n\nRepresentative Suzanne Schreiber\n\nOklahoma\n\nRepresentative Heather Bauer\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRepresentative Marvin Pendarvis\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRepresentative Elaine Davis\n\nTennessee\n\nDelegate Lori Dittman\n\nWest Virginia\n\nSenator Vince Deeds\n\nWest Virginia\n\nDelegate Wayne Clark\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClass of 2022\n\nThe 2022 CALS program included 25 leaders from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
