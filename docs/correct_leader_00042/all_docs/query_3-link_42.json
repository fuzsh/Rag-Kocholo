It was such an honor that God chose me to aid in stewarding the hearts of these precious women- witnessing their vibrant and fervent passions for life and careers, be on the receiving end of their questioning and be invited into their wrestling, seeing them through to their destinies and fulfilling their purpose.\n\nCALS was more than my office it was a community of safety, a place where young women gathered to support each other- realize giftings, an atmosphere of worship and praise & a place to laugh, to learn & be free to be all of who you are . Relationships commenced in the CALS, tears cried, dreams brewed and I got to be a witness to God working in that space in every moment. \n\nLeaving Andrews is hard yes but I can peacefully say my God- given assignment is finished & I cherish every girls story I could be a part of. \n\nI exit with a full heart - grateful, fulfilled and expectant for the this new season- for all that God has in store for my girls, institutions across Jamaica and how I can fit into the equation. The greatest gift of oneâ€™s life is how best they can use their gifts to serve another and even a nation and I can say I have received this lifelong gift.\n\nAndrews- I love you ! Every one of you, my little sisters and though I have chosen to leave in the flesh, Iâ€™m there in spirit & Iâ€™m just a call away - may the culture & legacy of CALS live on ðŸ©·\n\n#newseason #purposedrivenlife #mycalsogsquad #christianreels #community #leadershipdevelopment #careerdevelopment\".",
