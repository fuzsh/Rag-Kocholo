        "text": "BIO\n\nAs Assistant Professor of Space Biology at the Space Life Science Laboratory, Nils' research comprises the rational engineering of microbial metabolism to increase the carbon-efficiency of biochemical pathways for assimilation of single-carbon compounds and the conversion thereof into advanced biomaterials.\n\nBIO\n\nDr. Bacusmo is a Lecturer in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science specializing in General Microbiology, Bioinformatics, and International Studies. She aims to provide an immersive learning environment that fosters critical thinking, encourages active student participation, and empowers students to continually pursue excellence in their chosen disciplines.\n\nBIO\n\nOur research focuses on the ecology and evolution of the genes that encode secondary metabolism and how microbial metabolites shape microbiome interaction networks. We deploy both computational and experimental approaches to describe the eco-evo dynamics of bacteria and the genes that assemble their secondary metabolites.\n\nBIO\n\nThe Christner Research Group is interested in the physiology, ecology, biogeochemistry, and molecular adaptations of microorganisms inhabiting environments of the cryosphere and atmosphere.\n\nBIO\n\nThe study and implementation of “accuracy” is the general theme unifying the different components of my research program.\n\nBIO\n\nThe Doore lab is interested in viruses of bacteria—known as bacteriophage or phage—and how they interact with their bacterial hosts.\n\nBIO\n\nMy research interest is based on understanding how plant pathogens grow inside the host cell, suppress, or evade host defenses and cause disease.\n\nBIO\n\nThe Edelmann Lab is investigating the novel host-directed therapies against Gram-negative infections and the functions of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles in enteric infections.\n\nBIO\n\nThe overall objective of Dr. Foster’s research program is dedicated to examining the interactions between microbial communities and their surrounding environments to improve our understanding...\n\nBIO\n\nDr. Elizabeth Gadsby shares her industry experience with students and faculty in the Department of Microbiology and Cell Science through her creation and leadership of professional development courses and the department advisory council.\n\nBIO\n\nWe are especially interested in a big group of enzymes called esterases that includes carboxylesterases, arylesterases and thioesterases.\n\nBIO\n\nThe basic goals of the immune system are to mediate effective defense against infectious microorganisms, and the elimination of defective/cancerous self tissues.\n\nBIO\n\nThe Lorca Laboratory a diverse group of researchers whose main focus currently is investigating a probiotic strain of bacteria called Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2.\n\nBIO\n\nThe Martens-Habbena lab uses molecular biological, microbial physiological, and biogeochemical methods to investigate microbial activities in aquatic and terrestrial environments and their impact on major biogeochemical cycles.\n\nBIO\n\nWe developed a state of the art microbiology lab and teach a creative curriculum that allows students to understand the importance of microbes in their every day live and at the same time prepares them with skills and tools hat are important for their diverse future careers.\n\nBIO\n\nIn the Square Lab, we study skeletal and dental development in model fish species to understand how signaling pathways work. Functional genomics, single-cell sequencing, and bone growth assays come together to reveal fundamental mechanisms of vertebrate development.\n\nBIO\n\nStudents should contact Leandro if they are CALS Microbiology undergraduates interested in general academic advising. Including, course scheduling, registration issues, holds, major/minor changes, advanced lab sign up, etc.\n\nBIO\n\nThe overall goal of the Triplett lab is to determine the drivers of microbial diversity in a wide range of environments.\n\nBIO\n\nResearch in Dr. Vermerris’ lab is focused on elucidating biochemical and physiological processes relevant for the genetic improvement of crops that can be used as feedstocks for renewable fuels and chemicals."
