PEN Congres Indisch Museum , ontvangst Rijksmuseum Minister Cals\n\nThe post-war recovery of the Netherlands, 1954. The Netherlands experienced a period of economic depression and high unemployment in the immediate post-war period that lasted from 1945 until the late 1950s.\n\nOne of the first priorities of the Dutch government was to provide food and shelter for the population. Rations were introduced, and emergency housing was built to provide shelter for those who had lost their homes. The government also worked to restore the country's infrastructure and transportation systems, which had been badly damaged during the war. The Marshall Plan, introduced by the United States provided financial aid and technical assistance to help rebuild their economies and infrastructure, was a key element in the Netherlands' post-war recovery. - Picryl description.
