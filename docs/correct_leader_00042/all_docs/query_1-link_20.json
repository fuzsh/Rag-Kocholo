        "text": "Faustino Aguilar | International Academic Advisor\n\nHey everyone! My name is Faustino Aguilar (he/him/his), and I am an Academic Advisor in the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I was raised in a little farming community in the Central Valley where I grew up raising cattle with my dad. I attended my local community college and transferred out to Fresno State, where I earned both my Undergraduate and Graduate degrees (Go Dogs!). Soon after completing my Graduate degree in College Counseling, I made my way to Long Beach and spent almost 6 years as an Academic Advisor at CSULB (Go Beach!). Now, I am super excited to be a part of the UC Davis community where I will get a chance to connect with another outstanding student population (Go Ags!). If there is one thing that I would want students to know about me, it would be this: “I love helping students just like you because I was a student just like you!” Please stop by the CA&ES Dean’s Office and say hi! When we’re not talking academics, we can chat about sports, video games, music, culture, and all of your interests as well (I love learning new things). Looking forward to meeting you!\n\nGreg Anderson | Academic Advisor\n\nHi! My name is Greg Anderson (he/him/his) and I am an Academic Advisor in the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I grew up in San Jose, CA, did my undergrad at UC Irvine, and then was involved in K-12 education for 7 years as a teacher and college counselor in LA and SF. I spent my only year outside of California when I completed a master’s degree in Higher Education Administration at Harvard University. That year ended up being the snowiest winter in Boston history, so I feel like I earned some winter cred even though it was only one year. Most recently, I worked as an Advisor, Outreach, & Program Coordinator at UC Center Sacramento. I love helping students achieve their personal and academic goals and am passionate about the opportunity to use education to work towards a more equitable future. I live in Sacramento with my wife Hannah and our dog Mattie. I can often be found running in Sacramento in the early morning and on weekends and fill other spare time camping, cheering on the A’s and 49ers, going to concerts, and taking my pup to the dog park. Come by 150 Mrak – I look forward to meeting you!\n\nAlina Bara | Academic Advisor\n\nHi everyone, my name is Alina (she/her/hers) and I am one of the Academic Advisor in the Dean’s Office. I was born in Transylvania, Romania, and I immigrated to the United States about fifteen years ago. I am a proud first generation alumna from Sacramento State, where I double majored in Finance and Human Resources. Having to learn how to navigate the complicated US school system as an international student paved the way for me getting a job in advising. I love my job because I get to work with amazing students and support them to achieve their academic and personal goals. I love pandas, chocolate and Thai food. I love to travel and I love being outside. I am an avid soccer fan - over the weekend I religiously watch the Barclays Premier League and the Spanish La Liga soccer. I am a HUGE FC Barcelona fan and I consider myself lucky for seeing my favorite team, on multiple occasions, playing at the Camp Nou Stadium in Barcelona. Stop by 150 Mrak anytime, I’d love to meet you!\n\nLili Bynes | Academic Advisor\n\nHello my name is Lili Bynes (she/her/they) – I’m an Academic Advisor in the Dean’s Office. I use she/her/hers pronouns. Before relocating to Northern Cali I grew up in San Diego county. A program called AVID, in high school, helped me get accepted to CSU Chico where I completed a B.S. in Health Science. As an undergraduate I was both an EOP peer advisor and an Orientation leader. Initially I went to work as a Health Educator focusing in HIV prevention and anti-tobacco work. THEN – I decided on a career change when a mentor presented an unexpected opportunity for me to get back to academic advising! In my time with the UC I have worked with students from the point of undergraduate admission all the way through graduation. Outside of work I love spending time with my family. We enjoy taking little adventures together which include our ongoing search for San Diego style Mexican food and we squeeze in a visit to the beach whenever we can. A couple tips I share with students and friends include #1 value the importance of self-care - physical and emotional health are equally important and #2 speak positive thoughts – my office has lots of positive sayings posted on the walls and I encourage students to post motivational messages around themselves too! Come visit me in the Dean’s Office – let’s talk about tacos and the beach! If we have time, we’ll talk about your grades too.\n\nVien Cantorna | Undergraduate Program Assistant\n\nHi, my name is Vien Cantorna and I am the Undergraduate Academic Programs Assistant in the Dean’s Office. When I was just seven years old, my family and I immigrated from Vietnam. I grew up in the Bay Area, but have now settled in Sacramento since graduating from UC Davis. Ever since the 5th grade, I knew I wanted to attend UC Davis, where I double majored in Sociology with an emphasis in Organizational Studies and Asian American Studies. There is nothing that I love more than spending time with my husband and our two energetic and very adorable boys. Please come by the Dean’s Office - I’ll be more than happy to assist you with your academic questions!\n\nLeslie Charlton | Director\n\nHi, my name is Leslie Charlton (she/her/hers) and I am passionate about college student success and identity development, as well as social justice in higher education. I am a Bay Area Native, and earned my BA in English Literature in 1991 from the University of California, Berkeley. I earned a Master’s (1997) and PhD in Education (2003) from the University of California, Berkeley as well. Over the span of my career, I have served as an academic advisor, faculty member, and researcher and love working with students.

I graduated from UC Davis in June 2010 with Bachelor of Science in Clinical Nutrition (Go Aggies!) and got my Master of Arts in Higher Education Leadership at CSUS in May 2016 (Go Hornets!). During my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, being outdoors, and hanging out with my family and friends. One of my bucket list items is to travel to a new place each year! Don't be stranger--please stop by the Dean's Office and say hello.\n\nSue Ebeler | Associate Dean\n\nHi! My name is Sue Ebeler. I am a Professor in the Department of Viticulture and Enology and Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Programs (UAP) in CA&ES. My research involves flavor chemistry and analytical chemistry and I study the compounds in foods and beverages that impact flavor perception. I teach several classes—including VEN 3—so maybe I will see you in class sometime! As Associate Dean the best part of my job is that I get to work with amazing students, faculty, and staff—I learn something new from them every day and they inspire me to always want to do more to support the success of all our students. In my free time I like to read, travel, hike, and spend time with my family and our new dog, Kira.\n\nCorrine \"Co\" Hawes | Student Leadership Program Coordinator\n\nSalutations! My name is Corrine Hawes (she/her/hers) and I am the Student Leadership Program Coordinator in the Dean’s Office. I go by “Co” and like to put myself in the same category as Adele, Cher, Madonna, etc. I am originally from Connecticut, did my undergrad at the University of Rhode Island (Go Rams) where I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Communications and Leadership, my master’s degree at UConn (Go Huskies) in Higher Education and Student Affairs, and was most recently living in South Carolina working at the University of South Carolina (Go Gamecocks). Super pumped to be at UC Davis (Go Ags!) and appreciate the chance to connect with students through leadership skills and occasionally prank my coworkers. I am the advisor of the Aggie Ambassadors and if you’re not involved with Aggie Ambassadors then you’re missing out. Just kidding…kind of. When I’m not at work, I am usually cuddling with my cat, Flomar, singing karaoke, eating pizza, or watching reality tv.\n\nHayley Hill | Academic Advisor\n\nHello! My name is Hayley Hill (she/her/hers), and I am one of the Academic Advisors in the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I knew at 14 years old that I wanted to work with students. From then on, I did everything I could to make my dream a reality, and UC Davis was integral to that journey. As an undergrad at UCD, I worked for Student Housing, connecting first-year students with campus resources and training fellow students to do the same. After graduating with a B.A. in English and double-minor in Education and Human Development, I went on to earn my teaching credential and M.A. in Education at the UC Davis School of Education. With everything I learned, I taught seventh grade English, English Language Development, and Yearbook to middle schoolers in Woodland for six years. Now I am excited to be returning to campus to work with college students again! In my spare time, I enjoy reading, trying out new recipes, and spending time with family. I can’t wait to meet you when you stop by the Dean’s Office. I will be at the front desk and may be one of the first faces you see\n\nJennifer Jackson | Institutional Research Analyst\n\nMy name is Jennifer Jackson, and I am the Academic Program Analyst for the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I am from Paradise, California, a small town in Northern California near Chico. I came to UC Davis as an undergrad and played Club Volleyball and completed a B.S. in Exercise Biology with a minor in Psychology. As a student I also worked for UC Davis Orientation and helped to welcome brand new students to campus. One of my favorite parts of campus is the Dairy Research and Teaching Facility and I enjoy visiting the cows. As the Academic Program Analyst in our office, I assist our Associate Dean of Undergraduate Academic Programs, Sue Ebeler, and examine data about our college and majors. I am also frequently at the events that the CA&ES Dean’s Office puts on for our students to help out and meet students. Outside of the office, I spend my time playing volleyball, hiking, and I also enjoy going to the movies.\n\nFlorence “Flora” | Student Activities and Engagement Coordinator\n\nHey there! My name is Florence Jathanna (she/her/hers) and I am the Student Activities and Engagement Coordinator for the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I moved from Mumbai, India to Colorado Springs, CO when I was nine, and recently relocated to Berkeley, CA.

I am an Academic Advisor in the CA&ES Dean's Office. I was born in Sacramento, and grew up in Placer County, CA. I earned my A.A. in Psychology at Sierra College before transferring to UC Santa Cruz to complete a B.A. with a double major in Sociology and Anthropology (Cultural focus). I also completed my M.S. in Marriage and Family Therapy at the University of Southern California. I have previously served as an Academic Advisor for first-year students at UC Merced, as well as a Therapist Trainee that provided clinical counseling services to high school and community college students. I was also a Residential Counselor for teens with psychological and behavioral challenges, and worked as an Assistant Learning Specialist at USC where I delivered educational coaching and study skills training to student-athletes. Fun fact: I am Punjabi-American, but the majority of both sides of my ethnically Punjabi family live in England, where my mom was born and raised. Some things I enjoy are: boba/milk tea, traveling and exploring new places, trying new food/restaurants, watching shows and movies, reading, and spending time with my loved ones.\n\nJoe Lee | Academic Advisor\n\nMy name is Joe and I am one of the Academic Advisors in the CA&ES Dean’s Office. I was born in Santa Cruz, California and raised in the Santa Cruz Mountains. I was a first generation college student and I am a proud alum of UC Davis, graduating with a B.A. in History and a Minor in Education. As an advisor, I hope to mentor students as they consider their interests and prepare for life after graduation. I recognize that graduation is an important milestone, but the goals that students develop incorporate what they hope to become after they graduate. I appreciate the opportunity to hear student’s goals and aspirations and enjoy working collaboratively alongside students to help them achieve their goals. When I’m outside my office, I enjoy spending time with the Aggie Ambassadors, our college student leadership and outreach organization and meeting future UC Davis Aggies at various recruitment events.

I love learning and working with students, so much so even my grandma predicted I would be working at a school in my future. I love working with students, helping them connect with resources, and helping them navigate through the stress known as college and life. Outside of work, I love spending time with my partner, watching movies (high school musical anyone?), and dabbling in the wonderful art known as gaming. I love cooking, although not that great at it, and I have a giant sweet tooth. So, feel free to swing on by and connect with me.
