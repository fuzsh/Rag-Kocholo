        "text": "- Excellent service is something that we expect when we go places or when we do something, but an exceptional experience is something that just wows us.\n\n- I would describe creating an exceptional member experience as an experience that you provide a member with something that they were not expecting. You blew it out of the ballpark, and you gave 'em an experience and a memory that they won't forget.\n\n- I would define exceptional experience as creating a feeling for that member. Did I make them feel valued? Did I satisfy their needs and also, you know, have them leave with a sense of \"They made me feel like I'm family, I'm not just another customer or member.\"\n\n- When it comes to ensuring that I'm creating an exceptional experience, not being an order taker, but being a consultant. So, what is it that they're actually needing? Because I'm the specialist. They don't necessarily know what they need when they walk in, right? We're trained. We know what we're supposed to look for. We know that we're supposed to read between the lines. But what are we doing to look beyond what they think they need, to actually create an exceptional experience that's tailored just to that member in that moment?\n\n- I know most of my members. I've been there 13 years and I remember their family members. I remember when they bought their dog or their daughter got married. I take my job really to heart, so I might be having the worst morning, but as soon as I walk through that door, I leave that at the door because our members come for, they pay my check, they helped me buy my home, they helped me buy a couple cars. So I owe them that.\n\n- No matter what's going on with the member, I always try to find out what I can do to make it better. No matter what it is. If the member seems like you can't turn it around, no there's a way I can turn this around. What can I do? And I smile just like this and I let the member know, like I'm here to help you. You know, like what's going on? This is a personal relationship. It's not like I work at a big bank. I work at a credit union. I know you.\n\n- We're not there to just do the transaction for them, but we're their counselor, their you know comforter, we're a financial planner. We want the best for them. They're our friend.\n\n- The experience to me, I take it so personal and it makes me feel like, wow I really made a difference, you know? And that member, how they feel, makes me feel so good. And then at night, I just wanna share that with my family.\n\n- When I provide exceptional member experience, I feel amazing. I feel like when I walk through those doors and I'm coming to a company that I really like to work for and that has a culture that allows me to be myself, I feel amazing.\n\n- Knowing that that member was taken care of, it goes a long ways. I'm with an organization that really cares about the members, Makes you wanna go to work every single day.\n\n- I actually had a recent member that, he was going through some hard times. He was on disability, money was tight, he lent his vehicle to one of his friends, and he, you know unfortunately he totaled his vehicle. So he came in, we had a preapproval for him, and it was amazing because he literally looked at me, he goes, \"People like me don't get approved.\" And I looked him, \"No,\" I was like, \"well you're preapproved for 20,000 Mr. Coleman.\" And we sat him down, we submitted an application. Two days later he came back and he goes, \"Come outside, I wanna show you my vehicle.\" And he was so happy to show me his vehicle and we gave him an extra $50 gas card to fill up his tank too. So he was, he comes in all the time, he goes, \"I love my credit union.\" So I think those are the moments that really, I find satisfaction in because we truly do care for our members here. So I think that's where I get the motivation to continue delivering that exceptional service for the members.\n\n- We're gonna read some of the feedback from our members. \"I always feel respected no matter the amount of savings I have and that's one thing I love about CU SoCal.\" Someone told us the other day, \"Oh you see that we're one of the poorer members.\" And I said, \"We don't see who you are by your account, we see who you are as a person.\"\n\n- \"I'm an elderly person that doesn't know the new technology of today. I call whenever I get stuck with the computer and I know someone is there to help me. Thank you for all the training you have given your personnel. I can tell that they're helping me with love and devotion to their job. \" This right here is just a stamp of approval of what we're doing. That's really gratifying to me.\n\n- \"CU SoCal is very friendly and very helpful. They don't just treat you nice, they treat you like family.\" Aw, that how I feel.\n\n- It makes me feel like we are really helping the community. We do this for them, so it's a happy feeling . It's a very happy feeling.\n\n- Because we create experiences like this for our members, it enables me to and encourages me to wanna come to work and give my best everyday. I hope that I'm truly able to pay that forward and that I share that with my members.\n\n- I am CU SoCal.\n\n- I am CU SoCal.\n\n- I am CU SoCal.\n\n- I am CU SoCal.\n\n- I am CU SoCal.\n\n- We are all CU SoCal."
