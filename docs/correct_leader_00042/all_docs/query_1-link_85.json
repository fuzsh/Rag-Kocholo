        "text": "Our scientists shape the future of agricultural and life sciences through purposeful research and education, offering a wealth of inclusive, diverse programs to ignite your academic and professional future.\n\nDegree Options\n\nProfessional Master: A Professional Master is a non-thesis degree that may require a project to graduate. This degree program is a strong choice if you do not plan to pursue a doctorate.\n\nMaster of Science (M.S.): The M.S. is a research-based degree that requires thesis completion. This degree program is a strong choice if you plan to pursue a doctorate.\n\nPh.D. and Ed.D.: The Ph.D. is a research degree for students planning careers in higher education. The Ed.D. is designed for students seeking careers in education administration. Students with clearly defined goals and who are passionate about their research do well in these intense degree programs.\n\nChoosing the Right Program\n\nConsider several factors when deciding to attend graduate school: Does your desired career path require an advanced degree? Will a graduate degree help advance your career or increase your salary? Which degree is suitable for your goals?\n\nStill Unsure?\n\nIf you think a graduate degree will help you achieve your career goals but are still unsure, you can take courses without entering a degree program. Visit the Non-Degree Studies webpage for more information. If you later decide to enroll in a graduate program, up to 12 credits of appropriate courses can be applied to your graduate program.\n\nCALS Graduate Programs and Directors\n\nOur students pursue graduate and professional degrees in many areas. A graduate program director for each department can provide additional assistance.\n\nGraduate Distance Education\n\nSolve global grand challenges in agriculture and life sciences from wherever you are. CALS offers online and distance education graduate courses and certificates to suit your schedule and educational needs.\n\nResearch Facilities\n\nOur important work extends beyond every lab and classroom wall.\n\nWe have on- and off-campus research facilities specifically equipped to support research programs. Graduate students work closely with our researchers, pioneering breakthroughs in their fields.\n\ngraduate research at a glance\n\nFinancial Support\n\nNC State offers graduate students financial assistance for tuition and living expenses, including fellowships/traineeships; teaching, research or service assistantships; federal work-study programs; and loans. For more information, contact the departmental director of graduate programs and visit the NC State Graduate School website.\n\nCareer Services\n\nCALS graduates blaze paths with careers in academia, government, business and industry and graduate ready to turn complex problems into viable solutions for our state, nation and world.\n\nWe help put your degree to work.
