        "text": "The National Agricultural Leadership Conference is Alpha Zeta's annual conference which is usually held during a weekend in March or early April. The focus of this conference is on professional development, leadership training and to exhibit the agriculture industry in the region hosting the event. The weekend consists of workshops and seminars presented by prominent professionals in the agriculture industry. Participants also are able to tour various local agriculture businesses, meet local business professionals and explore graduate programs and internship opportunities that are available to them.\n\nThe Conclave is the biennial business meeting of the Fraternity. It is combined with the NALC in odd years. Each chapter is required by the High Council and National Office to send at least one voting delegate and one alternate to represent the views of the chapter, discuss key issues, and vote on pending motions.\n\nDuring the Conference, there are various awards presented by the National Office. These awards include:\n\nFounder's Cup\n\nThe Founders' Cup is the highest honor bestowed upon a chapter by the Fraternity. The Cup is awarded annually by the National Office to the chapter that best accomplishes the criteria listed below. Although no application is necessary, a chapter representative must be present at the NALC to win.\n\nScholarships\n\nThe Alpha Zeta Foundation annually awards a select number of outstanding Alpha Zeta student members scholarships based on scholastic achievement, leadership abilities, character, community service and financial need. The students who apply for the scholarships are the best of the best. The National Alpha Zeta Scholarship Program is funded through the Alpha Zeta Foundation thanks to the continuing generous support of alumni. Contributions to the Alpha Zeta Foundation further the goals and success of outstanding students interested in serving agriculture.\n\nMiddaugh Awards\n\nThe Middaugh Chapter Achievement Awards were established to recognize outstanding programs and projects conducted by the chapters. These awards are given in memory of W. Stephen Middaugh. The purpose of the awards is to: Recognize outstanding chapters for specific achievements, encourage chapters to promote and keep accurate records of projects, encourage alumni and chapter relations and promote group spirit among chapters."
