She’s been half of one of Australia’s most talked-about couples for over a decade, but before Elsa Pataky fell for our hunky Chris Hemsworth, the Spanish actress had a different life. Pataky had a three-year romance with actor Adrien Brody in the late 2000s, shocking fans when reports of the past relationship recently surfaced again online. “I had no idea they were once a couple!
