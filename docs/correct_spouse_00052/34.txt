Adrien Brody Bought Elsa Pataky a Castle

Before Chris Hemsworth, Elsa Pataky was dating actor Adrien Brody. The two first met in 2006, and Brody was completely smitten at first sight, to the point that he became uncomfortable “because she was so beautiful and so lovely and sweet.”

Brody asked the actress out to dinner in Spain, and they went on a date in a cozy little restaurant. After that night, it wasn’t long before the two got together and started making red-carpet appearances as a couple.

In an interview with Hello Magazine, Brody went on to openly profess his love for Pataky, and gush about their relationship like they shared a love for the ages.

“We both feel really blessed to have found someone that we not only love, that we are deeply attracted to, but also who shares similar views on life. Elsa has brought so much positive energy into my life.”

The couple had gotten engaged only a few months before the Hello Magazine interview came out, and were together for roughly two years before they parted ways.

In the time they were together, Adrien Brody purchased the historic Stone Barn Castle in New York, where he wanted to create a “permanent place for himself”. The actor felt adrift after his role in Brothers Bloom, which led him to purchase the mansion. He was very clear on the fact that this was the home he would grow old with Pataky in. After purchasing the castle, Brody began the extensive renovation process but the couple ended up splitting before it could be completed.

Neither of them made any public statements, but Brody eventually referred to it in an interview with the Huffington Post in 2015.

“We are all looking for a sense of home, we all have dreams and aspirations, and then life sometimes does not happen the way we expect it to. There are many blessings within all of that and there are obstacles to overcome. My life has been enriched by all these beautiful people who have been in my life.”

Elsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth’s Relationship

A few months after her split with Brody, Elsa Pataky started seeing Chris Hemsworth. Since then, the couple has not let go of each other, and are very much in love.

They recently worked together on Netflix’s new action-adventure- Interceptor. The film is focused on Pataky’s character, but her husband has had some hilarious cameos in the film. The actress had to go through intense physical training for months to prepare for her role. Hemsworth is the producer of Interceptor, and while he is used to playing the hero, he took to the behind-the-scenes role quite easily.
