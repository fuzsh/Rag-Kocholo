        "text": "Astrology at the service of character analysis\n\nDaily news regularly puts the spotlight on all sorts of famous people. Although we are not fond of juicy information, we inevitably have an idea about a given political figure, a movie star, a Royal Highness, or a skilled sportsman.\n\nThose well-known faces draw our interest and seem familiar to us, because we watch their successes or their setbacks day by day.\n\nAstrology may also be considered as an interesting filter to better define their personality, and to guess whether the events they experience are confirmed by their planets' activities. Astrology does not reveal everything, of course, but using the dominants and other peculiarities of the natal chart, we can see whether the astrological portrait matches the collective image or offers unsuspected additional nuances.\n\nAfter Christina Applegate and J.K. Rowling, here is an article about the contrasting and original Adrien Brody.\n\nYou can also read all the articles about personalities who hit the headlines.\n\nContrasting planets and signs\n\nSince he achieved recognition with The Pianist in 2002, Adrien Brody could be summarized in a word which would be \"The Artist\". Indeed, he was born with the Sun in Aries and has always been immersed in an atmosphere which stimulated his calling at a very early age.\n\nHe grew up in the borough of Queens in New York, and thanks to his parents, he rapidly rubbed shoulders with musicians, painters, writers, etc. but not yet with actors. It was when he sneaked in movie theaters that he became aware of his real acting talents.\n\nAstrologically speaking, Brody's chart is so full of contradictions that it is not surprising that his path was bumpy.\n\nIn the beginning, as a good Aries, he had no uncertainties about his future orientation and quickly demonstrated that he was capable of making the first move in order to be known. It was at 12 that he took his first steps in front of a camera in the sitcom Annie McGuire, in 1988.\n\nSaturn and Mercury put their two cents\n\nHowever, just by looking at him, anyone can realize that he does not give the impression that he is a pure Aries type. With his gaunt face, his eyes deeply set in their sockets, and his dandy look, he is more marked by other influences, namely those of Mercury and Saturn.\n\nLet us start with the latter, who is tightly linked to the Midheaven in Gemini. Thus, the planet plays the role of a dominant, although it is not totally comfortable. In this youthful sign, Saturn slows down the pace and gives a tendency toward the melancholy proper to adolescence. Brody had problems finding his place in society and was not satisfied with the most dazzling successes. He was looking for profundity and never felt reassured.\n\nThis shyness might be increased by the fact that Brody has the Ascendant in Virgo. Intellectual, he has remarkable analysis capacities and did not consider himself a Hollywood star in the whimsical meaning of the word.\n\nHe was modest and determined to prove himself. In his case, this is even truer because Saturn squares the Ascendant, itself posited in a sign having nothing to do with the self-assurance of the solar sign. Indeed, Aries and Virgo are extremely dissimilar, although sometimes complementary, for Virgo moderates the excesses of the first sign.\n\nLet us underline that the ruler of the Ascendant, Mercury, another emphasized planet, is in Pisces. Mercury too is ill at ease in this untalkative sign, and in addition, he is in opposition to the Moon in Virgo.\n\nIn short, almost all the values of this natal chart are unable to express themselves naturally, without constraint. They always require that Brody adjust to the context.\n\nTherefore, one has to realize that it was difficult for this actor to overcome these inner conflicts, because his profession already implied deep questioning about his identity.\n\nSaturnian agonies\n\nLet us get back for instance to the consequences of The Pianist. This film, directed by Roman Polanski, brought Brody recognition in 2002. He won the Award for Best Actor and became at the same time the youngest comedian to whom this honor was bestowed.\n\nNevertheless, as he himself declared in interviews, the fallout of the filming process and of this success threw him into a year of depression. To impersonate a Polish Jewish musician who survived Nazism in the ghetto of Warsaw, he had to draw on his most intimate resources.\n\nOnce the film was completed, he was drained and exhausted, like after a bereavement, but with a new perception of life. Through his confidences, it is impossible not to recognize the influence of a dominant Saturn.\n\nA major Air triangle supported by Neptune\n\nNo doubt that he managed to exploit his masculinity very positively and openly. He is an anti-machismo par excellence. These two planets, oriented toward the future and progress, succeeded in using Saturn as a foundation and not as an impediment.\n\nThe Jupiter-Mars duet is actually linked to Saturn and to the Midheaven, but also to Uranus by an Air Grand Trine. This involves the 1st, the 5th, and the 10th Houses of the chart, meaning everything related to the personality, at the service of creation (Mars and Jupiter) and of the career (Saturn).\n\nThis auspicious Mars-Jupiter signature, that of entrepreneurs and captains of industry, probably explains the considerable energy of the actor, who has already played in 65 films.\n\nMoreover, Neptune brings the key of the compounded pattern, since he is in the center of this motive known as a kite, which represents a top-quality asset.\n\nThe interpretation of this configuration certainly indicates that the person involved is blessed with communication skills. With Air signs, intellectual adaptation is great.\n\nIn Brody's case, we can observe this in his international career. Not only did he become a safe bet for the American cinema, but he also participated in Chinese films  an epic saga fitting his Saturn  as well as in independent films or in thrillers.\n\nTo sum up, Brody will keep on amazing us, and given his age, he still has a host of beautiful creations in store for us.\n\nAuspicious transits and promising prospects\n\nIn 2019, the planets in Capricorn support his Ascendant and reinforce even more significantly his credibility as an actor, especially because the transits involve the Lunar Nodes and point to a watershed moment on the karmic plane.\n\nFurthermore, he has probably experienced a less hectic personal life since transiting Uranus left Aries and his Sun-Venus conjunction.\n\nYou can also read the Astrotheme astrological portrait of Adrien Brody.\n\nYou will also find below the interactive horoscope of Adrien Brody:\n\nSelect an object to display more information\n\nSelect an object to display more information\n\n* A planet less than 1° from the next House cusp is considered to be posited in the said House. 2° when the AS and the MC are involved"
