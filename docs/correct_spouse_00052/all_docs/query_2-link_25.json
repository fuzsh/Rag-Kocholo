        "text": "Harvey Weinstein's ex wife, Georgina Chapman, has finalised her divorce from the disgraced movie mogul, according to online records.\n\nThe 45-year-old fashion designer split from 69-year-old Weinstein in 2017 and filed for divorce at that time.\n\nThey reportedly reached a settlement a year later and Weinstein agreed to pay her between $15 million and $20 million.\n\nGeorgina has now gone public with her new boyfriend, actor Adrien Brody, appearing with him on the red carpet as they attended a screening of The French Dispatch, during the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nThe pair delighted onlookers by kissing as they walked into the premiere.\n\nPage Six has reported that Weinstein had a prenuptial agreement with Georgina, in which he agreed to pay $300,000 in support for each year of a marriage.\n\nAfter a decade, it is thought that the support increases to $400,000 after a decade.\n\nAs part of their settlement, Georgina reportedly secured the $15million White Village home and $12million Hampton beach house that the coupled owned.\n\nThe pair met at a party and then married in 2007 before having two children together.\n\nGeorgina's romance with Adrien has been blossoming and they pair were spotted with her children in Los Angeles last week.\n\nAdrien, 48, who won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in The Pianist, had wrapped his arm around Georgina, while she held his hand as they walked together.\n\nIronically, it was Weinstein that had introduced Adrien to Georgina, with the actor starring in the producer's Hollywoodland and Jailbreakers.\n\nGeorgina decided to leave Weinstein after the allegations of sexual assault against him came to light in 2017.\n\nIn a statement at the time, Georgina wrote: \"My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.\n\n“I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”\n\nWeinstein was convicted of rape and a criminal sexual act and is currently serving a 23-year prison sentence, which he is appealing and has constantly denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
