        "text": "The 2024 Met Gala was a night filled with fashion, glamor, parties and fun but for some A-list guests there may have also been some ducking and diving behind the Met’s statues to avoid their exes.\n\nOn May 6, celebrities showcased stunning looks in line with this year’s theme, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” and the dress code, “The Garden of Time.” Inside the gala, Met veterans and first-timers alike were treated to drinks, dinner and a performance from Ariana Grande.\n\nGiven that the carpet was filled with just about every famous person you could think of, apart from beloved stars who skipped the Met Gala and those who are allegedly not allowed back, it was almost inevitable that there would be some celebrity exes in the building.\n\nWhile we were treated to many sweet couple moments, date nights and even some red carpet couple debuts, our hearts go out to some of our favorite stars who may have had awkward run-ins with exes.\n\nKendall Jenner definitely got the short end of the stick when she faced two of her exes inside this year’s Met Gala — Ben Simmons and Bad Bunny. Jenner split from Bad Bunny in December 2023 and has recently been seen out and about with another ex, NBA star Devin Booker. But she ended up partying the night with her Puerto Rican rapper ex instead after seemingly avoiding Simmons on the red carpet… talk about messy! But Jenner wasn’t the only one with an ex lover inside the Met Gala….\n\nKeeping scrolling to see all the celebrity exes at the 2024 Met Gala!"
