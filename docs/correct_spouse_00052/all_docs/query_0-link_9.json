        "text": "Publish date: 2024-05-23\n\nAdrien Brody hit the headlines on Saturday after making his red carpet debut with girlfriend Georgina Chapman at the premiere of his new movie Clean in New York.\n\nThe Oscar winner, 48, looked pleased to formally introduce his new partner, 45, who is the ex-wife of convicted sex offender and former film producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAnd while fans turn their attention to the loved-up couple, itâs often forgotten that Adrien was once in a relationship with actress Elsa Pataky â who is now perhaps best known for being the wife of Australian actor Chris Hemsworth.\n\nFinally! Adrien Brody hit the headlines on Saturday after making his red carpet debut with girlfriend Georgina Chapman at the premiere of his new movie Clean in New York. The pair have been dating since at least March 2020\n\nBefore she tied the knot with the Thor heart-throb in 2010, 44-year-old Elsa had dated Adrien from 2006 to 2009.\n\nTheir romance appeared to be pretty solid from the beginning â so solid, in fact, that in October 2008 Adrien surprised Elsa by purchasing and renovating a stone-built castle in New York for the pair to live in.\n\nHe unveiled the mammoth surprise to her on her 31st birthday.\n\nâI blindfolded her. Right at the castle thereâs a giant, beautiful church bell. And I said âWhen you hear the sound of the bell, you can open your eyes and youâll see your surprise.â And then I rang the bell,â he told HELLO! magazine at the time.\n\nPast love: Before she tied the knot with hunky Thor actor Chris Hemsworth, Elsa Pataky, 44, began dating Adrien in 2006\n\nSurprise! In October 2008, Adrien surprised Elsa after purchasing and renovating stone-built castle in New York for the pair to live in â and unveiled the mammoth surprise to her on her 31st birthday. Pictured: The castle prior to renovations\n\nCute: The couple appeared to be going from strength to strength, and were even rumoured to be engaged in 2008 â but sadly, their love story wasnât meant to be\n\nâWhen I saw the castle, I asked Adrien, âIs this ours?ââ the Spanish actress added at the time. âHe said, âYes â welcome home.ââ\n\nThe magazine did a full 35-page spread of their brand new home, complete with a cheesy photo shoot of the pair posing in a forklift outside the property.\n\nThe couple were even rumoured to be engaged in 2008 â but sadly, their love story wasnât meant to be.\n\nThe duo called time on their romance in 2009, yet no official announcement was made from either party.\n\nSplitsville: The duo called time on their relationship in 2009, yet no official announcement was made from either party\n\nJust a year after her romance with Adrien ended, Elsa met Chris through their representatives in 2010. They married in December that year.\n\nThe genetically blessed pair, who live in a $30million mega mansion in Byron Bay, have three children, daughter India Rose, eight, and twin sons Sasha and Tristan, six.\n\nAdrien ended up keeping and renovating the castle himself, and made a documentary about it named Stone Barn Castle in 2015.\n\nThe film follows his efforts fixing up the structure, serving as a metaphor for the pursuit of oneâs dreams.\n\nLove: Just a year after their romance ended, Elsa met Chris Hemsworth (right) through mutual representatives in 2010. The loved-up duo tied the knot the same year during the Christmas holidays\n\nMeanwhile, Georginaâs relationship with Adrien appears to be her first major coupling since she divorced Weinstein in 2018.\n\nAlthough their relationship wasnât confirmed until March 2020, the two were said to have been together âfor a whileâ, People reported at the time.\n\nA source said the pair work well together because they share âmany similar interestsâ.\n\nâShe thinks heâs unusual and interesting,â the source revealed, adding that Georgina was drawn to Adrienâs âdeep passion for his workâ, which reminds her of her own dedication to her fashion label.\n\nThe Pianist star also âdiverts her attention from the pain of her situation [with Weinstein] and subsequent split,â the insider claimed.\n\nOver: Georginaâs divorce from Harvey Weinstein (left) was finalized in January of 2018, and by May the disgraced superproducer had been charged with ârape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate womenâ by the New York District Attorneyâs Office\n\nAdrien had starred in 2006âs Hollywoodland, a film which was co-produced by Weinsteinâs former company Miramax Films.\n\nGeorginaâs divorce from Weinstein was finalised in January of 2018, and by May the disgraced superproducer had been charged with ârape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and sexual misconduct for incidents involving two separate womenâ by the New York District Attorneyâs Office.\n\nHe was convicted in February 2020 of two of the five charges: one count of sexual assault in the first degree and one count of rape in the third degree.\n\nWeinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison the following month.\n\nPast: Adrien had starred in 2006âs Hollywoodland, a film which was co-produced by Weinsteinâs former company Miramax Films\n\nThis post first appeared on Dailymail.co.uk\n\nncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vIp6qinJVirqW%2ByJ6lZpqipLG6v4yfpqufn6nBprqMq6ammZ6Ysm7DyK2fZpuYp7a0eceepKyvn6fBqb%2BMsKCfnV2aubStjKmYrZmbrnw%3D"
