        "text": "Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman are soaking up the sun.\n\nThe loved-up lovebirds were snapped looking tan, happy and relaxed while on vacation in St. Tropez.\n\nOn Wednesday, photographers caught the duo strolling arm-in-arm into Club 55 for lunch after arriving at the elite beachfront club by boat.\n\nThe couple has been enjoying the European getaway with Russian model Natasha Poly, her husband, Peter Bakker, and their two children.\n\nFor the sunny outing, Chapman, 47, sported an off-the-shoulder jungle-print dress, which was cinched at the waist with a thick belt. She dazzled in all-black accessories, including sunglasses, flip-flops and a small purse.\n\nMeanwhile, Brody, 50, kept things casual with a gray T-shirt and matching sandals, which he paired with black shorts and aviator shades.\n\nThey each completed their looks with big smiles.\n\nPage Six confirmed in February 2020 that Chapman, the ex-wife of disgraced movie exec Harvey Weinstein, and Brody, who dated Spanish model Elsa Pataky from 2006 to 2009, were dating after romance rumors first started to swirl the previous fall.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nWhile the fashion designer and the Oscar-winning actor had met and socialized in the past, sparks apparently flew when they both attended Danish model Helena Christensen’s swimwear launch in April 2019.\n\nThough Chapman had sworn off dating following her split from Weinstein, 71 — who is currently in prison for rape — insiders previously told us that Brody wound up becoming a big source of support for her.\n\nThe Marchesa co-founder filed for divorce from the “Pulp Fiction” producer — with whom she shares two kids — in October 2017 after dozens of women came forward to accuse him of decades-long sexual abuse. Their divorce was finalized in July 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Chapman and Brody made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Tribeca Film Festival in June 2021 before attending the Met Gala together three months later."
