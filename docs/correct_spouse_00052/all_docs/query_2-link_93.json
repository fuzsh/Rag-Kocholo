        "text": "MOVIE REVIEW\n\n“CLEAN”\n\nNot rated. On VOD.\n\nGrade: B\n\nIn the dark, crime fantasy “Clean,” Academy Award-winner Adrien Brody plays the title role, a trash collector who gleans things he finds on his route: an old Electrolux vacuum, a bicycle frame, bits and pieces. He renovates the vacuum and sells it to his friend (Rza) at his friend’s pawn shop. Clean drives a souped-up 1980s two-door sedan when he isn’t piloting his dinosaur-like garbage truck through the nighttime streets of a wintry American city (the film was shot in snow-dusted Utica, N.Y.).\n\nClean has a long black beard, tattoos and a hipster hair cut. He lives alone in what looks like a machine shop. He hangs out at a junkyard, where he feeds the big resident dog. He has dreams about a little Black girl for whom he expresses paternal love, his daughter, we assume. Clean makes lunches for Dianda (Chandler DuPont), a young Black girl who lives with her grandmother Ethel (Tony nominee Michelle Wilson) in a neighborhood full of abandoned houses, which Clean paints to keep them looking decent. Clean gives the newly painted bike frame with new parts to Dianda to ride to school.\n\nAlong Clean’s route is a fish shop owned by the drug-dealing gangster Michael (Glenn Fleshler), who kills a Chinese dealer who steals from him by hitting the man in the head with a hammer savagely in broad daylight and then stashing the body in boxes and putting them out for Clean to collect. The gangster is a monstrous brute who despises his young, ex-convict son Mikey (Richie Merritt) for preferring the company and culture of his Black friends to that of his horrible father.\n\nWhen Clean, who has a dark, violent past, seriously injures Mikey protecting Dianda from rape, Michael sends his thugs to kill him, Dianda and Ethel. Will Clean, Dianda and Ethel be able to evade Michael’s army? Or will the army of criminal trolls Michael sends regret taking on Clean?\n\nIn addition to the obvious white savior story line, “Clean,” which was co-written and produced by Brody, can be overwrought and over-the-top. But director and co-writer Paul Solet (TV’s “Mars”) has a flair for violence, and he obviously recognizes the brutalist beauty, machine-age grace and musical appeal of garbage trucks. These dangerous, squealing beasts that roam our streets are part of the life blood of any city. Brody gives the role his all, and the rest of the cast is also well above average.\n\n“Clean” has obvious ties to Martin Scorsese’s similarly four-wheeled classic “Taxi Driver.” Clean even observes Travis Bickle-like in a voice-over that the world is drowning in “a sea of filth.” “Clean” also resembles the 2017 effort “You Were Never Really Here” with a hammer-wielding Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nOutside of his barber buddy (Mykelti Williamson), Clean’s only social interactions are AA meetings, where the other attendees give testimony. Clean’s weapon of choice is a very big adjustable wrench. But a customized pump-action shotgun will also do the trick. The “John Wick”-style gruesome and gory fight scenes featuring dozens of bodies will appeal to fans of the body-count genre.\n\nIs Clean a Travis Bickle for these rage-filled times? Not quite. But he’ll do in a pinch.\n\n(“Clean” contains extreme violence and profanity.)"
