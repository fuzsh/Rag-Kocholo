        "text": "Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip\n\nA then 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth of England first met 18-year-old Prine Philip of Greece at the Britannia Royal Naval College in 1939. The two were said to have thought little of anyone else from that moment, exchanging letters throughout the war years.\n\nTheir relationship blossomed upon Philip’s return in 1946, and he proposed that June at Balmoral.\n\nIn June 1947, Prince Philip was naturalised and took the last name Mountbatten, later renouncing his right to the Greek and Danish thrones. He and Elizabeth wed in November that year, enjoying a few short years together before she ascended the throne unexpectedly early in 1952.\n\n“He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,” the Queen said at their Golden Wedding anniversary in 1997.\n\n“I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.”\n\nPrincess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\n\nOn Jan. 22, 2018, it was announced that Princess Eugenie, the younger daughter of Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew, is engaged to Jack Brooksbank, her long-time boyfriend.\n\nThe couple actually met during a ski trip in Verbier, Switzerland, seven years ago, and in a televised interview Eugenie said it was “love at first sight.” “We met when I was 20, he was 24,” she explained. “[We] fell in love. We have the same passions and drive for life.” The couple got engaged in Nicaragua, and wedded later in 2018 at St George’s Chapel in Windsor—the same chapel where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are getting married.\n\nThey recently revealed that they were expecting their first child together.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton of England\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met as university students in 2001—they were both residents at St. Salvator’s Hall at the University of St. Andrews and reportedly started dating in 2003.\n\nHowever, biographer Katie Nicholl opposed this story, and said in 2013 one of Kate’s friends from Marlborough College said, “Uh-uh, she didn’t meet him at St. Andrews. She met him before she got there, while she was at school during her sixth form, through some friends. They knew Prince William and Prince Harry, so there wasn’t any meeting [at school].” They married on April 29, 2011, and are parents to three young children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nCrown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark\n\nHobart-raised Mary Donaldson was working at an advertising agency in Sydney when she met Prince Frederik at the Slip Inn on Sussex Street in 2000—he was here for the Olympic Games.\n\nThey conducted a long-distance relationship, with Prince Frederik making a few sneaky trips to Sydney, and came out publically as a couple when a Danish weekly magazine called Mary Frederik’s girlfriend in November 2001. Mary made the big move to Denmark in December that year. They got married on May 14, 2004, and have four children: Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, and twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain\n\nKing Felipe’s decision to marry Queen Letizia in May 2004 was controversial because she was—gasp—a divorced commoner. This didn’t sit very well with the traditional Catholics in Spain. Before she became a royal, Queen Letizia worked as a journalist and news anchor, and met her future husband while on assignment in November 2002, covering a story about an oil spillage in northern Spain.\n\nWhile some reports say she actually interviewed him, the story is the prince was there offering his support, and that’s when they started their romance. And other reports suggest they had met previously at a dinner party. The royal couple has two daughters together: Princess Leonor and Princess Sofía.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\n\nWhen [their romance](https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-relationship-timeline-5459) was just a few months old, it was originally reported that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had met in Toronto, where the prince was promoting the Invictus Games, and where the actress filmed *Suits* for seven years.\n\nNow married with a son, Archie, the couple confirmed that they actually met through a mutual friend in London in July 2016—and while they didn’t divulge their matchmaking friend’s identity during their [first joint interview](https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/prince-harry-meghan-markle-relationship-rumours-interview-15184), people have deduced that it was [fashion designer Misha Nonoo](https://www.elle.com.au/celebrity/prince-harry-meghan-markle-introduced-mutual-friend-misha-nonoo-15187).\n\nKing Abdullah II and Queen Rania of Jordan\n\nThis royal couple is one of the most openly affectionate in the world. They have been married for 23 years, and on their 22nd wedding anniversary Queen Rania shared an Instagram photo—yes, she’s on Instagram!—that said, “22 years on and my heart still skips a beat. So blessed to be at your side. Happy anniversary, Your Majesty #Wedding #Anniversary #Love.” They met at a dinner party thrown by His Majesty’s sister in January 1993 and have four children together: Crown Prince Hussein, Princess Iman, Princess Salma and Prince Hashem.\n\nPrince Joachim and Princess Marie of Denmark\n\nPrince Joachim, the younger brother of Crown Prince Frederik, was previously married to Alexandra, Countess of Frederiksborg, with whom he has two sons. They divorced in April 2005. Prince Joachim is now married to Princess Marie, whom he wed in May 2008.\n\nHe revealed how they met in an interview with Hello! in February 2016, saying, “It was pure coincidence that we met. I was married at the time. But because we happened to be the only two French-speaking people at the dinner, our host seated us next to each other. And as Marie had never been to Denmark it was fun to talk to her. Our romance, however, started much later.” Prince Joachim and Princess Marie also have two children together.\n\nJigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and Jetsun Pema of Bhutan\n\nKhesar, also known as the “Dragon King,” is the current reigning King of Bhutan, and he’s married to Queen Jetsun. Despite their 10-year age gap—at 26, Queen Jetsun is the youngest queen in the world—the Dragon King said of his bride, “Now, many will have their own idea of what a Queen should be like—that she should be uniquely beautiful, intelligent and graceful. I think with experience and time, one can grow into a dynamic person in any walk of life with the right effort. For the Queen, what is most important is that at all times, as an individual she must be a good human being, and as Queen, she must be unwavering in her commitment to serve the People and Country.\n\n“As my queen, I have found such a person and her name is Jetsun Pema. While she is young, she is warm and kind in heart and character. These qualities together with the wisdom that will come with age and experience will make her a great servant to the nation.”\n\nThey reportedly met for the first time at a family picnic in Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, when she was seven and he was 17. They were together for three years before the King proposed. They now have one son, who was born in February 2016."
