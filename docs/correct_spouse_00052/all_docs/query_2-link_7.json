        "text": "Brody and Chapman's relationship was first confirmed in February by People magazine.\n\nChapman's relationship with Brody marks her first public romance since splitting with Harvey Weinstein in 2017 after he was accused of sexual assault by multiple women, including prominent actresses. Weinstein was convicted twice, with a jury finding him guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree and rape in the third degree.\n\nThe designer married Weinstein in 2007 and the pair have two children. Their divorce was settled in 2018, with Weinstein agreeing to a reported US$19 million to $27m payout. Chapman also received primary custody of the children.\n\nAt the time of the split, she released a statement that read, \"My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions. I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.\"\n\nChapman spoke out for the first time since her divorce in an interview with Vogue, saying, \"There was a part of me that was terribly naive â€“ clearly, so naive.\n\n\"I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief! And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them? It's like, they love their dad. They love him.\"\n\nShe also told the interviewer that she was never suspicious about her ex-husband's behaviour.\n\nSince the scandal, Chapman has received support from global stars such as Scarlett Johansson and Cindy Crawford.\n\nHarvey Weinstein is set to be extradited from New York to Los Angeles to face more charges."
