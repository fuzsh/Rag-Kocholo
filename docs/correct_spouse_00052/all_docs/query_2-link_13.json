        "text": "Peaky Blinders star Adrien Brody is reportedly dating the British ex-wife of convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein .\n\nAs the disgraced movie mogul faces up to 29 years behind bars, fashion designer Georgina Chapman has found solace in the arms of the Oscar winner who starred in her former husband's films.\n\nThe couple had previously met but got together after they were both invited to Puerto Rico for the launch of model Helena Christensen's swimwear line last April.\n\nPictures from the event at the luxury Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve emerged showing the pair sat opposite each over a candlelight dinner with friends.\n\nThey have since been out several times in New York.\n\nChapman, the mother of Weinstein's two youngest children, had sworn off romance after her divorce from the multimillionaire filmmaker.\n\nBut according to reports in America, Brody, 46, is said to have been a source of comfort to London-born Georgina following the collapse of her marriage.\n\nThe 43-year-old mum-of-two began dating the actor two years after divorcing the now-convicted sex pest.\n\nShe left Weinstein, who she had married in 2007, three years ago after dozens of women came forward claiming he had sexually abused them.\n\nBrody previously starred in two films made by Weinstein's Miramax productions, Jailbreakers and Hollywoodland.\n\nThe two men were pictured together at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFollowing the accusations against Weinstein, Georgina said: \"My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.\n\n\"I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority, and I ask the media for privacy at this time.\"\n\nWeinstein previously said he \"encouraged\" Georgina leave him.\n\n\"Over the last week, there has been a lot of pain for my family that I take responsibility for,\" he said after she confirmed their marriage was over.\n\nLast week Weinstein was found guilty of rape in the third degree and criminal sexual assault in the first degree.\n\nHe now faces up to 29 years in prison when he is sentenced on March 11."
