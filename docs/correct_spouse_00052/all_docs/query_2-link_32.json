        "text": "DISGRACED movie mogul Harvey Weinstein’s British ex-wife has found love with another Hollywood star - Oscar winner Adrien Brody.\n\nDesigner Georgina Chapman is dating the acclaimed actor - and Weinstein’s former friend - after being set-up by supermodel Helena Christensen, the Sun on Sunday can reveal.\n\nTwo years after announcing she was divorcing the 67-year-old producer - who has been accused of harassment and assault by over 80 women - the mum-of-two has found happiness.\n\nNews of her relationship comes on the eve of Weinstein’s controversial trial.\n\nA friend said: “Georgina and Adrien obviously initially met through Harvey, but met again properly in April.\n\n“Helena had invited them both to her swimwear launch in Puerto Rico, and they bonded over cocktails against a backdrop of various beautiful beaches.\n\n“They stayed in touch when Georgina returned to London, and then arranged to go on a few low-key dates.\n\n“Obviously it’s still quite a new thing, but Adrien is smitten and Georgina is the happiest she’s been in ages.\n\n“She has had a torrid past couple of years, and finally feels ready to move on with her life. Her kids and family are all aware, and everyone whole-heartedly approves.”\n\nAmerican actor Brody, 46, came to fame in the Academy Award-winning The Pianist in 2002.\n\nLast year he starred in hit BBC series, Peaky Blinders.\n\nWeinstein, who has two kids, India, seven, and Dashiell, five, with the Marchesa founder, has already been charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault, one count of criminal sexual act in the first degree, one count of first-degree rape and one count of third-degree rape.\n\nHe stands trial in January after his initial court dates this month were pushed back following revised charges of predatory sexual assault.\n\nIn October 2017 allegations first emerged against the Oscar-winning director - the start of the #MeToo movement.\n\nStars including Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGovern, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Eva Green and Ashley Judd have all spoken out against the tycoon.\n\nThe Kill Bill producer has always insisted all his sexual relationships were consensual.\n\nLast year Georgina, 43, who was married to Harvey for 10 years, spoke about her shame at his fall from grace.\n\nShe told Vogue: “There was a part of me that was terribly naive - clearly, so naive.\n\n“I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief.”\n\nA spokesman for Georgina declined to comment."
