Though Adrien pledged absolute commitment to Michelle, an affair with British actress on location possibly caused the couple to drift apart.\n\nKeira Knightley (2005) â Adrien and Kiera co-starred in The Jacket (2005) and fell for each other on the sets while filming the movie in Scotland.

Spellbound by her beauty, Adrien asked Elsa if she would show him around Spain when he visited her home country to film Manolete (2008), a forthcoming project he was signed to appear in the lead. A lunch date in Spain eventually progressed into a relationship and the couple even got engaged. Adrien purchased the Stone Barn Castle as a birthday surprise for Elsa hoping to make it their permanent residence after marriage.

Not yet willing to settle down, she broke up with Adrien to date French actor, Olivier Martinez.\n\nJanuary Jones (2010) â Next, Adrien started dating Mad Men actress, January Jones in early 2010 but tried really hard to maintain a low profile. By June 2010, the paparazzi often spotted January leaving Adrienâs home late at night and their hunch about their budding romance was further confirmed by Adrienâs friends. The couple confirmed their relationship status in July 2010 but broke up soon after due to undisclosed reasons.\n\nPaige Hathaway (2011) â Adrien briefly dated Paige Hathaway before she discovered weight training and blew up on social media as the present day fitness model.\n\nJennifer Aniston (2011) â Tabloids reported that Jennifer Aniston had a brief affair with Adrien Brody before she moved on with actor Justin Theroux.\n\nLara Lieto (2012â2018) â Adrien was introduced to Russian Model, Lara by a mutual friend at the Cannes Film Festival and they became an inseparable couple. Lara whose real name is Larisa Tyaka was born in Moscow to a Moldavian father and Ossetian mother. She moved to Monaco to pursue a career in modeling. Owing to her relationship with Adrien, Lara relocated to the United States of America and since 2012, her appearance has undergone many changes, the most noticeable being the abnormal thickness of her lips due to lip fillers.

He ate the following meals to drop down to 130 lbs of body weight.\n\nBreakfast â Two boiled eggs with a cup of green tea\n\nLunch â A small portion of chicken\n\nDinner â Steamed vegetables with a small piece of fish / chicken\n\nContrarily, to play the role of Royce in Predators (2010), Adrien gained 25 pounds of muscle (11.5 kg) while retaining 6% body fat which is the heaviest or the biggest size, the actor has ever been.\n\nDuring the initial period, the actor took help of two strength coaches to list supplements that aid the anabolic process and create a training program, he could follow on his own.\n\nTo get jacked, the actor gave up having sugar / desserts, alcohol, and sex.\n\nWhile filming, Adrien trained at an MMA gym called BJ Pennâs in Hilo, Hawaii.\n\nHe performed weight training first thing in the morning, spent the day filming the movie and ended the routine with a swim in the ocean.\n\nSince Adrien had no time to bulk-up and went straight to get the shredded appearance, he performed hundreds of push-ups a day (apart from his morning workout) to look pumped in every scene.\n\nAs expected, the actor did not live in a hotel throughout filming. He lived in isolation on a private estate adjoining the shooting location of the tropical rainforest and spent his nights going through survival manuals, military & meditation books and Sun Tzuâs The Art of War.\n\nOnce filming for Predators wrapped, Adrien visited India, fell ill and lost 7 kg of that hard earned muscle.\n\nIn his everyday life, the actor likes to run, hike, do yoga, and focus more on his flexibility, supplemented with occasional sets of push-ups for strength.\n\nHe switches between a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian diet after a period of time and claims to eat a lot despite his lean appearance.\n\nHe usually does not hire a personal trainer or a nutritionist and lives by common sense and instinct to stay fit.\n\nIn 2013, Adrien trained under the supervision of former marine turned celebrity personal trainer, Aaron Williamson and in 2016, through an Instagram post, Adrien implied their association was still strong.\n\nAdrien Brody Favorite Things\n\nClothing Brands â Gucci, Armani, Nike\n\nClothing â Bonds Grey Hoodie, Dolce and Gabbana motorcycle jacket\n\nShoes â Steve Madden Black combat boots\n\nCap â King Kong Baseball cap\n\nMovie â The Godfather (1972)\n\nGenre of Music â Hip hop\n\nSource â NY Post, NY Times, MTV, Google Books\n\nAdrien Brody Facts\n\nHis childhood aspiration was to become a magician. Inspired by the American-Hungarian illusionist, Harry Houdini, Adrien performed at various childrenâs birthday parties as The Amazing Adrien when he was about 11 years old.\n\nInspired by hip-hop music, the actor briefly took up B-boying in his teens.\n\nHe grew up in a working-class neighborhood which witnessed a lot of gang violence. Adrienâs mother made him join acting classes to keep him out of trouble.\n\nIn his late teens, Adrien often got into local drag racing and used to buy and repair muscle cars such as Mustang Mach 1, Dodge Charger, and Dodge Challenger to sell them at a profit.\n\nAfter a few years, he developed a fascination for vintage cars. Some of his prized possessions include a Z06 Corvette and a mist-green â55 Cadillac.\n\nAdrien shared that he became comfortable in front of the camera at a very early age since he was a frequent subject of his motherâs photography and often accompanied her to designated professional assignments in the field.\n\nAdrien was furious when he broke his nose for the third time on the sets of Summer of Sam (1999) which is the main cause of his big, elongated nose. Although he got it functionally fixed, he refused to opt for cosmetic surgery to reduce the size back to normal.\n\nThe actor is not prone to feeling emotionally low and hence, was surprised to experience depression for nearly a year after wrapping up The Pianist.\n\nHe is an avid painter and frequently puts up an exhibition of his artwork. Adrien is particularly drawn towards marine themes to create contemporary, modern art.\n\nAdrien was in his NYC home during the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre in 2001. As soon as he heard the news on TV, he rushed to the location to inspect the gravity of the disaster with his mother and her assistant and captured the tragedy on camera.\n\nHe is a close friend of Italian actress Asia Argento and Puerto Rican actor Benicio Del Toro.\n\nEsquire Magazine labeled him as the Best Dressed Man in America in 2004.\n\nHe was featured in a music video of A Sorta Fairytale (2002) by Tori Amos.\n\nAdrien and Marion Cotillard are the only actors who have won an Oscar and a CÃ©sar for the same performance.\n\nHe was very keen on performing the role of the Joker in Dark Knight (2008) that he lost to Heath Ledger and the role of Spock in Star Trek XI (2009) which eventually went to Zachary Quinto.\n\nHe got his first expensive watch, a gold Bulgari Rettangolo, for the Oscar event in 2003.\n\nThe actor took Halle Berry by surprise when he grabbed her in a back-bending embrace and kissed her after she announced him as the Academy Award Winner (2003) in the Best Actor category. Adrien admitted that stunt marked by the triumph was inspired by a picture of his parents locked in a similar embrace.\n\nIn 2003, Adrien was a first-time Oscar nominee pitted against four former Oscar winners. He is the only actor to have won an award in such a situation.\n\nIn 2003, he had hosted the Saturday Night Live (SNL) episode but he was banned after he went off-script which was not liked by the creator of SNL, Lorne Michaels.\n\nFeatured Image by Georges Biard / Wikimedia / CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqbq6GVo3qjvs6dsGg%3D\n\n← Previous Post\n\nNext Post →"
