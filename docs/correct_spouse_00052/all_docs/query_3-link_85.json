        "text": "By Bill Davis\n\nValues-based investing has been around for hundreds of years and long before the terminology surrounding this practice got confused by labels such as socially-responsible investing (SRI) and environmental, social, governance investing (ESG). At its core the idea is a good one: use capital to support ethical preferences of investors whether these be based on faith, worker-rights, the environment, or something else entirely. The challenge has always been to do so without under-performing the market in the process, and historically speaking, practitioners often failed to generate competitive financial returns. As a result, financial advisors just as often advised against values-based investing and the overall movement struggled to become mainstream.\n\nTo put a finer point on this: under-performance led to mis-alignment with advisors, which led to capped interest, which stagnated the industry. It’s that simple.\n\nBut as the saying goes, that was then and this is now. Environmental damage, poor governance, and geo-political risks, to name a few, are also portfolio risks, just not ones captured by traditional approaches to portfolio construction. Companies that aren’t good stewards of the environment, the communities within which they operate, and their employees are a threat to portfolio returns. And since more and more companies file annual corporate sustainability reports that detail their progress toward material ESG risk factors, a new generation of portfolio managers has emerged armed with actionable data and a growing demographic of investors seeking values-based investing.\n\nWith proper portfolio construction, portfolio managers can now mitigate off balance sheet risks and at the same time perform at or better than their benchmarks. In other words, practiced properly, values alignment is free. There’s only one problem…just at the very moment that portfolio managers have proven that values-alignment is essentially free, and more and more investors – be they institutions, family offices, individuals, etc, - are actually looking for product in this area, the financial advisor community is mostly stuck in the 20th century, equating values-aligned investing with poor performance.\n\nIt stands to reason that many financial advisors have the same concerns as their clients as it relates to the world their children and grandchildren will inherit, so on many levels there is complete alignment. So why are financial advisors a roadblock in this movement? A former work colleague of mine referred to this problem as one of “unlearning the alphabet”. Financial advisors grew up in the age of underperformance, assume nothing has changed, and that has become the lens through which they view the industry. In reality, almost everything has changed except their view of things.\n\nConsider that there are 80 million Millennials that are due to inherit up to $30 trillion of wealth over the next ten years. And given they care a lot more about social justice and the environment than their parents, financial advisors might consider that in order to retain these clients they will need to start incorporating values-aligned strategies into their portfolios.\n\nSo for investors that care about aligning capital with values, start demanding viable product from your advisors; and for financial advisors, it’s time to unlearn the alphabet of the past and catch up to a new way of looking at portfolio risk that will help keep and even attract new clients.\n\nBy Jurriaan Kamp, President & Editor in Chief of the Optimist Daily\n\nGas is the future. That may sound counterintuitive in an emerging world of renewable energy where new solar power records are set on a monthly basis. However, for Joost Wouters, Dutch engineer and entrepreneur at Inrada Group, there’s no doubt: in the future, we will continue to use gas-fired stoves to cook our meals and warm our homes with gas-burning heating systems. Gas? Yes, biogas from seaweed.\n\nIt’s a sad fact that—at a moment when renewable clean energy is rising fast—a final surge of fossil fuel exploration mostly through fracking is causing immense environmental degradation and pollution around the planet. The International Energy Agency (IEA) recently projected that oil production through fracking will cover 80 percent of new global demand for oil in the next three years. Most of that new oil production will come from the U.S. where fracking has increased from 23,000 wells producing some 100,000 barrels per day in 2000 to more than 300,000 wells producing over 4 million barrels per day in 2015. Today, more than 50 percent of the U.S. oil production comes from fracking.\n\nIn the past years, the Inrada Group ran several experiments in different parts of the world and created a very compelling business case to replace fracking in the short term and all oil and gas exploration with biogas from seaweed. Joost Wouters: “Seaweed is produced by nature. You don’t have to pay for the CO2. You don’t have to pay for the sunshine nor for the salt water.” He runs the numbers based on recent tests off the coast of Cape Town in South Africa: one hectare of seaweeds produces—in multiple annual production cycles—as much as 800 tons biomass per year. That biomass can be converted into 160,000 cubic meters of biogas per year or 120,000 cubic meters of methane per year. A successful shale gas field in the U.S. has an output of some 50 million cubic meters per year. Wouters: “That means that approximately 450 hectares of seaweed plantations replace the production of a shale gas field.”\n\nCost comparison calculations by Inrada—confirmed by Shell and Accenture—show that seaweed biogas outperforms shale gas by up to a factor 4. Shale gas can only be competitive at around 50 dollars per barrel. Seaweed gas can be produced for 12 to 15 dollars a barrel. Wouters explains the productivity of seaweed referring to the three-dimensional environment of the plantations. The seaweed grows at depths of up to three-meters, unaffected by gravity. That allows for a volume and a speed of conversion of solar energy that are impossible to achieve in farming in a two-dimensional environment on land. In addition, water is 784 times denser than air and supplies a multiple of nutrients.\n\nInrada has developed modular semi-submersed structures to grow seaweed. Seaweed spores are collected on ropes. The ropes are attached to the structures. At the time of harvest, the ropes are pulled through a harvesting machine that cuts off the seaweed. The biomass is subsequently fed into a digester. The seaweed digester is a key innovation by Inrada. Because of its biological composition, traditional biomass digesters don’t work well with seaweed, according to Wouters.\n\nFracking comes at a high price. In 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that between 250 to 500 billion liters of water were used to fracture 35,000 wells. Today, that precious, fresh water use would be 10-fold—in the U.S. only. Oil companies add chemicals to the water to facilitate the fracking process. They say that the concentration of chemicals in the frack fluid is low: only two percent. However, two percent of 2,5 trillion liters is still 50 billion liters of poisonous chemicals seeping into groundwater supplies and endangering public health.\n\nWhereas we have become used to the fact that most industrial processes have “hidden costs” for the environment and public health, Wouters points out that seaweed production comes with “hidden benefits”. “Fracking spills water and destroys the environment. By contrast, seaweed produces drinking water and regenerates the environment, says Wouters”. Inrada began the tests in South Africa in “dead sea water where you couldn’t see anything alive after an intensive fish farm had exhausted the marine environment”. As the seaweed began growing, fish and shells started to come back. Wouters: “Pollution is creating acidity in the oceans and that threatens marine life. Seaweed alkalinizes the water again.” In addition: each hectare of seaweed delivers 680,000 liters of fresh—not salt—water while the growth process sequesters CO2.\n\nThere’s more. After digestion, the seaweed residue is an ideal fertilizer. In fact, countries used to farm seaweed as a fertilizer prior to the invention of chemical fertilizers about a century ago. Today, many countries import natural gas to produce fertilizer. The seaweed biomass also provides a great source for animal feed: seaweed can replace the soy plantations that have depleted vast areas of agricultural soils for our growing meat consumption.\n\nWouters’ list of seaweed benefits keeps growing: nearly all processed and frozen foods around the world include seaweed extracts to maintain softness and texture. Seaweed extracts such as agar-agar and carrageenan are key ingredients of products like toothpaste, ice cream, and cosmetic creams and lotions. Seaweed can also provide fibers for the textile industry. In the 1940s British scientists already discovered that fibers from seaweeds could be used as non-toxic, non-irritating, biodegradable woven material to treat wounds. Seaweed-based gauze has an anti-inflammatory capacity as well while it maintains a certain degree of humidity which supports wound healing.\n\nThere’s one ultimate factor that makes the seaweed biogas case extremely compelling: the infrastructure already exists. The clean energy provided by wind and solar requires big infrastructural investments. Seaweed biogas, however, can be fed into existing pipeline networks that run across the globe connecting factories and homes to a secure energy supply. That’s why Wouters says: “gas is the future”. Granted, we need to build the floating platforms to grow the seaweed, but—at a price of $25,000 per hectare—that is hardly a prohibitive investment compared to the millions of dollars needed to explore a fracking well. The digester requires an additional investment. Wouters envisages using depleted oil or gas rigs to host digesters offshore and prevent the shipment of heavy biomass. The rigs already have pipelines that bring their production to land.\n\nThe seaweed revolution is “brewing”. Wouters: “I hear myself talking, it is almost too good to be true. But it’s reality that as long as the sun shines and there is water in the oceans, seaweed provides an unending supply of clean, renewable energy with many additional benefits.”\n\nAbout the Author: About the author: Jurriaan is the President & Editor in Chief of The Intelligent Optimist (formerly Ode Magazine), a media company focused on presenting solutions to problems the planet and humanity face.

And in an investing landscape where every trader has cheap access to core financial data, a trader with access to a unique dataset that is not widely available to the public can act on this powerful information to generate alpha. These alpha-generating undiscovered data assets are called alternative data - and they’re one of the fastest growing data sources on Wall Street. Hundreds of firms and hedge funds are incorporating alternative datasets into their models in order to derive profit-generating insights\n\nDatasets comprised of satellite imagery, geo-location data, and social media data are just a few of a vast number of alternative data sources that have yet to undergo widespread adoption by the investment community. For example, when JCPenney announced better than expected earnings for Q2 2015, most investors were taken by surprise. A few hedge funds, however, were not surprised due to an obscure dataset of satellite imagery provided by RS metrics, which showed an increase in foot traffic in JCPenney parking lots.\n\nThe hedge funds were able to make a 10% profit in two days all thanks to their access to an alternative dataset.\n\nUnlike RS metrics’ satellite imagery data, ESG data is available at no cost to anyone with a Bloomberg terminal.\n\nThe growing dataset of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data is one of these alternative methods that fund managers are turning towards in an effort to generate alpha for investors. Multiple studies have verified that in the long run, companies with sustainable business practices generate higher returns with lower volatility compared to the market as a whole.\n\nThe “E” of ESG represents the ‘Environmental’ impact of a company including its carbon emissions, natural capital, renewable energy, and water stress.\n\nNext, the “S” stands for ‘Social’ and pertains to the data surrounding human capital, labor standards, privacy and data security, and stakeholder opposition.\n\nAnd finally, the “G” is short for ‘Governance’, taking into account data about the board, pay, corruption, and business ethics and fraud.\n\nRecent scandals such as Volkswagen’s violation of the Clean Air Act, Facebook’s data privacy issues with the Cambridge Analytica breach, and Wells Fargo’s account fraud are examples of how Environmental, Social and Governance can present themselves as portfolio risk, respectively. The Volkswagen emissions and cheating scandal, for example, resulted in the stock shedding nearly a quarter of its value.\n\nWhy has ESG just recently become a consideration in portfolio construction?\n\nThe emergence of quality ESG data sources is largely responsible for facilitating the increased adoption of this alternative data asset. The percentage of corporations in the S&P 500 publishing sustainability reports has risen from just under 20% in 2011 to 85% in 2017. Similarly, across the Atlantic the European Union has mandated companies with over 500 employees to report certain ESG data."
