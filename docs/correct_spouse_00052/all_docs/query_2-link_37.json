        "text": "Cillian Murphy as Tommy Shelby, Season 1-\n\nCillian Murphy is best known for his roles in 28 Days Later, The Dark Knight trilogy and Inception, but is also a talented musician, having previously been in bands and written many songs. He plays the main character of Tommy Shelby in the show - head of the Shelby crime family and recently-appointed Labour MP for Birmingham.\n\nOf his role on the show, Cillian said: \"I'm not a tough guy at all so it was by far the toughest character I have ever portrayed, and him being so physical and the amount of respect and fear that this family has in this town means that we all had to look tough. I've been a fan of Steven Knight's work for quite a while and the quality just jumped off the page. It's just very unusual and very compelling and the character Tom Shelby is kind of an enigma.\"\n\nHelen McCrory as Polly Gray, Season 1-\n\nHelen McCrory was a prolific actress, having worked for many years in film, TV and on-stage, who heartbreakingly passed away in April 2021. Having played Tony Blair's wife Cherie twice, she was also known for playing Narcissa Malfoy in the last three Harry Potter films, for her role in Skyfall and a plethora of theatre roles, among many others. Helen played Aunt Polly in Peaky Blinders, the matriarch of the family. It's unknown whether she will be a part of the final season.\n\nOf the role, Helen said: \"I play Aunt Polly who has run this gang for four years while the boys are away in the trenches. You come to the family when they come back. We know she's had a past life of a man and children and in the series we find out who they are.\n\n\"But she really is the brains with Tommy behind the family and you see the difference of how to rule. One from a male point of view, which is much more physical and violent and threatening, and one from a female point of view, which is just as physically violent and threatening, but is also psychological.\"\n\nHelen will be missed by all who knew her and her Peaky Blinders family and fans.\n\nPaul Anderson as Arthur Shelby Jr, Season 1-\n\nPaul Anderson plays Arthur Shelby Jr. on the show, the eldest Shelby son. Having starred in The Revenant and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, Paul is no stranger to a gritty drama.\n\nHe said: \"They're the most interesting roles to play: violent, brutal, dark characters. There's so much scope because you can do the obvious brutish kind of stuff, but then you can play the sort of different layers with a violent man.\n\n\"There's a reason for that sort of behaviour and mentality. Men were hard men and if they weren't then they were left behind. It was a pleasure to play Arthur Shelby. Much better than playing the nice guy.\"\n\nSophie Rundle as Ada Thorne, Season 1-\n\nSophie Rundle portrays the only sister among the Shelby family - Ada, who secretly married Tommy's wartime friend, Freddie Thorne. Although Freddie passed away early on in the series, Ada has grown hugely as a character. Sophie is best known for her roles in The Bletchley Circle, Episodes and Bodyguard.\n\nShe said: \"She's the sister of the Peaky Blinder boys and as much as all the boys are these sort of wild, vicious, ruthless characters, she's a real sort of feral wild child but, because she's a girl in that time she sort of channels her energy quite differently.\n\n\"Everything that you imagine about the 20s, the flapper girls and the bright young things, Ada kind of embodies a lot of that. She's part of this new generation with all this energy that's looking for a change after the First World War. So she's sort of wild and bright and full of energy.\"\n\nNatasha O'Keeffe as Lizzie Stark, Season 1-\n\nNatasha O'Keeffe portrays Lizzie Stark on the show, Tommy's on-off lover and mother of his child Ruby. Best known for her roles in Misfits, Lip Service and Jekyll and Hyde, she also had a main role in the 2016 Christmas special of Sherlock as Emelia Ricoletti.\n\nShe said: \"It's always lovely to step on in character, in your full costume and become part of that Peaky world. Particularly for Lizzie, when she's in the office, you can feel her stationery and flick through her personal papers.\n\n\"Even those things, when you read the papers, the designers and props team have thought of every detail. The numbers in the books are all relevant to what Lizzie does. I'm blown away by the attention to detail.\"\n\nAimée-Ffion Edwards as Esme Shelby, Season 1-4\n\nSkins fans will recognise Esme Shelby's Aimée-Ffion Edwards as Lucy AKA Sketch, who was a character in the first generation and had an obsession with character Maxxie. Other than Skins, she has starred in Being Human, Luther and Wolf Hall, as well as Death In Paradise and Thunderbirds Are Go.\n\nEsme is a daughter in the Lee Gypsy family, who is married to John Shelby by way of a truce and to start a deal between the two families. When John is killed by the Changretta family, Esme takes her and John's children and leaves Birmingham, and hasn't been seen on the show since. However - the actress has been spotted on the set of season 6, so it's highly likely we will see Esme and her children in the upcoming season!\n\nTom Hardy as Alfie Solomons, Season 2-\n\nTom Hardy joined the cast in series two as Alfie Solomons, the leader of a Jewish gang based in Camden Town, London. Although they have their differences and are often on opposing sides, Alfie and Tommy are close friends. Unfortunately, at the end of series four, Alfie revealed to Tommy that he had cancer and persuaded Tommy to kill him so he wouldn't suffer any longer. In a huge twist, Alfie returned in the fifth season, having survived the gunshot AND recovered from the illness.\n\nIn November 2021, the return of Alfie was teased as a clip of Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) telling his old rival: \"I think I may have written your final act\", was circulated online.\n\nKate Phillips as Linda Shelby, Season 3-\n\nKate Phillips joined the cast of Peaky Blinders in series three as the devout Christian wife of Arthur, who is always trying to influence him to be a better man. Kate is best known for her role in Wolf Hall as Jane Seymour, and also for her roles in War & Peace, The Crown and My Mother and Other Strangers. She also appeared in the Downton Abbey film as Princess Mary.\n\nOf Linda's new approach to crime in series four, Kate said: \"Linda has had to re-evaluate her tactics. No matter how much she tries to reform Arthur, she must realise that she has to adapt if she wants to keep him. As much as she'd like to resist, she needs to follow Tommy's lead in order to stay alive. In the end she comes to realise, 'If you can't beat them, join them' and as a result has to become a bit of a Peaky herself.\"\n\nStephen Graham - Season 6\n\nWith roles in Snatch, Line of Duty and This Is England to name but a few, there's never been a more perfect addition to the Peaky Blinders past than Stephen Graham. He's long been rumoured to be on the show, and he's now been spotted on the set of season 6 in an as-yet-unnamed role.\n\nAside from the roles previously mentioned, Stephen has also been in Gangs of New York, Public Enemies, Pirates of the Carribean, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Journey's End, Rocketman, The Irishman, Band of Brothers, Boardwalk Empire, Little Boy Blue, The Virtues and White House Farm.\n\nStephen Graham - Season 6\n\nWith roles in Snatch, Line of Duty and This Is England to name but a few, there's never been a more perfect addition to the Peaky Blinders past than Stephen Graham. He's long been rumoured to be on the show, and he's now been confirmed by official Peaky social pages with this photo in an as-yet-unnamed role, as well as being spotted on the set of season 6 in April 2021.\n\nAside from the roles previously mentioned, Stephen has also been in Gangs of New York, Public Enemies, Pirates of the Carribean, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Journey's End, Rocketman, The Irishman, Band of Brothers, Boardwalk Empire, Little Boy Blue, The Virtues and White House Farm.\n\nAmber Anderson - Season 6\n\nAmber Anderson is joining the cast in an as-yet-unnamed role! The news was announced in February 2021, with Amber and the Peaky social media pages announcing it online. Amber wrote: 'Well, blimey. Beyond thrilled to announce that I will be in the final season of @peakyblindersofficial . We are already filming and it is going to be epic!' Amber is best known for her roles in the 2020 adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. as Jane Fairfax alongside fellow Peaky star Anya Taylor-Joy, as well as a role in a 2013 episode of Black Mirror and The Riot Club as Lady Anne.\n\nJoe Cole as John Shelby, Season 1-4\n\nJoe Cole played the role of John Shelby on the show, before he was tragically killed off in season four in an act of revenge by the Changretta family. Joe is best known for his role in Peaky, but also for an episode of Black Mirror and a recurring role on Pure as well as the lead in Gangs of London.\n\nOf leaving the show, he told the Independent: \"It was business as usual really, just wrapping what's been a fantastic period of my life. Because the shooting scene didn't require a lot of the main cast and because we have different crews each year it was a pretty low-key exit to be honest.\n\n\"I had other projects on and I felt it was the right time to go, really. So it was just a case of feeling like letting some of the other characters grow.\"\n\nSteven Knight added: \"Sometimes it's to do with the character. Sometimes it's to do with... you know, Peaky is getting a huge amount of attention, in the States and here in the UK, so our actors are being picked up for other things.\n\n\"When they get picked up for other things, we're not like the American system where you tie the actor in for five series from the beginning and they can't leave. All our people are free to leave whenever they want. We wouldn't have it any other way, but we have to factor that in.\"\n\nAnnabelle Wallis as Grace Shelby, Season 1-3 & 5\n\nAnnabelle Wallis portrayed Grace, initially an undercover spy informing on Tommy for Inspector Campbell, but she fell in love with the Peaky leader and couldn't carry on. When Tommy discovered her betrayal, she married an American and moved there, but returned to the UK in series two to seek fertility treatment. She and Tommy spent a night of passion together and when she fell pregnant, she left her husband and the pair finally got together. Sadly, Grace was killed by the mafia in season three, but returned to Tommy as a ghost in the fifth season.\n\nAnnabelle played Jane Seymour in The Tudors, and also starred in The Mummy alongside Tom Cruise as Jenny Halsey. She had a small role in X-Men: First Class, as well as King Arthur: Legend of the Sword.\n\nIddo Goldberg as Freddie Thorne - Season 1\n\nIddo Goldberg joined the cast of Peaky Blinders for season one, playing Freddie Thorne. Iddo is best known for his roles in Secret Diary of a Call Girl as Ben, US horror series Salem as Isaac Walton and in the Netflix adaptation of Snowpiercer, as Bennett Knox.\n\nIddo portrayed Freddie Thorne in the first season, Tommy's former best mate, war comrade and eventual nemesis. His relationship with Ada was a huge issue for the ex-friends, as well as his Communist beliefs. Freddie married Ada in the first season and the couple welcomed a son, Karl. Right at the end, Freddie has Tommy's back once again, helping him defeat Billy Kimber's gang. Unfortunately, although his character is mentioned in the second season, he doesn't appear - having died of pestilence or Spanish flu off-screen, and the first episode sees the family at his funeral.\n\nAdrien Brody as Luca Changretta, Season 4\n\nHollywood star Adrien Brody was the main antagonist of season four, seeking revenge against the Shelbys for the death of his father and brother, Vicente and Angel.\n\nOf playing the role, Adrien told the BBC: \"It's a dream role for me in a lot of ways. I'm really grateful, Steve said he had me in mind to play this role. Interestingly, I've always found it odd that I haven't had an opportunity to quite play this character in my relatively lengthy career.\n\n\"It leaves me wanting a bit more but it's really fun to embrace. That's the beauty of acting and the process that even if you're playing a bad person, there's an ability to have playfulness with a world that is vastly entertaining to watch but also to embody.\"\n\nAidan Gillen as Aberama Gold, Season 4-5\n\nAidan Gillen joined Peaky Blinders in series four as Aberama Gold, is described as a 'dangers' ally for the Shelbys and also becomes a lover to Polly late in the season. Sadly, Aberama was killed at the end of season five. Aidan is best known for his portrayal of Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish in Game of Thrones, but also for his role in The Wire, Queer as Folk and in the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody as the band's manager, John Reid.\n\nOf joining the cast, Aidan said: \"I take things quite literally. The name is quite big and sounds like some kind of a showman, which he is in his way, a larger-than-life figure. In the case of Aberama, I think it's quite important the way the other characters react in such aghast to the idea that they're going to roll this guy in.\"\n\nCharlie Murphy as Jessie Eden, Season 4-5\n\nCharlie Murphy joined Peaky Blinders in series four as Jessie Eden, based on a real-life person of the same name - a support of the Communist cause and a union convenor who Tommy takes as a lover to manipulate her. Charlie has also starred in Love/Hate, Misfits, Ripper Street and Happy Valley.\n\nOf joining the cast, Charlie said: \"She's no damsel in distress. They are two people who have been through so much loss, and they found some comfort in each other. Tommy has definitely met his match in regards to education, that wit and quick thinking. She's a great chess player, just like him. She enjoys his company, and being exercised in some way by another great mind.\"\n\nCharlie revealed to Digital Spy in 2021 that she would not be returning to Peaky Blinders for season 6, and although the reason for her departure was not discussed, she said a spin-off about Jessie Eden would thoroughly interest her: \"I just think she was an incredible woman, and she's a bit of a spy. There's so much. I mean, you could make a TV series about her for sure.\""
