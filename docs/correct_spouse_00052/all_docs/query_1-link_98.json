        "text": "UPDATED 6:32 p.m., April 15, 2008\n\nAdrien Brody, Emmanuelle Seigner and Elsa Pataky have signed on to star in “Giallo,” the latest thriller from Italian horrormeister Dario Argento.\n\n“Giallo” revolves around an American flight attendant who teams with an Italian investigator to search for her missing sister who has been abducted by a serial killer known only as Yellow.\n\nThe term “giallo” means “yellow” in Italian and also refers to the Italian pulp, horror and erotic genre of film and literature. Argento has built his name with movies that combine horror and eroticism such as 1977’s “Suspiria” and “The Mother of Tears,” which The Weinstein Co./Myriad Pictures will release stateside June 6.\n\n“Giallo” might mark the first time an actor of Brody’s caliber has starred in an Argento film.\n\nThe film, from a screenplay by Jim Agnew and Sean Keller, will be produced by Rafael Primorac and Richard Rionda Del Castro.\n\nProduction is set to start May 12 in Torino, Italy, with postproduction work done in Los Angeles.\n\nBrody is exec producing along with Oscar Generale, Claudio Argento, Luis De Val, David Milner, Billy Dietrich, Patricia Eberle, Donald Barton and John Hicks.\n\nClaudio Argento’s Opera Films will handle production services in Italy, with Footprint Investment Fund co-financing.\n\nHannibal Pictures is handling worldwide sales and will be selling the film next month at the Festival de Cannes.\n\nBrody (“The Darjeeling Limited”) is repped by Red Hawk Management.\n\nSeigner (“The Diving Bell and the Butterfly”) is repped by Gersh and Untitled Entertainment.\n\nSpanish actress Pataky, repped by ICM and Bianca Dohmen, has appeared in “Mancora” and “Snakes on a Plane.”"
