After appearing in Bullet in 1996 with Tupac Shakur and Mickey Rourke, Brody hovered on the brink of stardom, receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his role in the 1998 film Restaurant, and later praise for his roles in Spike Leeâs Summer of Sam and Terrence Malickâs The Thin Red Line.\n\nHe received widespread recognition when he was cast as the lead in Roman Polanskiâs The Pianist (2002). To prepare for the role, Brody withdrew for months, gave up his apartment and his car, broke up with his then-girlfriend, and learned how to play Chopin on the piano; at 6â1â³ (1.85m) tall, he lost thirty pounds (13.6 kg), dropping him to 130 lbs (59 kg). The role won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him, at age twenty-nine, the youngest actor ever to win the award, and, to date, the only winner under the age of thirty. He also won a CÃ©sar Award for his performance.\n\nBrody appeared on Saturday Night Live on May 10, 2003, his first TV work. During this appearance, he controversially gave an improvised introduction for Jamaican reggae musical guest Sean Paul, while wearing faux dreadlocks and using a Jamaican accent. Brody did so without the permission of producer Lorne Michaels, causing him to be banned from Saturday Night Live. Other TV appearances include NBCâs The Today Show, and MTVâs Punkâd after being tricked by Ashton Kutcher.\n\nAfter The Pianist, Brody appeared in four very different films. In Dummy (released in 2003, but originally shot in 2000, just prior to his work in The Pianist), he portrayed Steven Schochet, a socially awkward aspiring ventriloquist in pursuit of a love interest (his employment counselor). He learned ventriloquism and puppetry for the role (under the tutelage of actor/ventriloquist Alan Semok) convincingly enough to perform all of the voice stunts and puppet manipulation live on set in real-time, with no subsequent post dubbing.\n\nHe played Noah Percy, a mentally disabled young man, in the film The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan, shell-shocked war veteran Jack Starks in The Jacket, writer Jack Driscoll in the 2005 King Kong remake, and father-to-be Peter Whitman in The Darjeeling Limited by Wes Anderson. King Kong was both a critical and box office successâit grossed $550 million worldwide, and is Brodyâs most successful film to date, financially. He reprised his role voicing Driscoll in the video game adaptation of the film. Additionally, Brody played a detective in Hollywoodland.\n\nIn 2011, Brody starred in a Stella Artois beer ad called âCrying Jeanâ that premiered right after half-time of Super Bowl XLV as part of Stellaâs âShe Is a Thing of Beautyâ campaign. He appeared in Woody Allenâs 2011 Academy Award-winning comedy, Midnight in Paris as Salvador DalÃ­. On January 16, 2012, Brody made his debut as a runway model for Prada Menâs Fall/Winter 2012 show.\n\nIn 2014, Brody collaborated again with Wes Anderson in the Academy Award-winning The Grand Budapest Hotel, where he played Dmitri. He received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or in a Movie for portraying the title character in Houdini a History miniseries. The same year Brody was cast as the title role of Lee Tamahoriâs action epic Emperor, about a young woman seeking revenge for the execution of her father by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, opposite Sophie Cookson. The movie was finished and screened at Cannes in 2017 but its release has been held up by legal challenges.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Adrien Brody\n\nWho is Adrien Brody?\n\nAdrien Nicholas Brody is an American actor and producer.
