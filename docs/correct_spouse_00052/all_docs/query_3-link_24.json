        "text": "Despite our best efforts, we can get allyship wrong. So wrong. But I was relieved when I was told, “It’s okay to make mistakes. Just keep asking us questions if you want to understand.” We were at a safe space gathering, as part of our work as Imaginable Impact. I had admitted to being unclear about how to do good by the LBGTQIA+ community as we moved deeper into our DEI work. I look at Pride Month content and stories, and I see a lot of rainbows. A lot of of celebrations. But not a lot of conversations. So what is allyship? Or what is it NOT? ❌Tokenism ❌ Featuring LGBTQIA+ individuals in Pride campaigns or as the designated queer representative, but not in broader campaigns, policy making spaces, or actual leadership positions ❌Seasonal Support ❌ What happens after Pride month? Real allies make consistent effort to push for change and progress all year long ❌Performative Gestures ❌ Sure, it’s nice to add a banner or provide a Pride version of your company logo, but if there is no substantive work that helps members in the community, this is all for show ❌Cheap Talk ❌ “I’m pro-LGBT because I know someone” is not allyship. Without efforts at true empathy through conversation, advocacy, and education – for yourself and others – then it’s all empty words. Meanwhile, there are so many other ways to stand up as a real ally. My commitment is to speak louder for the LGBTQIA+ community and work harder to amplify their voices. Because I cannot talk #inclusion if it is not inclusion for all. I asked some community members to get us started. Paulie Durig, CHyp, Bam T., Camille Q. Ramos, MMC, and Nonito Cabrera Jr. gave actionable steps on allyship that matters. They have more to say, naturally, so I encourage you to build on this conversation. In fact, talk to your friends, co-workers, neighbors, classmates, siblings. Everyone. And listen. Ask questions. Pay attention. Happy Pride! Let’s keep each other safe, and promote dignity for all."
