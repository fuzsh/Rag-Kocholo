        "text": "Archivado en: • • • •\n\nJust like in everyday life, running into an ex-partner isn’t always pleasant, especially if the breakup wasn’t smooth. And for celebrities, it’s no different. They often find themselves at events where they might come face to face with ex-couples. This was the scenario at the MET Gala 2024.\n\nOf course, the event was packed with the press, photographers, journalists, cameras… everything needed to capture every moment. And indeed, not a single detail went unnoticed.\n\nRosalía & Rauw Alejandro\n\nOne of the couples that seemed really solid, even getting engaged in early 2023 with a touching and romantic music video, is the Spanish star Rosalía and the Puerto Rican, Rauw Alejandro. Their breakup (2023) is still a big topic of conversation, not just because they seemed so committed and in love, but also because, so far, nobody knows the real reason why they split up. If we think back, Rauw even wrote a goodbye song for her, and a few months after they broke up, ‘la Motomami’ started dating actor Jeremy Allen White.\n\nThere’s talk that Rauwsalía was spotted at a famous restaurant before the Met Gala, but that’s just gossip. However, they both showed up at the same event. Interestingly, she wore black while he went for white, like yin and yang. Some media outlets suggest that Rosalía might be wearing what they call a ‘revenge dress,’ a term that became popular when Lady Di wore a stunning outfit after her then-husband, Prince Charles, admitted to cheating with Camilla Parker Bowles.\n\nElsa Pataky & Adrien Brody\n\nThe Spanish actress Elsa Pataky and Australian actor Chris Hemsworth make up one of Hollywood’s most admired and enduring couples. They’ve been together since 2010, when they met and married in the same year. That’s why their appearance at the 2024 MET Gala caught everyone’s attention. Not only did their stylish outfits impress social media users, but Chris was also one of the event’s presenters.\n\nHowever, before this wonderful love story began, Elsa was with Adrien between 2006 and 2009. Their relationship was one of the most talked-about love stories at the time. Adrien even gave Elsa a castle in New York as a gift. Many people thought they would eventually tie the knot, but fate had different plans.\n\nDuring Vogue’s broadcast, they showed Elsa and Chris on one side of the screen and Brody with his new partner, Georgina Chapman, on the other. It was quite a coincidence to see all four of them in the same place among more than 600 guests. While Elsa and Chris were busy with interviews, Brody and his partner were posing for photographs. What a surprising turn of events!\n\nBad Bunny & Kendall Jenner\n\nIf Bad Bunny has made one thing clear with his latest song, ‘ADIVINO,’ in collaboration with his fellow Myke Towers, it’s that he still thinks about his ex, the model Kendall Jenner. During their short but intense relationship this past 2023, Benito and Kendall became the center of attention on several occasions. One of Hollywood’s «surprise» couples, he is the first Latin star to enter the Kardashian universe. They attended several events together over the past year, including the 2023 Met Gala in honor of Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nUnlike previous couples, these two weren’t just in the same place; they were together at the Met Gala afterparty. In a photo that’s got people talking, we can see Jenner reclining on a couch, looking cozy and affectionate. Plus, both of them are smiling big. Could that mean they might be giving their relationship another shot?\n\nEven though Jenner is a reality TV star, she doesn’t talk much about her personal life, and she’s never talked about her relationship with the Puerto Rican. Similarly, Bunny himself hasn’t said much about it either."
