        "text": "Name: Adrien Nicholas Brody\n\nBorn: April 14, 1973\n\nCity: Woodhaven, Queens, New York. US\n\nOccupation: Actor, Producer, Artist\n\nHeight: 6′ 1″ (1,85 m)\n\nAdrien Nicholas Brody was born in Woodhaven, Queens, New York. The only child of retired history professor and painter Elliot Brody and Hungarian-born photographer Sylvia Plachy. He accompanied his mother on assignments for the Village Voice, and credits her with making him feel comfortable in front of the camera.\n\nIn his childhood Adrien Brody performed magic shows at children’s birthday parties as “The Amazing Adrien”. His parents enrolled him in acting classes to distract him from the dangerous people who might exist in the neighborhood where they lived.\n\nThe actor commented on his childhood and adolescence during the ceremony of the campaign Save the children 2015:\n\n“I’m a product of public schools. My father is a public school teacher… Without his guidance, I wouldn’t be here today,” confessed the star and newly appointed Bulgari ambassador at a press conference preceding the party. “I wouldn’t have the confidence to speak my mind… I would not have the strength to commit to the roles I have, to believe in myself in this business, which is a very competitive business.”\n\n“I grew up in a working class neighborhood,” he continued, captivating the room with his candidness about his modest Queens upbringing. “And I’ve witnessed the effects of poverty and lack of education and lack of guidance, which falls under the same category, and (I saw) friends of mine who did not have the self-confidence at the end of the day and did not have the encouragement and who did not pursue those dreams.”\n\nHe attended the I.S. 145 Joseph Pulitzer middle school, The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts in New York.
