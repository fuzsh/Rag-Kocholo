        "text": "Before Elsa Pataky met Chris Hemsworth, she was known as the Spanish model/actress who dated Adrien Brody for several years. That’s mostly how I knew her, pre-Hemsworth: Adrien Brody was obsessed with her, and he bought her a castle. Elsa and Adrien’s relationship started in 2006, and ended at some point in 2009. I’m not 100% sure of the timeline for Elsa’s relationship with Chris Hemsworth, but I feel pretty certain that there was no real overlap. Both Adrien and Elsa moved on – Adrien started up with Lara Lieto at some point, although I don’t know if they’re still together (but they were together or have been together for years). Elsa obviously moved on with Hemsworth, and they have three children together. So do you think Chris Hemsworth ever gets a little bit jealous about Adrien Brody, who loved Elsa so much that he bought her a castle?\n\n[From Star Magazine, print edition]\n\nDo you think that Elsa Pataky and Adrien Brody would be auditioning for the same film, or that producers are like “you know who we need for these roles? Pataky and Brody!”? No. I do not believe it. Sadly, I don’t believe it because Adrien Brody is not any producer or director’s dream-cast at this point. I looked up his IMDB – he had a gig on Peaky Blinders last year? But he doesn’t seem to be working all that much. As for Elsa… well, there were a lot of reasons why Chris Hemsworth moved his family back to Australia, and one of those reasons was so that he wouldn’t have to keep pulling strings to get his wife work, just my opinion. Still, any excuse to look at old photos of Elsa and Adrien…"
