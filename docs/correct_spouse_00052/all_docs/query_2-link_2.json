        "text": "Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman chose the red carpet at the Tribeca Film Festival to finally confirm they’re an item.\n\nThe couple attended the premiere of the film Clean in New York City on Saturday, stopping to get their photo taken together on the red carpet with their arms intertwined and heads pressed close together. According to Page Six, the pair have been dating for almost two years. Chapman filed for divorce from disgraced movie mogul, Harvey Weinstein in 2017. The Marchesa designer and the actor apparently met years ago and remained friends socially, but that connection took a romantic turn in 2019 when they both attended the launch of model Helena Christensen’s swimwear line in Puerto Rico.\n\nRumors the pair had started seeing each other first began in February 2020 when they were spotted together at a candlelit dinner with friends. A film industry source confirmed to People at the time that they had been seeing each other “for a while” and share “many of the same interests.” They added, “She thinks he’s unusual and interesting. She finds [him] to be an interesting person with a deep passion for his work that is similar to hers.” While Chapman was still recovering from the Weinstein scandal, the source explained that Brody “diverts her attention from the pain of her situation and subsequent split.”\n\nThis is Chapman’s first relationship since filing for divorce after dozens of women came forward with harrowing stories accusing her ex-husband of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has since been convicted in New York of rape and criminal sexual assault, and will soon be extradited to California to stand trial on charges that he sexually assaulted five women in Los Angeles. Weinstein and Chapman, who share two daughters India and Dashiell, reached a divorce settlement in January 2018 in which the fashion designer received primary custody and a $15 to $20 million settlement, according to Page Six.\n\nBrody has previously been linked to a number of high-profile actresses and models, including Monet Mazur, January Jones, Sky Nellor, Lara Lieto, and Elsa Pataky. He and Pataky were also briefly engaged, and he even bought her a castle in upstate New York for her 31st birthday, but the pair broke up shortly after and the actress went on to marry Chris Hemsworth.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— What Is Naomi Osaka’s Job, Really?\n\n— Did Paying a Ransom for a Stolen Magritte Painting Inadvertently Fund Terrorism?\n\n— Y.A.
