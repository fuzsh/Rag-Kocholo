        "text": "There's a sort of second-hand triumph that comes from looking at photographs of fashion designer Georgina Chapman in recent years.\n\nIn almost all of them, she's standing beside movie star, Adrien Body — smiling and seemingly happy — the most recent ones taken at the 2024 Met Gala in May.\n\nRumours about the pair's relationship began in 2019, with the couple making their first public outing as an apparent couple in June 2021.\n\nThe pictures made it well beyond the gossip sites and social pages because they were more than that. They were of a woman who started over, who slowly but surely climbed her way out of the depths of someone else's scandal: that of her ex-husband, Harvey Weinstein.\n\nWhen Hollywood turned its back on Georgina Chapman.\n\nChapman had been married to the heavyweight Hollywood producer for a decade by the time he became the defining scalp of the #MeToo movement.\n\nMore than 90 women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct and sexual assault against Weinstein, the first of which were exposed in Pulitzer Prize-winning reports by The New Yorker and The New York Times.\n\nHe was jailed for 23 years on rape and sexual assault charges in New York in 2020, before having his conviction overturned in 2024 on the basis that he did not receive a fair trial.\n\nAs the co-founder of women's fashion house, Marchesa, she was a fixture of the fashion world; red carpets, runways, media appearances. But come October 2017, she retreated.\n\nAs did Marchesa. The New York-based label, which she established with Keren Craig in 2004, cancelled its showing at 2018 Fashion Week and was nowhere to be seen on red carpets.\n\nThe latter seemed to follow claims made by several actors (including Felicity Huffman, Kerry Washington and Renée Zellweger) that Weinstein had previously pressured and bullied them into wearing Marchesa gowns at Hollywood events.\n\nCraig firmly denied she or Chapman knew. But stars seemed eager to keep their distance, regardless.\n\nUntil May 2018 and Scarlett Johansson's showing at the Met Gala.\n\nThe actor made a pointed statement by being the first high-profile star in months to wear a Marchesa design, seemingly implying that a woman should not suffer the consequences of her husband's crimes.\n\n\"I wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful, and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,\" the actor told The Cut.\n\nVogue editor Anna Wintour, one of the most influential voices in fashion, echoed the sentiment in the magazine's June issue, writing, \"I am firmly convinced that Georgina had no idea about her husband’s behaviour; blaming her for any of it, as too many have in our gladiatorial digital age, is wrong. I believe that one should not hold a person responsible for the actions of his or her partner. What Georgina should be receiving is our compassion and understanding”.\n\nGeorgina Chapman speaks.\n\nIn the pages of that same issue of Vogue, ran Chapman's first interview. She spoke about the shock of the allegations (\"I couldn't keep food down... My head was spinning\") and the aftermath.\n\n\"It was difficult because the first article [in The New York Times] was about a time long before I’d ever met [Weinstein], so there was a minute where I couldn’t make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded, and I realised that this wasn’t an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here,\" she said.\n\nChapman said she didn't go out for five months because of the humiliation. She was, simply, broken.\n\n\"There was a part of me that was terribly naïve — clearly, so naïve. I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief! And I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them?\"\n\nShe continued, sobbing, \"They love their dad. They love him. I just can’t bear it for them!\"\n\nIt took another year for Chapman to make her red carpet return, appearing alongside Crazy Rich Asians star Constance Wu, who she styled for the event.\n\nIn the years since, Hollywood and fashion have gradually welcomed Marchesa (and by extension, Chapman) back into the fold. Her professional life is rebuilding.\n\nAnd her relationship with Brody would suggest her personal one is, too.\n\nThis article was first published in June 2021, and has been updated since with new information.\n\nFeature image: Getty."
