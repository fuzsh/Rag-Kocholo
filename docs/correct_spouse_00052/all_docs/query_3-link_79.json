        "text": "\"Art cinema\" has for over fifty years defined how audiences and critics imagine film outside Hollywood, but surprisingly little scholarly attention has been paid to the concept since the 1970s. And yet in the last thirty years art cinema has flourished worldwide. The emergence of East Asian and Latin American new waves, the reinvigoration of European film, the success of Iranian directors, and the rise of the film festival have transformed the landscape of world cinema. This book brings into focus art cinema's core internationalism, demonstrating its centrality to understanding film as a global phenomenon. The book reassesses the field of art cinema in light of recent scholarship on world film cultures. In addition to analysis of key regions and films, the essays cover topics including theories of the film image; industrial, aesthetic, and political histories; and art film's intersections with debates on genre, sexuality, new media forms, and postcolonial cultures. Global Art Cinema brings together a diverse group of scholars in a timely conversation that reaffirms the category of art cinema as relevant, provocative, and, in fact, fundamental to contemporary film studies.\n\nPDF: http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/61773 The recent irruption—and ensuing expansion—of the term “global art” in academia, arts practice, and curatorship has signalled an attempt to supersede the territorial limits imposed by the old parameters of Eurocentrism, Western dominance, and the monocultural project of modernity. In the early 2000s, art historians such as K. Zijlmans, David Carrier or James Elkins, driven by theorizations of the end of universal and national art histories, forwarded the proposition of a world and global art history. Following suit, curatorial projects developed by intellectuals and theorists linked to ZKM at Karlsruhe (Hans Belting, Peter Weibel and Andrea Buddensieg) introduced the concept of “global art” into art discourse as a way of going beyond the formulas of modern internationalism as well as postmodern new internationalism. In the first book of what would later become a trilogy, Contemporary Art and the Museum (2007), Peter Weibel and Andrea Buddensieg documented the impact that globalization has had on contemporary art in an attempt to make visible a phenomenon that in recent years had been limited, for the most part, to so-called “peripheral biennales”: the will to supersede the concept of “Euro-Americanism” by championing the alternative project of a “beyond Euro-America”. Along these lines, Hans Belting and Andrea Buddensieg published The Global Art World. Audiences, Markets, and Museums in 2009, an exploration of the different processes of global art production. In this volume, Belting and Buddensieg distinguished between the concept of “World Art” and “global art”, the former referring to the world heritage of art spanning all periods and countries; the latter denoting a contemporary development of art that, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes of modern art towards the end of the twentieth century in clear opposition to the highly valued ideals of progress and hegemony.\n\nThe globalization phenomenon acts in the world like a storm that sweeps all in its way. This phenomenon tries to put together many differents cultures. But every culture develops a resistance against a level of globalization. Nevertheless, each culture must be open to reevaluations and should be in search of new equilibrium. Following the Senegalese philosopher Souleymane Bachir Diagne, the paper develops the idea that, evaluation comes before values and it is the raison d’être of these values. This implies that it is necessary for a culture to be its own historian. So, it is necessary to invent a different discourse in the face of the globalization phenomenon.\n\nGlobalization is the defining character of the present world. It references the interconnectedness of nation-states and communities of people. It is a highly contested arena of social science discourse. There are those that criticise it for its negative consequences, for example commercialism. Those that favour it, often focus on positive social goods, such as democracy. These two opposing views are not unlike Karl Marx critique of capitalism and Adam Smith's defence of it. The following brief essay follows a particular thread in the relevant discourses, which is focused on culture and art. It concludes with a discourse on two examples of transnational cultural exchange practice."
