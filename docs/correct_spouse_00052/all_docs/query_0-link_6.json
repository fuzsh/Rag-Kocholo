        "text": "Spanish model and actress (born 1976)\n\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is Lafuente and the second or maternal family name is Medianu.\n\nElsa Lafuente Medianu (Spanish: [ˈelsa laˈfwente meˈðjanu]; born 18 July 1976),[1] known professionally as Elsa Pataky, is a Spanish model and actress. Pataky is known for her leading role of Raquel Alonso in the Spanish teen drama Al salir de Clase (1997-2002), before garnering international recognition as Elena Neves in the Fast & Furious franchise. She has appeared in the films Snakes on a Plane (2006), Giallo (2009) and Give 'Em Hell, Malone (2009). She also starred in the Spanish film Di Di Hollywood (2010) and played Mr. Norton and the Vuvalini General in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) in a dual role.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nPataky was born Elsa Lafuente Medianu in Madrid, Spain,[1] the daughter of José Francisco Lafuente, a Spanish biochemist, and Cristina Medianu Pataky, a Romanian publicist.[2][3][4] She has a younger half-brother: Cristian Prieto Medianu, a cinematographic director. She uses the surname Pataky in homage to her Hungarian Greek maternal grandmother Rosa Pataky.[5]\n\nPataky attended the Universidad CEU San Pablo,[6] studying journalism and taking acting classes. In addition to Spanish and Romanian, she is fluent in English, Italian, Portuguese, and French.[7][8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nPataky was a member of the Madrid theatre company Teatro Cámara de Ángel Gutiérrez. Eventually, she left school when she was cast in the television series Al salir de clase.[3] Some of her subsequent films were co-productions with the UK and France, which introduced her to working in English and French. She was in the cast of the television series Queen of Swords (2000) as Señora Vera Hidalgo, trophy wife of Gaspar Hidalgo and mistress of Captain Grisham, credited in the opening titles but appearing in only 14 of the 22 episodes. She also had a recurring role in the television series Los Serrano, playing teacher Raquel, who fell in love with her student Marcos (Fran Perea).[citation needed]\n\nPataky has appeared in over 10 Spanish films and co-starred in the French film Iznogoud (2004). She was also on the cover of August 2006 issue of Maxim. She was cast in 2009 in the Mexican series Mujeres Asesinas as Paula Moncada in the episode \"Ana y Paula, Ultrajadas\". She also starred in the action noir film Give 'Em Hell, Malone and Dario Argento's Giallo.[citation needed]\n\nPataky became the female face for the first collection of Time Force's jewelry line Ultimate Jewel, opposite football star Cristiano Ronaldo.[9] She played Officer Elena Neves in the movie Fast Five, with Dwayne Johnson as her partner, Luke Hobbs. MTV Networks' NextMovie.com named her one of the Breakout Stars to Watch for in 2011.[10] Pataky was a stand in for Natalie Portman in the post end credit scene in Thor: The Dark World.[11]\n\nPataky reprised her role as Elena Neves in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), and The Fate of the Furious (2017), the sixth, seventh and eighth installments of Fast & Furious film series respectively.[12]\n\nIn 2018, Pataky starred in the Australian web television series Tidelands as Adrielle Cuthbert. It was released on 14 December 2018 on Netflix.[13]\n\nPataky played the lead role in Interceptor, directed by Matthew Reilly, which was released in June 2022.[14]\n\nPataky co-founded a skincare brand called Purely Byron. The brand launched its first product in 2022. In March 2023, Purely Byron was placed in administration and put up for sale.[15] At the time, BWX Group owned a 47.4 per cent stake in the company, while Ido Leffler and Lance Kalish held about 22 per cent each, and Chris Hemsworth's Byron Bay 1st Management a 3.2 per cent.[16]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nPataky dated French actor Michaël Youn from 2004 to 2006 and American actor Adrien Brody from 2006 to 2009.[17] She started dating Australian actor Chris Hemsworth in early 2010 after meeting through their mutual representatives. Pataky and Hemsworth married during the Christmas holidays in 2010.[18] They have three children together: a daughter and twin sons.[19][20][21] In 2015, the family moved from Los Angeles to Byron Bay, Australia.[22]\n\nIn September 2012, Pataky won €310,000 in a ruling by the Supreme Court of Spain against publishing group Ediciones Zeta. In March 2007, Interviu, a magazine owned by the Zeta, published topless photos of Pataky that had been taken with a long lens while Pataky was changing clothes during a photoshoot for Elle magazine. The Zeta group said it would appeal against the decision.[23]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Solo en la buhardilla Chica revista Short film 2000 The Art of Dying Candela [24] Tatawo Blanqui [24] Less Is More Diana [24] 2001 Don't Tempt Me Waitress in Hell Twelfth Night [es] Marta Cuspineda [24] 2002 Peor imposible ¿qué puede fallar?
