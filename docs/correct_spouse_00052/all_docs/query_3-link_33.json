        "text": "Koochu stayed up late last night for one of the most talked about, fashionable film events in the calendar year, Oscars 2014. Though the award ceremony is the centre of discussions, Koochu embraced the Red Carpet imagery to gather inspirations on colours, styles, textures and patterns which we hope to incorporate into our Summer collection. What we enjoyed most from the red carpet was the outfits soon-to-be mothers selected for this joyous occasssion and Koochu have compiled a summary of our top three.\n\n29 year old American actress, Olivia Wilde now 6 months into pregnancy arrived to the Oscars with sheer simplisitic yet elegant attired. Wilde seen below, dressed in a full length Maison Valentino black turtle neck collar gown with a white back trail and Tiffany jewels. Koochu loves Wilde’s choice of simplicity highlighting attention on her beautiful baby bump.\n\nScandal star Kerry Washington graced the red carpet is a luxurious Jason Wu lilac boob-tube gown. The timeless dress insured her baby bump was the main accessory for the event. Decorated in diamonds and a deep-red rouge lipstick, Koochu admired her radiance pregnancy glow.\n\nElsa Patsky, husband to Chris Henworth dazzled the red carpet in an Emerald gem-studded Elie Saab. With twins on the way, Koochu applauds her confidence to happily expose the beautiful bump for the Oscars and wishes her all the best for the double.\n\nWhich of our soon-to-be Mothers dress up their bump the best?"
