        "text": "In retrospect, I do think it was probably for the best when Chris Hemsworth suddenly moved his young family out of LA and back to Australia. Before that move, his wife Elsa Pataky was a regular on celebrity blogs, fashion blogs and across entertainment/gossip media. She loved to be photographed and she loved to do interviews and she loved to get attention. I thought, at the time, that the move to Australia would be detrimental to their marriage because Elsa would be so unhappy. But she stayed with him and I think he got her some work in the Australian film/TV industry too. Elsa chatted with an Australian outlet, Body + Soul, about her life now and fitness and her ten-year marriage to Chris. Some highlights:\n\nShe doesnât like feeling soft: âIf Iâm not exercising, I donât feel strong. I feel soft and I donât like it. I am a very active person. I want my body to stay young â in strength and energy. I want to still go horseriding with my daughter when Iâm 80!â\n\nHer obsession with fitness came from watching the Olympics: âI was in awe of the fit, athletic body and my whole life became about exercise. Iâve never stopped since I was 14. I just fell in love with being healthy and fit.â\n\nShe loved the LA fitness scene: âI learnt so much about health and fitness in Los Angeles. They were much more advanced in LA than in Spain.â\n\nShe & Chris share a love of fitness: âWe love to do sports, eat healthy and move our bodies. Weâve got the kids into surfing. Any hobbies to get them outside, and not on social media and computers. My daughter has been horseriding with me since she was two-and-a-half.â\n\nOn her pregnancies: âI had to slow down during my pregnancies and I couldnât exercise as hard as I wanted,â she says. But the physical changes that came with carrying a child paled in comparison to the mental impact of motherhood. âI remember feeling a bit lost when I had India. I thought my life was going to be the same [when I had kids] and I would keep working. But I couldnât. Chris would come home and say, âHow was your day?â And I didnât feel proud to say: Iâm just a mum. But you should. Because itâs the hardest but greatest job in the world.â\n\nDevoting herself to motherhood: âI really liked being with the kids. I wanted to take them to school and pick them up every day. I just love that moment. I didnât grow up with my parents [around] and I missed that so much, so I wanted to give that to my kidsâ¦ I love acting, but having balance is important to me. So, if something comes along that fits into my life and lets me work close to home, then Iâm happy to do it.â\n\nHer tenth wedding anniversary is coming up: âItâs funny that people think of us as a perfect couple. No way. Itâs been ups and downs, and we still keep working at the relationship. I think a relationship is constant work. Itâs not easy.â But true to form, Pataky says any struggles theyâve encountered have only made their union stronger. âI always try to see the positives of things.â\n\n[From Body + Soul]\n\nMaybe Iâm reading too much into it, but I felt like I detected some wistfulness, especially when she talked about LA being more advanced about fitness and exercise. Sure, sheâs happy with her life in Australia and she rides her horses and surfs and has a beach view. But she could have had that in Malibu, plus she could have pap strolled all the time. I donât know. It also feels like Elsa is just ride-or-die too – I absolutely believe that she and Chris have had some major ups and downs, and there was one point where I was pretty convinced that he checked out of the marriage in a major way. But Elsa stuck with it. They both did."
