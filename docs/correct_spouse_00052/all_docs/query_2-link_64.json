        "text": "Adrien Brody, who in November got a federal judge to block the release of the Dario Argento-directed thriller Giallo after the court found he was owed $640,000, has reached a settlement with the film’s backers. Three Seven Entertainment, Giallo Productions and Hannibal Pictures can now see the film get a DVD release from its U.S. distributor, Maya Entertainment.\n\nBrody claimed he’d been lied to and tried to block the U.S. distribution sale, but instead effectively froze the release in place. The rhetoric is over, and both sides issued conciliatory statements.\n\nIn his statement, Hannibal’s Richard Riondo Del Castro said: “I am glad to put this behind us and move forward with Adrien on the release of the film.” He called Brody “not only the star of the film, but a creative guiding force and a faithful production partner.”\n\nSaid Brody: “I very much enjoyed the process of making Giallo, and am happy that things have been resolved and that people can now enjoy seeing the film.” Brody plays an FBI agent hunting a serial killer in Italy, and objected to his face being used on the DVD release and the film was stuck in limbo until he was paid."
