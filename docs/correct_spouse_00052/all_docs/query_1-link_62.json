        "text": "Chris Hemsworth and his wife Elsa Pataky have announced that they are expecting their second child.\n\nThe Thor actor and his partner already have an 18-month-old daughter called India, who was born in London.\n\nHemsworth's publicist Robin Baum confirmed news of the pregnancy, which was first reported by People magazine.\n\nEarlier this year, the 30-year-old Australian actor said that fatherhood had helped him to prioritize his life and see work \"for what it is\".\n\nHe said being with family was \"what it's about\".\n\nAs well as Thor, the 30-year-old Australian actor has starred in Home and Away, Star Trek, Snow White and the Huntsman and Rush.\n\nSpanish actress and model Elsa Pataky, 37, was previously engaged to The Pianist actor Adrien Brody and also dated Kylie Minogue's ex-boyfriend Olivier Martinez.\n\nShe's appeared in Snakes on a Plane, Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6."
