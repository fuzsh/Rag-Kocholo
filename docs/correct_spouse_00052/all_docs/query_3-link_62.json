Their book is not simply a this is a wonderful opportunity, but a sober look at the reality that the plethora of SI funds are not particularly comparable and, in fact, the rating services provide radically different ratings for the same funds. Having set the framework and following up with details on the nature and attributes of the SI market, they conclude with a comprehensive guide on How to Invest Sustainably (and the warning that it will take work). If this is an investment universe you have an interest in entering, Your Essential Guide to Sustainable Investing is indeed an essential book to own and read.\n\n—Harold Evensky, Founder, Evensky and Katz\n\nSustainable investing is a complex subject. The investing industry, as it always does, has made it even more so. Here is a book that spells out what the data and peer-reviewed academic evidence tell us. The truth is, we simply don’t know whether ESG portfolios will outperform or underperform mainstream portfolios in the future. Ultimately, though, there are far more important things at stake. Adams and Swedroe have produced the go-to guide for anyone who wants to understand the issues involved.\n\n—Robin Powell, Editor, The Evidence-Based Investor\n\nDemand is booming for mutual funds that specialize in ethical investing—helping you put your money into companies that support the environment, workers, and society in general. But some apparently green funds are merely green-washed, only pretending to invest ethically. How can you find investments that truly reflect your principles? This excellent book will tell you. You’ll learn the nuances of social investing as well as discover your likely investment returns. Highly recommended!\n\n—Jane Bryant Quinn, Author, How to Make Your Money Last: The Indispensable Retirement Guide\n\nYou may have noticed that there’s currently a lot of buzz in the investing world about ESG and SRI. If you don’t have a clue what all this buzz is about, then this book is a must-read, since Larry and Sam get down in the weeds, explaining exactly what these investing styles are and how they may or may not be right for you. This book will bring you up to speed on these latest trends and help you become a better-informed investor.\n\n—Mel Lindauer, Co-Author, The Bogleheads’ Guide to Investing and The Bogleheads’ Guide to Retirement Planning\n\nLarry and Sam present a comprehensive view of today’s ESG investing landscape. Both have a vast experience in investments and client interactions. Larry has been a prolific writer on financial topics and Sam has been a globe-trotting champion for the environment. Together they bring clarity to an evolving investment world full of acronyms, making it accessible to all interested investors.\n\n—Eduardo Repetto, CIO, Avantis Investors\n\nSustainable investing is paramount for values-driven investors; yet, it is neither well-understood nor easily implemented by many investment professionals. Sam and Larry elucidate the dynamic landscape of sustainable investing and empirically demonstrate the impact of sustainable investing on firm characteristics such as cost of capital, valuations, and profitability, and on the performance of stocks and bonds. Moreover, they demonstrate that ESG investors, through their impact on asset prices, generate societal benefits by rewarding investments in green technologies and the reduction of gas emissions. Finally, Sam and Larry share robust investment principles and practical suggestions for building sustainable investment programs by clearly defining investment objectives, developing asset allocation methodologies, selecting underlying investments, and actively managing investment portfolios. This book is an essential resource for investment professionals who seek to understand sustainable investing and implement sustainable investment programs.\n\n—Marat Molyboga, Chief Risk Officer, Director of Research at Efficient Capital Management\n\nAdams and Swedroe have delivered a comprehensive review of the state of sustainable investing. They cut through the jargon, which is inconsistent and confusing at best, and misleading at worst, to help investors identify strategies aligned with their financial, societal, and personal goals. The book is essential reading for anyone seeking to put their money where their values are.\n\n—Tobias Carlisle, Founder and Portfolio Manager, Acquirers Funds\n\nAn eye-opening guide to the opportunities and consequences of sustainable investing. I admire the thorough discussion of recent developments, the crisp bottom lines, and Burton Malkiel’s wise Foreword. Required reading for my Duke investment strategies course.\n\n—Ed Tower, Emeritus Professor of Economics, Duke University\n\nRead this book! After doing so, you’ll know more about Sustainable Investing than anyone you know, including your financial advisor. In Your Essential Guide to Sustainable Investing, Sam Adams and Larry E. Swedroe dive deeply, making sense of the subject’s academic research while explaining how capitalism, itself, doesn’t have to destroy our planet. This should be required reading for every investor and investment professional.\n\n—Andrew Hallam, Bestselling Author, Balance: How to Invest and Spend for Happiness, Health and Wealth and Millionaire Teacher\n\nSam and I were together at Dimensional Fund Advisors for a number of years, so he is well aware of my role in co-founding Dimensional and my analytical data-driven view of investment management. Sam and Larry’s book reflects on the evolution of asset management and the challenges and opportunities ESG data analysis brings.\n\n—John ‘Mac’ McQuown, Co-Founding Dimensional Director, and Co-Proprietor, Stone Edge Farm\n\nExperienced financial practitioners are typically wise enough to approach financial product innovation with healthy skepticism. Sam and Larry cut through the noise of greenwashing and marketing jargon to offer a genuine roadmap investors can use today to achieve the long-term returns stakeholders require while effecting a sustainable positive impact on the world.\n\n—Adam Butler, Chief Investment Officer, ReSolve Asset Management\n\nIf you really want to understand the research, risks, returns, ratings, and reasons to own ESG funds this is the book to read. Evidenced-based investing information at its best!\n\n—Paul Merriman, Author, We’re Talking Millions! 12 Simple Ways to Supercharge Your Retirement\n\nIs there a choice between values and value in investing? Not always. Adams and Swedroe answer this question and many others that all investors must ask about ESG and sustainable investing. This impressive summary dispels myths and simplifies an evolving investment landscape with clear definitions and evidence. I hope many investors will read it, discover the power in the paradox, and use the principles to reclaim prosperity for all.\n\n—Tammira Philippe, CFA, President and CEO, Bridgeway Capital Management\n\nAs investors increasingly look to align their holdings with their ESG preferences, it’s important to look beyond ESG branding and evaluate whether a fund focused on environmental, social, or governance objectives meets specific, individual goals and desires. Your Essential Guide to Sustainable Investing by Sam Adams and Larry Swedroe provides key tools to help optimize this evaluation process and guide investors to their preferred destination.\n\n—Dave Butler, Co-CEO, Dimensional Fund Advisors\n\nA central question facing investors is whether to embrace so-called environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment products. The temptation to have a positive impact on societal problems like climate change and social justice is overwhelming. Virtually every asset manager has responded with ESG-labeled products. Swedroe and Adams have carefully analyzed this difficult decision and whether the costs to investors outweigh the psychic and monetary benefits of ESG investing.\n\n—Robert Huebscher, CEO, Advisor Perspectives\n\nLarry dedicates this book to the memory of Larry Goldfarb, the best friend one could have\n\nAlso by Larry Swedroe\n\nWhat Wall Street Doesn’t Want You to Know: How You Can Build Real Wealth Investing in Index Funds\n\nRational Investing in Irrational Times: How to Avoid the Costly Mistakes Even Smart People Make Today\n\nThe Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You’ll Ever Need: The Way Smart Money Invests Today\n\nThe Only Guide to a Winning Bond Strategy You’ll Ever Need: The Way Smart Money Preserves Wealth Today\n\nThe Successful Investor Today: 14 Simple Truths You Must Know When You Invest\n\nWise Investing Made Simple: Larry Swedroe’s Tales to Enrich Your Future\n\nThe Only Guide to Alternative Investments You’ll Ever Need: The Good, the Flawed, the Bad, and the Ugly\n\nWise Investing Made Simpler: Larry Swedroe’s Tales to Enrich Your Future\n\nThe Only Guide You’ll Ever Need for the Right Financial Plan: Managing Your Wealth, Risk, and Investments\n\nInvestment Mistakes Even Smart Investors Make and How to Avoid Them\n\nThe Quest for Alpha: The Holy Grail of Investing\n\nThink, Act, and Invest Like Warren Buffett: The Winning Strategy to Help You Achieve Your Financial and Life Goals\n\nYour Complete Guide to Factor-Based Investing: The Way Smart Money Invests Today\n\nReducing the Risk of Black Swans: Using the Science of Investing to Capture Returns with Less Volatility\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking Alpha: How to be a successful investor without picking winners\n\nYour Complete Guide to a Successful and Secure Retirement: The definitive resource for anyone entering retirement\n\nAbout the authors\n\nLarry Swedroe\n\nLarry Swedroe is the chief research officer for Buckingham Strategic Wealth and Buckingham Strategic Partners.

According to Bloomberg Intelligence, global assets with presumptive environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives may surpass $41 trillion in 2022 and $50 trillion by 2025 (more than a third of the total funds under management). The financial industry has responded by providing a plethora of new ESG funds and by rebranding existing funds. Such funds are advertised as helping to achieve a more sustainable world while enhancing investment retu rns as well.\n\nThere is clearly a strong demand by investors to ensure that their investments are consistent with their ethical principles. In addition to meeting financial goals, there are potential emotional benefits from investing. People want to align their investment strategies with their societal values. It would also be unambiguously advantageous if they could push the firms in which they invest to improve societal outcomes while simultaneously enhancing their financial returns. But do the investment products that advertise themselves as ESG-compliant actually deliver? How do you know if your investments will have the desired social impact? And is sustainable investing really a way to assure investors they can do well by doing good?\n\nAmid all the hype concerning sustainable investing, there has been far too little attention paid to careful analysis of exactly what such investing really entails and what the evidence shows about its effectiveness. There is also far too little serviceable advice for investors who wish to invest sustainably. Adams and Swedroe have brilliantly fulfilled these needs with their highly readable and evidence-based guide for investors. Here they show what sustainable investing is, why one might want to do it, what financial returns have been achieved, and what its impact has been, as well as the pitfalls that exist. They also provide practical investment advice for individuals wishing to build ESG portfolios.\n\nWe learn that meritorious investments are in the eye of the beholder. The objectives of faith-based investment funds are far different from those that prize enhancing the goals of fair pay and inclusiveness. The most common and popular of such funds are those with explicit ESG objectives. But even then, the term means different things to different people, and it is difficult for investors to understand exactly what the ESG portfolios actually achieve. To make matters worse, the ESG scores for different companies published by the professional rating services provided to portfolio managers differ materially. Correlations of ratings between different rating services are as low as 0.42. To put that number in perspective, the correlations between the bond ratings of S&P and Moody’s are more than 0.99. ESG raters cannot even agree when they are considering the same attribute, such as carbon intensity. Within the electric utility industry, a company with one of the biggest carbon footprints is Xcel Energy. Xcel is ranked poorly by some raters because it generates a substantial share of its power from coal. But Xcel is the first U.S. utility committed to going 100 percent carbon-free by 2050 and is a leader in building wind-generation facilities.\n\nESG ratings also differ markedly for companies for which carbon footprint is not a major factor. Apple gets a high ESG rating of 73 percent from Refinitiv. S&P Global rates them only 23 percent and close to the bottom of their 22-company industry. Even on the identical ESG component of governance, ratings are not even close to one another. Sustainalytics considers Apple’s management among the most compliant with the best governance criteria, while MSCI considers Apple’s governance score second to last in its peer group.\n\nIf carbon footprint and governance are major factors in excluding companies from a broad ESG portfolio, what kinds of companies are favored for investment? Examining the top holdings in the largest ESG mutual funds and ETFs, we find Alphabet (Google’s parent) and Facebook, as well as Visa and MasterCard, prominently featured. These companies have had their fair share of controversies. Would all ESG investors really have their social consciences assuaged by investing in companies that have been found to breach individual privacy and impose exorbitant interest rates?\n\nWhat about the returns from sustainable investing? The authors do a masterful job of meticulously documenting the existing empirical studies. There is no better survey of the returns from ESG investing. Again, the studies do not suggest a clear conclusion. Some studies report market-beating risk-adjusted returns, while others come to the opposite conclusion. There is no unambiguous evidence that sustainable investing enhances long-run financial performance. Moreover, sustainable funds have higher management expenses than traditional index funds. The authors do believe, however, that avoiding certain companies can reduce so-called tail risk—the risk, for example, that a company that cannot or will not curtail its polluting activities could be severely harmed by government fiat. Thus, ESG investing can be a risk-reducing strategy.\n\nOne of the very important insights in this book concerns the differences we should expect between short- and long-run returns. This insight can help explain some of the different empirical results. A heightened demand for ESG-compliant investments can cause share prices to rise and thus enhance the returns of sustainable funds. But then so-called green stocks will sell at higher valuation multiples and lower long-run required rates of return. Thus, any short-term benefits will be realized at the expense of long-run performance. Investors who wish to invest sustainably should have reasonable expectations, including a willingness to accept lower long-run returns.\n\nA further important insight concerns the likelihood that an ESG influence on share prices will affect corporate behavior. If ESG-compliant companies enjoy higher share prices and a lower cost of capital, then they will be incentivized to improve their ESG ratings. Thus, a focus on sustainable investing can cause companies to behave in a more positive manner.\n\nAdams and Swedroe then turn to a survey of the empirical evidence on whether sustainable investing is actually making companies more responsible. They cite a number of studies that suggest that ESG concerns by investors have had a positive effect in encouraging firms to take actions that have positive societal impacts,"
