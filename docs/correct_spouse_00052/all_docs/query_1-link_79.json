Then, when I started seeing pictures of Chris Hemsworth in real life, carrying around his cute little baby, my brain pretty much exploded. We're all going to be seeing a lot of Chris Hemsworth this fall because his new movie Rush hits theaters today, and Thor: The Dark World comes out November 8. And wherever Chris Hemsworth goes, his wife Elsa Pataky goes too. And that brings me to the subject of this post. Naturally, when you are happily married to one of the hottest men in Hollywood, people are going to be curious about you. I expected Pataky would be hot, but I didn't expect to find out that she may also have mythical powers. She's been adored by not one, not two, but three famous men and basically seems like the coolest person ever. Let me explain: Pataky is 37. Seven years older than Hemsworth, 30. He doesn't care. (Point one for the thirtysomethings!) As if being with one total smokeshow wasn't enough, Pataky previously dated Olivier Martinez, yet another most-wanted male of our generation. TWO! But it",

And wherever Chris Hemsworth goes, his wife Elsa Pataky goes too. And that brings me to the subject of this post.\n\nNaturally, when you are happily married to one of the hottest men in Hollywood, people are going to be curious about you. I expected Pataky would be hot, but I didn't expect to find out that she may also have mythical powers. She's been adored by not one, not two, but three famous men and basically seems like the coolest person ever. Let me explain:\n\nPataky is 37. Seven years older than Hemsworth, 30. He doesn't care. (Point one for the thirtysomethings!)\n\nAs if being with one total smokeshow wasn't enough, Pataky previously dated Olivier Martinez, yet another most-wanted male of our generation. TWO! But it doesn't end there.\n\nBefore meeting Martinez, Pataky dated Adrien Brody pretty seriously. THREE! For her birthday, he BOUGHT HER A CASTLE. A castle. I'm not kidding, a legit castle.\n\nHello! Magazine Canada did a whole spread on the lovebirds and their castle back in 2008, and Brody reportedly gushed about Pataky, \"The first time I saw her I was completely spellbound.\"\n\nHemsworth also isn't shy about gushing over Pataky, and reportedly told the Daily Mail, \"She's always smiling. She's a lot of fun to be around.\"\n\nIf you were wondering just how fun she is to be around, here she is enjoying a waterslide off the side of a yacht in St. Bart's last year, looking better in a bikini than most (non-pregnant) 21-year-olds do.\n\nWhen you add up all of these facts, Elsa Pataky is pretty much the boss of everyone. As a virtually unknown Spanish actress, she quietly moved in and started dating some of the most desirable men in the business. And now she's married to one who is seven years younger. And she has a baby. And a castle?\n\nDid you know any of these facts about Pataky before today? Are you as mystified by her as I am? Let me know if you were surprised about anything!\n\nPhoto: Getty Images"
