Then there’s the neighbors’ complaints about the size of the house, the aesthetics, the impact on their town, etc.\n\nSo, how is he dealing with all this criticism? By throwing his wife under the bus!\n\nHe says that he would be happy living in a modest home, but she was the one who kept adding rooms so the plans just got bigger and bigger until it was three or four times the size he wanted. He can’t say no to her.\n\nSo it’s her fault the house is so big? We don’t know if he can’t say no because he wants to indulge her… or because she is the one wearing the pants in the family!\n\nSimilar: They Do Not Live Together\n\nActor/Wife:\n\n[Optional] What is the biggest house (in square feet) that you think you would feel comfortable living in?"
