        "text": "HARVEY Weinstein's ex-wife, Georgina Chapman, and her boyfriend, Adrien Brody, cozied up during a trip to Los Angeles with the designer’s two children.\n\nThough the couple have been linked since last year, the Marchesa co-founder and Oscar-winning actor just made their public debut together at last week’s Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nThe pair landed at Los Angeles International Airport from NYC on Wednesday with Georgina’s two kids she shares with the disgraced movie mogul - daughter India, 10, and son Dashiell, 8.\n\nAfter the duo touched down, Adrien, 48, was seen with his hands all over the 45-year-old Project Runway star.\n\nAs they walked from the airport to the parking garage, the Pianist star had his arm wrapped around Georgina - who held his hand tight.\n\nBoth of them wore face masks and continued to keep physical contact throughout their walk.\n\nShe rocked a green bomber jacket, white plunging v-neck and jeans while her new man wore a similar colored camo sweater.\n\nThe adults were accompanied by the mom-of-two’s son and daughter - signifying their relationship appears to be getting serious.\n\nShe met her new man through her ex-husband after Adrien starred in two Miramax productions, Hollywoodland and Jailbreakers.\n\nGeorgina moved on from her doomed marriage to convicted sex offender Harvey, 69, with Adrien two years after her divorce.\n\nIn 2017, Harvey sparked the #MeToo movement following a multitude of shocking revelations, accusations of rape and other sexual misconduct throughout Hollywood.\n\nHowever, Adrien has also been accused of inappropriate behavior pertaining to #MeToo.\n\nAt the 2003 Oscars, Adrien won for his role in The Pianist which was presented by fellow Academy Award winner, Halle Berry.\n\nWhen he went to accept the trophy on stage, the film star shocked everyone when he grabbed Halle, 54, without consent and KISSED her on the lips.\n\nThe move caused a lot of controversy and as recently as last year, Halle admits to having “no idea what the f**k was going on” during the encounter.\n\nAdditionally, many fans have expressed outrage for Adrien’s work with directors who have numerous accusations of sexual assault.\n\nHis award-winning movie, The Pianist, was directed by fugitive Roman Polanski - who fled the country in 1978 while awaiting sentencing for unlawful intercourse with a minor.\n\nA decade later, he would go on to have a role in 2011’s Midnight In Paris - written and directed by Woody Allen.\n\nIn recent years, many Hollywood stars claimed they would NOT work with Woody, 85, after years of claims from Dylan Farrow that her mom Mia's partner at the time “sexually abused” her as a child.\n\nGeorgina left husband Harvey in 2017 when the sexual assault allegations against him first came to light.\n\nShe said in a statement at the time: “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions.\n\n“I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”\n\nLast month, a judge ruled for Harvey to be transferred from NYC to LA in the first two weeks of July to face MORE sex assault charges.\n\nHe is currently serving a 23-year prison term following his February 2020 conviction in Manhattan for sexually assaulting a production assistant in 2006, and third-degree rape of an aspiring actress in 2013.\n\nThe shunned producer is appealing his conviction and sentence, and has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone."
