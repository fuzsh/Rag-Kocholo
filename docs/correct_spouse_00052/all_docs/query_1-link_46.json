        "text": "Elsa Pataky has been on the scene long before she met and married actor Chris Hemsworth in 2010. She’s had a robust career in entertainment: She’s been a model, actress and film producer, with a net worth estimated at around 5 million dollars.\n\nShe’s an actress\n\nIn addition to her Spanish film credits, Pataky has appeared in in the French film Iznogoud; the Mexican series Mujeres Asesinas; several action films, including Dario Agento’s Giallo; Snakes on a Plane; Fast Five; Fast and Furious 6; and Furious 7. She was named a Breakout Star to Watch for in 2011 by MTV Networks’ NextMovie.com.\n\nShe’s a model\n\nPataky appeared on the August 2006 cover of Maxim and was the face of Time Force’s jewelry line Ultimate Jewel. She’s also graced the covers of Spanish Elle, Glamour, Cosmopolitan, GQ and Telva.\n\nShe’s a big deal in Spain\n\nPataky has repeatedly been voted one of the most beautiful women in Spain, where she appeared in more than 10 films, was a member of the Madrid theatre company Teatro Cámara de Ángel Gutiérrez and starred in the television series’ Queen of Swords and Los Serrano.\n\n“Doing a Pataky” is a thing\n\nIn her native Spain, the phrase “hacer un Pataky” (“to do a Pataky”) means to pose in a way that shows off your assets. It was coined after Pataky was photographed numerous times looking over her shoulder on the red carpet while clad in a backless dress that showed off her bottom.\n\nShe was Natalie Portman’s stand-in\n\nThe final scene of Thor: The Dark World features a passionate kiss between Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), but Pataky filled in for Portman when a scheduling conflict arose.\n\nShe’s fluent in five languages\n\nIn addition to her native Spanish, Pataky is fluent in English, French, Romanian and Italian.\n\nShe and Miley Cyrus have matching tattoos\n\nIn April, Pataky and Cyrus, who’s dating Chris Hemsworth’s brother, Liam, got matching small wave tattoos in black ink.\n\nAdrien Brody bought her a castle\n\nPataky dated Oscar-winner Brody from 2006 until 2009. The actor bought her a 19th century estate in upstate New York in 2008, when HELLO magazine did a 35-page spread on the couple.\n\nShe studied journalism in college\n\nPataky studied at Spain’s CEU San Pablo University, where she majored in journalism and took acting classes.\n\nShe will not feed her husband’s ego\n\n“Of course I think he’s beautiful and fit,” said Pataky, in an interview with Express in 2015. “But I will never tell him that, because he will get too, how do you say, ‘cocky’?”\n\nShe’s not afraid of bulking up\n\n“I always admire sports bodies in women,” said Pataky. She’s not deterred by the media’s criticism of women with athletic bodies. “Even when other people say, ‘Oh, she’s too muscly,’ I always like it… I like to get as close to that as I can.”\n\nShe wrote a book\n\nPataky and her trainer, Fernando Sartorius (who’s also worked with Nicole Kidman and Halle Berry), wrote a book together called Intensity Max, which promises to get you in great shape in 90 days.\n\nShe can sing\n\nIn the 2014 commercial for the Spanish lingerie brand Women’s Secret, Pataky portrayed a rock star, covering The Pointer Sisters’ hit “I’m So Excited.”\n\nShe’s super into yoga\n\nPataky does yoga three or four times a week and attributes her overall fitness to it: “Yoga teaches you to be the master of yourself.”\n\nShe’s older than her husband\n\nPataky, born July 18, 1976, is 39, seven years older than Hemsworth, who’s 32.\n\nShe prioritizes her marriage\n\nPataky and Hemsworth, now parents of three children, try not to be apart for more than two weeks at a time, so each is careful about the roles they take on. “We both make an effort and give up things. When you have a baby, you really have to change the way you view life.”\n\nShe’s an only child\n\nPataky, born Elsa Lafuente Medianu, is the only child of Cristina Pataky Medianu, a publicist of Romanian and Hungarian ancestry, and José Francisco Lafuente, a Spanish biochemist.\n\nShe likes to do her own stunts\n\nThe Fast & Furious 6 star once jumped two stories into a moving garbage truck without cushioning and without a stunt double."
