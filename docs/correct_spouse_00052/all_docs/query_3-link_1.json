        "text": "Alison Brie and Dave Franco\n\nAlison Brie and Dave Franco are easily comedy’s favourite It-couple. Each hilarious on their own, the comedy duo have won over the hearts of Hollywood, and met in an incredibly realistic way. “It starts off in New Orleans at Mardi Gras, where all great love stories begin,” Brie recalled on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. “It’s a very romantic story and very sweet.”\n\n“It was some incredible matchmaking done by my friend Jules, after we ran into Dave at the airport.” She continued: “He was sitting next to her across the [dinner] table and…my friend texts me under the table and says ‘You should hook up with Dave’…and I responded with ‘Yes please’ with a lot of thumbs up emojis.”\n\nShe admitted that Jules actually showed Dave the text. “He was like ‘I’m in!'” Since then, the pair have been married since March 2017.\n\nEmily Blunt and John Krasinski\n\nBlunt and Krasinski are at the top of most people’s lists of couples that can never break up. While Krasinski has openly gushed about his affection for his wife—they were married in 2010—Blunt has been a little more tight-lipped. And it was only recently that she revealed exactly how they got together.\n\n“It’s kind of a sad, lame story,” she told Seth Meyers on his show. “I mean it’s not sad, but it’s just kind of lame. I was in a restaurant; he was in the restaurant. I was sitting with a mutual friend—this is our romantic comedy. This is it—write it! My friend goes, ‘Oh my God, there’s my friend John.’ And that was it! It’s cinema gold. He was actually sitting with our friend Justin Theroux. He abandoned Justin and came over to talk to us. He did not eat, he just stood there and made me laugh.”\n\nDid she know Krasinski was The One straight away? “I kind of did,” Blunt admitted. The couple now has two young daughters, Hazel and Violet.\n\nJessica Biel and Justin Timberlake\n\nBiel and Timberlake met shortly after his split with Cameron Diaz, who now dates Benji Madden. Timberlake told a press conference: “It was very un-Hollywood-esque, in fact. We met and got talking. Afterwards I asked my friend if I could call her and ask her out. My friend called Jessica and Jessica said yes, and so I called her. I did it the old fashioned way—by telephone.”\n\nKate Hudson and Matt Bellamy\n\nHudson and Bellamy “met” when Hudson became separated from her friends at Coachella in 2010, and Bellamy offered to accompany her while she found them. Once chatting they realised they’d actually met years prior while both in Australia. Bellamy asked for her number and they started dating before becoming engaged and having a son together in 2011. They were never to be wed, ending their relationship in December 2014.\n\nNicole Richie and Joel Madden\n\nRichie and Madden were friends before they started dating in 2006, with Madden telling 60 Minutes in 2013: “I’m always like, ‘Just give me a shot, just give me one date.’ If I can get my foot in the door, that’s how it’s always been with girls. I’ve never been the obvious [choice].” They had two children and married in December of 2010."
