        "text": "Elsa Pataky is a Spanish actor-model. Her rise to fame was with the Spanish TV show Al Salir de Clase. The actress has gone on to be a part of many other films as well as franchises since then. Pataky became one of the highest-paid models until she put her career on the backseat to take care of her family, including her three children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe actress-model is currently married to the MCU Thor actor, Chris Hemsworth. The couple has been together for 13 years and has three children. Their marriage had its rough patches just like every couple, but they bounced back and showed the world what true love really looks like.\n\nAlso Read: “He wanted nothing to do with it”: Why Thor 4 Star Chris Hemsworth Banned Wife Elsa Pataky From Posing Naked For Playboy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdrien Brody Bought Elsa Pataky a Castle\n\nBefore Chris Hemsworth, Elsa Pataky was dating actor Adrien Brody. The two first met in 2006, and Brody was completely smitten at first sight, to the point that he became uncomfortable “because she was so beautiful and so lovely and sweet.”\n\nBrody asked the actress out to dinner in Spain, and they went on a date in a cozy little restaurant. After that night, it wasn’t long before the two got together and started making red-carpet appearances as a couple.\n\nIn an interview with Hello Magazine, Brody went on to openly profess his love for Pataky, and gush about their relationship like they shared a love for the ages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We both feel really blessed to have found someone that we not only love, that we are deeply attracted to, but also who shares similar views on life. Elsa has brought so much positive energy into my life.”\n\nThe couple had gotten engaged only a few months before the Hello Magazine interview came out, and were together for roughly two years before they parted ways.\n\nIn the time they were together, Adrien Brody purchased the historic Stone Barn Castle in New York, where he wanted to create a “permanent place for himself”. The actor felt adrift after his role in Brothers Bloom, which led him to purchase the mansion. He was very clear on the fact that this was the home he would grow old with Pataky in. After purchasing the castle, Brody began the extensive renovation process but the couple ended up splitting before it could be completed.\n\nNeither of them made any public statements, but Brody eventually referred to it in an interview with the Huffington Post in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We are all looking for a sense of home, we all have dreams and aspirations, and then life sometimes does not happen the way we expect it to. There are many blessings within all of that and there are obstacles to overcome. My life has been enriched by all these beautiful people who have been in my life.”\n\nAlso Read: Who is Elsa Pataky: Chris Hemsworth’s Wife Net Worth, How They Met, All About Their Love\n\nElsa Pataky and Chris Hemsworth’s Relationship\n\nA few months after her split with Brody, Elsa Pataky started seeing Chris Hemsworth. Since then, the couple has not let go of each other, and are very much in love.\n\nThey recently worked together on Netflix’s new action-adventure- Interceptor. The film is focused on Pataky’s character, but her husband has had some hilarious cameos in the film. The actress had to go through intense physical training for months to prepare for her role. Hemsworth is the producer of Interceptor, and while he is used to playing the hero, he took to the behind-the-scenes role quite easily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince the film made its debut, Interceptor has already topped Netflix US weekly charts.\n\nAlso Read: “That’s why it was so passionate”: The Real Reason Chris Hemsworth Didn’t Kiss Natalie Portman In Thor: The Dark World\n\nSource: The Things"
