        "text": "Family first.\n\nAt least, that has been the motto for many parents in Hollywood.\n\nThey’re the ones who worked their busy schedules around their kids and not the other way around.\n\nSome even made the ultimate sacrifice by giving up the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for their kids. Talk about dedication!\n\nHere are 10+ of these all-star parents!\n\nA lot of celebrities love what they do, but don’t necessarily think the environment of Hollywood is a good one to raise children in.\n\nAfter all, Hollywood is a place where paparazzi storm the streets, and fans are always ready to crowd you, no matter how busy you may seem.\n\nBut these celebrities don’t have time for all of that.\n\nIn fact, the ones we’re about to mention decided to take their kids and flee to another place in order to give them something resembling a normal life!\n\nLet’s get into it!\n\n1. Demi Moore and Bruce Willis\n\nBack when the couple was still married, they took a hiatus from the Hollywood craziness to raise their three daughters, Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah.\n\nThey did so by moving to a small town in Idaho until the girls were older.\n\n2. Meghan Markle\n\nThese two made the ultimate sacrifice for their child: they gave up being royals .\n\nThey are currently residing in Los Angeles with their son, Archie, where they are, no doubt, enjoying being away from the British media.\n\n3. Cameron Diaz\n\nWhile she originally retired from Hollywood in 2014, she soon went on to secretly have her first child with her husband, Benji Madden!\n\nThe experience of being a mom has completely changed her for the better.\n\n“I love being a mother. It’s the best, best, best part of my life,” she said on an Instagram Live back in April.\n\n“I’m so grateful and so happy and it’s the best thing ever and I’m so lucky to do it with Benj and we’re having the best time. I’m thrilled. I can’t believe it.”\n\n4. Mark Ruffalo\n\nOnce the Marvel actor starting having kids with his wife, Sunrise Coigney, they decided to leave Hollywood for a small city called Callicoon.\n\n“It’s pretty much a blue-collar community, a farming community,” he told OK Magazine.\n\n“I wanted my children to have that experience.”\n\nMark was also tired of the rat race of trying to make it as an actor.\n\nHe liked the fact that he was treated like everyone else in Callicoon — “no favoritism or anything like that,” he said.\n\n5. Julia Roberts\n\nThe actress had a huge shift in priorities as soon as she started having kids with her husband.\n\n“She learned to be assertive about letting industry people know her work was no longer her priority,” a source told Closer Weekly .\n\n6. Rick Moranis\n\nThe Honey, I Shrunk the Kids actor left his successful career as an actor as a way to do right by his kids.\n\nThat’s because his wife, Ann Belsky, tragically died of cancer in 1991.\n\nSuddenly, Moranis found himself the single father of two small children.\n\n“I’m a single parent and I just found that it was too difficult to manage to raise my kids and to do the traveling involved in making movies,” he said in an interview with USA Today .\n\nThis break eventually turned permanent.\n\n“So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn’t miss it.”\n\n7. Candace Cameron Bure\n\nWith her husband and three kids, Natasha, Lev, and Maksim, it’s always a full house for the Fuller House star.\n\nWhen she took a break from acting, it may have had something to do with her ” submissive ” approach to marriage and family.\n\nShe wrote about this in her book, *Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose*.\n\n“I am not a passive person, but I chose to fall into a more submissive role in our relationship because I wanted to do everything in my power to make my marriage and family work.”\n\n8. Robin Wright\n\nBack when she was married to Sean Penn, the family moved to northern California for their two kids.\n\n“I didn’t want to raise my kids in this weird, sycophantic society,” she told Entertainment Weekly .\n\n“If you have celebrity parents, it’s not a good recipe for the kids, or anyone at any age.”\n\nShe even brought up what former couple, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, went through.\n\nIn the end, Robin and Sean split and she returned to Hollywood.\n\n9. Michael Schoeffling\n\nAfter starring as the heartthrob Sixteen Candles alongside Molly Ringwald, Schoeffling had a promising career ahead of him.\n\nInstead, though, he quit Hollywood to become a carpenter and raise his two children.\n\n10. Halle Berry\n\nIn this Instagram post, the actress shared how she didn’t “disappear” from Hollywood; she “traded” in her life for a normal one instead.\n\nThis has largely included raising her two children, Nahla and Maceo.\n\n11. Elsa Patsky and Chris Hemsworth\n\nShe currently resides in Byron Bay, Australia with Chris and their three kids: India Rose and twins Sasha and Tristan.\n\nThe model told Vogue Australia that she found the fast pace of Hollywood to be at odds with her goal of building a family.\n\n“I feel Hollywood consumes you in such a way that it feels like work all the time,” she said.\n\nShe continued on, saying that, “I think when you’re in it you don’t even realize but when you get out, it changes everything.”\n\n12. Shania Twain\n\nTwain ended up moving to Switzerland in order to focus on her family and well being.\n\nIt didn’t matter that she was at the height of her career! She did what would be good for her family in the long run.\n\n13. Cary Grant\n\nThe legendary actor retired at the age of 62, in order to focus completely on raising his family.\n\nBy that point, he had already made his mark on cinema, so the actor truly had nothing to lose.\n\n14. Kellie Shanygne Jackson\n\nOnce her time playing Laura Winslow on Family Matters was over, she decided to leave the business in order to focus on her marriage and husband.\n\nHollywood just was not as important to her as her family!\n\n15. Dave Chapelle\n\nChapelle shocked a lot of people when he chose to leave his show, but he did it for his family.\n\nHe told Consequence of Sound , “I’ll go home and make the kids some integrity sandwiches; it makes no sense at all. There’s nothing anyone can say.”\n\n“It’s just you do what you feel like you need to do. It’s a very complicated answer because I felt a variety of ways over the last years. Whenever there’s something I’d like to have that I could have afforded but I can’t now, then I’m upset about it.”\n\n“But then when I see a guy who goes to a job that’s time consuming and he doesn’t have free time to do things I get to do, then I feel good about it.”\n\n16. Elizabeth Hurley\n\nBefore Hurley made her return in Gossip Girl the British actress took some time off in order to raise her son Damian in England.\n\nOnce she spent enough time away, she returned to the screen.\n\nDo you know of any other celebrities who took their children away from Hollywood?\n\nIf you were a celebrity, would you take your children away from Hollywood?\n\nEither way, let us know down below in the comment section! We would love to hear from you!"
