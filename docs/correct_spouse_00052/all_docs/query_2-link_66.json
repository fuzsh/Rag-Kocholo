        "text": "Adrien Brody just wants to have fun. So what if on this February afternoon, he and Sarah Polley are frantically crashing through some fake midnight woods on the Toronto set of the science-fiction thriller Splice - they play married genetic researchers - searching for a creature they've bred that may be a murderous abomination? Compared with the emotional states Brody usually works in - frozen in grief for The Darjeeling Limited, insane in The Jacket, skeletal for The Pianist, for which he won the 2002 best-actor Oscar - this is a romp.\n\n\"I think it's important to remain connected to the more difficult things that people face,\" he says later in his trailer, gingerly bobbing a tea bag in a cup of scalding water. At 34, Brody is tall and skinny, with basset-hound eyes and a magnificent nose. His voice is as gritty as the concrete of his native Queens, N.Y., and he could convincingly play Ichabod Crane or Frederic Chopin right here and now, without changing his black jeans and boots. \"But becoming a character affects me deeply, so I have to choose wisely. If it's a state of mind that is challenging to be in, that's something you have to be prepared to give or you shouldn't embark on that journey.\"\n\nBrody is prepared to give. While playing the title character in The Pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who hid alone in the Warsaw ghetto throughout the Holocaust, Brody lost so much weight that he altered his metabolism and fell into \"a sadness I couldn't escape,\" he says. \"I had a much greater understanding of the level of suffering that people have endured. And still endure - atrocities, genocides. The loss I felt was so profound. I didn't know how to process it or let go of it.\"\n\nIt had a positive outcome, though. \"Overcoming all of that really changed me; it made me\" - he pauses for a second - \"more of a man,\" Brody says. \"It made me understand a lot about life and appreciate everything. There was a moment after I came back, I was in New York, 2 in the morning, I'd been out for a drink with some friends and I was walking home, and I wanted a slice of pizza. So I went to a pizzeria, I ate a few bites and I almost cried. I felt so grateful to have the ability to have it when I wanted it, to have money in my pocket to afford it. The simple thing of having a slice of pizza that we take for granted - it meant so much to me. I think it's good to feel that way in your 20s. These are things that a lot of people in prior generations have dealt with, but unless you've suffered tremendously, in my generation you're not thinking in those terms.\"\n\nThe Pianist also gave Brody an Oscar-acceptance moment for the record books, when he bent Halle Berry backward in a kiss. \"I was just so full. There was so much love in the room. It just felt right. It felt, 'She's in trouble.' \" He laughs. \"Come on, what else is there to do? It was such a long journey, and the odds were completely against me. (He is the youngest best-actor winner ever, and all four of his fellow nominees were previous Oscar winners.)\n\n\"And there was this beautiful woman standing there with my award. I'm not going do some polite little thing on the cheek, come on!\" Guys still stop him on the street to say how jealous they are.\n\nSo how does an actor this committed do his job and still protect himself? \"It's a good question,\" Brody says. \"I never consider protecting myself once I'm playing a role. Emotionally, you have to do the opposite. You have to be vulnerable. You have to not be afraid to incorporate your own ugliness or joy - exacerbate your own sadness with a character's sadness. If I can't feel connected on a pretty deep level, it's not truthful. Why would I expect someone in the audience to believe me if I don't believe me? You have to make it touch you, and sometimes that's not safe.\"\n\nHe credits his parents - his mother is the photographer Sylvia Plachy and his father, Elliot Brody, taught history - with teaching him to be \"very aware of moments that live within a moment. My father's an incredibly intelligent and thoughtful man, and my mother is an artist and a deep human being. The beauty of her work as a photographer is that she sees so much within something that is a normal daily occurrence. I view the world in a similar way and perhaps I convey that through my work. And there is something very therapeutic about acting, if you can find worth in your own suffering and share it.\n\n\"Of course, not every film is art,\" he continues. \"It's difficult to create magic. But the filmmaking process is creative, and the process of being an actor is an artistic process - if you do the work. Without sounding pretentious, trying to understand, and bring out, and connect to something that's not you, is deep. Maybe art isn't the right word, but it's trying to connect with humanity. Something beyond me and my limitations.\"\n\nWith Splice, however, Brody is \"giving myself a rest from that. Even though we live in a time that something like this [genetic experimentation]is not only possible but potentially happening - which makes it extra frightening - it's easier to be playful with this. It's dramatic stuff, and yet fun.\"\n\nStill, one gets the sense that Brody's idea of fun is more layered than most people's. Asked about making The Darjeeling Limited, writer/director Wes Anderson's tale of three brothers who reconnect after their father's death by journeying through India, Brody pulls up a genuine life-and-death moment.\n\nThe cast and crew celebrated Christmas in a remote, impoverished village with a group dinner outdoors atop a colossal rock. \"It was such a spiritual place, it felt more moving than most Christmases,\" Brody remembers. \"There were all these lovely children there, tagging along with us, asking questions, playing with their kites. Very simple. After dinner, my girlfriend [the Spanish actress Elsa Pataky]and I rode home in the back of a pickup truck. I was standing on the truck bed, feeling adventurous, looking into her eyes, and a low-hanging power line went under my throat and almost took me out. I literally almost died gazing into her eyes on Christmas. A moment like that, on a day I was also a little more open, that affected me. Because living and embracing life - you never know. You just never know how it will end.\"\n\nCareer highlights\n\nAt 29, Adrien Brody became the youngest actor to win the best-actor Academy Award, beating out Oscar veterans Nicolas Cage, Jack Nicholson, Daniel Day-Lewis and Michael Caine. Since then, his career has taken him from the Warsaw ghetto to remote villages to mysterious islands inhabited by dinosaurs and one giant ape. A look at his more prominent roles:\n\nThe Pianist (2002)\n\nWon an Oscar for his portrayal of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew struggling to stay alive in the Warsaw ghetto during the Holocaust.\n\nThe Village (2004)\n\nPlays the doomed, lovestruck, mentally challenged character of Noah Percy in M. Night Shyamalan's movie about a population of isolated villagers who have a shaky alliance with mythical creatures that inhabit the forests around them.\n\nKing Kong (2005)\n\nTravels to director Peter Jackson's Skull Island as Jack Driscoll, a playwright who falls in love with leading lady Ann Darrow, only to have to rescue her from the clutches of a giant gorilla.\n\nThe Darjeeling Limited (2007)\n\nPlays Peter Whitman, one of three Whitman brothers who set off on a train voyage across India in an elaborate bonding exercise that doesn't quite turn out as planned."
