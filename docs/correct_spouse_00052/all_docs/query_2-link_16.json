        "text": "Harvey Weinstein is said to be very unhappy while he stews behind bars in Rome, New York, that his former wife Georgina Chapman is dating actor Adrien Brody.\n\nBrody won the Oscar for best actor in The Pianist in 2002, and starred in two of the disgraced movie mogul’s films: Hollywoodland with Ben Affleck and Diane Lane in 2006 and Jailbreakers with Shannon Doherty in 1994.\n\nWeinstein’s ex-wife and mother of his two young children (nine and 12) was seen getting very cozy with Brody last week in St. Tropez at the chic Club 55.\n\nChapman, in a sexy orange dress, was almost unrecognisable because she’s gone blonde. Brody wore a black tank top and camo pants.\n\nAlso seen at the lunch spot were David and Victoria Beckham’s son Brooklyn Beckham with his new bride Nicola Peltz Beckham, and her parents, billionaire Nelson and Claudia Peltz.\n\nAs the ladies shopped at Club 55′s gift shop, Nelson Peltz was heard telling them, “Finish up, we have to get back to the boat.”\n\nThe problems of the rich and richer.\n\nAlso seen in St. Tropez were Leonardo DiCaprio and his BFF Tobey Maguire and influencer Sofie Mahlkvist. – New York Daily News/Tribune News Service"
