        "text": "Brody, the youngest man ever to win the best actor Oscar, returns to enchanted conjuring and sleight of hand with \"The Brothers Bloom,” writer-director Rian Johnson’s (\"Brick”) con men caper that mixes first-rate trickery and magical realism.\n\n\"There should always be an emotional truth no matter what, but I am drawn to a kind of lighter material at the moment, just because it feels good. It just feels good to take that home at night and to work with that and to try to bring some truth to that and yet at the same time maintain the humor. So that’s kind of what I was drawn to,” Brody said in a question-and-answer session after a screening of the film this spring at the AFI Dallas International Film Festival.\n\nThe thespian, who won his Oscar in 2003 for the Holocaust drama \"The Pianist,” also received a Dallas AFI Star Award at the screening. American Film Institute President Bob Gazzale praised Brody as an actor who keeps a shroud of mystery around him.\n\n\"This is not a man who goes on the cover of US magazine to tell us how his abs look or discuss his favorite flavor of gelato,” Gazzale said. \"In the search to solve the mystery, I have heard people say, ‘He’s the next Robert De Niro. He’s the next Al Pacino. No, he’s ‘The Amazing Adrien.’”\n\nFor his latest cinematic act, Brody, 36, plays Bloom, who with his older brother Stephen (Mark Ruffalo) makes up the wildly successful con men combo the Brothers Bloom. Since they were children, Stephen has written fantastic schemes with the philosophy that in the best cons, everyone wins, even the mark. And Bloom plays the starring role in every story his sibling concocts.\n\nBut Bloom longs to leave the business and live \"an unwritten life.” So, Stephen plots one last big job, assigning Bloom to instigate a relationship with eccentric heiress Penelope Stamp (Rachel Weisz) so they can bilk her. With the help of their silent but deadly partner Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi), the brothers soon sweep Penelope away on what she believes to be a grand adventure. But Bloom seems in danger of being swept away himself by the sweetly fetching Penelope.\n\nIn accepting the Dallas award, Brody showed a quick, dry wit, a self-deprecating humor and a gift for mime. After the microphone cut out repeatedly, he mimed through a few introductory thank yous, pretending the mike again wasn’t working. He also explained how his parents keep him grounded.\n\n\"When I told my parents that I was gonna be honored with the Dallas Star Award ... my mother immediately said, ‘You’re gonna be a star?’” he said with a grin. \"And then my dad pleasantly reminded me of the time we passed this young couple in Toronto, and this woman turned to the guy and she said, ‘Oh my gosh, eh, you know who that is?’ He said no. She goes, ‘That’s Adrien Brody ... he used to be huge.’”\n\nThe New York native has stayed busy since his Oscar win, performing in M. Night Shyamalan’s \"The Village,” Peter Jackson’s \"King Kong” and Darnell Martin’s \"Cadillac Records.” The only child also starred in another brother tale, Wes Anderson’s \"The Darjeeling Limited.”\n\n\"I was in India and I’d done ‘The Darjeeling Limited,’ and I was kind of on this kind of weird, trippy adventure. And then there was this kind of heightened surrealistic quality in Rian’s material that had an emotional truth but was also kind of a different adventure,” he said. \"And that’s what had attracted me. And what I discovered was something far more complex personally and more challenging than I would’ve actually liked.”\n\nAs the cast and crew traveled throughout Eastern Europe like a \"traveling circus,” Brody said he found he related a little too closely to Bloom.\n\n\"There are similarities with the way Bloom was feeling and the life of an actor. Not necessarily a correlation between the con man and an actor,” he said with a laugh. \"But the fact that you do experience all of these wonderful and creative and exciting experiences, but they’re not your own. At the end of the day, someone’s always calling cut. ... So it was very important at that time of my life to kind of take some time for myself — I’d been working a lot — and work on my life and fulfilling those things.”"
