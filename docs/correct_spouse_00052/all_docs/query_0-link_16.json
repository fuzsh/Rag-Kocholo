        "text": "From walking the Met Gala red carpet together to raising three kids back in Australia, Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky have been through it all, including fame and the Hollywood grind. As the 2024 Met Gala—where Chris serves as a cochair alongside Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Bad Bunny, and Anna Wintour—grabs our attention, we’re taking a look back at their love story.\n\nHere’s Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky’s relationship timeline, presented with the most recent updates up top.\n\nMay 6, 2024: They have arrived! Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky’s Met Gala arrival was a bright spot in the evening. The couple, whose ensembles could have just as easily fit 2022’s Gilded Glamour theme, hit the red carpet in complementary cream and gold custom Tom Ford looks.\n\nHemsworth wore a three-piece suit, styled in a very, shall we say, laidback manner. With his shirt unbuttoned to his pecs, Hemsworth gave the cameras a peek at the gold chain he wore under it all.\n\nPataky, meanwhile, wore a slinky, floor-grazing gold gown and a matching gilded headpiece. Her long blonde ponytail was giving major Rapunzel vibes—perhaps the inspiration? What’s more timeless than a fairytale?\n\nJune 2023: Hemsworth credits Pataky for helping him achieve huge career success, telling GQ, “Her sacrifice, commitment, work, support, forgiveness—everything that she has given me over the years has been incredible. I couldn’t have done any of the things I’ve done without it,” per People.\n\nJanuary 2023: In a super emotional episode of Hemsworth’s documentary series Limitless, the Marvel star takes a genetic test that reveals he’s at a high risk for developing Alzheimer’s. In the next episode, Pataky helps Hemsworth confront his fear of aging by going into full prosthetics to transform into herself as an octogenarian so Hemsworth can meet the future her, even if one day he doesn’t recognize her. “Still beautiful,” he says.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJune 2022: Twin sons Tristan and Sasha make their red-carpet debuts at the premiere of Thor: Love and Thunder. Daughter India Rose isn’t there, but she is in the movie, playing Gorr’s daughter.\n\n(Pataky appeared, from behind, in the Thor: The Dark World post-credit scene, standing in for Natalie Portman when Portman was unavailable.)\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMay 2020: While isolated during the pandemic, Hemsworth opens up to GQ about reprioritizing his family. “Every job I’d take, every time I’d go off on these extended trips, it got harder and harder. For a little while you don’t think the kids notice and then you realize they do,” he says. “I absolutely want to continue to make films that I’m proud of, but that can also wait. Now what’s more important is my kids are at an age I don’t want to miss. And I’d hate to look back in 20 years and go, ‘Right, let’s get to work as a parent,’ and I’ve missed it all.”\n\nApril 2018: Speaking to Vogue Australia, Pataky reveals that she’s had a Thor tattoo since she was a teenager. “Yes, it’s about Thor and I ended up marrying [the man] who plays Thor!” she says. “It is shocking how things in life [turn out]. I just liked that [symbol] and the legend he had was so beautiful and I wanted to keep it.” She also has a “C” on her finger; Hemsworth has an “E” on his.\n\nShe also confesses that her marriage has not always been a walk in the park. “In the beginning it was beautiful—when I met him he wasn’t known at all and I grew with him and experienced all his successes and changes, and then he became just so huge and I’ve been sharing that too…Going through every moment and being there with him with every success was actually a good thing—we grew together. It’s difficult when you go from being an unknown person to a very known person and all the changes that come with that.”\n\nPataky said, “We did everything very quickly—I don’t know how we survived as a couple. We were married and then a year after we had kids. It puts a lot of pressure on a marriage, but we came out good because there is a lot of love between us and we are very strong personalities but love each other so much. We make it work….So I think our years together have been great. Every marriage has ups and downs—it’s constant work to be in a successful marriage and stay together forever. Chris’s parents have been together all their lives, and that’s such a beautiful thing, and their families are so close.”\n\nMarch 2015: Pataky talks to Women’s Health about falling in love with her superstar husband. “I didn’t know who he was when we met…In Spain, nobody knows Home and Away!”\n\n2015: The Hemsworths move from Los Angeles to Byron Bay in Australia.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMarch 2014: Pataky gives birth to the couple’s twin sons, Sasha and Tristan. “Watching her be a mother made me fall even more in love with her,” the star says in an interview the next year. “Once we had kids we were like, ‘We’re in it, this is it.’”\n\nMay 2012: The couple welcome their daughter, India Rose.\n\nDecember 2010: They get married on a whim! “There was no great plan to any of it, to be honest,” Hemsworth said in an interview, per the Daily Mail. “We were on holiday and we said, ‘Why don’t we get married too?’…Honestly, we had both our families on holiday at the same time, just randomly, and we said this is a good opportunity with everyone together so we just did it.”\n\nEarly 2010: A talent agent introduces the pair. “There was no lightbulb moment. From the first time we met, we just made sense. She’s fun. She’s outgoing, and she has a sense of humor and a passionate attitude toward life, which is nice to try and keep up with,” Hemsworth told Elle."
