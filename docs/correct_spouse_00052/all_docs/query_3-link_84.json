        "text": "Who didn’t want to be apart of the Twilight franchise back in the day?! Everyone went absolutely BONKAS for the films. I’ll never forget going to see the first Twilight movie back in seventh grade and covering my eyes the whole time because I truly thought it was a horror flick.\n\nWELL, ACCORDING TO THIS NEW INTERVIEW WITH ANNA KENDRICK, I WASN’T THAT FAR OFF!\n\nThe bubbly and adorable Anna Kendrick sat down with *Vanity Fair* to breakdown her acting career.\n\nHer breakout role was, of course, Bella Swan’s best friend Jessica Stanley in the Twilight film.\n\nI mean hey, it was no Pitch Perfect but it was still iconic!\n\nHowever, Anna let fans know filming this cult classic film was not all it’s cracked up to be.\n\n“The first movie we filmed in Portland, Oregon, and I just remember being so cold and miserable. And I just remember my Converse being completely soaked through and feeling like, ‘You know, this is a really great group of people and I’m sure that we would be friends at a different time, but I want to murder everyone,’” she admitted.\n\nShe continued: “Although, it was also kind of bonding. There was something about it, like if you go through some trauma event.”\n\n“Like you imagine people who survive a hostage situation, and you’re kind of bonded for life.”\n\nYikes .\n\nThankfully, the sequel wasn’t so bad, you guys!\n\n“For whatever reason, the weather wasn’t quite as intense. And that sort of where we all got the know each other a little bit better. I was shooting Up In the Air by the time that we were making that second movie. So they rearranged a lot of scheduling stuff. Because it would’ve been a real [expletive] move, but you know, they had the right to stop me from doing Up In the Air . So shoutout to those guys.”\n\nShe also recalled her final scenes as Jessica in the saga’s final film song, *Twilight: Breaking Dawn – Part 2* revealing that since she was only in a few scenes, she didn’t spend as much time on the set as her co-stars.\n\n“You’re in like half frozen mud in what was the final scene of filming for everybody,” she explained.\n\n“I get to come in and work for a week or two. And everybody else has been giving their blood, sweat and tears to the project for months. I show up at the end and I’m like, ‘Guys, we did it. It’s over!'”\n\nOh Anna, you rock, don’t ever change!"
