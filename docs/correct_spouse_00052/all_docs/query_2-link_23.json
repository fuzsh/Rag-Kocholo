        "text": "HARVEY Weinstein’s ex-wife Georgina Chapman is reportedly moving on with award-winning actor Adrien Brody after salvaging her Marchesa fashion brand.\n\nChapman, 43, stepped out in New York City running errands ahead of the verdict that could see her former lover behind bars for up to 25 years.\n\nWeinstein's ex looked elegant in a leopard-print coat, a button up blouse, and dark sunglasses while carrying a Louis Vuitton bag in January before the jury handed down the guilty verdict on Monday.\n\nChapman held her head high before a multitude of shocking revelations about Weinstein emerged during the high-profile courtcase.\n\nShe moved on from her doomed marriage to Weinstein with Adrien two years after divorcing the now convicted sex pest.\n\nChapman met her new man through her ex-husband after Adrien starred in two Miramax productions, Hollywoodland and Jailbreakers.\n\nThe lovebirds were then properly introduced at a swimwear event in Puerto Rico where they reportedly \"bonded over cocktails.\"\n\nChapman left Weinstein in 2017 when the sexual assault allegations against him came to light.\n\nShe previously told PEOPLE magazine she needed time away from the producer as reports claimed she is leaning on former political aide Huma Abedin, the wife of disgraced former US congressman Anthony Weiner, for support.\n\n“My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,\" Chapman said in a statement.\n\n“I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”\n\nWeinstein said he \"encouraged\" his wife to leave him, acknowledging that the sexual assault suit destroyed their marriage.\n\n\"Over the last week, there has been a lot of pain for my family that I take responsibility for,\" he said after Chapman confirmed their marriage was over.\n\n\"I sat down with my wife Georgina, who I love more than anything, and we discussed what was best for our family.\n\n\"We discussed the possibility of a separation and I encouraged her to do what was in her heart. In the end, she made the decision to separate.\n\n\"I understand, I love her and I love our children and hopefully, when I am better, I will be in their lives again. I support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild.\"\n\nChapman began dating Weinstein in 2004 after he left his first wife. They married on December 15, 2007.\n\nWeinstein agreed to an eight-figure deal to end their decade-long marriage.\n\nNow, the English designer is reportedly worth around $19 million (£15million) mainly as a result of her fashion brand, Marchesa.\n\nChapman shares a daughter and son with Weinstein who was convicted on two of five counts of sex crimes brought against him in a Manhattan court yesterday.\n\nA jury found him guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first-degree against production assistant Mimi Haley and rape in the third-degree against aspiring actress Jessica Mann.\n\nWeinstein had pleaded not guilty to all five before the previously deadlocked jury came to a definitive conclusion yesterday afternoon.\n\nAfter the guilty verdict in New York, the shamed producer faces another sex abuse suit in Los Angeles.\n\nHe was handcuffed and brought into police custody yesterday afternoon before being rushed to hospital with chest pains.\n\nEven President Donald Trump weighed in on his conviction during a press briefing in India today, describing the outcome of the #MeToo trial as a \"victory\" for women.\n\nDo you have a story for The US Sun team?"
