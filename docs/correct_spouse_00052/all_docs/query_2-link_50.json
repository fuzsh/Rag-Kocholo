        "text": "(chilled-out guitar music)\n\nMy first car, I mean, I... Man...\n\nI had a Volvo 164E.\n\nthat I bought from a neighbor, a friend of mine,\n\nfor 50 bucks and it didn't go in reverse.\n\nI literally got chased by an ex-girfriend's\n\nex-boyfriend in the Bronx in that car.\n\nAnd, you know. There was no going backwards, you know.\n\nYou've got to make sure you know where you're going.\n\n(laughter)\n\nAt 17, wow. And then I had a Mustang Mach 1,\n\nwhich was really my favorite at that time.\n\nIf I'd go back to those days, I'd make something\n\npretty fly that was, you know, my Mustang was 850 bucks.\n\nAnd, I learned to do the body work, I learned\n\nto tint the windows and put in the sound system.\n\nI did a matte paint job then, well, that paint job\n\nwas done because you couldn't afford lacquer.\n\nCouldn't afford a polished paint job, but you\n\nhad to show your own unique style that was\n\ndifferent from others, making due and making something\n\npretty unique and fresh.\n\nThat was a big part of growing up in New York and Queens.\n\nWell...\n\nto comment on fashion is a faux-pa I think.\n\nYou know, look, I feel really grateful because\n\nI've been welcomed into the fashion community,\n\nand I think there's a lot of artistry in there.\n\nAnd creativity, and...\n\nI don't think about it too much past that.\n\nThese days, I kind of\n\nam happy in jeans\n\nand a t-shirt and a hoodie, and then if I'm at an event\n\nI'll put on a three-piece suit and wear that casually.\n\nYou know, I just try to keep\n\nit all casual even if it's a tuxedo.\n\nThere's a formality in certain attire, and I think\n\nregardless of that, you've got to\n\nfeel comfortable and natural with it.\n\nI think the beauty of making movies and the nature\n\nof film is that you're under the gun\n\nAnd...\n\nyou're all in, and then you're completely\n\ndone with it, and it's gone.\n\nAnd it's really, it's gone, and that guy is gone.\n\nAnd who I was then is gone, and it's really nice\n\nto jump from that into something else.\n\nIf you look at the kind of roles that I play\n\nback-to-back, that's what's exciting.\n\nYou know, playing Houdini for instance,\n\nin the turn of the century, with a very thick\n\nkind of New York accent, almost, and then\n\njumping to play a psychologist in Melbourne\n\nwho is Australian, within a matter of weeks.\n\nMy parents didn't understand me on the phone.\n\nIt's really, such a remarkable, ah, profession\n\nif you're in touch with it, and you're, and my job\n\nrequirement is to put myself in other people's shoes.\n\nAnd the only way you do that is to understand\n\nthe person you are meant to portray.\n\nAnd, it's taught me a lot."
