        "text": "John Shearer/WireImage\n\nAdrien Brody and Georgina Chapman have taken their romance to the Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\n\nThe pair showed sweet PDA while smiling and posing arm in arm as they arrived at the 2021 Met Gala — their first Met Gala together — on Monday.\n\nThe Oscar winner, 48, wore a black Dior Men classic peak lapel tuxedo for the event, while Chapman, 45, was dressed in a sparkling gown.\n\nThe couple previously made their red carpet debut in June at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of Brody's crime thriller, Clean. A month later, they shared a kiss while stepping out at the Cannes Film Festival for the actor's latest movie The French Dispatch.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRELATED: Everything to Know About the 2021 Met Gala: The Theme, Co-Chairs, Covid Protocols and Beyond\n\nPEOPLE confirmed in February that Brody and the Marchesa co-founder were dating after the two were first linked in fall 2019 by various reports.\n\nLionel Hahn/Getty\n\nThe theme of this year's star-studded Met Gala is In America: A Lexicon of Fashion. Naomi Osaka, 23, Timothée Chalamet, 26, Billie Eilish, 19, and Amanda Gorman, 23, serve as co-chairs while Tom Ford, Adam Mosseri, and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour are honorary chairs.\n\nBe sure to check out all of PEOPLE's Met Gala coverage to get the latest news on fashion's biggest night.\n\nAs PEOPLE previously reported, the annual gala is enforcing a COVID-19 vaccination mandate and mask requirement after last year's 2020 Met Gala was canceled.\n\n\"Currently, all attendees at The Met Gala on September 13 must provide proof of full vaccination and will also be expected to wear masks indoors except when eating or drinking,\" a spokesperson for The Met confirmed to PEOPLE in August. \"We will update these guidelines as needed.\"\n\nRELATED: Met Gala to Require Attendees to Be Vaccinated Against COVID-19 and Wear Masks\n\nThe museum's two-part exhibition will include a series of events celebrating American fashion. Part one, titled In America: A Lexicon of Fashion, will debut on September 18 and run through September 5, 2022, to \"celebrate The Costume Institute's 75th anniversary and explore a modern vocabulary of American fashion,\" Vogue shared.\n\nPart two, In America: An Anthology of Fashion, will open on May 5, 2022, and \"will explore the development of American fashion by presenting narratives that relate to the complex and layered histories of those spaces.\" It will also close on September 5, 2022."
