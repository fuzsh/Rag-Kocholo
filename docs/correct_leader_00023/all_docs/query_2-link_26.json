        "text": "Hosni Mubarak has stepped down as president of Egypt, after weeks of protest in Cairo and other cities.\n\nThe news was greeted with a huge outburst of joy and celebration by thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the heart of the demonstrations.\n\nMr Mubarak ruled for 30 years, suppressing dissent and protest, and jailing opponents.\n\nUS President Barack Obama said that Egypt must now move to civilian and democratic rule.\n\nThis was not the end but the beginning and there were difficult days ahead, the US president added, but he was confident the people could find the answers.\n\n\"The people of Egypt have spoken, their voices have been heard,\" Mr Obama said. \"Egypt will never be the same again.\"\n\n\"They have made it clear that nothing less than genuine democracy will carry the day.\"\n\nAnnouncing Mr Mubarak's resignation, Vice-President Omar Suleiman said the president had handed power to the army.\n\nMr Suleiman said on state TV that the high command of the armed forces had taken over.\n\n\"In the name of God the merciful, the compassionate, citizens, during these very difficult circumstances Egypt is going through, President Hosni Mubarak has decided to step down from the office of president of the republic and has charged the high council of the armed forces to administer the affairs of the country,\" he said.\n\n\"May God help everybody.\"\n\nLater an army officer read out a statement paying tribute to Mr Mubarak for \"what he has given\" to Egypt but acknowledging popular power.\n\n\"There is no legitimacy other than that of the people,\" the statement said.\n\nThe military high command is headed by Defence Minister Mohamed Hussein Tantawi.\n\nUS diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks described Field Marshal Tantawi as \"aged and change-resistant\", but committed to avoiding another war with Israel.\n\nMr Mubarak has already left Cairo and is in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh where he has a residence, officials say.\n\nIn Cairo, thousands of people gathered outside the presidential palace, in Tahrir Square and at state TV.\n\nThey came out in anger following an address by Mr Mubarak on Thursday. He had been expected to announce his resignation but stopped short of stepping down, instead transferring most powers to Mr Suleiman.\n\n\"The people have brought down the regime,\" they chanted in reaction to the news of his eventual resignation less than 24 hours later.\n\nOpposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said: \"This is the greatest day of my life.\"\n\n\"You cannot comprehend the amount of joy and happiness of every Egyptian at the restoration of our humanity and our freedom.\"\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's banned Islamist opposition movement, paid tribute to the army for keeping its promises.\n\n\"I salute the Egyptian people and the martyrs. This is the day of victory for the Egyptian people. The main goal of the revolution has been achieved,\" said the Brotherhood's former parliamentary leader, Mohamed el-Katatni.\n\nAyman Nour, Mr Mubarak's rival for the presidency in 2005, described it as the greatest day in Egypt's history.\n\n\"This nation has been born again. These people have been born again, and this is a new Egypt,\" he told al-Jazeera TV.\n\nMeanwhile Amr Moussa, a former Egyptian foreign minister, announced that he would leave his post as secretary general of the Arab League \"within weeks\", the Egyptian news agency Mena reported. He hinted that he might stand for president.\n\nThe BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo said the announcement caught everyone by surprise: all over the city, drivers honked their horns and people fired guns into the air.\n\nBut the army takeover looks very much like a military coup, our correspondent adds.\n\nThe constitution has been breached, he says, because officially it should be the speaker of parliament who takes over, not the army leadership."
