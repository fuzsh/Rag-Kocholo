        "meta_description": "Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has died at age 91. A deeply polarizing figure who spent 30 years in power, Mubarak was an autocratic leader who jailed and tortured opponents, but he remained friendly toward the United States and other allies abroad. And it was opposition to Mubarak's reign that ignited Egypt's version of the Arab Spring. Nick Schifrin reports on his political legacy.",
