        "text": "Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak died on Tuesday at a military hospital in Cairo, aged 91, having ruled for more than 29 years until Arab Spring protests led to his overthrew in February 2011.\n\nWhen he came to power after the assassination of his predecessor Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981, few people expected that he would become Egypt's longest reigning ruler since the 19th Century.\n\nBorn in the village of Kafr El-Meselha, north of Cairo, in May 1928, Mubarak joined the Egyptian Air Force in 1950. Shortly after Egypt's devastating defeat in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, he was put in charge of Egypt's Air Force Academy and credited with doubling the number of air force pilots during his tenure.\n\nIn 1972, he was appointed Commander of the Egyptian Air Force and it was in the following year's Arab-Israeli war that he rose to public prominence.\n\nMubarak was involved in planning Egypt's surprise attack on Israeli forces, who had occupied the Sinai Peninsula, in 1973. Egyptian fighter pilots performed excellently in the war.\n\nThe 1973 Arab-Israeli war - although not quite a military victory for Egypt - restored the country's pride and self-confidence and Mubarak emerged as a national hero, although some Egyptians later disputed his contribution."
