        "text": "Beginning in 1981, Hosni Mubarak ruled Egypt for over twenty-nine years. Though he ran for\n\npresidential reelection several times, elections were marked by widespread\n\nfraud, and opposing politicians were legally prohibited from running against\n\nMubarak until 2005. Virtually all key officials in government were from\n\nMubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP). Mubarak constructed a vast security\n\napparatus to control public dissent; in the 1990s, citizens would only whisper\n\nhis name for fear of reprisal. For his entire tenure as president, Egypt was in\n\na legalized \"state of emergency,\" which legalized censorship, expanded police\n\npowers, and curtailed constitutional rights. The regime severely limited\n\nfreedom of the press, and the state-run media were no more than a propaganda\n\nmachine. Rumors abounded that Mubarak would eventually be replaced by his son\n\nGamal, transforming Egypt's supposedly electoral government into a de facto\n\nmonarchy.\n\nEgyptian activists began to push the boundaries of the state's tolerance for dissent in the 2000s.\n\nIn 2004, a group of activists opposed to the Israeli occupation of Palestine\n\nand the United States war in Iraq formed a new campaign called the Kefaya\n\n(Enough) Movement, which targeted Mubarak and his family, and sought to prevent\n\nsuccession of the presidency to Gamal. Then, textile workers frustrated by\n\nMubarak's neoliberal policies launched a wave of strikes in 2006 and 2007,\n\nbeginning in Mahalla and spreading across the country. From this point forward,\n\npublic displays of dissent were not unusual, as they once were. Though there\n\nwere often ten times as many police as protesters, workers and activists felt\n\nmore confident taking to the streets to voice their concerns. The majority of\n\nthe population, however, remained fearful of the regime.\n\nA group of activist\n\nyouth formed the April 6 Movement in spring 2008, to support an industrial\n\nprotest in Mahalla. After the Mahalla protest ended, April 6 continued to\n\norganize, using new tools such as Facebook and Twitter to connect with\n\npotential allies and members. The group received training from members of the\n\nSerbian group Otpor!, which organized the nonviolent resistance to and eventual\n\nremoval of Slobodan Milosevic. Despite arrests and harassment of April 6\n\nleaders, the group remained active in its efforts to encourage resistance to\n\nthe regime.\n\nUnder Mubarak,\n\nJanuary 25 was Egypt's \"National Police Day,\" a celebration of the country's\n\npolice. As January 25, 2011, approached, April 6 decided to use this day to\n\ntheir advantage and hold a march in which they would chant creative,\n\nanti-police, anti-Mubarak messages. In advance of the date, the group\n\ndistributed thousands of flyers advertising their rally, and also promoted the\n\nevent on Facebook. On January 18, April 6 member Asmaa Mahfouz posted a video\n\non YouTube in which she urged people to protest on the 25th, and not to be\n\nafraid. The video went viral, gaining over 80,000 hits in less than a week.\n\nJanuary 25 protests were also organized and supported by Google executive Wael\n\nGhonim, who used his Facebook group, We Are All Khaled Said, to reach tens of\n\nthousands more Egyptians. Many other groups, including the National Association\n\nfor Change, Kefaya, and opposition political parties, also endorsed the\n\nrallies.\n\nRecruitment efforts\n\nfor the day of protest were aided by the recent revolution in Tunisia, where\n\npopular nonviolent protests forced long-time President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali\n\nto step down on January 14. This stunning victory by Tunisians gave Egyptians\n\nthe feeling that change might also be possible in their country. By January 25,\n\nclose to 100,000 people indicated on Facebook that they would attend the day of\n\nprotest. Mubarak's government promised to strictly suppress any demonstrations,\n\non the grounds that activists had not obtained the required permits.\n\nOn Tuesday, January\n\n25, tens of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Cairo, eventually\n\ncongregating in Tahrir (\"Liberation\") Square, where they chanted and waved\n\nflags. Some protesters burned portraits of Mubarak. Police attempted to disperse\n\nprotesters with tear gas and water cannons. When this failed, police decided to\n\nsimply contain the masses, rather than attempt to disperse it. Clashes between\n\nprotesters and police took place on a number of side streets. Though some\n\nprotesters threw rocks, the majority of the participants were nonviolent.\n\nPolice actions were more aggressive, though they limited themselves to\n\nnon-lethal means such as batons, gas, water cannons, and rubber bullets. In\n\naddition to the protests in Cairo, demonstrations occurred in Alexandria, Suez,\n\nand other Egyptian cities.\n\nBefore Tuesday's\n\nlarge rallies, the April 6, Ghonim, and other organizers framed the protests as\n\nan outcry against torture, unemployment, and corruption, and not as a demand\n\nfor Mubarak to leave. Many participants in the protests wanted Mubarak to go,\n\nhowever, and the official messaging from organizers quickly changed to reflect\n\nthat. By the end of Tuesday, organizers were calling for Mubarak to step down,\n\nand vowing not to stop agitating until he did.\n\nThe next day,\n\ncitizens held smaller marches and rallies in Cairo and elsewhere. Police again\n\nresponded with organized efforts, leading to more clashes. Every time police\n\nforced a group of protesters to disperse, protesters regrouped shortly and\n\nresumed their chants for Mubarak to step down.\n\nIn official\n\nstatements, Mubarak's regime claimed that the protests were organized by the\n\nMuslim Brotherhood, which in fact was not involved at all. Police violence\n\nagainst mostly peaceful demonstrators attracted the attention of the\n\ninternational community, including United States Secretary of State Hillary\n\nClinton, who encouraged Mubarak to allow peaceful protest.\n\nOn Thursday, January\n\n27, small demonstrations continued, but most citizens stayed home. The youth\n\norganizers of the campaign announced that Friday would be an escalation, a \"Day\n\nof Rage\" against the regime. Both the government and the resistance used\n\nThursday to prepare. Spurred by the unexpected size and resilience of the\n\ndemonstration, the Muslim Brotherhood announced it would be joining the\n\ncoalition of organizers. In addition, Dr. Mohammed El-Baradei, former head of\n\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and a critic of Mubarak, returned to the\n\ncountry to provide a face to the protests. This was a strategic maneuver by the\n\nyouth leadership coalition, which believed that El-Baradei would help combat\n\nthe international perception of the protests as somewhat disorganized and\n\nspontaneous. For his part, El-Baradei emphasized that the youth were the\n\nleaders of the revolution.\n\nThe night before the\n\n\"Day of Rage,\" the Egyptian government ordered all Internet Service Providers\n\nin the country to cut off Internet service. The ISPs complied, and Internet\n\ntraffic in Egypt immediately dropped to close to nothing. This was the first\n\ntime in history that a government had cut off all Internet access to its\n\npeople. In doing so, Mubarak's regime believed it would hinder the organization\n\nof the protesters. The regime also hindered cell phone access, although it\n\ncould not cut it off entirely.\n\nThe following day,\n\nafter midday prayer services, hundreds of thousands of Egyptians streamed into\n\nthe streets across Egypt. In Cairo, people followed directions printed and\n\ndistributed by youth organizers, which instructed individuals to gather their\n\nneighbors and start marching toward the center city and Tahrir Squre. Materials\n\ndistributed by April 6 and other organizers also stressed the importance of\n\nremaining nonviolent and maintaining a positive attitude. Police attempted to\n\nobstruct demonstrators in all parts of the city, using live ammunition in some\n\ncases. One major confrontation occurred at the Kasr al-Nil Bridge, where police\n\narmed with gas, water cannons and truncheons sought to beat back a swelling\n\ncrowd of demonstrators. For the most part, demonstrators did not engage in\n\nhand-to-hand combat with the police, choosing instead to surpass them\n\nnonviolently by the strength of their numbers.\n\nThe government\n\nannounced a 6 pm curfew, but almost nobody paid attention to it. When it became\n\nclear that protesters were not intimidated into leaving the streets, the regime\n\nwithdrew the police forces from Cairo. Demonstrators burned abandoned police\n\nvans, and also lit fire to the National Democratic Party headquarters. Many\n\nEgyptians spoke of a \"fear barrier\" that had been broken by the day of conflict\n\nwith the police, in which the numbers and bravery of the protesters prevailed.\n\nAfter police\n\nvanished from Cairo, the national army entered the city. Aware that the army\n\nwould be an important arbiter of power, demonstrators cheered to welcome the\n\nsoldiers, gave them hugs, and chanted slogans like \"The People and the Army are\n\nOne Fist.\" The army announced its intention to protect the people of Egypt, and\n\nemphasized that it would not fire on civilians.\n\nLater that night,\n\nMubarak appeared on state-run television and announced that he would dismiss\n\nhis cabinet. This statement did not appease the demonstrators. Several hundred\n\nremained in Tahrir Square overnight, and vowed to stay until Mubarak stepped\n\ndown.\n\nOn January 29,\n\npolice did not return to the capital. Approximately 50,000 people gathered in\n\nTahrir Square again to demand that Mubarak resign. Organizers of the protests\n\nencouraged people not to chant slogans supporting any particular party, but to\n\nproject a message of unity and courage. Official statements by organizers\n\nemphasized the diverse nature of the demonstrators, who crossed lines of class,\n\ngender, and religion. In Tahrir Square, people took turns sweeping and cleaning\n\nup garbage, to prove that the Egyptian people could take care of themselves\n\nwithout the iron hand of the police. People quickly convened \"citizens'\n\npatrols\" in Cairo's neighborhoods to prevent looting or violence.\n\nMeanwhile, the\n\nregime amplified any slight incident involving violence or disorder in order to\n\nportray the crowds as dangerous and chaotic. On Saturday evening, Mubarak swore\n\nin the Head of Intelligence, Omar Suleiman, as his new vice president. Suleiman\n\nmade gestures toward the organizers of the resistance, but the organizers said\n\nthat they would not negotiate with the government until Mubarak was no longer\n\nin power.\n\nBy this point, the\n\nevents in Egypt had captured the attention of people across the world. The Al\n\nJazeera news network provided 24-hour coverage of the protests in Arabic and\n\nEnglish, despite intimidation of its reporters by the regime. International\n\nallies organized solidarity rallies in many countries, including the United\n\nStates. American activists called on President Barack Obama to cut off its\n\nfinancial assistance to Egypt. Further aid came from the American company\n\nGoogle, which developed \"speak2tweet\" technology that allowed activists to post\n\nto Twitter over their phones, without Internet access.\n\nOn January 31 and\n\nFebruary 1, activists further developed the encampment in Tahrir Square,\n\nbuilding a tent city in the center, and barricades around the perimeter of the\n\nsquare. Over two million people filled the square on February 1 to continue to\n\npressure the regime. The square acquired a potent symbolic value—people had the\n\nfeeling that, as long as there were demonstrators in the square, the revolution\n\nwas alive.\n\nEgyptian state\n\ntelevision attempted to convince people to return to their \"safe, stable\n\nlives,\" and emphasized the stories of people who were inconvenienced or losing\n\nbusiness due to the protests. In addition, Mubarak gave another defiant speech\n\non February 1 in which he refused to step down, but promised not to run for\n\nre-election and vowed to enact constitutional reforms. Most of the protesters\n\nwere not convinced by his promises.\n\nThe next morning,\n\nFebruary 2, pro-Mubarak groups streamed into the city, pledging allegiance to\n\ntheir president and condemning the anti-Mubarak protesters. There is some\n\nevidence that many of these counter-protesters were in fact the police forces\n\nin plainclothes--pro-democracy demonstrators claimed to find police ID cards on\n\nthe \"pro-Mubarak civilians.\" What started as a ‘war of voices'\n\nescalated throughout the day into violent skirmishes. Street battles between\n\nuncoordinated vigilante groups were fought with stones, sticks, and gasoline\n\nbombs. Pro-Mubarak forces dropped bricks, furniture, and other items from\n\nbuildings onto opponent protesters below. They also targeted foreign\n\njournalists, and beat many with fists and sticks. In the afternoon, pro-Mubarak\n\nsupporters armed with whips attempted to charge into Tahrir Square on camels\n\nand horses, but were largely pushed back by opposition forces\n\nMeanwhile, the\n\nmilitary largely stood by without intervening in the skirmishes. Army officials\n\ndid confront the Tahrir protesters, asking the demonstrators to return home.\n\nProtesters wouldn't move an inch. In the meantime, Internet service was\n\nreturning to the country. Also, the nationwide curfew, which the public had\n\nbeen defying and the military not enforcing, was reportedly reduced.\n\nThe next day,\n\nFebruary 3, as thousands maintained the occupation of Tahrir Square, street\n\nbattles continued. Pro-democracy protesters stood their ground. A nearby metro\n\nstation was turned into a makeshift holding cell; it was proved that some of\n\nthe pro-government supporters were in fact state police in plain clothes. After\n\nstanding by for so long, the army finally began situating themselves between\n\nopposition groups throughout the city, preventing some clashes.\n\nAdditional\n\nanti-Mubarak protesters entered Tahrir Square, protecting it from pro-Mubarak\n\nagitators. In the afternoon the Square was shook with heavy gunfire. Several\n\npeople were killed and more injured; many were treated by volunteer doctors in\n\nTahrir Square's makeshift hospital.\n\nOn Friday, February\n\n4, hundreds of thousands of anti-Mubarak protesters convened in Tahrir Square\n\nfor what was called the ‘Day of Departure,' renewing the call for the immediate\n\nresignation of President Mubarak. Protesters waved flags, sang the national\n\nanthem, cheered, prayers, and displayed banners and signs. With the curfew\n\nlifted, more were expected to gather at the Square for prayer. Solidarity ‘Day\n\nof Departure' demonstrations were held in New York and Damascus.\n\nThe military was by\n\nnow actively mediating between pro and anti-Mubarak protesters. The pro-Mubarak\n\nprotesters themselves set up and managed security checkpoints and set up\n\nseveral layers of barricades to protect the Square, using secret codes to\n\ncommunicate and form additional human barricades if necessary. Christians and\n\nothers not participating in Friday prayer also formed human barricades around\n\nthose praying to protect them.\n\nOn Saturday,\n\nFebruary 5, key leadership of the ruling National Democratic Party resigned\n\nincluding President Mubarak's son Gamal Mubarak and the party secretary-general\n\nSafwat el-Sharif. Banks opened for the first time since protest began. Again\n\nthe army pleaded with protesters to go home, only to be met with the chant,\n\n‘we're not leaving, he is!'\n\nThe next day,\n\nEgypt's vice president met with a group of leading opposition groups for the\n\nfirst time, offering new concessions regarding freedom of press, the release of\n\ndetained protesters, and the possible lifting of the Emergency Laws. Opposition\n\ngroups saw the meeting as a premature step since their central demand had yet\n\nto be met: the resignation of Hosni Mubarak.\n\nOn Monday, February\n\n7, a symbolic funeral procession was held in Tahrir Square for Ahmed Mahmoud,\n\nthe first reported journalist casualty of the protests. Later, Wael Ghonim, a\n\nGoogle executive and activist arrested by state authorities was released. His\n\nmoving appearance on TV after his release revived protesters spirits and\n\nreenergized the campaign for thousands; Ghonim would soon play a leading role\n\nin Tahrir Square.\n\nBy Tuesday, February\n\n8, Tahrir Square was swelling with protesters, which now resembled a tent camp.\n\nThe largest march of the protest shook Cairo, with parallel demonstrations in\n\nIsmaïlia, Asyut, El-Mahalla El-Kubra, and Alexandria. Flags were displayed as a\n\nsign of unity. A Cairo bakery near Tahrir displayed cupcakes with the Egyptian\n\nflag. The demonstrators grew in numbers. In addition to the civilian blockades\n\nand checkpoints, ‘celebratory greeting crews' organized to welcome newcomers to\n\nthe Square. That night, as with the several before, protesters made music and\n\nsang anti-Mubarak songs.\n\nThe next day workers\n\nwent on strike to join the protests. Private labor unions as well as workers of\n\nstate-owned companies called for better wages and benefits, for them,\n\nlongstanding demands that were now put forward. Some also called for the end of\n\nMubarak. Massive strikes spread throughout the country, halting economic life.\n\nOther forms of resistance were allowed to come forth. Thousands of farmers from\n\nthe southern province Assiut blocked highways with flaming palm trees to\n\nprotest bread shortages. Hundreds of homeless Egyptians set fire to a\n\ngovernment office in Port Said in anger over lack of housing.\n\nThat night in the\n\nTahrir Square, a vigil was held to honor the up to 302 people killed in the\n\ncouple weeks of protest.\n\nThe next day,\n\nFebruary 10, the Egyptian government showed signs of change. The Prime Minister\n\nformed a committee to inspect the ‘illegitimate practices' resulting from the\n\nrecent events. The criminal court endorsed the decision to ban three former\n\nministers from leaving the country. The security chief of Wadi al-Jadid was\n\nfired and the police captain who ordered the shooting of protesters was\n\narrested.\n\nRumors circulated that\n\nMubarak would make an announcement to the public. The streets were flooded with\n\nprotesters. In the afternoon, 1,000 doctors in white coats entered the Square\n\nto huge applause; about 3,000 lawyers joined soon after. The city was buzzing\n\nwith preliminary excitement. Protesters were sure the time had come. Mubarak\n\nappeared on TV to deliver his speech. He reiterated his promise not run in the\n\nnext election, indicating he planned to remain in power until that time.\n\nProtesters were enraged. They took the shoes off their feet and waved them at\n\nMubarak's image. That night, about 1,000 marched onto the state television\n\nheadquarters, which was guarded by the military. The crowd pleaded with the\n\nmilitary to ‘save Egypt' claiming, ‘we won't leave, they will leave.'\n\nEgypt awoke the next\n\nmorning to massive demonstrations. It was Friday, February 11. Masses of\n\nprotesters rallied in front of the state television building in Cairo, the\n\npresidential palace in Heliopolis, and of course, Liberation Square. Early in\n\nthe evening, after a day of intense protest, the vice-president got on air and\n\nannounced that Hosni Mubarak had resigned as president and handed over\n\npolitical power to the army. Tahrir exploded with joy; Egyptians waved flags,\n\nsang, chanted, and honked car horns."
