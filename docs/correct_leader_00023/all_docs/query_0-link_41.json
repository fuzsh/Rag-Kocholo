Cohen wanted to discuss with Mubarak the planned military action to be taken by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq if Saddam Hussein continued to thwart weapons inspections by the United Nations Special Commission. Egypt was one of eleven nations Cohen visited with his message during an intense four-day tour of Europe and the Middle East."
