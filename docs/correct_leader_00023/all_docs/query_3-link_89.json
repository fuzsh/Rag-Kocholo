He served as the fourth President of Egypt from 1981 to February 2011. Mubarak was appointed vice president of Egypt in 1975, and assumed the presidency on October 14, 1981, following the assassination of President Anwar El Sadat. The length of his presidency made him Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha. Before he entered politics, Mubarak was a career officer in the Egyptian Air Force, serving as its commander from 1972 to 1975 and rising to the rank of air chief marshal.\n\nOn February 11, 2011, Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman announced the resignation of Mubarak and that power would be turned over to the military. On April 13, a prosecutor originally appointed by Mubarak ordered the former president and both his sons to be detained for 15 days of questioning about allegations of corruption and abuse of power, but Mubarak was in police custody in a hospital near his residence following a heart attack."
