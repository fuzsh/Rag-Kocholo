        "text": "Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak – ousted by the military in 2011 – has died in Cairo at the age of 91.\n\nMubarak spent three decades in office before a popular uprising swept Egypt.\n\nHe was found guilty of complicity in the killing of protesters during the revolution. That conviction was overturned and was freed in March 2017.\n\nHis death was confirmed by Egyptian state news on Tuesday. Earlier in the day, the Al-Watan website reported that he died at a military hospital.\n\nMubarak underwent surgery in late January and was photographed with his grandson as he recovered.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

Mubarak was forced to step down 18 days later.\n\nJust over a year after Mubarak's overthrow, Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist politician, won Egypt's first democratic presidential election.\n\nThe new president lasted less than a year in office. Amid mass protests, he was ousted in a military coup led by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\n\nGen Sisi went on to win two presidential elections. Morsi died in prison in 2019.\n\nIn 2012, Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment over the deaths of some of the 900 protesters who were killed by security forces during the uprising a year earlier.\n\nBoth he and his two sons were also convicted of corruption."
