        "text": "Egypt's former president Hosni Mubarak, who was toppled in 2011 as part of the country's revolution, has died, according to state television.\n\nThe 91-year-old is said to have been in hospital for several weeks before his death, with his son Alaa tweeting in January about his father undergoing surgery.\n\nOn Tuesday, Alaa paid tribute to his father in another tweet, which read: \"We belong to Allah and to him we shall return.\n\n\"He moved to Allah's mercy this morning, my father, President Mubarak. Oh Allah, forgive him and have mercy on him.\"\n\nThe Egyptian military commended the former air force commander as \"one of its sons and war leader\" in a statement.\n\nQuoting his lawyer Farid al Deeb, the Egyptian Independent reported on Monday that Mubarak had been in an intensive care unit since last month after a bout of fatigue.\n\nIt added that he also suffered complications after undergoing surgery on his intestines.\n\nMubarak, known by his nickname as the modern-day \"pharaoh\", ruled Egypt as an autocrat for three decades from 1981, and was jailed for years after the Arab Spring uprising that ended his rule.\n\nHe was given a life sentence for the deaths of anti-government protesters at the heart of the revolution and was convicted in 2015 alongside his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, for embezzling millions of pounds from the state.\n\nMubarak eventually walked free in 2017 after being acquitted for the majority of his charges in a move that shocked Egyptians.\n\nHis sons were released in 2018.\n\nBefore becoming the country's fourth president, Mubarak served in the Egyptian air force as a bomber pilot and notably as its commander during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war.\n\nHe went on to become vice president to Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated by extremists in 1981 during a military parade, and took the top job eight days later.\n\nThe brawny commander, who was subject himself to several assassination attempts - including in Ethiopia in 1995 - was known during his presidency for his opposition to Islamist militancy and his strong allegiance with the US.\n\nHe notably supported the US-led Operation Desert Storm to push forces under Iraq's Saddam Hussein from Kuwait.\n\nMubarak was also widely recognised for maintaining an icy peacetime with Israel, and therefore reminded Egypt during his rule that the only option was to be governed by him - or chaos.\n\nBut the millions of people who saw to his demise during 18 days of huge protests in Cairo, perceived their president as one who had failed to address poverty and high unemployment.\n\nThey also demonstrated against corruption and rejected his autocratic governance."
