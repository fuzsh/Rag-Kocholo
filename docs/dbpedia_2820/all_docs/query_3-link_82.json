        "text": "The wealthiest Austrian woman, Heidi Goëss-Horten, is reportedly selling her famous luxury yacht, the Carinthia VII, for an astounding € 160 million.\n\nConstructed in the Lürssen Yachts yard in 2002, the Carinthia VII is an impressive dream vessel that includes space for Ms. Goëss-Horten’s Bentley, six suites, a sauna, a steam bath, and a helicopter.\n\nAccording to Bild, the ship’s captain Andreas Jungblut says, “In professional circles, the Carinthia VII is still considered the most beautiful and elegant yacht in the world, despite many new buildings. It was built according to the excellent taste of Ms. Horten, who is also an exquisite art collector.”\n\nMs. Goëss-Horten is indeed an exquisite art collector with an impressive private collection and even plans to open her own museum in Vienna, as was previously reported by Vindobona.org.\n\nBild reports that Goëss-Horten’s reason for selling the yacht is that the trips have become “too strenuous” for her and that it has become “more burden than pleasure.”\n\nIn recent years, the ship has remained docked in Venice virtually unused.\n\nThe € 160 million price tag for the yacht comes with additional operational costs of € 27,400, and a tank of fuel for the vessel costs around € 500,000.\n\nMs. Goëss-Horten, who is worth an estimated € 2.7 billion, is the widow of businessman Helmut Horten, the founder of the German department store Horten AG.\n\nShe inherited her wealth upon the death of her husband, who passed away in November 1987.\n\nMs. Goëss-Horten is a member of the board of the charitable foundation Helmut Horten Stiftung and was reported by Vindobona.org to be the largest donor to the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP)."
