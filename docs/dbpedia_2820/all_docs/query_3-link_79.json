        "text": "For many decades, James Bond has been considered the world's best-known secret agent, thrilling masses of viewers movie after movie. Once played by major Hollywood legends such as Sean Connery, Roger Moore, George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, the latest productions feature actor Daniel Craig in front of the camera. But not only the actors, also the filming locations are spectacular: Unique backdrops with that certain something and often the world's most beautiful and hidden places are used for the movies since ever as a location. Austria has already been a frequent location for James Bond films in the past. For example, the film \"The Breath of Death\" was shot in 1987 at Lake Weissensee in Carinthia. For the Bond film \"Spectre\", which was released in 2015, three breathtaking locations in Austria serve as a setting for the exciting film.\n\nEspecially for action scenes high in the Austrian Alps, Sölden served as an ideal filming location for the James Bond makers in 2015. Breathtaking footage for \"Spectre\" was shot on the highest road in the Alps. The head of Söldner Bergbahnen Jakob Falkner himself took the opportunity to place Sölden as a James Bond filming location. When he heard that the production company was interested in Sölden as a film backdrop, he made contact with the filmmakers via the Austrian film commission \"Location Austria\". Thanks to his commitment, the collaboration went smoothly. In the middle of the ski resort of Sölden in the Ötztal Alps, the mountain station made of curved steel ribs as well as the unique summit restaurant in ice cube design were used as a backdrop for the spectacular scenes. Even the glacier road and especially the 1.8-kilometer-long Rosi Mittermaier Tunnel were opened exclusively for filming in winter.\n\nFilm highlights\n\nUnder strict safety regulations, the scenes with lead actor Daniel Craig, Bond girl Léa Seydoux and Mr. Hinx Dave Bautista were already shot in January. In the following weeks, scenes with stuntmen followed, and after about three weeks of shooting, the fast-paced car rides and shootouts against the white mountain backdrop were completed.\n\nAltaussee was also chosen as the film set for the James Bond film \"Spectre\" in 2015. However, during this filming it was comparatively quieter, as there was no ruckus or explosions. Here at the beautiful Altausseer See, a pure game scene was shot. For this, the tranquil Altaussee was transformed into the film location of \"Spectre\" in January 2015. Lake Altaussee was unceremoniously declared a restricted zone, as the production team arrived in Altaussee with several hundred employees as well as numerous trucks. The main filming took place directly on the deep wintry lake and the Seewiese at the far end of Lake Altaussee. There, a scene crucial to the plot of the film was shot. James Bond sets off in a boat, a so-called Plätte, to a hunting lodge on Lake Altaussee. In the hut he comes across Mr. White, a former member of Quantum."
