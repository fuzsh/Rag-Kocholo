        "meta_description": "Parks \n\tUntil the withdrawal of the French troops in 1809, the state capital Klagenfurt had city walls with moats in the shape of a square and a side of about one kilometer that surrounded the old town. After these fortifications were demolished, today's four ring roads in Klagenfurt were built in their place with numerous parks named after poets and composers. For example, the Koschatpark was created on Viktringer Ring, named after the Carinthian composer Thomas Koschat . Although the park created from the city moat that was filled in in 1900 was originally supposed to be called Stadtpark, it was named Schillerpark by the Klagenfurt city council in 1905 on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller 's death.\n\t\n\tOn the corner of Villacher Ring and St. Veiter Ring, Goethepark was built, named after the famous German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe . To the east is the Schubert Park, named after the famous Austrian composer Franz Schubert . There are also green areas on the Völkermarkter Ring in the east of the city, such as in front of the concert hall or the Bundesgymnasium, where a bust of Schiller from the Schiller Park was erected. On the corner of Völkermarkter and St. Veiter Ring is the Rauscherpark , named after a Klagenfurt writer , which shines in new splendor after redesign work in 2006.\n\t\n\tKlagenfurt am Wörthersee (official name; until 2008 and further briefly just Klagenfurt , Slovenian Celovec ob Vrbskem jezeru ) is a large city in the south of Austria and the state capital of the Austrian state of Carinthia . In the local Bavarian-Austrian dialect her name is pronounced Klognfuat . With 104,332 inhabitants (as of January 1, 2023), it is the largest city in Carinthia and the sixth largest city in Austria . The urban area is located in the center of the Klagenfurt Basin and currently has an area of ​​120 km².\n\t\n\tKlagenfurt was first mentioned in documents in 1192/1199 and was of little relevance until Maximilian I donated the city to the Carinthian estates in 1518. This donation and the subsequent Protestant Reformation movement of the 16th century meant a steep rise for the city: Klagenfurt became the capital of Carinthia, and numerous buildings that are still important today, such as the country house and the cathedral, were built.\n\t\n\tToday the statutory city of Klagenfurt is the seat of, among other things, the Carinthian state government , the Klagenfurt-Land district administration , the Diocese of Gurk , the Alpine-Adria University of Klagenfurt , the Gustav Mahler Private University of Music , an international airport and a location for the Carinthian University of Applied Sciences as well as numerous other companies and institutions, including those of the Carinthian Slovenes . Klagenfurt is also important for tourism due to its attractive city center with squares and old town buildings as well as cultural offerings and proximity to Lake Wörthersee .",
