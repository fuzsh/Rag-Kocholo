        "text": "Vulgo names (Vulgonamen) are a greeting from the past. In the realm of genealogy, they can cause confusion.\n\nRead on to find out how vulgo names came about, what were they used for and (my own reasoning) why they exist today…\n\nCarinthia (Kärnten), where we live, is one of the most rural states in Austria. We have many lonely valleys, high mountains and a whole lot of forest! About 60 percent of Carinthians live in the countryside ‘am Land’ - a huge percentage compared to the rest of Austria.\n\nAround here, traditions like the vulgo names have managed to stay alive.\n\nVulgo names today\n\nVulgo names can cause confusion, even outside of genealogy. Here’s the start of a telephone conversation I had with a work client:\n\nA work client answering the phone:\n\nPlieschnigg, good day!\n\nPlieschnigg, Grüß Gott!\n\nMe:\n\nGood day! Sorry for disturbing you, I’m actually looking for Mr Adambauer, do you know him?\n\nGruß Gott! Entschuldigen Sie die Störung, ich suche eigentlich den Herrn Adambauer, kennen Sie ihn zufällig?\n\nClient:\n\nYes, I am Mr Adambauer.\n\nJa ja, ich bin Adambauer.\n\nSo, if Herr Adambauer answered, why did he call himself Plieschnigg? With a hearty chuckle, Mr Adambauer explained that even today people still call him by his vulgo name, Plieschnigg, (the name of his farm) rather than his actual surname!\n\nYep, that’s how it is in countryside Austria!\n\nFun Fact: Austrian’s usually answer the phone with their last name. Gruß Gott! Translated, means Greet God. It’s used as a general hello and you’re greeted this way everywhere you go, at least in the south.\n\nHere’s the Vulgonamen Hochsinner on the Cadastral Map, the same farm, still proudly displays it today (right):\n\nSome (concise) history\n\nVulgo names come from a time before house numbers, before street names and before mandatory residence registration came into force under Empress Maria Theresia, when most title deeds in rural areas were issued and archived by the nobility or the Catholic Church.\n\nAlso imagine, back when there were a large number of the same names in a village, the farm name was really important for differentiating between people and for getting directions!\n\nThe name of the first buyer of the then established farm or forest or field then became the vulgo name of that farm.\n\nFrom then on, regardless of who subsequently lived on the farm (owner, worker, maid, servant, farrier, etc.) they were addressed with their first name AND the vulgo name of the farm.\n\nHow did vulgo names work? Here’s a fictional example:\n\nPicture this: It’s the year 1727.\n\nThe Prince Archbishop of Salzburg, Leopold Anton Eleutherius Freiheer von Firmian, has sent a courier to tiny Ebene-Reichenau in Kärnten to the Sonnleiten forest land estate.\n\nIn Ebene Reichenau the very best timber in the Bishop's territory is available (as I said we have a lot of forest..).\n\nThe Forester's name is Klaus Hinteregger - but - everyone knows him as Klaus Sonnleitner, as this is the common or vulgo name of the estate.\n\nStay with me….\n\nWhen he arrives, Bishop Leopold’s courier is received by the maid of the estate, Agnes. Her last name is Schabus.\n\nHowever, Agnes is known as Agnes Sonnleitner simply because she lives and works on the Sonnleiten estate!\n\nI’ll give you my take on this - not historically proven but makes perfect sense, especially if you live here and know the people!\n\nA bit like the famous Gallic village in Asterix and Obelix, the Alpine region of Central Europe (Alpe-Adria) was \"immune\" to influences from other areas in Europe.\n\nThere was no reason to come to the eastern Alpine region, the soil was barren, the summer was short, the winter was brutal (still is, just ask Nelly). That meant, the rest of Europe left the scarcely inhabited Alps alone and vice versa.\n\nNapoleon tried it and was defeated by a few stubborn Tiroleans ...\n\nSo what made sense and worked in the Middle Ages didn’t need improvement and didn’t change for a very, very long time. Everything was traditionally handled like this until the 20th century.\n\nThe area was not fought over until World War I and II, more to disrupt the influence of German Austria than to really want to occupy the area.\n\nMuch has changed in terms of documentation and archiving since the end of World War II (even in the very traditional Alpine regions) but the valleys are still remote enough - and the locals are extremely proud of their history - not to want to give up on things like the vulgo names.\n\nAnd why would we, it’s such a beautiful tradition!\n\nThere are ongoing initiatives to protect the still existing vulgo names (eg Unesco Intangible Heritage) and most importantly, to archive them so they are never lost."
