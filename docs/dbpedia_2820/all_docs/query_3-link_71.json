        "text": "What we hope to do here is to address the logic behind the long and vexed process of establishing the discipline of archaeology in Slovenian lands in the context of the cultural and political emancipation of the Slovene nation. The thing that draws one's attention from the start is the fact that there is hardly any indication in the Slovenian tradition of academic archaeology before the Second World War of involvement in nationalist discourse and confrontations, and we hope to be able to explain that beyond simplistic assertions of underdevelopment, and to point also to the existence of nationalist movements on the fringes of the discipline. We will attempt to demonstrate the rationale behind both grand projects and dramatic delays within the process.\n\nWhile in the modern world, ethnicity has become the politicization of culture, the old controversy over the relation between ethnicity and archaeology refuses to die. The first studies of that relation dealt primarily with what made the historical interpretation of the archaeological material dependent upon the political situation. Soon, the emphasis shifted to the link between archaeology and the beginnings of nationalism, especially the influence of Romanticism, the rise of the culture-history paradigm, and of the historical interest in ethnogenesis. Now, the emphasis is more on the role of archaeology in the shaping of social memory as past that may be used politically. This study focuses on the new trends in this research field, particularly those concerned with the social mobilization by means of the ancestors’ myths, with pseudo-archaeology, and the staging of historical authenticity through heritage tourism. The second part of the article highlights differences between approaches to ethnogenesis in the European and American archaeology and illustrates the latter by means of three key studies by Christopher Stojanowski, Scott Ortman, and Laurie Wilkie. To judge from the titles of the publications that came out in Eastern Europe and the United States over the last year, several common trends are apparent, along with significant divergences. Archaeology is increasingly perceived as the most important, if not the only way to understand the ethnicity of immigrants in the (medieval) past. Archaeologists have taken a front seat in all debates about ethnic identities. Instead of state authorities or the ideological pressure of various political regimes, the emphasis in Eastern Europe is now on individual archaeologists, the role of their life experience and of their education in the ethnic interpretation of the archaeological record. Meanwhile, in the Unites States, it is the ethnic identity of the archaeologists themselves that has now come under lens. In other words, agency is restored to archaeologists, who are now regarded as much more capable of original work and decision making than before. Finally, gender perspectives are now applied to the study of the relations between ethnicity, archaeology, and nationalism. In both Eastern Europe and the United States, there is a conspicuous interest in women archaeologists.\n\nSince the emergence of the debate on the relationship between nationalism and archaeology, mainly in the 1990s, most discussions have focused on the place that material culture dating from the prehistoric to the medieval period occupied, and still does, in nationalist narratives. In contrast, this volume goes beyond the chronological span usually dealt with by archaeologists to focus on the modern period. In its pages it is possible to find a range of examples of how material culture has been used (or prevented from being used) to reinforce nationalist narratives, from the fourteenth century until today. The way in which these narratives were and still are being developed is also a matter for discussion. An important focus of the book is to show how historical archaeologists potentially are exceptionally well-placed to analyse how the development of modern nationalism and national identity is reproduced in the post-medieval archaeological record, as it was during this period that political nationalism evolved. Moreover, this volume challenges the state of the art, because―by studying the failed nation, the aspiring nation, the nation-tobe, and the region as an intricate part of the nation―the authors have taken a starting point that is hard to find in other studies (which usually start with the idea of the successful nation). Geographically, this book demonstrates an emphasis on Europe, debating a few nationalist movements in northern and north-western Europe— Scotland, Manx, Ireland, Denmark—and Central Europe, as illustrated by Bavaria, Slovenia, and Carinthia. However, it also moves beyond that part of the world to include examples from Turkey, New Sweden, and New Mexico in the United States of America (US) and, finally, Easter Island.\n\nABSTRACT: In this introductory article an evaluation of the emergence and transformations of parallel discourses regarding the past in relation to the political nationalist context in which they were articulated will be offered. A chronological framework will be adopted, thereby acknowledging the importance of the changes nationalism underwent for understanding shifts in discourses on the past. - The study of the past in the pre-nationalist era - Civic nationalism and the institutionalisation of archaeology - Ethnic nationalism and culture-historical archaeology - In this volume The articles in this volume aim to explore the interaction between nationalism and archaeology as seen by archaeologists, historians and social scientists. The use of different pasts will be a central issue of debate. The role of archaeology as a provider of raw material to explain the historical character of the nation has been a two-sided coin. On the one hand, the primeval periods had an obvious role to play in the quest for unique Golden Ages that formed a glorious national past for a nation. On the other hand, in Europe and in America archaeology also offered the remains of the lost ‘Great Civilisations’ encountered in the colonial venture, a past which was also appropriated. This appropriation also influenced the study of the material remains from the Great Civilisations found in the metropolis, such as the pre-Columbian past in Mexico and the supposed Phoenician remains in England. The importance conferred on the great civilisations – and especially on the Roman period, but also on others such as the Greek and Egyptian periods – contrasted and colluded with the uniqueness of the past supplied by a local prehistoric and medieval archaeology. The result of these parallel pasts was nationalism's simultaneous use of several discourses regarding archaeology. Although tensions were particularly acute during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the by-products of these debates still exert a considerable influence. This is one of the key themes that these articles discuss."
