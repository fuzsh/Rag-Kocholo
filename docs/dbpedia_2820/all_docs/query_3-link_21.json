        "meta_description": "Stop here by the bust of Gustav Mahler.\r\n\r\nMahler was a famous composer, one of the leading conductors of his generation and also director of the Vienna Court Opera. The music school next to this park bears his name, too.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't born in Carinthia, but he used to spend the summertime between 1900 and 1907 here. He needed a quiet place where he could compose because it wasn't possible for him to do it in Vienna. So he built a small composing hut in Maiernigg, in the forests close to the southern shore of Lake Wörthersee. He later also built a villa directly on the lakeshore. The villa is now privately owned, so it can be viewed only from the water or opposite side of the lake. \r\n\r\nThe composing hut hosts a museum and is open for tourists and Mahler´s fans during the summer season from May to October from Thursday to Sunday between 10 am and 1 pm. You can reach it by taking a 15 minute walk on a forest path from the parking lot Bad Maiernigg. Sometimes there are also small concerts hosted at the hut.\r\n\r\nIn this composing hut, he created his best symphonies - the trilogy of orchestral symphonies, the Fifth, the Sixth and the Seventh were composed between 1901 and 1905. The Eighth Symphony, his most successful one, was written here one year later, in a record time of only eight weeks and Mahler dedicated it to his wife, Alma.\r\n\r\nHe married her in 1902 when he was already over 40 and Alma was 19 years younger than him. Alma, born Schindler, was musically active and a talented composer as well. Before they got married, Mahler wrote her a 20-page-long letter, where he explained his expectations of marriage and that he could not accept a competitor as a wife. So she had to decide - either marry him or continue composing. She married him and it didn't take long before they became parents of 2 daughters. The first one, Maria Anna, was born in 1902 and the second one, Anna, in 1904. \r\n\r\nThere was a topic, which went with Mahler his whole life long. He was born in south Moravia, eastern Bohemia, at that time part of the Austrian Empire, in a Jewish family and grew up in the town of Jihlava. His family belonged to a German-speaking minority among Bohemians. Gustav was born as the second son of altogether 14 children. Because of various childhood illnesses, only six of these children survived infancy. Young Gustav was especially bitter at the loss of his younger brother, who died after a long illness at the age of 13. Gustav Mahler sought to express his feelings in music.\r\n\r\nAlso during his time at Maiernigg, he worked on a song cycle called \"Kindertotenlieder\" - \"Songs on the Death of Children\". Alma scolded him for dealing with this topic while their own healthy daughters were playing outside in the garden. He was saying to him: \"You provoke fate, you paint a devil on the wall\". \r\n\r\nThe year 1907 was a tragic one for Mahler and his family. Soon after their arrival at Maiernigg, both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria and the older one, Maria Anna, died. Shortly thereafter, Mahler learned that his heart was defective and he also lost his job as a director of the Vienna Court Opera. He sold his properties on the lake Wörthersee and never returned.\r\n\r\nHe spent his last years in New York at the Metropolitan Opera and died in 1911. After the marriage crisis with Alma, Gustav Mahler regretted his behaviour and supported Alma in composing her own songs, which were also published.\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready, facing the music school, turn right to make your way to the street, Theatergasse. Then turn left to walk along it. You'll hear from me when you reach the pedestrian crossing further down the street.",
