        "text": "15-time All-Star Al Kaline of the Detroit Tigers was one of the premier baseball players of his generation, slugging 399 home-runs and amassing 3,007 hits in those less-statistics crazy times. (In this era, Kaline -- who announced his retirement before his final season of 1974 and stuck to it -- would have come back for another season to hit homer #400, one of the great benchmarks of that time, before steroids and human growth hormone made nonsense to the baseball power-hitting records in the late 1990s.) The winner of 10-gold gloves for fielding excellence, Kaline was greatly respected as an all-around star player with all the tools, like his contemporary Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox, who became the first American League Player to hit 400 dingers and 3,000 hits in 1979.\n\nKaline, who had the desire to excel at baseball, did not have the desire to upstage Yaz by pointing out that it was something he easily could have done, and was gracious when the Red Sox left fielder set the milestones in 1979. Perhaps Kaline could afford to be generous, for unlike Yaz, who was perpetually a bridesmaid and never a bride when it came to the post-season (Yaz's BoSox even lost the A.L. East pennant to Kaline and Billy Martin's Tigers by Tigers won the 1968 World's Championship. Distinct underdogs to the the same St. Louis Cardinals team, and post-season marvel Bob Gibson, who had beaten Yaz's \"Impssible Dream\" BoSox the year before and had whipped the last team of the great Yankees Dynasty, the '64 Bronx Bombers of Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard and Whitey Ford, the Tigers made history by staging one of the great upsets in World Series history. The '68 battle royal for the World's Championship was almost as good, and legendary, as the '67 Series, and like the previous match-up of the Cards and the American League contender, it had gone done to the seventh and deciding game. Though the Cardinals were mighty, it was the Tigers behind the pitching of donut-maven Mickey Lolich who prevailed. Al hit .379 with two homers and eight runs batted in during the Series, further establishing his credentials as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.\n\nAl Kaline had been signed as a \"Bonus Baby\" by the Tigers in 1953, and under the extant rules of Major League Baseball, had gone straight to the major league team, bypassing the minor leagues. (To justify the bonus, or rather, to limit the payout of large bonuses, MLB required teams signing young players to large bonuses to keep them on the major league roster for part of the year, every year, or lose them.) The 18-year old Kaline came up for a cup of coffee with the Tigers in 1953, and then played a total of 22 seasons for them, a record only surpassed by Yaz for the Red Sox and Brooks Robinson for the Baltimore Orioles, who in those pre-free-agent times, played a total of 23 years for the same team. Kaline blossomed early, winning his first and only batting title in 1955, at the tender age of 20, leading both leagues with a .340 average. Kaline became the youngest player ever to win a batting title, establishing that record by nosing out fellow Tiger Ty Cobb by one day.\n\nAlthough he never won a Most Valuable Player Award, Kaline ranked in the Top 10 in M.V.P. votes nine times between 1955 and 1967, coming in second in '55 and '63 and third in '56. Never a true power hitter, he was remarkably consistent and steady in his production, hitting a minimum of 25 homers seven times and hitting over .300 nine times, playing primarily in what is becoming known as baseball's second \"Dead Ball Era\". His superb fielding was a marvel, and he once went 242 consecutive games in the field without committing an error. Kaline was the type of player a general manager dreams of building a franchise around.\n\nFittingly, Al Kaline was known as \"Mr. Tiger\" when he retired after the 1974 season. Kaline was the most popular player in the Detroit franchise's history (the dyspeptic Cobb was a greater player and highly respected by Tigers fans, but not particularly beloved). After his election to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York in his first year of eligibility, his number 6 was the first number ever to be retired by the Tigers.\n\nCorin Redgrave, a towering, award-winning force on the British stage but a lesser universally recognized third-generation scion of the acting dynasty, was the reddish-haired middle brother of his more internationally famous sisters, Vanessa Redgrave and Lynn Redgrave who achieved widespread celebrity during their course of work on the American stage, film and TV.\n\nNevertheless Corin was a treasured actor in England and much less inspired to acquire the fame cast upon his sisters. The tall, amiably handsome actor built for an enviable career for himself on the British stage. Like Vanessa he was a fiery and impassioned political radical and embraced a host of liberal causes during his lifetime. Most notably, he was a potent member of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, and supported a motion to impeach Prime Minister Tony Blair following the British participation in the war in Iraq. He also campaigned for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2004, he, along with Vanessa, founded the Peace and Progress Party in 2004, which offered several candidates for the 2005 national election. He strongly believed that his early political activism impeded his nascent progress as an actor at the time, explaining the late bloom of his career.\n\nThe son of renowned actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson, Corin William was born in London, England on July 16, 1939. The patriarch and matriarch of the acting family was his paternal grandparents Roy Redgrave and Margaret Scudamore. Educated at Westminster public school and at King's College at the University of Cambridge, he inherited his parents' intense passion for acting and was determined to follow in the family's natural acting ways. His career took longer to ignite than older sister Vanessa, who quickly became an international star.\n\nCorin's first stage appearance at age 22 occurred auspiciously, however, at London's famed Royal Court Theatre in 1961 portraying Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" that was produced by Tony Richardson, Vanessa's husband-to-be. Following this he appeared in \"Twelfth Night\" and then appeared in \"Chips with Everything\" (also at the Royal) which eventually went to New York. Following theatre roles in \"The Right Honourable Gentleman\" (1964), \"Lady Windemere's Fan\" (1966) and \"Abelard and Heloise\" (1971), Corin joined the Royal Shakespeare Company for the 1972 season at Stratford and at the Aldwych, playing Octavius in both \"Julius Caesar\" and \"Antony and Cleopatra,\" as well as Ephesus in \"The Comedy of Errors\". Under the direction of David Thacker, a prominent British director of Arthur Miller works, he appeared in the Miller plays \"The Crucible\" at the Young Vic.\n\nAs for his early years on 1960s film, Corin appeared in several of his sisters' films. Making his debut in the unmemorable Nicht mit uns, Herr Kommissar (1964), he showed up with Vanessa in the films Ein Mann zu jeder Jahreszeit (1966), Angriff der leichten Brigade (1968), and Oh! What a Lovely War (1969) and in Lynn's Anruf für einen Toten (1967). He actually fared better at the time in classier TV productions such as David Copperfield (1970); a production of \"Dracula\" in 1969 (as Jonathan Harker); and in Antony and Cleopatra (1974) (as Octavius, his stage role). Corin enjoyed a rare lead movie role in the Australian-made Between Wars (1974) and also appeared in the well-received Excalibur (1981) before making a strong impression in the Daniel Day-Lewis starrer Im Namen des Vaters (1993). Often playing gentlemen of strong authority and nobility, his on-camera career seemed to hit its stride as a character performer in later years.\n\nElsewhere, Corin and sister Vanessa founded the Moving Theatre company in 1993, that proved an exciting and creative outlet for their acting and directing ambitions. He went on to portray a critically acclaimed King Lear and also appeared opposite Vanessa and second wife Kika Markham in a successful revival of Noël Coward's \"A Song at Twilight\". Even better, he played the brutal prison warden Boss Whalen in the \"lost\" Tennessee Williams' work \"Not About Nightingales\" for which he won a 1998 Olivier Award and was nominated for a Tony award a year later. In 2000 he appeared in Trevor Nunn's production of Chekov's \"The Cherry Orchard\" at the National.\n\nAn occasional playwright (\"Bluntly Speaking\"), Corin also authored a very well-received book about his tormented father, \"Michael Redgrave: My Father,\" which was hailed for its candid examination of both his father's bisexuality and BBC \"blacklisting\" (for his alleged ties with the Communist party).\n\nCorin was plagued by illness come the millennium. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000 and suffered a serious heart attack in 2005. Rebounding however, he appeared in the one-man play \"Tynan\" in 2007, and made a triumphant return to the London stage in late March of 2009 playing the title role in \"Trumbo,\" which is based on the life of blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. The actor dedicated his opening-night performance to the memory of his niece, actress Natasha Richardson, who had just died earlier in the month of injuries sustained in a Canadian skiing accident.\n\nRedgrave's first marriage to former model Deirdre Hamilton-Hill (they divorced and she later died of cancer in 1997) produced son Luke and actress/daughter Jemma Redgrave. He subsequently married actress Kika Markham and had two more sons, Harvey and Arden. Thriving on stage, TV and film as late as 2009, the 70-year-old Corin died in a London hospital after a short illness in April of 2010.\n\nEileen Evelyn Greer Garson was born on September 29, 1904 in London, England, to Nancy Sophia (Greer) and George Garson, a commercial clerk. Of Scottish and Ulster-Scots descent, Garson displayed no early interest in becoming an actress. Educated at the University of London intending to become a teacher, she opted instead to take a job at an advertising agency. During her off hours she appeared in local theatrical productions, gaining a reputation as an extremely talented and charismatic performer. During a stage production of \"Old Music,\" Garson was offered a studio contract by MGM Vice President of Production Louis B. Mayer while he was on a visit to London looking for new talent. Garson's very first film under that arrangement was the immensely popular Auf Wiedersehen, Mr. Chips (1939), earning her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress - the first of six she would receive. The following year would see Greer in the highly acclaimed Stolz und Vorurteil (1940) as \"Elizabeth Bennet\". 1941 saw her earn a second nomination for her role as Edna Gladney in Blüten im Staub (1941), but it was the moving, if propagandist, Mrs. Miniver (1942), in a role that she would forever be known by, that actually brought her the Oscar statuette as Best Actress.\n\nAs Marie Curie in Madame Curie (1943), she would draw yet another nomination, and the same the next year in Mrs. Parkington (1944). It began to seem that any movie she was part of would be an automatic success. Sure enough, in 1945, she won yet another nomination, for her role as \"Mary Rafferty\" in Die Entscheidung (1945). Still, Garson began to chafe at the unbroken stream of \"noble woman\" roles in which the studio was casting her. MGM felt that they had an winning formula and saw no compelling reason to alter it. Two standard seven-year contract extensions kept her at MGM until 1954 when, by mutual consent, she left the only studio she had ever known. In 1946, Greer appeared in Mann ohne Herz (1945), which was a flop at the box-office. 1947's Desire Me (1947) was no less a disaster, downward spiral finally arrested with the hit Das Schicksal der Irene Forsyte (1949). The next year, she reprised her role as \"Kay Miniver\" in Ihr Geheimnis (1950), though audiences were unsurprisingly put off by her character's untimely demise from cancer, leaving screen husband Walter Pidgeon to soldier on alone.\n\nFor the remainder of the 1950s, she endured several predictably unappreciated films. Then, 1960 found her cast in the role of Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello (1960). This film was, perhaps, her finest work and landed her seventh and final Academy Award nomination. Her final screen appearances were in Dominique, die singende Nonne (1966) as \"Mother Prioress\" and Der glücklichste Millionär (1967). After a few TV movies, Garson retired to the New Mexico ranch she shared with her husband, millionaire Buddy E.E. Fogelson. She concentrated on the environment and other various charities. By the 1980s, she was suffering from chronic heart problems, prompting her to slow down. That was the cause of her death on April 6, 1996 in Dallas, Texas, at age 91."
