        "text": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, born on January 27, 1756 in Salzburg, Austria, was a maestro of the classical era, and profoundly influential in European music. His prodigious talent became apparent when he penned his first composition at the age of five, demonstrating an innate musical genius that was to set him apart. As a child, he toured with his family across Europe, performing for royalty and dazzling audiences with both his performing and composing abilities. Mozart's creative output was unparalleled, numbering more than 800 works including symphonies, operas, chamber music, sonatas, choral pieces, and concertos - many of which are considered pinnacles of these genres. His compositions, such as \"The Marriage of Figaro\", \"Don Giovanni\", and \"The Magic Flute\", reveal a composer of extraordinary versatility and prolificacy. Despite his short life span, Mozart's impact on classical music is profound and enduring. Regrettably, Mozart grappled with financial difficulties during his lifetime. Struggling to find a stable patron and constantly seeking commissions, he often lived beyond his means. His untimely death on December 5, 1791, at the age of 35, was shrouded in mystery, leading to various legends and myths surrounding the circumstances. Yet, there's no denying the fact that Mozart‚Äôs legacy lives on, his timeless compositions continue to enchant audiences worldwide, and his influence on successive generations of composers remains unsurpassed.\n\nLudwig van Beethoven, a remarkable figure in the world of classical music, emerged from the late 18th century as one of the most influential composers in Western history. Born in December 1770 in Bonn, Germany, Beethoven was imbued with musical talent at an early age, encouraged by his father, a musician in the Electoral court. His father's rigorous and sometimes harsh training regime honed Beethoven's skills as a pianist. By the time he was a teenager, Beethoven had already mastered the organ and violin, and was composing his music. Beethoven's musical prowess grew under the tutelage of renowned composers like Christian Gottlob Neefe and Franz Joseph Haydn. His move to Vienna in 1792 marked a significant expansion in his career. The city's vibrant musical culture acted as a fertile ground for his creativity, culminating in compositions that broke away from classical traditions, thereby heralding the dawn of the Romantic era in music. Despite facing the daunting challenge of progressive hearing loss, which began around 1796 and led to total deafness, Beethoven's determination remained undeterred. He continued to compose, producing many of his best-known works during this period, including the iconic \"Symphony No. 9\" and \"Moonlight Sonata.\" Beethoven's legacy is a vast oeuvre of symphonies, sonatas, concertos, and quartets that have enriched the world's musical heritage. His works are hailed for their technical complexity, emotional depth, and innovative use of form. His life journey and extraordinary achievements continue to inspire musicians and music lovers worldwide, cementing his status as a titan in the realm of classical music.\n\nFranz Peter Schubert (German: [ˈfʁant͡s ˈpeːtɐ ˈʃuːbɐt]; 31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast oeuvre, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly Lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (Trout Quintet), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (Unfinished Symphony), the three last piano sonatas (D. 958–960), the opera Fierrabras (D. 796), the incidental music to the play Rosamunde (D. 797), and the song cycles Die schöne Müllerin (D. 795) and Winterreise (D. 911). Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert's uncommon gifts for music were evident from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his older brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher; despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was granted admission to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis. Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased significantly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers of the 19th century, and his music continues to be popular.\n\nJohannes Brahms (German: [joˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms]; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, pianist, and conductor of the Romantic period. Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, Brahms spent much of his professional life in Vienna, Austria. His reputation and status as a composer are such that he is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the \"Three Bs\" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow. Brahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, and voice and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. He worked with some of the leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire. An uncompromising perfectionist, Brahms destroyed some of his works and left others unpublished. Brahms has been considered, by his contemporaries and by later writers, as both a traditionalist and an innovator. His music is firmly rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. While many contemporaries found his music too academic, his contribution and craftsmanship have been admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The diligent, highly constructed nature of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers. Embedded within his meticulous structures, however, are deeply romantic motifs.\n\nJohann Strauss II (born Johann Baptist Strauss; 25 October 1825 – 3 June 1899), also known as Johann Strauss Jr., the Younger, the Son (German: Sohn), son of Johann Strauss I, was an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as \"The Waltz King\", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Strauss had two younger brothers, Josef and Eduard Strauss, who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well known as their elder brother. Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include \"The Blue Danube\", \"Kaiser-Walzer\" (Emperor Waltz), \"Tales from the Vienna Woods\", and the \"Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka\". Among his operettas, Die Fledermaus and Der Zigeunerbaron are the best known."
