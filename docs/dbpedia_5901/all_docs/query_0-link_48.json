        "text": "Reviewed by Colin Jacobson (July 21, 2024)\n\n1991âs Cape Fear brings us a Martin Scorsese-directed remake of the 1962 original film. The question becomes whether it delivers a successful adaptation of that classic.\n\nMax Cady (Robert De Niro) serves 14 years for rape and emerges from prison. First item on Cadyâs agenda? Track down Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte), the lawyer he holds responsible for his incarceration.\n\nCady slowly insinuates himself into Samâs world, with an emphasis on wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and teen daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The ex-con determines to make the attorneyâs life miserable as revenge for his imprisonment.\n\nWhen I saw Scorseseâs Fear in 1991, I did so with virtually no foreknowledge of its 1962 predecessor. I knew the 1991 film got good reviews, though, and given that it came with a stellar cast and crew, I figured Iâd enjoy it.\n\nNope. I found the 1991 Fear to seem too campy and over the top to turn into an effective thriller.\n\nNearly 33 years later, does the 1991 Fear work better for me at 57 than it did at 24? Not really, as the same issues I discerned in 1991 persist in 2024.\n\nScorsese creates a complete triumph of style over substance. The film delivers one self-consciously showy, strange visual choice after another, like the shots of Lange in negative during sex.\n\nHonestly, Fear feels like a parody of melodrama. Much of the movie seems like a caricature, as it seems oddly lurid without purpose and it becomes laughable in its excessiveness.\n\nFearcontinues a lot of the showier techniques from GoodFellas but in an obnoxious way. In the earlier film, those created a thrilling sense of vibrancy to communicate the charactersâ highs.\n\nHere, however, we end up with hyperactive moves and symbolism so obvious that it becomes eye-rolling. Scorsese allows for no subtlety, as he just pounds home his themes and melodrama.\n\n33 years down the road, I still donât know if Scorsese thought his Fear delivered a bracing update on the original or if he intended to create something so over the top. The 1991 movie comes awfully close to parody as it explores its characters and story.\n\nAgain, perhaps Scorsese wanted that. Maybe he preferred a thriller that semi-mocked the genre to one that played it straight.\n\nWhatever the case, it doesnât work, especially compared with the highly effective 1962 version. Robert Mitchumâs Cady offered a dark and insidious force, whereas De Niroâs just seems like a cartoon.\n\nAnd a ridiculously powerful one at that. The 1991 Cady offers a superhuman force who bears no connection to reality.\n\nWith a Hee Haw accent and a pumped-up body, De Niro fits this goofy motif. He overacts a storm and adds to the silliness.\n\nThe 1991 Fear brings back 1962 actors Mitchum, Gregory Peck and Martin Balsam for small parts. In a fun twist, Peck and Mitchum play against type.\n\nThey deliver some of the filmâs only enjoyable moments. Too much of the 1991 Fear just seems ridiculous and too melodramatic for its own good.\n\nCape Fear appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 2.35:1 on this Blu-ray Disc. Though largely appealing, the image suffered from sporadic issues.\n\nSharpness turned into one of these domains, as delineation could vary. While the majority of the movie displayed appropriate clarity, the movie could also feel a bit tentative at times.\n\nSome of that stemmed from occasional instances of edge haloes. Those didnât come across as heavy but they created a few distractions and left the movie with an âovercrankedâ look when they occurred.\n\nNeither jagged edges nor shimmering occurred. I saw no print flaws, and a decent layer of grain appeared, though I wondered if a bit of grain reduction popped up during interiors.\n\nColors seemed adequate, as the filmâs fairly natural palette showed fairly positive reproduction. While the tones didnât come across as memorable, they usually showed appropriate impact.\n\nBlacks felt reasonably deep â albeit a little inky at times â and shadows offered mostly positive clarity. Though more than watchable, the imageâs inconsistency meant if became a âB-â presentation.\n\nAs for the filmâs DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack, it worked fine for its vintage. Though the mix didnât always sizzle, it packed a decent punch when necessary.\n\nMusic showed good stereo presence, and the various channels contributed solid engagement to the side and rear. Much of the material remained atmospheric, but the movieâs wilder scenes â like those on the water or with thunder â managed to open up the side and rear speakers in a dynamic manner.\n\nAudio quality also seemed fine. Speech was reasonably natural and concise, while music showed acceptable pep and clarity.\n\nEffects brought us accurate enough material, though some mild distortion cropped up at times. The soundtrack held up well over the last 33 years.\n\nThe Blu-ray comes with a mix of extras, and these launch with >B>The Making of Cape Fear. In this one-hour, 20-minute, one-second documentary, we hear from director Martin Scorsese, screenwriter Wesley Strick, producer Barbara De Fina, production designer Henry Bumstead, editor Thelma Schoomaker, optical photograpy David S. Williams Jr., special optical effects Bill Taylor, composer Elmer Bernstein, and actors Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Juliette Lewis, and Gregory Peck.\n\nThe program looks at what attracted Scorsese to the project and its development, story and characters, cast and performances, sets and locations, photography and aspect ratio, editing, stunts and effects, music, the opening credits, and the movieâs release.\n\nWith 80 minutes at its disposal and most of the productionâs primary participants, this becomes a terrific look at the filmâs creation. It gets into the nuts and bolts and becomes a compelling take on the topics.\n\nNext comes Behind the Scenes of the Fourth of July Parade. It runs two minutes, 12 seconds and shows behind the scenes footage for that scene. We get a few interesting elements but this doesnât add up to much.\n\nOn the Set of the Houseboat goes for one minute, 44 seconds and offers material along the same lines of âParadeâ. It fares about the same.\n\n10 Deleted Scenes fill a total of nine minutes, 15 seconds. These focus on added character beats and exposition, most of which relate to the Bowden family, though the last few involve Cady as well.\n\nNone of them seem especially useful or memorable. Though some feel like they should flesh out matters, they just tend to come across as redundant or without real narrative value.\n\nUnder Photograph Montages, we split into three subdomains: âThe Physical Transformation of Robert De Niroâs Max Cadyâ (two minutes, 58 seconds), âThe Cast of Cape Fearâ (3:52) and âMartin Scorsese Directs Cape Fearâ (2:11).\n\nâCadyâ mainly just shows images of De Niro from the film, so it seems forgettable. The same goes for âCastâ, which offers little of interest beyond a few promo pictures.\n\nâDirectsâ focuses on behind the scenes shots and seems more compelling. All three lose points because the elements never got an upgrade from DVD quality and they look mushy.\n\nDuring the 11-minute, 42-second Opening Credits, we get a montage that lets us see samples of the work of Saul Bass. Because I figured this would give us details about the creation of the Cape Fear credits, it becomes a disappointment.\n\nIn addition to the filmâs trailer, the disc finishes with Matte Paintings. It presents a 54-second reel that shows those works on their own and then as integrated into the film. Expect a moderately interesting reel.\n\nMartin Scorsese provides a campy thriller via 1991âs Cape Fear. More laughable than scary, the movieâs absurd melodrama robs it of impact. The Blu-ray comes with generally positive but somewhat inconsistent picture and audio along with a good array of bonus materials. I didnât think much of Scorseseâs Fear in 1991 and it hasnât grown on me with age."
