        "text": "Megan Porter, aspiring screenwriter studying Filmmaking at the University of Oklahoma, is today’s film enthusiast. Check out her review of the 60’s classic, “Cape Fear,” below.\n\nAbout me\n\nMovies have been a part of my life since I can remember, whether it was hiding behind a couch scared because my brother wouldn’t turn off “Child’s Play,” or watching “The Lost Boys” every day until I finally became sick of it. I’ve always had a passion for film because it can have so many different effects on your life.\n\nThere is always that movie you turn on when you’re having a bad day – the movie you must introduce to every new person you meet – the movie you need for a day where thinking just feels like a lost cause, and then there are the movies you watch when you need a fictional character to relate to.\n\nAs a screenwriter, I am drawn most to the movies that people can relate to. While watching a movie that is an escape is always great, there is just something special that comes with watching a movie that feels familiar. With that being said, I am not going to write about one of those films.\n\n‘Cape Fear’ (1962)\n\n“You just put the law in my hands and I’m gonna break your heart with it. Ain’t nothin’ can stop me. You understand that don’t you? That house and that car and that wife and that kid they ain’t nothing to you now. I got somethin’ planned for your wife and kid that they ain’t nevah gonna forget. They ain’t nevah gonna forget it… and neither will you, Counselor!” –Robert Mitchum as Max Cady\n\nIn 1961, Gregory Peck read a book titled “The Executioners” and immediately knew he wanted to make it into a film. At that time, he was filming “The Guns of Navarone” with director J. Lee Thompson. He liked what he had seen from Thompson, gave him the book, and told him that if he liked it then he wanted him to direct the movie. Thus began the process of making one of the best psychological thrillers, “Cape Fear.”\n\nThe film follows Sam Bowden, a lawyer whose happy life comes to a halt once convicted rapist Max Cady comes back into town with a vengeance. Bowden was the key witness that put Cady away for 8 years on an assault charge, and Cady has yet to forget it. As Cady continues to taunt Bowden with threats against his wife and daughter, Bowden becomes more and more desperate to get rid of him as the film goes on.\n\nThompson and Peck knew that Cady’s character was going to steal the show, and casting had to be perfect. Their thought of perfection lied with Robert Mitchum. Their choice was right, because the movie wouldn’t have been the same without Mitchum’s portrayal of the drunken, terrifying miscreant. The film also brought in familiar faces like Martin Balsam (“Psycho”) and Telly Savalas (“Kojak”) as the supporting cast. However, the star of the film might be the score composed by the infamous Bernard Herrmann, who was most famous for his work on several Alfred Hitchcock films including “Psycho.”\n\nAs they finished filming, the studios told Thompson that they didn’t want any blood, violence or violence against women in the film. So what’s a director supposed to do when the entire movie is set around violence against women? Thompson had to cut down scenes considerably throughout the film which left more imagination up to the audience. Rather than a film that shows everything, it held it’s enticement in the suggested intentions of Max Cady, and they cut it together very well.\n\nThis film set the bar for psychological thrillers and is still a popular film today. In 1991, Martin Scorsese remade “Cape Fear” with Nick Nolte portraying Bowden and Robert De Niro as Cady. While Scorsese can do no wrong, there are just some aspects of his rendition that don’t compete with the original. The performances by Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum are two of them.\n\nFun Fact: Gregory Peck thought that the original title, “The Executioners,” wouldn’t sell tickets. He thought that geographical names had more of a selling point such as films like Casablanca. Peck put his finger on a map and traced up the Atlantic Coast until he came across Cape Fear River in North Carolina. He decided it was the perfect title for the film.\n\nRun time: 105 min.\n\nMPAA rating: NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes: 95 percent"
