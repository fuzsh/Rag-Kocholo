Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese brings heart-pounding suspense to one of the most acclaimed thrillers of all time. Fourteen years after being imprisoned, vicious psychopath Max Cady (Robert De Niro) emerges with a single-minded mission: to seek revenge on his attorney Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Cady becomes a terrifying presence as he menacingly circles Bowden's increasingly unstable family. Realizing he is legally powerless to protect his beautiful wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and his troubled teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis), Sam resorts to unorthodox measures which lead to an unforgettable showdown on Cape Fear. Visually stunning images and brilliant performances from a talented cast highlight this roller-coaster ride through relentless psychological torment.",

        "text": "Yet the grubby story is elevated by a superior cast in both the original and this grimly bloodthirsty remake.\n\nAugust 14, 2023\n\nEver shot reminds you that a consummate artist is having a great time remaking a kinky minor classic.\n\nApril 21, 2023\n\nEverything is relatively dirty, and no one is truly good, except for this film, it's phenomenal. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nJanuary 4, 2023\n\n(De Niro) had played a tough guy before, but never quite like this: a very sinister, very jagged, very dangerous character… put that together with Martin Scorsese at possibly the peak of his powers, and it’s a delightful if slightly scary film.\n\nMay 6, 2022\n\nMartin Scorsese wasn't supposed to remake the 1962 thriller, but when he did, he brought along his longtime muse and infused the story with an overwhelming amount of trademark chaos...\n\nNovember 20, 2021\n\nIt's a mess, really. But what a mess! Why do we call Scorsese one of the great filmmakers of his generation? Because, like all the great ones, even when he fails he fails with style and with wit.\n\nAugust 17, 2021\n\nThe wrath of De Niro, especially when pitched to the level of a jangle-brained Jehovah, is a mighty thing, but, in this case, its inherent cartoonery capsizes this film's small-story frame.\n\nNovember 19, 2019"
