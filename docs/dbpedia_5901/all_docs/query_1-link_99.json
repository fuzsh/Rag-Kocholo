        "text": "OCALA - In the waning days of World War II, high school pals Ray Musleh and Patrick O'Neal spent many a noon hour perched in the back of a flatbed truck in the Ocala National Forest, eating boxed lunches of fried chicken and potato salad with Gregory Peck.\n\nThe Marion County teens had landed jobs as general laborers on the set of MGM's film production of \"The Yearling,\" based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. For hauling equipment and other odd jobs in the hot summer sun, they received 50 cents a day.\n\nSet in the hardscrabble rustic Florida of Rawlings' upbringing, \"The Yearling\" is the tender tale of a young boy named Jody who adopts an orphan deer fawn, only to have his heart broken by the harsh lessons of country life. Peck, a stage actor who had just established his film stardom with roles in \"The Keys of the Kingdom\" and \"Spellbound,\" was playing Jody's father, Penny Baxter.\n\nO'Neal wanted to pursue acting, and took every opportunity he could to seek advice from Peck. Before long the trio became regular lunchtime companions, recalls Musleh, 73, of Ocala.\n\n\"Patrick O'Neal was bent on going into the acting business and going to Hollywood. He was talking to Gregory Peck, who was very helpful and gave him a lot of advice. I guess this was going on every day,\" Musleh said.\n\nThat description of a cordial gentlemen who never displayed the inflated ego of a movie star was typical for Peck, who died at age 87 early Thursday morning.\n\n\"He was a down-to-earth guy, Gregory Peck was,\" Musleh said. \"There was one time I was chopping down a palm tree they wanted out of the way. I hit my knee and cut it; it was bandaged up for a few days. Greg always asked me, 'How's that knee today?' \"\n\nThe stars and crew of \"The Yearling\" stayed at the Tourist Court at Silver Springs Attraction, and traveled into the Ocala National Forest to film at Pat's Island. A number of locals were employed by the production; Musleh said Peck patterned the cracker accent he used in the film after the real-life residents of the Forest.\n\nDuring the shoot in Florida, Jacqueline White played the role of Jody's mother, but her scenes were dropped after it was decided she looked too young. Jane Wyman took over the role when \"The Yearling\" left the location shoot for the interior scenes filmed at the studio.\n\nThe May 15, 1945, edition of the Ocala Star-Banner recounted the first day of shooting the previous day. A crew of 100 people loaded up in trucks at about 6 a.m. for the drive into the Forest, returning that evening. \"There was little glamour to be found in the movie's two leading characters as they returned from the day's work in costume, Peck in jeans and faded shirt and wearing an aged straw hat, and Miss White in an ankle-length gingham dress. Makeup hid a complexion which has been widely admired.\"\n\nAnother item notes the U.S. armed forces provided the producers with a batch of the newly developed DDT spray in a vain attempt to keep mosquitoes at bay.\n\nA previous incarnation of \"The Yearling\" had started shooting in Marion County around 1941 with Spencer Tracy in the role Peck eventually played, but production halted shortly after starting for reasons never made public. MGM officials blamed the start of the war; rumor had it Tracy had trouble adjusting to the harsh environment -- back then, few buildings in Ocala had air conditioning.\n\nAccording to Star-Banner columnist Frances DeVore, the film crew stayed mostly to themselves at their Silver Springs accommodations. Most evenings after shooting had ended and the attraction guests departed, Peck and other members of the crew would go swimming in the aquifer-fed springs. DeVore's son, the late Richard Lytle, was the spitting image of actor Claude Jarman Jr., who played Jody. Although Lytle was deemed too short to work as Jarman's stand-in, he was often kept on the set to play with Jarman, along with the son and daughter of a Silver Springs employee.\n\n\"Gregory Peck was the most marvelous, gentle, courteous, lovable person,\" DeVore said.\n\nMany locals played extras in the movie, but Ocala residents didn't crush Peck and the other actors with attention, she said.\n\n\"We appreciated these movie people, but we weren't, 'Oh my God.' \"\n\nAlthough Peck was universally described as very open and friendly, the movie producers were extremely protective of him and were \"careful to keep him away from any commotion,\" DeVore said.\n\nThat protectiveness eventually cost O'Neal and Musleh their jobs. They were hanging around Peck all the time, Peck giving O'Neal advice on his acting career, including suggesting names of acting schools he should attend, according to Musleh. All the attention made the MGM officials leery.\n\n\"The producers didn't like this, and they fired (O'Neal),\" Musleh said. \"And then a day or two later I got fired for sleeping on the job.\"\n\nPerhaps some of Peck's advice worked. O'Neal, who died in 1994, went on to a successful career on stage and screen, including roles on TV's \"Perry Mason\" and \"The Doris Day Show,\" and the films \"The Stepford Wives\" and \"Under Siege.\"\n\nAnd \"The Yearling\" enjoyed both commercial and critical success, garnering seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Peck, and winning in the categories of Art Direction and Cinematography.\n\nThe moment that stands out most in Musleh's memory is the scene where Penny Baxter shoots the rattlesnake that killed the fawn's mother. As Musleh tells it, famed herpetologist Ross Allen brought the snake in a sack, pulled it out by the head and set it down on the ground in coil. Peck himself, not a stuntman, blew the snake's head off with one shot using live ammunition.\n\n\"Gregory Peck fired the gun; I was standing right in back of him. Then he turned and the director, Clarence Brown, said 'Good shot,' \" Musleh said. \"Everybody out on the set liked (Peck).\"\n\nPeck returned to the area once more, in 1995, for a live conversation with fans in Gainesville. Peck and his wife were given a private boat tour of Silver Springs, then stopped at the now-defunct Peppertree Inn restaurant in Ocala. It was around 4:30 in the afternoon, so the eatery was virtually deserted as Peck enjoyed the special of the day, rolled stuffed eggplant, with his wife and two guests.\n\nAfter the meal, waitress Jeannine Muscato Smith of Silver Springs Shores asked him to take a photograph, but the camera batteries were dead. Peck promised to send a picture, and autographed the menu.\n\n\"He was a very, very gracious man, very sweet,\" Smith said.\n\nA short time later, Peppertree owner Peter DelToro received a signed photograph from Peck wishing him luck. He still has that photo and the menu, both framed.\n\n\"That was the best publicity I ever had. Everybody came in and wanted to know where he was, and wanted to sit in his seat,\" DelToro said. \"I got a lot more business out of that than any ad I ever took out in the newspaper!\"\n\nChristopher Lloyd is entertainment editor at the Star-Banner.

He represents integrity, compassion and honesty. His star shone brightly for a long time, and now it will continue to shine in heaven,\" said Kirk Douglas. \"We talked so often about doing a picture together, and I am sad that we never got to do one.\"\n\nPeck's \"legacy not only lies in his films, but in the dignified, decent and moral way in which he worked and lived,\" said Steven Spielberg. \"He was the reigning father of the actor.\"\n\nFinch earned Peck his final Hollywood honor, placing No. 1 last week on the American Film Institute's list of top 50 heroes in U.S. movies.\n\n\"I put everything I had into it - all my feelings and everything I'd learned in 46 years of living, about family life and fathers and children,\" Peck said in 1989, recalling the role. \"And my feelings about racial justice and inequality and opportunity.\"\n\nSpokesman Friedman said Peck had not been suffering from any particular ailments. Friedman said Peck's wife told him she held his hand as the actor slipped off to sleep and died.\n\n\"He had just been getting older and more fragile,\" Friedman said. \"He just sort of ran his course and died of old age.\"\n\nOff-screen as well as on, Peck conveyed a quiet dignity. He had one amicable divorce, and scandal never touched him. He served as president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences and was active in the Motion Picture and Television Fund, American Cancer Society, National Endowment for the Arts and other causes.\n\n\"He was more than a great man. He was a complete and total gentleman,\" said Polly Bergen, who played Peck's wife in the 1962 thriller \"Cape Fear.\" \"One of the dearest I've worked with. He taught me chess between scenes.\"\n\nPeck's lanky, gaunt-cheeked good looks, measured speech and courtly demeanor quickly established him as star material in the 1940s.\n\nHe made his film debut in 1944's \"Days of Glory,\" a tale of Russian peasants coping with Nazi occupation. The next year, Peck played a priest in his second film, \"Keys to the Kingdom,\" which brought him his first Oscar nomination.\n\nThree more nominations soon followed: for 1946's \"The Yearling,\" the family classic about a boy and his pet fawn; for 1947's best-picture winner \"Gentleman's Agreement,\" in which Peck played a reporter posing as a Jew to expose anti-Semitism in America; and for 1949's \"Twelve O'Clock High,\" with Peck as a World War II flight leader coming unglued under the pressures of command.\n\nOther films included Alfred Hitchcock's \"Spellbound,\" the Ernest Hemingway adaptation \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro,\" the corporate-America critique \"The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit\" and the nuclear-Armageddon tale \"On the Beach.\"\n\nPeck played Gen. Douglas MacArthur in \"MacArthur,\" Lincoln in the TV miniseries \"The Blue and the Grey\" and F. Scott Fitzgerald in \"Beloved Infidel.\"\n\nRoles became scarce late in his career. He played writer Ambrose Bierce in 1989's \"Old Gringo\" and the owner of a company targeted for a hostile takeover in the 1991 Danny DeVito comedy \"Other People's Money.\"\n\n\"It was an honor to know him. It was an honor to have worked with him,\" DeVito said. \"He was gentle, sweet and generous.\"\n\nAmong Peck's final roles were playful revisitations of his past films. In the 1998 TV miniseries \"Moby Dick,\" Peck had a small part as a fire-and-brimstone preacher, a role Orson Welles played in the 1956 movie version in which Peck starred as Capt. Ahab.\n\nMartin Scorsese's 1991 remake of \"Cape Fear\" cast Peck and Robert Mitchum in a reversal of the good and evil types they played in the 1962 original. Mitchum, the vengeful ex-con who terrorized Peck and his family in the original, played a sympathetic policeman in the new version, while Peck played the ex-con's vile lawyer in the remake.\n\nBorn Eldred Gregory Peck on April 5, 1916, in La Jolla, Calif., Peck had a disjointed childhood after his parents divorced when he was 6. He was shuffled back and forth between them for two years, lived two more years with his maternal grandmother, then was sent at age 10 to a Roman Catholic military school in Los Angeles.\n\nAn English major at the University of California, Berkeley, Peck was lured into acting when the director of the campus little theater accosted him and said he needed a tall actor for a stage version of \"Moby Dick.\"\n\nPeck appeared in five more plays his last year at college, then went to New York City, where he studied with Sanford Meisner and Martha Graham, did summer stock and made his Broadway debut with the lead in Emlyn Williams' \"Morning Star.\"\n\nAfter his first few films, Peck was soon under non-exclusive contracts to four studios; he refused an exclusive pact with MGM despite Louis B. Mayer's tearful pleading. With most male stars absent in the war, the studios desperately needed strong leading men. Peck was exempt from service because of an old back injury.\n\nA Roosevelt New Dealer, Peck campaigned for Harry Truman in 1948 \"at a time when nobody thought he had a chance to win.\" He continued championing liberal causes, producing an anti-Vietnam War film in 1972, \"The Trial of the Catonsville Nine\" and helping the campaign against the nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court in 1987.\n\nPeck married his first wife, Greta, in 1942 and they had three sons, Jonathan, Stephen and Carey. Jonathan, a TV reporter, committed suicide at age 30. After his divorce in 1954, Peck married Veronique Passani, a Paris reporter. They had two children, Anthony and Cecilia, both actors."
