        "text": "Did the movie “Cape Fear” – either the 1962 version with Gregory Peck and a spooky Robert Mitchum or its 1991 remake by Martin Scorsese – have anything to do with the real Cape Fear?\n\nJames Duke of Wilmington wanted to know. So I checked again and poked around any more, and the answer is still the same:\n\nSo far as we can tell, no.\n\nBoth vintage thrillers are set in a small, rather steamy Southern town near the coast. A mysterious, sinister drifter – Mitchum in the first version, Robert De Niro in the remake – arrives and starts to stalk an upright, straight-arrow lawyer (Peck and later Nick Nolte) and his family.\n\nNobody, not even the law, can seem to stop this guy, even when he threatens the lawyer’s teenaged daughter. A chase ensues through the swamps.\n\nThe town isn’t Wilmington, though.\n\nBoth movies were based on a 1957 novel – originally titled “The Executioners” – by John D. MacDonald, the mystery writer who created the popular gumshoe Travis McGee. More than a dozen films and TV movies have been adapted from MacDonald’s prolific works.\n\nMacDonald’s home turf, however, is steamy coastal Florida, and the towns of “Harper” and “New Essex,” where the book is based, seem to be in the Sunshine State.\n\nNor was either movie filmed here. Locations for the 1962 “Cape Fear” were shot in and around Savannah and at a marina in northern California, according to Internet Movie Database. (The seedy hotel, however, where Mitchum hangs out, is none other than the “Mother Bates” house from the movie “Psycho” on the Universal Studios lot.)\n\nThe 1991 “Cape Fear” also used Savannah, along with locations around Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, Fla.\n\nSo, why did they change the name from “The Executioners” to “Cape Fear”? I’ve looked, and I still have no idea. Maybe the name just sounded cool.\n\nThe movie DID have a couple of Wilmington connections, though.\n\nPolly Bergen, who plays Peck’s wife in the 1962 “Cape Fear,” had been in Wilmington at least twice for the Azalea Festival – once in 1955 as a celebrity (along with Kim Hunter of “A Streetcar Named Desire”) and again in 1956 as Azalea Queen.\n\nAnd Nolte was a frequent Wilmington presence in the 1980s. He filmed “Weeds” here with Joe Mantegna and “Ghostbuster” Ernie Hudson in late 1986 and early 1987. (That drama, about ex-cons rehabilitated through musical theater, had nothing to do with the current Showtime series.)\n\nThen he followed up with “Everybody Wins” in 1989, a crime drama with Debra Winger. (The film went nowhere, despite a script by Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller.)\n\nNolte popped up all around town, according to old StarNews clips, shopping downtown and dining at the old Middle of the Island on Wrightsville Beach. Apparently, he even owned a condo around here for a while.\n\nNeither of them, though, shot “Cape Fear” here. That must be another Cape of a different name."
