        "text": "A TV series based on Universal’s “Cape Fear” is in the works with Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Nick Antosca.\n\nThe show, which is in development from UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group, and Amblin, would mark Scorsese and Spielberg’s first ever TV project together. They executive produce with Antosca, who is also the showrunner and created true crime and horror dramas like “Channel Zero,” “The Act” and “Brand New Cherry Flavor.” Other executive producers include Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey from Amblin Television and Alex Hedlund from Eat the Cat.\n\nHere’s the logline for the “Cape Fear” re-imagining: “A storm is coming for a pair of married attorneys when an infamous killer from their past gets released after years in prison. A tense, contemporary thriller that examines America’s obsession with true crime in the 21st century.”\n\nThe original “Cape Fear” was released in 1962, was based on the 1957 novel “The Executioners” and starred Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum. It followed attorney Sam Bowden, played by Peck, whose family is stalked by rapist Max Cady, played by Mitchum, whom he helped send to jail. The cast included Polly Bergen as Peggy Bowden, Lori Martin as Nancy Bowden, Martin Balsam, Jack Krushen, Telly Savalas and Barrie Chase.\n\nIn 1991, Scorsese remade “Cape Fear” with Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Joe Don Baker and Juliette Lewis. Mitchum and Peck, in his final theatrical film role before his death, both appeared in the movie. De Niro starred as Cady and Nolte was Sam Bowden. The movie earned Oscar nominations for De Niro and Lewis.\n\nDeadline first reported the news."
