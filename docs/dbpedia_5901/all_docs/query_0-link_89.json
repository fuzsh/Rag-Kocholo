        "text": "American author John D. MacDonald’s 1957 novel “The Executioners” is one of the most hard-hitting psychological thrillers of its time. It inspired two cinematic adaptations, both titled Cape Fear. J. Lee Thompson helmed the 1962 version, which stars Gregory Peck, Robert Mitchum, and Polly Bergen. Martin Scorsese directed the 1991 remake starring Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, and Jessica Lange. Now, there is a TV adaptation of Scorsese’s film in the works. If you are wondering when the Cape Fear TV Series is coming out, this is what we have learned.\n\nHere’s all the Cape Fear TV Series release date information we know so far, and all the details on when it is coming out.\n\nThe Cape Fear TV Series could arrive by 2025 at the earliest.\n\nIn November 2023, several outlets reported that a Cape Fear television series was in development at Universal Content Productions or UCP. Operating under the Universal Studio Group division of NBCUniversal, UCP has developed projects such as Queer as Folk (2022) and Based on a True Story (2023). Martin Scorsese is executive producing the series along with Steven Spielberg. Nick Antosca (Brand New Cherry Flavor) will serve as creator and showrunner.\n\nAccording to the reports, there was a bidding war to determine the home network/streamer for the series. Universal’s in-house streaming platform, Peacock, was a major candidate, though services such as Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Hulu, and HBO were also reportedly in the running. According to a recent report by Variety, the series has ended up at Apple TV Plus.\n\nScorsese and Spielberg are not only two of the greatest filmmakers of all time, they are also close friends. Spielberg’s Amblin Entertainment produced the 1991 film, and Amblin Television is attached to the upcoming series as well. If filming begins and wraps within this year, the Cape Fear TV Series can come out in 2025 at the earliest.\n\nThis date is an estimation based on the information we have at the time of this writing.\n\nNo information is available on the cast of the Cape Fear TV Series. ComingSoon will provide an update when there is more news on the project."
