        "text": "It was only a few years ago that Juliette Lewis was playing \"airhead teeny-boppers,\" as she puts it. Ms. Lewis was so frustrated by her sitcom roles that she ended each day in tears. \"I wanted to do more,\" says the 18-year-old actress.\n\nNow critics are praising her luminous performance as the teen-age Danielle Bowden in Martin Scorsese's new film, \"Cape Fear.\" In his review, Vincent Canby of The Times called Ms. Lewis \"a new young actress of stunning possibilities.\"\n\nNonetheless, it was Ms. Lewis's work in television that led to her breakthrough role. After playing the daughter on NBC's \"I Married Dora,\" which ran for 13 weeks in 1987, and making two guest appearances as Wayne's gum-cracking girlfriend, Dolores, on \"The Wonder Years,\" she landed a dramatic role in a made-for-TV movie, \"Too Young to Die,\" which was broadcast in February on NBC. In it she portrayed a teen-ager who is picked up in a bar by an Army sergeant (Michael O'Keefe) and, after being rejected, stabs him to death.\n\n\"When she came to read for the part,\" says Robert Markowitz, the director, \"we had seen about 35 girls and nobody was right. Within five minutes of Juliette's reading, we knew we had her. She has an enormous range. A lot of actors have vanity and won't allow themselves to go beyond a certain point where they're worried they won't look good. Juliette has no vanity.\"\n\nMs. Lewis's performance in \"Too Young to Die\" brought her to the attention of Mr. Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who plays Max Cady, the psychopathic ex-con who terrorizes Danielle's family in the remake of the 1962 suspense melodrama.\n\nIn the remake, Danielle is unhappy and confused by the bitterness between her parents, Sam and Leigh Bowden (Nick Nolte and Jessica Lange). When they fight, she hides in her room, watching MTV and whispering to her best friend on her pink telephone. Her self-conscious mannerisms -- toying with her long brown hair and running her tongue over the retainer on her teeth -- come across as flirtatious, but she seems only dimly aware that she is provocative.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
