        "text": "It’s time for a new episode of our WTF Happened to This Horror Movie? video series, and this time we’re looking back at director Martin Scorsese‘s 1991 version of Cape Fear (watch it HERE). To find out what went into the making of Scorsese’s take on the concept, check out the video embedded above!\n\nScorsese directed Cape Fear from a screenplay by Wesley Strick. The film was based on the novel The Executioners by John D. MacDonald, which had previously received a film adaptation (also titled Cape Fear) in 1962. Scorsese’s Cape Fear has the following synopsis:\n\nWhen attorney Sam Bowden knowingly withholds evidence that would acquit violent sex offender Max Cady of rape charges, Max spends 14 years in prison. But after Max’s release, knowing about Sam’s deceit, he devotes his life to stalking and destroying the Bowden family. When practical attempts to stop Max fail, Sam realizes that he must act outside the law to protect his wife and daughter.\n\nThe film stars Robert De Niro, Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange, Joe Don Baker, Juliette Lewis, Robert Mitchum, Gregory Peck, and Martin Balsam. Mitchum, Peck, and Balsam also starred in the ’62 film.\n\nThis is what the WTF Happened to This Horror Movie series is all about: Hollywood has had its fair share of historically troubled productions. Whether it was casting changes, actor deaths, fired directors, in-production rewrites, constant delays, budget cuts or studio edits, these films had every intention to be a blockbuster, but were beset with unforeseen disasters. Sometimes huge hits, sometimes box office bombs. Either way, we have to ask: WTF Happened To This Horror Movie?\n\nThe Cape Fear (1991) episode of WTF Happened to This Horror Movie? was Written by Eric Walkuski, Edited and Narrated by Tyler Nichols, Produced by Lance Vlcek and John Fallon, and Executive Produced by Berge Garabedian.\n\nA couple of the previous episodes of the show can be seen below. To see more, head over to our JoBlo Horror Originals YouTube channel – and subscribe while you’re there!\n\nWhat do you think of Scorsese’s Cape Fear? Let us know by leaving a comment!"
