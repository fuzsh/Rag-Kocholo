        "text": "As an actor who conveyed moral certitude and unwavering strength, Gregory Peck became the unofficial conscience of postwar Hollywood, turning in several iconic performances in some of cinema's most important films. Peck began appearing in movies during the war with \"Days of Glory\" (1944) and became an almost instant star thanks to his Oscar-nominated performance in \"The Keys of the Kingdom\" (1945). He went on to portray an amnesiac psychoanalyst in Alfred Hitchcock's \"Spellbound\" (1945), turned in another Academy Award-worthy performance in 'The Yearling\" (1946) and played against type in \"Duel in the Sun\" (1946). Following seminal work in \"Twelve O'Clock High\" (1949), \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) and \"Moby Dick\" (1956), Peck took on the role that became inextricably tied to his career, that of Atticus Finch in \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" (1962), which earned him his only Oscar for Best Actor while inspiring audiences for generations. He had a major box office hit with \"The Guns of Navarone\" (1961), starred in the original \"Cape Fear\" (1962) and reunited with \"Mockingbird\" director Robert Mulligan for \"The Stalking Moon\" (1969). His career began to slow in the 1970s, though he was notable in \"The Omen\" (1976) and \"The Boys of Brazil\" (1978). Following a turn as Abraham Lincoln in \"The Blue and the Grey\" (CBS, 1982) and his Emmy-nominated performance in a contemporary remake of \"Moby Dick\" (USA, 1998), Peck left behind a legacy as an iconic performer who exerted creative independence while becoming a beloved actor to generations fans."
