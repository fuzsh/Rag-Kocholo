        "text": "For the record, CAPE FEAR (1962) is a black-and-white thriller directed by J. Lee Thompson and based on a novel by John D. MacDonald. It stars Robert Mitchum as Max Cady, a newly released southern ex-con who’d served a prison sentence for rape largely on the testimony of lawyer Sam Bowden, played by Gregory Peck. Cady blames Bowden for his troubles and after prison returns to Bowden’s southeast Georgia town and sets about stalking and terrorizing Bowden, his wife Peggy (Polly Bergen) and 14-year-old daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). He commits other crimes and wreaks havoc, all while carefully eluding any serious charges. Bowden’s attempts to counter him invariably backfire. Eventually, it comes down to a violent, murderous confrontation between the two men in the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. The movie was later remade, but that’s part of the punchline, so stick with this.\n\nIt’s a movie I enjoy a great deal, appreciating especially Mitchum’s menacing performance and creation of a formidable human monster, making this a true horror film, all underscored by Bernard Herrmann’s pulsating music, his first thriller score since Alfred Hitchcock’s PSYCHO (1960).\n\nI had a moment of delirium recently where I wondered what CAPE FEAR would look like if it had been made as a comedy with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis ten years earlier during the height of the comic duo’s Hollywood success. What if Lewis played an aspiring stand-up comic who stalks and pesters Dean Martin’s character, who’s either a manager, promoter, or booking agent who’d rejected Lewis’s act years earlier. Lewis is constantly showing up at Dean’s office or home or stopping him on the street to try new bits on him. (“Hey lay-deeeeee!”) Then I remembered that they’d done a film with some echo of this plot released in 1953, THE STOOGE, in which Dean pumps up his act by hiring Jerry as a “stooge” who’s constantly interrupting him from the audience. There’s even a direct connection to CAPE FEAR in actress Polly Bergen who plays Dean’s wife in THE STOOGE and Gregory Peck’s wife in CAPE FEAR. Bergen also appeared as Dean’s girlfriend in two other Martin & Lewis films, AT WAR WITH THE ARMY (1950) and THAT’S MY BOY (1951). (THE STOOGE is well remembered because it was the one Martin and Lewis film during their ten-year reign of popularity that captured even a hint of what their nightclub act looked like. It was directed by Norman Taurog who made several Martin & Lewis films as well as many later solo Jerry Lewis vehicles and a few Elvis movies as well.)\n\nAdmit it, Lewis does exude a slight hint of Cady-like menace in some of these shots.\n\nThen I remembered a film made 30 years later that combines elements of THE STOOGE and CAPE FEAR: Martin Scorsese’s THE KING OF COMEDY (1983), in which Robert De Niro plays an aspiring stand-up comic named Rupert Pupkin, who stalks a famous talk show host named Jerry Langford and ultimately kidnaps him, all in a bid to get a gig on his show. Langford is played by none other than…Jerry Lewis! There are elements of Max Cady in Pupkin and the threat he poses to Langford and elements of Sam Bowden in Langford’s ineffectual response to the threat.\n\nMy ending for the Martin & Lewis version of CAPE FEAR would be very similar to that of THE KING OF COMEDY. (Although I’m not sure which is more horrifying.)\n\nFinally, it all comes full circle when Martin Scorsese himself remakes CAPE FEAR in 1991 and stars De Niro as Max Cady, with Nick Nolte, Jessica Lange and Juliette Lewis as the Bowden family. Also along for the ride are the original stars of CAPE FEAR, Robert Mitchum, playing a local lawman, and Gregory Peck playing Cady’s sly lawyer who gets the better of Bowden. (Quite a reversal for both actors.) How great would it have been if Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had played the roles that Mitchum and Peck played here? Highly improbable in 1991 but not entirely impossible.\n\nIt doesn’t end there. Later on, in the early 21st century, Scorsese bought the movie rights to a biography of Dean Martin entitled, Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams by Nick Tosches. Tom Hanks, who’d once played a stand-up comic in the movie PUNCHLINE (1988), was set to star. Alas, the movie was never made, not that I’m sure I’d have ever bought Hanks in the role.\n\nFinally, while Mitchum is great in CAPE FEAR (1962) and I wouldn’t think of recasting the part for a moment, I am intrigued by the idea of Dean Martin playing that role in 1962. He did play a few effective villains in westerns, e.g. ROUGH NIGHT IN JERICHO (1967), and could have pulled it off–if he’d wanted to.\n\nBut no, I never once considered Martin and Lewis making an actual straight version of MacDonald’s original novel, The Executioners, which wasn’t even published until 1957, a year after Martin & Lewis broke up. It would have to be a comedy.\n\nSo let’s review the casting connections between THE STOOGE (1953), CAPE FEAR (1962), THE KING OF COMEDY (1983), and CAPE FEAR (1991): Polly Bergen is in the first two films, Jerry Lewis is in the first and third films, Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck (as well as supporting actor Martin Balsam) are in the second and fourth films, Robert De Niro is in the third and fourth films, and Martin Scorsese directed the third and fourth films.\n\nI know this is all a bit of a stretch, but it was fun doing. Granted, I did not re-watch any of the four films cited for this piece. I haven’t seen either of them in years. If I did, I might have found further connections or, more likely, realized how silly the whole notion is and quickly given up on it. To anyone who’s read this far, only you can decide.\n\nNext up: IT’S A WONDERFUL LIFE meets PSYCHO! 😀"
