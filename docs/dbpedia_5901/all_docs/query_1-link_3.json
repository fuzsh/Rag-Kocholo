        "text": "Gregory Peck (1916–2003)[1] was an American actor who had an extensive career in film, television, radio, and on stage. Peck's breakthrough role was as a Catholic priest who attempts to start a mission in China in the 1944 film The Keys of the Kingdom, for which he received his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.[3] In the same year, he played Count Vronsky in a radio adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina. He followed this by starring in Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller Spellbound (1945) with Ingrid Bergman. In the late 1940s, Peck received three more nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his roles as a caring father in The Yearling (1946), a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to write an exposé on American antisemitism in Gentleman's Agreement (1947), and a brave airman in Twelve O'Clock High (1949).[4][5][6]\n\nPeck co-founded the theatre company La Jolla Playhouse in 1947 with Dorothy McGuire and Mel Ferrer. He starred in productions of Angel Street and The Male Animal for the company.[7] In 1951, he played Royal Navy officer Horatio Hornblower in the eponymous film, David in the biblical epic David and Bathsheba with Susan Hayward, and a soldier in the western Only the Valiant with Barbara Payton. Two years later, Peck appeared as a journalist who falls in love with a princess in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953) with Audrey Hepburn. During the late 1950s, he portrayed Captain Ahab in Moby Dick (1956), war hero Joseph G. Clemons in Pork Chop Hill (1959), and writer F. Scott Fitzgerald in Beloved Infidel (1959).\n\nHe won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer attempting to exonerate a black man wrongly accused of rape in courtroom drama To Kill a Mockingbird (1962).[8] The role topped the AFI's 50 Greatest Screen Heroes.[9] Seven years later, he appeared in the title role of the western Mackenna's Gold, and as a spy in The Chairman. In the late 1970s, Peck played General Douglas MacArthur in the eponymous 1977 film and Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in The Boys from Brazil (1978).\n\nPeck made his television debut in 1982 by appearing as President Abraham Lincoln in the miniseries The Blue and the Gray.[7] He followed this with the television film The Scarlet and the Black where he portrayed Catholic priest Hugh O'Flaherty who helped Jews and prisoners of war to hide in World War II-era Rome.[10] For his appearance as Father Mapple in the 1998 miniseries Moby Dick, he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a nomination for a Primetime Emmy.[11][12]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role(s) Notes Ref(s) 1944 Days of Glory Vladimir [13] 1944 Best Actor Oscar nomination [14] 1945 [15] 1945 Spellbound / John Ballantyne Best Picture Oscar nomination 1946 Best Picture Oscar nomination\n\nBest Actor Oscar nomination\n\n[17][18] 1946 Duel in the Sun [19] 1947 [20] 1947 Gentleman's Agreement Best Picture Oscar award\n\nBest Actor Oscar nomination\n\n[17][21] 1947 [22] 1948 Yellow Sky [23] 1949 Fedya [24] 1949 Twelve O'Clock High Best Picture Oscar nomination\n\nBest Actor Oscar nomination\n\n[25] 1950 [26] 1951 Captain Horatio Hornblower Captain Horatio Hornblower 1951 Only the Valiant [17] 1951 David and Bathsheba David [28] 1951 Pictura: An Adventure in Art Narrator Documentary; anthology film, segment: \"Legend of Saint Ursula\" [17][29] 1952 [17] 1952 1953 Roman Holiday Best Picture Oscar nomination\n\nBest Actress Oscar award\n\n[30] 1953 Boum sur Paris Himself French film 1954 1954 Night People 1954 [33] 1956 [17] 1956 Moby Dick [34] 1957 Designing Woman [17] 1958 Narrator Documentary [35] 1958 [17] 1958 Also producer 1959 Pork Chop Hill Lieutenant Joe Clemons Also executive producer 1959 Beloved Infidel 1959 On the Beach [37] 1961 Best Picture Oscar nomination 1962 Cape Fear Also executive producer [39] 1962 How the West Was Won Best Picture Oscar nominatiopn [40] 1962 To Kill a Mockingbird Also executive producer\n\nBest Picture Oscar nomination Best Actor Oscar award\n\n[41] 1963 Captain Newman, M.D. Also executive producer [17] 1964 Behold a Pale Horse Also executive producer [17] 1964 John F.
