        "text": "Buying and Selling: The Movies of 1991\n\nWelcome to the second installment of my year-by-year look at the movies of the 90’s. I last discussed the movies of 1990 here, and was left feeling a bit underwhelmed. Will the movies of 1991 whelm me? Keep reading to find out!\n\nThe Facts\n\nWhen taking a comprehensive view of the films of 1991, two films stand above the pack. The Silence of the Lambs became just the third movie ever to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards (Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), and was the first horror film to win the Oscar for Best Picture. Terminator 2: Judgment Day was the big winner at the box office (and also won four Oscars), taking in a cool $519.8 million worldwide, $130 million more than runner up Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. Although these two stand out, there are many more noteworthy films to discuss from 1991. Let’s get into it.\n\nBuying – Lesser Scorsese\n\nI feel compelled to start with what I consider to be the most underrated movie of 1991, Cape Fear. Scorsese’s remake of the 1962 film (which starred Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck) isn’t among my favorite Scorsese movies (in fact, it’s near the bottom), but that speaks to the director’s ridiculously high quality output. Cape Fear is a great movie nevertheless, featuring Robert De Niro as sleazy supercreep ex-con Max Cady, Nick Nolte as the public defender who failed him, and Juliette Lewis as Nolte’s teenage daughter Danielle (and Cady’s, uh, love interest?). I won’t say much more about this movie, as I may revisit it down the road in its own Buying and Selling, other than that, in a year featuring one of the most infamous cinematic villains of all time, De Niro’s Cady also deserves to be remembered for inducing high levels of terror. A Supplemental Buy for introducing Juliette Lewis to the world.\n\nBuying – Movies: With a Colon\n\nCheck ‘em out (colon):\n\nTerminator 2: Judgment Day\n\nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves\n\nStar Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country\n\nAn American Tail: Fievel Goes West\n\nMadonna: Truth or Dare\n\nThe Naked Gun 2 ½: The Smell of Fear\n\nAmerican Ninja 4: The Annihilation\n\nThe NeverEnding Story II: The Next Chapter\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze\n\nHighlander II: The Quickening\n\nThat’s a lot of colons! All this colon talk reminds me of this Phil Hartman classic. Also, I’m now at that point when you say, write, or type a word too many times and it loses all its meaning. coloncoloncolon colon colon. Colon.\n\nSelling – Hasta La Vista, Credibility\n\nLet me begin by saying that I didn’t watch Terminator 2 for the first time until 2014. Yes, that’s a little embarrassing, and no, I don’t have a great excuse for it. I can unequivocally say that if I had seen it as a 13 year old in 1991, in a theater, T2 would be filed under “Buy”, no questions asked. Unfortunately present day me wasn’t totally swept up in the blockbuster-ness of it. Great visual effects, and lots of action and explosions, but was I wrong to expect even a little nuance in the storytelling? Good, fun popcorn movie. The best part of T2, in my opinion, was Linda Hamilton. Freakin’ bad ass!\n\nBuying – What About Bob?\n\nMy second favorite movie from 1991, What About Bob? is among my favorite comedies of all time. Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss are so great together, and their performances elevate this movie into all-time classic status. Read the long-form Buying and Selling here.\n\nBuying – The Silence of the Lambs\n\nAs I mentioned above, The Silence of the Lambs won Oscars in five major categories, indicating excellence in acting, direction, and story. It’s an all around great film.\n\nOf course, discussion of this movie begins and ends with Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins. As well it should. Dr. Lecter was named the number one villain of all time in American cinema by American Film Institute. Hopkins’ portrayal of Lecter is simply chilling; the combination of charisma and cold-bloodedness push the character from simply “bad” to pure evil. Jodie Foster (Best Actress/Clarice Starling) also gives a performance for the ages as the heroine. The scenes that these two great actors share are some of the best, most tense that I have ever seen.\n\nI love this movie, and consider it one of the best films of all time. In fact, I have this movie ranked 18th overall of all the movies I have seen, and 9th overall for the decade of the 90’s. (How great are the 90’s that The Silence of the Lambs is only 9th best of the decade?! Or conversely, tune in to future installments to see which movies I have mistakenly ranked too high!)\n\nLightning Round – Buying Edition\n\nBarton Fink: Buying, but not emphatically.\n\nBoyz ‘N the Hood: Very moving for this white boy from Wisconsin.\n\nThe Doors: Cool Oliver Stone movie, and Val Kilmer nailed Morrison. I liked it better in 1991 than today though.\n\nRush: For Jason Patric, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Eric Clapton’s score.\n\nThe Commitments: Thanks for exposing me to this one, Matt!\n\nPoint Break: Duh.\n\nLightning Round – Selling Edition\n\nRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves: Not JUST because of the Bryan Adams song.\n\nBackdraft: (ZZZZZZZZZ)\n\nFather of the Bride: Nope.\n\nDouble Impact: Double nope.\n\nConspicuous By Their Absence\n\nWant to see: Defending Your Life (Who’s seen this? Comment below) (Edit: I’ve now seen Defending Your Life – my thoughts here), The Double Life of Veronique, Hook, The Fisher King, Hearts of Darkness, Slacker.\n\nHaven’t seen it by now, so I’m probably fine: Beauty and the Beast, JFK, Sleeping with the Enemy.\n\nYou can’t believe I haven’t seen: Thelma and Louise, Fried Green Tomatoes, Jungle Fever, The Addams Family (though I saw Hammer’s video for “Addams Groove” on MTV a million times back in the day).\n\nConclusion\n\nSo 1991 turned out to be overall a better year for film than 1990. There were many more enjoyable films, including two that I consider “classics” in The Silence of the Lambs and What About Bob?, a bona fide blockbuster in Terminator 2, an animated film good enough to be nominated for Best Picture (Beauty and the Beast), offerings from esteemed directors like Oliver Stone, Spielberg, Coen, Kieslowski, and Scorsese, and Point Break. Top to bottom, I’d say 1991 was a good year for movies."
