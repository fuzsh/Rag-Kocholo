        "text": "You could be forgiven for thinking you’ve seen Ethan Peck before. The handsome, dark-haired, 29-year-old actor and model is the spitting image of his late grandfather, iconic actor Gregory Peck.\n\nEthan has regularly appeared in movies (“In Time,” “Eden”) and TV shows (“10 Things I Hate About You”) since he was a kid. But viewers will soon be seeing a lot more of him: He’s been cast in producer Lee Daniels’ (of “Empire” fame) next Fox show. The project is untitled, but it will star Queen Latifah as the owner of an Atlanta beauty salon. Peck spoke with The Post from his Los Angeles home about the role.\n\n“I would describe [my character] as a seductive villain,” he says. “He’s really dangerous because you end up liking him.”\n\nSexy villain is different from the type of roles his grandfather was known for — characters that oozed gravitas and dignity, best personified by attorney Atticus Finch in “To Kill a Mockingbird.” “I recently watched ‘Roman Holiday’ for the first time,” Peck says. “My dad once showed me ‘The Guns of Navarone’ when I was a kid. I haven’t rewatched it since, but it gave me such a warm feeling.”\n\nGrowing up, there were some familial dynamics that prevented too much closeness between Peck and his grandfather. He’s still wrapping his head around his ancestor’s legacy. “I’m doing what he did, and we share the name. But it feels like my own. I knew him at the end of his life, and he was Grandpa — and also an icon. It’s still hard for me to fathom the level at which he was appreciated on an international scale.”\n\nAlthough Peck’s attire usually involves jeans and black ­T-shirts, he can, like his grandfather, certainly rock a suit: He recently appeared in the short film “Coming Home to Hollywood,” celebrating 100 years of the Salvatore Ferragamo fashion brand. Peck was allowed to keep the suit he wore in the film. Perhaps he’ll pair it with his patterned aqua and gold Dior tie — the one item of clothing he has from his dapper grandfather, who died at 87 in 2003.\n\nPeck — who declines to say whether he’s in a relationship — grew up in Hollywood, the son of divorced parents Francine Matarazzo, an artist, and Stephen Peck, an actor and CEO of the nonprofit organization US Vets. He describes his childhood as mostly normal, allowing that, “Every once in a while I’d go to a party and Roger Moore would be there.”\n\n“I feel very lucky,” he says. “The older I get, the more I see how random everything is, the luckier I feel to have been born into this context, the more responsible I feel to be the best that I can be as a person and as a professional. That was a quality … of the men on my father’s side of the family.”"
