        "text": "\"I have seen him do this once before, and I can assure you that he is as insightful, charming, quick-witted and gracious a raconteur as ever.\"\n\nThat's Michael Maso, managing director of Boston's Huntington Theatre Company, talking about Gregory Peck, the legendary film actor. Peck will come to the theatre March 2 for a special presentation, opening with a video montage of highlights from his career, followed by Peck telling stories about Hollywood, family and colleagues, and taking questions from the audience.\n\nThe one-night-only performance of \"An Evening With American Film Legend, Gregory Peck,\" begins at 8:15 PM at the Boston University Theatre on Huntington Ave. Tickets are $50-$75.\n\nBorn in 1916, Peck served as a barker at the NY World's Fair and tour guide at Radio City Music Hall. He then won a scholarship to Neighborhood Playhouse and appeared on Broadway in 1942's Morning Star. He also appeared in Sons And Soldiers with Geraldien Fitzgerald. His first film (1944) was Days Of Glory, followed by Duel In The Sun, Moby Dick, The Guns Of Navarone, Cape Fear and his Oscar-winning portrayal of Atticus Finch in To Kill A Mockingbird.\n\nPeck received the 1969 Medal Of Freedom, 1991 Kennedy Center Honors, 1992 Lincoln Center Lifetime Achievement Award, and France's 1995 Legion d'Honneur. He can also be heard as the voice of Florenz Ziegfeld on the cast album of the 1991 Broadway musical The Will Rogers Follies.\n\nAudience members who wish to support Huntington's Department of Education and Outreach can attend a special gala with cocktails and dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel for $300. Add to that a special VIP reception at the Four Seasons, with a chance to meet and greet Peck, and the cost is $1,500.\n\nFor information on the Peck presentation and gala call (617) 266-0800."
