        "text": "Gregory Peck, whose chiseled, slightly melancholy good looks, resonant baritone and quiet strength made him an unforgettable presence in films like \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" \"Gentleman's Agreement\" and \"Twelve O'Clock High,\" died late Wednesday or early Thursday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 87.\n\nIn a career that spanned half a century, Mr. Peck often played a morally anguished hero who displayed grace under fire. In his most memorable role, as Atticus Finch in the 1962 film \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" he won the Academy Award as best actor for his performance as a gentle Southern lawyer who incurs the wrath of his fellow townsfolk when he defends a black man accused of raping a white woman.\n\nHis persona in this and other movies as the embodiment of American decency made him a persuasive advocate for the many liberal candidates and causes he supported.\n\nOver the decades, Mr. Peck remained a popular movie hero who skillfully projected courage, wholesomeness and vulnerability in a wide range of films. His 46th performance, in the 1977 film \"MacArthur,\" was praised by Vincent Canby of The New York Times , who wrote that he \"not only looks and sounds like the general, he also makes the character disgracefully appealing, even when he is being his most outrageous.\"\n\nMr. Peck turned in some of his finest performances in the late 1940's. In Alfred Hitchcock's thriller \"Spellbound,\" he played an amnesiac with whom his psychiatrist, played by Ingrid Bergman, falls in love. In his portrayal of the father in \"The Yearling\" (1947), Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's tale of a young boy and his love for a deer, he displayed the warmth and parental understanding that would endear him to audiences in \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\"\n\nIn \"Duel in the Sun\" (1947) Mr. Peck took a holiday from decency, playing the murderous son of a cattle baron. Although Mr. Peck and his co-star, Jennifer Jones, provided some sizzling scenes that had to be cut when moral watchdog groups objected, the film, a lavish Technicolor Western produced by David O. Selznick, failed at the box office. Mr. Peck returned to form as a journalist battling anti-Semitism in \"Gentleman's Agreement\" (1947) and as an anguished bomber commander in \"Twelve O'Clock High\" (1949).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
