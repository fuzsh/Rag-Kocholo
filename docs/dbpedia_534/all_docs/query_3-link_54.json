        "text": "Once upon a time, I was the city girl who believed the best life you can have only the big metropolitans and megacities; therefore, I lived in Zurich, Stockholm, Los Angeles, Durban, New York, and Washington, DC. I believed the best opportunities, vibrant social life, zero boredom can be riched only in the city. I couldn’t go to the countryside ever, not even for a weekend because I will scream from inside of me:\n\n“This is boring!”\n\nBut fast forward to our kind of post-covid life (who knows if it is post-covid…) My husband and I decided to move to the village for the sake of our daughter. During the lockdown in 2020, Spain prohibited children from going outside for 6 weeks. The poor child started living her life on the roofs of Albaicin, in Granada. We did not know how long the pandemic would last, so we gave it a shot and moved to the village. I knew she would have more freedom there even if the lockdown happens again.\n\nAnd I am glad we did."
