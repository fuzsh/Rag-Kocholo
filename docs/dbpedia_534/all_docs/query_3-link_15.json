        "text": "I always thought it was just a matter of opinion and usage but I was interested enough to google the question and apparently there is a semi-official heirarchy of places in the UK used by Landscape Historians and Planning Authorites as follows .........\n\nMegalopolis - a group of conurbations, consisting of more than ten million people in total.\n\nConurbation - a group of metropolis, consisting of three to ten million people.\n\nMetropolis - a large city and its suburbs consisting of multiple cities and towns. The population is usually one to three million.\n\nLarge city - a city with a large population and many services. The population is less than 1 million but over 300,000.\n\nMedium city - a city would have abundant services, but not as many as a large city. The population of a city is between 100,000 and 300,000 people\n\nSmall City or \"Borough\"- a city that functions as a type of municipality or subdivision of a consolidated city.\n\nSuburb - a mixed-use town or residential area, existing either as part of a city or urban area or as a separate residential community within commuting distance of a city.\n\nLarge town - a large town has a population of 10,000 to 100,000.\n\nTown - a town has a population of 1,000 to 10,000.\n\nVillage - a village is a human settlement or community that is larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town. The population of a village varies; the average population can range in the hundreds.\n\nHamlet - a hamlet has a tiny population (less than 100), with only a few buildings.\n\nHomestead or Isolated dwelling - a cluster of isolated dwellings normally occupied by a single extended family, normally would only have 1 to 5 buildings or families."
