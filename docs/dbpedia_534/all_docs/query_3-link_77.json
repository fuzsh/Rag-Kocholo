        "text": "Not to be confused with Village & Pillage.\n\nThis article is about the generated structure. For the mobs that inhabit villages, see Villager. For the upcoming novel, see Minecraft: The Village.\n\nA village is a group or complex of buildings and other structures that generate naturally in the Overworld. A village is inhabited by villagers, as people, cats, as pets, iron golems, for defense, passive livestock mobs, for farms, occasional zombie villagers, and wandering traders with their trader llamas. A village is a source of resources to the player, obtained from trading, loot chests, and other materials found in the village. Villages are also a target of raid attacks by illagers when a player walks into a village with the Bad Omen effect.\n\nGeneration[]\n\nVillages generate naturally in plains, savanna, taiga, meadows, snowy plains, and desert biomes. In Bedrock Edition, they also generate in snowy taiga and sunflower plains biomes. The type of the village, and therefore the style of all structures within it, is determined by the biome at the village center or meeting point. The buildings and wood depend on the biome the village is in. If the meeting point does not generate in one of the above biomes, the village defaults to plains style.\n\nThe following table shows the village styles corresponding to different biomes.\n\nVillage style Biome Desert Desert Plains Plains\n\nSunflower plains‌[BE only]\n\nMeadow\n\nAny other not listed here[note 1] Savanna Savanna Snowy Snowy plains Taiga Taiga\n\nSnowy taiga‌[BE only]\n\nThe number of villagers spawned depends on the number of beds in the village. Villagers spawn only in houses that have beds, while job site buildings (with no beds) always generate without villagers.\n\nIf a building or pathway generates over open-air, circular or square platforms of grass or sand (depending on the terrain) generates below the structure, which can cause surface oddities. These platforms do not generate beside cliffs or over the void; rather, they generate on the lowest blocks. Platforms can be clearly seen when a village building generates over an ocean. Farms generate a few blocks of open space above them if they happen to generate inside a hill. Village buildings can also generate suddenly on the top of a windswept hills while the other buildings are at the bottom of the windswept hills. This happens often in savanna villages.\n\nSome villages generate as abandoned; see § Abandoned villages below.\n\nVillages are slightly more common in Bedrock Edition than in Java Edition. There is a roughly 1⁄2 chance that at least one village is present within 500 blocks of the world spawn point in Java Edition, while this chance is about 2⁄3 in Bedrock Edition. This is due to the fact that villages can generate in more biomes in Bedrock Edition, as well as being closer to each other within an eligible biome.\n\nDespite the existence of jungle and swamp villagers, there are no swamp or jungle villages in the game.\n\nUpon generation\n\nVillager Iron Golem Zombie Villager Horse Pig Cow Sheep Camel\n\nVillagers spawn in regular villages only.\n\nIron golems spawn in regular villages only, one spawns near a village meeting point.\n\nZombie villagers spawn in abandoned villages only.\n\nHorses, pigs, cows, and sheep spawn in regular villages and abandoned villages.\n\nCamels spawn in regular desert villages and abandoned desert villages.[verify]\n\nPeriodically\n\nCat Wandering Trader Trader Llama Iron Golem\n\nCats spawn naturally inside villages, one for every four beds for a maximum of five.\n\nOne wandering trader spawns periodically at a village meeting point.\n\nTwo trader llamas spawn periodically at a village meeting point alongside a wandering trader.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, iron golems spawn periodically around the village center if there are at least 10 villagers and 20 beds in a village, for a maximum of two. In Java Edition, they are summoned by a Villager if the villager spawning them has slept.\n\nDuring events\n\nZombie\n\n‌[JE only] Chicken Jockey\n\n‌[JE only] Pillager Vindicator Evoker Vex Ravager Witch\n\nZombies spawn during zombie sieges. Chicken jockeys spawn rarely during zombie sieges.\n\nPillagers, vindicators, evokers, vexes, ravagers, and witches spawn during raids.\n\nWitches also spawn when a villager is struck by lightning within four blocks of the bolt.\n\nEvents[]\n\nRaids[]\n\nMain article: Raid\n\nA player who kills an illager captain (found in an outpost or a patrol) receives the Bad Omen effect for 100 minutes. Like other status effects, Bad Omen can also be cleared by dying or drinking milk. Entering a village boundary while the effect is active triggers a raid, in which groups of illagers spawn and attack the village. Killing multiple captains in Java Edition gives the player a higher level of Bad Omen, and the higher the level, the higher the chance for the raiding mobs to wield enchanted weapons.\n\nZombie sieges[]\n\nMain article: Zombie siege\n\nZombie sieges are in-game events where many zombies spawn in a village, regardless of how well lit or walled off a village is. They have a 10% chance of occurring at midnight every night or during thunderstorms when a village has at least 20 valid beds. There is no indication of a zombie siege happening except for an unusually high number of zombies.\n\nStructure[]\n\nFor the technical details behind village structures, see Village/Structure. For the blueprints of village structures, see Village/Structure/Blueprints. For structures prior to Village & Pillage, see Village/Structure (old). For blueprints of structures prior to Village & Pillage, see Village/Structure (old)/Blueprints.\n\nBuildings[]\n\nThe number of buildings making up a village can vary, and not every village consists of all building types at once. Apart from the meeting point, which is unique and systematic, the number of buildings of each type is randomly generated and increased in superflat‌[Java Edition only] worlds. More than one meeting point can generate in superflat worlds. The number of lamp posts and decorative structures (hay bales, melon patch, pumpkin patch, farms, snow and ice patches) has no restriction, as they are generated where no other buildings can be placed. These structures could have functions, and could be of great use to the player. Paths are found between the buildings of the village and often extend beyond them.\n\nStructures are chosen randomly from a pool of possible buildings. No one building has a greater chance to appear than another.\n\nThe full list of the village house blueprints can be accessed by going here.\n\nArchitecture style, and blocks making up the village structures, vary according to village type. Not every building can generate in a single village, although some blocks can be found in any village, such as job site blocks and food items. Buildings have different probabilities of generating, depending on village type; for example, a weaponsmith shop is more likely to appear in a Taiga village than other villages.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, villages don't generate with expected structures; for example, a fletcher house doesn't appear in a plains village and a stone mason house doesn't appear in a savanna village.[1]\n\nPaths[]\n\nVillages generate paths between the buildings and extending outside of the village. Village paths generate at the level of existing terrain, potentially going up steep hills or down ravines without regard for whether an entity could actually traverse the path. Paths do not go below sea level and replace only grass blocks (with air above), water, lava, sand, sandstone, and red sandstone; all other blocks are ignored and the blocks underneath are considered for replacement instead. Villagers use these paths to travel across the village.\n\nIn plains, savanna, taiga, and snowy villages, paths are comprised of dirt paths and grass. Savanna villages also generate farmland and crops in some paths. Dirt paths that generate over water are replaced by the village style's planks type. Desert villages generate with smooth sandstone paths.\n\nIn Buffet worlds with cave generation, paths may generate on a separate layer from the rest of the buildings. In floating island generation, paths may not generate at all.\n\nTrees, lamp posts, and other decorative structures can generate in the middle of paths as obstructions.[2]\n\nAbandoned villages[]\n\nA village has a 2% chance of generating as an abandoned village (also known as zombie village).\n\nIn an abandoned village, all generated villagers are instead zombie villagers, and all doors and torches are missing. The zombie villagers do not despawn, but have no resistance to sunlight. The zombie villagers spawned inside these villages behave similar to drowned as they stay in the shade even when a player or villager are nearby, only coming out when the sun has set. In abandoned villages, most cobblestone blocks are replaced by mossy cobblestone, random blocks (particularly wood) are replaced by cobwebs, and all glass panes(besides those of the church) are replaced by brown stained glass panes to represent dirty glass. The job blocks, crops and interiors are mostly left intact. Abandoned villages also spawn stray cats, as well as the usual village livestock, but they do not spawn iron golems. The amount of buildings in an abandoned village can be slightly more than a normal village.\n\nMechanics[]\n\nMain article: Village mechanics\n\nJava Edition[]\n\nA subchunk is a \"village center\" if it contains at least one claimed bed, bell, or job site block. The 26 subchunks in a 3×3×3 cube around such a subchunk are also considered part of a village.\n\nVillages as a whole have no defined \"center\", \"size\", or \"radius\", it's all based on proximity to any \"village center\" subchunk.\n\nBedrock Edition[]\n\nA village always consists of at least one acceptable bed and one villager. Rarely, a village structure can generate without beds, thus not qualifying as a village. Upon creation, a village center is defined as a bed claimed by the first villager (a village leader), or the gathering site block (a bell), and the village's size is the greater of 32 blocks or the distance to the furthest bed from the center. Any villager, village golem, siege-spawned zombie, or raid-spawned illagers can pathfind back into the village if they find themselves farther than that many blocks from the center.\n\nVillages are established by the number of valid beds in the village.\n\nThe maximum population of a village is the number of valid beds. If the population drops below that point (due to death or removal), but there are at least two villagers left who can reach each other, the villagers mate and breed until the population is at the maximum.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, a village is created when at least one villager links to one bed. The village continues to exist as long as one of its villagers remains linked to one of its beds. If all beds are unlinked (by being destroyed, by players sleeping in them, or by villagers failing to pathfind to them), then the village ceases to exist. When this happens the villagers lose all links to job site blocks and bells, and cannot use them.\n\nWhen the first villager links to a bed a village of size 65×25×65 blocks is created, centered on the pillow of that bed. The boundaries, and consequently the center (which is important because it defines where cats and iron golems can spawn), may change as other villagers link or unlink from point of interest (POI) blocks. When the boundaries change the center usually shifts to the location of POI block near the midpoint between the farthest out POI in each direction. In naturally generated villages there is usually a bell near the village center, but aside from that bells have no special role distinct from other POI in how the game defines and manages the village center and boundaries.\n\nGathering site[]\n\nVillages have gathering sites where villagers may mingle. A gathering site is defined as a bell located within the village boundary. A wandering trader may spawn at a gathering site, accompanied by trader llamas. A villager will also ring the bell when a raid starts.\n\nJob site blocks[]\n\nJob site blocks are blocks such as grindstones, smithing tables, and lecterns, which are used by villagers. Villagers with the corresponding professions spend their time in front of their job site block, except for nitwits, baby villagers and unemployed villagers (villagers without profession overlays). Upon claiming a job site block, green particles appear above both the villager and the job site block, and the villager takes up the profession of the job site block if unemployed. Villagers that have already been traded with can claim only job site blocks related to their profession. Employed villagers that are not linked to a job site block are unable to restock their trades. Villagers cannot link to a job site block that has already been claimed by another villager. There are thirteen job site blocks in the game, each linking to their respective villager profession.\n\nHistory[]\n\nFebruary 21, 2010NPC villages and \"monster towns\" are mentioned. July 1, 2011A picture of villages was released by Notch before Beta 1.8 was released. In the early screenshot, villages were partly made of moss stone. July 13, 2011An early interview with Notch discussed his plans for the village. August 10, 2011Notch originally worked on villages by himself, but eventually gave the task to Jeb, so that he could work on other things. August 11, 2011Jeb has said that during early tests of villages, the lava in a blacksmith often set the village on fire. August 26, 2011Villages were shown to the public during the PAX 2011 demo, including the interiors. Java Edition Beta 1.8Pre-releaseAdded villages, which only generated in plains and desert biomes. They were originally intended to be populated with pigmen.[3] Java Edition 1.0.0Beta 1.9 PrereleaseVillagers have been added to villages. They have 'TESTIFICATE' written above their heads. 1.112w01aAdded superflat, allowing bigger villages. Blacksmith buildings in villages now hold chests with loot. 1.2.112w07aVillagers now repopulate villages based on how many houses there are available. Zombie sieges can now occur once a village has reached a certain size.The player may now add houses to villages, provided they are enclosed with a roof and wooden door. 12w08aLarger villages now spawn iron golems to defend them. 1.3.112w21aDesert villages are now made of sandstone instead of wood and cobblestone. 1.4.212w32aVillages now track the \"popularity\" of individual players by username. 12w36aPotatoes and carrots can now be found in villages. 1.513w03aChanges to water-block generation now make wells proper infinite water sources. 13w06aThe lamppost glitch in villages has been fixed. 1.7.213w36aAdded the savanna biome, which villages can now generate in. 1.814w03aGravel roads in villages now have cobblestone underneath, to prevent them from collapsing into caves. 14w04aDoors are now added to the closest village. 14w25aZombie sieges have been re-implemented. 14w30aWells in desert villages are now made of sandstone instead of cobblestone. 1.915w31aFarms now include beetroot crops. 1.1016w20aVillage structures are no longer restricted by biome boundaries, meaning that a village that starts in a valid biome can now spread into an adjacent invalid biome. Villages now generate in taiga biomes (but not their variants), and are made of spruce wood.As a result of the above two reasons, the amount of villages that generate has been greatly increased.[4]Savanna villages are now made of acacia wood rather than oak. Acacia logs replace cobblestone in all structures except churches.Paths no longer generate below sea level, and they are made with different material depending on the existing terrain.Grass paths now generate rather than gravel paths, when generated on grass blocks.Paths made of planks now generate over water and lava to form bridges.Villages now have a 2% chance of generating as an abandoned village, which are inhabited only by zombie villagers, and generate without any doors or torches. 16w21aBlacksmiths now generate with cobblestone in all biomes, rather than acacia logs in savannas and sandstone in deserts. pre1Zombie villagers generated in zombie villages no longer despawn. Wooden fences are now substituted with the correct wood type for the biome.Paths no longer replace most blocks, instead considering the blocks underneath, preventing them from generating in treetops or bridging ravines. 1.1418w47aAdded raids, in which groups of illagers attack villages after a player kills an illager patrol leader then enters a village.

New Nintendo 3DS Edition 0.1.0Added villages.\n\nIssues[]\n\nIssues relating to \"Village\" are maintained on the bug tracker. Report issues there.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAccording to Jeb, originally they wanted a system for a village to expand in population if the player improves it. But they found that it was computationally expensive to evaluate what constituted a house, so to make it simple, they decided that a door with an inside and outside counts as a house; however, the house was later changed to beds.[5]\n\nPrior to Village and Pillage, the farms in villages would avoid overhanging by filling in the area below them with dirt when they spawned. When a farm overhangs a ravine, a tall rectangular dirt structure generates underneath. Buildings would fill the area below them with cobblestone, often resulting in the same behavior.\n\nOccasionally, surface ravines generate through villages, causing missing pathways or even entire buildings sunken into the ravine. This also applies to cave entrances and other surface oddities.\n\nIn rare cases, players can find a tiny village consisting of one house, or even just one job site-building (a building with job site blocks) without any houses (building with beds), causing the village to not spawn any villagers.\n\nThe plains village is the only type of village with much of its architecture resembling its old counterpart prior to Village & Pillage.\n\nIn Java Edition, village paths generated as dirt paths only on grass blocks and used gravel in other cases. This is no longer the case due to a bug.[6]\n\nBecause of the relatively large amount of biomes, a village house designed for one a particular biome might be located on the border of two biomes.\n\nGallery[]\n\nA taiga house image tweeted by LadyAgnes.\n\nA taiga farm image tweeted by LadyAgnes.\n\nAnother image of a village tweeted by LadyAgnes.[7]\n\nA screenshot of part of the Java Edition 1.14 main menu panorama.\n\nAn igloo structure that generated in a snowy plains village.\n\nA snowy plains village.\n\nA plains village well.\n\nA village farm beside multiple houses.\n\nTwo taiga villages generated right next to each other.\n\nA plains village generated in the snowy plains.\n\nVillagers mingling about an iron golem.\n\nA desert village mixed with a jungle biome.\n\n2 villages close to each other on superflat world.\n\nVillage in plains biome.\n\nAbandoned village during the day.
