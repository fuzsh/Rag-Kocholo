        "text": "DESCRIPTION\n\ndifference between city and town\n\nSOURCE\n\ncity: IconicBestiary / iStock / Getty Images Plus , town: Art-Y / DigitalVision Vectors\n\nUnderstanding what makes a village, a city, or a town is more complex than simply stating population sizes. What makes a town or a city is different around the world, so there isn’t a universal definition. Explore definitions and the differences between a city and a town to settle the town vs. city debate.\n\nWhat Is a City?\n\nThe simple definition of city is, “a town of significant size or an urban area with self-government.” The word “city” comes from the French word cite, meaning “town, city.” The French term was taken from the Latin word civitatum, meaning “citizenship.”\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica defines a city as a “relatively permanent and highly organized centre of population, of greater size or importance than a town or village.”\n\nCharacteristics of a City\n\nWhile the size and look of cities varies around the world, there are a few things cities typically have in common.\n\nThey are more urban.\n\nThere is more nonagricultural activity than agricultural activity.\n\nElected officials often make policy decisions on behalf of their electors.\n\nExamples of Cities\n\nThe first cities in the world are believed to have evolved out of rural villages around 3500 B.C.\n\nExamples of modern cities include the biggest cities in the world such as:\n\nCairo\n\nDelhi\n\nNew York City\n\nRio de Janeiro\n\nTokyo\n\nWhat Is a Town?\n\nThe simple definition of town is, “a residential area that is smaller than a city and larger than a village.” The word “town” comes from the Old English word tun, meaning “enclosure, garden, field, yard; farm, manor; homestead, dwelling house, or mansion.” The Old English term comes from the Celtic word dunon, which meant “hill or hill-fort.”\n\nTowns existed before modern states and came about between the 15th and 17th centuries. Towns are said to be “mostly but not exclusively semirural communities,” and popular in the U.S. in the New England states, New York, Pennsylvania, and the north-central states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharacteristics of a Town\n\nTowns are not as easy to spot as cities because they are often intertwined with villages.\n\nThey are more rural.\n\nTown meetings, or meetings of the taxpayers, make policy decisions.\n\nTowns often grow around specialized economic activities, like mining.\n\nExamples of Towns\n\nExamples of towns are best found in your local area. These town examples all have official websites you can check out to learn more about towns.\n\nThe town of Chautauqua is located in Western New York, U.S.A.\n\nThe town of Creston is located in British Columbia, Canada.\n\nThe town of Parga is a maritime town in Greece.\n\nDifferences Between Cities and Towns\n\nIt is difficult to list differences between towns and cities because every state and country uses different definitions for the terms. If you generalize what’s common throughout the world, you can identify a few key differences.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Population of a City Is Generally Bigger\n\nFor government purposes, the U.S. Census Bureau defines a place as “either legally incorporated under the laws of its respective State, or a statistical equivalent that the Census Bureau treats as a census designated place (CDP)”.\n\nIn general, any place with more than 2,500 residents can be considered a city, and anything with fewer residents can be considered a town. For more details on the types of places where people live, explore the differences between rural, urban and suburban areas.\n\nCity Status Must Be Granted in Some Countries\n\nIn the U.K., for example, a city can only officially be called a city if the British government grants it city status.\n\nIn 2018, the House of Commons Library created a place classification system. They suggest six types of settlements with the following guidelines:\n\ncore city: has 12 major population and economic centers\n\nother city: population of more than 175,000\n\nlarge town: population between 60,000 and 174,999\n\nmedium town: population between 25,000 and 59,999\n\nsmall town: population between 7,500 and 24,999\n\nvillage or small community: population of less than 7,500\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCities Are Governed by Representatives\n\nIn towns, the taxpayers make many of the important decisions for the town by attending town meetings or participating in public voting. In cities, officials are elected by the people, then those officials make the important decisions.\n\nCity vs. Town vs. Village\n\nWhile village and town are often used interchangeably, they are slightly different. A village is defined as, “a residential area in the country that is smaller than a town.”\n\nWhere Do You Live?\n\nIf you think about the settlement you live in, you might be able to better see the differences between towns and cities.
