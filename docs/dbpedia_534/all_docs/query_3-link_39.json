        "text": "Theories about the origin of towns\n\nDifferent theories of urbanism have sought to explain the historical emergence of towns as a type of human settlement. Among the factors that have given rise to towns, according to these theories, are technological advances, increased literacy rates and education, industrialization, and economic development. A town is also defined by its fairly large settled population, which often consists of relatively small families (in comparison with traditional rural societies). The theory of hydraulic civilization developed by the historian Karl Wittfogel in the 1950s, for example, sought to establish a link between water management and political organization; though problematic in many ways, particularly his conceptualization of “Oriental” societies, his theory provides insight into how one thing essential for human existence—water—can contribute to the development of centralized social coordination that, in turn, encourages the development of towns and similar settlements. Cooperation, the division of labour, and more intensive use of agriculture are essential to the hydraulic society, according to Wittfogel, and thus create favourable conditions for towns. The geographer and historian Paul Wheatley argued that there is a link between a culture’s religious and cultural practices and the emergence of towns. Other theorists point to economics as the driving motor for towns, citing as just one example ancient Mesopotamia’s pursuit of trade so as to secure external resources, prompting population growth as well as increased labour specialization and other forms of social change.\n\nHistorical development of towns\n\nMore From Britannica\n\nUnited Kingdom: Towns\n\nThe earliest urban centres that can be considered a type of town developed in Mesopotamia about 3500 bce. They are exemplified by Ur. During the same period, significant population growth and increased population density occurred in settlements in Egypt. The Harappan civilization emerged in the Indus valley a millennium later, and it gave rise to Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, where the so-called gridiron plan was used and socio-spatial segregation was common. Later towns in Mesoamerica were home to a stratified society, with lower classes inhabiting the periphery and the elite the centre, as occurred in Mayapán and Tikal. In Greece the founding of Athens, Sparta, and Megara marked early urbanization in the Mediterranean region, which settlers spread to southern Italy, Ionia, and other areas, founding towns based on the gridiron plan. The arrival of the Romans in what were, in some cases, already established towns helped lay the foundations of several modern European cities as we know them today, including London, Paris, and Vienna.\n\nAfter the fall of the Roman Empire and what some argue was a period of cultural stagnation in European towns, urban settlements again began to flourish across medieval Europe. Among the most notable was Lübeck, in Germany, a driving force behind the Hanseatic League, which fostered trade between Hamburg, Lüneberg, Cologne, Riga, and Danzig (now Gdańsk in Poland). Largely dominated by their marketplaces, medieval European towns became home to people migrating from rural areas owing to economic forces. Notwithstanding the high mortality and poor hygiene common in these towns, their new inhabitants gained privileges that they were denied in rural contexts, thereby fueling rural flight.\n\nTowns also played a leading role in Britain during the Industrial Revolution, which began during the 18th century. The growth of places such as Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, and Glasgow was fueled by the quest for profit, specialization in labour, and technological development, which often made these towns into bustling, chaotic, wealthy cities. Dense multifamily housing dominated in these places, as a result of speculative builders maximizing land use while minimizing expenses. Residents suffered from poor health caused by a lack of ventilation, sunlight, and adequate sanitation—conditions that existed well into the 20th century (and, arguably, continue in some places today).\n\nThe term town has also been used to refer to a type of community, called a new town, that was first proposed by urban planners in Britain during the 1940s. These towns were intended to reduce population density in cities through the relocation of large groups of people to relatively autonomous communities that often featured homes, hospitals, industry, shopping, and cultural and recreational amenities near one another. Notable examples of places inspired by, or otherwise part of the tradition of, the new town concept include Milton Keynes, in England; Reston, Virginia, in the United States; Woodlands New Town, in Singapore; and Tin Shui Wai, in Hong Kong. Similarly, satellite towns have been introduced around major urban centres, such as Slough, near London, or Sobradinho, near Brasília.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The favelas of Brazil are examples of particularly well-known shantytowns. The term ghost town describes towns that have lost their populations and means of survival owing to economic upheavals, natural or human-caused disasters, or other factors. Craco in Italy and abandoned mining towns in the western United States are cases in point."
