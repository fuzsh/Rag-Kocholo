        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by ckhthankgod\n\nA city is like a city anywhere and in NY the smallest city is Sherrill, which has around 3000 people. A village is like a small city, but also gets some duplicate services like police coverage for example from the town it is in. A town is like a township in other states and tend to be bigger in land size. A hamlet is a small community within a town.\n\nThis is pretty much spot on. I would just add that you will see towns & villages with the same name. For instance I live in the town of Hamburg but there is also a village of Hamburg. This is where it can get confusing .......... the village is part of the town but not all of the town is part of the village. The best way to describe it is the village is typically the centralized, downtown area of the town while the town is the village area plus the outlying areas.\n\nIts really not that confusing once you live here for a bit but one thing to be on the lookout for is that many villages have higher taxes than if you lived outside the village but still within the town. The reason being is because if you reside in the village they hit you with taxes for the village and the town (outside of the village area you dont have to pay taxes to the village). Just something to be aware of if you were thinking of buying before living here for awhile.\n\nYes, if you think of the village as the original heart of the town and the rest grew up around it, that's the best way to describe the relationship between village and town.\n\nCity > Town > Village > Hamlet\n\nI live in a hamlet. It's really a small collection of houses that may or may not be slightly set apart from the \"village\" part of town. In my case, you drive through farm fields and forest for a couple of miles until you suddenly turn up in our hamlet. It's technically part of the town and we use the name of the town on our mailing address, but we usually have to specify our hamlet's name when telling people where we live, or else they'll think we live closer to the heart of town.\n\nHope that helped!"
