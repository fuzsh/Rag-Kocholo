        "text": "The Village Store meant different things to different folks: a general store, a hardware shop, or a fishing supply spot. But in 1949, inside that store, developer Clarence E. Duffner, Sr. made a big decision over coffee. He bought forty acres of empty land and named it \"The Village\". Duffner built homes in the southwest, and developer Floyd Harrison worked on the east near Pennsylvania Avenue. They shared a vision and in 1959, The Village became a city. Gene Bumpass, the former Police Chief of Altus, became the first City Manager.\n\nToday, The Village is a thriving community with around 9,321 residents. It has its own fire and police departments, sits between Oklahoma City and Nichols Hills, and boasts landmarks like Love's Travel Stops and Country Stores' headquarters, the OKC Friday newspaper, and Casady School.\n\nThe Village is governed by an elected Council, with the Mayor's position rotating. As we look to the future, we're committed to close-knit relationships, a great quality of life, and preserving The Village's unique character.\n\nForm of Government\n\nThe City of The Village is a “home rule” city with its own charter. The City Charter provides for a form of government known as the “Council-Manager” government. All powers of the city must be exercised as prescribed by the charter, except where state law supersedes the provisions of the charter."
