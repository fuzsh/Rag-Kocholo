        "text": "Section 52 of The Municipalities Act provides the authority for a village or resort village to become a town and a town to become a village or resort village.\n\nTo become a town, a village or resort village must have a population of 500 or more. A town may request its status be changed to a village or resort village if the population is less than 500.\n\nWhen council is considering a status change, it is recommended that an informal public meeting be held to discuss the proposal to inform the community of council's intention. Any residents that would be affected by the status change should attend the public meeting.\n\nIf the status of a municipality changes, a new council must be elected to serve the community. Therefore, council may wish for the change to coincide with a general election.\n\nProcess\n\nOnce a final decision has been made to request a status change, the council should submit the following information to the Ministry of Government Relations:\n\nA certified copy of a resolution of council requesting the status change;\n\nAn outline of the public consultation regarding the request;\n\nConfirmation of the population; and\n\nThe suggested details to hold an election to vote for the council of the new municipality, including the number of council members.\n\nIf the Minister is of the opinion that the status of the municipality should be changed, the Minister will issue an order causing the status of the municipality to be changed.\n\nThe Minister's Order will:\n\nDeclare the municipality to be incorporated, assign a name to it, and describe its boundaries;\n\nFix a day, hour, and place for the nomination day for the election of a council, which day may be before the effective date of the order;\n\nAppoint a person to act as the returning officer for the election;\n\nFix a day, hour, and place for the first meeting of the council; and\n\nInclude any other provision the minister considers necessary to facilitate the incorporation and to enable the holding of the first election and first meeting of the council."
