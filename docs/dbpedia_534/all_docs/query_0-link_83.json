They met at a dance in Mascoutah, Illinois, in 1957 – he glimpsed her across a crowded dance floor as the band played “Blue Moon,” and told her that same night that he was going to marry her. Although she scoffed at the notion then, she was unable to resist his charms, and they wed the following April at St. John’s United Church of Christ, in Granite City.\n\nChildren soon followed, and Rosemarie became a stay-at-home mom, and over time, the quintessential cupcake-baking room mother at Nameoki School. The Weil home in that school’s neighborhood became a gathering spot for the friends of Rosemarie’s children, and for extended family, packed around the kitchen table to eat, drink, play cards, board games, or discuss the issues of the day, which continued through her life. Many a world problem was settled at that table.\n\nWhen AO Smith shuttered its Granite City plant in 1980 and Russell was forced into early retirement, Rosemarie re-entered the workforce, first teaching sewing lessons at St. Clair Square Mall, and then in a number of retail jobs, ending her career at Dillard’s at the mall, where she worked in the housewares department for many years. She also was the bookkeeper and co-owner of Weil’s Antiques, which her husband operated for nearly 50 years.\n\nRosemarie was an award-winning seamstress and baker, perfecting a fruitcake recipe that won multiple baking competitions over the years. Even people who claimed to steadfastly loathe fruitcake, which is a nontrivial percentage of the world, would gobble down Rosemarie’s version, and ask for more. That so many people find fruitcake to be utterly disgusting was something she embraced as a challenge, to create a recipe that people actually wanted to eat.\n\nShe was known for approaching everything in life in her own way, with “My Way,” sung by Frank Sinatra, her personal theme song. She also loved the music of Elvis Presley, Johnny Mathis, and many other singers and musicians, encouraging her children’s passion for rock ‘n’ roll and all other genres. In her later years, she enjoyed following “The Voice” and having avid discussions about the ongoing proceedings and outcome with her friend, Lesa Jarrard Smith. Rosemarie also loved movies – everything from schmaltzy romance stories to horror films. She liked to stay up late, pop popcorn, and watch the Saturday night Creature Feature with her kids during their childhoods.\n\nA voracious reader, she enjoyed mysteries, historical fiction, romance novels, cookbooks, and the Bible\n\nRosemarie endured many challenges, heartbreaks, and losses in her life, but she maintained steadfast faith in the power of prayer and hope in the future. She wanted to be remembered for trying to be a good mom, and although her many struggles often made it difficult for her to be her best self, when she succeeded, she was the kind of mom everyone wished they had. As such, she was a favorite aunt to many nephews, in particular, and also nieces. She was unparalleled as a grandparent, taking great joy in her role as “Granny Rosie,” even though her entire life she made it abundantly clear that she was not to be called “Rosie.” Ever. Until her then-young granddaughter spontaneously took to calling her that.\n\nRosemarie was preceded in death by her husband, Russell, the great love of her life; their son, David; her parents; her in-laws, Oscar Sr., and Clara (Persbacher) Weil, with whom she was very close; her brothers, George, Jr., Joseph, Michael, and Wayne; and many other treasured loved ones and friends.

Rosemarie also is survived by many cherished nieces and nephews, as part of a large extended family, as well as cousins, and her brother-in-law, Floyd Weil, and his wife, Joan, of Trenton, and sister-in-law, Bernetta (Weil) Radford, of Cahokia.\n\nDonations in her memory may be made to any nonprofit organization that works to benefit children or military veterans, two causes that were dear to Rosemarie. A memorial service will be held in late April, to honor and celebrate her life.\n\nJuanita was a full time loving and dedicated homemaker and enjoyed gardening and especially growing roses.
