        "text": "In New York State, the village is a general purpose municipal corporation formed voluntarily by the residents of an area in one or more towns to provide themselves with municipal services. But when a village is created, its area still remains a part of the town where it is located, and its residents continue to be residents and taxpayers of that town.\n\nThe first village was incorporated at the end of the eighteenth century. The village form of municipal organization became a prominent feature of the state’s growing metropolitan areas between 1900 and 1940. The patterns of village organization are similar to those of cities.\n\nMany people think of villages as being small, rural communities. Population size alone, however, does not determine whether one community becomes a village and another remains as an unincorporated “hamlet” in a town. In New York State, a village is a legal concept; it is a municipal corporation. The largest village in the state, Hempstead in Nassau County, had more than 53,000 residents in 2010, while the smallest city, Sherrill, had 3,071. Forty-eight of New York’s 62 cities had populations in the year 2010 that were smaller than Hempstead’s.\n\nVillages were originally formed within towns to provide services for clusters of residents, first in relatively rural areas and later in suburban areas around large cities. Today, many of the existing 550 villages are in the areas surrounding the state’s larger cities. Many villages have public service responsibilities which differ little from those of cities, towns and counties, and village officials face the full range of municipal obligations and challenges.\n\nA village is often referred to as “incorporated.” However, since legally cities, towns, villages and counties are all “incorporated,” there are no “unincorporated villages.” The vernacular “incorporated village” likely came about because villages are areas within towns for which an additional municipal corporation has been formed.\n\nMany places in the state having large numbers of people living in close proximity to one another are neither villages nor cities. Many have names, like neighborhoods often do. Others may even have a post office that bears the community’s name. Some, like Levittown on Long Island, have thousands of residents. If, however, the people in these informal communities have not incorporated pursuant to the Village Law, they do not constitute a village. While many people refer to such places as “hamlets”, the term “hamlet” does not define a formal community like a city, town or village.\n\nBy definition, a village is a municipality which, at the time of its incorporation, met statutory requirements then established as prerequisites to that incorporation (Village Law.) Although the Village Law now sets area and population criteria for initial village incorporation, a number of existing villages have populations smaller than the present statutory minimum.\n\nThe earliest villages in the state were incorporated partly to circumvent the legal confusion about the nature and scope of town government that resulted from legislative modification of English statutes. Generally, in the decades after the Revolution, villages in New York were created because clusters of people in otherwise sparsely settled towns wanted to secure fire or police protection or other public services. Those inhabitants receiving the fire or police service, and not the whole town, paid for such services. A forerunner of villages appears to have been a 1787 legislative act granting special privileges to part of a town, entitled “An act for the better extinguishing of fires in the town of Brooklyn.”\n\nThe appearance of the village as a formal unit of local government stems from the 1790s. Villages were created by special acts of State Legislature, but the starting date for this process is in dispute among historians due to a lack of precision in terminology in those early legislative acts. In 1790, the Legislature granted specific powers to the trustees of “…​ part of the town of Rensselaerwyck, commonly called Lansingburgh.” The term “village” first appeared in state law in a 1794 enactment incorporating Waterford. The legislative act of 1798, providing for the incorporation of Lansingburgh and Troy as villages, is seen by many historians as the first formal authorization in the state for the village form of government. This enactment included all of the legal elements (including an incorporation clause and delegation of taxing and regulatory power) deemed necessary for a true unit of local government.\n\nFirst mention of the village as a constitutional civil division appeared in a section of the 1821 Constitution prescribing qualifications of voters. The Constitution of 1846 required that the Legislature “provide for the organization of cities and incorporated villages.” The Legislature passed a general Village Law in 1847, but continued to incorporate villages through the enactment of special charters, as it had for the previous half-century. Separate incorporation led to a variety of village government forms, even for villages of similar characteristics. In 1874, however, a revised Constitution forbade incorporation of villages by special act of the State Legislature. Since that time, New York State villages have been formed through local initiative pursuant to the Village Law.\n\nAn 1897 revision of the Village Law subjected those villages with charters to provisions of the Village Law that were not inconsistent with their charters. It also gave the charter villages the option of reincorporating under the general law. Although numerous charter villages did reincorporate, 12 villages still operate under charters. These are Alexander, Carthage, Catskill, Cooperstown, Deposit, Fredonia, Ilion, Mohawk, Ossining, Owego, Port Chester and Waterford.\n\nIn the first 40 years of the twentieth century, as people moved from cities into the suburbs, more than 160 villages were incorporated under the Village Law. The rapid growth of towns in suburban areas in the late 1930s and following World War II emphasized the need for alternatives to villages. To provide services, suburban areas made increasing use of the town improvement district. This had a profound effect on the growth of villages. Although more than 160 villages were formed from 1900 to 1940, 27 new villages appeared and 26 villages dissolved between 1940 and December 31, 2012.\n\nThere were 535 villages in New York State in 2018. They range in size from the Village of Dering Harbor with a 2010 Census population of 11, to the Village of Hempstead, with a 2010 Census population of 53,891. The majority of villages have populations under 2,500, although there were 24 villages between 10,000 and 20,000 population in 2010, and 11 villages with more than 20,000 population.\n\nThere are 72 villages located in two towns and 5 villages are located in three towns. There are nine villages which are in two counties. One village, Saranac Lake, lies in three towns and two counties. Five villages — Green Island in Albany County; East Rochester in Monroe County; and Scarsdale, Harrison and Mount Kisco in Westchester County — are coterminous with towns of the same name. A coterminous town-village is a unique form of local government organization. The town and village share the same boundaries and the governing body of one unit of the coterminous government may serve as the governing body of the other unit (i.e., the mayor serves as town supervisor and trustees serve as members of the town board).\n\nJust as villages are formed by local action, they can be dissolved by local action. Article 17-A of the General Municipal Law, effective March 2010, provides the procedure for village officials and electors to disband their village. Since villages are formed within towns, the underlying town or towns would become fully responsible for governing the territory of the former village after it is dissolved.\n\nThe dissolution process may be commenced by the village board of trustees on its own motion or through the presentation of an appropriate petition to the board of trustees. If the board seeks to initiate dissolution process on its own motion, it may submit a proposition to dissolve the village to the electors, in accordance with a plan for dissolution. If a petition is presented, the board is obligated to hold a referendum on the dissolution question. If a majority of electors vote to dissolve, then the board must create and endorse a ‘dissolution plan’, which is subject to permissive referendum by the electors. In either case, the question must be decided by the voters of the village at an election.\n\nIt is not unusual for a village board to seek assistance of community members and other government officials as it explores the question of dissolution. One way of doing this is to form a study committee charged with preparing a dissolution study and a draft dissolution plan for consideration by the board of trustees. Alternatively, the board of trustees can study dissolution on its own, with the assistance of other village officers and employees. Since village dissolution results in the termination of the corporate entity, there are many issues to be considered, including:\n\npotential means to continue services, such as fire, police, garbage collection, water and sewer services, and the projected cost of services;\n\ndisposition of surplus village properties;\n\nregulatory matters, such as the continuation of land use restrictions; and\n\ncontinuing contractual matters, including public employee contracts.\n\nMany of these issues require implementation by the underlying town or towns, yet the statutory dissolution process provides no role for towns. Despite this, successful dissolutions have involved town officials from the start of dissolution deliberations. This can be accomplished through active participation of town officials on a village study committee or through regular joint meetings of village and town officers. While village electors alone determine whether dissolution will occur, these same electors are, and will continue to be after dissolution, town electors as well. This factor favors early and active participation by town officers as the plan for dissolution is formed.\n\nTable 3.
