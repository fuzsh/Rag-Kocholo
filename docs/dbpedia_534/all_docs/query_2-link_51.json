(May 1) - Matt Elko pitched a two-hit shutout as the Saint Vincent baseball team fell 4-0 to visting Thiel at Bearcat Ballfield in Latrobe.\n\nThiel got a pair of two-run RBI singles, one in the second inning and another in the seventh inning. That was more than enough run support for Elko, who shut down the SVC offense, limiting the Bearcats to just two hits while striking out 13 over nine innings of work.\n\nBoth Saint Vincent hits came courtesy of senior first baseman John Malone, who improved his team-leading batting average to .462.\n\nSenior pitcher Steve Janik pitched a complete game as well, allowing four runs on 15 hits in nine innings of work. Janik struck out one and walked one as he dropped to 4-4 on the season.\n\nSVC falls to 17-19 overall and 9-13 in Presidents' Athletic Conference play. Thiel keeps their hopes alive of finishing in first place in the PAC, improving to 16-6 in league play and 27-11 overall.\n\nThe two teams wrap up their respective regular seasons tomorrow (May 2) with a PAC doubleheader in Greenville, Pa. First pitch is scheduled for 1 p.m."
