        "text": "Finding what might work best for you takes a little thought, so we’ve put together a bit of guidance to help you on your way.\n\nIs the pace of city life right for you?\n\nIf you enjoy the hustle and bustle, city life could be just what you’re looking for.\n\nSo much to see and do\n\nCities are full of different communities and represent a chance to live amongst people, ideas and cultures from all over the world. If you love film, art, sport, theatre and museums you’ll likely be spoilt for choice. You’ll also find great bars, restaurants and enough retail experiences to satisfy even the most avid shopper.\n\nYou’re also more likely to live close to services such as hospitals, GP surgery and universities.\n\nTransport links should be excellent, and you may have the opportunity to live a car-free life (if desired). In general there are also more job opportunities in the bigger cities – with potentially higher salaries – so it might be the right decision if advancing your career is important to you.\n\nIn case you’re wondering, here’s a list of the UK’s most popular cities according to a YouGov survey:\n\nYork\n\nEdinburgh\n\nLondon\n\nCambridge\n\nOxford\n\nBrighton\n\nIn short, there’s a lot to love about city living\n\nWith so many cultural events going on, you’ll never be short of things to do.\n\nThe huge range of restaurants and bars is enough to satisfy anyone.\n\nExcellent transport links make getting around the city and travelling further afield easy.\n\nWith so many businesses based in cities, career opportunities tend to be better.\n\nSchools, hospitals and GP services should be close at hand.\n\nIs village life your great escape?\n\nAre you drawn to the idea of getting closer to nature? Is the rise of remote working giving you the freedom to consider heading out of town? Whatever your motivation, moving to the countryside and a picturesque village could be a good idea.\n\nFinding the right spot\n\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that villages aren’t uniform. While some are extremely small with very few amenities, others are quite large, bustling communities with much more going on.\n\nWhich location you aim for will be influenced by your stage of life. For instance, if you have a growing family, ask yourself a few key questions:\n\nIs the village you’re looking at in a catchment area for good schools?\n\nHow long will it take to commute to work? Will you be happy setting off early and arriving home later every day?\n\nWhile an extended commute might be a drawback, on the other side of the coin, the countryside will give you and your family the chance to enjoy the great outdoors – playing sports, exploring nature, cycling in the fresh air and walking the dog.\n\nIf you’re a bit older, living in a village can bring a number of benefits:\n\nThere’s often a great community spirit.\n\nA close-knit community can mean you get know your neighbours quicker than in a town.\n\nWhile there might be fewer options in terms of culture and entertainment, you might be surprised by how many local clubs and societies you can join.\n\nWhat could you afford?\n\nPrices for village homes vary enormously across the UK. At one end of the scale, there are sought-after commuter villages and renowned beauty spots like the Cotswolds. On the other hand, County Durham, Cumbria, and Fenland all offer a combination of rural scenic beauty and affordable prices.[1]\n\nHere’s our summary to help you decide if rural life is right for you\n\nVillages tend to be a haven of peace and quiet.\n\nWith an amazing network of footpaths in the countryside a short walk can take you the heart of nature.\n\nWith less traffic, pollution levels are low and the air is fresher.\n\nMost villages have a strong feeling of community with more going on than you’d imagine.\n\nBuilding up a support network of friends can be easy.\n\nWould a town fit the bill?\n\nCity too frenetic? Village too quiet? A lively town could be the perfect compromise.\n\nMore for your money\n\nIf you’re moving from a city or village, average house prices are generally lower in towns, so you might be able to buy a bigger property. That’s good news if you have a growing family or are planning to start one.\n\nTransport links tend to be good too, particularly if the town is close to a big urban centre. In terms of job opportunities, a town can’t always match a big city, but may be significantly better compared to a village. The rise of remote working has also made moving out of the city to somewhere less hectic a much more viable option.\n\nWill there be enough to do?\n\nModern towns have changed dramatically over the past few years. Many now have great entertainment and shopping areas, as well as plenty of restaurants and pubs. If you like getting in touch with nature, you should find good parks and outdoor spaces to explore nearby.\n\nIn the end, towns can be a good compromise – a half-way house that offers a well-balanced mix of urban and rural living. The trick is finding the one that suits your lifestyle best.\n\nHere are the main reasons people choose to move to a town\n\nMany market towns have a strong sense of community, history and civic pride.\n\nTowns are often surrounded by areas of natural beauty within easy reach.\n\nFrom travel to trade services, the cost of living can be more economical compared to the city.\n\nYou should have easy access to good schools, hospitals and GP services.\n\nMost towns have good public transport and excellent links to the rest of the country.\n\nReady to make your move?\n\nIf you’ve already thought long and hard about moving to a city, town or village, we are here to help you find your next energy-efficient home in the ideal location.\n\nStart your search >\n\nWhether you’re a first-time or existing buyer, we have a range of offers to help you make your next move.\n\nMake your move with our Low Deposit offers>\n\nMake your move with our Help to Sell offers>\n\nReferences\n\n[1] https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/property/a35935761/affordable-rural-places-buy-home-uk/\n\n[2] https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/england-most-expensive-cheapest-market-towns-home-buyers-b939909.html"
