        "text": "In the contemporary era, human settlements have vastly evolved and broadened, extending beyond their traditional definitions.\n\nThis piece aims to shed light on the significant differences between two main types of human settlements: Cities and Villages.\n\nTypically, a city is a permanent, large-scale settlement with well-defined administrative boundaries. The majority of its residents are involved in non-agricultural professions.\n\nConversely, a village is a smaller cluster of human settlements, often situated in rural regions and home to a comparatively smaller population.\n\nWe will delve deeper into the differences between a City and Village within the framework of the IAS Exam\n\nContrasting City and Village\n\nCity Village Cities are significant hubs of commerce and culture, governed by local laws, and equipped with well-structured housing, transportation, and sanitation systems. Villages are small clusters of human settlements, where permanent residences are closely grouped for enhanced social interaction and cohesion among inhabitants. Cities usually span over extensive land areas. Villages, however, cover a limited land area. According to the Indian Census, a settlement with a population of 4 million or more, and where at least 75% of the male working population is engaged in non-agricultural activities, is classified as a city. As per the Indian Census, there are 3,961 villages with a population exceeding 10,000 individuals. The 2011 Census of India states that about 377 Million, approximately 31.16% of the total population, reside in cities. According to the 2011 Census of India, about 83 crore of the total population lives in villages. It is generally believed that the formation of the first cities dates back to the Neolithic era (10,000â€“4,500 BC). Early examples of cities include Sumer, Ur and the cities of the Indus Valley Civilization Villages were established in the early stages of human civilization, likely succeeding the Stone-Age era.\n\nCities and Villages are topics covered under Sociology, which is an optional subject in the UPSC Mains Exam.
