A key difference between villages and cities is that villages are small rural settlements with close-knit communities and simpler lifestyles, relying on agriculture or traditional industries. They have limited infrastructure. Whereas, Cities are large urban areas with developed infrastructure, diverse economies, and a faster-paced lifestyle, offering a wide range of amenities and opportunities.\n\nTable of content\n\n1.
