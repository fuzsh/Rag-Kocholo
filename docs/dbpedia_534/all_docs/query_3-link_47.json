        "text": "A village is a community made up of a small number of houses, usually in a country area. A village is bigger than a hamlet but smaller than a town or city. The number of inhabitants can range from a few hundred to a few thousand.\n\nVillages are usually found in rural, or agricultural, areas and they are surrounded by countryside. Many villages in the United Kingdom have churches. Shops, post offices, schools, medical centers, and other services may also be present, depending on the size of the village.\n\nA village is a type of settlement where people live near one another and share local services and facilities. Most villages grow in a location that has, or had, particular advantages to the community. Long ago, villages often developed near rivers or other sources of fresh water. Today, other factors—such as the availability of jobs, links to transportation, and shops—are likely to be important in the growth or decline of a village.\n\nThe first settlers in most areas had to find places that would be safe to live and that would provide them with resources they needed, such as water, building materials, and good land for farming. Many villages grew near parts of rivers, called fords, that were shallow enough to cross on foot.\n\nOver time, roads and footpaths developed between villages as people traded with one another. Some villages grew into towns or cities, others declined or disappeared completely.\n\nSome of the people who use the village regularly and are involved in village life may not live in the village itself. They may live in the hamlets or farms that surround it. Some villagers may work many miles away, in a town or city, and commute to work daily."
