        "text": "Use of iodine for water disinfection: iodine toxicity and maximum recommended dose.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBacker, H; Hollowell, J\n\n2000-01-01\n\nIodine is an effective, simple, and cost-efficient means of water disinfection for people who vacation, travel, or work in areas where municipal water treatment is not reliable. However, there is considerable controversy about the maximum safe iodine dose and duration of use when iodine is ingested in excess of the recommended daily dietary amount. The major health effect of concern with excess iodine ingestion is thyroid disorders, primarily hypothyroidism with or without iodine-induced goiter. A review of the human trials on the safety of iodine ingestion indicates that neither the maximum recommended dietary dose (2 mg/day) nor the maximum recommended duration of use (3 weeks) has a firm basis. Rather than a clear threshold response level or a linear and temporal dose-response relationship between iodine intake and thyroid function, there appears to be marked individual sensitivity, often resulting from unmasking of underlying thyroid disease. The use of iodine for water disinfection requires a risk-benefit decision based on iodine's benefit as a disinfectant and the changes it induces in thyroid physiology. By using appropriate disinfection techniques and monitoring thyroid function, most people can use iodine for water treatment over a prolonged period of time.

Direct measurements of three individual iodine species: I(-), I2 and I3(-), were made. In addition three measures of total titratable iodine species were used. It has been found that I2 and I3(-) solutions produce a significant fraction of the non-disinfecting species iodine I(-), ranging from 50 to 80% of added iodine, respectively, at pH values of approximately 5. Correspondingly, I2 solutions produce more than twice the concentration of disinfecting iodine species per mass iodine dose than I3(-) solutions. Both I(-) and I2 species were found in aqeuous extracts of pentaiodide resin, although no soluble species were detected with triiodide resin.\n\nEffect of iodine disinfection products on higher plants\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJanik, D.; Macler, B.; Macelroy, R. D.; Thorstenson, Y.; Sauer, R.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nIodine is used to disinfect potable water on United States spacecraft. Iodinated potable water will likely be used to grow plants in space. Little is known about the effects of iodine disinfection products on plants. Seeds of select higher plants were germinated in water iodinated using the Shuttle Microbial Check Valve, and water to which measured amounts of iodine was added. Percent germination was decreased in seeds of most species germinated in iodinated water. Beans were most affected. Germination rates, determined from germination half-times, were decreased for beans germinated in iodinated water, and water to which iodide was added. Development was retarded and rootlets were conspicuously absent in bean and several other plant species germinated in iodinated water. Iodide alone did not elicit these responses. Clearly iodine disinfection products can affect higher plants. These effects must be carefully considered for plant experimentation and cultivation in space, and in design and testing of closed environmental life support systems.\n\nMedical effects of iodine disinfection products in spacecraft water\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSauer, Richard L.; Janik, Daniel S.; Thorstenson, Yvonne R.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nVarious iodination products (IDPs), including iodinated and iodine-induced new compounds, will be present in the iodine-disinfected water that is expected to be used by crews on the NASA Space Station and on long duration missions. The metabolic intermediaries created by such a process may be more important to crew health than the parent IDPs, and reclamation and recycling may be expected to produce additional products. These medical effects may be expressed in crews as hypersensitivity, allergic, acute toxic, and chronic toxic reactions, as well as modifications of immune system response.\n\nDo Iodine Contrast Media Compounds Used for Medical Imaging Contribute to the Formation of Iodinated Disinfection By-Products in Drinking Water?\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nIodinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) have recently gained attention due to their cyto- and genotoxicity and increased formation in drinking water treated with chloramine, which has become an increasingly popular disinfectant in the United States.

A.; Clarkson, T. W.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nIn order to establish guidelines for exposure of astronauts to iodine, used as a water disinfectant in space, we studied the usefulness of hair, saliva, and urine for biological monitoring in humans and in the human hair/nude mouse model. The monitoring of iodine in patients that received 150 mCi of Na131I (carrier-free) showed similar patterns of elimination for blood, saliva, and urine. The mean correlation coefficient (r) between iodine elimination for blood/saliva was 0.99, for blood/urine, 0.95, and for saliva/urine, 0.97. The absolute value of iodine concentrations in urine revealed marked variability, which was corrected by adjusting for creatinine levels. The autoradiographic studies of human hair demonstrated that iodine is rapidly incorporated into external layers of the hair root and can be removed easily during washing. These data were confirmed after iodine exposure using the human hair/nude mouse model. Hair does not provide satisfactory information about exposure due to unstable incorporation of iodine. The most useful medium for biological monitoring of astronauts exposed to high doses of iodine in drinking water is urine, when adjusted for creatinine, and saliva, if quantitative evaluation of flow rate is provided.\n\nFormation and occurrence of new polar iodinated disinfection byproducts in drinking water.\n\nPubMed\n\nPan, Yang; Li, Wenbin; An, Hao; Cui, Hao; Wang, Ying\n\n2016-02-01\n\nDuring drinking water disinfection, iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) can be generated through reactions between iodide, disinfectants, and natural organic matter. Drinking water I-DBPs have been increasingly attracting attention as emerging organic pollutants as a result of their significantly higher toxicity and growth inhibition than their chloro- and bromo-analogues. In this study, by adopting ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry precursor ion scan, multiple reaction monitoring, and product ion scan analyses, 11 new polar I-DBPs with confirmed structures and eight new polar I-DBPs with proposed structures were detected in simulated drinking water samples. Chloramination of simulated raw waters containing natural organic matter with higher aromaticity produced higher levels of new phenolic I-DBPs. Formation of new polar I-DBPs and total organic iodine (TOI) was most favored in chloramination, followed by chlorine dioxide treatment, and relatively minor in chlorination. Lower pH in chloramination substantially enhanced the formation of new polar I-DBPs and TOI. NH2Cl and dissolved organic nitrogen could be important nitrogen sources and precursors for formation of the two new nitrogenous phenolic I-DBPs. Notably, in tap water samples collected from nine major cities located in the Yangtze River Delta region of China, seven of the 11 new polar I-DBPs with confirmed structures were detected at levels from 0.11 to 28 ng/L, and the two new nitrogenous phenolic I-DBPs were ubiquitous with concentrations from 0.12 to 24 ng/L, likely due to the relatively high dissolved organic nitrogen levels in regional source waters.

Of particular concern has been the microbiological quality of the potable water. This has required the development of both preflight water system servicing procedures to disinfect the systems and inflight disinfectant addition and monitoring devices to ensure continuing microbiological control. The disinfectants successfully used to date have been aqueous chlorine or iodine. Because of special system limitations the use of iodine has been the most successful for inflight use and promises to be the agent most likely to be used in the future. Future spacecraft potable, hygiene, and experiment water systems will utilize recycled water. This will present special problems for water quality control. NASA is currently conducting research and development to solve these problems.\n\nHigh-Performance Water-Iodinating Cartridge\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSauer, Richard; Gibbons, Randall E.; Flanagan, David T.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nHigh-performance cartridge contains bed of crystalline iodine iodinates water to near saturation in single pass.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of 4 iodine-based teat dips on milk iodide concentrations varying in iodine level (0.25% vs. 0.5%, w/w), normal low viscosity dip versus barrier dip, and application method (dip vs. spray) to ensure safe iodine levels in dairy milk when these products are used. The iodine exposure study was performed during a 2-wk period. The trial farm was purged of all iodine-based disinfection products for 21 d during a prestudy \"washout period,\" which resulted in baseline milk iodide range of 145 to 182 ppb. During the experiment, iodine-based teat dips were used as post-milking teat disinfectants and compared to a non-iodine control disinfectant. Milk iodide residue levels for each treatment was evaluated from composited group samples. Introduction of different iodine-based teat disinfectants increased iodide residue content in milk relative to the control by between 8 and 29 Î¼g/L when averaged across the full trial period. However, residues levels for any treatment remained well below the consumable limit of 500 Î¼g/L. The 0.5% iodine disinfectant increased milk iodide levels by 20 Î¼g/L more compared to the 0.25% iodine. Compared to dip-cup application, spray application significantly increased milk iodide residue by 21 Î¼g/L and utilized approximately 23% more teat dip. This carefully controlled study demonstrated an increase in milk iodide concentrations from iodine disinfectants, but increases were small and within acceptable limits.

We examined the toxicity of iodine to Atlantic salmon eggs and its effectiveness as a disinfectant against bacteria on egg surfaces. We spawned and fertilized eight gravid Atlantic salmon from Cayuga Lake, New York, and exposed their eggs to 10 concentrations of iodine (5, 10, 50, 75, 100, 500, 750, 1,000, 5,000, and 7,500 mg/L) for 30 min during water hardening. An additional subsample of unfertilized eggs was also exposed to some of the same concentrations of iodine (5, 10, 50, 75, and 100 mg/L) to determine the efficiency of disinfection. Viable eggs were only obtained from four females. Survival of eggs to the eyed stage and hatch tended to be reduced at iodine concentrations of 50 and 75 mg/L and was significantly reduced at concentrations of 100 mg/L iodine or more. We calculated the concentrations of iodine that killed 50% of the Atlantic salmon eggs at eye-up and hatch to be 175 and 85 mg/L, respectively. Aeromonas veronii, A. schubertii, A. hydrophila, A. caviae, Plesiomonas shiggeloides, and Citrobacter spp. were the predominant bacteria present on the surface of green eggs and were significantly reduced by an iodine immersion. The use of iodine as a disinfectant on Atlantic salmon eggs was effective at low concentrations (50â75 mg/L), for which toxicity to Atlantic salmon was minimal.\n\nNumerical simulation of iodine speciation in relation to water disinfection aboard manned spacecraft I. Equilibria\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAtwater, J. E.; Sauer, R. L.; Schultz, J. R.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nElemental iodine (I2) is currently used as the drinking water disinfectant aboard the Shuttle Orbiter and will also be incorporated into the water recovery and distribution system for the International Space Station Alpha. Controlled release of I2 is achieved using the Microbial Check Valve (MCV), a flow-through device containing an iodinated polymer which imparts a bacteriostatic residual concentration of approximately 2mg/L to the aqueous stream. During regeneration of MCV canisters, I2 concentrations of approximately 300 mg/L are used. Dissolved iodine undergoes a series of hydrolytic disproportionation and related reactions which result in the formation of an array of inorganic species including: I-, I3-, HOI, OI-, IO3-, HIO3, I2OH-, I2O(-2), and H2OI+. Numerical estimation of the steady-state distribution of inorganic iodine containing species in pure water at 25 degrees C has been achieved by simultaneous solution of the multiple equilibrium expressions as a function of pH. The results are reported herein.\n\nRecent experiences with iodine water disinfection in Shuttle\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGibbons, Randall E.; Flanagan, David T.; Schultz, John R.; Sauer, Richard L.; Slezak, Terry N.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nMicrobial proliferation in the STS potable water system is prevented by maintaining a 2-5 ppm iodine residual. The iodine is added to fuel cell water by an iodinated ion exchange resin in the Microbial Check Valve (MCV). Crew comments indicated excessive iodine in the potable water. To better define the problem, a method of in-flight iodine analysis was developed. Inflight analysis during STS-30 and STS-28 indicated iodine residuals were generally in the 9-13 ppm range. It was determined that the high iodine residual was caused by MCV influent temperatures in excess of 120 F. This is well above the MCV operating range of 65-90 F. The solution to this problem was to develop a resin suitable for the higher temperatures. Since 8 months were required to formulate a MCV resin suitable for the higher temperatures, a temporary solution was necessary. Two additional MCV's were installed on the chilled and ambient water lines leading into the galley to remove the excess iodine. These reduced the iodine residual to 3-4 ppm during STS-33, STS-34, STS-36 and STS-32. A high-temperature resin was formulated and initially flown on STS-31.\n\nElectrochemical control of iodine disinfectant for space transportation system and space station potable water\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGeer, Richard D.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAn electrochemical microbial check valve method (EC-MCV) for controlling the iodine disinfectant in potable water (PW) for NASA's space operations was proposed. The factors affecting the design and performance of the unit were analyzed. This showed that it would be feasible to construct a recyclable unit in a small volume that will operate in either an iodine removal or addition mode. The EC-MCV should remove active iodine species rapidly from PW, but the rapid delivery rates at end-use may make complete removal of excess I(-) difficult under some conditions. Its performace change with AgI buildup needs to be investigated, as this controls the time for recycling the unit. The EC-MCV has advantages over the passive microbial check valve (MCV) method currently in use, as it would allow precise control of the I2 level and would not introduce excess I(-) to the water. The presence of oxygen in the EC-MCV needs to be investigated as it could affect the efficiency of I2 addition and excess I(-) removal.\n\nThe impact of iodinated X-ray contrast agents on formation and toxicity of disinfection by-products in drinking water.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeong, Clara H; Machek, Edward J; Shakeri, Morteza; Duirk, Stephen E; Ternes, Thomas A; Richardson, Susan D; Wagner, Elizabeth D; Plewa, Michael J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe presence of iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) in source waters is of high concern to public health because of their potential to generate highly toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs). The objective of this study was to determine the impact of ICM in source waters and the type of disinfectant on the overall toxicity of DBP mixtures and to determine which ICM and reaction conditions give rise to toxic by-products. Source waters collected from Akron, OH were treated with five different ICMs, including iopamidol, iopromide, iohexol, diatrizoate and iomeprol, with or without chlorine or chloramine disinfection. The reaction product mixtures were concentrated with XAD resins and the mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the reaction mixture concentrates was measured. Water containing iopamidol generated an enhanced level of mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genotoxicity after disinfection. While chlorine disinfection with iopamidol resulted in the highest cytotoxicity overall, the relative iopamidol-mediated increase in toxicity was greater when chloramine was used as the disinfectant compared with chlorine. Four other ICMs (iopromide, iohexol, diatrizoate, and iomeprol) expressed some cytotoxicity over the control without any disinfection, and induced higher cytotoxicity when chlorinated. Only iohexol enhanced genotoxicity compared to the chlorinated source water. Copyright Â© 2017.

Iodinated DBPs can be toxic to humans, and they also have the potential to affect aquatic communities. Because of the specific use of iodine and iodine-containing compounds in dairies, such livestock operations can be a potential source of iodinated DBPs in corresponding receiving water bodies. DBPs [trihalomethanes (THMs), including iodinated THMs] were measured within dairy processing facilities (milking and cheese manufacturing) and surface waters that receive dairy-impacted effluents [either directly from the dairy or through wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)] in three areas of the United States (California, New York, and Wisconsin). Iodo-THMs comprised 15â29% of the total THMs in surface water near WWTP effluents that were impacted by dairy waste and 0â100% of the total THMs in samples from dairy processing facilities.\n\nDetermination of iodide, iodate and organo-iodine in waters with a new total organic iodine measurement approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nGong, Tingting; Zhang, Xiangru\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe dissolved iodine species that dominate aquatic systems are iodide, iodate and organo-iodine. These species may undergo transformation to one another and thus affect the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts during disinfection of drinking waters or wastewater effluents. In this study, a fast, sensitive and accurate method for determining these iodine species in waters was developed by derivatizing iodide and iodate to organic iodine and measuring organic iodine with a total organic iodine (TOI) measurement approach. Within this method, organo-iodine was determined directly by TOI measurement; iodide was oxidized by monochloramine to hypoiodous acid and then hypoiodous acid reacted with phenol to form organic iodine, which was determined by TOI measurement; iodate was reduced by ascorbic acid to iodide and then determined as iodide. The quantitation limit of organo-iodine or sum of organo-iodine and iodide or sum of organo-iodine, iodide and iodate was 5 Î¼g/L as I for a 40 mL water sample (or 2.5 Î¼g/L as I for an 80 mL water sample, or 1.25 Î¼g/L as I for a 160 mL water sample). This method was successfully applied to the determination of iodide, iodate and organo-iodine in a variety of water samples, including tap water, seawater, urine and wastewater. The recoveries of iodide, iodate and organo-iodine were 91-109%, 90-108% and 91-108%, respectively. The concentrations and distributions of iodine species in different water samples were obtained and compared. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, concerns regarding the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs) have arisen during chloramine disinfection of iodide-containing waters in the developed world; similar concerns should pertain to iodine-based POU disinfection. Because there are alternative POU disinfection techniques, including chlorine-based disinfectants, this paper compared disinfection byproduct formation from a range of iodine-based disinfectants at their recommended dosages to chlorination and chloramination under overdosing conditions. Just as chloroform was the predominant trihalomethane (THM) forme during chlorination or chloramination, iodoform was the predominant THM formed during iodination. Conditions fostering THM formation were similar between these treatments, except that THM formation during chlorination increased with pH, while it was slightly elevated at circumneutral pH during iodination. Iodoform formation during treatment with iodine tincture was higher than during treatment with iodine tablets. On a molar basis, iodoform formation during treatment with iodine tincture was 20-60% of the formation of chloroform during chlorination, and total organic iodine (TOI) formation was twice that of total organic chlorine (TOCl), despite the 6-fold higher oxidant dose during chlorination. Based upon previous measurements of chronic mammalian cell cytotoxicity for the individual THMs, consumers of two waters treated with iodine tincture would receive the same THM-associated cytotoxic exposure in 4-19 days as a consumer of the same waters treated with a 6-fold higher dose of chlorine over 1 year. Iodoacetic acid, diiodoacetic acid, and other iodo-acids were also formed with\n\nEfficacy of iodine for disinfection of Lake Sturgeon eggs from the St. Lawrence River, New York\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nChalupnicki, Marc A.; Dittman, Dawn E.; Starliper, Clifford E.; Iwanowicz, Deborah\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOptimal fish husbandry to reduce the risk of disease is particularly important when using wild fish as the source for gametes. The propagation and reestablishment of Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens in New York waters to become a viable self-sustaining population is considered a high priority by managers. While standard hatchery egg disinfection practices have been used to prevent the transmission of diseases, data on the bacterial loads present on egg surfaces following iodine disinfection is lacking. Our study investigated the bacteria present on the outer surface of Lake Sturgeon eggs and the effectiveness of an iodine disinfection treatment in eliminating bacteria that could pose a threat to egg survival and cause hatchery disease outbreaks. During the springs of 2011â2013, 12 to 41 different species of bacteria were recovered from the outer egg surfaces prior to an iodine treatment; Aeromonas, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, and Chryseobacterium were the most common genera identified. Cohort eggs treated using the standard protocol of a single treatment of 50 mg/L iodine for 30 min resulted in an average of 57.8% reduction in bacterial CFU/g. While this is a significant reduction, bacteria were not completely eliminated and hatchery managers should be aware that pathogens could remain on Lake Sturgeon eggs following the standard iodine disinfection treatment.\n\nAntibacterial activity of dilute povidone-iodine solutions used for ocular surface disinfection in dogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, S M; Severin, G A; Lavach, J D\n\n1986-06-01\n\nBacterial cultures of specimens from healthy canine eyelids and ocular surfaces were found to demonstrate bacterial growth in 69.7% (53/76) of the eyes sampled. Organisms most commonly isolated included: Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus sp, S epidermidis, and Escherichia coli. Evaluation of dilute povidone-iodine solutions for effectiveness as ocular surface disinfectants was conducted. Bacterial growth initially detected in 32 of 46 eyes was not detected after disinfection with a 2-minute scrub and 2-minute soaking procedure, using 1:2, 1:10, or 1:50 dilutions of a povidone-iodine solution that contained 1% available iodine. The eyelid and ocular surfaces of 16 eyes were disinfected with 1:100 povidone-iodine solution. Bacterial growth initially present in 10 of 16 eyes was present in 1 eye after disinfection and consisted of a single colony of E coli. After eyes were disinfected with 1:10, 1:50, or 1:100 povidone-iodine solutions, there was no evidence of corneal epithelial edema or sloughing. In 15 eyes subjected to disinfection with the 1:2 dilution, one instance of epithelial corneal edema was noticed. A 1:50 dilution of povidone-iodine is recommended as an ocular surface disinfectant for use in presurgical situations.\n\nComputation of iodine species concentrations in water\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSchultz, John R.; Mudgett, Paul D.; Flanagan, David T.; Sauer, Richard L.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nDuring an evaluation of the use of iodine as a water disinfectant and the development of methods for measuring various iodine species in water onboard Space Freedom, it became necessary to compute the concentration of the various species based on equilibrium principles alone. Of particular concern was the case when various amounts of iodine, iodide, strong acid, and strong base are added to water. Such solutions can be used to evaluate the performance of various monitoring methods being considered. The authors of this paper present an overview of aqueous iodine chemistry, a set of nonlinear equations which can be used to model the above case, and a computer program for solving this system of equations using the Newton-Raphson method. The program was validated by comparing results over a range of concentrations and pH values with those previously presented by Gottardi for a given pH. Use of this program indicated that there are multiple roots to many cases and selecting an appropriate initial guess is important. Comparison of program results with laboratory results for the case when only iodine is added to water indicates the program gives high pH values for the iodine concentrations normally used for water disinfection. Extending the model to include the effects of iodate formation results in the computer pH values being closer to those observed, but the model with iodate does not agree well for the case in which base is added in addition to iodine to raise the pH. Potential explanations include failure to obtain equilibrium conditions in the lab, inaccuracies in published values for the equilibrium constants, and inadequate model of iodine chemistry and/or the lack of adequate analytical methods for measuring the various iodine species in water.\n\nToxic impact of bromide and iodide on drinking water disinfected with chlorine or chloramines.\n\nPubMed\n\nYang, Yang; Komaki, Yukako; Kimura, Susana Y; Hu, Hong-Ying; Wagner, Elizabeth D; MariÃ±as, Benito J; Plewa, Michael J\n\n2014-10-21\n\nDisinfectants inactivate pathogens in source water; however, they also react with organic matter and bromide/iodide to form disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Although only a few DBP classes have been systematically analyzed for toxicity, iodinated and brominated DBPs tend to be the most toxic. The objectives of this research were (1) to determine if monochloramine (NH2Cl) disinfection generated drinking water with less toxicity than water disinfected with free chlorine (HOCl) and (2) to determine the impact of added bromide and iodide in conjunction with HOCl or NH2Cl disinfection on mammalian cell cytotoxicity and genomic DNA damage induction. Water disinfected with chlorine was less cytotoxic but more genotoxic than water disinfected with chloramine. For both disinfectants, the addition of Br(-) and I(-) increased cytotoxicity and genotoxicity with a greater response observed with NH2Cl disinfection. Both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were highly correlated with TOBr and TOI. However, toxicity was weakly and inversely correlated with TOCl. Thus, the forcing agents for cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were the generation of brominated and iodinated DBPs rather than the formation of chlorinated DBPs. Disinfection practices need careful consideration especially when using source waters containing elevated bromide and iodide.\n\nGiardia cyst destruction: effectiveness of six small-quantity water disinfection methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nJarroll, E L; Bingham, A K; Meyer, E A\n\n1980-01-01\n\nNone of the available chemical methods for disinfecting drinking water has ever been tested for its ability to destory Giardia cysts. We tested the ability of six such methods to act against Giardia, using excystation as the criterion of viability. Two water qualities (cloudy and clear) and two temperatures (3 and 20 degrees C) were tested. At 20 degrees C, using cloudy and clear water, all of the method proved completely effective. However, at 3 degrees C, in cloudy water one method (\"saturated\" iodine) was less than completely effective, and in clear water four methods (bleach, Globaline, tincture of iodine and \"saturated\" iodine) failed to destory all of the cysts. The failure of these methods appears to be related to either an insufficient halogen residual or contact time. This study underlines the importance of considering water temperature when employing halogen disinfection methods.\n\nEffects of Disinfectants in Water on Mir- and Earth-Grown Wheat\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCampbell, William .F.; Bubenheim, D.

N.; Ivanova, I.; Chernova, L.; Podolsky, I.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nIodine and silver fluoride are used to purify water onboard U. S. Shuttles and the Russian Space Station, Mir, respectively. In 1995, iodine-treated water, which ranged from 1.0-4.0 mg x kg(exp -1) with a mean of 2.9 mg x kg(exp -1), was applied to Super Dwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants when Mir water (grey or tech grade) became scarce. The potential phytotoxicity of iodine on Super Dwarf wheat is an unknown. Since use of iodine-treated water was not part of the experiment, we sought to determine whether it accounted for the subsequent poor wheat seedling growth and floral development onboard the Mir. Super Dwarf wheat seeds were imbibed in iodine or silver fluoride concentrations of 0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 or 16.0 mg x kg(exp -1) for 96 h at 4 C. Five seeds were then planted per 13.3 cm x 13.3 cm pots containing a granular clinoptilolite (Cp) zeolite (1 -2 mm dia.) and placed in Percival(TM) growth chambers programmed for 20/15 C and 18/6 h d/n regime. Plants were irrigated with distilled water, and Iodine- or silver fluoride-treated distilled water. In separate experiments, seeds were treated as above and germination and early seedling growth were determined by examining seedling responses to disinfectants in rolled paper towels. Silver fluoride had very little effect on wheat seed germination. By contrast, iodine reduced germination at all treatment levels. Seedlings exposed to 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg x kg(exp -1) of iodine or silver fluoride levels exhibited a slight stimulation in shoot and root growth. Both disinfectants at 8 and 16 mg x kg(exp -1) showed significantly (p is less than or equal to 0.01) reduced seedling shoot and root lengths and fresh biomasses compared to the control and lower disinfectant levels. The number of spikelets per spike, florets per spikelet, seeds per spike and seed weight were also significantly reduced at the 8 and 16 mg x kg(exp -1) compared to the control and lower levels of disinfectant. Based on these ground\n\nConsequences of bacterial resistance to disinfection by iodine in potable water\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcfeters, Gordon A.; Pyle, Barry H.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThis study was done to quantify the sensitivity of bacteria to iodine under controlled laboratory conditions. When exposed to 1 mg/1 I2 for 1 min, bacteria isolated from the Shuttle were more resistant than a P. aeruginosa isolated from a povidine-iodine solution. Cultures grown in rich media were more sensitive than those grown in low nutrient solutions. The P. aeruginosa and a P. cepacia isolated from the Shuttle were resuspended in PBW after exposure to iodine. Iodinated cells recovered better than uniodinated controls. Pseudomonads in biofilms developed on coupons of stainless steel were more resistant to iodine than cells suspended in buffered water. Although resistant bacteria may colonize spacecraft water systems, multiple treatment barriers should provide adequate control of these contaminants.\n\nOccurrence of regulated and emerging iodinated DBPs in the Shanghai drinking water.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Xiao; Chen, Xin; Wang, Xia; Zheng, Weiwei; Zhang, Dong; Tian, Dajun; Jiang, Songhui; Ong, Choon Nam; He, Gengsheng; Qu, Weidong\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDrinking water chlorination plays a pivotal role in preventing pathogen contamination against water-borne disease. However, chemical disinfection leads to the formation of halogenated disinfection by products (DBPs). Many DBPs are highly toxic and are of health concern. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive measurements of DBPs, including iodoacetic acid (IAA), iodoform (IF), nine haloacetic acids and four trihalomethanes in drinking waters from 13 water plants in Shanghai, China. The results suggested that IAA and IF were found in all the water treatment plants, with maximum levels of 1.66 Âµg/L and 1.25 Âµg/L for IAA and IF, respectively. Owing to deterioration of water quality, the Huangpu River has higher IAA and IF than the Yangtze River. Our results also demonstrated that low pH, high natural organic matter, ammonia nitrogen, and iodide in source waters increased IAA and IF formation. Compared to chlorine, chloramines resulted in higher concentration of iodinated DBP, but reduced the levels of trihalomethanes. This is the first study to reveal the widespread occurrence of IAA and IF in drinking water in China. The data provide a better understanding on the formation of iodinated disinfection byproducts and the findings should be useful for treatment process improvement and disinfection byproducts controls.\n\nOccurrence of Regulated and Emerging Iodinated DBPs in the Shanghai Drinking Water\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWei, Xiao; Chen, Xin; Wang, Xia; Zheng, Weiwei; Zhang, Dong; Tian, Dajun; Jiang, Songhui; Ong, Choon Nam; He, Gengsheng; Qu, Weidong\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDrinking water chlorination plays a pivotal role in preventing pathogen contamination against water-borne disease.

To simplify monitoring and prediction of pathogen distribution, model indicator strains historically have been used. In this research, the male specific RNA coliphage MS-2 is used as a model of enteric viruses due to their similar size and biochemical composition. Inactivation of some water-borne enteric viruses by iodine has previously been characterized. In this paper, iodine inactivation of the model coliphage MS-2 in buffered water is compared with earlier bench-scale disinfection survival data and with survival in iodinated simulated shower water used in a test water recycling system.\n\nThyroid effects of iodine and iodide in potable water\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBull, Richard J.; Thrall, Karla D.; Sherer, Todd T.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nExperiments are reviewed which examine the comparative toxicological effects of iodide (I) and iodine (I2) when used to disinfect drinking water. References are made to a subchronic study in rats, a comparison of the distribution of radiolabeled I and I2, and a demonstration of thyroxine formation in the gastrointestinal tract. The results of the study of the rats are examined in detail; the findings show that I and I2 have opposite effects on the concentrations of thyroid hormones in blood. Iodide slightly decreases circulating thyroxine, while I2 significantly increases the thyroxine concentrations, decreases triiodothyronine levels, and does not change the weight of the thyroid gland. The related effects of I2 ingestion are set forth in detail and are shown to be unique to I2 contamination. Iodine can counteract the effects of iodide and should therefore be used as a disinfectant in drinking water.\n\nFormation of Toxic Iodinated Disinfection By-Products from Compounds Used in Medical Imaging\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nIodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) were investigated as a source of iodine in the formation of iodo-trihalomethane (iodo-THM) and iodo-acid disinfection byproducts (DBPs), both of which are highly genotoxic and/or cytotoxic in mammalian cells.

Iodine was readily adsorbed into the polymers up to 100% (w/w). The adsorption of iodine on the surface was characterized by XPS and SEM analyses. The iodine loaded IPU sponges were coated with ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), in order to release iodine in a controlled rate for water decontamination combined with active carbon cartridge, which adsorbs the iodine residues after the microbial inactivation. The EVA coated IPU were incorporated in a water purifier and tested for iodine release to water and for microbial inactivation efficiency according to WQA certification program against P231/EPA for 250l, using 25l a day with flow rate of 6-8min/1l. The antimicrobial activity was also studied against Escherichia coli and MS2 phage. Bacterial results exceeded the minimal requirement for bacterial removal of 6log reduction throughout the entire lifespan. At any testing point, no bacteria was detected in the outlet achieving more than 7.1 to more than 8log reduction as calculated upon the inlet concentration. Virus surrogate, MS2, reduction results varied from 4.11log reduction under tap water, and 5.11log reduction under basic water (pH9) to 1.32 for acidic water (pH5). Controlled and stable iodine release was observed with the EVA coated IPU sponges and was effective in deactivating the bacteria and virus present in the contaminated water and thus, these iodinated PU systems could be used in water purification to provide safe drinking water. These sponges may find applications as disinfectants in medicine.

Like the methods reported in the immediately preceding article, these methods involve chemical preparation of substrate surfaces (in this case, the surfaces of granules) to enable attachment of antimicrobial molecules to the surfaces via covalent bonds. A variety of granular materials have been coated with a variety of antimicrobial agents that include antibiotics, bacteriocins, enzymes, bactericides, and fungicides. When employed in packed beds in flowing water, these antimicrobial-coated granules have been proven effective against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Composite beds, consisting of multiple layers containing different granular antimicrobial media, have proven particularly effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms. These media have also proven effective in enhancing or potentiating the biocidal effects of in-line iodinated resins and of very low levels of dissolved elemental iodine.\n\nThyroid Function Changes Related to Use of Iodinated Water in United States Space Program\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcMonigal, Kathleen A.; Braverman, Lewis E.; Dunn, John T.; Stanbury, John B.; Wear, Mary L.; Hamm, Peggy B.; Sauer, Richard L.; Billica, Roger D.; Pool, Sam L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has used iodination as a method of microbial disinfection of potable water systems in United States spacecraft and long-duration habitability modules. A review of the effects on the thyroid following consumption o iodinated water by NASA astronauts was conducted. Pharmacological doses of iodine consumed by astronauts transiently decreased thyroid function, as reflected in serum TSH values. Although the adverse effects of excess iodine consumption in susceptible individuals are well documented, exposure to high doses of iodine during space flight did not result in a statistically significant increase in long-term thyroid disease in the astronaut population.\n\nComparative study of disinfectants for use in low-cost gravity driven household water purifiers.\n\nPubMed\n\nPatil, Rajshree A; Kausley, Shankar B; Balkunde, Pradeep L; Malhotra, Chetan P\n\n2013-09-01\n\nPoint-of-use (POU) gravity-driven household water purifiers have been proven to be a simple, low-cost and effective intervention for reducing the impact of waterborne diseases in developing countries. The goal of this study was to compare commonly used water disinfectants for their feasibility of adoption in low-cost POU water purifiers. The potency of each candidate disinfectant was evaluated by conducting a batch disinfection study for estimating the concentration of disinfectant needed to inactivate a given concentration of the bacterial strain Escherichia coli ATCC 11229. Based on the concentration of disinfectant required, the size, weight and cost of a model purifier employing that disinfectant were estimated. Model purifiers based on different disinfectants were compared and disinfectants which resulted in the most safe, compact and inexpensive purifiers were identified. Purifiers based on bromine, tincture iodine, calcium hypochlorite and sodium dichloroisocyanurate were found to be most efficient, cost effective and compact with replacement parts costing US$3.60-6.00 for every 3,000 L of water purified and are thus expected to present the most attractive value proposition to end users.\n\nComparison of Byproduct Formation in Waters Treated With Chlorine and Iodine: Relevance To Point-Of-Use Treatment\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nDue to their efficacy in deactivating a range of microbial pathogens, particularly amoebic cysts, iodine-based disinfectants have been a popular option for point-of-use (POU) drinking water disinfection by campers, the military, and rural consumers in developing countries.

ICM are widely used at medical centers to enable imaging of soft tissues (e.g., organs, veins, blood vessels) and are designed to be inert substances, with 95% eliminated in urine and feces unmetabolized within 24 h. ICM are not well removed in wastewater treatment plants, such that they have been found at elevated concentrations in rivers and streams (up to 100 Î¼g/L). Naturally occurring iodide in source waters is believed to be a primary source of iodine in the formation of iodo-DBPs, but a previous 23-city iodo-DBP occurrence study also revealed appreciable levels of iodo-DBPs in some drinking waters that had very low or no detectable iodide in their source waters. When 10 of the original 23 cities' source waters were resampled, four ICM were found--iopamidol, iopromide, iohexol, and diatrizoate--with iopamidol most frequently detected, in 6 of the 10 plants sampled, with concentrations up to 2700 ng/L. Subsequent controlled laboratory reactions of iopamidol with aqueous chlorine and monochloramine in the absence of natural organic matter (NOM) produced only trace levels of iodo-DBPs; however, when reacted in real source waters (containing NOM), chlorine and monochloramine produced significant levels of iodo-THMs and iodo-acids, up to 212 nM for dichloroiodomethane and 3.0 nM for iodoacetic acid, respectively, for chlorination. The pH behavior was different for chlorine and monochloramine, such that iodo-DBP concentrations maximized at higher pH (8.5) for chlorine, but at lower pH (6.5) for monochloramine. Extracts from chloraminated source waters with and without iopamidol, as well as from chlorinated source waters with iopamidol, were the most cytotoxic samples in mammalian cells.

Because skin flora comprise the major group of contaminant species, more effective skin disinfection at the venipuncture site could reduce contamination. We performed a randomized trial in adult inpatients at a tertiary care teaching hospital. Antecubital venipuncture sites were randomly disinfected with povidone-iodine or iodine tincture, and blood cultures (two bottles, 10 mL of blood) were drawn by professional phlebotomists. Scoring of contaminant species was restricted to skin flora. Hospital resource utilization was compared among patients with contaminated blood cultures and those with sterile blood cultures. Of the 3,851 blood cultures collected during the study, 120 (3.1%) were contaminated with skin flora. The contamination rate for blood cultures collected after povidone-iodine was 3.8% (74 of 1,947), compared with a rate of 2.4% (46 of 1,904, P = 0.01) after iodine tincture. The difference in mean total hospital costs for patients with contaminated blood cultures and those with sterile blood cultures was $4,100 (95% confidence interval: $740 to $7,400, P = 0.02). Iodine tincture is superior to povidone-iodine for venipuncture site antisepsis before blood culture sampling. Because of the high costs associated with contaminated blood cultures, hospitals should consider switching from povidone-iodine to iodine tincture. Reduction of the contamination rate may improve the quality of patient care and reduce hospital costs.\n\nIdentification, toxicity and control of iodinated disinfection byproducts in cooking with simulated chlor(am)inated tap water and iodized table salt.\n\nPubMed\n\nPan, Yang; Zhang, Xiangru; Li, Yu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nChlorine/chloramine residuals are maintained in drinking water distribution systems to prevent microbial contamination and microorganism regrowth. During household cooking processes (e.g., soup making), the residual chlorine/chloramines in tap water may react with the iodide in iodized table salt to form hypoiodous acid, which could react with remaining natural organic matter in tap water and organic matter in food to generate iodinated disinfection byproducts (I-DBPs). However, I-DBPs formed during cooking with chloraminated/chlorinated tap water are almost completely new to researchers. In this work, by adopting precursor ion scan of m/z 127 using ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, many new polar I-DBPs formed during cooking with chloraminated/chlorinated tap water were detected and proposed with structures, of which 3-iodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3-iodo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-iodo-4-hydroxy-5-methylbenzoic acid, diiodoacetic acid, 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, 3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol, 2,4-diiodo-6-nitrophenol, and 2,4,6-triiodophenol were confirmed with standard compounds. With the aid of ultra fast liquid chromatography/ion trap-time of flight-mass spectrometry, molecular formula identification of five new I-DBPs (C8H5O4I, C7H4NO4I, C8H5O5I, C7H4NO5I, and C8H6O3I2) was achieved. A developmental toxicity with a recently developed sensitive bioassay was conducted for the newly identified I-DBPs, suggesting that phenolic I-DBPs (except for iodinated carboxyphenols) were about 50-200 times more developmentally toxic than aliphatic I-DBPs. The major I-DBPs in a baseline simulated cooking water sample were determined to be from 0.72 to 7.63Â Î¼g/L. Polar I-DBPs formed under various disinfection and cooking conditions were compared, and suggestions for controlling their formation were provided. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Chlorination is widely used in disinfecting wastewater effluents owing to its low cost and high efficiency. During chlorination of saline wastewater effluents, iodide may be oxidized to hypoiodous acid, which may further react with effluent organic matter to form iodinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs). Iodinated DBPs show significantly higher toxicity than their brominated and chlorinated analogues and thus have been drawing increasing concerns. In this study, polar iodinated DBPs were detected in chlorinated saline wastewater effluents using a novel precursor ion scan method. The major polar iodinated DBPs were identified and quantified, and their organic precursors and formation pathways were investigated. The formation of iodinated DBPs under different chlorine doses and contact times was also studied. The results indicated that a few polar iodinated DBPs were generated in the chlorinated saline primary effluent, but few were generated in the chlorinated saline secondary effluent. Several major polar iodinated DBPs in the chlorinated saline primary effluent were proposed with structures, among which a new group of polar iodinated DBPs, iodo-trihydroxybenzenesulfonic acids, were identified and quantified. The organic precursors of this new group of DBPs were found to be 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene, and the formation pathways of these new DBPs were tentatively proposed. Both chlorine dose and contact time affected the formation of iodinated DBPs in the chlorinated saline wastewater effluents.\n\nEvaluation of Electrochemically Generated Potable Water Disinfectants for Use on the International Space Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVega, Leticia; Aber, Gregory; Adam, Niklas; Clements, Anna; Modica, Catherine; Younker, Diane\n\n2011-01-01\n\nMicrobial contamination and subsequent growth in spacecraft water systems are constant concerns for missions involving human crews. The current potable water disinfectant is iodine; however, with the end of the Space Shuttle program, there is a need to develop redundant biocide systems which are less dependent on hardware that would need to be launched on a regular basis. Three systems for electrochemical production of potable water disinfectants are being assessed for use on the International Space Station (ISS). Since there is a wide variability in the literature with regards to efficacy in both concentration and exposure time of these disinfectants, there is a need to establish baseline efficacy values. This paper describes a series of tests performed in order to establish optimal concentrations and exposure times for four disinfectants against single and mixed species planktonic and biofilm bacteria and to determine whether these electrochemical disinfection devices are able to produce a sufficient amount of chemical in both concentration and volume to act as a biocide for potable water on ISS.\n\nEvaluation of Electrochemically Generated Potable Water Disinfectants for Use on the International Space Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRodriquez, Branelle; Anderson, Molly; Adams, Niklas; Vega, Leticia; Botkin, Douglas\n\n2013-01-01\n\nMicrobial contamination and subsequent growth in spacecraft water systems are constant concerns for missions involving human crews.

A laboratory study has been conducted to determine if there would be any interaction between the Viton A material and the iodine used to disinfect the water. Coupons of Viton A were exposed for 24 hours to aqueous iodine solutions similar in quality to the Shuttle's potable water. Changes in the iodine residual were monitored to determine the rate of iodine sorption by the coupon. Total organic carbon (TOC) was monitored to determine the rate of desorption of organic materials from the Viton A. The same coupons were then soaked in reagent-grade water for 24 hours, and iodine was monitored to determine the rate of iodine desorption. The coupons were again exposed to iodine solutions for 24 hours and iodine and TOC were monitored. No significant change in the iodine sorption rate was detected between the first and second exposures. A triangle taste test indicated at a 1 percent confidence level that the water exposed to Viton A had a different taste which was less acceptable to the panelists.\n\nThyroid function changes related to use of iodinated water in the U.S. Space Program.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcMonigal, K A; Braverman, L E; Dunn, J T; Stanbury, J B; Wear, M L; Hamm, P B; Sauer, R L; Billica, R D; Pool, S L\n\n2000-11-01\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has used iodination as a method of microbial disinfection of potable water systems in U.S. spacecraft and long-duration habitability modules. A review of thyroid function tests of NASA astronauts who had consumed iodinated water during spaceflight was conducted. Thyroid function tests of all past and present astronauts were reviewed. Medical records of astronauts with a diagnosis of thyroid disease were reviewed. Iodine consumption by space crews from water and food was determined. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and urinary iodine excretion from space crews were measured following modification of the Space Shuttle potable water system to remove most of the iodine. Mean TSH significantly increased in 134 astronauts who had consumed iodinated water during spaceflight. Serum TSH, and urine iodine levels of Space Shuttle crewmembers who flew following modification of the potable water supply system to remove iodine did not show a statistically significant change. There was no evidence supporting association between clinical thyroid disease and the number of spaceflights, amount of iodine consumed, or duration of iodine exposure. It is suggested that pharmacological doses of iodine consumed by astronauts transiently decrease thyroid function, as reflected by elevated serum TSH values. Although adverse effects of excess iodine consumption in susceptible individuals are well documented, exposure to high doses of iodine during spaceflight did not result in a statistically significant increase in long-term thyroid disease in the astronaut population.\n\nDevelopment of an iodine generator for reclaimed water purification in manned spacecraft applications\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWynveen, R.

The IGDS was sized to iodinate the drinking water nominally consumed by six men, 4.5 to 13.6 kg (10 to 30 lb) water per man-day with a + or - 10 to 20% variation with iodine (I2) levels of 0.5 to 20 parts per million (ppm). The I2 treats reclaimed water to prevent or eliminate microorganism contamination. Treatment is maintained with a residual of I2 within the manned spacecraft water supply. A simplified version of the chlorogen water disinfection concept, developed by life systems for on-site generation of chlorine (Cl2), was used as a basis for IGDS development. Potable water contaminated with abundant E. Coliform Group organisms was treated by electrolytically generated I2 at levels of 5 to 10 ppm. In all instances, the E. coli were eliminated.\n\nEvaluation of Electrochemically Generated Potable Water Disinfectants for Use on the International Space Station\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nRodriquez, Branelle; Anderson, Molly; Anderson, Molly; Adam, Niklas; Vega, Leticia; Modica, Catherine; Bodkin, Douglas\n\n2012-01-01\n\nMicrobial contamination and subsequent growth in spacecraft water systems are constant concerns for missions involving human crews.

In the experimental part, the time dependence of the application of the chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite on the formation of some by-products of disinfection for drinking water from WTP HriÅovÃ¡ is studied. We monitored trihalomethanes, free chlorine, chlorine dioxide and chlorites.\n\nEfficacy of peracetic acid in rapid disinfection of Resilon and gutta-percha cones compared with sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and povidone-iodine.\n\nPubMed\n\nSubha, N; Prabhakar, V; Koshy, Minu; Abinaya, K; Prabu, M; Thangavelu, Lavanya\n\n2013-10-01\n\nThe aim of this investigation was to compare the effectiveness of 3% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2% chlorhexidine, 1% peracetic acid, and 10% povidone-iodine in the rapid disinfection of Resilon (Pentron Clinical Technologies, LLC, Wallingford, CT) and gutta-percha cones contaminated with Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis. Two hundred fifty-six samples consisting of 128 gutta-percha cones and 128 Resilon cones were used in this study. The materials were tested for disinfection according to the type of solution (3% NaOCl, 2% chlorhexidine, 1% peracetic acid, or 10% povidone-iodine), the time of exposure to each solution (1 or 5 minutes), and the type of microorganisms (E. faecalis or B. subtilis). Subsequent to the disinfection, samples were placed in test tubes containing 10 mL Mueller-Hinton broth and incubated at 37Â°C for 7 days. All test tubes were observed at 24-hour intervals and visually checked for turbidity, signifying microbial growth. In this study, 1% peracetic acid showed the best results for both 1 minute and 5 minutes of disinfection, 2% chlorhexidine showed the second best results although it was statistically at par with peracetic acid, and 3% hypochlorite ranked third in disinfection; this was statistically significant when compared with peracetic acid and chlorhexidine. Disinfection by povidone-iodine was the least within all the groups for both contact times although disinfection for 5 minutes showed better results than disinfection for 1 minute for gutta-percha. The outcome of this study confirmed the efficacy of 1% peracetic acid and 2% chlorhexidine in the rapid disinfection of both Resilon and gutta-percha.

Solid-phase microextraction presents a simple, rapid, sensitive, and solvent-free approach to sample preparation in which analytes in either air or water matrixes are extracted into the polymeric coating of an optical fiber. Analytes are subsequently thermally desorbed in the injection port of a gas chromatograph for separation, detection, and quantitation. Thermal degradation of iodoform was observed during desorption from a polyacrylate fiber in initial GC/MS and GC/ECD experiments. Experiments were designed to determine SPME conditions that would allow quantification without significant degradation of analytes. Isothermal and temperature-programmed thermal desorptions were evaluated for efficacy in transferring analytes with wide-ranging volatilities and thermal stabilities into chromatographic analysis columns. A temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (120-200 degrees C at 5 degrees C/min with an on-column injection port or 150-200 degrees C at 25 degrees C/min with a split/splitless injection port) was able to efficiently remove analytes with wide-ranging volatilities without causing thermal degradation. The SPME-TPD method was linear over 2-3 orders of magnitude with an electron capture detector and detection limits were in the submicrogram per liter range. Precision and detection limits for selected trihalomethanes were comparable to those of EPA method 551. Extraction efficiencies were not affected by the presence of 10 mg/L soap, 15 mg/L sodium iodide, and 6000 mg/L sodium thiosulfate. The SPME-TPD technique was applied to the determination of iodination disinfection byproducts from individual precursor compounds using GC/MS and to the quantitation of iodoform at trace levels in a water recycle system using GC/ECD.\n\nHealth effects of drinking water disinfectants and disinfection by-products\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nCondie, L.W.; Bercz, J.P.\n\nThis paper summarizes toxicological studies conducted with drinking water disinfectants. Toxicological effects, which are associated with the disinfectants themselves as well as with the by-products formed when disinfectants react with organic material present in water, are considered.

L.; Pyle, B. H.; Sauer, R. L.; McFeters, G. A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nThe susceptibility of Legionella pneumophila to iodination was studied with cultures grown in well water, on rich agar media, and attached to stainless-steel surfaces. Legionella pneumophila grown in water cultures in association with other microorganisms were less sensitive to disinfection by chlorine and iodine than were agar-passaged cultures. Differences in sensitivity to disinfection between water-cultured and agar-grown legionellae were determined by comparing C x T values (concentration in milligrams per litre multiplied by time in minutes to achieve 99% decrease in viability) and CM x T values (concentration in molarity). Iodine (1500x) gave a greater difference in CM x T values than did chlorine (68x). Iodine was 50 times more effective than chlorine when used with agar-grown cultures but was only twice as effective when tested against water-grown Legionella cultures. C x T x S values (C x T multiplied by percent survivors), which take into consideration the percent surviving bacteria, were used to compare sensitivities in very resistant populations, such as those in biofilms. Water cultures of legionellae associated with stainless-steel surfaces were 135 times more resistant to iodination than were unattached legionellae, and they were 210,000 times more resistant than were agar-grown cultures. These results indicate that the conditions under which legionellae are grown can dramatically affect their susceptibility to some disinfectants and must be considered when evaluating the efficacy of a disinfecting agent.\n\nTransformation among Aromatic Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in the Presence of Monochloramine: From Monoiodophenol to Triiodophenol and Diiodonitrophenol.\n\nPubMed\n\nGong, Tingting; Tao, Yuxian; Zhang, Xiangru; Hu, Shaoyang; Yin, Jinbao; Xian, Qiming; Ma, Jian; Xu, Bin\n\n2017-09-19\n\nAromatic iodinated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) are a newly identified category of highly toxic DBPs. Among the identified aromatic iodinated DBPs, 2,4,6-triiodophenol and 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol have shown relatively widespread occurrence and high toxicity. In this study, we found that 4-iodophenol underwent transformation to form 2,4,6-triiodophenol and 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol in the presence of monochloramine. The transformation pathways were investigated, the decomposition kinetics of 4-iodophenol and the formation of 2,4,6-triiodophenol and 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol were studied, the factors affecting the transformation were examined, the toxicity change during the transformation was evaluated, and the occurrence of the proposed transformation pathways during chloramination of source water was verified. The results revealed that 2,4,6-triiodophenol and 2,6-diiodo-4-nitrophenol, which could account for 71.0% of iodine in the transformed 4-iodophenol, were important iodinated transformation products of 4-iodophenol in the presence of monochloramine. The transformation pathways of 4-iodophenol in the presence of monochloramine were proposed and verified. The decomposition of 4-iodophenol in the presence of monochloramine followed a pseudo-second-order decay. Various factors including monochloramine dose, pH, temperature, nitrite concentration, and free chlorine contact time (before chloramination) affected the transformation. The cytotoxicity of the chloraminated 4-iodophenol samples increased continuously with contact time. The proposed transformation pathways occurred during chloramination of source water.\n\nDISINFECTION OF NEW WATER MAINS\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe 'AWWA Standard for Disinfecting Water Mains' (AWWA C601-68) has fallen into disuse by a number of water utilities because of repeated bacteriological failures following initial disinfection with the recommended high-dose chlorination.

For these long duration missions, there is interest in replacing the iodine water treatment system with ionic silver, a proven biocide. For long duration exploration missions, it is imperative that an effective biocide be used that prevents microbial growth, biofilm formation, and microbially induced corrosion in the water storage and distribution systems while minimizing logistical supply requirements associated with the biocide delivery system. Two biocide delivery systems have been developed that electrochemically produce silver ions for disinfecting water throughout the water storage and distribution system. One system uses a newly developed hybrid micro-filtration and ion-exchange membrane to produce an abundance of silver ions at the 1000 ppb level upstream in the water distribution system to prevent biofilm growth. This is followed by a downstream collection module that electrochemically removes these silver ions before the water is discharged. Another approach uses a membraneless reactor to produce a 1000 ppb silver ion concentration level that also has a mechanically driven electrode cleaning mechanism that removes oxide films ensuring long life operation. By maintaining a sufficiently high level of silver ions throughout the water storage and distribution system, biofilm formation is suppressed. This approach overcomes present concerns where spurious silver deposition occurs on the container and flow line surfaces thus lowering the silver ion concentration to unsatisfactory disinfection levels.\n\nIodine generator for reclaimed water purification\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nWynveen, R. A.; Powell, J. D.; Schubert, F. H. (Inventor)\n\n1977-01-01\n\nThe system disclosed is for controlling the iodine level in a water supply in a spacecraft. It includes an iodine accumulator which stores crystalline iodine, an electrochemical valve to control the input of iodine to the drinking water and an iodine dispenser. A pump dispenses fluid through the iodine dispenser and an iodine sensor to a potable water tank storage. The iodine sensor electronically detects the iodine level in the water, and through electronic means, produces a correction current control. The correction current control operates the electro-chemical iodine valve to release iodine from the iodine accumulator into the iodine dispenser.\n\nEfficacy of a high free iodine barrier teat disinfectant for the prevention of naturally occurring new intramammary infections and clinical mastitis in dairy cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartins, C M M R; Pinheiro, E S C; Gentilini, M; Benavides, M Lopez; Santos, M V\n\n2017-05-01\n\nUsing a natural exposure trial design, the goal of our study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of an iodine teat disinfectant with barrier properties and a high level of free iodine relative to a conventional iodine teat disinfectant with no barrier properties and low levels of free iodine. During the 18 wk of the trial, quarter milk samples were collected every 2 wk from 385 dairy cows from 2 herds. Cows on both farms were assigned in a balanced way according to milk yield, number of lactation, days in milk, somatic cell count (SCC) and microbiology culture pretrial into one of following groups: nonbarrier post milking teat disinfectant (NBAR; n = 195 cows; 747 quarters) or barrier postmilking teat disinfectant (BAR; n = 190 cows; 728 quarters). Afterward, at each scoring date every 2 wk, milk SCC was quantified in samples from all mammary quarters and microbiologic culture was only performed on milk samples with SCC >200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and SCC >100,000 cells/mL for primiparous cows. A new intramammary infection (NIMI) was defined when a quarter had milk SCC <200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and <100,000 cells/mL for primiparous without microorganism isolation, and in a subsequent sampling visit had milk SCC >200,000 cells/mL for multiparous cows and >100,000 cells/mL for primiparous cows, and positive microorganism isolation. A quarter could have several NIMI, but only 1 case per specific pathogen was considered. The most frequently isolated microorganism group on both farms was Streptococcus spp. (6.25% of total mammary quarters), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (3.6%) and Corynebacterium spp. (1.5%). In the present study, an interaction occurred between treatment and week of trial on the incidence risk of NIMI. Quarters disinfected with BAR had 54 and 37% lower odds of NIMI than quarters disinfected with NBAR at 8 and 16 wk of the trial, respectively; whereas at other weeks of the study both products had similar\n\nEnhanced formation of disinfection byproducts in shale gas wastewater-impacted drinking water supplies.\n\nPubMed\n\nParker, Kimberly M; Zeng, Teng; Harkness, Jennifer; Vengosh, Avner; Mitch, William A\n\n2014-10-07\n\nThe disposal and leaks of hydraulic fracturing wastewater (HFW) to the environment pose human health risks. Since HFW is typically characterized by elevated salinity, concerns have been raised whether the high bromide and iodide in HFW may promote the formation of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) and alter their speciation to more toxic brominated and iodinated analogues. This study evaluated the minimum volume percentage of two Marcellus Shale and one Fayetteville Shale HFWs diluted by fresh water collected from the Ohio and Allegheny Rivers that would generate and/or alter the formation and speciation of DBPs following chlorination, chloramination, and ozonation treatments of the blended solutions. During chlorination, dilutions as low as 0.01% HFW altered the speciation toward formation of brominated and iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs) and brominated haloacetonitriles (HANs), and dilutions as low as 0.03% increased the overall formation of both compound classes. The increase in bromide concentration associated with 0.01-0.03% contribution of Marcellus HFW (a range of 70-200 Î¼g/L for HFW with bromide = 600 mg/L) mimics the increased bromide levels observed in western Pennsylvanian surface waters following the Marcellus Shale gas production boom. Chloramination reduced HAN and regulated THM formation; however, iodinated trihalomethane formation was observed at lower pH. For municipal wastewater-impacted river water, the presence of 0.1% HFW increased the formation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) during chloramination, particularly for the high iodide (54 ppm) Fayetteville Shale HFW. Finally, ozonation of 0.01-0.03% HFW-impacted river water resulted in significant increases in bromate formation. The results suggest that total elimination of HFW discharge and/or installation of halide-specific removal techniques in centralized brine treatment facilities may be a better strategy to mitigate impacts on downstream drinking water treatment plants than altering\n\nZebrafish Embryo Disinfection with PovidoneâIodine: Evaluating an Alternative to Chlorine Bleach\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAmack, Jeffrey D.; Whipps, Christopher M.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAbstract Mycobacteriosis is a common bacterial infection in laboratory zebrafish caused by several different species and strains of Mycobacterium, including both rapid and slow growers. One control measure used to prevent mycobacterial spread within and between facilities is surface disinfection of eggs. Recent studies have highlighted the effectiveness of povidoneâiodine (PVPI) on preventing propagation of Mycobacterium spp. found in zebrafish colonies. We evaluated the effect of disinfection using 12.5â50âppm PVPI (unbuffered and buffered) on zebrafish exposed at 6 or 24âh postfertilization (hpf) to determine if this treatment is suitable for use in research zebrafish. Our results show that 6âhpf embryos are less sensitive to treatment as fewer effects on mortality, developmental delay, and deformity were observed. We also found that buffered PVPI treatment results in a greater knockdown of Mycobacterium chelonae and Mycobacterium marinum, as well as results in decreased harmful effects on embryos. Treatments of shorter (2âmin vs. 5âmin) duration were also more effective at killing mycobacteria in addition to resulting in fewer effects on embryo health. In addition, we compared the efficacy of a rinsing regimen to rinsing and disinfecting. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend disinfecting embryos for 2âmin with buffered PVPI at 12.5â25âppm.

A.\n\n1992-01-01\n\nAlternatives to chlorination of water have been sought for reasons which include trihalomethane formation, possible bacterial regrowth, the high concentrations of chlorine required in certain circumstances, and the taste, odour and bodily irritation in chlorine-treated water. Electrolytically generated Cu and Ag ions at low levels, in addition to very low chlorine concentrations, have been suggested as an alternative to routine chlorination. We have examined the combination of Cu and Ag ions with low levels of iodine. Pseudomonas cepacia was grown either in rich medium or under nutrient restriction prior to disinfection. Survival of the organism and its ability to regrow after treatment as well as the effects of varying buffers, metal ion and iodine concentrations were determined. Low concentrations of metal ions (100 ppb Cu and 11 ppb Ag) and iodine (200 ppb) were more effective than either metal ions or iodine alone against Ps. cepacia grown on rich agar or in low nutrient buffer. After iodination, buffer-grown suspensions recovered to their original cell concentrations within 7 d. When Cu and Ag ions were used with or without iodine, regrowth was prevented. The results show that low concentrations of Cu and Ag in combination with iodine permit effective disinfection of bacteria after cultivation on either rich media or under nutrient restriction. These results, along with published data, suggest that the combination of these metals with halogenation may have applications in the disinfection of both recreational and potable water.\n\nDisinfection susceptibility of waterborne pseudomonads and Legionellae under simulated space vehicle conditions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMcfeters, Gordon A.; Pyle, Barry H.; Watters, Shelley K.; Cargill, Kari L.; Yu, Feipeng P.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe sensitivity of waterborne bacteria from iodinated systems to iodine is examined with particular attention to the recovery of the organisms. The use of iodine as a disinfectant for space-vehicle water is described, and references are made to studies of iodine sensitivity and the relationship between growth rate and iodine sensitivity. Growth following iodination is discussed, and bacterial responses to nutrient restriction are examined for both P aeruginosa and Legionella pneumophila. The low level of organic nutrients in spacecraft water allows the selection for bacteria that are less sensitive to halogens. The formation of biofilms within the water-treatment system enhances bacterial resistance to iodine, and in the case of high-quality water it is shown that sublethal doses of iodine can stimulate bacterial growth. Water treatment should therefore be based on antecedent growth conditions, nutrient limitation, biofilm formation, and ambient selective pressures.\n\nAntimicrobial efficacy of a novel povidone iodine contact lens disinfection system.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamasaki, Katsuhide; Saito, Fumio; Ota, Ritsue; Kilvington, Simon\n\n2018-06-01\n\nContact lens (CL) wear is a risk factor for the acquisition of microbial keratitis. Accordingly, compliance to manufacturers' recommended hygiene and disinfection procedures are vital to safe (CL) use. In this study we evaluated a novel povidone-iodine (PI) (CL) disinfection system (cleadew, Ophtecs Corporation, Japan) against a range of bacterial, fungal and Acanthamoeba. Antimicrobial assays were conducted according to ISO 14729 using the recommended strains of bacteria and fungi, with and without the presence of organic soil. Regrowth of bacteria and fungi in the disinfection system was also examined. The activity on biofilms formed from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter sp. was evaluated. Efficacy against A. castellanii trophozoites and cysts was also investigated. The PI system gave >4 log 10 kill of all bacteria and fungi following the manufacturer's recommended disinfection and cleaning time of 4h, with or without the presence of organic soil. No regrowth of organisms was found after 14days in the neutralized solution. In the biofilm studies the system resulted in at least a 7 log 10 reduction in viability of bacteria. For Acanthamoeba, >3 log 10 kill of trophozoites and 1.1-2.8 log 10 kill for the cyst stage was obtained. The PI system effective against a variety of pathogenic microorganisms under a range of test conditions. Strict compliance to recommended CL hygiene procedures is essential for safe CL wear. The use of care systems such as PI, with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, may aid in the prevention of potentially sight threatening microbial keratitis. Copyright Â© 2017.

In the present study, we examined possible sites of iodine loss during the usual water purification process.Water samples from 6 sites during the technological process were taken and analyzed for iodine content. Under laboratory circumstances, prepared iodine in water solution has been used as a model to test the effect of the presence of chlorine. Samples from the purification sites revealed that in the presence of chlorine there is a progressive loss of iodine from the water. In the chlorine concentrations employed in the purification process, 24-h chlorine exposure eliminated more than 50% of iodine when the initial iodine concentration was 250 Î¼g/l or less. Iodine was completely eliminated if the starting concentration was 16 Î¼g/l.We conclude that chlorine used during water purification may be a major contributor to iodine deficiency in European communities.\n\nElectrochemical alternatives for drinking water disinfection.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartÃ­nez-Huitle, Carlos A; Brillas, Enric\n\n2008-01-01\n\nChlorination is the most common method worldwide for the disinfection of drinking water. However, the identification of potentially toxic products from this method has encouraged the development of alternative disinfection technologies. Among them, electrochemical disinfection has emerged as one of the more feasible alternatives to chlorination.

Iodinated THM (ITHM) may also form in disinfected with chlorine waters that are high in iodine content, but little is known about their magnitude and variability within the drinking-water pipe distribution network of urban areas. The main objective of this study was to determine the magnitude and variability of ITHM and TTHM levels and their corresponding daily intake estimates within the drinking water distribution systems of Limassol and Nicosia cities of Cyprus, using tap samples collected from individual households (n=37). In Limassol, mean household tap water ITHM and TTHM levels was 0.58 and 38 Î¼g L(-1), respectively. Dichloroiodomethane (DCIM) was the dominant species of the two measured ITHM compounds accounting for 77% of total ITHM and in the range of 0.032 and 1.65 Î¼g L(-1). The range of DCIM concentrations in Nicosia tap water samples was narrower (0.032 - 0.848 Î¼g L(-1)). Mean total iodine concentration in tap water samples from the seaside city of Limassol was 15 Î¼g L(-1) and approximately twice to those observed in samples from the mainland Nicosia city. However, iodine concentrations did not correlate with the ITHM levels. The calculated chronic daily intake rates of ITHM were low when compared with those of TTHM, but because of their widespread occurrence in tap water and their enhanced mammalian cell toxicity, additional research is warranted to assess the magnitude and variability of human ITHM exposures.

However, disinfection by-products (DBPs) are formed during water disinfection. Haloacetic acids (HAAs) and trihalomethanes (THMs) are two major groups of DBPs. Iodo-HAAs and iodo-THMs (I-HAAs and I-THMs) are formed during the disinfection of the water containing high levels of iodide and are much more toxic than their chlorinated and brominated analogs. Peracetic acid (PAA) is a strong antimicrobial disinfectant that is expected to reduce the formation of HAAs and THMs during disinfection. In this study, the formations of thirteen HAAs and ten THMs, including the iodinated forms, have been investigated during PAA disinfection and chlorination as the comparison. The DBP formations under different iodide concentrations, pHs, and contact times were systematically investigated. Two types of commercial PAAs containing different concentrations of PAA and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) were studied. A solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was upgraded for THM analysis including I-THMs. HAAs were analyzed by following a recently developed high performance ion chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results show that the ratio of PAA and H 2 O 2 concentration significantly affect the formation of I-THMs and I-HAAs. During PAA disinfection with lower PAA than H 2 O 2 , no detectable levels of THMs and HAAs were observed. During PAA disinfection with higher PAA than H 2 O 2 , low levels of monoiodoacetic acid, diiodoacetic acid, and iodoform were formed, and these levels were enhanced with the increase of iodide concentration. No significant quantities of chloro- or bromo-THMs and HAAs were formed during PAA disinfection treatment. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have identified emerging DBPs (e.g. iodinated trihalomethanes (THMs) and acids, haloacetonitriles, halonitromethanes (HNMs), haloacetaldehydes, nitrosamines) that may be more toxic than some of the regulated ones (e.g. chlorine- and bromine-containing THMs and haloacetic acids). Some of these emerging DBPs are associated with impaired drinking water supplies (e.g. impacted by treated wastewater, algae, iodide). In some cases, alternative primary or secondary disinfectants to chlorine (e.g. chloramines, chlorine dioxide, ozone, ultraviolet) that minimize the formation of some of the regulated DBPs may increase the formation of some of the emerging by-products. However, optimization of the various treatment processes and disinfection scenarios can allow plants to control to varying degrees the formation of regulated and emerging DBPs. For example, pre-disinfection with chlorine, chlorine dioxide or ozone can destroy precursors for N-nitrosodimethylamine, which is a chloramine by-product, whereas pre-oxidation with chlorine or ozone can oxidize iodide to iodate and minimize iodinated DBP formation during post-chloramination. Although pre-ozonation may increase the formation of trihaloacetaldehydes or selected HNMs during post-chlorination or chloramination, biofiltration may reduce the formation potential of these by-products.\n\nA comparison of genotoxicity change in reclaimed wastewater from different disinfection processes.\n\nPubMed\n\nChai, Qiwan; Hu, Allen; Qian, Yukun; Ao, Xiuwei; Liu, Wenjun; Yang, Hongwei; Xie, Yuefeng F\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEffluents before disinfection from four wastewater reclamation plants were treated with chlorine (Cl 2 ), ozone (O 3 ), chlorine dioxide (ClO 2 ), medium-pressure ultraviolet (MPUV) and four different combinations of the above, to evaluate the effect of disinfection processes on the genotoxicity removal by the SOS/umu test. Results showed that the genotoxicity increased after MPUV irradiation (10-100Â mJ/cm 2 ), but declined when adopting other disinfection processes. The effectiveness of genotoxicity reduction by five chemical disinfectants was identified as: O 3 Â >Â pre-ozonation with Cl 2 Â âÂ ClO 2 Â >Â combination of ClO 2 and Cl 2 Â >Â Cl 2 . The sequential combination of MPUV, Cl 2 and O 3 reduced the genotoxicity to a level similar to the source water. The influence of differential disinfection process varied on iodinated wastewater, which is closely related to the competitive reactions between disinfectants, iodine and dissolved organic matters. The removal of genotoxic pollutants and the formation of genotoxic disinfection by-products are the two major factors that lead to the change in genotoxicity during disinfection.
