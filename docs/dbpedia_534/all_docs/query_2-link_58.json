        "text": "What if QI Folio was just a Portfolio full of Quality Improvement ü§î It would look something like this. But there's a better way. If you have a folder that looks like this - QI Folio is just what you need to turn the corner and kick your quality program into full speed. ‚úå #behavioralhealth #qualityimprovement #mentalhealth\n\nQuality Improvement should be inclusive - and our pricing strategy at QI Folio supports that. Per user pricing models force human service agencies to ask the question \"is it worth incurring an additional per user per month fee, to bring this person into the software?\" Quality Improvement should be driven by process owners, which means front line staff should have a seat on the project teams. Which also means, they may use your project management software for one project - and then not again for a while. With QI Folio, whether it is PDSA projects, monitoring program indicators, executing against your agency strategic plan, or conducting chart audits and case record reviews, you'll never have to ask the question about adding another using to your pricing. QI Folio's pricing model is a per agency monthly fee for unlimited users, unlimited projects, unlimited chart audits, unlimited...well...everything :-) Join our demo on August 21st at 1pm Eastern to learn more. Register here: https://lnkd.in/euJ2RDKB #mentalhealth #behavioralhealth #qualityimprovement\n\nTell me if this sounds right... CEO: I need to show the Board of Directors one of our Quality Improvement projects. QI Professional: Sure! Look in the Quality Improvement folder and you can find everything you need for that project. CEO: What I really need is a summary of our project that I can print out. QI Professional: üôÑ ü§¨ *Sighs. Resigns to writing a term paper* Board of Directors reviews for 30 seconds and throws in garbage at the end of the meeting. Don't let this be you. QI Folio has a better way with SmartStory on demand project updates. #behavioralhealth #mentalhealth #qualityimprovement\n\nIf your on the quality team in health and human services, you likely manage an internal chart auditing process that looks at case records for completeness...but your likely looking too hard. It's critical when reviewing case records in this fashion to measure against your most common deficiencies - that's why at QI Folio our chart audit feature measures down to the individual question. But what about questions that consistently come up with no deficiencies time and time again? Take em off the form. Go ahead. It'll be ok. Make a new form to check them once a year, instead of once a quarter. Shift your focus away from items your process has covered and onto the ones that are struggling. You'll be a hero for making less work. I promise. #mentalhealth #behavioralhealth #qualityimprovement\n\nTell me if this sounds right - every time you lose your quality improvement director you burn your QI to the ground and start over? I have a better way. At the core of this is the hilarious irony that the people in charge of driving sustainable and effective process at the agency - often leave behind a cluster of disconnected workflows and domain knowledge that the next person just starts building it over again. There. I said it. It's true that this is partly a culture failure that didn't create knowledge transfer, and allowed silo's domain knowledge to flourish, and software isn't the answer to everything, but it can give you a place to rally around during transitions. See - with QI Folio the quality improvement activities of the agency are all living in one place - providing incredible transparency. When a QI Folio client has turnover in quality leadership - the next hire has one place to go to get brought up to speed - and picking up the software means picking up the agency QI program. Not bad, eh? #qualityimprovement #behavioralhealth #mentalhealth\n\nAn accreditation application is like a long list of promises...so, are you living up to them? When it comes to the quality improvement section of an accreditation app - you're gonna make promises like having data, reviewing data, running improvement projects, connecting those projects to the agency strategic plan, and auditing charts. It's a lot. That's why QI Folio is brining all of these operations into one place - so you can fulfill your promises. #behavioralhealth #qualityimprovement #mentalhealth\n\nSitting down to review and talk about data every quarter, with every program in your agency is exhausting. It's also the right thing to do. The best time to review data is roughly 15 days after the end of the quarter so you have time to catch up the data, but no more than 30 days after the end of the quarter so the data isn't getting old and stale. If your quality improvement team supports a large number of programs, this doesn't become less true. Just harder. At the end of each quarter, facilitating review and conversations around all of your data is hard. But it's good - if uncomfortable. The other months you spend in the lab mixing solutions. Today is 16 days after the end of Q2 - how many data reviews do you have scheduled for the next 15 days? #qualityimprovement #behavioralhealth #mentalhealth"
