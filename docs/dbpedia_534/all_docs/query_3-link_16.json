        "text": "Village vs Town\n\nMost people live in villages and towns. Although some may opt to live in cities and other urban areas, there are still a lot of people who prefer the peace and quiet of rural living. Villages and towns are not as densely populated, not as polluted, and certainly not as fast-paced as cities.\n\nWhile they are both located in rural areas and while they both have a fresher and cleaner environment, villages and towns have several differences that makes them distinct from each other. One would be their land areas. Villages have smaller land areas than towns since towns are actually villages that have expanded or extended annexing nearby villages.\n\nAnd because they have a larger land area than villages, it follows that towns have larger populations than villages. Inhabitants of towns have more access to the town market and shops, the fire and police stations, entertainment facilities, and the local seat of government.\n\nA village does not have a mayor nor does it have local laws since it is a part of a town and is, therefore, governed by the town officials. It has a simpler system of utilities and is sometimes lacking in transportation facilities and other important services. There are also more employment opportunities in towns with a variety of choices unlike in villages wherein if one does not have a profession like a doctor or a teacher, he is most likely a farmer or a fisherman.\n\nSchools that offer higher education are also usually located in towns and cities rather than in villages. Villages only offer up to secondary school while towns can have colleges. Public libraries and hospitals are also located in towns.\n\nEconomic activity is also one distinction between a town and a village. Banks and other commercial establishments are located in towns making it more economically active and providing its inhabitants with better opportunities.\n\nTowns are more urbanized than villages not relying on agriculture for its economy. But, of course, different countries have different concepts of what a town or a village is. Some may have villages that have larger areas and bigger populations than their towns while others may have villages located in their cities.\n\nSummary:\n\n1.A town is a human settlement that is larger than a village.\n\n2.A town is a distinct government entity while a village can be a part of a town or a separate settlement.\n\n3.A town has an established marketplace where people can buy their necessities while a village does not have a market.\n\n4.A town has a mayor and a seat of government while a village does not.\n\n5.Banks, stores, and other commercial establishments are located in towns rather than in villages.\n\n6.A town has a more complex economic and utilities system than a village.\n\n7.Inhabitants of a town are employed in a variety of jobs while inhabitants of a village usually rely on agriculture.\n\n8.A town has a larger and more diverse population than a village does.\n\nSharing is caring!"
