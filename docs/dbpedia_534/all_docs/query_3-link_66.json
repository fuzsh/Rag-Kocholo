        "text": "The Town and Village of Allegany, in Cattaraugus County, NY, are situated along the Allegheny River among the Enchanted Mountains of Western New York.\n\nThis setting is enhanced by the presence of St. Bonaventure University, a Franciscan Institution which is a first-class post-secondary educational opportunity which boasts a beautiful walking trail, a public 9-hole golf course with a clubhouse for dining, as well as Allegany-Limestone Public School which has one of the best ratings in the area. The Village with its newly renovated downtown area has a variety of restaurants and bars as well as stores for your shopping and local merchandise. Within the Town are several parks for play and picnicking.\n\nThe Allegheny River Valley Trail, which starts near St. Bonaventure University is an ideal place for walking, rollerblading, or biking. Next to Allegany, NY is the City of Olean which offers many of the amenities of a larger, metropolitan area. In addition, within 20 miles are Allegany State Park, the Seneca Allegany Resort & Casino in Salamanca, and the Ski & Golf Areas of Holiday Valley Resort in Ellicottville.\n\nThe Town, formed by the county in 1831, measures 71.7 square miles and contains 7,493 people as of the 2020 census. The Village was created when the people decided in 1906 that there was a need for extra services not provided by the Town. The Village measures approximately 0.7 square miles and contains 1,816 people as of the 2010 census.\n\nThe Town’s Government is made up of a Supervisor and 4 Board Members. The Town provides services such as the Recreation and Parks Department, the Senior Citizen’s Center, Dog Control, and the Assessor’s Department to all areas of the town, including the village. Other services such as the Highway Department, Town Courts, Planning, Code Enforcement, and water & sewer are provided only for people outside the Village. Taxes to support these Town services are assessed to all residents of the Town, but those residents within the Village pay a different rate than those outside the village.\n\nThe Village’s Government is made up of a Mayor and 4 Board of Trustees. The Village supports its own police force, streets department, planning and zoning ordinance, water & sewer department, and garbage pick up. Taxes to support these services are paid only by residents and businesses of the Village.\n\nThere is an independent fire district that services residents of both the Town and Village."
