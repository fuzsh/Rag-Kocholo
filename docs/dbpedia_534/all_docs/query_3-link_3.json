        "text": "City and town are often used interchangeably, as are town and village. However, there are several distinctions that make these 3 terms unique from one another.\n\nWhether you’re trying to describe the place you live or wondering what to call the fictional setting of your book, there’s a proper term for most settlements.\n\nLearn the difference between cities, towns, and villages below, and see examples to help you understand their distinctions.\n\nVillage Definition and Examples\n\nLet’s start with the smallest of the 3 terms. A village is a small community, or an incorporated minor municipality. It is smaller than a town and usually located in a rural area.\n\nExamples of villages:\n\nCollina, Friulli, Italy\n\nRiquewihr, Alsace, France\n\nCastle Combe, Wiltshire, England\n\nSaldanda, Nepal\n\nTown Definition and Examples\n\nTown defined by Merriam-Webster as “a compactly settled area usually larger than a village but smaller than a city.”\n\nThat sounds pretty vague, but it’s important to note that a town is distinguished by defined boundaries and a local government.\n\nKeep in mind that just as there are differences between British and American spelling, there are also slight cultural differences around the world regarding just what constitutes a town or village.\n\nHowever, you can find some common examples of towns below.\n\nExamples of towns:\n\nReading, England\n\nSkalica, Slovakia\n\nDavos, Switzerland\n\nFátima, Portugal\n\nÇeşme, Turkey\n\nCity Definition and Examples\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, a city is considered “an inhabited place of greater size, population, or importance than a town or village.” Therefore, to understand the scale of a city, you’ll have to understand how the first two on this list are characterized.\n\nIn American English, city is defined as a municipality with its own local government, while the British specify even further that it is “created by charter and usually contains a cathedral.”\n\nExamples of cities:\n\nRome, Italy\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nParis, France\n\nHonolulu, Hawaii\n\nAlbany, New York\n\nDescribe Your Setting\n\nDo you live in a city, village, or town? Which word best describes the places you read or write about?\n\nLearn the difference between these 3 terms so you can describe settings more accurately and with greater precision.\n\nDid you find this post helpful?
