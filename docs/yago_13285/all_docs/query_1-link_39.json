        "text": "EASTENDERS viewers believe they've cracked when Sonia Fowler will give birth.\n\nThe show regular - played by Natalie Cassidy - has been at the centre of a storyline which has seen her attempt to conceive through IVF.\n\nIn Monday's episode (July 22), Sonia shared her pregnancy worries with Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth), who encouraged her to take a test.\n\nWith Sonia's dreams set to come true, fans think they've figured out when the new Albert Square addition could make their arrival.\n\nThey noted the baby could make its first appearance during the BBC soap's landmark 40th anniversary in February next year - sparking a wave of dramatic storylines in the process.\n\nOne speculated: \"If my timings and theories are correct Sonia is scheduled to give birth on 40th week and Reiss has been a slow burning storyline that will reach climax at same time.\"\n\nAnother wrote: \"Sonia's baby better stick this time and she gives birth on her sofa with Mo at the 40th.\n\n\"I can't do ANOTHER round of Sonia complaining about her uterus and ovum #EastEnders.\"\n\nA third penned: \"40th anniversary theory: think Sonia could give birth and the implant will take next month (9 months till Feb 2025). Mo will deliver the kid, Denise will ring an ambulance like she did for Kim in 2015 as 2 throwbacks?? #EastEnders\".\n\nIn the build-up to the important celebration, characters such as Jane Beale (Laurie Brett), Yolande Trueman (Angela Wynter) and Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo) have made returns.\n\nMeanwhile, the imminent comeback of David Wicks (Michael French) has also been unveiled.\n\nConsistent viewers will remember Sonia, who already has daughter Bex, had previously believed she was pregnant earlier this year.\n\nHowever, heartbreaking scenes revealed the character had actually experienced a blighted ovum and wasn't expecting after all.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonia's partner Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) has gone to desperate lengths to fund her treatment and resolve financial woes.\n\nThis has included using his comatose wife Debbie's money.\n\nViewers have seen Reiss - the great-nephew of iconic Dot Cotton - become engulfed in debt.\n\nHaving already attempted to con Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace), Reiss' latest target is Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean).\n\nHis manipulative scheme sees him tell Sharon she has an outstanding VAT receipt needing to be paid - which is a complete fabrication.\n\nWill Sonia and Sharon learn of Reiss' deception before its too late?"
