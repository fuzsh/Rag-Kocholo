        "text": "This article contains spoilers for Thursday’s (June 6) EastEnders, which has not yet aired on TV but is available to watch now on BBC iPlayer.\n\nSonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) was left absolutely destroyed in recent EastEnders scenes after getting devastating news from the hospital.\n\nSonia and partner Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) have been on a tough IVF journey in recent months, after Sonia learnt that Reiss couldn’t naturally conceive.\n\nThough they had previously been left disappointed, Sonia was left thrilled earlier this year to discover that she was pregnant.\n\nMade up by the news, Reiss has gone out of his way to try and look after Sonia, sometimes leaving her frustrated by his overbearing nature.\n\nMore recently, the arrival of Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) has caused chaos, with Reiss and Bianca clashing at almost every opportunity.\n\nWhen Bianca told Reiss he would be a bad dad in a recent row, it was the final straw for him, and he immediately demanded that Sonia ask Bianca to move out.\n\nHowever, when the time came, Sonia could see how much Bianca was struggling, and ended up being unable to tell her.\n\nInstead, Reiss took it upon himself to break the news and, as expected, Bianca wasn’t best pleased.\n\nThe pair were quick to rush home to include Sonia in the row, but were left horrified when they found her bleeding.\n\nAfter rushing to the hospital, the trio waited anxiously for news that would leave them crushed.\n\nAfter a scan, the doctor explained that Sonia had a blighted ovum, which meant that although the egg from her IVF treatment had attached to the lining of her uterus, it hadn’t developed into a foetus, meaning that there was no baby.\n\nBack at home, Bianca and Reiss supported Sonia as she broke down, revealing that she felt ‘stupid’ for crying over something she’d ‘never even had’, but admitting that she had started to love it.\n\nWill Reiss and Sonia ever get their happy ending?\n\nMORE : Bianca Jackson chilled to the bone as she uncovers a major secret in EastEnders\n\nMORE : Deal with the devil as unlikely local falls into Phil Mitchell’s murky world in EastEnders\n\nMORE : EastEnders confirms major death as legend is left in tears in 51 pictures"
