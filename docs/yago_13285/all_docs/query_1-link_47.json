She then had to prize another secret out of him when he revealed he was infertile but ever the fixer, Sonia suggested IVF.\n\nReiss lied AGAIN when he told Sonia he had money in savings to pay for the treatment but was in fact Reiss was siphoning the money from Debbie's account.\n\nSonia gave him the benefit of the doubt and promised they would find a way to make the money they needed.\n\nAfter making the huge decision to sell her house to fund her new life with Reiss, she confided in ex-husband Martin Fowler, along with uncle Jack Branning and cousin Lauren Branning.\n\nThe three were shocked that she was thinking of selling the Branning family home, although they tried to see Sonia's point of view.\n\nDecision made, Sonia cooks a romantic meal for Reiss so she can tell him her big news but she's shocked when she has a surprise visit from Martin and Lauren.\n\nSonia is devastated when the worried pair make it clear that they trust Reiss as far as they could throw him and Sonia shouldn't be throwing away everything she has to be with him.\n\nFurious, she throws them out of the house but now isolated from her family, are things going to end in more than tears?\n\nPenny Branning has not been getting the feels over running the departed Whitney Dean's clothing stall in the market.\n\nAfter a run-in with Ravi Gulati over his daughter Avani Nandra=Hart, who stole something, she's realised she's not cut out to be a market trader!\n\nPenny is used to a much more glamorous life after growing up in Paris and when she discovers that Chelsea Fox is about to lose her job as manager of local club, Peggy's, her mind was set whirring.\n\nShe quickly made overtures to boss Phil Mitchell about taking Chelsea's place and he gave her the job!\n\nPoor Chelsea is devastated that Phil has fired her for downing a glass of wine while at work.\n\nDesperate not to lose her job she begs Phil to give her one last chance but has Penny now got the upper hand?"
