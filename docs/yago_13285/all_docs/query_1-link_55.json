        "text": "EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy's character Sonia might be a favourite of thousands of soap fans but there's one person closer to home who isn't so interested in her storylines!\n\nNatalie has played Sonia Fowler on the show since 1993, when she was just ten-years-old, but she's now revealed that her own seven-year-old child isn't impressed by her character.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe mum-of-two poked fun at herself as she made the humbling admission that her daughter Joanie avoids watching her on TV.\n\nNatalie explained her daughter's feelings on seeing her character in Albert Square to The Mirror. 'She’ll go, \"Mummy… Sonia’s so boring. I just don’t like watching you on here, honestly I just don’t like it.\"'\n\nShe added: 'I say, \"I’ve been there a long time darling, there’s a lot of people who do like me\"'. Natalie added that Joanie then hilariously informs her 'well, I’m not one of them.'\n\nOuch, we can always count on our children to humble us!\n\nNatalie shares Joanie with her fiancé Marc Humphreys. She also has an older daughter, 12-year-old Eliza, from a previous relationship with ex-fiancé Adam Cottrell.\n\nSonia has seen many ups and downs throughout her past three decades on EastEnders. She has seen teenage pregnancy, love affairs, a cancer scare, and most recently, a difficult pregnancy.\n\nShe remains a firm fixture on the show, despite recently revealing that she often fears that her character's time on the show will come to an end soon.\n\n'One day, you know, I'm sure Sonia will end,' she admitted on Sophie is-Bextor's Spinning Plates podcast. 'I don't know when, hopefully she will potter about being a nurse for a bit longer.\n\n'I don't want her to die a terrible death, I don't want her to get run over or pushed in Walford train station.'\n\nThis news may be music to Joanie's ears!"
