This is the official Kickstarter backer’s list in alphabetical order along with the names of those who have donated through PayPal! I spent several hours going through the gathered information, and have done my best to get every name included and spelled correctly — or at least to match the way they were entered (with the notable exception of “Kyle Darkraven19 Cassidy, the 16th Earle of Blequichly Wallo,” for which I had to apply my ‘superfluous-title-reduction’ macro so it would actually fit)!\n\nHaving said that, I am sure there are still the inevitable mistakes/omissions, so I’m going to apologize right now and assure you that it wasn’t for lack of trying! Please don’t be upset — just send me a pleasant email describing my goof-up, and I’ll cheerfully get things fixed … agreed? Now, go on and take a look at just how many certifiably wonderful people there are in the world:"
