        "text": "EASTENDERS’ Sonia Fowler has made a huge decision about her future.\n\nThe nurse - who is played by actress Natalie Cassidy in the BBC soap - had thought she was pregnant earlier this week but it was a false alarm.\n\nIt sent her relationship with Reiss into a tailspin with him revealing he’s infertile and convinced Sonia cheated on him.\n\nAfter a brutal back and forth Reiss admitted he did want children and asked Sonia to try IVF with him - a move she shut down.\n\nUntil that it tonight when she changed her mind.\n\nShe told him: “I sometimes see other mums and I wonder what it’s like to know you’re pregnant and plan the birth and all that.\n\n“And then take that one little baby home to look after…”\n\nWith Reiss insisting that they would be OK as they were, Sonia decided that it was enough.\n\n“Maybe that’s exactly the right place to start?” she said.\n\n“I know I’ve said we haven’t been together for long. But we’ve been through a lot, haven’t we? And we’ve got through it.\n\n“We’re strong you and me. I never thought I’d ever feel this loved again. So loved that I want to have a baby with that person.\n\n“Let’s do it. I want us to have a family. And if it doesn’t work out then we’re enough.”\n\nFans are in shock at her plan.\n\nOne wrote: \"I'm not saying Sonia and Reiss are rushing things but do they even know each other's middle names yet?\"\n\nAnother cynical viewer said: \"I hope this ends with Sonia throwing Reiss out on his ear.\""
