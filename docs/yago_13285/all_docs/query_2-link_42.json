        "text": "In response, Janine had feigned that her pregnancy had taken a turn - but her friend Sonia (Natalie Cassidy) was aware of Janine’s lies and paranoia about Mick and Linda.\n\nWhile Mick neared the truth of Janine’s lies, Sonia covered for her but tried to calm Janine into being less paranoid and acting out.\n\nAfter supposedly returning from a scan with Sonia, Janine told Mick that the baby had had the all-clear from the medics.\n\nMore like this\n\nMick’s mother Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), however, continued to see through her prospective daughter-in-law’s lies, aware that Mick is only marrying her due to her pregnancy.\n\nAfter being called out by Shirley, Janine continued to spiral into a dark mood, making nasty comments about Mick and Linda’s relationship, her future and also about Sonia and her beloved step-grandmother, Dot Branning.\n\nIn the Vic, Janine asked Sonia: \"Is it living in her house that’s the problem?\"\n\nJanine then made clear her meaning by adding: \"That’s turning you into this dowdy little busy body like Dot?\"\n\nAs Sonia warned Janine off of comments about Dot, Janine mocked Dot’s failed marriages and also Sonia’s single life.\n\nLater, Sonia approached Janine outside in the Square and recalled how Janine used to wait for her cheating father Frank Butcher to come home and often he never did, blaming her relationship with her father for her attitude towards men now.\n\nAn unhinged Janine begins blaming Sonia for holding her back from her games with Mick, meaning she could lose the \"best\" thing she has ever had in her life - better than her daughter Scarlett Butcher (Tabitha Byron).\n\nIn the aftermath, Janine continues to unravel, prompting Sonia to make a mystery phone call.\n\n\"You’ve gotta get back here,\" Sonia tells the mystery person. \"I should’ve called you before. I thought I could help, but I can’t.\"\n\nShe added: \"Right, you wanna see the way she’s acting, the thing’s she’s saying.\"\n\nThe episode ended with a panicking Janine glaring at Sonia. What will Ms Butcher do next? And who has Sonia called to stop her?\n\nIn Thursday night's episodes, Linda prepares for her date with new love interest Karl, but with Mick still in his ex-wife's life, Janine's paranoia continues to grow, prompting Sonia to try and calm her down.\n\nAs the week's episodes draw to a close, Janine acts out to cement herself into Mick's life forever - but will she succeed?\n\nFans will be aware that actress Charlie Brooks is set to bow out as Janine Butcher on Boxing Day, while Danny Dyer will also depart his role as Mick Carter over the festive period.\n\nAhead of Janine's exit, fans can also look forward to the return of Janine's older brother Ricky Butcher, played by Sid Owen, who is back for a short stint on the soap.\n\nCould Ricky be the one to get through to Janine?\n\nRead more:\n\n6 EastEnders spoilers next week: Sonia hears devastating news about Dot\n\nEastEnders' \"moving\", potentially life-saving Lola story praised by Macmillan\n\nEastEnders to show heartbreaking scenes as Lexi learns Lola's diagnosis\n\nEastEnders cast: Who is joining, leaving and returning to the soap?\n\nEastEnders biggest reveals since Sharongate\n\nVisit our dedicated EastEnders page for all the latest news, interviews and spoilers.
