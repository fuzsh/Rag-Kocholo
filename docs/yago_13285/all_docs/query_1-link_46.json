        "text": "EastEnders legend Natalie Cassidy has candidly spoken out about the possibility of leaving.\n\nThe soap icon shot to fame playing Sonia Fowler on the long-running BBC One soap. Natalie made her debut way back in 1993 when she was just 10 years old.\n\nAnd since then, it’s fair to say she’s become a fan-favourite, and one of the soap’s most iconic characters. What’s more, Natalie has had her fair share of big storylines playing Sonia.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders legend 'to be killed off' after 34 years as 'gutted' fans say 'end of an era'\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nFrom teenage pregnancy to a cancer scare, her time in Walford has not been short of drama. Especially at the moment, as over in the square last week, Sonia was issued some devastating baby news.\n\nShe and partner Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) found out the heartbreaking news that Sonia wasn’t actually pregnant, amid their IVF struggles. And things are only set to get more dramatic this week\n\nHowever, despite being a soap legend, Natalie has revealed how fans assume her role is safe on the long-running soap. But according to the actress, that is not the case.\n\nCandidly speaking about her future on EastEnders, Natalie said: “One day, you know, I'm sure Sonia will end. I don't know when, hopefully she will potter about being a nurse for a bit longer.\"\n\nAnd it seems she has a request for soap bosses. Natalie added on Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Spinning Plates podcast: \"I don't want her to die a terrible death, I don't want her to get run over or pushed in Walford train station.\"\n\nWhen asked about how soap producers will often make dramatic changes to big characters, Natalie went on: “To be honest, it's got to evolve and characters have to come and go because otherwise it will be a very boring place.\n\n“You have different people come in with different ideas. Of course you’re upset if you lose a friend from somewhere but it’s the same with any job and moving on.”\n\nShe went on: “She added: ‘Genuinely, it’s not a joke, every contract that comes round for me in my head I think, ‘Oh, I’m going then.’ I have to think, ‘Oh I’m going to be leaving then’ because I could be gone, definitely gone.”"
