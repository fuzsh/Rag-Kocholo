The talent, the elegance of it all.”\n\nAnother EastEnders fan account added: “Long live Sonia and her trumpet!”\n\nSonia, played by Natalie Cassidy, first appeared in the soap in 1993, and started learning the instrument as a child.\n\nIt’s a shame that her performance only got a moment of screen time – but we’ll be keeping our eyes peeled for future trumpet appearances..."
