        "text": "EastEnders spoilers follow.\n\nEastEnders will explore a potential pregnancy storyline for Sonia Fowler next week, as the nurse begins to suspect that she might be expecting a baby.\n\nIn scenes airing next week on BBC One, Sonia realises that her period is late and, worried, she confides in Whitney Dean that it's possible she could be pregnant.\n\nThe timing is far from ideal, as Sonia is still dealing with the fallout from her discovery that partner Reiss Colwell is actually still married to wife Debbie, who lives in a care home due to being unresponsive following a stroke.\n\nRelated: EastEnders confirms character return details\n\nLater on, Reiss tries to set up a lunch date with Sonia as an apology for his previous insensitivity around Sonia's feelings towards Debbie.\n\nUnfortunately for Reiss, he accidentally puts his foot in it when he drunkenly starts sharing his negative views towards the prospect of children, completely unaware of Sonia's predicament.\n\nIs Sonia really pregnant - and if so, how will Reiss feel about the idea of becoming a father?\n\nRelated: EastEnders' Stacey tries to catch stalker Theo out\n\nThe couple have only recently got back together, after Sonia previously ended their romance when she discovered the truth about Reiss' secret marriage.\n\nWhen Reiss first arrived in Albert Square to attend his great-aunt Dot Branning's funeral last year, he immediately struck up a connection with Sonia, a development which actress Natalie Cassidy, who plays her, was delighted about.\n\n\"Having this shining beacon of light coming in, I feel like it's going to be a really exciting time,\" she told Digital Spy and other media at the time, adding that she was pleased to see \"the comedic side of Sonia come back and the light\".\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer.\n\nRead more EastEnders spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nYou Might Also Like"
