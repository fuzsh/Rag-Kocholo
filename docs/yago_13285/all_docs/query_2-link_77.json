        "text": "EastEnders' legend Patsy Palmer is set to make a dramatic return to Albert Square. The iconic actress will be reprising her role as Bianca Jackson in the BBC soap, shocking viewers with her unexpected comeback.\n\nBianca was last seen fleeing Walford in June after exposing Sonia Fowler's boyfriend Reiss for his strange behaviour and their theft of comatose Debbie's savings to fund their IVF treatment. Since her departure, Reiss has committed murder and spiralled out of control.\n\nBianca, who has been secretly battling depression, confided in Kat before leaving. Although Sonia has forgiven Bianca following Kat Slater's intervention, they haven't spoken since.\n\nRead moreA Place in The Sun's Laura Hamilton addresses weight loss after being called 'short and fat'\n\nHowever, Bianca won't be returning alone. David Wicks, Bianca's father, is also set to return to Albert Square, adding to the drama.\n\nThe pair, who last saw each other ten years ago, have a complex relationship. Actor Michael French will be returning to his role after a decade away. The actor, who last portrayed David in 2014, said: \"I feel honoured to be asked to reprise the role of David Wicks once again.\"\n\n\"It may only be a brief visit, but we know from his past that David never fails to create a lot of drama in a very short time.\"\n\nEastEnders Executive Producer Chris Clenshaw chimed in: \"David Wicks is undoubtedly one of EastEnders' most beloved rogues, and we are thrilled to welcome the talented Michael French back to the legendary role as we lead up to the show's 40th anniversary.\"\n\n\"David's character was never shy of drama during his previous stints, and I can assure you this return will be no different.\""
