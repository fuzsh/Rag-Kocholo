        "text": "Thanks...giving. Means to give thanks. So, every year, I mention some people to thank, most important: YOU. YOURSELF. 1. Thank yourself for never giving up on your professional ambitions. 2. Thank yourself for ignoring doubts, jealousy, shade, and hate from others (including family) who want to you stay in THEIR comfortable place, but you know you're on this to soar... 3. Thank yourself for ignoring your own fears and doubts to believe and value you. To be more afraid of NOT going forward than you are of staying back. 4. Thank yourself for not fitting in with a box. It's not it doesn't fit you, it's that YOU don't fit the box. 5. Thank yourself for refusing to accept that career unhappiness and employment poverty$$ is your destiny. It's not. You can make a change. Snoop said it years ago, \"I thank me.\" Absolutely. While you're thanking everyone else this week, you owe you to thank yourself. Need Career Coaching? Or a Standout Resume? Contact Me #beyourbestbrand #beyourbestcareerarchitect #resumes\n\nContinued from previous post... 3) Make sure everyone impacted is on the same page. My wife is amazing. Even so, after the first several weeks of her going to work and coming home to find no job prospects and no visible change in the status of the household, she had understandable questions about how I was spending my time. I was overly offended by such an inquiry because I‚Äôd spent all day getting kicked in the teeth and questioning my life choices (other than marrying her, of course!). Once we talked about it, she understood that it was hard for me to do anything other than try to find a new job and do the minimum things necessary to keep me sane. She‚Äôd still like me to clean out the garage so she can park the van in there. We‚Äôve been here for four years now, so that‚Äôs fair‚Ä¶ 4) Keep a good foundation. Personally, I believe that God has a plan for each of our lives and he doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. I say that as I‚Äôm still on the job market and I spent Saturday driving to and from the funeral of one of my best friends. But in the early part of this job hunt (and maybe even last week‚Ä¶) I quickly substituted my ideas on how things should play out for his perfect plan and then got mad at him about it. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus compares God‚Äôs goodness to my love for my kids and says that since God‚Äôs love is so much bigger and purer, the things he gives to us can be trusted all the more. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm asking for bread and he‚Äôs giving me rocks. Whatever he‚Äôs giving me is what I‚Äôd ask for if I knew what he knows. Might feel like a bag of rocks, but it‚Äôs not. Ok, there‚Äôs a dumpster in the driveway that‚Äôs waiting for me to start filling it with stuff from the garage. I‚Äôd better get to it! #jobsearch #dearyoungerme\n\nThree Key Pieces of Advice from Homeland Security üõ°Ô∏è On my way to San Diego, California, for the NUPOC Embark, I had the privilege of sitting beside a man with an impressive resume. After about 20 minutes, he initiated a conversation. As it turns out, he works for Homeland Security and has traveled extensively, escorting high-profile criminals out of the country. Pretty amazing! After noticing my Bible, I discovered that he and his wife are also believers in Jesus Christ. Given his extensive background and his retirement just a year away, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to learn from someone with such a wealth of experience. So, I asked him a simple question: \"As someone who's about to retire, what advice would you offer to someone like me, who's just starting my career?\" Here's what he shared: 1. Surround yourself with three people who are smarter, wiser, and more experienced than you. 2. Invest consistently; compounding is your friend and will open many doors in the future. 3. Continue reading the Word. It's easy to make excuses not to talk to someone on a plane, but I'm incredibly grateful that this conversation happened. It pushed me professionally, helped me spiritually, and challenged me personally. There's a lot to learn from strangers if you ask the right questions!\n\nWow! I can't believe I've been in the news business for 15+ years. Recently, I came across my first resume reel. This video helped me land my first on-air job. I still had braces on my teeth and a lot of work to do to hone my presentation skills. As a marathon runner, I often hear people say, \"don't look back, you're not going that way\". Sometimes it is good to look back to see how far we've come personally and professionally. Over the years, I faced countless challenges including self-doubt. In my heart and mind, I've always had a goal, and I continue to set goals that I am determined to achieve. For anyone second-guessing themselves, struggling with confidence or facing indecisiveness, I encourage you to look back at an accomplishment. Reflect on the effort required to reach that goal and the satisfaction you felt upon its completion. Remember to remain positive! I am thankful for the chance to keep pursuing my passion and am excited about dedicating over 15 more years to it! Watch young(er) Brie in action: #work #BePositive #positivity #goals\n\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to those who are seeking employment, contracts, open doors and opportunities, etc. My Pastor shared a quick message the other day. I‚Äôve been meditating on it, and allowing the Holy Spirit to minister to me through it. If you abide in me, and my words in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. - John 15:7 I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. - John 15:5 Abide means to remain, not depart, to wait for, endure. If serves as a conditional clause. Meaning we have a part in this. The Bible tells us faith without works is dead (James 2:26), God will bless all the work of our hands (Deuteronomy 28:12), and we will be blessed in what we do (James 1:25). More evidence that we have a role. The work: abide in God through your actions and words. Wait on the Lord, don‚Äôt give up. Release your faith, speak and move in faith. Speak the Word over whatever you‚Äôre believing and asking God for. Example of a faith confession: My business is more profitable than silver and yields better returns than gold (Proverbs 3:14) The results: bearing MUCH fruit: answered prayers, the new job, contracts, open doors, increased faith and hope in Jesus, favor, grace, etc. My go to scriptures while waiting: James 1:4, Galatians 6:9, Jeremiah 29:11 Have a blessed day. I pray this message blesses your life like it‚Äôs blessed mine. ü´∂üèæ\n\nWith all that are going on in the world, it is easy to give up, to be resigned, to not care or even participate in making things worse. However we all have a choice. We can replace a scowl with a smile. We can choose to lend a helping hand. We can choose to do right instead of wrong. We can choose peace over fighting. We can choose to give instead of take. We can choose to stay calm and let all that frazzled us roll off (like a water drop roll off the surface of a lotus leaf) We can choose to use our intellect to help others to make the world a better place. May we have a vision: aim for a world that is not only liveable but be a pleasant place to live in."
