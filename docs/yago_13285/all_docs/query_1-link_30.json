        "text": "The Prince Edward pub on the corner of my street has a new lick of grey paint\n\nThis is known locally as…\n\nThe Black Pub\n\nand on the opposite side of the road is\n\nThe White Pub (housing the BNP)\n\nAnd the wives and girlfriends\n\n(defined as such by the husbands and boyfriends)\n\ncome out from inside of both of the pubs\n\nand meet in the middle of street to have a drink outside the betting shop\n\nAnd with every lesson learned, I learn another one –\n\nThis morning I was in the shower, I was shaving\n\nBearing in mind – it’s been about six months since I’ve ‘done my legs’\n\nAnd so\n\nBecause of this – the razor quickly clogged with hair\n\nI put the razor under the shower head to rinse it out and\n\nbecause I put the razor too close to the shower-head\n\nAll of the little bits of hair sprayed back into my face\n\nand some of the snippets of leg hair went in to my eye\n\nThe city surrounding me places bets in betting shops because\n\nthe people want to know what will happen next\n\nThe one on the corner, which I just told you about\n\nIs a Williams and Hill\n\nTag line – set the machine limits and stay in control\n\nWhy not win something from uncertainty?\n\nAnd ‘what happens next’ feels like the moment my own leg hair sprayed into my eye\n\nSpin the wheel of fortune, or get on the wheel yourself and wonder\n\nWill the prime minister this time round just turn out to be a hamster?\n\n100 toy ducks float down the river, Bob Geldof gets on a flotilla to shout at Farage whilst pretending to be a sailor –\n\nFYI –\n\nWe are slap bang in the middle of the BREXIT SUMMER\n\nand even Wetherspoons has realised it’s political potential,\n\nand I keep staring into space,\n\nstaring at my phone\n\nand I keep wondering\n\nHOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS GOING TO LAST.\n\nThe lasting,\n\nbecause it really does last,\n\nfeels like constantly being stuck feeling the panic associated with an acute hangover\n\nDo you think you would be able to CUT DOWN on your drinking because, really, it is a depressant and will seriously interfere with any work we get done here – says a faraway voice on the other end of the line\n\nAnd the next day, despite this advice, you are being sick in the toilet and you put the shower on\n\nso your acquaintance\n\n(and from now on friend because after you get that drunk with someone there is a kind of bond)\n\ncan’t hear you\n\nand\n\nas you are being sick\n\nyou are sweating,\n\nyou have double vision\n\nand\n\nyou can’t get the\n\nPHONE A FRIEND option out of your head\n\n‘who wants to be a millionaire’ was such a SHIT programme\n\nAnyway –\n\nHangover anxiety, leading to subsequent bonding, is not necessarily a positive experience, it is just –\n\nendless\n\nand whilst I do like the meme – ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you Sonia’\n\nPermanently realising Jamie is dead\n\nAnd later on, after a multitude of tragedies\n\nrealising that the woman who played the receptionist in Nathan Barley now plays your girlfriend in Eastenders – and she is cheating on you\n\n(in the part you have had for the majority of your life)\n\nIs not my idea of a ‘good life’\n\nAnd being Sonia might be pretty repetitive.\n\nI mean – you might be alright, you’ve got some strength behind you, that’s a great pair of breasts, give me a high five! Says a woman who has been wearing no bra since they burnt them all, and who has a hat that covers her face and is wearing gaffa tape as a bracelet –\n\nWhy? – I say and I laugh\n\nYour country is in a bad mess and I wanted to make you feel better she says\n\nAnd I am trying to make MYSELF FEEL BETTER\n\n(capitals here signify SCREAMING IN A HYSTERICAL TONE)\n\nI.\n\nAM.\n\nTRYING.\n\nTo reduce my online time, in favour of studio time – ThisisalltobeinvolvedinthegallerysectorsoIactuallyhavesomeworktoshowinstead of all of this\n\nUNSALE-ABLE WRITING\n\nANYYYYWAY\n\nThe gallery, says the gallerist, is very ‘tongue in cheek’ its gross, false, its branding is based on fashion, it totally denies that there is any distance between artistic integrity and capitalist desire, it’s super funny, I mean I’m not hungry for gratification in these ways you know…\n\nI mean ultimately…\n\nI’m a ghost.\n\nI smile through gritted teeth – I’m thinking:\n\nI’m not a fucking ghost.\n\nBut… I concede…\n\nI do get that feeling in the dark when you are so out (literally) on a limb that you have to go downstairs from the bed your friend is sleeping in\n\nand sleep on the sofa and masturbate wildly\n\nand you are on a ‘girls holiday’ and this old man can see you through the window on the balcony and you don’t stop\n\nand he goes inside\n\nand you think\n\nDid I accidentally violate him in some way?\n\nIn the dark\n\nCan’t come soon enough for me\n\nAnd no, I wouldn’t PAY to hear me sing, but I’m in tune\n\nAnd my friend said – on the holiday\n\nMy dad had a liver transplant and then he wanted to write a play about the liver transplant and I thought – oh that’s cute – and then he explained, the main character would be\n\n– the new liver,\n\nand the other character (who only had occasional monologues), would be\n\n– the old liver.\n\nThis is an example of a laugh.\n\nWe need maximum laughs and maximum attitude so, yeah, joke with your mates that the current political situation sounds and feels like that song by the Rasmus called\n\n‘In the shadows’\n\nYes – you could justify going in fancy dress as the lead singer from the Rasmus to a party\n\nYes – ‘2003’ as a theme would make a good ‘ironic’ birthday\n\nBut – don’t call your baby BREXIT for a joke and NO I don’t think that this year it might be a good idea\n\nto write : 9 /11 The Musical,\n\nI promise you babe, the world just isn’t ready –\n\n(**BREXIT gets the left wing socialist hopefuls amongst us into a space filled with promise, but there are almost no resources to facilitate change and the want to facilitate change is primarily driven by neoliberal fantasies of looking like an activist on-line**)\n\nGuess what also happened because of a need to be visible ‘on-line’?\n\nA friend of mine\n\ngot dared\n\nTo stick a half eaten chicken drumstick up his arse\n\nand when he pulled it out there was no chicken left on the drumstick\n\nand this was a YouTube hit but really, I am not sure how pleased he is about it five years later\n\nCaptive on a carousel of time –\n\nI’m walking to Tesco listening to Joni Mitchell and contemplating\n\nbuying low fat salad cream and\n\nI can see an old paper plate with half a banana on it, collecting flies\n\nTheresa May is on the front cover of every paper and I’m interrupted with a phone call –\n\nI’ve been thinking – I think\n\nI need to move out of my house, says a friend\n\n(I spend the night and I lose my mind)\n\nI need to move really, maybe even – (in a horrified whisper) out of London\n\nWhere I was living was OKAY you know, pretty cheap with a bunch of mates\n\nThen my landlord called and said\n\nOK my son needs to move in to the spare room\n\nAnd we thought\n\nOooh might be a bit weird, the Landlord’s son, awkward –\n\nA couple of my mates moved out\n\nAnd the Landlord’s son arrived\n\nThe first thing he did was devise a net system in the garden\n\nHe didn’t tell us why\n\nThen he got a snooker cue and sawed it in half\n\nHe started catching squirrels in the net, beating them to death with the snooker cue\n\nAnd skinning and eating them\n\nThen yesterday, I got in, and he’d made a wreath of bones and hung it on our front door.\n\nI mean – it is cheap but I think this is a BIT MUCH – what d’you think?\n\nI mean\n\nWHAT DO I THINK?\n\nWHAT\n\nDO\n\nI\n\nTHINK?\n\nI think everyone in the UK is either a little bit underweight or overweight, no one has mastered the art of a decent fringe and in short : society doesn’t love you exactly the way you are but it should do.\n\nI don’t say this.\n\nI say – move out – but don’t leave the country babe.\n\nEmily Pope\n\nEmily Pope (b.1990) is an artist based in London.
