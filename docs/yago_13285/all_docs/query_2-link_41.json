        "text": "EastEnders fans have been left speculating about the identity of Sonia Fowler's baby following her unexpected pregnancy announcement. Many are convinced it is not her on-screen partner Reiss though.\n\nLast year, viewers saw Sonia, played by Natalie Cassidy, embark on a relationship with Reiss (Jonny Freeman). The pair were keen to start a family but faced several hurdles, including Reiss' infertility, reports the Mirror.\n\nAdding to the plot twist, it was unveiled that Reiss' wife had been in a long-term coma after suffering a stroke. Initially, Sonia was taken aback at the prospect of dating a man who was technically still married.\n\nREAD MORE: ITV For the Love of Dogs fans spot Alison Hammond's 'bad habit' as ratings plummet\n\nHowever, she soon warmed to the idea and began her romance with Reiss, who is the great-nephew of the late Dot Branning. Despite the challenges, Sonia and Reiss managed to proceed with IVF treatment, with Sonia undergoing the procedure.\n\nTheir journey hit a bump when a nurse informed Sonia that her womb lining was thinner than ideal. Matters took a more distressing turn for Sonia when she found out her friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) was expecting - leaving Sonia devastated and believing she wouldn't be able to conceive,\n\nBut this week in Walford, Sonia discovered she was pregnant. After taking a test, she shared the happy news with Reiss in emotional scenes at the Queen Vic.\n\nHowever, soap fans are convinced that Reiss Colwell isn't the father of Sonia's baby.\n\nIn a potential dramatic turn of events, EastEnders fans are theorising that Sonia Fowler could be expecting her ex-husband Martin Fowler's (James Bye) baby. Sonia and Martin, who have been married twice and share a daughter, Bex Fowler, have sparked speculation among viewers.\n\nSpeculation reached fever pitch on EastEnders' Reddit forums where fans have been discussing their theories about the plotline. Some Some believe that Martin could be the father of Sonia's unborn child.\n\nOne said: \"Let Sonia get pregnant, but naturally and by someone else. I would honestly root for Martin, even if they don't get back together\".\n\nA second said: \"Imagine if she and Martin had a one night stand all this time.\"\n\nOthers believe it was a long-running twist designed to shock. One said: \"Plot twist she's been with Martin all this time.\" A second said: \"Sonia deserves to be with someone like Martin.\""
