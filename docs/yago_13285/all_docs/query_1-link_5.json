        "text": "The third child of a very dysfunctional family, Sonia never knew her real dad - but her mum Carol always doted on her. During her mother’s fight against cancer, Sonia stood by Carol’s side and showed nothing but support. She gets on well with ex-husband Martin, and is nothing but a devoted parent to their daughter Bex. Sonia was on hand to help out Martin during Stacey’s postpartum psychosis and helped out regularly with baby Arthur.\n\nSonia is currently in a relationship with Tina Carter, who lives with Sonia and Bex.\n\nSonia’s stoic, capable, level-headed and practical. She’s a workaholic and an all-round good mum."
