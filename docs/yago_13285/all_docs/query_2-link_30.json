        "text": "The following article references the loss of a child.\n\nEastEnders spoilers follow.\n\nEastEnders has aired heartbreaking scenes where Sonia Fowler discovered she was never pregnant.\n\nThis week has seen Sonia under significant stress, first with the seemingly pregnant nurse trying to keep Reiss optimistic after losing a major client.\n\nThen, Reiss had a row with Bianca Jackson over his money troubles that had him demanding Sonia kick her relative out of their house. Against the backdrop of all of this drama, viewers have seen Sonia hasn't been feeling well.\n\nThursday's (June 6) episode on BBC One and the BBC iPlayer streaming service opened with Sonia trying to convince Reiss that they could smooth over this tension with Bianca.\n\nRelated: 13 huge EastEnders spoilers for next week\n\nAlthough Reiss refused to back down during a confrontation with Bianca, they soon had another crisis to face when Sonia started bleeding.\n\nReiss and Bianca rushed Sonia hospital where she underwent a series of tests to see whether her pregnancy was at risk.\n\nSonia immediately sensed something was severely wrong as she couldn't hear any heartbeat during the scans.\n\nThe doctor then explained while looking at the scan: \"I'm afraid there's no embryo. It's called a blighted ovum where it attaches to the uterus but doesn't develop into an embryo.\"\n\nRelated: EastEnders' Kellie Bright teases future of The Six murder plot\n\nBianca was confused over what this diagnosis meant, with a tearful Sonia explaining: \"There wasn't [an embryo] to begin with.\"\n\nLater, the soap cut back to Bianca and Reiss trying to comfort Sonia at home. Sonia confided in her loved ones that she felt incredibly conflicted.\n\n\"It's not like I lost it,\" Sonia told her family. \"It's just that there was somethingâ€¦ dunno, it just felt different. I believed in it, you know? I started to love it and it's gone.\"\n\nBianca and Reiss rallied around Sonia as their section of Thursday's episode concluded.\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer, where most episodes drop early at 6am ahead of their TV broadcast.\n\nRead more EastEnders spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nOrganisations including Sands and Tommy's are able to offer help and support to anyone affected by baby loss."
