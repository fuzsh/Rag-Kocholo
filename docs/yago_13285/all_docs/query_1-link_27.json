        "text": "EastEnders viewers were left scratching their heads as they realised that BBC bosses had skipped past an incredibly important point in the Sonia Fowler IVF storyline.\n\nFans of the show will remember that Sonia, who was the granddaughter of the late Dot Cotton, was left money following her tragic death - and this would have enabled her to fund her IVF journey. And this is why fans of the BBC soap were perplexed when Reiss started using his wife's money to fund their baby plans, as his wife Debbie was in a coma. Unknown to Sonia, Reiss was followed by Bianca Jackson where she overheard him asking his comatose wife for permission to use more of her money to pay for the treatment.\n\nUnable to contain their frustration, some viewers took to social media to voice their discontent over the lack of continuity in Sonia's storyline. One person said: \"Didn't Sonia inherit all of dots money? #Eastenders.\" Another person commented: \"Sonia stole Dotâ€™s money too #eastenders.\" Meanwhile a third person added: \"I couldve sworn Dot left sonia money? #EastEnders.\"a fourth person chimed in: \"Well, Sonia did steal from a charity fund and from Dot, so I would hardly call her Mother Teresa #EastEnders.\" The relationship between Bianca and Reiss has been strained since she returned to Walford. So much so, Reiss told Sonia to ask Bianca to leave their home as they continued to lock horns - which is why she followed him to the hospital to find out how he was paying for Sonia's IVF treatment.\n\nOn realising his deception, Bianca demanded that he reveal all to Sonia. Forced into a corner, Reiss admitted everything about how he was financing the treatment, leaving Sonia hurt and devastated by his lies. And while Sonia struggled to deal with his deception, her conversation with Kathy Beale allowed her to forgive him as she was told that Debbie's money would go to him eventually and it was better spent on creating an addition to their family. When Bianca saw that Reiss and Sonia were displaying a united front, she hit the roof and labelled her younger sister as being \"insane.\"\n\nTypically, Bianca made her feelings known to Reiss and was adamant that Sonia would eventually come round to her way of thinking. Lashing out, Reiss branded her a chaotic mess and warned her to stay out of his relationship with Sonia. And their feud has now seeped into a more public setting when Bianca tried to make Sonia see Reiss for the man she thinks he is. Screaming at the couple while in the Queen Vic pub, it remains to be seen if she has taken things too far with her younger sister."
