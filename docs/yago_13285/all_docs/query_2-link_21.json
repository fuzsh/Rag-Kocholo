        "text": "In upcoming scenes, Sonia calls the accountant and asks for help.\n\nBut, despite ignoring the nurse, Reiss refuses to make amends by giving her any advice.\n\nSonia reasons she’ll have to sell Dot’s house to pay the inheritance tax bill but is crushed, not wanting to leave her home.\n\nLater in the week, Sonia’s stunned when she finds Reiss on her doorstep.\n\nAnother wrote: “From a Digital Spy interview with Natalie Cassidy, it seems that Reiss will be around for a while. If the writers are planning a gradual introduction, having him appear as a relative at Dot’s funeral was a good idea. My guess is that he will return once Ricky and Scarlett depart for Germany.”\n\n“It wouldn’t have made sense for him to come for Dot’s funeral and never leave,” a third agreed.\n\n“It makes sense that there would be a little break between his initial and full-time introduction. Sonia tried to call him on NYE so he hasn’t been forgotten about.”\n\nEastEnders airs on BBC One from Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm."
