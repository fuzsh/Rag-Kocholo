        "text": "Albert Square is set to be hit by the return of another 90s legend in upcoming EastEnders scenes and we couldn’t be happier.\n\nFans have been theorising that Patsy Palmer is set to reprise her role as Bianca Jackson – and they have been proved right.\n\nIn the coming months, Bianca is set to return to Albert Square, unaware that dad David Wicks (Michael French) is hot on her tail.\n\nIt has been ten years since David last set foot in Walford, and fans were delighted when his return was announced last month.\n\nSoon after the news broke, actress Patsy fuelled rumours of a return for Bianca when she took to Instagram to post an old picture of the pair of them in character, with the caption, ‘Every girl needs her father’.\n\nDavid and Bianca have had a complicated relationship over the years, with David only discovering that she was his daughter after developing romantic feelings for her in 1993.\n\nWhen David returned in 2013, it seemed as though he and Bianca’s mum Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) were going to get their happy ending, but things ended in disaster when he suffered a heart attack and failed to appear at their wedding.\n\nUnfortunately, their relationship broke down, and David moved to America, where he has been ever since.\n\nBianca made a return to EastEnders earlier this year when Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) paid her a visit in Milton Keynes.\n\nShe later joined her back in Albert Square ahead of Whitney’s wedding to Zack Hudson (James Farrar), but got more than she bargained for when she found out about his affair with Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa).\n\nWhen Whitney found out that Bianca had kept quiet about their betrayal, she abandoned her, which was the beginning of Bianca’s downward spiral.\n\nBianca’s final scenes saw her fall out with sister Sonia Fowler (Natalie Cassidy) in dramatic fashion, and reveal to best friend Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) that she was suffering from depression.\n\nThere is still plenty of unfinished business for Bianca in Albert Square, especially considering what Reiss Colwell (Jonny Freeman) has been up to in her absence.\n\nWill she be the one to get to the bottom of his crimes? And what will she make of David’s arrival?\n\nMORE : Lauryn Hill issues defiant statement after leaving fans ‘disappointed’ over tour cancellation\n\nMORE : Fans of 90s TV series blast ‘absolutely awful’ gay storyline 25 years later\n\nMORE : 90s pop icon reveals incredible body transformation aged 52"
