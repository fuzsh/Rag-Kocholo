        "text": "Kate Harwood has tweeted that she's currently at an EE storylining conference....\n\nYeah I was there and you will be massively impressed with their plans.\n\nOne chap came up with Kat and Carl get together whilst Alfie watches with jealousy - they are looking to recreate the Kat and Andy storyline - throwing in Kirsty for added value this time.\n\nRoxy will have Grandad's baby which complicates the above storyline even further and in a controversial move, Roxy will swap Alfie for Carl. Kirsty then falls pregnant with Carl so he has to choose but then when Kat says shes pregnant as well Carl changes his name by deed poll to Jack Branning. Jack can't cope that someone has stolen his ID, kills himself and Ronnie returns and steals all three babies and moves to Ibiza.\n\nIn other news, Whitney and Joey will be the next golden couple and we will yearn for them to get together.\n\nAll of the above is subject to change of course\n\n0\n\nThe thing is, we don’t know what public opinion necessarily is at the moment, other than a selection of comments on forums like this – and I would hardly say a handful of people posting on the internet is public opinion. We may think we are, but we’re not.\n\nFor example, my EastEnders viewing started as a result of my parents who, almost 30 years from the first episode, still watch.\n\nI visited them over the weekend and knowing what the forums are like at the moment, I asked them after Friday’s episode if they still enjoy the show – funnily enough they said they lost interest at the start of the year (but kept watching) and now interested again. Equally I have other friends who love the show at the moment who don’t use these forums. I have other friends who stopped watching.\n\nI’ve made several posts about this topic on the various threads doing the rounds – I genuinely do think the show is in a better state than people are making out. Do I pass that off as anything more than my opinion? No.\n\nPeople have mentioned that there appears to a lot of staff changes going on behind the scenes – has anyone actually considered that it could be a good thing? You can’t just fire people who are on contract. Perhaps they know the writing and story-lining is poor, but can’t release whole groups of people from their contracts? We don’t know what goes on behind the scenes or what contractual requirements are in place. For all we know there might be a load of more characters leaving at the end of their current contract which we (or maybe even the actors) haven’t been informed of yet. If they do release people from contracts early that costs money – money the show doesn’t have.\n\nThat’s fairly basic employment law. However, none of us are experts in this. Even if we like to think we are.\n\n0"
