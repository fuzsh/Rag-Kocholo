        "text": "SONIA Fowler makes a major decision after receiving heartbreaking pregnancy news in EastEnders.\n\nThe character - played by Natalie Cassidy - has been desperate to have a baby with partner Reiss Colwell in recent months.\n\nThe couple turned to IVF and thought they had been successful, but in sad scenes which aired this week, Sonia learned she hadn't been pregnant after all.\n\nTensions had risen at home as Reiss clashed with Sonia's sister Bianca, and Sonia also didn't feel well.\n\nAs her sister and partner were mid confrontation, Sonia started bleeding and was quickly rushed to hospital.\n\nShe had tests and a scan before the doctor told her: \"I'm afraid there's no embryo. It's called a blighted ovum where it attaches to the uterus but doesn't develop into an embryo.\"\n\nThe couple were left devastated, but in upcoming EastEnders scenes, it's tense at No.25 as Reiss tries to support Sonia under the disapproving glare of Bianca.\n\nSonia reveals she wants to try IVF again, which Reiss agrees to, but he pales when she reveals that they need more money.\n\nReiss tries to persuade Jay to buy his car, but he refuses.\n\nBecoming desperate for money, Reiss tells Kat that she didn’t pay her February tax bill in the hope of securing the funds, but he soon regrets his idea.\n\nBianca senses something is up after she speaks to Kat and Jay in The Vic, and follows Reiss to the care home where she overhears him asking Debbie for permission to borrow more money.\n\nReiss pales to realise Bianca has caught him red-handed.\n\nBianca is horrified by Reiss’ actions and gives him an ultimatum – he needs to tell Sonia or she will.\n\nWhat will Reiss do? And how will Sonia react if he does tell her the truth?"
