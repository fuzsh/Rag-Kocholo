        "text": "EastEnders legend Natalie Cassidy has admitted she regularly fears that her time as Sonia Fowler will come to an end and \"prepares\" herself to be axed. The 41-year-old actress joined the cast aged just 10 back in 1993 and has since gone on to become one of the soap's most recognisable characters, with two British Soap awards under her belt.\n\nSince hitting the screens as a youngster, Sonia has been at the centre of the some of the biggest storylines from teenage pregnancy, love affairs, a cancer scare and most recently her difficult IVF journey.\n\nWith being such an iconic character on Albert Square, Natalie said fans often assume that her role is safe but stressed that this isn't the case. Getting candid about her future on the soap, she shared: \"One day, you know, I'm sure Sonia will end.\n\n\"I don't know when, hopefully she will potter about being a nurse for a bit longer. I don't want her to die a terrible death, I don't want her to get run over or pushed in Walford train station.\"\n\nQuizzed further about soap producers sometimes making sudden changes to big characters, the actress explained: \"To be honest, it's got to evolve and characters have to come and go because otherwise it will be a very boring place. You have different people come in with different ideas.\n\nRead More...

I have to think, 'Oh I'm going to be leaving then' because I could be gone, definitely gone.\n\nDon't Miss...\n\nGraham Norton was 'left for dead' after Eurovision host was stabbed in attack [REVEALED]\n\nEurovision winner Nemo shows true colours as runner cleans their shoes for them [WATCH]\n\nZoe Ball fights back tears with emotional message on 1st show since mum's death [LISTEN]\n\nEastEnders: Sonia Fowler receives a new car\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
