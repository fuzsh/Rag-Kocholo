If you are not a UK Viewer\n\nThis article may contain plot details about an upcoming episode.\n\nEastEnders has had many storylines over the years, below are a few popular ones you might remember.\n\n1980's[]\n\nReg Cox's death (1985)[]\n\nWhen EastEnders first aired, the first storyline the viewer were faced with was Reg Cox's death. The first scenes saw Den Watts, Ali Osman and Arthur Fowler breaking into 23 Albert Square as they were concerned for Reg and found him dead in his chair.\n\nEpisode aired: 19 February 1985\n\nWriter: Gerry Huxham\n\nDirector: Matthew Robinson\n\nViewers: 17.35 million\n\nBaby Hassan's cot death (1985)[]\n\nThe sudden tragedy of baby Hassan's cot death came as a surprise to both Ali and Sue Osman, as well as the audience since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways, had made them appear rather comical.\n\nEpisode aired: 20 June 1985\n\nWriter: Jane Hollowood\n\nDirector: Sue Butterworth\n\nViewers: 11.70 million\n\nDen is revealed as the father of Michelle's baby (1985)[]\n\nThe mystery surrounding the identity of the father of Michelle's unborn baby was finally revealed in this classic EastEnders moment as a teenage Michelle waited by the canal for a secret rendezvous with 'Dirty' Den.\n\nEpisode aired: 3 October 1985\n\nWriter: Tony Holland\n\nDirector: Julia Smith\n\nViewers: 17.75 million\n\nAngie attempts suicide (1986)[]\n\nIt's no wonder that falling off the wagon was a regular occurrence in Angie's life being married to Den wasn't exactly a fairytale life. Following the first and long-awaited meeting with his ten-year mistress Jan Hammond and the misery that came along, Angie had had enough of life altogether and hated the fact she loved Den ever so dearly and decided to end it all in an act of suicide. Luckily Den found her in time.\n\nEpisode aired: 27 February 1986\n\nWriter: Julia Schofield\n\nDirector: Mike Lloyd\n\nViewers: 23.70 million\n\nMichelle jilts Lofty (1986)[]\n\nIt was blatantly obvious from the beginning that Michelle didn't truly love Lofty enough to settle down in married life and live a happy ever after. She cared for Lofty, but it wasn't the kind of care she had for Den the father of her baby. However, Michelle put her feelings aside and decided to marry Lofty. When the day finally arrived, Michelle made it to church but chose this day to put her feelings first and jilted Lofty at the altar. However, the pair did end up tying the knot in November, in a private registry office only surrounded by close family.\n\nEpisode aired: 30 September 1986\n\nWriter: Tony McHale\n\nDirector: Mike Gibbon\n\nViewers: 22.35 million\n\nAngie tells Den she has six months to live (1986)[]\n\nAngie can't think of any other way to stop Den Watts from leaving her for his girlfriend Jan Hammond.
