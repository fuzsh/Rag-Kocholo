        "text": "EastEnders spoilers follow.\n\nEastEnders has confirmed Patsy Palmer will return as Bianca Jackson for an epic reunion.\n\nThe soap's official X / Twitter account announced on Thursday (August 8) that Bianca will be reappearing in Walford \"in the coming months\".\n\nEastEnders teased a long-awaited family reunion will finally occur when Bianca crosses paths with her father David Wicks — following the recent news that Michael French will be back as David for a short stint.\n\nBianca never knew David was her father as a child, leading to some uncomfortable EastEnders scenes in the 1990s as they flirted with each other before the truth was revealed.\n\nRelated: Best streaming services 2024 — including Disney Plus, Netflix, iPlayer and Apple TV+\n\nPatsy Palmer has had numerous short stints in EastEnders over the past few years, most recently wrapping up a stay in Walford in June.\n\nBianca was one of the first to suspect something wasn't right with half-sister Sonia Fowler's partner Reiss Colwell, though her warnings were ignored.\n\nSince Bianca left Albert Square, Reiss has spiralled out of control by murdering his comatose wife Debbie, and stealing from Phil Mitchell as part of an investment scam.\n\nRelated: EastEnders gift guide – all the best books and merchandise for fans of the soap\n\nThere was an on-screen update on Bianca's condition shortly after her departure. Kat Slater confided in Sonia that Bianca had been diagnosed with depression but had stopped taking the medication she'd been prescribed.\n\nAnother potentially awkward reunion could occur if Bianca meets up again with Junior Knight following their hook-up earlier in the summer.\n\nJunior moved along quickly following Bianca's exit, as he's now begun an affair with his former stepmother Cindy Beale.\n\nEastEnders airs on Mondays - Thursdays at 7.30pm on BBC One. The show also streams on BBC iPlayer, where most episodes drop early at 6am ahead of their TV broadcast.\n\nRead more EastEnders spoilers on our dedicated homepage\n\nYou Might Also Like"
