        "text": "Amidst her secret battle with depression, Bianca discovered that Reiss was using money from the account of his then-comatose wife Debbie Colwell (Jenny Meier) to fund his IVF journey with Sonia.\n\nWhile Sonia chose to stand by Reiss, Bianca outed their questionable behaviour to a packed Queen Vic pub before tearfully fleeing Walford in her Taco van.\n\nSince then, a financially struggling Reiss murdered his wife Debbie to help fund his new family life with pregnant Sonia and became engaged to her after Debbie’s death. However, Debbie’s mother Brenda (Nathalie McAuliffe) remains convinced there’s more to what happened.\n\nMore like this\n\nNow, Reiss may have another problem in the shape of the loud Bianca when she arrives back in Walford - and her father David Wicks (Michael French) won’t be far behind her.\n\nThe pair last saw each other in 2014 following David’s aborted wedding to his childhood sweetheart and Bianca’s mother, Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), which saw David leave Walford and head to America.\n\nBianca and David have always had a complicated relationship but their love for each other remains strong.\n\nSpeaking about his return when it was announced actor Michael French said: \"I feel honoured to be asked to reprise the role of David Wicks once again. It may only be a brief visit, but we know from his past that David never fails to create a lot of drama in a very short time.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sonia has since forgiven Bianca for her actions after B’s pal Kat Mitchell (Jessie Wallace) told her of her half-sister’s struggle with depression.\n\nBianca will surely have Sonia’s back, however, so could she prove instrumental in the truth being outed about murderous Reiss?\n\nRead more:\n\n6 EastEnders spoilers next week: Linda Carter in peril and Cindy Beale is under suspicion\n\nEastEnders reveals Linda's unexpected blackmailer in early iPlayer release\n\nEastEnders confirms new proposal twist for Suki and Eve in early iPlayer release – what’s Nish’s next move?\n\nEastEnders airs dark threat for Nish Panesar in dramatic early BBC iPlayer release\n\nEastEnders’ Micah Balfour: ‘Junior has developed some genuine feelings towards Cindy’\n\nEastEnders airs Monday to Thursday at 7:30pm on BBC One and from 6am on BBC iPlayer."
