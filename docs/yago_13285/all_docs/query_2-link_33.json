        "text": "EastEnders' star Natalie Cassidy, known for her role as Sonia Fowler, has had to take a break from filming due to illness. The 40-year-old actress didn't reveal what she's suffering from but said it was serious enough to make her stay at home.\n\nNatalie shared with her 438,000 Instagram followers that she's spending her time off watching TV and resting. She wrote: \"Poorly. The only time I will ever get to watch the South Bank Show Originals. Beryl Cook. Bliss.\"\n\nShe added: \"But I hate being unwell and mucking up people's schedules! Everyone works so hard and I really have to be very poorly to not go to work. Couple of days rest and I'll be back at it!\"\n\nWhat's the best pub in Nottinghamshire?\n\nWhile taking it easy, Natalie is also thinking about her new home studio, the Mirror reports. She asked her fans: \"Can anyone recommend a company that makes neon wall signs?\" Natalie has been part of EastEnders since 1993, featuring in many major storylines, including teenage pregnancy.\n\nRecently, fans have seen Sonia trying for a second child with her boyfriend Reiss through IVF. Before Christmas, Sonia thought she was pregnant and took a test with her friend Whitney to find out.\n\nSadly, it wasn't successful but they said they'll keep trying. Speaking about her 30th anniversary on the show, Natalie told Loose Women: \"I was 10 [when I started]. I was 40 this year.\" In her early days on the show, Sonia was known for playing her trumpet but Natalie was already learning how to play the instrument outside of work.\n\nShe said: \"I started playing it and actually I wasn't bad. They said, 'Oh no. No more lessons for you. We want Sonia to be really bad at it'. I could have been great, couldn't I? I could've been the next Miles Davis. But it never happened!\" Despite taking on strong storylines, the actress explained that her favourite scenes are more casual ones.\n\n\"Oh you know what I love the most? It's not the great big ones,\" she explained before adding: \"It's the times when you're sat in the Vic with all the women or it's a Hen Do and you're chatting and gossiping about stuff. I walk into the pub and still go, 'I can't believe I'm here'. It's so iconic.\""
