        "text": "EastEnders fans were left baffled as they noticed a glaring error in the Sonia Fowler IVF plotline.\n\nViewers will recall that Sonia, granddaughter of the late Dot Cotton, was bequeathed money following her sad demise - funds which could have supported her IVF journey. This is why BBC soap fans were puzzled when Reiss began using his comatose wife Debbie's money to finance their baby-making plans.\n\nUnbeknownst to Sonia, Bianca Jackson tailed Reiss and overheard him asking his unconscious spouse for consent to use more of her cash for the procedure.\n\nREAD MORE: EastEnders fans 'rumble' Walford's next killer after creepy three-word comment\n\nREAD MORE: Click for more brilliant Daily Star TV stories\n\nUnable to hold back their annoyance, some spectators took to social media to express their dissatisfaction with the inconsistency in Sonia's narrative. One individual posted: \"Didn't Sonia inherit all of dots money? #Eastenders.\"\n\nAnother person remarked: \"Sonia stole Dot's money too #eastenders.\" A third viewer added: \"I could've sworn Dot left Sonia money? # EastEnders.\"\n\nA fourth chimed in: \"Well, Sonia did steal from a charity fund and from Dot, so I would hardly call her Mother Teresa #EastEnders.\"\n\nThe rapport between Bianca and Reiss has been tense since her return to Walford. So much so, Reiss asked Sonia to request Bianca to vacate their residence as their clashes continued - leading her to follow him to the hospital to discover how he was funding Sonia's IVF treatment.\n\nBianca's fury was ignited after discovering Reiss' deception, as she demanded a full disclosure to Sonia. Finding himself backed into a corner, he confessed about the source of his fundraising for the treatment, leaving a distraught Sonia heartbroken over his dishonesty.\n\nSonia, meanwhile, was finding it hard to digest his betrayal but Kathy Beale's conversation helped her to forgive him with the assurance that Debbie's financial aid would eventually reach him and could be utilised for expanding their family. Witnessing the unity between Reiss and Sonia, Bianca lost her cool, accusing her sibling of acting \"insane.\"\n\nNever one to hold back, Bianca expressed her disgust to Reiss and made it clear that she believes Sonia will ultimately see his true colours. In response, an angry Reiss called her a chaotic wreck and cautioned her to steer clear of his bond with Sonia.\n\nThe quarrel has escalated and spilled into public domain when an enraged Bianca attempted to expose Reiss in front of Sonia. As she launched into a tirade against the couple in the Queen Vic pub, only time will tell if she went too far in berating her little sister."
