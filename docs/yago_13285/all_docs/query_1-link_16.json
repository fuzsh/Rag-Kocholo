        "text": "EastEnders ' legend Sonia Fowler's baby daddy has been revealed, fans are convinced, after the character's shock pregnancy news - and they are sure it's not Reiss.\n\nLast year on the show, Sonia (played by Natalie Cassidy) started a relationship with Reiss (Jonny Freeman). The couple were eager to start a family but faced numerous obstacles - including Reiss' infertility. Adding to the drama, it was revealed last year that Reiss' wife was in a long-term coma following a stroke. Initially, Sonia was shocked at the idea of dating a man who was technically still married.\n\nHowever, she soon warmed up to the idea. The beloved character then began her romance with Reiss, who is the great-nephew of the late Dot Branning. Despite the long wait, Sonia and Reiss managed to proceed with IVF treatment, with Sonia undergoing the procedure.\n\nREAD MORE: BBC Death in Paradise fans think they have worked out Ralf Little replacement is previous star\n\nThe pair were hit with a setback when a nurse informed Sonia that her womb lining was thinner than ideal. Things took a more distressing turn for Sonia when she discovered her friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) was pregnant - leaving Sonia heartbroken and believing she wouldn't be able to conceive.\n\nBut this week in Walford, Sonia discovered she was pregnant. After taking a test, she shared the joyous news with Reiss in emotional scenes at the Queen Vic. But fans of the soap are convinced that Reiss Colwell isn't the father of Sonia's baby.\n\nIn what could be a massive plot twist, fans are now speculating that Sonia is actually carrying the child of her ex-husband Martin Fowler ( James Bye ). Sonia and Martin have been married twice and share a daughter, Bex Fowler.\n\nSeveral viewers took to Reddit to share their thoughts and fan theories about the unfolding storyline between Sonia and Reiss, according to the Daily Star. Some fans are speculating that Sonia's baby daddy could turn out to be Martin.\n\nOne dedicated viewer wrote: \"Let Sonia get pregnant, but naturally and by someone else. I would honestly root for Martin, even if they don't get back together\". Another fan chimed in with: \"Imagine if she and Martin had a one night stand all this time.\"\n\nWho do you think Sonia's baby daddy is on EastEnders? Vote in our poll HERE to have your say.\n\nA third added their voice, saying: \"Plot twist she's been with Martin all this time.\" Expressing hope that Sonia will reunite with Martin, another fan posted: \"Sonia deserves to be with someone like Martin.\"\n\nIn an interesting revelation, artificial intelligence (AI) also seems to have jumped on this theory bandwagon. The Daily Star questioned Gemini, one of the world's most popular AI \"creative\" tools, about the possibility of Sonia becoming pregnant with Martin's child.\n\nGemini responded that it was \"likely\" further outlining why it would make for a \"good\" plot twist. \"Unexpected twist: If Sonia is indeed pregnant with Martin's baby, it would be a shocking turn of events for viewers. It adds a layer of complexity to her relationship with Reiss and Martin, both romantically and as friends.\"\n\nIt also pointed out that another reason this could work well for the storyline would be the \"Emotional drama.\"\n\nThis revelation would create plenty of emotional drama with Sonia grappling with her feelings for both Martin and Reiss, and how it would impact their relationships.\n\nAI tool Gemini also chimed in: \"The storyline could explore the strength of Sonia and Martin's bond, even though they are no longer together. A pregnancy with Martin would also reignite old feelings and create friction between all three characters.\""
