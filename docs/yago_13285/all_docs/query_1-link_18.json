        "text": "EastEnders fans are convinced they've 'worked out' the puzzle of Sonia Fowler's pregnancy timeline, with many predicting that the father of the baby is actually not her partner Reiss Colwell. Sonia, played by Natalie Cassidy, has been desperately trying to have a baby with Reiss via IVF, after learning of his fertility issues while hoping to expand their family.\n\nAfter months of uncertainty and devastating setbacks, the couple finally saw success with their IVF treatment, with Sonia delightedly revealing she was pregnant during Monday evening's episode (April 22). But despite the joy unfolding on screen, fans fear there could be a massive plot twist about to unfold, with speculation suggesting that Sonia is actually carrying the child of her ex-husband Martin Fowler.\n\nThings haven't been easy for Sonia and Reiss, with the couple having to go to a private IVF clinic, due to the fact that Sonia already has a daughter with ex-husband Martin. Reiss even dipped into the savings of his comatose wife Debbie, who is hospitalised with a long-term coma after suffering a stroke in the bath, in order to fund the treatment.\n\nAt first, Sonia was taken aback by dating a technically married man. But she soon came around and her romance with Reiss blossomed. The pair were hit with another setback when a nurse explained to Sonia that her womb lining was thinner than ideal.\n\nThings then took a more upsetting turn for Sonia when she found out pal Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) was pregnant - leaving Sonia devastated, and thinking it wasnâ€™t going to happen for her. But this week in Walford, Sonia discovered she was pregnant. After taking a test, she shared the joyous news with Reiss in emotional scenes at the Queen Vic.\n\nBut fans of the soap are now convinced that Reiss isn't actually the father of Sonia's baby. Several viewers took to Reddit to share their theories about the unfolding storyline between Sonia and Reiss, according to the Daily Star.\n\nSome fans are suggesting that Sonia's baby daddy could turn out to be her ex Martin. One viewer wrote: \"Let Sonia get pregnant, but naturally and by someone else. I would honestly root for Martin, even if they don't get back together\".\n\nAnother fan chimed in with: \"Imagine if she and Martin had a one night stand all this time.\"\n\nA third added: \"Plot twist she's been with Martin all this time.\"\n\nExpressing hope that Sonia will reunite with Martin, another fan shared: \"Sonia deserves to be with someone like Martin.\"\n\nEastEnders fans are also convinced they have 'rumbled' when exactly Sonia might welcome her new arrival. One fan speculated: \"Right so Sonia will probably have her baby on the 40th OR New Years.\"\n\nThe speculation didn't stop there either, with one viewer predicting an even darker twist is on the cards - which links to Reiss' wife Debbie.\n\nOne wrote: \"I think she'll wake up when Sonia has her baby and she steals it to get revenge on Reiss.\"\n\nMeanwhile another viewer questioned: \"When is Debbie going to wake up? As soon as Sonia gets pregnant B. When Sonia goes into labour C. Immediately after Sonia gives birth.\""
