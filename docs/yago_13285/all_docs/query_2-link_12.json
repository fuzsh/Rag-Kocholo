        "text": "Sonia and Reiss promised to keep in touch following his departure and some other good news came for the nurse.\n\nDot had left her house in Albert Square to her step-granddaughter for all of her years of devoted love and care but, of course, Dotty Cotton (Milly Zero) was far from happy.\n\nShe threatened to burn the house down but when Rocky was able to stop her, Dotty left in the back of a taxi, leaving Sonia to have the house all to herself.\n\nActress Natalie Cassidy spoke to Express.co.uk and other press on how 2023 is going to be a very different year for Sonia, with Reiss partly responsible.\n\nCassidy and Humphries organised a rainbow-themed birthday party for their daughter, as well as a magician.\n\nAlong with a few adorable snaps on Instagram, the EastEnders star wrote: \"Our gorgeous Joanie had the best 6th birthday ever!\n\n\"Celebrated with nearest and dearest, she loved the whole day.\n\n\"Where does the time go? I canâ€™t believe she is 6 and getting funnier by the minute.\"\n\nEastEnders is available to watch on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."
