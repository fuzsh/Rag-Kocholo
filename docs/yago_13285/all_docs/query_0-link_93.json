Despite overwhelming evidence of his deceit, Cameron wriggles out of it by insisting his intentions were honourable - he was watching her on CCTV to keep Poppy safe. Claiming he has feelings for Poppy, Cameron does his best to dupe his mother and secure her silence.\n\nEve begins to regret ever doubting her son, but the trust proves short-lived when she asks him to prove he has deleted all the video files of Poppy from his computer. As Cameron’s anger takes hold, he makes a shocking outburst, casting doubt over Cameron's innocence once again.\n\nElsewhere, a weakened Lenny realises he needs to push Paul to let him go. He goads Paul, telling him he doesn't have the killer instinct required to see the job through.\n\nHowever, just as Paul is about to pull the trigger, the mysterious person who ordered the hit on Lenny steps out from the shadows.\n\nWith a little help from Bob, Angus prepares for his first, socially-distanced, date with Rebecca. Their date hits another stumbling block when Angus reels off his long list of failed romances, making Rebecca question whether he is really the man for her.\n\nSTARRING\n\nFrank Gallagher as Lenny Murdoch\n\nSanjeev Kohli as Amandeep \"AJ\" Jandhu\n\nIain Robertson as Stevie O'Hara\n\nHolly Jack as Nicole Brodie\n\nJordan Young as Alex Murdoch\n\nSean Connor as Dylan Christie\n\nDavid Paisley as Rory Murdoch\n\nLeah MacRae as Ellie McLean\n\nMichael Wallace as Cameron Christie\n\nLindsey Campbell as Poppy Patterson\n\nVictoria Liddelle as Eve Christie\n\nJenny Hulse as Amber Murdoch\n\n​​Devised by Paul Unwin / Jeremy Brock\n\nDevised by Tony McHale / Mal Young\n\nWritten by Rebekah Harrison\n\nDirected by Jamie Annett\n\nSeries Producer: Sandra MacIver\n\nExecutive Producer: Simon Harper\n\nExecutive Producer: Kate Oates\n\nSkylar’s mistake has fatal consequences, but is she really the one to blame?\n\nKian admits his addiction to Jac.\n\nDonna tries to put Xavier's memory to rest.\n\nSkylar's mistake has fatal consequences, but she may not be entirely to blame for the tragedy.\n\nKian opens up to Jac about his addiction, but remains unsure that she will stand by him now she knows the truth.\n\nAlex and Donna kiss, but Donna still finds herself struggling to put Xavier's memory to rest.\n\nSTARRING\n\nJo Martin as Max McGerry\n\nChan Woo Lim as Jeong-Soo Han\n\nTyler Luke Cunningham as Louis McGerry\n\nJaye Jacobs as Donna Jackson\n\nAmy Lennox as Chloe Godard\n\nBelinda Owusu as Nicky McKendrick\n\nAlex Walkinshaw as Adrian \"Fletch\" Fletcher\n\nGuy Henry as Henrik Hanssen\n\nDavid Ames as Dominic \"Dom\" Copeland\n\nMiles Mitchell as Alex Duval\n\nTrieve Blackwood-Cambridge as Josh Hudson\n\nBob Barrett as Sacha Levy\n\nNic Jackman as Cameron Dunn\n\nDawn Steele as Ange Godard\n\nRosie Marcel as Jac Naylor\n\nSian Reese-Williams as Jodie Rodgers\n\nFrancesca Barrett as Beka Levy\n\nRamin Karimloo as Kian Madani\n\nVinetta Rishi as Lucky Simpson\n\nPhoebe Pryce as Skylar Bryce\n\nElliot Levey as Michael Townsend\n\nMatthew Durkan as Harvey Dean\n\nLauren Foster as Stacey Chandley\n\n​EastEnders: Episode 6204\n\nFriday 15 January 2021\n\nBBC One\n\n20:40\n\n​​​\n\nDevised by Julia Smith / Tony Holland\n\nWritten by Rashida Seriki\n\nDirected by Laurence Wilson\n\nSeries Producer: Sharon Batten\n\n​Executive Producer: Jon Sen\n\nWhen Denise hears the truth, she fears the worst.\n\nGray struggles with Karen's new role.\n\nKathy is distraught and at a loss for what to do next.\n\nIn the cafe, Martin is still on Cloud 9 about his news with Ruby.
