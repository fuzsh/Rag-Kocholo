SONIA Fowler makes a major decision after receiving heartbreaking pregnancy news in EastEnders.

The character - played by Natalie Cassidy - has been desperate to have a baby with partner Reiss Colwell in recent months.

The couple turned to IVF and thought they had been successful, but in sad scenes which aired this week, Sonia learned she hadn't been pregnant after all.

Tensions had risen at home as Reiss clashed with Sonia's sister Bianca, and Sonia also didn't feel well.

As her sister and partner were mid confrontation, Sonia started bleeding and was quickly rushed to hospital.

She had tests and a scan before the doctor told her: "I'm afraid there's no embryo. It's called a blighted ovum where it attaches to the uterus but doesn't develop into an embryo."

The couple were left devastated, but in upcoming EastEnders scenes, it's tense at No.25 as Reiss tries to support Sonia under the disapproving glare of Bianca.

Sonia reveals she wants to try IVF again, which Reiss agrees to, but he pales when she reveals that they need more money.

Reiss tries to persuade Jay to buy his car, but he refuses.

Becoming desperate for money, Reiss tells Kat that she didn’t pay her February tax bill in the hope of securing the funds, but he soon regrets his idea.

Bianca senses something is up after she speaks to Kat and Jay in The Vic, and follows Reiss to the care home where she overhears him asking Debbie for permission to borrow more money.

Reiss pales to realise Bianca has caught him red-handed.

Bianca is horrified by Reiss’ actions and gives him an ultimatum – he needs to tell Sonia or she will.

What will Reiss do? And how will Sonia react if he does tell her the truth?
