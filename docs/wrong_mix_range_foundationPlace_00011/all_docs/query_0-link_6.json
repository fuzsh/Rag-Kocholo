        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nPresident Joe Biden touched down in Mountain View’s Moffett Field Air Base on Thursday around 8 p.m., greeting the press with a wave. He is set to attend fundraising events for his reelection in Portola Valley and Palo Alto on Friday.\n\nSome Palo Alto schools say they plan to release students early around noon to prepare for traffic caused by the president’s visit.\n\nEn route, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reiterated to reporters that the purpose of the trip was purely campaign-related.\n\nBiden’s first fundraiser on Friday afternoon will be at tech entrepreneur Vinod Khosla’s home — who has given approximately $1.4 million to Democratic campaigns and organizations throughout this election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. Tickets to the fundraiser range from $6,600 and $100,000.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Biden is set to attend a Palo Alto reception hosted by former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and her husband DCVC Co-founder Zack Bogue. Ticket prices range from $30,000 to $50,000.\n\nFrom the Bay Area, he is then set to fly to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport Friday evening.\n\nThe president last visited the Peninsula in February to attend a fundraising event in Los Altos Hills."
