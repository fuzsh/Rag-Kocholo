        "text": "Below are post-adoption support services available to families who live in California. Services may not be available in all areas and/or may be dependent upon the circumstances of the placement. Please check with your post-adoption services provider about the availability of specific post-adoption or guardianship support services for your family. You can also visit Child Welfare Information Gateway for information on Adoption and Guardianship Assistance, as well as additional information on post-adoption support.\n\nOn this page:\n\nPost-adoption/guardianship support services\n\nParent support groups\n\nPost-adoption/guardianship support services\n\nIn California, adoptive families have access to the following services through a post-adoption support program:\n\nChild and youth assessments\n\nInformation (websites, fact sheets, articles, etc.)\n\nReferral to services\n\nTraining/other development\n\nBirth family mediation\n\nPeer support for parents\n\nPeer support for children/teens\n\nMentoring for parents\n\nMentoring for children/teens\n\nCase management\n\nEducational support\n\nRespite care\n\nCamps, retreats, or other events\n\nFinancial/material support\n\nCommunity-based therapeutic services\n\nIn-home therapeutic services\n\nResidential therapeutic services\n\nCrisis intervention\n\nThe specific services available may vary by county and depend on the needs of the child and the circumstances of the placement.\n\nWho is eligible for these services?\n\nFamilies who have adopted from the state’s foster care system\n\nFamilies who have adopted from another state’s foster care system\n\nFamilies who have adopted internationally or privately\n\nWho provides these services?\n\nPost-adoption services in California are provided through each county’s Department of Health and Human Services. The county public agency may provide services directly, or may contract with a private agency to provide support services to families. Find a list of county department websites at the County Welfare Directors Association website. You can find more information about available services at the California Department of Social Services, Adoption Resources website. The California Association of Adoption Agencies also has additional information on post-adoption services.\n\nParent support groups\n\nBelow are support groups for adoptive, kinship, and foster families. Support groups may be offered as part of a state’s post-adoption/guardianship support program, through a statewide or regional foster or adoptive parent association, through specific agencies, or may be run independently. If we have additional information about the group’s purpose or the community served, it’s provided under the group’s contact information.\n\nTo add a group or make a suggestion, email the AdoptUSKids family support team.\n\nStatewide association\n\nCalifornia State Foster Parent Association\n\nParent groups\n\nAdopt Salon Constellation Support Group -
