        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif. and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., Wednesday, November 19, 2014 – Yahoo Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) and Mozilla Corporation today announced a strategic five-year partnership that makes Yahoo the default search experience for Firefox in the United States on mobile and desktop. The agreement also provides a framework for exploring future product integrations and distribution opportunities to other markets.\n\nThe deal represents the most significant partnership for Yahoo in five years. As part of this partnership, Yahoo will introduce an enhanced search experience for U.S. Firefox users which is scheduled to launch in December 2014. It features a clean, modern and immersive design that reflects input from the Mozilla team.\n\n“We’re thrilled to partner with Mozilla. Mozilla is an inspirational industry leader who puts users first and focuses on building forward-leaning, compelling experiences. We’re so proud that they’ve chosen us as their long-term partner in search, and I can’t wait to see what innovations we build together,” said Marissa Mayer, Yahoo CEO. “At Yahoo, we believe deeply in search – it’s an area of investment, opportunity and growth for us. This partnership helps to expand our reach in search and also gives us an opportunity to work closely with Mozilla to find ways to innovate more broadly in search, communications, and digital content.”\n\n“Search is a core part of the online experience for everyone, with Firefox users alone searching the Web more than 100 billion times per year globally,” said Chris Beard, Mozilla CEO. “Our new search strategy doubles down on our commitment to make Firefox a browser for everyone, with more choice and opportunity for innovation. We are excited to partner with Yahoo to bring a new, re-imagined Yahoo search experience to Firefox users in the U.S. featuring the best of the Web, and to explore new innovative search and content experiences together.”\n\nTo learn more about this, please visit:\n\nhttp://yahoo.tumblr.com/1313\n\nAbout Yahoo\n\nYahoo is focused on making the world’s daily habits inspiring and entertaining.
