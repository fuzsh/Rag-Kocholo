        "text": "Sunnyvale, city, Santa Clara county, western California, U.S. Adjacent to the cities of Santa Clara and Mountain View, Sunnyvale lies at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, near San Jose. Settled in 1850, it was known as Murphy’s Station (later as Encinal), but it was renamed Sunnyvale in 1912 and developed as a fruit-processing centre. The city’s economic foundation shifted, however, when the U.S. Navy dirigible base, built nearby in the 1930s, and the expansion of the Joshua Hendy Iron Works (later Westinghouse Electric) in 1942 contributed to a developing industrial pattern, which now includes electronics (especially computer components and software) and the manufacture of guided missiles. A part of Silicon Valley, Sunnyvale experienced rapid growth in the late 20th century. Inc. 1912. Pop. (2010) 140,081; San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara Metro Area, 1,836,911; (2020) 155,805; San Jose–Sunnyvale–Santa Clara Metro Area, 2,000,468."
