While every prostate cancer diagnosis is unique, members of support groups often have similar feelings, worries, and concerns.\n\nUs TOO Support Groups are offered to patients, partners, and caregivers and provide a safe space to meet and discuss topics related to prostate cancer. The interactive format of a support group allows members to exchange information and ideas with the goal of empowering members with knowledge that comes from a shared experience."
