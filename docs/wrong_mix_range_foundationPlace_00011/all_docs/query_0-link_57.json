        "text": "You'll probably get loads of referrals, there are good doctors here in the Bay Area. :-) I cannot recommend Jan Rydfors highly enough. He delivered both our kids, with complications. He's in private practice, having been once practiced @ PAMF. He delivers almost exclusively at Stanford, and he wrote a v. popular book on obstetrics that the doctoring students @ Stanford love (just check him out on Amazon). If you want the best, or some of the best hands, Dr. Rydfors fits the bill. Oh, another thing, nurses (who you need to be on your side) just love him. They absolutely gush over him at the hospital. The down side to Dr. Rydfors.... he perpetually late for everything...except when the baby coming! :-) And his office is in Redwood City, about an 11 mile hike north from here. But he takes his time with you, and that is better than being rushed in and out. Now, if you really want someone local, I've also seen Dr. Sukhdeo @ PAMF, the Los Altos branch, a mere five minutes here. He's also v. good, and friends of mine have used him for both their kids (and Rydfors and Sukhdeo used to cover for each other). On the negative side, I've seen Dr. Cynthia Woo too - didn't click with her and most of my friends who used her didn't either. She's kinda young. In my water prenatal class, several women used Dr. Mason (I think her first name is Nancy). I don't know much about her, but our teacher and several of the students spoke v. highly of her. I think she is also in private practice. If Dr. Rydfors ever left the area, this is the doctor I would follow up with. Speaking of the water class, your wife should think about going to the CAR center (just on the other side of Middlefield and Charlston) for the Sat. AM prenatal water class. Very relaxing and a good way to meet other pregnant women. The instructor is an birthing expert at PAMF. Class is usually Saturdays at 9AM. Call CAR for specifics. It was about $12 drop in when I was going."
