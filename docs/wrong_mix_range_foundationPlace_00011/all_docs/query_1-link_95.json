Wilson leads OneJustice’s innovation work to bring life-changing legal help to those in need by transforming the civil legal aid system.

Ms. Wilson started her legal career in 1998 providing direct legal services to low-income children and families at the Legal Aid Society of San Mateo County, including as an Equal Justice Works Fellow and as Legal Aid’s inaugural Pro Bono Director. She then served as Executive Director of the Legal Aid Association of California (LAAC) before becoming OneJustice’s CEO in 2007. Ms. Wilson received a 2017 Leadership Award from the James Irvine Foundation, was named one of the 2012 Top 100 Lawyers in California by the Daily Journal for her leadership at OneJustice, and received a 2010 CLAY (California Lawyer of the Year) Award from California Lawyer magazine. She is proud to serve on the Board of Directors of Equal Justice Works and BoardSource.

After leaving the corporate world in 2005, he co-founded Global Mindshift, a non-profit offering online facilitated workshops on the essential skills we need to survive and thrive in today’s interconnected and interdependent world. In 2009 Kern brought both his corporate and non-profit experience to FeelGood—a college youth leadership program—joining them as director of education and strategic communications. In 2015, he and his FeelGood colleagues launched Crew 2030—now called the Enlight Collaborative—a non-profit initiative serving organizations focused on youth engagement.

Attending Coastal Studies for Girls (CSG), a marine science and leadership semester school in Maine as a sophomore, broadened her horizons. After seeing the positive effect CSG had on her life, Madi, in her speech, will be advocating for the integration of experiential education into the US schooling system.\n\nMarion Schleifer\n\nMarion Schleifer is 28 years old and lives in Zurich, Switzerland. Schleifer did her Bachelor in Multilingual Communication and her Master in Business Administration, and has work experience in both fields. She then decided to learn to program with self study, an internship and a Master in Software Engineering. Schleifer is now working as a Software Developer. When she started working in the tech industry, she soon realized that gender diversity is a large issue. She has never worked with a female developer until recently. Schleifer decided to take action on the issue and co-founded a free weekly programming course for women. Additionally, she co-founded Google’s Women Techmakers in Switzerland to provide a platform for women in tech and to attract new women to the tech industry.\n\nNaya Chang\n\nStudent\n\nNaya is a junior at Mountain View High School, an experience she surprisingly enjoys. She likes to #SupportTheArts by watching performances, attending museums, and listening to podcasts, and she makes art sculptures and dance pieces that could be called creative or just plain weird. Someday, Naya would like to teach US history, and for the time being, she's excited to talk about having pride in America without being pegged a nationalist.\n\nOlivia Porat\n\nStudent\n\nOlivia is a senior at Mountain View High School. She spends her time running the local streets with the cross country team, singing in MVHS’s very own A Cappella Choir, directing the Drama Llamas, and saving the Earth with Environmental Club. She hopes to pursue a future career in Biology and will talk your ear off about her four lovely cats. In her talk, Olivia will be discussing entitlement in her generation and how “Gen Y” can change their understanding of the word and subsequently their mindsets to take advantage of the individualistic culture into which they were born.\n\nReign LaFreniere\n\nReign LaFreniere is an 18 year old musician, actor, and film director attending the San Francisco Asawa School of the Arts for filmmaking.
