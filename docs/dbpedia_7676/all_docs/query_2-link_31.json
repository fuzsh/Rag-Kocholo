        "meta_description": "Theme &amp; Beat 01 by Mike Wallace, released 05 May 2024\n\n\nAfter 20+ years of amassing and absorbing various music from across the world, well respected DJ and rare record magnate Mike Wallace sold off a large portion of his album &amp; VHS collection, converted his home garage into a state of the art recording studio &amp; began learning to play a multitude of instruments. During this time he was also interning at a local recording studio to learn the back end process of putting together an album. Mike opens up the curtain with Theme &amp; Beat Vol. 1, the first in a series of film music inspired meanderings that reflect decades of dedication, introspection, joy and tranquility.\r\n\r\nTo listen to the songs, please refer to Mike Wallace&#39;s Bandcamp-Page:\r\n\r\nhttps://mikewallacepotions.bandcamp.com/album/theme-beat-01?label=3998158124&amp;tab=merch\r\n\r\nIf you would like to receive a digital download to your purchase of the vinyl issue, please get in touch.",
