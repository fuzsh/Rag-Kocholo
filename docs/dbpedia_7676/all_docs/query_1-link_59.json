In his four decades as the front man for 60 Minutes, the most successful show in television history,  Mike Wallace earned the distinction of being hyperaggressive, self-assured, and unflinching in his exposes of injustice and corruption. His unrivaled career includes interviews with every major newsmaker of the late twentieth century, from Martin Luther King to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.",
