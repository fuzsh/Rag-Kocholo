        "text": "Associated Press\n\nToday is the 129th day of 2018. There are 236 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn May 9, 1958, “Vertigo,” Alfred Hitchcock’s eerie thriller starring James Stewart and Kim Novak, premiered in San Francisco, the movie’s setting.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1754, a political cartoon in Benjamin Franklin’s Pennsylvania Gazette depicted a snake cut into eight pieces, each section representing a part of the American colonies; the caption read, “JOIN, or DIE.”\n\nIn 1814, the Jane Austen novel “Mansfield Park” was first published in London.\n\nIn 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, acting on a joint congressional resolution, signed a proclamation designating the second Sunday in May as Mother’s Day.\n\nIn 1918, CBS newsman Mike Wallace was born Myron Leon Wallace in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nIn 1926, Americans Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett supposedly became the first men to fly over the North Pole. (However, U.S. scholars announced in 1996 that their examination of Byrd’s flight diary suggested he had turned back 150 miles short of his goal.)\n\nIn 1936, Italy annexed Ethiopia.\n\nIn 1945, with World War II in Europe at an end, Soviet forces liberated Czechoslovakia from Nazi occupation. U.S. officials announced that a midnight entertainment curfew was being lifted immediately.\n\nIn 1961, in a speech to the National Association of Broadcasters, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Newton N. Minow decried the majority of television programming as a “vast wasteland.”\n\nIn 1978, the bullet-riddled body of former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro, who had been abducted by the Red Brigades, was found in an automobile in the center of Rome.\n\nIn 1980, 35 people were killed when a freighter rammed the Sunshine Skyway Bridge over Tampa Bay in Florida, causing a 1,400-foot section of the southbound span to collapse.\n\nIn 1994, South Africa’s newly elected parliament chose Nelson Mandela to be the country’s first black president.\n\nIn 2012, President Barack Obama declared his unequivocal support for same-sex marriage in a historic announcement that came three days after Vice President Joe Biden spoke in favor of such unions on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\nTen years ago: Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama picked up the backing of nine superdelegates, all but erasing Hillary Rodham Clinton’s once-imposing lead. Jury selection began in the Chicago trial of R&B superstar R. Kelly, accused of videotaping himself having sex with a girl as young as 13. (Kelly was later acquitted on all counts.) Journalist-feminist Nuala O’Faolain, who gained international fame with her outspoken memoir “Are You Somebody?” in 1966, died in Dublin, Ireland, at age 68.\n\nFive years ago: Afghan President Hamid Karzai (HAH’-mihd KAHR’-zeye), who had irked Washington with his frequent criticism of U.S. military operations in his country, said his government was ready to let the U.S. have nine bases across Afghanistan after the withdrawal of most foreign forces in 2014. A 72-foot-long, high-tech catamaran sailboat capsized in San Francisco Bay while practicing for the America’s Cup races, killing English Olympic gold medalist Andrew “Bart” Simpson. Malcolm Shabazz, 28, grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, died in Mexico City of blunt trauma injuries sustained in a bar dispute.\n\nOne year ago: President Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, ousting the nation’s top law enforcement official in the midst of an FBI investigation into whether Trump’s campaign had ties to Russia’s meddling in the election that sent him to the White House. The Senate confirmed Dr. Scott Gottlieb as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, 57-42. Moon Jae-in declared victory in South Korea’s presidential election after his two main rivals conceded. Actor Michael Parks (“Then Came Bronson”) died in Los Angeles at age 77.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Actor-writer Alan Bennett is 84. Actor Albert Finney is 82.

I cannot be dictated to by a watch.” — From “Mansfield Park” by Jane Austen (1775-1817)."
