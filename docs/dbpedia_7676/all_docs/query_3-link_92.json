        "text": "Mike Wallace, the hard-charging correspondent who was billed by CBS as America’s toughest interviewer on the long-running 60 Minutes newsmagazine, has died. He was 93.\n\nFile photo of Mike Wallace at the 2007 National Board of Review of Motion Pictures Awards Gala in New York. (By AP)\n\nWallace was deemed so vital to the success of 60 Minutes that CBS waived a mandatory retirement rule in his case as the newsman approached 65. He was a regular contributor for another 22 years, until he retired in May 2006 at age 88.\n\nNamed correspondent emeritus, Wallace kept an office at CBS and remained on call to its news division.\n\nHis broadcast career spanned 65 years, beginning in 1939 as a jack-of-all-trades at a radio station in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Wallace narrated The Lone Ranger radio scripts, pitched Parliament cigarettes on television, hosted quiz shows and even worked as an actor. He found his calling as a tough-guy interrogator on Night Beat, an interview programme that aired on a local New York television station in 1956.\n\nWallace quickly became known for his muckraking stories, ambush interviews and sit-downs with celebrities and heads of state. His suntanned, leathery face became the public image of 60 Minutes as the newsmagazine climbed in the Nielsen ratings and had an extraordinary 23-year run as a Top 10 show.\n\n“Everything good that happened to us happened because Mike was here from the beginning,” Hewitt told Broadcasting magazine in 1992, as the programme celebrated its 25th year on the air.\n\nIn his 2001 memoir, Hewitt described Wallace as a tiger, the kind of journalist who comes along once in a lifetime, and he hasn’t lost a step along the way. Hewitt, the creator of 60 Minutes and its executive producer for 35 years, died in August 2009.\n\nWallace’s work ethic was legend, and the pace took a toll on his personal life. He was thrice-divorced by 1985. Nonetheless, his two sons wanted to become journalists. The elder son, Peter, died at 19. Chris Wallace became a star correspondent for NBC and ABC, then host of the Sunday morning public-affairs programme, FOX News Sunday.\n\nDespite his tough-guy persona, Wallace was thin-skinned about his Hollywood portrayal in The Insider, a 1999 movie that suggested that he lost— before recovering—his moral compass on a 1995 story featuring tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand.\n\nHewitt blocked airing Wallace’s interview with Wigand on the advice of a CBS lawyer but permitted Wallace to report that decision, along with a small portion of the interview.\n\nMyron Leon Wallace was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on 9 May 1918, to Russian-Jewish immigrants Frank Wallace, a grocer and insurance broker, and the former Zina Sharfman. An immigration official had changed his father’s name from Friedan Wallak upon his arrival in the US at age 16, according to Wallace.\n\nWallace said he was never an A student. He played the violin and served as concertmaster in the Brookline High School orchestra and became captain of the tennis team.\n\nSevere acne plagued Wallace in high school, leaving scars that, in later years, would inspire TV critics to observe that Wallace’s “pockmarked, prizefighter’s face” served to enhance the abrasive tone of his interview, Gary Paul Gates wrote in Close Encounters, a memoir he co-wrote with Wallace in 1984.\n\nWallace enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1935, and discovered the student-run radio operation in his sophomore year. “All I wanted to be was a radio announcer, Wallace later recalled. I read a hell of a commercial.”\n\nAt his first radio job in Grand Rapids, he read the news, provided sports commentary and presented quiz shows.\n\nWallace moved to Detroit, where he was teamed with Douglas Edwards —later to become the first CBS television news anchor—as the two Cunningham News Aces on WXYZ. Wallace also served as an announcer and narrator for The Green Hornet and The Lone Ranger, two popular dramas. He married Norma Kaphan, whom he had dated when both were undergraduates at Michigan. The marriage, which produced sons Peter and Christopher, ended in divorce in 1948.\n\nA member of the US Naval Reserve, Wallace was trained as a communications officer and served two years in the Pacific on a submarine tender during World War II.\n\nIn Chicago after the war, Wallace worked for The Air Edition of the Chicago Sun, for which he was encouraged to report and write, not just read the news. As the interviewer for WGN radio’s Famous Names, he met actress Buff Cobb, who became his second wife in 1949.\n\nThe two became co-hosts of a Chicago radio interview show that attracted the attention of CBS television executives in 1951. At 33, Wallace moved with his wife to New York to host an afternoon television programme for CBS called Mike and Buff. The talk show ended in 1954, along with the marriage.\n\nWallace landed a local news-anchor job at Channel 5 in New York. He also met and married artist Lorraine Perigord, in a union that would last 30 years before ending in divorce. Wallace assumed responsibility for her two children, Pauline and Anthony, from a previous marriage.\n\nHe said frequent travel harmed his third marriage. In 1986, he married Mary Yates, the widow of his former associate Ted Yates, who had died in Jerusalem while covering the Six-Day War in 1967."
