        "text": "A few of our readers reminded us that today is the 73rd anniversary of the birth of legendary Cuban singer “La Lupe.”\n\nGuadalupe Victoria Yolí Raymond (1939-1992)—“La Lupe” or “La Yiyiyi,” as the singer was also known— has been described as a cross between Edith Piaf, Eartha Kitt, Olga Guillot, Tina Turner, Nina Simone, but for her followers, she was ‘the Queen of Latin Soul.’ She was born on December 23, 1939, in Cuba and died on February 29, 1992.\n\nLa Lupe, known for “her high level of camp and her energetic performances” (IMDb), was known for pulling her hair, attacking the piano player, and tearing off her accessories, wig, or sometimes even her clothes, while singing. She became the first Latina to perform at Carnegie Hall in 1969.\n\nShe recorded over 23 albums; among her many hits, her most popular songs are “Puro teatro,” “La Tirana,” “Qué te pedí,” and the Spanish-language version of “My Way,” “Como acostumbro.”\n\n[Many thanks for the reminder and the photo above to Eddie Rosa Padilla and Tes-Teatro en Sepia (http://www.facebook.com/#!/tes.teatroensepia)]\n\nFor a biography in Spanish, see http://www.americasalsa.com/biografias/lalupe.html"
