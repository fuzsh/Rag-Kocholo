        "text": "I welcome music that inspires homework. When it comes to appreciating the repertoire of Miguel Zenón, the extra credit assignments are entirely pleasurable. Contextual awareness isn’t necessary to appreciate the saxophonist’s extraordinary improvisations and delectable embrace of melody, but it certainly helps. The six selections on El Arte Del Bolero, a new duet album he recorded with the pianist Luis Perdomo 14 weeks ago, are interpretations of vintage material. As with Zenón’s albums Sonero: The Music of Ismael Rivera (2019) and Alma Adentro (2011), an understanding of El Arte Del Bolero is enhanced by familiarity with the original versions. Here are links to the acutely romantic songs: Benny Moré- \"Como Fue\", Sylvia Rexach- \"Alma Adentro\", Ray Barretto- \"Ese Hastío\" aka “Piensa En Mi”, Arsenio Rodriguez- “La Vida Es Un Sueño”, La Lupe- \"Que Te Pedí\" and Cheo Feliciano- “Juguete”. Benny Moré is among the referenced artists who have long infused my life with joy, but I know pitifully little about La Lupe, the electrifying performer once billed as the Queen of Latin Soul. Thank you, Zenón and Perdomo, for the wonderful El Arte Del Bolero and for furthering my musical education. Adult learning has rarely been more rewarding.\n\n---"
