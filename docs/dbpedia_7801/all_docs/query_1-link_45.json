        "text": "Anna Gaca, Associate Editor: I actually found this track because KeiyaA covered it on her album: Prince’s nine-minute-long version of his song “Do Yourself a Favor” (first recorded by Jesse Johnson), from the 2019 super-deluxe edition of 1999. The first half is this jaunty, see-ya-never breakup jam; the second half is a masterclass in ad-libs. At one point, you hear Prince flub a line—or maybe it’s on purpose?—and the whole persona turns a corner into this bitter, tipsy rant, like they’re just starting shit to try and conceal how vulnerable and definitely not over it they really are. It feels completely spontaneous, so it never gets old. Sometimes I’ll take a walk and listen four times in a row.\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa; Visuals Editor, Social Video Content: In early April, I devised a bike route throughout New York City that would become my morning routine. Greenpoint to Long Island City to Midtown to the Lower East Side to Williamsburg back to Greenpoint. At this point of the pandemic, Manhattan was a shell of itself. The familiar rhythm of the streets—the frantic horns, the subway roar, the pedestrian cacophony—had vanished. The city’s hum was replaced by the maddening whir of overlapping sirens.\n\nAs I biked freely down empty streets, Grouper’s “Headache” became my guide. Liz Harris opens the song with a story of her mother walking into the ocean to get a closer look at the horizon. I felt a similar magnetism to Manhattan on my morning rides. In this new New York City, the constant rapids of Broadway had calmed into a still river. I was alone, I couldn’t see a horizon, and my head hurt. Like Harris, I was tired of being lonely. I would fool myself into believing that by the time my birthday came around in June, I’d be back to working, eating, dating, dancing, living.\n\nYet my pessimism kept me grounded, and as Harris reminded me in “Headache,” error lies in hoping. She ends each verse with questions of self-doubt: Why is this costume weighing me down? Why does love keep letting me down? I’ve often suffered from the headache born out of these unanswerable questions. As a result, my therapist told me to never ask myself questions that begin with the word “why.” I asked why not. She said “why” implies there is a solution at hand, but often there isn’t. But I sometimes find it comforting to dwell in “why.” I understand that it is ultimately unproductive, but there’s a perverse pleasure in pity: “Why is this happening to me?” “Why” becomes a mantra as I allow these questions to lull me into festering hypnosis. Why is this costume—this body, this mask, this nation—weighing me down? Why does love—and life—keep letting me down? At times this year, with no horizon in sight, I chose to live with a headache.\n\nNoah Yoo, Staff Writer: One of my favorite songs to come out in 2020 was released at least 16 years after its recording. The Blue Nile’s “Here Come the Bluebirds,” the closing bonus track from the recent reissue of their final album High, instantly snared me. “It’s you and I, against the world,” Paul Buchanan nearly whispers at the start of the song, his voice cracking as he stretches out those simple words as far as they can go. It arrived just as New York City was coming out of its three-month lockdown, right before protests in the face of rampant police murder began to erupt here and around the world. During a year soundtracked by sirens, there was no chorus more apt to me than: “Here come the bluebirds/Here come the police cars/Look at our neighbors/Is it all for me and you?”\n\nKatie Philo, Senior Social Media Manager: Both Laura Marling and I turned 30 this year. As a fellow Brit, I’ve listened to her music since I was a teenager and have grown deeply attached to each of her records. Song for Our Daughter, her seventh studio album, quickly became a companion on my frosty and isolated morning walks around Brooklyn at the start of lockdown. On a personal level, it felt like a comforting embrace with an old friend—especially when living in a country that is not my own. The album is quintessentially Laura Marling: wonderfully assembled and mixed, with her voice and lyrics taking center stage. Written as a conceptual album to an imaginary child in her quest to understand what it is to be a woman, the songs are bejeweled with intricate tales, literary references, and poignant moments for pause. I found new meaning every time I plugged in and took it for a stroll, making it the perfect soundtrack to solitude.\n\nHow has your relationship with music changed this year?\n\nSam Sodomsky: This is the year I finally got into the game of making hyper-specific playlists for every moment of my life. Maybe it’s because I spent all year in my apartment, so it was easier to curate the music supervision to my own boring reality show. For whatever reason, it became a constant fixture. It also ended up being a nice way to reconnect with my teen self who compulsively burned mix CDs from iTunes. I even tried to replicate the sound of that era with a playlist I titled Nostalgia Pins and filled with mid-to-late-2000s indie-rock heavy hitters. Like Kenny Chesney says, when I hear those songs, I go back.\n\nRyan Kincaid: Around month two of lockdown, I started a project in which I chose a few artists every day and listened to their entire discographies from beginning to end. I listened to about 350 different albums over the course of a month, and it gave me something different to look forward to every day. The Groundhog Day effect of the pandemic slowly loosened its grip as I escaped into the worlds created by each artist: the Champagne kiss-laden lounges of Jessie Ware, the Avalanches’ sunny paradise, the languid and dreamy landscapes of Chromatics. I shattered my habit of building and relying on playlists to create my own worlds out of music and began spending time in the ones already built and arranged for me.\n\nIsabelia Herrera: As a writer and fan, music has always been at the center of my personal, professional, and intellectual life. In a year loaded with so many individual and collective challenges—self-isolation, political upheaval, my mother’s stroke—I was pushed to think against the protocols of how I’ve been taught to listen. I had to stop thinking about music in simple terms—as utility, as community, or as art. I started to rethink how I write about music, and what the “point” of writing about it is—whether my role is to provide information, offer critique, or harness the complex, layered experiences music can bring us. It forced me to try and open up my writing practice a bit. I stopped trying to be perfect, to “capture it all.” I don’t know if I have or will ever find a satisfying alternative, but this year allowed me to lead with experiences and encounters of music rather than the pressure to be definitive.\n\nAnna Gaca: I’ve found it almost impossible to engage with music this year. I set out trying to be very purposeful—I started making my best-of list in January! Then the pandemic knocked everything sideways: I lost all my normal contexts for listening (work, gym, commute) and all the people I’d usually discuss it with and replaced them with a lot of stunned silence. The anxiety of life in 2020 diminished my mental capacity and made it much harder to multitask, even something as simple as editing a review of an album while also listening to it. I’ll restart the same song over and over, or hit pause and forget for hours. I can’t keep up with my usual listening; I feel like I’m constantly failing. I love music, but it’s been a source of tremendous frustration.\n\nAllison Hussey: Music has always been central to my social life in various ways, and it’s been painful to feel so disconnected from that this year. But I found another kind of communion in having deeper, more solitary listening experiences. I’ve spent much more time digging into the context and history of what I’ve listened to, learning more about who played on what, when, and how it happened. This approach has illuminated more of the connections shared among people, sounds, and ideas that are meaningful to me, which has provided a unique comfort and intensified my emotional connection to music.\n\nQuinn Moreland: I had to do some self-reflection before I could attempt to answer this question. Did my relationship to music change? Have I changed? Are those the same things? The answer to all of the above is yes. With my life essentially restricted to a one-bedroom apartment, I’ve really tried to focus on finding the things in my life—and in my control—that make me happy. Sometimes it’s not music. More often than not those comforts have been sewing, crying over episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or a long book about anything other than music. My struggle to listen to music for pleasure is definitely a direct result of the confusing collapse between my work and personal lives, something I will definitely unpack if and when I find a therapist. I look forward to rekindling my relationship with music, if she will have me.\n\nWhat was the most inspired use of music in a TV show or film this year?\n\nEvan Minsker: In the essential What We Do in the Shadows episode “On the Run,” the British vampire Laszlo Cravensworth (played by Matt Berry) has to run away and start anew as a small-town bartender. He changes his name to Jackie Daytona and brags about his brilliant American disguise, which is literally just what he always wears plus jeans and a toothpick. Robert Palmer’s “Simply Irresistible” plays over a montage of Laszlo settling into his new life seamlessly—dancing with townies, driving a pickup truck, and becoming legitimately obsessed with high school volleyball. He charmed everyone in town, and now his de facto theme song consists of a slick Brit singing about a beautiful grifter. It’s perfect, and “Simply Irresistible” is still stuck in my head.\n\nMatthew Ismael Ruiz: I can’t be sure what my actual last show was, but the last one I remember was Chubby & the Gang opening for Hank Wood & the Hammerheads at Market Hotel. A friend was complaining about the crowd’s high bro quotient, and Chubby’s set was cut nearly in half by technical difficulties. But it served as an excellent reminder of how even a great record can only tell half a band’s story: Chubby’s rowdy band of hooligans turned out to be a gang of fresh-faced teens led by a grizzled punk veteran who’d played only a handful of shows together. The set was rough, raw, and bursting with energy, a rare look at a baby band in the process of coalescing. Hank Wood, a scene stalwart that has no trouble commanding an entire room—and tearing it down in the process—was predictably excellent. But Chubby’s set was most memorable in its imperfections, a reminder that even the best music is still made by humans, who rarely arrive fully formed.\n\nDrew Litowitz: As somebody who frequents mostly smaller shows, seeing Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Jonathan Richman co-headline Manhattan’s Town Hall was the perfect anomaly to help me remember live music. It felt oddly like the inverse of quarantine: an audience full of people one could argue “don’t get out much” watching these loveable but reclusive oddballs play a cavernous, old-world concert hall. On a classical guitar, Richman endeared the crowd with Italian poetry and stories of summer nights filled with red wine and water gun fights, inviting us into his unexpectedly vast world of language, history, and the human experience. Then Oldham and frequent collaborator Emmett Kelly arrived delightfully scruffy, their nimble acoustic guitars and fine-tuned harmonies pouring into the hall with the comfort and ease of a living room. It was the odd night on the town for the couch-listening set. It felt like home. From my actual home, I think of it often.\n\nNoah Yoo: It’s taken me months to stop thinking about the last concert I saw before lockdown. The show was Destroyer, with Nap Eyes opening, at Brooklyn Steel. I remember looking up at Dan Bejar and thinking he was the coolest guy in the world, totally uninterested in any performative engagement with the crowd and simply living within his songs as he brought them to life. If I focus really hard, I can feel the elation I felt at the synth intro to “It Just Doesn’t Happen” and the memory of holding some of my best friends’ shoulders as we danced to “Chinatown.” We never talked about whether it would be the last concert we’d attend that year; maybe we were afraid of speaking it into reality. Instead, we crashed a friend’s house party and cracked uneasy jokes about how we probably shouldn’t be standing so close to one another.\n\nMarc Hogan, Senior Staff Writer: It stands out because it was so ordinary. I went with two wonderful friends, a married couple I’ve known for 11 years, to see the Black Lips on a Sunday night. I remember we drove on the freeway for a single exit even though the venue, a 700-capacity space called Wooly’s, is within walking distance of my home. The Atlanta garage-rock veterans once played a festival here in Des Moines, and it was one of those shows where half the people you know (and vaguely know) seem to be there. This time, the Lips were mainly doing songs from their solid, country-tinged new album, Sing in a World That’s Falling Apart, but I can recall being thrilled to hear “Cold Hands,” too, off of old favorite Good Bad Not Evil. This was March 8. The bass player was still spitting onstage and diving into the crowd. The venue is one of the lucky ones still open, but I haven’t been there—or seen those friends—in the nine months since.\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa: Back in the hopeful days of January, my friend and I attended a sold-out Ambient Church show at Bushwick United Methodist. Each performance was accompanied by videos projection-mapped onto the stained glass. We sat in the balcony for JAB’s set, a mesmerizing flute-driven composition complemented with a nature walk through an airy forest. We moved to the floor before Ana Roxanne took the stage, where she stood at the altar like she was about to deliver a sermon. Flanked by projections of the moon’s surface, she opened with “Nocturne,” and I could feel the bass reverberate in my chest. After she played “Suite pour l'invisible,” the video projections stopped and she pulled out a notebook. As sounds of waves crashed through the church, she read the text that opens “Venus,” a rumination on the ontology of water. “Merging water moves fluidly from one form to another,” she said. “Easily transitioning from cloud to raindrop to sea. Forever changing form, but not essence.” Later, Don Slepian performed his masterpiece “Sea of Bliss” as bright animations by artist Nicole Ginelli ushered me through a new dimension. I was still considering water; how drops can barely travel before being absorbed into puddles. Within the church, we were beads of water pooled together. Afterward, we would disperse to find new puddles.\n\nAdam Krefman: The last shows I went to were our festival kick-off parties in Chicago. It was a killer lineup and a really beautiful room that our team made look like a weirdo high school dance. A lot of people who work on Pitchfork Music Festival were there just to hang out and celebrate. Without the dark filter of hindsight, it was just a beautiful couple of evenings with great music and friends. I’m not sure if I could’ve picked a better “last” concert.\n\nWhat were your substitutes for live music this year?\n\nJenn Pelly: There is no substitute, but I did see two small, socially-distanced outdoor shows this fall, and the first one stirred up waves of feeling in me that I hope to remember forever. I hadn’t been to a show in nearly six months—my longest break from show-going since I was 13—when I caught three improvised sets in a parking lot near the Red Hook ferry. I would like to say that I had not forgotten the way music electrifies the air and creates connections with everyone around you at a show; or how powerful it can feel to witness the resourcefulness and adaptability of underground music play out, soundtracking its own survival; or how live music just makes you long to inch your way ever closer to it, especially during a seated show. But the rhythms of this show reminded me.\n\nThe final set was by the noise artist Charmaine Lee. She assembled her small array of pedals in the glow of a clamp light; the Manhattan skyline was in the distance, and it grew dark, and the buildings and the river harmonized incandescently, as they do. Lee is a practitioner of extended vocal technique and she made noise with her whole body: Her mouth, her chest, amplifying her pulsating breath, pushing her life source into the red. I felt more attuned than usual to how physical and vulnerable live music can be—like all the time away had sharpened my perception—and how at a show someone is always putting herself on the line. I felt grateful to see improvised music in an improvised setting because all year, life had been daily improv. I felt a renewed sense of the shock and wonder I’d known so often when I started going to shows as a kid. Lee said she hadn’t done this in front of people in six months, and I thought of everyone else at this late-summer gig who was, like me, making a profound if fleeting return. Another feeling came back: on a Thursday night in New York City, to share an experience with a stranger.\n\nJillian Mapes: In October, my boyfriend hatched a miraculous plan to put on safe, socially distanced karaoke on a friend’s roof, laying the groundwork for the best Halloween of my life. Each person or couple had their own mic (available cheaply online), which was plugged into a practice amp. Lyrics were projected onto the building next door, and the karaoke videos came via YouTube’s robust array (a few recommended accounts), with friends adding to a playlist ahead of time for easy access. The “stage” area was clearly marked away from the “crowd” area. With a few guidelines in place, my friends fully snapped when it came time to perform: Peaches’ “Fuck the Pain Away” sang-spoke in an effortlessly taunting tone; a robot shuffle across the roof set to the chorus of Beastie Boys’ “Intergalactic”; deadpan jokes asking for cash amid the Flying Lizards’ cover of “Money”; crooning about Tennessee whiskey and wailing over old flames and spontaneous dance breaks set to onscreen captions like “(air trumpet).” Some of the people I missed the most ended up putting on the closest thing I got to a show in seven months. I’m still dreaming of it like others are their last pre-pandemic concert, eagerly awaiting the first warm weekend this spring.\n\nJazz Monroe: Concerts are great for twisting the lens on songs new and old, but what I really miss is the mix of catharsis and frivolous socializing. The nearest approximation took place in my own living room, where my partner and I would play musical ping-pong: each choosing a song inspired, as tangentially as we pleased, by the previous selection. When it worked, the soundtrack would zip from Otis Redding to João Gilberto to Christina Aguilera in the time it takes to throw back a boulevardier. When it did not, we would flail in the quicksand of the world’s most stubborn genres. Ultimately, the drear of lockdown made even the misadventures welcome. There is no substitute for a concert, but a jukebox in a bar is the next best thing—and what better simulation than having all your favorite songs derailed by a barrage of nu-metal?\n\nAllison Hussey: My dream is an all-day smorgasbord of Magik Markers, 75 Dollar Bill, Endless Boogie, and the Sun Ra Arkestra to power-wash away the terrible gunk of 2020. Big, gorgeous walls of sound that rattle every atom. Then bring it back down to earth with the Necks, who I had hoped to see in New York at the end of March, which got pushed to the beginning of August, which got pushed to [incoherent wailing].\n\nRyan Kincaid: A Daft Punk “Alive 2021: Around the World One More Time Tour” would be ideal, but if I’m not able to manifest that, I might spend way too much on resale Chromatica Ball tickets. I can’t imagine a better way to end the pandemic than losing my mind to “Rain on Me” in a sweaty, packed, queer-as-hell crowd, completely overstimulated, screaming at the top of my lungs. Droplets? Everywhere. If I can’t catch a rocket to Chromatica, I’d happily enjoy a slightly-more-subdued evening with Róisín Murphy. However, I’m not sure any artist will be the lone main attraction when live music safely returns. Every musician will be co-headlining with the excitement of being around new people again.\n\nWhat loss from the music world in 2020 hit you the hardest and why?\n\nAndy Cush: “Influential” doesn’t quite cover it when you’re talking about Toots Hibbert, the singer-songwriter for Toots and the Maytals who died after hospitalization with COVID-19-like symptoms in September. This is the guy who’s responsible for the fact that we call it reggae music and was still out there, living, grooving, singing, shining beams of joy on audiences all over the world. As far as I can tell, the Maytals played their last concert on February 22, about a month before U.S. cities and states began issuing pandemic shutdown orders. This is how things were for Toots, an unstoppable music machine well into his 70s. He took time off from playing live after a fan threw a liquor bottle that struck him in the face and gave him a concussion in 2013—at the ripe age of 70—but resumed touring more or less constantly three years later.\n\nJazz Monroe: If you had told me in January that 2020 would be the year production slowed, transport ground to a halt, and conservatives approved radical economic intervention, I might have wept with relief: “Finally, a proper rethink of climate strategy!” As pandemic fatigue spreads, the opposite reality beckons, and I think we all understand how easy it would be to regress—to swallow the disastrous logic that this blip demands a hasty return to hyper-capitalism. The survival of concert infrastructure is essential, but how we use it, particularly in terms of travel, has to change. We belong to a field whose goals should dovetail with green policy and workplace transformation: The less we buy, the less we needlessly produce, and so the less people must work—meaning more time to indulge and invest in arts and leisure. The moment to implement this stuff is now before we reawaken the beast.\n\nAmy Phillips: Finally cut the cord (literally) and start using wireless headphones. Spend some quality time with the Kate Bush, Sade, and Fugazi discographies. Buy more stuff on Bandcamp. Alphabetize and properly shelve the piles of vinyl lying around my apartment. Go to as many shows as possible, god willing.\n\nMarc Hogan: My resolution is to continue to find new music that inspires me and feels special and meaningful enough that I have no choice but to harangue everyone I know about it. I’ve imagined I was washed every year since my early 20s, since before people used the word “washed,” but this year seemed harder than most for connecting with music that wasn’t directly part of my daily work. If I can nurture some private obsession in 2021 that the rest of the staff gets sick of having me DM them about, that seems like a worthy and achievable resolution. Or maybe Air France could just reunite?\n\nArjun Ram Srivatsa: Buy more music. I need to wean myself off of Spotify and just listen to things in my collection. It’s the least I could do.\n\nKatie Philo: I reignited my last.fm profile this year because, well, I had time to get into the numbers and wanted a dose of 2010 nostalgia. You don’t need to be a statistician to note that I like to spin the same records over and over again. At least there’s a clear explanation for it this year: Dealing with uncertainty, you often grip to things that feel familiar and safe, which explains why I listened to Waxahatchee’s Saint Cloud and Phoebe Bridgers’ Punisher on repeat. Of course, I love discovering and listening to new music—I just tend to scurry back to the female-led-indie-rock-shaped hole from which I emerged. Next year, I want to hang with old friends like Phoebe but also spend more time getting acquainted with new or unfamiliar-to-me artists and genres. I vow to pass the aux cord and surf the wave of another’s taste for a while. After all, they say the magic happens outside the comfort zone.\n\nAdam Krefman: When live music comes back: Don’t fence-sit about going to a show. Just go!"
