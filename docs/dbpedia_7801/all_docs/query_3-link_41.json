        "text": "Musical Mondays\n\nConnecting Communities With Music\n\nSearch for:\n\nWeek 84\n\nErik Alejandro Rodriguez, better known as Cimafunk, is one of the most popular new talents from Cuba. His music incorporates distinct Afro-Cuban rhythms with modern funk, pop, and electronic styles to construct a new genre in the island’s music scene. Cimafunk’s name refers to his heritage as a ‘Cimarrón,’ Cubans of African descent who resisted and escaped slavery, as well as the influence from rhythm and blues and soul music. He performed on NPR’s tiny desk in February of this year.\n\nWeek 83\n\nEach year from September 15 to October 15, National Hispanic Heritage Month is recognized in the U.S by celebrating the histories, cultures, and contributions of those whose ancestors hail from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. In the spirit of Musical Monday, we proudly share the 1972 documentary film from Fania Records titled Our Latin Thing (Nuestra Cosa) about the captivating Latin music scene in New York City. Please enjoy the music and we hope you have a good week.\n\nWeek 82\n\nFor today’s Musical Monday, we pay tribute to Julián Martínez (Tony Show), who passed away yesterday in the Dominican Republic. He was a master teacher of dance and promotor of Dominican culture who worked with several of our service-learning groups. We thank Tony for his contributions to his community and send our deepest condolences to his family.\n\n————-\n\nPara el Lunes Musical de hoy, rendimos homenaje a Julián Martínez (Tony Show), fallecido ayer en República Dominicana. Fue un maestro de danza y promotor de la cultura dominicana que trabajó con varios de nuestros grupos de aprendizaje-servicio. Agradecemos a Tony por sus contribuciones a su comunidad y enviamos nuestro condolencias a su familia.\n\nWeek 81\n\nMany people have heard of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico. Although, most probably have not heard of its founder, Rafael Ithier Nadal. He was born in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, into a musical family; first learning the guitar and then mastering the piano. By 1962, Ithier founded El Gran Combo with some of the remaining members from the orchestra, “Cortijo y su Combo”. Over 50 years and countless hit records later and the group is still performing. Incredibly, Ithier is the only remaining member from the band’s original lineup, albeit select performances. In 2016, Ithier celebrated his 90th birthday and was interviewed by a news outlet where he attributed the success El Gran Combo to their great discipline.\n\nWeek 80\n\nEl Roockie is a Panamanian reggae artist best known for rhythmic deliveries of profound lyrics, earning him the nickname King of Lyrics and Maquina de Lirica. Since his entry into the music scene in 1996, El Roockie has gained international popularity with his lyrical portrayal of injustice, inequality, and relatable love songs. To listen to the El Roockie and similar artists, check out our playlist Spanish Fly: A collection of Latinx/Urban from Spain, Panama, and the Caribbean.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kQh9FutngWx7EqAakv2Dl?si=jcdUuV7jQ1uWRkYNG8F-OA\n\nWeek 79\n\nRichard Steven Valenzuela was born in 1941 in Los Angeles California. By 1958, he would go on to adapt a Mexican folk song called “La Bamba’ into a hit rock and roll song and inspire generations of future musicians. Better known by the name the Ritchie Valens, he is remembered today as a pioneering musician of the Spanish speaking rock and roll movement. Tragically, his career and life were cut short on February 3, 1959, on what has become known as “The Day the Music Died”. Valens, along with fellow musicians Buddy Holly and J. P. “The Big Bopper” Richardson, were all killed when their plane crashed in Iowa. Despite the devastating loss, Valens remains immortalized in his songs, through those he inspired to play music, and through those who continue to listen.\n\nWeek 78\n\nIt is no accident repetition is an integral part of the music. Since the beginning of rhythm, musicians have used basic psychology to turn listeners into fans. Following the principles of the “exposure effect”, the use of repetition in music allows listeners to be active participants by singing along with a recurring phrase or following the beat. Rather than passively listening, this phenomenon of pattern recognition engages us and is one reason music can so profoundly affect emotional states. For deeper dive into why we love repetition in music, check out the video below.\n\nWeek 77\n\nBefore Elvis, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and The Beatles, there was a woman named Sister Rosetta Tharpe who helped found, shape, and inspire the genre of rock ‘n’ roll as we know it today. In October of 1938 at age 23, Tharpe recorded for the first time with Decca Records, proving her an overnight sensation and one of the first commercially successful gospel recording artists. Later referred to as “the original soul sister” and “the Godmother of rock and roll, Tharpe pioneered the use of heavy distortion on an electric guitar and profoundly influenced the growth of British blues in the 1960s. In December of 2017, Sister Rosetta Tharpa was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nWeek 76\n\n“Here’s a seemingly simple question: Can musicians in quarantine play music together over an Internet connection? We’ve migrated birthday parties, happy hours and church services to video calls these days, so couldn’t we do the same with band practice? Across ubiquitous video conferencing tools like Zoom, FaceTime and Skype, it takes time for audio data to travel from person to person. That small delay, called latency, is mostly tolerable in conversation — save for a few overlapping stutters — but when it comes to playing music online with any kind of rhythmic integrity, latency quickly becomes a total dealbreaker.”\n\nWeek 75\n\nToday we bring you a collaboration from the Comunidad Connect community. This performance of ‘Three Little Birds’ by Bob Marley is brought to you by past CC volunteers to the Dominican Republic LaBrittany Koger and Artis Trice, CC staff, and our good friend Luis Gutierrez in Jinotega, Nicaragua. Thank you everyone for being a part of this project – it will certainly not be the last! Let us know if you or someone you know would like to join us for our next production. We are inviting all musicians, singers, and audio engineers to get involved – the more the merrier!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=303826794320780&extid=c0dpSt0gxM0QQvX2\n\nWeek 74\n\nThe Dimensión Latina was founded in 1972 in Caracas, Venezuela by six young musicians: Jose “Joseíto” Rodríguez (musical director and timbales player), pianist Enrique “Culebra” Iriarte, trombonists César “Albóndiga” Monges and José Antonio “Rojitas” Rojas, congas player Elio Pacheco and a vocalist that would soon become one of the most popular and influential singers and musicians in the history of Latin music in the American continent: the singer and bass player Oscar D’León. Together the group would take the world by storm, earning great success in Latin America, Europe and the United States. It is estimated that Dimensión Latina sold about 30 million records, with more than 3000 live presentations during its long and productive history. With an incredible discography of hit songs, its no surprise we keep coming back to listen again and again. See below for one of our favorites.\n\nWeek 73\n\nOn this day in 1957, John Lennon and Paul McCartney met for the first time at a gig where Lennon’s band, The Quarrymen, were performing. Eager to impress, Paul played two songs for John, as well as show him how to tune his guitar, something Jon had been paying someone else to do for him. Whether destiny or happenstance, it is stories like these that remind us to embrace each day and be bold, for our connection with others can lead to unimaginable destinations. We hope you have a good and productive week!\n\nWeek 72\n\nIn addition to featuring well-known and rising artists, NPR’s Tiny Desk holds a contest each year where musicians from across the U.S can submit original songs for a chance to perform live on the platform in Washington D.C. Given the unique circumstances of 2020, the Tiny Desk team created a compilation video to show off the incredible talent, diversity, and creativity in this year’s pool of entrants. Please enjoy the video below and look out for the winner to be announced on July 2nd.\n\nHere’s the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest by the numbers:\n\n-50 states were represented in this year’s entries — plus Washington, D.C, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\n-421 artists entered this year who have entered the Contest at least three times before.\n\n-379 artists filmed their entries in the great outdoors.\n\n-166 artists included animal friends in their entries.\n\n-29% of entries came in on the very last day.\n\n-Over 400 entries were filmed during stay-at-home orders with band members in different locations.\n\n-13 songs included a reference to social-distancing distance in their title\n\n-422 entries featured houseplants.\n\n-2 of this year’s entries featured theremins.\n\nWeek 71\n\nGrupo Niche was founded in Cali Colombia in 1978 under the direction of bandleader, Jairo Varela, who remained in the group until his death in 2012. Arguably one of the most popular groups in the history of Colombia, Grupo Niche is known for making incredible salsa music with magnificent rhythms and harmonies. In an article written by Latino Life, C. Mackenize writes, “Grupo Niche is to Colombia as Motown is to the US by probably being the first commercially successful Colombian band to be proudly black. Even the name Niche means ‘of African Origin’ and the groups’ pride in Cali and in black culture bursts through their famous anthems and lyrics.” With over 25 albums and counting, we highly recommend this group for guaranteed dancing and enjoyment. Have a listen to their legendary song, Cali Pachanguero, and we hope you have a good day.\n\nWeek 70\n\nToday’s music comes in the form of a curated playlist by Comunidad Connect board member, Dr. Roberto A Vargas. Featuring artists like James Brown, Donny Hathaway, Gil Scott-Heron, and many more, this a setlist you do not want to miss! Thanks for listening and we hope you have a good Monday.\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/6YT8P85CcviQgF2jJCScaj?si=3AlUHUx7SDihdpyZr3R21Ahttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/podcasts/1619-black-american-music-appropriation.html?fbclid=IwAR3P2zP9FtATSWgyq1iX19NB-0hcjCABBbGyUJPfYI7LSNnisQqgcE1yHOU\n\nWeek 69: The Birth of American Music\n\nThe “1619 Project” audio series is an initiative from the New York Times observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. For Centuries, black music has been an expression of artistic freedom. In this episode, Wesley Morris examines the history of American Music and the legacy of African influence on artistic expression in the United States.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/podcasts/1619-black-american-music-appropriation.html?fbclid=IwAR3P2zP9FtATSWgyq1iX19NB-0hcjCABBbGyUJPfYI7LSNnisQqgcE1yHOU\n\nWeek 68:\n\nOver the past few months, music has been an essential source of expression and distraction for many people across the world. Today we lift up Beto Deejay and his quarantine salsa sessions from his home in Bogota, Colombia for helping to light the way. With 26 videos and counting, we are consistently impressed with his deep discography and excellent grooves. Thank you, Beto for the music!\n\nWeek 67:\n\nBorn in Santurce, Puerto Rico in 1931, Ismael Rivera grew up expressing himself through song and rhythm with his best friend Rafael Cortijo. Together, they would reach international stardom and Rivera would become known as the “El Sonero Mayor” (The Greatest Sonero) because of his “extraordinary talent for improvisation and impressive command of the clave”. With an impressive discography full of amazing music and thoughtful lyrics, Ismael Rivera remains one of all-time greats of Latin music.\n\nWeek 66:\n\nOrquesta de la Luz (Orchestra of the Light) is a Japanese salsa band formed in 1984, led by vocalist, Nora. Although they spoke no Spanish, the founding members fell in love with the sound of salsa and decided to start a group. They began by replicating the different layers of instruments from some of their favorite records and began creating their own music. After sending a sample tape to the booking agent, Ritchie Bonilla, they traveled to New York City where their popularity quickly rose. More than 30 years later, La Orquesta de la Luz continues to play to a worldwide fanbase. In a song from their 2019 album, Nora sums up the group’s success quite nicely saying “salsa no tiene fronteras ni paredes” (salsa doesn’t have borders or walls).\n\nTo learn the band’s full story, check out the video to the right.\n\nWeek 65:\n\nWhen the CC team builds homes in Nicaragua, you are liable to find music being played. As we continue to Build Community in 2020, we asked CEO, Jon Thompson, to share some of his favorite tunes to work to. Enjoy!\n\nhttps://bit.ly/BuildingCommunityMusic\n\nWeek 64:\n\nToday we are honored to reunite with an old musical friend. James Sedgwick is a Canadian born singer and multi-instrumentalist whose path crossed with Jon Thompson in the early 2000s as he was helping to lay a foundation for the live music scene in San Juan Del Sur, Nicaragua. Over the years, James and his wife Monica opened the iconic Coquito’s bar and restaurant in SJdS and cultivated a vibrant community of musicians throughout the country. James has traveled and performed across the world, playing a variety of musical genres such as Blues, Jazz, Reggae, Latin, Country and Electronic music.\n\nIn this clip, James performs ‘Low budget love’ and Live your life’ from his new album entitled “Sedgwick and Shingles”.
