        "text": "As has been the case for the past two decades, the Marriott Hotel in Times Square will host a new edition of the International Salsa Congress, to be held in New York City from August 31 to September 3.\n\nAmong this year's activities is a tribute to the popular Cuban singer La Lupe. The celebration is one of the actions promoted by the International Salsa Museum, a nascent project that aims to create a cutting-edge space in the Bronx neighborhood to honor and preserve the salsa culture. This organization came to life last July, and involves prominent figures such as Janice Torres and Willy Rodriguez, who highlighted the importance of La Lupe in the development and popularity of Latin music in the United States.\n\nLupe Victoria Yolí Raymond or La Yiyivi, as she was also known, was born in the late 1930s in Santiago de Cuba, and although she studied to become a teacher, she soon embraced the path of singing. She began participating in shows in bars and cantinas that little by little made her known, until 1959, when she joined the Tropicuba trio, which had its fixed peña at the legendary club La Red. La Lupe was a different kind of star, her unorthodox way of singing and projecting herself won her as many followers as detractors, and among the latter were some of the decision-makers of the nascent Revolution. She ended up emigrating, first to Mexico and then to the United States, where her talent made her stand out and rub shoulders with the cream of the Latin music scene in New York. Alongside figures such as Mongo Santamaría and Tito Puentes, La Lupe was widely heard throughout the region, with a discography of more than 15 volumes.\n\nControversial, her life is an urban legend full of stories of excesses, vices and people who did her little favor. These factors, together with the rise of her fellow countrywoman Celia Cruz, caused the artist to begin her decline in the 1960s, which left her in poverty. Attempts to rescue her artistic career were coldly received both by the public (who no longer received the singer's artistic outbursts in the same way) and by the record companies. Among the evils that preceded her death in 1992 was the fire in the small apartment she shared with her partner and children in the Bronx, from which few objects were rescued. Precisely those objects will be exhibited during the tribute that will be paid to the woman that Ernest Hemingway called \"the creator of the art of frenzy\"."
