The power of music in unifying people remains unmatched. I am in the process of developing a project, The Latin Music Institure for the Preservation and Development, and in a nutshell we are trying to readily provide information like the one you ask. My next book project, Who's Who in Latin Music, is a step in that direction. A humongous task, questions like your bring the answers that are the backbone of this research project. Because this is the effort of many, what one does not know will be part of the knowledge of the collective. Eventually, if documented, the knowledge will belong to all. That said, when you speak of Caney, you are talking about the group or the composer? There is little information compiled about some of the gentleman you mention. Chuy Reyes was a heck of a pianist in the mambo era and during the 1940's and 50s he appeared in a few films like \"Freddy Steps Out\" in 1946 and a few others where he played an Orchestra Leader. His body of work can be somewhat traced to the late 50s. For Jose Morand you have to go to the Big Band era, he is another fabulous rumbero and mambero that is almost forgotten. Like Tito Puente used to say, \"Out of sight, out of mind\"... A lot of the great ones are forgotten as we move along without documenting their work. Again, that is the idea behind the institute. Fabian Andre is another perfect example, buried in obscurity, and barely resurfacing in Cougats discussions which are less common with each passing day. The examples you bring forth are the reason why we must do this type of work. I look forward to join as many as we can in this field of endeavour to continue documenting an illustrous musical legacy for our next generations. In music, I remain Juan Moreno Velazquez _6moons audio reviews: Juan Moreno's Tropical Splendor_ (http://www.6moons.com/audioreviews/juan/juan.html) The New York Institute for the Preservation and Development of Latin Music by: Juan Moreno-Velázquez --Concept Paper for Internal Discussion only-- This is an idea that I am sure has been thought off and pondered for years by many involved in the Latin music industry. In my particular case, as I was doing research for my recently released book on La Lupe, it was surprising to me how little information was available on her life, despite her fame and career achievements. Weekly conversations with music historian Joe Conzo, further convinced us both of the need to create an organization that would serve as a research institute, a place where future generations could study and understand our rich musical tradition, a place where verifiable professionals could conduct research into the history of Latin Music and its performers. One by one individuals concerned with this situation had come together and began a concerted discussion as to the possibilities of addressing this endeavor in a professional manner. Those discussions have led to the proposal at hand. What is available? Contrary to popular belief, the audio-visual information regarding our musical tradition is readily available. There are millions of photo images that depict its history, hundreds of thousands of newspaper, posters and magazine articles, as well as interviews where the voices of Tito Rodríguez, Tito Puente, Machito, Celia Cruz, Ismael Rivera and so many more of our great artists have been preserved. There are indeed a wide variety of recordings in paste, vinyl and CDs that document this tradition as well. There are miles of tape that encompass both musical recordings and films that have captured important periods of our musical tradition; Ernie Einsley´s collection is just one of those examples. His collection has valuable information collected over the last four decades. The state of these tapes, and its contents, however, is anyone’s guess. Collected for years without proper care, there is no idea of what can be extracted from this collection that can be preserved for the future. Non-the-less it is paramount to try. There is also a considerable amount of materials under the custody of some of our community organizations that have not yet even been catalogued due to lack of funding or organizational need and/or circumstance. The problem: The information is scattered and not readily available. It is in the possession of many fans, and memorabilia collectors who often times don’t know one another. Most important, there is no vehicle to make this information available to the public and, in time, these pieces of history end up in attics, where heirs who have no idea of the historical value of these items often times throw them out. Sometimes, if we are lucky, the items come for sale on eBay. In fact, it is a shame that in this day and age there is not a Latin Music dictionary available, were the names of our artists and their achievements are listed. We have left this endeavour to our memories, as the survivors of an era. Soon our memories will no longer be, and this could well mark the end of our musical tradition. Many of us complain that our music is no longer being played on the radio, as Tito Puente used to say... “Out of sight, out of mind”, this is a situation that needs to be addressed, and one problem that certainly can be resolved. The Solution: We are hereby proposing the creation of a not-for-profit institution, chartered under the 501(c) 3 designation, that will house these valuable historical items in a state-of-the art facility. We propose this organization be named The New York Institute for the Preservation and Development of Latin Music. There are millions of dollars in public funds and foundation moneys that have been ear marked for similar endeavours. These particular funds, however, are not, currently, been utilized by the Latino community. Our purpose: The New York Institute for the Preservation and Development of Latin Music’s main purpose is the preservation and documentation of all available material, acquired by purchasing collections, receiving donations of such material, or borrowing and digitizing these items for the enjoyment and information of future generations. The Institute --through our research component-- will document our musical history and tradition by expounding research papers, books and other publications that will ensure the survival and maintenance of our musical tradition and its performers. The first publication will be the Dictionary of Latin Music, where all the key participants in the creation, development and distribution of the genre that is universally known as salsa, past, present and future, are recorded. Another component of the Institute will produce radio and television programming that will be geared to the maintenance, documentation and development of this musical genre. In radio, we will program a 24/7 music and talk format to be distributed through the Internet as well as digital and public radio. This proposed radio station will ensure that the musical tradition in the works of Puente, Machito, Rodríguez, Barreto, the Palmieri’s, Willie Colón, and so many others will continue to be heard by the future generations. The Institute proposes to produce a television program that would educate --both the public and the media-- as well as elucidate-- on the wide variety of issues that affect Latin music and its exponents, as well as its distribution. This program will provide a forum of discussion and information that has sorely been lacking in the nation. This lack of information, and, in many cases, misinformation is one of the causes of the problem at hand. In full, the Institute will aim to supplement, as well as complement, the work of some community organizations that serve the Latino community by recognizing our common concerns and goals in the interest of developing and perpetuating this musical genre. A genre that, despite the problems that it faces for its survival, has impacted many different cultures around the world, especially in the United States of North America.
