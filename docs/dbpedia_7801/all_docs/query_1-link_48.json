        "text": "Reina Mora\n\nLos Angeles, CA\n\nReina Mora is an LA based Puerto Rican singer/songwriter, performer, and activist. She writes and sings in multiple genres such as Rock, Pop, Folk, Latin, and even Country. She started singing well before she could ever speak, as her grandfather, a Puerto Rican Bolero, was her mentor through her early years. Now, as a go to collaborator when writing with other artists, she loves the joy of making something out of nothing with like minded creatives. That level of trust, intimacy, and confidence in knowing that everyone has a story, it just hasnât been written yet. She also performs her own music, like her NPR featured single âTroubleâ, or through her Folk Duo, Willow Crest, where their single âFolktaleâ won SiriusXmâs most haunting song of 2021! She loves advocating through volunteering her time to WriteGirl, where sheâs been a special guest the last 3 years and by helping SONA for the last 5 years. The thing she loves most from continuing to give back, is being a part of something bigger than herself.\n\nReina Mora Musicâs tracks\n\nWeeds by Reina Mora Music\n\npublished on 2024-06-01T00:58:09Z\n\nDead Weight by Reina Mora Music\n\npublished on 2020-03-25T18:36:54Z\n\nTemporary Fix by Reina Mora Music\n\npublished on 2019-12-01T14:01:57Z"
