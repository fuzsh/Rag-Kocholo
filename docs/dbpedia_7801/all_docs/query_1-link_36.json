        "text": "Hola Grupera/os:\n\nI was saddened to discover the Tite Curet Alonso passed away. He was\n\nprobably the greatest living latino composer. His songs, aside from\n\nbeing energetic and infectious, were full of meaning and passion...\n\nfuck! It's really beyond me at this moment to really put into words\n\nwhat Tite has meant to me in my own life. Never met the man, but he\n\nhad an impact on my life as well as in the lives of many others. May\n\nhe rest in peace and may his body of work never recede in the dustbins\n\nof time.\n\nInstead, I'll repost this article -- let his own words ring out:\n\nAlonso, C. T. C. (2002). Memoirs of a life in salsa. Situating salsa:\n\nGlobal markets and local meaning in Latin popular music. L. Waxer. New\n\nYork, Routledge: 187-200.\n\nMEMOIRS OF A LIFE IN SALSA Catalino \"Tite\" Curet Alonso Translated by\n\nLise Waxer\n\nTite Curet Alonso is one of the most important composers in salsa\n\nhistory, having penned landmark songs for nearly every famous salsa\n\nperformer of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. His bits include \"Anacaona,\"\n\n\"Las caras lindas,\" \"La Tirana\" \"Pueblo Latino,\" \"Plantacion adentro,\"\n\n\"La Oportunidad,\" and many, many more. Curet's compositions are\n\ncharacterized not only by tuneful Melodies, poetic lyricism, and\n\ncatchy refrains, but also incisive social commentary and a strong\n\ncritique of injustice, oppression, and neocolonialism. Along with\n\nsinger-songwriter Ruben Blades (profiled below), be is one of the\n\nleading proponents of salsa with a social message.\"\n\nA lifelong resident of Puerto Rico, Tite Curet was born and\n\nraised in the salsero neighborhoods of Barrio Obrero and Santurce in\n\nSan Juan While a close friend to many stars, (including famous\n\nvocalist Ismael \"Maelo\" Rivera, fig. 2.1), be has never lost his touch\n\nwith the people and can often be seen conversing with friends and\n\nacquaintances in the streets of San Juan. In addition to his career as\n\na composer, he is also a journalist, sociologist, and a former\n\nPostman. The recipient of two honorary doctorates and numerous\n\naccolades, Tite Curet Alonso is revered by musicians and aficionados\n\nas the elder statesman of salsa. The following five autobiographical\n\nvignettes are taken from his book La Vida Misma (1985). Together, they\n\nconstitute an important insider's perspective on the salsa world. In\n\nthese pages, Tite Curet recounts his personal memoirs of musicians,\n\nproducers, and also his own experiences as a salsa composer. We are\n\ngrateful and honored to be able to include a translated version of\n\nthese chronicles here.\n\n[Page 188\n\nFIGURE 8.1. Tite Curet Alonso (right) with Ismael Rivera \"El Sonero\n\nMayor\" in Loiza, Puerto Rico, during the first Fiesta de Loiza, early\n\n1970s. Courtesy of Tire Curet Alonso.\n\nPANCHO CRISTAL\n\nPancho Cristal was the record producer who launched Tite Curet on his\n\npath as a successful salsa composer in the 1960s. Cristal worked for\n\nTico Records, an important New York salsa label that produced albums\n\nby such renowned bandleaders as conga players Ray Barretto and Mongo\n\nSantamaria, and pianists Eddie and Charlie Palmieri. In the following\n\nmemoir, Curet outlines his encounter with Cristal, who served as\n\nliaison between the composer and popular vocalist Guadalupe \"La Lupe\"\n\nYoli. La Lupe recorded three songs by Tite Curet that not only became\n\nher sig-\n\n[Page 189]\n\n-nature tunes, but made him famous and entered the repertoire of Latin\n\npopular music as widely loved classics: \"La Tirana,\" \"Carcajada\n\nfinal,\" and \"Puro teatro\" (the last of which was used in the\n\nsoundtrack to Pedro Almodovar's film Woman on the Verge of a Nervous\n\nBreakdown). In this vignette, Curet also mentions other important\n\nsalsa bandleaders of the 1960s: timbalero and pachanga pioneer Joey\n\nQuijano, who recorded one of Curet's very first songs, and the well\n\nknown percussionist and \"Mambo King\" Tito Puente, who performed with\n\nLa Lupe during the period that Curet wrote his famous tunes for her.\n\nI don't know what direction his life has taken. This business is\n\nlike that. It takes us from one place to another without our realizing\n\nit at times. The first time I heard his name was in 1965. Back then he\n\nwas producer of Tico Records, in the Latin music branch. Under his\n\nwing, individuals such as Ray Barretto, Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria,\n\nand La Lupe became famous, along with other stars in Latin dance and\n\nromantic music of the day.\n\nThe name \"Pancho Cristal\" was the last word in prestige and\n\nauthority. To know him and be his friend were the same thing.\n\nSomething spontaneous. He needed a local promoter, and I, who knew the\n\nscene by memory, lent my services. Furthermore, to be perfectly\n\nhonest, I needed to earn a few extra dollars to bolster a lifestyle\n\nthat was, at the time, devoted to one spree after another. That was\n\nall.\n\nThe big things came later. My career as a composer had already\n\nburst open with a son titled \"Efectivamente\" [Effectively], recorded\n\nby Joey Quijano and his Combo Cachana. The year was 1965, when Raffy\n\nTorres and I produced the radio show Ritmo Rendezvous [Rhythm\n\nrendezvous] on Station W, broadcast from the neighborhood of Hato Rey,\n\nPuerto Rico.\n\nThe singer La Lupe kindled my urge to write, for her dramatic and\n\nshocking style. I liked her. When I heard her sing \"El Amo\" [The\n\nmaster] my decision was already made, and Pancho Cristal helped to get\n\nmy bolero \"La Tirana\" [The female tyrant] to her. The tune was a hit\n\nthat brought me five hundred dollars. It felt glorious when my name\n\nwas mentioned along with those of \"La Yiyiyi\" [1] and Tito Puente, who\n\nwas arranger and accompanist for the sensational singer. Later,\n\nthrough Pancho Cristal's connections once again, La Lupe accepted\n\nanother two tunes of mine, \"Puro teatro\" [Pure theater] and \"Carcajada\n\nfinal\" [Last laugh]. Two more hits!\n\n\"The Pancho Cristal Connection\" was a trampoline for me. just\n\nwhat I needed. The author, the promoter, the artist, and a person full\n\nof faith who believed in me -- Pancho Cristal, nicknamed for a brand\n\nof Cuban beer, Cristal. His real name: Morris Pelman.\n\n[page190]\n\nAfter he left Tico Records and then moved on from a record shop\n\nhe later had on New York's Tenth Avenue, I never saw him again. They\n\nsay that once retired from the world of business, he moved to the city\n\nof Miami, Florida.\n\nThey say. I'm not clear what happened when he retired. I do know\n\nthat I, grateful, will always have a high place of honor for him in my\n\nmemory, very high. He was my open door, the piston and valve necessary\n\nto launch my career in an extremely difficult and competitive field:\n\nmusical composition.\n\nI have enjoyed public applause in many places. Plaques, eulogies,\n\ndiplomas, cultural, legislative, and mayor's awards, triumphs in song\n\nfestivals celebrated in various countries. All a pleasure!\n\nHere, in secret, at the bottom of my being I give a standing\n\novation to that superb gentleman who gave me his hand without thinking\n\ntwice, placing me on the road to triumph: PANCHO CRISTAL.\n\nLike that, all with capital letters that, for me, he deserves!\n\nTHE LETTER THAT CORTIJO WON'T BE ABLE TO READ\n\nBandleader and percussionist Rafael Cortijo was one of the most\n\nimportant innovators in Puerto Rican popular music of the\n\nmid-twentieth century. During the 1950s, he adapted the traditional\n\nrhythms of' Afro Puerto Rican bomba and plena to the dynamic format of\n\nan eight member ensemble that featured Cuban percussion, trumpets,\n\nsaxophones, piano, bass -- and the inimitable lead vocals of Ismael\n\n\"Maelo\" Rivera. Founded in 1954, the group of Cortijo and his combo\n\ninaugurated a new era in Latin popular music, breaking away from the\n\nlarge, staid dance bands of the 1940s to introduce a more energetic\n\npresentation marked by driving rhythms, catchy refrains and horn\n\nchoruses, and infectious dance routines by the front line of\n\nvocalists. Cortijo's bomba and plena recordings were enormously\n\npopular not only in Puerto Rico, but also Colombia and Venezuela. The\n\nband lasted until 1962, when Cortijo and Maelo suffered problems with\n\nthe law owing to marijuana possession. The rest of the band, under the\n\nleadership of pianist Rafael Ithier, regrouped under the name El Gran\n\nCombo de Puerto Rico, which continued Cortijo's legacy to become\n\nPuerto Rico's most stalwart salsa orchestra.\n\nThe following memoir was written as a letter to Cortijo shortly\n\nafter the percussionist's death in 1984. Tite Curet recounts his close\n\npersonal friendship with Cortijo, candidly recalling the experiences\n\nthey shared together. Of note is his commentary on the hard times\n\nCortijo faced after the disbanding of his first combo in the 1960s,\n\nwhen the music industry turned its back on him. The letter opens with\n\nreference to the incredible public outpouring at the maestro's funeral\n\n-- in Puerto Rico, The death of a famous musician becomes an occasion\n\nnot only for mourning, but for exuberant celebration and music making\n\nin homage to the memory of the beloved artist.\n\nRest in peace, friend, now you don't need anything, not even to\n\nbreathe. Your death has caused such grief that the public poured out\n\ntheir hearts to you. Santurce [Cortijo's neighborhood] knew how to say\n\n\"see you later,\" with panderetas, drums, dance bands and singers\n\ngathered together, pumping out plenas and bombas at full steam. It\n\nlooked like one of those massive fiestas, full of people. You knew how\n\nto penetrate to the very heart of the populace, since [forming your\n\ncombo in] 1954. There you remained openly, like a manifesto, without\n\nobstacles or restrictions. There was a multitude that spilled out into\n\nthe streets to remember you and cry tears of love, to the strains and\n\nrhythms of your captivating music.\n\nAt one time you put the name of Santurce and Puerto Rico high up\n\nin the world, very high up. And the people repaid you with a\n\nspectacular funeral as moving as the end of a global war. Or the\n\nbeginning of a true peace.\n\nNow that you aren't here it's good to know that I shared your\n\nstruggles through the moments of triumph and hardship, from close up\n\nand afar. You were that unselfish friend who put his wallet at my\n\nservice during my worst times of alcoholism. And when he saw me\n\nwithout a single cent put his dollars in my hand, \"so that you can go\n\nshopping for your kids.\" Favors that I felt were never repaid even by\n\nall my attempts to reciprocate, not even with the music that I later\n\nwrote, with pleasure, for the combo.... From close up, from afar, it\n\nwas most remarkable to be your friend and your brother, in life and in\n\nmusic.\n\nThat time with \"Pa' los Caserios\" [For the small towns] and the\n\nawards that the CRUV conferred on us on television, in full color...\n\nwe looked like a pair of black princes both crowned as kings. The\n\ntruth is, we brought down the house.\n\nI always viewed your career, filled with trophies, plaques,\n\nawards and emblems, without a trace of envy, as one does when truly\n\ngrounded in the fundamentals of friendship. You planted a tremendous\n\nseed of music and sentiment when you raised the so-called music of the\n\nstreets to the valued position it occupies today. Before your red hot\n\ncombo, any musician who lived well had to belong to one of the big\n\norchestras. With your triumph, you brought them honey and pastries\n\n[easy times]. You broke that monopoly and superiority.\n\nYou put expensive clothes on our everyday music, luxurious\n\ngarments of fine cloth... records, radio, television, movies, sacred\n\nexports. This innovative task falls only to the creators, it does not\n\nmatter if they\n\n[page192]\n\nlater have to confront, as in the case of some heroes, people's\n\nindifference. In the long run, that which shines, shines. The\n\nmediocre, while it may shine, will tarnish and remain stuck in its\n\ngiven time and place. Such is life and so it will be.\n\nIn difficult times I suffered a lot for you and with you. When\n\nyour two children Timber and Zoila arrived in this world, you were\n\nalready fifty years old. And after reaching a half century, such\n\nthings worry anyone, for obvious reasons of love.\n\nIt was then that the owners of the music business turned their\n\nbacks on you, promoting those who reaped from you instead.[2] It seems\n\nthat they were waiting, slyly, for the moment that this would most\n\nhurt and maim you. I remember you, roaming the streets in a struggle\n\nto tough this out. And also your words, \"It's now that I've got two\n\nchildren that I feel happy, but worried about not being able to offer\n\nthem comfort and all the other things they need… \"\n\nThe only thing you needed was work, to settle your new situation\n\nas a father. I knew it. Just as you had been charitable to extremes,\n\neven to the point of being cleaned out on numerous occasions, you\n\nnever liked asking for a handout. I saw how they closed doors to you,\n\nruining whatever business you launched.\n\nI was shocked to find out, and forgive me for telling this, how\n\nthey tried to make someone kill you. And how death's emissary, before\n\nyour largesse and sincerity, repented from doing so. There are just\n\nsome men too great and beloved to be eliminated like that, by a paid\n\npistol shot. And there are little guys who grow a bit larger by\n\nmotivating their conscience to not pull a trigger for a few dollars.\n\nAfter your passing I looked in a book that was published about\n\nPuerto Rican musicians. They barely dedicated a few lines to you. All\n\nof it parsimoniously expressed, almost as if by fluke. But it doesn't\n\nmatter. I know that in the heart of your people you wrote an\n\nencyclopedia of affection, music, and rhythm. The people showed it on\n\nOctober 6. Your career was glorious. Your life overturned sadness,\n\nconverting it into happiness and color. You were a total winner. You\n\nestablished a new era for our music and our musicians. Everyone knows\n\nthat and now nobody argue that or take that away from you.\n\nRest in peace now ... Be calm, my friend and brother. Where you\n\nare now, you don't need anything ... Not even to breathe... !\n\nCHEO FELICIANO IN THE CENTER FOR FINE ARTS, BY HIS OWN RIGHT\n\n(Chronicle dedicated to Fernando Sterling and Luis Maquina)\n\nVocalist Jose \"Cheo \" Feliciano is a long standing veteran of the\n\nsalsa\n\n[page 193]\n\nscene, most commonly associated with the famous Fania All Stars. He\n\nlaunched his performance career in the mid-1960s with the sextet of\n\nboogaloo pioneer Joe Cuba (see Flores, chapter 4), recording such bits\n\nas \"Bang Bang,\" \"El Pito,\" and his signature tune, \"El Raton.\"\n\nFeliciano struggled with drug addiction and was jailed for narcotics\n\npossession in the late 1960s, but upon his release launched a solo\n\ncareer. His association and friendship with Tite Curet is legendary\n\namong salsa aficionados -- in this memoir Curet alludes to the\n\nconstant stream of advice he gave his friend concerning the singer's\n\ndelivery and style. Many of Feliciano's most renowned tunes were\n\ncomposed by Curet, including \"Anacaona\" (a song with strong\n\nanticolonialist undercurrents), \"Nabori,\" \"Salome\" and several others.\n\nIn 1973, Curet composed an entire album's worth of songs for Feliciano\n\nduring a downslide in the singer's career and personal life. The\n\nrecording, prophetically titled With a Little Help from My Friend, was\n\nreleased by Fania Records and received much critical acclaim. Curet\n\nrefers to this project below.\n\nThis chronicle originally appeared as a newspaper column about\n\nFeliciano's appearance at the Centro de Bellas Artes (Fine Arts\n\nCenter) in San Juan in the mid 1980s, a period when popular artists\n\nbegan breaking through barriers of race and class to appear in venues\n\nformerly reserved for elite culture. Indeed, during the early 1990s a\n\nconsiderable debate was raised by the proposal, later scuttled, to\n\nrename the Centro de Bellas Artes after Rafael Cortijo. Curet\n\npositions Feliciano's performance in this theater as a legitimization\n\nof the artist's long and turbulent career as one of salsa's most\n\npopular vocalists.\n\nThe singer Cheo Feliciano and I met each other in New York City\n\non 110th Street, almost at the corner of Madison Avenue. That is, in\n\nEl Barrio [Spanish Harlem]. It was during his time as vocalist with\n\nthe Joe Cuba Sextet, when the salseros of the time crowded about to\n\nsee him sonear [improvise] and the ladies sighed to hear him sing\n\nboleros in a smooth and infectious manner that inspired romance.\n\nRight there on that marvelous corner of the city, I unloaded my\n\nfirst critique on him. \"Cheo, brother, when you are soneando [singing\n\nimprovisations] you stray too much from the main theme, so you should\n\nreally think much harder about that… \"\n\nA very special and long-lasting friendship grew from this point\n\nforward. My advice rained on him each time we met in Puerto Rico or in\n\nthe metropolis. A mutual friend who introduced Cheo and I, Nandy\n\nSterling, had already given the lead… \"Cheo, there's a friend of mine\n\nin Puerto Rico who thinks highly of you and has great\n\nthings planned for you.\"\n\n[page 194]\n\nThese so-called \"great things\" had to wait their turn. The man\n\nflung himself down the negative side of life. Many people turned their\n\nbacks on him. They saw him in a bad light, wandering through the\n\nneighborhood streets of Santurce, destitute. Our friendship remained\n\nthe same. A meeting with him meant a bear hug, and then that gesture\n\nof \"What do you need?\"…\n\nWhen he decided to get himself together I silently applauded\n\nhim... Knowing he was on the road to recovery and beginning to prepare\n\nprojects for him was one and the same thing. Jerry Masucci, the\n\ndirector of Fania Records, saw me with the hefty stack of papers\n\ncalled the Cheo Feliciano Project, and in his fractured Spanish merely\n\ncommented: \"Yes but you're in charge of him, you deal with Cheo… \"\n\nHoney over pastry. The project waited another couple of years more...\n\nAnd physically and mentally detoxified, the man set out on a sure\n\npath...\n\nThen came those hits with \"Anacaona,\" \"Pa' que afinquen,\" Mi\n\ntriste problema,\" \"Franqueza cruel,\" \"Este es el guaguanco\" And into\n\nhis hands, fortune. He seemed like a child handling a new toy. One\n\ncalled fame.\n\nMexico, Chile, Holland, Panama, Venezuela, England, Argentina.\n\nPeru, Colombia, Japan, United States, Dominican Republic, Africa.\n\nFrance, where he sang in the Miden Festival of Cannes, and in the\n\nworld-famous Olympic Theater of Paris... The crowds adored him and\n\nfrom afar I tasted the satisfaction of having won my bet on the\n\n\"underdog.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Puerto Rico the singer led a family life, the easy\n\nlife that he had not enjoyed for some time. In his leisure time he\n\ndevoted himself (among other things) to gardening and planting\n\nvegetables despite my jokes that consisted of calling him \"the Jackie\n\nRobinson of agriculture, the first black farmer of the modern era.\"\n\nAnd dozens of similar compliments. To be sure, he was happy, and to an\n\nextent I was happy for myself too. Jerry Masucci's requirement that I\n\ntake charge of him was followed to the letter. And to that of the\n\nmusic...\n\nThen came a stretch of total idleness. During this lapse he\n\nhardly recorded any albums, and those that he did make were not hits.\n\nHe went back to cloistered meetings with that irritable big brother of\n\nhis. New warnings and shakings by the neck… \"Life changes, you have to\n\nget involved in something else, kid.\"\n\nWhen he went back to the recording studios a string of successes\n\nreturned to him: \"Los entierros pobres,\" \"Estampa marina,\" \"Juan\n\nAlbañil,\" \"Trizas,\" and a hell of an accomplished bolero written by\n\nJuan Nogueras titled \"Amada mía,\" considered to be the master work of\n\nsentimental song....\n\n[page 195]\n\nOur friend Cheo is already big. He's a grandfather. And he\n\ncontinues to be as outstanding as a certain whiskey.\n\nHe has completed twenty-five years in lyric song. A quarter\n\ncentury pleasing the public and offering his warmth as an exquisite\n\nsinger. They are going to celebrate all this through a concert, a sort\n\nof double bill, this Friday in the Festival Salon of the Center for\n\nFine Arts. Something that he as much as his public deserves.\n\nThere I will be in the audience, whether it goes ahead or not.\n\nAnd although we won't be able to see each other, for obvious reasons,\n\nin the prevailing semidarkness, he will be aware of my presence, which\n\nwill be like the best wish for everything to go well. A wish that they\n\napplaud him deliriously. Because you all cannot imagine how much I\n\nlove him and esteem him, this accomplice of my career as a composer\n\nand other things. This Cheo Feliciano, tremendous partner.\n\nISMAEL MIRANDA: A WELL-OFF SONERO\n\nIsmael Miranda is another famous vocalist of classic 1970s salsa, who,\n\nlike Cheo Feliciano, has long been associated with the Fania All\n\nStars. He launched his career at the age of seventeen, earning him the\n\nsobriquet \"El Niño Bonito de la Salsa\" [salsa's pretty boy]. Through\n\nthe early 1970s, Miranda was lead vocalist with the salsa band of\n\npianist Larry Harlow (Harlow was also a chief producer for Fania\n\nRecords), before going solo in the middle of the decade. Although born\n\nin Puerto Rico, Miranda grew up in New York City and did not speak\n\nfluent Spanish which Curet advised him to learn to do before\n\nattempting a solo career. In contrast to salsa artists who have\n\nstruggled with substance abuse and personal finances, Miranda has\n\nenjoyed great stability thanks to his sharp nose for business\n\ninvestments.\n\nThe following memoir outlines Curet's relationship with Miranda,\n\ntouching on the singer's early years and subsequent path to stardom.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Miranda was a friend and contemporary of\n\nanother rising salsa vocalist, the legendary Hector Lavoe (see\n\nValentin, chapter 7). Curet recounts how the fledgling singers pursued\n\ntheir idol Ismael Rivera, the famed singer who fronted Cortijo and his\n\ncombo in the 1950s and was an important influence for salsa in the\n\n1960s and 70s ,see Berrios Miranda, chapter 2). As he did for many\n\nsalsa vocalists, Curet penned some of Miranda's most popular hits,\n\nincluding \"La oportunidad\" and \"Galera tres.\"\n\nThe man himself told me the story, in a bar located in the now\n\nnot very luxurious sector of Miramar. He drank a beer, and me, that\n\never-present soda! [3]\n\n[page196]\n\n\"I pursued Ismael Rivera there in New York. Same as my friend\n\nHector Lavoe, who shared an apartment with me. We both wanted to be\n\nsoneros [singers] no matter what, and we were really surprised that a\n\nstar like Ismael Rivera would let two eager novices share the stage\n\nwith him. We liked the attitude he had.\" He and I imagined how the\n\nnext day went, with them telling their friends in the barrio: \"Last\n\nnight we sang with Ismael Rivera. He's our buddy and said we sounded\n\ngreat.\n\nLife, the son, the guaracha, followed as usual. Ismael Miranda\n\nwas signed to the Larry Harlow orchestra, then known for the style of\n\nson montuno that Harlow had learned in Havana watching dance sets by\n\nthe conjunto of Arsenio Rodriguez, the most important cultivator of\n\nthat style.[4] The so-called \"Amazing Blindman\" owing to his skill\n\nplaying the tres [Cuban guitar]. With reason!\n\nThe truth is that Ismael belted out some incredible high notes\n\nwhen singing boleros, and his vocal timbre seemed to have been\n\ninvented for those montunos with four-line choruses. Stupendous! And\n\nsince he was a good dancer and well-groomed fellow, in time he was\n\nnicknamed \"The Pretty Boy of Salsa. \"\n\nThe Latino dance crowd -- thirsty for new idols and now\n\ncompletely recovered from the postwar slump -- gave great importance\n\nto singers, so like everyone else he wanted to set out on his own\n\npath, with a band of his own. It was logical.\n\nMy advice for him was quick. I recommended that he take some\n\nextra time before launching himself as a soloist. \"A year,\" was the\n\nsentence. \"You have to learn how to speak correctly, or the best\n\npossible, in Spanish. You're still saying a lot of words and terms\n\nvery poorly, not the way they should be. Take it easy and then we'll\n\nsee. I'll be standing b you.\"\n\nAfter a year was over he called me. He was speaking Spanish \"by\n\nthe book.\" With an enormous desire and spirit to triumph. He also\n\nexpressed his concerns about living in Puerto Rico. In beloved\n\nPuertorro! Here, with his people. After all, he was no more than a\n\nlittle country boy from Aguada [5] trying to make his fortune.\n\n\"Now you're on. This very week tell Masucci [director of Fania\n\nRecords] that I will send a tune made to your wishes.\" And it arrived\n\njust in time to record it. Titled: \"La Oportunidad\" [The Opportunity].\n\nIt ended up being his first big hit as a soloist. \"At long last it's\n\ncome. Now my time has come for sure. And this time I'm not letting it\n\npass. My opportunity has come.\" Remember, salseros? That was\n\ntremendous!\n\nFrom that point on everything was honey over pastry, whether it\n\nwas bolero or guaracha and son montuno, that kid was an ace in the\n\nhole. His personal manner through all this did not vary. He would dine\n\n[page 197]\n\nin a luxury restaurant just the same as when he went to the beachfront\n\nin Piñones to eat a pair of alcapurrias [6] with gusto. In terms of\n\nalcohol, he never was a habitual drinker. He hardly drank more than a\n\nglass of whiskey.\n\nIn his triumphant career he always was an interpreter who,\n\nalthough he knew how to compose and had some solid original hits,\n\nnever turned his back on me. He kept asking me for work continuously.\n\nA thousand thanks! There was a moment, however, that was a top hit for\n\nboth. It concerned \"Galera tres\" [Ward three]. It came at a moment\n\nwhen there were many uprisings in the jails and prisons. A female\n\ncolleague in journalism studies told me that the song was a\n\nbest-seller in Peru and other countries. At that time, another\n\nuniversity colleague of mine from back in the 1940s, a tremendous\n\nmulatta woman and lawyer named Irba Cruz de Batista, was director of\n\nthe Department of Correctional Services. She was receiving strong and\n\nharsh criticisms. After all, the situation in the penal system hasn't\n\nchanged much, despite the sermons of the distinguished lady and\n\nprofessional Doha Trina Padilla.\n\nLet's come back to Ismael Miranda. If there was something to\n\nadmire in him, it was his good instinct for business. First he was a\n\ntire dealer, then property sales, then urban development, restaurants,\n\nand an office building in the Golden Mile, the banking zone. He's\n\nmade! It's well known than he has millions of dollars. May San Pedro\n\nbless every one of them!\n\nWe know that he doesn't need to sing for a living, since he\n\ninvested well in his future. He had enough vision so that now, in his\n\nadult life, he can live at ease. Even so, singing tugs at him. And he\n\nreturns to the stage with the same charm as always. To earn applause\n\non all continents.\n\nA good artist never retires. We see this in the case of [Cuban]\n\nsinger Olga Guillot, and this tells us why. There is Ismael Miranda on\n\nthe scene once again, ready to sing with all the sabor that salsa\n\nrequires and awaits from one of its grand maestros.\n\nRUBEN BLADES\n\nRubén Blades is the most renowned singer-songwriter of 1970s and '80s\n\nsalsa, and one of salsa's most political artists. A native of Panama,\n\nBlades studied law as a young man and eventually earned a doctorate in\n\nlaw from Harvard University. Moving to New York in the early 1970s, he\n\nworked as an errand boy for Fania Records before launching his singing\n\ncareer in 1974 with the band of conga player Ray Barretto. In 1976, be\n\nmoved to the band of legendary trombonist and composer Willie Colon\n\nreplacing Colon's former vocalist Hector Lavoe. Colon and Blades\n\nrecorded some of the most important salsa albums of the late\n\n[page 198]\n\n1970s, including Metiendo Mano and Siembra, which pointed strong\n\ncriticism at capitalism, social prejudice, and injustice. Included in\n\nthese albums was Tite Curet Alonso's anticolonialist \"Plantacion\n\nadentro.\"\n\nBlades stands alongside Curet as author of some of salsa's most\n\nsocially conscious repertoire. The hard-hitting commentary of Blades's\n\nsongs, modeled on the Latin American protest genre Of nueva cancion,\n\nattracted thousands of new listeners to salsa in the late 1970s,\n\nparticularly leftists, intellectuals, and university students. Blades\n\nleft Colon in 1980 to record and perform with a band of his own,\n\ncontinuing to produce acclaimed albums while branching out as an actor\n\nin Hollywood films. He returned to politics after receiving his law\n\ndegree in 1985, and ran as a presidential candidate in the 1994\n\nPanamanian national elections. In the following chronicle, originally\n\npublished in two parts, Curet recognizes Blades as a friend and\n\nkindred spirit, referring to several of his hit songs and also\n\ndiscussing Blades's involvement in politics. Notably, Curet\n\nacknowledges Blades's \"salsa with a social message\" as an important\n\ncontribution that smoothed out the rough, barrio-oriented edge of\n\nsalsa prior to that time and got listeners thinking more profoundly\n\nabout broad social issues of the day\n\n. It was at the corner of Ashford and Magdalena Avenues, in the\n\nmiddle of Condado district.[7] There it was, although I don't remember\n\nthe date anymore. The hour, yes, it was night, under the stars and out\n\nin the open, one of those hours that are good for getting into a long\n\nconversation which leads to a firm friendship. Rubén Blades has been\n\nthat, a good friend made initially through our connection to Caribbean\n\nmusic, and then consolidated by the support of friendship itself.\n\nHis dreams of triumph shone through in his gaze. First he had to\n\ncomplete his law studies in Panama, his native country, in order to\n\nventure forth and unleash the flood of inspiration that trembled\n\ninside him. His path was already laid out. He knew where he was going.\n\nThe animated chat continued on that corner. Both of us\n\npractically immobile alongside the relentless horns of cars locked in\n\na traffic jam. They proved his streetwise philosophy that \"corners are\n\nthe same everywhere. \"\n\nBrazil and its music drew both of us. We talked about \"over\n\nthere\" as if we had found ourselves on the sidewalks of Copacabana or\n\non the streets of Ipanema next to the hexagonal Bar Veloso, where the\n\npoet Vinicius de Moraes and the composer Antonio Carlos Jobim,\n\nwatching the exquisite girl Eloisa Helena pass by, wrote the famous\n\nbossa nova titled \"Chica de Ipanema,\" which became popular worldwide.\n\nNeither one of us even imagined that in time he was going to record\n\n[Page199]\n\nmy samba, \"La palabra adios,\" and the hymn like guaracha \"Plantacion\n\nadentro,\" based on an Amazon theme. It was, well, a happy encounter,\n\nseasoned with comments about how much good he could do for Caribbean\n\nmusic, bestowing it with work that both of us, hopeful, catalogued as\n\n\"high thought.\"\n\nAs we nonchalantly agreed, the learning exchange that night was on\n\nboth sides, both of us pinned down at Magdalena and Ashford, a corner\n\nlike any other, because after all, \"corners are the same everywhere,\"\n\nalthough the surroundings change.\n\nOne resounding triumph after another. Salsa music and its many\n\nthousands of worshipers have come to accept the singer Ruben Blades\n\nwithout limits. Salsa with a social message has produced a string of\n\nhits, and also smoothed out the genre a little, making young people\n\nthink about the issues of the moment, of the everyday path.\n\n\"Pedro Navaja,\" \"Chica plastica \"El Cantante,\" \"Cipriano Armenteros,\"\n\n\"El Tiburon,'' Ligia Elena,\" \"El Camaleon,\" the work El solar de los\n\naburridos and a world more of tunes from his pen and in his melodious\n\nvoice -- all of them didactic and proclaiming his name as a\n\nsinger-songwriter, perhaps the best of them all in the salsa business.\n\nNobody doubts his talent at producing hits now. The public adores him,\n\nit follows him and pursues him from one place to another. On many\n\noccasions he has had to resort to protection from police or security\n\nguards, since he is valuable property. Sometimes human affection, when\n\nen masse, can hurt the person who is admired. He has even made it to\n\nHollywood films. Now he's quite international.\n\nFrom that position as errand boy in the offices of Fania Records he\n\nwent, without guide ropes, climbing the slope to fame, a steep\n\ntrajectory that costs much hard work and much dreaming. Yes, the\n\nslope, the slope.\n\nI understand him very well. The same here in this capital city of San\n\nJuan as over there in the city of New York; however many times we've\n\nmet he's been the same. He hasn't changed a bit. We share opinions\n\nabout each other's new projects, shaking hands and ideas whether we\n\nhave time or not, given that his life has left him with few spare\n\nmoments because of obligations and more obligations. He has traveled\n\nso much of late that he seems like a minister of external affairs. I\n\ndon't know how he managed to take the time out to complete his law\n\nstudies and graduate with a doctoral degree in law from prestigious\n\nHarvard University, but he hasn't let go of the music, the backbone of\n\nhis life, the field where he conquered the public's love.\n\nWithin him stirred another social force. Politics! Some people do not\n\ntire of affirming that he wants to be president of Panama, thus\n\nentering\n\n[Page 200]\n\nthe public life of the homeland that he has lived far away from for\n\nobvious reasons, but that he has never stopped thinking about. And for\n\nhis native isthmus, he wants the best.\n\n\"It's not that I want to be president, unless the position comes from\n\nthe mandate of the people. Yes, I would like to form part of the\n\ngovernment that settles many things that are not going well over there\n\nfor the people on the bottom.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, but I'm no magician. It would have to be operating a group of\n\nleaders, people willing to struggle for the common good. Alone I\n\ncouldn't do it, you know.\"\n\nWe were conversing this time in his dressing room at the Poliedro\n\nStadium in Caracas. Backstage, we could hear ovations from the\n\nrestless public, eager to see and hear him sing on the wide stage with\n\nhis group Los Sees del Solar, tonight augmented by wind instruments.'\n\nHe left for the stage then, escorted by security guards.\n\nI stayed far back, observing his triumph. Every bit a great artist!\n\nSuddenly I thought about the labyrinths of Latin American politics,\n\nwhere vendettas rule. And where to this day there's always been an\n\ninflamed rivalry that usually doesn't hold back, attacking, injuring,\n\nand even fatally eliminating the opposition. May God keep you, Ruben\n\nGod keep you!\n\nEDITOR'S NOTES\n\n1. \"La Yiyiyi\" was a nickname for La Lupe, owing to the yelps she\n\noften emitted in performance.
