        "text": "This essay examines the meanings of gender in the music of Cuba's Nueva Trova, an important expression of what came to be known as the Nueva Canción (New Song) that flourished throughout Latin America between the 1960s and the 1980s. The continent-wide movement sought to challenge the commercialization of the air-waves by raising profound, revolutionary, and deeply Latin American themes while revaluing traditional instruments and styles. Music played an important role in articulating a rejection of capitalist and colonial values, a turn to popular and indigenous roots, a commitment to continent-wide revolution, and a vision of a better world. Through festivals, gatherings, and conferences, mass concerts and radio, international travel, and, under dictatorship, clandestinely circulated cassette tapes, the Nueva Canción exemplified a generation's search for multiple meanings of liberation. In participating in radical critiques of Latin America's social order, the Nueva Canción rewrote gender norms embedded in society and its music. Revolutionary singer-songwriters explored the meanings of human emancipation in ways that challenged traditional gender roles and ideologies. Political, personal, and love songs upended gender stereotypes to offer new, revolutionary meanings to romantic love. Songwriters linked the Cuban Revolution to other Latin American revolutionary processes and imagined how the new society would liberate the human spirit and human potential. Socially committed art reflected, explored, and contributed to imagining the new world, and reimagining gender played a role in the process and in its music.\n\n. How should we question traditional considerations regarding the voice and agency of women singers? How should we sustain a feminist listening and archive akin to performance, sound, silences and nuances? These are few of the questions that Licia Fiol-Matta’s The Great Woman Singer: Gender and Music in Puerto Rican Music pursues with archival, critical and theoretical expertise. The book opens with Puerto Rican singer Luz ‘Lucecita’ Benítez unsettling and masculine performance of “Génesis”, which won the best song in a Chilean song festival in 1969. By refocusing male authorship to the sonic power of female androgyny, Lucecita Benítez obtained unprecedented notoriety. Though rebelliousness granted creative freedom, it negatively impacted her career. The other artists explored in the book, Myrta Silva, Ruth Fernández, and Ernestina Reyes were also revered and chastised as only divas are, the “management of their artistic persona” often misread by the general public and industry (8). Nonetheless, one could argue that Fiol-Matta’s project is rather restorative than revisionist. Fiol-Matta’s Lacanian and phenomenological approaches on voice are nurtured by queer, gender, sound, and cultural studies, allow her to deploy the concept of “thinking voice” as the welding element of the project. It is conceptualized as the outcome of the artists’ careful attention and crafting of her voices, inviting the audience to make “an exercise of thought through the sense of hearing and the act of listening”. By revisiting these artists’ multimedia and ephemeral archive, and putting forward documented critical biographies, Fiol-Matta keenly demonstrates the artists’ impact in the scopic” in order to “influence collective listening” (227-71). Lastly, her endeavor repositions them as key figures in building the 20th century’s Puerto Rican and Caribbean popular sonic sphere.\n\nThis paper explores the presence and importance of women artists in the Spanish African-American music scene, specifically in the blues, jazz and soul-funk sub-scenes. It presents an ethnography focused on the increasing prominence of women, and it addresses different musical events, texts and artists associated with a diversity of voices, identities, discourses and emotions in the public sphere. Methodologically, we draw on participant observation, interviews, documentation and discourse analysis from a communicative and sociosemiotic perspective. We study the Spanish soul music scene, where African-descendant singers play a leading role, and we examine in depth the case of Aretha Soul Divas, a supergroup tribute to Aretha Franklin. The discourses analysed refer to the emotional dimension of musical experience, where the encounter between artists and audiences facilitates mutual understanding and emotional liberation. Furthermore, we verify the connection between the demands enunciated within the music scene, and the demands of the African descendant collective in Spain, which denounces racism and lack of visibility. The events, texts and discourses that emerge in these confluence spaces contribute to the passionate construction of a symbolic territory of their own, where the individual is combined with the collective. Este artículo explora la presencia e importancia de las mujeres artistas en la escena española de música afroamericana, en concreto en las subescenas de blues, jazz y soul-funk. Se trata de una etnografía centrada en el creciente protagonismo de las mujeres y aborda distintos eventos musicales, textos y artistas asociados a una diversidad de voces, identidades, discursos y emociones en la esfera pública. Metodológicamente, realizamos observación participante, entrevistas, documentación y análisis del discurso desde una perspectiva comunicativa y sociosemiótica. Indagamos en la escena de soul española, donde las cantantes afrodescendientes ocupan un rol protagonista, y examinamos en profundidad el caso de Aretha Soul Divas, un supergrupo de homenaje a Aretha Franklin. Los discursos analizados apuntan a la dimensión emocional de la experiencia musical, donde el encuentro entre artistas y públicos facilita el entendimiento mutuo y la liberación emocional. Además, constatamos la conexión entre las reivindicaciones enunciadas en la escena musical y las demandas del colectivo afrodescendiente en España, que denuncia el racismo y la falta de visibilidad. En esos espacios de confluencia emergen eventos, textos y discursos que contribuyen a la apasionada construcción de un territorio simbólico propio, donde lo individual se conjuga con lo colectivo."
