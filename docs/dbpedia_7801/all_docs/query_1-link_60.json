        "text": ". How should we question traditional considerations regarding the voice and agency of women singers? How should we sustain a feminist listening and archive akin to performance, sound, silences and nuances? These are few of the questions that Licia Fiol-Matta’s The Great Woman Singer: Gender and Music in Puerto Rican Music pursues with archival, critical and theoretical expertise. The book opens with Puerto Rican singer Luz ‘Lucecita’ Benítez unsettling and masculine performance of “Génesis”, which won the best song in a Chilean song festival in 1969. By refocusing male authorship to the sonic power of female androgyny, Lucecita Benítez obtained unprecedented notoriety. Though rebelliousness granted creative freedom, it negatively impacted her career. The other artists explored in the book, Myrta Silva, Ruth Fernández, and Ernestina Reyes were also revered and chastised as only divas are, the “management of their artistic persona” often misread by the general public and industry (8). Nonetheless, one could argue that Fiol-Matta’s project is rather restorative than revisionist. Fiol-Matta’s Lacanian and phenomenological approaches on voice are nurtured by queer, gender, sound, and cultural studies, allow her to deploy the concept of “thinking voice” as the welding element of the project. It is conceptualized as the outcome of the artists’ careful attention and crafting of her voices, inviting the audience to make “an exercise of thought through the sense of hearing and the act of listening”. By revisiting these artists’ multimedia and ephemeral archive, and putting forward documented critical biographies, Fiol-Matta keenly demonstrates the artists’ impact in the scopic” in order to “influence collective listening” (227-71). Lastly, her endeavor repositions them as key figures in building the 20th century’s Puerto Rican and Caribbean popular sonic sphere.\n\nTurning the table on the critics, a salsa musician writes about the writings on music, becoming a critic himself during the process. Having played in at least one of the famous salsa bands mentioned in each of the books he considers, the musician sets out with the presumption that the critics will have nothing new to tell him. Picking his way along the printed pages, he discovers answers to some of the questions that plagued him during salsa's golden age, as well as newly significant aspects of a musical style that has lasted long enough to be heard by the children of its original audience. Some mysteries remain, however; the critics cannot agree on who plays this music authentically, who knows how to listen to it, and why. In the end, it may turn out that the music will create its own listeners: the interbred offspring of salsa's varied listeners who are as difficult to categorize as the music.\n\nThis paper explores the presence and importance of women artists in the Spanish African-American music scene, specifically in the blues, jazz and soul-funk sub-scenes. It presents an ethnography focused on the increasing prominence of women, and it addresses different musical events, texts and artists associated with a diversity of voices, identities, discourses and emotions in the public sphere. Methodologically, we draw on participant observation, interviews, documentation and discourse analysis from a communicative and sociosemiotic perspective. We study the Spanish soul music scene, where African-descendant singers play a leading role, and we examine in depth the case of Aretha Soul Divas, a supergroup tribute to Aretha Franklin. The discourses analysed refer to the emotional dimension of musical experience, where the encounter between artists and audiences facilitates mutual understanding and emotional liberation. Furthermore, we verify the connection between the demands enunciated within the music scene, and the demands of the African descendant collective in Spain, which denounces racism and lack of visibility. The events, texts and discourses that emerge in these confluence spaces contribute to the passionate construction of a symbolic territory of their own, where the individual is combined with the collective. Este artículo explora la presencia e importancia de las mujeres artistas en la escena española de música afroamericana, en concreto en las subescenas de blues, jazz y soul-funk. Se trata de una etnografía centrada en el creciente protagonismo de las mujeres y aborda distintos eventos musicales, textos y artistas asociados a una diversidad de voces, identidades, discursos y emociones en la esfera pública. Metodológicamente, realizamos observación participante, entrevistas, documentación y análisis del discurso desde una perspectiva comunicativa y sociosemiótica. Indagamos en la escena de soul española, donde las cantantes afrodescendientes ocupan un rol protagonista, y examinamos en profundidad el caso de Aretha Soul Divas, un supergrupo de homenaje a Aretha Franklin. Los discursos analizados apuntan a la dimensión emocional de la experiencia musical, donde el encuentro entre artistas y públicos facilita el entendimiento mutuo y la liberación emocional. Además, constatamos la conexión entre las reivindicaciones enunciadas en la escena musical y las demandas del colectivo afrodescendiente en España, que denuncia el racismo y la falta de visibilidad. En esos espacios de confluencia emergen eventos, textos y discursos que contribuyen a la apasionada construcción de un territorio simbólico propio, donde lo individual se conjuga con lo colectivo.\n\nIn the flourishing economic environment of the late 1950s, an authentic restructuring within the Spanish music industry took place. Record catalogues would now no longer focus exclusively on folklore, copla, or classical music and instead began to take advantage of the new political and social developments that would soon encourage investment in this sector. The musicologist Celsa Alonso (2005) highlights in her study on Spanish beat the importance of the popular music of the 1960s in the social and cultural changes of “developmentalism”. The author raises the interpretation of the Spanish beat as a gamble of the “incipient record industry that saw an interesting market among young middle-class Spanish people” (Alonso, 2005: 229). Although this phenomenon of Anglo-Saxon musical importation could be approached from an exclusively commercial perspective, we cannot ignore the fact that, beneath this new music for the youth, a set of “institutional strategies whose objective was to build an image of normality, modernity and economic, social and cultural renewal” were also hidden (Ibid.). It is an indisputable fact that the new musical proposals at the beginning of this decade were a response to the need for expression, rebellion, and leisure of a youth markedly influenced by their Anglo-Saxon referents and the institutional use of this phenomenon. More importantly, Spanish beat music represented a new market for a record industry that had to respond to this phenomenon in two directions: adapting human resources on the one hand and technical resources on the other.\n\nThe interest for the female universe, their thoughts, and contributions has grown over the years. Research in several areas of knowledge has revealed the relevance of this contribution, at different times, including moments when women were not possible to make many appearances. In this sense, it is understood that, also, in the field of Music, the female contribution has been quite important, even though historiography has not yet presented many materials to substantiate this statement. In view of these assumptions, some questions arise: What have been the contributions of women in the making Brazilian music history? And, considering the importance of the female presence in Brazilian research, which women have been researching music and musical education over the years? Considering these issues, this research aimed to investigate the contribution of women in the making Brazilian music history, considering them as researchers. In order to conduct this research the methodology was structured in a qualitative approach, using documentary research and bibliographic research as methods, and also used document collection and Internet research as techniques for data collection. Data analysis was carried out through content analysis with theoretical references from sociology (Bourdieu, 2002), historical studies (Duby, 2009), and music education (Kraemer, 2000; Abeles; Hoffer; Klotner, 1984). It is understood that this research is relevant because by collecting and making the musical production of women public, whether as composers, interpreters or researchers, these data can integrate planning in music education. Therefore, it is intended to contribute to the creation of a culture of insertion for female production in music education, encouraging girls and women to launch themselves into the musical world as producers, in addition to reproducing the works produced by men throughout history."
