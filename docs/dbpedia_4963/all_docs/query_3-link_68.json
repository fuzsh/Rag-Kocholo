        "text": "Mya Byrne is ready to shine with a new album this year. The singer-songwriter’s new full-length, Rhinestone Tomboy, will be released on April 28 via Kill Rock Stars Nashville — the first album project for the legendary indie label’s new sister imprint.\n\nAlong with the announcement, Byrne has released the new song “It Don’t Fade” and its video. It’s an easygoing tune about resilience and hope that’s built around a funky, feel-good guitar figure and a spacious drum groove.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nMya Byrne Is Making Her Own Space in Nashville\n\nAaron Lee Tasjan Hates Technological Alienation, Loves Versatile Pop-Rock Songcraft on 'Tasjan!

Nashville artist Aaron Lee Tasjan produced the project, which includes 12 tracks, including the September single “Autumn Sun.” The project touches on themes of joy and struggle pulled directly from Byrne’s journey as a trans woman, as well as her experiences getting sober.\n\nRhinestone Tomboy tracklist:\n\n“It Don’t Fade”\n\n“I’m Gonna Stop”\n\n“Autumn Sun”\n\n“Devil in My Ear”\n\n“Come On”\n\n“Curtains”\n\n“Smoke and Bones”\n\n“Lend You a Hand”\n\n“Please Call Me Darlin’”\n\n“Sweetheart of Mine”\n\n“Don’t Hold Your Fire”\n\n“That’s What Lucky Means”\n\nBest of Rolling Stone\n\nAll 229 of Taylor Swift's Songs, Ranked\n\nThe Who's 50 Greatest Songs\n\nFleetwood Mac's 50 Greatest Songs"
