        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nThis week, catch the perfect pairing of Tuck & Patti in Palo Alto, get creative at the Mountain View Art and Wine Festival, catch some bluegrass at Filoli and more.\n\nTuck & Patti\n\nThe perfect pairing of guitarist Tuck Andress and vocalist Patti Cathcart play a special free show close to home on Sept. 8 in a concert presented by Earthwise Productions. The longtime duo, who are based on the Peninsula, have made an international name over the past 40 years or so for elegantly spare arrangements that get to the heart of the music — and quite a variety of music, too. Tuck & Patti work their magic in a variety of genres, including jazz to pop, gospel to folk. Cathcart’s rich vocals and Andress’ expressive way with the strings bring their own unique spin to everything from Duke Ellington to pop favorites like Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time.”\n\nSept. 8, 6 p.m. at Mitchell Park Bowl, 600 E. Meadow Drive, Palo Alto. Admission is free. eventbrite.com.\n\nMatilda the Musical\n\nYoung Matilda Wormwood is highly intelligent, uniquely gifted and mostly surrounded by adults who are total jerks. Fortunately, Matilda finds a way to navigate around — and devise a bit of comeuppance for — her awful parents and the child-hating headmistress at her school by using her magical psychokinetic powers. Palo Alto Players open their season with a musical adaptation of Matilda’s story. The show, which is full of hijinks and slightly absurd plot twists (as one would expect from a Dahl story) originated with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2010 and came to Broadway in 2013.\n\nSept. 8-24 at Lucie Stern Theatre, 1305 Middlefield Road, Palo Alto. Tickets are $30-$57. paplayers.org.\n\nMountain View Art and Wine Festival\n\nThe festival offers visitors the best of both worlds: browsing work in a variety of media by numerous artisans‚ as well as getting creative themselves with fun hands-on projects. Visitors to the festival can chat with artisans and craftspeople about their work, grab a bite at food trucks and enjoy gourmet offerings, local wine, craft beer and other beverages, and catch live entertainment on two stages, plus hear the performances of musicians strolling the event. Festivalgoers also can get in on the act themselves with the return of the mobile “Art Temple,” a collaborative mural that they can paint, with a DJ providing additional creative inspiration for participants. There’s also Italian chalk art street painting — while taking in the impressive works by pros, families can purchase a square and kids will have a chance to create their own street art.\n\nSept. 9, 11 a.m.-7 p.m. and Sept. 10, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. on Castro Street in downtown Mountain View. mvartwine.com.\n\nSignificant Other\n\nThe transition between 20-something single life to 30-something coupled-up bliss and how those rites of passage shake up friend groups — and lead to personal crises — is well-documented territory on stage and screen, but it’s rich territory for a reason. Playwright Dan Harmon’s romantic comedy “Significant Other” tells an “always the bridesmaid” story about Jordan, a gay man who grapples with his singledom and feeling stuck in life as he finds himself attending a trio of weddings for his three close female friends. Los Altos Stage Company opens its season with “Significant Other.”\n\nSept. 8-Oct. 1 at 97 Hillview Ave., Los Altos. $22-$45. losaltosstage.org.\n\nAccentuate the Positive\n\nMost everyone who navigated the last few years might relate to the title, “Accentuate the Positive,” which this concert certainly does, but the name actually comes from a 1944 hit that was recorded by several stars of the era, most notably crooner Bing Crosby with The Andrews Sisters. Jazz at the Ballroom brings together an ensemble of skilled jazz and swing musicians to perform favorites from the Great American Songbook, including the title song, in a program that highlights songs from the 1920s through the ’40s.\n\nSept. 8, 8 p.m. at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts, 500 Castro St., Mountain View. $18-$48. tickets.mvcpa.com.\n\nMya Byrne\n\nSinger-songwriter Mya Byrne draws together elements of Americana with touches of pop, blues, rockabilly and more and wraps it all up in a healthy twang. Her thoughtful, poetic lyrics bring strong imagery to songs that are backed up with driving bass and the soulful wail of guitar. Byrne is a leader for the presence of queer trans women in country and Americana and was one of the first two trans artists to play AmericanaFest, according to her website."
