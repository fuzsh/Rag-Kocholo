She has released two lauded albums of music to date, Moss (2022) and Blush (2020), both of which showcase her natural gift for songwriting and storytelling, as well as a knack for striking visual presentation with sleeve designs of her own creation. \"ThÃ©rÃ¨se,\" the lead single from Moss, garnered global attention with it's mesmerizing Brady Corbet-directed video - and tens of millions of streams - and saw Maya make an impressive network TV performance debut on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Maya and her band picked up a slew of rave reviews for sold out shows in the US and EU, as well as support slots for Bright Eyes and Faye Webster. Now 25 years old, Maya's third album, Chaos Angel, takes the spare, viscerally honest songwriting she has made her name on and goes deeper and bolder. Both her most sonically sophisticated and thematically nuanced collection to date, it feels like a culmination. Across these 10 songs, Hawke catalogs upheavals, revelations, foibles, and broken promises, all while navigating the patterns we repeat while reaching towards growth, wandering astray, and finding our way back to some core understanding of ourselves. Chaos Angel is also a document of Hawke coming more fully into her own as a musician. More adventurous in the studio after her previous two albums, Hawke leaned into her ambition. Many of these tracks are still anchored by acoustic guitar and Hawke's graceful yet conversational vocals, but their surroundings are more intricate and lush than ever before. She reconvened with longtime collaborators Benjamin Lazar Davis and Will Graefe, with Christian Lee Hutson serving as producer.\n\n$29.99\n\nQuick View\n\nPearl Jam\n\nDark Matter [LP]\n\nVinyl: $39.98 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nRock & Roll Hall Of Fame inductees, Pearl Jam, return with their highly anticipated new album Dark Matter.

Overcoming rejection to eventually become one of Canada's most successful rock bands of all time and selling millions of albums in the process, is a feel-good story for the ages.\n\nFor more than 40 years, Loverboy has been Working For The Weekend (and on the weekend), delighting audiences around the world since forming in 1979, when vocalist Mike Reno was introduced to guitar hot shot Paul Dean  both veterans of several bands on the Canadian scene  at Calgarys Refinery Night Club. Along with Reno and Dean, Loverboy still includes original members Doug Johnson on keyboards and Matt Frenette on drums, with Ken Spider Sinnaeve replacing the late Scott Smith on bass.\n\nWith their trademark red leather pants, bandannas, big rock sound and high-energy live shows, Loverboy has sold more than 10 million albums, earning several multi-platinum awards. Their string of hits includes, in addition to the anthem Working For The Weekend, such arena rock staples as The Kid Is Hot Tonight, Take Me To The Top, Turn Me Loose, Jump and many more. In 2009, the group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.\n\nLive In 82 showcases one of their most incredible live performances. Lovingly restored from Paul Dean's personal archive of 16mm film, the joyous energy of a band who helped define the golden era of 80's music is captured like lightning in a bottle. Colourful clothing, outrageous hairstyles (and headbands!), terrific movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Breakfast Club, and great music that has stood the test of time.\n\nPaul Dean summed it up best: \"The 1980s was an amazing time, but its still amazing now, he grins. The fact that Loverboy are still together and playing these same songs almost every night - Whod have thought?\n\n$28.34 ON SALE\n\nQuick View\n\nMedium Build\n\nCountry [CD]\n\nON SALE $11.99 CD: $11.47 Buy\n\nMedium Builds forthcoming albumCountry exists as a duality, running the spectrum of human emotions from playful optimism and visceral affirmations of life to heartbreak, loss, fear, and loneliness. Raised in Georgia, educated in Tennessee, and transformed in Alaska, his stories speak to the spectrum of those experiences and eagerly draw outside the clear lines of genre binaries  pulling from classic country, 80s new wave, '90s pop, and early 00's emo in equal measure. In another era, Medium Build might have just as easily been a rhinestone cowboy  lonesome out on the range, a blue-eyed crooner on a smooth-sailing yacht, or a leather-clad video star, but in the here and now, hes no one but himself.\n\n$11.47 ON SALE\n\nQuick View\n\nMedium Build\n\nCountry [LP]\n\nON SALE $29.99 Vinyl: $28.01 Buy\n\nVideo\n\nMedium Builds forthcoming albumCountry exists as a duality, running the spectrum of human emotions from playful optimism and visceral affirmations of life to heartbreak, loss, fear, and loneliness.

In February 2020, Isobel Campbell released her critically acclaimed solo album \"The Is No Other...\" which was featured on Rough Trade US & UK as Lead Album of the Month, Album of the week and playlists on the equivalent Radio 1s across Europe and charted at #16 on Top New Artists in the USA. 4316 is the first track to be taken from Isobels forthcoming album Bow To Love.\n\nIsobel talks about the track:\n\nI began writing 4316 back in 2017 when we lived in Los Feliz. Was out walking on Commonwealth, doing my little daily route with the pups each day whilst singing the chorus to myself.\n\nWe lived in a vibrant green Spanish carriage house at 4316 Kingswell Avenue back then. 4316 1/2 actually but I excluded the 1/2 because that wouldve been too clunky lyrically haha. The 1/2 was never an option!\n\nI finished writing 4316 at the close of 2022, a couple of years into living life collectively in the new normal. The world had gotten so strange we were really in it by then and theres no way were ever going back.\n\nWere living in unprecedented times to say the least. And I believe that to say Its been a strange few years would be an understatement. The microcosm that is my tiny human life has mirrored where were at too.\n\nI asked Chris ,whom I was co-producing alongside, to make me sound like a robot on the choruses to symbolize the collective shift into this deeper technological age of transhumanism and A.I. Where we go next is up to us. We are co-creators.\n\n$34.01 ON SALE\n\nQuick View\n\nKings Of Leon\n\nCan We Please Have Fun [CD]\n\nON SALE $13.99 CD: $13.95 Buy\n\nGRAMMY award-winning, multi-platinum rock band Kings of Leon are coming back big with their 9th full-length studio album, Can We Please Have Fun.
