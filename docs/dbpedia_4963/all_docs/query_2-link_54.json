        "text": "When gay Canadian singer k.d. lang began her career as a country musician in the ’80s, she struggled to win over an industry that saw something dishonest and even mocking in her approach. You can see her delightfully skewed performance of country sincerity in the video for “Turn Me Round,” a raucous cut from lang’s 1987 album Angel with a Lariat. Dressed in a bargain-bin approximation of cowgirl glamor, with her hair shorn into an imprecise mullet, lang twirls and growls her way across a honky-tonk stage as her male bandmates egg her on. She is, as music and queer studies scholar Shana Goldin-Perschbacher puts it, “totally fucking with gender.”\n\nlang’s fight for acceptance in an industry bent on excluding her is one of many fascinating case studies in Queer Country, a new book that examines the contributions of LGBTQ+ artists to country and Americana music. When Goldin-Perschbacher first started research for the book in 2004, most people she spoke to about the project reacted with bafflement: Did queer country artists even exist? It had been over a decade since a newly-out lang left the genre to find greater acclaim and commercial success as a torchy pop singer, and the spectacular backlash against the Chicks (née Dixie Chicks) a year prior had cemented the country music industry’s reputation as a bastion of conservative values.\n\nNow, what started as an underground scene appears to be reaching critical mass, with dedicated radio shows, zines, and even a gay country star in Brothers Osborne frontman T.J. Osborne (who isn’t alone in Nashville’s mainstream). Queer Country sketches out a rough history of this movement, spotlighting the contributions of lang and Lavender Country pioneer Patrick Haggerty, along with lesser-known figures including non-binary and trans musicians Rae Spoon, Joe Stevens, and Mya Byrne. It also features close-reads of contemporary stars like Lil Nas X, Orville Peck, Brandi Carlile, and Trixie Mattel, drawing a vivid portrait of a movement at a point of breakthrough.\n\nPitchfork: What is it about country music that keeps attracting queer artists, despite its perceived conservatism?\n\nShana Goldin-Perschbacher: I’d say these artists are drawn to its truthfulness and its sense of humor, its simplicity and its multiple layers of performance. The way that country music impacts listeners is really deep, on the level of family, community, regret, failure—things that everybody cares about. And it’s important for straight and cisgender listeners to hear queer and trans musicians sing about these topics. Sometimes queer and trans music is seen as something niche, and this is a way to shift that.\n\nThe concept of authenticity or “truth” frequently comes up in conversations about country music. Why can that be problematic for queer and trans people?\n\nFor queer people, we have to come out and reveal ourselves over and over again, and some listeners may respond to that by feeling like what they thought they knew about these artists is a lie. They may ask, “How could you keep this from me? Or lie to me?” There’s an essentialism to the expectation that artists are expressing some sort of inner truth. It doesn’t take into account an understanding of self as something that is unstable or a moving target.\n\nIn that way, I thought about the opportunities that country music offers in terms of truth-telling. I knew that would get me into the authenticity conversation, which is both so important and so overwrought. The standards of authenticity are so high that hardly any country musician can actually meet them. Even the straight, cisgender ones: How many of them are coming down from the mountains to play a show? Or jumping off the back of a horse? It’s absurd, what we expect of these artists.\n\nYou use the term “queer sincerity” to describe the way that queer artists are able to perform a certain kind of earnestness while maintaining an element of camp irony. Can you give an example of that?\n\nk.d. lang is a terrific person to talk about in this way, because she was basically accused of not being serious enough about her relationship to country music. People didn’t know if it was a joke or performance art. She explained that she was embracing the humor of country music as well as its emotional depth of earnestness and love. That’s an important part of camp—it’s humorous, but it’s also about a love attachment. lang was very inspired by Patsy Cline, who wanted to be seen as full-on country, and yet this was the moment of the Nashville Sound. Her music was being broadcast to a much bigger audience, so it was more smoothed over.\n\nThere’s this relationship to honky-tonk that country has, where that type of humor is sometimes seen as embarrassing, and then other times it's really appealing. lang was trying to embrace both of those elements of country music: the hillbilly humor and honky-tonk twang as well as the smoothness and glamor of the Nashville Sound. The element of queer sincerity there helps understand a lesbian relationship to those things, because she really mixes styles and toys with her audience. She’s flirting with them and teasing them about coming out and her relationship to this music.\n\nWhat does the success of figures like Lil Nas X, Orville Peck, and Trixie Mattel tell us about the current state of queer country?\n\nNone of those three need country music’s help to succeed. There was that whole debate about Lil Nas X and whether “Old Town Road” belonged on the country chart or not, but he’s laughing all the way to the bank. Orville Peck went through the rock world and is picking and choosing what he wants from country music. It’s probably pretty freeing to be able to take so much from country—the iconic looks, gestures, and vocality, the twang of the guitar and the dramatic storylines, even the geographic locations of music videos—without having to work your way up through Nashville and convince every single person that you belong even though you’re gay. Trixie Mattel uses drag to draw attention to her music, and she’s building an empire. She has a cosmetic line, a New York Times best-selling book, and her own show.\n\nThose three gay men are having enormous success on their own, but queer women musicians like Brandi Carlile, Allison Russell, and Amythyst Kiah are collaborating with one another and with straight women to get their foot in the door in the same way. Collaboration is really how some of these marginalized women musicians are able to have the moments of success that they have, which are often smaller than their male counterparts, unfortunately.\n\nWhy do you think Americana has been so much more welcoming of queer artists than mainstream country?\n\nAmericana is ambiguous in that it differentiates itself from country music while also picking particular country musicians to tell its coming-up story. The real difference has to do with its audience, which is assumed to have a more left-leaning political identification and higher socioeconomic status. Americana sees itself as a more progressive alternative to country, and it has certainly been able to market itself that way by welcoming a few performers of color and more women than mainstream country lets in. It also allows artists to be more explicit about their politics, because there isn’t this fear of turning away listeners if you’re too outspoken.\n\nStraight artists like Kacey Musgraves and Dolly Parton have played an important role in making queer and trans country listeners feel accepted. Why do you think these listeners feel such an attachment to Parton in particular?\n\nThere’s some really good work on Parton—Leigh H. Edward’s Dolly Parton, Gender, and Country Music and Lydia Hamessly’s Unlikely Angel: The Songs of Dolly Parton came out recently—and the way that she’s able to very slyly capture the authenticity debates at the core of country music. With her tenacity and business acumen in the face of enormous sexism, she’s figured out how to beat this setup where women over 30 can barely continue a country music career. In that way, her fight really resonates with queer listeners. Then there’s her gender drag, as Brian Firkus [aka Trixie Mattel] talks about in the book. She entered into a Dolly Parton lookalike contest and lost, which was a riot. She’ll sing “drag queen” instead of “Jolene.” I also imagine that her ability to continue attracting the love of the mainstream country music audience is reassuring to queer listeners. Like, maybe more people will come around if they like Dolly.\n\nNow that there are so many more visible queer and trans artists making country music, is there still a need for ally figures?\n\nOh, absolutely. Musgraves’ “Follow Your Arrow” was a big deal, and she was so explicit about thanking her co-writers [Shane McAnally and Brandy Clark, both of whom are gay] and explaining the politics of the song in terms of being inclusive. Jason Isbell featured a lot of different Black women country musicians, straight and queer, on tour last season, and that was a big deal. Kristen Chenoweth working with Ty Herndon and Chely Wright also comes to mind.\n\nThese folks are modeling what it looks like to be an ally, to care for your neighbors and to care for your family members. More and more families from all different political and religious persuasions have gay kids and trans kids, and they have to figure out how to navigate that. These straight and cisgender role models can be useful in modeling acceptance. At the same time, I think these artists realize that their credibility as artists is at stake if they can’t share that stage with a wide array of people. They cannot maintain this white-supremacist, patriarchal system in which only a certain group of people is allowed to succeed.\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
