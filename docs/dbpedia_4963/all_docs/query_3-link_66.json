        "text": "Artist: Mya Byrne\n\nHometown: San Francisco, California\n\nSong: “I’m Gonna Stop”\n\nAlbum: Rhinestone Tomboy\n\nRelease Date: April 28, 2023\n\nLabel: Kill Rock Stars Nashville\n\nIn Their Words: “Sometimes, I’m lucky enough to catch fire — I’ll be in the middle of a rehearsal or even a live solo performance, and get a feeling in my gut, like when you know it’s time to say ‘I love you’ to someone you haven’t said it to yet — and I’ll improvise a complete song into my recorder. And that’s what happened here, in a full-rock session. I had a ton on my mind that day, specifically how much I still felt connected to a former partner from years before, and how so many of my other relationships had, in some way, replayed that. I liked the idea of taking a break from being in love with people, acknowledging how a first kiss can drive an entire new relationship, and how, at least for that time frame, it might be a good idea to just go back to how I was as a child, before certain kinds of relationships were present in my life, before I so often was driven by the excitement of those new relationships, to get some perspective.” — Mya Byrne\n\nPhoto Credit: Tui Jordan"
