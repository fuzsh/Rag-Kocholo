        "meta_description": "Gold Country / Country Gold by Secret Emchy Society, released 20 May 2022\n\n1. Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other [Explicit]\n2. Think I Do\n3. Live Wire\n4. Another Time &amp; Place\n5. I Wish I Was In Texas With You\n6. Rye Whiskey Baby\n7. Bars Are Closing\n8. Birch Bones Redux\n9. Oceola\n10. My Old Flame\n11. Something About the Moon\n12. Murdered Your Bourbon\n13. **Bonus** Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other [Radio Edit]\n\n&quot;Gold Country ~ Country Gold from Secret Emchy Society is brilliant, delicate, and fucking hilarious. If you think Emchy is a country singer, she is. If you think she’s a poet, she is. The breadth and depth of her lyrics are astonishing. The album itself revolves around how people pull together and come apart, it’s about being human and the rollercoaster that involves. She evokes dramatic mood swings throughout the entire release, from lost love, to the pandemic, to fucking and drinking whiskey all on the same album.” \r\n- Patrick Haggerty (Lavender Country)\r\n\r\n&quot;In a world of frat dudes singing about Applebees, Gold Country ~ Country Gold is a welcome middle finger to modern country, offering up a brand of smoke-filled honky-tonk that&#39;s traditional as they come -- albeit delivered with a fiery, punk disposition. Also &#39;Think I Do&#39; is the jam&quot; \r\n- Cory &quot;Round Up&quot; Graves (Vandoliers). \r\n\r\n&quot;With their gorgeous new album, &quot;Gold Country ~ Country Gold&quot;, Secret Emchy Society finds honky-tonk’s rollicking queer heart.&quot; \r\n- Karen Pittelman (Karen &amp; the Sorrows)\r\n\r\n&quot;The album is so wonderful - giving a real Mad Max in Silverado vibe...&quot; \r\n- Jake Blount (Award-winning musician / Board Member Bluegrass Pride)\r\n\r\n&quot;With &quot;Gold Country...&quot;, Cindy Emch further cements herself as the undisputed queen of California queer country twang. Some of the songs are deeply present as if she were in the room with you yesterday, and some of them sound gritty, like they were recorded in 1952 right after a Hank Williams session. Put all together, it’s the kind of record that you can’t skip a single song, full of all the emotion from the last two years of living in a very changed America.&quot; \r\n- Mya Byrne (singer/songwriter)\r\n\r\nSECRET EMCHY SOCIETY &#39;GOLD COUNTRY/COUNTRY GOLD VINYL&#39; (BROKEN CLOVER RECORDS/USA IMPORT) \r\n\r\nSECRET EMCHY SOCIETY is formed around American singer/songwriter/guitarist CINDY EMCHY, and under this moniker she has already released a couple of records. Gold Country/Country Gold is the 4th album as SECRET EMCHY SOCIETY, which musically speaking is described as acoustic gypsy punk, Americana, ghost town country, murder ballads, and drinking songs. Acoustic bluesy country might also be a good way to describe the music, and thanks to the strong vocals of Cindy it is a pleasure to listen to the 13 songs on the new album. Additional musicians are Terri Upton (Backing Vocals), Tolan McNeil (Backing Vocals, Lead Guitar), Mya Byrne (Backing Vocals, Mandolin), Michele Kappel (Backing Vocals, Percussion), Carolyn Mark (Backing Vocals, Piano), Hank Pine (Cello), Dennis Siemens (Double Bass [Upright Bass]), Hans Winold ((Double Bass [Upright Bass]), Marc Atkinson (Drums, Bass, Lead Guitar), Sean Malroy (Fiddle), Andrew Waegel (Pedal Steel Guitar) and Dave Lang (Vocals, Guitar). Favorite songs for me personally are Think I Do, Birch Bones Redux and Something About The Moon. As soon as the album starts with the 1981 NED SUBLETTE cover Cowboys Are Frequently Secretly Fond Of Each Other you can hear Cindy has a lot of talent, both with her voice and playing the guitar. There is something unique going down here on this album, so I will not make any comparisons, and it&#39;s therefore best to check it out for yourself. The album is available through https://brokencloverrecords.bandcamp.com/ and more information can be found at: https://emchy.bandcamp.com/ \r\n\r\n(Points: 8.0 out of 10) \r\n-Gabor (Strutter&#39;zine)",
