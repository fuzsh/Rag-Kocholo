        "text": "Mile of Music in Appleton Wisconsin is a festival of staggering proportions. The event, celebrating its 10th iteration in 2023, doesn’t feel like it when you’re walking around the city, nor attending an individual show. It doesn’t even quite hit you when you’re combing through the lineup beforehand making a wishlist and piecing together an itinerary (though that is something of a feat, even with their comprehensive app. I admit I had ChatGPT pitch in on planning my schedule!).\n\nFor me, its scope truly hit home while writing this article. Having felt like I’d packed my days with an impressive number of shows, I added them all up and compared them with the overall festival stats. I managed to see 18 acts in 22 sets at 14 venues. Not bad, huh? Well, the festival comprises 200-plus acts, 700-plus shows, and 40-plus venues. That means I hit less than 10% of the acts, 3% of the shows and 35% of the venues. Damn.\n\nOnly a portion of the artists are Americana (thank GAWD or my task would’ve been even more daunting), but even filtering my choices that way, I had myriad choices, and several of them are acts I’ve been waiting to hear live for months or even years. As I put together a dream schedule, I was struck by how many of the names on my list were artists of color, queer acts or women. As we know all too well, Americana (especially the country side of it) has lagged embarrassingly on giving these groups a platform and chances to grow, especially at festivals. So I was quite impressed that without really trying, I’d put together a really diverse show list. It speaks to Mile of Music’s inclusionary booking that doesn’t feel at all like tokenism.\n\nDespite having studied the map and Googled directions between venues (everything really is roughly within a square mile), it was hard to predict how this festival, which can draw upwards of 80,000 visitors in the course of its four days, would feel. Although the schedule didn’t include any big arena acts, there were definitely some well-known and buzzed-about artists. Would it be chaotic, crowded, confusing? All we could do was dive in and see for ourselves.\n\nDay One\n\nFirst impressions as we drove in Thursday afternoon were interesting: The streets were quiet, almost sleepy. A trickle of folks with instruments slung on their backs were checking into the Hilton Appleton Paper Valley—one of the epicenters of the festival—and signage about the event were plastered all over the small city, but other than that it didn’t feel like I’d stepped into the middle of a massive festival.\n\nNext up for me was Crys Matthews at Mondo! Wine Bar & Retail, a small cozy venue that took its listening room status seriously: “Quiet please, artists at work” signs were prominently placed on stage, and the emcee made a point of it too. I was excited to see this artist live and was not disappointed. The social-justice-focused songwriter, born in North Carolina (child of a preacher) and now based in Tennessee, opened with “Exactly Where You Are,” a hopeful, welcoming song about finding empathy and common ground, with the refrain “no us and them, just me and you.” That was followed by the award-winning “Changemakers,” the title song from her most recent album.\n\nMatthews talked about Tennessee’s recent anti-LGBTQ legislation and how even her love songs feel political now. “So my sets just keep getting gayer,” she said before launching into “Oklahoma Sunrise.” Between the social justice protest songs and queer love ballads, I lost count of how many times I swallowed back a lump in my throat.\n\nI stayed at Mondo to see another North Carolina artist I’ve been wanting to see for a while: Nikki Morgan. She came into her own as an artist during a decade spent in Chicago before moving back to her home state. Her giggly Southern charm in her stage patter (she described herself as a “second generation preacher kid” since her grandfathers were bishops) contrasted with intense, eloquent and occasionally sweary vocals.\n\nBetween clever, emotional, observant and surprisingly gritty relationship songs, Morgan talked about having speech problems growing up and how it made her work even harder to express herself with words. Her way with lyrics is striking, such as the pitch-perfect line “Learning to love is such a fragile art.” Her sound, generally a contemporary folk style, took some intriguing detours, like a Sun Studio-era early rock ’n’ roll feel in one original, and what she described as “really weird tuning” in another that resulted in a haunting Radiohead-esque feel to the song.\n\nA block over from Mondo, I next caught one of my local Twin Cities faves, folk singer-songwriter Luke Callen, at D2 Sports Pub. He and his stalwart band (drummer Chris Gray, guitarist James Patrick Horigan and bass player Lauren Anderson) battled a long journey (they’d gotten off track and only arrived 30 minutes before the set), a freak rainstorm (the patio venue did have partial cover, so it was more distracting than anything), and sound system issues that never fully went away.\n\nNevertheless, they managed to deliver a great set. Luke’s songs and style are incredibly versatile, so they can always be tailored to the occasion, whether it’s an intimate listening room or a loud sports bar like D2. I was glad to hear “Some Reason,” an unreleased single off his upcoming album that can currently only be found in a field recording on YouTube.\n\nI headed back to D2 next to see Paisley Fields. Originally from Iowa and now New York City-based, Fields (he adopted the stage name about five years ago; before that it was his band name) has connections to the drag world and it shows. He’s fond of over-the-top attire such as the pink harness and sparkly gold cowboy hat he wore at D2. Like queer pop-punk rockers Pansy Division, Fields isn’t afraid of poignant songs about uniquely gay struggles but also leans into joyfully silly material. “I’m gonna do a song about gay sex,” he said, before launching into “Ride Me Cowboy.” After the chorus (which ends “Look deep in my eyes, put your hands on my thighs / And ride, ride, ride”), he added, “I never said it was subtle.”\n\nThis radiantly radical act is a joy to watch, and the set got even more special when another New York artist I was eagerly anticipating seeing at Mile of Music, Mya Byrne, joined in for a couple songs, including their recent duet “Burn This Statehouse Down” which they co-wrote in response to Tennesdee’s anti-drag legislation.\n\nDay Two\n\nThe streets of Appleton were much busier on Friday (and remained that way for the rest of the festival), but still didn’t feel overwhelming. Thanks to the number of simultaneous shows, the venues I visited never felt overcrowded.\n\nAfter my long first day of travel and shows, it was a struggle to even get out for a noon show. But once I got to Mondo, the electric fingerstyle country blues guitar of Mike Munson (with expert washboard backup from Twin Cities mainstay Mikkel Beckmen) was like a double espresso that jumpstarted my energy and enthusiasm for the day. Munson, a fellow Minnesotan, had performed in the second and third Mile of Music events, but this was his first one in years.\n\nAlthough I generally prefer music with lyrics and singing, one of his instrumental songs was a surprise highlight for me. “Rosehill” starts soft and jazzy, building intensity as it goes. Munson explained it was a “meditation on one of my favorite spots in Mississippi, Rosehill Road.” He complimented but gently egged on the listening crowd; “You’re doing such a good job of not talking; you can let out a sigh if you need to.” It was enough to loosen them up so when he mused, “I don’t know whether to chill or rock,” the audience response was definitive: “Rock!” Munson obliged with a blistering blues rocker.\n\nCoincidentally, the next act on my itinerary was Callen’s partner Siri Undlin aka Humbird at Jones Park. This outdoor venue had a huge stage facing an open field, a striking contrast to the smaller spaces I’d been frequenting for most of the festival. Undlin has not only played at Mile of Music before but many other times in Appleton. “We keep coming back here because this is a great music town and people are so supportive,” she said.\n\nHumbird has a number of micro-love songs about 20-30 seconds long, and they performed one of them, slowed way down (it was still less than a minute). “This is our fourth show in two days and we’re just having fun now, trying new things and making different choices,” Undlin explained. “No set is the same; I’m sure that’s true of a lot of the bands here. That’s what makes it special.”\n\nOne of her songs’ lyrics celebrated our own shared “music town” of Minneapolis, with references to the cross streets of the 331 Club and a line about Mikkel (the washboardist I’d seen earlier with Mike Munson) playing there with someone new on a Sunday afternoon. (Mikkel very frequently appears with different artists, at the 331 and many other Twin Cities venues.) Another highlight was Humbird’s new single “Help Me Willie Nelson.” (“Not a joke,” she said in the intro. “I really do need Willie Nelson to help me, and I’m reaching out the best way I know how!”)\n\nFor a complete change of pace, I next caught Mae Simpson on the outdoor stage at Emmett’s Bar and Grill. One of the charms of a festival like this is that you can walk a couple minutes and go from a listening room to a party atmosphere complete with beer tents and food trucks. Simpson and her band were the perfect act to draw people in with their infectiously joyful funk/soul sound, her charm and powerful vocals, and the band’s musical showmanship. Their new tune “Minnehaha Mama” had just dropped that day, Simpson noted, making the set an unofficial single release celebration show.\n\nThe new track, which opens with some Prince-esque falsetto crooning, is a perfect bop of a love song to a girl, as sweet and sunny as ice cream on a summer day.\n\nThe last act I saw on day two was Gabe Lee at Hilton Paper Valley Evergreen Listening Room. (It was handy to have the last set in the hotel I was staying at!) This was another act I’ve been impatiently waiting to come through the Midwest. Lee discussed his newly released album, Drink the River. After two very plugged-in records, he said, he brought some of his bluegrass friends into the studio and created a much more traditional sound.\n\nLee talked about his own lived experiences as a Nashville-born son of Taiwanese immigrants, but Drink the River, he explained, is about telling other people’s stories. He related the backstory of “Marigold,” about a man whose wife passed away and left him with small kids. Singing that song to us in Appleton WI, Lee said, was why traveling musicians’ work is important: “We’re bringing stories to places that might not ever hear them. Here’s a little piece of a 200-person town in Mississippi.”\n\nI was blown away by this engaging set, not only the amazing storytelling songs but the fascinating talk in between about songwriting and empathy and the role of traveling artists. I returned to my hotel room feeling pensive and emotional and just so glad about live music and festivals like this.\n\nDay Three\n\nI knew this day contained hours of back-to-back sets for me, so I got an even later start than the day before. The first act for me Saturday was Gabe Lee once again. I definitely wanted more after the previous night, and plus this gig was a uniquely Mile of Music experience that I just had to try. Lee performed on the Mile of Music Bus (aka the Band Wagon), which takes a 20-minute spin around Appleton while an act attempts to stay upright and not get carsick while also putting on a show. It is wild and it’s amazing.\n\nKnowing that the bus is super popular but has limited capacity, I got in line an hour before Lee’s set to be one of the chosen few. In striking contrast to his philosophical bent the night before, Lee’s between-song patter mainly consisted of fictional Houdini anecdotes about places we were passing that all ended in the punchline “And that’s why he wanted to disappear.” (I eventually looked it up and learned that Houdini lived in Appleton for about four years–his family moved there from Hungary when he was a toddler–and he considered it his hometown.) Lee’s songs still packed an emotional punch despite the hilarious precarious situation, and I left the bus an even bigger Gabe Lee fan (and in awe of Mile’s creativity)!\n\nNext it was off to a brewpub, Appleton Beer Factory, to see Sway Wild. I’ve missed this act the last couple times they came to Minneapolis, so I was excited to finally catch them live! With their sound ranging from island-flavored jazz rock to outlaw country, this married duo from Washington (who’ve played together for 13 years) is hard to categorize, but has some common threads: gorgeous harmonies, engaging melodies, and killer electric guitar from Mandy Fer (who also tours with Allison Russell as her lead guitarist).\n\nGetting serious mid-set, Fer introduced “Waves of the Wind” by talking about white privilege—that none of us living today invented racism but that we can all do something to fight it. “We have to be better; we can be better than this,” she said, getting choked up. “Events like this are so important,” she added, for being able to come together over important issues. The refrain reminds us, “We’ve got a long ways to go / For every human to feel whole.” Sway Wild also walks the walk: a portion of proceeds from the single go towards Black Mamas Matter Alliance. This wasn’t the first or last time at this festival that I was reminded of the importance of music—live music especially—beyond the sheer enjoyment it can bring.\n\nMy first show of the last day was the only one I attended outside my planned itinerary, based on a last-minute recommendation. I returned to The 513 for Appleton-based Christopher Gold. New to me, this singer-songwriter has apparently played every Mile (this is his 10th)! I was drawn in by his beautiful voice, fingerpicking and lyrics. His stage patter had impeccable comic timing that kept everyone engaged, and he ended the show (as he often does) by doing a fun, touching duet with his teenage son on vocals and harmonica.\n\nAfter that, I couldn’t resist another repeat performance next: Adeem the Artist, this time at McGuinness Irish Pub. Once again they had the crowd in stitches at times, like when we joined a call-and-response on “Going to Hell” (“Do you really want to go to heaven?” “NO!”...”Do you want to go to hell?” “Okay?”).\n\nBut they also wrecked us with “Middle of the Heart,” a song about a young soldier who comes home with PTSD and takes his own life. Every song, whether it made us laugh or cry, insisted on looking past glib answers and status-quo thinking to acknowledge that the world is messy and messed-up (but still worth trying to save).\n\nI could tell a lot of people in the venue were connecting with the music and messages as much as I was, but not everyone: On my way out, I heard two audience members talking with a condescending air that felt like it was glossing over some defensiveness. “I don’t know that I liked him but he made me laugh,” said the older woman (not correcting herself after misgendering them). The man she was with agreed in a similar tone: “No, he wasn’t that good but it was funny.” Their reaction was unfortunately predictable, but I knew Adeem had gotten through to a lot of other people in attendance—and even this couple’s defensiveness showed that the set had made an impression on them."
