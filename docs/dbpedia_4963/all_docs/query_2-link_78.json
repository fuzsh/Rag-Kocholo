        "text": "The Alabama Shakes singer exploded preconceptions with her 2019 solo debut. On What Now, a follow-up born from a few years of life-quaking resets, she's ready to leave any remaining limits behind.\n\nLuke Combs' cover of Tracy Chapman's 1988 hit \"Fast Car\" won single of the year. Chapman got song of the year â€” making her the first Black songwriter to win in that category.\n\nMya Byrne loved country music since her childhood in New Jersey. But it took years of searching and traveling to lead to the place where she could make her new album, Rhinestone Tomboy.\n\nLoretta Lynn, the country music star who brought unparalleled candor about the domestic realities of working-class women to country songwriting, died at her home in Tennessee on Tuesday. She was 90.\n\nMadi Diaz had much to process leading up to her new album, History of a Feeling: moving home to Nashville from L.A., reestablishing herself as a solo artist and splitting from her partner."
