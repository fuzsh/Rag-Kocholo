        "meta_description": "Where the Lavender Grows by Mya Byrne, released 13 May 2022\n\nWhere the Lavender Grows\nI was told that freedom comes \nFrom going through the narrowest place \nWe found each other on the way there \nFelt like some kinda mutual grace \nBut there’s something pulling us in opposite directions \nand you can’t predict anything for sure\nBut if we find our way to any shared tomorrow \nThere’s somewhere I think we should go \nWe’ve come together this far \nDifferent paces on the same road\nIf we stray too much apart \nOh…Meet me where the lavender grows \nThere’s a stone wall facing sunset\nIn a field underneath an oak tree \nIf we get lost or distant\nI’ll wait there til you find me \nIt won’t be hard to get there \nIt’s as east as you can go \nOn the island where I was born \nJust north of the south shore \nWe’ve come together this far\nDifferent paces on the same road\nIf we stray too much apart \nOh… Meet me where the lavender grows \nIt could be days, it could be months, it could be weeks \nJust wait for winter to fade\nI’ll come around in the early afternoons \nWhen blossoms bloom in May\nI’ll be there every day\nNo one really goes it alone \nNo matter how alone we think we are\nYou and me we’re just like everyone else \nJust people trying to make a fresh start \nwe’ve gone through some of the hardest times \nAnd that can make any distance seem true\nBut one day we might have a chance to stop running \nAnd I’ll be there waiting for you  \nWe’ve come together this far\nDifferent paces on the same road\nIf we stray too much apart \nOh…Meet me where the lavender grows \nOh…Meet me where the lavender grows \nMeet me where the lavender grows",
