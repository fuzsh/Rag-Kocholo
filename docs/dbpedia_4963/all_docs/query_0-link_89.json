Shah about public health, COVID-19, and gender-diverse people in Washington.\n\nPresented on Facebook and YouTube. (Click desired link below. Event will go live at 4:00pm PST.

Over his career, he has made contributions as a clinician, innovator, educator, and leader.\n\nRecently featured on Reba’s Top Ten remix of “I’m A Survivor” (on mandolin & lap steel), at AmericanaFest 2021, and in Rolling Stone, Mya Byrne’s “rootsy, soulful” tunes (Time Out) and electrifying performances draw comparisons to Lucinda Williams, Chris Stapleton, and The Band. Her new LP, produced by Aaron Lee Tasjan, is due out in 2022.\n\nShe’s performed on many great stages, including Berkeley Rep, San Francisco’s Dyke March and Trans March, Levon Helm’s Ramble, and the Philadelphia Folk Festival.
