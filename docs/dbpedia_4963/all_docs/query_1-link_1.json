There's a lot of grappling with the balance between bailing out the boat and rowing at the same timethe experience of writing music and playing songs while trying, as we all are right now, to make sense of a world that feels like it's changing really quickly. On his eleventh studio album, Transmissions, singer-songwriter Lee continues to expand his sonic range while sharpening his closely observed lyrics that squarely address death, aging, and love. The force behind such acclaimed albums as Mission Bell and Mountains of Sorrow, Rivers of Song, ever since his gold-selling 2005 debut Lee has been known for his association with a long list of collaborators and touring partners, from Paul Simon to Zac Brown Band. For the new project, he craved a return to an old-school style of recording, working with his longtime band in a studio in rural Marlboro, New York that was built by drummer Lee Falco and his dad out of reclaimed wood from an old church (its exactly what youd think a studio in upstate New York should be, notes Lee). Playing live on the floor for long hours, in close quarters, they were able to capture the albums twelve songs in less than a week. I really wanted us to be all in the room, making music together, listening to each other and responding to each other, says Lee. In this age where you can do everything at home and fly it in, theres something really beautiful about getting in a room and starting at the top, the drummer counting in the song and everybody just playing. I would call it vulnerability.\n\nWe began writing this record on New Years Day 2023. With that sentiment we felt like it was destined to be a totally new experience and we truly put our best feet forward. Since MILLY began, it was pretty much just myself writing everything but with this record it was much different. We solidified our lineup and we worked as hard as we could together, meeting 2 - 3 times a week for 6 months and playing music as a band because we wanted the record to have that feel. It sounds silly saying it that way as we are a rock band, but we had never spent more than a week or two actually preparing in a room before recording in the past. Everything previously was done very on the fly whereas this record we tried as many things as we coul d and used our heads. We talked about music a lot, and the way we wanted people to feel when they heard our new stuff -- the way that we feel when we listen to our favorites. We kept pondering if we could reinvent the wheel for ourselves in some way, even if minor.. just to feel a bit different and fresh. A large majority of the songs originated from jams that we recorded in our practice space and then I took home and chopped up. Once Sonny got involved, he really helped us structure everything all together nicely. We took rehearsing and pre production extremely seriously the way Nirvana did before tracking Nevermind and we are very proud of the raw live feeling that this album has. Though we are now a 4 piece band, for this process it was the 3 of us (Brend an, Yarden, Conner) so a lot of trios were in the back of our heads for inspiration (Failure, Nirvana, Dinosaur Jr), especially in the guitar category. It felt like picking a guitar up for the first time in some ways, trying to reinvent my regular playing style as much as I could.\n\nThree time Grammy nominated Hiatus Kaiyote return with their eagerly anticipated new album Love Heart Cheat Code. The band have warmed up fans with standout single 'Everything's Beautiful' and what awaits is a masterfully crafted album from a band who are firing on all cylinders and totally in sync. LHCC is a mix of their classic neo-soul sound, fused with jazz, soul and rock - which is on full display on their cover of the Jefferson Airplane classic 'White Rabbit' and a fan favorite from their live shows, 'Cinnamon Temple'. The album also includes a feature from BMO from the cult classic animated series Adventure Time (Cartoon Network/Adult Swim). Throughout the campaign the band will build a bright and vibrant world for fans to dive into, with games, artifacts, mazes and all other matter of zaniness that one can expect from Hiatus Kaiyote. Just ahead of album release the band will be embarking on a 19 day US tour, which includes stops at Montreal and Toronto Jazz Fests and Electric Forest.\n\nMerriweather Post Pavilion, Animal Collective's ninth studio album, sees the American art-rock collective in heartwarmingly baffling form, combining upbeat indietronica with mind-warping samples. For its 15th anniversary, the 2xLP has been pressed on color vinyl for the first time, Bluish and Translucent Green, and is housed in a reflective foil deluxe gatefold jacket.\n\nMerriweather Post Pavilion was universally acclaimed upon its release in 2009 and was named the #1 best album of the year by Pitchfork, Entertainment Weekly, Spin, and KEXP. Every once in a while, musicians sweep away the existing musical landscape to create something new, stated NPR at the time. Animal Collective is such a group, and its new Merriweather Post Pavilion is such an album. It has since been recognized as one of the most influential records of the 2000s. When it comes to 2000s indie, Merriweather stands as the eras alpha and omega, Pitchfork has written, a diamond-cut reflection of the eras eccentricities, seemingly impossible to replicate in form or format.\n\nThe Felice Brothers first emerged from the Hudson Valley nearly two decades ago with a gloriously ramshackle sound that drew on everything from Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan to Walt Whitman and Flannery OConnor. In just a few short years, the group went from busking in the subway to playing Radio City Music Hall with Bright Eyes and appearing everywhere from the Newport Folk Festival to Levon Helms Midnight Ramble. Beginning with 2007s Tonight At The Arizona, the band helped pave the way for the modern folk revival, while at the same time challenging its boundaries and conventions with bold sonic experimentation and unyielding integrity. The New York Times likened their music to the rootsy mysticism of the Band, while Rolling Stone praised the scrappiness of their folk-rock noir, and The Guardian hailed their songs as impeccably crafted, with literary-minded lyrics that are both playful and profound.\n\nThe bands newest record, Valley of Abandoned Songs, marks The Felice Brothers debut for Conor Obersts new Million Stars label and showcases the group at their most intimate and unvarnished. Balancing hope and despair in equal measure, the album explores the search for meaning and connection through the eyes of a wide-ranging cast of misfits and outcasts, and though the recordings here span several years of almost-lost tunes, the result is a thoroughly cohesive collection that manages to feel both utterly timeless and particularly attuned to the present all at once.\n\nSongs in A&E is a beautiful, chilling record and it was very nearly the last thing J Spaceman would ever release. In 2005, with the writing and recording well underway, Spaceman was rushed to the Royal London Infirmary with double pneumonia. The sleeve of this reissue is a photograph taken as he lay in what his close friends and family feared at the time was his deathbed. We thought hed gone, recalled band mate John Coxon at the time. The album is collection of graceful, country-influenced songs that muse on familiar themes of love, death, hope and hopelessness. The country element was informed by a small black 1928 Gibson acoustic hed bought in Cincinnati while the band toured the Amazing Grace record. Spaceman called it The Devil. J Spaceman: Mostly, when you buy a guitar, like most things, you don't really have any idea of whether it's good or not. And this shop had about eight of the same models for comparison, but this one was in a cage, to keep people away from it, like they knew it was kind of special. And it's beautiful. It just sings. And it kind of came with those songs, which is obviously a sort of romantic notion, but it really felt like it did. I'd never written on a guitar until this point and it seemed to come with all of this information.\n\nDespite the albums playful title, Cales second album in just over a year still contains the same feelings of fierce and inquisitive rage that were present in 2023 album MERCY. He remains angry, still incensed by the willful destruction that unchecked capitalists and unrepentant conmen have hoisted upon the wonders of this world and the goodness of its people. But this is not at all MERCY II, or some collection of castoffs, as throughout his career of more than six decades, Cale has never been much for repetition. His vanguard-shaping enthusiasms have shifted among ecstatic classicism and unbound rock, classic songcraft and electronic reimagination with proud restlessness.\n\nAnd so, on POPtical Illusion, he foregoes the illustrious cast to burrow mostly alone into mazes of synthesizers and samples, organs and pianos, with words that, as far as Cale goes, constitute a sort of swirling hope, a sage insistence that change is yet possible. Produced by Cale and longtime artistic partner Nita Scott, POPtical Illusion is the work of someone trying to turn toward the future  exactly as Cale always has.\n\nFor over 20 years, The Decemberists have been one of the most original, daring, and thrilling American rock bands. Their distinctive brand of hyperliterate folk-rock set them apart from the start, releasing nine full-length albums that are unbound by genre and highly ambitious. Now the beloved indie band is back with their first new album in six years, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again - not only the longest Decemberists album to date (and their first intentional, proper double-LP) but also their most empathetic and accessible, its 13 songs like semaphores of mutual recognition for our fraught times and faint hope. The first dozen songs are punchy, pithy gems all, reflections on mortality and loneliness, longing and cynicism, expectation and unease. The band animates them brilliantly, pushing out and pulling in at the perfect moments. John Moen practically dances beneath the jangle of opener Burial Ground, breathing the life into this song about spiraling toward the end. From the irrepressible Oh No!\" and guileless tenderness and absolute surrender of All I Want Is You, to the romantic ghost story that shimmers behind pedal steel in spite of the specter in \"Long White Veil,\" these 12 songs alone would constitute a dazzling Decemberists album, rich with woe and love, anxiety and honesty. But a keening little choir and arid electric guitar invoke Joan in the Garden, the bands first full-on prog escapade since The Crane Wife. Though rooted in doubt, much like the album it ends, Joan in the Garden ultimately lands as a celebration of musics ability to convey valence and ambiguity, to frame an endlessly complicated story in instantly compelling terms.\n\nThis, songwriter Colin Meloy will tell you proudly, is the best Decemberists albums and perhaps the ultimate realization of 22 years of work. In many ways, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again feels like an aptly titled renewal for The Decemberists. The first full-length release on YABB Records, the bands own label, after a run of nearly two decades with Capitol. As they were once, here are the Decemberists again, now an independent band empowered by singing stories that sound instantly familiar and convey some bit of hard-won wisdom.\n\nNot a lot of people talk about the true origins of bluegrass music, says Swamp Dogg, but it came from Black people. The banjo, the washtub, all that stuff started with African Americans. We were playing it before it even had a name.\n\nBlackgrass, Swamp Doggs remarkable new album, is no history lesson, though. Produced by Ryan Olson (Bon Iver, Poliça) and recorded with an all-star band including Noam Pikelny, Sierra Hull, Jerry Douglas, Chris Scruggs, Billy Contreras, and Kenny Vaughan, the collection is a riotous blend of past and present, mixing the sacred and the profane in typical Swamp Dogg fashion as it blurs the lines between folk, roots, country, blues, and soul. The tracklist is an eclectic onebrand new originals and vintage Swamp Dogg classics sit side by side with reimaginings of 70s R&B hits and timeless 50s pop tunesbut the performances are thoroughly cohesive, filtering everything through a progressive Appalachian lens that nods to tradition without ever being bound by it. Special guests like Margo Price, Jenny Lewis, Justin Vernon, and The Cactus Blossoms all add to the excitement here, but its ultimately the 81-year-old Swamp Doggs deliverysly and playful and full of genuine joy and achethat steals the show. The result is a record thats as reverent as it is raunchy, a collection that challenges conventional notions of genre and race while at the same time celebrating the music that helped make Swamp Dogg the beloved iconoclast hes known as today."
