        "text": "Willie Jones is rolling right along into spring and summer time with his new uptempo jam, \"Them Girls Do.\" Penned by Jones, Nick Autry and Justin Ebach, the pop-inflected number finds the singer marveling at a woman's demure and wild sides.\n\n\"Them girls do everything wrong at the right time / Raised right but they sure got a wild side / A little Sunday morning and a little Friday night / Got the devil on their shoulder, and an angel in their eyes,\" he sings in the jaunty chorus.\n\nOf the track, Jones says they \"wanted a different type of party vibe and when those opening banjo licks get goin', you just wanna turn up.\"\n\n\"I'm not afraid of a little mischief, but most of the time, it ain't me starting it; it's 'Them Girls,'\" he quips. -- Jeremy Chua\n\nMya Byrne continues teasing the release of her Kill Rock Stars debut Rhinestone Tomboy with the slinky, nostalgic \"Lend You a Hand.\"\n\nWith Aaron Lee Tasjan in the producer's chair, Byrne crafts a comforting song that is redolent with the warmth and experimentation of '70s power pop.\n\nByrne's performance is pleading, elevating the track beyond that of a concerned lover into a soul desperately trying to reach another. With the homey instrumentation backing Byrne up, we sense that solace can and will be found. -- Rachel Cholst\n\nCaylee Hammack is back with \"All or Nothing,\" her first new song in over two years. The effervescent, groovy number showcases Hammack's feistiness and sass as she professes to her love, \"If you want a little it of my love, it's all or nothing.\"\n\nThis ultimatum gradually builds up to the bridge and final chorus bridge as Hammack and co-producer Dan Huff kick things up a notch to match the Georgia native's impeccable emotionally-driven vocal cry.\n\n\"'All or Nothing' has been persistently burning through my pocket since we wrote it,\" shares Hammack, who co-wrote the track with Thomas Finch and Tofer Brown. \"This song felt fitting as the introduction to my second album coming later this year. Everybody loves a good old war cry for good love sometimes.\"\n\n\"All or Nothing\" is the lead single from the singer's upcoming as-yet-untitled sophomore record with Universal Music Group Nashville. -- Jeremy Chua\n\nHaving spent a few years soaking up traditional Irish music, Cinder Well (Amelia Baker) has returned to Southern California. Her particular brand of doom-folk hasn't lightened up, but it does refract the Pacific Coast's sunny rays.\n\nOn her new song \"Two Heads, Grey Mare,\" Cinder Well unfurls an atmospheric tale of truth and fiction.\n\n\"It's about a human spending a night with a selkie-like vision who comes out of the water,\" she explains. \"The selkie disappears in the morning, and the human is left with an experience that they can't put their finger on, questioning reality and experiencing a huge sense of loss.\"\n\nThe adventure is brooding and haunting, echoing with the waves of both the Pacific and the selkie's habitat of the Northern Atlantic. Her album Cadence will be out on April 21 via Free Dirt Records. -- Rachel Cholst\n\nJordan Davis has dropped another life lessons-driven song, \"Money Isn't Real.\" Written by Jameson Rodgers, Josh Thompson, Jake Mitchell and Sarah Turner, the honest track implores listeners to stop chasing dollar signs and focus on the things that truly matter in life — family, friends, and loved ones.\n\n\"Money isn't real / It can't call you like your mama does / It can't make you old friends / It can't make you young again / It can't buy you real love / It's just paper and some ink / It'll never ask you how you feel / A dollar doesn't make you rich when it comes to happiness / Money isn't real,\" Davis sings in the powerful chorus.\n\n\"Money Isn't Real\" is the latest preview of Davis' forthcoming LP, Bluebird Days, which drops on Feb. 17. -- Jeremy Chua\n\nTerry Blade is nothing if not prolific, churning out Americana and (under a separate name) pop music. The common element is a deep sense of disquiet, which is abundant in \"Won't Be Around.\"\n\nThe song revolves around a blues guitar lick that slowly builds in intensity, even as Blade cooly brushes off the person who has spurned him. The Chicago-based singer-songwriter is versatile, having just released his album Ethos: Son of a Sharecropper in January. -- Rachel Cholst\n\nUp-and-comer Bryan Martin has just unleashed a haunting and gritty new song, \"Wolves Cry.\" The soaring autobiographical track, which was written by Martin, proudly showcases his Louisiana roots and the rough-around-the-edges upbringing he had.\n\n\"'Wolves Cry' is purely about how I was raised,\" Martin says. \"It's a testament to appreciating your roots, even if you don't come from much. I want it to serve as a reminder to people to not let your past get in the way of what you really want in life.\"\n\n\"Wolves Cry\" is the latest preview of Martin's forthcoming collection, Poets & Old Souls, due out on March 31 via Average Joes Entertainment. -- Jeremy Chua\n\nJamie Stillway's latest album, Lullaby For a Stranger, came out this past winter but is no less immediate for it. The guitarist holed up in a cabin without internet on an island in the Puget Sound to create a deeply personal -- and difficult -- album. Stillway is the daughter and granddaughter of women who abandoned their children.\n\nOn Lullaby For a Stranger, Stillway's compositions seek to tell their stories and gain empathy for their decisions many years later. \"Wood and Windows\" exemplifies Stillway's approach to the album, with skillful guitar playing and evocative melodies filled out by distortions and echoes from the guitar itself. -- Rachel Cholst"
