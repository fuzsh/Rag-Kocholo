        "text": "AIMS Marketing Program/ Featured Titles Promoted This Week:\n\nThe Damned – Darkadelic CD/LP (earMUSIC)\n\n46 years after releasing the groundbreaking debut Damned Damned Damned, The Damned return with Darkadelic, their twelfth studio album and their first one since 2018’s Evil Spirits. The album catches the band that launched punk and invented goth once again innovating and expanding upon their unique universe. The lead single and video for “The Invisible Man” is a showcase for Captain Sensible’s riffadelic guitar work and David Vanian’s snarling baritone vocals. Darkadelic barrels along from there and features some of The Damned’s sharpest songwriting and genre-bending performances reaching peaks with “You’re Gonna Realise” and “Beware Of The Clowns” drenched in classic horror movie references, nods to swinging ‘60s London, and a refined palette of musical influences. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing with slipmat is available.]\n\nIndigo De Souza – All Of This Will End CD/LP+MP3 (Saddle Creek)\n\n“I was finally able to trust myself fully,” says Indigo de Souza of making her masterful third album All Of This Will End. Across eleven songs, the LP is a raw and radically optimistic work that grapples with mortality, the rejuvenation that community brings, and the importance of centering yourself now. These tracks come from the most resonant moments of her life: childhood memories, collecting herself in parking lots, the ecstatic trips spent wandering Appalachian Mountains and southern swamps with friends, and the times she had to stand up for herself. Like the hues of reds and oranges that her mother painted on the LP cover, All Of This Will End marks a warmer and unmistakably audacious era for her. It’s a statement about fearlessly moving forward from the past into a gratitude-filled present, feeling it all every step of the way, and choosing to embody loving awareness. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available. Cassette version due May 5.]\n\nCandy Dulfer – Live At Montreux 2002 CD+DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nCandy Dulfer has combined a highly successful solo career with guest spots for a host of musical greats including Van Morrison, Blondie, Aretha Franklin, Pink Floyd, Dave Stewart (with whom she scored the hit, “Lily Was Here”) and, perhaps most notably, Prince. She has played at Montreux on several occasions with her band, Funky Stuff. This set focuses on her concert from 2002 and features bonus tracks from 1998.\n\nDuke Ellington – Love You Madly + A Concert Of Sacred Music At Grace Cathedral DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nLove You Madly is a profile of Duke Ellington that features interviews and such timeless selections as “Rockin’ In Rhythm”, “In My Solitude”, “Things Ain’t What They Used To Be”, and more. The DVD also includes A Concert Of Sacred Music At Grace Cathedral, which includes unforgettable renditions of “In the Beginning, God”, “The Lord’s Prayer”, “Come Sunday”, and other songs of praise.\n\nRyan Hamilton – Haunted By The Holy Ghost CD/LP (Wicked Cool)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Texan indie-rocker Ryan Hamilton, formerly of the band Smile Smile, presents his third solo album Haunted By The Holy Ghost. Continuing the rough and ready power-pop/garage-rock chops of its predecessor 1221, Hamilton addresses his experiences growing up in an extremely conservative religious household. He recorded the album at The Old Cider Press, UK and Ryan’s Home Studio in Stephenville, TX. The album’s 10 tracks were written by Ryan Hamilton and produced by Dave Draper and features a guest appearance from Jessie Wagner.\n\nRickie Lee Jones – Pieces Of Treasure CD/LP (Modern Recordings/BMG)\n\nPieces Of Treasure, Rickie Lee Jones’ newest album, has been a long time coming. In a career that has spanned more than four decades, the renowned singer songwriter has interpreted an extraordinarily wide range of songs from writers and artists she loves, often collected on the same album – showtunes, blues, folk, rock (David Bowie publicly praised her take on “Rebel Rebel”). Pieces Of Treasure – the title a callback to Jones’ seminal album Pirates – is a reunion with legendary producer Russ Titelman, who had, with former Warner Bros. Records head Lenny Waronker, co-produced her star-making 1980 debut LP Rickie Lee Jones and the follow up, Pirates. Titelman had followed Jones’ career over the many years since they’d last collaborated, faithfully going to hear her play whenever she came through New York City. They recently started having phone conversations and then meeting up for lunch; each time Titleman would tell her the same thing: “We’re going to make a jazz record. We’re going to make a jazz record.”\n\nJoseph – The Sun CD/LP+MP3 (ATO)\n\nThe Sun is the fourth studio record from Joseph (sisters Natalie, Meegan and Allison Closner) and the follow-up to Good Luck, Kid (2019). It builds on its predecessor’s cinematic pop, bringing a thrilling new energy into each of the album’s ten elegantly sculpted tracks. Joseph worked with acclaimed producers Tucker Martine (My Morning Jacket, First Aid Kit) and Christian “Leggy” Langdon (Amos Lee, BANKS) to build an irresistibly vibrant sound ranging from moody grandeur to pure anthemic glory. [A limited-edition translucent orange vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nThe National – First Two Pages Of Frankenstein CD/LP+MP3 (4AD)\n\nAnchored by evocative melodies and an enthralling lyrical narrative, First Two Pages Of Frankenstein signals a new chapter in the band’s beloved discography. The album features guest appearances by Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers and Sufjan Stevens. First Two Pages Of Frankenstein channels the group’s revitalized chemistry into a body of work that beautifully balances elegant musicality with The National’s more idiosyncratic impulses. Tracks such as “Grease In Your Hair” and “Ice Machines” were road-tested in 2022 before they were recorded, allowing the band to hone the material in real time (another song, “Weird Goodbyes” featuring Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, was released as a standalone track in August 2022). “To me the power of this record has to do with the intentionality and structure of the music meeting with a lot of accidental magic,” says Aaron Dessner. [An indie store exclusive red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nArturo O’Farrill – Legacies CD (Blue Note)\n\nOn his Blue Note album Legacies, composer/arranger/bandleader Arturo O’Farrill puts the emphasis back on his striking pianistic abilities with a nine-song set that juxtaposes stunning solo piano flights. Dynamic trio performances are accompanied by his son, drummer Zack O’Farrill, and bassist Liany Mateo. The repertoire includes pieces by Bud Powell (“Un Poco Loco”), Thelonious Monk (“Well, You Needn’t”), his father Chico O’Farrill (“Pure Emotion”), his own “Blue State Blues”, and more.\n\nJoy Oladokun – Proof Of Life CD/2xLP (Republic)\n\nNigerian-American musician/songwriter/producer Joy Oladokun, one of music’s most unique and vulnerable voices, returns with her third full-length album, Proof Of Life. The album captures the human experience with a profound simplicity. Across thirteen tracks, Oladokun celebrates the little details and simple pleasures of being alive, while also giving voice to some of life’s most complex experiences in a way only she can. In addition to “Changes” – a reflection on Oladokun’s own growth as well as the changing world around her – the new record includes the previously released songs “Keeping The Light On” and the instant-classic duet, “Sweet Symphony” featuring Chris Stapleton, as well as collaborations with Manchester Orchestra, Mt. Joy, Maxo Kream, and Noah Kahan. [Indie store exclusive autographed CD and vinyl editions are available.]\n\nThe Orb – Prism CD/2xLP (Cooking Vinyl)\n\nThe Orb’s pulsating discography grows ever huger, with their 18th album, and third helmed by the core duo of Alex Paterson and Michael Rendall. Despite the connotations of its title, here they continue to rollick freely without inhibition across ambient, house and dub, but also tangent into poetry, pop, full-blown drum ‘n’ bass and reggae. The release features electronic musicians David Harrow (whose cv includes Anne Clarke, Psychic TV, Razormaid, Adrian Sherwood and Andy Weatherall) and Gaudi (whose credits include Max Romeo, Capleton, Johnny Clarke and Desmond Dekker). Other guests include Orb regular Youth, violinist Violeta Vicci, Kompakt records alumnus Leonardo Fresco, Metamono man Jono Podmore, guitarist and Alex’s old schoolchum David Lofts, plus vocalists Eric Von Skywalker, Andy Cain and Rachel D’arcy. [A limited-edition color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nJosh Ritter – Spectral Lines CD/LP (Pytheas Recordings)\n\nJosh Ritter has been thinking a lot about space exploration. It has nothing to do with his new album, Spectral Lines, except that in a way, it really does. “The Voyager spacecraft went up in ’77 and now it’s out there in a place that no one’s ever been before, and it’s sending back all these messages,” Ritter says. “I feel like songs do that in their own little way. They’re probes: they go out into the world, and sometimes you hear stories back from them, but really, they go off on their own.” Ritter, too, is sending back messages, in the form of twn new songs that are atmospheric and impressionistic. [An indie store exclusive orange cream color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSkinny Pelembe – Hardly The Same Snake CD/LP (Partisan)\n\nHardly The Same Snake is Skinny Pelembe’s sophomore album, but his first fully embracing his artistic self. Visceral yet inherently soulful, Hardly The Same Snake is the sound of the Johannesburg-born, Doncaster-raised artist finally finding his voice – both literally and figuratively. In practical terms, that involved finding the courage to foreground his gravelly baritone in these gloriously genre-agnostic productions. As Skinny puts it today, in his soft South Yorkshire drawl, “This album is what I would have created, first time round had I rated my own voice.” Determined that the album shouldn’t sound like a band record, but equally mustn’t feel “too button push-y”, Skinny assembled songs by sampling instrumentation originally recorded live, including chopped and looped versions of the brilliantly complex beats played by Malcolm Catto of The Heliocentrics. [A limited-edition translucent red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nStephen Stills – Stephen Stills Live At Berkeley 1971 CD/2xLP (Omnivore)\n\nIn 1971 Stephen Stills embarked on a US tour, opening each show with an intimate acoustic first set, and closing each night with a riveting electric set featuring the Memphis Horns. These historic, previously unreleased recordings took place over two nights at the Berkeley Community Theater, with David Crosby joining him on vocals and guitar for “You Don’t Have To Cry” and “The Lee Shore”. Stephen Stills Live At Berkeley 1971 finds Stills at peak performance in both vocal delivery and musicianship, effortlessly incorporating alternate instrumentation on his instantly recognizable tracks, including a seamless medley of “49 Bye Byes” and “For What It’s Worth” (unexpectedly played on piano). Timeless and era defining performances personally selected by Stills.\n\nAdditional Social Media Program Titles:\n\nChicano Batman – Chicano Batman [Reissue/2010] LP (ATO)\n\nBlue w/ white color vinyl pressing. Chicano Batman source their high-spirited alternative synthesis from Tropicália, West Coast psychedelia, and late-’60s/early-’70s soul. ATO Records presents a colored vinyl LP reissue with foil-board jacket of the Los Angeles psych-soul four-piece’s self-released self-titled 2010 debut featuring the fan favorite song “Itotiani.”\n\nFever Ray – Radical Romantics LP+MP3 (Mute)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl. Radical Romantics documents Fever Ray’s struggle with love, relationships, identity, and self-preservation. Featuring collaborations with Olof Dreijer (The Knife), Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, Vessel, Aasthma and more, this album feels like the apex of their career, incorporating elements of The Knife and early Fever Ray, while looking steadfastly into the future. Includes the single “What They Call Us” which Pitchfork awarded with Best New Track. [A limited-edition red colorway is available.]\n\nReneé Rapp – (Deluxe) CD (IMG)\n\nIndie store exclusive autographed CD. The actor-turned-pop darling expands on her evocative digital-only debut EP, Everything To Everyone.\n\nCDs + Vinyl:\n\nThe 69 Eyes – Death Of Darkness CD/LP (Atomic Fire)\n\nFinnish goth ‘n’ roll pioneers The 69 Eyes have been haunting stages all over the world for 33 years and seem to be a truly immortal part of the dark rock/metal scene. With Death Of Darkness they open a new hard rocking chapter of their career. [Two vinyl colorways are available: limited-edition blue and red.]\n\nBeegie Adair – I Love Being Here With You CD (Green Hill)\n\nBeegie Adair & Friends – Jazz For The Road CD (Green Hill)\n\nFrom listening to Peggy Lee on her mother’s phonograph to eventually accompanying her on The Johnny Cash Show, jazz pianist Beegie Adair has fond memories of the great songwriter and performer. I Love Being Here With You represents a carefully crafted portrait of Lee’s music career featuring notable songs like “Fever” and “Why Don’t You Do Right”. Perfect for cruising down the road with the windows down and the wind whipping through your hair, Jazz For The Road is a unique tribute to road trips, nostalgic travels and the spirit of Route 66.\n\nAli Baba – Laugh Like A Bomb CD/LP (Memphis Industries)\n\nLaugh Like A Bomb showcases anxious synths and scratchy guitars that collide with concrete drum hits, pulsing bass and Baba’s snarly vocals in 40-minute collection that explores feelings of unease, abandon and desire as well explorations into the more sinister. [An indie store exclusive pink color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nArch Enemy – Black Earth [Reissue/1996] CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nArch Enemy – Stigmata [Reissue/1998] CD/LP (Century Media)\n\nFormed by guitarist Michael Amott after his departure from the now legendary Carcass and years before the introduction of their amazing German female singer Angela Gossow, Arch Enemy first garnered praise with the metal milestone Black Earth in 1996. This first album of a band which would later become one of the biggest of its genre, featuring original singer Johan Liiva, was propelled by flawlessly technical dual guitars and a previously unheard mixture of melody and aggression – an alchemy that redefined the limits of melodic death metal. The band’s sophomore album, Stigmata, is full of old school banger riffs ala Slayer and Destruction format with an ease and joy of playing from the soul that the neck muscles almost begin to rotate by themselves and manage, incredibly, to insert between the chainsaw chord sequences again and again two-part melodic licks, which remind more than once of early Iron Maiden records and spherical death songs. [Limited edition gold and silver (respectively) vinyl colorways are available.]\n\nAustere – Corrosion Of Hearts CD/LP (Prophecy/Lupus Lounge)\n\nNew album from the Australian depressive black metal band. [A limited-edition gray w/ black color vinyl pressing and a hardback book CD version with bonus track are available.]\n\nChet Baker – Blue Room: The 1979 VARA Studio Sessions In Holland 2xCD (Elemental Music)\n\nBlue Room: The 1979 VARA Studio Sessions In Holland features two recordings of Chet Baker at the VARA Studio 2 in Hilversum, the Netherlands for the KRO Radio program Nine O’Clock Jazz. The April 10th session features Phil Markowitz (piano), Jean-Louis Rassinfosse (bass) and Charles Rice (drums). The November 9th session features Frans Elsen (piano), Victor Kaihatu (bass) and Eric Ineke (drums).\n\nBraids – Euphoric Recall CD/LP+MP3 (Secret City)\n\nFor their fifth full-length, Euphoric Recall, Braids intuitively pursued the playful joy and spontaneity they’d been craving in the absence of live performances – the “kinetic and exciting” (The New York Times) energy that’s become their superpower. Self-produced and for the first time composing and arranging string parts, the band welcomed the guiding flourishes of an ensemble on cello, viola, and violins. The sound is lush and sprawling yet captured with in-the-room clarity; it grooves viscerally, freer, and wholly anew.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs – Nothing Here Now But The Recordings CD/LP (Dais)\n\nIn 1980, Genesis P-Orridge and Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson of (then-)Throbbing Gristle travelled to New York City to meet up at the fortified apartment, known as The Bunker, of famed beat writer and cultural pioneer William S. Burroughs and his executor James Grauerholz. Genesis and Sleazy started the daunting task of compiling the experimental sound works of Burroughs, which, up until that point, had never been widely heard. Inspired by the original Industrial Records release of William S. Burroughs’s Nothing Here Now But The Recordings, Belgian record label Sub Rosa worked with Burroughs to release another album: Break Through In Grey Room. Originally compiled in 1986 by producer Bill Rich, the album features Burroughs’s experimental recordings from 1961 to 1976, featuring field recordings by Burroughs of the Master Musicians of Jajouka, experimental collaborations with mathematician Ian Sommerville and painter/cut-up originator Brion Gysin. [Limited-edition clear vinyl pressings are available.]\n\nJonathan Butler – Ubuntu CD (Artistry Music)\n\nLegendary singer-songwriter Jonathan Butler traveled back to his home country of South Africa to craft his most exciting and deeply personal album to date. Featuring producer/bassist Marcus Miller, Ubuntu is a reintroduction of Butler’s life story, going back 60 years to his upbringing in apartheid-era Capetown, which shaped his world view, prompted years of advocacy, and instilled the ideology of ‘Oneness’ (Ubuntu). Featuring special guests Keb’ Mo’ and Stevie Wonder, the album serves both as a rebirth of musical creativity and reconciliation with systemically biased history to forge a brighter future.\n\nMya Byne – Rhinestone Tomboy CD/LP (Kill Rockets Stars)\n\nPlaying Americana steeped with potent branches of blues, rock, glam and country music, Mya Byrne is every bit the voice of the outsider that built the foundation of the genre, where we behold stages beaming with the light of those who are so willing to stand tall and confident in the entirety of their truth. Here Byrne stands too. Americana has many champions, but there are scarce few like Byrne; a queer trans woman creating ripples that will find themselves born again and again as waves. On Rhinestone Tomboy, we are treated to a portrait painted with shades of Byrne’s youth, one spent listening to stacks of her mama’s dusty 45s, and thrift store 8-tracks blasting from blown speakers out the window of an old Chevy. Songs that opened the trailhead to a lifelong journey that informed Byrne’s musical landscape.\n\nPaul B. Carter – Les Fleurs CD/2xLP (In The Red)\n\nA vital participant in the Los Angeles music scene of that period as bandleader, songwriter, musician and producer, Paul B. Cutler’s work-in particular his guitar playing-with The Consumers, 45 Grave, Vox Pop and The Dream Syndicate is still admired by fans and an influence on anyone interested in that period and the styles that developed from it. Enthused about his new material, Cutler continued recorded songs with just his signature electric guitar style and vocals. As this was developing, another vet of the early L.A. scene – Brad Laner of Medicine and Savage Republic – got in touch with Cutler. Soon Laner was mixing, co-producing, playing keyboards as well as adding the rhythm section.\n\nCountry Westerns – Forgive The City CD CD/LP (Fat Possum)\n\nNashville rockers Country Westerns return with their sophomore album, Forgive The City. Marking the band’s second full-length release for Fat Possum, this barn-burning collection is also their second to be helmed by famed producer Matt Sweeney (who even contributes his lead guitar stylings to a few tracks). The album is heralded by the sinewy, melodic new track “It’s A Livin’,” which is out now via all DSPs and is once again accompanied by an official music video directed by Miranda Zipse (Miranda and the Beat). [A limited-edition coke bottle green colorway is available.]\n\nCradle Of Filth – Trouble And Their Double Lives 2xCD/2xLP (Napalm)\n\n2023 live release from the extreme metal legends. Recorded between 2014 and 2019 at different performances in the US, Europe, Australia and beyond during their Cryptoriana World Tour and dates following, the album serves as a time-capsule of blisteringly intense live energy.\n\nCrown The Empire – Dogma CD/LP (Rise)\n\nDogma, produced and mixed by Zach Jones (Fever333, Poor Stacy, Scene Queen, NovaTwins), is their most diverse album fueled by angst, existential identity, isolation, and determination and includes features from Courtney LaPlante (Spiritbox) and Remington Leith (Palaye Royale).\n\nLee-Ann Curren – Who Knows? CD/LP (Archipel)\n\nRecently released on vinyl – now available on CD. Produced by Pierre Loustaunau aka “Petit Fantôme”, the Franco-American artist Lee-Ann Curren comes back with a sensual and colorful mini-album, navigating between shoegaze, country, pop and futuristic R&B. Parallel stories, soft melancholy, where analog roughness meets digital sharpness. Each track illustrates Lee-Ann’s own duality, always looking for the right balance between her Californian and Basque roots, a pro surfer and a musician life.\n\nThe Damned – Darkadelic CD/LP (earMUSIC)\n\n46 years after releasing the groundbreaking debut Damned Damned Damned, The Damned return with Darkadelic, their twelfth studio album and their first one since 2018’s Evil Spirits. The album catches the band that launched punk and invented goth once again innovating and expanding upon their unique universe. The lead single and video for “The Invisible Man” is a showcase for Captain Sensible’s riffadelic guitar work and David Vanian’s snarling baritone vocals. Darkadelic barrels along from there and features some of The Damned’s sharpest songwriting and genre-bending performances reaching peaks with “You’re Gonna Realise” and “Beware Of The Clowns” drenched in classic horror movie references, nods to swinging ‘60s London, and a refined palette of musical influences. [A limited-edition clear vinyl pressing with slipmat is available.]\n\nDanava – Nothing But Nothing CD/LP (Tee Pee)\n\nRising from the depths of hell with fury and rage, Danava return new album Nothing But Nothing, a devastating soundtrack for the inevitable decline of western civilization. Formed in 2003, Danava has delivered a sound that incorporates hard rock, heavy metal and a fire forged in the spirit of Iommi and Schenker. Their scorched earth approach has blazed brightly over psychedelic metal solos, glam-rock flair, fretboard wizardry and a white line fever reminiscent of Lemmy at his most lethal.\n\nThe Defiled – The Highest Level CD/LP (Season Of Mist)\n\nWhen it comes to straight-forward, bone-crushing death metal, Tokyo’s Defiled delivers.\n\nIndigo De Souza – All Of This Will End CD/LP+MP3 (Saddle Creek)\n\n“I was finally able to trust myself fully,” says Indigo de Souza of making her masterful third album All Of This Will End. Across eleven songs, the LP is a raw and radically optimistic work that grapples with mortality, the rejuvenation that community brings, and the importance of centering yourself now. These tracks come from the most resonant moments of her life: childhood memories, collecting herself in parking lots, the ecstatic trips spent wandering Appalachian Mountains and southern swamps with friends, and the times she had to stand up for herself. Like the hues of reds and oranges that her mother painted on the LP cover, All Of This Will End marks a warmer and unmistakably audacious era for her. It’s a statement about fearlessly moving forward from the past into a gratitude-filled present, feeling it all every step of the way, and choosing to embody loving awareness. [A limited-edition red color vinyl pressing is available. Cassette version due May 5.]\n\nDragon Inn 3 – Trade Secrets CD/LP (American Laudromat)\n\nThe long-anticipated sophomore release from Dragon Inn 3.

[An opaque red vinyl color pressing is available.]\n\nCandy Dulfer – Live At Montreux 2002 CD+DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nCandy Dulfer has combined a highly successful solo career with guest spots for a host of musical greats including Van Morrison, Blondie, Aretha Franklin, Pink Floyd, Dave Stewart (with whom she scored the hit, “Lily Was Here”) and, perhaps most notably, Prince.

On their second long player, Fires In The Distance further expand on their musical foundations of wistful melodicism, crushingly heavy guitar work and intricate atmospherics. Across Air Not Meant For Us’ six tracks, Fires In The Distance tie together intensely personal ruminations on mental health and themes of existentialism in the form of mortality salience, without losing sight of the importance of perseverance. [A limited-edition smoke color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nFugitive – Maniac CDEP/12” (20 Buck Spin)\n\nBlake Ibanez of Power Trip returns with a new band, Fugitive, and the Maniac EP, four original tracks of the aggressive pit detonation thrash he’s known for in Power Trip, with an even rawer and looser ferocity.

[A limited-edition clear w/ red & black splatter color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nNeil Gaiman & FourPlay String Quartet – Signs Of Life CD/LP (Instrumental Records)\n\nSince selling out the Concert Hall at the Sydney Opera House in 2010, Neil Gaiman and FourPlay String Quartet have been firm friends and collaborators.

Part songwriting, part poetry, part storytelling; all-encompassing, all-engaging, all beautiful. [A silver color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nGreat Lake Swimmers – Uncertain Country CD (Fontana North)\n\nDoubt, followed by discovery. Demos that ended up as finished tracks.

The album’s 10 tracks were written by Ryan Hamilton and produced by Dave Draper and features a guest appearance from Jessie Wagner.\n\nDave Hause – Drive Like It’s Stolen CD/LP (Dave Hause)\n\nDrive It Like It’s Stolen is Dave’s sixth solo LP, following 2021’s Blood Harmony, and he describes the album’s style as “post-apocalyptic Americana.” Drive It Like It’s Stolen was produced by Will Hoge and is inspired in part by Dave’s experience as a father. [A limited-edition blue color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nTim Hecker – No Highs CD/2xLP (Kranky)\n\nThe latest by Canadian composer Tim Hecker serves as a beacon of unease against the deluge of false positive corporate ambient currently in vogue. Whether taken as warning or promise, No Highs delivers-this is music of austerity and ambiguity, purgatorial and seasick. A jagged anti-relaxant for our medicated age, rough-hewn and undefined. Morse code pulse programming flickers like distress signals while a gathering storm of strings, noise, and low-end looms in the distance. Processed electronics shiver and shudder against pitch-shifting assemblages of crackling voltage, mantric horns (including exquisite modal sax by Colin Stetson), and cathedral keys. Throughout, the pieces both accrue and avoid drama, more attuned to undertow than crescendo.\n\nIllenium – Illenium CD/2xLP (WB)\n\nAs one of the most successful crossover electronic artists today, Grammy Award nominated producer/DJ and instrumentalist Illenium (born Nick Miller) elevates dance music via his bold, progressive take on the genre. His is an expansive sound, which mixes elements of celestial electronic, mellow alternative, crushing dubstep, emotional indie, and pop-tinged bass music. [A limited-edition translucent orange color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKeith Jarrett – Book Of Ways [Reissue/1987] CD (ECM)\n\nKeith Jarrett’s album, Book Of Ways, was recorded on July 14, 1986 in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Rather amazing is the great variety of sound and rhythm – Jarrett alternately played one or two instruments simultaneously. Beyond unmistakable echoes of lute music and Japanese Koto, the whole range of modes of expression the clavichord is capable of is being fathomed out. All this has been supported by studio techniques, which recorded the sound of the instrument with rarely heard intensity.\n\nRickie Lee Jones – Pieces Of Treasure CD/LP (Modern Recordings/BMG)\n\nPieces Of Treasure, Rickie Lee Jones’ newest album, has been a long time coming. In a career that has spanned more than four decades, the renowned singer songwriter has interpreted an extraordinarily wide range of songs from writers and artists she loves, often collected on the same album – showtunes, blues, folk, rock (David Bowie publicly praised her take on “Rebel Rebel”). Pieces Of Treasure – the title a callback to Jones’ seminal album Pirates – is a reunion with legendary producer Russ Titelman, who had, with former Warner Bros. Records head Lenny Waronker, co-produced her star-making 1980 debut LP Rickie Lee Jones and the follow up, Pirates. Titelman had followed Jones’ career over the many years since they’d last collaborated, faithfully going to hear her play whenever she came through New York City. They recently started having phone conversations and then meeting up for lunch; each time Titleman would tell her the same thing: “We’re going to make a jazz record. We’re going to make a jazz record.”\n\nJoseph – The Sun CD/LP+MP3 (ATO)\n\nThe Sun is the fourth studio record from Joseph (sisters Natalie, Meegan and Allison Closner) and the follow-up to Good Luck, Kid (2019). It builds on its predecessor’s cinematic pop, bringing a thrilling new energy into each of the album’s ten elegantly sculpted tracks. Joseph worked with acclaimed producers Tucker Martine (My Morning Jacket, First Aid Kit) and Christian “Leggy” Langdon (Amos Lee, BANKS) to build an irresistibly vibrant sound ranging from moody grandeur to pure anthemic glory. [A limited-edition translucent orange vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nKero Kero Bonito – Intro Bonito CD/LP+MP3/Cassette (Polyvinyl)\n\nOriginally released in 2013, Kero Kero Bonito’s debut mixtape, Intro Bonito, was a monumental success in the underground hyperpop scene bubbling up throughout the band’s hometown of South London. The trio, featuring Gus Lobban, Jamie Bulled, and Sarah Midori Perry, started crafting their unique blend of electronic pop music after school friends Gus & Jamie met Sarah on the internet. [A limited-edition hot pink vinyl colorway is available.]\n\nKid Congo – Live In St. Kilda CD/LP (In The Red)\n\nLive In St. Kilda is a twelve-song live album from a one-time-only show in which Kid Congo Powers was backed by The Near Death Experience. “Enjoy the racket, enjoy the love, enjoy this record of friendship and celebration.”\n\nLunar Chamber – Shambhallic Vibrations CD/LP (20 Buck Spin)\n\nLunar Chamber, a hitherto unknown being of mysterious consciousness, now present in the physical realm for the first time with debut manifestation Shambhallic Vibrations, a tale of a journey eastward in search of enlightenment and what may lie beyond. Ensconced in mysticism, the five track nearly thirty-minute pilgrimage advances unflinchingly through insane crushing riffs, bewildering solos, tranquil acoustics and illuminated ascendent melodies. [A limited-edition color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nMagnetic Ghost Orchestra – Magnetic Ghost Orchestra CD (Fun In The Church)\n\nIn addition to jazz (in general), 17-piece ensemble Magnetic Ghost Orchestra are also influenced by the of indie pop bands like The Notwist or the big, sample-based Bristol pop of the ‘90s all the way to the noisy, electrifying improv jazz of Berlin’s present: “The traditional sound of a big band gives the music a certain vintage character because it rubs up against contemporary elements.” [Vinyl due May 12.]\n\nMajesty – Back To Attack CD/LP (Reaper)\n\nCatchy, big heavy metal anthems that catch you the first time you hear them and let you put your fist in the air paired with lyrics about the eternal fight for freedom and your way to live.\n\nMatt Maltese – Driving Just To Drive CD/LP (Nettwerk)\n\nDriving Just To Drive is the fourth album from London crooner Matt Maltese, the follow up to his critically acclaimed LP Good Morning It’s Now Tomorrow in 2021. “I thought a lot back to being younger and how much more I used to do things just to do them. Playing on a playground as a kid or just going for a drive and listening to music in the car. I used to love stuff with no sense of an outcome, with no sense of self-imposed necessity. I think it’s important to have some of that in our lives.”\n\nKip Moore – Damn Love CD/2xLP (MCA Nashville)\n\nKip Moore’s fifth studio album features 13 tracks including the single “Kinda Bar”. Kip’s previous albums include Up All Night, Wild Ones, Slowheart, and Wild World. Moore has charted 12 singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts.

The album features guest appearances by Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers and Sufjan Stevens. First Two Pages Of Frankenstein channels the group’s revitalized chemistry into a body of work that beautifully balances elegant musicality with The National’s more idiosyncratic impulses. Tracks such as “Grease In Your Hair” and “Ice Machines” were road-tested in 2022 before they were recorded, allowing the band to hone the material in real time (another song, “Weird Goodbyes” featuring Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon, was released as a standalone track in August 2022). “To me the power of this record has to do with the intentionality and structure of the music meeting with a lot of accidental magic,” says Aaron Dessner. [An indie store exclusive red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nArturo O’Farrill – Legacies CD (Blue Note)\n\nOn his Blue Note album Legacies, composer/arranger/bandleader Arturo O’Farrill puts the emphasis back on his striking pianistic abilities with a nine-song set that juxtaposes stunning solo piano flights. Dynamic trio performances are accompanied by his son, drummer Zack O’Farrill, and bassist Liany Mateo. The repertoire includes pieces by Bud Powell (“Un Poco Loco”), Thelonious Monk (“Well, You Needn’t”), his father Chico O’Farrill (“Pure Emotion”), his own “Blue State Blues”, and more.\n\nJoy Oladokun – Proof Of Life CD/2xLP (Republic)\n\nNigerian-American musician/songwriter/producer Joy Oladokun, one of music’s most unique and vulnerable voices, returns with her third full-length album, Proof Of Life. The album captures the human experience with a profound simplicity. Across thirteen tracks, Oladokun celebrates the little details and simple pleasures of being alive, while also giving voice to some of life’s most complex experiences in a way only she can. In addition to “Changes” – a reflection on Oladokun’s own growth as well as the changing world around her – the new record includes the previously released songs “Keeping The Light On” and the instant-classic duet, “Sweet Symphony” featuring Chris Stapleton, as well as collaborations with Manchester Orchestra, Mt. Joy, Maxo Kream, and Noah Kahan. [Indie store exclusive autographed CD and vinyl editions are available.]\n\nThe Orb – Prism CD/2xLP (Cooking Vinyl)\n\nThe Orb’s pulsating discography grows ever huger, with their 18th album, and third helmed by the core duo of Alex Paterson and Michael Rendall. Despite the connotations of its title, here they continue to rollick freely without inhibition across ambient, house and dub, but also tangent into poetry, pop, full-blown drum ‘n’ bass and reggae. The release features electronic musicians David Harrow (whose cv includes Anne Clarke, Psychic TV, Razormaid, Adrian Sherwood and Andy Weatherall) and Gaudi (whose credits include Max Romeo, Capleton, Johnny Clarke and Desmond Dekker). Other guests include Orb regular Youth, violinist Violeta Vicci, Kompakt records alumnus Leonardo Fresco, Metamono man Jono Podmore, guitarist and Alex’s old school chum David Lofts, plus vocalists Eric Von Skywalker, Andy Cain and Rachel D’arcy.

Orloge Simard are ready to spread the art of fighting, the only visceral and necessary form of art.

Each song is a representation of different seasons in Bebe’s life and letting go of perfection.\n\nJosh Ritter – Spectral Lines CD/LP (Pytheas Recordings)\n\nJosh Ritter has been thinking a lot about space exploration. It has nothing to do with his new album, Spectral Lines, except that in a way, it really does. “The Voyager spacecraft went up in ’77 and now it’s out there in a place that no one’s ever been before, and it’s sending back all these messages,” Ritter says. “I feel like songs do that in their own little way. They’re probes: they go out into the world, and sometimes you hear stories back from them, but really, they go off on their own.” Ritter, too, is sending back messages, in the form of twn new songs that are atmospheric and impressionistic. [An indie store exclusive orange cream color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nSmokey Robinson – Gasms CD (TLR Music Group)\n\nNew release from the soul/R&B legend. Acclaimed singer-songwriter Smokey Robinson’s career spans over four decades of hits.

Throughout his 60-year music career, Robinson has accumulated more than 4,000 songs to his credit and continues to thrill sold-out audiences worldwide with his high tenor voice, impeccable timing, and profound sense of lyrics and style.\n\nSeventeenth – SEVENTEEN 10th Mini Album ‘FML’ [CARAT Version] CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nSeventeenth – SEVENTEEN 10th Mini Album ‘FML’ [Fallen Misfit Lost] CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nSeventeenth – SEVENTEEN 10th Mini Album ‘FML’ [Faded Mono Life] CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\nSeventeenth – SEVENTEEN 10th Mini Album ‘FML’ [Fight For My Life] CD (Pledis Entertainment)\n\n10th mini album from the K-pop group available in four collectable versions: CARAT, A, B, and C, respectively.

Visceral yet inherently soulful, Hardly The Same Snake is the sound of the Johannesburg-born, Doncaster-raised artist finally finding his voice – both literally and figuratively. In practical terms, that involved finding the courage to foreground his gravelly baritone in these gloriously genre-agnostic productions. As Skinny puts it today, in his soft South Yorkshire drawl, “This album is what I would have created, first time round had I rated my own voice.” Determined that the album shouldn’t sound like a band record, but equally mustn’t feel “too button push-y”, Skinny assembled songs by sampling instrumentation originally recorded live, including chopped and looped versions of the brilliantly complex beats played by Malcolm Catto of The Heliocentrics. [A limited-edition translucent red color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nNate Smith – Nate Smith CD (SME Nashiville)\n\nLike Nate, his eponymous 20-song collection is honest, raw, real, and threaded together with optimism. He fearlessly takes on vulnerability – a characteristic evident not only in his lyrics, but also in his fragile yet robust delivery. While each song tells its own story, Nate unveils two sides of his artistry through the project: deep, heartfelt ballads and fun-loving, drink in the air, country jams. The two are intertwined with undeniable hooks and his signature velvet thunder vocals.\n\nShakin’ Stevens – Re-Set CD/LP (BMG)\n\nNew release from the veteran Welsh rocker. Shakin’ Stevens, one of the most enduring figureheads in rock and pop history, makes a triumphant return with the release of Re-Set. Its ten songs combine deeply heartfelt, meaningful lyrics with the most impassioned vocal performances he has ever summoned from himself, well over 50 years since his first recordings. The seeds for the album were planted before lockdown, and on the very day that restrictions were lifted, in the spring of 2021, Stevens and his fellow songwriters reconvened at co-producer and longtime collaborator John David’s Berry Hill Studio. Re-Set is the result.\n\nSissoko Ségal Parisien Peirani – Les Égarés CD/LP (No Format)\n\nNew quartet Sissoko Segal Parisien Peirani presents Les Égarés (The wandering), an album recorded by two virtuoso duos (Sissoko-Segal and Peirani-Parisien), who for years have excelled in the art of cross-fertilizing sounds and transcending genres. Les Egarés is more than a record. It’s play space, a locus of musical life, a poetic asylum inhabited by two duos: Ballaké Sissoko (kora) and Vincent Segal (cello) on the one hand and Vincent Peirani (accordion) and Émile Parisien (sax) on the other.\n\nStephen Stills – Stephen Stills Live At Berkeley 1971 CD/2xLP (Omnivore)\n\nIn 1971 Stephen Stills embarked on a US tour, opening each show with an intimate acoustic first set, and closing each night with a riveting electric set featuring the Memphis Horns. These historic, previously unreleased recordings took place over two nights at the Berkeley Community Theater, with David Crosby joining him on vocals and guitar for “You Don’t Have To Cry” and “The Lee Shore”. Stephen Stills Live At Berkeley 1971 finds Stills at peak performance in both vocal delivery and musicianship, effortlessly incorporating alternate instrumentation on his instantly recognizable tracks, including a seamless medley of “49 Bye Byes” and “For What It’s Worth” (unexpectedly played on piano). Timeless and era defining performances personally selected by Stills.\n\nSonny Stitt – Boppin’ In Baltimore: Live At The Left Bank 2xCD (Elemental Music)\n\nBoppin’ In Baltimore: Live At The Left Bank is a previously unreleased recording of saxophone master Sonny Stitt captured live at the famous ballroom in Baltimore on November 11, 1973.

Beloved duo Angus & Julia Stone have released their comeback, revealing their first album in almost four years will be a soundtrack to the upcoming video game, Life Is Strange: True Colors.\n\nSun Ra & His Solar-Myth Arkestra – The Solar-Myth Approach 2xCD (Charly)\n\nSun Ra & His Solar-Myth Arkestra – The Solar-Myth Approach Vol. 1 LP (Charly)\n\nSun Ra & His Solar-Myth Arkestra – The Solar-Myth Approach Vol. 2 LP (Charly)\n\nThis release showcases both the prolific output and unparalleled creative verve of Sun Ra, the man who created his own genre. Upgrading his celebrated band The Arkestra to the rank of Solar Myth Arkestra, the bandleader-composer-pianist-keyboardist produced enough music in his lifetime to fill a universe, and these sessions, though their precise date and place of recording remain unknown, are among the finest he released in the ’70, which was an action-packed decade for him. [The vinyl edition is spread across two separate volumes.]\n\nTaj Mahal – Savoy CD/LP (Stony Plain)\n\nTaj Mahal can rightfully be called a living legend for his contributions to popular music. With a voice as instantly recognizable as Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles, or Dr John, Taj Mahal has throughout his career pushed the envelope of American music forward by incorporating sounds from the Caribbean, Africa, traditional blues, and jazz. With Savoy, Taj takes a new direction in his musical journey, exploring classics from the American songbook with his good friend and acclaimed record producer John Simon, whose resume includes producing classic albums by The Band, Janis Joplin, Leonard Cohen, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Simon & Garfunkel, Gordon Lightfoot, Mama Cass Elliot, David Sanborn, and Michael Franks.\n\nTau 5 – Kreise [Reissue/2020] CD/2xLP (Fun In The Church)\n\nTau 5 is a quintet based in Berlin, consisting of five dazzling personalities of the young European jazz scene: Moritz Baumgärtner on drums and percussion, Philipp Gropper on saxophone, Philip Zoubek on electronics, Petter Eldh on bass – and last but not least – Ludwig Wandinger as the producer and editor.\n\nTiny Ruins – Ceremony CD/LP (Ba Da Bing!)\n\nTiny Ruins, the project of New Zealand musician Hollie Fullbrook, are back with their fourth album, Ceremony. The follow-up to 2019’s celebrated Olympic Girls, Ceremony goes deep into all the old and murky mysteries of what it means to be human-and sometimes it nearly goes under. Yet these songs also show how one can find the strength to swim from the shipwreck, push through the silt, surface into another new morning-another new chance.\n\nYves Tumor – Praise A Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume (Or Simply Hot Between Worlds) CD/LP+MP3/LP+MP3/LP+7”+MP3/Cassette (Warp)\n\nYves Tumor reveals a complex intimacy with each album: offering glimpses in familiarizing with Sean Lee Bowie, while simultaneously elevating the beautiful myths and fantasies that embolden our connections to art and music. Praise A Lord… offers the widest narrative shot yet, opening with a literal breath and a naked voice that’s spoken to you from a dark nightmarish depth and ending in an almost spiritual church-like celebration; uniquely different songs struck cohesively as album that begs to be reopened and re-experienced. The listener is empowered in that spectrum between moody darkness and bright excitement with songs that carry a wild variety of exalting emotion from highs to lows, making for a radical artistic statement redefining pop experience in that authentic engagement. Yves Tumor’s sound is clear and unmistaken yet unpredictable, with an identity that is universally charismatic through an androgynous presentation that is sexual, poetic, and honest: an overall presence that will never need to conform because it is continuously shifting and redefining what the pop world begins to emulate. [A limited-edition yellow color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nVarious Artists – Reference Sound Edition: Great Ballads CD/2xLP (in-akustik)\n\nWelcome to the world of impeccable sound, the in-akustik Reference Sound Edition.

After the debut album Earthwrecker, the second album Future Primitives now portrays the return of man to his roots, a life in new simplicity. For fans of Wolves In The Throne Room, Alda, Fall of Efrafa. [A limited-edition white color vinyl pressing is available.]\n\nWolfmanhattan Project – Summer Forever And Ever CD/LP (In The Red)\n\nWolfmanhattan Project is a collective unit co-starring three musicians familiar to In The Red listeners: singer-guitarist Mick Collins, front man of the seminal Detroit-bred garage units The Dirtbombs and the Gories, singer-guitarist Kid Congo Powers who played in such legendary bands as the Gun Club, The Cramps, and Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and drummer-vocalist Bob Bert, whose skin work has distinguished albums by Sonic Youth, Pussy Galore, Lydia Lunch’s Retrovirus, and Jon Spencer and the HITmakers.\n\nYouthstar & Miscellaneous – Salvation CD/LP (Chine Man)\n\nThe third artistic collaboration for Youthstar & Miscellaneous, Salvation is a 13 tracks journey with strong and optimistic subjects such as motivation, the quest for happiness, mixed with more melancholic themes such as addictions or dependency but always through incredible percussive flows and chorus with heady gimmicks that make you want to headbang. Faithful to the rap/hip-hop that forged the duo, the album also borrows the codes of electro, trap, bass music, and reggae.\n\nDVDs + Blu-ray:\n\nDuke Ellington – Love You Madly + A Concert Of Sacred Music At Grace Cathedral DVD (Mercury Studios)\n\nLove You Madly is a profile of Duke Ellington that features interviews and such timeless selections as “Rockin’ In Rhythm”, “In My Solitude”, “Things Ain’t What They Used To Be”, and more.

As Aesop explains, “Garbology is defined as the study of the material discarded by a society to learn what it reveals about social or cultural patterns. I find a lot of parallels between that and the idea of picking up the pieces after a loss or period of intense unrest and seeing what’s really there. Furthermore – the idea of digging through old, often neglected music from another time – with an ear tuned to taking in that data in a different way than your average listener – is exactly what Blockhead does.” Following the success of the full Garbology album, it’s only right to offer the instrumentals for further examination and repurposing efforts.\n\nà;GRUMH… – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nà;GRUMH… is a Belgian EBM group, born in Charleroi in 1981, and founded by S@3 Evets (aka Steve Natrix) and J@3 Seuqcaj.

A film school dropout whose work hat-tips tradition as much as outsider anti-aesthetics. He’s spent over a decade on the DIY circuit, playing early house shows alongside then up-and-coming peers Weyes Blood and Daniel Bachman. Today he is still out there projecting his sketchy hand-drawn animations during his performances in coffee shops, small galleries, and non-traditional venues. Andrews’ painterly approach now introduces the listener to his version of New York City, the place he was bound to end up after years of dwelling in Pennsylvania farm towns and New Hampshire barns. There is handmade vibrancy to the world he’s imagined here: intimate moments seen from the interior, looking outward from hole-in-the-wall restaurants, theaters and the fragments of peace found within the restless and dirty street corners.\n\nAthlete – Vehicles & Animals [Reissue/2003] 2xLP (Chrysalis)\n\n20th Anniversary deluxe vinyl edition of the debut album from UK based rock band Athlete. Hailing from south London, the band achieved chart success with the singles “You Got The Style” and “Beautiful” with the album going on to platinum success as well as being nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2003. An eclectic mix of quirky electronica and unashamed pop, it is guilelessly cheery and knowingly witty in equal measure. It is rife with an irresistible charm, sly English wit, and supremely catchy choruses. [CD version due May 5.]\n\nBasie All Stars – Live At Fabrik Hamburg 1981 LP (Jazzline)\n\nDuring Basie’s lifetime, some of his most loyal followers formed the All Stars. The alto-saxophonist Marshall Royal, Basie’s eternal concertmaster, took the lead in this. (Marshall probably played the same role for Basie as Johnny Hodges did for Duke Ellington. He passed away in 1995). The musicians performing that evening had for many years, some (like Royal) even for decades, co-fathered and influenced the Basie effect, so important for the history of big bands in swing.\n\nBedroom – Thread LP (Danger Collective)\n\nThread, Noah Kittinger’s fourth LP under the Bedroom moniker, is the album the singer-songwriter and producer has strived to release throughout his career. It’s a stunning portrait of self-exploration, as Kittinger aims to find his place in life after a tumultuous period both in his personal life and artistry.\n\nBegayer – Sauce Chien et lat Guitare au Poireau LP (Le Saule)\n\nA beautiful and strange program: to go and meet those who play music off road, in completely contemporary ceremonies somewhere between the secret village festival, the invitation to trance in the forest and spontaneous feasts in the heart of cities. Barking Gnawa Berber rock, dislocated jazz, collages of parasitic broadcasts: a beautiful mess in the folklore of the world zone.\n\nBlessing Offor – My Tribe 2xLP (Bowyer & Bow)\n\nBlessing Offor brings together soul, pop, R&B, and African styles in service of a universal sound-which he fittingly dubs “the genre of humanity.” He speaks to relatable experiences of struggle, triumph, life, and love from an inimitable perspective as a Nigerian-born and Nashville-based singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist. Now, this international upbringing, unbelievable journey, quiet grind, and confluence of styles define his debut full-length album, My Tribe.\n\nTommy Bolin Band – Live 9/19/76 LP (Friday Music)\n\nOne rare night in Albany, New York, iconic guitar hero Tommy Bolin proved that he was a natural performer and a virtuosic guitarist of the classic rock era.

Australian psych-rock legends The Church emerge with their first new studio album in six years. The band’s 26th album gleams with potential hits every bit as chiming and charming as their definitive early work.

Drawing from film and television music of the ’80s/’90s and armed with a mighty array of vintage analog and digital synthesizers, they set out to explore heists, vices, and catastrophe. Panoramic Coloursound collapses sound and image into a neon blur throughout its 25 tracks.\n\nCharles Curtis / Alan Licht / Dean Roberts – May 99 LP (Blank Forms Edition)\n\nIn the spring of 1999, Charles Curtis, Alan Licht, and Dean Roberts brought an unconventional mix of drone, improvisation, and experimental rock on an eleven-stop tour of Europe. The concept was straightforward, yet novel: each night, they would improvise a single piece while sustained sine waves played for the duration of the concert. May 99, culled from three shorter pieces recorded for a radio program at Amsterdam’s VPRO near the end of the tour, represents an early high watermark in the collision of minimal and rock sensibilities that started to become prevalent in the late ‘90s and is an ear-opening listen even for those familiar with the musicians’ other projects. May 99 combines resonant sine waves in the style of eminent downtown New York composer La Monte Young’s Theater of Eternal Music with scratchings, scrapings, and warblings produced by Licht and Roberts’s guitars, Curtis’s cello, and a variety of electronics.\n\nBen Copperhead – Wailing Viridescence LP (Shimmy Disc)\n\nA key inspiration for Ben Copperhead’s new album, Wailing Viridescence, can be traced back to his appreciation of old recordings using analog reel to reel tape. Years ago, while on tour in the UK, Copperhead found a book called Tape Music Composition.

Utilizing a restored four-track machine, he relished the challenge imposed upon himself by the constraints and parameters of the medium. The results yielded what he believes to be his strongest album to date.\n\nRudy de Anda – Closet Botanist LP (Colemine/Karma Chief)\n\nCloset Botanist was recorded directly to tape to channel a classic rock ‘n’ roll sound. Rudy points to The Velvet Underground and The Kinks for direct inspiration. “I glorify those bands – I’m a ‘60s psych-rocker at heart.” For the seasoned listener, there’s a trail of psychedelic breadcrumbs to find throughout the track list. Rudy dedicates the album to those who love so hard that they neglect to water their own garden. Even in a much colder climate, the closet botanist continues to grow. [A transparent teal colorway is available.]\n\nDeath Cab For Cutie – Codes And Keys [Reissue/2011] 2xLP (Barsuk)\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie’s seventh studio album, Codes And Keys was originally released in 2011 and is back in stock.

More From 1970 is a collection of rarities and outtakes.\n\nFront 242 – Front By Front [Reissu/e1988] LP (RRE)\n\n242EBM was a real time bomb. A set of sounds, collages and extracts gleaned here and there, dynamized by intense vocal parts, it would continue to influence a lot of other groups in the years that followed. Without Front 242’s Front By Front, there would never have been a Nine Inch Nails. An important album in the discography of the founding fathers of EBM, Front 242 created its own path and then laid the foundations for industrial electronic music. This development of rhythms would be resampled in turn by several Eurobeat or technoid bands that came after. Boosted by the success of the single Headhunter, which remains their most famous track to this day, Front 242 finally emerged from the shadows to become the most accessible ambassadors of EBM.\n\nGatekeeper – From Western Shores LP (Cruz Del Sur Music)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on vinyl.

This is where the soul of man never dies’”. This 16-track LP features the bluesman’s best-loved songs from the first decade or more of his recording career, comprising songs from his 1951 debut recording for Phillips in Memphis, through to 1962 by which time commercial blues had become focused on the middle-class, white student market as much as its traditional black roots.\n\nJunior Jack – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nJunior Jack (Vito Lucente) is a DJ and producer who was born in Rutigliano, Italy.

The doomed tale unfolds as Jawny weaves his way through the uncertainty against a milieu of ballads, larger than life anthems, technicolor melodies, a collaboration with Grammy award-winning artist Beck and much more. Featuring “Fall In Love” along with the previously released songs “True”, “Wide-Eyed”, “Adios”, “Strawberry Chainsaw”, and “Take It Back”, Jawny shares, “I feel like I made my dream album that I wish I had the ability to make when I was 17.”\n\nJan Jelinek –Seascape – Polyptych LP (Faitiche)\n\nOne of the most notorious hatemongers in movie history is Captain Ahab from John Huston’s 1956 classic Moby Dick.

Brought together to perform new Mingus compositions for the first time in public, the recording was initially considered weak due to limited rehearsal time, but the years have been kind to this recording and it’s a fantastic set of Mingus compositions.\n\nMono – Vol. 1 10”+MP3 (Temporary Residence)\n\nLimited ice-blue colorway. Recorded by Takaakira ‘Taka’ Goto at his home studio in Japan (with drums recorded by Amak Golden at Golden Hive Studio in Prague) – and mixed by Rafael Anton Irisarri and Jeremy deVine at Black Knoll Studio in New York – Heaven Vol. 1 finds Mono at their most hopeful and cinematic.\n\nMorgan & The Organ – M.O.D.S.

Marek is the outer national musician par excellence. When he’s not working as general manager of the legendary Golden Pudel Club in Hamburg, he travels the world, meets people and records music with them. With his inimitable productions between hip-hop, acid and dub, he has long been known as the “Madlib from the Waterkant” far beyond the borders of Hamburg.\n\nBill Orcutt – Jump On It LP (Palilalia)\n\n“It’s been ten years since Bill Orcutt released A History of Every One (2013), a compendium of hacksaw renditions of American standards on acoustic guitar – and since ten years is a blink of an eye, you are forgiven for not immediately realizing that we’ve gone an entire decade waiting for Jump On It, the next Orcutt solo acoustic record. As those of us of ‘a certain age’ will tell you (ad nauseam), a decade is a blink of an eye containing an infinity of experiential moments, and if this record is any gauge, the weight of those experiences have squashed Orcutt’s rough edges, feathered his stop-motion timing into a languid lyrical flow, and snapped the shackles tethering his instant compositional skills to the imperative to deconstruct guitar history. In short, Jump On It is a collection of canonical, mature acoustic guitar solo to contrast against the fractured downtown conceits of previous acoustic releases…” – Tom Carter\n\nDaniel O’Sullivan – The Physic Garden LP (VHF)\n\nThird in a trilogy of albums of library music miniatures from composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O’Sullivan (Æthenor, Ulver, This Is Not This Heat, etc) following 2020’s Electric Māyā and 2021’s Fourth Density.\n\nCarly Pearce – 29: Written In Stone (Live From Music City) 2xLP (Big Machine)\n\nRecently released on CD – now available on gold color vinyl. 2021 CMA Female Vocalist and 2022 ACM Awards Female Artist of the Year, Carly Pearce has come a long way from the pain she felt writing 29.

Of the band Butter?! The funk-pop duo Q?! Or Fuschimuschi?! All this funk jazz- or hip-hop-influenced, wondrous psychedelic soul music from Germany? A quarter of a century later, Who Cares Who Cares is the name of Wolfgang Pérez’s solo debut album. His music, on the other hand – caught between indie pop, funk, jazz and tropicalismo – doesn’t sound at all like coming from someone who doesn’t know where he belongs. Quite the opposite: It sounds like the big wide interconnected world of pop out there and inside of us.\n\nAstor Piazzolla – Tango: The Best Of Astor Piazzolla LP (Acrobat)\n\nTango’s modern master, Astor Piazzolla, was a composer who revolutionized the music of his native Argentina. In the 1950s, he single-handedly invented nuevo tango – a modernized version of the passionate dance rhythms born in the brothels of Buenos Aires during the 1880s. Playing the bandoneon, an Argentinian form of accordion, he developed an eclectic outlook, playing music that transcended the genres, with its roots in Latin forms but incorporating classical motifs and tinged with various jazz influences.\n\nPublic Image Ltd. – Hawaii 7” (PiL Official)\n\nLimited blue color vinyl pressing. One of the most personal pieces of songwriting and accompanying artwork that Lydon has shared. “Hawaii” is a love letter to John’s wife of nearly five decades, Nora, who is living with Alzheimer’s. The pensive, personal yet universal love song captures John reflecting on their lifetime well spent and one of their happiest moments together in Hawaii.

Originally from Genk, Limbourg, in the Flemish Region, the musical style of the group is influenced by that of Joy Division.\n\nSingle Mothers – Roy LP (Dine Alone)\n\nColor vinyl pressing. New release from Canadian punks Single Mothers. Written over the course of a week during a particularly challenging time for frontman and Single Mothers’ only permanent member Drew Thomson, Roy is a complete anomaly not only within the music scene but within the band’s own catalog. It’s a far cry from the scathing hardcore rippers of their beloved 2014 release, Negative Qualities, and it bears little resemblance to the more mellowed post-punk sounds that populated 2022’s Everything You Need. Instead, Roy dabbles a bit in ‘80s new wave and a bit in tripped-out indie-rock.\n\nShane Smith & The Saints – Geronimo [Reissue/2019] LP (Geronimo West)\n\nGold colorway. Hints of folk, rock, country, and Americana all shine through a driving, rootsy fiddle beat stew that’s connected with students, hipsters, bikers, roughnecks, indie rockers, and songwriter buffs.

For over five decades, the legendary keyboardist and bandleader has been a driving force in shaping the genre’s sound. Smith made his recording debut as a sideman for heavyweights Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, Gato Barbieri and Leon Thomas. He later formed his own ensemble, Lonnie Liston Smith and the Cosmic Echoes which delivered an incredible run of classic albums through the 1970s. His music has served as the foundation for immortal hip-hop samples and ecstatic dance floor revelry. Jazz Is Dead 17 is a full-bloom tribute to the multitude of sonic strains that all lead back to the fingertips of the maestro himself.\n\n$uicide Boy$ – Sing Me A Lullaby, My Sweet Temptation LP (G59)\n\nLimited green color vinyl pressing. We choose life or death. No third option exists. $uicideboy$ rap like their lives depend on it because they do.

Ruby da Cherry-out of a violent drug-riddled hood nightmare and into an underground phenomenon.\n\nSuperheaven – Jar [Reissue/2013] LP (Run For Cover)\n\nExpanded tenth anniversary violet color vinyl pressing of the Superheaven’s breakthrough debut album.

Working with producer Will Yip (Turnstile, Title Fight) at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, PA, these songs showcase a talent for writing both jarringly heavy and delicately emotional songs, mixed with the size and clarity of major label grunge breakthrough records like Nirvana’s Nevermind or Failure’s Fantastic Planet.\n\nSure Fire Soul Ensemble – Live At Panama 66 LP (All-Town Sound)\n\nThe Sure Fire Soul Ensemble is a nine-piece heavy, instrumental funk band from San Diego, CA.

Both songs produced by Leon Michels and featuring vocals from two very special guests. Side A, “So Low” has the ethereal, haunting, yet sweet charm that could soundtrack a scene from Lost In Translation and features vocals by Claire Cotrill as her and producer Leon Michels do their own bottom heavy version of the obscure ‘80s cult classic by Carol. Side B, “You And I” is a low-fi banger carried by synth lines and an echoed-out drum loop. Helsinki’s MALLA is the perfect complement to the track singing about looking to leave an old love and find a new one with an energy that leaves this one stuck in your heart and your head.\n\nMidori Takada – Through The Looking Glass [Reissue/1983] 2xLP (WRWTFWW)\n\nColor vinyl reissue of Japanese percussionist Midori Takada’s sought after and timeless ambient / minimal album, originally released in 1983 by RCA Japan. Considered a Holy Grail of Japanese music by many, Through The Looking Glass is Midori Takada’s first solo endeavor, a captivating four-song suite capturing her deep quests into traditional African and Asian percussive language and exploring contemplative ambient sounds with an admirably precise use of marimba. The result is alternatively ethereal and vibrant, always precise and mesmerizing, and makes for an atmospheric masterpiece and an unparalleled sonic and spiritual experience.\n\nThe Tender Things – That Texas Touch LP (Spaceflight)\n\nThe Tender Things is the new project from Heartless Bastards bassist Jesse Ebaugh. Ebaugh’s love of ‘70s – ‘80s country rock pioneered by The Flying Burrito Brothers, Merle Haggard and Dwight Yoakam led him to create The Tender Things when he left Heartless Bastards in 2016. That Texas Touch is the band’s sophomore record, full of the kind of straight-forward funky Country gems that used to grace ‘70s AM radio airwaves and fill Texas dancehalls.\n\nTolerance – Divin [Reissue/1981] 2xLP (Mesh Key)\n\nDespite all Japan’s technological and cultural advances in the 1970s and ’80s, it’s hard to believe this one’s over 40 years old. Junko Tange’s second and final album – a minimalistic, phantasmagoric masterpiece of distant, dreamlike voices woven through pulsating, dubbed-out drum machines, synths and static, originally issued by Osaka’s Vanity Records in 1981. Divin once again features Masami Yoshikawa on vocals, standing out as one of the most peculiar and prophetic records of the era, pre-empting ideas that wouldn’t be approached so thoroughly again until the IDM/dub techno era a good decade-and-a-half later.\n\nTRAINING – *x EP [Reissue/2020] 12” (Fun In The Church)\n\nTRAINING & John – Three Seconds [Reissue/2021] LP (Fun In The Church)\n\nOut of sheer joy of liberated playing, drummer Max Andrzejewski and saxophonist Johannes Schleiermacher have been meeting regularly since mid- 2019 in a Berlin rehearsal room – simply to play away from their fixed ensembles. It took them only a few training sessions, though, until they realized they had already gained a fixed repertoire again. From a casual affair, they became a steady duo, which quickly found its own language, its own way of playing and expressing jazz, post rock and electronic music: TRAINING. In addition to their “main instruments”, the two also work on synthesizers, vintage echo devices, garage organs, and vocals.\n\nTrash Boat – Nothing I Write You Can Change What You’ve Been Through [Reissue/2016] LP (Hopeless)\n\nTrash Boat – Crown Silence [Reissue/2018] LP (Hopeless)\n\nTrash Boat – Don’t You Feel Amazing?

None other than Françoise Sagan has described his special “je ne sais quoi” perfectly: “There is in Arnold Turboust something of Trenet’s fluidity, Gainsbourg’s detachment, a kind of tender indulgence for others, demanding for himself; a humor without cynicism and a most pleasing musical diversity.”\n\nUboa – The Origin Of My Depression [Reissue/2019] LP (The Flenser)\n\nIn an artistic landscape fueled by gamified promotional tactics, spasmodic virality, and manufactured controversy, the amount of noise that independent artists must cut through can seem overwhelming. Yet, it’s the most genuine statements-often those expecting no audience at all-that overcome. The Origin Of My Depression, the 2019 album from Australian experimentalist Uboa, proves just that; presenting such a deeply affecting mix of dark ambient, noise, and extreme metal, it all but demanded it’s unplanned but unsurprising cult following.\n\nVarious Artists – Chansons d’Indonesie (Songs From Indonesia) LP (Le Saule)\n\nVincent Moon (Petites Planètes) not only gathers movies from his trips, but he also collects songs. Contemporary or traditional songs performed by professionals, or not, recorded in situ, out of the stage or the studio, songs that are just lived and transmitted. These are such beautiful musics from Indonesia that Le Saule wanted to compile on a beautiful object.\n\nVarious Artists – Chanson de Russie (Songs From Russia) LP (Le Saule)\n\nVincent Moon (Petites Planètes) not only gathers movies from his trips, but he also collects songs. Contemporary or traditional songs performed by professionals, or not, recorded in situ, out of the stage or the studio, songs that are just lived and transmitted.

This ‘concerto’ for an innovative player of a traditional instrument was made possible with the creative input of Egberto Gismonti, here the arranger of the material for strings, as well as co-composer and supporting soloist. The Radio Symphony Orchestra Stuttgart was conducted by Mladen Gutesha (who had worked with ECM previously on trans-idiomatic projects with Keith Jarrett, Jan Garbarek and Terje Rypdal).\n\nVeil Of Maya – The Common Man’s Collapse [Reissue/2008] LP (Sumerian)\n\n15-year anniversary blue w/ gold, black & white multicolor vinyl pressing of Chicago deathcore band’s second album.\n\nThe Warlocks – The Chain [Reissue/2020] LP+MP3 (Cleopatra)\n\nPurple haze color vinyl pressing of the most recent studio album from L.A.’s premiere psych band.\n\nThe Weakerthans – Reconstruction Site [Reissue/2003] LP+MP3 (Epitaph)\n\nApple & black half-and-half color vinyl pressing of the Canadian emo punk band’s third album.\n\nThe Weathermen – PIAS 40 12” (PIAS America)\n\nThe Weathermen is a humorous electronic duo based in Belgium.

In 1987 their hit “Poison” caught the attention of a wider audience.\n\nWeedeater – Sixteen Tons"
