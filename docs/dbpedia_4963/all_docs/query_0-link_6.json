        "text": "Mya Adriene Byrne is a poet, award-winning performing songwriter, and activist Based in New York for 13 years and currently residing in San Francisco. A proud trans woman, she established her solo folk-Americana career in 2012 after years of performing with roots-rock band, the Ramblers, opening for acts such as Levon Helm and performs solo or with various bands on both coasts .\n\n​\n\nMya says:\n\n\"I was struck by a moment at a reading I did for a queer magazine about ten days ago; one of the other readers said this line: \"Even in your ordinary, there is something great.\" I was totally moved by this, and used the line in a quote. When I went to write my song yesterday, it was kicking around in my notes, and out this song came! I am crediting the writer, Yassine Senghor, for directly inspiring this song (and of course giving songwriting credit!). The repeated refrain of \"this I know\" was inspired by a translation of a Hebrew song I heard sung at a virtual Seder last week. Just thinking about the little things everyone does every day that we might not think about that give so much to the world. We are all doing great things, every moment! Love y'all.\"\n\n​\n\nSkipping Stones\n\nIn each day there little things you do\n\ncausing ripples in the waters that you’re wading through\n\nEven if it’s just from skipping stones Em\n\nsomewhere someone feels them this I know\n\nSomedays you may feel at a dead end\n\nwhat if it’s the starting line where you start again\n\nYou may not be clear on where to go Em\n\nyou’ll find out in the journey, this I know\n\n“Even in your ordinary, there is something great”\n\nI’ve heard poets say G D It’s\n\nall right to not understand what every moment shapes\n\nThose answers may be many years away"
