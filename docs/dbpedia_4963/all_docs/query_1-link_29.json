        "text": "Reppin’ Where I’m From\n\nMusic Majors Share Music to Listen to While Studying\n\nNeed some tunes to help you study for finals? Here are some recommendations from upperclassmen music majors.\n\nSpiegel im Spiegel – Arvo Pärt\n\n“It’s one of my favorite minimalist pieces. It repeats over and over, so it’s good to listen to when you’re trying to focus. I love how delicate it sounds; it reminds me of a lullaby. A couple years ago, I was reading a book called ‘The Rest Is Noise’ by Alex Ross. Pärt was mentioned in it, so I wanted to dive into his music more,” says senior Kimmy Speers, a Music Education: Instrumental major from Morristown, NJ (Morris County).\n\n3Am Talk – Icemann\n\n“Chill vibe. I created the song myself,” says first-generation junior Justin Nunez, a Music Industry major with a concentration in Technology and a transfer from Kean University from Jackson, NJ (Ocean County).\n\nNocturnes (all 21) – Chopin\n\n“It is very calming and relaxing. Chopin is very popular in the classical music world, and played very often by pianists,” says senior Lisa Harkisheimer, a Music Education Instrumental major from Sicklerville, NJ (Gloucester County).\n\nEtude No.2 – Phillip Glass\n\n“Phillip Glass is a minimalist artist. His songs are thought provoking and stimulating to the ear. I studied minimalist artists in my theory course a year ago and found the compositions of Phillip Glass. I use his Playlist on Spotify to focus when I’m studying and thought it might help other students,” say junior Melissa Breslin of Washington Township, NJ (Gloucester County), a Music Education Instrumental major and transfer student from Rowan College at Gloucester County.\n\nRêverie – Claude Debussy (or really anything by Debussy)\n\n“It relaxes me without putting me to sleep. I discovered the song by researching romantic composers on my own and also hearing his music in my music classes,” says senior Liz Cicali, a Music Education major with a specialization in instrumental music from Absecon, NJ (Atlantic County).\n\nThe Brain Dance – Animals as Leaders\n\n“This will stimulate your mind and senses in every way. You will be awakened to learn and receptive to new information. I discovered the song at a concert,” says senior Sunshine Jones, a Music Education Vocal Major and Classical Guitar minor from Sewell, NJ (Gloucester County).\n\nL.A. Vibes – Iman Omari\n\n“Iman Omari is the king of chill and loops. He’s a producer that makes dream like beats. He can chop any song up and claim it as his own. A lot of his music doesn’t contain words, he has a beat tape that has nothing but loops and it really helps me study. Hearing the beats allow me to read, think and focus on my tasks. I’m able to listen to music and concentrate, that’s all I need in this world. Music and focus,” says first-generation college junior Phinesse Scott, a Music Industry major and transfer student from Rowan College at Burlington County\n\nPhinesse adds: “I discovered Iman Omari through YouTube. You can really go down a never-ending hole on YouTube. I typically like to search for beats on there and I came across one of his old tracks and it was at that moment I became a fan and looked for every song I could find that he made.”\n\nCheck Yes Juliet – We The Kings\n\n“It’s a good song and catchy but by studying to this song it helps you to think back to what you read right before an exam if you listen to it again. It’s a popular pop rock song similar to artists I listen to,” says first-generation college junior Amanda Uretsky, a Music Industry major with a concentration in Technology and Business from Lumberton, NJ (Burlington County).\n\nImagine Paris – Daniel Paterok\n\n“I find this song very relaxing, which I believe is important when doing homework or studying. Plus, I find the melody really pretty and catchy. I found this song on a public Spotify playlist that I sometimes listen to when I study,” says junior Emileigh Zane, a Music Industry major with a Business concentration who transferred from Rowan College of South Jersey and is from Penns Grove, NJ (Salem County).\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nMeet #Rowan2025: Incoming First-Year Student Dara Donahue\n\nToday we speak to Dara Donahue, an incoming first-year Marketing major from Wantage, NJ (Sussex County).

I have attended some virtual events as well.\n\nDo you have advice for other high school seniors who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nMy advice is cheesy, but just listen to your gut and see how you feel at each college you tour.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nBeyond the Classroom: Tanvi Koduru, 3D Confectionery CEO\n\nTanvi Koduru is a senior Entrepreneurship major and hails from Somerset, NJ.

Sara is a Psychology major originally from Orlando, Florida who transferred from Rowan College of Burlington County. She shares why she chose Rowan and what she’s looking forward to!\n\nWelcome to Rowan! Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nI am looking forward to completing my bachelor’s degree in Psychology at a school that has progressive outlook on mental health and mindfulness.\n\nIf you are from out of state, why did you choose a university not in your home state? Why Rowan?\n\nI grew up in Florida, and when I moved to New Jersey after getting married, I was lucky enough to find RCBC and enroll in their 3+1 program, which has given me the opportunity to transfer into Rowan University for my senior year and complete my bachelor’s degree in Psychology.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nOne [activity] that I look forward to becoming a part of is Rowan Thrive, especially in their Emotional Well-Being program. Stress and anxiety is something that all students face, and having resources that can help in learning how to navigate these emotions is important for everyone to discover their best self.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nI am really looking forward to exploring more in Student Services and learning how I can be of service to more transfer students like myself who are coming into a new university and the opportunities that are available.\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nI am a senior psychology major due to my natural interest in learning about why people are the way that they are. I currently work as a Behavioral Health Technician at an alcohol and drug treatment center working toward completing a certification as a Certified Alcohol Drug Counselor. Being able to complete my bachelor’s degree at Rowan and continue on to a master’s degree in Clinical Psychology is my goal, where I will focus more on dual diagnosis aspect of addiction.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nDue to COVID being very present in my time of transferring to a university, I have only been able to attend virtual events and I have really enjoyed them. Being able to schedule Zoom advising sessions and talk with an advisor one-on-one has been so helpful in planning my future goals.\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nNot to focus too much on where you want to transfer schools to but why. Look into schools that offer programs that you could see yourself being a part of after graduation and that have programs that you could see yourself being a part of.\n\nWhere are you going to live next year?\n\nCommute from home.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nI really liked that they offer so many courses in Psychology that focus on research and the study of behavior, especially mindfulness, and that they offer a Philosophy track as well.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotos courtesy of\n\nSara Brooks\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Business Management Major Brett Fleming\n\nMeet incoming transfer Brett Fleming. Brett is a Business Management major who calls Washington Township, NJ (Gloucester County) home. He transferred from Rowan College of South Jersey. He shares why he chose Rowan University and what he’s looking forward to!\n\nWelcome to Rowan! Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward to at Rowan University?\n\nI am looking forward to attending in-person classes again. I have always enjoyed direct instruction from my professors and interesting interactions with my classmates. I appreciate when a professor relays his or her expertise while also sharing real-life experiences with us.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nAlthough I was involved in many extracurricular activities in high school such as varsity basketball, acting groups, choir and school musicals, my current school and work responsibilities have since consumed my time. I am now a RCSJ ISP [Intern Scholarship Program] Business Administration and Marketing intern, a bank CSA [Customer Service Associate], a committed gym goer, and an attendee at a college-age Bible study.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nNow that I have completed most of my general education classes at RCSJ, I look forward to digging deeper into the field of business. I hope to acquire applicable knowledge and wisdom in classes such Consumer Behavior, Operations Management, Principle of Training and Management, and the Business Management Simulation. Also, if time permits, I would love to have the opportunity to act or to play basketball again.\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nI am enrolled as a Business Management major, and I also am minoring in Marketing. Since I was young, I have always loved working with both numbers and people. I am a reader, researcher and communicator. I have grown up playing sports and performing for others. I have been a camp counselor in multiple venues, and I was also an after-school child care provider in an elementary work setting.\n\nEvery day, I manage my time, resources, workload, employment and social life. I am always planning, scheduling and troubleshooting. I am constantly making phone calls, sending emails and texts, and ideally, connecting with others in person to develop relationships. While doing this, I strive to be genuinely caring and professional. Hopefully, that’s good management.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nAlthough I have not toured Rowan’s academic buildings or attended any virtual events yet, I am familiar with the campus because some of my friends are Rowan students. Additionally, I have already made fun memories at Rowan’s surrounding restaurants and shops.\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nMy advice would be to commit to Rowan University, which has a great reputation all across the country. Rowan is practically in my backyard, offers me a solid education at an affordable price, and allows me to conveniently commute. It is a win-win in my book.\n\nWhere are you going to live next year?\n\nCommute from home.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nEven though I am transferring as a junior, I am already connected to Rowan University. I remember going to both the Escape Room and the Virtual Reality Center with my friends. I’ve also been to one of Rowan’s basketball games. I can recall the electricity of the crowd as they cheered on our home team. All in all, I have developed a built-in affinity to Rowan.\n\nAlso, I love how my foundational learning at RCSJ seamlessly transfers to Rowan. Because of this uncomplicated process, I can easily continue my undergraduate education.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior, music industry major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJoe Gentempo, senior art major\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Human Services & Psychology Major NyEsha Cintron\n\nMeet incoming transfer student NyEsha Cintron.

She shares how she ended up at Rowan and what she’s looking forward to!\n\nWelcome to Rowan! Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nI am looking forward to meeting new people, the ability to foster lasting relationships and grow in experience with my area of study. I am excited to see how school will impact my life as well as how I will impact the lives of others.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nI’d like to get involved in the Human Services Club or a language club.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nI will be taking a Spanish class, and I’d like to see my knowledge increase in this language to speak it fluently.\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nI am a Human Services and Psychology major through and through. I love learning how to better understand people in efforts to better serve them. These majors are very organic to how I am wired, and I feel that I can be my best by furthering my education in these areas of studies.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nI haven’t had the time to do so, but am awaiting orientation for transfer students, can’t wait!\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nDo it and get started!\n\nWhere are you going to live next year?\n\nCommute from home.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nI like that Rowan participated with community colleges to ensure continuity of learning to a accredited university.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nBeyond the Classroom: Junior Ad Major Madelaine Mayfield and Her Passion for Nonprofits\n\nToday we feature Madelaine Mayfield, a junior Advertising major and recent transfer student from the Rowan College of South Jersey, Cumberland Campus. Madelaine hails from Millville, NJ (Cumberland County) and currently interns for the Bullock Garden Project in Glassboro, NJ.\n\nCan you tell us more about the Bullock Garden Project?\n\nThe Bullock Garden Project (BGP) is a nonprofit that aims to empower and educate families to grow their own food. They’re especially focused on helping with food insecurity in marginalized communities as well as informing people about the overall benefits of gardening.\n\nFor one of our many projects, I attended a Zoom meeting about helping schools in New Jersey and Pennsylvania [by providing gardening] supplies and showing them how to garden. We have about 10 schools involved in this project including the Glassboro Child Development Center, Tewksbury Elementary and Secaucus High School.\n\nThe Rowan grant-funded project consists of free webinars called Get Up and Grow with the founder, Sonya Harris. Attendees can ask her any questions, and Sonya gives them valuable advice. She also will send them supplies! We have kids, grown-ups and college students attending. We usually have about 20 to 25 people attend.\n\nSonya worked at a school [as a special education teacher] and she made a garden one day at her school. Then, she reached out to a TV show about improving gardens. They came out and helped her. She realized that she wanted to help other schools have the same opportunity.\n\nHow did you come across this position and what motivated you to join?\n\nThis job position was posted on ProfLink under Content Creation and Social Media. What motivated me was the fact that it was a nonprofit. I want to use my skills and what I’m learning for a good cause and a greater purpose. I was really excited because I love nonprofits. It motivates me more, knowing that [my work is] for a good cause. I know that if more people join and donate, then it’s helping the future.\n\nCould you tell us a little bit about other BGP projects?\n\nI came up with the Kind Acts Initiative as BGP’s Christmas campaign, where each member of our staff did at least one kind act. I did another campaign recently, where I share quick environmental facts. Before the pandemic, BGP would go to school and help them with supplies and gardening.\n\nWhat classroom skills are you practicing in your internship?\n\nThe most influential class has been Advertising Copywriting. I practice copywriting in social media posts, captions and graphics. I’ve learned so much about how to get audiences engaged, how to create better content, and how important social media is (especially with BGP). Social media has helped BGP to grow and gain a lot of recognition.\n\nWhat was the most rewarding part about working with BGP?\n\nThe most rewarding part about working with BGP is the amazing staff who are truly so encouraging, uplifting and want to see me grow. I feel very appreciated, and I know that they all care about me. Also, knowing that I’m doing work for an organization that is changing the world, school by school. They always encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone. They’re [supportive] of everything I do. I haven’t had that in any other job in my past. It’s so refreshing. I don’t feel embarrassed or scared in any way when I [share my work].\n\nWhat skills and knowledge did you develop from working with BGP?\n\nDefinitely communication because I have to do meetings and social media. I know how to communicate my ideas and convince [the team] that it will work. I got my video editing skills from my YouTube channel I started in high school. I’m also really thankful for the graphic design skills I learned from Prof. Nancy Reighn-Garron in Publication Layout & Design. She was so helpful and always went out of her way to help me. I record the Zoom meetings and edit them into an Instagram video. I really like making videos because they are more engaging than photos.\n\nWhat made you decide to switch majors from Radio/TV/Film to Advertising?\n\nI chose Advertising because I want to help amazing small businesses, nonprofits and other organizations get the recognition they deserve. I love creating content, being creative and engaging with others online.\n\nWhat advice would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nGet involved, especially with internships, and do as many as you can so that you can gain experience. Figure out what you want to do. Working for BGP, I figured out so many things. I wasn’t really sure what I wanted to do advertising, but now I know I want to work in social media. Doing it outside of class definitely helps you. You can use the skills that you learned in class, outside of class.\n\nAdvertising impacts the world in a way that spreads the word about brands, companies and organizations. Advertising is a huge factor in what the public consumes. As an advertising major, I want to make sure there are positive things being shared for a good cause.\n\nI would like to bring attention to what matters most. Working for non-profits, I would like to encourage others to help and get involved in some of the global issues.\n\nCheck out the Bullock Garden Project at https://www.bullockgardenproject.org/.\n\nView more of Madelaine’s work on\n\nInstagram: @bullockgarden\n\nYouTube: Bullock Garden Project, Inc.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Advertising Major Paul Coppola\n\nMeet incoming transfer student Paul Coppola!

Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nI’m looking forward to the general experience of going to school that isn’t a community college. The experience to me sounds like an enjoyable one and I couldn’t be more excited about it.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nI’ve recently become interested in writing. I had joined a Philadelphia Eagles blog and honed my skills there but I wish to increase those during my time at Rowan.\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nI will be majoring in Advertising because I enjoy the creative aspect behind it and that world in general just fascinates me.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nI attended a virtual orientation. I enjoyed the process a lot. They had made it sound like a much easier transition than I had originally thought it was going to be.\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nJust breathe. You’ll find the school of your dreams. It may not happen immediately but you’ll get that acceptance letter and feel a sense of relief.\n\nWhere are you going to live next year?\n\nCommute from home.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nThe environment!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by: Bianca Torres, senior, Music Industry major\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Future History Educator Kendra Hahn\n\nMeet incoming transfer student Kendra Hahn!

Kendra shares with us why she chose Rowan and what she’s looking forward to.\n\nWelcome to Rowan! Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nHere at Rowan I am really looking forward to making new friendships and gaining new experiences, but then also being able to successfully pursue my passion.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nIn high school I was always involved with student council/government and it definitely made me into the person I am today, so I would love to continue that here at Rowan! I also would love to join the Student History Association and even possibly the History Honor Society since I was in History Club and National Honor Society back in high school.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nAt Rowan I definitely want to join a sorority. I believe joining a sorority will provide me with a lot of learning opportunities and help me gain important skills, such as leadership and communication skills. In addition, I think joining a sorority will help me make connections on campus, meet a diverse amount of new people, and give me long-lasting friendships!\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nThis fall I will be in the History Education (BA/MST) Program. Ever since I was a young child, I’ve always wanted to be a teacher. Teachers have a unique opportunity to make a difference in the lives of their students, and I even believe they hold the key to secure our future. This is something I long to be a part of. Additionally, I have always had a passion for learning about history, so I have a desire to pass this knowledge on to others in as well as outside the classroom.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nI have toured Rowan a few times when I was in high school, and I also recently just did the virtual guided tour where you walk around campus yourself with a guide on your phone. I enjoyed it a lot, and it made me very excited to be on campus in the fall!\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nI know that transferring to a college can be scary and stressful, but just try and stay as positive as possible! The first couple weeks I realized I wanted to transfer, I won’t lie — I felt overwhelmed and not sure where to begin. However, I took my time and made sure to get as much information as possible so I could make a decision that would help me reach every one of my goals.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nI love how many opportunities Rowan has for its students as well as their class sizes. I believe that smaller class sizes will give the professor the opportunity to know me as an individual and not just a student, which I find very important. Also, I am really excited that they offer a master’s program for the history education program that I am in!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nStudent photos courtesy of:\n\nKendra Hahn\n\nWe are #RowanPROUD to be included on Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society’s 2021 Transfer Honor Roll, which recognizes select nationwide colleges and universities that foster dynamic pathways for transfer students.\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Advertising Major Jess Battistelli\n\nMeet incoming transfer student and Advertising major Jess Battistelli from Williamstown, NJ (Gloucester County).

Here is her inspiring story.\n\nBrittany learned about Rowan’s graduate program at her prior institution, Montclair University. The program was appealing to her because of the size of Rowan’s residential life department and the benefits that came with the hands-on experience Rowan offers their grads.\n\nBrittany describes it as “a two-year program that develops graduate students working in academic and student affairs. We are tasked to foster diversity and inclusion within the residence halls by supporting students and their identity. Our goal is to learn how to make universities a better place in the future.”\n\nCurrently, Brittany is the Resident Director of Mimosa Hall, a first-year student residence hall on campus. Her job is to oversee the administrative/logistical process of the residence hall and to manage a staff of resident assistants.\n\n“The best way to describe my job is that I assist the RA’s who assist the residents. I make sure my staff has all the right skills and resources to help our students,” she says.\n\nWhen asked about the most rewarding part of her job, Brittany replies, “Seeing the transformation in each RA from the beginning of the semester to the end. I love watching my staff grow and help them to improve from their mistakes. It’s so nice to see how each RA makes the job unique to them.”\n\nBrittany has had influential mentors throughout her Rowan experience.\n\n“Catie Baxter, who was my direct supervisor and area coordinator, really helped me when I first got here. I felt so tiny but she made me come out of my shell and helped me realize I could do it.”\n\nShe also talks about the impact her Student Development professor had on her. “Dr. Wright’Mair helped me to get out of my comfort zone and think outside of the box. I learned how to really think critically in that class. Dr. Wright’Mair challenged me to the professional I want to be. “\n\nBrittany shared how it feels to be a Latina woman achieving her master’s degree. “It feels incredible. I’m proud to be Latina. I wake up every morning, look at my skin and hair, and am thankful that I have it; I think that goes back to my family and how I was raised.\n\n“Being a part of a minority community does come with personal struggles, but with that comes learning to work with integrity and caring about others. Not many Latina women have a master’s degree, but I am looking forward to being a part of the small percentage that will work to make sure there are more women like us in the future,” she explains.\n\nBrittany is writing her thesis on the Latina student experience with a sense of belonging.\n\nAfter graduation, Brittany wants to continue her career in residential life in a professional position. “I’m currently interviewing for positions and can’t wait to take everything I’ve learned into action and practice.”\n\nWhen asked to give advice to students who want to enter the field of higher education, Brittany says, “Remember your first leadership position and how amazing it was — that experience brought you to this point. Remember that sometimes we have to unlearn to learn, and live in every moment.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nLoredonna Fiore, junior public relations and advertising major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nMeet #Rowan2025: Incoming Molecular and Cellular Biology Major Alyssa Orsini\n\nToday we welcome incoming first year student Alyssa Orsini who will commute from Westville, NJ (Gloucester County).

Madison is a transfer student from Raritan Valley Community College and is from Bridgewater, NJ (Somerset County). She shares with us what a typical day at is like for her and how she transitioned into Rowan.\n\nWhat is a typical Rowan day for you?\n\nI work at Financial Aid in the mornings and afternoons and then I return home to join my Zoom classes. After that, I cook myself dinner or I will treat myself and order out (sushi always). After my work load is done, I love spending quality time with my friends, my boyfriend, and my Big in my sorority. Some nights, I like to go out to Landmark or Chickie’s & Pete’s for a drink with my friends as well (following COVID procedures, of course).\n\nCould you share with us one moment during your time at Rowan that made you feel inspired or confident that you’re in the right major for you?\n\nThe relations that I have built with my professors have made me love my major even more. I am super comfortable with them and love doing my work. The moment I knew I was in the right major was my accomplishment in making the Dean’s List back to back. I struggled with school growing up, and now I have a 3.7 GPA that I am super proud of, it would have not been possible without the Communication Profs.\n\nCould you tell us a little bit about your transition into Rowan as an incoming student? Were you nervous? Excited? Stressed? What people, programs or things helped to make your transition smooth?\n\nI felt all the nerves. Since I was in community college before, I was super eager to start a new chapter of my life away from home to learn who I am as a person on my own. I was super excited to start my classes but worried I wouldn’t make any friends. But Rowan’s students and profs are the nicest people I have ever met. Class was never boring. Joining my sorority, Alpha Epsilon Phi, also had a huge impact on my social life. Without this org, I wouldn’t have all of the friends that I do, today.\n\nWhat are your professional goals?\n\nCurrently I am not sure what I want to do for a job after college. I would love to work in the social media field for a big company if possible.\n\nHow has Rowan helped to support you with your professional goals?\n\nMy profs have always been very supportive toward me, they are very understanding and are always willing to help if you need it, which was very nice and comforting. If I was ever confused they would help me with an assignment if needed. My sorority has always encouraged us to prioritize school work first to make sure that we stayed on top of our grades. My profs and advisor always let us know about potential Internships as well.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by: Bianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotography by: Joe Gentempo, senior art major\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Fabrizio A. Galindo of Whiting, NJ\n\nMeet incoming transfer Fabrizio Galindo, who will live on campus in the fall. Fabrizio is a first generation college student and an aspiring Biological Sciences major from Whiting, NJ (Ocean County) transferring from Stockton University.\n\nWelcome to Rowan! Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nI look forward to growing as a person while achieving my academic goals and succeeding at all the dreams I set my mind to.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nMost of my time I spend studying online. I think I would like to try an Honor society and develop my hobbies with them. I found that to be a lot more ideal.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nI found out that Rowan’s science department is among the best ones in NJ. I feel that involving myself in Physics and Math clubs would be a set of new skills I will like to grow.\n\nWhat majors are you considering and why?\n\nBiology, Biophysics and physics. I have always wanted to study sciences and these are the best sciences to take if you like particles.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nI have not done so due to Covid. I would like to go to Rowan’s Church and the science building I’m also curious about the Engineering building, I heard they have a pretty good signal.\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nPlease look at all of your opportunities, you have no idea what you are going to miss on if you don’t check Rowan out.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nOther than Dr. Ali A. Houshmand having graduated in mathematics, I liked the University’s private scholarships and the Honors concentration.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by: Bianca Torres, senior, music industry major\n\nMeet Transfer Profs: Future Marine Biologist Malin Barnes\n\nMeet incoming transfer student and Biological Sciences major Malin Barnes.

Could you share with us one thing you are looking forward at Rowan University?\n\nAdvancing my academic career and exploring the music culture on campus.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nI was stationed in New Jersey from Texas. Rowan seemed to be the best fit for transferring my credits to, and the programs seems very credible and comprehensive.\n\nWhat is one hobby, activity, sport or club that you’re involved in that you’d like to continue at Rowan?\n\nSymphonic band/pep band and Greek life.\n\nIs there anything you’re hoping to discover about yourself at Rowan? Grow a new skill? Try a new interest? Starting a new activity, sport or club?\n\nIf possible, I’d like to explore more marine-based skills and explore all the benefits of living in a coastal state.\n\nWhat major are you considering and why?\n\nBiological Science. I want to work towards a master’s of marine biology to pursue a career in coral reef conservation and restoration.\n\nDid you tour Rowan or attend any virtual events? If so, which ones, and what did you think?\n\nI did do a private guided tour of the campus. It was very comprehensive and informative. Although a lot of the tour was focused on freshmen rather than a transferring student, it was fun to explore the campus as a new student would.\n\nDo you have advice for other transfers who haven’t committed to a school yet?\n\nIf you want to focus on your career and not have a huge amount of your campus life spent on sports, Rowan is the place to go. It’s modern and up to date, and isn’t overburdened with a focus on high-level sports.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan itself that you liked?\n\nThe lack of a football focus. Back home it’s all about college sports, but Rowan feels more like a school focused on education.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nWe are #RowanPROUD to be included on Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society’s 2021 Transfer Honor Roll, which recognizes select nationwide colleges and universities that foster dynamic pathways for transfer students.\n\nFrom COVID-19 to the Neighborhood 15\n\nChris Tirri is a Rowan Global student in the master’s of science program for Urban and Regional Planning. The master’s program at Rowan is his third graduate program overall. Born and raised in the Mantua side of Sewell, NJ (Gloucester County) he currently resides off-campus in Mantua Township. His ideal career would be in historic preservation working with vernacular motel architecture and amusement parks, especially in the Wildwoods. If not in historic preservation specifically, then to work as part of a planning firm or board that specializes in adaptive reuse and helping to promote development that enhances local character and history. He shares with us his knowledge of the popularized concept for “15-minute neighborhoods” and how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted this plan on the global scale.\n\nThe concept of the 15-minute neighborhood has been part of planning vernacular for well over a decade as a way to promote walkability and density in urban areas. While the concept may vary by city, its core goal remains the same: residents should be able to access basic life amenities—school, affordable groceries, parks, and doctors’ offices—within a 15-minute commute by foot, bike, or public transit.\n\nDespite its established presence in planning vernacular, the 15-minute neighborhood has yet to achieve widespread application. But the coronavirus pandemic may very well change that.\n\nIn the wake of work- and stay-at-home mandates across the globe, COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way we perceive and use our once-beloved and once-bustling cities. Our sense of place has shifted from city centers to our immediate neighborhoods, home offices, and living rooms, and in many areas, city dwellers have fled their urban enclaves to the surrounding suburbs.\n\nWhile some outlets have declared the pandemic as the death of the city, the renewed interest in the 15-minute neighborhood promises a rebirth of the city as demand rises to redefine, redistribute, and redevelop city centers as more liveable and as those centers give way to neighborhood centers as more people come to prefer shopping close to home.\n\nOne of its main focal points is the overhaul of transportation methods and infrastructure. As peak-commuter traffic continues to trend downward as more jobs become permanently remote, the 15-minute neighborhood necessitates a flexible approach to public transit choices that better accommodate local commuters who use public transit to fulfill daily needs, especially minority commuters who have historically been the victims of divisive planning decisions.\n\nLikewise, it calls for plans that reimagine formerly vehicle-specific streetscapes as places where pedestrians and cyclists can safely coexist and where “streateries” add a newfound vibrancy to downtown life.\n\nCities as we have come to know them were designed largely with those peak-commuters in mind, so available amenities operated to anticipate heavy influxes in the morning and the evening. However, as William Fulton points out, amenities like restaurants, bars, parks, and other public spaces have become increasingly vital to “daily life, not just after work or on the weekends.” Thus, the 15-minute neighborhood’s focus on resilient mixed-use spaces can support a more consistent use of and demand for recreational amenities that promote health, well-being, equity, and a greater sense of community.\n\nThe 15-minute neighborhood hopes to restore the classic planning concept of proximity: of bringing activities to individual neighborhoods rather than forcing people to relocate for those activities. Yet, it is that very sense of proximity that has inspired so many urban residents to seek refuge in private residences in the suburbs.\n\nSo how do we reconcile this paradox?\n\nThe 15-minute neighborhood seeks to reconfigure our notions of what it means to be a city, as well as the art and process of placemaking by drawing from tactical urbanism and creating a bottom-up approach to planning that reconnects residents in socially-distant yet socially-meaning ways, localizes urban life, and redevelops cities with future resiliency in mind, as well as one that avoids potential pitfalls that reify, rather than dismantle, systemic inequalities.\n\nTo avoid those pitfalls, such a reconfigured approach to placemaking must include an individualized approach to cities so that planning properly accounts for context- and situation-dependent differences.Community engagement is key to understanding those differences so that any implementation of the 15-minute neighborhood concept provides residents with the amenities and services they actually want or need.\n\nWithout a genuine understanding of individual needs, we risk disengaging the residents we intend to help, gentrifying neighborhoods instead of suitably improving them, and further fueling the flight to the suburbs.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by: Chris Tirri, Rowan Global student, Rowan University, M.S. in Urban and Regional Planning\n\nJunior Giavana DiDonato Shares Insight on Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\nToday we feature first-generation college student Giavana DiDonato, a junior Electrical and Computer Engineering major from Washington Township, NJ (Gloucester County).

Jake is a first-generation student from Stratford, NJ (Camden County), and a Resident Assistant. Jake is co-president of Rowan Club Baseball and a member of both the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Rowan Economics Society.\n\nOn your busiest day, what personal, academic, non-academic, and social responsibilities are you juggling?\n\nOn my busiest day, I would be balancing my schoolwork, being a Resident Assistant (RA) and the responsibilities that come with that, having two other jobs at Trifecta Therapeutics and Pro Image Sports, while also going on a daily Zoom call with my family members at night.\n\nWhat are your professional goals?\n\nMy short-term professional goals are to apply and get accepted as a second-year Resident Assistant (RA) or Assistant Resident Director (ARD) for the 2021-22 school year, as well as get an internship for the summer to hopefully turn that experience into a career. My long-term professional goals are to graduate from Rowan University and get a job in the marketing, business world to begin my career.\n\nHow are you involved on campus?\n\nOn-campus, I am a Resident Assistant (RA) in 230 Victoria, the co-president of Rowan University’s club baseball team, and a member of the American Marketing Association (AMA). Being involved in these allow me to be involved and network with fellow Profs of different majors, ages and backgrounds. The most supportive of my future goals is AMA, where I interact with fellow marketing majors and network with marketing professionals. Hopefully, by interacting with fellow marketing majors and networking with professionals, I will make connections that will help me get into my future career field.\n\nCould you share with us one moment that made you feel inspired or confident that you’re in the right field for you?\n\nI felt really inspired in my Entrepreneurship class during the final project of the class when my groupmates were looking towards me to lead the project in the marketing aspects. It was a fictional company and product idea that we came up with and I put a lot of effort into the project and we got an A. It may not sound like a lot, but leading this project in the marketing aspect of our project really inspired me and made me feel confident about my chosen major.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a Rowan professor in which you felt like you were working with a visionary in your field.\n\nOne professor who I really enjoy talking to and one who makes me feel supported in my goals is Dr. Michael Milovich, professor of MIS. He is extremely supportive of students’ goals and guiding them to reach them in realistic ways. In his lectures and discussions, he always relates class material to the real world and how we can use tips and tricks that he provides to us to succeed in future situations that we will all experience, such as a job interview or how to move up the ladder of a company. I love him as a professor and would highly recommend that any student take his class if they have the chance.\n\nWhat advice would you give your high school self about choosing a major, campus involvement, or choosing a college/university?\n\nIf I were in high school, I would tell myself to choose a major that I really enjoy and can envision myself working in for the rest of my adult life. As far as finding the perfect college or university, do more research and look around at other schools. Choosing the right place is important so that there isn’t the chance of transferring and going back to square one.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies, and public relations double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJabreeah Holmes, senior radio/TV/film major\n\nMeet #Rowan2025: Uche Ezeukwu of Hamilton, NJ\n\nToday we welcome incoming first year student Uche Ezeukwu.

Jerico is a first-generation college student and off-campus renter from Gloucester County. He tells us about a course that left a lasting impression with him.\n\nWhat is your favorite class?\n\nMy favorite class is Biophysics [now called Molecular Biophysics], which was taught by Dr. Nathaniel Nucci. The course is offered by the Physics Department.\n\nTell us a little about what the class is.\n\nThe class studied biological processes using Gibb’s Free Energy Equation. The equation includes entropy and enthalpy, and entropy is the part where probability comes into play. For instance, the reason our DNA gets read/copied properly is that the probability of the protein going forward and copying correctly is higher than it going backward and copying incorrectly.\n\nThe content of the class was very fascinating to me, and the way that Dr. Nucci taught the course was very effective. He didn’t spoonfeed us information; it was a lot like teaching us how to fish instead so we can independently make the discoveries and solutions.\n\nThat class was the first class that got me really interested and excited about science because before I’ve been studying math on its own like calculus, or studying biology on its own.\n\nThere was always some overlap, but the Biophysics (now it’s called Molecular Biophysics) class really connected the fields and put everything into a new perspective for me. We covered a lot of information, but not so much that it was overwhelming. He kept everything at an understandable pace.\n\nShare with us a few details on why this class was interesting.\n\nThe class put what I knew about biology in mathematical/probabilistic terms, which changed the way I view science, biology and math.\n\nIs there anything else that made this class impactful?\n\nIt pushed me beyond my comfort zone, and how he led the class toward understanding the concepts was empowering because he wouldn’t just give us the answers, but sometimes asked us questions to have us revisit what we thought we knew.\n\nWhat makes this professor great?\n\nHe gave us the tools to figure out the questions. He’d walk around checking in on everyone, always made himself available, and was encouraging.\n\nHow did this class help to support your academic or personal growth or your professional goals?\n\nIt helped me see connections between different fields of science, biology and math. As I take further classes, I grow curious about other connections such as harmony in music and how harmonious movement could be energy efficient.\n\nWhat are your professional goals?\n\nSince I was born in Peru and speak Spanish, I want to go back and start a company there to provide healthy jobs for people and that would benefit the country as a whole, and eventually bring that to other countries around the world.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nMeet #Rowan2025: Isaiah Hymans Strives To Improve Instrumental Skills\n\nMeet incoming first year student Isaiah Hymans.

John, from Ramsey, NJ (Bergen County), is a transfer student from Bergen Community College.\n\nWhat are your professional goals? And how is Rowan helping to support you in those goals?\n\nI am going to Georgetown in the fall for a master’s in Human Resource Management. After that, I hope to work in global HR management. Rowan has Psychology majors take a professions and practice class, that is where I learned about HR master’s programs and realized that is the direction I wanted to go in. Also, I was able to add a Human Resources Management minor to my program which helped me stand out from other applicants to the programs I applied to.\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\nHR is a crucial part of business and has major influences globally. HR has the ability to influence workplace happiness, motivation and profitability. HR also creates a safe and inclusive workplace while ensuring legal compliance. I would like to work in global HR management by designing human resource programs that are able to be applied across multiple cultures.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major?\n\nI was originally a bio/mathematics major and took an Intro to Psychology class to fulfill an elective requirement. I fell in love with psychology because of how diverse and interesting it is. It is an amazing field, which can be related to nearly any topic of interest. I knew after taking that class that I wanted to change my major and pursue a career in some way related to psychology.\n\nAs a student from North Jersey, how did you become aware of Rowan University?\n\nI read about Rowan while researching colleges to transfer to. Rowan is a well-ranked school with classes related to Industrial Organizational Psychology. That made it stand out from other schools.\n\nHow long is your trip/drive “home” to North Jersey?\n\nAround two hours.\n\nWhat are some of the benefits for you, living this distance from home?\n\nI am far enough away from home where things feel different, but still close enough where visiting friends and family is easy. I wanted a change of scenery but I didn’t want it to be too difficult to visit family.\n\nWhat are a few interesting or new things (to you) about Rowan’s South Jersey area that you would share with future out-of-state students?\n\nMostly that South Jersey is very different than North Jersey. They’re like different states. South Jersey has a slower, more relaxed energy. Also, South Jersey is beautiful. It isn’t as crowded or urbanized as North Jersey. I always enjoy driving around and just taking in the open space and beautiful farmland.\n\nWhat off-campus, local fun places do you recommend students check out?\n\nThere is so much good food here and it is so much cheaper to dine out than in North Jersey. There are also vineyards and a brewery near by. Rowan hosts a lot of events. Plus, Philadelphia is only about 20 minutes away so you have the ability to have city life if you want.\n\nWhy did you choose to transfer to Rowan University?\n\nRowan is a well-ranked university with an impressive psychology program taught by respected experts in their fields. Also, Rowan offers classes about Industrial Organizational Psychology, which is my area of interest.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nJabreeah Holmes, senior radio/TV/film major\n\nWe are #RowanPROUD to be included on Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society’s 2021 Transfer Honor Roll, which recognizes select nationwide colleges and universities that foster dynamic pathways for transfer students.\n\nBeyond The Classroom: Business Major Joe Sansone Secures Virtual Internship\n\nJoe Sansone, a senior Business Management and Marketing double major from Monmouth County, shares his experience at his virtual internship with Clearbridge Branding Agency and how he manages his busy schedule.\n\nDo you feel that Rowan provided you with the necessary skills and education to help secure your internship?\n\nI feel like with business majors there is an emphasis on networking and marketing yourself and your resume and just putting yourself out there. We do a lot of group projects so I think that prepares you, too. Communicating with other people who are different from you and working together, I definitely felt prepared with my education.\n\nHow did you secure your internship?\n\nI had a pretty tough time finding an internship, so I was applying to a bunch of different ones. Even though I’m not a Communications major, they have a match program for internships [through Profs Jobs], so I talked to someone in the Communications department and they set me up on this interview with [Clearbridge] and I ended up getting it.\n\nWhat do you love the most about your internship?\n\nI like how they are very flexible around my schedule. I think they’re very respectful to me in the way they communicate with me. My boss is very attentive, polite and respectful yet still laid back and casual at the same time.\n\nHow did you become interested in business?\n\nGoing into college I didn’t really know what I wanted to do. I thought about doing social science, law and justice, or emergency preparedness but I kind of thought about what I was good at. I think for my life and in high school I loved being involved in the school through different clubs and I noticed I liked the leadership position in these clubs. I think Business Management is similar to that.\n\nIs there anyone in your industry that you admire or inspire you?\n\nA lot of my professors have been sources of inspiration for me. They have been industry professionals and bring a lot of experience and examples into the classroom. I think going into college everyone told me, “Oh, your professors are going to be so hard on you, you can’t do what you did in high school.” I think it’s the complete opposite. I think that there’s a level of respect that they have for us and we have for them. I’m motivated and excited to learn because of how nice they are and how informative they are to us.\n\nWhat do you think is the most important to skill to have in your industry?\n\nWillingness to learn. You can’t go into it thinking that you’re going to know everything, going into it open to challenge yourself and willing to be wrong and learning from that is really important.\n\nHow do you handle your time in and out of the classroom?\n\nI just write things down and cross them off as I go. I have a really good memory too, I just know what I need to do in my head. It’s a lot of discipline between my time here. I think every year prepares you for the next. It’s being able to know that I don’t always need to hangout with my friends if I have something to get done but I also can let an assignment wait a little and go out and get my mind off things too. It’s just being responsible and having an end goal in sight.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nCaitlyn Dickinson, senior public relations major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJoe Gentempo, senior art major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Alana Brown of Orientation & Student Leadership Programs\n\nToday we feature Alana Brown, a leader at Rowan University.

I help students with program initiatives on campus and serve as one of their advisors. I also work with the Leadership Rowan Program. For this program, I coordinate the Mentor and Mentee Matching Program and also serve as one of the facilitators for the Leadership Seminars. I am also coordinating the Celebrating Leadership awards this year.\n\nOSLP hosts the orientation events that all new students first attend when they come to campus. We host all of the summer orientations and a few in the winter. We also do some transfer orientations as well. Everything the Leadership Rowan Program and the Office of Greek Affairs do is under the OSLP department.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI’ve learned that it is something I should be a part of. I know that I should contribute to higher education. I know how important my role is for the students and how I can be a liaison between students and staff. I think it is very important to advocate for students because some may feel like their voice is [unheard]. Knowing that I have that bridge, I know that I have a voice and that my voice should be heard. I’m going to advocate for my students. It’s very important to at least have students come to me and feel comfortable enough to express how they may feel about campus and life. Students will remember you for a lifetime if you make an impact.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory as a leader or at Rowan in general?\n\nMy favorite memory was connecting with Chase Campbell and Mike Nash. They came to me about an event they wanted to host on campus. The conversation organically flowed and we built a strong advisor and student relationship. Connecting with those two students has made such an impact on how I want to be [helpful] for other students at my next institution. That moment is when I realized that this [path] is definitely for me.\n\nWhen you’re in grad student as a student and a staff member, you have this scale. You always wonder if you’re a student or a staff member. It always puts me in a place where [I realize], “Wow, I’m making an impact but I’m still learning how to make that impact.” It’s so important for me to be in this role. Without it, I would not have realized what I want in the future.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\n\nI see myself still working in education, but also have my own nonprofit. I want to have a program that provides a space for Black and brown people to create art, especially if they cannot afford to create art [my program] is there to support them. I have always wanted something of my own to pass on to my community and others. I see myself owning my own business and also still advocating for students. There are limited spaces for Black and brown people; it’s okay to chase your passion. You don’t have to just go to school, sit in a classroom for four years and just learn a skill because you need to make money. It’s ok to want to be an artist. Your art and your passion will bring you clientele. Art keeps me going.\n\nWho inspires you and why?\n\nMy mom is very supportive of my dreams. As many times as she wanted to give up, she always found a way to get it done. My mom has sacrificed a lot for me and my brother. There are not enough “Thank You’s” in the world I can say to her. She’s the best.\n\nWhat’s the most significant barrier to women today?\n\nThat’s a hard question because there are so many. We still are not allowed to have a voice. We are told to “let things be how they are.” You step into spaces that may not be diverse. Many times, I’ve been the only Black woman in the room. If I were to speak up, I would be pictured as the “loud, angry Black woman.” I still struggle with this. I want to use my voice, but when I speak people say “she may be angry.” I’m not angry, I’m passionate.\n\nShowing up as your whole self is key. It’s hard being a Black woman. I have to show up in spaces and sometimes keep my mouth shut because I don’t want to be perceived as angry or upset. I don’t regret anything that I have to say. That just makes me, me. I am a bold, Black woman and that’s never going to change.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nAlways own yourself, [your voice]. Always advocate for what you know is right. Be the change that you want to see. If you don’t like something, speak your voice. That voice should never be silent. Anything that you’re passionate about, your voice should never be silent.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJabreeah Holmes, senior radio/TV/film major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Debate Team President and Sophomore Allison Gould\n\nToday we speak to Allison Gould, president of the Law and Justice Debate Team. Allison is a sophomore Finance and Accounting double major from Whippany, NJ (Morris County) and lives on campus. Besides being the president of the Debate Team, Allison is also involved with the Financial Management Association and the Accounting Society.\n\nThis story is part of a series spotlighting campus leaders during Women’s History Month.\n\nWhat is your role in your organization? Briefly describe what your organization does.\n\nI am president of the debate team, so I am in charge of a lot of things. I didn’t get a chance to learn from the seniors before, because of COVID, so I had to figure out the role on my own. Lately, we have been having meetings about current events, having mock debates and working on public speaking.\n\nWhy did you join the Debate Team? What made you want to become president?\n\nI participated in my high school’s debate team all four years of high school. We used a different debate-style called Lincoln Douglas, which is where you go up against your opponent one on one. Rowan does public forum, which is two people going up against each other. I knew I wanted to join the debate team in college because I like it. Winning isn’t the point for me. Even if I don’t win, the point is to better myself and get better at public speaking.\n\nIt was hard to find the club. I remember I was walking to the academic buildings and there was a table set up on the way there [for the debate team]. I heard somebody say debate, and I had to walk back through to sign up.\n\nAs for why I became president, it was more or less because nobody else wanted to step up to the plate. My parents encouraged me to be independent. Leadership is reinforced by whatever environment you grew up in.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI have learned that most leaders don’t know what they’re doing, but they know how to work through it and weave their team. I’ve learned how to not get overwhelmed with everything.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory as a leader or at Rowan in general?\n\nMy favorite memory was being able to do a mock debate for the first time. We were kind of dying a club and we didn’t have that many members, so we weren’t able to do a mock debate. Then, we had more people join, and we were able to.\n\nI feel that a lot of people think they have to win in debates, but you learn more when you lose. Debate is a great skill to have. It teaches you how to persuade people and put arguments together. You also have to learn how to see topics from the other person’s point of view.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nDon’t give up. If you want something enough, you can do it.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major and Rachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies, and public relations double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJoe Gentempo, senior art major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Arielle Gedeon, Leader of the People Who Serves from Her Heart\n\nToday we speak with Arielle Gedeon, a leader at Rowan University. Arielle has served as Student Government Association (SGA) president for two consecutive years. Arielle, a senior Radio/Television/Film (RTF) major, also serves as the president of the Lambda Rho Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated. She calls Galloway, NJ in Atlantic County, her hometown. In addition to being a first-generation college student, Arielle also made history as the first Black female to become the SGA President.\n\nThis story is part of a series spotlighting campus leaders during Women’s History Month.\n\nWhat is your role in your organization?\n\nAs president of the Student Government Association (SGA), I serve as the face of the student body. I oversee the overall operation of SGA and maintain the accountability of the executive board. SGA serves as the voice for the student body and presents any student concerns to Rowan administrators. SGA works closely with Rowan administrators, providing advocacy and support for students. Every student pays a student government fee, which is allocated to 160+ clubs or organizations on campus to fund their budgets.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI have learned that serving people is a privilege. My colleagues tell me I have a “servant’s heart.” It means a lot to me because I truly find joy in serving people. I love helping people because I know what it was like to be in a place where you really need help and someone to advocate for you. Being in SGA and serving as a leader is truly a privilege. I never want to take that for granted.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory as a leader or at Rowan in general?\n\nI have so many! When I was first elected as SGA president, I was so overcome with emotion because I was elected as the first Black female student body president. When I think about the unfortunate prejudices that Black women face in America, even in the classroom, we have to fight to be [seen] as leaders without being perceived as “bossy.” We can be assertive without being intimidating.\n\nOne of my favorite memories was getting the Rowan Wellness Fee passed and working with the Rowan administrators. Mental health is so important. As someone who has dealt with depression and anxiety throughout their life, I could finally take advantage of those resources last year. I’m really grateful for everyone who has put in the work to make the Rowan Wellness Fee possible so that students like myself can receive the help they need.\n\nI’m in such a great place in my life by going to therapy and other initiatives offered by the Wellness Center. I know that there is a taboo in talking about it, but I am very open because it has changed my life. I remember working with Scott Woodside, Director for the Wellness Center, who was very open and available to hearing student concerns. Seeing how the student body came together showed how strong the Rowan community is.\n\nWho inspires you and why?\n\nMy faith is really important to me as a Christian woman. I put that above anything else I do. I let it guide my steps. I find so much peace within it.\n\nWhat’s the most significant barrier to women today?\n\nBesides the institutional and systemic barriers, your mindset [can be a significant barrier.] We’re going to face a lot of barriers. It’s so easy to step down, to think small, to make ourselves “smaller,” or to make other people comfortable (especially men). I want us to think beyond that. Don’t make yourself smaller. Don’t worry about how you’re being perceived. Don’t worry about being “intimidating” or “bossy.” Don’t let your mindset keep you from achieving something great. It’s so easy to think negatively.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nYou are nothing without your team. I know it sounds controversial, but it’s true. People, unfortunately, only see how it benefits themselves and say “I’m doing everything.” But it really is a team effort and you need to see beyond yourself. You have to see how other people bring so many great skillsets and ideas to the table. You should encourage your team. Be mindful of your team. It’s not just about you.\n\nWhere do you see yourself in the future?\n\nHonestly, I do not know right now. Even though I’m not 100% certain about where I’ll be in the future, I can put my trust in God’s will and I find so much comfort in that. Even though there’s so much uncertainty about tomorrow, I find so much peace in God’s will and plan for my life.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nTRANSFERmation Tuesday: From North Jersey To Utah, Chemical Engineering Major Jacob Molinaro\n\nMeet Jacob Molinaro, a Chemical Engineering major with minors in both Math and Chemistry who transferred from the County College of Morris and is originally from Essex County, NJ. He is taking remote classes at Rowan from his current residence in Utah. He shares more about his decision in choosing Rowan and what he loves about South Jersey.\n\nWhat are your professional goals? And how is Rowan helping to support you in those goals?\n\nMy goal is to get my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and lead research in the field of renewable energy and energy storage. My time at Rowan has provided me with the educational background and experience to be competitive as I apply to my graduate programs and indirectly inspired me to follow this career path.\n\nAs a sophomore, my department head sent me an email encouraging me to apply to an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) program in Ohio. Following his advice, I applied and was admitted to the program and discovered my passions for both research and the field of electrochemistry.\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\nThe field of chemical engineering is extremely diverse, incorporating manufacturing, research and development and process design. Without chemical engineering, we would find many of the everyday products we use would be unavailable. I specifically would like to work in the growing field of renewable energy and energy storage, which is becoming increasingly important as we strive for more sustainable and ecologically friendly alternatives to fossil fuels.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major?\n\nExcellent chemistry teachers in high school (for both Honors Chemistry in 10th grade and AP Chemistry in 11th) fostered my interest for the subject, but I have always been more interested in applying chemistry to real-world problems rather than understanding the technicalities of it. Hence, I went into chemical engineering (applied chemistry).\n\nAs a student from North Jersey, how did you become aware of Rowan University?\n\nAt the time I applied, there were five strong chemical engineering programs in the state of New Jersey that my community college made me aware of. I applied to all of them, and upon being accepted to Rowan, I came to visit and loved it!\n\nHow long is your trip/drive “home” to North Jersey?\n\nThis is an amusing question. As the question is intended to be answered, it is two hours up the NJ Turnpike/Garden State Parkway to where I lived in Essex County from my apartment in Marlton. To go visit my parents in Pennsylvania is about three hours.\n\nHowever, at the moment my wife and I are living in Orem, Utah while I do all of my classes remotely. My wife, Kaitlin, is a travel nurse and is supporting a hospital here in Utah. Back to New Jersey from HERE is about 35 hours of driving.\n\nWhat are some of the benefits for you, living this distance from home?\n\nWhen I’m back in NJ it is nice to be close enough to my parents to go visit over the weekend and help out around the house, but far enough away that we’re not getting unexpected dinner guests every other evening while I need to be studying for an exam or my wife is getting home from a long shift at the hospital.\n\nHere in Utah, the largest benefits are by far the accessibility of my favorite hobbies. I’m a runner, climber, mountaineer and skier; the whole Salt Lake City area is absolutely amazing for these activities. In the past two weeks I’ve been to the climbing gym, two different ski resorts, been up two mountains, and been able to run and hike in between classes.\n\nBetween my own personal travels and moving around with Kaitlin’s travel nursing, I’ve been to 49 of the 50 states, and Utah is probably tied for second with Montana among my favorite states (only second to Wyoming!). Utah residents are also doing a great job with social distancing and mask-wearing, so COVID-19 cases are low here and places like the ski resorts and climbing gyms are able to stay open and operate at reduced capacity.\n\nWhat are a few interesting or new things (to you) about Rowan’s South Jersey area that you would share with future out-of-state students?\n\nAfter living in the “sixth borough on NYC” in Essex County, I’ve really appreciated that South Jersey is much more rural. If it hasn’t come across yet, I’m not at all a city person and really appreciate some good nature. The accessibility to different parks and preserves throughout the Pine Barrens has been really special. There’s also a great running community, some really awesome little towns (I work as a barista in Haddonfield and love it there, for example), and a bit more of a laid back feel than you’d be used to in North Jersey.\n\nWhat off-campus, local fun places do you recommend students check out?\n\nParallel to 322 and off of Delsea Drive there’s a really awesome bike path that runs about seven and a half miles to Sewell. That’s a fun ride/run, and I would definitely recommend students check it out. Duffield’s Farm Market in Sewell is a great place to visit in the fall for pumpkin picking and year-round for affordable fresh produce. It’s a bit of a drive, but I love the Black Run Preserve a bit north in Evesham Township.\n\nCloser to campus, Pitman is always worth a visit for great restaurants and a fun main street. Overall, I’d encourage any new students to just drive around and get to know both Glassboro and the surrounding towns. There’s a lot of neat stuff to be seen, regardless of whether you’re interested in getting outdoors or visiting a town.\n\nWhy did you choose to transfer to Rowan University?\n\nOf the three schools I was accepted for transfer to, Rowan was the most affordable (by a long shot!) and the most rural. I had spent two years at that point living in the extremely urban sections of northern New Jersey and was ready for a little farmland nearby!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nBianca Torres, senior music industry major\n\nHeader photo courtesy of:\n\nUnsplash\n\nWe are #RowanPROUD to be included on Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society’s 2021 Transfer Honor Roll, which recognizes select nationwide colleges and universities that foster dynamic pathways for transfer students.\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Gabrielle Magbalon, President of Rowan Philippine American Coalition\n\nToday we feature Gabrielle Magbalon, a leader at Rowan University.

[…]\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Photography Club President Jill Taylor\n\nToday we speak to Jill Taylor, president of the Photography Club. Jill is a junior Biological Sciences major with a concentration in Environmental Sciences and minors in Environmental Engineering and Chemistry. Jill is a first-generation college student and commutes to campus from Fortescue, NJ (Cumberland County).\n\nThis story is part of a series spotlighting campus leaders during Women’s History Month.\n\nWhat is your role in your organization? Briefly describe what your organization does.\n\nI am the president and founding member of Rowan’s Photography Club, which you can join by joining our Discord. You can also find us on Instagram @rowanphotoclub. I do a little bit of everything. I do a lot of the planning and delegating between Eboard members, general members and SGA, taking notes and planning future things, trying to see what the club can do in the future. The biggest thing I do is trying to encourage people to join or participate in the club.\n\nPhotography is so universal and is for everyone. We want to cultivate the photography and model and visual arts type of scene at Rowan because there is such an interest. We didn’t want to limit the club to just photographers, we also wanted to include models and graphic designers. At general meetings, we view and vote on photos submitted for the themed photography contests we have each week. Whoever won the previous contest picks the theme for the next contest. Sometimes we critique the photos and tell the photographers what they might do better next time. We have also been trying to integrate Kahoot and Jeopardy into our meetings so that our members can learn more about photography.\n\nWe have many beginners in our club, and we try to teach them as much as we can, help them figure out what they want to do and also be as inclusive as possible. One day, we will be able to all practice photography together.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI have learned that assuming responsibility is not always what you think it is. We have this idea of what a leader should be, which is someone who is in charge and tells us what to do dominantly. I think leadership requires a different approach, where you say what has to be done, but also are more flexible and empathetic, especially to be an outstanding leader that someone should look up to. I’ve seen too many more male people in positions of power with no emotional aspect of leadership and have toxic masculinity and sexism. Empathy is the most important thing, you can have all the power in the world if you don’t care about the people around you, it’s not worth it.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory as a leader or at Rowan in general?\n\nStarting the Photography Club and finding people who are just as passionate as I am is a great memory. There are people who trust me, even though I think I don’t know what I’m doing. The vibe is totally different.\n\nWho inspires you and why?\n\nI draw a lot of inspiration from many people and a lot of literature, but if I had to pick one person, it would be Barbara Dunkelman. She is a social media personality actor and model who pushes for empathy and a deeper understanding of each other and being a better person. She gives advice, and none of it is too serious. She discusses very serious topics, but she can throw in a terrible dad joke or keep it lighthearted.\n\nWhat’s the most significant barrier to women today?\n\nI think it’s the idea of what a woman should be. Women are often expected to be very effeminate and nurturing, and we can empower them until it comes to taking charge and having leadership roles. The characterization of women is very one-dimensional, especially in media and day-to-day conversations.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nI think you should be as compromising as you can until there is a topic where you don’t think you can yield and don’t be as open and as forthcoming with new ideas and advice from others. If there is something you refuse to budge on, don’t. Don’t put up with it. If it’s your belief, dig your heels into the ground and stand up for what you believe in, unless it has the potential to hurt other people. Hold up your boundaries, but also don’t be so closed off where you are hindering your own ideas.\n\nAs long as people are not waiting for the next person to just do something and they just do something themselves. Don’t put something off when you can do it and take charge, which is a scary leap of faith and a big jump. But if it’s something you want, just take it.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major and Rachel Rumsby, sophomore communication studies, and public relations double major\n\nPhotography by:\n\nStephanie Batista, sophomore music industry major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Kalie VanDewater, Editor-in-Chief of the Whit\n\nToday we feature Kalie VanDewater, a leader at Rowan University. Kalie is Editor-in-Chief (EIC) of Rowan’s newspaper, The Whit. She is a senior Journalism and Modern Languages and Linguistics double major with a minor in International Studies from Mount Holly, NJ (Burlington County). Kalie is also involved in the Rowan Environmental Action League and ASL Club.\n\nThis story is part of a series spotlighting campus leaders during Women’s History Month.\n\nWhat is your role in your organization?\n\nAs EIC of the Whit, I have a managerial role. I do a lot of coordination with the printer we work with, advertisers, and I usually write the editorial every week, and make sure all the other editors and writers know what they’re doing and answer any questions they might have.\n\nKalie also adds that when she first started working for the Whit her sophomore year, the staff was mostly male. In her three years there, she’s seen a trend in more diversity with race, gender and majors.\n\nCan you briefly describe what your organization does?\n\nWe’re basically the independent student newspaper on campus, so that means we are the source of news on campus. We cover events that are happening and general university happenings. We get to dictate what content we put out. We’re student-run, so we don’t have faculty influence aside from our advisor who is there to make sure things are running smoothly.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI’ve learned to trust the people that I’m leading with their capabilities. I tend to be very particular about what I want to do. I started last year as our features editor, I would have an image in my head about what I thought an article should turn out like, but I’m not writing the article, someone else is. I had to get used to trusting my staff. It’s been a lot of learning when to step in and when to take a step back and let everyone do their own thing. You can be a leader without having control all the time.\n\nWhat’s the most significant barrier to women today?\n\nIt’s that we don’t say what we feel. I feel like it’s kind of been internalized to just accept what is happening. It’s that feeling of if I don’t do what everyone else wants, I won’t be accepted. I think because of that, ideas and feelings that are completely valid may not be brought to light.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nBe confident in yourself and confident in your abilities. Specifically for leading, be confident in the people that you are leading. Know the strengths and weaknesses of your team. It’s important to know.\n\nCheck out Kalie’s work at The Whit here.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nCaitlyn Dickinson, senior public relations major and\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJoe Gentempo, senior art major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Roshni Gandhi, Advancing Outreach and Mentorship for Women Engineers\n\nToday we feature Roshni Gandhi, a leader at Rowan University. Roshni served as the President of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) during the 2019-2020 school year. She is from Old Bridge, NJ (Middlesex County) and is a senior Biomedical Engineering major. Roshni is part of the 3+4 BME/MD program with Cooper Medical School, where she completes her Biomedical Engineering degree in three years and then begins medical school for four years. Roshni is also the president of Alpha Epsilon Delta Pre-Health Society and was an SGA Representative of the Biomedical Engineering Society last year.\n\nThis story is part of a series spotlighting campus leaders during Women’s History Month.\n\nWhat is your role in your organization?\n\nI was the President of SWE during the 2019-2020 school year (we switched eboards at the beginning of this year). SWE is the Society of Women Engineers and is a professional development organization that helps foster a community between female engineering students and hosts career development events like networking opportunities with big industry partners and mentorship programs. This is very important because studies have shown that fostering connections like these are extremely important in retaining females (and minorities) in the STEM fields, and specifically engineering.\n\nWhat have you learned in your role as a leader?\n\nI am forever grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to serve as a leader for our Rowan community, as I genuinely believe it has helped me build my character and allowed me and my peers to work towards something we believe in and enjoy! I’ve learned how to adapt to new situations — especially with COVID and having to move to a virtual platform mid-semester, the importance of fostering connections and maintaining good relationships with those individuals, and most importantly I’ve learned that so many people are willing to help you bring your ideas to life or to further the mission of your organization, and for that I cannot thank them enough — whether it be faculty and staff at Rowan or people from industry and academia beyond our own university.\n\nWhat’s your favorite memory as a leader?\n\nMy favorite memory as a leader at Rowan has to be being able to help start new outreach programs through SWE and the College of Engineering. It’s really exciting to be a part of something new that will hopefully continue on over the next several years. Our new outreach program – The SWEET program, or Society of Women – Engineers Engineers in Training, is aimed at introducing middle school students to STEM and engineering and getting females interested in it from early on. Our first summer program is going to run virtually this summer, during the month of August. Our SWE team is really hopeful that we can make a positive impact on these young students and give them the confidence to pursue a career in STEM if that is what they’re interested in.\n\nWho inspires you and why?\n\nAs a student conducting research in Dr. Vega’s research lab, someone I look up to and am thankful to have as a mentor is my graduate student on the project, Kirstene Gultian, who is getting her Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. She accomplishes so much in the lab, while working as a teaching assistant, and helping with extra-curricular programs as well. She’s a strong leader within our lab, able to balance a number of different tasks at once, and always willing to help everyone.\n\nWhat’s the most significant barrier to women today?\n\nOne of the most significant barriers to women today is still representation of females in industry, in the workspace, and in leadership roles. Without the representation, so many women are not given the opportunity to hold leadership positions when compared to their male counterparts due to implicit biases. As such, I think our newest SWE program that we co-founded with PSEG during my time as president is really great in helping female engineering students make industry connections with successful female engineers already working in industry at PSEG.\n\nThe program offers mentorship (pairing of SWE students with PSEG mentors) and career advancement events for our SWE members. Through SWE’s international platform, we get to connect with women engineers from all across the world, who offer mentorship and other resources as well, and it is so inspiring to see how much they have and continue to accomplish.\n\nWhat advice would you give to the next generation of leaders?\n\nSomething I’ve learned during my leadership positions over the past few years is: Don’t be afraid to just ask! Sometimes you’ll have an idea that seems crazy or hard to organize and you won’t be sure how to make it come to life or if anyone will support you in making it happen, but lots of times if you just ask, you can make it happen!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nCaitlyn Dickinson, senior public relations major and\n\nMarian Suganob, senior public relations and advertising double major\n\nPhotos by:\n\nJabreeah Holmes, senior radio/TV/film major\n\nLeadership #PROFspective: Eliya Bravo, Inspiring Community Action and Change\n\nToday we feature first-generation college student Eliya Bravo, a leader at Rowan University.
