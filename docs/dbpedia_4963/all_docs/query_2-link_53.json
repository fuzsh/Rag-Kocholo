        "text": "\"I'm doing pretty well for an old lady,\" joked 80-year-old Las Vegas resident Deena Kaye Rose while speaking with The Tennessean early on a Monday morning in March.\n\nFor the past five decades, Rose has been an author, lecturer and Broadcast Music Inc. award-winning songwriter and vocalist with two top-20 Billboard country chart singles. Her songs have appeared in commercials for AT&T, Dodge, Pepsi and Ponderosa Steakhouse.\n\nBetween 1971-1983, while living off Dickerson Pike in North Nashville and primarily working around RCA Records' Studio A on Music Row, her career intersected with a who's who of legendary country music artists and songwriters, including Bobby Bare, Johnny Cash, Guy Clark, John Denver, Jerry Reed and Don Schlitz.\n\nAsk yourself, though. How many women were entrenched in country music's old boy's club to have achieved that acclaim without Country Music Hall of Fame-level renown in the midst of the genre's male dominated outlaw era? At the time, Rose, who often refers to her deadname, was writing and recording music as Dick Feller.\n\nShe came out publicly as a trans woman in her 2014 autobiography, \"Some Days Are Diamonds.\"\n\nAs Tennessee now grapples with weighty issues surrounding the trans community, Rose's story illustrates both that questions of quality and stigma are far from new -- and how far Nashville's music industry has come with respect to celebrating LGBTQ artists.\n\n\"...A common misperception was that trans folks are totally incapacitated by being transgender: that we have spent our pre-transition time hiding in dark places waiting for years so that our lives could actually begin,\" Rose said in a 2016 interview for the Hotel Chelsea blog Living with Legends. \"A male country music songwriter from Nashville...was not immune from being transgender. I did not choose transgenderism -- transgenderism chose me.\"\n\nA perpetually bittersweet, lucrative struggle\n\nThe intersection of civil rights and gender-identity issues with country music was on Bridgestone Arena during March 20's \"Love Rising\" concert. The event, organized by singer-songwriters Allison Russell and Jason Isbell, followed Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee's signing of bills banning gender-affirming health care and \"adult-oriented\" entertainment -- including \"male and female impersonators\" -- from public property.\n\nThe star-studded concert, which also featured performances from Sheryl Crow, Brittany Howard, Hozier, Maren Morris, Hayley Williams (and more than a few drag queens), raising more than $500,000 for LGBTQ+ causes in Tennessee.\n\nThe event's success made a statement about the power of the pro-LGBTQ movement on one of America's highest-grossing arena stages.\n\nA different yet equally powerful social moment -- one that has resonated for four decades to the tune of billions of dollars of commercial influence -- occurred in 1976.\n\nThe 1977-released \"East Bound and Down\" was penned by Reed and Rose, a Missouri-born singer-songwriter who had returned, \"creatively refreshed,\" to Nashville after spending time at New York City's iconic Lower West Side haunt, the Hotel Chelsea.\n\n\"On a scale of one to ten, it was about a minus two! But as inspiration, it was ten to the tenth power,\" Rose said in the 2016 interview about her time in the then notoriously dilapidated now historic monument in New York City.\n\nHow a country song celebrating the bawdy joys of masculinity emerges from a transgender woman raised on Woody Guthrie's folk and Bob Wills' Western swing but also sharing the same creative DNA as Leonard Cohen, Jimi Hendrix and the New York Dolls is fascinating.\n\n\"Individual writers wrote individual songs back then,\" Rose said. \"We were like F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein writing in Paris in the 1920s.\"\n\nBut in Nashville, she struggled with the social climate.\n\n\"The worst thing to do back then was to be transgender,\" Rose said. \"In that town, they'd forgive you for being a liberal, but to be transgender -- those desires had to lurk in the shadows. So in my songs, the women were always very well-dressed and 'Some Days Are Diamonds (Some Days are Stone)' [the song was cut by John Denver in 1981 and charted globally] is about [being transgender]. The diamonds are the precious girl things and the stones, well, that's an allusion to testicles.\"\n\n\"For years, I struggled with myself and prayed that one day I'd be magically 'cured' of my desires and be 'normal,\" Rose continued. \"But eventually, I discovered that 'Normal' was just a setting on a washing machine and a city in Illinois.\"\n\nRose still has an impeccable flair for language.\n\n'East Bound and Down' and cinema's macho, Western, late 70s era\n\nReed and Rose's \"East Bound and Down\" was written as a \"funny, upbeat song\" penned after the duo read the second draft of a \"hilarious\" screenplay. The manuscript what would become wealthy Hollywood stuntman Hal Needham's directorial debut: \"Smokey and The Bandit,\" starring Burt Reynolds, Sally Field and Reed himself.\n\nThe duo initially believed the story of two bootleggers and a runaway bride attempting to illicitly transport 400 cases of Coors beer 700 miles east from Texas to Georgia -- all while evading local authorities -- would be made into an animated movie about car chase stunts.\n\nThe film is par for the course for 1976. During that time, the film industry was plumbing deep into country and Western culture for economic salvation, as films like \"Smokey and the Bandit\" and (another Needham-directed film) \"Cannonball Run\" achieved popularity.\n\nIts success is predicated upon a proliferation of adolescent humor, alcohol, car crashes, cowboys, outlaw activities and sex.\n\n\"I'm both embarrassed by and proud of [the era],\" Rose laughed.\n\nBehind \"Star Wars,\" \"Smokey and the Bandit\" was 1977's second highest-grossing firm.\n\n\"I didn't make 'Smokey' for big-city audiences. I made it for the South, the Midwest, and the Northwest. Those are my people,\" stated Needham in an interview before his October 2013 passing.\n\nThe 1980 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am used in the film's 1980 sequel is currently enshrined in the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum.\n\n\"Burt gave Jerry the Trans Am,\" Rose said offhandedly. \"Jerry got so tired of people recognizing him behind the car's wheel that he let me drive it to run errands while he was working at his office. Of course, everyone just thought I was some jerk with a Burt Reynolds complex. Now, realizing where it is, I probably should've made a copy of the key.\"\n\nAn incredibly lucrative decade of business evolved from \"East Bound and Down's\" easily-replicable, note-perfect encapsulation of its aesthetic.\n\nFinally leaving town when 'everyone who would be pissed off...had died'\n\n\"I waited until everyone who would be pissed off that I was transitioning had died,\" Rose said about what kept her from transitioning long after her most successful Music City era.\n\nThere was no allure to cashing royalty checks while feeling gender-frustrated at songwriter nights at the Best Western and Commodore Lounge on Music Row at the turn of the 21st century.\n\nThus, Rose set off to queer-friendly locales like Seattle and performed -- while transitioning \"in stealth\" at venues there, singing a whole new set of songs.\n\nAn example of one of those new titles?\n\n\"I May Be A Drag Queen, Honey, But Honey, It's Never A Drag.\"\n\nFeeling renewed and fulfilled, Rose sold her house, got divorced, made peace with her daughter living in another country and put everything they owned in the backseat of her paid-off car (taking their male-presenting clothing to the Goodwill store on Gallatin Road in Madison).\n\nRose left town with exactly $1,002 remaining in cash to her name.\n\nShe bounced around much of the American West before settling in Las Vegas, where she's spent much of the past decade.\n\n\"They don't make you do very much here, but they let you do about anything,\" Rose said about life in Vegas.\n\nCiting the state's 2017 decision to offer a gender change and health addendum to its DMV forms as a \"wonderful\" development, she finds living in a place where \"knowing and being able to do [as she pleases] freely\" has \"unlocked the door to the rest of her life.\"\n\nRose's legacy\n\n\"Deena's career seeing a resurgence will absolutely open doors for other trans-singer-songwriters,\" said Swan Real, a Brooklyn-based indie rock performer and producer/engineer who, alongside her partner Mya Byrne, appeared onstage at March's \"Love Rising\" event.\n\nByrne is a folk and Americana singer-songwriter signed to independent label Kill Rock Stars whose recent credits include playing the mandolin and lap steel on LaFemmeBear's 2021-released remix of Reba McEntire's single \"I'm A Survivor,\" touring with the late Patrick Haggerty's groundbreaking queer country band Lavender Country and releasing \"Rhinestone Tomboy,\" a new album.\n\nByrne name-drops folk and rock artists like Cidny Bullens and Dave Carter (who passed in 2002) as artists who, alongside other gender non-conforming artists at \"Love Rising\" like Adeem the Artist and Joy Oladokun, represent the continuation of Rose's legacy.\n\n\"Deena's songs as thinly-veiled trans stories resonating in country music showcase how well the genre has always served our existence via the blatant use of plain language,\" says Byrne.\n\n\"Our stories deserve to be universalized because they ultimately have and always will, apply to everyone,\" adds Real. \"People seeing the inherent value in my art and humanity is great, but it should never have to be linked to [the things that transpired in Tennessee].\"\n\n\"Queer artists are now seeing themselves on more screens and stages than ever -- in an unprecedented way,\" Byrne said. \"People having the strength to be present in Tennessee, or anywhere and illustrating their authentic lives through beautiful stories can and will happen more often.\"\n\nRose is excited about the future but fully present in the struggles of the past.\n\n\"These are discouraging times,\" she said. \"Keeping demons alive allows people afraid of the present to feel safe. The body is just a vessel for the spirit.\"\n\n\"I'd imagine that some people will say, 'That song 'East Bound and Down' was written by a transgender woman.' I'd respond, 'What does one have to do with the other?'\""
