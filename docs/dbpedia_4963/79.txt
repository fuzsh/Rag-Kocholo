Mya Byrne crossed my radar a few months ago when I was putting together a show and suddenly realized that one of America’s best living songwriters had not only moved to my town – but she was also part of my queer family. And so began my love affair with the music of Mya Byrne. Blending folk, blues, and country together with songs that will make your heart soar and break all at once – she is an absolute rock star of a musician. Recently live she has started turning old gay disco songs into sweet queer country ballads – a trend I hope continues (and gets documented).

Here’s a little more info:

Recently relocated to San Francisco by way of NYC, Mya Byrne is a poet, award-winning performing songwriter, and activist. A proud trans woman, she established her solo folk-Americana career in 2012 after years of performing with roots-rock band, the Ramblers, opening for acts such as Levon Helm.

Mya’s been featured on many great festival and club stages across the country. Her first solo record hit #31 on the roots charts, and the follow-up, As I Am, is out now. Recently chosen as an Emerging Artist at the legendary Falcon Ridge Folk Festival, her music and poetry have also been featured in such media as SingOut!, The Advocate, Village Voice, New York Magazine, MSNBC, and CBS/Radio.com, with public speaking at institutions including SUNY and the UU.
