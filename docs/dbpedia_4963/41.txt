Mya says:

"I was struck by a moment at a reading I did for a queer magazine about ten days ago; one of the other readers said this line: "Even in your ordinary, there is something great." I was totally moved by this, and used the line in a quote. When I went to write my song yesterday, it was kicking around in my notes, and out this song came! I am crediting the writer, Yassine Senghor, for directly inspiring this song (and of course giving songwriting credit!). The repeated refrain of "this I know" was inspired by a translation of a Hebrew song I heard sung at a virtual Seder last week. Just thinking about the little things everyone does every day that we might not think about that give so much to the world. We are all doing great things, every moment! Love y'all."

Skipping Stones

In each day there little things you do

causing ripples in the waters that you’re wading through

Even if it’s just from skipping stones Em

somewhere someone feels them this I know

Somedays you may feel at a dead end

what if it’s the starting line where you start again

You may not be clear on where to go Em

you’ll find out in the journey, this I know

“Even in your ordinary, there is something great”

I’ve heard poets say G D It’s

all right to not understand what every moment shapes

Those answers may be many years away
