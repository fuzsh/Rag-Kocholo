        "text": "Home to Jason Aldean, Thompson Square & Dustin Lynch Signs 4x GRAMMY Nominee, ACM and CMA Award Winner Joe Nichols Plus Dynamic New Buzz Act Rachel Farley\n\nRed Bow Records Executive Staff Revealed\n\n(Nashville, TN – October 31, 2012) — Benny Brown, President/CEO of the BBR Music Group and Bob Morelli, President of RED Distribution, proudly announced today the formation of a new label partnership between BBR Music Group and RED Distribution. Based in Nashville, the newly minted RED BOW Records will be headquartered on Music Row with the BBR Music Group taking the lead in all creative and promotional endeavors for the new imprint.\n\nBBR Music Group and RED Distribution, a Division of Sony, first joined forces in May 2002 when RED became the official distributor for the independent Country label. At the time of the initial partnership, Broken Bow Records was a fledgling independent label of one. Today, the BBR Music Group has grown into the largest independent Country label group in the United States whose umbrella now includes Broken Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records, RED BOW Records, BBR Management and Magic Mustang Music Publishing. As an independent distributor, RED Distribution has grown alongside the BBR Music Group to become the leading independent music distributor in the U.S.\n\nThis past week the BBR Music Group and RED Distribution celebrated an industry milestone when Broken Bow Records’ superstar Jason Aldean celebrated his biggest first week of album sales to-date, with over 400,000 copies sold of Aldean’s new album, NIGHT TRAIN. Aldean’s NIGHT TRAIN first-week sales more than doubled the superstar’s first week sales of 2010 album, MY KINDA PARTY, which is quickly closing in on Triple Platinum sales status.\n\nBBR Music Group and RED Distribution’s additional collaborative milestones include the #1-selling Country single of 2011 with Thompson Square’s nearly Double-Platinum smash, “Are You Gonna Kiss Me Or Not” and the #1 debut of Dustin Lynch’s self-titled inaugural album, which made the rising star the only new male act to debut at #1 on the Billboard Country Album Chart in 2012.\n\n“We could have done this ourselves; however, we have a longstanding, trusted friendship and professional relationship with RED Distribution and RED President Bob Morelli,” says Benny Brown, President/ CEO of the BBR Music Group. “This new venture was a great way to further that relationship, which expands both our business models and creates new opportunities for both companies and for the artists on our labels.”\n\n“We are thrilled to be expanding our very successful relationship with Benny Brown and BBR Music Group through the launch of RED BOW Records,” says Bob Morelli, President RED Distribution. “Benny is a Nashville visionary and we are excited to be partnering with an executive of his tremendous talents and accomplishments on this new venture. This agreement further underscores RED’s ongoing commitment to supporting independent labels and artists with innovative distribution and artist development solutions.”\n\nAt an industry press conference earlier today in Nashville, Brown and Morelli unveiled RED BOW Records’ inaugural artist roster. On-hand to celebrate with the Music Row industry was 4x GRAMMY nominee as well as ACM and CMA Award winner Joe Nichols, who officially signed his record deal with RED BOW Records in front of the crowd. Nichols’ career to-date has produced four #1 singles, eight Top 10 singles and 2.2 million in album sales.\n\nAlso announced was hot newcomer and Country rocker Rachel Farley. The 17-year-old Georgia native has already made a name for herself on the road as one of Country’s hottest up-and-coming live acts. Farley has spent Summer and Fall 2012 opening for Broken Bow Records’ superstar Jason Aldean on his “My Kinda Party Tour.”\n\nAdditionally, BBR Music Group’s EVP Jon Loba and Sr. VP of Promotion Carson James announced radio promotion veteran Renee Leymon as the VP of Promotion for RED BOW Records. Most recently hailing from Arista Records, Leymon spent 12 years at Lyric Street Records, where she served the latter seven as the National Director of Promotion. Leymon’s previous endeavors include stints at New Revolution and at Bigger Picture Group. Leymon will be based in Nashville and can be reached at: renee@www.bbrmusicgroup.com and at 615-417-7484.\n\nCurrent Stoney Creek Records Southwest/ Midwest Manager of Promotion Shelley Hargis will take on the role of National Director of Promotion for RED BOW Records. Hargis’ industry experience includes stints at Midas Records and Epic/ Nashville. Hargis also spent four years as the Regional Promotion Director for Broken Bow Records prior to her previous three-year term at Stoney Creek. Hargis will be based in Nashville and can be reached at: shelley@www.bbrmusicgroup.com and at 615-429-2600.\n\nKendra Whitehead joins RED BOW Records as the West Coast Manager of Promotion. With over 20 years of experience in sales, marketing and promotion, Whitehead has spent the last 12 years in real estate, leading sales at companies including Century 21, the franchisor of the world’s largest residential real estate sales organization. Whitehead will be based in the Silicon Valley region of California and can be reached at: Kendra@www.bbrmusicgroup.com and at 408-316-2534.\n\nAdditional staff and artist announcements regarding the new label will be forthcoming.\n\nABOUT THE BBR MUSIC GROUP\n\nFounded by President/ CEO Benny Brown in 1997, the Broken Bow Music Group has grown from a fledgling independent label of one into the largest independent Country label group in the United States whose umbrella now includes Broken Bow Records, Stoney Creek Records, RED BOW Records, BBR Management and publishing company Magic Mustang Music.\n\nWith a roster of talented artists that includes multi-platinum superstar Jason Aldean, #1 chart-topper Dustin Lynch, American Idol’s Kristy Lee Cook and James Wesley, BROKEN BOW RECORDS continues to make a name for itself in the Country music industry. Founded in March 2009 as a continuation of the passion and determination that spawned the success of Broken Bow, STONEY CREEK RECORDS boasts a roster which includes 2012 ACM Vocal Duo of the Year, CMA and GRAMMY nominees Thompson Square, ACM and CMA nominee Randy Houser as well as newcomers Parmalee and Lindsay Ell.\n\nRED BOW RECORDS, in partnership with the country’s largest independent distributor RED Distribution, a Division of Sony, was founded in October 2012 with an initial artist roster of 4x GRAMMY nominee and CMA and ACM award winner Joe Nichols and hot Country newcomer Rachel Farley.\n\nThe Broken Bow Music Group is headquartered in Nashville, TN and is distributed by Sony RED.\n\nABOUT RED\n\nRED, an award-winning division of Sony Music Entertainment, headquartered in New York City, is widely recognized as the industry leader in music distribution and artist development.

Nichols was barely in his 20’s when he hit with his first #1 record 10 years ago, and since that first hit, he has continued to accumulate awards, accolades and more hits. With sales of more than 2.2 million albums to his credit, Joe boasts four #1 Hits and Eight Top 10 Singles, including chart-toppers like Brokenheartsville,” “Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off,” and “Gimmie That Girl.” Top Ten smashes include “The Impossible,” “If Nobody Believed In You,” “What’s A Guy Gotta Do,” “Size Matters,” and “I’ll Wait For You.”\n\nNichols has won every “best new artist” award available in the field of country music: the prestigious Horizon Award from the Country Music Association; Top New Male Vocalist from the Academy of Country Music and CMT Breakthrough Video of the Year, as well as New Artist awards from Billboard, Radio & Records and Music Row Magazine and a New York Times Best-Albums-of-the-Year nod. The artist’s consistent touring in the States, as well as Australia and Canada, has earned him legions of loyal fans. Nichols is also a spokesperson for Roper and has been featured in a series of print and radio campaigns for the product.\n\nABOUT RACHEL FARLEY\n\n17-year-old Georgia native Rachel Farley has already made a name for herself on the road as one of Country’s hottest up-and-coming live acts. Farley has spent Summer and Fall 2012 opening for Broken Bow Records’ superstar Jason Aldean on his “My Kinda Party Tour.” Her unique style of Country rock paired with her youthful vigor and an age-defying confidence on stage has made her one of Country music’s most-anticipated newcomers and “One to Watch” in 2013.\n\n# # #"
