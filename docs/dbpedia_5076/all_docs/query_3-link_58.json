Due to not having enough money, he promised she would go on the rooster after it would be established with funding from stockers. Soon after she would release the single for her first album Taylor Swift, called \"Tim McGraw\", which would peak at number 40 on Billboard's Hot 100.[8] In the next two years she would also release new singles for the album after it came out. Along with that, she would feature on Turbo Twang'n for the God Bless the Children project of the Nashville All-Star Choir.[9] To promote Taylor Swift, she would go on tour with label teammates Rascal Flatts and George Strait, where she would write her follow-up album.\n\n2008[]\n\nIn 2008 she would release another album, along with an EP and a promotional single for the AT&T Team USA Soundtrack. The album, entitled Fearless, was released in November of that year. Certified diamond in 2017, it was supported by the singles \"Love Story\" (8x platinum) and \"You Belong with Me\" (7x platinum). The EP was Beautiful Eyes, released in the months before in July, exclusively to Walmart stores in the United States and could also be bought online. It mainly featured renditions of her songs on Taylor Swift. It also featured a bonus track I Heart ?. The song Change was released that year, as previously mentioned, for the AT&T Team USA Soundtrack to support the United States Olympic team, and would become one of the main themes for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\n2009[]\n\nDespite not releasing any albums this year, she would feature on many tracks for soundtracks. She would continue to promote Fearless, adding more singles from the album like \"Superstar\". For the album Love Drunk by Boys Like Girls she would feature on a song called \"Two Is Better Than One\", certified platinum, and an official music video was released. Although she did not appear in it, her verses were still on track. Also, that year she would make a cameo in the Hannah Montana: The Movie, appearing alongside Hannah Montana (Miley Cyrus), and singing the song \"Crazier\". She would cover Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers song \"American Girl\", released digitally.\n\n2010s[]\n\n2010[]\n\nIn October 2010 she would release her third album Speak Now, which would be certified 4 times platinum. The album was written solely by Swift. Ten of the tracks would have a music video, then her most for any album. She would release 2 promotional singles, \"Today Was a Fairytale\" and the title track \"Speak Now\". Eight of the songs would later be certified gold. \"Half of My Heart\" was also released, featuring John Mayer, who she was then dating and was a single for his album Battle Studies.\n\n2011[]\n\nAfter going on tour for Speak Now in a few locations, she would release the Speak Now World Tour. Although it did feature mostly live performances from the album, it also included a mashup of the songs \"Back to December/Apologize/You're Not Sorry. Some covers were also included like the Train's \"Drops of Jupiter\", \"Bette Davis Eyes\" by Donna Weiss featuring Jackie DeShannon, and \"I Want You Back\" by the Jackson 5.\n\nMultiple songs off Speak Now would also be re-released as promotional singles and singles. A few days before the year ended, she would release \"Safe & Sound\", featuring the Civil Wars, for the soundtrack The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond, the official soundtrack for the 2012 movie The Hunger Games.\n\n2012[]\n\nIn 2012 she would release Red, now certified 8 times platinum worldwide, although it was last updated in 2014. She released a plethora of singles in preparation for it, including \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" which would hit number one on Billboard's Hot 100 after being number 72 the previous week it came out. This marked one of the biggest single-week jumps in the charts' history. Along with that there was \"Ronan\", dedicated to Maya Thompson's son who died of Neuroblastoma, \"Begin Again\", and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". Eyes Open was also released around the time, the second song off the Hunger Games soundtrack.\n\nThe song \"Both of Us\" (featuring B.o.B) was released for his second studio album Strange Clouds in May. After the conclusion and end location of the Speak Now World Tour, she agreed upon a remix of the song \"Long Live\" with Brazilian singer Paula Fernandes. It would receive a music video, and reached number 5 on Brazil's version of the Hot 100.\n\n2013[]\n\nAfter promoting Red by releasing more singles and going on tour, she would continue releasing songs elsewhere. \"Sweeter Than Fiction\" was released as a promotional single for the British film One Chance; and was written in co-produced with Jack Antonoff of the bands Bleachers and short-lived project Fun. This marked the first time they had ever worked together, and he would go on to be a regular collaborator with her, most notably in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore. She also released \"Highway Don't Care\" with Tim McGraw and Keith Urban for the former's album Two Lanes of Freedom. It peaked at number 22 on Billboard's Hot 100 and was certified three times platinum.\n\nExclusively in Germany in November, the Complete Album Collection was released. It was a box set containing all her then 5 albums, and one live tour album called Speak Now: World Tour Live\n\n2014[]\n\nWhile on tour midway she would write her fifth studio album 1989. This marked the change of her being a country artist to a pop superstar. In its first week it sold over one million copies, which was unusual amidst declining record sales in favor of streaming services like Spotify and iTunes. In Billboard's Year-End Top 200 albums it was number two and would be the second of the whole decade as well. It was supported by seven singles, the most of her career.\n\nThe first single \"Shake It Off\" was released in August and would become her biggest hit being her only song to be certified diamond. \"Blank Space\" was then released, accompanied by a music video which Shake It Off would later get, and became 8 times platinum. The other singles included three US top-ten entries.\n\n2015[]\n\nAfter releasing more singles like \"Style\" and the deluxe version of 1989 exclusively for Target in the United States and Canada, she embarked on the 1989 World Tour. Due to being busy with the tour, she did not release much music that year besides a remix of the song Bad Blood which featured Kendrick Lamar. The song peaked at number one, although having mixed reviews due to its repetition, and received a high-budget music video featuring many stars that were friends of hers.\n\n2016[]\n\nShe wrote the song \"Better Man\" for Little Big Town for their album Sugarland, and also featured on a song. This song was \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\", featuring Zayn Malik, and was written for the 2017 movie Fifty Shades Darker. After those songs she would go on a temporary hiatus, thanks in part to the Kanye West drama, fueled by Kim Kardashian. She was publicly exiled, and thus only came to receive awards.\n\n2017-18[]\n\nBefore leaving Big Machine Records, she would release a final album for her contract. This album was Reputation, mostly following the tabloid speculation around her life after the stated drama. It was supported by numerous singles, including \"Look What You Made Me Do\". The song broke multiple YouTube records and garnered over one billion views, which at the time was around the 50th video to do so. Other singles included \"...Ready for it\", \"End Game\", and \"New Year's Day\". The album itself sold over 4.5 million copies and would later be supported by a tour.\n\nImprints[]\n\nValory Music Co.
