        "text": "If you notice music on your artist profile from another band or artist of the same name, please help us correct the error with the following steps in your Amazon Music for Artists account:\n\nClick on the incorrect album/song\n\nClick on the three dot menu next to the title\n\nSelect “Report Issue”\n\nOnce the form is complete, click “Submit”\n\nOur catalog experts will investigate and resolve the issue as quickly as possible, please allow up to 4 weeks for the changes to reflect on Amazon Music.\n\nArtist names on Amazon Music can be incorrect for multiple reasons. The most popular being that an artist’s music is incorrectly merged with another artist with the same name. If this is the case, please let us know using the “Report Issue” tool in Amazon Music for Artists, under User Settings. You can use this tool even if you have not been able to successfully claim your artist profile in Amazon Music for Artists.\n\nAlternatively, if the music on your artist page is correct on Amazon Music, then it is possible that your artist name was delivered incorrectly. To update your artist name you’ll need to work with your label or distributor to make the requested changes and re-deliver to Amazon Music.\n\nIn the Amazon Music for Artists app, go to any album or song report page and click or tap the share link at the top of the page.\n\nIt’s easy to share from the Amazon Music streaming app, too. From any piece of content, simply open the three dot menu and select the share icon.\n\nPopular Songs and Popular Albums are influenced by customer interaction with your music. Popularity calculations consider both on-demand as well as lean-back listening, such as within playlists and stations. We recognize that listening habits vary between territories and service tiers, and as a result, what is shown as “popular” reflects listening specific to the customer’s territory and service tier.\n\nFor biography requests or corrections, please send an email to content.music@xperi.com and include in the subject line the words Amazon Music Bio Request or Amazon Music Bio Correction. For Bio Corrections, please highlight the artist name and any factual inaccuracies in the existing piece in addition to any new information you would like to see included. This will ensure your bio is accurate on all of the sites our data provider serves. We update bios regularly as we receive them from Xperi/TiVo.\n\nIf you see incorrect credits listed, please ask your record label or distributor to submit updated credit information. If you continue to see inaccurate or incomplete credits, or you feel a piece of Buzz content is incorrect, please contact us via the Amazon Music for Artists app.\n\nTo do so, log in, go to Settings > User Settings > Support and select “Other Issue.” For the quickest resolution, be sure to provide the following:\n\nArtist Name\n\nTrack Name\n\nURL to the track (either from within Amazon Music or the Amazon website)\n\nFan Polls give fans a way to express their passion—and knowledge—for their favorite artists within the Amazon Music app. Fans are able to cast their votes and see how they stack up with other fans. For example, a poll may ask “Who’s your favorite Beatle?” or “What’s your favorite Taylor Swift era?” New polls will appear periodically in the Amazon Music app while customers are listening to music.\n\nPolls will appear in the Amazon Music app on iOS and Android while listening to music by an artist who has an active poll. Any Amazon Music customer on any subscription tier, worldwide, can view and vote in polls. To view a poll, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the latest version of the Amazon Music app on iOS or Android.\n\nPlay a track by any of the most popular artists.\n\n2. Tap the “X-Ray” button.\n\n3. You can also wait for X-Ray to appear automatically after several seconds.\n\n4. Tap the poll preview screen to view the poll choices and cast your vote.\n\nYou have two options: You can ship your items to an Amazon Fulfillment Center and have Amazon manage all post-sale operations. Or, if you have storage and shipping systems you trust in place or prefer to handle post-sale operations yourself, you can opt to self-fulfill. Learn about how to become a seller on Amazon here.\n\nIf you believe that an item available for sale on Amazon contains content that is infringing on your intellectual property, report it to Amazon using the proper online form (US, UK, DE). We encourage rights owners who have concerns regarding the misuse of their intellectual property to notify us using the Report a Violation tool in Amazon Brand Registry. If you’re not enrolled in Brand Registry, Amazon provides a publicly available form for reporting alleged intellectual property infringements such as copyright, trademark, and patent concerns.\n\nStep 1: Log in to the Amazon Music for Artists app to add your merch to Amazon Music\n\nStep 2: Add Amazon Music to your Bandsintown for Artists profile\n\nWhen you add Amazon Music to the links in your Bandsintown artist page, you will add both a listening link and your merch, exactly as it appears on your Amazon Music artist page.\n\nAmazon Music is not only one of the largest on-demand streaming music platforms with 68 million global customers and growing rapidly, but also has the largest catalog of ad-free top podcasts. It is also tightly integrated with the Alexa ecosystem, delivering a best in class experience for smart speaker users. For content creators, enabling your content to be distributed on Amazon Music allows you to grow your audience by reaching these customers, many of whom will be new to podcasting.\n\nOnce you have submitted your podcast, please allow up to 24 hours for your show to become listed. The best way to know if your podcast is available is to search for your show on Amazon Music. If you’re not finding your podcast & you submitted more than 24 hours ago, please reach out to our Amazon Music Podcast Team at podcasters@amazon.com"
