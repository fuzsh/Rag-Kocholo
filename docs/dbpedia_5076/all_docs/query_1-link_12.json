        "text": "Big Loud Records, the Nashville-based independent label that houses country music juggernauts like Morgan Wallen, HARDY, and ERNEST, has announced a major shift in its distribution strategy.\n\nThe label has signed a multi-year distribution deal with Mercury Records/Republic, streamlining its distribution channels by bringing all Big Loud releases under the Mercury Records/Republic umbrella, news outlets including Billboard reported, citing a memo to staff.\n\nPreviously, Big Loud utilized Stem and Amped for the distribution of its independent releases. Records from a select few Big Loud artists including Morgan Wallen, Lily Rose, and Dylan Gossett, were separately distributed through Big Loudâs licensing partnership with Mercury/Republic.\n\nBig Loud is an investor in Stem.\n\nWallen’s 2021 Dangerous: The Double Album was distributed through the Mercury/Republic partnership, as was 2023’s One Thing At A Time.\n\nWallen was named Songwriter of the Year at the 2023 BMI Country Awards. His third studio album, One Thing At A Time, broke the 30-year record for most weeks atop the Billboard 200 chart for a country album, making it Luminateâs Top Album of 2023 in the US. His track, Last Night, was the top song on Apple Music globally in 2023.\n\nWallen signed a global publishing deal with Warner Chappell Music last month.\n\nâAfter many incredible years with Stem and Amped we have decided to enter into a new multi-year distribution deal with Mercury Records/Republic.”\n\nSeth England, Craig Wiseman and Joey Moi, Big Loud Records\n\nThe new deal between Big Loud and Mercury Records/Republic deepens the existing partnership between the two companies.\n\nâAfter many incredible years with Stem and Amped we have decided to enter into a new multi-year distribution deal with Mercury Records/Republic, amplifying our existing partnership with Monte & Avery Lipman as well as Tyler Arnold and the greater Mercury Records/Republic team,â said Big Loud founders/partners Seth England, Craig Wiseman and Joey Moi in the memo cited by Billboard.\n\nThe partnership, according to the Big Loud team, allows the company to remain independent, while taking advantage of Mercury Records and Republicâs global distribution and resources âto best serve our world-class roster.”\n\nâArtists and our staff will see increased creative opportunities, robust international support, new multimedia partnerships, additional multi-format promotion muscle and merchandising resources, among many other benefits,” the memo stated.\n\nâArtists and our staff will see increased creative opportunities, robust international support, new multimedia partnerships, additional multi-format promotion muscle and merchandising resources, among many other benefits.â\n\nSeth England, Craig Wiseman and Joey Moi, Big Loud Records\n\nBig Loud emphasized their independence in the memo, stressing that the company âhas not been acquired in any way. Our full staff will remain intact and will continue to lead with the artists we represent.â\n\nThe memo added: âWe are immensely grateful for the tireless efforts of Milana, Kristin, Bobby, Alison, and the entire team at both Stem and Amped who have supported our releases for the better half of a decade.Â\n\n“Both teams have been an integral part of our growth story and remain a highly recommended distribution and artist resources solution for self-determined artists and companies. We remain proud investors of Stem to this day.”\n\nThe financial details of the agreement between Big Loud and Mercury Records/Republic were not disclosed.\n\nThis news comes amid a major restructuring at Universal Music Group, the parent company of both Mercury and Republic. The company’s East Coast labels are realigning under a new structure called Republic Corps, led by chairman/CEO Monte Lipman.\n\nMercury Records will be run by Tyler Arnold as President and Ben Adelson as General Manager, while Republic Records will be led by Wendy Goldstein as President and Chief Creative Officer.\n\nMusic Business Worldwide"
