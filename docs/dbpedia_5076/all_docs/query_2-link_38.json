        "text": "The outcome of Universal's standoff with TikTok bears similarities to the Hollywood Writers' Strike. The standoff will highlight which party is more affected and the duration each can endure the situation. Does music have such a massive impact on TikTok users that it will impact user growth or encourage users to go to a TikTok competitor that can offer the music they want? Or will this move hurt UMG artists and their affiliated artists more because TikTok is a major music discovery tool?\n\nThe day before UMG's contract with TikTok expired, the largest music label in the world published a letter announcing it would be removing its entire catalog from TikTok. This means, according to TikTok, videos that include or mimic Universal content were muted.\n\nAs described in an open letter by UMG, this move stemmed from a failure to reach an agreement on three critical issues: fair compensation for artists and songwriters, protecting human artists from the adverse effects of AI, and ensuring online safety for TikTok’s users. In a swift response, TikTok accused UMG of prioritizing 'their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters,' underscoring their decision to abandon what TikTok considered a valuable promotional and discovery tool for talent. UMG later emphasized TikTok’s 'woefully outdated view' that artists should be grateful for 'free promotion' and that expecting fair compensation for artists and songwriters is driven by greed.\n\nIt is worth noting that TikTok is used very differently than other music services like YouTube and Spotify. TikTok is not a passive listening experience; it allows you to create content and engage with music in an immersive way. From UMG's perspective, their music catalog powers a massive portion of TikTok videos, yet the compensation from TikTok is significantly lower than that of other platforms, where more passive listening takes place. Unlike YouTube and Spotify, TikTok’s primary business model does not revolve around music, which could lower their incentive to negotiate with major labels. However, TikTok's new music streaming service indicates an increasing reliance on major labels for licensing their music.\n\nIt can be argued that it's critical for UMG, as the industry leader, to draw a line in the sand with TikTok, reinforcing the need for fair payment to artists and songwriters. Echoing the early days of negotiations between YouTube and major labels over a decade ago, these discussions have led to the creation of content ID systems and increased compensation for creators. Similar to YouTube negotiations, one way that this could play out is TikTok being compelled to generate ad revenue in addition to offering compensatory remuneration to creators.\n\nThe impact of UMG’s decision can be viewed from several perspectives including independent and major label rights holders, as well as developing artists and the top 10% of performers. Each perspective exists in a different environment defined by distribution as well as access to data, promotion and financial resources.\n\nThese negotiations bring attention to the value of promotion and where major labels have chosen to pick their battles. Unlike radio, which plays an entire song and is also considered a promotional vehicle, TikTok only uses fractional elements of a song. The United States, alongside North Korea, Iran, and China, ranks among the four developed countries that do not mandate traditional performance royalties for radio sound recordings. From an independent music rights holder's perspective, a push for fair compensation from radio would be worth taking a stand for as well.\n\nFrom an independent perspective, the removal of UMG's content could ironically open new doors for independent artists, potentially making room for their discovery on platforms like TikTok.\n\nUMG’s unilateral decision without consent from affiliates to remove their content, also removed the content of any independent label that distributes through Universal – presenting a potentially turbulent situation for those affiliated.\n\nNegotiations between major labels and streaming platforms like Spotify have historically lacked transparency, especially regarding how much of the label’s catalog of artists benefit financially in a meaningful way from these negotiations. For the artists who are benefiting, what percentage of their overall compensation is being increased from these deals. If I were a developing artist signed to UMG, I would be asking myself, is it financially worth it for my content to be removed from TikTok or is the lack of exposure impacting my chances for success?\n\nTikTok's role in music discovery is undeniably significant, yet it only bridges artists halfway to their ultimate goals. In a world where one stream transaction is equivalent to $0.003 on Spotify, rights holders need data and tools to convert these newly discovered listeners into superfans that generate revenue across tickets, merchandise, and vinyl. Compared to Spotify For Artists’ Data Dashboards, TikTok does not provide the type of information needed about who is engaging with their content in an actionable way. According to a recent Music Business Worldwide interview with the Global Head of Music Business Development, Ole Obermann, his long term goal is to, “build a music ecosystem where discovery, promotion, engagement, consumption, merch, tickets, live streaming, all those things can happen.” This is undoubtedly beneficial, yet the question arises: How many ecosystems must an artist navigate to earn a livelihood? The discussion shifts towards the importance of autonomy over their data, enabling artists to utilize it effectively to generate income across various ancillary revenue streams, irrespective of the platform.\n\nThe impact of UMG withdrawal from TikTok presents an poignant question. Some of the biggest names in music are signed to Universal, including Taylor Swift, Rihanna and Justin Bieber. If consumers cannot find the music they want at all on TikTok, would consumers adjust their behavior and go somewhere else? Would Meta’s services like Reels or Threads provide a viable alternative? Not only is the quality of music expanding on these platforms but remuneration to uploaders is also increasing.\n\nThe standoff between Universal Music Group (UMG) and TikTok, highlighting the complexities of music rights and artist compensation in the digital age, underscores the evolving relationship between music labels, streaming platforms, and the creators they represent. As this dispute unfolds, it serves as a critical moment for the industry, potentially reshaping how music is distributed, consumed, and valued, with far-reaching implications for artists, labels, and platforms alike."
