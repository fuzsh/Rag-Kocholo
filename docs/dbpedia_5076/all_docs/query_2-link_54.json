        "text": "Bill Ackman’s pitch for his bet on Universal Music Group NV in 2021 could have come straight from the trailer of a music biopic: “You need food and water to live, but music comes next.” There’s merit in his argument: Even in our conflict-ridden and economically uncertain times, UMG artist Taylor Swift’s current tour has broken the billion-dollar mark, music-streaming services have attracted more than 500 million paying subscribers, annual vinyl sales are growing at double digits and shares of Spotify Technology SA are defying wider market turmoil.\n\nBut much like that other staple of the music biopic, the cigar-chomping Record Company Man (and it is typically a man) who confidently tells the hero their best-known song is destined to flop, Ackman’s not entirely right either. Streaming growth is slowing as pandemic effects fade and price hikes take effect, and major labels’ grip on an increasingly competitive sonic landscape is slipping: UMG’s slower-than-expected growth has battered its shares, and the value of Ackman’s 10.3% stake, with Warner Music Group Corp. also falling ahead of its results this week. Music may be timeless — but a reinvention for the industry is overdue."
