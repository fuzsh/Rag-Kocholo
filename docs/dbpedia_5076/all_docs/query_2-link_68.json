        "text": "Starting Thursday, the sounds on TikTok have gotten a little quieter. That’s because Universal Music Group has removed its catalog from the video-sharing app after the massive music company failed to reach a licensing agreement with TikTok. Taylor Swift, Drake, Ariana Grande, and Billie Eilish are just a few of the major artists on the label whose music has begun to disappear.\n\nOn TikTok, creators often add short song clips to their videos to participate in viral trends and make the content more engaging. Not only will users now be unable to make new videos with official snippets from UMG artists, previously published videos that contain music from the pulled catalog have gone silent, accompanied by notices like “Sound removed due to copyright restrictions.” UMG’s catalog includes everyone from BTS to the Beatles, and any video featuring their songs could be affected.\n\nUMG released a statement Tuesday, the day before its contract with TikTok expired, claiming that renewal negotiations fell apart due to disagreements over artist compensation, artificial intelligence protections, and platform safety. The statement’s wording characterizes TikTok as a bully. “How did it try to intimidate us?” it reads. “By selectively removing the music of certain of our developing artists, while keeping on the platform our audience-driving global stars.” It’s unclear which smaller artists at UMG may have been affected before the deal lapsed and the wider song prohibition rolled out.\n\nTikTok responded to the announcement with a similarly charged, albeit shorter, statement calling UMG greedy and deceptive. “Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent,” it reads. TikTok’s influence over the music industry has expanded in recent years as artists (and their labels) attempt to break through the platform’s cryptic algorithm. A stand-alone app for streaming songs, called TikTok Music, is currently in beta for certain international markets.\n\nAs generative AI tools improve, songs featuring AI vocals or other structural elements continue to spread on social media. UMG’s statement claims TikTok promotes the creation of AI music and that the contract TikTok wants “is nothing short of sponsoring artist replacement by AI.” This is not the first time UMG has taken issue with machine learning. The label filed a lawsuit last October against Anthropic, a chatbot company, regarding how Anthropic’s AI model may use copyrighted lyrics from UMG artists.\n\nUpdated: 2/1/2024, 8:32 am EST: Universal Music Group has officially pulled its catalog from TikTok.\n\nSix-Word Sci-Fi: Stories Written by You\n\nHere's this month's prompt, how to submit, and an illustrated archive of past favorites.\n\nEminem’s New Album Prompted Gen X to Declare a TikTok ‘War’ on Gen Z\n\nThe release of Eminem’s new album The Death of Slim Shady has led to a series of viral shitposts from Gen X. Their targets, Gen Z, remain unbothered.\n\nAI Is Already Taking Jobs in the Video Game Industry\n\nA WIRED investigation finds that major players like Activision Blizzard, which recently laid off scores of workers, are using generative AI for game development.\n\nPeople Are Big Mad About the House of the Dragon Season 2 Finale\n\n“Did I just watch a 70 minute trailer for Season 3?” is just one of the reactions fans have posted online about the season's \"disappointing and poorly executed\" closer.\n\nKamala Harris and the Paradox of Progress\n\nThe vice president's political theater is inspiring raucous reactions and online goodwill—but it's also already showing cracks, and obscuring the harsher realities of America.\n\nThe Week of Brat Summer Will Go Down in Internet History\n\nAfter Charli XCX declared that Vice President Kamala Harris “IS brat,” nothing was the same.\n\nThe Real Problem With TikTok’s ‘Fruity’ Boy Trend\n\nOn TikTok and X, the “fruity” boyfriend has become a hot topic. But the trend exposes the real issues that arise when dating apps reduce everyone to an archetype.\n\nFortnite Has a Political Violence Problem\n\nIn a report shared exclusively with WIRED, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism says it found more than a dozen user-generated games on Fortnite that featured antisemitism and political violence."
