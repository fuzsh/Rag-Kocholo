        "text": "Author: Caleb J. Murphy\n\nCaleb J. Murphy is a songwriter/producer based in Richmond, VA, whose music has been on ABC, NBC, NPR, and in hundreds of indie film projects. His advice for musicians has been featured by Digital Music News, Bandzoogle, BMI, and ASCAP. He also sends a twice-monthly newsletter called 5 Things To Help You Keep Going that features five resources from the internet that will help indie musicians.\n\nFULL BIO\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the industry started shifting from physical formats (CDs, vinyl) to digital downloads, and then eventually to streaming.\n\nThe rise of streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal has fundamentally changed how people listen to music. These platforms offer pretty much any song you could ever want for a relatively small monthly fee.\n\nLabels could no longer rely on CD sales and had to focus on optimizing streaming revenue. Physical album sales have significantly declined, making up a smaller portion of total revenue. Streaming has become the dominant source of income for record labels, even though the payout per stream is much lower than traditional album sales.\n\nBecause of this, labels have focused more on diversifying their revenue streams. Many labels have started offering 360 deals, where they take a share of an artist’s earnings (sometimes for a set amount of time) in exchange for financial and promotional help. This is different from the traditional method of owning the masters of the artist’s songs.\n\nOn top of that, labels are more often offering shorter and more flexible contracts to artists. Labels are more cautious, often signing artists for fewer albums or even single releases to mitigate risk.\n\nThis is all in the wake of more artists choosing to go or stay independent. Because of social media and fan subscription models, many artists have been able to earn more money as an indie than they would on a label because they keep all or most of the earnings.\n\nHow do I get my music heard by record labels?\n\nCaleb J. Murphy (CareersInMusic)\n\nBefore you contact a record label with your music, you need to prepare well. The first and most important step is to ensure your music is high quality and at industry standards. Then write a bio that shows who you are, what your music sounds like, and what you’ve accomplished. Next, do your research on whom to contact and what the record label’s submission guidelines are, and only submit to labels that want your type of music. Then put all of this info on a page on your website (this is called an Electronic Press Kit) so the label can easily access all of this info.\n\nBecause artists don’t need labels like they used to, this has led to major labels rethinking what their role and function is for the artist. They used to be the gatekeepers. They used to decide who would even get heard or not.\n\nBut nowadays, labels are no longer the gatekeepers. So what’s the point of a label?\n\nIn the past, Artist and Repertoire (A&R) departments were invested in their artists. They’re typically responsible for scouting and developing talent. Now, they rely heavily on data and analytics from streaming services and social media to identify potential hits.\n\nLabels have adapted to new marketing techniques, focusing heavily on digital marketing, social media campaigns, and influencer partnerships.\n\nThere’s also a greater focus on creating a wide range of content, like short-form content for social media. Labels also invest in owning the intellectual property of these contents.\n\nHow do record labels find artists?\n\nCaleb J. Murphy (CareersInMusic)\n\nWhen an artist goes viral, has success on streaming, has a large online following, and/or can put on an undeniably great live show, that’s when record labels take notice.\n\nWithout a label taking a significant cut, you can keep a larger percentage of your earnings as an indie artist, if not all of the earnings. You also would own all your recordings and control the rights as well.\n\nBy owning your music and maintaining control over your career, you would have the potential to build significant long-term financial equity. You can earn a larger share (or all) of royalties and other income streams over time, leading to potentially higher lifetime earnings.\n\nRecord labels often have a specific timeline for releasing a single or an album and they may have certain strategic ideas that may not line up with the artist’s. Also, they manage multiple artists and may not want to release albums to close together.\n\nBut as an indie artist, you can release music whenever you want. You can also quickly change plans if you need to and not have to answer to anyone else. You even have control over what deals you sign, whether with a label or publisher or whomever. For example, you could sign a small, one-off deal for one of your songs as a test.\n\nAlong with this, you also have more room to experiment, not just musically but also with your marketing and distribution.\n\nLet’s say you’ve looked at the benefits of both signing a record label deal and staying independent and you’ve decided you want to partner with a label.\n\nThis is not legal advice – you should review any record label deal with a music lawyer. But here are some factors to consider before you sign…\n\nHow do I reach out to record labels?\n\nCaleb J. Murphy (CareersInMusic)\n\nSimply visit a label’s website, find their contact info, and send them a professional email that includes a link to your Electronic Press Kit (EPK). Sometimes, labels even state if they’re accepting submissions or not.\n\nMake sure you know who will own the master recordings. Ideally, you should aim to keep ownership or at least negotiate a reversion clause where ownership returns to you after a certain period.\n\nThis is the same with the publishing (songwriter) rights. Pretty much 100% of the time, a label should not be trying to take ownership of your songs. They can handle the publishing – registration, collection, and paying out royalties – but make sure you keep your songwriter rights. Consider asking for a reversion clause on the publishing side too.\n\nClarify the handling of your songwriting and publishing rights. Retaining your publishing rights is beneficial, but if you must give them up, ensure the terms are favorable.\n\nKnow what an advance is – basically, a loan you have to repay the label through your earnings. Know what the recoupment process is – through what revenue streams the label wants to get the advance back.\n\nYou’ll want to see the royalty percentage you’ll receive from sales and streams. A fair rate for new artists typically ranges between 15-20% of net sales. Along with this, make note of what expenses (marketing, recording, touring) will be deducted from your royalties and make sure they’re reasonable and transparent.\n\nWhat does this label deal do for you? How will it help your career move forward? Make sure the exchange is fair.\n\nThey should be helping you with marketing, promotion, tour support, financial support for making new music, and connecting you with other artists and songwriters on the label.\n\nMake sure the label will give you regular, transparent accounting and royalty statements. Also, something many artists don’t think about: make sure you have the right to audit the label’s records to ensure you’re being paid accurately.\n\nUnderstand under what conditions either party can terminate the contract. Favorable clauses will let you exit the deal if certain benchmarks (e.g., minimum sales or promotional efforts) are not met.\n\nRecord labels are mainly only interested when they see some success already. The big labels are no longer as interested in developing unknown artists as they used to be. They want to know an artist can make money before they partner with them. Then, ideally, they can help that artist elevate their career to the next level.\n\nSo your success as a career artist shouldn’t hinge on getting a record label deal. You should build your career assuming you’ll never get a record deal. Then, when labels do show interest, you have more negotiating power and can decide if the label offer will help your career.\n\nWith the rise of short-form content on social media, virality has become a much more common thing, and record labels look for it. When an artist goes viral for their music, that means they then have a huge fanbase that will stream their music, buy their merch, go to their shows, and companies that may want to offer brand or sponsorship deals. And that’s appealing to labels. If you’re already making money from your music, a label will want in. And in exchange, they will promise to elevate your career to the next level.\n\nAlthough streaming payouts are very low (and arguably unfair), you can still make decent money from streaming. If you get enough exposure to your music, all of the streams add up to a chunk of money, sometimes enough that you can live off that income alone. And if you get to that level, you will probably have record labels contacting you. They see financial success and they want to be a part of it.\n\nThe best way to find a record label to partner with is to see what labels similar artists are signed to. Find your favorite small- to mid-sized artists, see what label they’re signed to, and then submit your music to that label.\n\nTo get you started, here are some record labels that are currently looking for artists:\n\nAtlantic via Emerge (pop, R&B)\n\nBabygrande (hip-hop, indie, EDM)\n\nCaptured Tracks (indie, post-punk)\n\nCentury Media (hardcore, metal, hard rock)\n\nDim Mak (electronic, punk, indie, hip-hop)\n\nDomino (indie)\n\nEpitaph (punk, emo)\n\nGlassnote (indie, hip-hop)\n\nMute Records (indie, post-punk, electronic)\n\nNuclear Blast (metal)\n\nRed Bull (alternative, hip-hop)\n\nRevolver (all genres)\n\nStones Throw (hip-hop, soul, electronic)\n\nSub Pop (indie)\n\nUniversal Music Group via Spinnup (all genres)"
