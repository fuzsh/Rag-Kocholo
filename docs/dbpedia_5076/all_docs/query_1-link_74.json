        "text": "What is Proton SoundSystem?\n\nProton SoundSystem is used by over 1200 independent music labels to manage, distribute, and promote their releases. For a sample of the top labels running on SoundSystem, check our roster.\n\nWhat does it do?\n\nProton SoundSystem provides you with an easy to use interface to upload and manage your labelâs releases. It also manages the signing of tracks by digitally dispatching contracts and tracking their approval. Easy! You can even use our new compilation tool to re-release tracks from your back catalog without needing to re-upload WAVs or re-sign contracts.\n\nIt then distributes your release quickly to stores and services like Beatport and Spotify. (See the full list below.) Sales reports are processed from the stores and royalty statements are automatically generated for you and your artists so you get paid reliably and directly every time.\n\nAs your label and artists grow, youâll be eligible for features and shows on Proton Radio, for premieres on our SoundCloud with 12K fans, or featured charts on our Facebook page with 30K followers. A promo pool for your label can also be setup at InFlyte and receive special discounts over 50% off!\n\nWhat stores and services does Proton work with?\n\niTunes / Apple Music\n\nSpotify\n\nBeatport\n\nSoundCloud\n\nMixCloud\n\nFacebook\n\nYouTube Content ID / YouTube Music\n\nPandora\n\nTidal\n\nGoogle Play\n\nDeezer\n\nShazam\n\nWhat People Play\n\nTraxSource\n\nJuno\n\nTencent, Alibaba, and NetEase (China)\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nThere are no upfront or recurring fees. If you choose to run your label with SoundSystem, Proton takes a 30% commission of sales on your label. The remaining 70% of sales are assigned for you to delegate to yourself or to other artists and collaborators on the release.\n\nIs selling at Beatport better with SoundSystem?\n\nYes. Proton SoundSystemâs direct deal with Beatport is the best in the industry. You earn the highest possible payout from Beatport. Earn +10% in mechanical royalties â normally withheld from labels and distributors â plus earn +5% as an exclusive label.\n\nYou also get daily sales reports from Beatport for all your tracks and releases. No more waiting 3 to 4 months for a statement. Access the number of followers your label and artists currently have on Beatport to help promotion, plus you can update artist profiles on Beatport with new photos and bios.\n\nProton can work with your label on strategies to get you features at Beatport â each week more than 60 labels using SoundSystem are featured. We have a strong track record and relationship with Beatport because we do things right.\n\nMake a mistake on something? Proton helps get it fixed quickly.\n\nHow much control do I have of my label?\n\nYou have complete control and total creative freedom. You can sign any tracks you want and organize releases however you want as long as any samples used are cleared. We can help you reach artists inside the Proton community and weâll never discourage you from releasing what you want.\n\nHow often do I need to release music? How much do I need to sell?\n\nYou can release music once a week or once a decade. There are no sales or schedule requirements for labels running on SoundSystem.\n\nMy release is ready. How fast can Proton release it?\n\nProton ships new releases to Beatport (and beyond) on the Sunday 2 full weeks prior to release. If itâs an emergency, we can help you release faster than that. Minimize your chances of a technical problem and increase your chances of support on Beatport by scheduling releases a minimum of 2 weeks in advance.\n\nIs dealing with contracts hard and complicated?\n\nNot at all. You can automatically generate contracts for your label using the website and easily send them to your artists via email, who can then approve them digitally without any hassle.\n\nDo I have to send payments and statements myself?\n\nNope! Itâs automatic. SoundSystem generates statements for artists and label managers every quarter. Anyone with a balance over $10 gets a statement via email. Anyone with a balance over $100 gets a payment via PayPal. If PayPal is not available for someone, then Proton can make a payment via Western Union. Royalty statements are available at any time to users on the SoundSystem website.\n\nHow do I set up royalty rates?\n\nAs the label manager you control the royalty rates for every track on every release. On SoundSystem you can easily set royalty rates for each song before sending out contracts. Assign royalties to yourself, your original and remix artists, and even graphic designers and mastering engineers. Royalties work on a track level so you can enter different royalty rates for every track on your release. If the artist is a group or a band then each member will receive a contract and an equal share of the royalties you enter for them.\n\nHow is licensing handled to 3rd party labels or compilations?\n\nMoney that comes in through a 3rd party license is split according to the royalty rates everyone has already determined for that track. This means Proton would take 30% of a license fee and distribute the remainder of the license according to the royalty percents you assigned to yourself or the artists. We will notify you before proceeding with any 3rd party license and we usually ask for a 200 to 300 Euro advance. If a label reaches you directly, youâre free to handle the deal yourself and Proton will not take any percentage of the royalties or licensing that results from the deal, but youâll be responsible for paying your artists their share.\n\nHow is cover art or mastering handled for my releases?\n\nProton can introduce you to the mastering engineers and graphic designers currently working with us. Some designers or engineers require upfront fees while others request a royalty percentage of the releases they work on.\n\nHow can I protect my tracks from piracy?\n\nProton is a proud partner with AudioLock and Topple Track, leading the industry in piracy protection and takedowns of illegal postings. Special discounts are available for SoundSystem label managers. For details, email Jake.\n\nWho owns the tracks?\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the tracks on your label would be signed and owned by Proton LLC for the duration of our agreement together. Technically they are signed to Proton but appear on your label on every store and service. Internally, we consider the tracks mutually owned according to the royalty rates you determine for each track.\n\nThis enables Proton to earn 10% extra for your label at Beatport.\n\nIf you'd prefer to retain ownership of the tracks, then please ask us for a custom contract that we can configure for your label!\n\nWhat if I leave SoundSystem?\n\nIf you ever move your label away from SoundSystem, you can take the ownership of the tracks with you. No problem. We are here to help your label and have no interest in being unfair. And unlike other distributors, Proton does not lock you into a year long deal that you cannot leave, so if you are unhappy, you can leave at any time."
