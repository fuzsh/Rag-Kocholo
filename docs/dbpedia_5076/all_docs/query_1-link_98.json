You don't have to ping-pong emails, they know exactly what to do after your initial question. The service is of high quality just like the platform itself. A big plus is that Record Union's layout doesn't look like it came from the zeroes. It's fresh, young, and state of the art. Just one look and you're hauled in.â\n\nI Belong to the Zoo\n\nBand, Philippines\n\nâBesides having top notch customer support, what makes RU different is the fact that they are able to make you feel important.

They have always gone above and beyond and for that reason, I ended up moving all of my catalog over to Record Union, as they were the only distribution service I trusted. I would recommend Record Union to any artists looking for the right place to release their music.â\n\nWasuremono\n\nBand, United Kingdom\n\nâRecord Unionâs customer service is really friendly and easy to use, they reply super fast and are always extremely helpful.

The upload and distribution process is so easy and simple, I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for the easiest and fastest way to get your music on any of the streaming platforms.â\n\nElastic Rhythms\n\nLabel, United States\n\nâIncredibly easy and familiar in every way with the simple and sophisticated design of Record Union's distribution portal.
