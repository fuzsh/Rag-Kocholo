THE CUSTOMER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE CUSTOMER IS AND WILL BE BOUND BY THE THEN-CURRENT PRICING LIST (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE) IN EFFECTIVE AS OF THE FOLLOWING DATES: (A) THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CUSTOMER’S INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD; AND (B) IN THE EVENT THE CUSTOMER’S SUBSCRIPTION IS RENEWED, THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF EACH RENEWAL OF ITS SUBSCRIPTION.\n\nCustomer will pay all sales, use, value added, and other taxes imposed on any Subscription Fees paid to Company under this Agreement.\n\nDistribution Services\n\nCustomer License Grant to Company.

Customer may deliver to Company an alternative visual image or images to use in connection with the Art Tracks, subject to Company’s reasonable approval in each instance. In the event Company selects an alternative visual image or images not provided to Company by Customer, such images will be subject to Customer’s approval, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event Customer does not approve of Company’s alternative visual image(s), Customer will use reasonable efforts to provide Company with comparable replacement images.\n\nCustomer Commitments and Responsibilities.

If Customer is owed less than ten U.S. dollars (US$10) via PayPal or less than US$100 via Wire or ACH , Customer’s Royalties shall be carried forward onto the following accounting statement and paid to Customer once Customer's Royalties reach ten U.S. Dollars (US$10) or more via PayPal or US$100 or more via Wire or ACH. Label Engine's accounting statements shall be based solely upon information provided by our licensees and Label Engine partners. No Royalties shall be payable to Customer until payment has been actually received by Label Engine or credited to its account. Customer shall be responsible for any bank fees or related charges for the payment of any Royalties. Customer shall have a valid method of payment on file with Label Engine. It is Customer's responsibility to notify Label Engine of any changes to User's method of payment. In the event that Customer does not have a valid method of payment on file, Label Engine may suspend payment to Customer until such time that a valid payment method has been submitted. Any objection to any accounting statement or lawsuit arising therefrom must be made (and any lawsuit commenced) no later than one (1) year after the date the accounting statement is rendered. Customer hereby waives any longer statute of limitations that may be permitted by law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event that no Royalties are due to Customer, or any outstanding balance is owed to Label Engine by Customer, Label Engine shall have no obligations to provide a statement indicating that no payment is due.\n\nLabel Engine shall pay royalties within 30 days after it has determined that all information and payments were submitted correctly. Label Engine may withhold any taxes, duties, charges, or levies on payments by Label Engine to Customer pursuant to this Agreement in accordance with applicable law, rule or regulation and shall remit such withholding to the appropriate authority.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed by Label Engine, Label Engine reserves the right to set transaction fee rates on a per label basis, which may change as deemed necessary by Label Engine in its sole discretion. By way of example only, Label Engine currently charges a transaction fee of 17.5% (seventeen and one half percent) on net income (amount sent from stores, not the amount that the store receives from the end customer) on sales from 3rd Party Media Platforms or partners, except YouTube Content ID, for which the transaction fee is 20% (twenty percent).
