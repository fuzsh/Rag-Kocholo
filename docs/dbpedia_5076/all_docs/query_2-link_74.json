Through its affiliate the AF Circle C Fund, Bicycle Music controls substantial copyright interests in Wynette’s catalog of works and master recordings as well as her name, likeness, image rights and trademarks (Stand By Your Man™, Tammy Wynette™, and First Lady of Country Music™).\n\n“Tammy Wynette will always be one of the greatest and most influential artists in country music, a true icon,” said Bicycle CEO Roger Miller. “We are dedicated to preserving her legacy and ensuring that the world will continue to enjoy her music and her image for generations to come.”\n\n“Having worked with Tammy in the mid to late ’80s, it’s undeniable the influence she had not only on country music, but across so many spectrums of the industry”, said Red Light Management’s Fletcher Foster. “Along with a massive catalog of hits, she broke ground as one of the first country artists to tour overseas. She appeared on MTV in the ‘90s with an international #1 dance hit. Her voice still defines country music, and her legacy earns her the title of ‘the First Lady of Country Music’.”\n\nBorn in Mississippi, Wynette dreamed of appearing on the Grand Ole Opry from an early age, inspired by her father, a sharecropper and part-time musician. She moved to Nashville in 1966 and was signed by producer Billy Sherrill. Their legendary partnership resulted in 35 No. 1 hits, including “My Elusive Dreams” (her first chart-topper), “I Don’t Wanna Play House,” “D-I-V-O-R-CE” and her trademark song, “Stand By Your Man.”\n\nhttps://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png 0 0 admin https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png admin2011-01-31 18:10:512011-01-31 18:10:51Red Light To Manage Wynette Legacy\n\nJon Loba To Head Broken Bow/Stoney Creek\n\n/\n\nCEO Benny Brown has appointed Jon Loba Senior Vice President/Label Group of This Is Hit, Inc., parent company of Broken Bow Records and Stoney Creek Records. Loba will report directly to Brown, effective tomorrow (2/1).\n\n“I am thrilled to have Jon Loba back on our team,” says Brown. “Jon has an insurmountable amount of knowledge, talent and passion for this industry. Having Jon on our team to help with both label imprints will help us continue our company’s commitment to excellence.”\n\nLoba rejoins the BBR/SCR family after exiting the company in 2007 to help launch The Valory Music Co. as VP of Promotion and Artist Development. “I want to wish everyone at Valory Music well and I will forever be proud of what we accomplished together but I’m very excited about my new opportunity,” says Loba.\n\nHe continues, “I cannot express how ecstatic I am to once again work with Benny Brown and his team, many whom I have worked with before. They are a passionate and talented group who keep defying the odds. The icing on my cake is being reunited with Jason Aldean and the chance to be involved with the careers of Thompson Square, James Wesley and all the BBR/Stoney Creek artists. I definitely feel like I am coming home and can’t wait to get started!”\n\nOther artists signed to BBR/Stoney Creek are Blake Wise, Kristy Lee Cook, Ash Bowers and Crossin Dixon.\n\nJon Loba can be reached at 615-244-8600 or jloba@brokenbowrecords.com.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/10195109/bbr.jpg 260 390 Sarah Skates https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sarah Skates2011-01-31 14:07:172011-01-31 14:07:17Jon Loba To Head Broken Bow/Stoney Creek\n\nPeermusic Inks Vicky McGehee\n\n/\n\nPeer Music has purchased Vicky McGehee‘s Middle Child 2 Music catalog, and signed her to an exclusive songwriter and co-publishing deal. The announcement was made by peermusic’s Kevin Lamb and Michael Knox, both of whom are based in peer’s Nashville offices. The deal includes Vicky’s back catalogue as well as her future works.\n\nAmong McGehee’s hits is “Wildflower,” recorded by the the JaneDear girls. She also penned recent singles by Alan Jackson (“It’s Just That Way”) and Danny Gokey (“I Will Not Say Goodbye”). She is a frequent co-writer of Gretchen Wilson, John Rich and Toby Keith. McGehee has also written tracks for Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, Reba McEntire, Montgomery Gentry, John Anderson and more.\n\nIn 2005 McGehee won MusicRow’s Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year. In 2006 she won BMI’s Songwriter of the Year, and in 2007 she took home her first BMI Pop Award.\n\n“Michael and I have some very definitive feelings about the first signings we make,” says Lamb. “From day one Vicky has been on our short list. Her talents and personality make her a great first signing since Michael joined peer and we are both thrilled to be working with her.”\n\n“Vicky and I go back 10 years,” Knox stated. “We’ve had a lot of success together and I’m excited to continue that in the future. Vicki is a chameleon, you can put her in any songwriting situation and she will come out with something great.”\n\n“Michael Knox signed me to Warner/Chappell Publishing in 2000 and what an amazing ride it was!” says McGehee. “Michael gave me the creative freedom I needed and just enough rope to either hang myself or fly, and man we flew! I’ve been on my own for over three years, starting my company, Middle Child 2 Music. It’s been a very successful run and an incredible experience. I didn’t think I would ever sign with another publisher again, but when I received a call a few months ago from Michael, I immediately missed being part of a family. There is such an excitement at peermusic about the future and about bringing the fun back to the music business.”\n\nhttps://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png 0 0 admin https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png admin2011-01-31 13:28:302011-01-31 13:28:30Peermusic Inks Vicky McGehee\n\nBobby Karl Works Taylor Swift's Heavy Metal Party\n\n/\n\nChapter 357\n\nThe best way to start a weekend is with a superstar.\n\n“This is a Friday night, and you’re going to give me a portion of it – I’m so happy to see you,” said a delighted Taylor Swift. “I am so happy right now for these people in my life. They bring me joy.”\n\nThe occasion was “Heavy Metal at the Hard Rock,” a bash staged downtown on Friday evening (1/28). We gathered to celebrate world conquest by the 21-year-old music phenom. Specifically, her Triple Platinum success with her Speak Now CD, her No. 1 triumph with “Mine” and her cumulative U.S. sales of 13 million.\n\n“I made a really personal record this time,” said Taylor of Speak Now, “and the time before that, and the time before that….Making this album without any co-writers was a little lonelier. But it was something I needed to do.”\n\n“It looks like the gang’s all here,” said Big Machine’s Scott Borchetta in welcoming the crowd. “We’re here to celebrate and honor more incredible accomplishments by our friend Taylor Swift. We’re on a collision course with 20 million albums.”\n\nA succession of presenters took the stage in the Hard Rock’s upstairs party room. First up was BMI’s Jody Williams. “Taylor re-sets the bar so consistently,” he said. “[Taylor’s producer] Nathan Chapman is like one of my kids, except he doesn’t cost me as much.”\n\nSony/ATV’s Troy Tomlinson recited a “poem” that spelled out “T-A-Y-L-O-R.” “O is for the owesome way you treat us,” he drawled, drawing laughs. “R is for renew my contract, which is what they do every time you renew with me.\n\n“Nathan, what you and Taylor do when you get in those little rooms with no windows is magic.”\n\nMusicRow’s David Ross took the serious route. “You look nice,” Taylor said to him. “Love the hat.”\n\n“You look nice, too,” he replied. She did, with her tresses drawn back in a curly ponytail and wearing a fetching, black-and-white polka dotted shirtwaist dress cinched with a red belt. She stood in the crowd with the rest of us while the execs sang her praises, saving her thank-you speech for the finale.\n\n“Your career is just so amazing,” David began. “All of us in this town feel so strongly about it. Your success is so truly deserved, and we feel so privileged to have a front-row seat to watch your career.”\n\nMusicRow was well represented at the bash. Sherod Robertson, Jon Freeman and Sarah Skates were all applauding, as was yours truly.\n\nQuoth the CRB’s Bill Mayne, “For the thousands of country radio stations all over America, we love you….We hope and want and need all of your success to continue.”\n\nThe CMA, the RIAA, Nielsen Soundscan, Country Aircheck, CMT, GAC and Universal Distribution all made presentations. But Scott and company kept things moving briskly along.\n\n“Our relationship and our work together has been life changing,” said Scott of his stunning star. “She lives these songs. These songs are her DNA. She has this incredible emotional connection.”\n\n“The fans are my friends,” Taylor responded. “I love that we understand each other. Scott Borchetta, thank you for letting me be me.”\n\nHere are a few tidbits we picked up during the event. On the day that Speak Now came out, Nathan and his wife, recording artist Stephanie Chapman, found out they are pregnant. Speak Now has sold more than the 61 albums behind it on the pop chart, combined. Kay West nearly blew her People mag scoop when Taylor and former beau Jake Gyllenhaal turned up dining at Bound’ry a few weeks ago. A spy told Kay that Taylor was there, “with that guy from Jarheads,” and Kay assumed that was some rock band until she Googled the 2005 movie Jarhead. We decided that it must have been a farewell dinner with Jake begging Taylor not to write a song about him.\n\nAnyhow, back to the party. The wait staff circulated with trays of cheeseburgers, spicy shrimp shots, sushi rolls, grilled veggies in pastry cups and crab cakes topped with dollops of remoulade.\n\nThe invitation-only, media-heavy crowd included Donna Hughes, Rob Simbeck, Ron Huntsman, Ron Cox (Avenue Bank is donating money to the Country Music Hall of Fame in Taylor’s name), Charlie Monk, Charlie Chase & Lorianne Crook, Suzanne Gordon, Susan Stewart, Sarah Trahern, Ed Hardy, Terry Wakefield, John Zarling, Chuck Aly, R.J. Curtis, Bob Doerschuk (who’d interviewed Taylor for CMA Close-Up that morning), Erin Burr, Mike Milom, Brian Mansfield, Hunter Kelly, Jay Frank, Sandi Borchetta, Phyllis Stark, Betsy Walker, Eric Weinberg, Wendell Moore and David Crow.\n\n“I love this town,” Taylor told them. “I love this beautiful industry. I’m having so much fun, and thank-you for being the reason I get to.\n\n“We’re about to do some crazy traveling,” Taylor reported. “It’s going to be a really busy year, and I am more than excited for that.” She said she’s brushing up on Japanese phrases to say on stage during her swing through Asia in February. Also Korean, Chinese and Filipino. Then Dutch, Norwegian, German, Italian, French and Spanish before she swings through the British Isles, all in March.\n\nLike I said, world conquest.\n\nHeavy Metal Achievements\n\nTaylor Swift’s career sales now exceed 20 million albums and 35 million song downloads.\n\nWith over 35 million tracks sold to date, Taylor remains the top selling digital artist in music history.\n\nFor the second time in three years, Taylor Swift is Billboard & Nielsen SoundScan’s top-selling artist of the year, with over 4.4 million albums sold in 2010.\n\nReleased in October, Speak Now sold 1,046,740 copies the first week, for the biggest debut-week sales for an album since 2005, and the biggest debut ever for a country studio album.\n\nSpeak Now has achieved Triple Platinum+ status since its release.\n\nThe album’s lead single, “Mine,” has sold 1.6 million digital downloads to date.\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Taylor is Billboard’s most-played artist, topping their annual all-genre Artist Airplay chart with more than 1.128 million airplay detections in 2010.\n\nTaylor has sold more than 4 million albums each year for three consecutive years, and is the only artist to sell 4+ million albums each of the last three years.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/10195111/tsfront.jpg 260 390 Bobby Karl https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Bobby Karl2011-01-31 09:45:172011-01-31 09:45:17Bobby Karl Works Taylor Swift's Heavy Metal Party\n\nEMI—The Hands Saga Continues\n\n/\n\nThe ongoing dysfunctional financial relationship between Guy Hands’ Terra Firma and Citigroup Inc., has been well documented. Hands purchased EMI in 2007 for about $6.67 billion dollars. As part of that transaction, Hands borrowed about $4.79 billion from Citigroup.\n\nAlmost immediately after the deal was completed, Hands began to cry foul, complaining that the bank had not acted in good faith in its dealings. However, after losing an extremely public court trial late last year, the Terra Firma leader’s alternatives are narrowing. Financial analysts believe that there is a strong likelihood that Hands/EMI will be unable to produce the $200 million necessary to satisfy the company’s agreements with Cititgroup at the end of March 2011. If that shortfall does indeed occur, then the music business would default to Citigroup. And here is where the plot gets thicker…\n\nAccording to reports in the Wall Street Journal, the bank is already actively exploring options it might choose if/when the default takes place and “has already made contact with parties that could quickly snap up the historic music company—and Mr. Hands himself is even among them.” The publication asserts that Citigroup will price the sale of its foreclosed asset at around £1.8 billion.\n\nIt is confusing to imagine Hands losing the company for lack of $200 million, then circling around and buying it again for £1.8 billion pounds, but the resourceful Mr. Hands is strategizing a possible scenario whereby with help from CPP Investment Board, a Canadian pension fund firm, he might combine a bid for Warner Music Group with the EMI repurchase. Perhaps, in such a situation, Citigroup might also consider a new loan. WSJ speculates however, that odds are against Hands owning EMI a second time.\n\nThere are numerous other suitors for EMI, such as Sony Music, Universal Music Group, KKR, TV personality Simon Cowell and even Warner Music that are likely to complicate Hands’ plans. Warner announced last week it was looking to either buy EMI or sell itself. An EMI purchase would likely include a sale of Warner Chappell Music in any case to avoid regulatory concerns if WMG was to gain EMI Music Publishing.\n\nWhile the winner of this complicated chess game to control EMI and possibly Warner Music Group is too cloudy to peg, its certain the value of these once-giant music industry titan companies is dropping like the proverbial rock rolling downhill.\n\nhttps://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png 0 0 admin https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png admin2011-01-28 13:01:092011-01-28 13:01:09EMI—The Hands Saga Continues\n\nWeekly Chart Report (1/28/11)\n\n/\n\nSPIN ZONE\n\nThe battle for CountryBreakout No. 1 song is heating up, but Luke Bryan’s “Someone Else Calling You Baby” remains on top for a second consecutive week. But a trio of superstar hits—Blake Shelton’s “Who Are You When I’m Not Looking,” Lady Antebellum’s “Hello World,” and Taylor Swift’s “Back To December”—is right behind Bryan, and will soon be competing for No. 1 bragging rights. That is, of course, if Brad Paisley’s “This Is Country Music” doesn’t leapfrog them all. “This Is Country Music” gains 258 spins and leaps up to No. 7.\n\nOne of this week’s big surprises is Englishman David Bradley’s “Hard Time Movin’ On,” featuring guest vocals by Rodney Crowell. The song has clearly won some fans in the programming world, as it gains 137 spins to earn our biggest debut at No. 69. Also making an impressive debut is Davis Music Group’s Jacob Lyda with “I’m Doin’ Alright.” Reporters gave it an extra 157 spins and propelled it on the chart at No. 73.\n\nA series of new 2011 singles are all rapidly gaining momentum. Miranda Lambert’s “Heart Like Mine” charges up to No. 19, followed by Zac Brown Band’s “Colder Weather” at No. 20. Label cousins Rascal Flatts and The Band Perry are also on the move with “I Won’t Let Go” (No. 28) and “You Lie” (No. 31), respectively.

Visitation will be 11AM –4PM Saturday, Jan. 29, as well as one hour prior to the funeral on Sunday. Harpeth Hills Funeral Home is located at 9090 Hwy 100, Nashville, TN, 615-646-9292.\n\nCountry Music Hall of Fame member Charlie Louvin has passed away following a fight with pancreatic cancer. The 83-year-old died at his home in Wartrace, Tennessee.\n\nLouvin underwent surgery after being diagnosed in the summer of 2010, but the operation was limited in its success. Still, it stabilized the performer’s health long enough for him continue working through the end of the year.\n\nIn recent years Louvin’s career had experienced a revival. His 2007 self-titled release—his first in 10 years—earned a Grammy nomination, raising his career total to four nods. His most recent solo album, The Battles Rage On, came out Nov. 9, and he taped his first music video last fall. Del McCoury guested in the “Weapon Of Prayer” video and track from the True North Records release.\n\nBorn Charlie Elzer Loudermilk in Section, Alabama on July 7, 1927, Charlie and his brother Ira eventually took the stage name Louvin. Musical talent ran in the family—they were first cousins of songwriter John D. Loudermilk. With Ira playing the mandolin and Charlie picking up the guitar, their career as The Louvin Brothers began in the 1940s. Their traditional sounds led them all the way to the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nTheir breakthrough album came out on Capitol in 1952, leading to their biggest success in the mid ‘50s with “When I Stop Dreaming,” “I Don’t Believe You’ve Met My Baby,” and “Hoping That You’re Hoping.”\n\nThe brother duo broke up in 1963, and Ira died in a 1965 car crash.\n\nCharlie Louvin has completed upwards of 20 records, earned six Top 10 singles, and 15 Top 20 singles over the span of six decades.\n\nHis recordings have influenced generations of performers, including Emmylou Harris, Gram Parsons, Jack White, Johnny Cash and Alison Krauss.\n\nLouvin is survived by his wife Betty, and three sons, Charlie Jr. (Sonny), Glenn and Kenneth. A private funeral for Louvin will be held in Nashville, on Sunday, January 30.\n\nhttps://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png 0 0 Sarah Skates https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sarah Skates2011-01-27 09:11:372011-01-27 09:11:37[Updated w/ Arrangements] Charlie Louvin Passes\n\nThe Band Perry Celebrates First No. 1\n\n/\n\nBMI honored sibling trio The Band Perry and their hit song “If I Die Young” at the company’s Music Row office. Written by Kimberly Perry and performed by her and her brothers Reid Perry and Neil Perry, the song marks Kimberly’s first trip to the top of the charts as a songwriter as well as the group’s first No. 1. This is also the first No. 1 for Republic Nashville, which formed in June 2009 as a joint venture between Scott Borchetta, President/CEO of Big Machine Records, LLC and Monte Lipman, President/CEO of Universal Republic.\n\nhttps://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png 0 0 contributor https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png contributor2011-01-27 08:59:252011-01-27 08:59:25The Band Perry Celebrates First No. 1\n\nGive Credit Where Credit Is Due: Oscar Noms Omit Writer\n\n/\n\nYesterday (1/25) Nashville was beaming with pride when local songwriters Tom Douglas, Troy Verges, and Hillary Lindsey scored an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. Together, with Bob DiPiero, they wrote “Coming Home” for the Country Strong soundtrack. So why isn’t DiPiero’s name on the official nominations list?\n\nAccording to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, no more than three songwriters can be nominated in this category; and Douglas, Verges, and Lindsey were the three names submitted.\n\nAn Academy rep maintains that this rule is because the Oscars are designed to reward individual, not group, achievement.\n\nAccording to the rep, the Original Song category traditionally honors two songwriters: one for lyrics, one for music. According to the official rules:\n\nNo more than two statuettes will normally be given in the Original Song category. A third statuette may be awarded when there are three essentially equal contributors to a song.\n\nOnly the principal composer(s) or songwriter(s) responsible for the conception and execution of the work as a whole shall be eligible for an award. Excluded will be partial contributors (i.e., any writer not responsible for the overall design of the work)\n\nRules for this category are overseen by The Music Branch Executive Committee, currently headed by chairman Bruce Broughton. An article in Variety last month pointed out: “No Academy group has tinkered more with its rules than the music branch. Over the years, categories have been added and subtracted, and the award titles have changed repeatedly. Even the idea of what is eligible and what is not — for songs and scores alike — has been overhauled numerous times.”\n\nSo maybe the committee should consider allowing all songwriters with equal writing credit to be nominated?\n\n“Coming Home” was performed by Gwyneth Paltrow for the soundtrack released by RCA Nashville. The song was also nominated at the recent Golden Globes for Best Original Song – Motion Picture.\n\nThe 83rd Academy Awards will air Sunday, February 27, on ABC.\n\nhttps://music-row-website-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/10195121/oscar-front.jpg 260 390 Sarah Skates https://musicrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MusicRow-header-logo-Mar19B.png Sarah Skates2011-01-26 15:09:542011-01-26 15:09:54Give Credit Where Credit Is Due: Oscar Noms Omit Writer"
