        "text": "I first became aware of Walerian Borowczyk while working as a video store clerk in college. Our two-bit store had VHS copies of La bête and Contes immoraux in the ‘cult’ section, with gaudy green warning labels stating that no one under the age of 18 was permitted to rent them. At the time, Borowczyk’s reputation among cinephiles (or at least the cinephiles I met at a video rental in Michigan) was that of a relatively-obscure, ‘subversive’ filmmaker who made at once baroque and sexually-explicit films. Young Americans typically aligned him with other European directors such as Paul Verhoeven and Dusan Makaveyev, admiring what they believed to be their more ‘liberal’ (relative to American directors) approach to images of sex and violence: “That’s just how they roll in Europe.”\n\nThis was in the late 1990s and early 2000s, before internet-based file-sharing provided a way to see most of his films. The new access changed everything. A renewed interest in Borowczyk began perhaps in the mid-2000s, when streaming and torrent technology allowed viewers to find copies of The Story of Sin, La marge, Behind Convent Walls, and others. In 2008, the Center for Contemporary Art in Warsaw held a retrospective of Borowczyk’s animation, b. Boro. Borowczyk: Walerian Borowczyk (1923-2006). The catalog for the retrospective featured essays by Bertrand Mandico, Pascal Vimenet, and Daniel Bird. Three years later, Mandico would release Boro in the Box, an imagined biography of the filmmaker, and in 2014 Bird would co-produce Camera Obscura, a DVD box set containing restored versions of five Borowczyk feature films.\n\nOne indication of this renewed interest in Boro’s works, at least in the United States, is the emergence of books devoted to those works. Several books on Borowczyk have of course been printed in Europe, contextualizing him primarily as an artist and animator -namely Valerio Caprara’s Walerian Borowczyk from 1980, Borowczyk: cinéaste onirique from 1981, and Alberto Pezzotta’s Associazioni imprevedibili: il cinema di Walerian Borowczyk from 2009. Some short exhibition catalogs -one by Gianni Rondolino from 1970 for the Rassegna Internazionale del Film di Animazione at Abano Terme, one by Emanuele Horodniceanu from 1982 for the Circuito Cinema series, and one compiled in 1997 by the Centre International du Cinéma d’Animation at Annecy- also exist. All of these works are printed either in French or Italian. Before 2008, there had been no monograph written or translated in English on the filmmaker. Walerian Borowczyk: Cinema of Erotic Dreams by Jeremy Mark Robinson is the first to so, in the same year as the Warsaw exhibition. Two more books -Simon Strong’s Unquiet Dreams: The Bestiary of Walerian Borowczyk and an edited volume Boro, L’Ile d’Amour: The Films of Walerian Borowczyk– have been published in 2015. As the introduction to the latter claims, the corpus of Borowczyk’s films “…presents a significant challenge to any historian’s attempt to classify it and ascribe it to a single narrative.” The following books attempt to do so, in various ways and with varying success.\n\nWalerian Borowczyk: Cinema of Erotic Dreams by Jeremy Mark Robinson, 2008.\n\nAt almost 200 pages, Robinson’s Walerian Borowczyk: Cinema of Erotic Dreams has nothing original to say, and no critical insight of any kind regarding Borowczyk’s oeuvre. The writing is the product of an enthusiast.\n\nTake for instance how he starts off a paragraph: “Borowczyk’s short films have a beauty, a mystery, a texture which’s absolutely compelling.” He doesn’t explain what is so ‘compelling’ about -or even what compels him to-the short films. He stops there and moves on to something else: “And the brilliant use of sound -of sound effects and music- should also be mentioned.” That’s the paragraph: Two unrelated statements that are left unexplored. Further, the diction is simply poor throughout the book, using phrases such as “way more” rather than “much more,” for example. There are also many uses of “sucked,” “ain’t,” “kinda,” and the like.\n\nIn each chapter, Robinson occasionally mentions recurring motifs in Boro’s films such as distinctions in production design and editing, but merely describes what happens in each scene and moves on, missing several opportunities to interpret anything. In the chapter on the Therese Philosophe segment from Contes immoraux, he noted that a print of Edward VII can be seen in montage during the masturbation scene. In the earlier passages Robinson states briefly that institutions such as convents, European aristocracy, and dictatorships appear often in Borowczyk’s films -and one wouldn’t doubt that Borowczyk featured these institutions for a reason- so why not investigate their portrayal? Therese is set in 1890, though Edward VII does not become King of England until 1901. One could compare the print in Therese to a scene in Borowczyk’s The Art of Love, which is set in the lifetime of Ovid, who died sometime in the years 17 to 18, but features a model of the Flavian Amphitheater, which would not have been built for another 50 years. Could Borowczyk’s anachronisms in these two films suggest something about sexual repression or consumption of erotica under certain political circumstances (prior to his coronation, Edward VII also had a reputation as a philanderer)? Robinson doesn’t attempt to explore the themes he puts forth, and concludes regarding the print of Edward VII: “Candles and cucumbers might be expected to be part of masturbation, but not a print of Edward VII or a bath mat!”\n\nThe entire book is that way. It’s a 180-page high school book report written by an enthusiast with nothing to say. All of the content is either basic information gleaned from websites or the author’s opinions, for which he provides either weak support or none at all (he describes for example Escargot de Venus as ‘minor’ Borowczyk because he simply believes its subject, Bona Tibertelli de Pisis, is a bad artist). Given the subjects of Borowczyk’s films, and those films’ reception and reputation among most audiences, writing like this arguably hurts rather than helps Borowczyk’s reputation.\n\nUnquiet Dreams: The Bestiary of Walerian Borowczyk by Simon Strong, 2015.\n\nSimon Strong begins Unquiet Dreams with an anecdote regarding his first experiences watching La bête and Contes immoraux. This approach not only seems appropriate, but almost necessary, given that there seems to be so little extant biographical data on Borowczyk, documentation on his feature films, or their exhibition throughout the 1970s. Instead, as a ‘bestiary,’ Unquiet Dreams is an almanac of sorts profiling the larger artistic trends and circumstances in which the director worked. Large portions of the book are not about Borowczyk or his films at all, but rather about his sources and collaborators (had it not been for producer Anatole Dauman and Argos Films, Strong may never have had the chance to see Contes immoraux or La bête screen commercially in the first place, thus Dauman forms part of the ‘bestiary’). In the addenda, Strong provides the source material for La bête, reproducing the full text of Marie Leprince de Beaumont’s La belle et la bête and Prosper Merimee’s Lokis, and offers his own text: “The Actual Facts About the Beast of Gevauden.” Like Robinson, Strong’s prose is conversational and uses colloquial language. Unlike Robinson, however, his style is brisk and he himself often comes across as funny (he writes about moving to Brighton in 1983: “By this time I was, of course, interested in kung fu and horror films, and girls. I decided it would be a good idea to familiarize myself with arty shit so I could chat up the sophisticated south coast women.”).\n\nThe book is also a ‘scrapbook’ of sorts, and reproduces numerous promotional materials of Borowczyk’s films and art by Borowczyk’s hand. Unquiet Dreams has the makings of coffee table book, if not the appropriate budget. Though Strong doesn’t address this, as a whole the posters almost serve as an index of the difference in value systems regarding the exhibition of sexually-explicit films between continental Europe and the English-speaking world. The U.S. poster for Contes immoraux, for instance, features the tagline “You don’t have to go to a museum to see an X-rated Picasso” and a censored image of Bathory’s nude virgins.\n\nThe author makes several digressions as he moves through Borowczyk’s filmography, which vary in relevance to the filmography: an annotated list of films taking bestiality as a subject, for instance. Some sections, such as one titled “Assailed by a Snail,” address specific iconography in Borowczyk’s oeuvre. Others, such as those devoted to Alain Fleischer, Catherine Jourdan, and Sirpa Lane, while full of useful data, seem to exist far on the periphery of the book’s subject. One section is called “The Biggest Screen,” wherein Strong equates astrology to a type of ‘cinema’ for the ancient world. He writes: “Since the development of artificial cinema during the industrial age, however, the constellations of [the] night sky are now of interest only two professional scientists, enthusiasts and lovers. These prototype films are projected simultaneously and, as in a drive-in multiplex, the viewer must merely shift their gaze to watch a different film. One soundtrack fits all.”\n\nWhat does this have to do with Borowczyk’s cinema or with filmmaking at all? Practically nothing aside from Borowczyk’s use of the constellations Taurus and Cygnus in The Art of Love -which Strong notes. While this may not be precisely the kind of critical writing I typically look for in a monograph on a filmmaker, passages like the one above indicate to me that Strong has invested some creative thinking into what he wants to say about recurring themes in Borowczyk’s oeuvre.\n\nFinally, Strong routinely acknowledges that the story of producing a ‘definitive’ biography of Boro’s life or catalogue of his works is not over. He cites Boro’s (possibly lost) early student films such as August from 1943 and The Head from 1949, stating that “…very little data about them has come to light yet.”\n\nBoro, L’Île d’Amour: The Films of Walerian Borowczyk edited by Kamila Kuc, Kuba Mikurda, Michał Oleszczyk, 2015.\n\nChapters throughout Boro, L’Île d’Amour: The Films of Walerian Borowczyk routinely return to three ideas: The connection between Borowczyk and the surrealist tradition in Europe, the mixed-media or ‘intermedia’ nature of his films, and the connection between Borowczyk and Georges Bataille’s notions of eroticism. It’s an edited volume comprised of essays by film scholars, filmmakers, artists, and critics. In general, I responded more positively to the chapters written by film scholars offering critical analysis than to chapters by critics or artists offering surveys, reminiscences, or the like. However, the preface also justifies the volume by acknowledging that the breadth of Borowczyk’s career doesn’t lend itself to a single narrative, so it makes sense that different kinds of narratives portray the filmmaker.\n\nSeveral authors contextualize Borowczyk’s oeuvre as surrealist and/or dadaist, specifically in how his films draw the viewer’s attention to the inherent artifice of the filmmaking medium. A conversation between Kuba Mikurda and Jakub Woynarowski alludes to Boro’s ‘animation’ of actors through stage direction and editing, using an iconographic comparison of his films as an art historian might (prior to Foucault), and “Boro’s Kunstkamera” by Marcin Gizycki describes the director’s treatment of actors as ‘props’ or objects, relating them to automata (“With no true automata at his disposal, Borowczyk did his best to turn his actors into ones.”).\n\nAs mentioned, most writing on Borowczyk in Europe frames him as an artist and animator who also directed live-action films. Many chapters in Boro demonstrate an understanding of the ‘intermedia’ nature of Borowczyk’s craft. The chapters often do this by relating the work of Boro to that of Georges Melies. Mikurda and Woynarowski discuss the historical development of animation alongside that of motion pictures and find very little difference, artistically. With this in mind, both “Immoral Toys” by Edwin Carels and “The Beach, the Bubble, and the Boudoir” by Jonathan Owen name Une collection particulière as crucial in establishing Borowczyk’s sensibilities -namely returning a viewer to Melies’ ‘cinema of attractions,’ or the notion of cinema as an “optical contraption that stimulates curiosity.”\n\nIt also seems inevitable to discuss Borowczyk’s films in terms of their erotic components, and authors here attribute a cathartic nature to Boro’s sense of eroticism by relating it to the writings of Georges Bataille. Owen’s chapter, working from Bataille’s notion that eroticism gains potency from its own interdiction, argues that both Borowczyk and his collaborator Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues follow Bataille artistically in that regard -specifically with the use of space in the The Tide segment in Contes immoraux. “Enjoying Excess” by Marta Rabikowska argues that Boro portrayed the heroine of The Story of Sin as an exemplar of Bataille’s ideas of fraudulent morality, and relates Boro to Bataille in saying that the former objectifies what the latter calls ‘wasted desire’ in that film.\n\nCertain chapters use, arguably, outdated or futile methodologies. “Cruel Imagination” by Iwona Kurz argues that aspects of Borowczyk’s imagery -such a drawing by Boro of exhumed bodies published in 1945, and war imagery in Les jeux des anges and Renaissance– are distilled from his experience in the Nazi labor camps, but doesn’t use the imagery to establish Borowczyk necessarily as “…a mind already partly shaped by many distressing experiences and their memory traces.” In fairness, arguments of this kind are always difficult to support other than with circumstantial evidence. Other chapters simply distinguish themselves from either popular or critical writing. Kamila Kuc’s “Postcard Never Sent” -an imagined conversation between Borowczyk, author Guy de Maupassant, and his fictional character Rosalie Prudent- suggest something akin to Breton’s Nadja, Doctorow’s Ragtime or even Mandico’s Boro in the Box. “Borowczyk’s Serial Labyrinth” by artist James Snazell, seems to lose itself in its own language in trying to describing Boro’s filmmaking process from a technical point of view, using the word ‘aesthetic’ as a noun and adjective at least four times in the first two paragraphs: “aesthetic mixing,” “aesthetic considerations,” the redundant “aesthetic sensibility,” and “aesthetic techniques.” Still other chapters were not of as much interest to me, but I wouldn’t dismiss them to the casual reader or someone relatively new to Borowczyk. Chapters by Simon Abrams, Fernando Croce, Kevin Lee, Philip Warnell, and Budd Wilkins offer either simple ekpharases, reflections on certain films from the point of view of either a critic for a popular publication or an enthusiast, or (fairly obvious) thematic relations between Boro’s oeuvre to an ‘animal instinct/civilization’ binary or ‘cultural zeitgeist.’\n\nAs with any edited volume that features scholarly writing, the reader inevitably gets a sense of a community talking to itself. Most of the authors’ bibliographies are very similar, usually citing each other, or one of the two major works in English on Polish cinema from the last five years (not reviewed here but worth mentioning): The Story of Sin: Surrealism in Polish Cinema edited by Kamila Wielebska and Kuba Mikurda in 2010 and Polish Cinema in a Transnational Context edited by Ewa Mazierska and Michael Goddard in 2014 (as an aside, the former volume contains the only critical ‘thematic’ writing I’ve encountered on Piotr Szulkin and Andrzej Zulawski written in English; most scholarship contextualizes them politically). Despite this, a community exists, and indicates both a serious and passing interest in the filmmaker. Says Daniel Bird at the Borowczyk retrospective at the BFI Southbank and ICA in March 2014: “The jury is still out. The books have yet to be written. They are being written.”"
