Michelangelo is a pious and argumentative artist. Although widely considered a genius by his contemporaries, Michelangelo Buonarroti (Alberto Testone) is reduced to poverty and depleted by his struggle to finish the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. While painting the chapel he is also pressured to simultaneously complete the statues which are part of the tomb designed and intended for Pope Julius II.\n\nWhen his commissioner and head of the Della Rovere nobility Pope Julius II dies, Michelangelo becomes obsessed with sourcing the finest marble to complete his tomb. The artist's loyalty is tested when Leo X, of the rival Medici family, ascends to the papacy and charges him with a lucrative new commission – the façade of the San Lorenzo basilica. Forced to lie to maintain favour with both families, Michelangelo is progressively tormented by suspicion and hallucinations, leading him to ruthlessly examine his own moral and artistic failings.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAlberto Testone as Michelangelo Buonarroti\n\nJakob Diehl as Peppe\n\nFrancesco Gaudiello as Pietro\n\nAdriano Chiaramida as Ludovico Buonarroti\n\nGianluca Guidi as Egidio da Viterbo\n\nOrso Maria Guerrini as Marchese Malaspina\n\nGlen Blackhall as Raphael\n\nMassimo De Francovich as Pope Julius II\n\nNicola Adobati as Lorenzo de Medici duca d'Urbino\n\nFederico Vanni as Jacopo Sansovino\n\nNicola De Paola as Cardinale Giulio de' Medici\n\nAntonio Gargiulo as Francesco Maria Della Rovere\n\nRiccardo Landi as Al Farab\n\nSimone Toffanin as Pope Leo X\n\nJulia Vysotskaya as Lady with an Ermine\n\nToni Pandolfo as Dante Alighieri\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nSin has an approval rating of 95% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 7.3/10.[4] It also has a score of 65 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[5]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nMichelangelo in popular culture\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
