        "text": "Updated 19/01/2021\n\nContents\n\n1. What Is Text Response?\n\n2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Text Response Criteria)\n\n3. School Assessed Coursework (SAC), Exams and Allocated Marks\n\n4. How To Prepare for Your Text Response SAC and Exam\n\n5. How To Write a Text Response\n\n1. What Is Text Response?\n\nLike its name, Text Response is when you respond to a text. The most popular texts are novels and films; however, plays, poetry and short stories are also common. Your response will be in the form of an essay, in which you discuss themes, ideas and characters. Recall all the novels and films you've studied since Year 7 (there'll be quite a few!). You should be very familiar with the process of watching a film or reading a novel, participating in class discussions about themes and characters, and finally, submitting an essay based on the text.\n\nAs you graduate into higher year levels, you spend each year revising and improving on TEEL, learning to better incorporate quotes and formulating even longer essays than the year before (remember when you thought you couldn't possibly write an essay more than 500 words?).\n\nThe good news is, all of that learning is now funnelled into VCEâs Text Response, one of the three parts of the VCE English study design. Text Response, officially known as âReading and Respondingâ in the study design, is the first Area of study (AoS 1) - meaning that the majority of students will tackle the Text Response SAC in Term 1. Let's get into it!\n\n2. What Are You Expected To Cover? (Text Response Criteria)\n\nWhat are teachers and examiners expecting to see in your essays? Below are the VCE criteria for Text Response essays.\n\nNote: Some schools may express the following points differently, however, they should all boil down to the same points - what is necessary in a Text Response essay.\n\na) Critically analyse texts and the ways in which authors construct meaning;\n\nMuch of the âmeaningâ in a novel/film comes instinctively to readers. Why is it that we can automatically distinguish between a protagonist from an antagonist? Why is it that we know whether or not the author supports or denounces an idea?\n\nHere you need to start looking at how the author constructs their texts and why they have made that choice. For example, the author describes a protagonist using words with positive connotations (kind, brave, charming), whereas the antagonist is described with words using negative connotations (vain, egocentric, selfish).\n\nFor example, 'in Harry Potter, by describing the protagonist Harry as \"brave\", the author JK Rowling exhibits the idea of how possessing bravery when making tough choices or facing challenges is a strong and positive trait.'\n\nb) Analyse the social, historical and/or cultural values embodied in texts;\n\nSociety, history and culture all shape and influence us in our beliefs and opinions. Authors use much of what theyâve obtained from the world around them and employ this knowledge to their writing. Understanding their values embodied in texts can help us as readers, identity and appreciate theme and character representations.\n\nFor example, 'through the guilty verdict of Tom Robinson in To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee expresses the belief that the American legal system in the 1930s was not always fair or just.'\n\nFor more information on context and authorial intent in VCE English, read Tim's blog, Context and Authorial Intention in VCE English, or Olivia's on what authorial intent is and why it's important.\n\nc) Discuss and compare possible interpretations of texts using evidence from the text;\n\nBe open to the idea that many texts can be interpreted in many ways. Texts are rarely concrete and simple. Take The Bible, a book that is one of the most popular and famous books in history but is interpreted differently by every person. Acknowledging more than one perspective on a certain aspect of the text, or acknowledging that perhaps the writer is intentionally ambiguous, is a valuable skill that demonstrates you have developed a powerful insight into your text.\n\nFor example, 'in The Thing Around Your Neck, feminist readers condone Adichie's stories which all revolve around women either as protagonist or as narrators, giving voice to the disempowered gender in Nigerian society.'\n\nâd) Use appropriate metalanguage to construct a supported analysis of a text;\n\nWhile you should absolutely know how to embed quotes in your essay like a boss, you want to have other types of evidence in your Text Response essay. You must discuss how the author uses the form that he/she is writing in to develop their discussion. This encompasses a huge breadth of things from metaphors to structure to language.\n\nFor example, 'The personification of Achilles as \"wolf, a violator of every law of men and gods\", illustrates his descent from human to animalâ¦.' or 'Maloufâs constant use of the present voice and the chapter divisions allow the metaphor of time to demonstrate the futility and omnipresence of warâ¦'.\n\nTo learn more about metalanguage, read our 'What Is Metalanguage?' post.\n\ne) Control and effectiveness of language use, as appropriate to the task\n\nWhen examiners read essays, they are expected to get through about 12-15 essays in an hour! This results in approximately 5 minutes to read, get their head around, and grade your essay - not much time at all! It is so vital that you donât give the examiner an opportunity to take away marks because they have to reread certain parts of your essay due to poor expression and grammar.\n\nFor further advice on the above criteria points, read Emily's (English study score 46): Year 12: How To Turn Your Text Response Essays From Average to A+.\n\n3. School Assessed Coursework (SAC), Exams and Allocated Marks\n\nReading and Creating is assessed in Unit 1 (Year 11) and Unit 3 (Year 12). The number of allocated marks are:\n\nUnit 1 - dependant on school\n\nUnit 3 English â 30 marks\n\nUnit 3 EAL â 40 marks\n\nExactly when Text Response is assessed within each unit is dependent on each school; some schools at the start of the Unit, others at the end. The time allocated to your SAC is also school-based. Often, schools use one or more periods combined, depending on how long each of your periods last. Teachers can ask you to write anywhere from 800 to 1000 words for your essay (keep in mind that itâs about quality, not quantity!)\n\nIn your exam, you get a whopping total of 3 hours to write 3 essays (Text Response, Comparative and Language Analysis). The general guide is 60 minutes on Text Response, however, it is up to you exactly how much time you decide to dedicate to this section of the exam. Your Text Response essay will be graded out of 10 by two different examiners. Your two unique marks from these examiners will be combined, with 20 as the highest possible mark.\n\n4. How To Prepare for Your Text Response SAC and Exam\n\nPreparation is a vital component in how you perform in your SACs and exam so itâs always a good idea to find out what is your best way to approach assessments. This is just to get you thinking on the different study methods you can try before a SAC. Here are my top strategies (ones I actually used in VCE) for Text Response preparation that can be done any time of year (including holidays - see How To Recharge Your Motivation Over the School Holidays for more tips):\n\na) Reread your book (or rewatch the film)\n\nAfter all the learning and discussion youâve had with your teacher and peers, you should have now developed a solid foundation of knowledge. Rereading a book enables you to refresh your memory on subplots, popular passages and most importantly, helps you fill in any missing gaps in knowledge. Take this as an opportunity to get familiar with the parts of the texts you're less confident with, or to examine a particular theme that you know you're weaker in (HINT: A good place to start is to make sure you know the difference between themes, motifs and symbols!)\n\nb) Do a close analysis\n\nThis is like an advanced version of rereading a book. A 'close analysis' - a term stolen from VCE Literature (thanks Lit!) - is basically where you select a passage (a short chapter or a few pages), and analyse it in detail.\n\nAs you move through the passage, you can pick out interesting word choices made by the author and try to interpret why they have made this choice. Doing a close analysis will immensely strengthen your metalanguage analysis skills, and also give you the opportunity to stand out from other students because you can offer unique and original analysis and evidence in your essay. I know this can be a bit confusing, so this video below shows a full close analysis of a Macbeth passage in action:\n\nc) Read and watch Lisa's Study Guides' resources\n\nDoing this study all by yourself can be rather daunting, so we've got your back. We specialise in supporting VCE English by creating helpful videos, study guides and ebooks. Here are some just to get your started:\n\nYouTube Videos\n\nWe create general Text Response advice videos like this:\n\nWe also create text-specific videos:\n\nAnd if you just need general study advice, we've got you covered too:\n\nCheck out our entire YouTube channel (and don't forget to subscribe for regular new videos!).\n\nStudy Guides\n\nOur awesome team of English high-achievers have written up study guides based on popular VCE texts. Here's a compilation of all the ones we've covered so far:\n\nAfter Darkness by Christine Piper\n\nCosi by Louis Nowra\n\nââExtinction by Hannie Rayson\n\nâFlames by Robbie Arnott\n\nFalse Claims of Colonial Thieves by Charmaine Papertalk Green and John Kinsella\n\nâGo Went Gone by Jenny Erpenbeck\n\nâLike a House on Fire by Kate Kennedy\n\nâMeasure for Measure by William Shakespeare\n\nâOld/New World Selected Poems by Peter Skrzynecki\n\nââOn The Waterfront by Elia Kazan\n\nâRansom by David Malouf\n\nâRear Window by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nâRunaway by Alice Munro\n\nâStation Eleven by Emily St John Mandel\n\nSunset Boulevard by Billy Wilder (Analysis of Film Techniques)\n\nSunset Boulevard by Billy Wilder (Incorporating Cinematic Features into your VCE Essay)\n\nâThe Crucible by Arthur Miller\n\nâThe Complete Maus by Art Spiegelmanâ\n\nThe Erratics by Vicki Laveau-Harvie (Setting)\n\nThe Erratics by Vicki Laveau-Harvie (Breakdown of Themes & Quotes)\n\nââThe Golden Age by Joan London\n\nâThe Lieutenant by Kate Grenville\n\nâThe Secret River by Kate Grenville\n\nThe White Girl by Tony Birch\n\nâTo Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee\n\nâWilliam Wordsworth: Poems Selected by Seamus Heaney\n\nââWomen of Troy by Euripides (Don Taylor's version)\n\nâYear of Wonders by Geraldine Brooks\n\nTip: You can download and save many of these study guides for your own study use! How good is that?\n\neBooks\n\nAnd if that isn't enough, I'd highly recommend my How To Write A Killer Text Response ebook.\n\nMost people seem to the think the most difficult part of Text Response is the writing component - and they're not completely wrong. However, what I've found is that not even students place emphasis on the brainstorming, preparation and planning of Text Response.\n\nThink about it - if you don't come to the table with the best ideas, then how can you expect your essay to achieve A+? Even if you write an exceptional essay, if it doesn't answer the prompt, your teacher won't be sticking a smiley face on your work. We need to avoid these common teacher criticisms, and I have no doubt you've experienced at least once the dreaded, 'you're not answering the prompt', 'you could've used a better example' or 'more in-depth analysis needed'.\n\nEnter my golden strategy - the THINK and EXECUTE strategy. This is a strategy I developed over the past 10 years of tutoring, and I've seen my students improve their marks every time. The THINK and EXECUTE strategy breaks up your Text Response into two parts - first the THINK, then the EXECUTE. Only with the unique THINK approach, will you then be able to EXECUTE your essay to its optimum potential, leading yourself to achieve those higher marks.\n\nTo learn more about the THINK and EXECUTE strategy, download my ebook sample on the shop page or at the bottom of this blog, or check out the video below:\n\nâd) Get your hands on essay topics\n\nOften, teachers will provide you with a list of prompts to practice before your SAC. Some teachers can be kind enough to hint you in the direction of a particular prompt that may be on the SAC. If your teacher hasnât distributed any, donât be afraid to ask.\n\nWe have a number of free essay topics curated by our team at LSG, check some of them out. Also go scroll back up to our list of study guides above, as most of those also have essay prompts included:\n\nââAll the Light We Cannot See Essay Topics\n\nâLike a House on Fire Essay Topicsâ\n\nâThe Handmaid's Tale Essay Topicsââ\n\ne) Brainstorm and write plans\n\nOnce you've done some preliminary revision, it's time to write plans! Plans will help ensure you stick to your essay topic and have a clear outline of what your essay will cover. This clarity is crucial to success in a Text Response essay.\n\nDoing plans is also an extremely time-efficient way to approach SACs. Rather than slaving away hours upon hours over writing essays, writing plans can will save you the burnout and will get you feeling confident faster.\n\nI've curated essay topic breakdown videos based on specific VCE texts. In these videos, I explore keywords, ideas and how I'd plan an essay with corresponding examples/evidence.\n\nf) Write essays\n\nYes, sad, but itâs a fact. Writers only get better by actually writing. Even if you just tackle a couple of essays then at least you will have started to develop a thinking process that will help you to set out arguments logically, utilise important quotes and time yourself against the clock. It will help you write faster as well â something that is a major problem for many students. With that said, let's get into how to write a Text Response next.\n\nTake a look at some of the essays our amazing LSG team have written:\n\nAfter Darkness Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nâExtinction A+ Essay Topic Breakdown\n\nâStation Eleven Essay Topic Breakdownââ\n\nWomen of Troy Essay Topic Breakdownâ\n\nIf you need any more tips on how to learn your text in-depth, Susan's (English study score 50) Steps for Success in Text Study guideÂ provides a clear pathway for how to approach your text and is a must read for VCE English students!\n\nAnd, if you're studying a text you hate (ugh!) be sure to check out Lavinia's guide which teaches you how to do well even when you don't like your text!\n\n5. How To Write a Text Response\n\nBefore you start writing, make sure you're familiar with The Five Types of Text Response Prompts. Understanding the different types will help you move beyond a 'basic' one-size-fits-all structure.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn an introduction, you're expected to have the following:\n\nContext (or background)\n\nAuthor's name\n\nTitle of text\n\nContention\n\nMain arguments\n\nHere's an example from Vindhya (English study score 46), in her post Dissecting an A+ Essay Using 'The Golden Age' by Joan London:\n\nPerhaps nothing exemplifies the power of love and recognition more than the bond between Albert Sutton and his older sister, Lizzie, in Joan Londonâs âThe Golden Ageâ. Many of Londonâs characters exhibit suffering that requires compassion and support to heal and grow, to distinguish present from past. However, London explores the perspectives of such characters from different aspects of trauma, and emphasise that love and recognition do not always work to heal and mature. Frank Gold, the novelâs resident âsneakyâ boy who adjusts to newfound life in the Golden Age Convalescent Home seeks love as an adult, rather than eliciting sympathy as a supposed victim. Here love and recognition are unsuccessful in amending Frankâs troubles when given from the perspective of an outsider, a judgemental onlooker. In a similar sense, Ida Gold seeks recognition not from Australia, who she views as a âbackwaterâ, but validation in herself after having been ousted from her Hungarian identity. London, however, makes sure to emphasise the impact that Sullivan has on Frank Goldâs life. Sullivan, a boy only a few years older than Frank, seems content with his future, with his fate, despite his sacrifice of rugby and conventional life. There is a lacking sense of urgency for love and recognition in Sullivanâs life, rather, it appears that Sullivan accepts his fate, regardless of his fatherâs sympathy or support. Thus, London explores a myriad of ways in which love and recognition may or may not heal wounds inflicted upon individuals.\n\nTry to keep your introduction to the point. There's no need to prolong an introduction just to make a set number of sentences. It's always better to be concise and succinct, and then move into your main body paragraphs where the juicy contents of your essay resides.\n\nBody Paragraph\n\nMost of you will be familiar with TEEL. TEEL can stand for:\n\nTopic sentence\n\nExample\n\nEvidence\n\nLinking sentence\n\nIf your teacher or school teaches you something slightly different - that's okay too. At the end of the day the foundations are the same.\n\nEarly in the novel, London makes reference to Norm White, the resident groundskeeper of The Golden Age Convalescent Home. Norm White hands Frank Gold a cigarette, 'as if to say a man has the right to smoke in peace'. Here, there is a complete disregard for rule and convention, an idea that London emphasises throughout the text. This feature provides a counter-cultural experience for Frank, pushing him to realise that he is a strong human being rather than a mere victim. This is a clear contrast to the âbabyishnessâ of the home, and is used as evidence of true humanity in an era where society judged upon the unconventional. Frank yearns for a traditional Australian life after his trauma in Hungary; 'his own memoryâ¦lodged like an attic in the front part of his brain'. Hedwiga and Julia Maraiâs caring of him pushed him towards fear and reluctance to trust, yet also pressured him to seek acceptance in a world that ostracises him for his Jewish heritage and polio diagnosis. This here is why Frank desires a mature, adult connection â love that regards him as an equal human being. Frank seeks Elsaâs love and company as she too loathes being reduced to a victim, an object of pity. Frank thereafter uses humour to joke of his wounds; 'we Jews have to be on the lookout'. Elsa sees 'a look in his eyes that she recognised', thus their bond enables both characters to heal. London alludes that Frank requires love and recognition not from the perspective of a sorrowful onlooker, rather he longs to be recognised as a mature adult.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusions should be short and sweet.\n\nAlthough trauma is often treated with love and compassion, London details different perspectives on this idea. Whilst Frank Gold requires a specific kind of recognition, Ida and Meyer seek validation in themselves and their relationship, whilst Sullivan is at ease with his fate and does not yearn sympathy from his father.\n\nFor further detail from Sarah (English study score 45), read her advice on 5 Tips for a Mic-Drop Worthy Essay Conclusion.\n\nThat's it for the Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.

Plot Summaries\n\nSummary - The Hate RaceÂ\n\nMaxine Beneba Clarkeâs seminal novel, The Hate Race, follows the childhood and adolescence of its author, who is the main protagonist. The book is a memoir, meaning that it is based around a recollection of her life and filtered through her psyche and experiences.\n\nThe book begins with Clarkeâs family, British citizens of Afro-Carribean descent, moving to Sydney, New South Wales. They settle in the town of Kellyville, which is known as a âwhite picketâ community. Although these communities largely don't exist anymore, what they once described was suburban environments where only Anglo-Australians lived. As you can probably imagine, this immediately caused problems for Clarkeâs family, with suspicion from neighbours and racist interactions with other kids in the neighbourhood.\n\nClarke initially focuses on her experiences in kindergarten, revealing how prejudice and discrimination can be inculcated (meaning, âtaught toâ) in children even from such a tender age. Clarke meets her first tormenter - Carlita Allen. Carlita makes every effort to exclude Clarke from participation in usual preschool activities, hurling insults across playgrounds and calling her âdirtyâ. Literally, of course, Carlita is referring to Clarkeâs black skin colour, but, metaphorically, it reflects the deeply hateful implication that anyone with a dark complexion is inherently inferior and lesser than white Australians.\n\nThe bullying doesnât stop by the time Clarke reaches primary school. In fact, it intensifies, aided and abetted by teachers who consistently turn a blind eye to the constant, gut-wrenching racial abuse. One of the most salient (meaning, âimportantâ) scenes arises when Clarke is asked by a teacher what her parents do for a living. Upon informing the teacher that her mother is an actor, and her father is a Mathematics Professor - the first British citizen of Afro-Carribean descent to attend a British university - she is met with the patronising assumption that she must be lying. Surely black people wouldnât have the emotional and intellectual intelligence to perform such high-powered jobs? Clarke also develops eczema during her primary school years, leaving patches of lighter-coloured skin covering her face, and a newfound hope that, bit by bit, God is answering her prayers and making her white.\n\nIn high school, the racist rot sets in even further. Clarke develops a new habit for scratching her skin at night to the point of bleeding and bruising. Looking back at this experience, Clarke theorises that this was her bodyâs way of expressing her extreme discomfort with being black. It gives us a picture of how horrific racism can truly be, and the ways in which it forces minorities into believing that thereâs something wrong with them, instead of there being something wrong with the people hurling abuse in the first instance!\n\nIt is this stage of her life when Clarke deals with one of the most difficult parts of being a minority in a majority white country. Through her interactions with teachers, friends and boyfriends alike, she becomes deeply angry at those people who abhor racism themselves, but seem unable to step in when racist events are actually occurring. Clarke also deals with more nuanced experiences of racism - people who donât intend to be racist, but end up making insensitive comments anyway. Whether intentional or not, these comments still hurt, and are still part of the challenges of growing up black in a white country.\n\nNonetheless, Clarke continues to rise above the odds, becoming a prolific high school debater, maintaining her position at the top of the academic cohort, and forming a small but tight-knit group of friends whom she can trust.Â\n\nClarkeâs recollection of her childhood ends on a relatively abrupt note, with Clarke returning home to realise that her father has left the family for another woman. In a note to the family, he provides no explanation other than that he had a secret affair for many years. Suddenly, Clarke, her brothers, sisters and mother are left to pick up the pieces.\n\nIn the epilogue, Clarke is now an adult with a child of her own. Walking down Melbourneâs North Road, she reflects on the challenges and opportunities to which her child will be witness. Clarke portrays it as the dual sadness and happiness of knowing that, in Australia, her children will surely have access to more opportunity than in most parts of the world - but it will come at a cost. Namely, they will also have to contend with the remaining undercurrent of racism that, even now, still seeps through Australian society.\n\nThe unsatisfying end to the novel reflects the nature of racism and the experience of a minority growing up in a white country itself: there is no happy ending. Rather, life becomes a series of painful incidents interspersed with minor victories; those who stand up against racism, those who fail to do so and the hundreds of thousands of Australians who will forever grapple with a society that sees them as âlesser thanâ due to the colour of their skin.Â\n\nSummary - Charlieâs Country\n\nCharlieâs Country, an Australian movie directed by Dutch-Australian Rolf De Heer, follows the story of Charlie, a First Nations man living in late-2000s Australia.\n\nThe movie is set in the wake of the 2007 Northern Territory Intervention. As a bit of quick context, this was an action taken by the Commonwealth Government under Coalition Prime Minister John Howard to send Australian Defence Force troops into the Northern Territory. It came in response to the âLittle Children are Sacredâ report, which raised allegations of child sexual abuse and neglect of children in Aboriginal communities. The intervention also involved restricting alcohol consumption, quarantining a portion of welfare payments to Indigenous residents (with the justification that this would prevent it being spent on alcohol, pornography, cigarettes, etc.) and hefty fines as well as jail sentences for those forced to comply.\n\nIt is important to note that, throughout the whole intervention, not a single person was prosecuted for child sexual abuse or any related offence. Nonetheless, this intervention had real world, drastic consequences - and thatâs exactly what Charlieâs Country explores.\n\nAt the time of de Heerâs film, Charlie lives in a remote Indigenous community. Signs of the intervention are all around - alcohol is banned from most communities, many individuals face personal bans on procuring alcohol, police officers dot the streets and citizens live under constant watch. Charlie, on a surface level, is a fairly happy-go-lucky individual; he exchanges jokes with police, is friendly with other elders and people in his community and doesnât seem to do much else.\n\nAs always with a movie like this - thereâs a bigger story behind this all! Rolf de Heer takes us through an increasingly concerning image of Aboriginal communities in the wake of the intervention. Charlie visits his local housing officer and is unable to obtain a house. Here, we see that Charlie is willing to work and wants stable accommodation, but the government is unwilling to provide.\n\nGoing on a hunting trip with his friend, âBlack Peteâ, the two are stopped by police and have their guns, as well as the water buffalo they killed, confiscated. Yet again, two Indigenous men try to provide for themselves - but are stopped by a legal system more concerned with rules and procedure than listening to First Nations communities themselves. Charlie decides heâs had enough of having his every move and action monitored, and takes a stolen police car into the bush.\n\nAbandoning the car, he tries to live amongst nature for an unidentified amount of time. Cooking fish, performing traditional First Nations dances, painting on the bark and looking for shelter, Charlie finally appears to be home. Yet, as usual, itâs too good to be true - the extreme cold makes Charlie incredibly sick, and, before we know it, he wakes up in a Darwin hospital. After refusing further treatment from the white doctors who fail to understand Charlieâs situation and why he is so angry at whatâs happened to him, the predictable cycle begins again: Charlie returns to his community, they all share alcohol as a way of coping with their current situation and flee when the police come running to confiscate the liquor.\n\nCharlie isnât civil with the police this time. In a fit of anger - an outburst of emotion after decades upon decades of control and being denied access to any opportunity - he picks up a bat and smashes the police officerâs car window. Brutally beaten into submission, Charlie is imprisoned as the police officer remarks that he should never have 'gone soft on a blackfellaâ.Â\n\nDragged before the courts, Charlie is imprisoned for assault. When the judge asks him to make a comment, he gives a lengthy speech in his native language. For de Heer, this acts as a symbolic assertion of the First Nationsâ rights to their own culture, and a proud statement against the many governments that have continually placed barriers in the way of Indigenous Australians having the same opportunities as any one of us.\n\nEventually, Charlie is released on parole. He expresses a deep desire to go home - but also a sense of defeat. He resolves, in the end, to believe that even if he will always live under the watchful eyes of the Australian Government, he can at least fight back and contribute by doing his bit to maintain the many cultures of our First Nations Peoples. Charlie teaches young Indigenous boys traditional dances, speaking proudly of when he performed a dancing ceremony for Queen Elizabeth in 1973 at the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe movie ends with Charlie staring mournfully into the camera, almost looking at the audience themselves. There seems to be no happiness in his eyes - nothing left but a sense of sadness and resignation. I know that, upon approaching the end of the film, I started to feel the same sadness that Charlie so evidently shows us. Itâs a different type of emotion; one centered around the pain of knowing that we live in a country that still has not made peace with its past, and refuses to listen to the First Nations Peoples who know it best.\n\nCharlieâs Country exposes to us that Australia is a country where, even today, our First Nations citizens are not treated as equals. As such, de Heerâs film is a stark reminder that this state of affairs is not good enough - and that the responsibility for change doesnât just lie with politicians and decision-makers. Itâs our job too: and failure is not an option.\n\n2. Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas\n\nThrough discussing Themes, Motifs and Key Ideas, weâll gain a clearer understanding of some super important ideas to include in your essays. Remember that, when it comes to themes, thereâs a whole host of ways you can express your ideas,Â but this is what Iâd suggest as the most impressive method to blow away the VCAA examiners. Weâll be adhering to the CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy. While we donât go into detail into how to use LSGâs CONVERGENT and DIVERGENT strategy in this guide, Iâd highly recommend you get familiar with it by reading How To Write A Killer Comparative.\n\nConnection to Culture (CONVERGENT)\n\nBoth de Heer and Clarke offer a unified idea around culture: that being connected to oneâs culture is inherently good and positive, and should be encouraged. Letâs break this down.\n\nThe Hate Race and Charlieâs Country are both works that explore the challenges of individuals maintaining their culture in surroundings which would otherwise see them revert to the âstandardâ. In this case, because weâre talking about Australia, de Heer and Clarke take us through the same story of an overarching, implicit acceptance that the Christian, Anglo way of life is the norm. This standard has deep roots in the colonisation of Australia, and the resulting claim of sovereignty by the Crown. Even as this country has evolved into a multicultural land, it still bears the marks of a âEuropeanâ country; whether that be our British legal system, Anglo-American democracy or any of the other institutions we have taken from the Western world.\n\nIt is in this context that de Heer and Clarke go to special lengths to explain why people should be empowered to connect to their culture. To our author and director, culture is an essential element of who you are, and it is this identity which carries people through life. For Maxine, the shock of realising that she may be the descendant of African slaves, and had lived so many years without having any idea this may be the case, is drawn from the fact that she, as a child, feels incredibly disconnected to who she is. Clarkeâs memoir thus reminds us that âgrowing up black in a white countryâ is an experience that often results in minority children not truly learning about who they are. Travelling through life, Maxine is continually disconnected from her culture, to the point where performing âAfrican tribal dancesâ to the school is nothing more than a joke. Even in her own estimation, Maxine has internalised (meaning, sheâs adopted it herself) the view that her culture is irrelevant, and thereâs no real reason for her to properly engage with all its complexity and beauty.\n\nIf we consider Charlieâs perspective, his involuntary burst of tears at the hospital stems from a recognition that his people have been denied the free opportunity to embrace the worldâs longest-surviving culture; the First Nations traditions that date back 40,000 years. With his friend slowly dying of lung cancer, at that moment, the old man is more connected to the cigarettes that slowly sapped his life away than he is to the First Nations way of living. Unable to hunt, gather as a community, work the lands as the First Nations traditionally would or embark on any other activity that would keep them connected to their culture, this countryâs first inhabitants are instead told to abandon âthe old waysâ and embrace Anglocentric standards of life.\n\nIt is a shocking reminder that, without culture, people are left like driftwood swimming through a vast ocean. By that, I mean that people are left without an anchor through which they can independently experience the world. Instead, their understanding of themselves, their sense of self and their actions in life are all filtered through the preferences of the dominant majority.\n\nIntergenerational Disadvantage (DIVERGENT)\n\nWhilst Charlieâs Country and The Hate Race share many similarities in terms of the negative impacts of racism and prejudice, the texts carry different connotations when it comes to the notion of intergenerational disadvantage.Â\n\nTo explain this idea, letâs first define and unpack âintergenerational disadvantageâ. We could spend days talking about this, but, simply, intergenerational disadvantage refers to cycles of poverty and criminality that pass from generation to generation, worsening with time. Think of it this way: assume youâre a teenager - or at least still financially reliant on your parents. If your parents were to lose everything they owned today in a massive financial crisis, youâd be in big trouble too, right? Suddenly, that part-time job you had that was helping you save money might be the only income for the entire family. You might even have to drop out of school, TAFE or university to care for everyone, denying you a higher paying job in the future.Â\n\nYouâll have to work your tail off for years on end. Since youâre supporting an entire family, say goodbye to saving up for a house or to pay for your kidâs education in future. Your kids now have to start from square one with less opportunity than the people around them, meaning itâll be harder for them to succeed in life.\n\nWhen we apply this to Charlieâs Country, the analogy becomes quite clear. Charlie lives in a community where there is no opportunity. Because there are no jobs - and no real way to gain steady, meaningful employment - people fall into alcoholism, marijuana and anything else thatâll help them cope. Lung cancer and alcoholism shorten lifespans for people like the old man with failing kidneys, while no employer is going to waste a chance on those still living. There is simply no ability to âsucceedâ here, because the local residents donât see that thereâs anything worth working towards. Hopeless, unheard and disillusioned, it becomes easier for Charlieâs community to just accept their sorry lot in life than futilely work towards changing it.\n\nWe arenât made witness to this same cycle in The Hate Race. Instead, Bordeaux Clarke is the epitome of someone who has broken the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage; becoming the first individual in his community to attend a British university. Marrying a high-powered Guyanese actress in Cleopatra, the married couple represent success and a defiance of racist stereotypes, not the grinding poverty and disadvantage we see in Charlieâs Country. Although Maxine experiences terrible discrimination and prejudice as a child, there is always a sense that she will academically remain on top. Maxine uses the prejudice with which sheâs faced as a motivator, giving her the impetus to consistently emerge successful; whether that be in her schooling, cross-country running, as a debater or any other academic endeavour. Sure, she faces racism that inhibits her from always succeeding - the Lions Club competition is a great example of such - but this isnât so much about intergenerational disadvantage as it is about racism, plain and simple.\n\nUltimately, the difference between the two is a matter of emphasis. Itâs not that intergenerational disadvantage doesnât exist in The Hate Race, but more so that Clarke is choosing to focus on how even the most successful individuals can suffer from prejudice and racism. This in turn helps us to understand that racism impacts everyone, and we should never pretend it isnât a massive problem. Conversely, Charlieâs Country is all about social disadvantage, and explores how prejudice can prevent oppressed individuals from becoming successful in the first place.Â\n\n3. LSGâs Bubble Tea (BBT) Strategy for Unique Strategies\n\nWhy Is an Interpretation Important?\n\nYour interpretation is what English is all about; itâs about getting you to think critically about the essay topic at hand, to formulate a contention (agree, disagree, or sit on the fence) and argue each of your points with the best pieces of evidence you can find - and itâs something you might already be starting to do naturally.\n\nIn this section, we aim to help you develop your own interpretation of the text, rather than relying on your teacher, tutor or even a study guide (including this one) authorâs interpretation. By developing your own interpretation, you become a better English student by:\n\nWriting with meaning. For a text to be interpreted, you need a text and an interpreter (i.e. you!). Whenever we read a new text, our interpretation of a text is shaped by our pre-existing beliefs, knowledge and expectations. This should be reassuring because it means that you can leverage your own life experiences in developing a unique interpretation of the text! Weâll show you how this works in the next point.\n\nRemembering evidence (quotes or literary devices) more easily. If you know you admire a character for example (which is in itself an interpretation ð), you can probably remember why you admire them. Perhaps the characterâs selflessness reminds you of your Dad (see how youâre using real life experiences mentioned in Point 1 to develop an interpretation of the text?). You will then more easily recall something the character said or did in the text (i.e. evidence) that made you admire them.\n\nHaving an analysis ready to use alongside the evidence. As a result of Point 2, youâll be able to write a few sentences based on your own interpretation. Rather than memorising entire essays (weâve talked about this before) and regurgitating information from teachers, tutors, study guides and other resources - which can be labour intensive and actually detract from the originality of your essay - youâre approaching the essay with your own thoughts and opinions (which you can reuse over and over again across different essay topics).\n\nLetâs look on the flip side. What happens when you donât have your own interpretation?\n\nWhen you donât take the time to actively think for yourself - i.e. to think through your own interpretations (weâve talked about the importance of THINK in the THINK and EXECUTE strategy here) - when it finally comes to writing an essay, you may find it difficult:\n\na) to get started - formulating a contention in response to the essay topic is challenging because you have no strong opinion about the text,\n\nb) complete the essay - writing up arguments and using evidence in paragraphs becomes challenging because you have no strong opinion about the text,\n\nc) to score higher marks - ultimately, you end up regurgitating other peopleâs ideas (your teacherâs, tutorâs or from study guides) because you have (you guessed it) no strong opinion on the text.\n\nHaving your own interpretation means that youâll eliminate issues a, b and c from above. Overall, youâll have opinions (and therefore contentions) ready for any prompt when you go into your SACs or exams, which means itâll be easier not only to write a full essay, but an original and insightful one as well.\n\nYour Goal\n\nTo overcome the issues above, you need to be confident with your own interpretation of the text. This doesnât come naturally to a lot of students, and it makes sense why. After all, so many subjects reward specific answers (2 + 2 = 4), whereas English is tricky because thereâs so much more flexibility in what constitutes a âcorrect answerâ. Itâs scary treading the sea of different possible interpretations because youâll ask yourself questions like:\n\nHow do I know if my interpretation is correct?\n\nHow do I know if my evidence actually backs up what Iâm arguing?\n\nWhat if I disagree with my teacher, and they mark me down for a differing opinion?\n\nOr worse - Iâm not smart enough to come up with my own interpretation!\n\nLet me say that you are absolutely smart enough to develop your own interpretation, and Iâll show you how to do so in A Killer Comparative Guide: The Hate Race & Charlieâs Country with LSGâs unique strategy - the BUBBLE TEA (BBT) strategy. By following our step-by-step framework, you can be confident that your interpretation is valid, that it backs up your argument, and that most importantly, you wonât lose marks for it!\n\n4. Structural Features Analysis\n\nIn How To Write A Killer Text Response, we cover Metalanguage. A Structural Features Analysis and Comparison goes over a lot of the same material, and will help elevate your essays to the next level. Knowing quotes and themes is essential, but being able to pair that with analysis of the title, setting, narrator and overall structure - we'll cover title here - shows the examiner that you really know exactly what youâre talking about. This section will be especially crucial for metalanguage topics that are all about how Charlieâs Country and The Hate Race are structured, so, enjoy!\n\nTitle\n\nThe title of a text is always significant - and this text pairing is no different. First, of course, please do keep in mind that there is no universally accurate interpretation of what a title means. Iâm giving you my assessment, but the author and director could very well disagree themselves! Thatâs okay, because as long as we back it up properly, your interpretation is as valid as any. As always, thatâs the beauty of English.\n\nLetâs first unpack The Hate Race. What this title signifies is that, for minorities in Australia, life is constantly akin to a race. There is no rest, no comfort and no sense of home when your mind is preoccupied with all the ways you donât belong. Australia, as a colonial outpost representing the Crown in a region that is overwhelmingly non-white, was once proud of its discriminatory stances; holding itself as the 'White Manâs Paradise'. It is in this context that racism, for Clarke, is not just a reality that lurks beneath the surface, but rather, a guiding tenet of Australia since 1788. With this overarching narrative, it is also important to acknowledge that the mere experience of racism is immensely emotionally, physically and mentally taxing for Clarke, and all people of colour. Being denied a firm sense of self, and constantly being forced to justify oneâs own existence isnât easy, and becomes a ârace against timeâ to see who can cope and rise above, and who will be swept away along with the tide. This sorrowful reality is what engenders the never ending race against being consumed by such hatred, because, for non-white Australians, there simply is no other choice. If they stop running, they run the risk of being consumed by the hatred themselves and becoming so cynical and disillusioned that they forget their culture and accede to the Anglocentric, white majority.Â\n\nMoving to de Heerâs film, Charlieâs Country, the title reflects a simple reality: this is Charlieâs country. However, when de Heer speaks of âcountryâ, he is really talking about âCountryâ; the Indigenous notion of connection to and respect for oneâs traditional lands. Nurturing this connection is a sacred responsibility, and the film reminds us that, despite Charlieâs many trials and tribulations, the land on which he lives is truly his own. Throughout the film, Charlie maintains a keen awareness that what is happening to him is unjust, and, unlike Maxine, he doesnât need someone to convince him that he belongs. Whatever Anglo Australia does, it cannot change the continuing legacy of his people and their sovereignty. To Charlie, it is laughable to think that his Country - which the First Nations have nurtured and kept in common use for 40,000 years - could suddenly become someone elseâs property in less than 200 years. He may not have any legal authority under the Crown, and his people may be dispossessed of their sovereignty and authority, but this cannot and will not change the remaining truth of First Nations sovereignty. De Heerâs film title thus challenges us to confront our own perceptions of Australia and remember that we all live on stolen land.\n\nEssay Topic Breakdown\n\nAs with all our essay topic breakdowns, we'll follow LSG's THINK and EXECUTE strategy, as taught in our How To Write A Killer Text Response study guide. The LSG's THINK and EXECUTE strategy follows three steps in the THINK phase - Analyse, Brainstorm, and Create a Plan. Learn more about this technique in this video:\n\nâ\n\n'Iâm free now!' (Charlieâs Country)\n\n'My children are the descendants of the unbroken.' (The Hate Race)\n\nCompare the charactersâ understanding of freedom in the two texts.\n\nStep 1: Analyse\n\nLetâs break down the prompt. This is a quote-based prompt, meaning the quote must feature somewhere in your essay. Ensure that you have a good understanding of the place from which the quote is drawn. In this case, Charlieâs exclamation of joy features when he escapes to the wilderness and is able to cook, dance and provide for himself. The quote from The Hate Race is the last line of the memoir, with Clarke expressing the sentiment that her children belong in Australia and will be as strong as their parents.\n\nStep 2: Brainstorm\n\nThe next part is to establish the link between the quote and the topic. The essay topic at hand asks us how 'freedom' is understood, so we need to actually understand freedom itself in relation to the quotes provided.\n\nFor de Heer and Clarke, freedom isnât an abstract concept relating to rights, liberties and responsibilities. Rather, freedom is found when people have the ability to be themselves, own their culture and live their truth. For Charlie, that mainly relates to his right to live in his country and maintain the traditional ways of the First Nations Peoples. Clarke, however, is more focused on the balancing act of finding freedom through a multicultural society that includes all, and in doing so celebrates the contribution that all cultures make into the melting pot that is Australia.\n\nStep 3: Create a Plan\n\nThereâs no one correct way to structure your paragraphs for Charlieâs Country and The Hate Race. However, I find it consistently helpful to follow a chronological structure. This refers to going through events of the memoir and film in the order they actually occur, and finding unique points of analysis based around these chronological groupings.Â Â\n\nWe also need to think of examples and points of comparison. Base these around the themes weâve gone through, so you can easily identify DIVERGENT and CONVERGENT points of comparison. Iâll walk you through my thinking.\n\nParagraph 1 â unable to experience freedom because systems exist to stop individuals from embracing their own culture\n\nKellyville and Alice Springs are immediately established as communities where rules and standards of association are both made and enforced by white authorities. The types of authorities and the prevalence of this overarching system of control differs between The Hate Race and Charlieâs Country, but are not any less harmful.\n\nParagraph 2 â attempts at pushback are rebuffed, resulting in further punishment for the simple crime of failing to conform\n\nAnglo Australia maintains its dominance through an assumption that minority Australians and First Nations Peoples will not question their place. Thus, when there is even the smallest semblance of resistance, punishment is the only solution.Â\n\nThe difference here is that while Charlie wages an active resistance against white authorities, Maxine is moreso placed into submission by the repeated failure of her pleas to be heard by anyone in a position to change what is occurring. At the centre of both situations, though, is a desire to break free of white Australiaâs chains.\n\nParagraph 3 â finding cultural freedom is a slow process of change, but one that begins with self acceptance\n\nThere is no happy ending to either The Hate Race or Charlieâs Country. Freedom does not suddenly spring forth. Instead, our author and director elucidate that cultivating freedom is a slow process. For Charlie, that begins with embracing his culture again and seeking to keep it alive. On Maxineâs part, it is about refusing to be broken by her past, and instead using her trauma as a motivator to build a better future.\n\nIf you'd like to see the sample A+ essay we wrote up for this essay topic, then you might want to check out our A Killer Comparative Guide: The Hate Race & Charlie's Country study guide!\n\nIn your English class, you probably feel like your teacher is making stuff up. Moments where you think, âThe author canât possibly have meant thatâ. To your English teacher, the smallest details have major implications in interpreting the text.\n\nIn fact, you probably agree with jokes like this:\n\nThe Book: âThe curtains were blue.â\n\nWhat your teacher says: âThe curtains represent the characterâs depression.â\n\nWhat the author meant: âThe curtains were blue.â\n\nOr even this one...\n\nThe disconnect you feel between yourself and the teacher is not just because your teacher is stretching for something to analyse. Whilst the author may have meant something different to what your teacher thinks, this doesnât mean your teacher is strictly wrong. Context and the authorâs intention are two complicated considerations in English, and a whole range of study is dedicated to it. At the VCE level you must consider the context your text was written in, and the author who wrote it, but this shouldnât hinder your own unique interpretation of the text.\n\nBefore you begin reading, I'd highly recommend that you check out our Ultimate Guide to VCE Text Response.\n\nYour interpretation is more important than the author's intention\n\nIn 1968, Roland Barthes proposed a theory that has stuck with critics and academics of literature. âThe Death of the Authorâ claimed that the biography, views, or intentions of the author are not a part of the literary object.\n\nThe text you are studying in English does not belong to its author, but to the reader, and what the reader decides to make of that text is valid, as long as it is backed up with evidence (as your teacher will say). Barthesâ original essay is complicated, but at a basic level, âThe Death of the Authorâ says that the curtains are not only representative of the characterâs depression but could also represent the characterâs love of blue orchids.\n\nWhen we read, we automatically apply our own experiences, biases, and understanding of the world to the text. As such, each person is likely to interpret a text in different ways. This is a major part of studying English, as the critic (you) is more important than the authorâs original intention. The fact that a single text can give rise to multiple interpretations is the reason we study English; to debate these interpretations. When you are given an essay topic you are being asked for your opinion on one of these debates, not the authorâs opinion on their own work. If you were reading The Fault in Our Stars and claimed it romanticised cancer, you would be participating in the literary debate, despite going against John Greenâs original intentions.\n\nIn the modern age of mass media, the author is attempting to revive themselves. These are authors who attempt to dictate interpretations of their works after they have been published. The most famous of these is likely J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series. Rowlingâs twitter page adds many pieces to the Harry Potter canon and Rowling offers her own interpretations of the text. To Rowling, her intentions are the only correct ways to interpret her texts, and as such she shares them frequently.\n\nThis is not true, however, for any author. Authors are not the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to the interpretation of their texts. Despite having intentions and opinions on their texts, there is also evidence which counters their interpretations. Â\n\nWhen it comes to the debate surrounding the texts you study, you need to remember that the interpretation of the author is only one part of the debate. It is an opinion equal to everyone else involved in the debate. Imagine the author is on trial. They may have an opinion of the crime (or text), but so does the prosecution. You are the jury and must come up with your own interpretation of the crime. Whether it matches up with the authorâs intentions or not does not matter, as long as there is supporting evidence within the text.\n\nContext in VCE English\n\nBut what about the circumstances in which something was written? Every time you start a new text you are probably asked to research the time in which it was written, or what major political events may be relevant. Unlike the author, these factors are very important in interpreting a text.\n\nFor starters, a text may explicitly reference a certain event, and so understanding that event is key to understanding the text. An episode of the Simpsons may make fun of Donald Trump, and the writers assume we have the contextual knowledge to know who Donald Trump is, why he is important, and why the joke is funny. It is easy for us to understand this context because we live in the context.\n\nIf youâre studying texts from 200 years ago it becomes harder to interpret because weâre unfamiliar with the context. While you donât have to know the context of your text perfectly, understanding the cultural beliefs and major events will help you consider the text objectively.\n\nResearching the context of a text acknowledges that literature is a product of the culture and politics of its time. Its themes may still be relevant in the modern age, but it is difficult to fairly judge, critic, and interpret these texts if we do not consider the context in which it was written. A piece of literature will either follow or criticise the views and opinions of the time, and it is the responsibility of the reader to understand these views and determine where the text sits.\n\nOkay, so the text is a reflection of the time from which it stems, and is separate from the author that wrote it? Not quite. Counter to âThe Death of the Authorâ, the author is also a part of context, and this means certain parts of the author should be considered in interpreting a text.\n\nIf there is ambiguity in the meaning of a text, the authorâs personal beliefs may clear it up. If a character of a certain race is stereotyped and mocked, the meaning of this may change depending on the race of the author. If an author stereotypes their own race, they might be criticising the way other people see them, whereas making fun of a different culture is most likely upholding racist or discriminatory belief systems.\n\nIf you're studying VCE Literature, read The Importance of Context in Literature for some further info!\n\nDeriving Meaning From Texts in VCE English\n\nSo, what ARE the curtains?! What do they mean? Well, they're a metaphor, representing more than their literal role as curtains. But also, theyâre just blue.\n\nThe truth is whilst context and the author are relevant, we should try to gain as much from the text as possible before relying on the context to guide our interpretations. While studying your texts, it is reasonable to apply modern standards to your interpretations.\n\nShakespeareâs plays are a tad sexist, and weâre able to criticise that, despite Shakespeare writing in a different context. For more on studying Shakespeare in VCE, read How to Approach Studying Shakespeare. But it would also be difficult to appreciate the meaning of texts without the context, especially when the text is a response to a major event. At the same time, weâre allowed to expand on what the author has written. We are not confined to what the author meant to say when we interpret texts. As an English student you have the opportunity to consider what each word may represent for the characters and how it influences your unique interpretation.\n\nSo, the curtains mean whatever you want them to mean. You can make reasonable assumptions about a text based on the context it comes from and from the authorâs life, but you shouldnât assume that something means nothing. Trivial things like the colour of curtains may not have been important to the author but allow us as English students to analyse and look deeper into the text, its themes, and the psyche of the characters.\n\nIn your SACs and exams looking at these small details and deviating from the authorâs intentions is an easy way to stand out.

So, when your teacher says the curtains are a metaphor, consider what else could be a metaphor, and donât assume the author has all the answers, or that there is only one interpretation."
