        "text": "A blistering fictionalized tale straight out of China, “A Touch of Sin” is at once monumental and human scale. A story of lives rocked by violence, it has the urgency of a screaming headline but one inscribed with visual lyricism, emotional weight and a belief in individual rights. You can feel the conviction of its director, Jia Zhang-ke — one of the few filmmakers of any nationality who weighs the impact of social and political shifts on people — in every shot. In “A Touch of Sin,” the world isn’t an amorphous backdrop, pretty scenery for private dramas, it is a stage on which men and women struggle to fulfill basic moral obligations, including recognizing one another’s humanity.\n\nDivided into four main sections, each centered on a different character, the movie opens near a northern town where a man in a green army coat, Dahai (an imposing Jiang Wu), has started a solitary campaign against the village chief and the local boss, who have grown rich selling collective property. Most of the villagers turn away from Dahai and his protests, laughing and grimacing by turns, seemingly resigned to what some might be called fate. Mr. Jia, however, is interested in forces beyond the providential. What concerns him are people who, caught in the jaws of historical change, are battered, exploited and dehumanized by others who now value only things, like the private plane that the big boss buys and the Maserati that he parks unlocked in front of his factory.\n\nShiny totems of the new China, these luxury items are in striking contrast to the village’s forlorn statue of Mao (representative of a fading belief system) and its Buddhist temple (symbol of yet older beliefs), at which Dahai takes a brutal, lonely stand. Yet while he is very much a man alone, his presence, fight against corruption and convictions rise like ghosts later in the movie, when prostitutes working in a luxurious nightclub march out in Vegas-style versions of Red Army uniforms that are perverse mockeries of Dahai’s humble coat. In some movies, such connecting moments can be quasi-mystical and sentimental (we are the world) and tend to gut whatever political point hovers in the vicinity. Here, the characters are connected by their existential reality of being alive in contemporary China.\n\nDahai’s story is followed by that of Zhou San (the quietly chilling Wang Baoqiang), who rides into the movie on a motorcycle wearing black and a Chicago Bulls watch cap. He’s returning to his home in Chongqing, a huge southwestern city on the upper Yangtze River that’s set against the scarred beauty of the mountainous Three Gorges region, now the site of the largest hydroelectric project in the world. Here, high-rises pierce the hazy sky and peasants grow vegetables on riverbanks. No one seems happy to see Zhou San, who pinches his son’s cheeks until the boy cries. His wife looks away; his mother looks through him. There’s menace in his every gesture but what they can’t know is that he has recently gunned down three men in what feels like a Hobbesian war of all against all.\n\n“A Touch of Sin” builds with implacable tension and urgency. This, Mr. Jia seems to be saying, is happening right here, right now. The eruptions of violence, some of it bloody, add to the intensity as do other filmmaking choices. Mr. Jia has long blurred the line between fiction and nonfiction through his use of digital cinematography, which helps convey a sense of documentarylike immediacy, and through real locations and nonprofessional performers working alongside trained actors. In his movies, characters feel as if they live in a world that’s so rapidly changing, so unsettled and destabilizing, that it seems the very ground under them is collapsing along with innumerable social, political and aesthetic frameworks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
