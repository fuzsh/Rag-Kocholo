        "text": "A Paraguayan housewife buys an erotic painting, seduces a Mexican artist, and tries to fellate her uptight Spanish husband all before dinner with the in-laws.\n\nInterview with Director Jean Lee\n\nWatch Original Sin (Pecado Original) on Prime Video, iTunes and HBO\n\nCongratulations! Why did you make your film?\n\nWe wanted to make an opportunity for ourselves by using the limited resources we had to create an entertaining and thought provoking first feature.\n\nImagine I’m a member of the audience. Why should I watch this film?\n\nBecause you'll experience 75 minutes of entertainment and laughter!\n\nHow do personal and universal themes work in your film?\n\nOne theme that the film explores is the concept of relief: relief from being different than everyone around you, relief from societal expectations of gender, race and class…even relief from your own repressed feelings. And I think that this kind of relief is a type of freedom that everyone can relate to and that everyone longs for. Especially women.\n\nHow have the script and film evolved over the course of their development?\n\nOne aspect of the script that evolved organically was Luis's character (the painter). We had a general idea of who he was, but it suddenly became very clear after we met the Paraguayan artist, Cacho Falcon. Cacho is this deeply sensitive, brilliant, and thoughtful painter who puts a lot of himself into his work. As we learned more about Cacho's personal story and his art (the painting in the film is one of his creations), we were so inspired, and Luis's character suddenly took on this new life!\n\nWhat type of feedback have you received so far?\n\nOverall, people have felt moved, especially by the ending, which is always great to hear. I've also sat with a few audiences and heard lots of laughter, which is always great!\n\nHas the feedback surprised or challenged your point of view?\n\nSome people who loved the film have asked for more content and have taken interest in our next projects! You always hope to hear that, but it's nonetheless surprising.\n\nWhat are you looking to achieve by having your film more visible on www.wearemovingstories.com?\n\nBecause we are an independent film with no star power in front or behind the camera, opportunities to gain more exposure and visibility like this one are important in promoting the film!\n\nWho do you need to come on board (producers, sales agents, buyers, distributors, film festival directors, journalists) to amplify this film’s message?\n\nSales Agents, Buyers, Distributors, Film Festival Directors, and Journalists!\n\nWhat type of impact and/or reception would you like this film to have?\n\nIn serious times like these, it's important for comedy to both entertain and raise dialogue. Thus, through our film, we hope to bring our audiences joy and laughter, and incite some lively conversations!\n\nWhat’s a key question that will help spark a debate or begin a conversation about this film?\n\nIn the film, the two main characters' relationship is at jeopardy, so a lot of people wonder throughout the film: will Eva and Adrian end up together?\n\nWould you like to add anything else?\n\nRecently, someone asked me about the significance of ending the film with with a prayer. I don’t think I answered that well so I’ll take the opportunity to do it here!:\n\nThroughout the film, the characters go through a rebellion. Part of this rebellion is that they push back against the austerity of institutionalized religion. By openly pursuing their desires, and confronting their pain for the first time (albeit in an imperfect or broken way), they end up gaining a clearer understanding of love, their marriage, forgiveness, and God. So I wanted to show that in a prayer - that their eyes have been opened to these things, and that at the end of the day, they are still people of faith, and perhaps that by learning and growing from their mistakes, their faith has been strengthened.\n\nWhat other projects are the key creatives developing or working on now?\n\nI'm in post-production on a Sci Fi YA short film called STRONG, which is a proof-of-concept for a series, and is supported by grants from Google & the Sundance Institute. I'm also developing a horror-comedy feature film called Killer Sex Doll written by Teddy Cecil, which I'll be directing sometime next year.\n\nFinally, Maia Nikiphoroff (the co-writer for Original Sin) and I are working on another absurdist comedy, even funnier and crazier than Original Sin. It's a Korean-Latina anthology series about women in desperate pursuit of happy endings!\n\nInterview: October 2018\n\nORIGINAL SIN (PECADO ORIGINAL)\n\nA Paraguayan housewife buys an erotic painting, seduces a Mexican artist, and tries to fellate her uptight Spanish husband all before dinner with the in-laws.\n\nLength: 75 Minutes.\n\nDirector: Jean Lee\n\nProducer: Maia Nikiphoroff, César Di Bello, Cacho Falcon\n\nWriter: Jean Lee & Maia Nikiphoroff\n\nAbout the writer, director and producer:\n\nJEAN LEE (writer, director) is a writer/director focusing on world cinema.
