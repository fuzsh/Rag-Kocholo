Interdisciplinary critical theory is an important tool in literary analysis for this course.\n\nAn intensive examination of a selected subfield of French and Francophone literary studies, with emphasis on student research using primary sources and secondary critical sources as well as presentations. Studying representative works of the subfield, students will learn to situate and analyze these texts within the historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts within which they were produced, while applying modern literary theories to the interpretation. A representative sample of topics would include: Poetry of the French Renaissance, The Enlightenment in Light of Colonialism, Francophone Africa, The 19-Century French Novel, and French-English Translation.\n\nThe Capstone Experience in Linguistics is a detailed exploration of a branch of French linguistics. The course includes an evaluation of recent publications to determine whether the findings correspond with existing frameworks. Students will work with data and articles by authors from a wide spectrum of Francophone countries in order to contribute to the global discussion around the French language. They will also analyze gaps in current models and identify potential solutions. Sample topics include Grammaticalization, Language Contact and Creolization, Francophone Dialectology, Romance Morphology, and Lexical Reconstruction.\n\nGerman 101 is an introductory course for students with no previous experience studying German. The course introduces students to the language and culture of the modern German-speaking world. Every effort is made to present opportunities to use the language: for self-expression in everyday situations, for basic survival needs in German-speaking language communities, and for personal enjoyment. To this aim, each lesson centers on linguistic, communicative, and cultural goals, reflecting language competency at the beginner (A1) level. At the center of the course is the overarching theme of friendship and relationships with others, a theme explored across each of the four chapters through such topics as: school and university life, sports and recreational activities, family and friends, and food culture. Throughout the semester, students will develop deeper understanding of these topics through the genre of conversation. Class instruction and assignments will provide students with opportunities to practice and receive feedback on basic conversational skills in German.\n\nGerman 102, a second-semester German course, continues instruction begun in German 101. By the end of German 102, students will be familiar with most basic structures of the German language and will have developed basic cultural knowledge about the German-speaking world. As vocabulary and grammar sophistication grow, students will become increasingly proficient at expressing their thoughts, feelings, and opinions on a variety of subjects related to everyday life. To this aim, each lesson centers on linguistic, communicative, and cultural goals, reflecting language competency at the advanced beginner (A2) level. At the center of the course is the overarching theme of home and away, a theme explored across each of the four chapters through such topics as: celebrations and life events, living spaces and household routines, travel and vacation, transportation, and technology and communication. Throughout the semester, students will develop deeper understanding of these topics through the genre of storytelling, as they recount past holidays, read popular children’s stories, and narrate past vacations. Class instruction and assignments will provide students with opportunities to practice and receive feedback on sharing stories with others in German.\n\nThis course is an introductory course that combines the first- and second-semester German courses in an intensive format. No previous German language study is required. The course is well-suited for highly motivated students and those interested in refreshing knowledge of foundational grammar and vocabulary structures. By the end of German 103, students will be familiar with most basic structures of the German language and will have developed basic cultural knowledge about the German-speaking world.

Organized topically using a content-based approach to language instruction, the course helps students develop their German across the three communicative modes (interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational), while expanding their understanding of social, historical, and cultural aspects of the German-speaking world. An overarching theme for the course is our relationship to the world, a theme that is explored across three chapters through such topics as health and well-being, living in cities, and work and career. Embedded within each of the chapters is an extended film unit that delves more deeply into these topics (i.e., health, city life, and work) through the lens of contemporary German film. In the course, students will learn how to critically read, talk, and write about these critically acclaimed films in German. Tasks in the course will help students to develop their ability to narrate, describe, and evaluate different aspects of film as well as other related text types.\n\nGerman 202 is a fourth-semester, intermediate German course that builds on language abilities acquired in German 201 (or equivalent) and reflects language competency of an emerging independent user (A2-B1). Using a content-based approach to language instruction, the course helps students expand and refine their German across the three communicative modes (interpretive, interpersonal, and presentational) as they engage with the topic of popular German music. The course takes a historical approach to this topic, beginning with the jazz age and ending with contemporary music in the German-speaking world. In learning about pop and rock music, students will learn about key events in modern German history through the lens of German youth culture. The course draws on a range of authentic texts (e.g., songs, music videos, podcasts, newspaper articles, documentaries, and full-feature films) to help students develop extensive content knowledge of Germany’s rich past and present musical landscape while improving their German. Tasks in the course involve recounting biographies of musicians and musical groups, describing historical events, musical periods, and genres, interpreting and describing songs as cultural artifacts, and creating integrated language-culture lessons involving popular songs.\n\nCourse introduces students to basic linguistic concepts as they apply to German and language generally. What are the different kinds of German spoken by different speakers in varied places? Why are there different kinds of German used? We will also examine the sounds of German (phonology), word parts (morphology), how the parts stream together (syntax), lexicon, semantics, and how German fits in in the broader world.\n\nMuch like mythology of ancient Greece and Rome, Germanic mythology provides a rich abundance of traditional stories that help students better understand and appreciate the history, attitudes, and aesthetics that developed within the Western cultural heritage. Throughout history, Germanic mythology has provided powerful visions of nature and the cosmos, justice and injustice, communities and individuals, power and helplessness, life and death, and values and ethics. These are universal themes that we still explore today, and part of the power of myth has been its ability to provide a space for people throughout the history of western civilization and in the present day to renegotiate their positions on those topics.\n\nGerman 264 is a survey in English of German literary masterpieces from the Middle Ages to the period around 1800. This semester we will read the highly influential epic poem from German medieval literature – Nibelungenlied; a picaresque novel from the Early Modern period – The Life of Courage; an essay on the question “What is Enlightenment?” by the eighteenth-century philosopher Immanuel Kant; Gotthold Emphraim Lessing’s increasingly topical “dramatic poem” urging religious toleration – Nathan the Wise; a tragedy by Friedrich Schiller which banned throughout German-speaking Europe for its seemingly controversial message – The Robbers; and we will finish with what is often regarded as the most canonical text of German literature– Goethe’s Faust I. We will also examine the impact these literary works have had and still have on German culture, including art, music and film.\n\nThis course emphasizes review and further development of communication skills, and includes readings of literary, cultural, and/or historical texts in German. Students will continue to practice all four skills (writing, reading, speaking and listening), but the focus will be on improving conversational and writing skills.

From the gladiator arenas of the ancient empire to the terrorism of the 1970s, from predictions of the city’s divine castigation to the futurists’ desire to symbolically blow the place up, the history of Rome across the centuries has been one peppered with violence of diverse forms, motivations, and consequences. In this class, students will approach the major periods and problems of Roman history (antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Roman Inquisition, the Napoleonic era, the Interbellum period, Nazi occupation, and the era of modern terrorism) through the lens of brutality as a historical, social, literary, and artistic phenomenon in Rome and the regions that fell under its control. Combining close readings of literary texts and the study of artistic, performative, and musical works and film, along with the consideration of select scholarly histories, students will explore the different shapes violence takes and why, from the legendary, spectacular, and aesthetic to the religious and apocalyptic, from war, authoritarianism, torture, and terrorism to satire and regeneration. Taught in English.\n\nFrom its local origins in Sicily, the Mafia has become a global phenomenon and a widespread model of organized crime that threatens and corrupts the international economy, political systems, and social environments. Although its power and underworld activities affect legal business, control illegal traffic, and trample human rights, a romanticized and even heroic vision of the Mafia nevertheless persists in film, television, and literature. This class explores the history of the Mafia and efforts to combat it from the nineteenth century until today, setting the realities of organized crime against the representations of it found in American and Italian movies, novels, and media. We will not only challenge the stereotypes through which cultural productions envision the Mafiosi but also, and more importantly, we will explore how the Mafiosi envision the world. Taught in English.\n\nOffered as a part of our “UA in Italy: Culture and Language” study abroad program, this class explores Italian culture from ancient times to the present through the lens of art, literature, music, history, and food.

By analyzing major moments in intellectual history, from the composition of Dante’s Inferno to the birth of humanism to the scientific revolution, this class also considers the role and importance of the liberal arts and suggests that in these centuries literature, art, music, theater, philosophy, history, and science were interwoven disciplines proper to man’s understanding of self and society.\n\nThis course presents a critical survey of Italian literature and culture from the 18th century to contemporary times. Ranging from essayistic prose to lyrical poetry, opera, novel, and film, the primary sources selected aim to provide students with a comprehensive outlook on the developments of Italian identity during and after the process of national unification. This course places particular emphasis on the transnational dimension of Italian culture, its complex web of connections with other world cultures, and the ways in which foreign contact contributed to the shaping itself of a national consciousness.
