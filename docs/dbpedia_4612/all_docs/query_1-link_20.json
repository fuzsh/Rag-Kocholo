        "text": "1852, Wales: a desperate young mother carries out a forbidden ritual to save the soul of her unbaptised dead baby, but is tricked into taking on a terrifying supernatural burden.\n\nSet in the 1850s, The Sin-Eater is a Gothic supernatural period drama about 'sin-eating', a little known but real ritual in Wales and the borders. Filmed in Welsh and English, the film is set for release in 2023, and we intend to premiere it at Oscar/Bafta qualifying festivals, as well as popular genre festivals around the world.\n\nThe Sin-Eater is short film with support from BFI NETWORK with National Lottery funds. We shot in November 2022 in North Wales and just need a little help to complete the film. We had issues with our VFX shots on the final day of shooting and need to do a reshoot to pick up those shots.\n\nAs we have already shot over 95% of the film we can let you know quite a bit of info on our astonishing cast and show you a little from the film itself.\n\nThe Sin-Eater is a high-end Gothic short, about a woman trying to save the soul of her baby. Jemima is suffering terrible grief and will do anything she can to save her boy, which gives us a very emotional film. Carly-Sophia Davies was the perfect Jemima, tapping into the impact of losing a child so early and the hope that the sin-eating ceremony might give her a glimpse of her baby again.\n\nThe film deals with several important issues including the power of a mother's grief, the place of a woman in mid 1800s Welsh society, the suppression of the Welsh language, and religious suppression by the Anglican Church of the time.\n\nAs you can see from our first images here, we're making a high-end short that brings the audience into the film with a sense of reality, allowing viewers to feel like the supernatural element of the film could be real. We hope that the film will have a real impact on its audience and leave them wanting more from the story...because we have more of this story to tell.\n\nBut we need to pick up our VFX shots...and we'd love to show you what they might look like but it would definitely ruin the film! However what we will say is that in our story sin-eating is real...and it's terrifying and not what you would expect. So when Jemima pays the price for Thomas's deception, it's both a heartbreaking and horrendous sight for her - and us - to witness.\n\nThe Sin-Eater has an amazing cast of Welsh and Scottish actors that share four Bafta Cymru awards between them. Carly-Sophia Davies (The Eternal Daughter) is our lead character Jemima. A new young mother who has just lost her baby boy and is tricked into taking on a supernatural burden by 'sin-eater' Thomas, who is played by Bafta Cymru Best Actor winner Jack Parry-Jones (The Crown). Three-times Best Actress Bafta Cymru winner Sharon Morgan (Gangs of London) plays Eliza, the matriarch of the family who will do anything to secure the succession of her family and is suspicious of outsiders like Jemima coming into the family. Eliza's son and Jemima's husband Richard is played by Gareth Jewell (Bang), who is torn between the love for his wife and loyalty towards his mother. Rounding off the cast is Lewis MacKinnon (Young Wallander) who plays the Scottish family priest Samuel, who is fairly new to this small Welsh parish and an outsider, and whilst he wants to help Jemima he knows he must abide by Eliza.\n\nThe core team have delivered many short films both for public funders and for TV and features as well.\n\nDIRECTOR - KELLY HOLMES\n\nKelly is a director with a love for telling genre inspired stories. She has had her films commissioned/broadcast on national French television, screened multiple award-winning shorts internationally at BAFTA/Oscar festivals, and is developing her first horror feature film YEAR OF THE HEART, a menopausal body horror with Sharp House/Gallus Films. She has participated in multiple talent schemes including the Reykjavik Talent Lab; won the JETS Co-Production Market at Berlinale in 2021, and was selected as part of Frontières Co-Production Market 2021. She also loves squirrels.\n\nYou can see the quality of Kelly's films in her showreel:\n\nSo what can you do to help?\n\nIf you can donate that's amazing but we appreciate not everyone has the money to be able to do that. But if you can share our project link far and wide and encourage people to have a look then that really does help and it means the world to us.\n\nWe want to ensure this film reaches as wide an audience as possible. To be able to see The Sin-Eater's story and to share Welsh language with as many festival audiences as possible.\n\nStretch Goal...£4,000\n\nIf we're lucky enough to reach our goal of £3,000 we'd like to try and extend to £4,000 to cover film festival fees. Film festivals are notoriously expensive for filmmakers to enter and we need every little bit of help we can get. We would like to get The Sin-Eater all over the world!"
