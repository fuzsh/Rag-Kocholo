        "text": "Fortress of Sin is a very interesting film for many reasons. One of which is that it tackles the critical epidemic of missing women, focusing on Indigenous women. I may be male, but I’m married to a Native American woman. I have two daughters and a granddaughter, so there’s a genuine fear in myself about something like this happening to someone I love. What would I do? To what lengths would I go to find them? They’re interesting yet dark questions to ask yourself, but it’s not an unreasonable question to ask in our current climate.\n\nFor weeks, the image of Gabby Petito was plastered all over the news, magazines, and the internet, but what about all the others? Thousands of people go missing each day, predominantly women, so why does the media pick and choose who to talk about? Fortress of Sin approaches the subject from a different perspective but still manages to raise awareness of a very serious issue that needs to be addressed.\n\nHarry (Paul Chomicki) is a down on his luck drunk who has grown estranged from his teenage daughter. He’s a failed musician who spends all his time drinking and doing odd jobs to pay for his booze. He’s paid a visit by his daughter Robin (Jama Bourne), who he blows off so he can drink. While in an alcohol-fueled haze, he receives a couple of text messages from her that he ignores, not realizing it was a cry for help.\n\nRELATED: Interview: Ricky He Talks About the New Horror Series ‘From’\n\nAfter talking with his ex Krista (Rae Hartwell), he learns that his daughter has gone missing. Harry hops in his truck and takes off in search of Robin. Sheriff Ritter (Christian Voss) has questions about Robin’s disappearance that leads him on his journey. While searching for his daughter, Harry meets another lost soul, Aiyana (Katie Otten), who might lead him to Robin. With everyone headed in the same direction, it’s only a matter of time before everyone collides head-on.\n\nThe film is directed by two of the film’s stars, Paul Chomicki and Christian Voss. Voss has spent just as much time behind the camera as he has in front of, though this is his first time as a director. Chomicki is better known as a comedic actor starring as Otto in the cult horror-comedies Caesar and Otto’s Summer Camp Massacre, Deadly X-mas, and Paranormal Halloween. This film is quite the departure for both, but they deliver an insightful film. Based on a story by Chomicki, the script was written by Voss and Dave Campfield, who may be best known as Caesar in the above-mentioned films.\n\nFortress of Sin moves at an insanely brisk, wasting no time getting things moving. With a runtime of 73 minutes, not a single frame is wasted. Now, this is both a blessing and a curse. It’s far easier to sell a low-budget horror film to a general audience than a low-budget drama, especially one with no recognizable actors (again, referring to a mainstream audience). By keeping the runtime short, just over an hour, it’s far easier to retain that audience until the end. Then there’s the cinephile audience (by far the minority as far as audiences go) who don’t care about who stars in it. They’re looking for something else, something more. Whether it is story or an indie talent they can follow, they are always looking for a diamond in the rough. There’s plenty for them to find in Fortress of Sin, but they may want a little more. By keeping it short, it may appeal to a broader audience. Cinephiles can enjoy and appreciate how hard everyone worked to bring this story to life.\n\nRELATED: ‘Freddy’s Nightmares’ Hits Streaming for the First Time Ever on Screambox\n\nSo, where do I sit on this film? I was captivated by the story and curious to see where it would go. I enjoyed seeing Chomicki take on a character opposite of what I’m used to seeing him do. The rest of the cast, Bourne, Hartwell, Voss, Campfield, and especially Otten, give solid performances. My only issue with the film was that I wanted more. There was more story to explore and more character moments to learn more about them and where they were coming from. Without giving away too much of the story, I was intrigued by the relationship between Harry and Aiyanna. It was sweet, sad, and deserved a little more time to develop. The same could be said for the relationship between Harry and his daughter. Modern technology is one of the greatest things to happen to indie filmmakers. A drone adds so much value to the picture with great aerial shots not commonly seen in low-budget films.\n\nI certainly applaud the cast and crew because what was apparent from the first frame was just how passionate EVERYONE was to make and deliver this film. It’s infectious and deserves respect and support from an audience. Making a film on a micro-budget during a pandemic was undoubtedly difficult, but they accomplished what they set out to do.\n\nWhile Fortress of Sin may be a fictional story, the idea and messages are important, and the filmmakers do a fantastic job of presenting and bringing awareness to it. In a 2021 article from KEVN News in Rapid City, South Dakota, they state that of the 50 women that went missing that year, 34 of them were Native American. 34 out of 50 sounds like an epidemic to me, and more should be done about this. Who knows where they are or who may have them. They could be runaways, or the darkness of human trafficking could have swallowed them. No one knows the truth.\n\nFortress of Sin may not be a perfect film, but it certainly has heart, and that’s most important. It makes you stop and think about what you might do in that situation, what you could do to help, and what sort of nefarious minds are behind the abductions of these women in a real-life situation. It was also a pleasant surprise to see the range of actors I’ve come to know as comedic performers move into the dramatic fare. I would have liked to have seen some more character moments, fleshing them out a bit more, but the film accomplishes what it sets out to do.\n\nThe film should be a constant reminder of the lost souls who need to be found and reunited with the people who love them. The film is a reminder never to give up and never to forget.\n\nAvailable on DVD from Wild Eye Releasing on June 7, 2022."
