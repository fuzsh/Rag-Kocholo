        "text": "A MEASURE OF THE SIN ( 2013 )\n\nI admit it. This one was a tough one to rate. Knowing that there's not really a 'Right way', and that everything falls to whatever ones personal tastes are, this one was still really tough. On one hand, I wanted to score it a 4 or 4.5 simply because the film makers here really had balls to create something like this. And by something like this, I mean that this flick, doesn't follow the 'normal' rules of film making. But, if you strip away the 'Artsy Fartsy' stuff would this movie still hold up? In the end, if the cool 16mm camera were taken away, if the surreal visuals were gone, and the attention to 'mood' shots was removed? Yes. There's still something here. And it's something worth watching. What makes this review so hard is that not everyone will appreciate the Art factor put into play here. And for those that don't, a lower score would surely follow suite.\n\nThis flick is a haunting one. And one that will leave you slightly uneasy by the end. A Measure Of The Sin doesn't attempt to water down a dark story, but rather add to the darkness using a lot of images and colorings. It'll send that chill down your spine. It did for me! Director Jeff Wedding should win an award just for making this film the way he did. 'Boo to the industry standards, he made what he wanted and it shows. Like I keep saying, A Measure Of The Sin is simply a great film to watch. Hell, turn down the volume and watch. It looks great! A good, dark story (Originally written by Kristy Nielsen), placed into a dark production usually always wins. And the cast have really outdone themselves as well. Katie Groshong nails her role. And watching Stephen Jackson and her sit across from each other, and the way they play off each other... really seals the deal. Everyone in this flick is completely real. No fakies here. High five and thumbs up ladies and gent. You should give some of the 'A listers' a few lessons.\n\nSo, with all the above and all my high praise why not the perfect score? Well. To be honest, again, this film isn't for everyone. If you're looking for an easy, straight forward kind of flick... This isn't for you. If you want to just turn something on and kind of half watch... This isn't for you. And put simply. The fact that A Measure Of The Sin took some real courage to make, for me, which is hard to explain, but that very fact has also lowered my score. The average Jane Or Joe may watch a few minutes and simply hit the stop button. And that's a huge thing when considering a rating. But for anyone who wants to be entertained, and sticks around, a real treat awaits. And for those who love films that take a chance and don't back down. You'll surely score this as a five.\n\nA Measure Of The Sin is not available yet to the general public. But watch for it!\n\nMy humble score for A Measure Of The Sin? A well deserved, and maybe a little more... 3.5 / 5.0"
