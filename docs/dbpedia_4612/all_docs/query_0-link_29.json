After the series of entrapments by the Security Service a confrontation between the opposition and the communists seems to be inevitable. Just before the proclamation of martial law a group of young Solidarity activists decide to play va bangue and organize a rash action to take out 80 million of the Union money from one of the Wroclaw’s banks before the account would be blocked. Security Service officers follow their steps. It’s the beginning of a gripping tournament in which also priests and curb dealers will play their parts. Each side has aces up their sleeve.\n\nWaldemar Krzystek - Filmography:\n\n\"W zawieszeniu\" (\"Suspended\") 1987, Awards: Best Debut Director Award at The Polish Film Festival in Gdynia (1987); \"Ostatni prom\" (\"The Last Ferry\") 1989, Awards: President of Gdynia Special Award at The Polish Film Festival in Gdynia (1989); \"Zwolnieni z życia\" (\"Dismissed from Life\") 1992, Awards: FIPRESCI Prize, Special Prize of the Jury and Silver Seashell for Best Actress Krystyna Janda at San Sebastian IFF (1992) \"Mała Moskwa\" (\"Little Moscow\") 2008, Awards: Grand Prix - The Golden Lion - and Best Actress Award for Svetlana Khodchenkova at Polish Film Festival in Gdynia (2008), People’s Choice Award at Moscow IFF (2009)\n\nProducer´s Filmography:\n\n\"0_1_0\" , 2008, directed by Piotr Łazarkiewicz (executive producer, co-producer) Awards: Polish Filmmakers Association Award at Polish Film Festival in Gdynia (2008); \"Zwerbowana miłość\" (\"Recruited Love\"), 2010, directed by Tadeusz Król (producer) Awards: Best Actress Award for Joanna Orleańska at Debut Films Festival \"The Young and Cinema\" in Koszalin, Poland (2010); \"Sala samobójców\" (\"Suicide Room\"), 2011, directed by Jan Komasa (co-producer)Awards: FIRPRESCI Award at International Festival of Independent Cinema \"Off Plus Camera\" in Krakow (2011); \"Maraton tańca\"(\"Dance Marathon\") 2011, directed by Magdalena Łazarkiewicz (co-producer);\n\nProducer´s Statement:\n\nWe would like to present hard moments from the polish history at the beginning of the 80’s in an unconventional way. ”80 million” tells about ordinary young people who were able to do extraordinary things.

In a country where stories of striking it rich are everywhere, anyone thinks such a thing is not only possible, but it’s easily achievable. The storyline follows two destinies: one is of a young couple that could have gotten rich and the other is of an old one who, because of their lack of knowledge when it comes to modern technology, gets fooled by e-mail spam. Finally we realize that the illusion of becoming rich puts ordinary people in extraordinary situations.\n\nDan Chisu - Filmography:\n\nDIRECTOR/DAN CHISU FILMOGRAPHY: documentary film \"Fata morgana\"– 1999 \"WebSiteStory\"- 2009 \"The Bear\"- 2009 \"Horses are green on the walls\"- 2011\n\nProducer´s Filmography:\n\nGIULIANO DOMAN PRODUCER:- TV Series:\"Virtual\", \"The Sailor’s Girls\" - documentaries:\"Nichita Stanescu\",2007;\"Noica\",2011 - \"Before and After 22/12/1989\",short,2009 - \"The Mother of God from the ground floor\",short,2010 - \"Lunch Break\",short film,2011 - \"Floating Things\",feature film,2009 - \"Horses are green on the wall\",feature film,2011 CO-PRODUCER:\"Tanti\",2008 DAN CHISU PRODUCER:\"Horses are green on the wall\",2011; \"WebSiteStory\",2009 CO-PRODUCER: -Short films: Dincolo, Zapping– Hanno Hofer; Ocolul Pompierilor– Cristi Mungiu -Feature films: \"The Famous Paparazzo\",1999;\"The Bear\",2009\n\nProducer´s Statement:\n\nThe two seemingly unrelated stories are in contrast. One explores the process of getting rich or better said the illusion of getting rich of two ordinary people without much knowledge. Although they are fair and honest, the power of money brings out most unexpected attitudes. Neither of the two would have behaved like this in normal circumstances. Money is the evil eye. Money makes friendships fall apart, family members to sue one another, sparks jealousies. But it is the main engine of our lives. The other story is about destiny and coincidence. It is a clear expression of the everyday life. It’s about life’s revenge against you for your superficiality and lack of attention.\n\nProducer: Giuliano Doman & Dan ChisuScreenplay: Dan ChisuCamera: Ovidiu GyarmathMusic: Paul IleaCast: Adrian Titieni, Tudor Smoleanu, Ionut Visan, Anca Florescu\n\nCONTACT AT THE FESTIVAL:\n\nDan Chisu / Producer of the film\n\nBucharest\n\nRomania\n\n[email protected]\n\nPhone at the festival: +40722408140\n\nWorking version of the film\n\nThe completed film will be available on DVD at the Video Room of the Film Industry Office\n\nKamfora / Camphor\n\n(This is the film’s working title and may change)\n\nDirected by:Filip MarczewskiPoland, 90 min, drama\n\nRelease date:TBCFilm is in postproductionThis film is director´s debut Film language:Polish/RomaniFilm´s website:www.akson-studio.pl\n\nFilm synopsis:\n\nThe scandalous, naughty, and sensual story of a forbidden love, set against the backdrop of a conflict between neo-Nazis from a local sports club and a group of Gypsies.\n\nFilip Marczewski - Filmography:\n\nFilip Marczewski.

The children lose track of time. They were expected home long ago. They drink, throw up and are intoxicated by love and \"the shameless, unbridled and licentious\" world in which David, Kateřina and Štěpán live. Childhood does not only appear as a central theme, but also frames its statements. The world of children is reflected in the world of adults and vice versa, giving them an \"adult\" alter ego, so we can imagine what will happen to them, how their lives will develop.\n\nOlmo Omerzu - Filmography:\n\nOlmo Omerzu (1984, Ljubljana) short films: 2008 THE SECOND ACT – Special Mention Fresh Film Fest Karlovy Vary 2008 - Meo Award for the Best Short Film – Estoril Film Festival, Portugal 2008 - Cinepur Prize – for the Best Short Film FAMU FEST Praha 2008 - Special Mention for Directing Portoroz, Slovenia 2008 - Special Mention for the Best Actress for Ivana Uhlirova – Festival Premiers Plan Angers, France 2009 2006 LOVE 2005 MASKS 2005 AT FOUR AFTERNOON 2004 NOTHING\n\nProducer´s Filmography:\n\nJiri Konecny is Prague based producer of fiction and documentary films, founder of the production company ENDORFILM.

Many years on, Garry returns to his native town. Everything feels alien and strange. Our hero comes back to recover his memories, the good ones and the bad ones, the pleasant ones and the painful ones. Will the old fortune-teller Nina, a well-known dream gatherer in the city, be able to set an already grownup man free of the chains of the past, which had become unbearable by that time? Or will the hero called Garry alleviate her life by discovering his freedom?\n\nGeorgy Paradzhanov - Filmography:\n\n2010 - \"Prima\" - documentary 2007 - \"Adam’s Children\" - documentary - Stambul festival 2005 - \"Let Our Days Be Long\" - documentary - Participant of the 62d Venice Film Festival 2004 - \"In Died In Childhood\" - documentary - Participant of the 57th Cannes Film Festival 2000 - \"I’m A Seagull\" - documentary - Participant of the 57th Venice Film Festival, the golde medal of the Lumiere brothers, Ministry of Culture of Russia award 1993 - \"Jado\" - feature short film - Locarno Film Festival Jury Prize 1991 - \"Burial Season\" - feature short film - Karlovy Vary Film Festival Grand Prix, Kodak prize \"For the best image\" at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Rimini Film Festival Jury Prize\n\nProducer´s Filmography:\n\n2011 - \"Everybody’s gone\" - feature film 2010 - \"Prima\" - documentary 2006-2007 - \"The Diaspora\" - a series of documentary feature films 2002-2009 - produced various television series and several TV movies 2001 - \"Just The Two Of Us\" - feature short film - Official selection at the Cannes Film Festival 2001 \"Certain Regard\"\n\nProducer´s Statement:\n\nThe film is under postproduction.
