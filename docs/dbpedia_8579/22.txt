Source code for http://www.luxinia.de game engine.

The project is not in active development anymore, this repository exists for archive purposes or if people want to branch from it.

Cross-platform libraries are used, however only MSVC2008 solutions and Windows 32-bit have been used for development.

Requires to be merged with http://www.luxinia.de/download/luxinia1support.7z which contains third-party code and dependencies. Pre-built for Windows 32-bit.

The SDK consist of multiple parts. If not mentioned otherwise, the bottom license applies (NET-BSD)

Released under MIT license.

luxplatform: Core lib for file operations and compiler specific defines/asserts

luxmath: Most vector math related functions are stored here.

luxcore: Some generic data containers and algorithms are defined here. The object reference system (smart/weak pointers) is also heavily used by luxinia.

The final runtime package (binaries) has its own license. The source of the engine uses either NETBSD or MIT style licenses.

base: The standard lua code that ships with any runtime distribution. Its source code is released under MIT license.

include & source: Actual engine source code.

luxinia_glfw: Standard exe that provides a window manager to luxinia. Luxinia's window manager is more or less identical to GLFW.

luxinia_lua: Allows you to define your own window manager through lua functions. GLFW is used for joystick input. Was used to run luxinia inside wxWidgets.

tutorials: The tutorials showcasing several engine features.

are found pre-built inside http://www.luxinia.de/download/luxinia1support.7z
