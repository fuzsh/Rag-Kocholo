hi everyone,

a new version of luxinia was released.

The package got 2 new demos. One for normal-mapping and one for tile-textured terrain.

Another main improvement in this release is the resource viewer, in which you can explore all of your projects resources (materials, particles, models, animations). Each category allows some functions on object manipulation, such as emitter values for particles...

The viewer can also serve as front-end to the file convertor, which now supports blitz3d files, too. (coming up next is .fbx).

Engine remains free for non-commercial use, and comes with documentation and several samples. You can always ask for help on our forums, too

Lua is a scripting language and used entirely for all games, applications... only the engine core is written in C, so as user you dont need to wrangle with compilers and such, just edit lua scripts.

(model and textures by Per128)

(just some random layers, tiles take neighborhood into account)

(2 layers, shows neighboorhood info better)

you can grab it along with the other demos at www.luxinia.de
