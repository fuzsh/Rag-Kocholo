        "text": "Author\n\n122\n\nAugust 01, 2006 05:59 AM\n\nDear Knowledgable masters of the gamedev universe, Small Question: with commercial engines like UnrealEngine, Source, and Doom3, if i had the source code and built it without game program code, would they create a .dll, or .exe? Or are game engines just libraries that you include with your game program code and build to create one final .exe? Thanks in Advance for the help Luzifyr\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat depends on the engine, some engines are compiled to an executable which then loads your game as a DLL. Others will allow you to create an executable and call functions from a DLL. I don't have any specific info on the engines you mentioned, but I believe the Source engine is actually a .exe, I'm not sure though, but both Half Life 2 and CS:S is called hl2.exe so I guess it just loads a DLL.\n\nI am no expert on 3d engines, but I'd say it pretty much depends on the engine.\n\n.dll's are libraries and they are usually used together with .lib's or other libraries. The .dll's are dynamically loaded libraries (hence .dll) or shared libraries.\n\nThe engines might be executables that load dll's that have the actual game content. Or they could be .dll's that the game (or the content) calls. I think this is called inversion of control (or IOC) by software engineers.\n\nThere are also engines that are distributed as executables and don't need any native code. Then the game content is in script files or similar. AFAIC, Luxinia engine does this.\n\nI don't know about the commercial engines.\n\n-Riku\n\n112\n\nAugust 01, 2006 06:16 AM\n\nIf you own a license to the engine you would get the project that builds the exe. Most engines would have an exe unless its a linux engine.\n\nHowever some engines (for instance Source and Doom 3) exe load the game code from a dll.\n\nWhen you create mods for these games you change the game code that is in the dll.\n\nIf you havent already you can download the Quake 2 or 3 engine source at http://www.idsoftware.com/business/techdownloads/\n\n124\n\nAugust 01, 2006 06:40 AM\n\nHi\n\nI don't know about Source, but Quake2 used to create a dll AND an exe. You could download the source code, build it, and replace the created files even in the demo (that was quite fun to play with, you didn't had to own the full game). I think that should apply to other \"Quakes\" too.\n\nUnreal (the first and UT1) created an exe for loading stuff, and had several dlls. That was the rendering code. You could download an OpenGL rendering engine in addition to the default D3D render. I never messed with UT2k3 or 2k4, however...\n\nThis way you could easily switch between D3D and OGL. As SilentKiller said, Quake loaded the game code from a dll, too, to make mooding easier. However, Quake2 had render dll's as well, like OpenGL, software, or good ol' 3dfx... :) If I remember correctly, everything apart from rendering and game code was in the exe (like the console, sound, etc).\n\nThis had another advantage, namely porting. With the public source of Quake, you get Linux code, for example (among others), but a lot of things remain the same.\n\n100\n\nAugust 01, 2006 06:42 AM\n\nFrom a dev point of view, what are the pros and cons of each method?\n\n-Chris\n\nAuthor\n\n122\n\nAugust 01, 2006 06:44 AM\n\nWould i be correct in saying that... engines such as the unrealengine is really actually a sdk that the developer would use to write their game code in, and then the engine would create an exe for the developer?\n\nso far I'm seeing 3 different types of engines, the library engine that you include with your game when you build it. the engine that requires the game to be a .dll (source, doom3). and the game engine that creates a final .exe for you.\n\nagain, thanks for the help.\n\n257\n\nAugust 01, 2006 06:58 AM\n\nthe game engine is just the comp. that are separate from the content or that which processes the content wheter it be dll, script, or exe doesn't really matter. but there are some back to each. say if i had wanted to play the games for free and i knew that the engine was dll well i could easily replace it same for exe\n\nBring more Pain\n\nAuthor\n\n122\n\nAugust 01, 2006 07:40 PM\n\nhow about the project offset engine? I looks as though it si a complete sdk that requires the developer to code their game in some form of script or what not instead of c/c++.\n\nFor advanced features like HDR lighting, would I need to create my own class in my game engine to enable it? or do i just need to implement directx support in my engine for HDR lighting to be possible for game developers?"
