        "text": "Hello I'd like to create a 3D Choice Based game with my friend, I have map making experience and will be learning C++ very soon yet I have experience is basic engine eg source-engine/lua for garry's mod workshop making.\n\nWe were wondering if we could get help in ways of making it, the best way we can. We have the time and can get some money.\n\nWe would like to create this game on the PC Platform and as of now have no idea what type of program/engine we need to base this off of. Or if we need to create one of our own.\n\nWe would like to create a tell-tale STYLE of game yet make a more original theme that we can create.\n\nExamples of what we want to create\n\n- The 3D Animations\n\n- The Popup choices\n\n- The integration of HUD\n\nand all the other parts of the game\n\nAny and all help would be appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading. If you need any more information just ask\n\nWe were wondering if we could get help in ways of making it, the best way we can\n\n- The 3D Animations\n\n- The Popup choices\n\n- The integration of HUD\n\nTell-Tale\n\nIt sounds like you want to create something akin to choose-your-way books with multimedia presentation.\n\nIf that is the case, you don't really need much programming, and there are 'engines' for simplifying the task.\n\nChose Your Own Adventure engine, Gamebook engine, or learn javascript and make your own.\n\nThis is assuming the 3D animations can be pre-rendered in a format that fits seamlessly into the resulting pages made with a product specifically for that purpose, Poser, Maya, etc.\n\nIf you need something that renders real time based on interaction than it will be something more complex.\n\nIf this is not your goal, more specific details will help others to provide you more useful assistance.\n\nIn your first post you said you were not sure what engines to use or even if you would need to make your own. With that reply it looks like things have changed.\n\nUnity is currently a popular engine, there are many good tutorials, books, and guides on how to use it. Ovicior had a good list of engines and technologies as well.\n\nI'm learning unity right now and I was wondering if I can be told the best way to learn the things I have above. C#?\n\nSo 3D Animations, UI and HUD development, and \"all the other parts of the game.\"\n\nYes, C# is the most frequently used programming language for that. Plenty of good books, tutorials, and support materials for that on the Internet if you need help on something specific.\n\nAnimations generally require models and animations, so you'll need to either find models and animations in the asset stores, or build your own. Those are both major disciplines on their own. If you've decided on Unity, once you have animations and models, hooking the animations up is a matter of building a graph that shows how animations are applied to your models and how they transition, then calling the right functions in code. It is well documented with the engine and there are many excellent tutorials if you get confused about it.\n\nUI and HUD programming both require UI art and UI programming, but the basic functionality is included in Unity and there are many well-built packages in Unity's asset store that can do quite a lot of amazing things. Similarly, with the large community out there it is easy to find good tutorials or Q&A on any specific topics if you get lost.\n\nHowever, \"all the other parts of the game\" is going to be a tough one. You'll need a lot more details for that. It probably includes things like music and audio effects in addition to programming, models, animations, UI art, VFX, and testing. If you don't have a solid background in developing games that is going to be a major exercise. That's the part of a game that feels like work and takes a long time, causing so many ideas to be abandoned.\n\nWell, I appreciate help! haha. I think I can figure out alot on my own with help of youtube/ books but I don't think I could figure out the choice factor which is like \"click w for option 2, a for 3, d for 4...etc and making that choice affect a later one. That's my biggest problem so any help with directing me in the right direction to that would be a ton of help. T"
