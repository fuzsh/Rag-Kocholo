Or you can grab a Mac Mini, the SDK's hardware requirements are quite light. I have two family members who have intel Macs and their own iPhones. So I would have ample testing opportunities even without owning either myself.\n\nI realize that, but that situation doesn't exist for me. Maybe later when my XNA port is content complete, it will make more sense to take the plunge."
