        "text": "Project Description\n\nZeroBrane Studio is a lightweight cross-platform Lua IDE with code completion, syntax highlighting, remote debugger, code analyzer, live coding, and debugging support for various Lua engines (Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Lua 5.4, LuaJIT, LÖVE, Moai, Gideros, Corona, Marmalade Quick, Cocos2d-x, OpenResty/Nginx, Torch7, Redis, GSL-shell, Adobe Lightroom, Lapis, Moonscript, and others).\n\nFeatures\n\nSmall, portable, and cross-platform (Windows, macOS, and Linux).\n\nWritten in Lua and is extensible with Lua packages.\n\nSyntax highlighting and folding for 125+ languages and file formats.\n\nProject view with auto-refresh and ability to hide files and directories from the list.\n\nBundled with several of the most popular Lua modules (luasocket, luafilesystem, lpeg, and luasec) compiled for all supported Lua versions.\n\nAuto-complete for functions, keywords, and custom APIs with scope-aware completion for variables.\n\nScope-aware variable indicators for Lua code.\n\nIntegrated debugger with local and remote debugging for Lua 5.1, Lua 5.2, Lua 5.3, Lua 5.4, LuaJIT, and other Lua engines.\n\nInteractive console to directly test code snippets with local and remote execution.\n\nLive coding with Lua, LÖVE, Gideros, Moai, Corona SDK, GSL-shell, and other engines.\n\nStatic analysis to catch errors and typos during development.\n\nFunction outline.\n\nGo to definition navigation.\n\nMulti-cursor editing with scope-aware variable selection and renaming.\n\nFuzzy search with Go To File, project-wide Go To Symbol navigation, and Insert Library Function.\n\nFind and replace in multiple files with preview and undo.\n\nSeveral ways to extend the current functionality:\n\npackages (packages/): plugins that provide additional functionality;\n\ntranslations (cfg/i18n/): translations of the menus and messages to other languages;\n\nuser configuration (cfg/): settings for various components, styles, color themes, and other preferences.\n\nDocumentation\n\nA short and simple overview for those who are new to this development environment.\n\nA list of frequently asked questions about the IDE.\n\nTutorials and demos that cover debugging and live coding for different environments.\n\nTips and tricks.\n\nInstallation\n\nThe IDE can be installed into and run from any directory. There are three options to install it:\n\nDownload installation package for the latest release for individual platforms (Windows, OSX, or Linux);\n\nDownload snapshot of the repository for each of the releases, which works for all platforms;\n\nClone the repository to access the current development version; this option also works for all platforms.\n\nNo compilation is needed for any of the installation options, although the scripts to compile required libraries for all supported platforms are available in the build/ directory.\n\nSee the installation section in the documentation for further details and uninstallation instructions.\n\nUsage\n\nThe IDE can be launched by using the zbstudio command with slight variations depending on whether a packaged installation or a repository copy is used:\n\nWindows: Run zbstudio from the directory that the IDE is installed to or create a shortcut pointing to zbstudio.exe.\n\nLinux: Run zbstudio when installed from the package installation or run ./zbstudio.sh when using a snapshot/clone of the repository.\n\nmacOS: Launch the ZeroBrane Studio application if installed or run ./zbstudio.sh when using a snapshot/clone of the repository.\n\nThe general command for launching is the following: zbstudio [option] [<project directory>] [<filename>...].\n\nOpen files: zbstudio <filename> [<filename>...].\n\nSet project directory (and optionally open files): zbstudio <project directory> [<filename>...].\n\nOverwrite default configuration: zbstudio -cfg \"string with configuration settings\", for example: zbstudio -cfg \"editor.fontsize=12; editor.usetabs=true\".\n\nLoad custom configuration file: zbstudio -cfg <filename>, for example: zbstudio -cfg cfg/xcode-keys.lua.\n\nAll configuration changes applied from the command line are only effective for the current session.\n\nIf you are loading a file, you can also set the cursor on a specific line or at a specific position by using filename:<line> and filename:p<pos> syntax (0.71+).\n\nIn all cases only one instance of the IDE will be allowed to launch by default: if one instance is already running, the other one won't launch, but the directory and file parameters passed to the second instance will trigger opening of that directory and file(s) in the already started instance.\n\nContributing\n\nSee CONTRIBUTING.\n\nAuthor\n\nZeroBrane Studio and MobDebug\n\nZeroBrane LLC: Paul Kulchenko (paul@zerobrane.com)\n\nEstrela Editor\n\nLuxinia Dev: Christoph Kubisch (crazybutcher@luxinia.de)\n\nWhere is Estrela?\n\nThe Estrela project that this IDE is based on has been merged into ZeroBrane Studio. If you have used Estrela for graphics shader authoring, you can use this GraphicsCodePack to get access to all API files, specifications and tools.\n\nLicense"
