The best way is to use metaphors from the real world.  • Example Lava metaphor since Super Mario  “Explosive” or “Flammable” marked objects  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 32 / XX\n\n34. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Configurable Game-Play Area Problem • Developers want to increase the fun in games to motivate players to play longer  Solution • Give players the opportunity to design levels or create mods  • Example Unreal Tournament (powerups, weapons, spawn points)  Command & Conquer (resources, spawn points)  The Elder Scrolls (characters, areas, dialogues)  Crysis (expansions, models, scripts)  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 33 / XX\n\n35. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Game Element Trading Problem • Items and elements are not reachable for everyone. Some players don‘t want to spend so much time. As a consequence gold and item farms are created, where player trade items for real money or other services.  Solution • Everyone can get rare or unique items if there is a chance of trading   Example • WoW • Diablo ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 34 / XX\n\n36. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Rock-Paper-Scissors (Tri-ambiguity) Problem • Dominant strategies that make player decisions a trivial choice should be avoided.  Solution • Introduce non-transitive relationships within a set of alternatives, as in the game of paper-rock-scissors.  Examples • Character relationships in Dragon Age • Character classes in Gothic • Weapon ambiguity in Alice: Madness Returns  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 35 / XX\n\n37. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Inaccessible Areas Problem • Some games may look very small at a first glance  Solution • Extend levels with hidden or secret areas or areas that are inaccessible for certain player classes.  Example • Gothic II: Guild areas are only accessible for guild members • Dragon Age I: Different initial chapter for each player class  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 36 / XX\n\n38. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Privileged Move Problem • Sometimes a given game entity cannot be permitted to interfere with others, or other entities cannot be permitted to interfere with it.  Solution • Introducing exclusive moves and locations separates and protects game entities. These exclusive moves and locations cannot be entered or left without being able to perform the respective privileged move. By introducing different, separate spaces or media, the game environment is broken down into distinct areas, which can serve e.g. as safe zones or safe passages.  Examples • Rabbids Go Home: Protected Areas • Half-Life 2: Vehicles only enemy troops could use • Doom: Monsters could traverse acid pools, but the player could only at the expense of damage  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 37 / XX\n\n39. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Social Rewards Problem • Player motivation is low or mini games like collecting items may not seem interesting at some points.  Solution • Provide social rewards and achievements especially for multiplayer games.  • Example Call Of Duty  Counter Strike  Red Dead Redemption  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 38 / XX\n\n40. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Interruptibility Problem • Some games or levels cannot be finished at once, because completing a level required too much time.  Solution • Provide options to stop and start the game involving manual saving, quick-saving or auto-saving techniques.  Examples • Diablo II: The game is saved on exit • Gothic III: The game can be saved using hotkeys • Alice: Madness Returns: The game is saved automatically at a certain level progress   ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 39 / XX\n\n41. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Late Arriving Players Problem • Players want to join online game sessions instantaneously, but this is not always possible.  Solutions • Provide metaphors to join games instantaneously.  Examples • Quake and Unreal Tournament (instant join) • Counterstrike, CoD (round based) • Duke Nukem (synchronized)  ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18. April 12 40 / XX\n\n42. 2 Game Design Patterns -- Examples • Augmented Reality Problem • Real and virtual world is usually seperated.

Visually appealing action must be sketched, but supplemental dialogue or less intense action can be simply explained with a written sidebar. (4) Use the written sidebar explained in Step 4 for explanation of virtual camera angles, special sound effects and other non-visual cues. (5) Design rudimentary versions of key characters and scenes with a computer graphics program to supplement your hand-drawn action frames. Sketches are the best way to start, but you also need a brief sample of the in-game design to complete any storyboard package. ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18.

April 12 56 / XX\n\n58. 2 Focusgroups in Game Design • Focus groups help game designers getting a better sense of how consumers feel about various aspects of a game • Focus groups typically comprise 6-12 consumers from a particular group (e.g., people who play racing games). Several such consumers meet together to discuss topics that the game design team is interested in, such as what features in the game are important to the consumers and what they think of various design concepts. Story boards that describe the game’s premise or the game’s design mechanics sometimes accompany the discussion. • • • • • Focus groups can be useful for concept generation in the initial stages of a project or for obtaining a better general understanding of a problem space in some circumstances. However, they are poor at providing specific, actionable data that help game designers make their games better for several reasons. Focus groups are also susceptible to a host of group pressures that impact the quality of the information they yield. ● - Mobile Games - Design - Development Mittwoch, 18.
