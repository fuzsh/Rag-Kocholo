See also slides from Lua Workshop 2013 and online demo.\n\nIt is often the case that, on one hand, there is a need to configure lots of intricate and ever-changing business logic rules, but, on the other hand, the person who has the most expertise on the particular business logic area – domain expert – often will not have a clue on how to write code effectively (or even at all). All kinds of clumsy UIs, spaghetti code, wasted dedicated scripter's hours and other unpleasantries stem from that problem.\n\nBusiness Logic Editor Toolkit alleviates that problem by providing a programmer with a set of tools to easily build a business-logic configuration UI, suitable for a non-programmer domain expert, and an easy, platform-agnostic way to seamlessly tie business logic configuration from that UI to an existing (or newly written) codebase, effectively creating a visual domain-specific programming language.\n\nThe toolkit is written in Lua (plus some JavaScript) and it is a seventh generation implementation of the concept behind it. Contact toolkit@logiceditor.com for a price quote.\n\nAutomotive\n\nAutomotive — Autosport Labs\n\nAutoSport Labs\n\nAutosport Labs exposes APIs to Lua for programming their Race Capture Pro Data Acquisition and Control system and their Megajolt Lite Programmable Ignition Controller. See e.g., API documentation for Race Capture Pro.\n\nAutomotive — Mercedes-Benz Autos\n\nMercedes-Benz Automobiles\n\nMercedes-Benz uses Lua in several models of their cars. See page 6 in the linked PDF. For what purpose(s), we do not yet know. Do you? If so, please let us know using the contact information near the top of this page.\n\nCommand Line Enhancers\n\nCommand Line Enhancers — Take Command\n\nTake Command Windows Command Prompt\n\nTake Command is a comprehensive interactive GUI and command line environment that makes using the Windows command prompt and creating batch files easy and far more powerful. Take Command displays your command line applications in tabbed windows, with optional Explorer-style integration for a visual look at your folders. Take Command includes hundreds of Unix-like major enhancements to CMD commands such as COPY, DEL, and DIR, and adds more than 160 new commands, 587 internal variables and functions, a batch file IDE / debugger, advanced command line editing and completion, and thousands of other features.\n\nTake Command is the successor of the 4DOS command processor that substituted for Command.com in MS DOS and Windows 95.\n\nSince version 16.0, Take Command has shipped with an an embedded Lua interpreter.\n\nDatabase Management\n\nDatabase Management — Datalog\n\nDatalog is a deductive database system for memory constrained devices that can be manipulated with Lua.\n\nDatabase Management — MySQL Proxy\n\nMySQL Proxy\n\nMySQL Proxy is a lightweight binary application standing between one or more MySQL clients and a server. The clients connect to the Proxy with the usual credentials, instead of connecting to the server. The Proxy acts as man-in-the-middle between client and server. The Proxy ships with an embedded Lua interpreter.\n\nUsing Lua, you can define what to do with a query or a result set before the Proxy passes them along. The power of the Proxy is all in its flexibility, as allowed by the Lua engine. You can intercept the query before it goes to the server, and do everything conceivable with it, like pass it along unchanged, fix spelling mistakes, rewrite the query, etc.‌\n\nDatabase Management — MySQL Workbench\n\nMySQL Workbench\n\nMySQL Workbench is a visual database design tool that integrates SQL development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment for theMySQL database system.\n\nThe program embeds Lua for its extensions and add-ons.\n\nDatabase Management — PL/Lua (PostgreSQL)\n\nPL/Lua is an implementation of Lua as a loadable procedural language for PostgreSQL: with PL/Lua. You can use PostgreSQL functions and triggers written in the Lua programming language.\n\nProcedural languages offer many extra capabilities to PostgreSQL, similar to C language extensions: control structures, more complex computations than allowed by SQL, access to user-defined types and database functions and operators, and restriction to trusted execution.\n\nPL/Lua brings the power and simplicity of Lua to PostgreSQL, including: small memory footprint, simple syntax, lexical scoping, functions as first-class values, and coroutines for non-preemptive threading.\n\nDatabase Management — Tarantool/Box NoSQL database\n\nTarantool/Box NoSQL database - uses Lua as a stored procedure language.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation — Celestia\n\nCelestia, the astronomy educational program, uses Lua as its scripting language.\n\nFile Managers\n\nFile Managers — Far Manager\n\nFar Manager\n\nFar Manager is a program for managing files and archives on Windows operating systems. Far Manager can be extended with Lua in two ways: in macros and as plugins.\n\nMacros are the most common use of Lua with Far Manager. Starting from 30 Sept. 2012, Lua is used as a macro language instead of a primitive custom language that was used in earlier versions of Far. A \"macro\" in Far Manager is a user-written code that is executed whenever some event occurs (e.g. a key pressed, an editor opened/closed/saved, dialog opened/closed, etc.‌).\n\nFar Manager plugins are written in C/C++/Pascal but \"macros\" are written in Lua.\n\nFlight Simulators\n\nFlight Simulators — DCS: Black Shark\n\nDCS: Black Shark\n\nEagle Dynamics\n\n\"DCS: Black Shark\" is a PC flight simulator of the Russian Ka-50 attack helicopter and is the first title in a new Eagle Dynamics and The Fighter Collection simulation series: \"Digital Combat Simulator\" (DCS). Following Eagle Dynamics' tradition of excellence, \"DCS: Black Shark\" will bring an even more realistic simulation experience than its predecessor \"Flaming Cliffs\". \"DCS: Black Shark\" will offer an unprecedented level of realism in regards to flight dynamics, instruments modeling, avionics systems, and weapon systems. The artificial Intelligence of ground vehicles and helicopters has been improved dramatically as well as weapon modeling. A new Mission Editor includes a powerful electronic mapping system that allows user to easily create missions and campaigns. A new campaign system allows the front line of the battlefield to move back and fourth according to your mission success or failure. Due to the increased flexibility of the DCS system, additional fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter add-ons will follow shortly.Lua is heavily used through whole project for game AI programming, configuration purposes and many more.

That's partly due to its speed and the ease with which developers can embed Lua into a game engine. Lua is also highly extensible -- it's simple to expand its functionality with libraries either written in Lua, or as extensions in other languages. And it's relatively small and simple, both in terms of the source files, and the resultant code and run-time memory usage.\n\nhttp://www.gdmag.com/blog/2012/01/front-line-award-winners.php\n\nGames — Allods Online\n\nGames — Angry Birds\n\nGames — Aquaria (video game)\n\nGames — Baldur's Gate\n\nGames — Ballistics\n\nGames — Bandits: Phoenix Rising\n\nGames — Bet On Soldier: Blood Sport\n\nGames — Bionic Commando\n\nGames — Bionic Commando Rearmed\n\nGames — Bionic Commando Rearmed 2\n\nGames — Blitzkrieg\n\nGames — Blitzkrieg 2\n\nGames — Blitzkrieg (video game)\n\nGames — Blossom (video game)\n\nGames — Brave: The Search for Spirit Dancer\n\nGames — Brütal Legend\n\nGames — Bubble Ball\n\nGames — Buzz!\n\nGames — BZFlag\n\nGames — Civilization 5\n\nCivilization 5\n\n(game)\n\nGames — Civilization V\n\nGames — Company of Heroes\n\nGames — Cortex Command\n\nGames — Crackdown\n\nGames — Crimson -- Steam Pirates\n\nCrimson -- Steam Pirates\n\nGames — Crowns of Power\n\nGames — CryENGINE2\n\nCrytek.\n\nCryENGINE2 is the successor of CryENGINE, the game engine behind Far Cry.

It works as a wiki out of the box, but can be extended into other things.\n\nOut of the box Sputnik behaves like an easy to use and full-featured wiki that can be used \"as is\". It offers editable nodes, history and diff, user accounts with optional email validation, a flexible permission system, RSS feeds, etc.‌\n\nHowever, Sputnik was designed to be extended. It offers many options out of the box, and it is easy to add more. You can surely change the way Sputnik looks — see some of the examples in Sightings. But you can also do much more.\n\nSputnik can also be used as a platform for a wide range of \"social software\" applications. A few extra templates and perhaps a few lines of Lua code can turn it into a bug tracker, a photo album, a blog, a calendar, a mailing list viewer, or almost anything else. So, you can think of it as a content-management system or a web platform of sorts.\n\nEmail\n\nInternet Email — FreePOPS\n\nFreePOPs, an extensible mail proxy, uses Lua to power its web front-end.\n\nInternet Email — MailCatch (Anti-spam)\n\nMailCatch Service\n\nMailCatch is an email service that allows you to create temporary disposable mailboxes, in a completly anonymous way. When you are asked for an email address by a website and you do not want to give yours (for fear of spam), you can simply give whatever mailbox name you want on the mailcatch.com domain (like whatever@mailcatch.com). Then go to the MailCatch web site, type in the mailbox name and check your mail. You can access your mailbox even faster by using a URL like yourinbox.mailcatch.com\n\nThe site is based on many Lua Kepler Project modules (and it runs an xavante, although behind an apache proxy). The pages are rendered using a custom mod of\n\nthe Cosmo template library.\n\nInternet Email — spamfilter.lua\n\nspamfilter.lua\n\nspamfilter.lua is an anti-spam filter written in Lua using the OSBF-lua module. It takes special advantage of EDDC to introduce TONE-HR, a highly effective training method. The combination of OSB, EDDC and TONE-HR to enhance a classical Bayesian classifier resulted in the best spam filtering performance in TREC's Spam Track 2006 and in CEAS 2008 Live Challenge.\n\nOSBF-Lua (Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams with confidence Factor) is a Lua C module for text classification. It is a port of the OSBF classifier implemented in the CRM114 project. This implementation attempts to put focus on the classification task itself by using Lua as the scripting language, a powerful yet light-weight and fast language, which makes it easier to build and test more elaborated filters and training methods.\n\nThe OSBF algorithm is a typical Bayesian classifier but enhanced with two techniques originally developed for the CRM114 project: Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams - OSB, for feature extraction, and Exponential Differential Document Count - EDDC (a.k.a Confidence Factor), for automatic feature selection. Combined, these two techniques produce a highly accurate classifier. OSBF was developed focused on two classes, SPAM and NON-SPAM, so the performance for more than two classes may not be the same.\n\nInternet Email — LuMail\n\nLuMail\n\nLumail is a modern console-based email client developed for GNU/Linux.\n\nThere are many graphical clients for email, but comparatively few designed solely for console use. With the exception of GNU Emacs none of the console clients I examined had any built in support for scripting with a real language.\n\nLumail is scripted and configured in 100% Lua, along with many lumail-specific functions. Lumail can be extended using Lua and Lumail primitives.\n\nNetwork Diagnostics\n\nInternet Network Diagnostics — Nmap\n\nNmap\n\nInsecure.org\n\nNmap (\"Network Mapper\") is a free open source utility for network exploration or security auditing. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It won Linux Journal's Editor's Choice Award for Best Security Tool, LinuxQuestions.Org Security App of the Year award, and Info World's Best Information Security Product award. The Nmap scripting language is an embedded Lua interpreter which was extended with libraries for interfacing with Nmap. Lua was chosen because it exceeded in all criteria for Nmap: it is small, distributed under the MIT license, has coroutines which provide a sane method for parallel script execution, was designed with embeddability in mind, has excellent documentation, and has a large and committed community. http://nmap.org/\n\nInternet Network Diagnostics — Wireshark\n\nWireshark network protocol analyzer.\n\nWireshark is a highly popular multi-platform network protocol analyzer used for troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education.

LSP provides support for most of the Barracuda APIs (cookies, sessions, RPC, etc.) and has built-in Lua-SQL support. Barracuda LSP can be extended with existing Lua libraries. LSP applications can be packaged as ZIP files and/or embedded in the Barracuda web server executable.Contact: [David Burgess]\n\nInternet Servers — lighttpd\n\nlighttpd web server uses Lua for hook scripts as well as a modern replacement for the Cache Meta Language.\n\nInternet Servers — LuaNode\n\nLuaNode\n\nLuaNode allows to write high performance net servers or clients, using an asynchronous model of computing (the Reactor pattern). You might have seen this model implemented in event processing frameworks like Node.js, EventMachine or Twisted. In fact, LuaNode is heavily based on Node.js, because I wanted to be able to do what Node.js does, but using Lua instead of JavaScript.\n\nLuaNode is mainly developed on Windows, but it is being tested also on Linux.\n\nInternet Servers — Luvit\n\nLuvit\n\nNon-Blocking Scripted Servers (like Node.js, but faster)\n\nInternet Servers — nginx\n\nNginx is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server. Igor Sysoev started development of Nginx in 2002, with the first public release in 2004. Nginx now hosts nearly 12.18% (22.2M) of all domains worldwide. As Netcraft predicted, Nginx now surpasses Microsoft IIS as the second most popular web server. Extensible using the HttpLuaModule.\n\nInternet Servers — Prosody\n\nProsody is a cross-platform Jabber/XMPP server written in Lua.\n\nInternet Servers — Wingate Proxy Server\n\nWinGate proxy server allows event processing and policy to execute lua scripts with access to internal WinGate objects.\n\nGraphical User Interfaces\n\nInternet UIs — OpenWrt LuCI Web GUI\n\nOpenWrt LuCI web GUI.\n\nLuCI was founded in March 2008 as \"FFLuCI\" as part of the efforts to create a port of the Freifunk-Firmware from OpenWrt Whiterussian to Kamikaze.\n\nThe initial reason for this project was the absence of a free, clean, extensible and easily maintainable web user interface for embedded devices. While most similar configuration interfaces make heavy use of the Shell-scripting language LuCI uses the Lua programming language and splits up the interface into logical parts like models and views, uses object-oriented libraries and templating. That ensures a higher performance, smaller installation size, faster runtimes and what is even more important: better maintainability.\n\nMeanwhile LuCI evolved from a MVC-Webframework to a collection of several libraries, applications and user interfaces with general purpose for Lua programmers while the focus still remains on the web user interface which also became an official part of OpenWrt Kamikaze.\n\nWeb Browsers\n\nInternet Web Browsers — Firefox Web Browser\n\nThe Firefox Web browser can be extended using Lua and Moonshine, an embedded Lua environment for Firefox.\n\nInternet Web Browsers — LuaKit\n\nLuaKit is a highly configurable, micro-browser framework based on the WebKit web content engine and the GTK+ toolkit. It is very fast, extensible by Lua and licensed under the GNU GPLv3 license.\n\nIt is primarily targeted at power users, developers and any people with too much time on their hands who want to have fine-grained control over their web browser's behavior and interface.\n\nMachine-To-Machine\n\nM2M — Mihini\n\nThe Mihini project delivers an embedded runtime running on top of Linux, that exposes an high-level Lua API for building Machine-to-Machine applications.\n\nMalware\n\nMalware — sKyWIper, Flame, Flamer\n\nsKyWIper, Flame, Flamer (PDF)\n\nThe sophisticated cyber-spy malware sKyWIper (also known as Flame and FLamer) embeds Lua and includes over 3,000 lines of Lua code. \"Many parts of Flame have high order logic written in Lua — with effective attack subroutines and libraries compiled from C++,\" according to Kapersky Labs.\n\nsKyWIper has very advanced functionality to steal information and to propagate. Multiple exploits and propagation methods can be freely configured by the attackers. Information gathering from a large network of infected computers was never crafted as carefully as in sKyWIper. The malware is most likely capable to use all of the computers’ functionalities for its goals. It covers all major possibilities to gather intelligence, including keyboard, screen, microphone, storage devices, network, wifi, Bluetooth, USB and system processes.\n\nThe results of our technical analysis support the hypotheses that sKyWIper was developed by a government agency of a nation state with significant budget and effort, and it may be related to cyber warfare activities.\n\nsKyWIper is certainly the most sophisticated malware we encountered during our practice; arguably, it is the most complex malware ever found.\n\n— sKyWIper (a.k.a.

This project required the rendering of scenes comprising tens of thousands of battling soldiers,in addition to complex city layouts and particle effects for flames, smoke and dust. The generation of all this geometry was handled almost exclusively at rendertime by Giggle.\n\nGiggle's core functionality comprises approximately 40,000 lines of C++, written by 2 MPC programmers over the course of 9 months. This provides many capabilities including : * loading of geometry, shaders, particle caches and a proprietary cache format for agent simulations. * skinning and other geometry modifiers * procedural geometry generation * kd tree classes for space partitioning * geometry evaluators to perform ray intersections and closest point queries.\n\nThe functionality is bound into Lua, providing a flexible scripting interface which allows it to be easily adapted to specific tasks. MPC initially chose Lua for its reputation for speed and efficiency as well as for the great simplicity of its API. It has subsequently proved itself through heavy use by a team of 16 or so CG artists and across a render farm of over 500 machines.Since adoption, Giggle's use has been extended to other MPC feature pipelines, and coupled with an interactive interpreter and OpenGL preview renderer to provide interactive script development and debugging.

Extensible and configurable with Lua. Licensed under the same license as Lua.\n\nDesign Principles\n\nFirst and foremost, Hydra must be stable. It should never crash. You should only ever have to launch it once, and it should stay running until you quit it (or your computer restarts). No exceptions to this.\n\nSecondly, Hydra must be lightweight. It should never do anything that drains your computer's battery. It should never poll for anything. And it should practically never use more than 10 MB of memory. Everything it does should feel instant and snappy, never sluggish or delayed.\n\nThirdly, its API should be completely transparent. There should be no surprises in how it's behaving, or what's being executed and when. It should be fully predictable.\n\nFinally, the API must not be bloated. Nothing should be added that is impossible or impractical to do in pure Lua; what should be included is what's extremely common and likely to be used in everyone's configs.\n\nOperating Systems & Window Managers — Ion Window Manager\n\nIon is a tiling and tabbing window manager for the X Window System.

At its core lies less than 2000 lines of C code, and that is how it always will be. While other editors rely on numerous plugins for a wide range of functionality, recordable macros to speed up workflow, and shell scripts to quickly transform text, Textadept takes it to the extreme: it gives you complete control over the entire application using the embedded Lua language. Lua is one of the fastest scripting languages available and has a very small footprint. In fact, most of Textadept is written in Lua. The application's incredibly fast startup time and operation attest to Lua's worthiness.\"\n\nPlain Text Editors — Vim\n\nThe Vim text editor is scriptable with Lua beginning with version 7.3.

I did a bit of googling and indeed, Lua is deeply integrated in Squeezebox from the OS kernel to user interfaces and user-created applet plugins, see e.g., <http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.php/SqueezeOS_Architecture#LUA>.\n\nBut Logitech recently discontinued use and development of Squeeze OS for all but one internet \"radio\" product, although they've committed to continue support for Squeeze and existing appliances. <http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33199_7-57519226-221/logitech-leaves-squeezebox-fans-wondering-whats-next/>.\n\nThe successor system is called \"ue\". I haven't found the mother lode of Lua documentation for it yet, but the user forums suggest that Lua 5.1 is heavily involved there too. See <http://forums.logitech.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?filter=labels&q=lua+#message-list> (user forum search for \"lua \" produces 89 pages of hits)."
