        "text": "Source code for http://www.luxinia.de game engine.\n\nThe project is not in active development anymore, this repository exists for archive purposes or if people want to branch from it.\n\nCross-platform libraries are used, however only MSVC2008 solutions and Windows 32-bit have been used for development.\n\nRequires to be merged with http://www.luxinia.de/download/luxinia1support.7z which contains third-party code and dependencies. Pre-built for Windows 32-bit.\n\nThe SDK consist of multiple parts. If not mentioned otherwise, the bottom license applies (NET-BSD)\n\nReleased under MIT license.\n\nluxplatform: Core lib for file operations and compiler specific defines/asserts\n\nluxmath: Most vector math related functions are stored here.\n\nluxcore: Some generic data containers and algorithms are defined here. The object reference system (smart/weak pointers) is also heavily used by luxinia.\n\nThe final runtime package (binaries) has its own license. The source of the engine uses either NETBSD or MIT style licenses.\n\nbase: The standard lua code that ships with any runtime distribution. Its source code is released under MIT license.\n\ninclude & source: Actual engine source code.\n\nluxinia_glfw: Standard exe that provides a window manager to luxinia. Luxinia's window manager is more or less identical to GLFW.\n\nluxinia_lua: Allows you to define your own window manager through lua functions. GLFW is used for joystick input. Was used to run luxinia inside wxWidgets.\n\ntutorials: The tutorials showcasing several engine features.\n\nare found pre-built inside http://www.luxinia.de/download/luxinia1support.7z\n\nA brief overview on the internal components, best combined with the documentation found at http://luxinia.de/doc/frames/\n\nSHD Shader definition script\n\nMTL Material definition script\n\nPRT Particle definition script\n\nCopyright: 2004-2011 Christoph Kubisch and Eike Decker.
