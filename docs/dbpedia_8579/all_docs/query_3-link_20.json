        "text": "We live in a world where people always try to find a way to escape the bitter realities of hubbub life. This escapism gives rise to indulgences. Products of such indulgence are the video games people play. Back in the past the term ―game engine‖ did not exist. Back then, video games were considered by most adults to be nothing more than toys, and the software that made them tick was highly specialized to both the game and the hardware on which it ran. Today, video game industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry rivaling even the Hollywood. The software that drives these three dimensional worldsthe game engines-have become fully reusable software development kits. In this paper, I discuss the specifications of some of the top contenders in video game engines employed in the market today. I also try to compare up to some extent these engines and take a look at the games in which they are used.\n\nFor game developers, one of the stickiest tasks has always been porting their creations to new devices. Not only is this process costly and time-consuming, but it also rarely allows for interoperability between platforms. If a developer builds a game for Windows, it would be a major ordeal to get it running on the iPhone or Linux. And even then, the cross-platform experience is lackluster and does not take advantage of the potential for a unified game experience. The emer-gence of mobile platforms and the worldwide use of such de-vices has facilitated the need for a more uniform hardware and software interface. Through the use of a modular design as well as a strict adherence to cross-platform support, our project attempts to bridge the gap between computer config-urations and create a truly unified game development expe-rience. In the end, we wish to develop a set of tools that abstracts away a predefined hardware or operating system interface and allows game developers to compile ...\n\nMany game engines integrate the game logic with the graphics engine. In this paper we separate the two, thus making the logic portable between game engines. In our architecture the logic is represented as an ontology and a set of rules for a particular application domain. A mediator with an embedded rules-engine links the logic to a suitable game engine. We demonstrate our architecture in two ways. First, we show a traffic accident scenario running on two different game engines, with a separate mediator for each engine. The logic type is smart- terrain logic, with participants triggering events based on interaction and proximity tests. In the second demonstration (a simple first-person shooting game) we show the extensibility and performance of the architecture to control non-player characters quickly manoeuvring using proximity tests and waypoints.\n\nContemporary game engines are invaluable tools for game development. There are many engines available, each of them which excel in certain features. Game Engines is a continuous series that helps us to make and design beautiful games in the simplest and least resource way. Game drives support a wide variety of play platforms that can translate the game into a game that can be played on different platforms such as PlayStation, PC, Xbox, Android, IOS, Nintendo and others. There is a wide range of game engines that suit every programmer and designed to work on Unity Game Engine, Unreal Game Engine and Construct Game Engine. In the research paper, we discuss the basic elements of the game engine and how to make the most useful option among Game Engines depending on your different needs and needs of your game.\n\nGame development is an ever growing interdisciplinary field. A variety of different skill sets need to come together to create a professional game. These range from art, audio and design through programming and development. It is difficult to isolate the different disciplines in game development since every aspect of the game is co-dependent on everything else. Even in the programming domain there are a number of sub-disciplines that a game can require such as physics programming, environmental programming, artificial intelligence and programming the core game engine, A game can even be developed in a number of different ways depending on the design of the final product. This daunting array of required disciplines makes it difficult to offer effective instruction in game development, The tendency is to divide the disciplines according to traditional academic categories. This leads to offering courses on game development that are too narrowly focused to lead to any functional games o...\n\nThe paper deals with a close examination of several contemporary game engines regarding their usability for architectural visualisation that was conducted by third to fifth year students in a seminar context. The study examines the technology of these game engines with the main focus on graphic quality and adaptability to architectural purpose. The evaluation included not only the workflow of importing the 3D model into the engine but also general handling of the software and its user interface. The documentation of the test process and the evaluation of the various engines have been documented in a wiki compiled and written by the students. The information therein and the cost-benefit analyses provided for every engine should assist future users to quickly find the most suitable game engine for their specific purposes."
