        "text": "I'll start with what I posted in the indie thread. This is a Case statement (Sytax is C#). Comments in line. In this version I DID NOT use myNumber to get my initial random number. Instead, I put the random number generator inside the MathF function. I'll post more code for the PolyCount Pac Man as I go along. First task and the hardest for this is to get ghost moving through a maze towards the player. This bit of code will be the base for all of that.\n\nusing UnityEngine; using System.Collections; // the class ghostMovement HAS TO BE THE SAME NAME AS THE FILE. So you name your file buttKiss, then this class //NEEDS TO BE buttKiss. public class ghostMovement : MonoBehaviour { int myNumber; int Rounded; // Use this for initialization, like setting variables and ints. I set my numbers here, so when the \"game\" //starts, I have the result of Rounded. void Start () { //This pics a random FLOAT between 0 and 4. Floats are numbers with fractions //things like 1.2 or 35.0000234, where as things like // 1, 2, 3 and 3000404 are int or WHOLE NUMBERS. myNumber = Random.Range(0,4); //Now take this and make it an int by rounding to the nearest whole. Rounded = Mathf.RoundToInt(Random.Range(0,4)); } // Update is called once per frame. You really don't want to use this for many things, it eats CPU cycles //But for this demo, we will allow it. void Update () { //This little beauty is a CASE STATEMENT. It will be the \"brains\" of our ghosts. If it's this, do this, if it's that do this //The options are finite so we will have total control. All this will do is handle being chased, and chasing. // //You see this switch(Rounded)? That Rounded is what will control the case options. switch is looking for a number //and will only take the result of Rounded. Rounded was decided when the script first ran in the void Start(). switch(Rounded) { //Did the result of Rounded equal to 0? case (0):Debug.Log(\"The number is zero!\"); break; //Did the result of Rounded equal to 1? case (1):Debug.Log(\"The number is one!\"); break; //Did the result of Rounded equal to 2? case (2):Debug.Log(\"The number is two!\"); break; //Did the result of Rounded equal to 3? case (3):Debug.Log(\"The number is three!\"); break; //Did the result of Rounded equal to 4? case (4):Debug.Log(\"The number is four!\"); //These BREAKS stop the process of the case WITHIN this switch. Just know you need this, or it will toss an error. break; } } }"
