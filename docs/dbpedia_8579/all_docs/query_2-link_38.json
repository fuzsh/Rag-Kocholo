        "text": "Dr Death is a character in Neopets. He is notable for running the Neopian pound.\n\nBiography[]\n\nDr Death was once a happy Techo. He enjoyed caring for others and often took in injured petpets to nurse them back to health before finding them happy new homes. As he grew up, he looked into finding a job that fit his dream of helping others.\n\nEventually, he took a job at the Neopian Pound where he was tasked with helping neopets find new homes. However, this job took a toll on his happiness. He found more and more neopets being abandoned by their owners for various reasons. Each reason was tragic no matter what it was.\n\nEventually, Dr Death became a bitter and grumpy techo that even the pets at the pound fear. However, he still works to help them find a new home. He just has grown fed up with the cruelty of owners tossing their pets away.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nEven though he is a benevolent being, it is made clear that most neopets are outright scared of him. The most notable ones being Lutari who will outright run away never to be seen again if abandoned instead of being in the pound because they fear him that much.\n\nOn April 1st of 2014, he announced retirement. come the end of the day, he changed his mind."
