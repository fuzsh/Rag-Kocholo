On Day 6 of the advent we were met with a conversation between Orion & Reina. All future dialogue, should there be anymore, will be posted below.\n\nDay 6\n\nDay 6 Dialogue Speaker Dialogue Orion Reina, please we must stop the Advent Calendar! Reina Hold up! Orion? What are you doing here? Orion I know we don't know each other well, but this is important! Something terrible is about to happen! Reina You aren't making any sense. Why do we need to stop the Advent Calendar? Orion There isn't any time, we need to prepare as soon as possible. I...I don't know how I am seeing these things but I know it can't be good! Reina Take a deep breath, Orion! Now please start over. I don't understand what you are talking about. Orion I'm sorry. A...a few days ago, I was consulting my cards as I walked when...a tender and resonant plucking came to me, and moments later I tripped over this Lyre in the snow! Since then I have had terrible visions. Visions that I fear will soon impact all of Neopia greatly! Reina Orion, you look like you haven't slept in days. I admire your determination, but I think you need to go home and get some rest. Orion Please Reina, you must promise me you'll stop the Advent Calendar. Now is not the time for fun and games, something horrible is coming to Neopia, something we must prepare for. Reina For your own sake, go get some sleep. You look unwell! If you are still worried, we can talk more about this later.\n\nDay 15\n\nDay 15 Dialogue Speaker Dialogue Orion Reina, what are you doing? You promised me you'd stop the Advent Calendar! Reina Orion, you're back? Did you get any sleep? You still look exhausted! Orion I...I tried, but the sound of the Lyre torments me every night, never allowing me a moment of silence…wait that isn't the point! This all needs to stop right away, you promised! Reina I didn't promise anything, Orion. I'm sorry for what you are going through, but Neopians rely on the Advent Calendar to bring them warmth and cheer during the most frigid time of year. I can't shut it all down over nightmares. Orion They aren't just nightmares!! They are premonitions! We all need to prepare! Please just listen to me! Reina Orion stop! The Advent Calendar simply means too much. I can't just shut it down without proof. Orion Fine, you want proof. I'll get you proof!\n\nDay 26\n\nDay 26 Dialogue Speaker Dialogue Orion I have found a way to show you my visions! The Lyre...it...if... Reina Orion, this has gone too far! Orion These may be the final days of the Advent Calendar, but I need to show Neopia the visions that keep tormenting me. I don't know why they are coming to me, but I know they are important... somehow. Reina You really are serious about this, aren't you? Orion The Lyre! I discovered that when I play it, those who hear it share in my visions. Before, they came to me choppy and distorted... but with this, I can see the visions clear as day. And I can share them with you all as well! Please just listen!\n\nDay 30\n\nDay 30 Dialogue Speaker Dialogue Orion I told you I'm not crazy! Reina We need to do something! We need to tell someone! Fyora That someone is already here. Orion Queen Fyora! But how did you... Fyora That instrument you found has been emitting an incredible amount of unknown magic. I've been investigating it for weeks and your prolonged playing led me right to its source. Orion Unknown magic? Fyora Yes, you seem to have stumbled upon a powerful artefact imbued with magic even I am unfamiliar with. Yet another troubling development... Reina Does that mean the Lyre is dangerous? Should we have even played it?! What if- Fyora Easy Reina. You were right to let Orion share his visions. It's too soon to tell what exactly this artefact is capable of, but playing it only seemed to clarify and project the visions Orion has been experiencing. Reina Phew! What a relief... and here I was worried I brought doom to Neopia after just my third time organising the Advent Calendar! Fyora Nonsense! You handled the situation quite well. I have no doubt your grandmother will be proud to hear of the compassionate Aisha you've become. Reina Oh! I- um- well thank you Queen Fyora... That's too kind. Fyora I owe you both an apology as well. I'm sorry it took me so long to find the source of this strange magic. It seems to have taken quite the toll on you already Orion. Orion Yes, well, I suppose I have been better... Fyora Come, you and I must discuss this all at once. After we find a way to get you some sleep that is!\n\nWritten by Staff Compiled\n\nErrors or incorrect info?
