Tecgraf is Lua's birthplace, and the language has been used there since 1993. Currently, more than thirty programmers in Tecgraf use Lua regularly, who have written more than two hundred thousand lines of code, distributed among dozens of final products.\n\nContact: Waldemar Celes\n\nModeling AXAF Obstructions with the Generalized Aperture Program\n\nSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory\n\nThe Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), due to be launched in 1998, is the third of NASA's four Great Space Observatories. AXAF will provide unprecedented capabilities of high resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the X-ray range of 0.1-10keV.\n\nAs part of our efforts to support the AXAF program, the SAO AXAF Mission Support Team has developed a software suite to simulate AXAF images generated by the flight mirror assembly. One of the tasks of this system is to simulate the physical obstructions in front of and behind the AXAF mirrors.\n\nThe generalized aperture program is designed to simulate the effects on the incident photon stream of physical obstructions, such as thermal baffles and pre- and post-collimators. It can handle a wide variety of aperture shapes, and has provisions to allow alterations of the photons by the apertures. The philosophy behind the aperture program is that a geometrically complicated aperture may be modeled by a combination of geometrically simpler apertures. This is done by incorporating a language, Lua, to lay out the apertures. User provided call-back functions enable the modeling of the interactions of the incident photon with the apertures.\n\nThis approach allows for maximum flexibility, since the geometry and interactions of obstructions can be specified by the user at run time.\n\nSee also this page.\n\nContact: Diab Jerius\n\nRPA\n\nPontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro\n\nRPA is an intranet system developed by PUC-Rio to record the academic production of its faculty. The project started in August, 1994 in the Department of Computer Science; in 1996 it was extended to other departments. Currently, the system is being used by hundreds of faculty and staff members from all departments of the University. This project was the birthplace of the CGILua library and its team contributes in the development of HTMLToolKit (which is distributed with CGILua).\n\nContact: Tomas Gorham\n\nBench test for snowmobiles\n\nLes Industries Hypershell\n\nWe did this application for Bombardier Inc. They are specialized in creating recreational and commercial vehicles.\n\nWe had to create a bench test for snowmobiles, which are assembled in Valcourt, Qu�bec, Canada. The application had to be fully customizable, because as new technologies are added to the vehicles, more tests have to be done, and existing ones change.\n\nAll the tests are done in Lua. The host application, which is programmed in Delphi, serves only to expose a toolkit to the Lua environment, and to load the correct Lua script depending on the vehicle being tested. The toolkit is composed of many functions that access different hardware components, like data acquisition cards and sound cards. Other functions are used to talk with a component inside the snowmobile, called a MEM. This is the heart of the snowmobile; it regulates motor speed and also serves as an anti-theft system. Some functions are used to interact with the operator performing the tests. All the test results are stored in an SQL server.\n\nThe host application is written in Delphi 2.0. We interact with Lua via a DLL written in C, using Visual C++ 4.2. I have merely exposed key Lua functions in the DLL, and call them from the host application. The DLL spawns a DOS console, then redirects stdin, stdout and stderr so we can see errors messages created by the Lua engine. There are currently 66 functions in the toolkit, and we are adding 16 more for future use. The part of the host application that treats Lua requests is in a separate thread, so we don't stop the main thread while executing Lua code. To execute the Lua code, I simply save the Lua script in a local file, then call the function lua_dofile. All Lua code comes from the SQL server.\n\nThe application is now in operation and works fine. We are currently working to adapt the host application to be used on another type of vehicle, the VTT, which will be produced by Bombardier this summer.\n\nContact: Robert Lamoureux\n\nControlling robots\n\nNon-Linear Control Consultants Ltd.\n\nI'm using Lua to sequence high-level commands to robots, connected to the host either via a serial line or transputer link; perhaps in future via USB or FireWire. Lua is particularly valuable here because the debugger hooks give me a means to make external asynchronous events (eg: touch-sensors) look like atomic actions as far as the Lua program is concerned, and allow users to assign call-back functions to them. Essentially the robot is a ``manipulation server'' and the Lua program its client. The second major advantage is the portability; I can easily compile a stripped-down Lua client for an embedded processor on the robot's motherboard. The user can then download their final debugged application into non-volatile memory, disconnect the host and leave the robot to get on with the job.\n\nContact: Mark Ian Barlow\n\nNovation\n\nGT Software, Inc.\n\nGT Software, Inc. has developed an IBM CICS Based HTTP/FTP Server that includes a 3270 Web Browser. The Product \"Novation\" (TM) includes Lua as a HTTP server script language.\n\nContact: Steve Able\n\nLua/P - The PIROL Repository Language\n\nTechnische Universit�t Berlin\n\nPIROL (Project Integrating Reference Object Library) is targeted at full coverage of all aspects of real software development projects. It was first designed with a strict focus on object oriented development, but for the use within the ongoing project ESPRESS it has also been extended towards formal techniques such as Z. The redesign resulted in LuaP, an adaptation of Lua for PIROL, which is now used to define PIROL's meta model.\n\nContact: Stephan Herrmann\n\nHZ - a real-time action strategy engine\n\nThe HZ Engine is a 2d real-time action strategy engine. It was originally written for Win32/DirectDraw, but it has now been ported to Linux/X11. Lua is used for game logic and sprite definition. All sprite properties, including animation sequencing, physics, and object properties are coded in Lua.\n\nContact: David Jeske\n\nAutomatic Web site maintenance\n\nGraduate Program in Systems Engineering and Computer Science, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro\n\nSeveral pages in this site are generated automatically from databases in Lua.\n\nContact: webmast AT cos.ufrj.br\n\nExtensible Network Management\n\nDepartment of Computer Science, PUC-Rio\n\nThis project uses Lua as the basis of a platform for the construction of extensible management applications. Lua is used on a standalone basis and not really as an extension language.\n\nThe LuaMan library was developed to provide access to services which are specifically relevant to tcp/ip network management: SNMP, ICMP and DNS. We are currently working on the development of an OO interface for these services. LuaMan runs on Linux, Solaris, SunOS, IRIX and AIX. Work is also under way for porting LuaMan to Windows NT.\n\nUsing LuaMan and other available libraries, such as CGILua and LuaOrb, several small management applications have been built.\n\nContact: Noemi Rodriguez\n\nAulaNet\n\nSoftware Engineering Lab, PUC-Rio\n\nAulaNet is a software environment based on the Web developed at the Software Engineering Laboratory (LES) of the Department of Computer Science at PUC-Rio, for creating and assisting distance courses. AulaNet was conceived from the experience gained in three courses during the second semester of 1997, and is based on the following basic premises:\n\nThe courses created must posses great capacity of interactiveness, in order to encourage intense participation by the student in the learning process.\n\nThe author of the course does not need to be a specialist on the Internet.\n\nThe resources offered by the creation of the courses must correspond to those available in a conventional classroom, plus others normally available in a Web environment.\n\nIt must be possible to re-use the contents already existing in digital media, through importing files, for example.\n\nContact: AulaNet Team\n\nRepository for the Scitech MGL\n\nThe resource manager (RES) is a C-library for use with the Scitech MGL and uses the language Lua as a configuration language. The RES deals with resource allocation (i.e loading of files, use of certain datatypes) and abstracts the use of resources through a dictionary. This means that you never have to allocate a bitmap again, you just ask the repository for an image with a certain name. It also helps in grouping information so that multi-lingual versions of software are easier to develop and maintain. The project is under continuous development.... 8-)\n\nContact: Freek Brysse\n\nNoweb 3\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science, Harvard University\n\nnoweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while remaining as simple as possible. Its primary advantages are simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence. noweb uses 5 control sequences to WEB's 27. The noweb manual is only 3 pages; an additional page explains how to customize its LaTeX output. noweb works ``out of the box'' with any programming language, and supports TeX, latex, and HTML back ends. A back end to support full hypertext or indexing takes about 250 lines; a simpler one can be written in 40 lines of awk. The primary sacrifice relative to WEB is that code is seldom prettyprinted.\n\nnoweb has been used for eight years at many universities and industrial sites. It has been used for tens of thousands of lines of code in such languages as awk, C, C++, Icon, Modula-3, PAL, perl, Promela, Turing, and Standard ML.\n\nThe supposed advantages of Noweb 3 over Noweb 2 are:\n\nto be more portable and easier to install (perhaps in one binary);\n\nto be faster;\n\nto retain all the extensibility features;\n\nto document some of those third-party extensions.\n\nThe means to all these good ends is to replace the shell scripts and the Icon code with the embedded language Lua-2.5+nw. (This is Lua version 2.5 extended with 2 kinds of case statement.)\n\nContact: Norman Ramsey\n\nMaths Problem Solving\n\nGranada Learning\n\nMaths Problem Solving is a Windows based multimedia application aimed at developing mathematical problem solving techniques in 14-16 year olds.\n\nThe application mainly consists of an MFC operating shell, with plug in COM-based tools that the users interact with to solve problems. We use Lua 3.0 to script the way the problems are handled, and to control the interactive characters that guide sers through the problem.\n\nUsing Lua in this way allows to develop the core interactivity of the application very quickly.\n\nContact: Paul Dixon\n\nDeli - An Extension of Lua based on Actors\n\nDepartment of Computing, Imperial College\n\nDeli is a Lua extension to support Actors, a model for concurrent computation in distributed systems. Deli extends Lua with functions like become, send, accept and new to deal with actor creation and interaction in a distributed programming environment.\n\nContact: Carlos Duarte\n\nuCore\n\nThe uCore Development Team\n\nuCore is a integrated development enviroment for distributed business applications. It is primary developed for WIN32 but with several Unix platforms in target for server part.\n\nIt consists of a core with the following modules:\n\nRuntime environment (Compiler + Interpreter)\n\nDatabase Manager\n\nNetwork Manager (Including RPC)\n\nWindows Manager (Win32 Wrapper Library)\n\nDLL Manager (Plug-ins for interpreter)\n\nA series of modules are written with uCore itself:\n\nDatabase Designer (Tables + Relations + Triggers etc.)\n\nNetwork Server\n\nApplet Designer (Forms)\n\nReport Designer\n\nUser Control\n\nuCore will be used to create a series of distributed applications for the financial sector. Lua 3.2 has been used as the basis for the compiler/interpreter. All development are done by a team in Denmark.\n\nContact: Erik Hougaard\n\nImageKitchen: Solutions for Laboratory Visualization\n\nPhotonic Systems Group, Beckman Institute of Advanced Technology\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nImageKitchen is a software package developed for Windows 95, 98, and NT that automates the acquisition, processing, and presentation of image information. Its modular design allows hardware to be interfaced easily, and controlled via a built-in scripting language (Lua). Built in image processing primitives of the scripting language allow powerful manipulation of images. One, two, and three-dimensional display capability allows immediate visualization and interaction with the processed image information. The ImageKitchen environment and scripts interact to provide rapid prototyping of experiments and presentation environments.\n\nContact: Daniel Marks\n\n3D Action-Strategy Game\n\nCriterion Studios\n\nCriterion Studios, headquartered in Guildford, England, is a developer of 3D games. We are using Lua as an embedded scripting language in an upcoming action-strategy game. A number of Lua scripts control the high level flow of the game. Using Lua allows us to easily save and restore the game state, as well as significantly reducing the complexity of writing the game logic. This makes the game more crash proof, and opens up the writing of scripts to game designers and other non-programmers. The game will be published on PC as well as next-generation console platforms.\n\nContact: Luc Van den Borre\n\nWPartner\n\nNettivity Co.\n\nWPartner is a development tool for CGI scripting. WPartner utilizes Lua as one of its guest languages. PERL and REXX are also supported, but Lua is the preferred language.\n\nWPartner provides Lua with capability to build HTML output based on templates. It means that your program code is not polluted with \"print\" commands to generate HTML output and is much more readable than usual CGI script. You do not need to change your program to modify HTML output it produces. All you need is to modify HTML templates containing program data placeholder. Templates are actually HTML files that can be created and modified by any HTML editor.\n\nWPartner provides Lua with SQL databases connectivity (both ODBC and native). You can use embedded SQL straight in your Lua script and even operate with LOB objects such as images.\n\nWPartner's input parser dynamically creates program variables in the user's script that correspond to the input parameters (form data or URL data name-value pairs). Created variables are populated with the appropriate values. You can use and reference input parameters by their names assigned to them in the input form or URL. The input parser handles \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" and \"multipart/form-data\" encodings.\n\nWPartner provides file upload and download, mail (SMTP, Exchange...), execution control, and many more capabilities\n\nAll active pages and sample programs on our site are enabled with Lua.\n\nContact: Vlad Serpik\n\nGrim Fandango\n\nLucasArts Entertainment\n\nGrim Fandango is a graphic adventure game that uses a modified version of Lua 3.1 as its scripting language. Grim Fandango was lauded by critics and adventure game fans as one of the best games in its genre. \"A tremendous amount of the game was written in Lua\", according to Bret.\n\nContact: Bret Mogilefsky\n\n3DImager\n\nThe Computational Imaging Initiative, Beckman Institute of Advanced Technology\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n\nOur work on an integrated software environment is motivated by the observation that this is such a golden age for electronic imaging system development that the capability to quickly and robustly develop and test new imaging system concepts is more important than any single system concept. With this in mind, we have developed an integrated Windows software environment, named 3DImager. 3DImager encompasses image capture, hardware control, and data processing. It is the intent of this software to provide the user with the necessary tools for 3D data acquisition with real time feedback to speed up the development process. This software can control several pieces of hardware including a scientific grade CCD arrays, digital I/O, piezo accuators, and translation stages. The user has the option of controlling this hardware directly, which is useful during alignment procedures, or one can place it under script control. The scripting language is based on the Lua script engine. The Lua language itself has been extended to include control of all the hardware with the addition of image processing routines and display functions. The scripting language is complimented by macro support allowing the user to implement new features to the software that were not thought of at design time.\n\nContact: David J. Brady\n\nZeus programmer's editor\n\nXidicone Pty Ltd\n\nThe Zeus for Windows programmers text editor has been specifically designed for software developers working in the Windows 3.x, Windows 95 and Windows NT environments. The Zeus text editor offers all the features of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with the added benefit of providing an powerful text editor that supports the Brief, Epsilon, WordStar and Emacs keyboard mapping's. Zeus 3.0 includes new plugable scripting modules that allows you to write Zeus macro scripts using the Python, Lua or Small C macro languages.\n\nContact: Jussi Jumppanen\n\npdelib\n\nWeierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin\n\npdelib is a collection of software components which are useful to create simulators based on partial differential equations. The main idea of the package is modularity, based on a pattern-oriented, bottom-up design. As the development of graphical user interfaces is a cumbersome task which takes a lot of time, we decided to enable users to communicate with our codes based on an interpreted scripting language. On demand, we plan to implement a GUI on top of Lua. Among the large number of languages of this type, only Lua proved to be simple, portable and powerful enough to meet our requirements.\n\nFor a list of applications developed within this framework, see the pdelib projects page.\n\nContact: J�rgen Fuhrmann\n\nBaldur's Gate\n\nBioWare Corp.\n\nBaldur's Gate is role-playing game (RPG) that is scripted internally using Lua. All debugging commands were exposed to Lua and a Lua prompt exposed to the game. This allowed complex debugging without spending much development time making debugging tools.\n\nContact: Cameron Tofer\n\nMDK2\n\nBioWare Corp.\n\nMDK2 is the sequel to the PC game MDK. MDK2 runs on both the SEGA Dreamcast and the PC.\n\nIn MDK2, Lua is critical for game functions. Lua's main purpose is its parsing ability. Many file formats were scraped because code/data could be parsed by Lua and read from the host. The real-time debugging features were taken to another step with MDK2, allowing for much more complicated tests. Even as far as prototyping. The other main use of Lua in MDK2 is that most of the movie scripts, AI scripts and time events are all done with Lua code.\n\nContact: Cameron Tofer\n\nPagetrak System and RT-Mailplex\n\nSoftronex Corporation, San Juan, Puerto Rico\n\nE-MAIL filtering, forwarding, etc. for large (250+ users) alphanumeric paging commercial application. Currently Lua substituted AWK scripts, and shell scripts. Next phase is conversion of C programs to Lua, interfacing to PostgreSQL, followed by a full (Yes, Lua is fast enough!) conversion of all our C programs to Lua. Operating systems used are FreeBSD 3.2 STABLE and OpenBSD 2.5 CURRENT.\n\nLua's speed and footprint are awesome. :)\n\nContact: Karl Wagner\n\nClanLib\n\nClanLib is a cross-platform Game SDK written in C++. ClanLib is under heavy development, but it has some stable versions. It currently works on Linux, Win32 and BeOS. ClanLib has support for Lua and that makes it faster to develop games. We chose Lua as scripting language to ClanLib because it is so fast.\n\nContact: Magnus Norddahl\n\nOn-line simulation of crack growth in dams\n\nCornell Fracture Group\n\nThis is educational software that we put together for crack growth in dams. We wanted to allow people to do a crack growth simulation on line. We took the (FORTRAN) core of FRANC2D, threw away the GUI, and replaced it with a scripted interface implemented in Lua. What happens is that the browser sends a message which runs a CGI script, which writes a Lua script, and runs FRANC2D on the web server. The results are then sent back as gif images. Not a very sophisticated use of Lua, but it works well in this application.\n\nContact: Wash Wawrzynek\n\nGameParts\n\nLoewen Entertainment GmbH\n\nGameParts is an object-oriented lightweight application framework for creating 2D games (mainly needed for coin-op/casino-games). Games are made up of C++ base objects and VCL-controls (Delphi C++ Builder). Some of those components are based on CDX (a popular DirectX-wrapper/sprite engine). Everything is controlled by Lua scripts, so most games can be done by visual editing of forms and define control flow/logic/animation with Lua scripts. Thanks to Lua and tolua there isn't a paradigm break between C++ and scripting and Lua adds a lot of flexibility/versatility to the OO power of C++ (in contrast to solutions based on COM/OLE automation, where passing objects between scripts and C++ code is severely limited and code gets bloated.\n\nContact: Klaus Zerbe\n\nENG32 / Station 5\n\nStation 5 is intended as a shareware Internet game with a highly configurable 3D engine called ENG32, featuring an SDK, a custom Level Editor, scripting capabilities (Lua), 3D Studio Max integration and state of the art 3D rendering. It targets mainly 3D game developers, who seek an engine upon which they can build - the Station 5 game provides a capability demo and a decent shareware game as well. The project is mid sized, featuring about 50.000 lines of C/C++ code and was designed and programmed by Harald Nowak. Since it is still under development there are no regular users now.\n\nLua was chosen as scripting language because of its ease of integration, source availability and easy extensibility. It is used to embed custom scripts in the levels for opening doors, playing sounds, switching on/off lights, changing polygon textures and performing other game relevant actions like sending / processing various messages between the moveable game entities (enemies, rotors, switches...) The scripts can be entered in the custom Leveleditor.\n\nContact: Harald Nowak\n\nCrazy Ivan Robot\n\nCrazy Ivan Robot Team\n\nCrazy Ivan was the robot that won the RoboCup 2000 in Denmark. Crazy Ivan has a \"brain\" that uses Lua for scripting language. All AI and logic is done in Lua. The brain is running on a Motorola Coldfire 5206e processor, and Lua is modified to use only int's as the Coldfire has no FPU.\n\nContact: Erik Hougaard\n\nLuaSpace\n\nComputer Science Department, PUC-Rio\n\nLuaSpace is an environment for configuring and reconfiguring component-based applications. The environment is composed of a set of tools that offer support for dynamic reconfiguration. One of these tools is a binding between Lua and CORBA - LuaOrb. The other tools are based on Lua. The generic connector is a mechanism that dynamically selects components for executing services required by an application. Exploring this approach, an application can be configured using a set of services without being aware of the specific componentes that offer these services. The components will be selected on-the-fly by the generic connector.\n\nContact: Thais Batista\n\nYindo\n\nYindo, Inc.\n\nA web browser plug-in and player for Lua with support for OpenGL. Comes with a base class implementing a NewtonScript-like object model as well as Foundation and Windowing toolkits.\n\nContact: Steve Dekorte\n\nAutomatic configuration of network devices\n\nXnet Communications GmbH\n\nThe project goal was to design a flexible system for automatic configuration of network devices through ISDN (X.75). We added data transfer functions to Lua and use it to perform communications sessions. Lua gives us flexibility to support various types of devices and configuration modes. We have chosen Lua because it is small, has great extension capabilities, nice syntax, and proved to be reliable. The system works as multi-threaded Windows NT service.\n\nContact: Maciej Maczynski\n\nPlasma Etch Simulator\n\nCornell University\n\nA plasma etch simulation was developed using Lua to allow users to modify the etch recipe, the structure being etched, or parameters of the simulator.\n\nContact: Fred Bertsch\n\nEscape From Monkey Island\n\nLucasArts Entertainment Company, LLC\n\nEscape From Monkey Island is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series of adventure games. Like Grim Fandango, it uses a modified version of Lua as the scripting interface.\n\nContact: Richard Sun\n\nTSG - The Strategy Game\n\nTSG Development Team\n\nThe Strategy Game Project is an effort to create an Open Source Engine for Real-time strategy games. This Engine can be employed to create real-time strategy games with very distinct look 'n' feel. As a part of this Project, an example game (including client software, graphics and maps) will be provided. Lua is an excellent tool to create flexible and efficient config files, engine modules and controlling scripts for our project. Good work, Lua developers :)\n\nContact: Davor Ocelic\n\nHeart Institute Monitoring Network\n\nInCor - HCFMUSP - S�o Paulo - Brazil\n\nThe Heart Institute has purchased a new line of Intensive Care Unit monitoring system. These new monitors are able to use de HL7 networking protocol. We built a system to make the data from monitoring available on line in the Web. And the Lua language was very useful. The parser of Lua language was useful to extract data from text written by the doctors as well lab results and convert this text in XML format. Also we used Lua (in the form of CGILua) as HTML script for our Monitoring Web.\n\nAn example of use of Lua tecnology in handheld devices used for Intensive Care monitoring is shown in this video from a presentation of Steve Balmer (Microsof's CEO) during a meeting in Brazil.\n\nContact: Pedro Paulo de M. Oliveira Junior\n\nU61\n\nU-Foot\n\nU61 is a block-based game which uses Lua as a scripting language. U61's main goal is to provide a solid framework for creating new block-based games (some well-known block-based games are Tetris, Columns or Puyo-Puyo...), while staying extensible with the help of Lua. As Lua is easy and quick to learn, any player who has some very basic programming skills should be able to create his own set of rules and share it with his friends. U61 is free software, distributed under the GPL.\n\nContact: Christian Mauduit\n\nCPC4400 Embedded Switching Platform\n\nPerformance Technologies, Inc.\n\nThe CPC4400 is a hot-swappable Ethernet switch in a CompactPCI 6U form factor. Lua is used to implement the CPC4400's command-line interface (CLI). Writing the CLI in Lua was far more pleasant and productive than if we had coded it in C or C++. Lua is also exposed as the scripting language of the CPC4400. The user is able to associate events (such as link status change, detection of topology changes, RMON alarms, etc.) with Lua scripts. This allows the user to customize the behavior of the CPC4400 to an unprecedented degree, and allows the CPC4400 to take intelligent action based on the user's requirements.\n\nLua was chosen over other languages because of its small memory footprint, efficient execution, ease of integrating with C code, and extensible semantics. We're already on the cutting edge by providing an Ethernet switching platform that incorporates a scripting language. But with Lua, we're really pushing the envelope by giving end users a powerful language.\n\nContact: Performance Technologies, Inc.\n\nFullMoon\n\nFullMoon is a plugin for a popular 3D modeller called Moray, extending it with new objects written in Lua. Objects are easy to write. The plugin provides an interface to Moray's API that makes it easy to write code to perform the various operations needed to obtain a fully functional object.\n\nContact: Andre de Leiradella\n\nSoul Ride\n\nSlingshot Game Technology\n\nSoul Ride is a PC snowboarding game featuring expansive real-world terrain and physics-based gameplay and character animation. We used stock Lua 3.2.2 in the engine as a configuration facility and console interface, and for scripting some game events. We dropped Lua into the engine late in development, and it proved to be simple, functional and headache-free.\n\nContact: Thatcher Ulrich\n\nLune MUD Server\n\nLune is a simple Multi User Dungeon (a text-based, multiplayer online role-playing game). I've been working on it since September 2000. It uses a modified Lua interpreter that provides a few functions for sockets, time, and directory listing. Other than that, the whole thing is written in Lua, including the data files. It currently runs on the Linux and Win32 platforms.\n\nContact: Jason Clow\n\nFree and Mighty Editor\n\nFaME is a programmer's text file editor for Windows 9x and NT.

The main application for this, is Digital-Scurf's portal site, which is constantly under development (although right now, development is paused while we work on another important project using Lua).\n\nContact: Daniel Silverstone and Robert Kendrick\n\nValkin II\n\nA fantasy role playing game (Linux based), using Lua for two main purposes: character AI and world actions. Most of the actions that can affect the world can be scripted by overloading the hardcoded behavior with a Lua script. The reasons for choosing Lua as a scripting language were mainly its speed and small memory footprint, secondary reasons being that it is a fully blown language with a neat syntax.\n\nContact: Vincent Penquerc'h\n\nUGH: Universal Game Haven\n\nThe Universal Game Haven (UGH) is a server and protocol meant to facilitate network game play, particularly of the bridge and chess variety. It is being built with the following goals in mind:\n\nsimple, textual protocol\n\nscalable to many rooms, many players per server\n\ncan be distributed over multiple servers\n\ngames written in Lua, to allow rapid development and perhaps direct play of client-programmed games\n\nContact: Noam Zeilberger\n\nHorus Alarm monitoring software\n\nAzur Soft\n\nHorus process incoming alarms from various sources: alarm transmitters, phone centers, GPS transmitters. It is mainly used for security centres in Europe (150+ sites).\n\nWe chose Lua because of it clear syntax, easy extension and reliability. We added a lot of NT core functions, a Dialogic board interface, SQLserver basic access, and redesigned the memory allocation subsystem.\n\nThe Lua interpreter is embedded in five modules of the Horus system: alarm supervisor, operator interface, remote command server, receiver and vocal server. Every module can be finely parametrized using Lua scripts, helping users sort false alarms.\n\nContact: Joel Jacob\n\nDigiTest Loop Test System\n\nTollgrade Communications, Inc.\n\nDigiTest is a next-generation telephony network testing family of products.

As SAGE fulfills a large number of functionalities, it is composed by several programs. Some of these programs were implemented using the Lua language:\n\nConditional Register (RegCond) - Using Lua configurations files, SAGE can be configured to log the values of some SCADA variables, dumping them to ASCII files whenever certain conditions are reached. The configuration file is composed by a set object descriptions (Lua table constructors) which allows the configurator to deal with a only-descritive syntax, legible to non-programmers.\n\nSAGE Shell (SASh) - This is basically a Lua interpreter linked with SAGE development libraries. With this special interpreter, programers can easily write simple scripts that access SAGE real-time database, command SCADA controls, and manage the system processes. The Lua/SAGE binding offers a high level abstraction for the concepts involved in this kind of program. As SASh is also linked with IUP/Lua, the scripts can deal with graphical widgets (dialogs, buttons, menus, etc.).\n\nDynamic Calculator - Using the functionalities of the Lua parser and interpreter, SAGE offers a dynamic calculator where the operator can easily set formulas that involve values and variables at SCADA real-time database. These formulas are calculated throughout the system execution and updated regulary, thus offering the possibility to setup calculations that were not previously expected to be needed; for example, in emergency situations.\n\nContact: sage AT cepel.br\n\nNebLUA\n\nLogic Hole Software\n\nNebLUA is a Lua script server for the 3d engine The Nebula Device.

It is cross platform between Linux, and Win9x and WinNT.\n\nNebLUA is about 1500 lines of code, and took a single programmer about a week to implement, knowing nothing about the Lua API or the Nebula API. It makes use of most of Lua's API facilities, including tag methods, garbage collection, and embedded c functions. Lua was chosen for this project because of its speed, powerful language features, and ease of embedding into the Nebula Device framework.\n\nContact: James Hearn\n\ntomsrtbt - \"The most Linux on one floppy disk\"\n\nTom's NET\n\ntomsrtbt is \"The most Linux on one floppy disk\" for: rescue recovery panic & emergencies, tools to keep in your shirt pockets, whenever you can't use a hard drive.\n\nTomsrtbt includes a Lua interpreter with luasocket, md5, and regex libraries as well as vi and emacs editors, along with other tools.

The current version (2.2) is available in Portuguese and English. Japanese and Spanish versions are on the way.\n\nPublique started in 1998 and has been developed by a team of 3 to 7 programmers during its lifetime. The production team totals 30.\n\nPublique uses a modified version of CGILua as its current web engine and consists in almost 50K lines of Lua and 5K line of C (not including CGILua itself).\n\nLua has been chosen for its ease of prototyping, speed of execution and extensibility. It is used for almost every feature in the system other than the OS Platform, DBMS and Web Server abstraction layers.\n\nContact: Andr� Carregal\n\nLabelSort\n\nIn the UK the post office offers a discount for mailshots over a certain size if they are sorted by delivery code - not the same as postcode (zip code). Labelsort takes a file of address labels, as would be sent to the printer, appends the delivery code to each postcode, and sorts the file. It works by having the post office data, listing for each delivery code which postcodes it accepts, converted into a Lua table. The table is indexed by initial letters of postcodes and its values are tables, indexed by delivery codes, of lists of patterns to match against postcodes.\n\nContact: Gavin Wraith\n\nMCCI USB DataPump and portable tools\n\nMCCI\n\nMCCI is a software IP development company, presently focused on USB. Our development tools are cross platform (both for compilation and for target system).\n\nOne of the big issues for a large commercial software project is cross-platform makes. We deliver software in source form and we need our customers to be able to build quickly. None of the previously available tools fit our needs; Lua was a key tool for solving this problem, and we now use it extensively internally and for customer deliveries.\n\nWe use Lua in the following ways:\n\nto write cross-platform portable scripts (so that we don't have to depend on 'sh' features that are not available on W32). In particular, this allows us to ship dependency checkers for third-party compilers without having to write C code, which is a great help.\n\nintegrated into a slightly augmented version of NetBSD's make, upgraded to run directly on Win32 as well as on BSD and MacOS X (again, to provide a local compute engine that can be used by MAKE instead of having to call shell scripts and external tools)\n\nto write internal scripts\n\nWe started with 3.2; are in the process of upgrading to 4.0. A small amount of work was needed in 3.2 to make it easy to do items (1) and (3).\n\nWe also had to create an MCCI standard library for Lua (written in Lua), both to allow scripts to be cross platform (hiding the details of pathnames, env variables, etc.), and to enforce a certain level of consistency.\n\nWith our local changes and development, we spent about one labor month integrating Lua into our project.\n\nWe found the language admirably suited for this need, and the interpreter shell (lua.c) and compiler shell (luac.c) were easy to modify to meet our local needs.\n\nContact: Terry Moore\n\nMeldlua\n\nMeldstar Studios\n\nMeldlua is a framework for scripting engines in Meldstar Studios' game projects. It is based on Lua 4.0 and uses a number of Meldstar only extensions. For our games, we build upon Meldlua to create the final scripting languages for each game. It is these final scripting languages that the level designers work with for extending their content. We're also looking at using Lua for configuration files; however, that's a different story.\n\nContact: Christopher S. Charabaruk\n\nAngband\n\nAngband is a freeware computer dungeon exploration game based (loosely) on the books of J.R.R.Tolkien. You explore a very deep dungeon, kill monsters, try to equip yourself with the best weapons and armor you can find, and finally face Morgoth - \"The Dark Enemy\". It is a highly portable game with versions available for Windows, MS-DOS, Linux, Amiga, RISC OS, Solaris, BSD, and many other systems. The source code for Angband (about 170,000 LOC) is freely available for non-commercial use.\n\nLua 4.0 is currently used in Angband to script the effects of magic spells and item use. The wrappers for the C functions and variables in the Angband game engine are created by tolua. Future Angband versions will extend the use of Lua to allow more customization of the gameplay. Lua was chosen as the scripting language for Angband because of its small footprint, high portability, speed, and ease of use.\n\nContact: Robert Ruehlmann\n\nLixoo 2D adventure game engine\n\nLixoo aims to be a fast, lightweight and extensible 2D adventure game engine. Lixoo's core is composed by the scripting engine provided by Lua, a plugin management system, and a minimal bunch of the engine's generic routines. Almost everything is scriptable with Lua and loadable as a plugin. This makes Lixoo extendable and a lot easier to port. We use Lua because it compiles without changes in several platforms and OSes, it's very fast and extremely small. Another interesting feature is the ability to run precompiled chunks: this way game scripts can be compiled to distribute final versions of the game.\n\nContact: Adrian Perez\n\nToME\n\nToME is a free roguelike game. It is a very evolved and deep game that started its life as a variant of Angband (of one of the variants actually) and has now grown into a wildly new game.\n\nToME uses Lua to allow customization of the engine, new quests, spells, powers, whatever. A lot is customizable thanks to Lua, and a lot more will be. Lua was selected because of its portability, smallness, clarity of syntax, tables and general neatness :)\n\nContact: DarkGod\n\nHands Browser\n\nHands Mobile Solutions\n\nHands is a Brazilian software company that provides technology for developing and deploying content, marketing and business applications to mobile platforms like PDAs and Cell Phones.

All of Psychonauts Game logic is implemented via Lua. The Level Designers use Maya to create the geometry for the levels, and then place down markers for Lua controlled Script Entities. This includes all non-player characters, platforms, puzzle pieces. Basically the game engine boots up and places the main player into a static world. Lua scripts then take over and control all interactive elements. Lua is so light and fast! It is AWESOME!\n\nContact: Dave Dixon\n\nEmotion Engine\n\nOpen Source\n\nEmotion Engine is a 3d game engine based on plib for the 3d graphics, Lua for the scripting engine and xml for the world files. Originally the engines intent was to demo and create a tutorial on how to use plib for new game developers. This idea still stands but has now grown to a 3d Engine. Currently the engine is very new and there are some design changes that have to be completed. This Engine is meant to help people get started and experiment. New developers are more than welcome, working together we can learn Engine development. This is an engine ment for making mistakes, experimenting with ideas and most importantly learning and helping others.\n\nContact: Ben Woodhead\n\nDigital Fusion\n\neyeon Software\n\nDigital Fusion is a fully integrated, non-linear compositing and special effects post-production system for finishing, design and effects creation, used extensively in many feature films, HDTV productions, broadcast video, web-based/multimedia projects and more. Lua forms the basis of 'DFScript', an integrated scripting language added in Digital Fusion v4. This allows the automation of repetitive tasks within the program, as well as facilitating integration into other aspects of a post production facility, such as clip management, 3D renderer integration, EDL/conform integration etc.\n\nContact: Peter Loveday\n\nHyperspace Delivery Boy!\n\nMonkeystone Games\n\nLua was used as the language to handle all interaction, cinematics and game logic for each level in the game. Each game level had a Lua code file that contained all game logic, dialogue, cinematic code, etc. for that particular level. The Lua code files were pure Lua source and since Lua can compile at runtime, we could edit our source and then tell the engine to reload the Lua code file to test the changes without ever recompiling the game engine. HDB uses Lua for the PocketPC, PC and Linux versions. The Game Boy Advance version's Lua code and interface was all converted to straight C due to the extreme limitations of the GBA itself.\n\nContact: John Romero\n\nZIG Game Engine\n\nSourceforge.net Project\n\nZIG is a C++ library for scripted, action-multiplayer game programming. It's intended to be used directly for simple games, or as a starting point for the development of more sophisticated \"game engines\". Lua is the scripting language of ZIG. It was chosen because it's small, fast, and easy to use. Lua code will be used in the client and in the server, for instance, to assemble and to parse the application-specific part of network packets. This means that when you connect to a server with a newer version of the software, and perhaps with a new protocol, you can just download the client Lua code and start talking the new protocol, without having to update your game's native binaries. This empowers the game developer to squeeze the last bit out of the game protocol and to make practical experiments with the protocol, all without worrying about compatability with older versions\n\nContact: Fabio Reis Cecin\n\nMonday\n\nMonday is a collection of libraries and tools for the Dylan language.

The project has 100's of thousands of lines of code and was written by ~8 programmers. Lua contributed about 50,000 lines of that code.\n\nLua was used extensively in all aspects of the game. It was used to configure almost every system and subsystem in the game. It defined and controlled the UI, managed the AI, and specified the look of the effects and other graphical entities. It was used in tuning the game in realtime, for editing unit attributes, processing the game rules, automation of tasks, and on and on.\n\nLua was chosen because of its speed, its simple syntax and its ease to understand for both programmers and designers. It was also easy to debug, modify and itegrate into our C++ game/ tools.\n\nContact: Shelby Hubick\n\nBrazilian Marines Warfare System\n\nCIASC/MB and Tecgraf/PUC-Rio partnership\n\nThe Brazilian Marines Warfare System (SJD - Sistema de Jogos Did�ticos) is a computer-assisted warfare gaming system designed to support the training of Brazilian Marine officers.

It's not just a toy mud, but a working one with over 40 missions and thousands of rooms. Lua was chosen for the ease of integration, the nice clean syntax, and the fact it is sandboxable.\n\nContact: Orange\n\nMythica\n\nMicrosoft\n\nUsed Lua on the server to script high-level behavior of entities and modules. Used Lua on the client for config stuff.\n\nContact: Curt Carpenter\n\nLantern Games Chess\n\nLantern Games\n\nWe have selected Lua 5.0 as our scripting language for Lantern Games Chess. All GUI elements are driven from Lua and the game's event handler is a Lua function. We are very pleased with the way Lua has been working for us, and we are continuing to find numerous ways to use Lua in our projects.\n\nContact: Paul Schuytema\n\nProject 193 Microcontroller\n\nThe Ohio State University Department of Engineering\n\nProject193 aims to create a robust, easy to use, general purpose microcontroller with specific considerations given to educational and robotics applications. Project 193 uses a Lua interpreter process running in the microcontroller firmware, and Lua as the target programming language for our language grammar translators.\n\nContact: Jeff McCune\n\nMeta-S\n\nJackson Solutions\n\nLua 5.0 is being incorporated into Meta-S, a parser generator, in order to allow reduction event code to be interpreted, rather than statically compiled. Since Meta-S grammars are already dynamic, the incorporation of Lua into Meta-S will finally allow parsers to be entirely defined fully at run-time.\n\nContact: Quinn Tyler Jackson\n\naXes\n\nArterial Software\n\naXes comprises a web server, a terminal server, and a set of tools that allow corporations to distribute existing AS/400 and iSeries applications via a TCP/IP network using a web browser. The web server component is called aXesW3 and the terminal server component is called aXesTS. Multiple instances of each server can be active at the same time. Commands are provided to start, stop and manage these servers. Tools are provided that allow developers to compress and decompress stream files, and to create and run script files written in the Lua language. These script files can be used to extend or customize the operation of the aXesW3 server, and can be used to write new web-based applications. The aXes implementation of Lua provides support for data queues and SQL access to AS/400 and iSeries databases.\n\nContact: Bob Moore\n\nPtokaX DC Hub\n\nPtokaX DC Hub is server application for Direct Connect P2P community. I've decided add scripting abilities on the end of 2002. Lua was exactly what I've been looking for. That time Direct Donnect was \"powered\" by Visual Basic server with VBScripting. These days more than 1400 servers out of 2200 use PtokaX and the Lua scripting popularity grows every day (check the forum).\n\nContact: Zdenek Stangl\n\nSpace Shuttle Hazardous Gas Detection System\n\nASRC Aerospace, Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA\n\nLua 4.0 was integrated into the system that is used to monitor gas concentration levels during Space Shuttle launch operations. Launch personnel use Lua to perform some of the more tedious tasks such as long duration leak testing and statistical data collection. Lua was integrated into the Windows application that provides remote control of leak detection equipment installed at the launch pad. The remote control application provides hooks into Lua that allow a Lua script to gain access to the data collected and to issue commands to the leak detection equipment. Lua was chosen mainly because it is an easy language to understand (a benefit for the launch personnel) and it is very easy to integrate into a project.\n\nContact: Charles Curley\n\nFarCry\n\nCrytek/UbiSoft\n\nFarCry uses Lua extensively for scripting all game events and AI/game logic, both for single and multiplayer game, and for realtime game editing.\n\nContact: Marco Corbetta\n\nVerbi\n\nVerbi is a wxLua small application that gives all the conjugations for italian verbs.\n\nContact: Tiago Tresoldi\n\nMetaScope\n\nKrazydad.com\n\nLua-driven, image-searching kaleidoscope simulator.\n\nContact: Jim Bumgardner\n\nVendetta\n\nGuild Software\n\nVendetta is an internet multiplayer videogame. The client runs on Mac OS X, Linux, and Windows, and the server is FreeBSD.\n\nWe currently use Lua in each of the server-side sector processes -- Lua controls every aspect of the \"game\" separately from the \"engine\" which just handles physics and keeping things in sync across the network.\n\nLua has been a joy to work with for the most part. Initially debugging was very difficult to get used to, as many typos of table members weren't caught, but we got used to it and now have a better sense of debugging in Lua. The best part is that our developer accounts can run Lua code in-game and have the output returned to us as chat messages. Thus we can change the AI behavior, create space stations and wormholes, and pretty much modify any aspect of the universe while people are still playing.\n\nWe started with Lua 4, doing nothing but controlling behavior of the non-player ships. Lua 5 came out shortly afterwards, and features like coroutines were enough of a draw for us to scrap our entire server-side code base and start over with almost everything written in Lua.\n\nWe plan to use Lua in even more aspects of the server, such as handling logins and all database queries, and also on the clients for the user interface and inventory code.\n\nContact: Andy Sloane\n\nGorky Zero\n\nMetropolis Software\n\nGorky Zero is using Lua 4 for scripting AI, game logic and user interface. It was also used for realtime game debugging and tweaking.\n\nContact: Jacek Brzezinski\n\nHomeworld 2\n\nRelic Entertainment Inc\n\nHomeworld2 is a space PC RTS game that uses Lua4 extensively in almost every aspect of the game, including the UI, AI, game rules, game flow, stats, game attributes, game tuning and automation.\n\nContact: Shelby Hubick\n\nBattle Mages\n\nTargem Ltd.\n\n\"Battle Mages\" is a high-scale modern game that combines tactical strategy, quality role-playing system and original adventure elements.

The game is being published by BBC Multimedia. The project consists of a C++ base with Lua running all the game code; we also used Lua for data description. We chose Lua because it is small and fast; we wanted a minimal script language without large CPU and memory overheads. Using Lua allowed us to develop the game very rapidly and to prototype new ideas quickly and safely. The project contains over 6000 lines of Lua code.\n\nContact: Robert Anderberg\n\nVega$ - Make It Big\n\nDeepred Games\n\nLua 4 was used extensively and successfully in the creation of the game at several levels. It was used to a significant degree in GUI creation, event handling, load/save functionality, parameter setup, scripting of maps and scenarios, object instantiation and so forth. The versatility and flexibility of Lua allowed us to move quickly when time was tight. It allowed us to tackle several fronts with minimal resources and allowed the designers the ability to tweak the game and change features on their own without much help. Due to the success of Lua 4 on this project and other prototypes, we have decided to fully commit ourselves to using Lua 5 and beyond for all our forseeable projects.\n\nContact: Simon Roper\n\nEnigma\n\nEnigma is a puzzle game, reminiscent of Oxyd and Rock'n'Roll.

Simply drag and drop rich media content such as photos, video, audio, Macromedia Flash content, text, HTML, and more directly into your project. You can tie it all together with a powerful freeform scripting engine based on the popular Lua language. This easy-to-understand scripting language features everything from \"for, repeat and while\" loops, to \"if/else\" conditions, functions, variables and tables (associative arrays). We've included a library of 350+ powerful actions (high level functions) along with built-in mathematical and Boolean evaluation. The point-and-click \"Action Wizard\" and \"Code Wizard\" make is easy enough that even complete novices can add powerful interactivity to their projects. Advanced developers will appreciate the color syntax highlighting, code completion, function highlighting, as-you-type action prototypes and Ctrl+Space function listings.\n\nContact: Brett Kapilik\n\nLuaVIEW\n\nCIT Engineering\n\nThe LuaVIEW toolkit embeds the Lua scripting language into the LabVIEW graphical data-flow language. It allows Lua scripts to be run inside the LabVIEW runtime. The Lua language can be enhanced with custom LabVIEW-implemented functions so that LabVIEW can be called and scripted. LuaVIEW also provides tools for architecting modular LabVIEW applications with improved error handling.\n\nContact: Albert-Jan Brouwer\n\nCARA - Computer Aided Resonance Assignment\n\nCARA is a novel application for the interactive analysis and assignment of NMR spectra developed by the group of Prof. Dr. Kurt W�thrich, winner of the Nobel price for chemistry 2002.

All of those things need to be simply changed by people that don't necessarilly understand programming due to the expanding nature of the game. Lua functions bound with a healthy dose of C functions results in fairly intuitive scripts. In addition, scripts are sent to clients with patch server behaviour instructions (like updating the client, changing the protocol, etc.).\n\nBearing in mind also that most of Entropy's content is procedurally generated, scripting is a logical way to define elements that rely on predictable yet unknown data, such as missions.\n\nAdded to that is the mud-like use of Lua to define server side how the game reacts to player commands, such as say, /emote etc. This also allows developers particularly powerful debugging commands.\n\nOriginally I was writing my own scripting system but why re-invent the wheel? Lua is more feature packed and versatile than anything I could've done in the time available to a game development cycle.\n\nContact: Eth\n\nJenet CAMAC crate controller\n\nZP Engineering srl\n\nA novel embedded controller for CAMAC crates (racks of equipment conforming to IEEE-583 standard, widely used in nuclear physics applications) has been designed; a local Lua engine (based on version 4.0) allows stand-alone execution of scripts at startup or under user control. Support for sockets (from Luasocket), extensions for binary operators and more than 60 custom commands specific to the underlying hardware have been added. We appreciated good performance and easy integration of the scripting engine.\n\nContact: Umberto Zanghieri\n\nSigonyth - Desert Eternity\n\nNew Desert team\n\nSIGONYTH DESERT ETERNITY is a planet of eternal desert. Most of this planet is covered with sand. It's occupied by human race called Welimars. In Welimars language Sigonyth means ETERNAL DESERT. Atmosphere on the planet is very hot what makes impossible to walk on desert without proper suits. Going to the desert without good clothes is dangerous for two reasons. High temperature makes human body to dehydrate fast what leads to death. Second danger are desert maggots hiding in the sand and mutated griffons flying in the air.\n\nWe are creating our original engine which is specially made for this game (C++ and SDL). We use Lua to make scripts that can be used to execute actions on every part of game. For example: skills description, traps description, dialog scripts.\n\nContact: Dawid Makowski\n\nArGON\n\nMatchstickware\n\n(Ar)gon (G)eneric (O)nline (N)etwork server - Mostly designed to be used to create MUDs, currently text-only, in the future it may include graphical MMORPGs. Has been in development for 2 years now, with only one programmer and no other staff. Lua is being used to allow \"builders\" to create \"worlds\" from within the server without having to write a single line of C.\n\nOriginally I had written my own script language for use with the server, but had a change of heart and swapped over to Lua for the following reasons: a) Developing and expanding my script language would have been another full-time project when ArGON takes up enough of my time already, b) Lua is widely used and therefore learning Lua is much more useful than learning yet another proprietary script language, c) Lua has more functionality than I could be bothered adding to mine, d) Lua is written in ANSI C, e) Is flexible and easily expanded, f) Out of all the other scripting languages I have looked at, it is by far the easiest to embed into software and use.\n\nContact: Jarratt Davis\n\nJukeBox VIRTUAL\n\nVortex Entertainment / Eletr�nica Vector - S�o Paulo - Brazil\n\nJukebox Virtual was the first commercial jukebox based on MP3 digital technology, fully developed in Brazil. Lua contributed by being an easy and reliable way to develop dynamic menus to the complex setting system of the machine. Before the implementation of Lua in the Jukebox Virtual, the settings system of the machine took months to be developed. After Lua, we've rewritten the entire system in just a few days. Lua eliminated the compilation problem, since we didn't need to close and recompile the entire program after each modification. Lua is also a very efficent tool to develop the advertisement system, which allow the user to program ad-banners, creating animations and simple visual effects in a simple way, using the VGM micro-engine that also implements the Lua technology and is designed to the game development market. Thanks to Lua, the owner of a JBV can customize some properties of the program.\n\nContact: Alexandre Ribeiro de S�\n\nGiggle\n\nThe Moving Picture Company\n\nGiggle is a renderman procedural DSO developed for the production of visual effects created for the film 'Troy'. This project required the rendering of scenes comprising tens of thousands of battling soldiers,in addition to complex city layouts and particle effects for flames, smoke and dust. The generation of all this geometry was handled almost exclusively at rendertime by Giggle.\n\nGiggle's core functionality comprises approximately 40,000 lines of C++, written by 2 MPC programmers over the course of 9 months. This provides many capabilities including :\n\nloading of geometry, shaders, particle caches and a proprietary cache format for agent simulations.\n\nskinning and other geometry modifiers\n\nprocedural geometry generation\n\nkd tree classes for space partitioning\n\ngeometry evaluators to perform ray intersections and closest point queries\n\nThe functionality is bound into Lua, providing a flexible scripting interface which allows it to be easily adapted to specific tasks. MPC initially chose Lua for its reputation for speed and efficiency as well as for the great simplicity of its API. It has subsequently proved itself through heavy use by a team of 16 or so CG artists and across a renderfarm of over 500 machines.\n\nSince adoption, Giggle's use has been extended to other MPC feature pipelines, and coupled with an interactive interpreter and OpenGL preview renderer to provide interactive script development and debugging.\n\nContact: John Haddon\n\nPainkiller\n\nPeople Can Fly\n\nPainkiller is a first-person horror shooter, designed to satisfy a gamer's hunger for intense, fast-paced action.

Lua has been choosen because of its easy interface for extensions, customization and integration into the application, its platform independence, its small size and because it is a technically mature, used software.\n\nContact: Heiko Bennewitz\n\nLuaMat\n\nOpFX\n\nLuaMat is dedicated to Image Processing. It includes image io, visualization, matrix linear algebra, morphology, edges detection and segmentation functions. It works with images in bytes or in floating points, 1, 2 (complex images) or 3 channels. First developed for rapid prototyping of Photoshop and DirectX filters, the design is now oriented to a general purpose image processing language. LuaMat uses Lua 5.1 and the OpenCV library. It runs as a stand-alone interpreter under Windows. Lua was chosen for its speed and for its powerful simplicity. LuaMat is still under development (integration of others algorithms).\n\nContact: OpFX\n\nHunter Dan's Bowfishing Survival Gauntlet\n\neV Interactive LLC\n\nHunter Dan's Bowfishing Survival Gauntlet is a first-person bowfishing game where the player can explore and fish in three detailed environments inluding an exotic tropical island, and an overgown stretch of the Amazon. Hunter Dan's Bowfishing Survival Gauntlet uses Lua to provide access to much of the engine's functionality. Scripted sequences, end-of-game conditions and the menu interface are all specified in Lua. Lua was chosen for its lightweight nature, ease of use, and overall simplicity.\n\nContact: Matthew Harmon\n\nFish Fillets - Next Generation\n\nFish "
