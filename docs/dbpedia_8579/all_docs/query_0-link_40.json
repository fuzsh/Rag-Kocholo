        "text": "Sketch recognition systems are currently being developed for many domains, but can be time consuming to build if they are to handle the intricacies of each domain. In order to aid sketch-based user interface developers, we have developed tools to simplify the development of a new sketch recognition interface. We created LADDER, a language to describe how sketched diagrams in a domain are drawn, displayed, and edited. We then automatically transform LADDER structural descriptions into domain specific shape recognizers, editing recognizers, and shape exhibitors for use in conjunction with a domain independent sketch recognition system, creating a sketch recognition system for that domain.Wehavetestedourframeworkbywritingseveraldomaindescriptionsandautomaticallygeneratingadomain specific sketch recognition system from each description.\n\nAbstract. Sketching activities are widely adopted during early design phases of user interface development to convey informal specifications of the interface presentation and dialog. Designers or even end users can sketch some or all of the future interface they want. With the ever increasing availability of different computing platforms, a need arises to continuously support sketching across these platforms with their various programming languages, interface development environments and operating systems.\n\nWe have created and tested Tahuti, a dual-view sketch recognition environment for class diagrams in UML. The system is based on a multi-layer recognition frame- work which recognizes multi-stroke objects by their ge- ometrical properties allowing users the freedom to draw naturally as they would on paper rather than requiring the user to draw the objects in a pre-defined manner. Users can draw and edit while viewing either their orig- inal strokes or the interpreted version of their strokes engendering user-autonomy in sketching. The experi- ments showed that users preferred Tahuti to a paint program and to Rational Rose TM because it combined the ease of drawing found in a paint program with the ease of editing available in a UML editor."
