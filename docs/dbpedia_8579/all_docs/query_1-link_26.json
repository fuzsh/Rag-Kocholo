        "text": "C++ with DirectX of OpenGL is certainly a viable possibility - if you are comfortable with C++.\n\nOther options would be Java with JOGL (binding for OpenGL), C#, or perhaps even Python with PyOpenGL.\n\nIt really depends on your programming background and what languages you feel comfortable with.\n\nWell if you are going to use C++ and OGL/DX then there is going to be a bit of code to write. OpenGL would be easier as it's less confusing and has a cleaner api.\n\nIf you just want to show off molecules and not really interested in making a program ..... you could try Luxinia ..... which uses a scripting lanuage called lua to do everything...\n\nas a user you do not need any compilers but purely work with the high-level language Lua to code your projects. The engines design goals were:\n\nEasy to use\n\nExtendable\n\nEntirely scriptable from the outside\n\nEntertaining samples\n\nCheck it out"
