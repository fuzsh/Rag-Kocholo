        "text": "It's true that \"perfect\" is a bit of an exaggeration. But don't forget the qualifier that JKMakowka used. He asked if it was the perfect \"indi\" game engine. Even Garage Game's Torque engine is commercial. Sauerbraten's competitors are, on the whole, engines that have no editors and require extensive coding. You can create a complete Sauerbraten mod using an image editor and Notepad. I know, I've done it. All of Sauerbraten's level-editing tools are built into the game engine. With Notepad (or your text-editor of choice) you can alter the engine's config files to load the level of your choice as the default level. And you can edit the menu system's attributes using the text editor as well. Level textures and GUI graphical elements can be easily constructed using any image editor. The engine already has built-in multiplayer support. And on top of all of that, its cross-platform as well. (Windows, OSX, and Linux)\n\nNow, I'm not going to say \"perfect.\" But I do think it might currently be the \"best\" game engine for indi developers. Especially since it now provides access to the source code for more in-depth mod development. Sure it has its setbacks, but it is a very good engine for getting into game modding with a minimum of frustration and expense.\n\n\"best\" heavily depends on what you want to make of it. if .bsp classic quake like levels and such are your thing, then yes sauerbraten is a really good alternative to the opensource quake stuff and many other similar engines.\n\nhowever I'd say many indie developers dont actually make quake like FPS, but other smaller games. Think of gazillion flash games (XBLA,Wii like). And albeit having a zero-cost engine (another one with similar liberal license is Irrlicht, which has an editor as well, though not cooperative map making), that wouldn't be a problem with many indie developers either who often are likely to invest a few bucks into low-cost engines (which there are plenty of at varying quality/ feature quantity...).\n\nThe market for \"indie engines\" is too big, to declare this \"enhanced quake\" like engine the winner.\n\nAll depends on what you look for... and as said indie, doesnt necessarily mean you must use \"free\" software. It's a plus. But knowing the kind of competition luxinia is in, it's not an easy undertaking and I feel that sauerbraten is too much quake, feels a bit traditional (nevertheless does that very well).\n\nAnyway next to irrlicht sauerbraten always felt very solid and not so bloated/complex as other free engines (ogre3d,crystalspace). It seeemd to be very focused on what you can make with it (which can be seen as pro or con)."
