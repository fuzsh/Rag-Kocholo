        "text": "What is the Lost Fragments?\n\nLost Fragments is an event that began March 15, 2023 that is heavily based on the Neopets game, Faerie's Hope. It will last for one week until March 23, 2023. This mini event introduces Luxinia, a light faerie, who woke up after so long on a piece of original Faerieland soil in the sky. Apparently, she has been trying to rebuild Faerieland in the sky. However, shards are now showing up in today's Faerieland on the ground. To activate the event, you must visit the Lost Fragments page. You can do this by going to Faerieland, then Faerieland City, and click on the Walein floating above Faerie Quests.\n\n\"Hello Neopians! I’d like to introduce Luxinia, a Light Faerie who was stranded on a piece of Faerieland that remained floating in the sky while the rest crashed down. With great determination, she has begun to rebuild a new Faerieland around that piece of the past. However, as you can see, we need your help.\" -Fyora\n\n\"Hello, what the Queen says is true! We have been able to slowly rebuild, but we are still learning how this magic works. It seems we never cast a spell to solidify the main island of New Faerieland and now pieces of it are crumbling, sending clumps of pink soil raining down on Neopia! If we can gather up all the pieces, I can perform a spell using the Gift of Calabrus to save the island! But it’s too much for my friends and me to do alone. If you could help, I would be eternally grateful! I’d even be happy to reward you for your efforts with some wonderful prizes my friends in New Faerieland either created or collected for me.\" - Luxinia\n\nShards of New Faerieland Soil\n\nBetween Faerieland and Faerie City, there are a total of 5 shards that are scattered and need to be found. According to Luxinia, the shards have a bit of a gleam to them to help find them between both maps. If shards are found on their release day, they award you with 5 points. Any days that are missed, you can still find those shards, however, they will award you with 1 point.\n\nFragments in Faerieland\n\nPrizes\n\nBelow you can view the prizes available along with how many points you need to claim them. Pleaste note, even if you gain the maximum points in this event you will not be able to claim all the prizes. Some items can already be obtained such as through the Hidden Tower, or have been obtainable in the past in other ways such as plot prizes. So choose wisely.\n\nPrizes\n\nFaeries Hope Magical Mystery Capsule\n\nView Preview\n\n150 NC\n\nJar of New Faerieland Dirt\n\n1 Point\n\nPetpet Icon Gummies\n\n2 Points\n\nWaleins Horn\n\n2 Points\n\nTias Handmade Blanket\n\n4 Points\n\nTrinket of Calabrus\n\n4 Points\n\nVarias Hairspray\n\n4 Points\n\nLuxinias Destroyed Diary\n\n8 Points\n\nFaerieland Employment Agency Employee Handbook\n\n8 Points\n\nFaerie Queen Wings\n\nView Preview\n\n8 Points\n\nFaerie Buzz Plushie Collectable Charm\n\n10 Points\n\nShirt Designed by Tia\n\nView Preview\n\n10 Points\n\nFaerie Kacheek Plushie\n\n12 Points\n\nFaerie Sparklecake\n\n12 Points\n\nNimmo Faerie Tales\n\n12 Points\n\nJoretts Chef Special\n\n15 Points\n\nNephrites Notes\n\n15 Points\n\nCalabrus, Cloud Aisha (TCG)\n\n15 Points\n\nStuck in Crystal Wearable\n\nView Preview\n\n15 Points\n\nGift of Calabrus\n\nView Preview\n\n20 Points\n\nFaerielands Destruction Background\n\nView Preview\n\n25 Points\n\nVaria is the Bomb\n\n25 Points\n\nNew Faerieland Stamp\n\n25 Points\n\nSpace Faerie Snowglobe\n\n25 Points\n\nCulture and History of Faerieland\n\n55 Points\n\none per user\n\nFaerie Snowbunny\n\n55 Points\n\none per user\n\nFaerie Petpet Paint Brush\n\n55 Points\n\none per user\n\nShield of Faerieland\n\n55 Points\n\none per user\n\nFaerie Paint Brush\n\n70 Points\n\none per user\n\nFyora the Faerie Queen (TCG)\n\n70 Points\n\none per user\n\nLight Faerie Doll\n\n70 Points\n\none per user\n\nAvatar\n\nOnce you find your first shard, you will be awarded with a brand new avatar!\n\nFAQs\n\n1. What is the Lost Fragments event about? And what does it have to do with Faerie’s Hope?\n\nThe Lost Fragment event is about how pieces of New Faerieland are falling down all around Faerieland and Faerie City. Luxinia needs your help collecting them so that she can take all the pieces back up to her island and perform a spell to keep the home she has been rebuilding from falling apart completely. To learn more about Luxinia and her friends up on New Faerieland, you can play Neopets: Faeries Hope available on Google Play and App Store!\n\n2. Who is Luxinia?\n\nLuxinia is a light faerie who awoke with amnesia on a recently discovered piece of Faerieland that was still floating in the sky. No one is quite sure how she or the island she now lives on survived, but she’s determined to find out more about her past as well as bring new life to her little island!\n\n3. How long will the event last?\n\nThe Lost Fragments event will last for about a week, running from March 15th to March 22nd. However, Luxinia has promised to keep the prize shop open so that Neopians will be able to return and turn in their points for fabulous prizes!\n\n4. Where can I spend my shard points?\n\nEach shard you find will earn you points that you can then spend in the prize shop Luxinia has set up!\n\n5. How do I earn Lost Fragments points?\n\nYou will earn points (see 6. below) for each shard you find across Faerieland and Faerieland City! To collect shards, all you need to do is click on them. Be sure to keep an eye out for the sun sparkling off of them!\n\n6. Do I have to collect shards every day?\n\nYou can find shards in any order or on any day even if the day they originally appeared has passed, however, you will earn 5 points for finding shards on the day they appear and only 1 point for shards from previous days. So best to keep an eye out each day!\n\nPoints Description 5 Found on day they are released. 1 Found after the day they were released.\n\n7. How many shards can I collect each day?\n\n5 new shards will appear each day across the Faerieland and Faerie City maps. However, even if you miss a day during the event, you will still be able to collect the shards that appeared that day throughout the rest of the event.\n\n8. Can I do this event on my side accounts too?\n\nNo, of course not!"
