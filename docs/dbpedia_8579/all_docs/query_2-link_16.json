        "text": "How about lua?\n\nThere is nice graphic \"engine\" called LOVE which is fully programmable in lua. It has nice documentation and it's not very hard.\n\nThere are also several other similar engines using lua:\n\nNovashell\n\nVerge\n\nLuxinia\n\nAgen\n\nThere was another 2d engine, but I can't find it at the moment, it was similar to LOVE, but with a little different approach to things.\n\nI would recommend LOVE for starters as it's very easy, has nice tutorials and most importantly you can do nice stuff right away.\n\nAlso lua is commonly used as game scripting language. For example all addons for World of Warcraft are written in lua, in fact all of the interface is written in lua. It means that it's very easy to find answers to game related questions in lua. Also if you happen to own a game which uses lua as scripting language, you could easily add your own stuff to it.\n\nI wrote this from game perspective, but there are quite a lot projects which use lua as scripting language.\n\nYou could also try python, but it doesn't have so good out of the box, ready to use and easy to learn/understand tools."
