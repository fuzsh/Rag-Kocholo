Bang Boom! in 1minute calculation Unrwella does the job without human mistakes, that’d have taken you half an hour by hand!\n\nBut in my case I only obtained messy results and never managed to get the quality they claim : I’ve got a 4legged animal with pelt seams properly defined, somewhat cylindrical mapping all the way around its body as a start : as soon as I bring the Unwrella Max modifier on top of it : it re-splits everything like every single triangle apart :?:\n\nWe use http://www.uvlayout.com/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=38 which is pretty awesome and quick\n\nYeah uvlayout appears to be the best (but dodgy UI).\n\nThe magic algorythm behind is called “Least Squares Conformal Mapping”.\n\nBlender’s got it built-in, I quite like this simple plugin for 3dsmax though :\n\nhttp://www.luxinia.de/index.php/ArtTools/3dsmax\n\nEditable Polys only for now : I’d love to see that thing working on patches btw, for my lod production pipeline (source code kindly provided by Christoph Kubisch aka ‘CrazyButcher’).\n\nActually ABF (Angle Baed Flattening) seems to be better :\n\nThere’s RoadKill : http://www.pullin-shapes.co.uk/page8.htm\n\nAnd also Zebruv : http://r4inm4ker.blogspot.com/2008/08/zebruv-released.html with ABF++ now (“better ABF”?)\n\nUsually I tend to prefer simple plugins rather than standalone apps just for the sake of avoiding another import/export pass in a pipeline… (but I guess that’s how some people can make money by selling yet another third party software)\n\nWe are using Roadkill here, but that is giving problems with max 2010\n\nAnother vote for UVLayout from Headus. Good balance for generating baking friendly UVs and artist friendly UVs. Works well even with sloppily made 3d objects."
