C++ with DirectX of OpenGL is certainly a viable possibility - if you are comfortable with C++.

Other options would be Java with JOGL (binding for OpenGL), C#, or perhaps even Python with PyOpenGL.

It really depends on your programming background and what languages you feel comfortable with.

Well if you are going to use C++ and OGL/DX then there is going to be a bit of code to write. OpenGL would be easier as it's less confusing and has a cleaner api.

If you just want to show off molecules and not really interested in making a program ..... you could try Luxinia ..... which uses a scripting lanuage called lua to do everything...

as a user you do not need any compilers but purely work with the high-level language Lua to code your projects. The engines design goals were:

Easy to use

Extendable

Entirely scriptable from the outside

Entertaining samples
