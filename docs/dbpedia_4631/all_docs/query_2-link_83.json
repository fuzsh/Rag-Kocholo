        "text": "What is one of the coolest things to happen when you choose your life partner? It is to find someone with the same mental disorder as yours (funs intended). We all are weird and when we find our soulmate, who is as weird as we are then it is like a cherry on the cake. When you two can act weird in public without getting embarrassed and enjoy each other’s weirdness, then the feeling of being in a perfect relationship becomes surreal. It is difficult to find someone with the same mental disorder as yours, but if you find one, we advise you to keep him/her as close as possible. Lucky are those who are compatible with their partners at every level. And the telly world’s cutest couple, Mohit Sehgal and Sanaya Irani are one of those lucky couples who match at every level.

Post confessing their love for each other, the madly-in-love couple had dated each other for five years before tying the knot on January 25, 2016, in Goa. The duo’s happily ever after is filled with adventure, love, romance, and understanding and their social media handles are proof for the same. The duo has been going strong within their marriage and has been giving #CoupleGoals to all the couples. Their level of weirdness matches each other’s and we totally love to see them making fun of each other and enjoying each other’s company.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn a throwback interview with the Verve magazine, Sanaya Irani had talked about her dream wedding and had said, “I’ve always dreamt of looking pretty in a beautiful gown on the beach and having not more than 50 people at my wedding, which will be followed by a night-long party.\" And her wedding with Mohit was exactly the same. On January 25, 2020, the duo completed 4 years of marital bliss and they wished each other with dreamy pictures and lovely captions that perfectly define their relationship. Sharing a goofy picture, Mohit wrote, “Yay !!! We didn't kill each other and i am still alive. Happy anniversary baby. Love u #us @sanayairani.” While Sanaya kept it simple and wrote, “Happy #US 4 years and counting @itsmohitsehgal.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn January 1, 2020, Sanaya and Mohit had given us couple goals as they had rung in the New Year with a cute liplock picture in the midst of snow.

Happy New year everyone have a great year ahead.\" On the other hand, Mohit had written, \"Bringing in 2020 with love and happiness.\" (Suggested Read: Amitabh Bachchan And Jaya Bachchan Twin In White, Look Perfect And Match Made-In-Heaven)\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn September 14, 2019, Sanaya had given us another reason to fall for their chemistry. The actress had taken to her Instagram handle and had shared a mushy picture with her husband, Mohit, wherein the two could be seen doing their makeup together. Sanaya had captioned the picture as \" The couple that lives together also does make up together @itsmohitsehgal filling in his beard while I fill in my lips. Marriage = companionship and also = no sense of personal space.\"\n\nadvertisement.\n\nIn an interview with The Times of India, Sanaya had talked about the love of her life, Mohit, who has taken a break from television and had shared, \"When I married Mohit, all that mattered was the person that he is. It’s okay if he is figuring out what to do. I believe that luck and destiny play a big role in success. Mohit is not running away from acting, he is just waiting for the right opportunity. Also, he is currently focussing on an alternate plan. I have always told him that the luxuries, like a house and a car, are not important, but we are. I have seen how people would react to Mohit when he was famous and how they react to him today. But that doesn’t affect me; the fact is that I go back home with him and none of those people do.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn an interview with a leading portal, Mohit had shared how he had proposed to Sanaya. He had shared that there wasn't any romantic proposal or going down on one knee thing did not happen as they had said a 'silent yes' long before. He had said, \"I declared the love after the first season and Arjun Bijlani was the first to know because he always used to tease Sanaya and me saying that there is something going on between me and her. Sanaya was particular that we would say it together to him as she wants to see his expression when we break the news to him. And finally, when we told him that we want to say something, he just asked us ‘what? That you guys are in love with each other?’ for which we couldn’t say anything because we were taken aback with his question.\" (Must Read: Taimur Ali Khan And Kareena Kapoor Khan Kickstart Their Weekend With A Play Date With Peppa Pig)\n\nADVT.\n\nHere's wishing Mohit and Sanaya, a happy wedding anniversary!\n\nadvertisement\n\nImages Courtesy: Sanaya, Mohit\n\nAWESOME NEWS!
