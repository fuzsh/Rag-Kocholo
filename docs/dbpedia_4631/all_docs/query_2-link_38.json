Even though she hasn't starred in any serial in past few years, she continues to have one of the biggest fan followings across social media. Sanaya is currently vacationing in Goa with husband and 'Nagin' actor Mohit Sehgal. Sanaya, who is arguably one of the fittest actors of her generation, likes to eat clean even on a holiday, and her breakfast is proof.
