        "text": "The modelling industry in South Asia continues to flourish, featuring amazing and stunning Indian models. Showing off their gorgeous looks and beautiful figures, they tantalise fans with their photoshoots.\n\nMany usually begin their careers in beauty pageants such as Miss India, soon landing outstanding success.\n\nFrom walking Lakmé Fashion Week to gracing celebrated magazine covers such as Vogue India or GQ India, these models transform into household names. With the potential to bag phenomenal careers in Bollywood.\n\nModelling opens the doors for many of them to transcend towards cinema, especially Bollywood, and television.\n\nDid you know the likes of Aishwarya Rai, Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif began first as models? We wonder if the entries on our list will achieve the same success?\n\nDESIblitz presents you with the 10 hottest Indian models that look totally amazing!\n\nUrvashi Rautela\n\nDate of Birth: 25/02/1994\n\nStatistics: 34:25:35\n\nDespite her young age of 23, Urvashi Rautela hails as one of India’s most successful models. She entered the industry whilst studying college and soon turned heads.\n\nHer first appearance was at Wills Lifestyle Indian Fashion Week in 2011. Urvashi also walked down the runway for Lakmé Fashion Week in the same year.\n\nWith her measurements at 34:25:35, the model has won many accolades in beauty pageants. In 2009, she won Miss Teen India, guided by her mentor Diana Hayden, Miss World 1997 winner.\n\nUrvashi also won Miss Asian Super World in 2011 and represented India for the Miss Universe pageant in 2015.\n\nThe model has landed a rising career in Bollywood, debuting in Singh Saab The Great (2013), starring opposite Sunny Deol. Since then, she’s featured in Sanam Re (2014) and Great Grand Masti (2016).\n\nNatasha Suri\n\nDate of Birth: 15/05/1984\n\nStatistics: 36:23:36\n\nNatasha Suri is another of our Indian models who achieved great success in beauty contests. Her first win came in 2002 when she won Navy Girl.\n\nThroughout her career, she landed the crown of Miss India 2006 and also became a Miss World semi-finalist in the same year. A popular entry, the competition witnessed her win Best Designer Gown.\n\nHer most famous asset is her hourglass waist, measured at a jaw-dropping 23 inches!\n\nWhile she is a regular at international fashion shows, Natasha has graced the covers of several magazines. These include Cosmopolitan, Maxim and Elle.\n\nNidhi Sunil\n\nDate of Birth: 30/03/1993\n\nStatistics: 32:24:35\n\nNidhi Sunil has become a household name as her modelling career goes from strength to strength. But did you know she originally planned to pursue law? During education, Nidhi was actually a law student, eager to become a lawyer!\n\nIn Bangalore, she did production work for a model hunt where she was spotted by beauty pageant organisers. They offered her a spot in their contest; while she didn’t win, this marked the beginning of a new, successful path for Nidhi.\n\nShe has appeared on a range of popular magazines, such as GQ India, Vogue India and Harper Bazaar. With her measurements at 32:24:35, she is another model who oozes beauty and sex appeal.\n\nThe starlet has also spoken out on topical issues, such as fair skin. In January 2018, she revealed how online trolls mocked her dusky complexion and said: “When I started modelling in India, it was definitely a problem to be my skin tone.\n\n“You can’t do print or TV commercials [if you’re dark]—you basically couldn’t work with brands because the way you look would never sell anything. There’s definitely not as much representation internationally for us, as there is for the fair-skinned.”\n\nLiz Mittra\n\nStatistics: 32:22:34\n\nLiz Mittra, real name Apoorav Elizbeth Mittra, is an Indian model that hails from Chennai. Winning multiple beauty pageants, she’s also walked the runway for top designers such as Rohit Bal and Chaitanya Rao.\n\nWith her enchanting looks and slim figure, sporting a 22′ waist and 34′ hips, Liz always captivates her fans in photoshoots.\n\nNo wonder then she has found great success in America. She moved to Los Angeles and continues to model, particularly appearing in music videos. This even includes The Weeknd and NAV‘s collaborative video ‘Some Way’.\n\nAs her career grows to new heights, perhaps we could even see Liz pursue acting? We reckon she would make a great choice for a Hollywood, or even Bollywood, movie!\n\nMariette Valsan\n\nStatistics: 32:25:37\n\nMariette’s career began in 2011 when she was spotted by designer James Ferreira. She soon walked for him down the catwalk at the Kochi Fashion Week 2011 and from there, her popularity grew.\n\nShe featured on the programme Hunt for the Kingfisher Calendar Girl 2012, where she was placed in the top six. An aspiring actress, the model has also appeared in an array of commercials, for brands such as The Bombay Times and Grey’s Anatomy for the Star World.\n\nMaxim, Haute Brides, Femina and more have featured her on their magazine covers. Her body measurements stand at 32:25:37, giving her a luscious, voluptuous figure.\n\nWith determination and passion, she truly enjoys modelling, telling BeBoldPeople:\n\n“I think it gets hard because one is required to look a certain way every single day. Of course I’ve had my days where I question my sanity, but then I remind myself of why I am doing this.”\n\nIshit Yamini\n\nStatistics: 34:26:33\n\nIshit Yamini is a model who enchants fans with her captivating looks and stunning poses. With a 26′ waist, 34′ bust and 36′ hips, she commands the camera’s attention and dazzles with her beauty.\n\nThe Bihar star has found fantastic success in beauty pageants. She won the crown for Miss Bihar 2013 and became a finalist for the Campus Princess 2014 contest. In addition, she was runner-up for KS Miss Maxim 2015.\n\nDuring her career, Ishit has walked the ramp for Kingfisher Ultra Indore Fashion Week 2016 and Kingfisher Ultra Chandigarh Style Week 2016. At these events, she showed off pieces created by Hari Anand, Nazia Syed and Mumtaz Khan.\n\nThe model also oozes sex appeal in magazine photoshoots, her most notable being Creme Magazine, Fashion Zone and Inner Secrets Magazine.\n\nZoya Afroz\n\nDate of Birth: 10/01/1994\n\nStatistics: 32:24:33\n\nZoya Afroz gained fame when she appeared in Pond’s Femina Miss India Indore 2013, eventually winning the crown.
