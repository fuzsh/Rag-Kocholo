The post, which featured a series of her recent pictures, quickly spread across digital platforms, sparking a frenzy of speculation and making her the talk of the town. Her noticeably transformed appearance led many to wonder if she had undergone cosmetic surgery.\n\nIn an interview with HT City, Rimi addressed these rumors head-on. She remarked, “Agar logon ko aisa lag raha hai ki maine plastic surgery karvayi hai… if it’s in a good way, it’s very good for me. Bina plastic surgery karaye bina hi log bol rahe hain. I have only got fillers, Botox, PRP treatment done, nothing else.\" By clarifying that her new look was the result of non-surgical treatments such as fillers, Botox, and PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) therapy, she aimed to put the rumors to rest.\n\nThe 42-year-old actor, known for her roles in films like Dhoom, Golmaal: Fun Unlimited, and Johnny Gaddaar, shared her views on cosmetic surgery. She stated, “One shouldn’t need to get plastic surgery done unless someone is on the run after committing any crime! There are so many good doctors outside India, who are very good at facelifts. I too want to get it done, but I will think about it after I reach the age of 50. Abhi inn sab se kaam chal raha hai.\" Rimi mentioned that she is currently under the care of two doctors for her cosmetic consultations and treatments.\n\nRimi further explained how her doctors have significantly helped her maintain her appearance, implying that her improved skin in the recent photos might be due to their expertise. “They help me a lot to look good. Shayad logon ko meri latest pics mein skin achha lag raha hoga mera. Anyone can look good by using these things, and having discipline,\" she said. She also welcomed constructive criticism, adding, \"But if you are calling what I have done bad, then tell me how can I correct it, so I can tell my doctors where they are going wrong. I can say isko correct kar do.\"\n\nThrough this candid conversation, Rimi Sen not only addressed the swirling rumors but also shed light on the pressures and misconceptions surrounding beauty and cosmetic procedures in the entertainment industry. Her transparency and humor in discussing such a personal topic resonate with many, offering a refreshing perspective on the choices individuals make regarding their appearance.\n\nImage Source: Instagram\n\nUp Next\n\nGudgudi: Rajshri Deshpande's Short Film Based On 2002 Gujarat Riots 2002 To Screen At Odense International Film Festival\n\nDon't Miss\n\nAvinash Tiwary Expresses Gratitude As Laila Majnu’s Re-Release In Kashmir Receives Praises From Fans; Says, ‘So Many Beautiful Memories Are Coming Back’\n\nAdvertisement"
