        "text": "\"Ukrainian women may not be so easy to spot in society, because most of them are in brothels.\" told Swedish journalist Elaf Ali on the main Swedish channel SVT. It is extremely unacceptable to spread racist stereotypes about Ukrainian women or any other group. To generalize and stigmatize people in this way is reprehensible and goes against basic principles of human dignity and respect. Journalists have a responsibility to report objectively and with empathy, and spreading such prejudicial claims is completely unacceptable. In the past two years, I have personally supported thousands of Ukrainian women and their families, many of whom came to Sweden with their children and elderly relatives. It is important to point out that many Ukrainian men, including husbands and boyfriends, are remaining in Ukraine to protect their country from an invasion, rather than flee to other countries first, as some people from other countries have done. Their narratives serve as a poignant reminder of the bravery and resilience essential for navigating challenges and striving towards a brighter tomorrow. Furthermore, being subject to suspicion and surveillance based on appearance or ethnic origin is deeply unpleasant and offensive. No one should be afraid or suspect just because of their background or appearance. It is high time to take responsibility for your actions and words, and measures are required to counter racism and promote respect, understanding and equality in society. The person spreading such prejudicial claims should be fired and those responsible should deal with this serious problem constructively and effectively. @IFS‚Äì Invandrare f√∂r svenskar #svt #racism #humanity #humanrights #Rasistiskastereotyper #Generalisering #Stigmatisering #M√§nskligv√§rdighet #empati #Respekt #Samh√§llet\n\nThe Wedding sessionüë∞ unfolds with business worth Rs.4.25 trillion and 38 lacs expected weddings along with the number, my attention is also drawn to the traditional wedding songs and the lines common in all such songs are \"Beti Chali Babul Ki Gali Chor Ke\"üò¢ \"Betiyaan Hoti Hai Parayiii!!\"ü´§ Isn't it the time to question the narrative and reconsider how we perceive girls in the context of marriage? Can we(the betiyaans)üôãbe treated as Apna Dhan and not as Paraya Dhan? Can anyone explain the narrative of Paraya Dhan?ü§∑ What exactly make girls\"paraya dhan\"? Is it merely because of the change üîÅof surname but isn't that an option? Yes it is!‚úÖ or does it hinge on the conventional idea that girls move to the boy's house? What about couples who embrace a more modern approach, opting for a nuclear family or even having the boy join the girl's family? In that case is a boyüßí parayadhan too? No‚ùå In a world where we applaud influential women as CEOsüßëüéì, political leadersüßë‚öñÔ∏è, actresses and many more important roles in the society, labeling any girl as \"paraya dhan\" is it still justified‚ùì I guess NO! Similarly none of the girls are paraya dhan. I wish I could go back to the time to rewrite the lyrics to \"betiyaan NAHI hoti hai parayii\" so that the girls feel inclusive,loved and empowered.üí™ PS: I agree this is not a motivational post or a technical post. But ain't i allowed to express my opinions and views? Comment below yours. #empoweringwomen #freewill #outofthebox\n\n#genderbasedviolence We are not asking a life of luxury; all females want to be free from all forms of violence. Why is respecting our #humanrights so difficult? #genderequality is a luxury for Ethiopian #women. I want to express to you my worry about the frequent cases of #genderbasedviolence and abduction in #Ethiopia. Many of you have probably heard of the 9 year old girl raped and killed by four #cruel #men in #JijigaSomali region. And within a week or two, you would hear about an #abduction or a #rape case in #Ethiopia on various news outlets. Many of us are aware that #rape is used as a #warweapon and that huge number of #females are raped because of the #conflict. What was happening to our \"virtuous society\" I wondered. Are we going to tolerate #genderbasedviolence as something that happens frequently the same way as we accept #civiliandeaths as a common thing? When there are so many #women being #raped and #abducted around #Ethiopia, whom shall we ask to get #justice? Until when we have to wait to use #socialmedia and #peacefulrallies to make #justice to be served? #Please don't think of this as a one time thing. #All of us muse work #together to #serve #justice and #speak with one voice, or else we will all be confronted with the problem. #justice #genderbasedviolence Picture: OpenGlobalRights\n\nAyahs were Indian women who were hired by the wealthy British families to care for their children. By the late 19th century Ayahs were the backbone of British families in colonial India. The British mistresses depended heavily on Indian maids in bringing up their children. But their attitudes towards Ayahs (and Indian servants) were very unkind. Thousands of Ayahs from India and other parts of Asia were brought to London to look after young children. They were made to look after and entertain their children during long sea journeys. Many of them were eventually abandoned without any pay or arrangements for their way back home. These women often took to advertisements in local newspapers, asking for help to travel back home. Soon The Ayahs‚Äô Home was established to house, feed, clothe, and protect Ayahs in England. The British children became more familiar with Indian languages and culture because of the close relationship they shared with their Ayah. This broke racial boundaries because Ayahs were raising white children. Ayahs had a lasting impact on the British generations. Impacts that were undesirable to the British, as Victorians believed children were being ‚Äúculturally contaminated‚Äù by a ‚Äúweaker race‚Äù. However, this did not cease the employment of Ayahs, their expertise with children was undeniably excellent. In many parts of the world, including South Asia, the term \"Ayah\" continued to be used to refer to female caregivers or nursemaids. Even today, nannies and Ayahs play an essential role in supporting families. #SheThePeople #womenempoweringwomen #womenentrepreneurs #womeninmedia #womensupportingwomeninbusiness #women #womeninmedicine #womenempowerment #womeninbusiness #womeninleadership #womeninmedicine #womensupportingwomen #womeninpower #womenhealth #womenentrepreneurs #womeninconsulting"
