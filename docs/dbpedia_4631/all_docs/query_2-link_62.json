        "text": "Tantrums, show offs and mood swings while shooting stand to be some of the common traits find in stars, be it from Bollywood or the world of television. Stars are never their self minus their starry affair.\n\nAmongst all of the annoying habits they tend to develop with their increasing stardom, dropping down on the sets way too late is the most irksome. Apparently, with them coming late on sets, it not only kills the time of other people linked with the project but even hampers the venture.\n\nHowever, television actress Sanaya Irani, whom you all love and adore as the very chirpy and fun loving Khushi alongside Barun Sobti aka Arnav from Star Plus’ Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, stands to be an exception. The pretty lady values time a lot and says that it is utmost important for all to respect time and abide by it. Sanaya holds a view that while being in a professional world one has to make sure to respect others’ work too. She believes that by reaching the sets on time, she tries to do her bit in helping things run in a smooth and organized manner.\n\nSanaya further states that along with herself abiding by time, she makes it a point to value the time of others too! This is the reason she never lets her crew members face any sort of inconvenience with time and makes it a point to reach the shooting place without any delay."
