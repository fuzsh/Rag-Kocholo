        "text": "We all are a little weird! And when we find someone whose level of weirdness matches ours, we join up with them and fall in mutual weirdness and call it love. While Indian television is filled with the tales of true love, it is Sanaya Irani and Mohit Sehgal that give us chills with their epic love. (Recommend Read: Unseen Picture of Radhika Merchant From Her Graduation Ceremony Where She Couldn't Stop Laughing)\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter all these years, Sanaya still remembers how they first met on Mohit’s debut show, Miley Jab Hum Tum. And that was the start of their beautiful journey together. The actress had revealed in an interview that it was day one of their schedules when she met nervous Mohit on the sets and they were soon joined by their directors for a meeting. Once the meeting came to an end, something unexpected happened. The two looked at each other and burst out laughing and that’s when they felt the connection.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nSanaya and Mohit had a lovely beach wedding in Goa on January 26, 2016. Since then they have been giving us couple goals with their adorable social media PDA. While we miss seeing them together on the small screen, Sanaya doesn’t want to work with her husband, Mohit. In an interview with Pinkvilla, Sanaya revealed the reason behind it, and stated, “I keep telling Mohit that we shouldn't work together because I feel at some time, couples start taking each other for granted. I value what I have with him at home more than making money with you onscreen.” (Also Read: Deepika Padukone's Witty Reply When Anisha Padukone Said She Can't Pronounce 'Cannes' Correctly)\n\nadvertisement\n\nWell, Sanaya and Mohit are not like regular couples, they believe in their love and hence, they worked hard to strike a perfect balance between their professional and personal life. Once in an interview, Sanaya had stated, \"Sometimes when we don’t spend time together, Mohit gives me surprises like flowers, breakfast in bed, date nights and the like.\"\n\nadvertisement\n\nMohit had also quipped about his relationship once and was quoted as saying, \"Sometimes, I think that Sanaya’s favourite hobby is feeding me. She has been experimenting in the kitchen, trying new recipes. She’s a good cook, so dinner is always a treat for me.\" To which Sanaya had shared, \"Khana tayyar hota hai jab Mohit ghar aata hai. I recently made these chocolates covered strawberries. As a dutiful wife, main kuch na kuch bana rahi hoon.\" She had further added, \"Sabse mushkil ek kaam couple ke liye decide karna kya khana hai. Sabse ganda decision hota hai.\" (Don't Miss: Sameera Reddy Lashes Out At Moms Who Judged Kareena Kapoor Khan For Being Working Mother)\n\nWell, we love Sanaya and Mohit's adorable chemistry!
