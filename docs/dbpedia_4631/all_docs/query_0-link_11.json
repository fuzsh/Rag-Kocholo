She was last seen in Rangrasiya show but the actress took a break from the small screen to swiftly “shift gears”. “It may not necessarily be for the better, but I just want to do it,” she says. (By: Neha Maheshwri)\n\nIn an exclusive interview with BT, Sanaya shares, “I have worked non-stop for 12 years and today, I have reached a stage where I can afford to do what I want to. I took a break from fiction after 'Rangrasiya', because nothing interesting was being offered to me. I don’t want to be an actor who works non-stop for money. As a medium, TV has changed, and I don’t see myself fit into that space. If you look at my work, I have always picked up shows with an ensemble cast. I never wanted to play the protagonist because I wasn’t fluent in Hindi and felt that I couldn’t act to save my life. However, 'Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon' changed the course for me. Though the story narrated to me was about four people, my character became the protagonist, eventually.”\n\nSanaya further added saying, “I am what I am because of TV and I am not saying no to it. I am just declining the work that’s coming to me. Taking this break hasn’t been easy; every day, you wonder if you are making a mistake. I am waiting for that one phone call, which would prove that I haven’t made a mistake, but that call hasn’t come yet. Maybe, a year later, I will get tired of waiting for my dream role and take up everything that comes my way.”\n\nShowbiz was not a planned move for Sanaya. She explains, “I never aspired to be famous; I think I got lucky. Actually, I feel uncomfortable when people recognise me. In fact, I cover my face when I go sabzi shopping. It’s a complex, which I developed years ago. During my boarding school days, other students would call me ‘white cockroach’ and ‘white lizard’ because of my fair skin. Back then, I would wonder why I was born with this complexion. Many people think that it’s a boon to be fair; if only they could see it through my eyes. So, I am obsessed with tanning myself.”\n\nOn the work front, just when it seemed that challenging characters had dried up on the small screen and now she is trying her luck in movies. Interestingly, the actress was averse to trying her luck in films in the beginning. She says, “I always feared the casting couch. Not that I would have taken it lying down; I would have beaten the sh*t out of him. I took up this film, because a friend was originally supposed to direct it, though he didn’t eventually. However, in hindsight, I am happy that I didn’t start with films, as I learnt a great deal on TV. Even if I make a mistake in one episode, I can always improve myself in the next telecast.”\n\nSanaya got married to her co-star Mohit Sehgal on January 2016. The actor has been on a break since a long time now. Wifey Sanaya says, “Mohit hasn’t taken a break. He is willing to work in any medium, but usme kuchh toh hona chahiye. Besides, we were clear that we should have an alternate source of income. So, Mohit is in the process of opening a restaurant in Delhi with his sister.”\n\nShowbiz is a tough industry, and of late, Mohit has not got his due on TV. However, Sanaya says that hasn’t disrupted their equation at home. “When I married Mohit, all that mattered was the person that he is. It’s okay if he is figuring out what to do. I believe that luck and destiny play a big role in success. Mohit is not running away from acting, he is just waiting for the right opportunity. Also, he is currently focussing on an alternate plan. I have always told him that the luxuries, like a house and a car, are not important, but we are. I have seen how people would react to Mohit when he was famous and how they react to him today. But that doesn’t affect me; the fact is that I go back home with him and none of those people do,” she says.\n\nWhile they may be part of the glamour industry, Mohit and Sanaya have ensured that they stay grounded and in touch with reality. Tell her how she is more popular than her husband and she says, “Of course. We would be fooling each other if we didn’t know that. I always tell Mohit that there will be a day when I hold his hand and walk down the red carpet, in a designer dress that he has bought for me.”"
