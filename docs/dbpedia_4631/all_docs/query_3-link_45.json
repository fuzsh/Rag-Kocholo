Sanaya Irani once went on record to said that she never wants to work with Mohit Sehgal on-screen.\n\nWell, in an interview Sanaya revealed the reason behind it, and stated, “I keep telling Mohit that we shouldn't work together because I feel at some time, couples start taking each other for granted. I value what I have with him at home more than making money with you onscreen.”\n\nSanaya and Mohit are not like regular couples, they believe in their love and hence, they worked hard to strike a perfect balance between their professional and personal life. Once in an interview, Sanaya had stated, \"Sometimes when we don’t spend time together, Mohit gives me surprises like flowers, breakfast in bed, date nights and the like.\"\n\nAlso read: Check out the prominent on-screen roles of telly actress Sanaya Irani\n\nStay tuned to this space for more updates and gossips."
