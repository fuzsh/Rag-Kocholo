The duo never shies away from showing their love for each other. Now, Sanaya has shared something really sweet for her husband that will melt your heart. She shared a black and white picture with Mohit and gave a long heartwarming caption to it. In the post she shared how much of a free soul she has been since her childhood and how even after marriage, not once has her husband asked her to change. She calls their love ‚Äúrare‚Äù.\n\nTaking the picture to her Instagram, Sanaya wrote, ‚ÄúSince childhood I have been fiercely independent and a free soul. Nothing has stopped me from following my heart and drawing my own life path. I was also very clear that falling in love or getting married will be no excuse to drift away from a value I truly believed in. However, staying indepedent in a relationship doesnt come easy. Its rare to find a partner who infact acknowledges the individual YOU and appreciates the differences. @itsmohitsehgal you never once asked me change. It is so effortless to be myself with you that sometimes its frustrating üôÑ. A love like ours is truly rare‚Ä¶is there anything as beautiful and rare as our love?‚Äù.\n\nCheck out the picture here:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BqZRgyGlAjK/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nBoth the stars bonded well on the sets of Miley Jab Hum Tum. They were often seen teasing each other. Later, their friendship blossomed into love and people got another adorable pair. Sanaya and Mohit supported each other during their tough times and proved that true love can overcome every problem. After dating for a few years, they finally got married.\n\nOn a related note, Sanaya is one of the most sought-after actresses of the small screen. She worked in shows like Rangrasiya and Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon. Mohit, on the other hand, was last seen in a TV show Love Ka Hai Intezaar."
