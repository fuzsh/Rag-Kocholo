        "text": "Sanaya Irani was popular as Khushi in the romantic drama Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon on Star Plus, which ended in November last year.\n\nShe will be back on the small screen with a new show, Chhanchhan, on Sony Entertainment Television.\n\nThe story is set in Ahmedabad. The serial explores how the bubbly Chhanchhan applies her intelligence, plays her cards well and sets the dysfunctional family that she marries into, back on track.\n\nThe cast includes Supriya Pathak, newcomer Farhan Khan, and Anang Desai. The serial begins on March 25 on Sony.\n\nSanaya Irani talks to Rajul Hegde about the new serial and her part in it.\n\nWhat is you character Chhanchhan like?\n\nChhanchhan is very much a today's person. She comes from a well educated and liberal family. She has morals and values but does not follow society's norm.\n\nShe isn't trying to change the world. It's just that she has views and is not a suppressed woman.\n\nIt's her journey, how she lands in the world of those people who live by society's norms, and it's for the audience to find out if she manages to change them.\n\nHow much can you identify with your character in Chhanchhan?\n\nI have a lot of similarities with Chhanchhan, as both of us have a chilled out family. I want to keep it real because this story is also very real, there is no over-dramatisation.\n\nI like dogs and so does Chhanchhan. In real life, I too am opinionated and don't follow society's norms. My parents have always taught me to be a good human being and nothing else matters.\n\nWhat was your reaction after you heard the name Chhanchhan?\n\nI like the name Chhanchhan because it's so catchy. Something else was also offered to me at the same time. My dad is a chilled out person and when I was discussing both the shows, he asked me the names of the shows. My Dad said, 'I like Chhanchhan. You must do this show.' Just by the name.\n\nAnd every morning when I wake up my dad is like \"Good morning Chhanchhan.\"\n\nIs this show loosely based on the film Khubsoorat?\n\nWhen Vipul sir (Vipul Shah, producer of the show) narrated the story, there was no brief given to me. I never had to do any research or look into any serial or film. It was very clear that he wanted me to play it with what I felt.\n\nAt no point did he say that this is taken from something else. For me, it's a new start. I don't watch Hindi serials and I have not watched Khubsoorat either.\n\nI don't know where this is coming from. I have to actually see it to know if the story is the same.\n\nAre you a dog lover? You are seen as a dog trainer, an unusual profession, in the show.\n\nI am fond of dogs as I have them at home. When I go home after the shoot, my dogs smell these dogs from the sets and they go crazy (smiles)\n\nYour boyfriend Mohit Sehgal had auditioned for the lead role in the show but he wasn't selected.\n\nIt was reported widely about him just because he is my boyfriend. There were 50 other people who auditioned for this show, out of which four were my friends, but nobody wrote about them.\n\nHowever, for him it was just another audition, hence there was no reaction when he did not get selected.\n\nHow is Farhan Khan as a co-star?\n\nIt's just been a day, but for a newcomer he surprised me. But, like every new person, I am sure he is scared and jittery. Nevertheless, he is doing a good job.\n\nMohit (her boyfriend) was a newcomer when I worked with him in Miley Jab Hum Tum. So, I have a hang of newcomers (laughs).\n\nWill you be giving him some acting tips?\n\nI hope I can give him a few tips and help ease him into the process. I know how it is when you are a newcomer. I have been through all that nervousness.\n\nHow is it working with Supriya Pathak?\n\nShe is very sweet, talented, and a pleasure to work with.\n\nI didn't know much about Supriyaji before I met her because I hardly watch Hindi serials. I watched a few episodes of Khichdi and her movie really made me laugh.\n\nSo how did you get into acting?\n\nI finished my B Com and I was studying for an MBA when I got into acting. I started off with ads, commercials, and got bored with that because there is not much you can do.\n\nI felt I should do something different. I found acting expressive and interesting. But I didn't know Hindi -- that was the big setback for me. I managed because it was one step at a time.\n\nEven now, when I read a script I can speak Hindi, but when I have to really talk, I speak English. I think in English and translate in Hindi. So I am a little slow when I have to speak in Hindi."
