        "text": "Sanaya Irani…drop her name and you will find legion of her fans going crazy. Yes, the Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon actress is all set to paint success again on small screen with her new show, Rangrasiya, which will air tonight at 9.30 pm on Colors, (Nautanki Telefilms).\n\nThe latest promo of the serial lends a pristine viewing experience. Sanaya and male lead Ashish Sharma look amazing together. Their chemistry would certainly scorch many a heart.\n\nTellychakkar.com spoke to Sanaya on her role in the serial and her expectations from the project. Said the petite actress: “Paro is a very real character, reserved, innocent and simple. Dressed up in complete Rajasthani attire with jewellery and stuff, she falls in love with her husband’s killer, but that’s the exciting part of it, so you need to watch it to experience. But I can assure that it’s a very complex character and not usually seen on TV.”\n\nIs it challenging to portray such a “unique” role, as you mention? “Oh yes, definitely. It’s very challenging. I was really stressed out to portray the role initially but thankfully I have people to guide me properly. I would like to mention that I was equally tensed while enacting Khushi in Iss Pyaar Ko. Anyways, I am confident that Rangrasiyawill do well and will be accepted by the masses. I would like to thank director Siddharth Sengupta for all the necessary guidance which helped me understand the pulse of the character.”\n\nTalking about the USP of the show, the actress added, “The story is the hero of the show. It is very intense and strong and it’s surely a must watch. I would not like to comment much, but it’s a very interesting and exciting concept. What attracted me to the project was the creative and passionate attitude of the entire production team. And most importantly Saurabh Tewari who is a marvelous producer and has a great vision. When I watched the first episode of Madhubala (Colors) I was blown away by its grandeur and had hoped to work with him someday.”\n\nHere it would be interesting to note that Sanaya and lead actress of Madhubala, Drashti Dhami are very good friends in real life as well. So will there be any competition between the two lovely ladies given the fact that they both are the faces of the channel? “There is no competition between us and I don’t understand why two people can’t just be happy and rock the space together. I think we both will do great for Colors.”\n\nAny words for your co star Ashish? “I think he is one of the most talented and under-rated actors in the industry. He is such a good actor and I am blessed to have him on the show. Having good co-actors can change the whole dynamics of your performance, and after Supriya ji in Chhanchhan I am learning a lot from Ashish.”"
