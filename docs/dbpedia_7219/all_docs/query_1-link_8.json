        "text": "Nosferatu, German silent horror film released in 1922, notable for being the earliest surviving film adaptation of Bram Stoker’s Dracula and for its technically novel and effective cinematography.\n\nNosferatu was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker’s classic vampire tale. Despite a few alterations here and there, including names and locations, the film adhered so closely to the novel that Stoker’s widow, Florence Stoker, sued the production company, Berlin-based Prana-Film GmbH, for copyright infringement two months after the film’s premiere in March 1922. Prana’s appeals were rejected, and the company fell into bankruptcy.\n\nIn July 1925 the courts ruled in Florence Stoker’s favor and ordered that all prints and negatives of Nosferatu be destroyed. The film might have been lost forever had a small number of prints not made their way abroad. Florence Stoker successfully halted Nosferatu’s London premiere in 1925 but not its American debut in 1929. See Can Copyright Infringement Kill a Vampire? for more on the legal battle over Nosferatu.\n\nDirected by German Expressionist filmmaker F.W. Murnau from a screenplay by Henrik Galeen, Nosferatu is known for its haunting vampire imagery, made possible in part by the state-of-the-art film tricks of cinematographers Fritz Arno Wagner and Günther Krampf, and for an eerie performance by Max Schreck as Count Orlok/Nosferatu. Schreck’s depiction of a blood-lusting vampire is a far cry from that of Bela Lugosi, who portrayed Dracula as a suave, tuxedoed aristocrat in the first authorized film adaptation, produced in 1931 by Universal Pictures. By contrast, Schreck’s vampire is feral and almost ratlike in appearance, with horrific fangs and long talons. The portrayal terrified filmgoers and established Nosferatu as one of the most memorable horror films of the silent era.\n\nPlot\n\nEstate agent Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) is ordered to Transylvania by his boss, Knock (Alexander Granach), to meet with the mysterious Count Orlok. According to a letter Knock has received from Orlok, the count wants to purchase a deserted house in the small German town of Wisborg, and Knock points to such a house very close to Hutter’s own. Knock’s reaction to the count’s letter implies that Knock is somehow under Orlok’s control. As Hutter sets off, he leaves his young wife, Ellen (Greta Schröder), in the care of his friends the ship owner Harding and his sister.\n\nWhile staying overnight at an inn as he travels to Orlok’s castle in the Carpathian Mountains, Hutter is confronted by signs that there is more to the count than he has been told. The locals refuse to mention his name, and animals in the area act strangely. A book in Hutter’s room offers insight into vampires, including the fact that they must sleep in coffins containing dirt from cemeteries holding plague victims.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Hutter dismisses as superstitious the villagers’ beliefs about vampires, and about Orlok specifically, until he accidentally cuts his thumb and Orlok reacts with disturbing delight at the sight of the blood.\n\nThe following evening, while working with Hutter, Orlok sees a photograph of Hutter’s wife, Ellen, and fixates on the beauty of her neck. That night, Hutter sees the man he has known as Orlok advancing menacingly on him. Meanwhile, back in Wisborg, Ellen cries out in warning during a bout of somnambulism. It is as Nosferatu that the man senses her cries and backs away. The next morning, Hutter visits the castle’s crypt and finds the man who had threatened him asleep in a coffin, confirming his suspicions that Orlok is one of the undead—Nosferatu.\n\nHutter later observes Nosferatu loading coffins onto a cart and leaving the castle. Hutter escapes and races home overland while the vampire’s coffins are loaded onto a ship that is also heading for Wisborg. Knock, now even more under Nosferatu’s control, goes insane and is placed in an institution.\n\nThe vampire’s voyage to Wisborg is horrific. Crewmen mysteriously sicken and die, and the captain is shown with puncture marks on his throat. A crewman descends into the hold and opens a coffin with a hatchet only to watch angry rats pour forth. In one of the film’s scariest scenes, Nosferatu rises ominously from one of the coffins, terrifying the crewman. When the ship arrives in port, all the crewmen are dead, and the hatch of the hold opens as if by magic. The vampire leaves the ship and, carrying one of his coffins, makes his way through town to the abandoned building near Hutter’s house. Meanwhile, Hutter arrives home and greets Ellen, who senses Nosferatu’s presence.\n\nThe ship’s log notes a plague threat, which terrorizes the town. People start dying in large numbers. Knock escapes the institution, but he is chased down and recaptured. Ellen learns that the only way to kill a vampire is for a virtuous woman to offer up her blood to the creature, keeping it occupied until the first rays of the morning sun kill it. (This scene introduced the now common trope that vampires are vulnerable to sunlight.) Ellen is successful in her plan, and Nosferatu dissolves in agony as the cleansing sun strikes him. Knock intuitively senses the vampire’s death and collapses. Ellen, arising and at first smiling as Hutter arrives, falls into her husband’s arms and perishes.\n\nLegacy\n\nNosferatu is in the public domain in most countries. Numerous versions of varying lengths and quality have been released over the years on DVD and Blu-ray. In 2013 Kino Lorber released a 94-minute restored version on DVD and rereleased it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2022 in celebration of the film’s 100th anniversary.\n\nNosferatu the Vampyre, a German-French production directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani, was released in 1979. It is a relatively faithful adaptation of Bram Stoker’s Dracula that incorporates elements of Murnau’s Nosferatu. Kinski, as Dracula, suffered for his art, spending four hours in the makeup chair every day for his transformation into the blood-driven count.\n\nShadow of the Vampire, directed by E. Elias Merhige, was released in 2000. It is a fictionalized account of the making of Nosferatu in 1922, with the amusing premise that Max Schreck was a real vampire, cast by F.W. Murnau for authenticity. John Malkovich played Murnau, and Willem Dafoe portrayed Schreck.\n\nA remake of Nosferatu, written and directed by Robert Eggers and starring Bill Skarsgård as Count Orlok/Nosferatu, was announced in 2015. Nicholas Hoult portrayed Thomas Hutter and Lily-Rose Depp played Ellen, replacing Anya Taylor-Joy, who had to bow out of the production because of a scheduling conflict. In May 2023 filming wrapped up, and the project entered postproduction. The film also features Willem Dafoe in his second Nosferatu-associated motion picture, although in a supporting role in this adaptation."
