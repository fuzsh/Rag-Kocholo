        "text": "Jaws\n\nThe classic film revolves around a local mayor’s struggle to keep his town open over the 4th of July holiday and support small businesses while a group of vigilantes, made up of a radical scientist and former big-city cop tries to shut down the 4th of July celebration over one shark.\n\n“Jaws” is available for rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV or stream on Peacock and Starz.\n\nArmageddon\n\nWhat is it about watching disaster films that feels so wonderfully relevant on the 4th of July? Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis play drillers who are sent to outer space to blow up a meteor big enough to annihilate the planet. Bonus points if you watch it with the commentary on.\n\n“Armageddon” is available to stream on Hulu, AMC+ and Roku.\n\nThe American President\n\nDirected by Rob Reiner, written by Aaron Sorkin and starring Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, and Michael J. Fox, this film is a precursor to the gorgeous monologues we would all soon become obsessed with over on “The West Wing” series. The premise is simple: a widower President (Douglas) falls in love with a lobbyist (Bening) during a (gasp) election year!\n\n“The American President” is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\nA League of Their Own\n\nNothing is more American than baseball. And when the boys went off during World War II, the women stepped up to revive America’s greatest pastime with the first-ever women’s baseball league! Starring Geena Davis, Tom Hanks (in arguably his best role ever as Jimmy Dugan), Rosie O’Donnell, and Madonna, the Penny Marshall-directed classic has all of the 40s hallmarks — swing dancing, war heroes and “Squiggy” from “Laverne & Shirley” as the stadium announcer.\n\n“A League of Their Own” is Available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\nCars\n\nThis 2006 Pixar movie is actually a meditation on the destruction of the American small town after the invention of interstate freeways. Set in the lost city of Radiator Springs, the lingering townsfolk, or town cars, have seemingly evaporated into the sands of time once the winding Route 66 was made irrelevant. It even has a song by sounds by Sheryl Crowe, a “Life is a Highway” cover by Rascal Flatts, and a song by James Taylor about the lost days of small towns called “Our Town.” What’s more American than that?\n\n“Cars” is available to stream on Disney+.\n\nHidden Figures\n\nThe best part of the 4th of July is using it as an excuse to mainline all the best space films, and “Hidden Figures,” about the real-life brilliant NASA scientists Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson is a must-binge. Without these ladies, there would be no space race! So pay your respects and enjoy this three-time Oscar-nominated picture.\n\n“Hidden Figures” is available to stream on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nChasing Liberty and First Daughter\n\nIn 2004 we would be bestowed not with one, but TWO President’s daughter romantic comedies. Played by two iconic queens of the aughts Mandy Moore in “Chasing Liberty” and Katie Holmes in “First Daughter.” Both has dream boat love interests (Matthew Goode and Marc Blucas respectively) and a total aversion to getting any kind of special treatment. A perfect film pairing for the 4th, watch them both.\n\n“Chasing Liberty” is available to rent on Amazon Prime and on Apple TV.\n\n“First Daughter” is available to rent on Apple TV.\n\nNational Treasure\n\nIt’s the movie that spawned the iconic line, “I’m going to steal the Declaration of Independence.” Uttered in all seriousness by the masterful actor Nicolas Cage, this wacky action adventure asks, what if elaborate treasure maps were hidden throughout all of our American history and literature?\n\n“National Treasure” is available to stream on Disney+.\n\nLincoln\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis’s take on President Abraham Lincoln is not to be missed, and neither is Sally Field’s as Mary Todd Lincoln. The 2012 film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards, including best picture and best director (Steven Spielberg), and it won best production design and best actor for Day-Lewis.\n\n“Lincoln” is available to stream on Paramount + and it’s also available for rent on Amazon Prime and on Apple TV.\n\nField of Dreams\n\nIf you build it, they will come. Celebrate the best of America by watching a farmer have a midlife crisis and bulldoze his yard to build a baseball field because… the voices in his head told him to! Kevin Costner, Gaby Hoffman, Ray Liotta and the iconic James Earl Jones star in a movie about dads and baseball. Come for the Midwest corn fields and ghosts, stay to watch a lovely doctor be punished for all eternity for saving a child’s life.\n\n“Field of Dreams” is available for rent on Amazon Prime and on Apple TV.\n\nCaptain America – The First Avenger\n\nThe 2011 Marvel movie told the origin story of Chris Evans’ Captain America, the very first Avenger. Come for the hero’s journey, stay to watch him punch countless Nazis right in the face, over and over and over.\n\n“Captain America” is available to stream on Disney+.\n\nDave\n\nThis BRILLIANT film centers around a small-time celebrity impersonator, Dave (played by Kevin Kline) who really only looks like one person, the President of the United States. But when the actual President falls ill, his staff brings in the loveable Dave to trick the American public and his wife (Sigourney Weaver) into thinking he’s still around. Directed by Ivan Reitman and penned by Gary Ross, do not sleep on “Dave,” if only for the amazing performance by Charles Grodin.\n\n“Dave” is available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\nAn American Tail\n\nThe Mousekewitz family crosses the ocean, leaving behind their homeland to find a new start in 1886 America. During their treacherous immigration, the youngest member of the mouse family, Fievel, is separated from the rest of his family and must find them on the unfamiliar streets of New York City.\n\n“An American Tail” is available to stream on Starz and available to rent on Amazon Prime and Apple TV.\n\nIndependence Day\n\nHow could this one not be on the list? Aliens attack, blowing up the White House in the process, and the response is for the country to band together to kick some alien ass. Highlights include every scene Will Smith is in and perhaps the greatest motivational speech ever, delivered by President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman).\n\n“Independence Day” is available to stream on Hulu.\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington\n\n“Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” is one of the greatest underdog stories in film. After Jefferson Smith is selected to replace a senator, he heads to Washington to find it a corrupt mess. In order to beat the corruption, he launches a physically and mentally taxing filibuster.\n\n“Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” is available to stream on Prime Video.\n\nApollo 13\n\nAfter suffering internal damage on their way to a moon landing, astronauts Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks), Jack Swigert (Kevin Bacon) and Fred Haise (Ken Watanabe) struggle to find a way to get safely back to Earth. The film is human ingenuity and perseverance at its best.\n\n“Apollo 13” is available to rent on Amazon Prime and on Apple TV.\n\nAir Force One\n\nWhile not the only take-charge president on the list, Harrison Ford’s President James Marshall may be the most badass. When hijackers take control of Air Force One Marshall, an ex-soldier, takes it upon himself to fight back.\n\n“Air Force One” is available to stream on AMC+.\n\nTop Gun/Top Gun: Maverick\n\nWatch the journey of Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer’s Maverick and Iceman, some of the most iconic characters in film, thanks to this movie about fighter pilots competing against one another to be the best in the 1986 “Top Gun.” Cruise returns to the franchise years later to take on a special assignment and train the latest batch of new pilots in the 2022 flick “Top Gun: Maverick.”\n\n“Top Gun” and “Top Gun: Maverick” are both available to stream on Paramount +.\n\nRocky IV\n\nFor all the American vs. Russia stories that were rampant in the mid-80s, “Rocky IV” may very well be the best. After Ivan Drago kills Apollo Creed in a match, Rocky travels to Russia for a revenge match.\n\n“Rocky IV” is available to stream on Amazon Prime.\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nOpening with a harrowing depiction of D-Day and keeping the gas pedal to the floor for the remainder of the film, this Steven Spielberg-directed, Tom Hanks-starring movie about a group trying to save the last of four brothers is the pinnacle of what war films can be.\n\n“Saving Private Ryan” is available to stream on Paramount+, Peacock and Amazon Prime."
