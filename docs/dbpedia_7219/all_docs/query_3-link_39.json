It follows the stories of 5 archetypal Hollywood as their lives crash through American history and American film styles.",

        "text": "The Story\n\n​\n\nThe play reflects the changes in American self-image from the early 1930s up through the 1970s. (Note: Durang did an updating of the ending for a Juilliard production in 1995, which takes the material more or less up to the late 90s. This rewrite is only published in the Smith and Kraus book Christopher Durang – Complete Full Length Plays, 1975-1995.)\n\n​\n\nLoretta starts out as a pathetic orphan girl in the opening silent section of the play (acted with titles and piano underscoring). She then finds herself in the Depression, where tough guy Jimmy takes her under his wing and they fall in love. (Song: Shanty Town Romance)\n\n​\n\nHowever, Jimmy’s gun moll girlfriend Bette shows up, and isn’t too pleased to meet Loretta. Jimmy deserts Loretta, and she tracks him down to a sleazy speakeasy where she explains what she wants out of life by reciting the Production Code (all evil doers must be punished; there must be no themes of incest or white slavery; a bed scene must always have at least one foot on the floor).\n\n​\n\nJimmy, though, is killed by gangsters; and Loretta is nightmarishly mistaken for his killer, and is sentenced to a chain gang.\n\n​\n\nLoretta and sweet Hank (like Henry Fonda in The Grapes of Wrath) escape the chain gang, and are picked up by a wealthy family from a screwball comedy who are on a scavenger hunt. So the tone of depression and gangster are gone, and now Loretta is in a nutty comedy with heiresses and people acting silly, and she doesn’t like it one bit. (“I hate screwball comedies!” she screams.) Then Jimmy shows up – he’s alive after all (“they just nicked me”) and now he’s married to Bette, who’s become like Jean Harlow.\n\n​\n\nAs the play goes on, Jimmy dies several times, but keeps coming back to life. And Loretta goes to Hollywood and joins a Busby Berkeley musical (song: We’re in a Salad), but breaks a leg. Then World War II happens and everyone gets noble, and goes off to Casablanca for a while. Then there’s the first atom bomb; and in the postwar period, Jimmy and Loretta become troubled - he becomes a motorcycle punk (like Marlon Brando), she becomes an alcoholic (like Susan Hayward in I’ll Cry Tomorrow), and they keep struggling and struggling to find the happiness they used to have back in Shanty Town.\n\n​\n\nThe play ends with all the characters watching The Ten Commandments in a movie theatre, while their identities keep changing as they try to figure out who they are or want to be, until the disaster films of the 70s cause the movie theatre to fall apart due to an earthquake. And Loretta, Jimmy, Hank, Bette and Eve crawl out of the rubble, and sing a song about planning how to rebuild for the future.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nThe plot description may sound torturous; and it does help if you know movies (or watch Turner Classic Movies). But the tone of the play is lighthearted, and usually is successful with audiences.\n\n​\n\nDurang rewrote the final scene with some updates.
