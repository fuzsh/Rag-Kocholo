        "text": "In a recent New York Times op-ed, Ross Douthat wrote how the decline of the Academy Awards is a reflection of the decline of the American film industry. The article is titled, We aren't Just Watching the Decline of the Oscars. We're Watching the End of the Movies. I couldn't agree more, although for a variety of other reasons. A lot of Douthat’s argument is based on the idea that the film industry peaked in the 1990s, that the quality of films being made today lack relatability in terms of their stories and characters, and lack invention and authorship from ‘auteurs’. While I agree that the 90s was a great decade for film (and may have peaked in certain aspects), it is my opinion that there are a lot of fantastic films being made today, but they are not being discovered. This gross lack of discovery is perpetuated by a system that is designed to keep people out. Although some of Hollywood’s failures have to do with the kinds of films they’re releasing, whether or not the industry deserves to die shouldn’t be determined by this alone, but by whether it is an honest participant in making our society a better and more equitable place—an inclusive place. From this standpoint, I take the position that the American film industry deserves a 21st century death, in order to be resurrected as an equitable and inclusive institution.\n\nI fell in love with storytelling at an early age—earlier than I remember. I still retain a 1st grade report card, from Ms. Amel at Saccarappa Elementary School, which says: \"Eric won't go out and play during recess, but stays inside and writes stories.\" That’s right, I retain official government documentation that I have been a storyteller, at the very least, since first-grade. My interest in cinema came about in the 2nd grade when Tim Burton's Batman was released, followed shortly thereafter by the very first live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. These movies blew my mind. I didn't understand how they operated. I didn't understand how they moved the turtles from the cartoon into the 'real world'. I didn't understand why Batman wasn't blue anymore, and why it was so much better that he wasn't! I was all in on the enchantment, and the journey of discovering how the magic worked. As I grew up, I took a liking to all the typical pop-culture cinema products of the 90s, and for the first time in middle school, I was looking at films with an aesthetic eye. When Jurassic Park came out on VHS, I asked for the ‘Making Of’ documentary instead of the actual movie (a request that my parents denied).\n\nIn the 7th grade, when my parents started home-schooling me because of severe bullying (from both students and faculty), my dad was the first to actually get through to me when it came to teaching math. I had always struggled with math. I didn’t understand how it operated, and no one back then knew how to explain why the operations worked. But he figured it out. He asked what I wanted to do for a living, and the first thing that slipped out of my mouth was, \"I want to make movies.\" There was no reason in the world why his son would want to make movies. We lived on an island off the coast of Maine with two industries: construction and fishing. We had no connections to any major cities and therefore absolutely no connections to entertainment, art, or media. He went with it though, and he broke it down for me: first by explaining how motion-picture film worked, then by asking how many feet of film I would need for a two-hour movie with a frame rate of 24 frames per second. That blew my mind! When everyone else was learning math by counting money, I was counting film footage (literally).\n\nIn high school, I was a troubled youth up until I started making films. I was breaking into houses, vandalizing private property, and lighting wild fires. But then I figured out how to get access to camera and editing equipment, and this changed everything. Making films saved me. First they were short films, experimental, and silly videos (the kind of videos kids still make today with their cellphones). I produced all my work using SVHS camcorders supplied by the local vocational school, and would edit either tape-to-tape or with an antique Media 100 editing program. Using this technology, I made my first feature my senior year, volunteering a variety of local people and local celebrities. I wrote my first three feature-length screenplays that same year. This was school year 1999-2000 in Portland, Maine, and it was a great time to get into filmmaking. Some of the best movies had been made and discovered, including some of my favorite indie films like Rhythm Thief, Clerks, Living in Oblivion, and many more that weren’t discovered but somehow managed to find me. Rolled into this, we were also learning how filmmakers were starting to use the internet to interact with audiences. Kevin Smith had his WWWBoard, and LucasFilm, after releasing the Episode I teaser (via a slow-loading QuickTime movie), crashed our school's network for a morning. It was a great time to be a film student.\n\n20 years later, it is not a great time to be in film, and it’s a worse time for anyone trying to break into film. In fact, ever since making my first films post-film school, I've been trying to find ingress into the film industry—for twenty years. Every film I’ve ever made, screened, and distributed has been a cobbled-together endeavor, financed from the pennies left over from basic expenses. Because of this, I do not go on vacations, I do not go to concerts, and I do not engage in social events that costs money. I’ve always been on my own with nearly every aspect of these projects, and because of this, my whole system of filmmaking has evolved to include only me and the actors I can get on board. I don’t even have a crew, because I cannot afford them. I am a filmmaker, but I am not in the film industry (not for lack of trying). All the projects I produce are the ones I can produce on my own, but they’re not the ones I would produce if given resources. I know my story is not the only one either. Every filmmaker worth their salt has the same story: they make the films they can make right now, and hold onto the ones that require more money.\n\nI’ve tried every angle I can think of to get my foot into the door. Time and time again, I run into nepotism shielded behind arbitrary qualification requirements. I know how to make movies. I know how to create online content. I publish books, write articles, and can turn out a fully-polished feature-length screenplay from concept to completion in 2-3 weeks. I know all the backend duties, the financing, the logistics… I am the most productive and knowledgeable person I know, yet I cannot get anyone to talk to me. The problem has always been that I didn’t arrive on third base. In New York and Los Angeles, this has been the problem for twenty straight years. No other industry in the world treats people the way the film industry treats unestablished talent, or more accurately: mis-treats. Why is it such a bad thing to want to create art for a living?\n\nMost filmmakers from my generation were never given a proper chance to make a fully-financed movie, despite having calling-card films that demonstrated our capabilities. I’ve seen short and feature films that surpass the calling cards of older, established filmmakers; yet so many millennial filmmakers have all but given up and moved back to their hometowns, disenchanted by the Hollywood island… that rock in the middle of nowhere seemingly designed to keep outsiders away. Again, it is not because they were bad filmmakers, but because they weren’t born into it.\n\nFilm festivals are no longer places to be discovered. The last two feature films I made weren’t accepted into any. I know what you’re thinking: is it a bad film? That’s the elephant in the room whenever I tell this to people. But look at it this way: my rejection letter from Sundance indicated that the they’d received over 15,000 submissions in the year I submitted my latest film, FRACTALS. There is no way any festival can realistically program 15,000 films. It stands to reason that most rejections are not because the films are inferior, but more likely they never get watched at all (at least not in their entireties, and certainly not by people with authority to accept submissions for programming). A lot of talent is being thrown under the bus by a system that cannot handle the number of qualified, talented people trying to break in. If you’re asking yourself why film festivals bother taking submissions when they can’t possibly watch 15,000 movies, remember that there are submission fees, and filmmakers pay out of pocket to meet these fee demands. Just multiply $35 by 15,000.\n\nWhen I first moved to New York, I tried getting a job at every production house, studio, and television company I could find. I remember walking into the employee entrance of the Ed Sullivan Theatre, and asking a staffer how I could get work on the David Letterman show. I loved watching Letterman, and thought his show was so creative. The staffer laughed and said that unless I knew someone, or was someone’s cousin, I wasn’t getting in. I even wrote to Harvey Weinstein (this was in autumn of 2003) and some assistant wrote back berating me on why I shouldn’t cold-write an executive. I remember talking on the phone with someone who ran an equipment rental facility here in New York, and as soon as he found out that I am an active indie filmmaker, he quickly shut down the interview. He told me that he didn’t want filmmakers working in his business (a business that rented film equipment to film productions). It's like we're living in some Terry Gilliam universe rooted in ineffective and inefficient absurdity.\n\nThis is not an industry structured around inviting new talent. Hollywood is an island, and the mission of that island is to keep the money in the family. Thus, production companies hire their sons, daughters, nieces and nephews. Occasionally you’ll find filmmakers getting pulled out of the woodwork to fit the current zeitgeist, but if one looks deeper into who these filmmakers are, you’ll see they’ve been connected with the industry much longer than their “stories of being discovered” let on.\n\nLike thousands of other perfectly qualified and talented individuals, I want to make movies that people will relate to, rooted in my own experiences. But Hollywood doesn’t believe in these projects because they don’t know me, and they don’t want to know me. In fact, the simple act of introducing myself to any number of studio executives is looked down on as an “amateur move”. How are outsiders supposed to meet people if they are expected to keep their distance because, “That’s just how it is”? It is a system of keyholders, none of which are the least bit interested in opening the door for newcomers. Storytelling is an act of empathy, but Hollywood isn’t empathetic.\n\nLeadership is completely detached from the act of filmmaking. The people greenlighting projects don’t actually know how to make movies (even though many seem to think they do). In any industrial sector, this is wholly inappropriate. Look at it from a food-service perspective: a restaurant-owner should know how to run every aspect of their business: front of the house, back of the house, and the administrative functions like dealing with Sysco, or state health inspectors etc. This logic should apply to every industry, and to a certain extent it does: except in film. Film studio executives are a mishmash of unqualified people who have no idea what the person next to them does, and as a result all the different aspects of the craft are highly compartmentalized. Thus, no one in their totality can make a good movie. Added to this, the leadership is detached, both spiritually and economically from audiences, so they’re unaware of what inspires audiences to dump their hard-earned cash on opening weekends. They resort to IP because it’s easier than crossing your fingers and hoping you have a sleeper with your next talkie. They want an easy formula for it: get A celeb, pair him/her with B working actor, and open with a bang, close with a hug, and roll it into some pre-existing IP. If it’s not set on the east coast, reference New York at least once. There’s your movie. The problem is that this is an unsustainable business model perpetuated by people who have no idea what they’re doing, and no stake in whether the film industry sinks or swims. They’re usually people who can take their talents to more stable industries, if it ever comes down to it.\n\nThe filmmakers actually getting their films greenlit are a whole other aspect of the problem. For them, life is a constant hustle of financing their next film project, and the one after that. After completing and releasing a film, they live in fear that they won’t get another film made, so every move they make is always about themselves. No established filmmaker wants to collaborate with anyone they don’t already know, or isn’t a sure thing, so they don’t back any newcomers or partner with anyone that isn’t this year’s “it-talent”. It is a fear-driven mode of operation that perpetuates selfish behavior, in which no up-and-coming talent is nurtured or mentored.\n\nRecently, I interviewed with a film studio in Manhattan. They were looking for a Creative Content Producer, someone who could do everything that I do: make films (short and feature), produce client-facing video content (mission videos, instructional, ads etc.), produce social content (video and writing), and oversee the launch of their podcast division (I have a growing podcast, with a growing audience, have made 20+ films, and produced client video content for many years – in terms of what I have done and can do, I am qualified). Within five minutes, the person interviewing me stopped me mid-sentence to say that I wasn’t ‘The Guy’, and that he didn’t want to waste his time. He hung up on me. If my resume qualifies me enough to get an interview, but getting to know me via Zoom is enough to disqualify me after five minutes (and ultimately get hung-up on), then there is something more than the qualifications they say they want. It’s absolutely personal, but shouldn’t be. This experience is a great example of what is wrong with the industry, and the leadership running things. I know other filmmakers who have had similar experiences with companies in New York and Los Angeles, not just production companies, but agencies too.\n\nThis behavior isn't just towards those looking for work, but for those also looking to hire talent. Back in 2013, a talent agent told me to lose his number because I couldn't afford the $10k per day that his client required to commit to a film I was making (his client isn't even an A-list actor, but was only notable because he was on a science-fiction show in the 90s). To tell anyone to lose their number is an abysmal failure of civility. Disrespectful behavior is rampant in Hollywood. It’s a disease rooted in a system that has let leadership get away with mis-treating anyone who wants to ‘Make It’. It’s not that I am always looking to ‘Make It’; ultimately I'm just trying to surround myself with people who understand what I want to do, and can work with me to achieve these goals.\n\nSo, what is Making It, and why is it bad for the industry? It is a fictional interpretation of someone’s rise to success, designed and perpetuated by PR firms, marketing agencies, and talent reps that all benefit from this constant lie. But really, it’s a desperate drive to get to an economic level that is virtually inaccessible by today’s impossible standards (especially if you’re an outsider). The damaging aspect of this lie is in the desperation it instills on unestablished talent, as a lot of today’s Hollywood leadership use this desperation to mistreat hundreds, if not thousands of potential talents. I have been thinking about the concept of Making It for so long, that my latest feature film, FRACTALS, is largely about this – it’s about how dangerous the concept of ‘Making It’ is to American men and women. Making It is a concept that needs to go extinct if we're going to bring the film industry down-to-earth.\n\nAll that I have discussed here is a product of the structure of the industry, and the biases of the individuals in leadership positions, and how that affects the quality of the content they turn out. This structure, and these leaders, need to go the way of the dodo if the American film industry stands a chance at surviving. This brings us to the Academy Awards, an industry organization that gives awards to itself, but for some reason outsiders think it’s something other than that. It’s not. It’s actually quite ridiculous. Have you ever noticed that the Academy doesn’t choose films from specific genres to win awards? How many comedies have been nominated for Best Picture? How many won? Was Titanic really the best picture of 1998? What about this year? Of all the films that were released in 2021, are the ten Best Picture nominees really the best that could have nominated, or were they just the ten that academy members ended up watching? Do academy members hate Spiderman? Why? He seems like such a nice guy.\n\nLet’s look at the aspects of the award show the academy has chosen to broadcast. All the craft categories have been completely omitted from the broadcast. Anyone who isn't on a movie poster isn't welcomed to participate in the show (and even some of them didn’t get invites). Screenwriter and filmmaker Marc Bernardin said it best on the Fatman Beyond Podcast: If you're going to have an award show for an industry, then have it for the industry. The glamour factory component should not have dominance over the craft sections. The fact that it does, is a symptom of the industry’s inevitable demise. Like Making It, Glamour is another fiction that American culture can no longer afford, as it is incredibly destructive. This aspect of the film industry has to end. All it does is create an aristocracy in a country where aristrocracy shouldn’t exist. Additionally, it doesn’t help the industry as a whole, and it doesn't make better content or generate bigger audiences. Most people just resent it. It is a self-serving subset of a dying industry, which no sane person living in the real-world cares about (and don’t get me started on the Met Gala).\n\nThe decline of the Oscars isn't just a reflection of how cinema is turning out stories people can no longer relate to, but it's also a reflection of the deeper economic divides in the country. With gas prices where they're at, two generations of adults unable to buy homes, and a looming nuclear war, the last thing anyone needs to see are wealthy Californians showing off their out-of-touch levels of wealth. This isn't a jealous rage, it's a fact. The Oscars are a wholly inappropriate event, designed to remind Americans just where they stand in this backwards, corrupted, and broken economic system.\n\nNow that I’ve said what no one wants to hear, it’s time we confront the inevitable and speed-up Hollywood’s demise, if for no other reason than to rebuild it. The American Film Industry needs to die in order to save the medium; it needs a rebirth guided by well-meaning, down-to-earth people who haven’t forgotten how to treat one-another. How do we do this?\n\n1. Let the industry die.\n\n2. Stop caring about A-list celebrities and whatever I.P. they’re hopping onto.\n\n3. Stop paying attention to their self-aggrandizing awards shows that have no bearing on whether or not you sink or swim in your own lives.\n\n4. Treat your own filmmaking dreams like an entrepreneurial endeavor, and find a way to get your films made outside of the Hollywood system. All of us making films off the shores of their walled-in island should keep plugging away at it. Their island is sinking, but it doesn’t mean we have to. Keep making films, keep honing your craft. Invent ways to get your films seen and appreciated by audiences.\n\n5. Don’t try to rescue Hollywood! Once the island has sank, leave ‘em to the fishes! We’ll be in command of the only ship at sea, and it’ll be up to us to navigate that ship into a more equitable future.\n\nAll my films have been produced outside of the film industry, without an appropriate crew, and dare I say... without the guarantee of a paycheck. They've been entrepreneurial endeavors to a large extent, totally risky, but also a practice that was fulfilling a personal need: I have genuine stories to tell that Hollywood doesn't want told. My stories tackle the problems of the arts, arts funding, and this wholly inappropriate set-up for professional art creation. My stories confront the dysfunction of an industry that so many of us dream about. These weren’t the stories I initially set out to make, but they became a necessity. Making these films became a calling. I often think of myself, not as Hollywood, but as Main Street Filmmaking, and I urge others to do so as well.\n\n--\n\nEric Norcross is a writer, filmmaker, and podcaster.
