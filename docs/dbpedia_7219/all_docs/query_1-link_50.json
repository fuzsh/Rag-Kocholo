        "text": "**Contains spoilers**\n\nI have been treating myself over the last week to re-reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which I last consumed when I was about sixteen. I realise, thirty years on, that not all of the stories in the collection are classics, and oddly I have enjoyed more the ones that I had forgotten about, like The Blue Carbuncle and the very silly The Engineer’s Thumb. Both of them are slight, but never take themselves seriously.\n\nAnyway, being in a Holmes mood, I thought it would be a good time to finally watch the 1922 Sherlock Holmes starring John Barrymore – and with early appearances by William Powell and Louis Wolheim, among others. The film was lost for a number of decades, only to be found literally in pieces in the early 1970s – not only were the sequences out of order, but multiple takes of each scene were also found. This was then painstakingly restored over the years, and a restoration of that restoration found it’s way on to DVD in the early 2000s. And a further restoration of that is now on blu ray. I have seen the DVD, which looks reasonably decent given the history of the film, although the screencaps online of the blu ray look decidedly better.\n\nIt is very much a case of a lost film being found and turning out to be a very ordinary film. Hype generally gets built up about the famous lost films – most notably London After Midnight – and they are rather inevitably not as good as the myth would lead us to believe. My understanding is that the same can be said of the William Gillette Holmes film, which was found a few years back, but I have yet to see that. John Barrymore stars in the 1922 film, which is likely to have purists running for the hills. It starts off with Holmes and Watson at university, where they first encounter Moriarty, and ends (wait for it) with Holmes getting married – well, I guess that romantic lead John Barrymore could never be left single at the end of a film.\n\nNone of this would be quite so bad if it was exciting, intriguing, mildly interesting, or if the plot even made sense. None of this is the case. In fact, it’s a remarkably dull film, not helped by the overuse of intertitles – look away for just one and you’ll be completely lost (you might get lost anyway!) – and a rather vapid performance by Barrymore. Barrymore does at least look like Holmes, but he doesn’t act like him. In fact, he doesn’t seem to act at all. He just meanders along, looking stern and as thinkers are meant to look like when they think. Meanwhile, Watson is barely seen after the university prologue (which lasts half an hour!). This is something of a shame as he looks as if he would have made a rather good Watson. And, to add insult to injury, we have Carol Dempster as the female lead – and she is as convincing as she is in all her roles (ie. not convincing at all).\n\nAt the time of release, Variety, were not exactly complimentary either, stating that “while it seems to be one of those specials certain to make money because of the combination of names in it, there isn’t much from a picture standpoint to recommend it. The story is badly handled, the continuity leaping along by fits and starts.” Anyone knowing the story of the restoration process might be forgiven for thinking that the continuation issues would have been caused by missing footage – but Variety confirms they were present from the start, which is a little bemusing.\n\nI would recommend getting your fix of silent Holmes elsewhere. Flicker Alley released two silent versions of The Hound of the Baskervilles (1914 and 1929) a couple of years ago, and both are considerably better films than this, even if they are lacking the starry cast. The 1929 is relatively faithful to the book, and the 1914 is a very bizarre loose adaptation, but both are at least engaging and entertaining. Also much better are the Eille Norwood films – some of which have been issued by Grapevine Video, and the feature-length The Sign of Four is available on YouTube, and well worth a look."
