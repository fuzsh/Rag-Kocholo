        "text": "65 Free Charlie Chaplin Films Online\n\n\"A few things to know about Charlie Chaplin. He starred in over 80 films, reeling off most during the silent film era. In 1914 alone, he acted in 40 films, then another 15 in 1915. By the 1920s, Chaplin had emerged as the first larger-than-life movie star and director, if not the most recognizable person in the world.\"\n\nThe Blues, Black Vaudeville, and the Silver Screen, 1912-1930s\n\n\"The online collection consists of selected correspondence, financial records, contracts, and advertising materials from the Douglass Theatre's records in the Middle Georgia Archives' Charles Henry Douglass business records, and it documents the amusements available to Macon's African American population and the business dealings of this African American entrepreneur from 1912 to the 1930s. The bulk of these selected records feature the period between 1920 and 1929, and describe the sporting events, vaudeville, and films brought to the theater, as well as the efforts to ensure its financial success.\"\n\nBroadcasting Collections (Georgia State University)\n\n\"This digital collection includes materials from the radio broadcasting collections within the Popular Music and Culture Collection. Items include selected photographs from the WSB Radio Records and documents from the Georgia Radio Hall of Fame Collection – including issues of the Southern Music Survey from 1963 to 1966.\n\nCopyrights to the items in this collection are held by various entities. Rights information, if known, is specified in the item’s description.\"\n\nKissing Rudy Valentino\n\n\"Fears about the impact of movies on youth led to the Payne Fund research project, which brought together nineteen social scientists and resulted in eleven published reports. One of the most fascinating of the studies was carried out by Herbert Blumer, a young sociologist who would later go on to a distinguished career in the field. For a volume that he called Movies and Conduct (1933), Blumer asked more than fifteen hundred college and high school students to write “autobiographies”of their experiences going to the movies. In this motion picture autobiography, a high school “girl” talked about what the movies of the 1920s meant to her.\" History Matters - GMU\n\nMovie Dreams and Movie Injustices\n\n\"Fears about the impact of movies on youth led to the Payne Fund research project, which brought together nineteen social scientists and resulted in eleven published reports. One of the most fascinating of the studies was carried out by Herbert Blumer, a young sociologist who would later go on to a distinguished career in the field. For a volume that he called Movies and Conduct (1933), Blumer asked more than fifteen hundred college and high school students to write “autobiographies”of their experiences going to the movies. This seventeen-year-old African American used his motion picture autobiography to describe how films not only led to dreams of fast cars but also made him \"feel the injustice done the Negro race.\" \"\n\nPhotoplay (links to online issues via The Online Books Page)\n\nPhotoplay began publishing in 1911. It sometimes shifted titles for a time to include titles of publications it merged with, like Movie Mirror and TV-Radio Mirror. The first actively copyright-renewed issue is January 1944 (v. 24 no. 2). The first actively copyright-renewed contribution is from June 1925.\n\nFilm Scripts Online This link opens in a new window\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nThis link opens in a new window\n\nBrowse Scripts and use the Specialized Area of Interest link on the left to limit to the 1920s\n\nContains over 1,100 scripts and makes available, for the first time, accurate and authorized versions of copyrighted screenplays."
