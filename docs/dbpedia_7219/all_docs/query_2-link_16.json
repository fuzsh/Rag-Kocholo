        "text": "Laborer’s Love is currently the earliest-known surviving complete Chinese-made film. A carpenter-turned-fruit seller courts a doctor’s daughter, but her father tells him that he’ll only marry his daughter to the man who can bring him more patients. Watch how Carpenter Zheng uses the tools of his trade to get the girl! The film contains original bilingual Chinese-English intertitles. In this copy, the Chinese text has been translated only in instances where the meaning of the Chinese words and the English words is significantly different.\n\nThis module corresponds to chapter 1 of the book Chinese Film Classics, 1922-1949.\n\nThe film:\n\nLaogong zhi aiqing\n\nAlternative title: Zhi guo yuan 擲菓緣 (A Marriage Made by Flinging Fruit)\n\nAlternative English titles: A Marriage Made by Flinging Fruit, Romance of a Fruit Peddler\n\nDirector: Zhang Shichuan\n\nScreenwriter: Zheng Zhengqiu\n\nStudio: Mingxing\n\nYear of release: 1922\n\nCast: Cheng Cheh Ku (Zheng Zhegu), Yu Ying, Zheng Zhengqiu (credited as Cheng Kung [“Mr. Zheng”], T.M.

Watch these examples:\n\nThe Haunted House, staircase sequence 1:\n\nThe Haunted House, staircase sequence 2:\n\nThe Haunted House, staircase sequence 3:\n\nBuster Keaton’s The Electric House (1921), made just one year before Laborer’s Love also showcases a funny staircase. Things start to go wacky around minute 5:\n\nA trick staircase reminiscent of The Haunted House also appears in a 1929 Chinese silent film, the action-comedy Woman Warrior White Rose.\n\nWatch how how a staircase is used for bedlam comedy in Wanderings of Three-Hairs the Orphan (1949), around 1 hour 4 minutes:\n\nFor a detailed discussion of connections between vaudeville cinema in China and Hollywood (including Laborer’s Love), watch this conversation between Christopher Rea and Henry Jenkins:\n\nand read a transcript of the conversation (with images), “The Ancient Art of Falling Down: Vaudeville Cinema Between Hollywood and China,” here.\n\nRelated Posts"
