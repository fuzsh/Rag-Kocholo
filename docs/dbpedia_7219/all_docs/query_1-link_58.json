Her earliest appearances were in Vitagraph shorts, eventually graduating to leading roles for Universal, including \"A Little Brother of the Rich\" (1915) and \"A Nine O'Clock Town\" (1918). She was best known for her performances in Western films, especially ones in which she appeared alongside director-actor William S. Hart. Her career faltered with the advent of sound film, forcing her to take small, often uncredited, roles in films until her retirement in 1954. 10 x 8 inches. Very Good, with a few small closed tears to the top edge. - Thelma (Original photograph of Jane Novak for the 1922 film)",
