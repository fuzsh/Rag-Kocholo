        "text": "\"Sir,\" a correspondent wrote in 1925, \"I have been a subscriber to The London Mercury now for three years, but never in that time have I seen any article in its pages on the Film. This is to me the more surprising as I have been frequently regaled with such topics as Anthropology, Swine-Husbandry and the like.\" The genteel literary monthly had realised the omission itself, and carried its first film column in the same November issue, written by the assistant editor Milton Waldman. Robert Herring, a poet, reviewer, and enthusiast for the art of cinema, took over responsibility in 1926, roaming widely over the available field with discernment and wit.\n\nThe London Mercury was joining a range of publications in the early 1920s that offered film commentary predicated on the assumptions that cinema was not only entertainment but could - should - be an art, and that readers should be helped toward understanding its riches. From 1922 to 1927 film coverage in the London Evening Standard was in the hands of Walter Mycroft. A new convert to cinema at the start, he quickly championed the visual artistry of German films: Fritz Lang and Ernst Lubitsch especially. Mycroft built his column inches into an influential platform, and found himself sometimes at odds with the newspaper's proprietor, Edward Hulton, who had a financial stake in the American distribution company Film Booking Offices. Like most critics of the time who applied serious thought to the job, Mycroft enthused over the visual comedy and spectacle in Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks; lesser American films he lambasted for their frivolity, vulgarity, and \"false outlook on life\".\n\nThe Times, still beating the drum for Britain, also took sharp aim at American product in editorials and reviews, and, most extensively, a series of articles in 1925 by the poet Robert Nichols. Restless and curious, Nichols went to Hollywood to scour the scene, reporter's notebook in hand. \"We're no dumber than the public we serve,\" he reported one Hollywood 'specimen' telling him; \"Get clever and you lose money.\" Nichols saw financial sense in that, though not artistic well-being: he declared reaping profits from the 'hicks' to be the biggest hurdle to the movies' improvement. As an example he supplied a horror story for all lovers of cinema as art. To suit the 'hicks', Murnau's intertitle-free Der Letzte Mann (The Last Laugh, Germany, 1924) had been re-edited, spliced with over 50 titles, and given a happy ending; \"And still it failed,\" he wrote sadly.\n\nC.A. Lejeune was another significant newcomer. In 1921, family contacts, a particular enthusiasm for Fairbanks, and a pretentious article entitled 'The Undiscovered Aesthetic' paved the way to the Manchester Guardian, launching a career in print that lasted until 1960. In discursive, lengthy but fleet-footed paragraphs, Lejeune championed Swedish, German and French imports. At the same time, more unusually, she trumpeted her emotional engagement with Hollywood's mass-audience films, from the melodrama Stella Dallas (1926) to the action and landscapes of The Iron Horse (1926). Lejeune's sphere of influence grew considerably once she moved to The Observer in 1928; though patronising wit came to dilute her force, she was held in respect in these early years as a critic who cared. \"The weekly column in The Observer,\" wrote the young enthusiast Raymond Spottiswoode in A Grammar of the Film (1935), \"first led me to realise that the cinema had independent powers.\"\n\nThe most dominant, widely read critic of the 1920s, though, was Iris Barry (pictured above right). Pert, intelligent and Ãƒ la mode, she was quickly taken up by the artistic elite on arrival in London. Ezra Pound was her first mentor; Wyndham Lewis swept her into a passionate affair. In 1924 she began to write film columns in The Spectator and the fashion magazine Vogue, though her fame stemmed more from the punchier, populist writing provided for the Daily Mail, Britain's best-selling newspaper, where she reigned as film critic from 1925 to 1930. Like Lejeune, she found pleasure in a wide range of English-language cinema, from American Westerns to cartoons and travel films, though she had a harder time being upbeat about things British. She also wrote spiritedly about continental imports, with the exception of the French avant-garde. In 1926 she published a vivacious book, Let's Go to the Pictures, typical in its enthusiastic embrace of both intellectual ambition and the importance of spectator pleasure. \"Going to the pictures,\" she wrote, \"is nothing to be ashamed of\", aiming her thoughts not at the intellectuals but at the thoughtful middle classes who were increasingly attending cinemas. In its pages she brushed against 'highbrow' film vocabulary, writing knowledgably of 'tone value' and 'related time and space rhythms', but kept returning to chit-chat and personalities - directors, stars, producers - to keep the general reader in tow. Like Mycroft, Barry's eclectic preferences sometimes jarred with those of her proprietor. Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail, urged protectionist policies to fight against American dominance and boost British film production; one editorial of 1926 bore the title 'The Foreign Film and the English Soul: An Insidious Form of Attack'. This was a crusade that Barry, an internationalist, could only join half-heartedly."
