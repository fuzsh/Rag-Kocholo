        "text": "8.8K\n\n“Location location location”, is the phrase that so many Abruzzo, George Clooney & The American buffs have been drooling over in increasing volume & vigour this week, inspired by the scenic hot spots used for the film.\n\nEleonora Baldwin, who worked as Continuity Editor during the film as well as Editor for Aglio, Olio & Peperoncino obliged us with the full list and a little about her favourite location spot a world away from her hometown of Rome:\n\nCastel del Monte | Castelvecchio | Sulmona | Introdacqua | Calascio | Sagittario River by Corfinio | Roads between Castel del Monte & S. Stefano di Sessanio | Pacentro – (Taverna Caldora) | Parco Gran Sasso – Madonnina (Campo Imperatore)| Roads around Farindola | Anversa | Road to Cocullo\n\n“My favourite has to be Castel del Monte! Not only because it was the base from which we travelled during most of the filming, but also because it was so pure, so real and authentic. I felt enamoured by its stark beauty and the simplicity of its daily life. The location was chosen because of its arches and narrow flights of cobblestone steps leading to small doorways, and the odd-shaped courtyards that squeezed in teeny stone churches. The town was a perfect medieval labyrinth, but then, beyond the tight maze of alleys, suddenly bold and towering lines of jagged pinnacles with snow-capped peaks and starry skies above; winding country roads flanked by steep hills, and the breathtaking explosion of autumnal colours. Wolves, foxes and owls; sweeping views that made me feel like a soaring eagle…\n\n“But Castel del Monte was not only eye candy, I loved it because the warmth of the people and the embrace with which they accepted our travelling circus, was overwhelming. I love the Abruzzesi, and the Castellani are no exception. They appear austere and stern at first, but they are capable of monumental hospitality and generosity. It was heartwarming to see how–despite the hardships brought by the April 2009 earthquake – these were amongst the most fun-loving folk we had ever met. I lived in a family run b&b, and it felt like family. I knew everybody’s name by week two. I knew the town like the back of my hand and, for the first time in ages, I felt like I belonged.”"
