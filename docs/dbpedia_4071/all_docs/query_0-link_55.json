A living dead body :\n\n—\n\n;\n\n:\n\n;\n\n!\n\nare idle,\n\ncontradictory,\n\nbut so are vampires.”\n\nincomprehensible,\n\n— Introductory\n\n3\n\n“ Vampires,” says the learned Zopfius, come out of their graves in the night time, rush upon people sleeping in their beds, suck out all their blood and destroy them. They attack men, women, and children, sparing neither age nor sex. Those who “\n\nare under the mahgnity of their influence\n\ncomplain of suffocation and a total deflciency of spirits, after which they soon expire. Some of them being asked at the point of death what is the matter with them, their answer is that such persons lately dead rise to torment them.” Not all vampires, however, are, or were, Some, according to the suckers of blood. records, despatched their victims by in-\n\nupon them contagious diseases, or stranghng them without drawing blood, flicting\n\nor causing their speedy or retarded death\n\nby various other means. Messrs Skeat and Blagden, in Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula (vol. i. p. 473), that “ a vampire, according to the view of Sakai of Perak, is not a demon\n\nstate\n\neven though it is incidentally so-called but a being of flesh and blood,” and support this view by the statement that the vampire cannot pass through walls and hedges.\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n4\n\nThe\n\nword vampire (Dutch, vampyr Pohsh, wampior or upior Slownik, upir Ukraine, upeer) is held by Skeat to be derived from the Servian wampira. The ;\n\n;\n\n;\n\nRussians,\n\nMorlacchians,\n\ninliabitants\n\nof\n\nMontenegro, Bohemians, Servians, Amauts, both of Hydra and Albania, know the vampire under the name of wukodalak, vurkulaka, or vrykolaka, a word which means “ woK-fairy,” and is thought by some In Crete, to be derived from the Greek. where Slavonic influence has not been felt, the vampire is known by the name of katakhand.\n\nVampire\n\nlore\n\nis,\n\nin\n\ngeneral,\n\nconfined to stories of resuscitated corpses\n\nmale human beings, though amongst the Malays a penangglan, or vampire, is a hving witch, who can be killed if she can be caught in the act of witchery. She is especially feared in houses where a birth has taken place, and it is the custom to hang up a bunch of thistle in order to catch She is said to keep vinegar at home her. of\n\nto aid her in re-entering her own body. the Malay Peninsula, parts of Pol5niesia\n\nIn\n\nand\n\nthe neighbouring districts, the vampire is conceived as a head with entrails attached, which comes forth to suck the blood of\n\nIntroductory\n\nhuman\n\n5\n\nIn Transylvania, the behef prevails that every person killed by a nosferatu (vampire) becomes in turn a vampire, and will continue to suck the blood of other innocent people until the evil spirit has been exorcised, either by opening the grave of the suspected person and driving a stake through the corpse, or firing In very a pistol-shot into the coffin. living\n\nbeings.\n\nobstinate cases\n\nit is\n\nto cut off the head,\n\ngarhc,\n\nrecommended mouth with\n\nfurther fill\n\nthe\n\nand then replace the head in its proper\n\nplace in the coffin\n\nheart and burn\n\nit,\n\n;\n\nor else to extract the\n\nand strew the ashes over\n\nthe grave.\n\nThe murony\n\nWallachians not only sucks blood, but also possesses the power of assuming a variety of shapes, as, for instance, those of a cat, dog, flea, or spider in consequence of which the ordinary evidence of death caused by the attack of a vampire, viz. the mark of a bite in the back of the neck, is not considered indispensable. The Wallachians have a very great fear of sudden death, greater perhaps than any other people, for they attribute sudden death to the attack of a vampire, and beheve that anyone destroyed by a vampire must of the\n\n;\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n6\n\nbecome a vampire, and that no power can save him from this fate. A similar behef obtains in Northern Albania, where also held that a\n\nto enter the\n\nwandering\n\nbody\n\nof\n\nspirit\n\nit\n\nis\n\nhas power\n\nany individual\n\nguilty of\n\nundetected crime, and that such obsession forms part of his punishment.\n\nSome\n\nwriters have\n\nof the belief in\n\nascribed the origin\n\nvampires to Greek Christi-\n\nanity, but there are traces of the superstition\n\nand behef at a considerably\n\nearlier date than In the opinion of the anthropologist Tylor, “ the shortest way of treating the behef is to refer it directly to the principles We shall see that most of savage animism.\n\nthi^\n\nof its details fall into their places at once,\n\nand that vampires are not mere creations\n\nof\n\ngroundless fancy, but causes conceived in spiritual\n\nform to account\n\nof wasting disease.”\n\nfor specific facts\n\nmore than prooffering up hving\n\nIt is\n\nbable that the practice of\n\nanimals as sacrifices to satisfy the thirst of departed human beings, combined with the ideas of the Platonist and the teachings of the learned Jew, Isaac Arbanel, who maintained that before the soul can be loosed from the fetters of the fiesh it must he some months with it in the grave, may\n\nIntroductory\n\n7\n\nhave influenced the behef and assisted its development. Vampirism found a place in Babylonian belief and in the folk-lore and traditions of many countries of the Near East. The belief was quite common in Arabia, although there is no trace of it there in pre-Christian times.\n\nThe earhest\n\nreferences to vampires are found in Chaldean\n\nand Assyrian\n\nRomans gave\n\ntablets.\n\nLater,\n\nthe pagan\n\ntheir adherence to the behef\n\nthat the dead bodies of certain people could\n\nbe allured from their graves by sorcerers, unless the bodies had actually undergone decomposition, and that the only means of ” effectually preventing such “ resurrections was by cremating the remains. In Grecian lore there are many wonderful stories of the dead rising from their graves and feasting upon the blood of the young and beautiful. From Greece and Rome the superstition spread throughout Austria, Hungary, Lorraine, Poland, Roumania, Iceland, and even to the British Isles, reaching its height in the period from 1723 to 1735, when a vampire fever or epidemic broke out in the south-east of Europe, particularly in Hungary and Servia. The behef in vampires even spread to Africa, where the\n\n— 8\n\nVaivipires\n\nand\n\nVaivipirism\n\nbad men alone Hve a second time and try to kill the hving by night. According to a local superstition of the Lesbians, the unquiet ghost of the Virgin Gello used to haunt their island, and was supposed to cause the deaths of young Kaffirs held that\n\nchildren.\n\nVarious devices have been resorted to in different countries at the time of burial,\n\ndead could thus be prevented from returning to earth-hfe. In some instances, e.g, among the Wallachians, a long nail was driven through the skull of the corpse, and the thorny stem of a wild\n\nin the belief that the\n\nrose-bush laid upon the body, in order that its\n\nshroud might become entangled with\n\nit,\n\nshould it attempt to rise. The Kroats and Slavonians burned the straw upon which the suspected body lay. They then locked up all the cats and dogs, for if these animals stepped over the corpse it would assuredly return as a vampire and suck the blood of the village folk.\n\nMany\n\nheld that to drive\n\na white thorn stake through the dead body rendered the vampire harmless, and the peasants of Bukovdna still retain the practice of driving an ash stake through the breasts of suicides\n\nand supposed vampires\n\nIntroductory\n\n9\n\na practice common in England, so far as suicides were concerned, until 1823, when there was passed “ An Act to alter and amend the law relating to the interment of the remains of any person found /eZo de ^e,” in which it was enacted that the coroner or other officer “ shall give directions for the private interment of the remains of such person felo de se without any stake being driven through the body of such person.” It was also ordained that the burial was only to take place between nine and twelve o’clock at night.\n\nThe driving\n\nof a stake\n\nthrough the body\n\ndoes not seem to have had always the desired effect.\n\nDe\n\nSchartz, in his\n\nMagia\n\nPostuma, pubhshed at Olmutz in 1706, tells of a shepherd in the village of Blow, near Kadam, in Bohemia, who made several appearances after his death and called certain persons, who never failed to die within eight days of such caU. The peasants of Blow took up the body and fixed it to the ground by means of a stake driven through the corpse. The man, when in that condition, told them that they were very good to give him a stick with which he could defend himself against the dogs\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n10\n\nwhich worried him. Notwithstanding the stake, he got up again that same night, alarmed many people, and, presumably out of revenge, strangled more people in that one night than he had ever done on a single occasion before.\n\nIt\n\nwas decided to hand\n\nover his body to the public executioner, who was ordered to see that the remains\n\nwere burned outside the\n\nvillage.\n\nWhen\n\nthe executioner and his assistants attempted to\n\nmove the\n\ncorpse for that purpose,\n\nit\n\nhowled hke a madman, and moved its feet and hands as though it were ahve. They then pierced the body through with stakes, but he again uttered loud cries and a great quantity of bright vermihon blood flowed from him. The cremation, however, put an end to the apparition and haunting of the\n\nspectre.\n\nDe\n\nSchartz\n\nsays\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nonly remedy for these apparitions is to cut off the heads and burn the bodies of those who come back to haunt their former\n\nhowever, customary to hold a pubhc inquiry and examination of witnesses before proceeding to the burning of a body, and if, upon examination of the body, it was found that the corpse had begun to decompose, that the hmbs were abodes.\n\nIt\n\nwas,\n\nIntroductory\n\n11\n\nnot supple and mobile, and the blood not fluidic, then burning was not commanded. Even in the case of suspected persons an interval of six to seven weeks was always allowed to lapse before the grave was opened in order to ascertain whether the flesh had decayed and the hmbs lost their suppleness and mobility. A Strigon or Indian vampire, who was transfixed with a sharp thorn cudgel, near Larbach, in 1672, pulled it out of his body and flung it back contemptuously. Barthohn, in de Causa contemjptus mortis, tells the story of a man, named Harpye, who ordered his wife to bury him exactly at the kitchen door, in order that he might The see what went on in the house. woman executed her commission, and soon after his death he appeared to several people in the neighbourhood, killed people while they were engaged in their occupations, and played so many mischievous pranks that the inhabitants began to move away from the village. At last a man named Olaus Pa took courage and ran at the spectre with a lance, which he drove into the apparition. The spectre instantly vanished, taking the spear with it. Next morning\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n12\n\nOlaus had the grave of Harpye opened, when he found the lance in the dead body, which had not become corrupted. The corpse was then taken from the grave, burned, and the ashes thrown into the sea, and the spectre did not afterwards trouble the inhabitants.\n\nTo\n\ncross the\n\narms\n\nof the corpse, or to\n\nplace a cross or crucifix\n\nupon the grave,\n\nor to bury a suspected corpse at the junction of four cross-roads, was, in\n\nsome\n\nparts,\n\nregarded as an efficacious preventive of vampirism. It will be remembered that it was at one time the practice in England to bury suicides at the four cross-roads. If a vampire should make its appearance, it could be prevented from ever appearing again by forcing it to take the oath not to do so, if the words “ by my winding-sheet ” were incorporated in the oath.\n\nOne charm employed by the Wallachians to prevent a person\n\nbecoming a vampire\n\nwas to rub the body\n\nin certain parts with\n\nthe lard of a pig killed on St Ignatius’s\n\nDay. In Poland and Russia, vampires make their appearance from noon to midnight\n\nIntroductory\n\n13\n\ninstead of between nightfall and dawn, the generally prevails. They come and suck the blood of hving men and animals in such abundance that sometimes it flows from them at the nose and ears, and occasionally in such profusion that the corpse swims in the blood thus oozing from it as it lies in the coffln. One may become immune from the attacks of vampires by mixing this blood with flour and making bread from the mixture, a portion of which must be eaten otherwise the charm will not work. The CaHfornians held that the mere breaking of rule that\n\n;\n\nthe spine of the corpse\n\nwas\n\nsufficient to\n\nprevent its return as a vampire. Sometimes heavy stones were piled on the grave to keep the ghost within, a practice to which Frazer traces the origin of funeral cairns\n\nand tombstones.\n\nof the Sorbonne, passed\n\nTwo\n\nresolutions\n\nbetween 1700 and\n\n1710, prohibited the cutting off of the heads\n\nand the maiming\n\nof the bodies of persons\n\nsupposed to be vampires. In the^ German folk-tale\n\nknown\n\nas\n\nFaithful John, the statue said to the king “ If you, with your own hand, cut off the :\n\nheads of both your children and sprinkle\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n14\n\nme\n\nwith their blood, I shall be brought to According to primitive ideas, blood is life, and to receive blood is to receive hfe the soul of the dead wants to live, and, consequently, loves blood. The shades in Hades are eager to drink the blood of Odysseus’s sacrifice, that their life may be renewed for a time. It is of the greatest importance that the soul should get what it desires, as, if not satisfied, it might come and attack the hving. It is possible that the bodily mutilations which\n\nhfe again.”\n\n:\n\nday accompany funerals among some peoples have their origin in the behef that the departed spirit is refreshed by the blood thus spilt. The Samoans called it an “ offering of blood ” for the dead when the mourners beat their heads till the\n\nto\n\nthis\n\nblood ran. The Australian native sorcerers are said to acquire their magical influence by eating human flesh, but this is done once only in a hfetime. According to Nider’s Formicarius, part of the ceremony of initiation .into wizardry and witchcraft consisted in drinking in a church, before the commencement of Mass, from a flask filled with blood\n\ntaken from the corpses of murdered infants.\n\nIntroductory The methods employed\n\n15\n\nfor the detection\n\nvampires have varied according to the countries in which the behef in their existence was maintained. In some places it was held that, if there were discovered in a grave two or three or more holes about the size of a man’s finger, it would almost certainly foUow that a body with all the marks of vampirism would be discovered of\n\nwithin the grave.\n\nThe WaUachians em-\n\nployed a rather elaborate method of divinaThey were in the habit of choosing tion. a boy young enough to make it certain that he was innocent of any impurity. He was then placed on an absolutely black and unmutilated horse which had never stumbled. The horse was then made to ride about the cemetery and pass over aU the graves. If the horse refused to pass over any grave, even in spite of repeated blows, that grave was believed to shelter a vampire. Their records state that when such a grave was opened it was generally found to contain a corpse as fat and handsome as that of a full-blooded man quietly, sleeping. The finest vermilion blood would fiow from the throat when cut, and this was held to be the blood he had sucked\n\nVampires and Vaivipirism\n\n16\n\nfrom the veins\n\nof living people.\n\nIt is said\n\nthat the attacks of the vampire generally ceased on this being done.\n\nIn the town of Perlepe, between Monastru and Kjuprih, there existed the extraordinary phenomenon of a number of famihes who were regarded as being the offspring of vrykolakas, and as possessing the power of laying the wandering spirits to which they were related. They are said to have kept their art very dark and to have practised it in secret, but their fame was so widely spread that persons in need of such dehverance were accustomed to send for them from other cities. In ordinary hfe and intercourse they were avoided by all the inhabitants.\n\nAlthough some vTiters have contended that no vampire has yet been caught in\n\nvampirism, and that, as no has secured a specimen, the whole of the stories concerning vampires may be regarded as mythical, others have held firmly to a behef in their Dr Pierart, existence and inimical power. the\n\nact\n\nmuseum\n\nin\n\nof\n\nof natural history\n\nLa Revue\n\nwrote\n\n:\n\nSpiritualiste (vol. iv. p.\n\n104),\n\n“ After a crowd of facts of\n\nvam-\n\npirism so often proved, shall\n\nwe say that\n\nIntroductory\n\n17\n\nmore to be had, and that these never had a foundation ? Nothing comes of nothing. Every behef, every custom,\n\nthere are no\n\nand causes which give one had never seen appear\n\nsprings from facts it\n\nbirth.\n\nin the\n\nIf\n\nbosom\n\nof their families, in various\n\ncountries, beings clothed in the appearance of departed ones known to them, sucking the blood of one or more persons, and if the deaths of the victims had not followed after such apparitions, the disinterment of\n\nand\n\ncorpses would not have taken place,\n\nthere would never have been tation\n\nof\n\nthe\n\notherwise\n\nthe attes-\n\nincredible\n\nfact\n\nof persons buried for several years being\n\nfound with the body soft and flexible, the eyes wide open, the complexion rosy, the mouth and nose fuU of blood, and the blood flowing fuUy when the body was struck or wounded or the head cut ofl.” “I Bishop d’Avranches Huet wrote will not examine whether the facts of vampirism, which are constantly being :\n\nare true, or the fruit of a popular error but it is beyond doubt that they are testifled to by so many able and trustworthy authors, and by so many eye-witnesses, that no one ought\n\nreported,\n\n;\n\n2\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n18\n\nto decide the question without a good deal of caution.”\n\nDr tion\n\nPierart gave the following explana“ Poor, dead their existence\n\nof\n\n:\n\ncataleptics, buried as\n\nif\n\nreally\n\ndead in cold\n\nand dry spots where morbid causes are\n\nin-\n\ncapable of effecting the destruction of their bodies, the astral spirit, enveloping itself with a fluidic ethereal body, is prompted to quit the precincts of its exercise\n\non\n\ntomb and\n\nliving bodies acts\n\nto\n\npecuhar to\n\nphysical hfe, especially that of nutrition,\n\nthe result of which, by a mysterious link\n\nbetween soul and body which spirituahstic science will some day explain, is forwarded to the material\n\ntomb, and the petuate\n\nbody lying\n\nstill\n\nwithin\n\nits\n\nlatter is thus helped to per-\n\nits vital\n\nexistence.”\n\nApart from the spectre vampire there is, of course, the vampire bat in the world of natural history, which is said to suck blood from a sleeping person, insinuating its tongue into a vein, but without inflicting pain. Captain Steadman, during his expedition to Surinam, awoke early one morning and was alarmed to find his hammock steeped almost through and himself weltering in blood, although he was\n\nIntroductory\n\n19\n\nwithout pain. It was discovered that he had been bitten by a vampire bat. Pennant says that in some parts of America they destroyed all the cattle introduced by the missionaries.\n\nCHAPTER\n\nII\n\nEXCOMMUNICATION AND\n\nThe Greek Church\n\nITS\n\nPOWER\n\nat one time taught that\n\nthe bodies of persons upon\n\nwhom\n\nthe ban\n\nexcommunication had been passed did undergo decomposition after death until such sentence had been revoked by the pronouncement of absolution over the remains, and that, while the bodies remained in this uncorrupted condition, the spirits of the individuals wandered up and down the earth seeking sustenance from of\n\nnot\n\nthe blood of the hving. The non-corruption of a body, however, was also held to\n\nbe one of the proofs of sanctity; but, in this case, the body preserved its natural colour and gave an agreeable odour, whereas the bodies of the excommunicated generally turned black, swelled out like a drum, and emitted an offensive smell. Very frequently, however, when the graves of 20\n\nExcommunication and\n\nits\n\nPower\n\n21\n\nsuspected vampires were opened, the faces\n\nwere found to be of ruddy complexion and the veins distended with blood, which, when opened with a lancet, 3uelded a supply of blood as plentiful, fresh, and free as that found in the veins of young and healthy For many centuries living human beings. in the history of Greek Christianity there was scarcely a village that had not its own local vampire stories which were related by the inhabitants and vouched for by them as having either occurred within their own knowledge or been related to them by their parents or relatives as having come within their personal observation or been verified by them. The bodies of murderers and suicides were also held to be exempt from the law of dissolution of the mortal remains until the Church granted release from the curse entailed upon them by such act. The priests, by this assumption of power over the body as well as over the soul,\n\nmade\n\nuse of this superstitious belief preying upon the fears and credulity\n\nprofitable\n\nby\n\nof the hving.\n\nThey\n\nalso included in this\n\nlaw of exemption from corruption after death those who in their fives\n\necclesiastical\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n22\n\nhad been guilty of heinous sins, those who had tampered with the magic arts, and all who had been cursed during hfe by their parents. These were all said to become vampires. This behef spread to other branches of the Christian Church, and the story is related that St Libentius, Archbishop of Bremen, who died 4th January 1013, once excommunicated a gang of pirates, one of whom died shortly afterwards and was buried in Norway. Seventy years afterwards his body was found quite entire and uncorrupted, nor did it fall to ashes until it had received absolution from the Bishop Alvareda. Leo Allatius, a Roman Catholic, describes a corpse which he found in an undecomposed condition. He implies that the Greeks connected the circumstance with the power invested in them by the “ Whatsoever thou shalt bind on text earth shall be bound in heaven,” and by which they hold that the soul is excluded :\n\nfrom\n\nall\n\nbliss so\n\nhope\n\nof\n\nparticipation in future\n\nlong as the body remains undecom-\n\nanother writer, also states that whenever a bishop or priest excommunicated a person he added to the\n\nposed.\n\nPoqueville,\n\n;\n\n:\n\nExcommunication and\n\nits\n\nPower\n\n23\n\ngeneral sentence of excommunication the “ After death, let not thy body words :\n\nhave power to dissolve.” A manuscript was discovered many years ago in the Church of St Sophia at Thessalonica, which is an interesting commentary upon the power claimed by the Church over excommunicated bodies. The manuscript states that (\n\n1)\n\nWhoever has been laid under any curse any injunction from his deceased\n\nor received\n\nparents that he has not\n\nfulfilled, after his\n\ndeath the forepart of his body remains entire (2) Whoever has been the object of any anathema appears yellow after death, and the fingers are shrivelled (3)\n\n;\n\nWhoever appears white has\n\ncommunicated by the divine laws\n\nbeen’ ex;\n\nWhoever appears black has been communicated by a bishop.

One horrible result of this ghastly superstition was the custom which was at one time prevalent among the Greeks of Salonica, as weU as the Bulgarians in the centre of European signs, the\n\n24\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\nTurkey, and other nations, of disinterring indiscriminately the bodies of the dead after they had been buried for twelve months, in order to ascertain from the condition of the remains whether the souls were in heaven or hell, or perambulating the neighbourhood as vampires. This assumed ecclesiastical power acted occasionally, however, injuriously on the There is on record one clergy themselves. instance where a priest w^as killed in revenge for the death of a man whose illness was attributed to the sentence of excommunicaOn tion that had been passed upon him. another occasion a bishop of some diocese in Morea was robbed by a band of brigands as he was passing through a portion of the Wlien the deed was Maniate territory. done the mountaineers bethought themselves that the bishop would, in all probability, excommunicate them as soon as he reached a place of safety. They saw no means of averting this, to them, dreadful calamity, except by the committal of a and so further and more heinous crime the unfortunate they set out in pursuit of bishop, whom they eventually overtook and murdered. ;\n\nExcommunication and\n\nits\n\nPower\n\n25\n\nMany years ago a Greek of Keramia complained to the Pasha of Khania that the papas of his village had excommunicated him and so been the indirect cause of his having been bewitched. The Pasha sent for the priest, threw him into prison, and only released him upon payment of a fine 300 piastres. During a local war a native of Theriso was taken ill the cry went up “ It is an aphorismos.” The papas was accused, reviled, and threatened with murder unless the curse was removed but the man continued to get worse, and eventually died. So firm was the behef of everyone in the neighbourhood that the ban had caused the man’s death that some of his companions regarded it as a duty to avenge his fate, and, in consequence, they sought out the priest and shot him. of\n\n:\n\n:\n\n;\n\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century the Metropohtan of Larissa was informed that a papas had disinterred two bodies and thrown them into the Hahaemon on\n\nUpon summoned before the bishop the priest\n\npretence of their being vrukolakas.\n\nbeing\n\nadmitted the truth of the accusation, and by saying that a report had\n\njustified his act\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n26\n\nbeen current that a large animal, accompanied with flames, had been seen to issue from the grave in which these two bodies had been buried. The bishop fined the priest 250 piastres, and sent a proclamation throughout the diocese that, in future, similar offences would be punished wdth double that fine and be accompanied ^\\dth loss of position.\n\nMartin Crusius tells the following curious There were about the court of\n\nstory.\n\nMahomet\n\nII.\n\na number of\n\nmen\n\nlearned in\n\nGreek and Arabic hterature, who had investigated a variety of points connected vdth the Christian faith. They informed the\n\nSultan\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nbodies\n\nof\n\npersons\n\nexcommunicated by the Greek clergy did not decompose, and when he inquired whether the effect of absolution was to dissolve them, he was answered in the affirmative.\n\nUpon\n\nthis,\n\nhe sent orders to\n\nMaximus, the Patriarch of that period, to produce a case by which the truth of the statement might be tested. The Patriarch convened his clergy in great trepidation, and after long dehberation they ascertained that a woman had been excommunicated by the previous Patriarch for the commis-\n\nExcommunication and\n\nPower\n\nits\n\n27\n\nThey ascertained the her grave, and when they\n\nsion of grievous sins.\n\nwhereabouts of had opened it they found that the corpse was entire, but swollen out hke a drum. When the news of this reached the Sultan, he despatched some of his officers to possess themselves of the body, which they did, and deposited it in a safe place. On an appointed day the liturgy was said over\n\nand the Patriarch recited the absolution As this was the bones being done wonderful to relate\n\nit\n\nin the presence of the officials.\n\n—\n\n!\n\nwere heard to rattle as they\n\nfell\n\n—\n\napart in the\n\nand at the same time, the narrator woman’s soul was also freed from the punishment to which it had been condemned. The courtiers at once ran and informed the Sultan, who was astonished at ‘‘ the miracle, and exclaimed Of a surety the Christian rehgion is true.” Calmet also relates this story, and adds that the body was found to be entirely black and much swollen that it was placed in a chest under the Emperor’s seal, which chest was not opened until three days after the absolution had been pronounced, when the body was seen to be reduced to ashes. During the long war between the Chriscoffin,\n\nadds, the\n\n;\n\n;\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n28\n\nand Mohammedans in the island of Crete, it became a matter of astonishment that ravages caused by vampires were no\n\ntians\n\nlonger the subject of conversation.\n\ncan\n\nit\n\nbe,\n\nwhen the number\n\n“\n\nHow\n\nof deaths is so\n\nnone of those that die become katakhanas ? ” was the question asked, to be met with the answer “No one ever becomes a katakhana if he dies in time great, that\n\n:\n\nof war.”\n\nLeo Allatius also relates that he was told by Athanasius, Metropolitan of Imbros, that, on one occasion, being earnestly entreated to pronounce the absolution over a number of corpses that had long remained undecomposed, he consented to do so, and before the recitation was concluded they all fell\n\naway\n\nRycaut\n\ninto ashes. relates a similar occurrence, to\n\nwhich he appends the following remark “ This story I should not have judged worth relating, but that I heard it from the :\n\nmouth of a grave person who says that his own eyes were witnesses thereof.” The Hydhraeans (or Hydhrioks) say there used to be a great number of vampires in Hydhra, and that is\n\ntheir\n\npresent freedom\n\nto be attributed solely to the exertions\n\nExcommunication and of their bishop,\n\nits\n\nPower\n\nwho banished them\n\n29\n\nall\n\nto\n\nSantorehe, where, on the desert\n\nisle, they wandering about, roUing stones down the slope towards the sea, “ as may be heard by anyone who\n\nnow\n\nexist\n\nin\n\ngreat\n\nnumbers,\n\npasses near, in a kaik, during the night.”\n\nAt the second Council\n\nof Limoges, held in\n\n1031, the Bishop of Cahors\n\nmade the\n\nfol-\n\nlowing statement “A knight of my diocese being killed in a state of excommunication, I refused to comply with the request :\n\nof his friends,\n\nto\n\nwho\n\nsohcited\n\nhim absolution.

They then buried him afresh and covered the grave with an enormous quantity of earth and stones. The next\n\n30\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\nday the corpse was found out of the grave again, and there were no symptoms of anyone having been at work. The same thing was repeated five times, and at last they buried him in unconsecrated ground, at a distance from the churchyard, when no further incident occurred.”\n\nRycaut states that the following story was related to him with many asseverations of truth by a grave Candive Kalois called Sofronio, a preacher, and a person of no mean repute and learning at Smyrna. “ I knew,” he said, “ a certain person who, for some misdemeanours committed in the Morea, fied over to the Isle of Milo,\n\nhe escaped the hand of he could not avoid the sentence of excommunication, from which he could no more fiy than from the conviction of his own conscience, or the guilt which ever attended him for the fatal hour of his death being come, and the sentence of the Church not revoked, the body was carelessly and without solemnity interred in some retired and unfrequented place. In the meantime the relatives of the deceased were much afflicted and anxious for the sad estate of their dead friend, whilst the where,\n\nthough\n\njustice,\n\n;\n\nExcommunication and\n\nits\n\nPower\n\n31\n\npeasants and islanders were every night\n\nand disturbed with strange and unusual apparitions,^ which they immediately concluded arose from the grave of the accursed excommunicant, which, according affrighted\n\nto their custom, they immediately opened,\n\nwhen they found the body uncorrupted, ruddy, and the veins replete with blood. The coffin was furnished with grapes, apples, and nuts, and such fruits as the season afforded. Whereupon, consultation being taken, the Kaloires resolved to make use of the common remedy in those cases, which was to cut and dismember the body into several parts\n\nand to\n\nboil it in wine, as\n\nthe approved means of dislodging the evil\n\nand disposing the body to a dissoluBut the friends of the deceased, tion. being wilhng and desirous that the corpse should rest in peace and some ease given spirit\n\nto the departed soul, obtained a reprieve\n\nfrom the of\n\nmoney\n\nclergy,\n\nand hoped that\n\nfor a\n\nsum\n\n(they being persons of a competent\n\nestate) a release\n\nmight be purchased from\n\nthe excommunication under the hand of the Patriarch.

And now the corpse was taken into the church (the country people not being \\\\dUing it should remain in the field), and prayers and masses were daily said for its dissolution and the pardon of the offender when one day, after many prayers, supphcations, and nople\n\n;\n\nofferings\n\nwith\n\n(as\n\nmany\n\nthis\n\nSofrino attested to\n\nprotestations),\n\nme\n\nand whilst he\n\nhimself was heard performing di\\dne service,\n\non a sudden was heard a rumbhng noise\n\nin\n\nthe coffin of the dead party, to the fear and astonishment of all persons then present\n\nwhich when they had opened they found the\n\nbody consumed and dissolved\n\nas far into\n\nhad been several years interred. The hour and minute of this dissolution was immediately noted and precisely observed, which being compared with the date of the Patriarch’s release when it was signed at Constantinople, it was found exactly to agree with that moment in wliich the body returned to its its\n\nfirst\n\nashes.”\n\nprinciples\n\nof\n\nearth as\n\nif\n\nit\n\nExcommunication and\n\nits\n\nPower\n\n33\n\nIn most countries the vampire was regarded as a night-wanderer, but resting in its grave on Friday night, so that the ceremony of absolution had to be performed on that night or during Saturday, because, if the spirit was out on its rambles when the ceremony took place, it was unavaihng. The Sfakians generally beheve that the ravages committed by these night-wanderers used in former times to be far more frequent than they are at the present day, and that they have become comparatively rare solely in consequence of the increased zeal and skill possessed by members of the sacerdotal order.\n\nTournefort relates an entertaining story vampire that woefully annoyed the Prayers, procesinhabitants of Myconi. sions, stabbing with swords, sprinkhngs of holy water, and even pouring the latter of a\n\nin large quantities\n\ndown\n\nrefractory vroucolaca were\n\nAn\n\nthe throat of the all tried\n\nin vain.\n\nAlbanian who chanced to be at Myconi\n\nobjected to two of these remedies.\n\nwas\n\nIt\n\nno wonder the devil continued in, he said, for how could he possibly come through the And as to swords, they holy water ? were equally effectual in preventing his 3\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n34\n\nexit, for their\n\nhandles being crosses, he was that he dare not pass\n\nmuch terrified them.

The belief is, in all probability, linked up with the almost universal\n\ntheory that transfused blood for revivification.\n\nwere\n\nanciently\n\nremedy\n\nnecessary\n\nis\n\nBaths of human blood prescribed\n\nas\n\na\n\npossible\n\nfor leprosy.\n\nMr R.

Greece until after* the estabhshment of Christianity,\n\nand there are many remarkable\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n38\n\nvampire apparitions among the Slavonic races bordering on Greece, as stories told of\n\nwell\n\nas\n\namong\n\nthe\n\nIn\n\nArabians.\n\nlater\n\ntimes, Father Richard, a French Jesuit of\n\nthe seventeenth century, went as a missionary to the Archipelago, and has left an account of the islands of Santerini in which he discourses at length upon the bucolacs or vampires of that district. Some Greeks believe that the spectre which appears is not really the soul of the deceased, but an evil spirit which enters his body after the soul of the owner has been withdrawn. Thus Leo Allatius, in “ The corpse describing the behef, says is entered by a demon which is the source of ruin to unhappy men. For frequently emerging from the tomb in the form of that body and roaming about the city and other inhabited places, especially by night it betakes itself to any house it fancies, and, after knocking at the door, addresses one of If the person the inmates in a loud tone. answers he is done for two days after that he dies.

The man bravely resisted the temptation, and was tortured in several ways, till at last they cut off his head, and threw his body out of the city to be devoured by dogs. The next night it was carried away by the Christians, who, having embalmed it and wrapped it up in fine hnen, interred it in an honourable part of the church with all the respect due But at the to the remains of a martyr. next celebration of the Mass, upon the deacons crying out aloud as usual, Let the catechumens and all who do not communicate retire,” his grave instantly opened and the martyr retired into the church When Mass was over he came again porch. of his own accord into the grave. Not long afterwards it was revealed by an angel\n\n40\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\nto a holy person,\n\nwho had continued\n\nthree\n\ndays in prayer, that the deceased ecclesihad been excommunicated by his\n\nastic\n\nsuperior, and would continue bound till that same superior had reversed the sentence. Upon this a messenger was despatched to\n\nthe desert after the holy anchorite,\n\nwho\n\nordered the grave to be opened and absolved the deceased, who, after this, continued in his\n\ngrave in peace. Pitton de Toumefort, in his Voyage into the Levant, gives the following interesting account “We were present at a very different scene and one very barbarous at Myconi. The man, whose story we are going to relate, was a peasant of Myconi, naturally ill-natured and quarrelsome ; this is a circumstance to be taken notice of he was murdered in the in such a case :\n\n:\n\nfields,\n\nnobody vknew how\n\nTwo days\n\nor\n\nby whom.\n\nafter his being buried in a chapel\n\ntown\n\nwas noised about that he was seen to walk about in the night with great haste, that he tumbled about other people’s goods, put out their lamps, gripped them behind, and played a dozen other monkey tricks. At first the story was received with laughter, but the thing was looked upon in the\n\nit\n\nBabylon, Assyria, and Greece seriously\n\nwhen the\n\n41\n\nbetter sort of people\n\nbegan to complain of it the papas themselves gave credit to the fact, and no doubt had their reasons for so doing masses but for all this the were duly said peasant drove his old trade and heeded nothing they could do. After divers meet:\n\n;\n\n;\n\nings of the chief people of the city, of priests\n\nand monks, it was gravely concluded that it was necessary in consequence of some musty ceremonial to wait till the ninth day after the interment should be expired.\n\n“\n\nOn\n\nthe tenth day they said one Mass\n\nwhere the body was laid in order to drive out the demon which they imagined was got into it. After Mass they took up his body and got everything ready for blowing out his heart. The corpse stunk so abominably that they were obhged to burn frankincense, but the smoke mixing with the exhalations from the carcase in the chapel\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nevery person averred that the blood of the corpse was extremely red. The butcher swore that the body was\n\nincreased the stench\n\nstill\n\n;\n\nwarm. ...”\n\nPitton concludes the story by ridiculing the theory that this was the body of a vampire or vrowolaca.\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n42\n\nThe\n\nbody of a proved vampire does not appear to have found general favour in practice of burning the\n\nsuspected Greece,\n\nor\n\ndoubtless\n\nby reason\n\nof\n\nthe fact\n\nthat the Greeks possessed a rehgious horror\n\nburning a body on which holy oil had been poured by the priest when performing the last rites upon the dying man. Leake, whose Travels in Northern Greece were published in 1835, says in the fourth volume of that work “It would be difficult now to meet with an example of the most barbarous of all these superstitions, the Vrukolaka. The name being Illyric, seems to acquit the Greeks of the invention, which was probably introduced into the country by the barbarians of of\n\n:\n\nSclavonic race.\n\nTournefort’s description\n\nis\n\nadmitted to be correct. The Devil is supposed to enter the Vrukolaka, who, rising from his grave, torments first his nearest relatives and then others, causing their death or loss of health. The remedy is to dig up the body and if, after it has been exorcised persists it\n\ninto\n\nby the in\n\npriest,\n\nannoying\n\nsmall pieces,\n\nsufficient, to\n\nburn\n\nit.”\n\nthe\n\nthe or,\n\ndemon\n\nhving, if\n\nthat\n\nto\n\nstill\n\ncut\n\nbe not\n\n— Babylon, Assyria, and Greece In\n\nCrete\n\nthe\n\nkatalkanas, as\n\nand\n\nbelief\n\nthe\n\nin\n\nCretans\n\nand\n\nvampires call\n\n43\n\n—or\n\nthem\n\nforms a general article of popular belief throughthe but is particularly out island, strong in the mountains, and if anyone ventures to doubt it, undeniable facts are brought forward to silence the their existence\n\nill-deeds\n\nincredulous.\n\nOne\n\nof the stories told\n\nas follows\n\n‘‘ :\n\nby the Cretans\n\nOnce upon a time the\n\nis\n\nvillage\n\nof Kahkrati, in the district of Sfakia, was haunted by a Katakhanas, and the people did not know what man he was or from what part he came. This Katakhanas destroyed both children and full-grown men, and desolated both that village and many others. They had buried him at the church of St George at Kalikrati, and in those times he was regarded as a man of note, and they had built an arch over his grave. Now a certain shepherd, beheved to be his mutual Synteknos,^ was tending his sheep and ^ That is, related to each other through god-parents. In Crete, those whose god-parents were the same or were connected by ties of kinship were regarded as being in consanguineous relationship, and therefore\n\nwere unable to contract marriages with each other.\n\n;; :\n\n44\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\ngoats near the church, and, on being caught\n\nhe went to the sepulchre that he might be protected from the rain. Afterwards he determined to sleep and pass the night there, and, after taking off his arms, he placed them by the stone which served him as his pillow, crosswise. And people might say that it was on this account that the Katakhands was not permitted to leave his tomb. During the night, then, as he wished to go out again, that he might destroy men, he said to the shepherd Gossip, get up hence, for I have some in a shower,\n\n‘\n\nbusiness that requires\n\nme\n\nThe shepherd answered\n\nliim not, either the\n\nfirst\n\nor the second,\n\ntime,\n\nfurther, he\n\nto\n\ncome\n\nout.’\n\nor the third\n\nknew that the man had become\n\na Katakhanas, and that\n\nit was he w’ho had done all those evil deeds. On this account he said to him on the fourth time of his\n\nup hence, gossip, for I fear you are no better than you should be and may do me some mischief but if I must get up, swear to me by your winding-sheet that you will not hurt me, and on that I will get up.’ And he did not speaking\n\n‘\n\n:\n\nI\n\nshall\n\nnot\n\nget\n\npronounce the proposed words, but said other things\n\n;\n\nnevertheless,\n\nwhen the\n\nshep-\n\nBabylon, Assyria, and Greece\n\n45\n\nherd did not suffer him to get up, he swore to On this he got up, and, as he wished. taking his arms, removed them away from the monument, and the Katakhanas came forth, and, after greeting the shepherd, said to him Gossip, you must not go away, but\n\nhim\n\n‘\n\n:\n\ndown\n\nhave some business but I shall return which I must go after within the hour, for I have something to say to you.’ So the shepherd waited\n\nsit\n\nhere\n\n;\n\nfor I\n\n;\n\nfor him.\n\n“\n\nAnd the Katakhanas went a distance of about ten miles, where there was a couple recently married, and he destroyed them. On his return the gossip saw that he was carrying some hver, his hands being moistened and, as he carried it, he blew with blood into it, just as the butcher does, to increase the size of the liver.

In this case the monster was tracked to a vault in the churchyard, where forty or fifty coffins were found open, their contents mutilated and scattered around. One coffin only was untouched, and on the hd being taken off the form was recognised as being that of the apparition which had been seen, and the body was accordingly burnt, when the manifestations ceased. In vol. iii. of Borderland Dr Franz Hartmann gave particulars of some vampire cases which had come under his observation.\n\n“\n\nA\n\nyoung lady\n\nwho asked\n\nof\n\nG\n\nher in marriage\n\nhad an admirer, but as he was ;\n\na drunkard she refused and married another.\n\nGreat and Greater Britain\n\n51\n\nThereupon the lover shot himself, and soon after that event a vampire, assuming his form, visited her frequently at night,\n\nespecially\n\nwhen her husband was\n\nabsent.\n\nShe could not see him, but felt his presence way that could leave no room for doubt.

Thereupon the miller agreed to share the bed with the boy, and proposed to him that he should give him a certain sign when the vampire arrived.

He resolved to marry him to the daughter of another merchant, a girl of considerable\n\nfortune, but without\n\nany personal\n\nattrac-\n\nAbul-Hassan, the merchant’s son, on being shown the portrait of the lady, requested his father to delay the marriage Intill he could reconcile his mind to it. stead, however, of doing this he fell in love with another girl, the daughter of a sage, and he gave his father no peace tiU he consented to the marriage with the object The old man stood out of his affections. as long as he could, but finding that his son was bent on acquiring the hand of the fair NadiUa, and was equally resolute not to accept the rich and ugly lady, he did what tions.\n\nGreat and Greater Britain\n\n61\n\nmost fathers under such circumstances would do he acquiesced. “ The wedding took place with great pomp and ceremony, and a happy honeymoon ensued, which might have been\n\n—\n\nbut for one httle circumstance which led to very serious consequences. “ Abul-Hassan noticed that his bride quitted the nuptial couch as soon as she thought her husband was asleep, and did not return to it till an hour before dawn. “ Filled with curiosity, Hassan one night, feigning sleep, saw his wife rise and leave the room. He rose, followed cautiously, and saw her enter the cemetery. By the stragghng moonbeams he saw her go into he stepped in after her. a tomb “ The scene within was horrible. A party of ghouls were assembled with the spoils of the graves they had violated and were feasting on the flesh of the longburied corpses. His own wife, who, by the way, never touched supper at home, played a no inconsiderable part in the hideous happier\n\n:\n\nbanquet. “ As soon\n\nhe could safely escape Abul-Hassan stole back to his bed. “ He said nothing to his bride till next as\n\n62\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\nevening when supper was laid, and she dechned to eat then he insisted on her ;\n\npartaking, and\n\nwhen\n\nshe positively refused\n\nhe exclaimed roughly Oh yes, you keep your appetite for your feasts with the ghouls.’ Nadilla was silent she turned pale and trembled, and without a word sought her bed. At midnight she rose, fell on her husband with her nails and teeth, tore his throat, and, having opened a vein, attempted to suck his blood but AbulHassan, springing to his feet, threw her down and, with a blow, killed her. She was buried next day. “ Three days after at midnight she reappeared, attacked her husband again, and again attempted to suck his blood. He fled from her and on the morrow opened her tomb, burnt her to ashes and cast the ashes into the Tigris.” There is a monstrous vampire which is said to dehght in sucking the blood of children, and is known as a Panangglan.

The following story was contributed by Dr Franz Hartmann to the Occult Review for September 1909, under the title of “An Authenticated Vampire Story” “ On June 10th, 1909, there appeared in a prominent Vienna paper (the Neues Wiener Journal) a notice saying that the had been burned by the castle of B populace, because there was a great mortahty among the peasant children, and it was generally beheved that this was due to the invasion of a vampire, supposed to who died and be the last Count B acquired that reputation. The castle was situated in a wild and desolate part of the Carpathian Mountains, and was formerly a fortification against the Turks. It was not inhabited, owing to its being beheved\n\nas a survival of the ancient custom.\n\nDiesdorf\n\nit is\n\nbeheved that\n\nif\n\nmoney\n\n:\n\n,\n\nis\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n68\n\nto be in the possession of ghosts of it\n\nand “\n\nwas used as a dwelling\n\n;\n\nonly a wing\n\nfor the caretaker\n\nhis wife.\n\nNow\n\nhappened that, when I read the above notice, I was sitting in a coffeehouse at Vienna in company with an old friend of mine who is an experienced occultist and editor of a well-known journal, and who had spent several months in the neighbourhood of the castle. From him I obtained the following account, and it appears that the vampire in question was it\n\nso\n\nprobably not the old Count, but his beautiful daughter, the Countess Elga, whose photograph, taken from the original painting, I obtained.\n\nMy\n\nfriend\n\nsaid\n\n‘ :\n\nTwo\n\nyears\n\nago I was living at Hermannstadt, and being engaged in engineering a road through the\n\nhills,\n\nI often\n\ncame within the\n\nvicinity\n\nwhere I made the acquaintance of the old castellan, or caretaker, and his wife, who occupied a part of the wing of the house, almost separate from the main body of the building. They were a quiet old couple and rather reticent in giving information or expressing an opinion in regard to the strange noises which were often heard at night in the deserted halls, of the old castle,\n\n; :\n\nGermany and Other Countries\n\n69\n\nor of the apparitions which the Wallachian\n\npeasants claimed to have seen loitered in the\n\nsurroundings\n\nwhen they after\n\ndark.\n\nwas that the old Count was a widower and had a beautiful daughter, who was one day killed by a fall from her horse, and that soon after the old man died in some mysterious manner, and the bodies All I could gather\n\nwere buried in a solitary graveyard belonging to a neighbouring village. Not long after their death an unusual mortahty was noticed among the inhabitants of the village\n\nand even some grown people died without any apparent illness they merely wasted away and thus a rumour was started that the old Count had become a vampire after his death. There is no doubt that he was not a saint, as he was addicted to drinking, and some shocking several\n\nchildren\n\n;\n\nwere in circulation about his conduct and that of his daughter but whether there was any truth in them, I am not in a position to say. ‘‘ Afterwards the property came into the tales\n\n;\n\n‘\n\npossession of family,\n\nwho\n\nis\n\n,\n\na distant relative of the\n\na young\n\nman and\n\nofficer in\n\na cavalry regiment at Vienna.

He was not afraid, but anxious to see what would come of his agreement, and for the purpose of keeping himself awake he sat down and began to write an to his\n\ndistant\n\narticle for a journal.\n\n“ Tow^ards two o’clock he heard steps on\n\nthe stairs and the door of the hall opened there was the rusthng of a silk dress and the\n\nsound\n\nof the feet of a lady\n\nwalking to and\n\nfro in the corridor.\n\n“ It\n\nwhat\n\nmay\n\nbe imagined that he was somebut taking courage, he said\n\nstartled\n\nto himself\n\n‘ :\n\n;\n\nIf this is\n\nThen the door\n\nof\n\nElga\n\nShe\n\nentered.\n\nElga, let her\n\ncome\n\nin.’\n\nthe room opened and\n\nwas\n\nmost\n\nelegantly\n\nGermany and Other Countries\n\n73\n\nand appeared still more youthful and seductive than the picture. There was a lounge on the other side of the table was writing, and there she where silently posted herseK. She did not speak, but her looks and gestures left no doubt in regard to her desires and intentions. “ Mr resisted the temptation and dressed,\n\nW\n\nW\n\nremained firm. he did so out\n\nBe\n\nIt is\n\nnot\n\nknown whether\n\nof principle or timidity or\n\nmay, he kept on writfrom time to time at his visitor and silently wishing that she would leave.

The writer requested him to come to a certain place the same evening, where he would meet a gentleman who would give him further particulars. He went, and was\n\nW\n\nmet by an unknowm stranger, who told him that he was requested by the Countess Elga to invite\n\nMr\n\nW\n\nto a carriage\n\nand that she would await him at midnight at a certain crossing of two roads, not far from the village. The stranger then suddenly disappeared. “ Now it seems that Mr had some misgivings about the meeting and drive, and he hired a policeman as detective to go at midnight to the appointed place, The pohceto see what would happen. man went and reported next morning that drive,\n\nW\n\nGermany and Other Countries\n\n75\n\nhe had seen nothing but the well-known, old-fashioned carriage from the castle, with\n\ntwo black horses, standing there as if waiting for somebody, and that as he had no occasion\n\nto\n\ninterfere,\n\nuntil the carriage\n\nhe\n\nmerely waited\n\nmoved\n\nWhen\n\nthe castellan of the castle was asked, he swore on.\n\nthat the carriage had not been out that night,\n\nand\n\nday and\n\nmet a\n\ncould not have been out, as there were no horses to draw it. “ But that is not all, for on the following I\n\nin fact\n\nit\n\nfriend\n\nwho\n\nis\n\ndisbeliever in ghosts,\n\na great sceptic\n\nand always used\n\nNow, however, be very serious and said\n\nto laugh at such things.\n\nhe seemed to Last night something very strange happened to me. At about one o’clock this morning I returned from a late visit, and as I happened to pass the graveyard of the village, I saw a carriage with gilded ornaments standing at the entrance. I wondered about this taking place at such an unusual hour, and being curious to see what would happen, I waited. Two elegantly dressed ladies issued from the car;\n\n‘\n\nriage.\n\nOne\n\nof these\n\nwas young and\n\npretty,\n\nbut threw at me a devilish and scornful look as they both passed by and entered\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n76\n\nThere they were met by a man, who saluted the ladies and spoke to the younger one, saying “ Why, Miss Elga Are you returned so ” soon ?

When the priests were gone he was heard to bemoan himself and say that he was forced to take refuge in the cowl of one of the priests, who had injured the daughter of a man of consequence in the village. He continued in this manner to infest the village for three years together, and never gave over till he had set every house in it on fire.”\n\nCHAPTER\n\nVI\n\nVAMPIRISM IN HUNGARY, BAVARIA,\n\nAND\n\nSILESIA\n\nThe Hungarians believe that those who have been passive vampires in hfe become active that those whose vampires after death blood has been sucked in hfe by vampires become themselves vampires after death. In many districts the behef also prevails that the only way to prevent this calamity happening is for the threatened victim to eat some earth from the grave of the attacking vampire, and to smear his own body with blood from the body of that ;\n\nvampire.\n\nThat the behef in vampirism is still current in Hungary was evidenced recently. The Daily Telegraph of February 15th, 1912, contained the follomng paragraph “ A Buda-Pesth telegram to the Messaggero :\n\nreports a terrible instance of superstition. 79\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n80\n\nA\n\nboy\n\nof fourteen died\n\nsmall village.\n\nA\n\nsome days ago\n\nin a\n\nfarmer, in whose employ-\n\nment the boy had been, thought that the ghost of the latter appeared to him every In order to put a stop to these supposed visitations, the farmer, accompanied by some friends, went to the cemetery one night, stuffed three pieces of garhc and three stones in the mouth, and thrust a stake through the corpse, fixing it to the ground. This was to dehver themselves from the evil spirit, as the credulous farmer and his friends stated when they were arrested.” In 1732, in a village in Hungary, in the space of three months, seventeen persons of different ages died of vampirism, some without being iU, and others after languishnight.\n\ning\n\ntwo or three days.\n\nIt is reported that a\n\nnamed Stanoska, daughter of the Heyduk Jotiutso, who went to bed in perfect\n\ngirl\n\nhealth,\n\nawoke\n\nin the middle of the night\n\nand uttering\n\nterrible\n\nshrieks, declaring that the son of the\n\nHeyduk\n\ntrembling JVIillo,\n\nviolently\n\nwho had been dead\n\nnine weeks, had\n\nnearly strangled her in her sleep. She fell into a languid state and died at the end of three days.\n\nYoung\n\nMillo\n\nand found to be a vampire.\n\nwas exhumed\n\nHungary, Bavaria, and Silesia\n\n81\n\nCalmet, in his work The Phantom World, “ About fifteen years relates the following :\n\nago a soldier who was billeted at the house of a Haidamaque peasant, on the frontiers of Hungary, as he was one day sitting at table near his host, the master of the house, saw a person he did not know come in and sit down to table also with them. The master of the house was strangely frightened at this, as were the rest of the company. The soldier knew not what to think of it, being ignorant of the matter in question. But the master of the house being dead the very next day, the soldier inquired what it meant. They told him it was the\n\nbody\n\nof the father of the host,\n\nwho had\n\nbeen dead and buried for ten years, who had thus come to sit down next to him, and had announced and caused his death. “ The soldier informed the regiment of it in the first place, and the regiment gave notice\n\nof\n\nit\n\nto\n\nthe general\n\nofficers,\n\nwho\n\ncommissioned the Count de Cabreras, captain of the regiment of Alandetti infantry,\n\nto\n\nmake information concerning\n\nthis\n\ncir-\n\nHaving gone to the place with some other officers, a surgeon and an cumstance.\n\nauditor, they heard the depositions of all 6\n\n82\n\nVaimpires\n\nand Vampirism\n\nthe people belonging to the house,\n\nwho\n\ndecided unanimously that the ghost was the father of the master of the house, and all the soldier had said and reported was the exact truth, which was confirmed by all the inhabitants of the village.\n\nthat\n\n“ In consequence of this the corpse of\n\nthe spectre was like that of a\n\nexhumed and found\n\nman who had\n\nto be\n\njust expired,\n\nand his blood like that of a living man. The Count de Cabreras had his head cut off and caused him to be laid again in the tomb.\n\nHe\n\nalso took information concerning other\n\nsimilar ghosts\n\n:\n\namong\n\nothers, of a\n\nmore than thirty years\n\nman dead\n\nwho had come back\n\ntimes to his house at meal-time. The first time he had sucked the blood from the neck of his own brother, the second three\n\ntime from one of his sons, and the third time from one of the servants in the house ;\n\nand\n\nall\n\nthree died of\n\nand on deposition the comit\n\ninstantly\n\nUpon this missary had this man taken the spot.\n\nand finding that,\n\nout of\n\nlike the first, his\n\nliis\n\ngrave,\n\nblood was\n\nhke that of a living person, he ordered them to run a large nail into his temple and then to lay him again in in a fluidic state\n\nthe grave.\n\nHungary, “\n\nBavarla.,\n\nand Silesia\n\n83\n\nHe\n\ncaused a third to be burned who had been buried more than sixteen years and had sucked the blood and caused the death of two of his sons. The commissary having made his report to the general officers, was deputed to the Emperor, who commanded that some officers both\n\nwar and of justice, some physicians and surgeons and some learned men should be sent to examine the causes of these extraordinary events. The person who related these particulars to us had heard them from the Count de Cabreras at Fribourg in of\n\n1730.”\n\nRaufft Peter\n\ntells\n\nthe story of a\n\nPlogojowitz,\n\nman named\n\nan inhabitant\n\nof\n\na\n\nHungary called Kisolova, who, after he had been buried more than ten years, appeared by night to several persons in the village, while they were asleep, and squeezed their throats in such a manner village in\n\nthat they expired witliin twenty-four hours. There died in this way no less than nine persons in eight days this Plogojowitz\n\nhad been that his\n\n;\n\nand the widow\n\nof\n\ndeposed that she herself\n\nby him since his death, and errand was to demand his shoes visited\n\n;\n\nwhich frightened her so much that she at\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n84\n\nonce left Kisolova and went to live somewhere else. “ These circumstances determined the inhabitants of the village to dig up the body of Plogojowitz and bum it, in order to put a stop to such troublesome visits. Accordingly they apphed to the commanding officer of the Emperor’s troops in the of Gradisca, in the kingdom of Hungary, and to the incumbent of the place, for leave to dig up the corpse. They both made a great many scruples about granting it but the peasants declared plainly that if they were not permitted to dig up this accursed carcase, which they were fully convinced was a vampire, they w ould be forced to leave the village and settle where they district\n\n;\n\ncould.\n\n“ The officer\n\nwho gave this account, seeing that there was no hindering them either by fair means or foul, came in person, accompanied by the minister of Gradisca, to Kisolova, and they were both present at the digging up of the corpse, which they found to be free from any bad smell, and perfectly sound, as if it had been ahve, except that the tip of the nose was a httle dry and withered. The beard and hair were\n\n;\n\nHungary, Bavaria, and Silesia\n\n85\n\ngrown fresh and a new set of nails had sprung up in the room of the old ones that had fallen Under the former skin, which looked off. pale and dead, there appeared a new one, of a natural fresh colour and the hands and feet were as entire as if they belonged to a person in perfect health. They observed also that the mouth of the vampire was full ;\n\nwhich the people were persuaded had been sucked by him from the persons he had killed. “ The officer and the divine having diligently examined into all the circumstances, the people, being fired with fresh indignation, and growing more fully persuaded of\n\nfresh\n\nblood,\n\nthat this carcase was the real cause of the\n\ndeath of their countrymen, ran immediately to fetch a sharp stake, which being driven\n\nfrom the wound, and also from his nose and mouth, a great quantity of fresh, ruddy blood and something which indicated a sort of fife, was observed to come from him. The peasants then laid the body upon a pile ’’ of wood, and burnt it to ashes. Calmet says he was told by M. de Vassimont, who was sent to Moravia by Leopold, first Duke of Lorraine, that he was ininto\n\nhis\n\nbreast,\n\nthere\n\nissued\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n86\n\nformed by public report that it was common enough in that country to see men who had died some time before present themselves in a party and sit down to the table with persons of their acquaintance without saying anything, but that nodding to one of the party he w^ould infallibly die some days\n\nM. de Vassimont received confirmation of this story from several persons, amongst others an old cure who said he had seen more than one instance of it. The priest added that the inliabitants had been dehvered from these troublesome spectres owing to the fact that their corpses had been taken up and burned or destroyed afterwards.\n\nin\n\nsome w^ay or other. At the beginning of the eighteenth century\n\nseveral\n\nvampire investigations were held\n\nat the instigation of the Bishop of Olmutz. of Liebava was particularly and a Hungarian placed himself on the top of the church tow'er and just before midnight saw^ a well-known vampire issue from his tomb, and, leaving his winding-sheet behind him, proceed on his rounds. The Hungarian descended from the tower and took away the sheet and ascended the tow er again. When the vam-\n\nThe\n\nvillage\n\ninfested,\n\nHungary, Bavaria, and Silesia\n\n87\n\npire returned he flew into a great fury because of the absence of the sheet. The Hungarian called to him to come up to the tower and fetch it. The vampire mounted the ladder, but just before he reached the top the Hungarian gave him a blow on the head which threw him down to the churchyard. His assailant then descended, cut off\n\nthe vampire’s head with a hatchet, and\n\nfrom that time the vampire was no more heard of. In 1672 there dwelt in the market town of ICring, in the Archduchy of Krain, a man named George Grando, who died, and was buried by Father George, a monk of St Paul, who, on returning to the widow’s house, saw Grando sitting behind the door. The monk and the neighbours fled. Soon stories began to circulate of a dark flgure being seen to go about the streets by night, stopping now and then to tap at the door of a house, but never to wait for an answer. In a little while people began to die mysteriously in Kring, and it was noticed that the deaths occurred in the houses at which the spectred flgure had tapped its signal. The widow Grando also complained that she was tormented by the spirit of her husband,\n\nVampires and Vampirism\n\n88\n\nwho\n\nnight after night threw her into a deep\n\nsleep with the object of sucking her blood.\n\nThe Supan,\n\nor chief magistrate, of Kring\n\ndecided to take the usual steps to ascertain whether Grando was a vampire. He called together some of the neighbours, fortified\n\nthem with a liquor,\n\nplentiful supply of spirituous\n\nand they\n\nsallied off\n\nwith torches and\n\na crucifix.\n\nGrando’ s grave was opened, and the body was found to be perfectly sound and not decomposed, the mouth being opened with a pleasant smile, and there was a rosy fiush on the cheeks. The whole party were seized with terror and hurried back to Kring, with the exception of the Supan. The second visit was made in company with a priest, and the party also took a heavy stick of hawthorn sharpened to a The grave and body were found point.

Similar stories to this were continually being circulated from the borders of Hun-\n\ngary to the Baltic.
