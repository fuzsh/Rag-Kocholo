        "text": "BryanIII:\n\nThis map itself is fairly self explanatory so I don't think a backstory is needed, just know the map is from the same universe as my previous map\n\nEDIT: Oh right, the only thing worth mentioning is that Napoleonipolis is OTL Svilengrad who has no greek variant of its name.\n\n2nd EDIT: Someone over on Deviantart wanted some backstory so here it is;\n\nBackground\n\nAt the beginning of 1798, the War of the First Coalition had come to an end and following the Treaty of Campo Formio, where Napoleon Bonaparte decreed the final dissolution of the Venetian Republic, the city of Preveza – like other Venetian possessions in Greece and Albania – was ceded to Revolutionary France. 280 French grenadiers arrived in Preveza under the commands of General La Salchette. The people of Preveza welcomed the French troops, and formed a pro-French civic militia. Around this same time the poet Rigas Feraios was combining support for the ideas of the French Revolution with calls for a Greek uprising against Ottoman rule and arrived in the town to begin rudimentary discussion with French commanders.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte, however, focused his attention in another direction, launching the French Campaign in Egypt and Syria, gave little thought to the fate of the small Preveza garrison exposed on the edge of Ottoman territory. The local Ottoman governor Ali Pasha Tepelena attacked Preveza with an overwhelming force. In the Battle of Nicopolis the 7,000 Ottoman troops of Ali Pasha and his son Mukhtar completely overwhelmed the 280 French grenadiers and their local allies, the 200 Preveza Civil Guards and 60 Souliot warriors under Captain Christakis. Over the next two days, a major massacre of the French troops and the local Greek population which defended the city took place in Preveza; during which Feraios was killed, Christakis and General La Salchette however managed to escape to French Corfu. Napoleon, being on Malta at the time, diverted his fleet towards Corfu. There he met with General La Salchette, Christakis and local Greek leading figures. While French and Ottoman Fleets were facing off in the Ambracian Gulf, the negotiations on Corfu became a secret congress Including several Greek rebel leaders and Russian officials, who saw in Napoleon a potential solution for their Greek Question. In 1799 both France and Russia committed ground troops to the Conflict\n\nFull-blown Conflict\n\nWith the might of the Russian Imperial army crashing down from the Caucasus, the Russian Black Sea Fleet causing havoc in the Black sea and in thinking fighting in the Balkans would be the same old stomping of Greek Rebel Factions, the defence of the Balkans was almost entirely left to Ali Pasha and his son Mukhtar; save for a 6000 strong Army left to protect Athens commanded by Omer Vroni (Its former commander was born in the Caucasus and was therefor ordered to that front to use his knowledge of the land, in doing so took 2000 of the finest troops with him) . Those two had been almost constantly been retreating since the Battle of Ioannina in February of 1799 where they were unprepared to face the French Corfu Garrison (strengthened with Greek Militia), an organized Souliote Army and a full French Army. The situation worsened for the Ottomans when the Ottoman 3rd Army commanded by Omer Vroni was obliterated near Corinthe in April 1799 by an unexpected Maniot Army, who had been slowly moving up and gaining support in the Peloponnese, and a Psarian fleet providing canon fire from the sea. With the way cleared there was nothing stopping them and Athens was liberated on the 19th of April 1799.\n\nAfter the Battle of Monastirion on the 7th of May Ali Pasha’s strategy switched to the defence of Thessaloniki and eventually even the defence of Constantinople and since then avoided large skirmishes. After the Siege of Thessaloniki in July of 1799 had ended Ali Pasha realized that he would in fact have to defend Constantinople and send word to the Sultan in the hope to get more forces sent to the Balkan Campaign. He ordered his son to take half the forces and hold the Verbitza pass and if that would fall to go and hold Adrianople for as long as possible, while he himself positioned his army across the Evros River in hopes that the river would hold of the invaders. On the 3rd of September The British Philhellenic Legion landed on the Gallipoli Peninsula, while just before deposing the Sfakian Army on the Dardanalia coast and slowly they pushed up the coasts.On the 21st of September the Verbitza Pass was taken by the Maniot and Souliot armies who had joined up together. The Siege of Philippopolis ended on the 3rd of October and Napoléon's Main Army moved towards the Evros River to meet up with the joint Maniot-Souliot Army, who had indeed been held back by the Evros River. The same river was no obstacle for Napoléon as he had crossed it a few days before to the north of the battlefield. Realising defeat Ali Pasha retreated when he saw the first French troops flanking his Army from the North. On the 29th of October The French Corfu Garrison finally arrived at Adrianople and began the siege. While retreating, Ali Pasha noticed the joint Greek Armies heading to the North instead of following him, thinking they were being diverted to help with the Siege of Adrianople he made his fatal decision to face the French Army head on to try and weaken it; which was a bad decision because the joint Greek Armies were only liberating Arkadioupolis before meeting back up with the Main French Army.\n\nDon Quijote:\n\nSpain's War until 1943\n\nThe Spanish Campaign in WW2 came about as a result of Franco's decision to join the war on the Axis side after his successful meeting with Hitler at Hendaye in October 1940. With Britain apparently on the back foot, and promises obtained of rich pickings for Spain in Africa (not to mention the long awaited recapture of Gibraltar), Franco committed Spain to war. The declaration of war against Britain came a few months later, in March 1941. Although the Axis had clearly suffered some setbacks, such as the failure to invade Britain, and the mediocre Italian performance in North Africa, the situation broadly seemed to be in their favour.\n\nFirst stop for Axis Spain was of course Gibraltar, and alongside a small force of elite German troops, the Rock was swiftly captured by the Spanish, although the defenders made them pay dearly. The seizure of Malta later that year confirmed Axis domination of the Western and Central Mediterranean, although the diversion of resources meant that the British enjoyed a number of victories in the desert, pushing the Italians (and small German and Spanish contingents) back as far as Tripoli by the end of 1941. The Axis powers certainly benefited from the elimination of Malta as an Allied base, as it made their supply lines rather more secure. On the other hand, the advanced position of British forces meant that Blenheims and Wellingtons from Libya were still able to launch frequent air attacks on enemy ports and shipping.\n\nBy this stage though, Hitler's attention was on the east, where after securing the Balkans and rescuing the Italian invasion of Greece (apart from Crete), he had launched Operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union. Spain sent two divisions to take part in the campaign, the División Azul and the División Primo de Rivera, commanded respectively by Muñoz Grandes and the talented but ruthless Juan Yagüe, a man rather suited to the environment of Eastern Front. After initially being a part of Army Group Centre, they then spent over a year on the Leningrad Front, during which the Spaniards briefly seized part of the besieged city, the only Axis troops to manage this. But although they served, to quote Franco, 'with great valour and fortitude', from late 1942 it was clearly a losing battle, and they would be forced to fall back steadily for the remainder of the war once the long and brutal siege was lifted. No doubt news of events closer to home did not help their morale, and it was also due to the declining situation in Spain itself that both units were withdrawn for Home Defence in 1944.\n\nThe American entry into the war after Pearl Harbor was obviously game-changing, but it would take some time before the effects were fully felt in the European Theatre. However the British and their allies were not idle in this time, and stepped up their air and naval campaigns. Spain was particularly hurt by this, relying heavily as it did on foreign imports. British supplies had naturally been cut off since March, but Britain had a military as well as an economic advantage. British naval strength allowed them to capture the Canary Islands in the successful Operation Pilgrim - this had symbolic significance for Franco, as the birthplace of the military rising of 18th July 1936 which had propelled him to power. Portugal was also shifting closer to the Allies, and while intervention was not currently anticipated, should it occur then Spain would have a real crisis on its hands, and would be obliged to call on Germany for assistance.\n\nIn January 1943, came the news the Axis forces in North Africa had been dreading. Anglo-American troops had landed along the Moroccan and Algerian coasts in Operation Torch, rapidly overcoming Vichy French resistance. This had triggered many French units based further south to throw in their lot with the Allies, and combined with the capture of Tripoli by Gott's Eighth Army a few weeks earlier, it was clear that North Africa was going to fall if the Axis did not heavily reinforce the region. Unfortunately for Germany, commitments on the Eastern Front prevented this, and it was largely left to existing troops to deal with the situation. Spanish Morocco found itself largely cut off from the other Axis troops, and although the experienced soldiers put up a tough fight, inflicting higher than expected casualties, Allied technical and numerical superiority won the day. Once Tunisia had been conquered, the Allies could finally step ashore on European soil again for the first time since 1941.\n\nThe Spanish Campaign 1943-1945\n\nFrom now on the account focuses on the Spanish campaign itself; avoiding detailed coverage of the invasions of Italy and France for the sake of space. By the end of the summer of 1943, preparations were underway for the amphibious assault on southern Spain, which would come under British direction - in return, Italian operations would be largely under American control. Previous landings (which now included those in Malta and Italy) provided helpful practice for this, and so the Spanish landings were accomplished successfully in late September. The US II Corps landed near Malaga, while the British V Corps came ashore south of Cadiz. Progress was initially slow, as the British force struggled to make headway towards the heavily defended port to their north. The Americans took Malaga within ten days, and after securing their beachhead moved southwest to assist their ally. However General Montgomery, commanding Allied forces in Spain, made sure that his men were the first into Gibraltar, proudly raising the Union Jack over the town once again. The capture of Cadiz soon afterwards gave him nearly equal satisfaction, as it had better harbour facilities than Malaga.\n\nA firm foothold now achieved on Iberia, the Allies now had the task of pressing inland and forcing Spain out of the war. However, the Germans were equally determined to keep Spain in the war, and swiftly responded to Franco's request for reinforcements. Partly due to this, and also because Spain was considered of lesser importance than Italy and France, the Anglo-American advance was slow. Seville fell in the New Year, but after that they became bogged down in the hills of rural and underdeveloped Extremadura. The attacks to the east were more successful, and armoured forces managed a dash along the coast in the spring which brought them as far as Alicante. The old city of Granada, a key point in Spain's southern defences, was also cut off and captured. After this came several months of slowly grinding down Axis forces between the Allies and Madrid, with the terrain generally favouring the defenders. A spot of hope was the Allied advance from France, where the landings in Normandy had led to a swift advance southwards. This was complemented by a smaller, but only lightly opposed, landing in southern France, and when these troops linked up, a reasonable proportion were then ordered to turn their attention to Spain. With the help of anti-Francoist Basque partisans, San Sebastian became the first Spanish city to be freed from the north.\n\nNovember 1944 brought more successes - Bilbao, Valencia and Spain's second city of Barcelona all fell. So did Mallorca and Ibiza, after an assault to eliminate the Spanish naval base there, from which irritating if not damaging raids had been launched. Menorca was left to wither away, posing less of a threat. Equally significant was the entry of Portugal into the war in the previous month. After long negotiations with President Salazar, who had already provided the Azores for use as Allied air bases, an agreement was reached. Portugal would join the Allies in return for being granted the city of Tangiers and not insubstantial financial investments. The most immediate effect was the fall of Badajoz, which after resisting the Allies for several months, suddenly had to deal with an attack from the rear. Portuguese troops also moved into Galicia, an area which until now had been securely under Nationalist control, and also contained their last remaining seaports. The last event of note in 1944 was the fall of historic Salamanca, scene of a famous battle in the last century's Peninsular War. But as 1945 opened, it seemed that this Iberian conflict would be ended rather more quickly.\n\nAllied troops in the north had been held up for some time in the mountains of the Sistema Iberico, but were making up for this by their progress either side of this obstacle. A linkup was achieved with troops from the south on the east coast in January, while to the west Allied columns pushed towards Portuguese lines. Yet the most important action was taking place in the south. After tortuous months of fighting, the Americans achieved a breakthrough on their way northwest from Valencia, and raced for the Spanish capital. To add to Franco's despair, the British captured Toledo in February, the gateway to Madrid from the south. Very quickly, Madrid was surrounded, as were two other major pockets, cut off from the bulk of Spanish forces in Galicia and Asturias. The Battle of Madrid was as fierce as would be expected, reminiscent of the Nationalist attempts to seize the city back in 1936. However by this stage, the Spanish resistance was out in the open, helping in the final push to remove the short-lived Fascist regime. Franco, to his credit, also took to the streets and was killed in the futile defence of his residence at El Pardo. On 19th March, a ceasefire was declared in Madrid, prior to a formal surrender of all remaining Spanish forces the following day. Field Marshal Montgomery signed on behalf of the Allies, while General Muñoz Grandes signed on behalf of Spain. After a year and a half of bloody fighting, the battle for Spain was over.\n\nMoralistic Communist:\n\n4th Confederate War\n\nThe War of Confederate Communist Supremacy\n\nEver since the start of the Confederate Wars in 1983 with the succession of Texas from the Confederacy the Southeast of North America has been ravaged by constant turmoil. When the communist revolutions started in 1985, various states of the Confederacy started falling to the red tide one by one. And while the wars appeared to be over once an international ceasefire was signed at the London Conference of 1992, in reality the next war was already brewing under the surface.\n\nThis war would be a geopolitical one, between puppets of the USSR and puppets of the PRC. Throughout most of the former Confederacy, militias funded by the Soviets formed the majority of the rebel forces, except for those states dominated by the Black Panther Party. The Black Panther Party, lead by Dr. Huey Newton, an African-American who grew up in rural Louisiana, had its own revolutionary doctrine which focused on the establishment of a black nationalist state. While the USSR was fine to let the Black Panthers establish their own states, everything changed in 1997. In that year, when Huey Newton unveiled his second 5-year plan, the world was shocked to read how it included the expulsion of all non-blacks from the four states under his control. Once the population had been purged of \"imperialist whites\" the states would combine into the United Negro Republic to provide a new homeland for the African-American population of North America.\n\nThe USSR, stunned by these racist and anti-white policies immediately cut off all diplomatic ties with the Black Panther states, with the Atlanta Pact following suit shortly afterwards. Having made enemies with the Soviet Union, the Black Panthers turned to the East and began negotiations with the People's Republic of China. In return for exclusive rights to the vast oil supplies located off the coast of the Bayou, Zhang Chunqiao agreed to send medicine, arms, and other manufactured goods to the Black Panther states. This realignment of the states to the Maoist PRC was unacceptable for the USSR, and thus secret preparations for a massive invasion of the Black Panther states began.\n\nIn March of 1998 these plans were put into action as the Atlanta Pact launched a surprise attack on all four Black Panther states at once. Shaken by how quickly the Atlanta Pact had prepared an invasion, Huey Newton decided to rush his own plans and announced the creation of the United Negro Republic, hoping to inspire mass revolts of all the African Americans in Atlanta Pact states. However such a revolt never occurred, and with the Soviet aligned states of Venezuela and Brazil sending in \"peacekeeping ships\" off the coasts of the United Negro Republic Huey Newton's dream looked as though it was to meet an abrupt end. In a last ditch effort, the PRC proposed a motion to the UN Security Council to announce an immediate cessation of hostilities in the former Confederate States, citing the Atlanta Pact invasion as a violation of the London Conference. However this motion was vetoed by the USSR, and the world could do nothing as Arkansawyer tanks rolled down the streets of New Orleans. By April of 1999, all major cities of the United Negro Republic had been captured by Atlanta Pact troops, though large swathes of the countryside remained pockets of rebellion. These guerrilla fighters continued high level attacks on Atlanta Pact forces until December 13th, 1999, when Huey Newton was dragged out of his bunker in the Yazoo river delta.\n\nBy the time of Huey Newton's capture over 31,000 people had been killed, with the majority of them being civilians. On Christmas Day a show trial was held to convict Huey Newton of crimes against humanity, and on January 1st, 2000 he was executed by firing squad to symbolize the start of the a new millenia and a new century, a Soviet century.\n\nFor the full sized version of the map, check out my DeviantArt."
