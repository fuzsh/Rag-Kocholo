        "text": "Kalonyktis (ÎÎ±Î»Î¿Î½ÏÎºÏÎ·Ï ) Rethymno\n\nKalonyktis (until 1940 Kalonychti) [1] or Kal (l) onychtis or Kallonychtis or Kalonykti (general Kalonykti or Kalonyktou) is a village in the former province of Rethymno (Rethymno) and especially in its western part, more commonly known as West Rethymnon. It is located 15 km southwest of Rethymno, with access from Rethymno via the old national road Rethymno - Chania (E090) [2], with a left branch in Agiasmatsi (Agia Kyriaki), at 13.4 km and through the provincial road 6 Kalonychti- Saitoures (Agiasmatsiou - Kalonakti - Palelimnou - Saitouron) [3]. It is 15 km from Rethymno. [4] It is built [5] on Nikiforos hill (altitude 273 meters). The main products of the area are oil, raki, wine, avocado, locusts [6] and livestock. It has an area of ââ2.9 square kilometers.\n\nAbout the name of the village\n\nAccording to tradition, the coma, but indirectly the former Municipality of Nikiforos Fokas and now the Municipal Unit of Nikiforos Fokas, owe their name to the following incident: when Nikiforos Fokas campaigned in Crete in March 961 AD, in order to to liberate it from the Arab Saracens, he encamped one night on the above hill, which he had previously liberated together with the adjacent hill \"Dambies\", after a battle. When dawn broke, someone asked him, \"How did you spend your night?\" He replied, \"Good night!\" Thus, the village was named \"Kalonyktis\" and the hill and the location, where the Byzantine general and later emperor encamped, was named \"Nikiforos\". Nikiforos Fokas is considered the founder of the village and there is a road in the village in his honor. However, there is also the opinion that the village pre-existed and was called Leventochori.\n\nSpatial planning data\n\ncarte moderne d'une partie de la CrÃ¨te avec un itinÃ©raire indiquÃ© en rouge\n\nFrench road map of Mustafa Pasha from Apokoronas to Arkadi in 1866, depicting the pre-1925 before the old national road Chania-Rethymno engraving through Rusticas and Kalonyktis\n\nAdministrative Inclusion until September 1925: The first reference to the village is made in the Venetian period. In 1651 it belonged to Livas of Rethymno and Nahiyye of Rethymno as a shareholder. [7] In 1879 he joined the municipality of Roustikon, in 1901 the enlarged municipality of Atsipopoulou [8] and in 1903 he returned to the reconstituted municipality of Roustikon. In 1911 it was included in the rural municipality of Palelimnos [9] and on 19/12/1920 in its census in the rural municipality of Palelimnos, the Metochi Monastery of Profitos Ilios [10] with 3 monks and Mylos with 6 inhabitants have joined. With the Official Gazette 27A of January 31, 1925, it was annexed to the community of Rustika together with the Metochion of the Monastery of the Prophet of the Sun and the Mill.\n\nCommunity history: With the Government Gazette 260A of September 21, 1925 [11], it was detached from the community of Rusticon and became the seat of the community, to which the villages of Palailimnos and Saitoures were annexed.

With the Government Gazette 244A - 04/12/1997 the community of Kalonyktos of the province of Rethymno was abolished and joined the Kapodistrian Municipality of Nikiforos Fokas [13] (code of the Kapodistrian organization OPS 40141008) [14] as a municipal district / 06/2010 in the Municipality of Rethymno (code of the Kallikratikos body OPS 40141145) [14], as a municipal district and local community of Kalonyktos [16] of the municipal unit of Nikiforos Fokas. It could be the historical seat of the former municipality of Nikiforos Fokas, given that the name of the municipality comes from the presence of the Byzantine general in the village in 961 AD. It is one of the nine villages of Kampanos along with the villages of Agios Andreas (and a village of Kampos such as Gonia and Franzeskiana Metochia [17]), Palaimilnos, Saitoures, Moundros, Roustika and Agios Konstantinos.
