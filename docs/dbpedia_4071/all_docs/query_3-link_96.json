        "text": "Variety is the spice of life on the largest Greek island. Crete, home of the Minotaur legend and birthplace of Europe’s first evolved society, is a vivid and sensual mosaic of contrasts: from lofty mountains and pink-sand beaches, to buzzing nightlife and traditional kafeneions (coffeehouses). Standing at the crossroads of three continents, the atoll described by Homer in his Odyssey as ‘a fair land ... in the midst of the wine-dark sea’ has been invaded countless times over the centuries. The traces of successive invasions can be found in Turkish bathhouses, Venetian fortresses, and Byzantine architecture.\n\nHowever, Cretans refuse to dwell on the past: any and every occasion is an excuse for a glendi (party), usually revolving round food: home-grown vegetables, locally produced olive oil, fat snails gleaned in the mountains, or raki brewed in the local still. And (as any Greek will proudly tell you) Crete is the country’s most hospitable island, so you can expect plenty of invitations to join in the fun.\n\nExplore our interactive map below for all the local highlights, and scroll down for our suggested day-by-day summary of the best things to see and do. For further Crete inspiration, see our guides to the island's best hotels, restaurants, nightlife, beaches and things to do. For further inspiration plan the perfect Greek island-hopping holiday with our itinerary.\n\nYou’ll need a car to explore Greece’s largest island. There are dozens of car rental kiosks at Heraklion Airport, so you might want to wait until you arrive to book a car – though advance booking is essential during the high season (from late June to early September). On arrival, bargain hard: expect to pay €15-€30 (£13-£26) per day, or less if you plan to keep the car for more than three days.\n\nStart (early) in the superb Heraklion Museum in the island’s capital, where jaw-dropping archaeological wonders include the intricate Malia bee pendant, Kamares tableware, and those legendary Minoan frescoes.\n\nSip an ice cool frappé in the museum’s café, then take the rutted road inland through silver-leaved olive groves to Knossos Palace. To get the best value from your visit, buy a combi museum/palace ticket, which costs €15 (£13) – and it’s also well worth paying extra for a guided tour of this sprawling site. For €8 (£7) you'll get in-depth information about the life and times of Crete's Minoan civilisation, along with a host of fascinating anecdotes that really bring the visit to life. It was the seat of mythical King Minos (and the bloodcurdling minotaur), and where archaeologist Arthur Evans carried out his controversial – but evocative – restoration work.\n\nA small road, looping through tousled vineyards that produce some of the island’s best wine, leads to the traditional village of Archanes. Sit at a tree-shaded table of gourmet restaurant Kritamon and order the maggiri – fresh pasta served in a meaty broth, dotted with white anthotyros cheese. For more suggestions of the best things to do in the area, see our guide.\n\nBack on the coast, take the old National road to Agios Nikolaos (traffic melts away as you head for the island’s less crowded eastern side). If you have kids it’s well-worth stopping off en route to visit the CretAquarium, a vast marine-themed space with 60 different tanks and its own thrilling shark tunnel. The shop-lined streets of Lasithi’s capital Agios Nikolaos descend to Voulismeni, a circular lake surrounded by taverns where legend says the Goddess Athena once bathed.\n\nFrom here it’s a short drive to Elounda, where boats leave for Spinalonga – the leper island which featured in Victoria Hislop’s bumper-selling novel, The Island. After the sombre trip, raise your spirits with dinner at The Ferryman – a gastro tavern overlooking Elounda’s glittering bay. You'll love the crusty home-baked carob bread, baked lamb, and fluffy feta-flavoured aubergine scones – all sprinkled with sea salt gathered from the local shoreline. For more suggestions of the best beaches in the area, see our guide.\n\nBack in Heraklion, the bars will be buzzing. Follow hip Herakliotes to Stone Project – a stylish, low-lit bar with friendly service, which serves some of the city’s best raki-based cocktails. Try the bitter-sweet Mediterranean Manhattan, made with raki, Vermouth and orange bitters.\n\nFor a real dose of local lifestyle, end your evening at warehouse-style music venue Nyn Kai Aei, where Cretan music stars come to strum and improvise their rhyming mantinades folk songs. For more suggestions of the best nightlife in the area, see our guide.\n\nContinue along the coast, past the pretty coastal town of Giorgioupoli (nature lovers should make a detour to see rare striped terrapins bobbing on Kournas lake). Then, venture up the breathtaking – and occasionally terrifying – panoramic mountain road to Hora Sfakion. Hop on a boat to Agia Roumeli and hike through the bottom end of Samaria Gorge: check timetables, but in high season the last boat usually returns from Agia Roumeli around 7pm.\n\nCretan shops stay open until 10pm in summer: head for Chania and enjoy a late afternoon stroll in the city’s intricate network of shopping streets behind the Venetian harbour.\n\nFor more exotic victuals, choose The Well of the Turk in Chania’s Splantzia district. Here you can sit outside at a table surrounded by pots of bright-coloured geraniums and lemon-scented basil, watching crowds mill around the 13th-century Irini church opposite. The food is fantastic: think crunchy pitas stuffed with red pepper and tomato, lahmajoun (a sort of Turkish pizza flatbread) topped with minced beef or lamb, and other Middle Eastern specialties.\n\nDance off those calories on the sands of nearby Platanias beach: built around a large pool (ideal for cooling off), Mylos Club is one of the island’s hippest dance venues. The vibe is casual but sophisticated, with guest DJs flown in for their sets during the summer months.\n\nTemperatures are balmy all year round along Crete’s extensive coastline – although it will often rain from January to March, and sometimes there will be a few days of snow. Weather up in the mountains is colder: expect chilly weather from late December to early April. Conversely, in summer when temperatures along the coast climb to 30-35C, the mountain villages – which are often five degrees cooler – are ideal for escaping the heat.\n\nSea temperatures start to rise in late April and May, and you can often still swim in November. The island is crowded during July and August when Cretans from overseas come ‘home’ for the summer, but in late spring and early autumn the beaches and attractions are generally far less crowded – especially in the east of the island."
