Blog Entry.\n\nText (lsereviewofbooks-2022-02-25-book-review-tradition-in-the-frame) - Published Version\n\nDownload (220kB)\n\nhttps://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks...\n\nAbstract\n\nIn Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete, Konstantinos Kalantzis explores the experiences of Sfakians in Crete to reflect on how tradition is made meaningful today and what this can tell us about the dynamics of localisation, globalisation, modernity and belonging in our contemporary world. This is a rich and enjoyable read that will be of interest to scholars and students looking for new, generative approaches to visual culture at the intersection of the local and the global, writes Kristina Gedgaudaitė.
