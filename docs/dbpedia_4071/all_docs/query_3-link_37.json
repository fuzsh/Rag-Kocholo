        "text": "Dear valued customer,\n\nIn the page below you will find some useful information about what to do and where to go in Western Crete and Central. We have tried to give information about the surroundings of the Hotel and some tips of things to do outside the traditional touristic paths. This page constitutes the start point of your query about Crete. There are far more information available on the Web, so please do not hesitate to look around. Finally, once lodged with us, our help desk will be able to guide you through more specific information you may require. Â\n\nAbout Crete\n\nCrete, the 5th biggest Mediterranean Island, lies in the southern frontier of Europe. The proud and hospitable Cretan people are famous for there culture, innovative spirit and nutritional habits. Crete combines mountains and sea, the new alongside with the old and ancient with contemporary history. It is a cultural crossroad due to its strategic geographical position. The island is one of the most popular tourism destinations.\n\nAbout Rethymnon\n\nRethymnon is located in central Crete and lies between the towns of Chania and Heraklion. It is considered to be the third largest city of Crete and portrays itself as a quaint region with delightful medieval architecture. The harbour front is the busiest neighborhood of the town. Rethymnon has been developed a lot over the years by the tourism industry to provide travelers and guests with various important amenities. Historically, the earliest settlers of the region belonged to the Minoan period. The region enjoyed a sovereign status to such an extent that it had its own coinage.\n\nOld Town\n\nA joy to explore on foot, the cobbled streets of Rethymnon’s car-free old town, takes you back through the centuries. Laid out on a grid system, the mix of architectural styles reflects the town's history, so you'll see attractions such as the 16th-century Venetian loggia, the 17th century Rimondi Fountain with water gushing from the mouths of three stone lions, a towering Ottoman minaret from 1890, a smattering of contemporary graffiti, and modern day cafÃ©s and restaurants full of students. Sometimes styles are combined - lovely pastel-colored Venetian-era town houses have wooden balconies added by the Turks. Today, the most touristic area is the old harbor, rimmed with seafood restaurants, which is especially enchanting in the evening.\n\nFortezza\n\nBy the 16th century, the Ottoman Turks were fast advancing into Europe. Between 1573 and 1580, the Venetians built this enormous fortress, completed with sturdy bastions, to protect the island against Turkish invasion and also as a place where locals could take shelter, should the Turks take the town. Perched atop Paleokastro hill, immediately west of the old harbor, it affords marvelous views over RÃ©thymnon's old town and out to sea. On the highest point, note the mosque, originally a church, but converted into an Islamic place of worship by the Turks when they eventually conquered the town in 1646. There's also a small open-air theater, which hosts concerts in summer.\n\nArkadi Monastery\n\nThe Orthodox Church played an important role in liberating Greece from Turkish occupation. Set amid the rural foothills of Psiloritis (Mount Idi), 23 kilometers southeast of RÃ©thymnon, this fortress-like 16th-century monastery is surrounded by high stone walls. Today, it's a wonderfully peaceful place, with a delightful Baroque church and a rose garden, but it has not always been so. In 1866, the monastery became the central meeting place for Cretan revolutionaries, with the Abbot as chairman. During an uprising against the Turks, some 900 locals (mainly women and children), who had taken refuge here, chose to blow themselves up rather than surrender. Outside the monastery, their skulls are displayed in glass cabinets, as a haunting monument to their bravery.\n\nArgyroupoli\n\nArgiroupoli is the site of the ancient city of Lapa. According to the myths, Lapa was created by Agamemnon, the hero of the Trojan war. The older coins of the city show the goddess Vritomartis Artemis, who was a Cretan goddess influenced by the Minoan religion.\n\nThe village is lying 27 kilometres southwest of RÃ©thymnon and is especially cool and fresh in summer time due to countless small waterfalls rising from underground springs. Nestled amid lush greenery and trees, Argyroupoli has a rich history dating back to Roman times - it was also much loved by the Venetians, and later became the center of Cretan resistance against the Turks. Today, it is particularly known for its excellent taverns specialising in roast lamb, with open air dining on stone terraces under the trees and close to the waterfalls.\n\nPreveli Monastery\n\nOn Crete's isolated south coast, built into a remote hillside overlooking the Libyan Sea, Preveli Monastery lies 36 kilometers south of RÃ©thymnon and is only accessible via a winding road through the mountains. Dating from the 17th-century, the monastery features a church and a small museum displaying icons and ecclesiastical paraphernalia. Outside stands a Memorial for Peace and Resistance, erected in 2002. During the Battle of Crete, in 1941, the monks at Preveli gave supplies and shelter to the Allies. The monument is composed of a large headstone, with an unusual statue of a priest (holding a machine gun) and a soldier (one of the Allies) standing to each side. From here you have absolutely stunning views down onto the sea.\n\nPreveli beach\n\nSome of Crete's most beautiful beaches are on the remote south coast extending to the Libyan Sea. Hidden away below Preveli Monastery, this fine pebble beach lies at the delta of a river and is backed by a lush palm grove. If you walk up the gorge, through the palms, you'll find a small waterfall. The beach itself is quite difficult to reach, with a narrow, rocky path leading along the coast from the car park and then a long flight of steps. A small taverna on the beach sells snacks and rents sunbeds. The palms were seriously damaged by fire in 2010, but have naturally regenerated since.\n\nPsiloritis Mountain\n\nRising 2,456 meters, Psiloritis (also known as Mount Idi) is the highest mountain on Crete and the second highest in Greece, after Olympus. The mountain was sacred to the ancients - the king of gods, Zeus, was supposedly born here. Various adventure sports agencies arrange one-day tours from RÃ©thymnon and Heraklion. Most take you to a decent starting point and then begin a hike through the dramatic, rocky landscape, following a clearly marked path to the summit, which is crowned by the Chapel of the Holy Cross. It normally takes three or four hours to reach the top, and you'll need to be reasonably fit, wear good walking boots, and bring plenty of water. The view from the summit is breathtaking - it overlooks the entire island as well as both the north and south coasts.\n\nIdeon Andron\n\nThe Ideon Andron cave is situated on the Nida plateau of Mount Psiloritis, 24 km from the village of Anogeia and 78 km from the town of Rethymnon. Initially its extraordinary large entrance impresses visitors to the Ideon Andron, which is at a height of 1538 m with a vast central hall and a gallery of 22 m in length.\n\nIn antiquity it was a place of worship, because it was believed to be the cave where the goddess Rhea hid the infant Zeus, in order to protect him from his father Cronus. According to a variant of this legend, the Kouretes, a band of mythical warriors, undertook to dance their wild, noisy war dances in front of the cave, so that the clamour would keep Cronus from hearing the infant's crying. Excavations there have unearthed votive offerings, including a well preserved bronze shield, spears and gold and ivory figures. These findings are currently displayed at the Heraklion Archaeological Museum.\n\nAnogeia\n\nThe church of Saint John seems to be the first building of the settlement, which later came to be known as “Anogeia”. Within the temple of Saint John are remains of Byzantine drawings on the walls, which can be dated back to the 11th century.\n\nThe holm - oak tree wood should be visited, which is found near the church of Agios Yakinthos, the protector of the lovers; the church is situated at a distance of 18 km far from Anogeia at the South (at the mid-way to the Nida plateau) and it is a beautiful dry stone building. One of the most interesting buildings of the area are the \"Mitata\", dry stone vaulted constructions used by the stock farmers as provisional dwellings and as places of storage of the local cheese, left there to mature.\n\nIf you feel like it during your visit to Anogeia, stop and have a meal at our friend “Gagaris Restaurant” which will serve you the best of Cretan cuisine. The help desk will give you all information needed.\n\nZoniana - Sfentoni Cave\n\nZoniana Village is located at Psiloritis (Idi mountain) at an altitude of 630 meters and close to the famous Anogeia. At the entrance to the village is the cave “Sfentoni”. Displays 14 halls, richly ornamented with stalactites and stalagmites. Sfentoni Cave is considered as one of the five best preserved caves in Greece, with rare natural beauty and numerous stalactites and stalagmites. It is 550 m long and covers a total of 3,330 sq.m. During recent years archaeological research has uncovered installations dating back to the Neolithic period in the interior of the cave. The entrance to the cave is allowed with the escort of a guide only.\n\nSkinakas Observatory\n\nThe favourable climatological conditions prevailing in Crete (large number of clear-sky nights per year) combined with the high mountains, place the island of Crete among the best locations in Europe for high quality astronomical observations. The Skinakas Observatory has been built and operates as part of scientific research collaboration between the University of Crete, the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH) and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik of Germany. The site of the Observatory, chosen on scientific and functional grounds, is the Skinakas summit of Mount Idi (Psiloritis), at an altitude of 1750 m and 60 km from Heraklion.\n\nSkinakas Observatory offers a number of open days each year in order to make the general public familiar with recent advances in science and technology, depending on the weather conditions.\n\nOther places of interest:\n\nKournas\n\nThe village of Kournas is 43km from Chania and 20km from RÃ©thymnon on a road turning south at 41km of the Chania - RÃ©thymnon highway. Kournas Lake, old villages, Byzantine churches, a Minoan tomb and a cave are in the area around the village. The old village of Kournas maintains aspects of traditional Cretan village architecture and there are several Byzantine churches. A few kilometers from the lake of Kournas, the village is nowadays a favourite place for traditional local cuisine, especially in the winter. Lake Kournas is one of only two lakes in Crete and covers a total area of about 160,000 square metres with a depth of up to 25 metres. A strip of white sand beside the lake provides an area for swimming and cafes.\n\nSouda islet\n\nSouda is an islet in Souda Bay on the northwest coast of Crete at the entrance of the bay of Souda. In ancient times this islet was one of two islets that were referred to as Leukai. The second islet is known today as Leon. On top of the islet there is the monastery of St. Nicolas which has been fortified and renamed to \"Souda\" after the gulf. The old monastery of Agios Nikolaos is still surviving. Musical contest between the Sirens & the Muses. In ancient times, the two islands were called Lefkai (White), as their name came from an ancient Greek myth in which it is said that the Sirens were defeated by the Muses in a music game out of their anguish their feathers fell from their shoulders, got white and remained in to sea and the islands were shaped\n\nLefka Ori (White Mountain)\n\nThe Lefka Ori (White Mountain) rise behind Chania and drop to the Libyan Sea in Sfakia. Surround the plateau with the high peaks of Kastro on the west, Tripali on the east and Agathes giving it the appearance of an amphitheatre. The plateau of Askifou was probably a lake in prehistoric times and the fertile patchwork fields yield wheat and potatoes. On this plateau in 1821 there was a major battle between the Turks and the Sfakiani revolutionaries that resulted in a victory for the locals. The fierceness of the battle and the heroic fighters are still remembered in local songs.\n\nBotanical Park of Crete\n\nA green oasis of 20 hectares between Chania and RÃ©thymnon, containing all kinds of herbs and fruits tree from Crete, the Mediterranean and tropical countries. The Botanical Park of Crete offers you the opportunity to walk in the countryside, relax, admire the plants and animals, and learn about them and their way of life. If your stroll has given you an appetite, the restaurant awaits, with Cretan dishes cooked in the wood oven or in other old, traditional ways which bring out the flavours of the pure products of our land.\n\nDuring the summer months, the best time to schedule your visit is early in the morning, avoiding the strong heat and having the opportunity to complete your experience with an excellent meal in the park’s restaurant. Its totally local, organic and seasonal philosophy will be unforgettable.\n\nCretaquarium\n\nThis is where the experience exploring the Mediterranean Sea world begins. There are one hundred observation points for visitors to admire approximately 2,500 Mediterranean and tropical organisms. A full tour taking in all exhibits and species lasts about 2 hours. The Cretaquarium building complex is situated in the grounds of the former American Base at Gournes, 14 km from the city of Heraklion and Nikos Kazantzakis International Airport. It lies 20km from the Minoan palace of Knossos\n\nGlassmaker:\n\nKokkino Horio Apokoronou Chania, Tel: +30 28250 31194\n\nFestivals and cultural events of RÃ©thymnon\n\nRÃ©thymnon is a city with long history.
