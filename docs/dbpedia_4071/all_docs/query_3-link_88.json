        "text": "Most importantly, I discovered love in a new form. Big love. A love that is in, and out, and connects us all. A quiet shouting stillness drumming golden lights of silence.\n\nI was moved, and I moved.\n\nBritain. South of Crete. Serbia. South of Mexico. Britain. Serbia. Britain. South of Crete. Serbia…\n\nDe-cluttered my space. Than got rid of it. Cried.\n\nRented a 50 ft² storage and carried loads of boxes up and down.\n\nAsked for – and gratefully accepted – help from my friends, when offered. Learned not to expect it. Tried to give it whenever I could.\n\nCrossed more than 40.000 km or 24.854 miles.\n\nVisited 22 places on two continents and slept in 33 rooms.\n\nChecked-in at 10 airports.\n\nSpent 5 months at the seaside. And a few days in the mountains. Could have done better with the mountains.\n\nMet new friends. And some old friends.\n\nMet strangers who knew me from the beginning of the world.\n\nSpent some time with my parents.\n\nAte loads of dark chocolate and sunshine — probably more than 3kg of chocolate in one year and more than 250 sunny days!\n\nAlso ate loads of avocados, tomatoes, rice, lentils and nopales. And many other yummy things. Drank lots of coconut, lime and lemon water. Had several gorgeous tejates, and tried some raki and mezcal too.\n\nDidn’t eat enough of Sfakian Pie. But had some amazing vegan ice-creams and cakes.\n\nDanced salsa, body wave, belly dance, pentozalis and sousta.\n\nSang bajans and karaoke.\n\nLearned to face my fears and dared to touch them.\n\nSwam in two oceans, one sea and two lakes.\n\nDived into water with my eyes open. Finally.\n\nHugged a lot. Walked barefooted.\n\nSet for ten days in a silent meditation. Ten days with no electronic devices, no talking and no mirrors! A total plug-in to everything that really matters. This was crucial.\n\nStarted sleeping well again and waking up without the alarm.\n\nFell in love with my mornings. And evenings. And mid-days. And myself.\n\nPracticed Hatha Yoga. Loads of it. Wherever I could and whenever I could. With wonderful teachers and on my own.\n\nCompleted a course on Yoga Philosophy, and several amazing Yoga workshops.\n\nContinued using homeopathy. Wish I could start studying it too.\n\nWatched sunrise and sunset, and waves and calm waters, again and again.\n\nWalked a lot. A LOT. Did some hiking too.\n\nTraveled in small boats. Met sea turtles, dolphins and whales.\n\nHad two iguanas and one cockroach as my friendly neighbours, along with my lovely human neighbours.\n\nWrote daily notes in my diary and took loads of photos.\n\nWrote and submitted an abstract for a conference paper, on the space of access and Bourdieu. The stuff good enough to be accepted with an invitation for oral presentation at an international conference. But I forgot one thing. I was not working anymore, so there was no funding for me to go and present it. So I declined my participation and worked as a karma yogi instead (cleaning work included).\n\nStarted learning Spanish, and a little bit of Greek.\n\nListened to more Rumi’s poems than ever in my life.\n\nSpent all my money, and happily survived.\n\nHealed a wound. Learned to love my scars.\n\nFelt again so small and so safe.\n\nRemembered how not to rush and how to smile often.\n\nStarted to see beauty everywhere. Particularly in people’s eyes. Whole universe in each.\n\nStarted writing this blog and publishing photos.\n\n[to be continued, maybe…]"
