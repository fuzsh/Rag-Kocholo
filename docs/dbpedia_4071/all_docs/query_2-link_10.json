        "meta_description": "The Sfakians are the tallest of all Greeks according to Coon, and potentially the fairest as well.  They have long been held to be an Dorian enclave.  Their bravery and unique customs have made them the subject of much interest in 19th century ethnologues and among hellenophiles and travelers from around the world.  Some have likened them to the highlanders of Montenegro, who have been posited to be largely of Paleo-Balkan origin. \n \nhttp://www.explorecrete.com/crete-west/images/man-crete.jpg",
