Carnival celebrations reach their peak on the last weekend of the three, right before ‘Kathara Deftera’ (Clean Monday), or the first day of Lent.\n\nOn Crete, many towns and villages hold Carnival festivals, but for the ultimate Cretan Carnival, head to the biggest one, in Rethymnon.\n\nRethymnon city holds the biggest Carnival festival on Crete, and one of the most famous in Greece.

On the same day, housewives dye the Easter red eggs. Men gather wood to prepare the place that they will burn an effigy of Judas, while women offer their old clothes and they dress Judas up. Easter in Chania is no doubt a time of family, traditions and customs with so much to enjoy and see. Below is a list of just some of the things to enjoy during the easter week in Chania:\n\n5 things you should do in Chania\n\n1.Visit Chrysopigi Monastery, 3 km away from the city.

With cooler temperatures compared to summer, you’ll find that longer hikes and sightseeing outings are quite doable.\n\nAs spring isn’t part of Crete’s high season, you’ll get the added perks of fewer tourists and lower rates. Most travelers won’t flock to Crete until their summer holiday, so you’ll be surrounded mostly by locals. Similarly, airfare and hotels are likely to be more affordable, as there’s less of a demand during the spring months.\n\nFrom a wide range of activities to take part in including nature hikes through beautiful mountainous terrains, visiting the old venetian harbor for a stroll, or even discovering virgin beaches before the hordes of tourists – there is something for everyone in Chania during the spring.\n\n*https://www.gojourny.com/stories/journy-concierge-107/the-journy-guide-to-crete-in-spring\n\n6 beaches in Chania you must not miss!\n\nDuring your stay in Chania, it is a given that you will visit heavenly beaches with turquoise waters in spectacular landscapes of unique beauty.\n\nWe have gathered 6 of the top beaches of Chania that you should not miss during your stay:\n\n1.

Gramvousa Beach\n\nGramvousa is a small island of Chania on the northwest coast. Although not inhabited, it has an impressive fortress, built at the highest point, while just below it, a lovely beach lures its visitors: All-white sand and deep blue waters, and an old shipwreck, a rusty ship’s bunker, make up the stunning scenery. The beach is accessible by boat which sail from Kissamos.\n\n3. Seitan Limania\n\nAnother one of the most impressive landscapes of Chania.

You will arrive at Seitan Limania from the village of Hordaki, following the asphalt road to its end, and then you will continue the rough but short path that goes down to the coast.\n\n4. Lake Kourna beach\n\nThe only natural lake of Chania is not only impressive due to the natural beauty of the landscape but also because during summer a sandy beach is formed on its shore that allows swimming in its fresh waters! One can rent umbrellas and a bicycle to make a pleasant round of Lake Kournas, in the green mountains of Apokoronas.\n\n5. Elafonisi\n\nA small sandy island, connected to the opposite shore by a sandy peninsula … and in between an impressive, deep blue shallow lagoon! The landscape is unparalleled in beauty and classifies Elafonissi among the best beaches not only of Chania, but of Greece, the Mediterranean, and even the world! Elafonissi is located 76 kilometers southwest of Chania and five kilometers south of Chrysoskalitissa Monastery, at the southwest end of Crete and is part of the Natura Protected Areas.\n\n6. Balos\n\nOne of the most impressive landscapes of Chania, Balos is a massive rock in the sea, “connected” to the opposite coast with a shallow lagoon where the sand forms impressive designs. The shallow waters in the lagoon of Balos are either blue or turquoise. Everywhere there are small shells that in many places make the sand look pink, while the scattered rocks give a special touch to the scenery.\n\nBalos is located in the northwest part of the province of Chania, at the Cape of Gramvousa, 17 kilometers from Kissamos. There are two ways to approach it, one by boat from Kissamos, and the other by road.

The festive period then lasts 12 days: Dec. 25 to 05 January, the day before the “Foton” (Epiphany).

A favorite of the locals on windy days.\n\nMarathi beach is located in the southeastern part of the peninsula of Akrotiri in Chania, Crete, 16 km from the city of Chania. It is a beach with crystal-clear sea’s and two wave less beaches. Dotted along the beach in shack style are taverns and cafes by the sea, over viewing to the coasts and the mountains across the bay of Souda. The most important advantage with the beach in Marathi, is that you'll almost never see waves even when it blows in western Crete thus making it an ideal beach for families with children.\n\nEnjoy the sea and sand all day long and pop over for a bite to eat when you get hungry at lunch time to try the local Cretan delicacies and fresh fish at one of the taverns beside the beach.\n\nA Hidden Gem\n\nThere is so much to explore in Chania, that one trip could never be enough. We do however have our best spots on the island and the quaint fishing village of Loutro is certainly one of them!\n\nThe seaside village of Loutro is located at a distance of about 71 km. south of Chania, at the end of Cape Mouri. It is believed that this was the site of the ancient city of Finikas, and was the port of ancient Anopolis. Later, it became the winter time port of the town of Sfakia, due to the fact that the enclosed bay and the small island in its entrance create a natural harbor where ships can be safe even at very bad weather conditions. Within walking distance are beaches such as Loutro Bay Beach, Ilingas Beach and Timios Stavros Beach. If you have had enough of lazing around in the sun, canoes can be hired, you can snorkel and dive, even take a dive course. Nearby are a few Venetian ruins, and also a beautiful white-washed chapel framed perfectly against the blue sea, just placed perfectly for photographers.\n\nMake sure not to miss this magical little village that postcards just do not do justice!\n\nThe Island of Wines\n\nIf wine is your thing, you’ll be glad to know there’s plenty of it in Chania!

Aptera was inhabited since Minoan times but it only became a significant city around the 8th century BC as its strategic location above the bay of Souda could control the circulation of ships.

Myzithra, a cheese similar to ricotta, which has a light, moist consistency is a favorite at this time of year and used to make many wonderful types of cheese pies, including being used as a topping for the traditional Cretan “Dako”. This is a rye rusk topped with freshly grated tomato, drizzled with oregano and olive oil and topped with Myzithra, a heavenly texture.\n\nFrom the mountains, “Horta” are favorite of the locals which are wild greens picked in the fields, packed with nutrients and antioxidant properties. It is no wonder that Cretans in particular have the longest life expectancy in Europe! Cretans enjoy simple and clean tastes, such as that of lamb seasoned only with lemon, thyme and rosemary. Without fail we also have to mention Cretan olives and olive oil as being of the best quality in Greece and Europe.\n\nTo top it all off apart from the incredibly wholesome vegetables grown on the island including tomatoes, artichokes and more, a sure favorite is stuffed vine leaves with rice and other aromatic herbs.\n\nTo sit at a Cretan table this Easter and any time of the year one can be guaranteed to enjoy one of the best meals they have had abroad!\n\nOut and about Chania in 24hrs\n\nWith Crete being voted as the 6th best destination worldwide by TripAdvisor we could not be happier than to share perhaps why this is so.\n\nCrete, and Chania in particular couldn’t be more charming that it is, one would find it difficult to fit in all the endless possibilities of sightseeing in one trip!\n\nHere is only a small taste of 24hrs in the center of Chania starting with a warm and tasty bougatsa for breakfast from the infamous “Iordanis” in the center of town. A crunchy and decadent sweet cheese filled pastry topped with cinnamon and sugar - a sure favorite of the locals.\n\nVenture of into the sunny morning, through the Chania Market with its stands of fresh local produce, down to the old town with a stroll to the old Venetian harbor - a bustling center with little cobble alleys and the magnificent Venetian lighthouse. You will be tempted to stop for a coffee at the hip and trendy \"Pallas\" – a place to be seen in the town for a morning or midday cup. This spot offers the perfect view right across the lighthouse and whole harbor as you can watch the tourists and locals walk by getting on with their day!\n\nWith your taste buds satisfied head off to the \"Hamam\" store for some leisurely clothes shopping.

You will be sure to pick up rare pieces by local artists.\n\nAs the road has now led you into the heart of the Venetian center, stop for some genuinely good “mezedes” (small plates) at \"Tamam\" for lunch. The old Turkish hamam (public baths) hosts one of the most popular restaurants in the old town of Chania. “Tamam” plunges you into the cuisine of Constantinople with a list of 72 spectacular dishes. Very friendly service and a great selection of wines.\n\nWith a lazy afternoon ahead of you, head of to Nea Chora, only 1 km from Chania’s center to a long and golden sandy beach. Laze the afternoon away on your sun lounger and swim in the crystal clear blue waters of the Cretan Sea.\n\nAs the sun starts coming down and the hazy, sweet summer night takes over step back to the old harbor to watch the perfect sunset as the amber colours change the hue of all the Venetian buildings.

Age-old experience of modern wine producers in Crete have managed to elevate Cretan wine to its rightful position showcasing the tasty variety of grapes, aromas and flavors to even the highest wine connoisseurs. We particularly love the labels of the Dourakis family who’s ethos and proud tradition is characterized by knowledge, skills and extensive experience in winemaking. The family winery prides itself in creating products of high quality using scientific care and respect of traditional methods. We love their red “Lihnos” Cabernet Sauvignon with its dominant aroma of red fruits and lush aroma brought out by ageing. Ruby red color, it has a velvety taste leaving a superb aftertaste.\n\nEqually magnificent are the wines of the Manousakis Winery who’s vineyards are planted on an elevation of 350 meters situated on the hills just outside the village Vatolakkos.

Festivities take place on every day of the “holy week” in the run up to Easter Sunday, but most gather from Good Friday onwards for the candlelight procession of the epitaph around the church. This takes place in all churches throughout Crete and Greece, but is particularly an authentic experience when seen in the small villages of the island such as Kontomari where Conte Marino Villas are situated.\n\nOn Easter Saturday, young and old throughout the area gather wood that will be used in the preparation of a bonfire sculpted in the shape of Judas. The bonfire will be lit in the evening after 12pm signifying the burning of Judas, when the “Holy Light” has lit the flame of candles of all those gathered at church. At the stroke of midnight on Saturday night, lights in the church are extinguished leaving the congregation in darkness. This signifies the passage of Christ into the underworld, and the “Holy Light” is then passed by the priest to re-light the candles of the faithful indicating that \"Hristos Anesti\", Christ has risen.\n\nOn Easter Sunday morning, the 40-day period of fasting finally comes to an end and of course a true Greek Easter could not go amiss without a culinary menu of roasted lamb, eggs painted red, “koulourakia” biscuits and good wine, all enjoyed among the company of family and friends who gather to celebrate! Cretan dancing, songs, and the sound of the Cretan “lira” fill the day with tales sung 100’s of year back creating a traditional atmosphere steeped in history and faith.\n\nEnjoy a truly traditional Greek Easter with us this year on Sunday 16th April at Conte Marino Villas in Kontomari Village.\n\n“Domestic Setup” - The Conte Marino Project\n\nOnce again the acclaimed artists Apostolis Zolotakis and Kelly Athanasiadou return to Crete to showcase their exceptional works in yet another project.\n\nAfter the success of their exhibition presented last summer at the Centre for Mediterranean Architecture titled “From Abstract Expressionism to Emotional Rationalism”, the artists exhibited to a Cretan audience yet another collaboration of art and sculpture with an intriguing concept. For the needs of their new exhibition titled “Domestic Setup” the artists used the setting of Conte Marino luxurious villas in Kontomari Platanias, as a platform of space of natural energy to showcase their work. The independent complex of villas is the architectural masterpiece of award winning architects - brothers Aristomenis and George Varoudakis.\n\nThe exhibition compliments and works in harmony with the characteristic and recognizable architectural “thumbprint” style of two of the most important architectural creators in Crete. Conte Marino Villas, built with impressive natural stone features and highlighted with details of stainless steel, works in gentle harmony with the outdoor orange groves on which they are built. Within this modern living environment the artists strategically place their works of art – paintings of mixed art created by Zolotakis and sculptures of steel by Athanasiadou – adding detail and harmony to the living space. This acclaimed exhibition aims to illustrate that art can become one with its showcasing space, to provide a visually dynamic outcome pleasing to the eye and in tune with the energy of its surroundings. All three villas of the Conte Marino complex are available for rent as holiday houses, providing an exceptionally sophisticated and high quality vacation experience that combines and rejoices in the beauty of Greek nature, architecture, art and hospitality.\n\nThe exhibition will be held until December 2015 and can be viewed by the public subject to request.\n\nFor more information:\n\nCONTE MARINO VILLAS\n\nKontomari Platanias, Chania 73014, Crete, Greece\n\nT. +30 28210 62278\n\nM. +30 693 2414570\n\nE.

A stunning diversity of landscape, flora, and fauna, make this island a paradise for any type of walker, and for any level.\n\nAlong with the neighbouring Imbros Gorge, Samariá is the most famous and as a result, the most visited.\n\nPlenty of organised tours will take you to and through the gorge, which only exceeds its illustrious reputation. Otherwise, the easy (if somewhat long at 5-7 hours) path is simple to follow without a guide. Enormous walls tower nearly 1,000ft on either side of you at the famous ‘Gates,’ while the Lefka Ori rise majestically around the well-maintained path.\n\nIt costs €5.00 to get in to the national park, but this is a small price to pay for the experience, while coaches or ferries at either end of the gorge make it easy to get to and from the closest big city, Chania.\n\nEnjoy the journey and take time out to discover the longest and biggest gorge of Europe, all to be found it Crete!\n\n\"The two faces of January\" film hits Greek cinema theaters\n\nGreat Movie with Chania aroma, as we all remember about one and a half year ago its shooting, where...\n\na big part of Chania old town, Tampakaria area and countryside were transformed to a ’50 decade’s scene. Many Chania citizens participated like walkons. “The Two Faces of January” is an American psychological thriller written and directed by screenwriter Hossein Amini in his directorial debut.\n\nThe film is based on the 1964 novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst, and Oscar Isaac star in the film, which is centered on a con artist, his wife and a stranger who try to flee a foreign country after one of them is caught up in the murder of a police officer. Set in Athens and Crete in 1962, the film owes its style to Hitchcock and bears unmistakable similarities to another Highsmith adaptation, ‘The Talented Mr Ripley’.\n\nThe film premiered at the Berlinale Special Galas section of 64th Berlin International Film Festival! Amini’s first movie as a director was mostly well received in Berlin, with particular praise for the soundtrack and the lighting.\n\n“The Two Faces of January’” will hit the Greek cinema theatres soon!\n\n(....just wondering, how we will feel to see our favorite land on the big screen.....)"
