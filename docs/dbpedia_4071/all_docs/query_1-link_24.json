        "text": "The years following the 2010 bailout by the EU entailed a reactivation in Greece of mistrust of “Germany” as an executor of austerity measures that descends from the executioners of the 1940s. This chapter sheds light on political imagination, particularly perceptions of alterity and coexistence, by exploring practices of display and looking at photographs in two case studies. On the one hand, images of “traditional” old men and women gifted back to their descendants by grateful German tourists who first visited the rocky Cretan area of Sfakia in the 1960s. On the other, black-and-white photographs of survivors of atrocities perpetrated by German troops in the 1940s, held up today as reminders of victimhood in the towns of Kalavryta and Distomo. By unpacking the experiences afforded with these photographic frames, the chapter revisits classic themes, such as hospitality, while theorizing the limits of “citizenship” between those who see themselves as inhabiting Europe’s center and Europe’s periphery.\n\nThis paper aims to establish the grounds for a postcolonial reading of both Greece and its representation. It attempts to take a deeper look at the framework in which the image of Greece is constructed, interpreted and finally represented by examining how Greek photography has evaluated and represented its domestic environment, and the degree to which such an operation has been determined or influenced by dominant western culture. In order to frame my topic of interest, I have taken into consideration the photographic work of Nelly (Elli Seraidari). Overall, Nelly illustrates a good deal about thedesired identity of the new state, an image of how Greece’s new middle class desired both their country and themselves to appear, that is, how they sought to constitute their social, cultural and national identity.\n\nThe mountainous region of Sphakia in Crete strongly evokes notions of ruggedness, masculinity, and “tradition,” both in Greece and internationally. Recent anthropological studies of power and imagination (particularly in Greek society) have argued that local claims to tradition as well as stereotypes about the ruggedness of those who dwell in hinterlands necessarily reflect and promote the cultural domination by centers of peripheries. In critically responding to these studies, I offer a comprehensive exploration of the volatile field of subjectifications and cultural dynamics produced by and between Sphakians and spectators of the region. In doing so, I turn to the visual as a particularly rich field of practices that rupture concepts of structural subjugation. In examining such spheres as Sphakians’ photographic reappropriation and indigenous critique, I elucidate the dynamics of dominance but also capture other productive possibilities unleashed in the context of an “exoticized” society.\n\nFrom its earliest appearance, photography in Greece participated, perhaps to a greater extent and certainly more directly than any medium other than the written word, in the never-ending enterprise of nation building. This was a far from clearly defined, complex and manifold endeavour: the idea of the nation had to be simultaneously identified, defined, fabricated and promoted. Photography was in many ways ideally suited to the latter three at least of these tasks. At one and the same time, photography provided society with a record, a mirror and a model.\n\nGermany's tough negotiating tactics during Greek economic crisis, in which harsh austerity measures were imposed in Greek citizens, had produced a bad mood between the relations among the two states and their citizens. This mood is strengthened by the mass media, changing the Greek conception about Germany and E.U. in general. In this research we study on the magazine named as \"The History Illustrated\" which is the first Greek magazine of public historical material published since 1968 by Papyros editions. Public history as a \"nonacademic narrative\" plays an important role in the modern construction of national or historic consciousness which create the image of the \"other\". The research material is analysed as a multimodal, narrative and visual \"text\" which describes the past events in many diverse forms of historical narratives. We focus on the choices of the editor using the method of narrative analysis, so as to exact results about what image is formed about Germany and Europe. The research material is structured on (5) referencescovers and 15 historical texts that are representing the Greek-German relationship\n\nFinal Year Dissertation: Contemporary photography theory tells us that photographs always emerge out of a context and an ideology, and are never neutral reproductions of reality. The first photographic renderings of Greece in the 19th century by Europeans were dominated by an idealised perception of classical antiquity and had little to do with the contemporaneous social scenery. In the mode of ‘self-colonisation’, some Greek photographers imitated this gaze and adopted it as the one true view of their world. These representational strategies then reverberated through domestic photographic production, illustrating the pervasiveness of hegemonic narratives and the influence the countries of the West have had on the modern Greek nation, ever since its early years. Following the wide establishment of these image- making tactics, Greek photographic production in the 1970s (after the restitution of democracy and the emergence of radical theoretical texts on photography) is thereon shaped as an oppositional force to such reductive representations, excluding notions of the ‘mythical Greece’ trope from its discourse. This essay’s focus is the 21st century and it unravels in a linear mode, employing three case studies – from 2000 to 2004 to 2011. Omonia 2000 (2000) by Stratos Kalafatis, the first case study, consists of such a rejection of the aforementioned monumentality that usually ran through representations of Greece, instead elevating everyday occurrences in the Athenian ‘underbelly’. Next, Gerasimos Domenikos’ Olympiad photographs (2004) return to monumental moments, in a double-coded documentation of the Athenian Olympic spectacle. Finally, Panos Kokkinias’ “Leave Your Myth in Greece” (2011) series converses with the archetypal representations of Greece, to deliver a parody of Greek tourism discourses and strategies. All three photographers interrogate Greece’s relationship with the overarching presence of the West, which some scholars have come to call crypto-colonial.\n\nThe article explores cinematic and photographic images of the ‘Greek crisis’ in order to show how the visual can render the crisis both visible and invisible, clear and opaque, normalized and contested. Greek new wave cinema, iconic repetitive images of suffering in the center of Athens, and the group of visual artists Depression Era are discussed in this context. I argue that the images in focus articulate the crisis and render it visible. At the same time, however, they challenge one's expectations of what the crisis is and how normalized it has become. I argue that these images can encourage civic responsibility and a dialogue about freedom and democracy in the current predicament."
