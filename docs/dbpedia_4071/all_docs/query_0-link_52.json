Whatever may be the result of the measures recently adopted in India, for rendering English the language of the native population of that exten- sive region, it cannot be doubted that it must, for a very considerable period, continue to be, as it has hitherto been, sound policy in the British Govern- ment, to encourage its European servants to acquire the means of com- municating with the people, and to obtain a conversancy with those Asiatic tongues by which alone a free intercourse with them can be kept up. For this purpose, however, it is not sufficient that the use of a colloquial medium fc * the ordinary affairs of official life should be the limit of attain- ment The character of the communication between native and European, in India, is too frequently that of superior and inferior, master and depen- dant ; in which there is no interchange of thought, no community of feeling, and which, so far from improving the connexion between the parties, is too apt to inspire them reciprocally with sentiments of aversion and contempt. A friendly and familiar correspondence with natives of intelligence and res- pectability, is exceedingly rare, and Europeans of station and acquirement shrink from their conversation, because in truth they are conscious of being unable to converse with them on topics of general interest. But to appre- ciate the feelings, to command the respect, to win the affection, of the natives, it is indispensably necessary to treat them as equals, to understand what they understand, to feel what they feel, to be able to comprehend their ideas, and to render European ideas intelligible to them ; it is necessary, in short, to be conversant with their literature as well as with our own, and to have not merely the use but the choice of expressions. However desirable it may be that the European functionaries who are charged with important duties, and are the observed of all observers, should be thus accomplished, it is obvious that such acquirements cannot be gene- rally possessed. A taste for the studies by which the requisite proficiency is to be attained, is far from udiversal, and of those who might be disposed to pursue them, some want the perseverance, some the opportunity, and some the leisure, to cultivate them with. success. The object, tberefore, must be left ill a great degree to the voluntary efforts of individuals, originating either in the love of knowledge or desire of distinction. To what extent those efforts should be encouraged by the supreme authorities, may be mat- N.S.Vol.23.No.89. B 2 The late John Tytler^ Esq'^ of the * ter of question; but no one can, for a moment, imagine, it expedient that they should be disregarded or discountenanced. Yet such appears to be the tendency of the course latterly pursued in India, and the Government seems as if it. sought to deter its servants from Oriental studies, not only by with- holding from them all marks of favour, but even by inflicting upon them unequivocal proofs of its displeasure. Such, at least, was the case in regard to the late Mr. John Tytler, of the medical service of Bengal, whose recent death the literature of the East and the natives of India have reason to regret. The former has rarely had a more zealous or more successful cultivator ; the latter have never* had a more sincere or more valuable friend. Of those who have engaged in the study of Oriental literature, the objects have varied with the tastes, the purposes, and circumstances of the students. Some have sought amusement, some information ; some have attempted to supply entertaining or instructive accessions to the literature of Europe ; some have hoped to penetrate the darkness of remote antiquity, and trace the origin and descent of language, of science, and of mankind. In the East, such attainments have been most commonly applied to the wants of the public service, and have provided facilities for the acquirement of language or for the administration of law. The labours of Mr. Tytler were, in a great degree, peculiar to himself. In the first instance, they so far partook of the general description, that they were designed to investigate and make known to European science, the history and details of the medical and mathematical learning of the Mohammedans and Hindus. Subse- quently, however, the direction of his labours was reversed, and tlie latter years of his residence in Bengal were devoted to the communication of European science and knowledge to the natives of India, through the me- dium of translations from English into the principal Eastern languages, a task which he has well described* as being one of much difiiculty and labour ; as having little to render it inviting ; as leading neither to emolument nor fame, and as recommended only by a sense of its usefulness, and of its indispensable employment as a main instrument in the improvement of native education. The importance of Mr. Tytler s services in this and in other departments of Anglo- Asiatic education — his merits as a scholar and an Orientalist — the circumstances under which his acquirements were made and his talents exercised, and the manner in which they were requited, will possibly render a sketch of his active and useful life, a not unacceptable or unserviceable contribution to the scanty biographical records we possess of those who have from time to time reflected honour upon the British character in the East. Mr. Tytler may be regarded as enjoying by inheritance that ardent love of knowledge, by which he was distinguished from the earliest to the latest period of his life, being connected by both his parents with families eminent in literary history. His father, Dr. Wm. H. Tytler, w^as a cousin of the late Lord Woodhouselee ; his mother was the sister of Dr. Gillies, the historian of Greece. Dr. Tytler was himself a man of letters, and a scholar of more than ordinary attainments, having translated into English * English preface to the Arabic translation of Hooper^s Anatomy. Bengal Medical Service, 3 verse the Hymns of Callimachus ; the Punics of Silius Italicus> and other classical writings. Mr. John Tytlcr^ his youngest son, was born at Brechin» N.B. in 1790, and resided there until he was seven years of age. His father, having entered the army as a surgeon, then removed his family to Guernsey, but shortly afterwards repaired with them to the Cape of Good Hope, where he held the appointment of Apothecary to the Forces. This residence at the Capo was not of long continuance, as, in 1802, the colony was restored to the Dutch, and Dr. Tytler returned in consequence to Europe. These changes had an unfavourable influence upon the education of young Tytler, and he was left very much to his own inclination for the nature and extent of his acquirements. His desire to learn was, however, not to be repressed ; his importunities compelled his father to assist him in the learned languages, and from his elder sister he obtained instruction in French and Italian. A private soldier introduced him to the elements of mathematics. Of his advancement in literature, under every disadvantage, interesting tes- timony is recorded in ]}arrow*s Travels in South Africa (vol. ii. p. 8). Having quoted the lines of Virgil, Vidi egOy &c., in reference to the pre- sence of an old anchor on the summit of the Table Mountain, Mr. Barrow notices the inaccuracy of Dryden*s translation, and adds that, having made the remark \" to the son of his learned and ingenious friend. Dr. Tytler, a boy of twelve years of age,’^ he furnished him immediately with a different metrical version. This he has also printed, and both in versification and fidelity to the original, the performance is highly creditable to the juvenile translator. The days passed at the (^ape ^vere not, however, wholly en- grossed by books, and nature was an instructress far from disregarded. Some melancholy lines, upon revisiting the Cape* on Mr. Tyller*s home- ward voyage, sufficiently prove that the boy had gathered from the sublimity of the scene around him energies and hopes, which siidly contrasted with the sense of depression and disappointment with which the man contemplated the same mighty and unaltered mountains, — the same vast and restless ocean. Upon the return of Dr. Tytler from the Cape, in 1803, he resided for a few months in London, during which his son attended the academy inSoho- square, then kept by Mr. Whitelock. From hence the family removed to Edinburgh, where for one term only young Tytler attended the university classes. The lectures which excited in him the greatest interest, were those of Professor Playfair, and he frequently reverted to them in after-life with a vivid impression of the delight they had afforded him. The decided predi- lection he evinced for mathematical studies induced General Melville to offer to procure for him an engineer cadetship at Woolwich, an appointment which would no doubt have been congenial to his talents as far as the theory of the art extended, but which would have involved duties repugnant to his humane nature and religious princiides. It is not, therefore, perhaps, to be regretted, that Mrs. Tytler withheld her consent to his acceptance of the nomination, and it was declined. It was her wish that her son should be brought up to mercantile occupations, and although this was little suited either to his talents or to his tastes, yet, in ready compliance with her will, he * Lines on revisiting the Cape after an absence of uiirty-three years. Asiatic Journal, N.S. vol. xxi. p. aw. 4 The late John TytUr^ Esq.y of the entered at the eaily age of fourteen and a half the counting-house of his uncle, Mr. Gillies, an eminent merchant of London. His days were now spent at the desk ; but the avocations of duty were unable to repress the desire of knowledge, and the evenings were devoted to literary improve- ments. His classical and mathematical studies were prosecuted with undi- minished ardour, and to his acquaintance with other modern tongues he added that of German. His progress in this language was so rapid, that his knowledge of it seemed to come almost by intuition. A remarkable proof of this occurred; for, after he had been engaged in the study but a few months, the clerk to whom the foreign correspondence of the hrm was entrusted, unexpectedly died, and young Tytler was found competent to supply his place. In 1809, Dr. Tytler died, leaving a wife and daughter in circumstances far from affluent. An elder son, Robert Tytler, had previously gone to Bengal, as an assistant surgeon, and the remaining son was the only stay of his widowed parent. His assistance was promptly and affectionately rendered; and his mother and sister joined him in London. The latter went to India, to her other brother, in 1812. About the latter period, Mr. J. Tytler's studies received a new direction. The political state of Europe offering but an indifferent prospect to mercantile enterprise, he was induced to abandon the intention of engaging in business, and commenced the study of anatomy and surgery, in order to qualify himself for an appointment to the Bengal medical service. He accordingly attended the lectures ^and practice of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, under Sir James Earle and Mr. Abernethy, and soon acquired the esteem of his instructors : with Mr. Abernethy he was an especial favourite. During part of the time he fol- lowed his medical studies he continued to discharge his duties in the count- ing-house, his means not permitting him to forego the salary of the situation. Having proceeded through the usual course, and passed his examination at the college, he received his nomination as an assistant surgeon in 1813, and, accompanied by his mother, sailed for Calcutta in the same year. The short period in which he acquired the qualifications requisite for his new profession, and the unfavourable circumstances under which they were obtained, are remarkable proofs both of his capacity and application. Mr. Tytler went out to India a passenger in the Carnatic^ and was for- tunate in finding on board Colonel Sir Henry Worsley, who was return- ing to Bengal. That gentleman, observing Mr. Tytler's aptitude for study, recommended him to direct his attention to the Oriental languages, and his advice and encouragement stimulated Mr. Tytler to apply to them with invigorated zeal and diligence. During the voyage, Mrs. Tytler met witli an accident which rendered her lame for life. Upon Mr. Tytler's landing in Calcutta, his sister was again domesticated with him, and continued to reside with him until her death. He was, as is customary, appointed for a short time to the General Hospital, but in the beginning of 1814 was attached to the civil station of Patna. The situation w||B in many respects desirable. There was a tolerably extensive and intel- European society ; and at the house of Mr. Douglas, the senior Bengal Medical Service. 5 judgCj where Mr. Tytler was a frequent guest, an opportunity was afforded him of meeting with a number of natives, respectable both from rank and intelligence. Amongst them, in particular, a native gentleman, Dejvan Khan Ji, became united on terms of the most cordial intimacy with Mr. Tytler, and the intercourse was mutually profitable. Dewan Khan J! was well versed in mathematical science, and with the assistance of some of his countrymen and some Europeans, had compiled a work in the Persian language, which Mr. Tytler describes as a complete system of arithmetic, algebra, and geometry, as far as known to the Mohammedans and Hindus. It also comprised copious extracts from European writers on these subjects translated into Persian. Of this compilation, entitled the Khasanat al llniy or Treasury of Science, Mr. Tytler, at a subsequent period, brought a copy to Calcutta, and presented it to the first Committee of Public Instruc- tion. It was ordered by them, with the sanction of Government, to be printed, and a considerable portion of it had passed through the press, under Mr. Tytler's superintendence, when, upon a change of the members of the committee, and the predominating influence of persons incapable of appreciating the value of the exact sciences in a course of national education, the printing was discontinued. The publication would, therefore, have been stopped, had not the Asiatic Society of Bengal, with most commendable public spirit, completed it at their own expense. The possession of this work, and the friendship and assistance of its author, gave an irrepressible impulse to Mr. Tytler’s application ; and during his residence at Patna, he made himself roaster of the Arabic, Persian, and Hindustani languages, and familiar with much that was of most interest in the medical and mathe- matical learning of the Asiatics. He commenced also the translation of his friend Khan Ji's book, or M least of as much of it as was Oriental. Pending the completion of his task, he selected two of the subjects treated of in the Khasanat al Ihn for especial investigation, and communicated the result to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, by whom they were published in the Researches. The first of these is an Essay on the Binomial Theorem, as know'n to the Arabs, in which it is made manifest that the rule for gene- rating the co-efficients of the terms successively one from another of any powers of the Binomial root, independent of those of any other power, ascribed by Dr. Hutton to Briggs, in the year 1000, was fully known to the Mohammedans before that date, a rule of the same nature being given in the Miftah al Hisah^ composed in the reign of Ulugh Beg, or about A.D. 1445. This paper appeared in the 13th volume of the Researches. Another paper of the same class, but still more elaborate, appears in the 17th volume, on the Extraction of the Roots of Integers, as practised by the Arabs, in which their process, as far as to the sixth root of the number, is fully detailed. It is also exhibited in the tabular form, termed by Arabic writers the shakal mimberiy or pulpit diagram. The interest first imbibed by Mr. Tytler at Patna from the example and aid of his friend Khan Ji, in these arduous and abstruse enquiries, continued unimpaired to the last : and, after his return to England, he communicated to the Royal Asiatic Society an analysis of a work analogous to the Khasanat al limy named 6 The late John Toiler ^ Esq., of the the Jamia Bahadar Khani, by Maulavi Gholam Hosein, a scientific native in the service of Buhadar Khan, the son of the Raja of Tikari, another of Mr. Tytler's Patna friends, and a patron of mathematical learning. Mr. Tytler also prepared for the Ashmolean Society of Oxford, an account of an Arabic version of the Conic Sections of Apollonius, and of other niathc- matical vrorks originally written in Europe, of which he had brought home a manuscript copy. Amidst his philological and mathematical pursuits, whilst thus circum- stanced, Mr. Tytler's professional studies and duties were by no means neg- lected. Patna, although still one of the most extensive and populous cities of Bengal, has much declined in wealth and consequence, and is crowded with an indigent and labouring population ; numbers and privation produce their usual consequences, and the distress prevalent amongst the poorer classes is aggravated by widely spread and frequently fatal disease. At the time that Mr. Tytler was stationed at Patna, no means existed of alleviating the suflerings of the sick by proper treatment and care, and the people were reluctant to accept medical aid from Europeans, even when it was tendered to them. Principally through Mr. Tytler’s exertions, an hospital was esta- blished, and his knowledge of the natives, his considerateness for their pre- judices, his gentleness, humanity and skill, gradually divested them of their dislike, and secured their confidence ; and the hospital was soon and con- stantly tenanted by patients. Another important service was, during the same period, afforded by Mr. Tytler to medical science in Bengal. Observing the very defective education of the native professors of the healing art, and their ignorance of the prin- ciples of their profession, he turned his thoughts to the means by which they might be more efficiently qualified, and devised a plan for a native medical school. This plan was submitted by him to the Marquess of Hastings, then Governor- general, whilst at Patna, on his way to the Upper Provinces, at the beginning of the Pindaric war. The project received the Governor-general’s approbation, and after his return to Calcutta, was car- ried partially into execution : an institution was established for educating in the principles of anatomy, surgery, and medicine, as taught in Europe, a number of young natives, who were to be afterwards employed as dressers and hospital assistants to the Company's regimental surgeons. It would seem but equitable that the person with whom the plan originated should have been selected to carry it into effect ; but other interests outweighed Mr.Tytler’s claims, and the superintendence of the new medical school was given to the Secretary of the Medical Board. Upon his death, in 1822, each superintending surgeon was directed to nominate the person, in his district, most competent in Jiis opinion to succeed, and Mr. Tytler would have been named as one of the candidate.s, and would probably have been appointed, had he not declined a contest in which he anticipated his brother would be his competitor. The appointment was given to Mr. Breton, and it was not until that gentleman’s death, at the end of 1830, that Mr. Tytler was placed at^he head of an institution of which he might be considered as in some measdre the founder. Bengal Medical Service, 7 Whilst at Paina^ Mr. Tytler married his cousin, the daughter of that Mr. Gillies, under whose auspices he had commenced his career in life. It was an early attachment, formed in Europe, whilst the parties were yet young, and one which had stood the test of time and separation. As soon as he found himself in circumstances which justified the offer, Mr. Tytler proposed and was accepted. Miss Gillies arrived in India in May 1818, and was met by her future husband in Calcutta, where they were married. They returned together to Patna. Of the happiness which attended his union, Mr. Tytler has himself borne evidence, and in some pleasing stanzas, has delineated the truth, the constancy, the sympathy, the tenderness, which characterise man's best friend, the partner of his fortunes, the soother of his ills, and which those who knew them knew that he experienced in the choice he had made. In the beginning of 1810, Mr. Tytler was appointed to the medical charge of the Champaran Light Infantry Battalion, and consequently quitted Patna for Mallye, the head-quarters of the corps. The change was recom- mended by prudential considerations, but w^as in other respects disadvanta- geous. Being a small and remote military station, the European society was limited to the very few individuals, by whom a local corps is at any time officered, and tlierc were no native residents of any respectability or learning : a munshi of the most ordinary pretensions was not to be procured. Mr. Tytler had, therefore, to prosecute his studies without sympathy and without assistance, and it needed all his steadiness of purpose and love of learning to persevere; unfortunately, too, his constitution, never very robust, and enfeebled by his previous residence in India, proved unable to contend with the noxious effects of a most unhealthy situation. During the whole period of three years and a half, that he remained at Mallye, he scarcely enjoyed a day’s exemption from indisposition, and was on more than one occasion seriously ill. His ardour was, nevertheless, undiminished, and every moment that his duties, his health, and the cares of a rising family, permitted, w^as devoted to the literature both of the East and of the West. Of the insalubrity of Mallye he has left a most graphic and appal- ling delineation, in a paper on its medical topography, wdiich was commu- nicated to the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta.f At length, unable to bear up longer against the evil influence of the atmosphere of Mallye, Mr. Tytler obtained, in 1 822, the civil surgeoncy of Monghir. However acceptable and necessary the removal, his new residence commenced under unpropitious auspices in the death of his sister, Miss Margaret Tytler, to whom he was strongly attached. Miss Tytler was in truth a young w^oman of more than ordinary merit. Not less fervently animated by the love of knowledge than her brother, she had acquired a competent acquaintance \\^ith the learned languages, as well as those of modern Europe, and had also made herself mistress of some of those of the East, particularly Persian and Hindustani. Interesting herself in the country which was her home, and in the improvement of its inhabitants, she especially directed her attention to the state of the arts and manufactures • Stanzas by J. Tytler; Bengal Annual, 1831. t Trans. Med. and Phys. Society, vol. iv. Q ' The late John Tyilery Esq-y f^ihe of India. In illustration of her enquiries, she caused to be constructed, under her own superintendance, a set of models of the implements employed in the domestic, manufacturing, and agricultural industry of Hindustan, and accompanied them by a detailed account of their construction and applica- tion. Duplicates of the models were, at their request, furnished by her to various societies and individuals, and are to be seen in the collection of the Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Museum at the India-House. Copies of the description were also supplied, but it has never been published. She contributed also, it is believed, some communications, original or translated, to the periodical press of Calcutta ; but it would not be possible to identity them : diffidence was as much an integral part of her nature as talent, and however conscious she must have been of ability and acquirement, it was never in the slightest degree obtrusively manifested in private society, and she shrunk with truly feminine delicacy from the notice of the public. Monghir is principally a station for invalid officers, and the society is therefore neither select nor permanent. Mr. Tytler was consequently not much more favourably circumstanced than at Mallye, as far as regarded literary association and assistance. His leisure liours were, however, not unimproved, and amongst other occupations, he compiled an elaborate set of tables, intended to facilitate trigonometrical operations, a labour which was suggested to him by a public survey which was in progress in the vici- nity of Monghir. He was also a frequent contributor to the Calcutta Quarterly Magazine and Review, and other periodical works, and becoming a member of the Calcutta Medical Society from the date of its first insti- tution, prepared some of the results of his professional experience for its Transactions. In 182.^, Mr. Tytler lost his mother, and this second domestic calamity, at the same place, made him quit Monghir without regret, when, in consequence of his promotion as surgeon, he was under the neces- sity of leaving it, and doing duty with the army. He was appointed to the 20th Reg. N. 1., and in May 1826 joined it at Barrackpore. At the end of the same year, Mr. Tytler was nominated Garrison Sur- geon at Chunar; but in the interval he had spent a short time in Calcutta, in order to send his two eldest sons to England. This afforded him an opportunity of mixing with society on a larger and more liberal scale than was elsewhere in India to be met with, and of forming an acquaintance and a friendship with individuals of pursuits and tastes congenial to his own. He was elected a member of the Asiatic Society, and was introduced to the members of the Committee of Public Instruction, whose measures, then in their very commencement, he was enabled to witness. That such a scene should have been most interesting to a mind like Mr. Tytler's may be easily conceived, and it was not without much reluctance that he returned to the comparative torpor of a mofussil appointment. There being no opening for his services in Calcutta, he was under the necessity of leaving it, and with spirits doubly depressed from the departure of his children, and separation irpm the only mode of life in which he could have found a solace for their Miss, he repaired to Chunar. The duty there was ill-calculated to restore tl^ elasticity of his mind. It was not only laborious and harassing, but to Bengal Medical Service, 9 a Mnsitive temperament painfully distressing. It was little else than atten- dapce upon the death-beds of the victims of intemperance. The European garrison of Chunar is formed of invalids — men, whose constitutions have very commonly been injured more by their own vicious propensities than the effects of climate or casualties of war, and who have grown too old in evil habits to be easily reformed. Having little military duty, they lead a life of indolence, and have no resources wherewith to beguile the tediousness of a monotonous existence, save the pipe and the bottle ; no wonder, therefore, they were found to be, at the time that Mr. Tytler joined, infinitely more demoralized, and more ignorant of moral or religious obligations, than the natives around them. Mr. and Mrs. Tytler assisted, with the most bene- volent activity, in the measures which were intended for their reform, by providing at their own expense books for all who were able and willing to read, distributing Bibles to those who had them not, and assembling the children at their house for instruction in the rudiments of English and the principles of religious faith. One of Mr. Tytler's efforts for the ameliora- tion of these people, was the composition and circulation of a sermon on the evil consequences and wickedness of intemperance. This was afterwards printed at the Baptist Mission Press in Calcutta, and distributed through the Archdeacon to the European troops. To have borne up against the fatigue consequent upon the discharge of professional duty, amidst a mass of'unmanageable disease, and the grief or disgust inspired by the constant spectacle of vice and irreligion, required more robust health and more blunt sensibilities than characterised Mr. Tytler. The hot winds also blow at Chunar with great violence, and with an influ- ence most injurious to debilitated constitutions ; and these combined causes produced such alarming effects upon Mr. Ty tier's health, that his friends began to anticipate the most serious results, when he was fortunately with- drawn from so uncongenial a scene, and called to duties more compatible with his qualifications, more pleasing to his inclinations, and more propitious to his health. The extended and extending objects of the Committee of Public Instruction rendered it necessary to secure the co-operation of addi- tional talent, and to obtain the services of one who was so eminently fitted to promote the cause of native education. A presidency surgeoncy, being vacant, was assigned to him by the Bengal Government by which he was removed from provincial military duty, and fixed permanently in Calcuttat He arrived at the Presidency at the end of 1827, and remained there until his final departure from India, employed most unweariedly and effectively in advancing the intellectual improvement of the people of India. In order to provide printed books at the least possible cost for the native collets and schools under their authority, the Education Committee had established a press of their own, and the superintendence of this was the first oflice assigned to Mr. Tytler, in connexion %vith the committee. The charge thus entrusted to him was not* confined to details of management alone, but comprehended the editing of works in the oriental languages, published under the Committee’s sanction. These works were written in Arabic, Persian, Hindustani, Bengali, and Sanscrit, and it was requisite, Wm/.Jo?/r.N.S.VoL.23.No.89. , C fO The late John TyiUf^ Eeq.y the thiererore/ that the duperintendant of the pi^ss should be conversant with them all. The three first Mr. Tytler possessed, and he very soon became sufficiently familiar *with the two last to perform the duties of his office. The press soon fulfilled one especial object of its institution, and reduced by one-half the cost of oriental printing in Calcutta. Its maintenance was then of less importance, and an arrangement was made for its transfer to the Baptist Missionaries, by whom the work of the Committee has since been executed. Mr. Tytler still continued to revise the proof-sheets, with the aid of learned natives. Some assistance in the department of Hindoo literature was afforded by the Secretary to the General Committee and the Secretary for the Sanscrit College, but various important and extensive Mohammedan works were completed under his revision. Of these, the chief were the Fatawa Alemgiriy a voluminous compilation of decisions in Mohammedan law, in six quarto volumes ; the Mujiz al Kanuny a medi- cal work of high repute, and the Sadidiy a copious commentary on the preceding; he also edited the Fasuli Bokraiy an Arabic version of the aphorisms of Hippocrates. The college founded in Calcutta, for the instruction of natives of the learned castes in Sanscrit, included a class of medical literature. Consis- tently with the origin and scope of the institution, avowedly established in place of native seminaries, which, under the British rule, had fallen to decay, the teacher of the class was a Hindu physician, and Hindu medicine was the subject of his instruction. VVkhout violating the principles^ of the establishment, or offending the prejudices of the people, the Com- mittee conceived it practicable to engraft upon the native system, and finally thereby supersede its objectionable parts, instruction in European anatomy and medicine ; and with this view, the class was placed under the general superintendence of Mr. Tytler. The judicious conduct which he observed, the gradual manner in which he introduced innovation, and the obvious superiority of the system w'hich he taught, speedily disarmed all opposition, and effected the first and most important of all the revolutions which the connexion of learned natives with Europeans had accomplished. The Hindu students of the Brahmanical and Vaidya castes, who at a shortly anterior date would have shrunk from all practical anatomy, and regarded the presence of a dry bone as contamination, soon learned to contemplate and handle every part of the skeleton without hesitation, to engage themselves in the only kind of dissection practised in such circum- stances, that of animals, and to attend at posi-mortetn examinations at the European rhospitals. The pupils of the military medical institution had, it is true, preceded those of the Sanscrit college in similar advancement; but they were either Mohammedans or Hindus of low caste, and natives of the Upper Provinces, amongst whom Indian prejudices are in general less tenacious. In the present day, possibly, the students of the New Medical School have iio reluctance to acquire the indispensable elements of medical knowledge ; but that it should be so, is mainly attributable to the success with virbich the first introduction of Uiese studies amongst the medical caste of jSebgal was attended, at a period when European medical knowledge was Bengal Medical Service^ 11 held by the natives in very low estimation, wrgery was considered as bru- tality, and anatomy as uncleanness. Mr. Tytler’s lessons have also contrir buted in other ways to the prosperity of the new institution,, and the principal and professors have found some of his former scholars invaluable assistants to them, in the communication of their instructions to tiieir native pupils. At the same time that the Committee of Public Instruction gave that countenance to the native colleges which those institutions had a right to expect, they took under their especial super! ntendance a seminary of a more recent origin and more modern purpose — the Anglo-Indian College^ established for education in the English language and literature and in European science. Mr. Tytler*s attainments were here also most beneficially employed, and a class for the cultivation of mathematical knowledge was formed under his tuition. At first, it was sufiicicnt to impart the mere rudi- ments of the science to his scholars; but as the scheme of the institution was developed, assistance in this department was procured for him, and the higher branches were the subjects of his lessons. Some of his pupils made very distinguished progress in Algebra and Geometry, and the Principia became an ordinary class-book. One of Mr. Tyllcr’s scholars is at this moment, it is believed, efficiently employed under the Surveyor-general of India in the great Trigonometrical survey of Bengal and measurement of the meridianal arc. A measure of obvious necessity, in any attempt to disseminate new and accurate notions amongst the people of India, is the provision of suitable books. Some difference of opinion has prevailed as to what these books should be. The present Education Committee of Bengal thought proper to determine that the only books offered to the natives under their sanction should be English books, dnd, consistently with the immature condition of English study, these could be but elementary books, grammars, vocabularies, readers, and the like. The wants of those who were unacquainted witl) Eng- lish,— that is, of the great body of the people, — were consequently disregarded. Other associations for promoting education have inclined to a different course, and regarding the universal use of English as chimerical, have advocated the translation of English books into the oriental languages as the most effective method of disseminating European learning. Looking, however, solely to the people at large, they would restrict translation to the vernacular dialects and to rudiniental and popular works. The first Committee, of Instruction, under whom Mr. Tytler acted, entertained views somewhat different; without undervaluing translations of a popular character, and equally proposing in the end the improvement of the spoken dialects and the formation of a literature in the language of the people, they considered it, in the first instance, more advisable to raise the standard of acquirement amongst the literary classes, and extend the knowledge of those whose business and profession it was to learn and to teach ; accordingly, whilst they liberally encouraged the labours. of European and native schoiarf, in pre- paring and translating and publishing books of general literature in the Bengali and Hindustani languages;— whilst they contributed to the com- pilation and printing of grammars and dictionaries ;-^wbilst they united with 12 ThelaUJohn Tiileri Etqv, ^ the Ai&SbfaooKbook Society in the preparation and publication of a very extensive series of English class-books^ they undertook what else was anattempted,«-» leaving in fact the literary classes the only orders of natives unprovided for, ^the preparation and publication of works intended especially for 2ie in* stmction of native scholars, for learned and scientific individuals, Mohanr* medan and Hindu. For such a purpose, Mr. Tytler was the only Euro- pean whose assistance was available, and although the tasks upon which he was employed fell completely within the objects of the Committee, yet they were necessarily influenced by the nature of his acquirements. The medical and mathematical sciences were the departments he was most competent to undertake, and the Arabic language, the classical dialect of the learned Mcdiammedans, was that in which he was most skilled. He was in conse- quence directed to prepare Arabic translations of the medical and mathe- matical writings of Europe, for the use of the Mohammedan colleges and students, and, in the course of the few years of his residence in Calcutta, he effected accordingly translations of several valuable works. His first publication in this line was a small treatise on the Anatomy of the Heart, in Arabic, which was published in 1828. He next proceeded to a version of Hooper’s Anatomist’s Vade-Mecum, under the denomination of Ania al Bduaarrahin, He had finished the translation, and 380 pages were printed, when the work was stopped by the present Education Committee. Another laborious %vork in which he engaged was aa Arabic translation of Hutton’s Mathematics ; but this also fell under the Committee’s proscription; The first part, entitled the Jawami al tint al riazaty extending from Arith- methical Notation to Tables of Powers and Roots, was fortunately nearly printed, and has since been completed at the cost of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Whilst thus actively and usefully occupied in the service of native educa- tion, the situation which had been so long the object of his ambition, that of superintendant of the Medical Institution, again became vacant. He ap- plied for the appointment to Lord W. Bentinck, then at Simla, and in reply was not only nominated, but informed that his Lordship’s attention had been directed to Mr. Tytler’s qualifications for the situation previous to the receipt of his application.” In consequence of this addition to his labours, he relinquished the charge of the medical class of the Sanscrit College, but retained the mathematical class of the Anglo-Indian College, as, indeed, a competent successor was not to be found. His revision of the works printed for the Committee was also continued, and his translations were also carried on, the medical works being connected with his new duties. Although a very important advance from the former want of care, which left the provision of native dressers and hospital assistants to the precarious tuition of army surgeons, the institution which had been formed for their education was necessarily immature and imperfect. Mr. Tytler was not slow to perceive its defects, or to suggest to the superior authorities the changes which it required, and which could be made only with their sanction. Uttie attention was paid to his repeated representations on this subject, Will the clo9€ of 1833, when a Committee was appointed to investigate it. Bengal Medical Seroiee* 13 In the mean time^ Mr. Tytler, notwithstanding the indifference of the Government^ and notwithstanding much injudicious and vexatious interfer- ence on the part of the Medical Boards laboured assiduously for the instruc- tion of his pupils. Besides his oral lectures^ he compiled and translated for them into Hindustani many valuable tracts on anatomy and medicine, and assisted many of them in the acquirement of English sufficient for the perusal of elementary medical books. He consequently placed the institution on the most efficient footing of which it was capable, and sent annually to the medical officers of the army a supply of respectably qualified native assist- ants, — of some of whom it may be safely asserted, that they were as well- grounded in the elements of the profession as the junior medical officers of our army were accustomed to be, in times when professional education was less scrupulously attended to than it should have been. In addition to the many and laborious demands upon his time and his talents, and to which his physical powers were scarcely equal, Mr. Tytler was ever ready to enlist in the promotion of intellectual and benevolent objects. The medical and mathematical examinations of the classes of the public colleges were assigned to him by the Education Committee, and he not unfrcquently assisted at the general examinations of other seminaries in Calcutta. He w*as a member of the Committee of Papers of the Asiatic Society, of the Committee of the School-book Society, and Vice-President of the Medical and Physical Society. In 1828, he was requested by the Bishop of Calcutta to become one of the Syndicate of Bishop’s College, and besides giving his scrupulous attention to all works which came before him in that capacity, he contributed to the completion of some which were im- perfect, and which it was desirable to print: in this way, he furnished a translation of all the Collects an^ of the Church Catechism for a version of the Book of Common Prayer. He was also a contributor to the literary undertakings of the Calcutta Press, and especially to the Literary Ga~ siette and Bengal Annual, and he took an active part in the contro- versy which arose in 183^ respecting the abolition of oriental seminaries, the exclusive cultivation of English, and the substitution of Roman letters for the alphabets of the East, even in the printing of books in the Asiatic languages. In these discussions, the extravagances of his opponents may have sometimes provoked his ridicule, but he never retorted upon them the intemperance and abuse with which, on several occasions, they encountered his unanswerable arguments. At length, Mr. Tytler’s energies began to be exhausted, and his services to draw towards a close : an uninterrupted ^residence in Bengal of twenty- one years; the shocks his constitution had suffered from situations of peculiar insalubrity, and the incessant activity with which his mind had toiled, brought on, at the close of 1834, a condition of such debility, that recovery in India was hopeless, and a change of climate affonled the only prospect of the prolongation of his useful life. According to rules hitherto in force in Bengal, a servant of the Company relinquished, if he went to England, any appointment he might have held upon hn quitting India; if his voyage extended only to the Cape of Good 14f The late John TyUer^ of the Hbp^, he retained it, and returned ailer the expiration of his leave to the same situation. Some exceptions to the former clause have from time to time been permitted, where the appointments were not exactly those of routine, and required qualifications of a specific kind. Mr. Tytler bad hoped, not very unreasonably, that a similar indulgence might be granted in his case ; but in this be was disappointed, and he obtained only permis*- sion to go to the Cape for two years, after which he expected, conformably to usage, to resume his duties. On the eve of his embarkation, however, he received official intimation that his appointment was taken from him, and the Medical Institution abolished. Broken in health, depressed in spirits, and impaired in fortune, by the failure of the mercantile house in which the scanty savings of his Indian life had been deposited, with a large family depending upon him for support, Mr. Tytler was by no means in a state fit to bear up against an infliction, which deprived him of his only prospect of retiring, whilst any vigour remained, from public duty, and which again exposed him to the privations and perils of regimental service. He would, in all probability, have sunk under a visitation so unexpected, had he not been sustained by a sense of the obligation he owed to his children, and by a reliance upon the impartial and equitable consideration of the Court of Directors. He immediately addressed to the Court a statement of his case, and changed his purposed visit to the Cape for a voyage to England. With every respect for the distinguished persons then at the head of the Government of Bengal, it cannot but seem extraordinary that they should have adopted such a measure at such a season. It is true that the state of the Medical Institution was reported unfavourably of by the Committee of Inquiry : but the Committee had done no more than Mr. Tytler had previously done repeatedly, and the necessity of reform occurred solely because his representations had been disregarded. No part of the defects of the Institution could be ascribed to him : This is publicly acknowledged by the Government. The letter announcing the alteration, conveys to Mr. Tytler the thanks of Government for the zeal and ability with which he superintended the former establishment;*’ it expressly states, that ‘^the cause of the native Medical Institution having disappointed the expectations of Government was in no way attributable to any deficiency acquire- fnentSy or talentSy or general qualifications on his part and it adds, that ** it is with extreme reluctance the Governor-general considers himself precluded, with particular reference to the impaired state of Mr. Tytler’s health, from transferring his \"services to the new college'' Mr. Tytler was, therefore, avowedly deprived of his appointment, because he had sacri- ficed his health to the performance of its duties. Had, indeed, his unfitness for active exertion been irremediable, the plea must have been valid; but as there was reason to hope for recovery from a temporary suspension of labour, there were no good grounds assigned for setting him altogether aside, in violation of a long-established privilege granted heretofore to the servants of the Company. The case was not one of emergency; a delay of two years would have had no sensible effect Tjpon the ultiinate dissemina? Bengd Medical Service, 15 tion of medical education, and although tlie Governor-general was himself about to leave India, yet there was no reason to fear that his project, if judicious, would have been left unfulfilled by his successor. 8uch precipi- tate haste, and total disregard of the recognised claims of a meritorious officer, can be ascribed, it is to be feared, only to a wish to provide for individuals in whom the head of the Government took a personal interest-— individuals of undoubted merit, but not of superior desert to their prede- cessor, and who at least, at the time they were placed in charge of the new college for the medical instruction of the natives, were comparatively unfamiliar with the languages of the country, and were wholly inexpe- rienced in native tuition. That the institution prospers, as it is represented to do, under their direction, is no more than might have been expected from their talents and zeal, and the enlightened patronage of Lord Auckland; and it is to be hoped that the public good, which the superstructure will realize, will atone for the private wrong on which its foundations were laid. Mr. Tytler and his family arrived in England in May 1835. With his application to be allowed to return to his appointment, or to be permitted to retire on the pension of superintending surgeon, the Court of Directors deemed it inexpedient to comply; but they promised, if he returned to India, to recommend his services and claims to the notice of the local authorities, and upon his finally determining to resign the service, they granted an addition to his pension. This instance of their liberality was communicated to Mr. Tytler only a few days before his decease. Notwithstanding the infirm state of his health, and the anxious thoughts which preyed upon his mind, Mr. Tytler found energy and opportunity, during his short residence in this country, to indulge his literary propensities. Besides medical and matheinaticlll science, philology was a favourite study^ and few individuals were better qualified for its cultivation. Well grounded in the classical and Teutonic languages, and equally conversant with the ver- nacular and learned dialects of the East, with Hindustani, Bengali, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Sanscrit, he commanded, to an extent which few can hope to attain, the means of comparing the most opposite modes of speech, and investigating on a comprehensive scale the principles of language. It was his purpose, had his life been spared, to have undertaken a work upon general grammar. How this w'ould have been executed, may be conjectured, however imperfectly, from various minor specimens of his views upon subjects connected with the main question : such as his observa- tions on the defects of Arabic, Persian, and English dictionaries, published in the Calcutta Quarterly of June 1827, and his papers on the exclusively English education of the natives, which appeared in the Calcutta papers of 1834. Subsequently to his return home, bis literary productions were chiefly of this class,— »as his review of Professor Wilson’s Sanscrit Dictionary in the Foreign Quarterly^ three essays on the principles of translation, lately published in the Asiatic Journal,* and two other articles more recently, in the same Journal for February and March last,t in which he has corrected the mistakes of an ingenious but speculative writer in the • Vdl,utLpp.89, 196^«adS4S. t VoLsxii.pp.lOSaBd8Sl. 16 The late John TjftUr, Esq^y Quarterly Review, upon the principles of grammatical inflexion. His contributions to the history of mathematical science^ drawn up after his return to England^ have been already mentioned, and besides these he published in the Asiatic Journal for January last, the first of an intended series of papers of a lighter cast, ** Reflections of a Returned Exile/' We have already also alluded to a poetical contribution to the same publication, Lines on Revisiting the Cape,\" and may conclude our review of Mr. Tytler's literary character, with noticing the extraordinary combination of a strong poetical taste, with a passionate love of mathematics and philology. His poetical compositions, as far as they have been published, partake more, perhaps, of the inspiration of feeling than of fancy ; but in the sanguine confidence of his youth, he had projected a task of high emprise — a Poem on the^rescue of Christendom from the impending peril of Mohammedan supremacy in Europe, on the defeat of the Arabs at the battle of Tours, by Charles Martel : a considerable extract from this poem, an episode entitled ‘‘The Fall of Persia, \"appears in a volume of the Bengal Annual, Whatever success might have attended the accomplishment of such a design, the poem would no doubt have presented a picture of oriental manners, characters, and incidents, delineated witli spirit and truth, and would have expressed sentiments of natural feeling and religious fervour. For, amidst Mr. Tytler’s varied acquirements asd occupations, his reli- gious duties were never regarded with indifierence or consigned to neglect. Amongst the books that spread his study-table, the Bible was always present, and not unfrequently in his hand. It accompanied him always to his lectures, and although his piety partook in no degree of inconsiderate or intemperate zeal, he omitted no favourable oppoitunity of bringing to the knowledge of his Mohammedan and Hindu scholars the truths of the Gospel. The doctrines which they would have turned away from in dis- pleasure or resentment, had they been presented to them with indiscretion or pressed upon them with vehemence, they were accustomed to receive from him with attention and reverence, and no murmur was ever heard against the mild but firm tone, in which he rebuked their errors and asserted his own belief. His abhorrence of idolatry was characteristically strong, and at all times strongly pronounced; yet he commanded the respect and enjoyed the attachment of the Hindus. His knowledge of Arabic and Hebrew rendered him a formidable opponent to the professors of Moham- medanism, and he was accustomed to point out to them the plagiarisms aud immoralities of the Koran ; yet such was his candour and his judgment, that be never lost their good opinion, and many of the most learned amongst them, both at Patna and in Calcutta, were to the last days of his Indian existence, his associates and friends. It was his own impression that he had, in some instances, prepared them for the reception of those truths which formed his own support in life and his solace in death. Mr. Tytler died in the island of Jersey, on the 5th of last March, after a severe illness of two months. • ( IT ) FIELD-SPORTS IN INDIA. Obiental field-sports (in comparison with which a fox-chase in Europe it child’s play) are so exciting, not only to the individuals actually engaged in them, but to fire-side travellers also,— who, seated in luxuHous ease at home, delight in the perusal of narrations relating the spirited encounters which their more adventurous brethren have held with the nionarchs of the forest, — that little apology is needed for the number of pages devoted to the subject in the present article. An officer, writing in one of the Indian periodicals of the day, expressing an opinion, certainly with more force than elegance, declares that India without tigers would not be worth — a certain expletive, which means ** less than nothing and this notion seems to be pretty general, to judge by the intense eagerness shewn in the pursuit of this noble sport : for noble it must be called, notwithstanding the alleged cowardice of the aniuial who is the object of it. Though it is true that a tiger will, in most cases, in the first instance, endeavour to get away from its pursuers, yet it very frequently makes a gallant defence, and it will sometimes charge at once upon its opponents, and, with balls rattling around like hail, will meet its death, defying the assail- ants to the last. The character which the early naturalists have ascribed to the lion and the tiger, — the former being represented by them as a noble animal, capable of the most generous conduct, while the latter is described to be without one redeeming trait, cruel from the mere delight in cruelty, — has been disputed by modern writers. The lion, in common with all animals of the feline race, is accustomed to steal upon its prey, and occasional instances may be adduced of its indicating the opinion that the better part of valour is discretion, acting up to this view of the case by an ignominious retreat. But though the lion does not always manifest the splendid qualities with which Bufibn and some others have endowed him, the magnanimity and clemency which he has re- peatedly shewn, fully entitle him ^o the rank in which he has been placed by hik admirers, while they serve also to prove that, notwithstanding the great advances made in some of the branches of zoological science, we may recur with safety to old and almost obsolete works upon natural history, for very faithful delineations of the tempers and dispositions of the different indivi- duals composing the four-footed race. The following details of close encoun- ters with the two superior species of feline monsters, may be relied upon as. authentic. Captain J., a Bombay officer, while out shooting one day with two other friends, in the neighbourhood of Baroda, came unexpectedly upon a tiger. The animal was lying on the opposite side of a small but deep stream, a few yards only from its bushy margin. The sportsmen were on foot, and to their addi- tional horror, they saw the remains of a human corpse frightfully mutilated on the ground beside its destroyer, the unfortunate man having only been killed theday before. Finding himself disturbed, the tiger arose and gazed upon the, intruders, probably for the purpose of determining the selection of the victiin for his next day’s repast, and each officer, being provided with a rifle, lodged its contents, without lQss*of time, in the body of the enemy: the wounded animal fell instantaneously, rolling over on its side as if killed. Not • doubting that the shots had proved mortal, Cap t.J., after taking the precau- tion tb reload his gun, but with slugs instead of ball, the stock of the latter missile having been expended, ran as quickly as he could to a ford, about forty yiurds below the spot from which the rifles were fired. He had waded across Aaittt. Journ, N.S. Vol. 23. No.89. D tbe strcaiDi and was in the act of seizing the boughs of a tree to assist^ his ascent on the opposite bank, when the tiger made his appearance^ and tnere was barely time to cock the gun and to lodge the charge in the breast of tbe assailant, before he was fairly upon the too venturous sportsman, whose otily resource was to fall flat on the ground, whence he never moved^ but ks the tiger chose to piiirhim about in his paws. Although three balls and a charge of slugs were lodged in the body of the brute, he continued this sportive recreation for several minutes. At length, while thus amusing bimsdf, he placed one of his huge fore-fcct upon the mouth of his victim, and retained it there. Capt. J. bore this infliction for some time with the utmost fortitude; losing hope at last that the tiger would voluntarily remove the foot, he caught one toe between his teeth, and bit it with all his force. This bold manoeuvre partly produced the desired effect, but in withdrawing the foot, the tiger pared away part of the flesh of the check, and broke the bridge of the nose. Per- chance somewhat exhausted, the bcas't lay down beside his wounded com- panion, keeping his eyes, however, steadily fixed upon the body, and hostili- ties ceased for tbe present. After a considerable interval had elapsed, in which Capt. J., though bleeding and enduring the severest pain, commanded his siiflerings, neither moving nor appearing to breathe, he espied his com- panions at a short distance on a small piece of rising ground. His wounded sentinel was sfill close beside him, and as watchful as ever ; but now too anxious to procure aid to continue longer in a quiescent state, summoning all his re- maining strength, he called to them loudly for assistance. The tiger was up In an instant, and with open mouth almost in the act of seizing him by tbe throat, but even at this fearful moment, the soldier’s courage and presence of mind did not forsake him, for, almost instinctively, he averted the mortal wound by interposing his left arm, which he doubled, and thrust into the assailant’s mouth. In a moment the bones of the elbow were crushed. Not- withstanding the intense agony produced by this additional injury, not a cry escaped the lips of the sufferer, and the tiger soon disengaged himself from bis hold, making a complete circuit round him, and snifling at the mouth to discover whether he still breathed. During all this time, Capt. J. assumed the semblance of death, holding his breath with the greatest determination. As if satisfied with the experiment, the too sagacious brute moved off to the distance of ten or twelve yards, turning once or twice while in the act of retreating, to see whether he had fully effected his purpose : no movement being perceptible, he paused. Upwards of an hour had now elapsed since the animal had been wounded, and the effects of the shot were now beginning to be very apparent. Capt. J. perceived that the vigilance, which had hitherto proved so active, bad now slackened ; the ferocity of the bea.st was quelled, and, seeming to be in great agony, it fell down, writhing and convulsive, never to rise again. Capt- J. retained his motionless attitude for about a quarter of an hour longer ; and then, assured that the tiger was dead, he arose, and endea- voured to crawl aw ay. The dreadful nature of his wounds rendered this a matter of considerable difficulty ; fortunately, he met some of the peasants of the country, who conveyed him to his tents. His life was despaired of, and during a confinement of nearly five months, consequent upon this dreadful conflict, he suffered very severely.- In fact, the escape with life, after wounds of so dangerous a nature, may be deemed miraculous, while the fact itself might be doubted were it not so fully confirmed, Capt. J. being at this time alive to tell the tale, and to impress, by the result of his own experience, the' expediency of preserving presence of mind, while in (he fangs ora tiger. FiM- Sports in India. 19 ^ .Anpther case upon record was attended by less fnghtful circumstances. An pfjficer of the Bengal army was seized by a tiger and carried off. Fortunately, hi3 gun was carried off with him, and the barrels getting jammed between the animal's teeth, prevented the jaws from closing, and caused so much incon- venience that he was eventually compelled to drop his prey. The gun, as it may well be imagined, is kept as a trophy ; it displays on the inner side of one of the barrels a visible indentation, caused by the tooth of the savage : the officer escaped with a severe flesh-wound. An almost incredible instance of presence of mind, accompanying great personal strength, the writer heard related by the party himself, who bore on bis countenance a testimony of its truth. About thirty years ago. Colonel D., of the Bengal service, a man of great bodily power, and nearly seven feet high, being out on a hunting expedition, happened to be on foot, separated from his party, carrying a gun which he had omitted to have reloaded, when, casting his eye towards a rising ground on one side, he perceived a tiger in the act of springing upon him. Almost mechanically (for there was hardly time for thought), he dropped his useless gun, opened his arms, received his foe with a bear-like hug, and literally squeezed him to death. One paw of the heast alone was at liberty, and with this, in his dying agonies, he scraped the flesh off the coloners check. The tiger was a young one, but old enough to have contended with ordinary human game. The great dissimilarity said to exist between the disposition of the tiger and that of the lion, receives a strong exeniplilication in the following narrative, which will shew that Buffon did not without sufficient grounds maintain, that the lion, to pride, courage, and strength, added greatness, and sometimes clemency ; while the tiger, on the contrary, is fierce without provocation, and cruel without necessity. The opinion of this great naturalist has been so frequently derided, that it is gratifying to be able to afford the following inte- resting illustration of the truth of his characteristic definition. The adventure befel three officers a few years 'ago in Guzerat. Capt. D., Mr. W. and a friend, who shall be without name or initial, went out one afternoon, mounted on an elephant, to beat for lions. They had not proceeded far into the jungle before they encountered one of these animals, anil shot it dead. Scarcely had the guns been re-loaded, when a scout gave intimation of a second lion being close at hand. Anxious to obtain the mo.st accurate intelligence respecting the exact place in which the noble game was to be found, one of the party de- scended from the howdah, mounted a horse, which his servant was leading in the rear, and dashed off. Scarcely had he proceeded a hundred yards, in the direction pointed out by the scout, before he found himself pursued by the very animal of which he was in search. Repenting the indiscretion which had placed him in this predicament, prudence dictated the propriety of enlarging the distance between them ; and, putting spurs to his horse, he galloped at its utmost speed, and making a detour over the ground, soon got through the heavy jungle and rejoined the elephant, on whose back the rash adventurer w^s but too happy to regain a safe footing. Having, at considerable risk to himself, obtained information of a very interesting nature, the head of the elephant was turned in the direction which the lion had taken, and the party moved forward. The fates were propitious, affording sport which might be triumphantly adduced, in some future argument, touching the great superiority of th^ jiop hunt over that of the tiger. Almost before they could venture to upon bis footsteps, their courageous foe was , perceived advancing boldly td^ards them. When the noble animal had approached within twenty 20 Fields Sporis in India. yards of the elephant, which stood the charge .remi^rkably well, each man fired, every ball, according to subsequent examiiiatton^UdLing e^ct. Had the con* tents of the barrels been perfectly innoxious, they could not have been received with more indifference ; not a single moment did the lion pause in his career, and advancing, if possible, with greater determination than before, he gave a spring, and fastened on the trunk and face of the elephant. The mahout was fortunately a courageous fellow, accustomed to similar encounters. Giving utterance to a few of the choicest anatheinata, in which the Indian vernacular is so rich, he began to hammer away at his assailant’s head with the ankooscy the iron crook employed by him to guide the colossal animal under his charge. The lion, not altogether relishing this kind of discipline, let go his hold, dropped on the ground, and sprung on the hind-quarters of the elephant, and in so doing nearly dragged one of the sportsmen over. While engaged in this close conflict, the occupants of the howdah were not idle; a gun was hastily re- loaded, and discharged, muzzle up, into the body of the lion, wdio immediately fell from the elephant, which, feeling itself free, made off at a round pace. As soon as the terrified creature could be brought to a halt, Mr. W. determined, to dismount, and go in search of the valiant foe on foot. Finding all attempts at dissuasion fruitless, his two companions generously resolved to accompany him, and accordingly all three alighted, and on reaching the field of battle, found the lion on his legs again, facing them with a bold front, but, evidently, as they thought, the worse for the balls which had been lodged in his body. Each man advanced steadily till within a few paces of the animal, when Capt. D. fired off both his barrels. At this renewal of hostilities, the lion, instead of. attacking his first assailant, dashed at once on Mr. W., who discharged his right-hand barrel, but had not time to pull the trigger of the left. Raising himself on his hind legs, in a rampant attitude, the enraged beast sprang right upon the adversary whom he had singled out. At this, the third individual of the party lost all presence of mind; he had borne up manfully until now, but . his nerves could bear no more ; so turning round, he flung himself on bis face in the thickest bush he could find, and lay there as still as n mouse. Nothing daunted, Mr. W. entered at once into a personal conte.st with his powerful antagonist, employing the gun in his defence, which |)rovcd of essential service, although at length the lion’s strength prevailed, and he got the luckle.ss sports- man fairly under him. At this critical moment, Cupt. 1). found that his gun was disabled ; after several ineffectual efforts to discharge it, he was obliged to make his way out of the jungle to procure assistance. The* lion, during the whole of this time, as if content with having obtained the victory, did not offer to molest his vanquished foe : in other words, to his greatness he added clemency. Night was now approaching, the sun had disappeared, and the transitory twilight of an Indian evening had flung its veil over the scene. Capt. D., stimulated by the imminent danger of his friend, exerted himself very strenuously in the restoration of his gun to a serviceable condition, and having succeeded, he returned as quickly as possible, stealing cautiously through the brushwood as he drew near the eventful spot. Tremblingly alive to the appre- hensions suggested by the fearful situation of his companions, the cheering words uttered in an audible whisper, ‘‘ A little more to the right. Dal,” restored, all fiis self-possession. In another instant. Captain D. perceived the lion standing close beside the prostrate body, which he had watched so sedulously. Creeping a foot or two nearer, he once more took a deliberate aim, and firing at the gallant beast, it fell instantly dead on the ground. Mr. W., bmng unin- sured, was able to ride home to the tents, to receive the warm congratulations Field Sports in India. 21 of his brother officWs upon his providential escape. On opening the body of the lion, no fewer than nine bails were found lodged in different directions, the last shot alone piercing a vital part, though in all probability a more lingering death would have ensued from the preceding wounds. The tenacity of life, displayed in the foregoing instances by the tiger and the lion, is also shared by the wild boar, whose strength and ferocity renders it an enemy nearly as deadly. The danger attending an encounter with one of these savage animals, and the necessity of being quite assured that the vital spark is extinct, before a too close approach, may be gathered from the following detail of a single combat between a sportsman and a wild hog. A party left Calcutta in a boat, on a December morning, for the purpose of shooting wild ducks. They proceeded down the Hooghly, and the tide being against them during the early part of the day, their progress was slow. On the second morning, in- stead of striving against the current, two of the party determined to land on the low marshy bank of the river, to beat the cover for snipes ; one of the gentlemen, however, soon got tired and returned back to the boat, and the other, while pursuing the sport, espied a green pigeon in a bush, which over- hung the long thick grass surrounding him on every side. He fired, and the bird dropped. 11 is single attendant ran forward to bag the game, but was arrested in his progress, when w’ithin a few yards of the tree, by perceiving that he had been anticipated by a wild boar, who, having taken up a station beneath its shade, was now making a slight repast upon the dead bird. The boy turned back, in the greatest alarm, to acquaint his master with the circumstance, who by this time had reloaded his gun. The report which he brought was verified by an audible grunt from the griz/ly brute himself, and the former charge being replaced by a ball, the operation was scarcely completed before the hog came. out from among the grass and rattans, in which he had been concealed, and took up a position in the narrow path, a few yards only from the place in which the gentleman and his servant were standing. To see and be off was the work of a moment with the latter. The boar grunted and foamed, but did not choose to become the aggressor ; so, after eyeing his new acquaintance for some minutes, he turned about to resume his old quarters. An oppor- tunity like this was deemed to be too good to be lost, so at the moment in which the side was fully exposed, the leaden contents of the gun were lodged in it, and the wounded animal tumbled over on his side, the blood flowing in a . copious stream from an orifice near the shoulder. Running up to the game, as it lay motionless upon the ground, the sportsman began to consider how he might best convey it to the boat, in order that the cook should, without loss of time, employ his skill upon the different joints. The current of his thoughts was, however, destined to undergo a serious change. When within five yards of each other, the supposed lifeless boar jumped on his legs, and charged furiously at his assailant. Flight, if such an alternative were contemplated, was out of the question, for the path being narrow, and the grass and rattans on either side extremely high, an escape could not be effected in that direction. It became necessary, therefore, to engage in a personal conflict, and seizing the gun by the barrel, the sportsman wielded it aloff in the air, and as the bleeding monster came on, dealt a blow upon the head, by which the stock was shivered, and the barrel forced out of the hand. The shock proved sufficient to stun the boar ; and now, being without any means of defence, the assailant jumped ove^ the body of his foe, and ran for his life. He had not proceeded more than fifty paces before he espied the boar a second time up, and in search of him. In another instant fte was giving chace, and notwithstanding the quantity M . Field- Sports in India. of bipod whic^^Ad oozed away, was coming along at a Ibarfully rapid rate, il^p.jbcilitate bis Aight by lightening himself of pvery incumbrance, oiir friend tihrew off his coat and strained every nerve to keep a-head. The exertion proved unavailing ; the hog gained upon him rapidly, and a few yards alone divided the pursuer from the pursued. Human strength had yielded to the efforts made in self-preservation ; the tongue, dry and fevered, clove to the roof of the mouth, and all hope of a successful issue to the adventure seemed at an end. At that moment, a small mango tree, a few paces off the path» in- spired the fainting man with new hope. The hog was not more than three yards in the rear, and, making a desperate effort to reach this place of refuge, he seized a branch, and was in the act of swinging himself into the tree, when the enemy came and caught him by the trowser. The cloth fortunately gave way, and though pulled down, the sportsman was enabled to biiifle his invete- rate assailant by jumping round and round the tree. After practising this manoeuvre for some time, a favourable moment having presented itself, he took a leap, and gained, what he considered to be a safe position, among the boughs. This, however, proved oiilj’ a temporary asylum ; no sooner did the boar comprehend the circumstances of the case, than with truly piggish per- severance, he resolved to have his enemy down. The tree unluckily happened to be a very young one, and the hog rushing at it, employing his head as the battering-engine, it went over into the gully or ditch beside it : the hog and the man, at the same time, rolling pell-mell amongst its branches. By great good fortune, the fortiicr gut upperiiio.st, and seized his grizzly antagonist by the throat. The animal struggled to free himself, hut the efforts were ineffec- tual, the weight of his enemy’s body, pressing heavily on the carcase, caused the blood to flow from the gun-shot wound, rendering tlie dying struggles weaker and weaker. In the course of a few minutes, a slight jerking of the limbs alone indicated the determination of the conquered boar to resist to the last, and death speedily closed the scene. The e.\\crtions made by the victor had been so desperate, that upwards of an hour elapsed, after the destruction of the animal, before he could move from the bunk on which he lay panting from fatigue. It is probable that he would have remained much longer in a recumbent attitude, had not his fViei]d.s, alarmed by his absence, and the report of his attendant, gone out in search of him. By their assistance, he was enabled to rise and return to the bout, and while walking to the river, in order to revive his exhausted spirits, they paraded his late formidable antagonist before him, lashed to a bamboo, and carried by eight coolies. The manner in which tiger-hunting is pursued in Bengal, with battalions of elephants and multitudes of men, is somewhat enviously characterised by the Anglo-Indians of the other Presidencies as tame and inglorious, compared with their more daring exploits on font. The Bengallees, however, though ^'refer- ring to take the field with all the advantages which a splendid suwarree can afford, do not object «to an occasional expedition made under less favourable circumstances. Should an European officer, either civil or military, be within cally on the invasion by a tiger of a village, &c., his services are immediately put into requisition, or, rather, he is implored to render his assistance, and the; appeal is pretty certain to be successful. A young military man, halting &r the day on a march through a wild part of the country,* was disturbed at his breakfast by a deputation from the neighbouring village, who informed him that a tiger had made his appearance in the open day, and bad^alreadjf A^veruly . injured two individuals ; moreover, that, although several shots had. J^ijin fired at the intruder by one of their best marksmen, the bails must certmnly have Fields SporU in India. 23 been bewitched, since not one of them told. In India, as in Ge|:many, bullets, it is said, are apt to go ** ^kew,** in consequence of the succesaJlf some polfrer- ful incantation. The young man, to whom nothing of the kind ever came- amiss, armed himself with a couple of double-barrelled guns, and hastened to the scene of action. Upon his arrival in the village, he found the whole com- munity, as it may well be imagined, in a state of the greatest excitement, and completely uproarious ; every body saw the tiger, or fancied they saw it, and were continually raising false alarms; numbers, perched in the trees, or mounted on the roofs of houses, pointed out this ubiquitous animal from half- a-dozen points at once, while streams of people rushed screaming through the different avenues, declaring that the tiger was at their heels. At length, the young man succeeded in his endeavour to discover the position which the monster had taken u[), espying him under a small clump of trees, which adorned the yard or garden belonging to a hut. The cottages of the natives being in general tolerably pervious to light and air, the adventurer found no difficulty in thrusting his gun through the matting which composed the walls, and succeeded in lodging a bullet in the neck of the tiger. Roaring with pain and anger, he sprang towards the hut, but not seeing his assailant, turned and made for a patch of jungle; the villagers flying like a routed army on every side. It now became necessary to gain some elevated place, as he was com- pletely concealed by the long grass and brushwood covering the aforesaid patch of jungle, and for that purpose the sportsman cautiously approached a jack tree, which grew upon a convenient spot. While in the act of climbing the tree, the tiger, who had caught a glimpse of his enemy, came out, and reduced the sportsman to the necessity of confronting him face to face. He had fortunately ticne to level his gun, and fire; the bullet brought him down, but, in the course of a few seconds, he rose again, wheeling round and round, in the passion and agony of the moment. The second barrel was now fired, and with eflect, wounding him, but still not mortally. The fury of the animal increased, but it was fortunately aM)lind fury, which, after wasting itself upon the trees, was directed to some spectators, who, being at a considerable dis- tance made such good use of their legs as soon to be beyond reach. Most fortunately, he did not make towards the principal aggressor, who, with both barrels discharged, would have been in an awkward predicament. With two balls in the neck and one in the head, he still seemed to possess undiminished strength ; but, perhaps desiring a cessation of hostilities, he now retreated to a cow-stall, whither he was followed by the officer, who, having reloaded, hoped to give him his quietut. While endeavouring to cut a hole through the bamboo-wall (if it may so be called) of this shed, the tiger rushed furiously against it, obliging the operator to make a rapid flight, and at length pushing his head and fore-paws through the fence, presented a good mark, and at the distanch of about eight paces received another bullet through the ear. He now broke down the hut, sprang out, roaring furiously, and plunging into a neigh- bouring garden, crouched down among some bushes. A plantain tree offering the best cover that could be procured, the young officer placed himself behind it; the tiger caught sight of his adversary, and getting up, looked at him growling, but fell upon receiving the last bullet, which lodged in the jaws, amashing the teeth. He never rose again, and, perceiving his disabled con- dition! the villagers crowded round with clubs, hammering away, to make assurance doubly sure. He was the largest tiger which the people at that place had ever seen, and must certainly be said to have died game; having received five wounds, every one of which might be supposed to be mortal. Fidd-Sporis in India. Leopards are not usualljr much sought after ; they, however, sometimes afford good sport, and may be considered, in every sense of the word, true game. There is a record of one which required elephants to subdue. Riding out one morning, an officer was informed that a bang (the native name) had taken up his quarters near the houses of some ryots, and had badly wounded three persons. The horse’s head was of course immediately turned in the direction, and the proper weapons being obtained, the officer climbed the thatch of a large bam, whence he could command a view of the surrounding jungle, and obtaining a glimpse of the animal’s head, fired, and out came the leopard, with a roar. The second barrel unluckily would not go off, anchit became necessary to make a speedy descent. Loading again, the officer fol- lowed his game to a bamboo thicket, in which it had crouched. After some ineffectual attempts to procure a glimpse of him, he started up, and received another bullet, the marksman retreating as he came out. Though flying at his utmost speed, the leopard gained upon him, a roar sounded in his ear, and in another moment he was knocked down. No inconvenience ensued from the tumble, except a few inconsiderable scratches, and the damage of the wearer’s habiliments, from dirt and blood ; for the leopard passed on. The scratches he gave in his charge being, as before stated, inconsiderable, the quantity of blood left upon the garments proved that the animal had been severely wounded. The gun was knocked out of the sportsman’s hand in the fall, and became in consequence unserviceable, a circumstance which was not discovered until an awkward moment. The sportsman having mounted his horse, rode up to a piece of jungle, to which the leopard had retreated ; he came out in good style, but as the gun would not go off at the time of need, a few springs having brought him within five yards of his assailant, the latter was compelled to put his spurs into the steed, and ride for his life. The speed of the horse soon distanced the pursuer, who again sought the jungle^ and it was now dis- covered that the ball he had received had shattered his jaw, a wound which, in all probability, saved his opponent’s life, who would not otherwise have escaped with a few scratches. Having now retreated from the open country, and gained the depths of the jungle, it became useless to make any farther attempt without elephants. The whole population of the neighbourhood, interested in the destruction of the savage, were up in arms, and readily undertook to watch the jungle, and prevent his escape, while the officer returned home to make preparatioTis for the engagement. Having breakfasted, and ascertained the efficiency of his weapons, he repaired again to the jungle, where he found only one elephant, and that by no means staunch, since the mahout declared it would not face any wild beast of the kind. The representations of tho natives do not usually receive much attention from Europeans, and the officer, too impatient to be ruled, mounted the pad, there being no howdah, and obliged the mahout to force an entrance into the jungle. After trumpetting, spurning the ground, and various other indications of ill-temper, the animal having caught sight of its whiskered enemy, rushed at it, and in the scuffle that ensued, it was with some difficulty that the rider maintained his seat : while it was quite impossible to fire. The leopard sprang upon the elephant’s trunk, and wounded it with his claws ; but speedily dropped, and, rid of this incumbrance, the latter animal made off^ and could not he brought to the ch^C^e again. It became now necessary to await the arrival of better disci* (Aided assistants, and at length two other elephants made their appearance, to the great joy of the whole assembly, who received them with acclamatipns. Again mounting, the sportsman entered the jungle, but the elephant employed* 'Hi' I c*. Field- Sports in Indian S5 in the first instance, having been imprudently admitted to assist in beating^ communicated its terrors to the others, and retreated en masie, and with so little precaution, that one, on whose back the leader of the party was mounted;; got into a hole, fell, and pitched his rider within a few yards of the leopards, luckily, at the time, in full retreat to the other end of the jungle. Again the elephants were brought up, and the persevering adventurer got a fair shot at the enemy, who was crouching at the root of a tree; he roared and made an attempt to charge, but was evidently in no condition to follow it up. The elephants, however, were of a different opinion, for they scampered off, and could with difficulty be brought to the rencontre again. The day wearing away very fast, the officer, finding the elephants so inefficient, and being certain that the leopard could now be easily kept at bay, persuaded the people to beat the cover themselves, and, dismounting, led them on. The rattling of the canes, and the growling of the harassed animal, struck a panic into all; but, having succeeded in affording their leader a view of bis prize, he fired, and rolled the leopard over, who, biting the earth for the last time, graced a triumph ren- dered glorious from the spirited nature of the resistance. Tigers, which have escaped from some former hunt, become exceedingly cunning; equalling in their stratagems the craftiness of the fox, they frequently double back to the place whence they were first started, and taking advantage of every convenient cover to hide, keeping close, and in silence, as if aware of the danger of betraying their proximity by a sound. When provided with some impenetrable haunt, they only quit it occasionally in search of prey; probably when game runs short, and the cattle of the cultivated plains offer too strong a temptation to be resisted. Some, particularly wary, scarcely stay for more than one meal ; while others, not having had the advantage of expe- rience, pleased with the readiness with which bullocks are procured, remain until they rouse the whole country against them. When human life has been sacrificed to gratify the appetite of one of these monsters, the anxiety to destroy the brute is generally hei^tened, partly from a justifiable spirit of revenge, and partly from a notion, not without some foundation, that, having once tasted human flesh, it is afcefw'ards preferred to any other. A tigress having pulled a European gentleman out of his howdah, killing him on the spot, and escaping herself unharmed, her death became the object of very strong desire upon the part of every body acquainted with the circumstance. Several attempts were made, which proved unsuccessful, and no tigers having been seen in the neighbourhood for a long time, it was concluded that the place was deserted. The natives, however, persisted in declaring that they were visited by an old tiger occasionally, which they described to be in a diseased condition, and also by a tigress, which, from the account they gave, was supposed to be the one that had killed Mr. E. Both these creatures were very wary, appearing seldom, and then only to kill and devour their prey, which, if affording a second meal, was despatched in haste. The faint hopes thus held out induced a party to beat the covers in search of the tigress, who had taken up her quarters in a forest situated in a district to the westward of Dacca. After two days of disappointment, a report was brought to the hun- ters* boats, that a bullock had been newly slain, and that the slayer was not far off. The mangled carcase being discovered, a view was also obtained of the tigress ; she evaded her pursuers in a manner which proved that she knew what she was obout^ and which rendered them very doubtful of ultimate suc- cess. Crossing the river at some distance a-bead, two shots, which were fired after her, fell short, and bounding up the oppo.sfte bank at two splendid Asfat, Jt?wrw.N.S,V’oL.23.No. 89. E 29 . Field'-.Sports in India, disappeared. No alternative remained but to dismantle the bowdah-ele« phants^ who could not cross the river with their cumbrous paraphernalia, swim them over, and .re-equip them on the other side, a necessity which occasioned considerable loss of time. These obstacles, however, only served to stimu- late the party, who were determined, if it were possible, to follow up to the death the savage which had dipped its fangs in human blood. After some beating, the hunters fell upon the track of their prey, and no veteran fox could shew more adroitness in eluding the pursuit. For a considerable time, she contrived to keep out of the range of the guns, and, at length, an almost hopeless attempt succeeded. She had been evidently hit by a ball, and a second, a long shot from a ride, also took effect. She bounded away over a piece of rising ground, but, feeling herself wounded, paused, and as if muster- ing all her remaining strength for a final cdiirt, charged down upon the line. Singling out the party from whom she had received the first ball, she sprang upon the elephant, clawing him so severely that the contortions which he made hurst open the door of the howdah, one of the guns went overboard, and the rider would have followed, had he not held on, like an old sailor in a rolling ship. He could do nothing to extricate his elephant, but his friends soon gave the assailant the coup dc grace^ and life seemed to be literally knocked out of her, as she fought, never yielding till, the vital spirit failing suddenly, she dropped down dead. The natives present declared the tigress to be the same animal which had killed Mr.E.; she was rather smaU, but remarkably compact* completely answering the description given of her; while those of the party who had gained considerable experience in the sport, were quite certain, by the atyle of her manoeuvres, that she had been hunted before. Some idea of the quantity of tigers still to be found in particular parts of Bengal may be gathered from the account of a grand btUlue^ in which twenty- one were killed in the course of fifteen days. The party assembled, with a goodly line of elephants, and no lack of guns and ammunition, and had the pleasure of hearing, the very day of their arrival at the hunting ground, that a tigress and two large cubs were to be found in a nullah close to the tents. The whelps were soon disposed of, though they proved nearly half-grown ; but the tigress gave more trouble. She was at length found in a small patch of jungle, which, being situated in the mid.st of an open plain, afforded many advantages to the sportsmen. Easily roused from her lair, the tigress got up, and shewed herself, and instantly, receiving a shot, came down the whole line, and then being desperately wounded, and in no condition to shew fight, bounded away to the distance of fifty yards, when her farther career being arrested by a mortal wound, she rolled over. It is not often that the whole of the scene, from the starting to the death, is thus exhibited to the lookers-on ; for when the grass is high and the jungle thick, few of the individuals belonging to a large party get more than a glimpse oi even the larger game. Shifting their quarters, the following day, the party came upon another tigress, which bad killed a cow for her evening meal ; the newly slain carcase of the quadruped lying beside two bleached human skeletons, which were probably the relics of aome former massacre. The tigress got up before one of the elephants, causing *SO great an alarm, that the animal swerved, and its rider missed his mark. She went off, and after a run of a couple of miles, doubled back, and being put up, dived down into the bed of a nullah, whence, on farther distur- jimee, she emerged with a sharp roar, attempted to charge, but falling short, jipiis shot in an endeavour to retreat to the nullah. After padding the. tigress, party returned to the place which they had beaten in the morning, and put Field*Sports in India, iT iip a large tiger, who shewed fight, seizing one of the elephants by the hind leg/ The hunters had got into what in America would be 8tyled‘*a pretty consi- derable awkward fix the ravine pr nullah, being at least twelve feet deep; and much overgrown by trees, it was, therefore, very difficult for the party to act in concert, and though they were aware, by the growling of the tiger, and the flight of the pad elephants, observed to be in full retreat, that sharp work was going on, no shots being fired, they knew not whether the tiger had not the best of it. At length, they heard a shot, and saw the brute making oiT ; two of the party who were within reach sent balls after him, which produced no visible effect ; they followed up, however, but only one of the caparisoned elephants, and that the wounded one, being on the same side of the nullah, could act. After being hardly pressed, the tiger charged again, and drove the whole squad before him. The other elephants were now directed to cross, those which had stood the first brunt of the battle having had enough of it, and swerving whenever their riders endeavoured to induce them to make an attempt to dislodge the enemy, now occupying a position, selected with great judgment, in a deep hole under the spreading roots of a rotten tree. Unac- quainted with the nature of the tiger’s retreat, the crossing the nullah became a very nervous business. On such occasions, the howdahs are inevitably brought upon a level with the steep banks of the ravine, thus affording a neighbouring tiger an opportunity of helping himself to one of the inmates. The difficulty, in the present instance, was so great, that it was necessary to send the pad elephants a-Uead, to act as pioneers, and break down some of the trees which impeded the passage. No farther assurance of the exciting nature of tlie scene of warfare can be needed, since, even without the addition of the tiger being at bay, or prowting near to take his opportunity of a seizure, the crashing and tearing down of the trees by the huge animals instructed to clear the path, the shouts of the people, and the cheers of the sportsmen, formed altogether a coup d*ceil of the most animating description.
