It examines the Cretan revolts of 1896 and 1897 in detail, and then analyses the establishment of the autonomous government and the withdrawal of the Ottoman troops from the island. The main purpose of this book is, therefore, to discuss the overall raison d’être of these revolts as well as the causes of the unsatisfactory conditions within Cretan society, and their direct social and political effects on the lives of Cretans. It also aims to demonstrate how the situation was perceived by Ottoman statesmen and what kind of counter-measures were proposed and employed by the Ottoman administration. However, this book is not concerned with explaining all the political and social dynamics affecting the island during this period. In other words, it does not claim to include and cover every detail of Ottoman rule of the island in the late nineteenth century. Rather, it explores one of the most sensitive and turbulent years by focusing on the underlying reasons and determining factors that led the Cretan Christians to rebel against the Ottoman administration in 1896 and 1897. Therefore, the basic aim of this book is to examine the last three years of actual Ottoman rule in Crete by placing special emphasis upon the Cretan revolts of 1896 and 1897 so as to arrive at a more comprehensive understanding. At the same time, this book not only provides a detailed picture of the power relations, both at local and imperial levels, but also depicts the relationship of the late Ottoman state to its Cretan subjects. The book seeks to provide a profile of the so-called ‘nationalist liberation struggle’ of Cretan Christians and attempts to analyse how\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 1\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:36 PM\n\n2\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nthey were politicised and nationalised, and why they engaged in rebellious activities. Furthermore, it argues that the Cretan revolts of 1896 and 1897 dramatically altered the status quo and laid the groundwork for the transformation of the local structure and the establishment of autonomous government in Ottoman Crete, and then for the separation of the island from the Ottoman Empire. In other words, these revolts altered the internal dynamics within the island, and the relationship between the island and the Ottoman state, and shaped the post-Ottoman era. To understand the causes behind the conflict and violence at that time, this book seeks to find answers to the following questions: How were the Cretan Christians politicised and nationalised? What did the list of Cretan Christians’ grievances include? Why did they include a national context? How did the revolts happen? How were the revolts financed? What kind of government did the insurgents desire? Where did the revolts occur (rural or urban areas)? What was their scope (wide-spread or local and limited)? How long did they last? When did the Cretan Christians rebel? Why did they choose that particular time? What were the effects of these revolts on the Cretans? This book concentrates primarily on how Ottoman statesmen evaluated the internal conflicts within the island and the kind of measures and policies they proposed. It is my contention that the Ottoman statesmen were aware of the dangers threatening the survival of the Ottoman Empire and the sovereignty of the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II. I argue that they responded in various ways and made great efforts to avert the marginalisation of Ottoman power in Crete. Among the most important findings in the Ottoman archives have been materials documenting the long reports and memoranda of Ottoman statesmen, which reveal much about how these statesmen perceived the internal conditions and inhabitants of Crete. The variety of the material which has been provided goes beyond the information and findings available from the other sources and will make an exclusive contribution to the literature. Unlike the existing literature, by arguing that the developments in Ottoman Crete were essentially unique, this book suggests that it is necessary to understand both coexistence and violence in Ottoman\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 2\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:36 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nCrete within the context of the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire. In other words, the Cretan revolts and inter-communal relations in Ottoman Crete are to be analysed through an integrative approach in which both local and imperial dynamics have to be considered. As was the case in other multi-ethnic empires, Muslims and non-Muslims lived side-by-side in the Ottoman Empire, with common and mutual economic, social and political interests and goals. Despite their seemingly irreconcilable differences, they maintained integrated social and economic lives due to their common interests. It is important to keep in mind that inter-communal relations in Ottoman Crete were both unique and part of a broader world. This approach enables us to understand the dynamics of Cretan society and at the same time to better evaluate the broader causes behind the Cretan revolts. By examining this period, this book also aims to reveal the extent to which Ottoman Crete was incorporated into the fold of the Greek mainland. It is interesting to note that after the establishment of the Greek Kingdom (1830), the infiltration of Greek national ideology into Cretan society helped shape the trajectories of politics and led to the gradual transformation of the island into part of the Greek world. The Greek state’s irredentist policies and ideological and cultural infiltrations played a vital role in introducing the modern Greek identity to Ottoman Crete. In other words, the Cretan Christians were gradually indoctrinated by the idea of belonging to an ‘imagined community’. As was the case in many other modernising societies of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, schools emerged as an important means for indoctrinating the Christian pupils with the concept of ‘Greekness’. The circulation of journals, periodicals and pamphlets contributed par excellence to the formation of modern Greek identity among the Christian inhabitants of the island. The following chapters will also demonstrate that ad hoc committees, both on the island and in Greece, were crucial in this process. Ideological and financial backing for the Cretan revolts was organised by the members of Cretan and Greek committees in Athens. The assistance of those committees, in certain cases in cooperation with the Greek government, provided the material and financial resources of the Cretan insurgents.\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 3\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\n4\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nTheories of Nationalism and Conceptual Framework Until the 1960s, primordialism1 was the dominant ideology in the Balkan nationalist historiography. Accordingly, in this context, conventional writings on Balkan nationalism often considered the Ottoman period as ‘dark age’, and the model applied for the writing of history was the confrontation and conflict between the ‘ruler’ and ‘ruled’; between the ‘oppressor’ and the ‘oppressed’. The sufferings of the region’s Christians were regarded as ‘tales of martyrdom’, ‘national resistance’, and ‘the heroism of the Christians’ against ‘the infidel Muslim oppressor’.2 Moreover, this conventional view did not provide a detailed perspective on the structure of Ottoman governance but merely generalised Ottoman rule in the Balkans under the name of Tourkokratia (‘Ottoman rule’). On the basis of such stereotypes, the motivations for the rise of nationalism and nationalist, separatist movements in the Balkans have been variously explained by conventional historians. Many books on Balkan nationalism, for instance SetonWatson’s The Rise of Nationality in the Balkans, simply demarcated the Ottoman Empire along religious lines, Muslims and non-Muslims, and ethnic and religious factors were seen as the main reasons for the rise of nationalism in the Empire.3 In other words, ethno-religious factors have typically been viewed as the primary reason for the rise of nationalist movements and the events have been seen as a confrontation between two religious groups. Those scholars understood and described these movements in ethno-religious terms and interpreted them as reflections of ‘primordial hatreds’, and instituted certain projects that sought to address nationalist movements according to these terms.4 The conflicts that prevailed throughout the Ottoman Balkans were analysed within the context of the ‘national-awakening’ paradigm, and nationalist historians attempted to explain the underlying reasons for these conflicts as the reflections of the ‘awakening’ of the ‘subjugated’ peoples.5 In addition, some contemporary historians claim that the wars which took place in the Balkans in the 1990s were nothing more than ‘ethnic conflicts’. Maria Todorova, for instance, has argued that the so-called ‘ethnic conflicts’ between the Balkan peoples were the result of the Ottoman legacy.6\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 4\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nIn a similar vein, Greek conventionalist historiography has typically depicted Ottoman rule as a ‘period of tyranny and slavery’ for the Greek nation. It was a ‘period of vicious and inhumane slavery, which lasted for four centuries, during which the Greeks lost every sense of civilization, as they were subjected to brutality.’7 All the blame was cast on the shoulders of Ottoman rule, which was referred to as ‘the Turkish yoke’: ‘Greece was the first Balkan country to achieve independence ... from the Ottoman yoke. This was the product of a long and arduous struggle against the conqueror.’8 And what is more, the Ottoman Sultan was referred to as a ‘tyrant’.9 In this context, the Ottoman period in the Balkans in general and on the island of Crete in particular has been regarded as a ‘source of cultural pollution’ and the Ottoman Empire has been perceived as non-Western and Islamic. Thus, its domination is considered to have been of an imitative and derivative nature. Needless to say, this sort of historiography has been discredited for decades. As noted by James Gelvin, nationalist studies have been subjected to various alterations in the last two decades. New methodological approaches and comparative analyses have been introduced and essential categories such as ‘nation’, ‘nationalism’, and ‘national identity’ have been studied within the framework of unconventional analytical methods. Contemporary scholars in the field of nationalist studies made various attempts to deconstruct teleological approaches of state-sponsored nationalisms and official nationalist histories. In this way, new phrases such as ‘the invention of tradition’, and ‘peasants into Frenchmen’ became commonplace in the academic discourse on nationalism. Today, it is common for historians to argue that identity is not ‘fixed’,10 but rather a ‘fluid, historically rooted construct; boundaries created between groups and loyalties cultivated to groups frequently shift and change’.11 In addition, the shift from primordialist to constructivist theories of nationalism opened the way for the ‘belief that nations are created and a relatively new phenomenon in world history’.12 Unlike the primordialists, Ernest Gellner has remarked that ‘nationalism is a very distinctive species of patriotism, and one which becomes pervasive and dominant only under certain conditions, which\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 5\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\n6\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nin fact prevail in the modern world, and nowhere else’.13 He argues that nationalist movements create nations and not vice-versa. In other words, nations do not create nationalism. For Gellner, ‘nationalism is not the awakening of nations to self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist’.14 It is clear that nationalism is an entirely modern phenomenon and the product of the modern industrial world.15 The transition from agrarian societies to modern industrial ones is the key factor in understanding the emergence of nationalism. The replacement of ‘low’ by ‘high’ cultures played a crucial role in this transition. Gellner asserts that ‘high culture’ is inculcated through a mass, standardised and academy-supervised education system and defines a nation ‘as a society with a high culture that is a specially cultivated, standardized, education-based, literate culture’.16 Benedict Anderson has located the origins of the modern nation historically at the junction of three developments in the Western European world. These are: the decline of religious communities and of dynastic realms, and a fundamental change in the conceptions of time. Finally, the advent of large-scale commercial book publishing, or what Anderson calls ‘print-capitalism’, made it possible more than anything else ‘for rapidly growing numbers of people to think about themselves, and to relate themselves to others, in profoundly new ways’; that is, in ‘national’ terms.17 What follows, first, is the presentation of the contemporary problematic which is generally related to ethnic and national conflicts or minority and autonomy rights. Then, in order to be able to address the related questions as to whether ‘nationalisms’ should be understood as ‘inherited’ and ‘real’ or as ‘invented’ and ‘imagined’, and how we should understand the ways in which nationalisms manipulate history, Anderson’s concept of nation as an ‘imagined community’ and its ‘cultural roots’ will be explored. Finally, in reference to the actual problematic, some conclusions will be inferred from the perspectives presented. Benedict Anderson argues that nationalism emerged towards the end of the eighteenth century as a result of the ‘spontaneous distillation of a complex “crossing” of discrete historical forces’, and that, once created, they became models which could be used in a great variety of\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 6\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\nideologies.18 However, a persuasive explanation of nationalism should not confine itself to specifying the cultural and political factors that facilitate the growth of nations. Rather, the real challenge lies in showing why and how these particular cultural artifacts have aroused such deep attachments ‘that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings’.19 In other words, the crucial question is: ‘what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history ... generate such colossal sacrifices?’20 Before addressing this question, Benedict Anderson tries to offer a workable definition of ‘nation’ (and therefore nationalism). This is because there is, according to Anderson, a terminological confusion surrounding the concept of nation or nationalism which is partly caused by the tendency to treat it as an ideological construct. Things would be easier if it is seen as belonging to the same family as ‘kinship’ or ‘religion’. Hence, his definition of the nation is ‘an imagined political community – and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign’.21 It is imagined, because ‘the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their communion’.22 It is imagined as limited, because each nation has finite boundaries beyond which lie other nations. A person ascribes unlimited sovereignty and features to the de facto limited community. It is imagined as sovereign, because it was born in the age of Enlightenment and Revolution, when the legitimacy of the divinely ordained, hierarchical dynastic realm was rapidly waning: the nations were dreaming of becoming free, and this meant possessing a sovereign state. Finally, it is imagined as a community, because ‘regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship’.23 According to Anderson, it is ultimately this sense of fraternity that makes it possible for so many millions of people to willingly lay down their lives ‘for such limited imaginings’.24 He criticises Gellner for identifying ‘invention’ with ‘fabrication’ and ‘falsity’, rather than with ‘imagining’ and ‘creation’; with the intention of showing that nationalism masquerades under false pretences. Such a view implies that\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 7\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\n8\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nthere are ‘real’ communities, which can be compared advantageously to nations. However, all communities larger than small villages with ‘face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined’.25 Hence, Anderson concludes, communities should not be distinguished by their falsity or genuineness, ‘but by the style in which they are imagined’.26 Emphasising the political aspect of nationalism, Eric Hobsbawm has contended that nations are the products of nationalism, which is a political programme aiming to create a nation-state. According to Hobsbawm, the nature of nations can be understood by analysing national traditions, which are examples of ‘invented traditions’;27 i.e. ‘traditions actually invented, constructed and formally instituted’.28 These are quite recent inventions, often deliberately constructed to serve particular ideological ends. The very expression ‘invention of tradition’ is somewhat redundant, since all traditions, as products of human behaviour and human imagination rather than the result of natural forces, are invented in one way or another. Hobsbawm alleged that the period between 1870 and 1914 was the apogee of invented traditions. This period, for him, was also important for the incursion of the masses into politics, which created problems for rulers in retaining the obedience and loyalty of their subjects. At this point, ‘the invention of tradition’ was put on the agenda by the ruling elites to cope with these problems. The development of primary education, the invention of public ceremonies, and the mass production of public monuments were the three main innovations of the period.29 As a result of this, ‘nationalism became a substitute social cohesion through a national church, a royal family or other cohesive traditions, or collective group self-presentations, a new secular religion’.30 These theories emphasise ‘macro-historical forces’31 such as the connection between industrialisation and nationalism, the growth of the state, mass education, print capitalism, cultural factors, the role of politics, and power struggles.32 They argue that nationalism emerged under certain conditions as a result of ‘discrete historical forces’. To understand the emergence of feelings of nationalism in Ottoman Crete, one should examine the specific conditions which flourished on the island and try to answer the question of when and how the situation became fertile for the emergence of nationalism in an island where certain\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 8\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:37 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nfeatures and elements of nationalisation were not present. In this respect, the politicisation and nationalisation process of the Orthodox Christian community of the island is a very significant point to be examined. Moreover, one should also ask what made the Cretan Christians decide to sacrifice their lives or ‘willingly to die’33 in the so-called ‘nationalist liberation struggle’ for an abstract entity, or an ‘imagined community’. In this sense, it is fair to note that ‘nationalism is a discourse that constantly shapes our consciousness and the way we constituted the meaning of the world. It determines our collective identity by producing and reproducing us as “nationals”.’34 And thus, the nationalist discourse became a key element in uniting the Cretan Christians, who used this discourse to explain and legitimise their actions. I argue that the Greek War of Independence (1821–29) became a model and provided the impetus for developments on the island in terms of nationalist revolts of the Cretan Christians. In other words, the Greek War of Independence and the infiltration of modern Greek identity into the island manipulated the rebellious history of Crete and became a necessary precondition for the politicisation and nationalisation of the Orthodox Christian community of the island. Molly Greene’s words illustrate the importance of the creation of a Greek identity and the Greek War of Independence in terms of the change in the vision of the Cretan Christians:35 Daskolyiannēs’ uprising [1770] was part of that long-term process, although its vision was not a national one but rather one in which Christian Orthodox Russia would replace the Ottoman Turks in Constantinople and the East in general. ... Daskolyiannēs’ exclusivist vision, of course, was the one that finally triumphed in Crete and throughout the Greek world. It was in the rural areas that fight against the Ottomans was launched and finally won, and thus to the peasant’s traditional enmity toward urban life was added the powerful tonic of a national vision that exalted the authentic country-side over the corrupt Ottoman city. The available sources focused on the union of Crete with Greece and interpreted it as the absolute political and national aim of the Christian\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 9\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\n10\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\ninsurgents and the major reason for the Cretan revolts. Indeed, Christian insurgents aimed to change the political, economic and social structure of Cretan society and to seize power by overthrowing the Ottoman administration and forcing the evacuation of Ottoman troops from the island. In other words, Christian insurgents attempted to transform the existing Cretan society into a new one, in which Christians would be dominant. In this respect, for example, if we use Antonio Gramsci’s words, the Cretan Christians’ aim can be interpreted as a ‘hegemonic struggle’. Gramsci defined hegemony as ‘intellectual and moral leadership (direzione) whose principal constituting elements are consent and persuasion’.36 According to Gramsci, a social group or class assumes a hegemonic role in order to articulate the cultural and ideological belief systems of a society. In this approach, the revolutionary party attempts to transform society and ‘conducts a hegemonic struggle to undermine the legitimating institutions of bourgeois society’.37 This ‘hegemonic struggle’ is relevant to the Cretan case in that the subordinate group (Christian community) endeavoured to become the dominant one. There is no doubt that union with Greece (enosis/ένωσις) was very often put forward by the Christian insurgents of Crete, but it is important to remember that those insurgents sometimes turned their faces to Russia, their Orthodox co-religionists, to get support for their insurgent activities in order to overthrow the Ottoman administration. Moreover, the following chapters will explain that while certain Cretan Christian insurgents were in favour of the establishment of an autonomous government on the island, others promoted the unification with Greece. This book suggests that the Cretan revolts of 1896 and 1897 are to be examined not only within the context of separatist nationalist movements of the nineteenth century, but also that of the local structure of Ottoman Crete.38 According to Liah Greenfeld, ‘every nationalism was an indigenous development’, but at the same time ‘the development of national identities ... was essentially an international process, whose sources in every case but the first lay outside the evolving nation’.39 From this perspective, the specific nature of Cretan society and specific internal conditions, and at the same time ‘international process’, became essential in formulating the matrix of\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 10\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nthese revolts. It is important to remember that nationalism was the most powerful ideology in the nineteenth century and that it shaped the course of subsequent world history. The nationalist movements in the Ottoman Empire had their counterparts in other ancien régimes like the Habsburg and Russian Empires, and were able to radically alter the multi-ethnic structures of these empires, leading to the establishment of nation-states. In this period, the Christian subjects of the Ottoman Empire rebelled against the Ottoman administration and succeeded in establishing new independent ‘quasi-nation-states’ in the Balkans. The establishment of the Greek Kingdom became the crucial model for the other Balkan peoples. However, the establishment of the Greek Kingdom had particular importance for the course of Cretan history since it diverted the general course of the socio-cultural dynamics by politicising and nationalising the Orthodox Christian population of Ottoman Crete, which intensified the conflicts within the island. The indigenous developments also shaped the scope of the Cretan revolts. The local Cretan Christians were struggling to achieve their own demands and desires. In other words, these local Cretan Christians mobilised and voiced their own demands. For that reason, the involvement of the local Christian population in the national movements was the decisive element in the Cretan revolts. Miroslav Hroch examined and defined nationalism among the small states of Europe and divided the national movements into three fundamental phases: Phase A, the period of scholarly interest, Phase B, the period of patriotic agitation, and Phase C, the rise of a mass national movement.40 Phase A is essential in that it ‘is marked by a passionate concern on the part of a group of individuals, usually intellectuals, for the study of the language, the culture, the history of the oppressed nationality’.41 Phase B, according to Hroch, is the decisive phase for the small state and ‘the fermentation process of national consciousness’. In this stage, a group of patriots who were discontent with the existing conditions aim to raise the national consciousness among the people. In the last stage, Hroch considered that ‘national consciousness has become the concern of the broad masses’.42 Hobsbawm also divided the history of national movements into three phases: Phase A is ‘purely\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 11\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\n12\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\ncultural, literary and folkloric’. In Phase B, militants are active in promoting and campaigning ‘the national idea’. In Phase C, ‘nationalist programs acquire mass support, or at least some of the mass support that nationalists always claim they represent’.43 According to Hroch, these three processes are crucial in the transformation of intellectual activity into a movement: a social and/or political crisis of the old order accompanied by new tensions and horizons; the emergence of discontent among significant elements of the population; and a loss of faith in traditional moral systems, above all a decline in religious legitimacy, even if this only affects small numbers of intellectuals.44 For Hroch, a successful national movement includes four elements: first, a crisis of legitimacy, linked to social, moral and cultural strains; second, a certain amount of vertical social mobility (some educated people must come from the non-dominant ethnic group); third, a fairly high level of social communication, including literacy, schooling and market relations; fourth, nationally relevant conflicts of interest.45 In this framework, the patriotic agitation in Ottoman Crete started after the Greek War of Independence, which played a stimulating role for the Cretan Christians. This patriotic agitation gained momentum by the infiltration of Greek national ideology through various means such as education and communication and the discontent of the Cretan Christians with the existing system. In other words, the indoctrination of the Cretan Christians with Greek national ideology increased the pace of ethnic and national consciousness among the Cretan Christians as it politicised and nationalised the Orthodox Christian population of the island. In addition, discontent among the Cretan Christians with the existing system played a significant role in the emergence of a mass movement on the island. Put another way, when the infiltration of the Greek national ideology was fused with the local discontent, the Cretan Christians found themselves right in the midst of the wave of nationalism and became involved in the nationalist movements. The shift in the relationships between the Christian and Muslim communities of Ottoman Crete and the politicisation and nationalisation of the Christian demands are also examined within the theoretical framework of Charles Tilly. According to Tilly, at the beginning of\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 12\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nthe nineteenth century, conflicts between different social groups were defensive, local and backward. Tilly defines these types of conflicts as ‘reactive conflicts’, such as tax rebellion and food riots. For him, after the victories gained by the state, proactive forms of collective action became the standard settings for collective violence. They are ‘proactive’ rather than ‘reactive’ since ‘at least one group is making claims for rights, privileges, or resources not previously enjoyed’.46 In the case of Crete, the continuous attempts of the Cretan Christians to end Ottoman rule on the island and their fierce struggles to seize the institutions of the state and to gain social, economic and political privileges are ‘proactive’. In other words, they attempted to destroy existing social-structural arrangements and tried to disestablish the value system of the Ottoman administration. However, it is important to note that although I use certain points of the above-mentioned theories in conceptualising my framework, unlike certain contemporary studies, for example Ussama Makdisi’s work on Mount Lebanon,47 I have not relied strictly on any theoretical perspectives as a guideline of historical analysis. In his book, Makdisi examines the sectarian practices among Maronite Christians and Druze Christians in Mount Lebanon. Makdisi strictly adopted Edward Said’s critique of Orientalism as an explanatory framework in his textual analysis of sectarian practices. However, my aim is not to discredit these approaches. Instead, this book is concerned with explaining the Cretan case more widely than through one theoretical assumption.\n\nAvailable Literature on Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Crete In spite of its significance for the past and present, Ottoman Crete has not been studied in much depth and scholars have devoted very little attention to the island, partly because it requires a thorough knowledge in different fields and languages, and partly because many people have preconceived ideas about what happened in the past, influenced by the present. By interpreting the Cretan revolts simply as reflections of religious tensions, the available literature fails to understand the dynamics of Cretan society. Partly as a result of this,\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 13\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\n14\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nit has produced superficial explanations for the period under scrutiny and instituted certain projects that sought to address revolts along these terms. As one of the oldest and most well-structured ancient civilisations of the Eastern Mediterranean, the island of Crete has long attracted attention from Western European travellers. For that reason, travel accounts are a major source of detailed information on the history, customs, topography, geography and people of the island.48 William Miller, for instance, devoted part of his book to describing his findings and observations on the internal situation, particularly the European occupation of the major towns of the island in 1898, evaluating events from the British imperial perspective.49 He focused on the picturesque and ‘cosmopolitan character’ of Chania, stating that ‘all nationalities meet, all tongues are spoken, all currencies pass muster’.50 Miller interpreted events from the Orientalist point of view. While he was proud of Western civilisation, he considered Crete to be an underdeveloped island that lacked the elements of modernity. In addition to travel literature, eyewitness accounts by Western European and Ottoman journalists contributed to the literature.51 On the other hand, Devlet-i Âliyye-i Osmânî ve Yunan Muhârebesi 1314, written by Süleyman Tevfik and Abdullah Zühtü, both correspondents for the Ottoman daily Sabâh, provides details of the Ottoman–Greek War of 1897 and the Cretan issue, and is helpful in elucidating how Ottoman journalists transmitted the events.52 Western European academic literature has conceptualised the events in Ottoman Crete in terms of the ‘Cretan Question’. From the standpoint of the ‘Eastern Question’ paradigm, for instance, the Ottoman administration in Crete was considered a ‘corrupt and impecunious Oriental Government’,53 and the ‘Cretan Question’ was seen as an aspect of the ‘Eastern Question’.54 It is my contention that the term ‘Cretan Question’ is inappropriate in the case of nineteenth-century Ottoman Crete. The term ‘Cretan issue’ seems more appropriate to refer to the developments that took place on the island, because things were somewhat different from the way they were perceived by the European states. In this book, for that reason, I prefer to use the term ‘the Cretan issue’.\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 14\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\nThe ‘disintegration theory’ explains that active religious and ethnic groups became ‘aware of their national consciousness’ over time and began to rebel against their ‘theocratic oppressive ruler’. This theory claims that those groups were able to gain their independence through armed struggles. In this context, it was generally argued that the Ottoman Empire had a theocratic system which was not able to control ethnic and religious groups within the empire. Accordingly, these groups found a fertile ground for achieving their independence from the Ottoman Empire through armed struggle and rebellious activities. It was often claimed that Ottoman Crete was one of the worst-governed provinces in the Ottoman Empire during the nineteenth century: ‘Crete had for long been one of the most ungovernable parts of the Ottoman Empire’.55 This school of historiography has, explicitly and implicitly, considered the Ottoman administration as passive, static and incapable of establishing law and order on the island and meeting the demands of the Cretans: ‘the revolt which broke out there ... was more than a mere protest against misgovernment’.56 Available Greek nationalist literature in Western European languages viewed the events that occurred in Ottoman Crete in the nineteenth century from their own nationalist perspective. The Cretan revolts were portrayed as ‘a matter of religion. [They were] Christians against Turks.’57 A writer of this genre claimed that the Cretan revolts were reflections of ‘never-ending hostility between the Cretans and Turks’. It was also asserted that to the Cretan, the Turk was a cruel master; he might be checked, temporarily, but could not be associated, in any way, with the code of civilized societies. Between Turk and Greek, particularly the Cretan Greek, there was a deep hostility and enmity; between the despot and the dependent, between Christian and Infidel, between two races so opposite, that fusion was impossible.58 In the same vein as Theodore Tatsios, another Greek nationalist historian, Theocharis Detorakis, has treated the Cretan issue as the ‘Cretan Question’ which was seen as part of the ‘Eastern Question’. Within a similar framework as above-mentioned nationalist historians,\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 15\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:38 PM\n\n16\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nDetorakis wrote that ‘the clear nationalist character of the Cretan Question ... as events developed ... began to occupy European diplomacy as an important part of the Eastern Question’.59 He also claimed that Muslim inhabitants of Crete were not in favour of the reforms and that they ‘continuously sought [their] abolition’.60 He noted the drastic increase in the Christian population after 1821. He emphasised the demographic superiority of the Christians by giving details about the population trends of Crete throughout the nineteenth century, arguing that ‘the Christians were now able to influence decisively the course of historical events’.61 On the other hand, Ottoman and modern Turkish national historiography has devoted little attention to Ottoman Crete. While some scholars have paid special attention to Crete’s symbolic importance for the Ottoman state as the last conquered territory of the Ottoman Empire, others have portrayed it as a ‘burden’ for the Ottoman state.62 Moreover, Turkish historiography has understood the disturbances that took place on the island simply as the outcome of European states’ political intrigue.63 At this point it should be noted that, as Karakasidou eloquently remarked, ‘these are looking-glass histories. They search backwards over the hills and valleys of historical events to trace the inexorable route of a given (or “chosen”) population to the destiny of their national enlightenment and liberation. They transform history into national history.’ 64 Contrary to what the Greek and Ottoman nationalist historiographies have portrayed, throughout the nineteenth century the Ottoman Empire tried to strengthen its position by carrying out reforms to meet the current needs of the day. When analysed from a historical perspective, it can be seen that the Ottoman modernisation process began to cope with changes going on within the empire and the world. Hence, the reform process began way before the Tanzîmât reforms. During the reign of Sultan Mahmud II, fruitful attempts were made to transform the rigid structure of the Ottoman Empire into a better-functioning and modern state structure. Many reforms were made in the bureaucracy and military, including the formation of a modern Western-style army. This was a response to changes in technology and in modern warfare. Similarly, reforms were made to cope with radical external\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 16\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n17\n\nchanges.65 Although these reforms marked a break with the Ottoman tradition, ‘they did not envisage a fundamental transformation of Ottoman society, or even ... of state; rather, they sought to stabilise the existing state and to equip it for survival in a radical altered external environment’.66 This also became evident during the reign of Sultan Abdülhamid II, in which the ultimate aim of the reform process was saving the main pillars of the state. The existence and the maintenance of the central Ottoman bureaucratic system were supplemented with various ideological methods so as to facilitate the legitimacy of an empire facing cultural and diplomatic isolation. In its relations with the European states, the Ottoman Empire desperately tried to present itself as a Western state.67 But it is important to note that wherever the reforms did not suffice, various attempts were made at ‘fine-tuning’ policies.68 An important study on late nineteenth-century Ottoman Crete in the Turkish language is Ayşe Nükhet Adıyeke’s detailed book, which provides valuable insights regarding the history of Ottoman Crete between 1896 and 1908. Adıyeke is mainly concerned with the administrative structure of Ottoman and autonomous Crete, focuses on rules and regulations and describes the major events that occurred between 1896 and 1908. However, in her narrative, Adıyeke has pointed out that Ottoman Crete was somehow sui generis and had a very privileged status when compared to the other provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Throughout her book she places a special emphasis on the privileged status of the island.69 It seems evident that Ayşe Nükhet and Nuri Adıyeke depicted the Cretan society from the standpoint of tolerance and coexistence and considered the Muslim segment of the society, as well as the Christian one, as a homogenous community– disregarding the class differences, complex networks, and various webs of interaction which tied the Cretans together. In this sense, it is interesting to note that, as Çağlar Keyder has pointed out, before the nineteenth century, Muslims and non-Muslims lived in isolated villages or well-defined neighbourhoods in the cities, and their material and social differences were not problematic. Through the accelerated pace of economic alterations and urbanisation, ethnic groups came into contact with each other and the ‘social\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 17\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\n18\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nschismosis’ came onto the scene. Keyder further stated that ‘not only religious practice, but also schools and community organization, patterns of consumption and levels of Westernization, material culture and life-styles increasingly diverged’.70 At this point, Ussama Makdisi’s words regarding Mount Lebanon also deserve to be quoted at length here: as members of religious communities, Druzes and Maronites did not tolerate as much as fully accept each other with the understanding that neither side would encroach on the other’s sacred territory; they respected, acknowledged, and often participated in the various Christian and Muslim feasts, ceremonies, and customs that marked a living multicommunal society.71 Here, my aim is neither to deny tolerance and coexistence within Cretan society nor to draw a picture of violence and hatred. The typologies attributed to Crete as an island of coexistence or violence were not analytically relevant ones. This book suggests that tolerance, coexistence, violence and hatred are to be evaluated within the framework of the empire-wide dynamics in the nineteenth century. It is important to keep in mind that the fin-de siècle Eastern Mediterranean witnessed profound political and socio-economic transformations. Within this context, negotiations and conflicts in Ottoman Crete are well worth considering, not only for understanding the dynamic relations between Muslim and Christian communities of Crete but the larger themes of the Eastern Mediterranean region as a place where Christianity, Islam, ancién regimes and nation-states interacted and intersected throughout human history. To be more specific, I propose that the Cretan revolts of 1896 and 1897 should be examined within the context of the nineteenth century; a time when nationalism was the dominant ideology throughout the Balkans and Eastern Mediterranean. This book portrays social, political and ideological currents in Ottoman Crete within the context of local (Ottoman Crete), imperial (Ottoman Empire), nation-state (Greece) and colonial (European Powers) levels, all of which had crucial impacts on the events that took place in Crete at that time. In other words, this book\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 18\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n19\n\nattempts to explain the social, political and ideological transformation of Ottoman Crete and the genesis of these revolts within the nationalist context of the nineteenth century.\n\nA Note on the Primary Sources This book relies mainly on Ottoman, British and American archival sources, which are supplemented with the published British Parliamentary documents and various Ottoman, Greek and Western journals. The vast body of Ottoman archival documents related to my subject in the Prime Minister’s Archives in İstanbul were used, among which the Yıldız Palace Archive and the Girid İrâdeleri are the two vital categories in understanding late nineteenth-century Ottoman Crete and the way in which Ottoman statesmen perceived the Cretan revolts. The Yıldız Palace Archive contains a large volume of documents including imperial edicts, extensive reports of Ottoman administrators, correspondence of the governors with the centre, memoranda, petitions, complaint letters and grievances of the Cretans, and indicates how the Ottoman state understood the political, diplomatic, economic and social realities of Crete in the last phase of the nineteenth century. The Girid İrâdeleri is a very special collection within the Prime Minister’s Archives housing hundreds of documents regarding Ottoman Crete between the years 1839 and 1909. This collection also provided me with a plethora of information and insight on my subject, and its careful examination reveals much about the language of Ottoman governance, the perceptions of the Ottoman statesmen, the realities of Ottoman Crete including social, cultural and economic life, education, trade and immigration, and about the internal workings of the island in the nineteenth century. The other category of Ottoman archival documents consulted in this book is the holdings of the Ottoman Bank Archives and Research Centre, which includes quite rich records of the Muslim Council of Evkaf (pious foundations) and Orphans in Ottoman Crete. Those documents offer a different perspective from the Ottoman state documents and are very helpful in capturing the socio-economic life of\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 19\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\n20\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nthe Cretan Muslims, and the relationships and networks within the Muslim community. These records enable us to reconstruct the social history of the island during the late nineteenth century and at the turn of the twentieth century. Through these documents we can gain access not only to the local dynamics of the Cretan Muslims in Ottoman Crete but also to the shifts and changes in patterns of relations within Cretan society by the establishment of the autonomous regime and the unification of the island with Greece. In addition to the Ottoman archival materials, I have also made use of American and British consular reports. The British reports yielded detailed information on daily events in the turbulent periods. The official correspondence between the British consul in Chania and British Minister of Foreign Affairs is useful in understanding the socio-economic and political conditions prevailing on the island during the Cretan revolts and the British imperial perspective regarding the internal and external dynamics of Crete, and it reflects the multiple dimensions of British involvement in Cretan affairs. The use of British and American archival sources helped me to balance the Ottoman perspective on the Cretan issue and the hybridisation of all these archival sources provides a broader perspective in the reconstruction of Cretan history.\n\nOutline This book is divided into five chapters. Chapter 1 examines the establishment of modern Greek identity and the irredentist policies of the Greek Kingdom. Emphasis is placed on the main parameters of Greek nationalism with the aim of discussing the establishment of modern Greek identity. This chapter also deals with two dominant ideologies of the period, which were Ellinismos and Romiossini, and it attempts to question Greek national identity, its ‘continuity’ and different phases within the context of the nineteenth century. The supporters of the Hellenic model tried to shape the new Greek state by excluding the Byzantine and Ottoman past from Greek history, and looked to Western Europe to define ‘Greekness’. Greek nationalist scholars invested an enormous amount of energy into attempting to refute the assertion of\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 20\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n21\n\nJakob Philipp Fallmerayer that the modern Greeks were not descended from the Greeks of antiquity. Through their study of history, language and folklore they aimed to establish continuity between ancient and modern Greeks. After describing this debate, the chapter explores the relationship between Greek irredentism and the Megali Idea (Μεγάλη Ιδέα) with the aim of illustrating to what extent Ottoman Crete was incorporated into the fold of the Greek mainland. Chapter 2 provides a general overview of Cretan history and describes the physical, demographic and socio-political aspects of Crete so as to elucidate the roots of the developments and transformations that took place in Ottoman Crete in the late nineteenth century. We have seen that the events of the late nineteenth century were not entirely isolated from previous ones. In other words, there were no clear-cut distinctions and demarcation lines throughout Cretan history. Analysing the role played by the Council of Pious Foundation and Orphans in Cretan society, this chapter arrives at interesting insights in terms of innerand inter-communal relations. It seems clear that Ottoman Crete was not simply a province on the periphery full of revolts, conflicts and violence. Rather, the socio-economic relationship between the Cretan Muslims and Christians transcended the boundaries of the religious communities. Furthermore, in this chapter, accounts of Ottoman statesmen are closely examined in order to understand the viewpoint of the writers concerning the difficulties that occurred in Crete. Chapter 3 pays special attention to the Cretan revolt of 1896, which provided important insights into the consolidation of the Cretan Christians and the exclusion of the Cretan Muslims. In a way, it illustrates how exclusion and violence drew certain boundaries between the Orthodox Christian and Muslim communities of the island. Cretan Christians voiced their own demands, such as the nomination of a Christian governor, the restoration of the Halepa Pact, the convocation of the Cretan Assembly, the proclamation of the General Amnesty, and finally the withdrawal of Ottoman forces from the island. Furthermore, the Cretan revolt of 1896 acted as an important means to integrate most of the Christian inhabitants of Ottoman Crete and created the sense of ‘differences’ (dhiafores) between the Muslim and Christian communities. This chapter indicates that the European\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 21\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\n22\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nPowers understood the revolt as a reflection of ethnic and religious tensions and implemented reforms that sought to end the revolt in these terms. Chapter 4 narrates the ‘nationalist liberation struggle’ of the Cretan Christians in 1897. The main question the chapter addresses is how and why these people were politicised and nationalised. It argues that the nationalist ideology of the Cretan Christians played the major role in the Cretan revolt of 1897, which represented a fundamental crisis in local dynamics. The scope of this revolt was also different from those of the others. It was not confined only to certain districts but erupted almost simultaneously in the western and eastern extremities of the island. Moreover, the Greek and European occupations of the island added another dimension to this already turbulent period. This chapter also presents the stories of pillage, poverty and migration. What is clear is that, as my findings indicate, the population of Crete was almost reduced to poverty during the revolt, and in certain parts of the island most of the people were left homeless due to the devastating impact of the revolts. After discussing the impacts of the Cretan revolt of 1897 on the Cretan society, the chapter investigates the establishment of an autonomous government in Crete on the basis of the Cretan Christians’ projects in cooperation with the European Powers, arguing that the establishment of the autonomous regime did not simply mean a transition from the Ottoman regime to an autonomous one. This caused considerable annoyance among the Cretan Muslims and had a demoralising effect on the local Muslim community, who thought that they had lost their superiority over the Cretan Christians. The main objective of the final chapter is to elucidate how diplomatic politics challenged the internal dynamics of the island. While the European Powers, especially Britain, urged the nomination of a Greek subject to the post of Governor-General of Crete, the Ottoman government opposed it, and insisted on the appointment of an Ottoman subject to the post. Furthermore, this chapter demonstrates that the Cretan Christians saw the presence of the Ottoman forces on the island as the main barrier to deconstructing the existing administration and to reconstructing a new one and believed that without the evacuation of the Ottoman troops, no progress could be made in Crete.\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 22\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n23\n\nHowever, here it needs to be highlighted that the administrative power of the island could not be seized by the Cretan Christians, who had struggled to capture power through rebellious activities. Rather, the European Powers placed administrative power in the hands of High Commissioner Prince George, a Greek subject. By the establishment of the autonomous regime, the power and the initiative of the Ottoman state were marginalised, and as a result the Muslim community of Crete became subordinate to the Cretan Christians, and was gradually reduced in size.\n\nSenisik_Int.indd 23\n\n6/1/2011 12:05:39 PM\n\nCHAPTER 1 THE CR EATION OF MODER N GR EEK IDENTIT Y AND ITS IMPACT ON OTTOM AN CR ETE\n\nGreek nationalism stemmed from the interaction between internal and external factors in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Changes in the organisational structure of the Ottoman Empire, changing patterns of commerce, the activities of the diaspora intelligentsia and the revolutionary spirit of the Enlightenment contributed to the emergence of Greek nationalism and the construction of the modern Greek identity. In order to understand the very origin of Greek nationalism it is necessary to analyse the specific historical reality of Western Europe and the Ottoman Empire at the time when Greek nationalism emerged, and examine the role and position of the Greek Orthodox peoples within the Ottoman Empire. In this part of the book, I intend to give a very general background and discuss some of the main ideas and developments of the time in order to provide the ideological and historical background for the establishment of the Greek nation-state. The socio-ethnic structure of the Ottoman Empire and the religious identity determined by the so-called millet system had a tremendous impact on the development of Greek nationalism and the process of its nation formation. The millet system can be defined as a ‘socio-cultural and communal framework based firstly on religion and\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 24\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:18 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n25\n\nsecondly on ethnicity which in turn often reflected linguistic differences’.1 The ethnic groups were organised into ethno-religious communities such as the Orthodox, Armenian, Jewish and Muslim. All Orthodox Christians belonged to the Orthodox Rum milleti of which the Greeks were the dominant part. The social estates regrouped the subjects according to their occupation and function, and free vertical mobility was prohibited in order to maintain the survival of this organisation.2 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, profound changes took place in Ottoman society under the impact of various internal and external social, economic and political factors.3 The Ottoman social structure of the classical age disappeared and new class divisions came into existence that provided fertile ground for the emergence of the modern Greek identity.4 The change in commercial patterns between Europe and the Ottoman Empire, the European protection extended to non-Muslim subjects who conducted business with them, and the trade networks established in Europe by Greek merchants all played significant roles in the development of Greek nationalism. The European demand for access to the rich supplies of food and raw materials in the Balkans and the availability of cheap manufactured European goods altered commercial relations within and outside Europe, which in turn affected agricultural trade relations in the Ottoman Empire. From then on, the Ottoman state’s control over the production and exchange process started to decrease. As a result of this, the European states’ protection over non-Muslim subjects of the Empire became more visible.5 With the Treaty of Carlowitz, the Ottoman Greeks started to benefit from the trading rights of the Ottoman subjects in the Habsburg domains. After the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca, Greek ships were allowed to fly the Russian flag in the Black Sea, which led to a revival in economic conditions and had a significant impact on the emergence of a new middle class in the Greek lands. Greek merchants began to travel to Western Europe to sell their products, bringing the new ideas of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution back to the Greek mainland.6 The Greek merchant class facilitated the spread of Greek Enlightenment texts, which added a cosmopolitan character to the Greek cultural production that began to develop outside the\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 25\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:19 PM\n\n26\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nintellectual sphere of the Orthodox Christian hierarchy.7 The expansion of the Balkan trade brought these merchants to Central Europe and caused them to interact with the cultural environment of Europe.8 Moreover, the diaspora Greek bourgeoisie played an important role in trade between the Ottoman Empire and Western Europe. The ideas of the Enlightenment and French Revolution flourished in the Greek Orthodox diaspora, which became the main centre in the development of Greek nationalism.9 The diaspora intellectuals were admirers of liberal Europe and were influenced by the spirit and the beliefs of the Enlightenment and European concepts such as secular education, progress, popular sovereignty, and the nation-state. These Greek merchants and diaspora intelligentsia imported and transmitted the ideas and the values of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution that contributed to the ideological preparation for the Greek War of Independence.10 The transmission of these ideas and values into modern Greek thought contributed to the construction of the modern Greek identity. It can be argued that it was on the above-mentioned dynamics that the seeds of the Greek War of Independence were sown. The military contribution of the klephts, literally ‘thieves’, to the cause of Greek independence is also worthy of mention.11 The klephts were mountain dwellers, the majority of whom were pastoralists. They were mainly fugitives, outlaws, debtors, misfits and victims of oppression. The Ottomans entrusted the bands of Orthodox Christian irregulars, the armatoles (‘men at arms’) with the control of the mountainous regions, to provide security and keep the klephts away from the villages and mountain passes. According to some scholars, the origins of the armatoloi can be traced back to the Byzantine and Venetian times while others have rejected this view, arguing that the armatoloi were an Ottoman creation. The armatoles were former outlaws who were given amnesty by the Ottoman authorities. The ablest and most dangerous ones became captains who commanded the armatoles and were responsible for the maintenance of order in the districts of their jurisdiction, known as armatoliks. It is important to mention that the boundary between the klephts and armatoles was not clear, because of changing economic circumstances. Klepht could become armatoloi and vice-versa. The following verse from a ballad is a clear indication of this fluidity:\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 26\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:19 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n27\n\nFor twelve years long I lived a Cleft on Chasia and Olympos At Luros and Xeromeros I served as Armatolos.12 At the time, Western intellectuals admired the classical Greek heritage and conceived of ancient Greece as the birthplace of Western civilisation.13 In other words, Western intellectuals idealised ancient Greeks as their intellectual and spiritual ancestors.14 Western scholars made available the printed form of the Greek classics with philological and lexicographic adjuncts and dozens of books which recreated the ancient Hellenic civilisation. In the last quarter of the eighteenth century, this ‘past’ was accepted by a small number of Greek intellectuals who studied and travelled outside the Ottoman Empire.15 Infused with the ideas of the Enlightenment, these intellectuals transmitted the culture of the Enlightenment and tried to adopt the achievements of European civilisation to Greek culture and society.16 It should be taken into account that the Greek diaspora bourgeoisie and the Western-educated intelligentsia provided the leadership and financial resources for the Greek revolutionary movement.17 Moreover, the Philhellenes played a significant part in the construction of the Greek identity.18 With the impact of Philhellenism, the Greek intellectuals emphasised the ‘debarbarising’ of the modern Greeks.19 As a result of this interaction, Greeks began to conceptualise a Greek identity. It has been pointed out that ‘Greek [nationalism] may be considered the first to appear outside Western Christendom, among a community ruled by non-Christians and itself hitherto violently hostile to all Western nations’.20 At this point it is also important to stress that, as some scholars have argued, the Greek Enlightenment did not arise out of conscious and planned actions of political-economic or intellectual elites, but rather it ‘arose ... out of the magma of social and cultural practices in the Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean region of the Ottoman Empire ... and as an overall “project,” it operates at the level of social-imaginary signification’.21 Molly Greene attributed great significance to the demise of Venetian power in the Eastern Mediterranean in the 1720s. She remarked that after this demise, the Ottoman Empire no longer faced a threat from Venice and so new cultural choices flourished in the Ottoman\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 27\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:19 PM\n\n28\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nMediterranean. For their part, the Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire turned their faces to northern Europe. It is undoubtedly true that the creation of the Greek identity, as Greene put it, resulted from this contact with Western Europe. The place of Crete in this story is very important, for Crete’s fortunes began to depend closely on the developments of Greek nationalism.22 In view of this, in the context of examining Greek nationalism, we shall attempt to consider the subsequent effect of this upon the social and political conditions of Ottoman Crete as well as the gradual incorporation of the Cretan Christians into the Greek world. For that reason, in order to provide the ideological and historical background for the events that took place in Ottoman Crete in the nineteenth century, I intend to give a very general background and briefly discuss the evolution of modern Greek identity in this part of the chapter. In doing so, I wish to examine two different and contradictory forms of national identity: Ellinismos (Ελληνισμός-Hellenism) and ‘Romiossini’ (Ρωμιοσύνη). While the first ideology represents the classical Hellas, the second one idealises the Byzantine Empire. In order to shed light on how Greek historians and folklorists contributed to the construction of the Greek identity, this chapter also analyses the studies made in Greek nationalist historiography and folklore. The issue of identity inculcation and transformation in Ottoman Crete and the mechanisms that were used in the incorporation of the Cretan Christians into the modern Greek identity are also dealt with. The last part of this chapter examines Greek irredentist aspirations which articulated the ideology of the Megali Idea (the Great Idea). In the heyday of irredentist aspirations in the Balkans, the Greeks envisioned enlarging their state to include all the Greek Orthodox population living in the Ottoman lands. As the Megali Idea became the dominant ideology throughout the nineteenth century and Ottoman Crete was one of the main pillars of the ‘Greek irredenta’, special emphasis is given to this ideology.\n\nThe Pre-revolutionary Era: Korais and Rhigas In the pre-independence period, Rhigas and Korais were the two leading figures in the conceptualisation and formation of Greek nationalism.\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 28\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:19 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n29\n\nAdamantios Korais (1748–1833) was born in Smyrna and acquired an excellent knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin at an early age. Due to his family’s silk business, he was sent to Amsterdam where he continued his education and then returned to his native city in 1788. Four years later, he went to Montpellier to study medicine. After finishing his education, he went to Paris in 178823 and began to publish the Greek classics in a series called the Greek Library (Elliniki Vivliothiki). He prefaced them with lengthy introductions aiming to give his countrymen an understanding of the classical heritage.24 According to Korais, the Greeks had been suffering from cultural and political tyranny since the time of the Byzantine Empire. Sharing the same views as the other intellectuals of the Greek Enlightenment, Korais ‘transformed the Byzantine state into a medieval version of the Ottoman Empire’. In addition to the Byzantine state, he was contemptuous of the Ottoman Empire and the Phanariots.25 The Ottoman Empire, for him, was the most corrupt form of oriental tyranny and the successor of the Byzantine state. Moreover, he placed most of the blame for the exploitation of the Greek people on the Byzantine emperors, the Ottoman sultans and the Phanariots, seeing them as a ‘single corrupt organism’ which fed on the Greek people.26 He suggested a total break with Byzantium, including the monks and the Byzantine aristocracy of the Phanar, and the idealisation of the ancient ancestors who were the inventors of philosophy.27 Korais argued that there was a direct relationship between a nation’s language and its moral character. He admired classical Greek and considered it ‘the language of liberty’. He was, however, aware of the fact that the resurrection of classical Greek was impossible. Accordingly, he aimed to repair the damage that the Greek language had suffered during Greek people’s ‘enslavement’.28 It is important to remember that the written and spoken forms of the Greek language had altered drastically since 300 bc. Remaining very close to its ancient classical ancestor, the archaic written form had been used by the educated class. The demotic spoken form had developed in its own way with its easier grammar and syntax,29 in which Turkish, Slavic and Albanian words were incorporated throughout the centuries.30 Until the time of Korais, there were two opposed groups concerning the language: on\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 29\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:20 PM\n\n30\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nthe one hand, those who were in favour of the written language argued that only the archaic written form would reflect the nation’s heritage as it was very close to ancient Greek. On the other hand, the supporters of the spoken form argued that in order to spread the message, it was necessary to write in the language that people were already using. In addition to these opposing groups, there were advocates of the middle way, including Korais. They suggested that spoken language should be adopted, but it should be purified of foreign elements. For them, a language should be based on the structure of the spoken language which retained the features of the ancient Greek, but it should not include foreign elements. What is more striking about Korais’ contribution to the language question was the introduction of the pure form of the language, which was called katharevousa.31 In recognition of the fact that education had provided the basis of the French Revolution, Korais paid special attention to the increase and spread of education among the Greek people.32 He also claimed that the independence of the Greek people would be achieved through education, which would cultivate the republican ethic of spiritedness among the citizens of Greece. For that reason, Korais ‘urged the Greeks to become educated through Western “enlightened reason” in order to become worthy of bearing the glorious name of “Hellene” ’.33 In a way, the traditional society of Ottoman Greece would be transformed into a moral republic dedicated to the spirit of Greek classicism and the European Enlightenment.34 He encouraged the rich merchants to spend their money on the promotion of education by establishing schools and libraries throughout Greece and paying for young Greeks to study in Europe,35 and also emphasised the role of the printed media in the promotion of education. In other words, he believed that the national history was engraved in the minds of the people through the print media.36 Under the influence of the Western Hellenic ideal, Korais claimed that the ancestors of the modern Greeks were the ancient Greeks. The term Romioi, which the modern Greeks used to refer to themselves, represented the national shame, since it included the memory of the Greek’s subjection to the Romans. For that reason, he used the term ‘Hellenes’ for the ancient Greeks and ‘Graikoi’ for the modern Greeks.37\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 30\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:20 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n31\n\nAccording to Korais, modern Greeks should rediscover their historical origin, which ‘was a reflection of a broader program of political modernization’.38 If the modern Greeks adopted the knowledge of the ancients that was preserved in the West, they could rise and reconstitute themselves in the world. By this programme, the continuity between the ‘ancients’ and the ‘moderns’ could be established.39 Rhigas Velestinlis (1757–98) was born in the Thessalian village of Velestinon and educated locally. Between 1777 and 1780 he lived in İstanbul and engaged in trade, as well as working as the secretary of Alexander Hypsilanti. After that, he spent a long time in Wallachia working in the service of the hospodars. In 1796, he went to Vienna and, inspired by the French Revolution and the revolutionary atmosphere in France, he developed his revolutionary ideas about the emancipation of the Balkans from Ottoman rule. He demanded the liberation not only of the Greeks but of all Balkan peoples, including the Turks, believing that if all oppressed peoples united and fought against the Ottoman Empire, liberation would be inevitable.40 In his Grand Map of Greece of 1797, Rhigas envisioned the overthrow of the Sultan by the consolidated and coordinated action of all Balkan peoples, and moreover identified Hellas with the Ottoman Empire’s lands in the Balkans and Anatolia, emphasising the principles of the French Revolution. He favoured the French constitution of 1793 as his model. In his federalist model, he underlined the idea of citizenship and individual rights which would underpin the coexistence of all Balkan peoples.41 Rhigas’ famous poem ‘The March’ became the slogan of the revolutionaries after 1796. In this poem, he envisioned freedom for all the peoples of the Ottoman Empire who suffered from tyranny. According to him, tyranny should be destroyed through revolution. In other words, for Rhigas, all the peoples of the Ottoman Empire should come together and rebel against Ottoman tyranny.42\n\nEllinismos vs. Romiossini: Paradoxes in Greek Nationalism After the establishment of the Greek Kingdom in 1830, the Greeks looked to the past as a model for creating their self-image, like most peoples of southeastern Europe. However, the peculiarity of the Greeks\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 31\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:20 PM\n\n32\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nwas that they had two different ideal types to trace their origins back to. This point inevitably brings one to the question of ‘in what ways did the political elites conceptualise “one nation” out of “two histories”?’43 The supporters of the Hellenic ideology sought to shape the new Greek state in the Hellenic ideal by negating and excluding the Byzantine and Ottoman past from Greek history. Tourkokratia was seen as a cause of the backwardness of Greece and a period of slavery. Although it was an immediate past and alive in the everyday culture, Greek nationalist historiography negated the Tourkokratia.44 The supporters of the Romeic ideology looked rather to Byzantium and the revolutionary period.45 The Hellenic model was ‘the dominant official version of national identity’46 in the first century of statehood, as Herzfeld aptly put it, because ‘the Greeks were obliged to build their nation-state under the watchful eye of more powerful countries’.47 Herzfeld criticises this model for being an ‘outward directed model’ dictated by the Europeans. For him, the establishment of a monarchical system, the installation of King Otto, and the main political parties known as the ‘English’, ‘French’ and ‘Russian’ were all indicators of the European Powers’ domination over Greece.48 By the nineteenth century, Greek politicians and intellectuals looked to Western Europe to define Greekness. Accordingly, official nationalism gave priority to the European standard of cultural excellence. It became obvious that in addition to its dominant role in the political sphere of the Greek Kingdom, Europe also had hegemony over Greek culture. Herzfeld elucidated brilliantly the role of Europe as the key actor in the construction of the Greek identity, remarking that since Europe considered ancient Greece as its spiritual ancestor, it dominated Greek culture, deciding on the Greeks’ behalf what was acceptable or not. For the Europeans, Turks symbolised ‘a monolithic image of oriental barbarism’, because ‘Turks polluted the Hellenic perfection’ by bringing elements of shiftiness, double-dealing and illiteracy to Greek culture.49 For that reason, Greece was regarded as both holy and polluted in terms of Eurocentric ideology. As it was the mythic ancestor of all European culture, it was ‘holy’. On the other hand, as it had become polluted during Ottoman domination, it was ‘unclean’.50 The contrast between ‘holy’ and ‘unclean’ brought about\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 32\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:20 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n33\n\nmany further tensions which would pose a real threat to the construction of a stable national identity. Herzfeld underlined that the Europeans had succeeded in ‘persuading the Greeks to adopt the Turks as their natural enemies, and to treat Turkish elements in Greek culture as its worth failed as a source of cultural pollution’.51 In this context, the clear manifestation of the European point of view can be observed in the nationalist Greek folklore studies in which oriental elements were interpreted as ‘evidence of corruption’. It became evident that while Europe represented the image of high culture in Greek national historiography, Turks symbolised both illiteracy and fatalism as a consequence of European dictation.52 Herzfeld furthermore argued that the new Greek state reconstituted itself ‘out of an allegedly corrupt, barbaric, and profoundly Oriental morass in which the very rudiments of culture were lacking. The Greeks found themselves cast as citizens of a nation-state that was supposed to represent the “regeneration” of a Hellas’ created by the German classical philologists.’53 According to Herzfeld, the idea of returning to the classical past was also a product of European dictation. For the Greeks, the story was very different from that of the European view. As explained by Herzfeld: Unlike their European patrons, the Greeks were not seeking a return to the Classical past; they were instead seeking inclusion in the European present. The cultural policies of the Greek state appeared to outsiders to represent a sweeping concession to western European sensibilities: the Greeks had meekly submitted to the demand that they act out the role of living ancestors to the European cultural tradition.54 Herzfeld’s statements are based on certain peculiarities manifested by the Greek elites who might have adopted the neo-classical codes in the Greek cultural environment, but at the same time might have used these codes in their struggles to obtain the definition of Greek culture from the hands of Europeans,55 in order to control the construction of a national identity. In other words, the Greek elites made\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 33\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:20 PM\n\n34\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\na serious attempt to challenge the European hegemony over the Greek culture. This paradox, for Chatterjee, stemmed from the very nature of the ‘Eastern’ type of nationalism in which ‘peoples [are] drawn into a civilisation hitherto alien to them, and whose ancestral cultures are not adapted to success and excellence by these cosmopolitan and increasingly dominant standards’.56 In ‘Eastern’ nationalism, those peoples measured the backwardness of their nations according to certain global standards which were set by Western Europe. Yet, they were aware that these standards belonged to an alien culture and that the inherited culture of their own nation did not provide the necessary conditions for progress. For that reason, ‘Eastern’ nationalism made repeated attempts to ‘re-equip’ and transform the nation culturally.57 On the other hand, Liakos argued that it would be an ‘oversimplification to consider Greek identity as simply a product of postenlightenment colonialism’,58 and that the tradition of written texts in Greek, Latin and Hebrew played an outstanding role in the construction of pre-national history. Furthermore, myths of national origins were connected to this written tradition even before the emergence of nation-states. This tradition was appropriated by the Greeks and then transformed into a national tradition. For that reason, it can be argued that Hellenism was an intellectual product of the Renaissance.59 The tension between the Hellenic and Romeic models was reflected in the distinction between katharevousa (purist) and demotiki (vernacular) Greek. That is to say, while the linguistic realm of the Hellenic model was katharevousa, the linguistic realm of the Romeic model was demotiki.60 They have different vocabularies and grammatical rules. Katharevousa attempted to artificially recreate past linguistic forms, aiming to replace the ‘vulgar’ language with one which would be closer to that of the ‘glorious ancient ancestors’.61 In Greek historiography, katharevousa was also considered a means of entering into the international arena.62 Toynbee asserted that classical Greek can be considered a ‘medium for Modern Greek variety of Western culture’, since it would make a connection with the glorious past and impress the West.63 Herzfeld brilliantly expressed this relationship, noting that ‘the invention and cultivation of katharevousa were consistent both\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 34\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:21 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n35\n\nwith early philhellenic idealism and consequently with the “outer directedness” of Greek statecraft’.64 In the course of early statehood, the Eurocentric Greek intelligentsia considered demotiki as the representative of cultural incompleteness. It was thought that in the long run the success in the promotion of katharevousa would result in the liberation of Greeks both from the corruptions of the Tourkokratia and from their dependent status on the Great Powers of Europe.65 In other words, for the Greek scholars ‘katharevousa and the several other neo-Classical codes ... did not represent a passive acceptance of foreign neo-Classicism; on the contrary, it was an attempt to take internal and external control in a game where the definition of Greek culture was still largely in foreign hands’.66 It seems clear that the language question (to ghlossiko zitima) was also a core issue in the development of modern Greek identity.67 Given the endless discussions in the cultural and linguistic realms, it seems obvious that the tension between these two mutually opposed forces (Ellinismos vs. Romii, katharevousa vs. demotiki) was the essence of Greek identity. However, one has to be aware that these opposed forces existed in various domains of Greek society.68 Referring to this dualism, Kazantzakis asserted that ‘they [Greeks] are truly double-born souls’.69 It seems highly likely that this dualism shaped the whole of Greek life and it was the key to understanding the nature of the Greeks throughout the nineteenth century.70 Herzfeld overstressed this tension, saying ‘Greek identity is caught between two extreme poles, each derived from the image of a conquering other. At one end stand law-abiding Europeans ... On the other are the no less stereotypical orientals.’71 He noted, furthermore, that the tension between these opposing images was not only confined to the cultural and linguistic realms, but could also be observed in the architectural one. There was a tension between the neo-classical façade and simple, village style interiors in nineteenth-century urban houses.72 During the post-independence period, the Greek state had to formulate and develop a national identity for its nation. In this framework, religious differentiation of the Greeks from the Muslims could no longer cultivate the Greekness of the Greeks adequately.73 However, as Greek peasants designated themselves as Christians and speakers\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 35\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:21 PM\n\n36\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nof Greek, the new nation-state had to transform this religious identity into a secular national identity. This could be achieved by two means: first, the Greek nation-state should undermine the ecumenical aspect of Orthodoxy and diminish the influence of the Patriarch over the Greeks by the establishment of the national church. The creation of the Greek national church would also increase the influence of the Greek nation-state on the Greek Orthodox inhabitants of the Ottoman Empire. Second, an ‘emotional association’ could be established through various instruments including folklore, history and literature. In this way, the Greeks began to associate themselves with the new Hellenic national identity.74 The independence of the Church of Greece from the Patriarch of İstanbul was proclaimed in 1833, but not recognised by the Patriarchate until 1850.75 The Patriarchate did not recognise the Greek national church because it had not given its ideological consent to the nationalisation of churches.76 This led to confrontation between the Patriarchate and the Greek national church.77 The conflict arose from the fact that ‘Greece decided unilaterally to advocate the cause of Hellenism, not on the basis of religion as practiced in everyday life, but in the light of her own political-historical interpretation of what she considered to be Orthodox Christianity’.78 In other words, by establishing an independent Church, as Veremis remarked, the Greek state began to control and associate itself with the nation. Put another way, the state incorporated the Church and its martyrs into the pantheon of Greek heroes and made them integral parts of the national myth. Thus the Church became an accomplice of the state in its mission to spread the cohesive nationalist creed and in turn undermined the initial impetus of the enlightened statebuilders.79 In this regard, it is worth mentioning Carras’ assertion that the national church ‘was subordinated to state power and Antiquity provided the legitimation of the new state, but Orthodoxy became the established religion and a fundamental constituent of the new national identity’.80\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 36\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:21 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n37\n\nThe Greek state and the Patriarchate of İstanbul clashed over which of them would exercise power over the Rums of the Ottoman Empire, and they tried to legitimise themselves in the eyes of this population by various means. As Anagnostopulou remarked, whereas the Greek state tried to legitimise itself by a Greek national legitimacy, the Patriarchate used a Greek or Orthodox ecumenical one. She also pointed out that the Tanzîmât reforms, the gradual secularisation of the millet and certain alterations in the social, economic and political functions of the Orthodox population of the Ottoman Empire had a considerable effect on the Patriarchate. In this framework, these reforms and changes had redefined the power of the Patriarchate over the Orthodox community since the Ottoman Orthodox millet started to define itself in an ethno-religious framework and highlight its ethno-religious character. Thus, the Patriarchate as the head of the Orthodox millet had to redefine its position and add new functions to its power.81 In other words, the above-mentioned reforms, secularisation, and the emergence of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870 delegitimised the Patriarchate’s ecumenicity, and for that reason, it redefined and legitimised its power through national terms: the Greek nation.82 For instance, in Macedonia, together with Greek literary associations and other nationally oriented organisations, the Patriarchate built churches and schools to create the feeling of common membership in the nation of the Hellenes. This meant that the Church became one of the main actors, if not the main actor, in the preservation of the Greek national identity.83\n\nNational Historiography In 1830, Greeks were shocked by the theory of Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer. In this year his two-volume work Geschichte der Halbinsen Morea während des Mittelalters (‘The History of the Peloponnesus in the Middle Ages’) was published. In this book he formulated his theory that the present population of Greece was not descended from the ancient Hellenes. He tried to demonstrate his thesis by using a combination of original sources and linguistics, and providing evidence of Slavic toponyms in southern Greece.84 There was a break between ancient\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 37\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:21 PM\n\n38\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\nand modern Greeks, since the Greek people had disappeared during the Byzantine era due to Slav and Albanian invasions. Accordingly, Fallmerayer made the following assertions: not a drop of pure Hellenic blood flows in the veins of the Christian inhabitants of Modern Greece ... Scythian Slavs, Illyrian Arnaouts, children of northern lands, blood relations of Serbs and Bulgars, Dalmatians and Muscovites, are the people whom we call Greeks at present and whose genealogy, to their own surprise, we have traced back to Pericles and Philopoeman.85 Fallmerayer’s theory aroused outrage in Greece, and Greek scholars devoted themselves to refuting the theory and establishing a historical continuity throughout Greek history. Moreover, it was understood from his theory that there was an immense time gap between ancient and modern Greece. Henceforth, it was decided that this gap should be filled by incorporating pieces of Greek history into the puzzle in order to establish continuity.86 By the middle of the nineteenth century, German romantic ideas had spread throughout Europe.87 The gradual rise of romanticism had a significant impact on Greek scholarship and provided a new system of values. In the post-1850 period, Greek romantic historiography and folklore studies paid special attention to the continuity between ancient and modern Greeks and the historical territory of the Greek nation, which was identical with the space occupied by the Byzantine Empire.88 Spyridon Zambelios (1813?–81) was one of the most important Greek nationalist historians who studied the history of the Greek nation. In order to establish a historical continuity, he tried to insert the Byzantine phase into the narrative of modern Greek history. He considered the Byzantine phase as the connecting link between the classical and modern cultures. In other words, for him, if the Byzantine phase was disregarded, it would be impossible to establish the continuity between classical and modern times. For this purpose, Zambelios divided Greek history into three parts: the modern, the medieval and the ancient. Although the medieval phase was a time of ethnic regression, the ‘Hellenic consciousness’ was preserved. The tension between\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 38\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:21 PM\n\nMODERN GREEK IDENTITY\n\nAND\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\n39\n\nthe imperial throne of Byzantium and the Orthodox Patriarchate was a conflict between Roman authoritarianism and the democratic spirit of Classical Greece, which was perpetuated in the church.89 Byzantium was Hellenic in speech and learning, Christian in doctrine, and Roman in the imperial system of government.90 Zambelios also paid special attention to the linguistic continuity of the Greek language. According to him, folksongs provided important evidence of historical continuity. For that reason, one should study folksongs to discover the continuity in the national character.91 The folksongs of armatoloi and klephts provided evidence for historical continuity during Ottoman domination.92 Konstantinos Paparrigopoulos (1815–91) was regarded as the historian par excellence in Greek nationalist historiography for integrating Byzantium into Greek history and identity. He was born in İstanbul, where his father had been a banker and a representative of Morea. His father was killed during the Greek Revolution, so he went to Odessa with his mother where he attended the Richelieu Lyceum. He moved to Greece in 1830 and was educated at a school in Aegina. After studying at universities in Germany and France, he returned to Greece and worked at the Ministry of Justice until 1845. As an outsider Greek, he was dismissed from his post and he began to teach in a high school in Athens. In 1852, he was appointed professor of History at the University of Athens.93 In the early years of his career he devoted himself to responding to Fallmerayer’s assertions. Paparrigopoulos pointed out that ‘Hellenic continuity was linguistic and cultural, not racial’.94 Accordingly, in 1843, he wrote an essay On Slavic Settlements in the Peloponnese in which he acknowledged the influx of the Slavs into the Pelopponnesos in the early Middle Ages, but made it clear that the Slavs did not come as conquerors, and therefore they were assimilated by the native Greeks.95 His main contribution to Greek nationalist historiography was his splendid five-volume book History of the Greek Nation, which was published between 1860 and 1874.96 According to Kitromilides, this work can be regarded as ‘the most important intellectual achievement of nineteenth century Greece’. In it Paparrigopoulos ‘managed to bring Byzantium and Kolettis’ conception of the Megali Idea together as\n\nSenisik_ch01.indd 39\n\n6/1/2011 5:18:22 PM\n\n40\n\nTHE TR ANSFORMATION\n\nOF\n\nOTTOMAN CRETE\n\ncomponents of the political culture of Romantic Hellenism’.97 What is more striking about Paparrigopoulos’ work was the appreciation and integration of the Byzantine era into the continuum of Greek history,98 by putting special emphasis on the particular importance of Byzantine history for the Greek nation (to ellinikon ethnos).99 In this work Paparrigopoulos narrated the social, economic and cultural history of the Byzantine Empire, focusing on political and military events. For Kitromilides, these narratives provided an epic atmosphere which created a story of greatness, high drama and tragedy. In narrating the chronicle of the Byzantine Empire Paparrigopoulos devoted special attention to ethnological issues in order to ‘depict the survival and continuous existence of that historical actor, the Greek nation’.100 Interestingly, while Paparrigopoulos was describing the history of Byzantium he did not use the third person; rather he used ‘we’ and ‘us’ in describing the Greeks of the past.101 This means that he did not consider Byzantium as something ‘foreign’ or remote in terms of chronological and cultural time. Accordingly, he used terms such as ‘Medieval Hellenism’, ‘our Medieval empire’, ‘our Medieval forefathers’.102 By doing this, as Kitromilides noted, Paparrigopoulos induced the reader to incorporate ‘the Byzantine past into the frame of reference of his or her identity’.103 In a way, the gap between the ancient world and the modern era was filled by interpreting medieval Byzantium as a manifestation of Hellenism during the Middle Ages.104 It is important to note that Paparrigopoulos opposed the European tendency, which considered "
