Traditional costumes The costume of the Karagouni: The karagouna is found scattered throughout the Karagouni region, which is located in the plain of Thessaly in the regions of Karditsa, Kalambaka and Tyrnavos, as well as Domokos and Farsala. The karagouna is also the name of the traditional folk dance known all over Greece, though there are several versions of it existing even outside the Karagouni region. As for the costume, it is said that there are three or four variants depending on the region. In older days, women wore the costume as wedding attire. The intricate, multi-layer outfits with bright colors were meant to represent the wealth of the region. Today, the costume has been simplified and is popular among traditional Greek dance groups.\n\n7. Women's clothing The costume involves several layers of clothing; it includes a white underdress, an outer garment made of wool and a long sleeveless coat, as well as an embroidered waistcoat or vest, each of which look according to the area. The whole outfit is then topped with a red felt apron, adorned with a velveteen band. Women also wore a headpiece made of an embroidered scarf wrapped and twisted around the head and decorated with coins on the forehead. Men's clothing The men wear the costume with foustanella or vraki, pants, with no distinctive attributes, such as may be found over a large area of Greece and Albania.\n\n8. The music of the geographic and historical region of Thessaly in Greece : Dionysiakos  Dionysiakos is a form of Greek dance and customs from ancient Greece. Dionysiakos and its forms revived today in many areas of Greece like Peloponnese, central Greece and Crete with the best-known the Phallus festival in the area of Tyrnavos, Larissa. Koftos  Koftos is a lively Greek dance typical of the areas of Thessaly, Epirus and central Greece. When the music stops, the dancers yell \"Hey\", and you can also put your arms up, down, or clap. Gaitanaki  Gaitanaki is a form of a Greek folk dance from Thessaly, Greece. It is a circle dance. It is also very widespread in Epirus. Kleistos  Kleistos horos is a circle dance from Thessaly. The dance is performed in a circle with the men leading and the women following in the circle. It is usually exhibited to songs like \"San allo de me marane!\" The dance has two parts to it, slow and fast, with the handholds being different for each part.\n\n9. THRACE\n\n10. Traditional costumes The field of costume design in the region of Thrace presents an impressive diversity. The costume peculiarities of each costume, differentiate and emphasize the character of the social group from which it comes. The clothing as a clothing set, depending on the decorative perception of its individual components, which is expressed through different materials, shapes and colors, give the special aesthetics of each group.\n\n11. Men's clothing  Men's clothing presents unity in its form throughout almost the entire Thracian area. This costume of the region of Thrace was a common costume, as were the conditions and occupations of the people of the place. The Thracians all wear glasses. The poturi is a kind of open wide pants that was worn only in Thrace and that nominally characterized all the Thracian men's clothing. It was made of sagiaki, a woolen woolen cloth (a kind of felt), usually brown, for everyday wear, black for formal wear and sewn by terzides (tailors), who tied it with a black carousel at the edges. The guts of the glasses were proportional to the circumstance and the financial situation of each one. The summer cups were made of cotton blue fabric and were called \"vrakia\". The men's clothing of Thrace also consisted of the shirt which was either white cotton embroidered on the neck, neck and sleeves or dark blue or brown with white stripes or squares for work and usually had an upright collar and wide sleeves. Above the shirt they wore sleeveless vests that were made of flip flops and some were open and some closed depending on the area. There were also coats with short sleeved vests which were also made of black or dark blue or brown and was called jamantani. Only the groom's jam in the area of Makra Gefyra (Zaloufi) was red. On cold days of winter, however, they wore fur, a kind of shayacon coat, with a fur lining inside (sheepskin). This accessory characterized the financial situation of the wearer. The poorest wore the \"yamourlouki\" (a kind of long coat) made of gray hooded shawl. They wore knitted socks on their feet. For each day they had white pieces of flip flops, with which they wrapped the shins, the so-called blialia or podopania and the gourounotsaroucha or voidotsaroucha that they made themselves and tied with the tsarouchos ropes crosswise. On holidays they wore the koundouria or gemeni shoes they bought. The purchased shoes were mainly given as wedding gifts and were worn with Thracian costumes from the end of the 19th century mainly. The men's clothing was complemented by the long woolen double- breasted belt, fringed on both narrow sides, in black with white stripes on the weft or red with white stripes for the young and crimson for the older or as in M. Zaloufi red for the young, crimson for the middle-aged and black for the elderly and the feature of Thracian menswear was the head covering. It is a black or dark blue belt, about 2 meters long, woolen or cotton, which was wrapped around the head, leaving one fringed edge hanging on the back. This cover was called shawl or sanitary napkin and was replaced by the cap, black velvet or astrakhan hat with two buttons. On the cup they used to climb a diamond-shaped or round bead.\n\n12. Women's clothing  In very closed agricultural groups where the social organization strictly delimits the roles of the two sexes, the women's clothing that is formed is strict in terms of its line and rough in terms of the materials of its construction. The clothing of Zaloufi (Long Bridge) is a representative type. Zaloufi (Kefalochori) was located northeast of the Long Bridge (Ozun Kiouprou) and belonged to the Diocese of Didymoteicho. Its inhabitants were mainly engaged in viticulture (Zaloufi wine was famous), agriculture and animal husbandry. After the uprooting, the refugees from this area settled in villages along the West Bank of Evros (Dikaia, Sakkos, Heimonio, Thourio, Pythio, etc.), in villages of the Prefecture of Serres (Koimisi, Paralimnio, Tholos, Neochori, Nea Petra) and in Kalochori, Thessaloniki. The Women's costume of Zaloufi was worn in a large number of villages in the area with small variations such as in Thyrea, Pythio, Praggi, Petrades and in the villages of Mikro Zaloufi, Psathades, Tsali Kurt etc. The wide spread of the costume in villages of the wide area that had as administrative center of the Long Bridge, justifies its name as a costume of the Great Bridge, although it was not worn in this city. The materials for the manufacture of this clothing are all their own production. The women themselves wove, made the shawl and dyed it in black, dark brown (lizard) or red.\n\n13. PELOPONNESE\n\n14. Traditional costumes women This ladies’ costume consists of a gossamer silk shirt with fine gold embroidery, a precious pleated silk dress with wide sleeves in a variety of colors, and a velvet short jacket, all trimmed with gold braid and embroidery. The costume is completed with a red fez, and silk tassel. The neck and chest are decorated with rows of pearls and a precious women’s costume is worn on the east coast of Arcadia, Tsakonia, one of the most historic places in the Peloponnese. The place has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The Tsakonian dialect (still alive) is the closest language to the ancient Greek one. The dance of this region, the Tsakonikos Dance, is one of the oldest and similar to the ancient Greek dances.\n\n15. Men’s costume This men’s costume consists of a white shirt with very broad sleeves, white elastic trousers, knee bands and a kind of a very flared skirt (fοustanella) with 400 pleats. The length of the skirt is 50 cm.\n\n16. Traditional dances  In spite of all its historical and archaeological variety the Pelopónnesos is singularly lacking in that same kind of variety dance-wise.Sta Tria, Tsámikos, Syrtós/Kalamatianós.Another well-known dance of the Pelepónnesos is the Tsakónikos.There are other dances associated with only one or two villages in the Pelepónnesos, such as the Diplós Horós danced in some villages of Arkadia and possibly others performed on specific occasions but which are not mentioned here.\n\n17. Kalamatianos The Kalamatiano is one of the best known dances of Peloponnese. It is often performed at many social gatherings worldwide. As is the case with most Greek folk dances, it is danced in chain with a counterclockwise rotation, the dancers holding hands.\n\n18. Monodiplos Monodiplos is a traditional dance from the area of Messenia The dance is typically a Kalamatiano dance with two variations. There is a single step and a double step back variation that occurs in the dance. The song typically used in this dance is \"Stin Apano Geitonia\".\n\n19. Tsamikos The dance follows a strict and slow tempo not emphasising on the steps, but more on the \"attitude, style and grace\" of the dancer. The dancers hold each other from each other's hands, bent 90 degrees upwards at the elbows. It takes a sturdy hand, especially if you are supporting the first or last person of the line (or circle) who will lean on you to perform high acrobatic leaps (usually kicking his right leg up as he takes off followed by the left (in a scissor-like motion), hitting the latter with the back of his hand before landing). The steps are relatively easy but have to be precise and strictly on beat. The dancer might even stomp his foot in response to a strong beat. There is some improvisation involved and many variations of the steps, depending on which area the dancers come from. Over time the dance has taken on many variations. In the past, it was danced exclusively by men, but in modern times both men and women take part.\n\n20. CRETE Της Κρήτης την παράδοση με ευλάβεια στηρίζω, και όπου σταθώ και όπου διαβώ μια Κρήτη ζωγραφίζω. (Cretan mantinada)\n\n21.  Crete is the largest island of Greece and the fifth largest island in the Mediterranean sea. Crete located on the southern side of the Aegean Sea.
