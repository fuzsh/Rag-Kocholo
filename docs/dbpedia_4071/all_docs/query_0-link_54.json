(This is for all Albanians not kosovars only) This is a Correlation function not the sum of the Haplogroupe. And by this function that we conclude that Albanians & Kosovars have one of the strongest Dna identity in Balkans. By a correlation of 14 values. It is not the some for greeks (Greeks have a SE identity but not a greek one)\n\nwww.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v8/n7/abs/5200443a.html\n\n“Survey of anthropological features of the Illyrians\"\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to bring to evidence the physical traits of the ancient inhabitants of Albania, the Illyrians, through an anthropological study of 93 human skeletons of different periods. Based on the available typological data the author comes to the conclusion that the Illyrians of the Albanian territory constituted an Adriatic-Mediterranean population with Nordic and Alpine minorities. The results of this study throw light on certain historical phenomena, which are linked with the origin and formation of the Illyrians\"\n\nThis survey have shown that Albanians of today are the direct descendents of Illirian-Thraco race!\n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3304152?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\n\nCruciani Cavalli Sforza\n\nCruciani concluded that the distribution of the E3b1-alpha cluster in Europe indicates a Neolithic or post-Neolithic expansion out of the Balkans into Europe that spread as far west as the Iberian peninsula, and southeast to Turkey. STR diversity analysis gives an estimate of about 8 thousand years ago for that expansion\n\nNje studim tjeter: Semino: It's interesting to note that another recent study concluded that a J sub-group, J2e1 (J-M102), also expanded into Europe from the Balkans during the Neolithic period. Most likely due to genetic drift, Kosovar Albanians harbor a J2e frequency peak whereas variance maximum declines from the southeastern edge of the studied region\n\nAccording to Semino: The footprint of J2e1 (M102) on the European map indicates some sort of connection between the southern Balkans and north-central Italy. One possible explanation is that J2e1 may have dispersed into Europe from the Balkans.Some of the highest frequencies that Semino et al saw for J2e1 were Albania (14.3% of total population), north-central Italy (9.6%), Greece (6.5%) Croatia etc Semino et al estimated the date of the M102 mutation at about 8000 years ago.\"\n\nFirst of all Albanian and kosovars are the same peoples. The max frequencies of J2e are among Albanians, the some for E3b1. This 2 Haplogroupe are belived to exist there before the Roman arivals.(J2e% + E3b1a% = 16 + 45 = 61%) All this 2 haplogroup have max freq in albanians and this is a sign of distinction from slavs. In 2000 BC there have been different migration in to balkan no one can say there have ben only one haplogroup.\n\n209.85.129.104/search?q=cache:Kqj5uZRfjIUJ:hrcak.srce.hr/file/15462+%22HLA+Class+I+Polymorphism+in+the+Albanian+Population%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1\n\nhrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=15462"
