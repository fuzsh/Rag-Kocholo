This document is an introduction to the book \"Camera Graeca: Photographs, Narratives, Materialities\" which is a collection of essays about the history of photography in Greece. The introduction discusses how photography both captured and constructed Greece and its history and identity. It explores how photographs were used to represent Greece for domestic and foreign audiences in ways that reflected and shaped national and cultural narratives. The book contains essays that examine specific photographers and photographic projects from the 19th century and how they portrayed Greece and Greek antiquity and helped form concepts of Greek history and nationhood. It also looks at how photographs can provide alternative historical perspectives and narratives.",
