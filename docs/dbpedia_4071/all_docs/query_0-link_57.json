The birthplace of Zeus evokes a wealth of myths, legends and history. Its sun-blessed and dramatic landscape is dominated by soaring mountains and stunning beaches. Its proud and hospitable people uphold their unique culture and traditions and, despite the onslaught of mass tourism, rural life remains a dynamic and enduring part of the island’s soul. Crete’s rich mosaic presents visitors with an abundance of choices and experiences. The island’s rugged interior is sliced by dramatic gorges and interspersed with fertile plains and hillsides blanketed in olive groves, vineyards, wildflowers and aromatic herbs. In the west thousands of people trek through the Samaria Gorge, reputedly Europe’s longest, while the far east has Europe’s only palm-tree-lined forest beach. Crete’s natural beauty is equalled only by the richness of a history that spans millennia. The palace of Knossos is the most famous vestige of the glorious Minoan civilisation that once ruled the Aegean, and Minoan palaces and treasures can be found across the island. At the crossroads of three continents, Crete has been coveted and occupied by consecutive invaders. A profusion of evocative ruins reveals its turbulent past, from Roman settlements, Venetian fortresses, Ottoman mosques and Byzantine monasteries, while history comes alive in the charming old towns of Hania and Rethymno. Crete has the dubious honour of hosting nearly a quarter of Greece’s tourists but it’s big enough for independent travellers to venture off and find their own style of travel, from world-class luxury resorts and spas and historic boutique hotels to restored stone cottages in mountain villages. Free spirits and naturists gravitate to the remote southern beaches and island of Gavdos; intrepid hikers explore the final leg of the E4 European walking trail; cyclists whizz around the Lasithi Plateau; while nature-lovers arrive en masse in spring to walk among the stunning wildflowers. Crete’s terrain provides an exciting challenge for climbing, canyoning and all manner of extreme sports. This is an ideal road-trip destination, with picturesque (and often harrowing) drives through the spectacular mountains leading to remote beaches, traditional mountain villages and isolated agricultural settlements. While the renowned Cretan hospitality has been somewhat lost in the tourist-ridden resort towns, you can still find glimpses of the old Crete if you head off the beaten track. The 4WDs might outnumber the mules, but you’ll inevitably stop to let a flock of goats cross the road and occasionally come across men in traditional dress at the village kafeneio (coffee house). Cretans fiercely protect their culture and maintain a profound attachment to the traditions, music and dances that have forged their identity. Crete’s distinctive cuisine and its abundance of fresh produce provide the elements for a developing gourmet trail. A lively destination year-round, Greece’s largest and wealthiest island may feel more like a small country, with its sprawling cosmopolitan capital, big cities and towns filled with sophisticated cafés, bars, restaurants, universities and commercial activity. Above all, Crete maintains its distinctive island identity and enduring allure.\n\n17\n\nGetting Started Crete is an exciting destination but, unlike other Greek islands, it’s not just a matter of hopping off the boat and taking it from there. Crete is a massive and extraordinarily diverse island open to endless exploration and experiences. Most people only ever scratch the surface of what it has to offer. You can pack a lot in with careful planning, especially if you base yourself in central Crete. You will probably need to choose between the east and west, even between north and south, and take the time to explore one region thoroughly – it’s a good excuse to come back and see the rest. In peak season, it is best to have booked accommodation, but most of the time you can find somewhere to stay. Bear in mind that navigating the mountainous interior means zigzagging across the island, though the upside is that you see some spectacular territory and pass traditional villages on your way to that remote southern beach you’re after. The distances aren’t always huge, but winding through mountains can be hard going, so be realistic about how far you can drive in one day. The best way to see Crete is by car or motorbike, but an extensive part of the island is accessible by bus.\n\nWHEN TO GO Crete’s sunny disposition and long summers mean you can swim from midApril to November, particularly off the southern coast. The best times to visit are in late spring/early summer and in autumn when the weather is not too hot for hiking and other outdoor activities. Conditions are perfect between Easter and late June, when the weather is pleasantly warm in most places, the sea warm enough for a swim, the wildflowers are in bloom, beaches and ancient sites are relatively uncrowded, public transport operates on close to full schedules, and accommodation is cheaper and easy to find. The high season kicks in around late June and lasts until the end of August. Accommodation can be booked solid in August and is significantly more expensive. July and August are the hottest months and the most crowded, and while this is a great time for hanging out at the beach and enjoying balmy nights, it’s tough-going traipsing around archaeological sites or walking in the heat. In July and August, the meltemi (strong northeasterly winds) can play havoc with ferry schedules and make sandy beaches unpleasant. There’s usually no rain at all during summer. In winter, most beach resorts close down and tourist services and attractions are scaled right back, especially outside major cities.\n\nCOSTS & MONEY Crete is cheap by northern European standards, but not as cheap as it used to be, especially in the high season (July and August) when prices rise dramatically. The following budgets are for individuals; couples sharing a room and meals can get by on less. Add €25 to €30 per day for car hire. A rock-bottom daily budget would require €30 to €40. This would mean taking buses, staying in hostels or camping, and only occasionally eating in tavernas and visiting sites and museums. Allow at least €60 per day in the summertime for a simple room, meals in local tavernas, drinks at night and some sightseeing. If you want more-comfortable hotels, good wine, and visits to restaurants, bars, museums and sites, you will need more than €100 per day. An average taverna meal works out to about €10 to €15 per person including house wine; you can virtually double that for a fancier restaurant.\n\nSee Climate Chart (p211) for more information on rainfall and temperature ranges throughout the year.\n\n18\n\nG E T T I N G S TA R T E D • • B o o k s a b o u t C re t e\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nDON’T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT...

Packet of 20 cigarettes €2.80 An iced cappuccino €3.50 A Greek salad €3.50 Double room at a 3-star hotel €70 Mixed drink at a bar €6\n\nCrete is the subject of numerous travelogues and novels. Essential reading includes Nikos Kazantzakis’ classic Zorba the Greek (1946) and Freedom and Death (1950), both of which give a thoroughly engaging account of Cretan life, struggles and characters. Falling for Icarus is a humorous and well-written memoir of English writer Rory MacLean’s bizarre attempt to build a plane in Crete, helped by a colourful cast of Cretans. The Island, by Victoria Hislop, is a compelling novel uncovering dark family secrets and delving into life on the Spinalonga leper colony. Christopher Somerville writes a delightful and witty account of his midlife crisis walk across Crete’s E4 trail in The Golden Step: A Walk Through the Heart of Crete, weaving in history and characters. George Psychoundakis’ The Cretan Runner is an exciting and personal account of the Cretan resistance. The author was a runner delivering messages to the Allies. It was translated into English by author and fellow Resistance fighter Patrick Leigh Fermor, who also wrote the introduction. Across Crete, edited by Johan de Bakker, is the first of a three-part series that takes the reader from Hania to Iraklio as seen through the eyes of 18th- and 19th-century British travellers such as Richard Pokocke, Robert Pashley, Captain Spratt and Edward Lear. Memory of Tides, by Angelo Loukakis is a moving novel about the parallel lives of a Greek-Australian soldier and a Cretan woman who meet during WWII, set in both Crete and Australia. Winds of Crete, by David MacNeill Doren, is an amusing account of island life as experienced by an American and his Swedish wife.\n\nINTERNET RESOURCES\n\nExplore Crete (www.explorecrete.com) Good general travel site for Crete.

It’s a jam-packed schedule covering about 320km.\n\nCRETE HIGHLIGHTS\n\nSeven days / 320km Starting in Iraklio (p146), check out the superb archaeological museum and make the obligatory pilgrimage to the palace of Knossos (p158). On day two head south to explore the Roman Gortyna (p168) and the Minoan Palace of Phaestos (p169), stopping for a swim by the hippie caves at Matala (p172) or at nearby Kommos (p174). A visit to the excellent folk museum at Vori (p172) is a worthwhile detour. Spend the night by the beach or head inland to the village of Zaros (p166). Travelling west, stop in the village of Spili (p133) on the way to Moni Preveli (p140) and Preveli Beach (p141) and spend the night in Plakias (p138). Go north to Rethymno (p122) and spend a day exploring the old town. Heading west, stop at Vryses (p120) for lunch before driving to Hania (p78) for the evening. Take the early bus to the start of the Samaria Gorge (p93) and trek to Agia Roumeli, where you can take the boat west to Loutro (p98). The next morning take the boat to Hora Sfakion (p96) and bus it back to Hania.\n\nSEA OF CRETE\n\nHania\n\nVryses\n\nRethymno\n\nIraklio\n\nKnossos\n\nSamaria Gorge Spili Plakias\n\nLoutro Hora Sfakion\n\nMoni Preveli\n\nZaros\n\nPreveli Beach\n\nVori Kommos Matala\n\nLIBYAN SEA\n\nPhaestos\n\nGortyna\n\nITINERARIES •• Classic Routes\n\nCENTRAL-WEST CRETE 12 to 14 Days / 500km This itinerary covers some of Crete’s most stunning natural attractions, the unspoilt southern coast, unique villages and its two most attractive towns. Starting in Iraklio (p146), head inland to Anogia (p136) and the villages and caves at the foothills of Mt Psiloritis (p137). Stop by the pottery village of Margarites (p134) and the historic Moni Arkadiou (p134) before spending some time in the Venetian port of Rethymno (p122) with its 16th-century fortress. Heading south, the fountains at Spili (p133) make a good coffee stop before a visit to Moni Preveli (p140) and Preveli Beach (p141). From here you could continue east to the stunning southern beaches of Agios Pavlos & Triopetra (p141) or head west to the traveller hang-out of Plakias (p138) and the beachfront fortress of Frangokastello (p98). Heading west through the Kourtoulioti Gorge you come to the coastal port of Hora Sfakion (p96). You can either take a boat trip along the southern coast to Loutro (p98) or Sougia (p100) and double back, or take the steep road north to the Lefka Ori along the Imbros Gorge (p95) to the mountain village of Askyfou (p94). Spend at least a day in alluring Hania (p78). To the north, the Akrotiri Peninsula (p89) has some lovely monasteries and the famous beach at Stavros (p89) where Zorba the Greek was filmed. Take the circular route southwest via Kolymbari (p108) and the villages of Innahorion (p113), to the westernmost tip of the island at Elafonisi (p115). Return to Hania via the coastal road, detouring to Falasarna (p112) and north to the Gramvousa Peninsula (p111) to the spectacular beach at Balos (p111). Returning east it’s worth stopping at the springs of Argyroupolis (p130), southwest of Rethymno, and the lovely resort town of Panormo (p143), on the eastern coast heading to Iraklio.\n\nThis covers a pretty thorough wish list of Crete’s highlights and involves lots of winding mountain drives. You should allow for plenty of stops and distractions. Total distance covered would be more than 500km.\n\nSEA OF CRETE\n\nGramvousa Peninsula Balos\n\nStavros Kolymbari\n\nFalasarna\n\nHania\n\nAkrotiri Peninsula\n\nPanormo Rethymno\n\nIraklio Margarites\n\nInnahorion Villages Elafonisi\n\nAskyfou Sougia\n\nImbros Gorge\n\nLoutro Hora Sfakion\n\nMoni Arkadiou Argyroupolis Spili Plakias\n\nFrangokastello Moni Preveli\n\nPreveli Beach Triopetra Agios Pavlos\n\nLIBYAN SEA\n\n21\n\nAnogia\n\nMt Psiloritis\n\n22\n\nI T I N E R A R I E S • • Ta i l o re d T r i p s\n\nTAILORED TRIPS IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE MINOANS\n\nIraklio Knossos Anemospilia Vathypetro Villa Phaestos; Agia Triada Kamilari; Kommos\n\nArhanes\n\nSix to Seven Days / 400km The Minoans knew how to choose their real estate so this is not a bad way to see some of the best spots on the island. Allow at least half a day at the museum in Iraklio (p146) to appreciate the richness of Minoan civilisation through the treasures found at the major sites. After exploring the palace at Knossos (p158), take a short detour to the sanctuary of Anemospilia (p164). At Arhanes (p163), you can stop at the excellent small museum and the Vathypetro Villa (p164) nearby, which was probably the house of a Minoan noble. Head east inland or along the coast to the palace of Malia (p178), and then to the important site of Gournia (p192), about 19km southeast of Agios Nikolaos. Continuing east veer off the highway to the seaside village of Mohlos (p193), where there are tombs near the cliffs and an islet opposite with the ruins of Minoan houses. Continue east past Malia Sitia to Palekastro (p197), where ongoing excavaPalekastro tions are expected to uncover a major palace. The Mohlos Zakros Gournia palace of Zakros (p199) is ideally located next to the lovely beach of Kato Zakros (see p200) and the Zakros Gorge. It is a long drive west cutting inland to the major palace at Phaestos (p169) and the summer villa at Agia Triada (p171). The minor sites at Kamilari (p174) and Kommos (p103) are next to good beaches.\n\nGORGES & SOUTH COAST TOWNS\n\nThree to Five Days / 120km This itinerary combines a trek through two stunning gorges, including the famous Samaria Gorge, and a boat trip to a couple of great beaches. It is best done by bus and you need to be travelling very light or organise to have your luggage delivered ahead in a few places. From Hania (p78) take the early bus to Omalos (p92) and walk through the Samaria Gorge (p93), leaving early to ensure you get to Agia Roumeli (p95) in time to cool off with a swim and catch the afternoon boat to Sougia (p100). Rest your weary body at this laid-back beach community in preparation for a 7km walk down the smaller Agia Irini Gorge (p101) the next day. A bus Hania or taxi from Sougia takes you to the start of the gorge and it is a reasonable walk back. The next Omalos day you can take the boat to Paleohora (p102). You can also take the stunning coastal walk (p106) Agia Irini Gorge Samaria from Sougia to Paleohora, which is one of the E4 Gorge Sougia Paleohora Trail most popular parts of the E4 trail, stopping at the Lissos Agia ruins of ancient Lissos (p102). Relax in Paleohora Roumeli before taking the bus back to Hania.\n\n© Lonely Planet Publications 23\n\nHistory Crete’s colourful history goes back 5000 years and is evident across the island, from ancient palaces and Roman cities to spectacular Byzantine churches, Venetian fortresses and Ottoman buildings. Crete’s prominent place in world history is a legacy of the illustrious Minoan civilisation that was living in grand palaces when the rest of Europe was still in primitive huts. Crete has also left an indelible mark in the popular imagination because of its prominent place in ancient Greek mythology. It was where Rhea gave birth to Zeus and hid him from his child-gobbling father, and it was Zeus’ son Minos who became the legendary King of Minoan Crete. Icarus and Daedalus launched their ill-fated flight in Crete, while Theseus made the voyage from Athens to Crete to slay the Minotaur in the famous labyrinth. Crete’s more recent history has been characterised by war and struggle, as the island was a strategic pawn in the battles for control of the Mediterranean. Crete has been invaded numerous times and ruled by eight different foreign powers since Minoan times – by the Mycenaeans, Dorians, Romans, Venetians, Byzantines, Arabs, Ottomans and Germans. That Crete only united with Greece in 1913 explains its enduring independent spirit.\n\nTHE MINOANS The Minoans were the first advanced civilisation to emerge in Europe in the Bronze Age, predating the great Mycenaean civilisation on the Greek mainland. Minoan civilisation drew its inspiration from two great Middle Eastern civilisations: the Mesopotamian and Egyptian. Immigrants arriving from Anatolia around 3000 BC brought with them the skills necessary for making bronze, a technological quantum leap that enabled the emerging Minoans to flourish almost uninterrupted for over one-and-a-half millennia. While many aspects of Neolithic life endured during the Early Minoan period, the advent of bronze allowed the Minoans to build better boats and thus expand their trade opportunities. Pottery and goldsmithing became more sophisticated, foreshadowing the subsequent great achievements of Minoan art, and the island prospered from trade. Controversy still shrouds the mysterious Minoans. Evidence uncovered in the grand palaces on Crete indicates they were a peaceful, sophisticated, wellorganised and prosperous civilisation with robust international trade, splendid architecture and art and seemingly equal status for women. They had highly developed agriculture, an extensive irrigation system as well as advanced hydraulic sewerage systems. They may have spoken an early Indo-Iranian\n\n6500 BC Crete’s early inhabitants hunt and fish and engage in ancestor worship. Neolithic people live in caves or wooden houses, worship female fertility goddesses, farm, raise livestock and make primitive pottery.\n\n3000 BC Immigrants from the North African or Levantine mainland arrive with the skills for making bronze, heralding the Bronze Age in Crete. In this Pre-Palatial period, society changes; the inhabitants begin to trade; pottery and jewellery making develops.\n\nThe mythical Talos, a bronze giant, is believed to be the first robot invented. Hephaestus offered him as a servant to King Minos.

Architectural advances are accompanied by great strides in pottery production techniques.

The legend of King Minos has captured the imagination of generations of scholars intent on finding evidence of the events described by Homer in The Odyssey: ‘Out on the dark blue sea there lies a rich and lovely land called Crete that is densely populated and boasts 90 cities… One of the 90 cities is called Knossos and there for nine years, King Minos ruled and enjoyed the friendship of the mighty.’ The legendary ruler of Crete was the son of Zeus and Europa and attained the Cretan throne with the help of Poseidon. With Knossos as his base, Minos gained control over the whole Aegean basin, colonising many of the islands and ridding the seas of pirates. He married Pasiphae, the daughter of Helios, who bore him a number of children, including the infamous half-bull, halfhuman Minotaur. How long King Minos actually reigned, however, is open to debate. The Homeric reference enneaoros used to describe Minos could mean ‘for nine years’ or ‘from the age of nine years’. Was Minos able to create an empire in nine short years, or was he a long-reigning monarch who started his kingly career as a boy? He eventually came to a nasty end in Sicily when the daughters of King Kokalios poured boiling water over him as he was taking a bath.\n\nFor photos and descriptions of more than 50 Minoan sites around Crete, see archaeology buff Ian Swindle’s comprehensive website at www.uk.digiserve .com/mentor/minoan /index.htm.\n\nlanguage, and the accounts and records left behind suggest their society was organised as an efficient and bureaucratic commercial enterprise. Although the evidence for a matriarchal society is scant, women apparently enjoyed a great degree of freedom and autonomy. Minoan art shows women participating in games, hunting and all public and religious festivals. They also served as priestesses, administrators and participated in the trades. Not everyone buys into this rosy account of life in Minoan times; one radical archaeologist claims it was more likely a sinister society based on a death cult, with sacrificial orgies, and even argues that the distinctive giant pithoi were used as burial urns, not storage. Even the chronology on the Minoan age is still debated. But most archaeologists generally split the Minoan period into three phases: Protopalatial (3400–2100 BC), Neopalatial (2100–1450 BC) and Postpalatial (1450–1200 BC). These periods roughly correspond, with some overlap, to the older divisions of Early Minoan (some parts also called Pre-Palatial), Middle Minoan and Late Minoan (the terms are used interchangeably throughout this book). The Minoan civilisation reached its peak during the Protopalatial period, also called the Old Palace or Middle Minoan period. Around 2000 BC, the large palace complexes of Knossos, Phaestos, Malia and Zakros were built, marking a sharp break with Neolithic village life. During this period, Crete is believed to have been governed by local rulers, with the island’s power and wealth concentrated at Knossos. Society was organised on hierarchical lines, with a large population of slaves, and there were great architectural advances.\n\n1700 BC Minoan palaces are destroyed, most likely by an earthquake. The Minoans rebuild the palaces to a more complex and lavish design with multiple storeys, storerooms, workshops, living quarters for staff and an advanced drainage system.\n\n1450 BC Minoan culture comes to an abrupt and unexplained halt. The palaces (except Knossos) are destroyed in what archaeologists now believe was a massive tsunami following the earthquake in Thira (Santorini).\n\n1400 BC The Mycenaeans colonise Crete, building new cities such as Lappa (Argyroupolis), Kydonia (Hania) and Polyrrinia. The manufacture of weapons flourishes, the fine arts fall into decline. Greek gods replace worship of the Mother Goddess.\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nH I S T O R Y • • M y c e n a e a n C re t e\n\nThe first Cretan script also emerged during this period. At first highly pictorial, the writing gradually changed from the representations of natural objects to more abstract figures that resembled Egyptian hieroglyphics. In 1700 BC the palaces were suddenly destroyed by what most archaeologists believe was an earthquake. In what is considered the Minoan golden age, the Minoans then rebuilt the palaces at Knossos, Phaestos, Malia and Zakros to a more complex design centuries ahead of its time. There were multiple storeys, sumptuous royal apartments, grand reception halls, storerooms, workshops, living quarters for staff and an advanced drainage system. The design later gave rise to the myth of the Cretan labyrinth (see the boxed text, p160). During the Neopalatial period, the Minoan state developed into a powerful thalassocracy, purportedly ruled by King Minos with the capital based at Knossos. Trade with the eastern Mediterranean, Asia Minor and Egypt continued to boom and was helped by Minoan colonies in the Aegean. Minoan pottery, textiles and agricultural produce such as olive oil and livestock subsequently found ready markets throughout the Aegean, Egypt, Syria and possibly Sicily. Minoan civilisation came to an abrupt and mysterious halt beginning around 1450 BC after the palaces (except for Knossos) and numerous smaller settlements were smashed to bits. New scientific evidence suggests the Minoans were weakened by a massive tsunami and ash fallout from a cataclysmic volcano that erupted on nearby Santorini (see boxed text, p26). But there is much debate about both the timing and explanation for the ultimate demise of the Minoans. Some argue it was caused by a second, powerful earthquake a century later. Other archaeologists blame the invading Mycenaeans. Whether the Mycenaeans caused the catastrophe or merely profited from it, it is clear that their presence on the island closely coincided with the destruction of the palaces and Minoan civilisation.\n\nMYCENAEAN CRETE The Mycenaean civilisation, which reached its peak between 1500 and 1200 BC, was the first great civilisation on the Greek mainland. Named after the ancient city of Mycenae, it is also known as the Achaean civilisation after the Indo-European branch of migrants who had settled on mainland Greece. Unlike Minoan society, where the lack of city walls seems to indicate relative peace under some form of central authority, Mycenaean civilisation was characterised by independent city-states, the most powerful of them all being Mycenae, ruled by kings who inhabited palaces enclosed within massive walls on easily defensible hilltops. The Mycenaeans wrote in Linear B script (see the boxed text, p27). Clay tablets inscribed with the script found at the palace of Knossos is evidence of Mycenaean occupation of the island. Their colonisation of Crete lasted\n\n1100 BC The Dorians overrun the Mycenaean cities and become Crete’s new masters. They reorganise the political system, divide society into classes. A rudimentary democracy replaces monarchical government.\n\n431–386 BC While Greece is embroiled in the Peloponnesian War, Crete is busy with its own internal battles, Knossos against Lyttos, Phaestos against Gortyna, Kydonia against Apollonia, Itanos against Ierapitna. An earthquake wreaks havoc in 386.\n\n25\n\nBeyond the rich artistic and cultural legacy, the Minoans also invented the earliest ‘flushing’ toilet and advanced sewerage systems, described in detail on www .theplumber.com.\n\nThe Minoans knew how to enjoy themselves – playing board games, boxing, wrestling and performing bold acrobatic feats including the sport of bull-leaping, while Minoan dancing was famous throughout ancient Greece.\n\n67 BC The Romans finally conquer Crete after starting their invasion two years earlier in Kydonia. Gortyna becomes the new capital and the island’s most powerful city. A new era of peace follows as internal wars end.\n\n26\n\nH I S T O R Y • • M y c e n a e a n C re t e\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nfrom 1400 to 1100 BC. Knossos probably retained its position as capital of the island, but its rulers were subject to the mainland Mycenaeans. The Minoan Cretans either left the island or hid in its interior while the Mycenaeans founded new cities such as Lappa (Argyroupolis), Kydonia (Hania) and Polyrrinia. The economy of the island stayed more or less the same, still based upon the export of local products, but the fine arts fell into decline. Only the manuCRETAN TSUNAMI The sudden demise of the Minoans has been one of archaeology’s biggest mysteries, but new scientific evidence confirms that they were wiped out by a cataclysmic tsunami more powerful than the 2004 Asian Tsunami. In deposits found at key sites up to 7m above sea level, scientists discovered Minoan pottery, cups and building materials mixed up with pebbles, sea shells and tiny marine life that experts say could only have been scooped up from the seabed by something as strong as a tsunami. Archaeologist Joseph Alexander MacGillivray, who has spent more than 25 years in Crete studying the Minoans, says tsunami science has been able to explain the scale of the disaster and answer many questions baffling archaeologists. ‘When that wave hit the north coast, it was 23m high and 15km long. Three waves came ashore and the Minoan cities on the coast were wiped out,’ says MacGillivray, who is in charge of the British School of Archaeology’s excavations at Palekastro (see the boxed text, p198). Radiocarbon dates for the deposits on Crete coincide with the massive volcanic eruption 70km north on Santorini around 1500 BC. MacGillivray says 7cm of undisturbed Thira ash was found as far as Zakros, on the eastern coast. While the waves would not have reached Knossos, the damage to crops, their ports and fleets would have decimated the society. The timing also explains what the Minoans were doing in Egypt soon after 1500 BC, requesting the breath of life from Pharaoh Hatshepsut. ‘We’ve known for a century that the Minoans only went for that one period and now we think they went specifically to ask for help from the Pharaoh, who was the most powerful person on earth at that time.’ DNA science and the human genome have also provided some clues to the origins of the Minoans, including a new theory that the Bronze Age migration may have come from Troy, in northwest Anatolia. French accountant Hubert la Marle’s decipherment of Linear A script showed the Minoans spoke a language that came from Persia (Iran), but MacGillivray says it may not necessarily have travelled with the major population. ‘There is an Iranian DNA in Crete but it does not seem as strong as the Trojan one. But this is just the beginning of the study,’ he says. As for the controversial theory that it could be Plato’s lost continent of Atlantis, MacGillivray says Plato was ‘no idiot…The classical Greeks had a very good idea of Minoan history because it was part of Greek history…they knew where Crete was.’\n\n27 BC Crete united with Libya to form the Roman province of Cyrene.\n\nAD 63 Christianity emerges after St Paul visits Crete and leaves his disciple, Titus, to convert the island.\n\n250 The first Christian martyrs, the so-called Agii Deka (Ten Saints) are killed in the village of the same name, as Christian persecutions begin in earnest.\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nH I S T O R Y • • D o r i a n C re t e & t h e C l a s s i c a l Ag e\n\nfacture of weapons flourished, reflecting the new militaristic spirit that the Mycenaeans brought to Crete. The Mycenaeans also replaced worship of the Mother Goddess with new Greek gods such as Zeus, Hera and Athena. Mycenaean influence stretched far and wide, but eventually weakened by internal strife; they were no match for the warlike Dorians.\n\nDORIAN CRETE & THE CLASSICAL AGE Despite fierce resistance, the Dorians conquered Crete around 1100 BC, causing many of the inhabitants to flee to Asia Minor. Those who remained, known as Eteo-Cretans or true Cretans, retreated to the hills and thus preserved their culture. The Dorians heralded a traumatic break with the past. The next 400 years are often referred to as Greece’s ‘dark age’, although it would be unfair to dismiss the Dorians completely: they brought iron with them and developed a new style of pottery, decorated with striking geometrical designs. They also worshipped male gods instead of fertility goddesses and adopted the Mycenaean gods of Poseidon, Zeus and Apollo, paving the way for the later Greek religious pantheon. The Dorians reorganised the political system of Crete and divided the society into three classes: free citizens who owned property and enjoyed political liberty (which included land-holding peasants); merchants and seamen; and slaves. The monarchical system of government was replaced by a rudimentary democracy. Ruling committees were elected by free citizens and set policy. They were guided by a council of elders and answered to an assembly of free citizens. Unlike Minoan times, women were condemned to a subordinate role.\n\n27\n\nThe Man Who Deciphered Linear B, by Andrew Robinson, tells the fascinating story of Michael Ventris, the young genius who cracked the code in 1952, solving one of archaeology’s greatest linguistic mysteries and establishing Linear B as the oldest European writing system.\n\nDECIPHERING THE MYSTERIES OF LINEAR B The methodical decipherment of the Linear B script by English architect and part-time linguist Michael Ventris in 1952 gave the first tangible evidence that the Greek language had a recorded history longer than any scholar had previously believed. The language was an archaic form of Greek 500 years older than the Ionic Greek used by Homer. Linear B was written on clay tablets that lay undisturbed for centuries until they were unearthed at Knossos in Crete. Further tablets were unearthed later on the mainland at Mycenae, Tiryns and Pylos in the Peloponnese and at Thebes in Boeotia in Central Greece. The clay tablets, found to be mainly inventories and records of commercial transactions, consist of about 90 different signs, and date from the 14th to the 13th centuries BC. Little of the social and political life of these times can be deduced from the tablets, although there is enough to give a glimpse of a fairly complex and well-organised commercial structure. Importantly, what is clear is that the language is undeniably Greek, thus giving the modern-day Greek language the second-longest recorded written history, after Chinese.\n\n395 The Roman Empire splits and Crete is ruled by Byzantium.

As new Greek colonies were established throughout the Mediterranean basin, Crete took on a prominent trade role. The people of the various city-states were unified by the development of a Greek alphabet, the verses of Homer and the founding of the Olympic Games. The establishment of central sanctuaries, such as Delphi, for the first time gave Cretans a sense of national identity as Greeks. Rethymno, Polyrrinia, Falasarna, Gortyna, Phaestos and Lato were built according to the new defensive style of Dorian city-states, with a fortified acropolis at the highest point, above an agora (marketplace), a bustling commercial quarter, and beyond it residential areas. The 6th-century-BC Laws of Gortyna, discovered at the end of the 19th century AD at Gortyna, open a window onto the societal structure of Dorian Crete. Inscribed on 12 large stone tablets, the laws covered civil and criminal matters, with clear distinctions drawn among the classes of free citizens and between citizens and slaves. They are still in situ at the site. As the rest of Greece entered its golden age from the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete remained a backwater. Constant warfare between large commercial centres and smaller traditional communities left the island increasingly impoverished. Although Crete did not participate in the Persian wars or the Peloponnesian War, economic circumstances forced many Cretans to sign up as mercenaries in foreign armies or turn to piracy. During this time, Crete’s role as the birthplace of Greek culture drew the attention of philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle, who wrote extensively about Crete’s political institutions. Knossos, Gortyna, Lyttos and Kydonia (Hania) continued to vie for supremacy, causing ongoing turmoil. Egypt, Rhodes and Sparta got involved in the Cretan squabbles and piracy flourished.\n\nROMAN RULE While Alexander the Great was forging his vast empire in the East, the Romans expanded theirs to the west and began making inroads into Greece. Their various interests in Crete included reducing piracy and exerting control over important sea routes. The Roman presence in Crete dates back to the 3rd century BC, but it wasn’t until the second Mithridatic War (74–64 BC) that they used piracy as an excuse for intervention. Marcus Antonius, father of Mark Antony, undertook an unsuccessful naval campaign against Crete. The Cretans tried to negotiate and send envoys to Rome, but they were rebuffed. Expecting a Roman invasion, the island united and assembled an army of 26,000 men. The Roman campaign began in 69 BC under the Roman consul Metellus near Kydonia, and spread throughout the island. Although the Cretans fought valiantly, the Romans succeeded in subjugating the island two years later.\n\n960 Byzantine general Nikiforos Fokas attacks Chandax in a bitter siege, retaking Crete.

Crete did not mount a major challenge to Roman rule, although it became embroiled in the later rivalry between Antony and Octavian, both of whom punished the cities that supported their rival. In the early years of Roman rule, parts of Crete were given as favours to various Roman allies. In 27 BC Crete was united with Libya to form the Roman province of Cyrene. The Romans built the first new cities since Minoan times, with Gortyna becoming the capital and most powerful city in Crete. The Romans built an amphitheatre, temples and public baths, and the population increased. Knossos appeared to fall into disuse, but Kydonia (Hania) in the west became an important centre. Roman towns were linked by a network of roads, bridges and aqueducts, parts of which can still be seen today. Under the Romans, the Cretans continued to worship Zeus in the Dikteon and Ideon Caves, and also incorporated Roman and Egyptian deities into their religious rituals.\n\nCHRISTIANITY & BYZANTINE CRETE Christianity arrived early in Crete with St Paul’s visit in AD 63. He left it to his disciple, Titus, to convert the island. Titus became the first bishop of Crete. Little is known about the early years of Christianity in Crete, but by the 3rd century persecution of Christians began in earnest. The first Christian martyrs were the so-called Agii Deka (Ten Saints) killed in the village of the same name in AD 250. In 324 Emperor Constantine I (also known as Constantine the Great), a Christian convert, transferred the capital of the empire from Rome to Byzantium, which was renamed Constantinople (now Ïstanbul). By the end of the 4th century, the Roman Empire was formally divided into western and eastern sections; Crete, along with the rest of Greece, found itself in the eastern half. While Rome went into terminal decline, the eastern capital grew, long outliving its western counterpart (the Byzantine Empire lasted until the capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453). Crete was a self-governing province in the Byzantine Empire with Gortyna as its administrative and religious centre. Piracy decreased and trade flourished, leaving the island wealthy enough to build many churches. Crete’s attachment to the worship of icons provoked a revolt in 727 when Emperor Leo III banned their worship as part of the iconoclastic movement. The uprising was smashed and the Byzantine emperors unleashed a fierce wave of retribution. Byzantine rule was interrupted around 824 when the Arabs conquered Crete. The Arabs established a fortress called Chandax in what is now Iraklio, essentially to store their pirated treasure. As the island’s criminal reputation grew its economy dwindled and its cultural life ground to a halt. The Byzantines were in no position to help Crete despite its strategic importance.

The Byzantines then lost no time in fortifying the Cretan coast and consolidating their power. Chandax emerged as the island’s new capital and the seat of the Cretan archdiocese. The Orthodox Church has played a pivotal role in Crete’s history and preserving the culture and religion under successive invaders. Under Venetian rule, the Orthodox Church was dismantled and replaced with the Catholic Church and, ironically, it was the Ottomans who allowed the Cretans to resurrect the Orthodox religion. Attempts to convert the local population to Catholicism or Islam proved largely futile. Despite relentless persecution, Orthodox monasteries remained hotbeds of resistance and kept the spirit of national unity alive.\n\nVENETIAN CRETE The Genoese first moved in on Crete, but it was the Venetians who prevailed in 1217. Crete was pivotal to Venetian control of the Mediterranean and remained under Venetian rule until 1669, long after most of Greece had become part of the Ottoman empire. The Venetian influence is evident throughout the island, most notably in Hania, Iraklio, Rethymno, Sitia and Ierapetra, where they built mansions and massive fortresses to guard the developing port towns and harbours. Venice colonised Crete with noble and military families, many of which settled in Iraklio (Candia). During the first century of Venetian rule about 10,000 settlers came to Crete, induced by the seizure of the island’s best and most fertile land. The Cretan owners now worked as serfs for their new Venetian masters, who were not only the major land-holders but also held political control. Cretan peasants were ruthlessly exploited under Venetian rule, and oppressive taxation added to their woes. Religious life also suffered, as the Venetians viewed the church as a symbol of national identity and supplanted the Orthodox Church with the Catholic Church. Cretans rebelled regularly against Venetian rule and met with brutal Venetian reprisals. Eventually the rebellions forced concessions from Venice. By the 15th century the Cretan and Venetian communities reached an uneasy compromise that allowed Cretan cultural and economic life to flourish. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Crete became the last remaining bastion of Hellenism. Byzantine scholars and intellectuals fled the dying empire and settled in Crete, establishing schools, libraries and printing presses. The cross-pollination between Byzantine traditions and the flourishing Italian Renaissance sparked a major cultural revival, often called the Cretan Renaissance. Poetry and drama flourished and a Cretan School of icon painting (see p48) developed in the 16th and 17th centuries,\n\n1770 Under their leader Daskalogiannis, 2000 Sfakians mount an assault on the Turks in western Crete but the rebellion is viciously suppressed.

In the midst of this artistic ferment, the painter Dominikos Theotokopoulos emerged, studying in Italy before moving to Spain where he became known as El Greco (see the boxed text, p49).\n\nTURKISH CRETE By the middle of the 17th century, resource-rich and strategically located Crete became attractive to the expanding Ottoman empire and Venice was too slow in rearranging their defences in the face of the looming threat. Turkish forces landed in Hania in 1645, and although the fortress was bravely defended it fell within two months. Rethymno was next, giving control of the west to the Turks. Candia’s massive walls kept the enemy at bay for 21 years, but the city finally fell in 1669, leaving the entire island in Turkish hands (except for Spinalonga and Souda, which did not fall until 1715). Life was not easy under the Ottomans, although they did allow the Orthodox Church to reestablish itself and survive essentially intact during more than 200 years of occupation. Nevertheless, there were tremendous political and economic advantages to embracing Islam. Mass conversions were common; sometimes entire villages changed their faith. Economically, the Cretans were initially no better off under the Ottomans than they were under the Venetians. The Ottomans devised ingenious taxes to wring every drop of wealth out of the island, and the economy degenerated to a subsistence level. Trade picked up, however, around the start of the 18th century, and living standards improved. Crete exported grain, and its abundance of olive oil launched a soap industry. Rebellion was brewing, though, as many Cretans fled to the mountains, harassing the Turks with sporadic attacks, particularly in the Sfakia region. In 1770 under their leader Daskalogiannis, 2000 Sfakians mounted an assault upon the Turks in western Crete. Promised Russian aid never materialised and the rebellion was viciously suppressed. Daskalogiannis was skinned alive in the central square of Iraklio. When the Greek War of Independence spread to Crete in 1821, Sfakia was once again the nucleus of rebellion, but the revolutionaries were hampered by poor organisation and constant infighting. The Turks swiftly retaliated with a wave of massacres primarily directed at the clergy. Bogged down with fighting rebels in the Peloponnese and mainland Greece, the Turks were forced to turn to Egypt for help in dealing with the Cretans. Chronically short of arms and undisciplined, the Cretans fought furiously but were outnumbered by the Turkish-Egyptian forces.

An amnesty asked Cretans to lay down their arms, Muslims and Christians were to be treated equally, schools were organised and the authorities began rebuilding the island’s infrastructure, though taxes remained high and new protests emerged. After Egypt was defeated by the Turks in Syria, the Great Powers gave Crete back to the Ottomans in 1840. Under restored Ottoman rule, Cretans won important privileges allowing more religious freedom, civil and property rights. But the Sultan’s repeated violations of the new laws sparked yet another uprising and demand for enosis, or union, with free Greece. Although Russia was partial to the Cretan position, Great Britain and France preferred the status quo and refused any help. Rallying around the slogan ‘Union or Death’, fighting broke out in western Crete. Once again the Turks joined forces with the Egyptians and attacked the civilian population. In 1866 about 900 rebels and their families took refuge in Moni Arkadiou. When 2000 Turkish soldiers attacked the building, rather than surrender, the Cretans set light to a store of gunpowder. The explosion killed almost everyone, Turks included. The event shocked the world and the heroic stand gained the Cretan cause worldwide sympathy. Despite demonstrations erupting throughout Europe, Great Britain and France maintained a pro-Turkish stance. The Great Powers forbade Greece from aiding the Cretan rebels and the revolution petered out. The 1877 Russo-Turkish War prompted another uprising in Crete. Sensing that Turkey might be defeated, the Greek government decided to support Crete. Although the rebels seized major north-coast cities, the Berlin conference of 1878 resolving the Russo-Turkish War rejected Cretan union with Greece. Turkey made new concessions, turning Crete into a semi-autonomous province, sanctioning Greek as the official language and granting a general amnesty. In 1889 fierce political infighting within the Cretan parliament led to a new rebellion against Turkish rule, prompting Turkey to return to the iron-fisted policies of the past. In Sfakia, Manousos Koundouros formed a secret fraternity to secure autonomy and eventual unification for Crete. They laid siege on the Turkish garrison at Vamos, leading to violent reprisals and eventual intervention by the Great Powers. The Turks were forced to agree to a new constitution. When violence erupted again in 1896, the Greek government sent a small force to the island and declared unification between Crete and Greece. The Great Powers rejected the idea and blockaded the coast, refusing to allow either the Turks or the Greeks to reinforce their position. Greece became embroiled in a war with Turkey and recalled its forces. The Great Powers appointed Prince George, son of King George of Greece, as high commissioner of Crete.

The British swiftly rounded up 17 Turkish troublemakers, hanged them and sent a squadron of ships steaming into Iraklio harbour. The Turks were ordered out, finally ending Ottoman rule over Crete. After the disastrous Greek invasion of Smyrna, the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne called for a population exchange between Greece and Turkey to prevent future disputes. Crete’s remaining Muslim population of about 30,000 people was ordered off the island, abandoning their homes to the incoming Greek refugees. Ironically, many of them were Christians who had converted. Few legacies of Turkish rule survive in Crete. The most prominent are the old mosque in Hania harbour and the minarets and mosques in Rethymno, as well as remnants of Ottoman architecture in the cities’ old Turkish quarters.\n\nUNION WITH GREECE With the Ottomans gone, Crete was placed under international administration, but union with Greece remained an insatiable desire and would take some years to achieve. A new movement coalesced around the charismatic Hania-born Eleftherios Venizelos, one of the most important figures in Greek and Cretan politics. Venizelos was Prince George’s minister of justice and a member of the Cretan Assembly. In the face of Prince George’s stubborn refusal to consider unification, Venizelos convened a revolutionary assembly in Theriso, near Hania, in 1905, raising the Greek flag and declaring unity with Greece. Venizelos then set up a rival government to administer the island. The rebellion spread, forcing the Great Powers to concede that Prince George had lost all support. King George appointed a new governor but the populace continued to agitate for unification. In 1908 the Cretan assembly declared unity with Greece, but the Greek government refused to allow Cretan deputies to sit in the Greek parliament. Even though Venizelos had become prime minister, Greece remained fearful of antagonising Turkey and the Great Powers who were adamantly opposed to the plan. Not until Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria declared war on the Ottoman Empire over Macedonia in the first Balkan War (1912) were Cretans finally allowed into the Greek Parliament. When the war ended, the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest formally recognised Crete as part of the Greek state.\n\nWWII & THE BATTLE OF CRETE When German troops marched through Yugoslavia and invaded Greece on 6 April 1941, the country was rapidly overrun. Greek leader Emmanouil Tsouderos set up a government in exile in his native Crete. With all available Greek troops fighting the Italians in Albania, Greece asked Britain to help defend Crete.

The Allies were in a poor position to defend the island, since commitments in the Middle East were already draining military resources. The island’s defences had been seriously neglected. There were few fighter planes and military preparation was hampered by six changes of command in the first six months of 1941. Crete’s difficult terrain also meant the only viable ports were on the exposed northern coast, while inadequate roads precluded resupplying the army from the more protected southern ports. Hitler was determined to seize Crete and use it as an air base to attack British forces in the eastern Mediterranean. In a stunning disregard for Crete’s rebellious history, Hitler actually believed that German forces would be welcomed by the native population. They were not. After a week-long aerial bombardment, Hitler launched the world’s first airborne invasion on 20 May, starting what became known as the Battle of Crete, one of the decisive battles of the war. Aiming to capture the airport at Maleme 17km west of Hania, thousands of parachutists floated down over Hania, as well as Rethymno and Iraklio. Elderly men, women and children grabbed rifles, old shotguns, sickles and whatever else they could find to defend their homeland. German casualties were appalling, but they managed to capture the Maleme airfield on the first day and, despite the valiant defence, the Allies lost the battle within 10 days.\n\nPOSTWAR CRETE When the external threat of war and foreign occupation finally ended, Greece and the Allies were left to deal with the fraught internal politics of the nation. The mainland resistance had been dominated by communists. Winston Churchill wanted the king back and was afraid of a communist takeover. The 1946 election, which was boycotted by the communists, was won by the royalists with British backing. A rigged plebiscite put George II back on the throne and a brutal and divisive civil war broke out, lasting until 1949. Crete was largely spared the bloodshed and bitterness that left Greece a political and economic basket case in the 1950s. The close cooperation between the Cretans and British soldiers left the islanders with strong proBritish sentiments, leaving little room for communist infiltration. In 1967 Greece was thrown into turmoil again when a group of army colonels staged a coup d’état, which established a military junta that imposed martial law, abolished all political parties, banned trade unions, imposed censorship, and imprisoned, tortured and exiled thousands of Greeks who opposed it. Cretan resentment towards the colonels intensified when the colonels muscled through major tourist development projects on the island that were rife with favouritism.\n\n1900 Arthur Evans begins excavations at Knossos, quickly unearthing the palace and stunning the archaeological world with the discovery of the advanced Minoan civilisation.\n\n1905 A revolutionary assembly in Theriso declares unity with Greece.

In 1974 Turkish forces invaded Cyprus following a botched junta-sponsored attempt to depose Cyprus’ president, Archbishop Makarios. Discredited by the invasion, the junta was quickly dismantled. The ban on communist parties was lifted and Kostas Karamanlis’ rightwing New Democracy (ND) party won the 1974 elections. A national plebiscite voted 69% against restoration of the monarchy. Greece became a pluralist democratic republic and entered an unprecedented era of stability, peace and growth. That same year, the former Greek king and royal family fled to London where they live amongst the aristocracy, although they were stripped of most of their Greek assets in a long-running property dispute.\n\nDEMOCRACY & MODERN GREECE While it is positively dull in comparison to the past, contemporary Greek politics remains robust and colourful, with plenty of personal and financial scandals and regular accusations of graft, corruption and nepotism. Since the mid-1970s, Crete’s fortunes have been inextricably linked with the political, social and economic developments of mainland Greece, riding both the booms and the economic downturns.\n\n35\n\nApart from the fatal tsunami that wiped out the Minoans, Crete was hit by a far smaller tsunami in 1956 at Palekastro.

Nikos Kazantzakis vividly portrays the fighting Cretan spirit in his book based on a 19th-century Cretan Resistance fighter during the Turkish occupation in Freedom and Death. More recently, the valiant Cretan spirit won them the endearing admiration of British, Australian and New Zealand troops who fought in Crete during WWII. After the battle of Crete, the Cretans risked German reprisals by hiding thousands of Allied soldiers and helping them get to the south to escape across the Libyan Sea. Allied undercover agents supplied from North Africa coordinated the guerrilla warfare waged by the Cretan fighters, known as andartes. Allied soldiers and Cretans alike were under constant threat from the Nazis while they lived in caves, sheltered in monasteries such as Preveli, trekked across peaks or unloaded cargo on the southern coast. Among them was celebrated author Patrick Leigh Fermor, who lived in the mountains for two years with the Cretan Resistance and was involved in the daring kidnapping of German commander General Kreipe in 1944. German reprisals against the civilian population were fierce. Cities were bombed, villages burnt down and men, women and children lined up and shot. When the Germans finally surrendered in 1945 they insisted on surrendering to the British, fearing that the Cretans would inflict upon them some of the same punishment they had suffered for four years.\n\n1913\n\n1921\n\nGreece and Crete are officially united under the Treaty of Bucharest.\n\nGreek troops in Smyrna attack the Turks, but are routed and many Greek inhabitants are massacred.

Every May, war veterans from Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Greece attend commemoration celebrations held throughout Crete. Major anniversaries include a reenactment of the airborne invasion at Maleme, west of Hania. Participation of those who served on Crete has dwindled with time, but the anniversaries remain important memorials for Greeks and Allied ex-servicemen and there are regular battlefield tours of Crete. More than 1500 Allied soldiers are buried at the immaculate Souda Bay War Cemetery near Hania. Ironically, one of the long-term caretakers of the German war cemetery at Maleme, where 4500 soldiers are buried, was the late George Psychoundakis, the former shepherd boy whose story about being a runner during the German occupation is told in The Cretan Runner. There are also war memorials across the island, including a striking monument overlooking the cliffs at Moni Preveli and at Stravromenos on the north coast of Rethymno.\n\nAndreas Papandreou’s PASOK party – which formed Greece’s first socialist government – dominated Greek politics for two decades after it was elected in 1981. Papandreou’s populist pledge to remove US bases and withdraw from NATO was especially popular in Crete, given the islanders’ strong antipathy to the presence of foreign troops. US presence on the island was reduced, though there are still American and NATO bases operating in Crete and the US naval base at Souda Bay is a regular target for protests. After Greece joined the EU in 1981 (then the EEC), Crete’s farmers benefited from EU subsidies, and the island’s cultural and tourism infrastructure development was also bolstered. Tourism boomed with direct charter flights to Crete, almost tripling tourist arrivals between 1981 and 1991. The charismatic Papandreou’s significant reforms were marred by numerous scandals, including his public affair with a younger air hostess (whom he later married) and a financial scandal in the late ’80s involving the Bank of Crete, in which Papandreou and four ministers were charged with embezzlement (all were later acquitted). The ND party enjoyed a brief stint in government from 1990 when Konstantinos Mitsotakis, a Cretan, was elected prime minister, but corruption allegations and internal divisions returned PASOK to power three years later. In 1996 Papandreou’s ailing health finally forced him to step down as PASOK leader, ending a colourful era in Greek politics. His successor Costas Simitis, a straight-laced technocrat and economic reformer, led PASOK in a dramatic change of direction that included privatisation and reform of Greece’s notorious public sector.

Simitis handed the reins to Foreign Minister George Papandreou, son of Andreas, in January 2004 but despite Papandreou’s political pedigree and personal popularity – particularly in Crete – he was unable to save PASOK from a thumping defeat in two months later. Kostas Karamanlis’ ND party got the glory of presiding over the successful Athens 2004 Olympic Games, which became less about the sport and more about Greece proving it was a modern, developed nation, rather than the European backwater it had been seen. In the post-Olympics chapter of Greek history, ND did not make much headway in its efforts to get the Greek economy into shape in the face of the Olympics cost blow-outs, Greece’s premature (and rigged) entry into the euro zone, rising unemployment and inflation as well as attempts to reforms labour laws, social security, education and push through privatisation. In the summer of 2007, Greece plunged into an environmental and political crisis brought on by the massive fires that destroyed vast tracts of the country and killed 65 people. Yet, the ND government scraped back into power in the September national elections, with voters abandoning the major parties. The communist (KKE) party numbers were boosted and the nationalist LAOS party gained 10 seats, the first far-right party to enter the Greek Parliament since the end of military rule more than 30 years ago.

Crete remains a key PASOK stronghold, significantly outpolling ND at national elections. Crete’s often conflicting interests and divisions are now between the north coast tourist zone and the less developed south, between fertile and wealthy agricultural regions such as central Iraklio region and the southeast Lasithi greenhouse zone, and between poorer remote rural communities and increasingly sophisticated towns. Crete’s tourism doubled again between 1990 and 2000, largely due to the cheap package tourism boom, but the trend is causing much dismay among the rest of the industry who see few benefits and the impact on the island’s environment and resources. The need for sustainable tourism is becoming increasingly critical. The lack of planning and regulation is most evident in the overdeveloped north coast tourist zones, which have reached saturation point, while on the schizophrenic southeast coast you’ll see hotels built next to ugly greenhouses right on the coast. (Crete has 50% of Greece’s greenhouses but along with prosperity, anecdotal evidence suggests health problems and cancer rates in the Lasithi region have risen due to pesticide use.) The extension of the national highway to Sitia is considered pivotal to regional development of the east, but controversial tourism projects planned around Vai have locals divided, while major growth in the expanding beach resorts around Platanias in Hania suggest lessons have not been learnt. An alternative push for more sustainable green tourism – the potential of which has not been tapped – as well as agrotourism and more upmarket holidays has led to an increase in special-interest activities such as extreme sports, spas, golf, cultural tourism and culinary and winery tours. Overall the industry has had to shape up and become more professional than the sideline build-it-and-they-will-come approach of the past. In recent years there has been an increased focus on preserving Crete’s cultural identity and traditions in the face of globalisation. While environmental issues are gaining more prominence, consciousness is still very low. Agriculture remains a major force and way of life. While Crete has one of Greece’s highest levels of organic farming, it represents only a tiny percentage of the industry. Easier access to the mainland, better work and education opportunities and lifestyles have made Crete a more attractive place to live. The tide of young people moving away from the island has started to stem, while small but steady stream of people are abandoning Athens for life on Crete.

Proud, patriotic yet famously hospitable, Cretans uphold an undeniable connection to their culture. They will always identify as Cretans before they say they are Greek, and even within different parts of Crete people maintain strong regional identities. This becomes particularly apparent when you leave the commercialised major tourist centres. In rural areas, many Cretans still speak a local dialect or have a distinct accent. Centuries of battling foreign occupiers have left the island with a stubbornly independent streak that sometimes leads to clashes with Athens. National laws that conflict with local customs are often disregarded. Guns, for example, are strictly regulated in Greece, yet the evidence suggests Cretans are stashing an astounding arsenal (see the boxed text, p43). Nevertheless, the Cretan people have a well-justified reputation for hospitality and for treating strangers as honoured guests, a gesture of pride (and a hangover of historical territorialism) rather than subservience. Obviously Cretans are no longer offering free food and lodging to millions of tourists a year, but if you wander off the beaten track into mountain villages you may well be invited into someone’s home for a coffee or even a meal. In a café or taverna it is customary for people to treat another group of friends or strangers to a round of drinks (however, be mindful that it is not the done thing to treat them straight back – in theory you do the honours another time). Cretan society is deeply influenced by the Greek Orthodox Church and its rituals and celebrations (see p213 for a list of festivals and events). It maintains strong family ties and a sense of family honour. Crete’s infamous vendettas, while increasingly rare, have not entirely ended (see the boxed text, p97). Cretan weddings and baptisms are still huge affairs, and while shooting pistols in the air is becoming more politically incorrect (and dangerous – people have been accidentally hit and killed), it is still common in some areas, where bullet-riddled road signs are a characteristic part of the landscape. Rivalries between the prefectures are strong. As the island’s capital until 1971, Hania considers itself the historical heart of the island, while Rethymno claims to be its cultural centre. The dominant political ideology is left-of-centre with the socialist PASOK party repeatedly outdrawing the conservative New Democracy (ND) party in local and national elections. Cretans remain very ethnocentric, while anti-Americanism is another interesting undercurrent. Apart from general resistance to American hegemony, it originates from what many regard as undue US interference in Greek affairs during the civil war, suspected CIA involvement in the colonels’ coup of 1967, US indifference over Cyprus, and its interventions in the Middle East and the Balkans. In Crete this sentiment often culminates in protests over the US military base at Souda or is demonstrated in more subtle ways such as refusing to serve Coke. While there is often heated and forthright objection to American foreign policy, the ire is ideological and not extended to American tourists. Cretans who migrated to Athens or overseas (far fewer than in other regions of Greece) maintain strong cultural and family links, returning\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nT H E C U LT U R E • • L i fe s t y l e\n\n41\n\nCULTURAL TIES: IOANNA KARYSTIANI Hania-born author Ioanna Karystiani has lived in Athens since she was 18, but her heart has never left Crete. She regularly returns to Hania to spend time with her family, who moved to Crete from Turkey in the 1920s population exchange. ‘I sit in a room with my parents who are in their 90s now and hold them in my arms, my mother on the right, my father on the left, talking and telling mandinades (traditional rhyming couplets),’ she says. Karystiani, one of the Polytechnic generation who revolted against the colonels in 1973, is a former political cartoonist who turned to writing later in life. She is author of the 2004 movie Brides; her novel Koustoumi sto Homa is based on a family vendetta in Sfakia, the harsh mountain stronghold of the Cretan Resistance. Karystiani, 55, believes a land and its history and language feeds the next generation and shapes its character. ‘Cretans are fiery characters. The diversity and ruggedness of the land and the history of all the revolutions and wars has played a role in that. The Minoan civilisation was peaceful. In later years the hardship of life and the constant invaders have made the Cretans harsh and unique. They have a great pride in their land, which is often demonstrated positively; sometimes it can be expressed in a narrow, parochial way, with a sense of superiority, but most people are not like that.’ While in many other parts of Greece, traditional songs and music have been lost in the quest to become contemporary Europeans or not to be seen as retrograde, the Cretans, she says, have by and large maintained their culture. ‘In Crete there are thousands of children who learn how to play lyra and learn Cretan dances and are not embarrassed at all. They may also love rock, but they still tell and compose mandinades, and sing and dance and celebrate in the old way. They have brought that part of their culture into the present because it warms their hearts; it still speaks to them.’\n\nregularly. Even the island’s most remote villages are bustling during holidays, elections and other excuses for family reunions and homecomings.\n\nLIFESTYLE The Cretan lifestyle has changed dramatically in the past 30 years, the most obvious change being that life has got a lot easier. Cretan society has become increasingly urbanised, living standards have improved significantly, Cretans are conspicuously wealthier and the towns are full of sophisticated restaurants, bars and clubs. Cretans pride themselves on their capacity to enjoy life. You will see them dressed up and going out en masse for their evening volta (stroll), and filling cafés and restaurants. Like most households in Greece, the Cretans have felt the brunt of higher living costs since the introduction of the euro. Eating out has become much more expensive, although there are still many reasonably priced tavernas in Crete, particularly in the villages. Cretans often deal with the seasonal invasion of foreign tourists by largely operating in a different time-space continuum from their guests. They will often tell you a particular place is ‘only for tourists’, and that’s normally your cue to avoid it. From April to around October, many live in the hurly-burly of the coastal resorts – running shops, pensions or tavernas – and then return to their traditional life in the hills for the autumn olive and grape harvests. While tourists eat early in the evening in restaurants along a harbour or beach, Cretans drive out to a village taverna for a dinner that begins around 11pm. Often these tavernas produce their own meat and vegetables, saving on business costs and at the same time providing better food.\n\nGreece has the highest number of smokers in the EU and they smoke anywhere at any time. While smoking restrictions have been introduced with some success in public areas, nonsmoking areas in restaurants are still a rarity.\n\n42\n\nT H E C U LT U R E • • E c o n o m y\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nDOS & DON’TS Crete is a pretty laid-back destination but there are some cultural sensitivities to respect, particularly outside the main tourist resorts. Always dress appropriately when visiting a church or monastery. Women should wear skirts that reach below the knees, men should wear long trousers and arms, shoulders and cleavage should be covered (it is always handy to carry a sarong). Topless sunbathing is allowed in most places in Crete and nudism is tolerated at some remote beaches, though you should take the cue from people around you or check for signs asking you to keep your gear on (p103), especially if you are near a church or monastery or in a family area. Just because it’s hot, doesn’t mean men should walk around towns and villages without their shirts, just like you wouldn’t at home. If you are wondering why some villages and towns seem like ghost towns in the middle of the day, it’s because things shut down for mesimeri, the post-lunch siesta time (3pm to 5pm). Try to be quiet during these times and never call on anyone at home. While Cretans can probably drink you under the table, public drunkenness is frowned upon. Cretans take their hospitality seriously so if you are treated to a drink or meal, accept it graciously as rejecting it can cause offence. Do try to learn a few words of Greek, it’s always appreciated.\n\nGenerational and rural-city divides are another feature of modern Crete. In rural areas you will see shepherds with their flock in the mountains and men congregating in the kafeneia (coffee house) after their siesta. Mountain villages are repositories of traditional culture and you’ll find that many older women and many men are still clad in black garb (a symbol of mourning). But even pastoral life has changed. While people still live off the land – and provide for their families in the cities – subsistence farming has mostly given way to commercial production. Though you will still see the odd donkey, it has been replaced by the monstrous 4WD pick-up trucks and foreign workers do most of the grunt work. The younger generation of Cretans is highly educated and most speak English and often German as well. In the shift from living a largely poor, agrarian existence to becoming increasingly sophisticated urban dwellers, Cretans are also delicately balancing cultural and religious mores. Cretan society is still relatively conservative and it is uncommon for Greeks to move out of home until they are married, apart from leaving temporarily to study or work. The reasons for this are practical as well as cultural – most will get a house when they get married and who wants to do their own washing and cooking anyway?\n\nECONOMY Crete has ridden the wave of Greece’s economic growth in the past five years, and the increased availability of credit, has sparked a frenzied, if ultimately unsustainable, consumer spending boom. On the other hand, most households have felt the brunt of higher living costs since Greece joined the Euro Zone in 2001. Indeed, Crete’s per capita GDP and investment levels have been higher than the national average. Crete also has the highest rate of self-employed people in Greece (and amongst the highest in the EU). Crete’s farmers have reaped the benefits of EU membership, but tourism has replaced agriculture as the island’s dominant economic activity. Crete is nonetheless one of Greece’s biggest producers of olives and olive oil, vegetables (potatoes and\n\nlonelyplanet.com\n\nT H E C U LT U R E • • P o p u l a t i o n\n\n43\n\nTRIGGER-HAPPY Sitting in a café in Askyfou one afternoon, a man at the next table pulls out a semi-automatic pistol and fires a few rounds, just for fun. Late one night after a festival near Lissos, gunshots ring out every time the group of merry Cretans on the beach finishes a song. At Cretan weddings and celebrations, volleys of gunshots – and accidents from stray bullets – have become so common that many musicians refuse to play in certain areas unless they get an assurance that there won’t be any guns. In 2004 acclaimed composer Mikis Theodorakis led a campaign trying to change the island’s gun culture, but Cretans have not laid down their arms. Conservative estimates indicate one in two Cretans owns a gun, while others suggest there could be over one million weapons on Crete – more than the island’s population. Road signs riddled with bullet holes are the first inkling that you are entering the somewhat lawless mountain country that was historically a stronghold for Crete’s Resistance fighters, particularly around Sfakia and Mylopotamos province in Rethymno. A history of turmoil and invaders has made Cretans determined not to give up their guns, even though in theory the same restrictions apply in Crete as the rest of Greece. The endemic, machismo gun-ownership – and the act of shooting off a few rounds – is traditionally seen as an act of independence and pride (these days it’s also a reckless show of excess and an expensive habit). But gun mania is not just a cultural or historic hangover. Feuding and raiding is rife in the ‘devil’s triangle’ of Anogia, Zoniana and Livadia, a notorious centre for illegal arms and drugs, the deep ravines being a haven for concealing cannabis crops.\n\ntomatoes), oranges and wine, largely produced in fertile areas such as Iraklio’s Mesara plain. The massive spread of greenhouses in southern Lasithi have made the region prosperous. Stock breeding of sheep and goats is the other major sector. Crete has reaped the benefits of EU membership, while tourism has more than doubled since 1990, accounting for 40 per cent of jobs in the region and overtaking agriculture is some areas as the dominant industry.\n\nPOPULATION Crete is Greece’s most populous island with more than 600,000 residents. About 42% of the population live in Crete’s main cities and urban centres, with about 45% living in rural regions. Close to 49% of the population live in the Iraklio prefecture, which is double the size of the next biggest town, Hania.\n\nMULTICULTURALISM After the exodus of Crete’s Turkish community in the population exchange of 1923, Crete became essentially homogenous, and its population virtually all Greek Orthodox.
