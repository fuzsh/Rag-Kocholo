        "text": "The scene takes place at the house of Husam Husaim, the Aga of Pyrgos in Peloponnesos who had previously promised them an Albanian dance. Husaimâs physician was from the Ionian island of Zante and Georgaki was a steward of Said Aga, chieftain of the town of Lalla, further inland from Pyrgos.\n\nIn the evening we went, accompanied by our fat host GeorgÃ¡ki, to take leave of Husam Husaim: we were courteously received, but Husam expressed his chagrin at our leaving him so abruptly. He was attended by his secretary, his physician, and a Pyrgiote. Having drank coffee and smoked our pipes, Husam introduced wine; and the dragoman taking up his guitar, the physician and the Pyrgiote, warmed by drinking, leaped up to a mimic dance. The doctor showed considerable address with his heels, and raised them sometimes so high that they reached the ears of his partner. The dance, displaying the lowest buffoonery, was applauded by the Aga, who not having the fear of Mahomet before his eyes, took large draughts of wine. A French clerk to a mercantile house at Corone, entered and joined the dance. GeorgÃ¡ki now pulling off his upper tunic added himself to the number, and shaking his fat sides, increased the ludicrous appearance of the groupe. The Aga thought we participated with him in the pleasure of the dance and the music, which was accompanied with Turkish songs, forcing horrid screams and hideous faces. I could not help reflecting on the barbarism and ignorance that now reigned over a country once the most enlightened; and on the difference between these sottish orgies, and the noble games that attracted the ancient states of Greece to the plains of Olympia.\n\n- Robert Walpole: Travels in Various Countries of the East, London, 1820, p. 78-79\n\nJ.B.S. Morritt(1772-1843): Journey through Mainia in April 1795.\n\nPublished as part of a series of travel narratives by Robert Walpole in 1817. Mainia refers to a region in the southern part of the Peloponnesus in Greece. Morritt visited several villages in the area during Easter celebrations.\n\nThe following takes place at the village of Platsa [Î Î»Î±ÏÏÎ±] at the castle of one Capitano Christeia:\n\nWe dined with the family at twelve oâclock, and after dinner went to the great room of the castle. In it, and on the green before it, we found near a hundred people of both sexes and of all ages assembled, and partaking of the chiefâs hospitality. They flocked from all the neighbouring villages, and were dancing with great vivacity. The men, during the dance, repeatedly fired their pistols through the windows, as an accompaniment to their wild gaiety; and the shouts and laughter and noise were indescribable. Among other dances, the Ariadne, mentioned in De Guyâs Travels, was introduced, and many which we had not yet seen in Greece. The men and women danced together, which was not so usual on the continent as in the islands. On my complimenting the Capitano on the performance of his lyrist, who scraped several airs on a three-stringed rebeck, here dignified with the name of Î»ÏÏÎ·, a lyre, he told me with regret, that he had indeed been fortunate enough to possess a most accomplished musician, a German, who played not only Greek dances, but many Italian and German songs; but that in 1794 his fiddler, brought up in the laxer morals of western Europe, and unmindful of the rigid principles of the Maina, had so offended by his proposals the indignant chastity of a pretty woman in the neighbourhood, that she shot him dead on the spot with a pistol.\n\n- Robert Walpole: Memoirs relating to European and Asiatic Turkey, London, 1817, p. 52-53\n\nThe English poet George Gordon, Lord Byron (1788-1824) traveled through Spain, Greece, Albania and Turkey in 1809 and 1810. The preface to his poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812) states that it was \"begun in Albania\" (in Oct/Nov 1809).\n\nChilde Harold's Pilgrimage - Canto II\n\nXLVII\n\nAnd onward did his further journey take\n\nTo greet Albania's chief, whose dread command\n\nIs lawless law\n\nLVII\n\nThe Turk, the Greek, the Albanian, and the Moor,\n\nHere mingled in their many-hued array\n\nLVIII\n\nThe wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,\n\nWith shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,\n\nAnd gold-embroider'd garments, fair to see\n\nHere with a band of Albanians at Utraikey, the modern Greek town of Loutraki on the southeast coast of the Gulf of Arta in western Greece:\n\nLXXI\n\nOn the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,\n\nThe feast was done, the red wine circling fast,\n\nAnd he that unawares had there ygazed\n\nWith gaping wonderment had stared aghast;\n\nFor ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,\n\nThe native revels of the troop began;\n\nEach Palikar his sabre from him cast,\n\nAnd bounding hand in hand, man link'd to man,\n\nYelling their uncouth dirge, long daunced the kirtled clan.\n\nLXXII\n\nChilde Harold at a little distance stood\n\nAnd view'd, but not displeased, the revelrie,\n\nNor hated harmless mirth, however rude;\n\nIn sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see\n\nTheir barbarous, yet not indecent glee;\n\nAnd, as the flames along their faces gleam'd,\n\nTheir gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,\n\nThe long wild locks that to their girdles stream'd\n\nFrom Notes to Childe Harold's Pilgrimage:\n\nDervish [one of his Albanian attendants] excelled in the dance of his country, conjectured to be a remnant of the ancient Pyrrhic; be that as it may, it is manly, and requires wonderful agility. It is very distinct from the stupid Romaika, the dull round-about of the Greeks, of which our Athenian party had so many specimens.\n\nJohn Cam Hobhouse (1786-1869) was a schoolmate of Lord Byron at Cambridge and accompanied him on his travels in 1809 and 1810. He remained a lifelong friend of Byron and it was he who superintended his will and funeral upon the poet's death in 1824. He was later much involved in politics and writing and became Baron Broughton in 1851.\n\n[The Albanian section of his trip is also found published as John Hobhouse: A Journey Through Albania, New York, 1971, a reprint based on the 1817 Philadelphia edition]\n\nDescribing the Albanians:\n\nAlthough lazy in the intervals of peace, there is one amusement of which (as it reminds them of their wars, and is, in itself, a sort of friendly contest) they partake with the persevering energy and outrageous glee. I allude to their dances, which though principally resorted to after the fatigues of a march, and during their nights on the mountains, are yet occasionally their diversion on the green of their own villages.\n\nThere is in them only one variety: either the hands of the party (a dozen or more in number) are locked in each other behind their backs; or every man has a handkerchief in his hand, which is held by the next to him, and so on through a long string of them. The first is a slow dance. The party stand in a semicircle; and their musicians in the middle, a fiddler and a man with a lute, continue walking from side to side, accompanying with their music the movements, which are nothing but the bending and unbending of the two ends of the semicircle, with some very slow footing, and now and then a hop.\n\nBut in the handkerchief dance, which is accompanied by a song from themselves, or which is, more properly speaking, only dancing to a song, they are very violent. It is upon the leader of the string that the principal movements devolve, and all the party take this place by turns. He begins at first opening the song, and footing quietly from side to side; then he hops quickly forward dragging the whole string after him in a circle; and then twirls round, dropping frequently on his knee, and rebounding from the ground with a shout; every one repeating the burden of the song, and following the example of the leader, who, after hopping, twirling, dropping on the knee, and bounding up several times round and round, resigns his place to the man next to him. The new Coryphaeus leads them through the same evolutions, but endeavours to exceed his predecessor in the quickness and violence of his measures; and thus they continue at this sport for several hours, with very short intervals, seeming to derive fresh vigour from the words of the song, which is perhaps changed once or twice during the whole time.\n\nIn order to give additional force to their vocal music, it is not unusual for two or three old men of the party to sit in the middle of the ring, and set the words of the song at the beginning of each verse, at the same time with the leader of the string; and one of them has often a lute to accompany their voices.\n\nIt should have been told that this lute is a very simple instrument- a three-stringed guitar with a very long neck and a small round base, whose music is very monotonous, and which is played with what I shall be excused for calling a \"plectrum\", made of a piece of quill half an inch in length. The majority of the Albanians can play on this lute, which, however, is only used for, and capable of, those notes that are just sufficient for the accompaniment and marking the time of their songs.\n\nThe same dance can be executed by one performer, who, in that case, does not himself sing, but dances to the voice and lute of a single musician. We saw a boy of fifteen, who, by some variation of the figure, and by the ease with which he performed the \"pirouette\" and the other difficult movements, made a very agreeable spectacle of this singular performance.\n\n- Lord Broughton: Travels in Albania and other provinces of Turkey in 1809 & 1810, London, New Edition, 1858, Vol 1, p. 143-145\n\n- John Hobhouse: A Journey Through Albania, New York, 1971, p. 135-136\n\nAt the town of Loutraki in western Greece, describing their Albanian entourage:\n\nIn the evening the gates were secured, and preparations were made for feeding our Albanians. A goat was killed, and roasted whole, and four fires were kindled in the yard, round which the soldiers seated themselves in parties. After eating and drinking, the greater part of them assembled round the largest of the fires, and, whilst ourselves and the elders of our party were seated on the ground, danced round the blaze to their own songs, in the manner before described, but with astonishing energy. All their songs were relations of some robbing exploits. One of them, which detained them more than an hour, began thus - \"When we set out from Parga, there were sixty of us\"; then came the burden of the verse, \"Robbers all at Parga! Robbers all at Parga!\" and as they roared out this stave, they whirled round the fire, dropped, and rebounded from their knees, and again whirled round, as the chorus was again repeated.\n\n- Lord Broughton, Travels ..., Vol. 1, p. 166-167\n\n- John Hobhouse, A Journey ..., p. 169-170\n\nOn Greek women's dancing:\n\nTheir dancing they learn without a master, from their companions. The dance, called Î§Î¿ÏÎ¿Ï, and, for distinction, Romaica, consists generally in slow movements, the young women holding by each other's handkerchiefs, and the leader setting the step and time, in the same manner as in the Albanian dance. The dancers themselves do not sing; but the music is a guitar, or lute, and sometimes a fiddle, accompanied by the voice of the players. When, however, men are of the party, there is a male and female alternately linked, and the performance is more animated, the party holding their handkerchiefs high over their heads, and the leader dancing through them, in a manner which, although at the time it reminded me only of our game of thread-the-needle, has been likened by some observers to the old Cretan labyrinth dance, called Geranos, or the Crane. When the amusement is to be continued throughout a night, which is often the case, the figures are various; and I have seen a young girl, at the conclusion of the dance described, jump into the middle of the room, with a tambourine in her hand, and immediately commence a pas seul, some favourite young man whom she had warned of her intention striking the strings of the guitar at the same time, and regulating the dance and music of his mistress. We once prevailed on a sprightly girl of fifteen to try the Albanian figure, and her complete success of the first attempt showed the quickness and versatility of her talents for this accomplishment.\n\n- Lord Broughton, Travels ..., Vol. 1, p. 452\n\nColonel William Leake (1777-1860) was born in London and educated at the Royal Military Academy. He was sent to Constantinople by the British government to train the Turks in artillery, the Ottoman Empire being then a British ally. He surveyed large areas of Greece and Albania for the Turks in the war against Napoleon and was later the British representative at the court of the famous Ali Pasha.\n\nThis short notice is from his travels in 1809-1810, at a place just north of Ioannina in Greece on the festival of Saint John:\n\nSome of the gayest, clothed in gorgeous dresses of Albanian lace and embroidery, were dancing the ÎÏ ÎºÎ»Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï Î§Î¿ÏÎ¿Ï in circles on the grass.\n\n- William M. Leake: Travels in Northern Greece, London, 1835, Vol. IV, p. 88\n\nHenry Holland, M.D., F.R.S. (1788-1873), a distant relative of Charles Darwin, obtained his medical degree at the university of Edinburgh in 1811 and then spent a year and a half traveling through Greece and the Aegean. In later life he was a successful doctor, and was physician to the royal family.\n\nOct. 28, 1812 at a small palace belonging to Ali Pasha at Salaora on the shore of the Gulf of Arta:\n\n- Henry Holland: Travels in the Ionian Isles, Albania, Thessaly, Macedonia, &c, during the years 1812 and 1813, London, 1815 (Reprint New York, 1971), p. 79-80\n\nIn a description of the life and customs of the Greeks of Ioannina:\n\n- Ibid, p. 167-168\n\nAli Pasha visiting the house of a leading Greek citizen of Ioannina:\n\n- Ibid, p. 189\n\nAt a ball in Athens given by an English resident of Athens, the Honourable Frederic North, in January of 1813:"
