        "text": "Honey, the gift of the gods according to the ancient Greeks. Honey and the bee were protagonists in mythology. The god Apollo owed his dazzling beauty to the honey and ambrosia he fed on. Apollo's son, Aristaeus, who was made with the nymph Cyrene, became immortal because he was fed with honey nectar and ambrosia. Moreover, he was the first ancient figure who dealt with honey and beekeeping, hence he became the protector of honey.\n\nHippocrates used honey for the treatment of many diseases, while Aristotle believed that honey prolongs life. A symbol of fertility, happiness, and well-being.\n\nThe process of making honey is as follows: After bees collect nectar from the plant, it goes through a special process in their bodies and their secretions from the prolobus transform it into honey, which they deposit in the cells (frames) of the honeycomb inside their beehive. There, they dehydrate it by reducing its moisture to as low as 18%. Once it has matured, they seal it with wax so it can be preserved.\n\nThen it's time to collect the honey, which is done when the moisture level is between 14%-18%. If the moisture is higher than 18%, our honey is at serious risk of spoiling.\n\nPure honey, not adulterated, can be simply identified in the following way: In a glass of water, drop a spoonful of honey. Without stirring it, pure honey will sit at the bottom of the glass unchanged. If it contains syrup, we will slowly see it dissolve on its own.\n\nWhen honey crystallizes, it doesn't mean it's adulterated as some think, nor if it is thick. Crystallized honey is due to its glucose content from the composition of the honey, as we will see below in the types of honey. The safest way is to slowly bring it back in a bain-marie but not exceeding 35o -40o degrees (that's also why it's not good to put honey in hot beverages. The correct way is to let the temperature of the drink drop so as not to lose the beneficial ingredients of the honey. If we add honey directly into hot water, all we achieve is to sweeten our drink) or on top of a radiator. Never in the sun because it will destroy its beneficial ingredients.\n\nHoney is properly preserved in a shady and cool place. An open jar for a long time spoils because it absorbs the humidity of the air and changes its antibacterial properties. It is therefore good to use it within a short period after opening it to have all its nutritional ingredients. And let's not forget that honey has been found in tombs and shipwrecks that date back thousands of years before. And this is due to its airtight sealing.\n\nThere are monofloral honeys, which we get the nutritional properties from a single plant that the bee has collected from. However, it's a bit difficult to do this, but not impossible.\n\nIn Greece, more and more beekeepers are trying to produce organic honey. The honey that has not used any chemical formulation inside and outside the beehive. This is quite difficult because we cannot have full control of where the bee goes, which areas it is in (polluting up to 4 kilometers, etc.), what plants it has gone to, if they are sprayed, even if the beehive has been painted.\n\nPure, unadulterated honey can be obtained from producers, taking care to know the honey we will buy, first by its color and smell, verifying its reliability with a taste test.\n\nLet's take a look at some types of honey:\n\nAcacia Honey\n\nAcacia honey is light and almost transparent in color. It has beneficial properties for cleansing the liver, calming the nervous system, thus aiding in combating insomnia, stress, and anxiety. It helps with respiratory system diseases and intestinal function. It is considered one of the therapeutic honeys and can be consumed in small quantities by diabetics. It is recommended for children and the elderly.\n\nFlower Honey\n\nFlower honey has the sweetest taste among all honeys. It is light-colored and has a smooth taste. It crystallizes relatively quickly due to its high glucose content. The crystallization of honey is natural, and it does not affect the honey's nutritional and biological value. A crystallized honey is neither adulterated nor spoiled. We can return it to a liquid state by gently warming it in a bain-marie.\n\nHeather Honey\n\nHeather honey is considered one of the rare honeys because bees find it difficult to penetrate the narrow calyx of the heather flower to collect the nectar. Thus, in their effort to collect the nectar, they become exhausted and weakened. Heather honey is primarily produced in Epirus, Greece, because heather grows in rocky and stony soils. Hence, in addition to the difficulties of the bees, the quantity is also challenging as it is not produced every year. It has a yellowish, thick consistency with a strong and distinctive taste. It strengthens the body, revitalizes, and combats the feeling of physical fatigue.\n\nFir Honey\n\nFir honey is one of the most widespread honeys produced in our country. It is produced in areas like Mount Olympus, Evritania, Pertouli, Taygetos, and in many other regions of Greece. The fir is considered the most important honey-producing plant in Greece. It is the honey that the elderly prefer due to its low sugar content. It crystallizes slowly because of its low glucose content. It is considered a honey of high nutritional value due to the large number of different substances in its composition. Rich in minerals (magnesium, zinc, copper, iron, etc.), it helps with cough and uric acid arthritis. It is also an excellent remedy for throat conditions. It reduces ulcer problems, aids in constipation, and is recommended for people with diabetes, athletes, and children.\n\nOrange Blossom Honey\n\nOrange blossom is a significant source of nectar. A rare honey, it is particularly aromatic, providing an intense and wonderful fragrance. Its taste is especially sweet, making it more popular among children. Thus, it crystallizes very quickly and is recommended to be consumed within a short period. It is a source of energy for the human body, with carbohydrates in the form of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Contains minerals and trace elements. Calcium, potassium, copper, antioxidants, has precious antibacterial, anti-aging, and anti-cancer properties. It helps the immune system and combats pathogenic microorganisms, providing protection against oxidative damage to the DNA molecules of cells.\n\nPine Honey\n\nThe pine is considered the most significant honey-producing plant in Greece. Major productions of pine honey are in Northern Evia, Halkidiki, Thasos, Skopelos, Zakynthos, and Rhodes. Pine honey accounts for 65% of the total honey production in Greece. It is the honey preferred by the elderly due to its low sugar content. It crystallizes slowly due to its low glucose content. It is considered a honey of high nutritional value because it contains a large number of different substances. Rich in minerals, it helps with coughs and uric acid arthritis. It also makes an excellent remedy for throat conditions. It lowers cholesterol, aids the urinary and digestive systems, and is recommended for people with diabetes, athletes, and children.\n\nSunflower Honey\n\nSunflower honey is readily produced as sunflowers abundantly provide nectar during the summer months. However, during the nectar collection in summer, the collector bees become exhausted and suffer from melanization. They lose their hair and become black. For this reason, beekeepers do not allow sunflowers near their beehives for extended periods. In Greece, it's mainly produced in Northern Greece, Macedonia, Thrace, and Evros. The honey from sunflowers is golden-yellow with a full taste, fluid, and one of the most common honeys available in commerce.\n\nThyme Honey\n\nOne of the highest quality honeys produced in our country. It falls under floral honeys but is a special category due to its intense aromas and flavor characteristics. It is the most commonly preferred honey by consumers. The production of thyme honey accounts for about 10% of Greece's total honey production. The main areas of thyme honey production in Greece are the islands, especially Crete and Kythira.\n\nIts flavor is strong, and in some cases, due to high fructose content, it leaves a slight burning sensation in the mouth. It is intensely aromatic honey, with an amber color, though it varies by region (orange in Crete, lighter in Attica and the Cyclades).\n\nIt has tonic and antiseptic properties, rich in phosphorus, magnesium, and iron.\n\nRecommended for children and is the number one choice during periods of colds and viruses.\n\nChestnut Honey\n\nProduced from the honeydew secretions of the chestnut tree. It is produced in the mountainous regions of Greece and is mainly collected in the Mount Athos peninsula and is limited in production. The taste of chestnut honey is very intense and slightly bitter. The color ranges from light to dark brown, and due to its low sugar content, it crystallizes after 1-2 years. It has significant antibacterial activity against various microorganisms, such as staphylococcus, enterococcus, helicobacter pylori, and candida species. It also has a high antibacterial activity such that in some areas it is used to cover chronic wounds, burns, and skin ulcers. It boosts mental clarity, helps with pregnancy and venous insufficiency.\n\nRich in minerals, it is recommended for the elderly and babies, for athletes, and for those with prostate issues and diabetes.\n\nOrange Blossom Honey\n\nOrange blossom is an important source of nectar. It is a rare honey, highly aromatic with an intense and lovely scent. The taste is exceptionally sweet, making it more favored by children. Thus, it crystallizes very quickly and is recommended for consumption within a short time span. It is a source of energy for the human body, with carbohydrates in the form of glucose, fructose, and sucrose. Contains minerals and trace elements. It has valuable antibacterial, anti-aging, and anti-cancer properties. It aids the immune system and the fight against pathogenic microorganisms, offering protection from oxidative damage to the DNA molecules in cells.\n\narbutus honey\n\nThe arbutus tree is considered the most significant apicultural plant in Greece. Major production areas of pine honey include Northern Evia, Halkidiki, Thasos, Skopelos, Zakynthos, and Rhodes. Pine honey constitutes 65% of the total honey production in Greece. It's the honey preferred by the elderly due to its low sugar content. It crystallizes slowly because of its low glucose content. Considered high in nutritional value, it's rich in minerals and helps with coughs and uric acid arthritis. Also, it's an excellent remedy for throat conditions, reduces ulcer issues, aids constipation, and is recommended for people with diabetes, athletes, and children.\n\nGreek pies are so much more than just a dish. They are a cultural heritage, a symbol of Greek hospitality, and a gastronomic delight that has been preserved unchanged for centuries. From ancient times, when pies were often offered to the gods as a sign of gratitude for the harvest, to our days, when every celebration and family meal seems to be accompanied by a pie, the tradition is vividly kept alive. Essentially pastries, with or without dough, simple or complex, quick or time-consuming, with various fillings, sweet or savory, fasting or festive, depending on the region. Throughout Greece, we encounter similar pies with different names that depend on the place and the products that housewives used to have at home, making pies to feed the family.\n\nIn every Greek region, the pie has its own unique variation. The ingredients may change depending on the seasons and local production, but the essence remains the same: fresh, quality ingredients, real flavors, and a lot of love in the preparation.\n\nFrom the kneaded dough that requires skill and patience to the rich filling that often consists of simple, but flavor-rich, ingredients of the Greek land, the pies reflect the Greek ability to turn the simple into something marvelous.\n\nIn many areas in Greece in the old days, a serious criterion for a girl to become a bride was that she had to know how to masterfully open a thin dough and to make intricate designs on bread and the decoration of cookies.\n\nIt was a saving solution for housewives, as they put in for their children at school, for their husbands at work, or a piece for dinner with a sage or chamomile. Grandmothers in the mountain villages where snow was common made dry pies. From spring when the various herbs came out tender, until autumn they gathered herbs, which they made into bunches, and dried them in a well-ventilated shady place. Then they put them in fabric bags or pillowcases that they had salted. That is, they had dipped them in a solution with a lot of salt, they had dried up and thus put the dried herbs inside, protecting them from insects. Later, when they wanted to make a pie in the winter, they just soaked them in water and they were ready to use as if fresh.\n\nIn most parts of Greece, we have pies that do not have dough but instead use a cornmeal slurry. And you had to be a craftsman to properly bake the corn slurry, so it would make a crunchy crust on top and inside the herbs were ready. And let's not forget that in the old days, pies were baked in a clay pot with a rounded lid, inside nestled coals. They placed the pie, and covered it around and also on top with coals to have a uniform baking. Later they baked pies in the stove, and finally, in today's era in the electric oven.\n\nWhether sweet or savory, each pie has its own story to tell, a story full of aromas, flavors, and the Greek tradition that continues to live through its simple recipes that pass from generation to generation. Each cooking and every bite is a journey through time and space, starting from ancient Greece and reaching up to modern Greek tables.\n\nThey are not just part of the diet but a piece of Greek identity. At every celebration, observance, or meeting, the pie has its honor. At Christmas, Easter, even at engagements or weddings or baptisms, pies always have a place. It represents generosity, community, and prosperity. The process of opening the dough, preparing the filling, and cooking with patience and care is a form of expressing love.\n\nWith a multitude of traditional recipes that are as luxurious in taste as they are simple in execution, pies are the food that accompanies Greeks from the happiest to the most challenging times. It is an expression of Greek life, a life full of flavors, aromas, and the value of sharing.\n\nThe world moves forward and so does the way of processing dough. In today's era, there are ready-made dough sheets in commerce, which have solved our hands, because if we want to make a pie, we just make the filling, and the dough is ready for us to proceed with our pie for baking. But if we want to make the dough ourselves, there are kitchen machines that will knead the dough nicely and effortlessly, so we can easily and quickly open our homemade dough.\n\nThe most widespread pies are tyropita (cheese pie), spanakopita (spinach pie), prasopita (leek pie), zambonotyropita (ham and cheese pie), bougatsa, milopita (apple pie), kolokythopita (pumpkin pie), etc. but let's not forget the traditional pies with local names, which have grown generations and generations.\n\nUltimately, Greek pies are not just a food, they are a gastronomic experience that one can find only in the rich and diverse Greek cuisine. Whether served warm and crunchy or cold as a snack, pies remain favorites in every Greek home and table. Let's take a closer look at some of them.\n\nFlour Pie (Alevropita)\n\nThis is the easiest, quickest, and very tasty pie you can make since its ingredients are very few and basic in the house. It comes from Zagori and is the most common pie for breakfast, as an appetizer, next to a salad, for a snack, for afternoon tea, for dinner with tea, for school, for work, and more... It has only 4 ingredients and its taste is unforgettable. Flour, eggs, cheese, butter. It doesn't have a dough and is essentially a batter that we place in a baking dish and bake, resulting in a very thin and very delicious pie. I have also encountered this pie at the foothills of Olympus, in a village I visited (Rapsani), where they make it inside a wood-fired oven.\n\nEgg Pie from Roumeli\n\nEgg pie is a different kind of pie, which is enriched with eggs and cheeses. It is usually made during the Cheesefare Week since the great Lent is about to begin and they needed to use up all the eggs and cheeses to start collecting eggs for 40 days for the Easter egg dyeing. So, essentially, the egg pie was like a cheese pie with various cheeses inside but they put quite a few eggs, milk, butter, and of course traditional phyllo dough from the housewives who opened it intricately, making designs around the rim. It had its honorary place at the table since for 40 days they would not eat these ingredients again.\n\nVasilopita (New Year's Cake)\n\nThe pie of Saint Basil. We make it on the eve of the New Year and cut it as soon as the year changes. We will most often find the politiki (from Constantinople) and smyrneiki (from Smyrna) vasilopita. One is fluffy with spices and nuts, and the other resembles tsoureki (sweet bread), aromatic and very tasty. In Western Macedonia, in some villages instead of vasilopita, they have leek pie or cheese pie. In all versions, we have one common element. The coin that is placed inside for good luck of the year. The head of the household cuts the vasilopita, who will first cut pieces for Christ (and Virgin Mary), for Saint Basil, and for the poor.\n\nGalatopita (Milk Pie)\n\nThe Messinian galatopita is the traditional dessert of the area. It is seen on festive tables, at Christmas, but also after Easter, as well as during the Cheesefare Week. Generally, we will encounter galatopites all over Greece, in many variations. With or without semolina, with or without phyllo, even a fasting version with almond milk.\n\nLesvos Giouzlemedes (Lesvos Cheese Pies)\n\nGiouzlemedes are traditional fried cheese pies from Lesvos. Their name comes from the Turkish word \"goz\" which means eye, reflecting the small bubbles that form on their surface during frying. In Lesvos, they are found as a meze, accompanied by ouzo from Mytilene, served as an appetizer, in salads, and also in all homes where housewives make them in various shapes (triangles, squares).\n\nWalnut Pie (Karydopita)\n\nA traditional syrupy dessert that looks like a cake and contains walnut meal. We find it both in a fasting version and with butter. In our country, the distinguished one is the Gianniotiko walnut pie, famous for its deliciousness. Its appearance is dark due to the walnuts, as well as the spices such as cinnamon and the raisins. Often it is also found with a chocolate topping.\n\nCake\n\nThe cake is a sweet, fluffy dough that we bake in the oven. It's a favorite snack for all of us since we can make it at any time we want at home. It contains butter, milk, eggs, flour, and baking powder, and we bake it in round or rectangular molds. We find it in various flavors, such as banana, lemon, chocolate, vanilla, orange, etc. As a type of cake, we can also include wedding cakes, birthday cakes, or festive cakes like Christmas, Carnival, Easter cakes which we adjust in flavor according to the occasion.\n\nEpirus Pie (Kothropita)\n\nA supreme pie!! An unusual pie, I might say, which the Epirotes made with boiled meat and rice. The meat could be lamb, veal, or even chicken. They boiled the meat, then shredded it, keeping the broth. They opened a dough sheet, placed the meat around the edge, covered it with the dough, and in the middle, they put rice with the meat broth. They baked it in a hot oven, and the whole house smelled wonderful. A festive pie, seen at Christmas tables, weddings, baptisms, etc.\n\nSavory Pumpkin Pie (Kolokythopita)\n\nThe savory pumpkin pie is made with green zucchini, grated and well-drained, with the addition of feta or myzithra cheese. Wonderful as an appetizer or snack. It can be found with various herbs to give flavor and aroma, embraced and baked with crispy phyllo dough or handmade country-style dough.\n\nSweet Pumpkin Pie.\n\nThe sweet pumpkin pie is made with the orange pumpkin. After it's grated and drained, it's baked with raisins, nuts, and various spices such as cinnamon and clove, in a delicate, crispy dough or in handmade country-style dough. We encounter it more in winter because pumpkins start to be collected from late autumn. Thus, the sweet pumpkin pie is particularly beloved by children due to its wonderful taste, and it is a staple at every Christmas table!\n\nChalkidiki Lazy Pie (Kolombaropita)\n\nKnown as the \"lazy pie\" in Chalkidiki, it's something between a pie, batzina (savory pumpkin pie), tart, and sfougato (omelette pie). It's an easy pie where you don't need to open a dough sheet, and the housewives made it to quickly feed their family with whatever ingredients were in the fridge, based on cornmeal. So, Kolombaropita would be made with various vegetables, cheeses, eggs, yogurt, etc.\n\nKourkouto (Cornmeal Pie)\n\nIt is a pie made with cheeses or vegetables, trachanas (soured wheat), without a dough sheet. To bind this pie, we use flour, milk, eggs, and the main ingredient (cheeses, vegetables, etc.) and bake it in the oven in a baking tray. Each place has its own version of the pie. In Metsovo, there is a wonderful pie with their smoked cheese combined with bacon and onion or leek.\n\nMeat Pie (Kreatopita)\n\nThe meat pie is an international pie that we find in countless variations of meat types, cuts, combinations, pie shapes, and baking methods. In Kefalonia, there is the traditional meat pie with pork, beef, lamb, or goat combined with rice, tomato paste, and dough kneaded with wine. In Ioannina, Thrace, etc., they combined the meat with leek, onions, feta. That is, whatever each place produces more. As we see generally around the world, the meat pie has been adapted according to habits and material productions. For example, in India, we find meat pies where lamb or chicken was mixed with spices such as coriander, etc., making \"samosa\" enhanced with peas and lentils. In Latin America, the meat had intense spices, peppers, and they enhanced the filling with salami, cheese,egg, etc. In the Middle East, they use spices, tahini, tomatoes, pine nuts, yogurt, and usually beef in what they call \"sfiha.\" In Australia and New Zealand, they enhance the meat with bacon and onions. In Germany, the meat pie has plenty of butter, and pieces from various sausages to enhance the flavor. Their meat is marinated with beer and served with cabbage.\n\nMykonos Onion Pie (Kremmydopita Mykonou)\n\nA traditional pie from Mykonos, which includes both dry and fresh onions with plenty of dill and fennel, and the flavor is bound together with tyrovolia cheese.

They are addictive once you start eating and are often offered as a treat in baskets.\n\nSausage Pie (Loukanikopita)\n\nLoukanikopita, a dish said to have come from Germany, has become particularly popular and was a quick snack to satisfy hunger. The dough was made from village-style phyllo or a simple dough, where there were both fried and baked versions of the pie. There was a wide variety of sausages, so the combination of fillings produced excellent results. In addition to sausage, flavors were complemented by cheeses, cabbage, various sauces, and even leftovers from meals. Today, loukanikopitas come in a wide variety due to the variety of meat in the sausage, spices, and additional ingredients that make the sausage tastier.\n\nLoukoumades\n\nLoukoumades (lokma in Turkish, meaning bite) are made from a yeast dough batter. This popular sweet, spherical in shape, is served with chocolate, honey, cinnamon, syrup, or sugar. They are also known as \"sfingi\" by the Greek Jewish community who offered them as a Christmas dessert.

We also have stuffed loukoumades with seasonal fruits.\n\nMacaroni Pie (Makaronopita)\n\nAn easy pie that can be found with phyllo dough, as a batter, or even as a tart.
