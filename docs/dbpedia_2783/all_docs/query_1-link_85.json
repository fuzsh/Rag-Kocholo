        "text": "(Book website: https://www.peterlang.com/document/1062267) For so long, scholarship in the West has argued that the memory of Saladin, the renowned, twelfth-century Kurdish-Muslim ruler, along with the memory of the Crusades, was “all but forgotten” in Islamic history prior to the onset of the modern period. Although recent studies have slowly begun to overturn this thesis, however, research on the topic so far has continued to neglect the many accounts on Saladin’s reign and the Crusades found in late medieval and early modern Arabo-Islamic historiography. This lacunae in scholarship is even more compelling considering that the sources dating from the early sixteenth to the late eighteenth centuries reveal a rich record of Saladin’s achievements; the sources also include numerous reports on other major Muslim figures who fought the Crusades, such as the Zengid ruler Nūr al-Dīn and the famous Mamlūk sultans Baybars and Qalawūn. Therefore, the present study will posit the hypothesis that Saladin’s reign and accomplishments, along with the history of the Crusades in the region, were etched into the historical memory of the Muslim world long after the end of the epoch. It will advance this thesis by exploring the much-neglected Arabo-Islamic historiographical sources dating from the early sixteenth to late eighteenth centuries, such as the universal chronicles, biographical dictionaries, and other historiographical genres. Based on this explorative survey, the study will further advance the emerging thesis that the memory of Saladin was not neglected after his death, but, rather, the Kurdish sultan’s career, along with the Age of the Crusades in general, left a lasting impression on the Islamic Near East during the late medieval and early modern period.\n\nThe image of Saladin as known in the contemporary Arab world is the result of a long evolution through popular culture. The character of Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (Saladin) was mediated many times in 20th-century Arab popular media. His odyssey started in the genre of drama during the Arab Enlightenment, then continued in Egyptian cinema, Syrian television dramas and latterly animated films. The character of what became the “enlightened Arab/Muslim ruler” was first discovered by the authors of minority groups in the late 19th century, and was subsequently used by Arab political forces, who inspired and also supported artists to make popular adaptations in order to draw analogies between past and present. This article aims to prove that it was most probably the later narratives presented by theatre and film rather than ideological works that inspired Arab politicians to use Saladin’s memory for their own sakes, and that it was the Saladin images presented in Arab cinema and television that played a crucial role in shaping the popular image of Saladin in the contemporary Arab world. Movies and serials not only play an increasingly important role in reshaping representations of history but have become a main source for learning about particular historical events. The character of Saladin has been adapted and appropriated not only to teach people about their past, but to support political agendas of the present as well.\n\nThis thesis seeks to uncover and understand the strange historical journey of the Muslim Sultan Yusuf ibn Ayyub, known to the West as Saladin. The historic Saladin was a ruler famous for his successful campaigns against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, his victory at the Battle of Hattin, and his holding action against the Third Crusade. Upon Saladin’s death in 1193, he became the subject of numerous legends, most of which describe him as a merciful, chivalric, and ideal leader of men. The epitome of what a thirteenth century European noble was supposed to be. This thesis seek to explain how these legends helped form cultural identities, it will also show how the legends of Saladin evolved over time, through a direct comparison between the legend’s role in the thirteenth century and the twentieth century. Further, this thesis will show how these legends, rather than being simple justifications for Saladin’s success and behavior, are in fact a vehicle which historians and writers can use to better understand English and French medieval culture, and how those two cultural groups defined themselves as societies. Despite vast cultural changes to England and France over those seven hundred years, the legends would again be used to help define the identity of those two nations. Not only is this thesis trying to justify Saladin’s success and behavior, these later legends are deeply intertwined with justifications for imperialism and scientific racism. The unpacking of these legends will not only help the reader to better understand who Saladin truly was, but understand the culture of Europe as well.\n\nIbn al-Athīr, ‘Izz al-Dīn Abū al-Ḥasan ‘Alī al-Jazarī (1160-1233) the historian of Mosul has been put in first place alongside his contemporary Ibn Shaddād for the study of Saladin’s life. But on the contrary Gibbs also accuses Ibn al-Athīr of giving a ‘malicious twist’ to the history of al-Isfahānī. Can both statements be justified without contradicting the other; I believe it of great significance to try and understand the ‘mind’ of the author alongside the surroundings he finds himself in. I will therefore analyse from the muqaddima (foreword) of al-kāmil, what Ibn al-Athīr believes to be the objective of History and its worldly benefits. I will focus on the account of Saladin’s death in order to understand the medieval traditionalism at work in al-kāmil and contemporary works and explore the dualism in Ibn al-Athīrs description of Saladin. Finally I will briefly mention some criticism of Gibbs’ understanding of Ibn al-Athīr by Yaacov Lev. My main objective throughout, however, is to explore whether Ibn al-Athīr is wholesome negative of Saladin or is his analysis more complex in nature than what is generally thought."
