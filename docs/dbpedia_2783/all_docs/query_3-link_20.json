        "text": "Hello All and welcome back to the Shed.\n\nToday I am going to report on our attempt to refight the 12th century Battle of Hattin. By all accounts this was the first and most deadly nail in the coffin for the Crusader states in the Palestine and the growing powerbase of the Saracen King, Saladin.\n\nWe have already fought one of the other major battles several times in this period - the Battle of Arsuf - This Link will take you straight there, and I was keen to develop another option that could be hosted as a game for my Shed Wars Experience.\n\nThis game would be played twice over consecutive nights with learnings from the first game incorporated into the second. This post will share the orders of battle , a short summary of the games and of course lots of photos.\n\nBefore I proceed I should acknowledge that inspiration and the basis of the orders of battle was taken from an Italian blog site and the link can be found here.\n\nBackground to The Battle of Hattin\n\nThe Battle of Hattin took place on the 4th July 1187 between the Crusader States lead by the King of Jerusalem , Guy de Lusignan and the army of the Ayyubid Sultan Saladin. The actual battle saw the destruction of the Crusader standing army and therefore their ability to take the war to the growing Moslem influence in the Levant. This defeat prompted the call for the third crusade which began two years after this battle.\n\nThe battle itself took place along the old Roman road that crossed Palestine towards the settlement pf Tiberias on the sea of Galilee. Also known as the Battle of the Horns of Hattin the topography was shaped by a waterless arid landscape dominated by the escarpments and hills of Hattin (an extinct volcano).\n\nThe Crusaders had amassed an army of almost 20,000 when word was received that the Kings wife had fallen captive to Saladin at the capture of the Crusader citadel at Tiberias. Urged by his commanders not to risk an ambush by Saladin in the wastes of the Desert the King decided otherwise and marched his army to rescue his wife. It soon became apparent that he should have listened to his advisors.\n\nThe army set off along the road and in the heat of the July sun the force soon depleted its water reserves and began to be harassed by the swarms of light Saracen horse. As darkness fell on the eve of the battle the army was some 6 miles from the settlement of Hattin with a known water source. Out there in the darkness lay Saladin's forces marching towards them from Tiberias. Weary and thirsty the Crusaders endured a night of living hell. As dawn arrived the encampment were confronted with the prospect of another day of marching, harassing fire and no water. Saladin had other ideas.\n\nTaking advantage of a dry hot westerly wind the Saracens set fire to the scrub, fanning the additional heat and smoke into the Christian forces. Saracen forces encircled the Crusaders.\n\nKing Guy realised his only hope was to get to the waters of Hattin quickly. Forming his troops into three large formations with the infantry shielding his precious knights and mounts they marched forward. As the day progressed more me succumbed to the heat and the arrows of the Moslem horde. The Crusaders endeavoured to push their way through Saladin's forces and some even managed to escape but for the vast majority it was over either dying from thirst or being hunted down by the lighter marauders. Saladin achieved a total victory.\n\nThe Game - Using Hail Caesar Rules\n\nIn our first game we determined that the objectives were simple - the Crusader army either had to break the Saracen force or reach the waters of Hattin with 50% of their forces. Should they fail to achieve this within the allotted time they would lose. The game would last three hours. All the Saracen had to do was to hold the Crusader force for this period or break the Crusader army.\n\nTo reflect the heat exhaustion and earlier skirmishes every Crusader unit will have suffered one casualty thereby giving the a starting stamina of 5 (as opposed to 6)\n\nThe Crusader forces are set up in three boxes with all troops in march column. The Saracens are spread across the table. The fires have been lit along the northern edge of the table and their smoke would obscure targets for shooting (-1 to hit).\n\nOrders of Battle\n\nCrusaders\n\nVanguard\n\nCavalry Commander - rating 8\n\n1 x unit Templar Knights\n\n1 x unit Crusader Knights\n\nInfantry Commander - rating 8\n\n4 x Heavy Infantry (mixed units of spears/xbows/bows)\n\nMiddle Force\n\nCavalry Commander - rating 8 (King Guy de Lusignan)\n\n2 x units Crusader Knights\n\nInfantry Commander - rating 8\n\n4 x Heavy Infantry (mixed units of spears/xbows/bows)\n\nRear Guard\n\nCavalry Commander - rating 8\n\n1 x unit Hospitaller Knights\n\n1 x unit Crusader Knights\n\nInfantry Commander - rating 8\n\n4 x Heavy Infantry (mixed units of spears/xbows/bows)\n\nSaracen Forces\n\nAt Waters of Hattin (Ahead and East of Crusaders)\n\nInfantry Commander - Saladin rating 9\n\n2 units of Medium Archers\n\n3 units of Medium Spears\n\nCavalry Commander - Rating 8\n\n1 x unit heavy Mamluks with Lances/Bows\n\n3 x units of Turcopoles (small units - stamina 4)\n\n1 x unit Bedouin Camels\n\nSouth Flank of Crusaders\n\nCavalry Command rating 8\n\n1 x unit heavy Mamluks with Lances/Bows\n\n4 x units of Turcopoles (small units - stamina 4)\n\nCavalry Command rating 8\n\n1 x unit heavy Mamluks with Lances/Bows\n\n4 x units of Turcopoles (small units - stamina 4)\n\nWest of Crusaders (Rear)\n\nInfantry Commander - Command rating 8\n\n2 x units of Medium Archers\n\n3 x units of Medium Spears\n\nNorth of Crusaders (fanning the fires)\n\nInfantry Commander - Command rating 8\n\n1 x units of Medium Archers\n\n1 x units of Medium Spears\n\n1 x unit of Fanatic Ghazis\n\nHow did Game 1 play?\n\nThe first game featured myself and Alastair as the Saracens. Glen and Vince would lead the Crusaders. The pictures relate to the game on the first evening.\n\nVince and Glen initiated proceedings with the column pushing outwards and trying to establish a barrier at the rear of the column. Suffice to say they achieved all their commands and by the end of the first turn they could begin to pour heavy crossbow fire into the Saracens awaiting in the wings.\n\nThe first few turns for the Saracens went badly with very few of the units moving. The crusaders gained an early advantage and quickly pushed back one division of Saracen light horse and routed a heavy unit of Mamluks.\n\nDon't forget that if you ant to take part in one of these games my Shed Experience is open for business - just hit the link button at the top of the page and drop me a line.\n\nUp next - another update on my Greek army"
