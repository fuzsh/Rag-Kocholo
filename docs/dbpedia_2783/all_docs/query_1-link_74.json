My main aim has been to promote clarity and so I have often adopted a name in simplified form or chosen to use a particularly distinctive part of it; similarly, if a nickname exists, I have sometimes selected it. Muslim names are properly a combination of a given name, a lineage, a parental honorific, an honorific or title, and an ascription (geographical or ethnic origin, profession or a distinctive attribute). Breaking down Saladin’s name is an interesting example of this:1 Al-Malik al-Nasir Salah al-Din Abu’l Muzaffar Yusuf ibn Ayyub al-Tikriti al-Kurdi. Thus: the king who supports/aids (an honorific); righteousness of the faith (another honorific); father of the victorious (parental honorific); Joseph (given name, in Quranic form of a biblical name); son of Job (lineage, in Quranic form of a biblical name); of Tikrit (ascription of birthplace); the Kurd (ascription of ethnicity). Our familiar ‘Saladin’ is a Latin corruption of ‘Salah al-Din’, just as his brother, known to us as ‘Saphadin’, is a blur of ‘Sayf al-Din’, meaning ‘Sword of the Faith’. I have also chosen to use the phrase ‘counter-crusade’. This can suggest an overly strict parity in the concepts of crusade and jihad. The definitions and discussions in the main text draw out important distinctions (as well as the similarities) between the two ideas. A more precise phrase in the context of Saladin’s labours would be ‘antiFrankish jihad’, although with the caveat above duly noted, the more readable ‘counter-crusade’ has been employed. As will also be apparent, Arabic diacritics are rarely used; with apologies to the purist, the issue of ease of reading overturned strict linguistic practice.\n\nxvi\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nAl-Adid – last of the Shi’ite Fatimid caliphs (d.1171). Al-Afdal – Saladin’s eldest son. Amalric – king of Jerusalem (r.1163–74). Ayyub – Saladin’s father (d.1173). Baldwin IV – leper-king of Jerusalem (r.1174–85).

Imad al-Din Zengi – a nephew of Nur al-Din who married one of his daughters, also lord of Sinjar and an important contributor to Saladin’s armies. Isa al-Hakkari – instrumental in getting Saladin chosen as vizier of Egypt, a famous jurist and a closely trusted advisor to the sultan (d.1189). Ismat al-Din Khatun – wife of Nur al-Din and then (from 1176) of Saladin; she died in 1186. Izz al-Din Mas’ud – lord of Mosul, a Zengid who resisted Saladin’s authority until 1186.

Nur al-Din Muhammad – Artuqid Turkish ruler of Hisn Kayfa and Diyar Bakr, ally of Saladin. Qadi al-Fadil – head of the Fatimid administration who joined Saladin’s chancery in 1171 and was one of his inner circle until the sultan’s death; a prolific writer.\n\ndr amatis personae and a note on names\n\nxvii\n\nQaraqush (‘Blackbird’) – former Fatimid official and Saladin’s master-builder of Cairo, as well as one the generals inside Acre when it surrendered. Al-Salih Ismail – Nur al-Din’s son and successor in Aleppo (d.1181). Sanjar Shah – lord of Jazirat Ibn Umar and a nephew of Imad al-Din Zengi, the lord of Sinjar. Saphadin (al-Adil) – Saladin’s brother and the holder of many important political and advisory roles. Later ruler of Syria and Egypt (d.1218). Shawar – vizier of Egypt, responsible for inviting in both the Franks and the Syrians to his country as he sought to hold on to power (d.1169). Shirkuh – Saladin’s uncle, briefly vizier of Egypt and a key general to Nur al-Din (d.1169). Taqi al-Din – Saladin’s nephew, son of an elder brother of the sultan and one of his most important generals (d.1191). Turanshah – one of Saladin’s older brothers (d.1180). Al-Zahir Ghazi– Saladin’s third and seemingly favourite son. Zengi – father of Nur al-Din, founder of the Zengid dynasty; a brutal warrior who conquered Frankish Edessa in 1144 (d.1146).\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPreface\n\nIn the post-9/11 climate we are increasingly familiar with al-Qaeda and ISIS using the word ‘crusade’ as a powerful and inflammatory shorthand for Western aggression against the Islamic world. As this book shows, this is by no means a new practice. There has been increasing use of crusading imagery by the far right in North America and Europe and now also in connection with the regime of President Bolsonaro of Brazil. Within the broad historical legacy of relations between the people of the Near East and the West—one that in reality is far more complex than these binaries allow—the Sultan Saladin occupies a distinct position: a holy warrior dedicated to the recovery of Jerusalem for Islam, yet a figure to be respected in the West as well. Because of his capture of Jerusalem in 1187, Saladin is a hero to the people of Sunni Islam. This is logical enough, but for him to have acquired an attractive profile in the West is much less understandable. As the man who took Christendom’s holiest city he was, initially at least, an object of virulent fear and hatred, an evil harbinger of the apocalypse. Based on his personal qualities of piety, mercy, generosity and justice, the startling transformation from antipathy to admiration began within a few years of the fall of Jerusalem and is a subject explored within this book. By the time of European settlement and the colonial era in North America, his image was set in generally positive terms; ideas and attitudes already formed within Europe had moved across the Atlantic. The crusading movement had largely declined by this point and the great Enlightenment thinker Voltaire was scathing in his assessment of it, regarding the crusades as a form of madness and the crusaders themselves as cruel and immoral. But his perception of Saladin, informed by the transformation noted above, meant that the sultan was ‘a good man, a hero and a philosopher’. French settlers in\n\nxx\n\nThe L ife an d L eg end Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nNorth America could access Voltaire’s writings easily enough, and in 1750 an English translation of his History of the Crusades appeared in the widely circulated Gentleman’s Magazine. A plethora of other references in both historical works and popular literature reinforced the sultan’s reputation in all sorts of contemporary literature. For obvious reasons of geography and history, the relationship between America and the Near East has been different to that of Europe and the Near East, not least because the latter pair saw almost two centuries of direct engagement through the crusader conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 and the subsequent establishment of the crusader states. From the nineteenth century onwards, as the major European powers launched their imperialist ambitions in the Mediterranean, a nascent United States developed significant trading interests in the area, generating contact with Islam and the Near East that stretched across religion, warfare (the Barbary Wars being an early example), culture and co-existence. Within this spectrum, the history of the crusades and the memory of Saladin himself are part of the broader environment. They are, of course, inextricably linked. The first direct connection between North America and the crusades is, it must be admitted, marginal. In 1278 the archbishop of Trondheim sought collection of church taxes from Greenland and the neighbouring islands in support of the crusades; payment for the holy war appeared in the form of walrus tusks and sealskins. By the eighteenth century, formal crusades (campaigns called by the pope against enemies of the Church with participants receiving spiritual rewards) had almost entirely disappeared. But over the centuries the idea had become deeply ingrained, and Christian societies anywhere could look to invoke the language and associations of zeal and positive purpose. The circumstances of the American War of Independence prompted William Bradford to write to James Madison on 10 July 1775 that ‘an enthusiasm almost equal to that which prevailed in Europe for the crusades’ had infused volunteers joining to fight the British. In other words, conflicts fought for what a protagonist saw as a right cause could wrap themselves in the aura of moral virtue, determination and idealism which formed one understanding of the medieval wars. So attractive was this broad notion that from the mid-eighteenth century, the word ‘crusade’ could be invoked in a purely metaphorical sense, as it is so frequently employed in the English language today. Thomas\n\npre face\n\nxxi\n\nJefferson provided an early example of this in 1786 when he called for ‘a crusade against ignorance, to establish and improve the law for educating the common people’. It is also possible to catch sight of the sultan in the political and cultural discourse in North America, and it is intriguing to see by whom and in what circumstances he was invoked. In January 1764, Benjamin Franklin wrote a passionate condemnation of the massacre of a Native American group by a party of frontiersmen. Within his carefully constructed text he held out the example of Saladin as a man whose behaviour towards captured opponents was superior to that exhibited by the Christians whom Franklin so decried. Eighteenth-century Philadelphia is a very long way from Saladin’s struggle to recover Jerusalem from the crusaders, but in referencing him Franklin gives us a glimpse of the durability and the reach of the sultan’s reputation. A romanticised view of Saladin and the crusades (and the medieval period in general) was given a huge boost in nineteenth-century America by the writings of Sir Walter Scott. His novels of the medieval age such as Ivanhoe (1819) and the crusade-focused The Talisman (1825) were enormously successful in America; think of the omnipresence of J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter books and you have some sense of comparison. Rival editions of a new book would appear simultaneously and multiple reprints would follow. This was ‘an unprecedented demand for fiction’, and in 1872 a statue was erected in Central Park to mark the centenary of Scott’s birth. The chivalric world so brilliantly created by Scott, in which Saladin featured as a man of sophistication and integrity, certainly sunk deep into American culture. Mark Twain published his Innocents Abroad, or The New Pilgrims’ Progress, an account of his journey to the Mediterranean and the Holy Land, in 1869. The author wrote of the crusaders as chivalric warriors of the days of old, and after visiting the Holy Sepulchre Twain drew parallels between medieval times and the more recent Crimean War (1853–6). He also visited the site of the sultan’s great victory in the Battle of Hattin. Yet, in spite of Twain’s fierce hostility and disdain towards the Arabs and Turks, the ‘princely courtesy’ of the ‘peerless Saladin’ survived his scathing pen. Alongside this, American use of ‘crusade’ as a metaphor for a struggle grew ever more familiar. The sense of virtue and right was brought to bear on such emotionally charged issues as slavery, alcohol and the Civil War. By the time of World War I, given the popularity of the\n\nxxii\n\nThe L ife an d L eg end Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nword in Europe coupled with its familiarity in the US, it was no surprise to see ‘Pershing’s Crusaders’ as the headline for US troops joining the fray in Europe. The official government film poster shows Pershing and his men shadowed by a series of ghostly crusader knights. As a contemporary commentator noted, the troops were embarked upon ‘a just cause to rescue Europe from the brutality of German militarism’. Mural paintings in the Widener Library at Harvard University emphasised the same theme: Happy those who with a glowing faith In one embrace clasped death and victory. They crossed the sea crusaders keen to help The nations battling in a righteous cause.\n\nAfter World War II, General Eisenhower drew upon the same imagery in the title of his memoirs: Crusade in Europe. The word ‘crusade’ had become part of the lexicon of conflict; Henry Kissinger warned against ‘ineffectual posturing or adventuristic crusades’ in discussions of Cold War diplomacy. In other areas of contemporary foreign policy the issue of the crusades was rather sharper. Kissinger’s multiple visits to Damascus in the early 1970s included listening to President Hafiz al-Asad commenting on a large painting of Saladin’s victory over the crusaders at the Battle of Hattin. Saladin was also visible across widely divergent aspects of American cultural life. To give a couple of examples: From the late nineteenth century, immigrants from the declining Ottoman Empire started forming communities in the US, and they brought their memories of the sultan with them. Ameen Rihani was a young Lebanese author whose Book of Khalid is regarded as the first Arab-American novel, and, as we will see later, he looked to the medieval sultan as an inspirational figure. Around the same time, in 1886, the positive associations of Saladin’s reputation can be seen, for example, in the naming of the Grand Rapids branch of the charitable Masonic organisation, the Shriners, as the ‘Saladin Shriners’. Much more recently, in 2008, the Salah al-Din Temple was founded in Maryland, once more referencing his nobility of character as a guiding principle. In broader popular culture, cinema brought Saladin to a far bigger audience. Cecil B. DeMille’s 1935 epic, The Crusades, blended\n\npre face\n\nxxiii\n\na post–World War I wish to avoid conflict with a strong dose of Sir Walter Scott and major cultural stereotyping of the people of the Near East. The portrayal of Saladin treads a curious line. It is initially negative, signalled by his wearing a helmet bearing devil’s horns, but he becomes the courteous and diplomatically polished figure of his usual reputation. Richard the Lionheart’s wife, Berengaria, was obviously enamoured of the exotic sultan (‘They told me he had horns like the devil. I think he’s magnificent!’), and when she is wounded by an arrow Saladin rescues and heals her, and then releases her back to Richard. DeMille wrote that his aim was ‘to bring out Saracens that were not barbarians, but a highly cultivated people, and their great leader Saladin as perfect and gentle a knight as any in Christendom’. In 1955 the book The Talisman was openly pressed into service to make the film King Richard and the Crusaders. Imbued with the generous imagination of the book, coupled with the glamour of the silver screen, here Saladin is an exotic figure drawn to Lady Edith, who hopes that love can cross the boundaries of religious war and that she can persuade the sultan of the virtues of Christianity. Saladin (played by Rex Harrison) is said to know the geography of a female like the palm of his hand, and so obvious is his allure to Edith that her Western admirer explodes in fury at ‘that silky son of Satan!’ The sultan is, inevitably, courteous enough to stand to one side and let his jealous rival escort Edith away. He is also, however, brave, wise and noble, characteristics that can survive the Orientalist caricature and keep his reputation bright. While we frequently use the word ‘crusade’ in its secularised sense as a good cause, or else associate it with events from the distant medieval past, there is a manifest need to understand how its meaning has remained potent in the Near East and to be aware that in this context it is a much more loaded term. Woven in with this, Saladin has long held a prominent position in the Arab and Muslim worlds as the man who drew together the region and defeated Westerners. His status as an attractive character to emulate and to rally around adds considerable lustre to this. The way in which he achieved these extraordinary feats lies at the heart of this book, but as we will see, he was far from perfect, attracting hostility from some contemporaries for his dynastic empire building and his periodic conflicts with other Sunnis. In the way that past heroes of a Western society can be attacked\n\nxxiv\n\nThe L ife an d L eg end Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nfor what we now consider unattractive attitudes or political failings, some in the modern world can criticise Saladin—notably, the Shi’ites, because he ended their caliphate in Cairo 1171. This important point aside, for the Sunnis, Saladin stands as symbol of success, as a figure both aspirational and inspiring. His centuries-long status as a hero and the fact that he became so admired by his Western enemies, opponents across linguistic and cultural boundaries, also stand out. All these interlaced features run deep. He stands as a cultural ‘given’, not simply to be used by dictators and in situations of conflict, but to stand as a positive reference point in everyday life.\n\nIntroduction Damascus 2009\n\nEarly morning, October 2009. I am strolling alongside the bustling, horn-honking traffic of downtown Damascus when a poster catches my eye. A bearded face looks out calmly from under a decorated conical helmet: Saladin. The text, in both Arabic and English, names a dance company and states a place and a time: the Damascus Opera House, a twelve-night run starting, by coincidence, the following evening. I carry on walking, moving into the quieter residential areas. A modern dance production about Saladin. I’m not convinced that’s quite my cup of tea. But the further I walk, the more the idea appeals. Look, I reason to myself, how often are you going to be in Damascus with this sort of event taking place? What’s to lose? It’s only one evening. I’m attending an academic conference and in the course of the day I find a friend and colleague intrepid enough to come along. We get tickets for the opening night. It is dark by the mid-evening start time. There is an energising buzz as the audience funnels into the modern concrete Opera House; local television crews interview the director, and then men whom I take to be government ministers arrive too. Before the show begins there are speeches that include a couple of denunciations of Israel, greeted with warm approval from the audience. Then the dance commences, a vigorous, contemporary production with segments of film, blended with drama and singing. It depicts Saladin’s resolve to recover Jerusalem from western crusaders, who had captured it in 1099, and his uniting of the Arab people to take on the crusaders’ untrustworthy (and in one case, drunk) leaders. Next, a great whirling of swords and banners portrays the Battle of Hattin, Saladin’s historic victory over the\n\n2\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nChristian armies in July 1187. The magnanimous sultan regains Jerusalem for Islam and the Arab people and, at the moment of triumph, he spares its population from a massacre of the sort inflicted by the First Crusaders eighty-eight years earlier. The show ends with a celebratory dance, by which time the audience is enthusiastically cheering and clapping along as they enjoy their hero’s success.1 It was a revelatory evening. I’m not sure it kindled a lifelong love of the genre, but it set me thinking about why the event had been staged, not least in the most prominent location in the city, the House of Asad Opera House. Today Saladin is familiar to all Damascenes through schoolbooks and television drama series. There is a fine equestrian statue of him outside the citadel, and his tomb complex lies adjacent to the city’s Great Mosque. Yet what this modern representation of the story seemed to demonstrate was that his relevance is not merely historical but urgently contemporary. The symbolism of Saladin’s achievement in recovering Jerusalem from an occupying army was manifest from the very start of the evening, and the show celebrated a well-known episode to reach a conclusion the government of the day aspires to. Watching this musical set me off on a journey that led, ultimately, to this book. Even while it describes the life and deeds of a twelfthcentury warrior leader, a Kurdish outsider who came to rule Egypt, the wealthiest land in the Near East; who usurped the Syrian lands of his overlord; who managed to draw together a fragile coalition to defeat the crusader states and recover Jerusalem for the people of Islam – and then to resist the might of King Richard the Lionheart – this is a book that was inspired not by the past but by the present. As I was to discover in the years following my visit to Damascus, Syria is far from the only place where the legacy of Saladin is alive and well. In fact, over the last few years the sultan has emerged in a number of wildly different guises – in both the Middle East and the West – almost all of them, glowingly positive. A couple of years after the Damascus dance production, the Baalbek Arts Festival in Lebanon hosted a musical called From the Days of Saladin. A local newspaper summarised: ‘In this portrayal of the conflict between West and East, the former stands opposed to justice, fairness, courage, wisdom and kindness. Saladin is, on the other hand, perfect.’2 In Oslo, the House\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\nof Literature hosts the annual ‘Saladin Days’ event, a gathering inspired by the sultan’s merciful behaviour towards the defenders of Jerusalem and designed to promote religious tolerance.3 More recently, in 2014, the Globe Theatre in London saw Holy Warriors: A Fantasia on the Third Crusade and the History of Violent Struggle in the Holy Lands by David Eldridge. An elegant and charismatic Saladin (played by Alexander Siddig) reached out across the centuries as a symbol of hope and compromise, denied by an inflexible Richard the Lionheart ( John Hopkins): ‘What a tragedy it is for our people when you or I cannot imagine a different future even as we weigh the triumphs and failures of our times’, lamented the sultan.4 Comfortably the most high-profile exposure for Saladin was in Ridley Scott’s movie Kingdom of Heaven (2005), an international blockbuster shown across the western world and presented to great acclaim in the Near East too.5 In the wake of 9/11, this was a determined effort to tone down the religious rhetoric in its depiction of the crusades and to massage them into a chivalric enterprise. Saladin was played with great poise by the Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud, who described the sultan as a Muslim hero ‘who returned to Arabs and Muslims their pride and dignity, an example for our people, our leaders, our society’.6 A few years later, Saladin became the subject of a multi-part animated cartoon series for Malaysian children, commissioned by the then prime minister himself, and later translated into English. Here Saladin was an exemplar for young people; as the advertising material stated: ‘Saladin: the ultimate hero – courageous in the face of danger, never willing to admit defeat and funny when he needs to be. In a world of danger, there’s only one man you’ll want in your corner . . .’ In fact, both in the Near East and the West, Saladin has been the subject of a number of television programmes. During the holy month of Ramadan families gather to watch serials. In 2001, rival productions in Syria and Egypt aired at this time, dramatising Saladin’s deeds. More straightforward documentaries were also produced in Syria and elsewhere in the Near East.7 Most recently, Al Jazeera Egypt broadcast a major four-part series on the crusades. In the West, there have been Richard and Saladin: Holy Warriors (BBC, 2005), The Cross and the Crescent (History Channel, 2009) and The Crusades (BBC, 2011), as well as a BBC Radio profile of the sultan in a series on The Islamic Golden Age.\n\n4\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nSaladin has provided material and inspiration for contemporary musicians too. Soon after President Obama won the US presidential election in 2008 he announced plans to visit the Middle East. The wave of admiration for the new American president prompted concerns in some quarters that this energetic leader might too easily be seen as the saviour for all Arab issues. Shaaban Abdel Rahim, a highly polemical rap artist, came out with a warning: Bush, may his years be ruined, has caused us losses for days and years And Obama, people are imagining him to be Saladin What will Obama do for the catastrophes of Bush and his father?8\n\nSaladin is also the subject for nasheed, a form of instrument-free vocal music that is popular online in the Islamic world. Some songs have footage from Kingdom of Heaven to accompany their message: ‘O Salah al-deen, you are a hope we’ll wait for forever.’9 In the second part of the book I will explore more fully what that cultural legacy means and where it has come from. But as we shall also see, it is in the political arena that Saladin appears most frequently. In 2011, when President Recep Tayyip Erdog˘an of Turkey was pushing for Palestinian membership of the United Nations, he was hailed on his arrival in Cairo with the words: ‘Welcome, Erdog˘an, Saladin’, and was described as ‘Erdog˘an, who angers Israel, will liberate Palestine like Saladin.’10 Back home Erdog˘an developed the theme further. In 2015, along with Prime Minister Davutog˘lu, he opened a new airport in eastern Turkey named after Saladin. The opening ceremony was an opportunity to make some particular points: ‘We are naming this airport Selaheddine Ayyubi,’ he said, ‘to send a message of solidarity and brotherhood and to say that Jerusalem belongs to Kurds, Turks, Arabs and Muslims forever.’11 Saladin was of Kurdish origin, and partly Erdog˘ an’s speech was for domestic consumption, an attempt to win the support of Turkey’s Kurdish population for an upcoming election. In Irbil, meanwhile, capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, there is the well-established Salahaddin University. In this region, an image of the sultan takes precedence on their coinage. Clearly it remains a source of immense pride to Kurds that he achieved what hitherto Turks and Arabs had been unable to do, namely, to defeat the crusaders. But a few express\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nfrustration. A Swedish-based exile from Syria said: ‘I feel proud about him, but I also get mad at him because he did nothing for Kurdistan or the Kurds.’ But in the twelfth century Saladin was not fighting on behalf of his own ethnic group, but in the name of Islam (and for the advantage of his own family, the Ayyubids). At the same time Saladin’s appeal ran across ethnic lines to include Turks and Arabs in his army and it continues to do so today.12 The Free Syrian Army features the ‘Descendants of Saladin Brigade’, while ISIS frequently casts its conflict with the West as a struggle against ‘crusaders’.13 In Egypt in March 2015, the Egyptian military cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood with an order that banned Saladin from school textbooks on the grounds that he could be used by extremists to incite violence.14 Saladin has taken a prominent role in school textbooks across the Near East and North Africa since the 1920s, with his moral and military success heavily contrasted with the imperialistic greed of the westerners. This ban was a stark, if backhanded, compliment to his ability to act as a powerful rallying call even in the context of a political-religious struggle within a Sunni Muslim country. Cumulatively, across politics, theatre, music and television, Saladin today has a formidable profile. How has this happened? And despite the fact that the crusaders are viewed completely differently in the Near East and the West, it is notable that Saladin is largely conveyed in a positive light in both places. Why is this?15 In the West runs a deep sense that the history of the crusades is something very distant and long gone. Paradoxically, however, the man who defeated the westerners to recover Jerusalem is, and has been for over 800 years now, a figure often hugely admired. The Royal Navy named a vessel HMS Saladin in the First World War, and between 1959 and 1994 the British Army had an armoured car named the Saladin – hardly signs of hostility to the sultan’s memory. The crusaders remain knights of old, the brave and impetuous King Richard clanks around in his heavy, uncomfortable chainmail, leading his troops into battle. Centuries of using crusading as a metaphor for a good cause have compounded this to blunt the edge of the sword and Saladin’s relatively benign persona massages this further into the distance. But this romanticised and chronologically remote view is the disjuncture, the point where the understanding of much of the West does not mesh with, for\n\n6\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nexample, the ongoing struggle for a Palestinian state and control over Jerusalem. More broadly, in the eyes of the Muslim and Arab Near East, the crusaders were motivated by greed and/or religious fervour, invading and conquering their lands, killing their people. And the man who defeated them was Saladin. Watching the dance musical in Damascus set me seeking the various ways in which Saladin’s image and achievements have been adopted and recast in the modern age, but it also prompted me to ask how he has come to have such a predominantly heroic character. As one reviewer of the 1963 Egyptian film El-Naser Salah al-Din wrote, the problem with the movie is that Saladin starts as a good man, becomes a great man and ends up as a legend; within such a framework there is little chance of character development. Yet as one explores Saladin’s life and career it is apparent that in reality, he was as capable of mistakes, of self-interest and cruelty as anyone else in such a position. Saladin has become a man famous for his faith, generosity, mercy and justice – personal qualities that drew people to him and did much to explain his success. To some of his contemporaries, though, he was a usurper and simply out to build a dynastic power base. And in attaining such heights, he was also, it must be said, the beneficiary of considerable good fortune. What I hope to convey in the pages that follow is some sense of the man within these various images, whose story repeatedly takes us beyond the crude stereotypes of the ‘Clash of Civilisations’, of Christianity against Islam, even while its legacy returns us to it. As Saladin gathered an empire that stretched from North Africa through the Holy Land and Syria, and over to the River Tigris in modern Iraq, his life involved people from a bewildering variety of religious, ethnic and political backgrounds. His is a story rich with bloody conflict but not always across the neat divisions of faith which were only inconsistently observed at the time: we will see Christians fighting Christians and Muslims fighting Muslims. We have Christians and Muslims fighting different Christians and Muslims. They might well make a truce, switch sides, and carry on their conflict, or even exist together for a period. Then as now, the reality of the situation on the ground was always far more complicated than it appears from a distance, a cocktail of ethnic, political, economic and personal factors, not just religious beliefs.\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\nThe Near East in the twelfth century saw these various factors combined in a particularly unstable blend. Today, Saladin is often presented for political reasons as a man who united his peoples under a common cause, but the turbulent conditions of the time promoted only a limited sense of unity or shared purpose. Arguably Saladin’s most extraordinary achievement was to conjure up just such a coalition, to hold in check the bubbling range of interests and priorities of those whom he had gathered, and then to steer it to victory at Jerusalem in 1187. But in conquering a place of such unique religious significance to such a huge array of people, that variety of motives, not all of which were religious, easily slipped out of sight. This book begins by tracing Saladin’s emergence into the rich religious and cultural environment of the Near East. It places his rise in the context of dynastic ambition, holy war and family politics, and describes how Saladin accomplished his great and defining victory at Jerusalem. It narrates his epic confrontation with the armies of Richard the Lionheart and the Third Crusade, but it also goes further. After his death it explains how he has come to be a figure of such renown and respect in the West and of such major significance in the Muslim Near East. We will trace his story through contemporary histories, poems and letters, and later through newspapers, plays, films and novels. Following their telling and retelling leads us down the centuries, back to the Damascus Opera House and beyond to the present day.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\npart i The Life of Saladin\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1 The Muslim Near East and the First Crusade ‘How many a mosque have they made into a church!’\n\nIn March 1132 a group of horsemen hurtled up to the gates of Takrit, a town perched on the banks of the River Tigris. At their head was Zengi, a dynamic and brutal Turkish warlord set upon carving out a power base in northern Syria and Iraq. Zengi’s ambition and desire for independence frequently brought him into conflict with his nominal superiors; loyalty and consistency of allegiance were not his modus operandi, a pattern of behaviour replicated by many of his contemporaries and successors. Yet sometimes even Zengi could be defeated, and in this instance, he was on the run. In these desperate circumstances he had a stroke of good fortune: the governor of Takrit let him into the town and then gave him the boats and provisions to escape over the river.1 The governor was Najm al-Din Ayyub, later to become Saladin’s father. From this impromptu starting point began a relationship that set the Ayyubid family on a path that took them from minor local administrators to the dominant dynastic power of the eastern Mediterranean and, in the person of Saladin himself, a figurehead whose name became known from western Europe to the borders of Asia. Flux and division characterised the medieval Near East, a region running from Egypt through the Holy Land and Syria, up to Asia Minor, over to the Jazira (meaning ‘island’, the area between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers), and across to Persia. A population of extraordinary ethnic and religious variety lived largely under\n\n12\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nMuslim rule, although the confessional split within Islam formed just one of the many fault lines in this complex environment. Back in the seventh century a dispute arose as to who should lead the people of Islam following the death of the Prophet Muhammad in 632 (‘caliph’ means the ‘successor’ to Muhammad and is the spiritual and legal head of the Sunni believers). This generated the break that crystallised in the Sunni–Shi’ite divide that has been a cause of so much bitterness and tension down the ages.2 By the eleventh century the split was apparent in political form through the Sunni Abbasid regime based in Baghdad and the Shi’ite Fatimid dynasty in Cairo. It would be a mistake, however, to regard everyone living under either of these powers to be followers of the same denomination, or even the same faith. The natural movement of people caused by politics, trade and the environment, coupled with the extensive pre-Islamic heritage of, for example, Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians and pagans (some polytheists, some monotheists), added a plethora of further ingredients to the mix. Other particularly important fissures were the multiple forms of Eastern Christianity, such as the Greek Orthodox, the Armenians, the Maronites and the Jacobites, or in the case of Islam, divisions amongst the Shi’ites. Back in the eighth century, a dispute saw the emergence of the Isma’ilis, a group who supported the claim of the son of the sixth Imam* to succeed his father. This party came to prominence in North Africa and emerged as a political force in the shape of the Fatimid dynasty who established Cairo as their capital from 969. At the end of the eleventh century, a further splinter group, the Nizaris, known more famously as the Assassins, also come into being, as we will see later.3 Urban environments, such as the great cities of Cairo, Alexandria, Aleppo and Damascus, encouraged an especially polyglot population. Religious rivalry could generate conflict, but by reason of habit, economic expediency and indifference, people often just rubbed along. Moments of tension could be for any number of reasons beyond faith alone, such as ethnic differences or short-term political aims; immense *For Shi’ites, the term ‘Imam’ refers to a descendant of the Prophet chosen by God to lead them. For Sunnis, the term is sometimes interchangeable with ‘caliph’ or with prayer leader, or is used to honour a scholar. In this book, the term is capitalised when used in its Shi’ite meaning.\n\nthe muslim near east and the first crusade\n\n13\n\nlinguistic diversity, amplified in trading cities by the presence of merchants, added yet another layer of complexity. In the case of the Sunni caliph of Baghdad, religious authority did not translate seamlessly to political power. In the course of the early eleventh century (1020s to 1050s) periods of extreme cold, coupled with a relentless will to conquer, saw the nomadic Seljuk Turks leave their homelands on the central Eurasian steppe and move westwards. These tough warriors, recent converts to Islam, quickly imposed their power over the Iranian world, including the caliph and, with their families and livestock, came to settle across the region. By the 1090s the Seljuk Empire stretched from the Holy Land over to Kashpur in what is now China. For a couple of decades, it was reasonably cohesive, but in the early 1090s, a catastrophic spate of deaths – both by murder and through natural means – shattered the existing hierarchies and the Sunni lands of the Near East broke into a series of regional political entities, based in the big urban centres of Aleppo, Damascus and Mosul. Smaller city states, such as Hama, Tripoli or Harran, also emerged, each looking to assert their own independence and to advance their position at the expense of neighbours. Familial ethnic groups, such as the Turkish Artuqids or the Zengids, the Kurdish Hakkaris, or the Bedouin (tribes of nomadic Arab pastoralists), were amongst the fluctuating candidates to rule a city or district, or be brought into a larger polity.4 The ongoing churn of this rich blend of peoples and faiths was precisely the situation in which ambitious newcomers could thrive. The Ayyubids were ethnic Kurds, a clan based around the small city of Dvin in the broad Araxes valley in western Azerbaijan (now modern Armenia). Their skill as mounted warriors meant that they were in demand to join the forces of the various Seljuk Turkish warlords in the area. The relationship between the Turks and the Kurds was one of pragmatism peppered with occasional bouts of tension and bigotry; much of the time, however, it suited them to work together, hence Ayyub’s position as governor of Takrit.5 A few years after his escape across the Tigris, Zengi was able to return the favour to the Ayyubids. While he was clearly a ruthless warrior, another fundamental facet of leadership was the ability to dispense patronage. In 1137–8 the Kurdish clan hit trouble in Takrit. Ayyub’s brother, Shirkuh, took offence at the insulting remarks made\n\n14\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nby the local army commander to a young woman. A confrontation ensued and Shirkuh killed the man. The family’s good standing insulated them from physical punishment by the authorities, but Ayyub was stripped of the governorship and the group was forced into exile; now was the moment for Zengi to repay that help. The family sought refuge with him in Mosul where he awarded them lands.6 Amidst all this upheaval, and just before the clan left Takrit, Salah al-Din ibn Ayyub was born. While westerners know and refer to him as Saladin, these parts of his name have an honorific meaning, ‘Righteousness of the Faith, son of Ayyub’, a form of title widely used at the time. His birth name was Yusuf ( Joseph), a choice resonant with ties to the Quran. The story of Yusuf occupies Sura 12 of the holy book and narrates his life and role as a Prophet, the son of Jacob. At one point this pious, calm and forgiving character provides advice that preserves Egypt from disaster, in this case famine. The notion that an individual called Yusuf saves Egypt means this came to prove a prescient choice by Saladin’s family, and in the course of his career the name Yusuf was frequently employed in letters and poems about him, often to highlight the parallels with his Quranic namesake and to enhance his image.7 Although Zengi continued to fight his fellow Muslims, his territorial ambitions inevitably brought him into conflict with the other major players in the Levant – the Franks (Ifranj or Firanj in Arabic), the term adopted for the Christian settlers who had set up a series of independent states in the aftermath of the conquest of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099. In doing so these westerners, themselves a heady blend of southern Italians, Provençals and northern Europeans, added more layers to the cultural and linguistic complexity of the Near East.8 Zengi’s wars against the Franks brought a further dimension to the fore, that of jihad, the concept commonly equated with holy war. The idea of the crusade, an armed pilgrimage to liberate Jerusalem from the Muslims, was invented by the papacy in the late eleventh century. In contrast, the notion of jihad was a basic element of the Islamic faith, enshrined in the Quran and hadith (the sayings of the Prophet), that dated back to the age of the Prophet in the seventh century. Jihad, which literally means ‘striving’, exists in two forms: the ‘greater jihad’, which is the spiritual struggle of every Muslim to live according to the teachings of Allah, and the ‘lesser jihad’ which\n\nthe muslim near east and the first crusade\n\n15\n\nby the ninth century had evolved to be both a communal and an individual obligation ‘to engage in defensive and then offensive warfare for the benefit of the community’.9 By the later decades of the twelfth century, the call to jihad and the duty of able-bodied Muslims to engage in holy war constituted a fundamental part of Saladin’s success, but when the armies of the First Crusade reached the Near East in the late 1090s it was barely in evidence. The crusade had emerged in western Europe through an alliance of the motives and interests of the religious and noble classes. The pope called for the liberation of Christ’s tomb, the Holy Sepulchre, and offered participants remission of all confessed sins. The nobility (the warriors, in other words), responded vigorously to that message, capturing Jerusalem in 1099. In the highly fragmented Near East no such partnership between the religious classes and the fighting classes existed. Furthermore, the disastrous series of deaths across the Muslim world (including Fatimid Egypt) in the early 1090s eliminated a layer of senior leadership that could well have stopped the crusade in its tracks. In 1105, a Damascene religious scholar called al-Sulami preached the jihad in a small village on the edge of the city. He lambasted the nobles of the day for their failure to defend their subjects against the crusaders. He also emphasised the duty of free, adult, healthy men to participate and insisted on the need for spiritually correct intention; that is, the precedence of the greater jihad over the lesser, citing the important contemporary theologian, al-Ghazali, in support of this idea.10 Threats, both material and spiritual, followed, as well as an outline of heavenly and earthly rewards, especially plunder. At the time of the First Crusade the majority of the Muslims in Syria had not recognised the campaign as, in part, a conquest of religious colonisation, although al-Sulami pointed out that recent Christian advances in Spain and Sicily perhaps (erroneously) suggested a more systematic programme of conquest. In 1105 al-Sulami’s audience was tiny, only a handful of other scholars, an indication that his message was falling on stony ground, but the text survived and the core tenets of his appeal would, decades later, ring out loudly across the Muslim Near East.11 Not even in Baghdad, the seat of Sunni Islam, was there much interest in, or understanding of, the events on the western edge of the caliph’s lands. Far closer to home the serial convulsions within the Seljuk world fully absorbed the attention of Baghdad.\n\n16\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nWe catch intermittent references to crusade and jihad in the early decades of the twelfth century. A few poets castigated their leaders and angrily lamented events in Syria and the Holy Land: The sword is cutting and blood is spilt. How many Muslim men have become booty? And how many Muslim women’s inviolability has been plundered? How many a mosque have they made into a church! The cross has been set up in the mihrab [the niche inside a mosque indicating the direction of Mecca]. The blood of the pig is suitable for it. Qurans have been burned under the guise of incense.12\n\nIn a more aggressive tone, a Seljuk poet in Baghdad called for a war ‘to make polo-balls of the Franks’ heads and polo sticks from their hands and feet’.13 In 1111 a band of religious scholars and merchants from Aleppo travelled to Baghdad and burst into Friday prayers in the Seljuk sultan’s mosque and in the caliphal mosque. These acts of calculated disrespect were a sign of their fury at the inadequacy of any response to the Frankish conquests. Muslim rulers in Syria had, of course, fought the settlers, but very much in the framework of their own individual political needs. One indication of some stirrings of holy-war mentality was prior to the Battle of the Field of Blood in northern Syria in 1119. There a Shi’ite judge from Aleppo preached to the troops and urged them to victory. A few years later, Balak of Aleppo died fighting the Franks and inscriptions on his tomb describe him as a martyr who fought the holy war, ‘leader of the army of the Muslims, vanquisher of the infidel and the polytheists’.14 A stronger trail emerges in the final years of Zengi’s career in the early 1140s. Inscriptions on a Damascus madrasa (a college of theology and law that trained religious scholars and state officials) describe him as ‘the fighter of jihad, the defender of the frontier, the tamer of the polytheists and the destroyer of the heretics’.15 In other words, notwithstanding the fact that he spent the bulk of his time in conflict with other Muslims, the religious classes of Syria eventually seem to have found in him a figure who periodically could take on the mantle of a holy warrior in wars against the Christians. In 1137 he hammered a\n\nthe muslim near east and the first crusade\n\n17\n\nFrankish army at the Battle of Montferrand and took towns and castles from the Frankish principality of Antioch; the following year he fended off a major invasion from the Byzantine emperor, John Komnenos.16 It was in 1144, however, that he struck the most substantial blow to date in the counter crusade. The city of Edessa was captured by the First Crusaders in 1098. A later northern Syrian writer described it as a place that ‘inflicted great harm on the Muslims around it . . . Edessa was like the eye of the territories of the Jazira’, lying on a large plain, about sixty-five miles east of the River Euphrates.17 It had an important position in the history of Christianity as the first city to convert to Christianity under King Abgar, and as the burial place of the apostles Thomas and Thaddeus. Even after the crusader conquest, the bulk of its population remained Armenian, although there was some degree of intermarriage with the western newcomers.18 Zengi’s activities against Muslim rivals up towards the River Tigris encouraged Count Joscelin II, the ruler of Edessa, to leave his city and travel many miles west. The Turk’s formidable network of intelligence operatives informed him of this and Zengi ‘moved forward fast, like an arrow leaving its bow or like a flood running its course’, calling upon the ‘tribes of the Turkmen to assist him and to carry out the obligation of the Holy War’.19 A powerful army besieged the citadel of Edessa and specialist mining engineers from Khurasan (northeastern Persia, today’s eastern Iran and Uzbekistan) created an elaborate system of mines. On 23 December 1144, a section of the wall collapsed. The defenders fought hard to plug the gap but the following day, the attackers swarmed in. The terrified population fled to the citadel and in the panic the aged archbishop was trampled to death at the gate. A few days later the citadel itself surrendered; the men were killed or tortured and the women and children enslaved. Churches were destroyed, as was the silver coffin that held the bones of Thaddeus and King Abgar.20 ‘[Zengi] afflicted everyone inside with evil. He captured the city and damned it. He crushed its semen, inverted its crosses, exterminated its monks and priests, killed its knights and heroes.’21 The taking of a major Frankish city, indeed the capital of one of their four states, was a breakthrough moment for the Muslim Near East and a feat recognised by the caliph of Baghdad with the award\n\n18\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nof a series of honorific titles to the successful warlord: ‘the adornment of Islam, the victorious prince, the helper of the believers’.22 The victory of Edessa had outshone all other victories By the deeds of Zengi, Islam is reawakened If justice be done, he should be called caliph Tomorrow he will invade Jerusalem.23\n\nThe poet’s predictions regarding Jerusalem proved wide of the mark, but his sense of triumph reflects the feelings that Zengi’s success had aroused. The man himself may have had a more pragmatic next step in mind, however. In the latter half of 1145 he was known to be gathering levies and stockpiling siege weapons in Baalbek. Some said that this was for the purposes of holy war, but rumours in nearby Damascus suggested that they were the next target.24 As so often, however, events to the east demanded his attention and, with Shirkuh, Saladin’s uncle, amongst his troops, he marched away to besiege Qa’lat Jabar, over 220 miles north-east on the Euphrates. There, in September 1146, Zengi met an unexpected, but predictably violent, end. The accounts vary in detail, but most agree that he engaged in a heavy drinking session and then passed out. Some versions say that he was murdered by a slave of Frankish origin, others that he awoke to find his eunuch servants drinking the leftover alcohol and that he threatened them with punishment in the morning. Fearing for their lives, the servants (literally) struck first and killed him in his bed.25 At the time Zengi emerged onto the scene, much of the political power in the Near East was highly localised, but he was the first Muslim ruler in the twelfth century to have the aggression, the ambition and the ability to take on a range of foes. His appointment as an atabeg (tutor or regent for a young prince) notwithstanding, Zengi asserted his independence from the Seljuk sultans of Iraq, periodically fought the Abbasid caliph, and was certainly intending to usurp power in Damascus from its existing Muslim rulers. Even the historian Ibn al-Athir, a real acolyte of the Zengid dynasty, wrote that its founder had orchestrated numerous rebellions against the Seljuk Sultan Mas’ud ‘in order to keep the sultan distracted so that he [Zengi] would have a free hand in expanding his frontiers and consolidating his power’.26 By the later stages of his career we can discern some flickering signs\n\nthe muslim near east and the first crusade\n\n19\n\nthat the jihad was part of contemporary discourse, but as an individual Zengi was not particularly known for his personal piety. It was through the next generation of Zengids that a wider and more systematic diffusion of ideas of holy war would take place – and it was in this same environment that Saladin himself grew up. Back in 1139 Zengi had captured the Damascene-controlled city of Baalbek about thirty-five miles to the north. After massacring the garrison, he installed Saladin’s father, Ayyub, as governor. But after the atabeg’s death, the Damascene ruler Unur took the chance to besiege Baalbek. Once water supplies ran low, surrender was inevitable. In November 1146 Ayyub handed the town to Unur in return for a few villages in the countryside near Damascus, and thus it was in these rather awkward circumstances that the Kurdish family came to be in and around the metropolis of Syria. Within a couple of years the Ayyubids had direct experience of the jihad when the armies of the Second Crusade laid siege to Damascus in the summer of 1148. The fall of Edessa had prompted the Franks to send appeals for help to western Europe and by the summer of 1147 the kings of France and Germany led the largest armies for fifty years to set out for the East. This aroused grave concerns in Muslim lands, although the crusaders’ poor discipline and the robust opposition of the Seljuk Turks of Anatolia drained much of their military strength before they even reached the Levant.27 By this time an earlier alliance between Damascus and Jerusalem had soured, meaning that while the recovery of Edessa had been the crusaders’ original aim, a council of crusaders and Franks now felt it acceptable to attack Damascus. In late June 1148 the armies of Jerusalem and the western crusaders set out to besiege the Muslim city. Following early progress through the dense orchards that protected the city, the Christians had paused in front of the walls where they met stern resistance. With Jerusalem now hostile, the Damascenes had conducted an about-turn and looked to the Zengids for help against the outside invaders.28 Perplexingly, the crusaders had brought little in the way of supplies or siege equipment and, fearing being caught between the defenders of Damascus and the advancing northern Syrians, they withdrew. This was a terrible humiliation. It was the first time that kings had been on a major crusade, and preachers in the West had whipped up an expectation of victory. St Bernard of\n\n20\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nClairvaux, the greatest orator of the age in Europe, had cried out ‘lucky is this generation’ to have such a chance of divine reward. Utterly convinced they would follow in the successful footsteps of the heroes of the First Crusade, they had instead feebly collapsed, not even suffering some epic defeat from which to derive a claim of heroism.29 This victory over the western forces was a huge boost to morale in the Muslim Near East. Understandably the large crusading armies had been feared, but now they had been completely faced down. As a Frankish chronicler wrote: ‘From this time the condition of the Latins in the East became visibly worse. Our enemies saw that the labours of our most powerful kings and leaders had been fruitless and all their efforts in vain . . . hence [the Muslims’] presumption and boldness rose to such heights that they no longer feared the Christian forces and did not hesitate to attack them with unwonted vigour.’30 It is likely that Saladin, aged around eleven years old, was inside Damascus during the siege. Ayyub had moved to the city after the surrender of Baalbek in 1146 and members of the family took part in fighting the crusaders, in the course of which Saladin’s elder brother was killed.31 By this stage, another figure was poised to seize the ascendancy in the Muslim Near East: Zengi’s younger son, Nur al-Din, meaning ‘light of the faith’, an appropriate name for the man who would do so much to energise the counter-crusade.32\n\n2 Nur al-Din and the City of Damascus ‘Gardens encircle it like the halo around the moon’\n\nNur al-Din became one of the central players in the history of the Muslim counter-crusade. As an overlord, patron, and later a rival, he exerted a huge influence on Saladin’s life for almost three decades, providing in many ways a blueprint for much of what the Ayyubid would do. Writers describe him as a handsome man with charming eyes; tall and swarthy, bearded only on his chin. He was greatly admired for his piety, learning and asceticism. The Franks, too, came to respect and fear an opponent who was a formidable warrior as well as a great leader. He was said to have carried two bows and two quivers into battle, a choice of weapon that emphasised his heritage as a Turkish warrior whose method of fighting was based around horse archers.1 Just like Zengi, Nur al-Din coveted Damascus and wished to take the city from its Burid rulers.2 He soon demonstrated his military skills at the Battle of Inab in northern Syria on 29 June 1149. The Frankish knights launched their famous charge, but the Muslims deliberately gave ground, divided in two and then turned upon their enemies. The result was a complete and utter rout. The leading Frankish warrior of the day was Prince Raymond of Antioch, a man who ‘had acquired special repute by the dread which he inspired by his great severity, and excessive ferocity’, yet he too was amongst the slain. When his body was found, a delighted Nur al-Din sent Raymond’s head to the caliph of Baghdad. Nur al-Din’s credentials as a holy warrior, ‘the Fighter of the Holy War, the\n\n22\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nChampion of the Faith’, were starting to build. Inscriptions on buildings in Aleppo from this time extol the virtues of the jihad, although this did not prevent him from looking to increase his personal and family power at the expense of other Sunni Muslims.3 In April 1150 Nur al-Din brought his forces down to Damascus, nominally in response to appeals from the inhabitants of the Hawran region to protect their flocks and villages from Christian raiders. As before, the Damascene leaders feared the intentions of outsiders and now doubled back to their former policy of asking the Franks of Jerusalem for help. This inevitably opened them to charges of colluding with the infidel and failing to protect their people and to engage in holy war: ‘This is displeasing in the sight of God.’4 In the event, in May 1150 a diplomatic solution was reached because Nur al-Din was said by Ibn al-Qalanisi, a contemporary Damascene politician and writer, to be unwilling to shed the blood of Muslims, a stark contrast to the approach of his father. A cynic might note that the chances of taking such a strong city as Damascus – likely to be reinforced by troops from Jerusalem – were slight. The inherent tension for those claiming to be fighting the enemies of the faith yet engaging in warfare against their fellow Sunni Muslims is a recurrent theme in this story and is an issue that would prove particularly challenging for Saladin. An acknowledgement of Nur al-Din’s overlordship and the insertion of his name in the khutba – the ritual address given in the Friday sermon that included an invocation to the recognised leaders of the community, meaning the caliph and also the emir or sultan – gave him a nominal hold over Damascus. His name was also put on the coins, the other customary sign of authority (the sikka). He presented senior figures from the city with garments known as robes of honour as a mark of their submission, while the poor and needy were given gifts too. This was all standard practice for a ruler and proved a form of behaviour that Saladin would take to vastly higher levels. The arrival of some of Nur al-Din’s religious advisors in the city was another signal of his longer-term aims, although for the moment the emir’s power there was still largely theoretical. A year later, in April 1151, Nur al-Din’s troops once more marched towards the city. Ibn al-Qalanisi again proclaimed the aspiring ruler had a scrupulous aversion to slaying Muslims and prioritised fighting\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n23\n\npolytheists (Franks) instead. After further negotiations a truce was made, a process that necessitated a prominent role for the Ayyubids. They were in the curious position of having one brother (Shirkuh) in Nur al-Din’s camp, and the other (Ayyub, Saladin’s father) now living under Damascene authority. The latter’s surrender of Baalbek to Unur back in 1146 was simple pragmatism, rather than betrayal, and with the help of a prominent local jurist the brothers formulated a treaty, an early instance of the family’s diplomatic skills.5 For a short period all was well, but in 1153 the Franks besieged the vital port of Ascalon. This was the only coastal city that remained in Muslim hands, albeit under the authority of the Egyptian Fatimid Shi’ite regime. It was also important as the location of the shrine of Husayn, the Prophet’s grandson and the son of Ali, the first Shi’ite Imam.6 Now, however, the city faced a major crisis in the form of a full Frankish assault, including a naval blockade.7 Setting aside sectarian differences with the Fatimids, both Nur al-Din and the Damascenes hoped to prevent the Christians from seizing this powerful city, but before the plan took effect they quarrelled. Such was the intensity of the siege it was likely Ascalon would have fallen anyway, but this division hardly helped. After seven months, the city capitulated in August 1153, marking a significant achievement for the Franks and providing a boost in morale after the failure of the Second Crusade five years earlier.8 For Nur al-Din the breakdown of this proposed campaign was the final straw. Ibn al-Qalanisi reported that political dissensions continued to simmer with a flurry of changes amongst the ruling elite signalling growing instability.9 In the early months of 1154, Nur al-Din employed another means to generate pressure, namely an economic blockade. Grain prices soared and the poor and the weak struggled badly. Shirkuh led an advance guard southward and by 25 April Nur al-Din had joined him at Damascus. Fighting broke out but resistance was half-hearted as a combination of lack of food and disapproval of the regime’s close relationship with Jerusalem took its toll. A Jewish woman let down a rope and one of the troops scrambled up to hoist Nur al-Din’s standard above the walls. Next a woodcutter smashed the bolts on the great East Gate, the doors were thrown open and Nur al-Din’s warriors surged in. The people welcomed them warmly and the emir swiftly assumed control,\n\n24\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\npromising safety to the leadership and acting firmly to prevent any looting.10 Nur al-Din used the opportunity of the first Friday prayers after his takeover to confirm the abolition of taxes that were un-Quranic, as well as those that were simply unpopular, including those on the melon market and the vegetable market, and the collection of taxes on using the canals.11 The removal of hated financial impositions of a previous regime is a standard course of action for most new rulers and, as in this instance, usually meets with enthusiasm and an expectation of better times. In Nur al-Din’s case, his wish to improve the living conditions of Damascenes really did prove to be genuine and this, coupled with a concerted policy of encouraging religious foundations, became the hallmarks of his domestic rule. Under his authority, Damascus became the hub of the countercrusade. It is one of the great cities of the world, a place saturated in layer upon layer of history, a past absorbed within its narrow streets, alleyways, minarets, markets and monuments, and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities on the planet, dating back 3,000 years. Prominent during the Assyrian, Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods, with the rise of Islam it became a centre for the Umayyad caliphate from 661 to 750. Next the Abbasids, then the Fatimids held the city and in the latter half of the eleventh century an offshoot of the Great Seljuks moved eastwards to assert themselves over much of Syria, taking Damascus in 1076. A few decades later it became the seat of the Burids, a semi-independent Turkish dynasty who sought to remain free of other local power-players such as Aleppo and the kingdom of Jerusalem.12 With such a kaleidoscopic past, the population was a religious and ethnic melting pot of Sunnis and Shi’is, Jews and Eastern Christians, Arabs, Bedouin and Turks. Medieval writers extolled its beauty and especially its sanctity; it was God’s Paradise on Earth. In later decades it was the place that Saladin returned to most often and was where he and his family clearly felt at home.13 The city lies on a plain a couple of kilometres south of the towering ridge of Mount Qasioun, revered as the birthplace of Abraham, while on the same hillside sits a cave containing traces of the blood of Abel, known as the Grotto of Blood. Although Damascus is not mentioned by name in the Quran, writers associated it with verses from the holy text. Traditions describe it as the stage for the\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n25\n\ncoming of the Messiah before the Day of Judgement with some asserting that this would occur in the Great Umayyad Mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites. Writers claim that Damascus was where God gave asylum to Jesus and his mother, while it was also the burial place of companions of the Prophet, such as his muezzin, and members of his family, including Ruqayya, the daughter of Ali.14 Below the mountainside of Qasioun runs the River Barada. This precious waterway rises in the Anti-Lebanon Mountains around twenty-five kilometres to the north-west and in spring it surges down a gorge into a fertile valley to spread out and bring life to an area of about thirty square kilometres, upon which the city lies. In medieval times the river also refreshed dozens of irrigation channels that nurture a vast girdle of orchards that almost surrounded the settlement. A visitor in the 1180s marvelled that ‘the gardens encircle it like the halo around the moon . . . wherever you look on its four sides its ripe fruit holds the gaze’.15 Nineteenth-century images show a similar vista, and even in the modern age a view from Mount Qasioun reveals swathes of trees still visible in the distance, pushed back by the concrete sprawl of the modern city. The mighty Mount Hermon (around 2,700 metres high) and the Golan Heights around forty kilometres south-west of the city create a formidable barrier to the Mediterranean Sea, itself only about seventy-five kilometres due west. Further north lies the bulk of Syria with, on the River Orontes, the cities of Hama and Homs and, about 350 kilometres north, the other great metropolis of Syria, Aleppo. Travellers heading south of Damascus pass through the Hawran region where fertile volcanic soil supports a vital wheat-growing area before this gives way to a more rugged landscape down into Transjordan. To the east of Damascus, the life-giving River Barada runs into a lake providing irrigation to a further stretch of rich agricultural land before that surrenders to dry grasslands and then desert. Trade and pilgrimage helped shape the city, in the latter instance because Damascus was one of the prime gathering places for haj caravans heading south to Mecca and Medina in the Arabian peninsula. Multiple trade routes from as far away as India came through the Jazira, while goods produced there and in Anatolia and northern Syria also came to Damascus where they could either funnel west to the Frankish ports on the coast, or go down to Egypt, Arabia and the Red Sea.16\n\n26\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nThrough a combination of his political and religious will, Nur al-Din was able to create a city that became the theological engine room for the jihad. With Jerusalem in the hands of unbelievers, Damascus stepped forwards to generate the spiritual energy to recover it; arguably in doing so, it supplanted Baghdad as the principal centre of Sunni religious thought at the time. This powerful combination of the city’s deep religiosity and its important strategic location came to exert a powerful pull on Saladin down the years. The walled city of Damascus is roughly oval-shaped, about 1,600 metres long and 900 metres wide. Ten gates punctuate this girdle with the old Roman artery known as ‘the Street Called Straight’ bisecting the city east–west just below its mid-point; most of the key buildings lie north of this. The dominant structures, then and now, are the citadel and, the real jewel, the Great Umayyad Mosque, or the Congregational Mosque as it is also known, a building admired by all down the centuries. The Spanish pilgrim Ibn Jubayr was awestruck when he visited in 1184: ‘For beauty, perfection of construction, marvellous and sumptuous embellishment and decoration, it is one of the most celebrated mosques of the world.’17 An institution of such size and prestige was obviously a spiritual focus and it ranks amongst the holiest mosques in Islam. As with all mosques it was a place of daily worship, but it also acted as a repository for sacred objects and as a base for preachers, reciters, jurists, theologians and teachers. Precious items such as the Quran of Uthman (a companion of the Prophet and the third caliph), which helped to inspire the defence of the city against the Second Crusade in 1148, were housed there for people to venerate, while the shrine of the head of the prophet known to us as John the Baptist stands in the main prayer hall.18 The main courtyard is a broad open area, fifty metres wide and over 140 metres long, colonnaded on three sides. On the south is the prayer hall, a wonderful space with its three aisles raised on a forest of over sixty pillars, all complementing a richly ornamented mihrab. In the central aisle is a great lead dome standing high and proud on the city’s skyline and likened by the locals to the head of a mighty eagle; Ibn Jubayr was thrilled to be allowed to climb up into the roof space and rhapsodised that this was ‘a spectacle that sends the senses reeling . . . stupendous, so miraculously constructed . . . more astounding than what is told of the wonders of the world’.19 The\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n27\n\nmosque was a social space too, and within the courtyard and the hall groups of locals and pilgrims sat, talked, listened and learned, as they still do today. Above the entrance to the main prayer hall the gold, green and blue mosaics depicting fine buildings, trees and rivers continue to catch the afternoon sun. An ablutions fountain, the eighthcentury treasury building, also wrapped in mosaic, along with an ingenious water clock (no longer extant) all inhabited this space. But it was the preachers who took centre stage, men from across the Islamic world from Iberia to western Asia, representing the different and rival schools of Sunni jurisprudence, addressing audiences at setpiece moments, especially the Friday prayers, but also teaching, debating and studying. Mosques were very much places of education in religion, grammar, law, logic and history.20 The Friday sermon was the optimum moment to deliver news as well as religious instruction, not least in the progress of the holy war. Here, and in reaction to other sermons, the audience itself might then respond, question, assimilate and disseminate what they had heard.21 Of course, there were other mosques in Damascus; Ibn Asakir, a contemporary cleric and writer, listed 242 within the walls. These were not just the grand buildings endowed by the political elite, but could be much more humble institutions sponsored by artisans, such as butchers, or camel-dealers.22 Under Nur al-Din, madrasas saw an enormous expansion. At the start of his time in power, there were sixteen madrasas across his lands; by his death in 1174, a further fiftysix had been added. Similarly, khanqahs – buildings that housed Sufi mystics, ascetics who lived in communities and prayed and chanted – grew up. Ibn Jubayr witnessed some of these holy men listening to music and attaining ‘an abstracted state of rapture’ during his stay in the city.23 Damascus was more than a religious centre. The citadel was a formidable rectangular complex in the north-western corner of the city, a place that acted as a base for government containing, for example, a treasury and a prison, and a barracks for troops fighting the countercrusade. Nur al-Din soon reinforced the defences, strengthening the walls and further fortifying some of the towers and gatehouse, adding a small mosque to the latter.24 The admiring pen of Ibn Asakir gives us a glimpse into the daily life of the city that Saladin came to know so well.25 The provision of\n\n28\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nwater was essential in such a dense urban environment and the Damascenes prided themselves on their complex canal systems with over a hundred sub-channels delivering water to baths, mosques and khanqahs, houses and gardens, and to commerce, as well as public latrines. Fine air and good water were real marks of status for a city, and Damascus confidently asserted its standing in these respects. As the Quran says, water is a gift from God, and a hadith notes that there is no greater gift of alms than to give a drink of water. Bathhouses were of special note as one place for the ritual ablutions central to religious practice. They were run by a master of the house, with a bather, a water-carrier, a cleaner and a man to heat the water. In Nur al-Din’s time there was a ratio of one bathhouse to six mosques and the hammam that he founded still exists deep in the old city of Damascus offering a vigorous experience to today’s visitors.26 Water fountains provided refreshment and a way to clean the streets; public toilets were plentiful, a contrast to the contemporary West. In Damascus, no less than forty public toilet facilities could be counted in the mid-1180s, with one thirty-seater facility attracting particular praise from Ibn Jubayr.27 Stepping away from the central thoroughfares and the grander stone buildings, a visitor would be drawn down much narrower streets and passages, twisting and turning past the smaller mosques, madrasas and marketplaces. As a major metropolis the range of trades was considerable; we read of main markets for fruit, wheat, grain and vegetables, supplemented by the presence of the money-changers needed to cope with the multiple coinages that swirled around the trade routes of the Near East.28 Other foodstuffs had specialised districts too, such as sugar or roasted meat, yoghurt and cheese. Clothing markets for hats and furs were noted, as well as districts that dealt in more exotic products such as perfumes, pearls, birds, novelties and gifts, and ice. Some of these little enclaves had bathhouses too, hence the Bath of the Pearlers, or the Bath of the Cheese sellers. The distinctive noises and smells of each street, along with the push and shove of traders, pilgrims, clerics and soldiers, made for an energised community that impressed contemporary tourists; Ibn Jubayr thought the markets ‘the finest in the world’.29 Other essential institutions, such as orphanages, were also commented upon by writers. Orphanages could be places of teaching,\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n29\n\nand Ibn Jubayr observed approvingly that in contrast to his own homeland in Spain the Damascene boys learned the Quran by memory and practised writing through poetry. Thus, if they made a mistake their error would not defile the sacred text.30 The production of books was undoubtedly stimulated by the religious institutions supported by Nur al-Din, and literature, both sacred and secular, was a prime trade in the al-Kallasa district of Damascus where there was a market for booksellers every Friday. The breathtaking calligraphy in various surviving texts testifies to the skill and technique of some of these artisans. This was also a trade practised by women; Ibn al-Athir recorded with sadness the passing of Shuhda, known as Fahkr al-Nisa, meaning ‘the Pride of Women’, a renowned calligrapher. Book production is also a sign and a stimulus to the creation of libraries; the Near East was, in comparison to the contemporary West, an immensely literate society, and the survival of a later Ayyubid library catalogue from Damascus gives an extraordinary glimpse into this world.31 A beautiful example of Nur al-Din’s contribution towards the wellbeing of his people still exists in the old city: his bimaristan or hospital, founded in 1154. Wonderful wooden doors, studded with bronze nails forming geometrical astral patterns, announce an institution of real prestige. The doors were designed by a man known as al-Muhandis (the geometer), a carpenter, a stonemason, a writer on science and literature, and a man who read hadith, grammar and poetry; a powerful combination, and in its range not unrepresentative of so many amongst the creative classes of the Near East.32 A tall muqarnas facade (made up of small prisms that form a honeycomb-style structure) towers above this doorway drawing the visitor into an oasis of calm after the energy of the markets outside. After walking under a spectacular square dome of descending muqarnas, pierced by natural light, the visitor is in a courtyard dominated by a rectangular pool flanked by four iwans, arched structures each leading to rooms for staff and patients. A thirteenth-century writer who learned and worked in the building recorded that Nur al-Din ensured the hospital bearing his name was endowed with numerous medical texts, indicating again the importance he attached to it, and that it was a place of study, as well as one of physical and spiritual healing. It treated men and women and also had a room for the mentally unwell, in addition to a library and teaching room. The place survived as a\n\n30\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nhospital until the late nineteenth century when it became an orphanage for girls; it is now a museum.33 Not all of the city was fine buildings; many of the lesser houses were built of mud and reeds, rendering them extremely vulnerable to fire. Public spaces were essential too. Areas in the south of the walled city contained the fragrant flowers and trees of the Garden of the Cat. To the north-west, either side of the River Barada, lay two large open spaces ‘so green as to seem to be rolls of silk brocade, enclosed by a wall with the river between them, and bordering them is a large wood of poplars forming a very pleasant sight’. These hippodromes were suitable for archery, horse racing and for polo, a passion shared by Nur al-Din and Saladin. Even though the former has a rather austere reputation he was not entirely without a lighter side, and such was his abiding passion for polo that as Imad al-Din (Nur al-Din’s and then Saladin’s secretary) wrote, ‘he would often go out in the dark and play by the light of candles as the day began to break and Saladin would ride out to play with him every morning. He was knowledgeable in the etiquette of the game at court and in the accepted rules.’34 The social elite of the Kurdish and Turkmen tribes were practically raised in the saddle and the fiercely competitive environment of the polo pitch was a favourite recreation, as well as encouraging the equestrian skills so essential in contemporary warfare.35 Nur al-Din’s takeover of Damascus marked a significant advance in his power. For the first time since the foundation of the Latin East the cities of Aleppo, Mosul and Damascus were under the control of the same family, the Zengids, representing a serious increase in the threat level to the Franks. With Damascus firmly in his grasp, the conflict with the Christians became more aggressive. After the defeat of a Frankish force in the north in 1156, the severed heads of the slain were sent to Damascus and carried in procession around the city.36 A subsequent truce suited both sides but when the Christians foolishly savaged Arab and Turkmen grazing their horses and cattle near Banyas, Nur al-Din was livid, partly because an oath had been broken but also because it did little for his credentials as a new local ruler. In the spring of 1157 preparations began for a campaign against ‘the accursed enemies of God’. This included the decoration of the citadel and royal palace with swords, spears, armour and shields; with captured Frankish\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n31\n\narmour, and with banners, flags, drums and trumpets. In other words, a symbolic showing of the weapons of war, the means by which the conflict would be taken to the infidel. Ibn al-Qalanisi wrote that such a ceremony was unknown in Damascus (and he was from an established family in the city), but it patently excited the population who all pressed to view the spectacle and to express their admiration.37 By the end of April they could see the results of this display when, after a resounding victory over the forces of Jerusalem, Nur al-Din called a public holiday. Once more the heads of the slain, prisoners and captured equipment were processed around Damascus to the delight of the citizens and, as Ibn al-Qalanisi wrote, manifested God’s punishment on the shameless polytheists.38 Nur al-Din’s holy war was beginning to gather momentum. Shirkuh commanded a large contingent of Turkmen warriors, said to be full of ardour for the jihad, while in Damascus itself, a public appeal for volunteers to fight met with an enthusiastic response from young men, Sufis, lawyers and others. An emphatic victory over the forces of the kingdom of Jerusalem at Jacob’s Ford, just north of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Tiberias), in June 1157 offered the chance to refine further the victory-parade format. This time, captured Frankish horsemen were set in pairs upon camels, accompanied by an unfurled standard decorated with the scalps of the slain. Castellans were kept on horseback in their armour and helmets but had to carry these grotesque standards; lesser men such as foot soldiers and turcopoles, were roped together in threes and fours and bundled through the streets. Also on view were huge quantities of equipment, including something intriguingly described as ‘their church with its famous apparatus’.39 Signs of God’s support and the overt humiliation of the Franks were the orders of the day. Within the writings of Ibn al-Qalanisi the language of religious conflict steps up. Nur al-Din urged proclamations to be made to the people of Damascus to commit themselves to the jihad, to fight the Franks, ‘the upholders of polytheism and heresy’.40 Those Muslims killed in the conflict were lauded as martyrs. The geographical extent of his dominions inevitably required Nur al-Din’s presence in the north, with danger from the Frankish principality of Antioch and various attacks by the Turkish sultan of Iconium. Tough a warrior as he was, in October 1157 Nur al-Din was afflicted by a severe fever. It looked to be fatal and so he\n\n32\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\nsummoned his brother, Nusrat al-Din, along with Shirkuh and other leading emirs. He gave Aleppo to his sibling and directed that Shirkuh was to hold Damascus as his lieutenant.41 As the illness intensified Nur al-Din was carried by litter to Aleppo while Shirkuh hurried southwards to protect Damascus should the Franks seek to exploit this turn of events. In the end the crisis passed but it took a couple of months for Nur al-Din to recover. When he did, Shirkuh headed back north to join him in Aleppo ‘in the holy war against the enemies of God’. Ibn al-Qalanisi notes how Shirkuh was received with honour and praised for his zeal; the Ayyubid warrior had risen far under the Zengid banner. This was an impressive transformation for a family that had needed to seek refuge with Zengi in the late 1130s. Two decades later their senior figure now stood as Nur al-Din’s most trusted lieutenant, charged with governing one of the greatest cities in the Near East. It showed adaptability, as well as military and diplomatic talent; not a bad exemplar for the young Saladin. Diplomacy had its place too, especially when an opponent was particularly strong or when one faced a number of threats simultaneously. The arrival of the Byzantine emperor Manuel Komnenos (r.1143– 80) in northern Syria in early 1159 generated near-panic amongst all the local powers, Frankish, Armenian and Muslim. The Byzantine Empire, Greek Orthodox in faith, was well past its peak, but in contemporary terms it still represented a genuinely heavyweight entity and Manuel wished to re-establish some of the authority, both religious and political, that his predecessors had enjoyed.42 Given the obvious power of the Greeks, Nur al-Din prudently released a number of captives from the prisons of Aleppo. Some had been there since the Second Crusade ten years before, others had arrived more recently, such as a captive from Jacob’s Ford, the master of the Templars. These were the warrior monks sworn to defend Christian lands against the Muslims and who would become one of Saladin’s most deadly enemies. In response to the prisoner release the Greek emperor sent robes, jewels, a brocade tent (objects of particular esteem given how long rulers of the day spent on campaign) and many horses. Of greater use to Nur al-Din was an alliance against their mutual enemies, the Seljuks of Asia Minor, although troubles back towards Constantinople drew Manuel home.43 After the uncertainties of his illnesses Nur al-Din\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n33\n\nwanted to mark his achievement in resisting the emperor with a huge feast for his commanders and warriors.44 A brief period of calm ensued, not least because a series of major players died. The caliph of Baghdad passed away after a twenty-fouryear reign in March 1160. A month earlier, his Shi’ite counterpart, the eleven-year-old Fatimid caliph, had died in Cairo leaving the vizier, Ibn Ruzzik, to choose a youth, al-Adid, as his successor. Ibn Ruzzik had, however, alienated many of the Egyptian nobility and he was murdered in September 1161. The vizierate, which by this stage was, de facto, the position of ultimate political and military authority in Egypt, became the focus of a bitter contest. The Fatimid state was vulnerable anyway, but when this internal power struggle started to cascade outwards to involve the Franks and Muslim Syria, the ramifications were immense. Such instability offered these ambitious neighbours the chance to transform their own standing and potentially to achieve a position of supremacy.45 The fight for Egypt would dominate the military scene in the Levant for decades. Put simply, relative to Syria or the kingdom of Jerusalem, Egypt was fabulously wealthy. Alexandria was, by a fair margin, the prime commercial port in the Mediterranean for trade routes from the Maghreb, the Red Sea, India, sub-Saharan Africa and the gold mines of West Africa. It was attractive to the Christian merchants of Byzantium and the Italian cities of Venice, Genoa and Pisa, as well as catering for the nearer markets of Syria and the Latin East. A contemporary Frankish historian, William of Tyre, provides this glowing description of Alexandria and, by extension, the riches of Egypt itself: Alexandria is most conveniently situated for carrying on extensive commerce. It has two ports that are separated from one another by a very narrow stretch of land. At the end of that tongue rises a tower of marvellous height called the Pharos. By the Nile, Alexandria receives from Upper Egypt an abundance of food supplies of every kind and, indeed, a wealth of almost every commodity. If there is anything that the country itself lacks, it is brought by ships from the lands across the sea in profuse abundance. As a result, Alexandria has the reputation of receiving a larger supply of wares of every description than any other maritime city. Whatever part of the world lacks in the matter of\n\n34\n\nThe Life and Legend Of The Sultan Saladin\n\npearls, spices, Oriental treasures, and foreign wares is brought hither from the two Indies; Saba, Arabia, and both the Ethiopias, as well as from Persia and other lands nearby . . . People from East and West flock thither in great numbers, and Alexandria is a public market for both worlds.46\n\nWhoever succeeded in gaining power in Egypt would have this at their disposal and the capability to hold sway over the eastern Mediterranean. One candidate for the vizierate was Shawar, the former governor of Upper Egypt, who had murdered Ibn Ruzzik’s successor and then taken his clan’s money and possessions for himself. The emergence of a rival, Dirgham, caused Shawar to flee to Syria seeking help from the court of Nur al-Din; in other words, giving the Damascene ruler a ready-made entry into the affairs of Egypt. Dirgham, meanwhile, established himself as vizier of Egypt, although in consolidating his own position he killed many other emirs, removing a layer of experienced leadership and increasing the regime’s vulnerability down the line. In the short term, one potential aggressor – the kingdom of Jerusalem – had to deal with a succession issue too. On 10 February 1163, aged only thirty-two, Baldwin III died of dysentery leaving no children. The throne fell to his brother, Amalric, a tall, overweight man with receding blond hair and a taciturn disposition. He was, however, an energetic and proactive ruler who would certainly engage directly with his myriad opponents.47 This change of characters set the scene for the Ayyubids to emerge onto a wider political stage. Of Saladin’s activities at this time we know almost nothing. In 1160 his uncle Shirkuh chose to go on the haj to Mecca, the duty of all Muslims at least once in their lives.48 As a young noble at court, most likely based in Damascus, Saladin enjoyed games of polo and hunting. He is described as a carefree individual, contrasting with his later devotion and personal austerity. It would be logical for him to take part in some of the military expeditions of the time and we learn that he joined Shirkuh, who seems to have been far more warlike than Saladin’s father, in a visit to Aleppo in the early 1150s. Saladin would likely have seen the processions of Frankish prisoners through Damascus and been exposed to the increasing intensity of jihad propaganda, both in sermons and via the physical surroundings of the city.\n\nnur al-din and the city of damascus\n\n35\n\nThis was the religious and political climate in which Saladin grew up. His Kurdish clan had moved from the rural Jazira to the more densely populated land of Syria and the great city of Damascus. Through military and administrative skill and by adherence to two powerful and successful patrons they had seen their own standing grow and grow. This in turn enabled them to show patronage of their own to relatives and supporters alike. In broader terms, the complexities of the Muslim Near East were omnipresent, although Nur al-Din’s developing authority had at least brought a good number of towns, regions and groups under one banner and the Zengid Empire was taking shape. The polyglot nature of the region, and its rich and complex recent history, meant the inhabitants had become accustomed to a succession of new masters who were often – as in the case of the Zengids – outsiders. The Christians of Armenia and Byzantium also had to be reckoned with and, through the prism of the holy war, so did the Franks. Yet adherence to the Sunni caliphate did not just mean fighting Christians but sometimes to an even sharper extent the Shi’ites (themselves variously subdivided) who were labelled heretics by the Sunni and therefore appropriate targets. In a modern context, fighting a jihad or a crusade tends to signal notions of extremism, concepts that by their very nature are markers of inflexibility. In the terms of twelfth-century Syria and the Holy Land, to assume such rigidity would be a mistake. Truces, alliances, agreements, betrayals, co-operation and dynastic ambition saturated the political atmosphere, delivering opportunities and flexibility to all. It was in just such an environment that Shirkuh and the Ayyubids were able to transform their fortunes.\n\n3 Nur al-Din and the Rise of the Jihad ‘May God grant [Nur al-Din] success . . . fulfilling what is best for people . . . exalt him in victory with his army’\n\nIn the spring of 1163, near the fortress of Hisn al-Akrad – later known to the world as Krak des Chevaliers, the finest of all crusader castles – Nur al-Din and his forces were utterly thrashed by the Franks. The Zengid commander was rarely ousted in open battle and being put roundly to flight was a profound shock; so great was the panic that he even abandoned his own sword. Such a defeat represented a significant blow to his standing. While being careful to guard against contemporary reports overdramatising the impact of this loss, the reverse seems to have had a cathartic effect on the emir and prompted him to sharpen his focus on the jihad, in both its internal and external forms. Ibn ad-Adim, an Aleppan chronicler, reports a story in which a man asked Nur al-Din how the sultan would ever have success when, in his camp, one could find bottles of alcohol, hear the tambourine and the flute played, and see other objects abhorred by God. Poets scorned him: ‘And do not think that glory is found in alcohol and female singers; there is no glory except in a sword and in fighting.’1 A chastened Nur al-Din promised to perform penance and discarded luxurious clothing for coarse materials, a far more appropriate image for the holy warrior. He also abolished practices that were contrary to divine law and punished immoral behaviour. Instructions to this effect were dispatched to his governors forthwith.2 He had been fighting under the banner of the jihad for well over a decade but from now onwards his programme of religious patronage and engagement\n\nnur al-din and the rise of the jihad\n\n37\n\nwith holy war ramped up considerably. In doing so, he shaped much of the spiritual and strategic environment that Saladin grew up in, and which the latter was then able to take forwards. The strategic balance between the Syrian Muslims, the Franks and the Egyptians was at a delicate point too. The exiled vizier Shawar offered Nur al-Din one-third of Egypt’s vast revenues if he helped him to regain authority and the Syrians kept an army there to support him – a tantalising prospect, but one that needed careful thought. On the one hand Nur al-Din was worried about Shawar’s trustworthiness and the scale of the commitment required, but equally he could appreciate the potential to transform the geopolitical situation in the Near East. Eventually, he agreed to act; the leader of the expedition was to be Shirkuh. ‘He alone was fit for this mighty matter’, and was said to be very energised by the prospect.3 In following these events we have, alongside the Muslim sources, the voice of a particularly close observer from the Christian perspective. William of Tyre was the great chronicler of the twelfth-century crusader states. Born in the Holy Land, but educated extensively in Europe, he returned home to hold high church offices and to act as a trusted royal diplomat. He later rose to become archbishop of Tyre and royal chancellor, and compiled his lengthy narrative between 1170 and his death in 1185.4 He was, therefore, an ideally placed contemporary: often an eyewitness, and certainly in a pos"
