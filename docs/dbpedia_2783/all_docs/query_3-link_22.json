        "text": "Saladin whose full name is Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub was a courageous and respected Muslim leader from the 12th century. He was born in 1137 in Tikrit a town in present-day Iraq. His family was of Kurdish origin and Saladin grew up in a noble and well-respected household. Even from a young age he showed exceptional intelligence and a strong interest in military and political affairs.\n\nDuring his early years Saladin received a good education in the Islamic sciences literature and military strategies. He also learned valuable lessons from his uncle Shirkuh a renowned military commander. Shirkuh took Saladin under his wing and mentored him teaching him the ways of leadership and warfare.\n\nSaladin’s journey to conquer Jerusalem began in 1174 when he became the sultan of Egypt and Syria. He quickly established himself as a capable and wise ruler earning the respect of both his allies and adversaries. His conquests in Egypt and Syria strengthened his position and he soon set his sights on the city of Jerusalem which was under the control of the Christian Crusaders at the time."
