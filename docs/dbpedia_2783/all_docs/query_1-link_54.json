        "text": "(Book website: https://www.peterlang.com/document/1062267) For so long, scholarship in the West has argued that the memory of Saladin, the renowned, twelfth-century Kurdish-Muslim ruler, along with the memory of the Crusades, was “all but forgotten” in Islamic history prior to the onset of the modern period. Although recent studies have slowly begun to overturn this thesis, however, research on the topic so far has continued to neglect the many accounts on Saladin’s reign and the Crusades found in late medieval and early modern Arabo-Islamic historiography. This lacunae in scholarship is even more compelling considering that the sources dating from the early sixteenth to the late eighteenth centuries reveal a rich record of Saladin’s achievements; the sources also include numerous reports on other major Muslim figures who fought the Crusades, such as the Zengid ruler Nūr al-Dīn and the famous Mamlūk sultans Baybars and Qalawūn. Therefore, the present study will posit the hypothesis that Saladin’s reign and accomplishments, along with the history of the Crusades in the region, were etched into the historical memory of the Muslim world long after the end of the epoch. It will advance this thesis by exploring the much-neglected Arabo-Islamic historiographical sources dating from the early sixteenth to late eighteenth centuries, such as the universal chronicles, biographical dictionaries, and other historiographical genres. Based on this explorative survey, the study will further advance the emerging thesis that the memory of Saladin was not neglected after his death, but, rather, the Kurdish sultan’s career, along with the Age of the Crusades in general, left a lasting impression on the Islamic Near East during the late medieval and early modern period.\n\nThe image of Saladin as known in the contemporary Arab world is the result of a long evolution through popular culture. The character of Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (Saladin) was mediated many times in 20th-century Arab popular media. His odyssey started in the genre of drama during the Arab Enlightenment, then continued in Egyptian cinema, Syrian television dramas and latterly animated films. The character of what became the “enlightened Arab/Muslim ruler” was first discovered by the authors of minority groups in the late 19th century, and was subsequently used by Arab political forces, who inspired and also supported artists to make popular adaptations in order to draw analogies between past and present. This article aims to prove that it was most probably the later narratives presented by theatre and film rather than ideological works that inspired Arab politicians to use Saladin’s memory for their own sakes, and that it was the Saladin images presented in Arab cinema and television that played a crucial role in shaping the popular image of Saladin in the contemporary Arab world. Movies and serials not only play an increasingly important role in reshaping representations of history but have become a main source for learning about particular historical events. The character of Saladin has been adapted and appropriated not only to teach people about their past, but to support political agendas of the present as well.\n\nAncient Near Eastern state agencies that produced monumental art and architecture and crafted rare works out of luxury materials were essentially materializing their own interpretations of reality and thereby producing memories. Because elite memories were rendered into concrete forms and images, they dominated and endured. Thus, ruling bodies curated their particular memories through a range of canonical sites, monuments, and artworks, which they would have viewed as most representative of their power and legitimacy. Modern canons of ancient Near Eastern art and architecture are an indirect legacy of antiquity’s broken and biased record. Modern aesthetic and political agendas have isolated certain archaeological finds and elevated them to canonical status as representatives of a past best suited to modern needs. This essay aims to detangle the ancient and modern canons, and using the Assyrians as a case study, proposes a new memory-based paradigm for canon construction.\n\nMemory is a constructed system of references, in equilibrium, of feeling and rationality. Comparing ancient and contemporary mechanisms for the preservation of memories and the building of a common cultural, political and social memory, this volume aims to reveal the nature of memory, and explores the attitudes of ancient societies towards the creation of a memory to be handed down in words, pictures, and mental constructs. Since the multiple natures of memory involve every human activity, physical and intellectual, this volume promotes analyses and considerations about memory by focusing on various different cultural activities and productions of ancient Near Eastern societies, from artistic and visual documents to epigraphic evidence, and by considering archaeological data. The chapters of this volume analyse the value and function of memory within the ancient Near Eastern and Egyptian societies, combining archaeological, textual and iconographical evidence following a progression from the analysis of the creation and preservation of both single and multiple memories, to the material culture (things and objects) that shed light on the impact of memory on individuals and community.\n\nThis thesis seeks to uncover and understand the strange historical journey of the Muslim Sultan Yusuf ibn Ayyub, known to the West as Saladin. The historic Saladin was a ruler famous for his successful campaigns against the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, his victory at the Battle of Hattin, and his holding action against the Third Crusade. Upon Saladin’s death in 1193, he became the subject of numerous legends, most of which describe him as a merciful, chivalric, and ideal leader of men. The epitome of what a thirteenth century European noble was supposed to be. This thesis seek to explain how these legends helped form cultural identities, it will also show how the legends of Saladin evolved over time, through a direct comparison between the legend’s role in the thirteenth century and the twentieth century. Further, this thesis will show how these legends, rather than being simple justifications for Saladin’s success and behavior, are in fact a vehicle which historians and writers can use to better understand English and French medieval culture, and how those two cultural groups defined themselves as societies. Despite vast cultural changes to England and France over those seven hundred years, the legends would again be used to help define the identity of those two nations. Not only is this thesis trying to justify Saladin’s success and behavior, these later legends are deeply intertwined with justifications for imperialism and scientific racism. The unpacking of these legends will not only help the reader to better understand who Saladin truly was, but understand the culture of Europe as well.\n\n\"Ancient people were conscious of their past and the importance of its legacy in the present and future of societies they were living in. However, how did the mechanisms of remembering and building memories work? Monuments, myths, legends and poems were essential part of the process of building memories, sometimes implying the destruction and cancellation of a previous tradition. Can we speak of a common mnemonic heritage or did different (sometimes contrasting) memories co-exist? Maybe, the creation of a common shared memory was prerogative of the royal power, while, more probably, several “fighting” memories exist. In particular the study will take into consideration the commemoration of kings and kingship in the Assyrian period pointing out the mechanisms of commemoration by the Assyrian kings and the events related to the growth of the Assyrian power: while it might be inferred that Assyrian kings and officials shared the same mechanism of commemoration (through written sources, architectures and visual media), it is indeed evident that different operations and perceptions co-existed all along the history of the Neo-Assyrian period: cancellation and forgetfulness were also crucial elements of the process of commemorating\""
