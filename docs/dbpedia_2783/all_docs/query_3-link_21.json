Or should all the credit go to Saladin for his plan and tactics? \nCould the situation of the Latin Kingdoms after Hattin have been retrieved or was the aftermath inevitable? \nAll thoughts welcomed. :book:",

        "text": "The main problems for the Crusader army was that it was in the hands of a follish and impetous youth. Guy of Lusignan was only brought to the throne due to his looks and his charm which was infectious on sybella and her foolish and dimwitted mother Agnes. The Movie Kingdom of Heaven portrayal of Guy and Sybella is wrong and way off the mark.\n\nRaymond of Tripoli and the Ibelin brothers forwarned Guy not to travel and fight Saladin's army even though the forces were equal around 20,000 men each, any numbers over that is simply daft especially in the case of the the Latin states as most of their manpower came from the large coastal cities and the drips and drabs of Crusader contingents coming through ports such as St Symeon in the north and the larger cities of the south. The large cities of antioch, Tripoli and Jerusalem could raise between 300-400 heavy horse and around 3-4,000 infantry men.\n\nThe main causes of the disaster of Hattin was due to two men, one the infamous Reynald De Chatillon and the other being Gerard de Ridefort master of the Temple. Their influence over Guy to bring battle to Saladin brought the Crusader army to destruction. Raymond had warned Guy to stay around Sephoria and let the Muslim army to come to them but wiser council did not prevail.\n\nIf Conrad of Monferrat had not arrived in late September at Tyre it would have fell along with most of their other coastal strongholds of Palestine. Although the battle was crippling to the Crusader States the loss of Jerusalem did see the third Crusade with more reinforcements and the capture of arce, a vital city and port which could be reinforced by sea with Pisan or Genoese help but that of course also came for a ransom like price with streets and rich quarters all being ceded to the wily Italian martime states.\n\nYes Saladin was a great leader who was a caring and respected individual but his ruthlessness in his rise in his early years often seems to be forgetten when discussing his character. After Saladin's death however there was a power struggle and more civil wars as his empire was ran by his personality and character. The problem with Medieval Islam was its lack of permanent institutions and when a leader died if not replaced by a capable monarch things began to crumple, which was what happened under his sons. This allowed the Latin Kingdoms respite and time to rebuild but never would they be able to challenge Islam in a major pitch battle in the east as man power and the feudal elements began to diminish.\n\nOnly through treaties and the occassional useful ally, say in the face of the Mongols but even that was often wasted especially when the Ill khanate attempted to ally itself with outremer to destroy the Mamluks in the late 13th century. But this chance was wasted as the crumpiling latin cities will and bravery seemed to vanish. Sadly, the only real flash of the old spirit and battlefield prowess was at the end with the siege of Acre, a last brave stand against overwhelming forces which was doomed to fail from the outset but will always be remembered.\n\nWhile I think you guys have said all to the reasons for the failure of the Crusaders (I think it was their own fault than Saladin's genius that spelled their doom), I will comment that the Crusader tactics were not at faulty when engaged.\n\nThey used what they had, and to the effect they could. They marched in a box, with crossbowmen on the outside, infantry supporting them against enemy cavalry and finally the knights and mounted sergeants in the middle able to quickly respond to danger or charge out should the need be.\n\nThis formation held, and while there were losses among the horses, it wasn't as bad as sometime portrayed. If it was then I wonder how a significant force of knights managed to batter their way through.\n\nHad the battle, or rather the campaign taken place in the more 'wet' interior, I doubt that Saladin would have won, he could have, he was after all a very good commander, but his strengths lay not in tactics but in strategy, diplomacy (persionality) and not the least in the understanding of his enemies' psyche. And that last point makes me wonder if there would even have been a battle, if not at Hattin...\n\nBut if the fall had not come at Hattin, it would just have come later. The Outremer was an untenable position, too few in population, too many lords vying for power and too many people coming from Europe, and messing up any unstable peace in their religious fervour."
