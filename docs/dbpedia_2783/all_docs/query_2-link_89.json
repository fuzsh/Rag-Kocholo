Summary: Saladin, the great twelfth century Middle East leader, not only created an empire, but also reduced the Crusader presence in the Holy Land. In a comprehensive manner and clear prose, Peter Gubser describes how Saladin rose to power, conquered lands, governed peoples, and raised armies. In addition, he clearly addresses Saladin's imperial motives, a combination of ambition and the devotion to the ideal of the unity of Islam. 1.\n\nSaladin, Sultan of Egypt and Syria, 1137-1193. 2.\n\nIslamic Empire--Biography. 3.

At the American University of Beirut, I was fortunate to work with Nabih Faris, Malcolm Kerr (on sabbatical from the University of California, Los Angeles), Yusif Ibish, Nicola Ziadeh, and Mahmoud Zayid. At Oxford University, I was able to delve broadly into Middle East issues with Albert Hourani, Roger Owen, E. E. EvansPritchard, and Peter Lienhardt. In addition, as a student and later with the University of Manchester (UK), the Ford Foundation, and American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA), I lived and traveled extensively in the region. During these years, I visited most of the lands that Saladin brought under his rule. I especially wish to thank my colleagues who took the time and effort to read the manuscript at various stages of its development: Max Gross, Ted Gorton, Edmund Ghareeb, and Jenab Tutunji. Their comments, suggestions, and insights contributed positively to the final version of my biography of Saladin. Paula McNicholas provided invaluable editorial advice, which I utilized to improve the text. Naturally, I take sole responsibility for the manuscript. I also wish to express my gratitude to George Kiraz and his colleagues at Gorgias Press for their help in the preparation and publication of the book. They were always thoughtful, professional, and efficient. Similarly, I acknowledge David Herbick for his skillful preparation of the excellent maps that are essential to and accompany the text. Lastly, I am deeply grateful to Annie, my wife, for her continual support. She has indulged my life-long interest in the Middle East and always encouraged me as I researched and wrote about Saladin’s life and times. xiii\n\nINTRODUCTION SALADIN AND HIS TIMES Saladin, a great Muslim leader of medieval times, intrigued scholars and observers in the twelfth century and still intrigues them in current times. The literature from the two periods is rich, though not always satisfactory in detail and, at times, partisan and contradictory. Utilizing these occasionally problematic sources, I seek to develop an understanding of Saladin’s career and its impact on the Middle East and on Muslim-European relations by addressing four interrelated questions, two of which are essentially political, one military, and the other economic. First, was Saladin a preeminent defender of Islam, or just another ambitious leader? Medieval and modern historians and biographers come down on both sides of the question—and each usually writes about Saladin through his or her chosen lens. Thus, some extol his character, his devotion to Islam and holy war, and, consequently, his ability to motivate men despite adversity. Others see him as a pretentious prince who manipulated Muslim symbols for his own ends and, at times, lost control of his army. In this book, we heed these studied views, but seek an interpretation based on what is known about Saladin from the historical record and modern scholarship. Second, how did Saladin manage his unwieldy empire that stretched from Egypt, Yemen, and Libya to northern Iraq, southern Anatolia, Syria, Palestine, and Lebanon? As he expanded his empire, Saladin used power and resources in various ways. In some provinces, he exerted direct control, notably in Egypt and Syria. In other broad regions, he brought lords and their lands under his suzerainty, but imposed only limited obligations on them, namely, to provide men and resources in time of war. However, to wage war against the Crusaders from 1187 through 1192, he had to constantly recall his coalition army despite its centrifugal tendencies 1\n\n2\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nand, at times, manifest tensions between Kurdish and Turkish amirs and soldiers. Thus, a subsidiary question is how did he maintain command and control, but also accommodate, when necessary, the fractious nature of his army? Third, how successful was Saladin at creating and directing an army that had to fight different kinds of military battles for decidedly dissimilar aims? Also, how and how effectively did he mix diplomatic and economic tools with the use of force? Against Muslim foes, his battles were in the field, on urban streets, and sieges. In these confrontations, for the most part, Saladin planned to bring his opponents into his realm, thus he usually wanted to limit casualties for political reasons. Facing Crusaders with their unfamiliar technologies and tactics, sieges and field battles were the rule. Saladin’s objective against the Crusaders, though, was total defeat to drive them from the Holy Land. Saladin’s military successes and failures must be analyzed and judged within the appropriate context of each, a principal goal of this study. Fourth, how did Saladin secure resources to wage war and build an empire and how well did he manage them? While economic data is sparse in the literature, material on tax farms, trade policy, benefits from imperial acquisitions, and Egyptian resources are available. Accordingly, this study describes and evaluates how Saladin contributed to the economic process, but also how he exploited—some say overexploited—his medieval economy, especially during times of war. In the pages that follow, I trace Saladin’s life and career from his early years in Syria in the 1140s and 1150s, the creation of his empire and the struggle against the Crusaders from the 1160s through the early 11190s, and his return to Damascus where he died in 1193. The portrait that emerges is that of a complex, humane but hardly sentimental warrior-king with both great talents and inherent flaws, one whose rightful place in history may be closer to conquerors who also built, like Alexander the Great or Napoleon Bonaparte, than to those like Genghis Khan, who merely conquered.\n\nNOTES ON EARLY ARABIC SOURCES Students of Saladin’s life and career are fortunate to have a relatively rich, but still not complete, literature on which to base their biographies and histories. This body of material is varied in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nquality and presents distinctively different perspectives on the nature of Saladin’s rule, which, in turn, is problematic, challenging, and valuable for historians, but also leads to conflicting interpretations of Saladin’s career. Imad al-Din al-Isfahani, Saladin’s long-time secretary, left two chronicles: Al-Barq al-Shami [Lightning of Syria] of which only part has survived and Al-Fath al-Qussi fi al-Fath al-Qudsi [The Eloquent Exposition on the Holy Conquest]. Together, they cover most of Saladin’s life and are both marked by Imad al-Din’s florid and verbose style. Baha al-Din Ibn Shaddad joined Saladin’s service as secretary and military judge (qadi) in 1188. Thus, though his chronicle briefly surveys Saladin’s early years, it is much more detailed and complete for the 1188–1193 period. Both Imad al-Din and Ibn Shaddad provide us with important information and insights on the life of Saladin, but by dint of their service with him, their volumes are recognizably sympathetic to their leader. Abu Ali Abd al-Rahim al-Fadil, known in most of the literature as Qadi al-Fadil, was a senior secretary and advisor to Saladin. While he did not write a chronicle, he did leave a rich correspondence. Many of the letters were drafted for Saladin, but others were personal. They are found in narrative histories written after Saladin’s death in 1193 and in various archives. Given his position as a senior aide and counselor, Qadi al-Fadil’s writings offer us unique material on the way Saladin was able to expand his empire and his relationship with the various key parties within it and the caliph in Baghdad. Ibn Abi Tayy, a Shia resident of Aleppo, wrote a chronicle that included rare information on Saladin’s early life. His tome did not survive. However, Shihab al-Din Abu Shama in his Al-Rawdatain fi Akhbar al-Dawlatain [The Two Gardens in the History of the Two Countries], written after 1193, preserved many noteworthy passages from the works of both Ibn Abi Tayy and Qadi al-Fadil. Another view is offered by Izz al-Din Ibn al-Athir, a famous historian of the Middle East, in his Al-Kamil al-Tarikh [The Perfect History], which covers the period from the creation through 1231. He was a partisan of the Zangid family of Mosul, which resented Saladin’s rise to power. While Ibn al-Athir presents us with important and valuable historical detail, his narrative, at times, reflects his political leanings, mixed with occasional grudging respect for Saladin’s accomplishments. Similar to Abu Shama,\n\n4\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nJamal al-Din Ibn Wasil wrote his chronicle, Mufarrij al-Kurub fi Akhbar Bani Ayyoub [The Relief of Anxieties Concerning the History of the Ayyubids], after Saladin had died. He repeats much of what Ibn al-Athir recorded about the life of Saladin, with a similar political orientation. In sum, the chroniclers and secretaries of the day preserved many details about and opinions on the way Saladin conducted his career and his achievements. This variety of viewpoints gives rise to controversy about the nature of Saladin’s rule, but makes it richer for the student of this medieval period.\n\nNOTES ON TRANSLITERATION AND TRANSLATION In the text and footnotes, I have used a simplified standard transliteration system without diacritical marks for Arabic names, places, and words. For common words, such as Beirut, Saladin, and Syria, I utilize the modern English spelling. Unless otherwise indicated, I translated the Arabic and French quotes and citations.\n\nCHAPTER ONE THE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME Islam, the third Abrahamic religion, emerged in Arabia in the seventh century, five centuries before Saladin was born. During this period, the religion gained believers and expanded first in the Middle East and Egypt, and then to the north and east in Anatolia, Central Asia, and India and to the west in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, enclaves in Mediterranean Europe, and West Africa. Parallel with this geographic spread of Islam was the movement of various ethnic groups. The Arabs, who disseminated the religion in the Middle East and North Africa, also brought their language and, over the years, the region gradually adopted and adapted the Arab culture. Neighboring ethnic groups, especially Turks and Persians who had converted to Islam, ruled large areas of the Middle East during the two centuries before Saladin started to form his empire. Ruling dynasties, too, rose and fell. Umayyad caliphs governed the Middle East and North Africa from Damascus for 100 years. The Abbasids, who subsequently took over the caliphate, ruled the same region from Baghdad for two centuries. Following the decline of the Abbasid Empire, various smaller dynasties such as the Buyids (Buwayhids), Hamdanids, Fatimids, Seljuk Turks, and Zangids gained control over more limited geographic areas. Saladin’s larger empire survived him for a few decades, but eventually fell to the Mamlukes and others. Effective central authority over most of the region was not restored until the Ottoman Turks established their empire from North Africa to Iraq and to the Balkans in the middle of the fifteenth century. The competition between Sunni and Shia Islam was another prominent feature of this dynamic historical period. The Umayyids 5\n\n6\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nand the Abbasids were Sunnis, but they were followed by the rise of the Shia dynasties: the Buyids who were the rulers of major parts of Persia (Iran) and Iraq, the Hamdanids who controlled most of northern Syria and Iraq, and the Fatimids who reigned in Egypt, North Africa, and, at times, parts of Syria. The Seljuk Turks, adherents of Sunni Islam, replaced the Buyids and the Hamdanids in the middle of the eleventh century and pushed the Fatimids out of most of Syria later in the same century. Saladin eliminated the latter’s Egyptian and North African empire in the twelfth century. The Christian Crusaders were still another new dimension of the Middle East mosaic of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Indigenous Christians had always been part of Middle East society. In addition, the Christian Byzantine Empire and Armenian states had long been neighbors with whom the various Muslim dynasties had both friendly and combative relationships. Unlike the Eastern Christians, the Crusaders came from western and northern Europe. In the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, they conquered an area that included parts of southern Anatolia, western Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Transjordan. Expanding on this brief historical summary, in the balance of this chapter we bring together in a little more detail the major religious, political, ethnic, and societal forces, norms, and practices that were current in the medieval Middle East. Hence, the focus is on: the spread of Islam; Sunni and Shia Islam; Shia rule in medieval times; Turkish ascendancy in the Middle East; state and society; ethnic and religious groupings; relations between Islam and Christian Europe; and the Crusades The literature on the history of the Middle East and medieval Islam from the seventh century through the twelfth centuries is very rich1 as is the material on the Crusader venture.2 This concise overview is based on these classical sources.\n\nThe bibliography at the end of the book lists extensive materials on the Middle East and medieval Islam. Of these, the most outstanding are: Hodgson, Venture of Islam; Lapidus, History of Islamic Societies; Hourani, History of the Arab Peoples; Fletcher, Cross and the Crescent; Lewis, Islam from the Prophet Muhammad to the Capture of Constantinople; Gibb, Mohammedanism; 1\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n7\n\nTHE SPREAD OF ISLAM Islam spread geographically as its early adherents—the Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula—conquered neighboring lands and as the conquered peoples gradually or, at times, precipitously adopted the new religion. Muslim traders and religious clerics also traveled to distant lands, especially Asia and Africa, where they preached Islam, converting individuals, tribes, and whole nations. During his life, the Prophet Muhammad along with his close followers preached Islam throughout Arabia, converting most of its leaders and tribes. Emanating from the Hijaz where Mecca and Medina (Map 1) are located, they reached Yemen, Oman, and the Persian Gulf and even made forays into the Byzantine Empire to the north. Following Muhammad’s death in 632, the leadership of both the religion and the growing temporal authority devolved onto the Companions of the Prophet: Abu Bakr (632–634), Umar ibn al-Khattab (634–644), Uthman ibn Affan (644–656), and Ali ibn Abi Talib (656–661) who was also the paternal cousin and sonin-law of the Prophet. The four Companions of the Prophet were early converts to Islam as well as strong and close supporters. On the passing of the Prophet, following broad deliberations involving numerous tribes and geographic regions, the leaders of the growing Muslim community successively chose them as its caliphs, successors of the Prophet Muhammad. During the three decades after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, the world witnessed a major geopolitical transformation as a result of the forces unleashed by the message of Islam. Under the guidance of these four caliphs, Muslim armies captured Syria, parts of southern Anatolia, and Egypt from the Gibb, Civilization of Islam; Hillenbrand, Crusades: Islamic Perspectives; Philip Hitti, History of the Arabs. 2 There are numerous tomes on the Crusades.

EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nChristian Byzantine Empire as well as Persia and the lands between the Black and Caspian Seas from the Zoroastrian Sasanian Empire. After the death of Caliph Ali in 661, the caliphate and the political and military authority passed successively to two great Arab Muslim dynasties, the Umayyads (661–750) and the Abbasids (749–1258). During the 90 years of Umayyad rule, based in Damascus, the Muslims extended their sway over additional territories in Egypt and Anatolia. To the East, the expansion was even greater. Muslim influence and rule reached lands in India up to the Indus River and far into Central Asia to the east of the Caspian Sea, including the historical trading cities of Samarkand and Bukhara on the Silk Road. As a caliphate dynasty, the Baghdad based Abbasids lasted from 749 to 1258. However, its political and military power largely disappeared by 945. Even though the family retained the religious authority of the caliphate, other families, tribes, and groups seized and exercised governing power and authority. During the Abbasids’ first 200 years, Islam continued to expand its religious and temporal reach, but not in the name of the Abbasids. Lesser families established their rule in North African lands to the west of Egypt: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. In addition, the Umayyad dynasty that had ruled the expanding Muslim Empire from Damascus, only to be replaced by the Abbasids, established itself in Spain in 756 where it and successor families ruled for several centuries. Christian forces eventually prevailed over Muslim rulers in the Iberian Peninsula, but it took 400 years before they finally expelled them in the fifteenth century. Even though the Christians began to push the Muslims back in Spain at the beginning of the second millennium, Islam continued to gain converts and lands in other continents. West African leaders and tribes started to adopt the religion in the eleventh century. In the 990s, the Seljuk Turks of Central Asia adopted Islam. Their influence on the direction of the Muslim religion was profound as they fought their way to power in the Middle East in the eleventh century. How and why did people from Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe adopt this new, expansive religion? During Prophet Muhammad’s life, he did not attempt to convert the Christians and Jews of the Arabian Peninsula. Rather, he considered them “Peoples of the Book” who practiced respected religions that were\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n9\n\nprecursors to Islam. For Muhammad, the Companions of the Prophet, and his other followers, the proselytizing goal of Islam was to bring the animist tribes of Arabia to the true faith. In like manner, as the Muslim Empire expanded, the caliphs extended “People of the Book” status to the Christians and Jews of the former Byzantine Empire in Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia and to the Zoroastrians who were prevalent in Persia and parts of Iraq. Over time, though, many—perhaps most—of the people in Muslim-controlled lands converted to Islam. Some did so out of religious conviction. To them, Islam was the new successor religion to Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism. It appeared to be the new revelation from God and had immediate and spiritual meaning for them. Others converted, at least partially, for material advantage. Muslims were subject to less taxation and had access to more jobs in the governmental, military, and religious structures. Thus, adopting the new religion was of direct benefit to them and their families. As time passed, a family’s former religion was forgotten or, at the least, lost meaning. Still others followed the actions of their tribal or national leader: if he converted, the whole tribe or nation converted. The leader himself may have converted for his own political reasons, out of spiritual conviction, or some combination of both. Despite this centuries-long process of conversion, large Christian, Jewish, and Zoroastrian communities retained a major presence and role within the Muslim Empire.\n\nSUNNI AND SHIA ISLAM The divergence between Sunni and Shia Islam began to develop in the early decades of the new religion. Initially, the issue between the two groups was largely political. Over a couple of centuries, however, the division grew in terms of theology, worldview, and ritual. This cleavage, though, should not be overemphasized. While there are certainly differences, there are also numerous fundamental similarities in belief and practices, namely: x Muslims submit to the will of God (Allah in Arabic). The very meaning of the word “Islam” is submission, and, as is clear in the Holy Quran (also Koran and Qur’an), the submission is to the will of God.\n\n10\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR x\n\nThe Holy Quran, the word of God, was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad by the archangel Gabriel. Its 114 suras were and are the source of Islamic law and religion. The Holy Quran is thus fundamental for all believers. x All Muslims are required to adhere to and practice the five “Pillars of Islam.” They are obligations for all believers. First is the paramount testimony (shahada) of faith: “There is no god but God, and Muhammad is the Prophet of God.” Second is the requirement to pray, using certain ritualistic phrases and postures of the body. Third is donating a portion of one’s income for public benefit, the giving of alms. Fourth is fasting from sunrise to sunset during the holy month of Ramadan. Fifth is to perform, once during a person’s lifetime, the pilgrimage to Mecca. x Another similarity shared by Sunnis and Shia is their reliance on the sunna—the authoritative example of the Prophet Muhammad—as a source for religious practice, law, and societal behavior. The life of the Prophet, by dint of his communication with God through the archangel Gabriel, is considered exemplary. His actions, examples, and words thus became a source for law and the ideal norms for Muslim society and governance. Even though the word Sunni, which is derived from the Arabic word sunna, is used to describe the Sunni community, the sunna is common to both Sunni and Shia Muslims. In summary, both Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims accept common religious attributes. Thus, when discussing Islam and Muslim society, it is incumbent to remember that the religious groups do share many fundamental similarities. Throughout history, tribal, ethnic, religious, and national groups have focused on their particular historical narratives. A group’s historical experience, as it understands it, helps structure the way that group sees itself as a community, but also how it sees itself in the larger society. Accordingly, Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims have their own histories that define who and what they are. The historical narrative in the previous section on the “Spread of Islam” is largely a Sunni narrative. The Umayyads and Abbasids\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n11\n\nwere Sunni dynasties. Thus, Sunni Islam was dominant, with some exceptions, during the first half-millennium after the revelation of the Quran to the Saladin era. During this period, Sunni Muslims developed practices, laws, and institutions that became part of the identity of the ruling Sunnis. The institution of the caliph was unique to them. The first four caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet, were considered legitimate and “rightly guided” in the religious sense of the words. The Umayyad caliphs were accepted as legitimate rulers, but the term “rightly guided” was reserved just for the Companions of the Prophet. It should be noted that while Muawiya, the first Umayyad caliph, was Caliph Uthman ibn Affan’s close relative, he was not a descendant of the Prophet’s immediate family, an important distinction in the Shia narrative below. Uthman and Muawiya were, though, from the Quraysh tribe, the tribe of the Prophet. Despite this issue of family origin, Sunni Muslims in their desire for unity and peace within the Muslim community, recognized Muawiya and his caliphate dynasty as legitimate rulers of the Muslim Empire. With the establishment of the dynasty of Abbasid caliphs, also considered legitimate by Sunni Muslims, we witness a reversion to descendants of the Prophet’s family and the meaning that entailed. The Abbasid caliphs, the first being Abdul-Jabbar al-Saffah, were descendants of al-Abbas, the brother of the Prophet’s father, Abdallah. Another important institution for Sunni Muslims was and is the Islamic body of law, the sharia. Muslim learned men developed four schools of law: Hanafi, Maliki, Shafii, and Hanbali. Named after legal scholars who first wrote for them, they include codification and interpretation. Initially there were strains and conflicts between and among the schools, but, over time, they were all recognized as legitimate Muslim institutions. Sharia goes well beyond what people in the West consider to be religious law. Rather, in addition to what Westerners may consider religious precepts, it includes laws on how believing Muslims are to conduct their lives and relate to each other in their community. In Western terms, sharia includes not only religious norms, but also civil, commercial, and criminal conduct and how infractions are to be treated. To interpret and apply the sharia, Islamic society developed a special group of trained individuals, the ulama (learned men).\n\n12\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nUlama were taught sharia and how to apply the laws in special schools called madrasas. They were deeply steeped in all aspects of Islam: the Quran, the life of the Prophet, the sunna, the sayings (hadith) of the Prophet, and the schools of law. From the ulama were chosen the qadis (judges) who administered the sharia in Islamic courts. The ulama kept the traditions and learning and passed them on to the next generation, whether the public, the judges, the religious personnel in the mosques, or younger men who were studying to be ulama. They were lawyers, scholars, clergymen, and professors—all part of one profession. Some ulama were also the tutors of the men who would be caliphs. Upon their accession to the caliphate, they were not only caliphs, but, in a sense, senior qadis. Along with these legal and structural trends in Islam, Sunni leaders, including the ulama and the caliphs, also accepted the Sufi (or esoteric) movements found in Muslim lands and integrated them into their overall thinking about religion. They too became part of the intellectual and popular traditions of Sunni Islam. Unity of Islam in a state of peace was the ideal, the goal of the community. However, this concept of unity certainly allowed for different approaches as it incorporated the four schools of law as well as Sufi thinking and traditions into the arena of what is legitimate and acceptable in Islamic society. The Shia Muslim historical narrative differs considerably from that of the Sunnis. The Shia unique experience, traditions, rituals, theology, and world outlook that are associated with their distinct history, defined the Shia Muslims as a distinct group, a distinctiveness that was important in medieval times. Upon the death of the Prophet Muhammad, Ali ibn Abi Talib, one his Companions, asserted that he, by right, should be the caliph. His claim was based on his being from the family of the Prophet, and that only descendants from the Prophet’s family were “rightly guided” to lead the Muslim community and interpret or explain Islam to the people. However, the larger Muslim community did not choose him; it chose Abu Bakr. After the death of the third caliph, all of whom were Companions of the Prophet, Ali was chosen as caliph. His caliphate was not without challenges, especially from Muawiya ibn Sufyan, a relative of an earlier caliph, Uthman. Muawiya, governor of Damascus at the time, initially did not accept Ali’s accession to the caliphate. After some\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n13\n\nconfrontation and negotiation, though, he did. However, upon Ali’s assassination at the hand of a disillusioned supporter, Muawiya claimed the caliphate, and as noted above, established the Umayyad dynasty. Hussein, one of Ali’s sons, with a group of kinsmen and supporters, sought to travel to Kufa in southern Iraq, where Ali had lived and eventually died. They wanted to assert their claim that only descendants of the Prophet’s family had the right, in a religious sense, to lead the Muslim community and expound on the meaning of the Quran. Yazid, the son of Muawiya and the second Umayyad caliph, dispatched an armed force that intercepted Hussein and his followers in Karbala in Iraq. In the ensuing battle on October 10, 680, Hussein and all of his supporters were killed. Over the years, Hussein assumed the role of martyr for Shia Muslims and Karbala became an important shrine and place of pilgrimage. Perhaps minor at the time, the battle of Karbala and the martyrdom of Hussein would become a watershed in Shia history. The historical narrative of the Shia Muslims became distinct. Rather than accept the legitimacy of the Sunni caliphs, they established their own successive religious and community leaders, the imams. In their version of history, Ali was the first imam. (The Shia reject the legitimacy of the other early caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, and Uthman. From a practical viewpoint, this stance may have been minor in substance, but it is major in symbolism.) The second imam is Hussein’s older brother, Hassan. The third is Hussein. The imam in Shia Islam was considered to be the sole authority who could interpret the Quran and Islam and, in this role, he was deemed infallible, that is he was incapable of error in matters of faith. He acquired these special attributes by dint of his being a direct descendant of the Prophet. In addition, the Shia did not accept the Sunni schools of law. Rather, they looked to the teaching of the imams in all matters relating to religion, society, commerce, treatment of criminals, and relationships among people. The Shia dynasty of imams lasted for about 100 or 200 years, depending on which imamate line a Shia follows. On the one hand, the sixth imam, Jafar al-Sadiq, had two sons: Ismail, the eldest, and Musa al-Kazim. Even though Ismail predeceased his father, his followers considered the son of Ismail, Muhammad al-Mahdi, to be\n\n14\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nthe true imam. Eventually, the followers of the descendants of Ismail would be known as Ismailis and have a major role in Middle East history. On the other hand, a larger number of Shia followed Musa alKazim and considered him and his descendants to be the true imams. The twelfth imam in this line, Muhammad al-Muntazar, disappeared in 874. His disappearance is considered an occultation, namely, the imam did not die and is hidden from view. Following this occultation, the Shia ulama accommodated the lack of an imam living with the community. Basing their writings on the words of the imams who lived before them, they developed a body of theological literature. A major tenant of this thinking was chiliastic. The hidden twelfth imam would return; life, as we know it, would end; and the imam, to be known as the Mahdi (the expected messiah), would establish the kingdom of God on earth, the ideal society. The Shia who looked to the twelfth imam, Muhammad alMuntazar, would become known as the “Twelver” (or “Imami”) Shia. A unique Shia institution was and is the commemoration, called the ashura, of the battle of Karbala and the martyrdom of Hussein in 680. In that it marks the historical event that is central in Shia history, the symbolism of this celebration is substantial. On this annual occasion, Shia Muslims wear special mourning clothes, imams give sermons marking the battle and Hussein’s death in the mosques, and the story is re-enacted in dramatic fashion in ceremonies on the streets. For them, at Hussein’s martyrdom, the course of history strayed from what God had intended. As discussed, Sunni and Shia Islam share many religious attributes. Nevertheless, shortly after the death of Ali, their paths diverged. The Sunnis had caliphs with both a temporal and religious role. Shia had imams, infallible religious leaders with no state power. The Sunnis developed their schools of law; the Shia looked to the imams for their body of law. Early Sunni history is centered on the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties; the Shia focused on the martyrdom of Hussein at Karbala and the religious role of the imams. While the profession of faith, prayer, alms giving, pilgrimage, and fasting during the month of Ramadan are common to both groups, the Shia added the ashura, a major ritual with great popular participation. In addition, the chiliastic view of the future world is unique to Shia thinking. While certainly of the same broad\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n15\n\nfaith, the two groups took different paths in their traditions, history, and worldview.\n\nTHE SHIA MOMENT IN MEDIEVAL TIMES Unique in the history of Islam, three Shia dynasties gained temporal control over large areas of the Middle East and North Africa in the tenth century. Heretofore, the Shia had not exercised state power and authority. Rather they had looked to their imams for religious guidance. Perhaps because they did not participate in government, they were considered to be in opposition to the establishment. Marginal societal groups, minorities, and some of those who opposed the Abbasids turned to them. Somewhat by chance, this political and religious process coalesced in the tenth century and three Shia families claimed governmental power. The weakest dynasty, the Hamdanids of northern Iraq and Syria, emerged first. In about 905, this Shia family rallied a number of bedouin tribes. These tribes joined the Hamdanids partly for religious reasons and partly for the benefits state power would give them. The Hamdanids held sway in the region, including the major provincial towns of Mosul and Aleppo, until about 1000. The second group was the Shia Buyid military family. Originating from around the Caspian Sea, they gained control of Persia by 934 and Iraq, including Baghdad, by 945. The Buyid dynasty did not try to replace the Abbasid caliph with its own Shia equivalent. Recognizing the new reality after the Buyids entered Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph formally acknowledged their temporal authority. The caliph, though, retained his religious role and he also received substantial income, which the Buyids authorized. During the Buyid stewardship, which lasted until 1040 in Persia and 1055 in Iraq, the regime did support Shia institutions: the Shia ulama, schools, and mosques. It essentially allowed the Shia intellectuals more support than they had enjoyed heretofore. Interestingly, the Buyids allowed, actually encouraged, intellectuals in general to explore new ideas, to speculate in new ways of thinking. From the standpoint of philosophical, legal, and religious thinking, it was a period of intellectual openness and positive ferment. It is important to emphasize that neither the Hamdanids nor the Buyids sought to eliminate or replace the Sunni Muslim caliphate. They saw themselves as commanders of the state. While\n\n16\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nthey protected and assisted Shia religious activities, they did not seek to create a Shia state in the sense that the Umayyads and the Abbasids had created a Sunni Muslim state. The Ismailis, the group of Shia Muslims who claimed descent from Ismail, the son of Jafar al-Sadiq, the sixth imam, were decidedly different. They were noted for being aggressive proselytizers, but they yearned for state power as well. One group, the Carmathians, rose up and created their own small state in eastern Arabia (about 890–1050). Another group of Ismailis, calling themselves Fatimids, would eventually control a large part of Muslim lands. One of the earliest Ismaili Fatimid leaders was Ubaydullah—a man who claimed descent, and thus legitimacy, from Caliph Ali and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad—who became ruler of Tunisia in 910. Using this base on the Mediterranean Sea, the Fatimids extended their control to Morocco and, by 969, they established themselves in Egypt. Eventually Western Arabia (Mecca, Medina, and Yemen) would fall under their suzerainty and, at times, they ruled parts of Syria. Centered in Egypt, they retained power and authority until Saladin removed them in 1171. Unlike the Buyids and Hamdanids, the Fatimids created a Shia state. Their leaders claimed the titles of both caliph and imam. Accordingly, they took both religious and administrative authority. This posture was a direct affront and challenge to the Sunni Muslim caliphate. It was not only an assertion of a different, competing, religious authority, but also a manifest division in the desired unity of Islam. This challenge gave rise to generations of struggle as the Sunnis attempted to eliminate Fatimid rule in the heart of the Muslim world. Control of Egypt was exceptionally important for the Fatimids. Egypt was rich in people, agriculture, and industry. It offered great wealth and opportunity to the leaders who commanded it and gave them resources to embark on adventures in Muslim lands and beyond. Interestingly, while the Ismaili version of Shia Islam became the state religion of the Fatimid Empire, the state authorities did not try to convert the population. Sunnis, Christians, and Jews were free to practice their religions. Remarkably for a Muslim state, several Christians became vizier (chief minister), including an Armenian Christian, Bahram, who\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n17\n\ninitially headed the Fatimid military and was later appointed vizier by the Fatimid caliph. The Shia had their moment in medieval history. In Iraq, Syria, and Persia, Shia rule lasted 100–150 years. In Egypt and neighboring territories, it lasted over 200 years. After the demise of the Fatimid Empire, Shia Muslims would not rule a state until the Safavids, under Shah Ismail, took control of Persia in the sixteenth century.\n\nTURKISH ASCENDANCY IN THE MIDDLE EAST For centuries, Asian nomads—Huns, Turks, and Mongols— emerged from Central Asia. At times, they possessed the power and skill to conquer and subdue neighboring lands: Europe, China, South Asia, and the Middle East. The most famous of these nomad leaders were Attila who led the Huns across Asia and into Central Europe in the fifth century and Genghis Khan who, with his Mongol hordes, captured Central Asia, China, and some European lands in the thirteenth century. Upon Genghis Khan’s orders, his grandson, Hulagu, invaded the Muslim Middle East, taking Persia and Iraq. In 1258, he captured and razed Baghdad and eliminated the Abbasid caliphate. Turkish nomadic tribes from north of Lake Balkhash in present day Kazakhstan began appearing on the borders of Muslim lands in the ninth century. The Turks and related Turkish groups known as Turkomans (also Turcomans and Turkmen) were animal herders; they followed their flocks and frequently sought new pasturage. Abbasid caliphs and later the Buyids and Hamdanids recruited them into their military service. Splendid equestrians, they were rugged and effective soldiers, as both cavalry and mounted archers. Some were inducted as mamlukes, slave soldiers who served an amir, atabeg, or sultan and who, at times, were manumitted, but remained in the service of their former owner. The majority of the Turkish peoples, though, maintained their pastoral life for centuries. In the tenth century, the Seljuk family ascended to the leadership of the Oghuz (also called Ghuzz in the historical literature) peoples, a large grouping of Turkish tribes. By the 990s, the Seljuks adopted Islam. During the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks carried the banner of Sunni Islam to all corners of the\n\n18\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nMiddle East, uniting major portions of the Muslim domain once again. In the third and fourth decades of the eleventh century, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Ghazanids of central Persia (Khurasan) who then came under their suzerainty. In 1055, Tughril Beg, the preeminent Seljuk leader, entered Baghdad and supplanted the weakening Buyid Shia dynasty. Caliph al-Qaim welcomed him almost as a liberator. Under Tughril—and the successor sultans, Alp-Arslan and Malik-Shah—the Seljuk Turks extended their rule to Syria where they confronted the Shia Fatamid dynasty, still based in Egypt. They also took the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hijaz and Yemen from the Fatimids. The frontiers of Islam were also extended. In mid eleventh century, Turkish pastoralists pushed into Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Anatolia, then under the Byzantine Empire. In 1071, the Seljuk Turks defeated the Byzantine army at Malazgirt (Manzikert) where they captured the Byzantine emperor and shortly thereafter magnanimously released him. This Seljuk victory was a disaster for the Byzantine Empire. It opened up large territories in Anatolia to migrating Turkish nomadic tribesmen. As they arrived, the Byzantine peasants left, withdrawing to regions around relatively secure towns. In broad sections of Anatolian lands, settled agriculture gave way to Turkish pastoralism. Based in Nicaea (today Iznik) and later Iconium (today Konya), they ruled what came to be known as the Sultanate of the Seljuks of Rum (derived from the Arabic word for Roman territory) for 200 years. The arrival of the Seljuk Turks constituted a sea change in the history of Islam. Sunni rule replaced Shia dominance in vast areas. The Buyid and the Hamdanid dynasties were eliminated and the Fatimids were pushed back. The stature of the Sunni Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad grew again. Retaining and asserting his religious role, the caliph welcomed the return of Sunnis to state rule. The caliph even bestowed on Toghril the title of Sultan of Dar al-Islam, the house (or lands) of Islam. Thus, the caliph bestowed legitimacy on the newly arrived Sunni Seljuk Turks, but also asserted his own role as the source of legitimacy. Lastly, as noted, an ideal in Islam had always been unity and peace in Muslim lands. As such, the caliph, the ulama, and many Muslims in general looked favorably on the Seljuks for the restoration of this ideal.\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n19\n\nThe unity was not to last. The nomadic nature of the Turkish tribes was inherently contradictory to central order. They moved frequently and looked to leaders they could see. At the death of Malik-Shah in 1092, the great Seljuk Empire split into three territories: Persia under Sultan Barkyaruq, the son of Malik-Shah; the Seljuks of Rum; and the sons—who were deemed atabegs (Turkish provincial and regional rulers), not sultans—of Tutish, another son of Malik-Shah who did not live to rule, in Aleppo and Damascus. In addition to these major Seljuk successors, a number of minor rulers established themselves in Muslim territories from Armenia and Diyar Bakr to Damascus and Azerbaijan. Of particular interest to the history of Saladin, is the family of Imad alDin Zangi Aq-Sinqor. Zangi, as he is commonly known, was the son of a Turkish military slave in Seljuk service. Successful and able as an officer, the Seljuks appointed him atabeg of Mosul in 1127 and he extended his territory to Aleppo in 1128. A religious man, he was popular with the ulama. In addition, he was the first Muslim leader to forcefully confront the Crusaders. In 1144, he captured Edessa, the most vulnerable of the four Crusader states. Upon his death, his sons divided his territories. Nur al-Din took Aleppo and Saif al-Din took Mosul. This minor dynasty became known as the Zangids. As we shall find, Nur al-Din played a major role vis-à-vis the Crusaders and it was in Nur al-Din’s service that Saladin rose to power.\n\nSTATE AND SOCIETY From the foregoing historical narrative, it is clear that, in the first centuries of Islam, the state took on different forms. At times, the state extended its power and authority far and wide. Also at times, such as during the first two centuries of Abbasid rule, the caliph was the senior leader in both the civil and religious sense. At times, though, the power of the strong, unified state deteriorated. In its place, several sultans as well as amirs and atabegs ruled separate realms. Although some amirs and atabegs were effectively independent, others answered to a more powerful sultan. This decidedly mixed and somewhat fluid system was the rule when Saladin was a young man. The basis for an amir’s or atabeg’s power was his standing military, his praetorian guard. He owned the monopoly of armed\n\n20\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nforce. With this power, the overall society expected him to defend the territory from external enemies and maintain internal order. Another of his functions was judicial. If the regular qadis who hailed from the ulama could not resolve an issue that disturbed the society, people turned to the sultan, amir, or atebeg for a judgment and a resolution to the problem, a court of last resort if you will. Families and individuals who lived in the near vicinity of the ruler availed themselves of his judicial judgments if they could gain access to him. The ruler recruited military personnel in a variety of ways. One was to buy or capture mamlukes and place them in his guard. The term mamluke cannot be equated with the institution of slavery, “the peculiar institution,” that was found in the United States before the Civil War. Mamlukes were indeed purchased or captured and could be sold. However, they held a variety of positions in service of the ruler: foot soldier, cavalryman, officer, general, and some were even elevated to the position of minister in the ruler’s court. A freed mamluke usually stayed in the citadel or court of his former owner. Another source of recruits was freemen who were paid to serve in the standing military. In times of conflict or threat of conflict, the ruler brought in more men. Through his subordinates or allies, he enrolled tribal horsemen and fighters who would expect either wages and/or booty in payment for their service. In medieval times, another unique and important institution that was both a resource for military men and revenue, was the iqta. The iqta is essentially the right to collect taxes or revenues, usually from productive land. The ruler granted iqtas to military (mamluke and free) officers, governors, amirs, and other individuals. They in turn collected taxes directly from peasants working the land or indirectly from agents who were managing the agricultural process. The person who received the iqta grant had two obligations: to provide soldiers to the ruler, on either a temporary or a permanent basis, and to provide a portion of the collected revenues to the ruler. Rulers typically did not give out iqtas on all of the lands they controlled. Namely, they reserved some of the lands and taxes therefrom for themselves. Some scholars equate the iqta system with the European feudal institution of medieval times. This is not the case. The grant of an iqta did not create mutual obligations between lord and\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n21\n\npeasant as in Europe. Furthermore, a ruler granted an iqta and he could revoke it. Iqtas could not be bought and sold, and were not heritable. In essence, the iqta was a mechanism through which the central power in the capital collected revenues and recruits from rural areas. It was both a fiscal and military tool, which drew resources from the villages to the benefit of the urban areas, including the ruling court, the ulama, merchants, Sufi leaders, and notable families. On occasion, especially in border regions of a ruler’s territories, iqta grants were abused. Fathers passed them to their sons and iqta holders sometimes treated the peasants as their personal serfs. This, however, was the exception, not the rule. While the primary role of the sultan, amir, or atabeg was to provide external and internal security, he did have other limited relationships with the people, especially in urban areas. For example, he used some of his revenues to build or repair mosques, schools, and special markets called khans as well as to endow religious foundations. Through such acts, he gained stature in the eyes of the ulama, merchants, and other urban groups. This role though was limited. The sultan was a political and military man. Other aspects of society—civil, economy, legal, and religion—were in the hands of others. The caliphate in Baghdad, until 1258 when Genghis Khan’s grandson Hugalu destroyed it, was another central institution in Muslim society. By the latter half of the tenth century, it had lost most of its political power. During the next 300 years, its role was primarily religious, but religious in a special sense that reflected the role of Islam in the overall society. The people and the ulama considered the Abbasid caliphs to be successors to the caliphs who were the “rightly guided” Companions of the Prophet. While not enjoying the “rightly guided” status, they did possess a religious aura. It was to them that the society turned for religious leadership and legitimacy. Only the caliph could bestow legitimacy on the temporal ruler. In the minds of the people, the sultan did not have authority on his own right. Rather, the caliph delegated the authority to the sultan. And the latter could only maintain it by upholding Islamic law. The caliph had a special duty to uphold the sharia, the fundamental rules by which Muslims live. He was integral to its interpretation and implementation in society. In this mission, some\n\n22\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nwere regarded as the senior qadi and respected as being from and part of the ulama. In Baghdad where he lived, the caliph was responsible for building mosques, schools, and khans, as well as funding religious endowments. Indeed, all leaders—caliphs, sultans, ulama, merchants, Sufi masters, and noted families—contributed to such public facilities and institutions. These individuals, their relatives, and their religious groups acquired prestige in the eyes of the society when they contributed to the public good. Family and tribe are fundamental social and political institutions in the Middle East. In medieval times, their roles and functions constantly touched everyday life. The family was not only a social unit that produced and nurtured children, but also it was an economic unit. Father, sons, often uncles, and cousins worked the same land or joined to practice the same craft in urban areas. The larger family was also a political unit. As a collective, it had a say in a village or a province. This solidarity was utilized vis-à-vis or in cooperation with other families to address and resolve problems—social, economic, and criminal. Equally as salient, a political leader looked primarily to his sons, brothers, uncles, and nephews as he sought allies, engaged in military expeditions, and ruled his territories. As we will see, Saladin certainly inherited this practice. His relatives were his first military lieutenants and governors as he established and expanded his empire. When his sons came of age, they too were assigned key leadership positions. The tribe is a larger unit than the family—indeed tribal membership reaches thousands or even hundreds of thousands— that claims, albeit the claim is in reality most likely fictive, that all members of the tribe are descendants of one man many generations ago. This claim gives the tribe a sense of mutual identity and solidarity. During the medieval era, members often worked together for certain ends that may at times have been political. They also defended each other in times of strife. Tribes, as noted earlier, moved together in search of new pastures for their flocks. They acted together, sometimes with strong leadership, but also sometimes solely out of a sense of common goals. While we usually think of tribes as nomadic, such as the Oghuz led by the Seljuk Turks or the great bedouin tribes of the Syrian and Arabian\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n23\n\ndeserts, tribes do settle and retain their tribal identity. Over time, their identity may dissipate, but the process may take centuries. Economy in the medieval Middle East was based on agriculture, urban crafts and manufacturing, mining, and trade. Agriculture as elsewhere is dependent on the availability of water and the fertility of the soil. Parts of the Middle East are blessed in agricultural terms, others are not. The famous Fertile Crescent—arcing from Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria next to or close to the Mediterranean littoral across Anatolia and northern Iraq, and descending along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers— deserves its name. The region usually receives sufficient rain for peasants to grow wheat, barley, and other crops. Where the rainfall diminishes in southern Iraq, irrigation water is available from its two great rivers, the Tigris and Euphrates. Egypt is the Nile River. Before the advent of major dams in the twentieth century, the annual flood brought silt and moisture, making the country a rich source of food, industrial crops, and revenue for its overlords. In these lands, peasants tilled the crops, often in financial and technical arrangements with urban merchants. The sultan (or other heads of government) taxed the land either directly or through the iqta system. Raising animals was always very important in an overall and balanced agricultural system. Peasants certainly kept some small domestic animals, foul, and sheep. Nomads, bedouin, and hill tribes, however, dominated animal husbandry. Not only did they produce sheep, goats, and camels for human consumption, but also camels and horses for trade and warfare. The tribes raised their animals in the more marginal areas, the lands and deserts that receive less moisture than the Fertile Crescent. Periodically they brought their sheep, goats, horses and camels to the suqs of Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Mosul, Baghdad, and other inland and coastal towns where they exchanged them for other necessities: grains, coffee, weapons, saddles, tools, and cloth. The relationship between desert and hill tribes, on the one hand, and peasants and urban dwellers, on the other, was based on commerce and was normally peaceful, a symbiotic consociation. At times, when one group tried to dominate the other, strife occurred. From another perspective, Middle East leaders relied on the tribes for troops, often mounted, in times of warfare. Given their occupation and familiarity with horses and camels, they excelled as cavalry and\n\n24\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nmounted archers. This skilled human resource was crucial for Saladin as he built his empire and confronted the Crusaders. Urban economy drew on resources from rural areas, crafts and manufacturing, and trade. Men of commerce were of the same class as the ulama. The latter staffed the religious schools attended by merchants’ children and led religious institutions. The families of the two groups intermarried. They both looked to the sultan or atebeg to maintain external and internal security. However, for the most part, they along with Sufi leaders and noted families managed urban affairs and business. Due to its location at the junction of three great continents (Asia, Europe, and Africa), the Middle East was a major crossroads. Trade routes flowed along the coasts—the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, both of which are linked to the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea—and up and down the major rivers: the Nile, Tigris, and Euphrates. Merchants and sailors utilized the riverine and sea routes for both domestic and international trade. Traders also followed land routes. The noble camel, the ship of the desert, moved goods to and from Central Asia and China along the famous Silk Road. Internally, land routes linked Iraq, Syria, Arabia, and Egypt, and yet, where possible, merchants transported bulk goods by boat on the seas or rivers. Trading patterns shifted upon occasion, usually due to security issues and fortunes of war. For example, as the Seljuk Turk Empire declined, unrest threatened trading caravans. In response, traders and merchants shifted the routes for their merchandise. Similarly, prior to the arrival of the Crusaders, the Fatimid navy and traders were ascendant in Mediterranean waters. As the Crusaders gained control over the Holy Land, the navies and merchants from Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and other Italian towns claimed the upper hand in the Mediterranean Sea. This new geopolitical reality disrupted traditional land and sea trade routes. Arrangements for Muslims to cross Crusader-held lands for the purposes of trade were frequently negotiated, but not always honored.\n\nETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS GROUPINGS Due to its geographical location and long history, a great variety of people in both the ethnic and religious sense inhabits the Middle East. By the twelfth century, people who resided in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and North Africa had become Arab or were in the process\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n25\n\nof being Arabized. They spoke Arabic, a Semitic language, in their daily affairs: commerce, learning, government. There were naturally differences among various Arab groups depending on geography, class, and life style. In addition, the Muslims looked to the common belief in the Quran and sharia, while Christians and Jews retained their distinctive holy books and communities. The people of Persia, on the other hand, retained their language, Farsi, and their rich culture. Islam as the religion of Persia gradually replaced Zoroastrianism and the ulama of Persia were proficient in classical Arabic, the language of the Quran. However, the language of the court and commerce was Farsi. Unlike Arabic, Farsi is an Indo-European language, a member of the same broad family as Latin, Greek, English, and French. Turkish peoples who migrated into the region brought still another tongue, but this time from the Turkic family of languages. During their first centuries in the Middle East, they were largely nomadic. Indeed, Turkish pastoralism replaced Byzantine settled agriculture in Anatolia. They also established great empires, that of the Seljuk Turks starting in the tenth century and that of the Ottomans founded in the thirteenth century. Turkish peoples lived and continue to live in Anatolia, northern Iraq, Azerbaijan, and northwestern Iran. Kurds are mountain people who lived and still live in eastern Anatolia, northern Iraq, and northwest Iran. Their language is closely related to Farsi and we know that they lived and fought in those mountains over two thousand years ago. Xenophon, the famous Greek general of the fourth century B.C.E., encountered them. Saladin’s family was of Kurdish heritage. During Fatimid times, the generals incorporated both mamluke and free Negroes and Berbers into their military corps. The Negroes came from the Sudan, notably Nubia (and thus are frequently termed Nubians in the literature), and the Berbers from North Africa. Over time, many adopted Islam and were freed. Some, especially the Nubians from the Sudan, not only became Muslims, but also were Arabized. Berbers followed two patterns: some adopted Arabic, but others kept using the Berber language in their communities. Christians lived throughout the Middle East. Many were Eastern Orthodox or Copts who had resided in the Christian Byzantine Empire in Syria, Iraq, and Egypt; others adhered to\n\n26\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nancient Christian sects that took their identities from some of the famous Christian schisms. In Egypt, the Coptic Church with its own pope, not related to Rome, oversaw the religion of the land when the Muslim Arabs arrived. Initially, most Egyptians retained and continued to speak the Coptic language. During the first centuries of Muslim rule, even though most Copts adopted Arabic, they kept their religion and Coptic liturgy. In the ninth century, Copts revolted against the Muslim overlords, were repressed, and many adopted Islam en masse. Significant Copt communities remained in the eastern delta and Upper Egypt. The Fatimids, the Ismaili Shia dynasty, did not make an effort to convert the Christians and, indeed, welcomed them as merchants, government servants, and peasants. To the south, the Nubian blacks also maintained their own Coptic religion for centuries. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, they began to convert to Islam in large numbers as they increasingly married into Arab bedouin tribes. In Syria and Iraq, large Christian communities, a legacy of Byzantine and even earlier times, enjoyed a significant presence in the towns and countryside. They were active in commerce, crafts, manufacturing, and agriculture, and occasionally they performed technical government functions. Most Christians were Eastern Orthodox; they adopted Arabic for daily life and commerce, but retained Greek in their religious services. Over the centuries, Christians, both as individuals and families, converted to Islam. During the twelfth century, Eastern Orthodox constituted certainly less than half of the population, and perhaps only 25 percent. Smaller Christian groups also lived in scattered locations. Syrian Orthodox communities resided in Iraq and Syria; Nestorian Christians, for the most part, lived in Iraq, especially Baghdad where they had a strong position in commerce and manufacturing. These groups spoke Arabic in the larger society, but utilized their ancient languages, Aramaic and Syriac, in their liturgies. Some spoke these languages in their villages. Still another group, the Maronites, lived mostly in the mountains of Lebanon. They practiced an Eastern rite, but during Crusader times, their church turned to Rome and accepted the authority of the pope. In the twelfth century, the Armenians lived in the regions around Lake Van in Eastern Anatolia and between the Black and\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n27\n\nCaspian Seas as well as in south central Anatolia on the Mediterranean Sea. The latter is called “Little” or “Lesser” Armenia. Their existence as a people goes back perhaps 3,000 years. Alexander the Great interacted with them. In 301, they accepted Christianity as their state religion, the first nation to do so. Armenian communities also lived in Egypt and Jerusalem during Saladin’s time. This ancient community has its own Armenian Orthodox Church and the liturgical language is Armenian. In mediaeval society, they were active in agriculture, commerce, crafts and manufacturing, finance, and occasionally government. Jews are also an ancient people of the Middle East. In the medieval period, they lived in most of the region’s cities, especially Baghdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Beirut, Cairo, and Alexandria. Many adopted Arabic as their language of society and commerce, but they kept Hebrew in their religious ceremonies and learned books. They, like the Christians, were active in trade, crafts, manufacturing, finance as well as medicine.\n\nISLAM AND CHRISTIAN EUROPE When people think about Christian-Muslim relations in Europe in the first five centuries of Islam, the focus is usually on confrontation and war. The dominant themes are the Muslims attacking and the Christians defending in Spain, France, Anatolia, and the Mediterranean Sea. As one probes the historical record in more depth, the unidimensional depiction gives way to a multidimensional picture. Indeed, there were many battles and the Muslims expanded their empire at the expense of the Christians, but also they had positive relationships and interacted in a number of fields: diplomacy, pilgrimage, technology and ideas, and trade. Muslims challenged Christian Europe in Asia Minor, Andalusia, France, and along the Mediterranean littoral. The first confrontation was with the Byzantine Empire, which, from its capital in Constantinople, controlled extensive territories stretching from European lands in Italy, the Balkans, and Greece to Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt. In the 670s and again in the 710s, the Muslims took their battle to the capital, which they besieged for years, but failed to capture. Even though Byzantine rulers realized some success against the Muslims in the following centuries, in 1071 the Seljuk Turks defeated them decisively at Malazgrit and opened the door to Turkish nomad migration. Within decades, the Byzantine\n\n28\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nemperors felt so threatened that they petitioned Western European Christians for assistance. (This call led to the Crusades, the subject of the next section of this chapter.) In the seventh and eighth centuries, the Muslims also directly pressed Christians in the West. By 718, Spain was in the hands of Muslim forces whence they crossed the Pyrenees and began to attack Frankish forces. However, in 732, Charles Martel, the great leader of the Franks, checked them at Poitiers after which they retired to the Iberian Peninsula. During subsequent centuries, Muslims gained occasional footholds in and around Italy. In addition, in the 900s, Muslim pirates and brigands frequently marauded the French and Italian coasts. Only in the eleventh century, were European leaders able to suppress these raids. Diplomatic exchanges and relationships also developed between the two sides. Famously, in 801, the great Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid sent Charlemagne an elephant, apparently in honor of Charlemagne’s coronation as emperor a year earlier. Europeans and Muslims frequently negotiated with each other for the return of prisoners of war and other hostages. However, there is no record of permanent ambassadors. Travelers at the behest of rulers served as diplomats of the day. Pilgrimage, while common to the two religions, was one-sided in terms of Muslim-Christian relations. Muslims undertook the hajj to Mecca, a religious journey solely within Muslim lands. On the other hand, Christians who wanted to travel to Jerusalem for religious worship, had to travel through Muslim territories to the Muslim held city until the Crusaders took it in 1099. To reach Jerusalem, pilgrims had to secure permission from the Muslim leaders who controlled the ports and travel routes. Indeed, local leaders gained a lucrative income from selling safe-conducts. In most years, pilgrimage was frequent and not fraught with difficulty. There are numerous European accounts of these religious trips, and the pilgrims’ adventures along the way. Over the generations and centuries, Muslims and European Christians also exchanged technology and ideas. Many of the works of antiquity, particularly Greek, were translated into Arabic. Muslim scholars, such as al-Kindi, al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), and Ibn Rush Averros, commented on these works and made their own significant additions in the fields of mathematics, logic, astronomy, medicine and pharmacology, and chemistry. In later years,\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n29\n\nEuropean thinkers and schools became familiar with this body of Muslim scholarship and utilized it as they gave birth to their Renaissance. In technology, the two societies also learned from each other and exchanged skills. Muslim caliphs and sultans imported Christian artisans and architects to help build and decorate grand buildings in Isfahan, Baghdad, Damascus, and Jerusalem. Muslims and Christians from all sides of the Mediterranean shared agricultural techniques and Muslims introduced improved papermaking methods to the Europeans. Technology of war always seems to cross borders with alacrity. Greek fire, an incendiary device used in naval and siege warfare, was known in ancient times, but fell out of favor as a weapon of choice in subsequent centuries. The Byzantines, however, rediscovered the weapon and used it with success against Muslim navies in the seventh and eighth centuries. A few decades later, Muslims acquired the technology from them. Both sides used Greek fire during the Crusader wars. Between the seventh and twelfth centuries, trade between the Muslims and European Christians grew, especially in the latter half of this period. In the earlier centuries, Europe was still retreating from the collapse of the Roman Empire. Economy, trade, and learning were all in decline. The more vibrant and growing Muslim Empire was interacting with a Europe that was at a historical nadir. Trade existed, but it was not flourishing. With the beginning of the tenth century and even more so in the eleventh, however, this pattern changed. Trade started to grow. Italian merchants in coastal cities—initially Amalfi, Naples, and Venice, followed by Pisa and Genoa—took the lead. Their counterparts were traders from Alexandria and Damietta in Egypt and the ports of Sidon, Acre, Ascalon, Tripoli, and Beirut on the eastern Mediterranean coast. Italian and Arab merchants landed goods at each other’s ports and returned with cargos desired at the other end of their journeys. Spices, ivory, cloth, and small implements were sold to Europeans in exchange for slaves, furs, timber, and occasionally, mercenary soldiers. Gold and silver were also always a part of the mercantile exchange. In aggregate, the relationship around the Mediterranean between Muslims and Christian Europeans was both conflictual and peaceful. Battles, conquering, and defending were the\n\n30\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\ncomplements of pilgrimage, diplomacy, trade, and exchange of technology and ideas.\n\nTHE CRUSADES Between 1098 and 1291, Christian Europeans established and maintained military, commercial, and religious colonies in the Middle East. Their geographic extent varied, depending on the fortunes of war. At their height, they controlled vast territories from southern Anatolia to the Red Sea, including Palestine, Lebanon, western Syria, Jerusalem, and lands east of the Dead Sea. Saladin spent part of his professional life confronting the Crusaders, eventually wresting ninety percent of their domain, including Jerusalem. That narrative is for subsequent chapters. Here we will explore the long-debated historical question: Why did the Europeans undertake the Crusades? Pilgrimage to Jerusalem and holy war against non-Christians were not uncommon during the millennium before the Crusaders conquered the eastern Mediterranean. The historical record tells us that Franks and Italians visited the holy city for religious purposes as far back as the fourth century. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, the numbers had grown. Not only parties of two or three individuals, but also groups of tens, hundreds, and occasionally thousands undertook this arduous journey. The record shows that they visited the Holy Sepulcher and other Christian religious sites. Their motivation was penitence; they were seeking forgiveness of sin. Moreover, because Jerusalem had assumed a numinous aura in the minds of commoner and noble alike, it was the unique and required destination for the pilgrims. For the most part, Muslims welcomed them. As discussed in previous sections of this chapter, Muslims considered Christians to be People of the Book and Christians, albeit Eastern Christians, and Muslims shared cities, towns, and villages in the Middle East. For Muslims, pilgrimage was also a source of revenue. Leaders sold safe-passages and merchants vended food, clothing, and animals. The Caliph Harun al-Rashid even invited Charlemagne to invest in Jerusalem, to enhance the Holy Sepulcher shrine. The pilgrims, despite the difficult journey, returned to their European homes with a renewed spirit gained from the visit to the holy city. A few pilgrims elected to remain and eventually die there.\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n31\n\nThis peaceful and religious exercise was severely disrupted in 1009 when the Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim, who was known for his strange behavior, destroyed the Holy Sepulcher. Within a short period, Christians rebuilt it. Pilgrimage, while temporarily slowed by this event, rebounded and even increased in magnitude. Indeed, pilgrims were visiting Jerusalem in ever-larger numbers during the very decade of the Crusades. Many Europeans who joined a Crusade simply viewed it as a large pilgrimage. Holy war was a familiar concept to Europeans and the papacy. In the ninth century, the earliest example we know, Pope Leo IV and Pope John VIII promised eternal life for fighters who died battling Muslims and Vikings. In the 1060s, 30 years before the Crusades, Pope Alexander II offered indulgences for those who fought Muslims in Spain. Frankish knights crossed the Pyrenees to join the battles. Their prizes were religious—forgiveness of sin— but also material, land and booty. In addition to the holy war in Spain as Christians sought to reconquer lands lost to Muslims in the eighth century, popes also encouraged Pisans to attack Tunisia in 1087 and Roger the Norman to invade Sicily in 1061, which was then under Muslim control. Holy war, in the eleventh century, was a known and acceptable practice, encouraged and blessed by the Church. It also had other attractive features, namely, political and material benefits. Political, economic, and social conditions in Christendom, both East and West, also laid the groundwork for the Crusades. As recounted, in 1071 the Byzantine Empire suffered a major defeat at Malazgrit. As nomadic Turks migrated into Anatolia, the Byzantine emperors lost their eastern hinterland. To fight their wars and guard long frontiers, the Byzantines had frequently recruited mercenaries. From the West, Franks, Normans, Englishmen, and Belgians joined the army. From the East, Byzantine generals recruited people from the Steppes as well as peasants from Anatolia. Thinking he might be able to rebuild his army and reconquer lost territories, Byzantine Emperor Alexius appealed to European leaders for additional mercenary troops. Inter alia, he sent emissaries to the Council of Piacenzce, called by Pope Urban II in March 1095, to present his case for additional men. Favorably received, they addressed the council. It must be underlined that the emperor was asking for mercenaries, that is, organized bodies of soldiers whom he would control, not an\n\n32\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nindependent Crusader army and rabble that had their own agendas. Urban II, though, adapted the Byzantine request to his own purposes. Western Europeans were restive in the tenth century. They had resources and energy for which they needed outlets. Feudal lords, especially Franks, frequently fought each other to gain land, people, and position. As populations grew, new lands in Europe were opened and settled. At times, the pope helped direct this energy toward Spain to battle Muslims rather than themselves, a papal motivation that would continue as the various popes called for the Crusades. Italian port cities were also expansive. Their reach and wealth were growing as they sought and gained new markets. The feudal lords and Italian merchants complemented each other with their respective political and mercantile interests. Due to the growth in population, feudal society in the tenth and eleventh centuries had to adapt. Observing that lordly lands were being divided into ever-smaller parcels, undermining their economic and political value, medieval nobility and other large landholders introduced the institution of primogeniture, which, by 1000, became quite common. This new system of inheritance worked, but it had consequences. The eldest son inherited his father’s land. Second sons, without resources, joined the clergy, others the military. As military units grew in size and number, they became increasingly aggressive. Knights and their soldiers and retainers wanted to exercise their profession, and reap the rewards. All of these eleventh century conditions—centuries of pilgrimage, a tradition of church sanctioned holy war, Byzantine demand for soldiers, restless feudal lords, ambitious merchants, and young men looking for battles—helped create a political, economic, and religious environment that was open to a new and dramatic call to duty. On November 27, 1095, Pope Urban II issued this call at the Council of Clermont in France. The speech, although not published, has come down to us in several versions. In compelling words and delivery, it contained a number of themes: an appeal for a holy war to free Eastern Christians from Muslim rule and depredation with special reference, albeit altered to his own purposes, to Emperor Alexius’ request for troops for his own struggle with the Muslims; the sacred need to retake Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulcher; and the religious requirement to liberate the\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n33\n\nEastern Church and bring it back to a united Christendom under the authority of the pope. Very importantly, the pope and the council made it very clear that those who volunteered for this noble cause would receive indulgences for their sins or, in other words, they would be freed of all church imposed penances for transgressions of divine law. The various elements of the speech were not new, but they were combined in a whole and powerful message and presented with the authority of the pope, in this instance Pope Urban II. Combining holy war, the spiritual meaning of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulcher, the threat to Christendom (depending on the listener, this could mean the need to liberate the church from its East-West division or from supposed ravaging by the Muslims), and the pilgrimage with its inherent relief from penance, constituted a compelling call to all classes in the society. The message was well received at the Council of Clermont and even more so as preachers delivered it broadly to the people. Nobles and commoners alike responded in large numbers. Did the average medieval man understand the subtleties and theological nuances in the pope’s words? Probably not. Indeed, many elements of the pope’s speech were certainly lost as the preachers talked about the necessity to reach Jerusalem. Did the peasants understand that they were to travel to the city of Jerusalem or the New Jerusalem that would relieve them of their misery? On reaching the numinous city, they may have thought that they would be in the presence of God and their lot in this world, or the next, would improve. From another perspective, Pope Urban’s call for a Crusade gave some people a religious justification for doing something they wanted to do for other reasons, whether they were political, economic, or social, or some combination thereof. For the Crusades to succeed for as long as they did, it can be argued, they required a combination of motives. Spirituality drove some people as they sought to better their lives in the eyes of God. Others sought booty, land, and profit. Drawing all of this together, the Crusaders began the long trek to Jerusalem. In the first of many waves, perhaps 100,000 knights, soldiers, retainers, and rabble, the latter led by Peter the Hermit, traveled overland through the Balkans and Anatolia to the Holy Land. During what became known as the First Crusade, 1097–1100, the\n\n34\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nCrusaders captured extensive territories where they set up four loosely confederated governments: x The Principality of Antioch composed of lands in both Anatolia and western Syria; x The County of Edessa in Anatolia which included the headwaters of the Euphrates River; x The County of Tripoli which included the coastal plain, part of Mount Lebanon, the Biqa Valley and the famous Crac des Chevaliers; x The crown jewel of the project, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which stretched from Beirut to Gaza and Jerusalem and down to the Red Sea. Headquartered in the Holy City, which the Crusaders had captured in a bloody massacre, its first king, Baldwin I, established the Crusader institutions that would last for decades. Initially, Muslim reaction to the Crusades was tepid. The Seljuk Turk Empire was in disarray and the Abbasid caliph, even if he had wanted to, could do little. Not until the middle of twelfth century did Muslim leaders actively confront the Crusaders. Zangi, the Turkish atabeg, recaptured Edessa in 1144 and, later in the century, his son, Nur al-Din, battled them in Syria and Egypt. Great success, though, awaited Saladin’s appearance on the historical scene. Looking at the Crusades from still another perspective, we must note that Europeans projected force towards the East on a number of fronts during this period. Prior to Pope Urban’s call, we know that Europeans were bold and forceful in political and mercantile terms. This aggressiveness assumed a military mien at the end of the eleventh century that lasted for hundreds of years. Frankish lords and Italian merchant states, at times working alone and at other times working together, took and held land on at least five occasions and locations: the Kingdom of Jerusalem and its federated states from 1098 to 1291, Cyprus from 1191 to 1571, Constantinople from 1204 to 1261, Athens from 1205 to 1458, and Peloponnesus from 1206 to 1420. In addition, the Kingdom of Jerusalem with its allies and, separately, the Normans of Sicily assaulted Egypt by sea or by land at least ten times during the twelfth century alone. The Crusades to the Holy Land, the first of the adventures, wedded economic and political motivations with\n\nTHE MIDDLE EAST IN SALADIN’S TIME\n\n35\n\nspirituality, penance, and indulgences. With respect to the other ventures, while some leaders asserted that bringing the Eastern Church back to the true Church based in Rome was paramount, in reality ambitious men were focused on economic and political gain. They were looking for land, trade, and revenues. Some would describe these men as the new European imperialists, the first rebirth of this spirit since the collapse of the Roman Empire.\n\nCHAPTER TWO THE EARLY YEARS: 1138–1164 Salah al-Din (referred to as Saladin in the West) Yusif bin Ayyub entered the world in 1138 in Takrit (Map 1), a town on the Tigris River north of Baghdad. His family, of Kurdish heritage, was from Dvin near Tiflis (now Tbilisi). At the time, that territory was part of Armenia. Some Kurds lived there, but larger numbers inhabited lands just to the south. The population in the entire area was in flux because Turkish nomadic tribes had started migrating into Anatolia, especially Eastern Anatolia where Armenia was, after the Seljuk success and Byzantine loss at the battle of Malazgrit in 1071. Saladin’s father, Najm al-Din Ayyub (Ayyub in the literature), and his younger brother, Asad al-Din Shirkuh (Shirkuh in the literature), joined the Seljuk government in 1130. Appointed by Sultan Muhammad ibn Malik-Shah, they actually answered to Bihruz, a powerful Seljuk official in Baghdad. Ayyub served as governor—an administrative and military position—of Takrit, an important crossing point on the Tigris River. Shirkuh also had a post in Takrit, but under his brother’s authority. Ayyub and Shirkuh were influential role models for Saladin. Ayyub’s strengths were diplomacy and administration, but also he was politically astute and knew how to look after his family’s interests in a tumultuous time. Furthermore, Ayyub was personally devout throughout his life, an attribute that Saladin would inherit. While Ayyub certainly had military talent, Shirkuh excelled in them. He could think tactically and strategically and he reportedly had great personal courage and martial skills, both of which he displayed in battle. Ayyub and Shirkuh were obviously ambitious, the former perhaps in a more calculating way, while the latter was at times more impetuous and willing to take greater risk. Saladin, who was close to both men at different stages in his life, learned 37\n\n38\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nfrom them by example and by being included in their activities in the diwan, the hunt, and the battlefield. To the west of Takrit, Zangi, an atebeg in Seljuk service and the first Muslim leader to confront the Crusaders, climbed to power in Mosul and Aleppo in 1127 and 1128. In 1132, this aggressive leader, thinking he could take advantage of the declining Seljuk Empire, led his troops to the outskirts of Baghdad where he intended to influence events in his favor. He failed. His military force defeated, he retreated towards Mosul. At Takrit, Zangi asked Ayyub for permission to cross the Tigris. For Ayyub, the request was problematic. His superior, Bihruz, had just defeated Zangi outside Baghdad and would not expect Ayyub to treat Zangi kindly. Nevertheless, Ayyub saw it in his interest to allow the ambitious Zangi to reach the other side of the river and proceed to his base in Mosul. Bihruz, not pleased with Ayyub’s action, did express his disapproval, but did not relieve him of his governorship. In 1138, however, the brothers’ fortune changed. Shirkuh killed a man, reportedly a Christian, in a private dispute. Bihruz, well known as a friend of the Christians, immediately dismissed Ayyub and Shirkuh and expelled them from Takrit. Remembering the favor they rendered to Zangi, they took their families, including the newly born Saladin, to Mosul where Zangi took them into his service. In 1139, Zangi, always seeking new lands, captured Baalbek (Map 4), then under the rule of the Burids, a Turkish dynasty based in Damascus. He appointed Ayyub governor of the town and the surrounding lands, a prosperous region in the fertile Biqa Valley between the Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountain ranges. The valley was famous for its plentiful production of wheat, barley, vegetables, fruits, and grapes. Saladin spent his early years, one to eight, in Baalbek. There is no record of his rearing in this period. His father, being a senior public official, no doubt afforded him the best education of the day. Like many sons of well-to-do families, he would have studied the Quran, Arabic grammar and writing, numbers, and rhetoric. Baalbek was sufficiently large and prosperous to have a small cadre of teachers for the children of the leading military, merchant, administrative, and religious families. At home, Saladin most likely spoke Kurdish, but Arabic was the language of his schooling and his friends in Baalbek.\n\nTHE EARLY YEARS: 1138–1164\n\n39\n\nIn 1146, when Saladin was eight, his family moved to Damascus for political reasons. In that year, Zangi was assassinated. His two sons, Saif al-Din and the younger Nur al-Din took Mosul and Aleppo respectfully. Given his concern for his older brother’s possible ambitions, Nur al-Din concentrated his attentions on securing his rule in Aleppo with the help of its military leader, Shirkuh, who had held the post in Zangi’s time. The Burid leader Mujir al-Din Abaq of Damascus took advantage of the opportunity to reclaim Baalbek. Ayyub, rather than enter a fight he knew he would lose, negotiated the town’s peaceful surrender in exchange for an iqta of ten villages around Damascus, a large house, and a position in service of the Burid government. Once again, we see Ayyub use his political skills for his and his family’s benefit. Within a short period, Mujir al-Din’s atabeg appointed Ayyub military commander in Damascus. For Saladin, Damascus must have been a very big change, affording broader opportunities than Baalbek. One of the grand cities of the Middle East, it was full of merchants, artisans, manufacturers, and well-educated ulama. Traders from around the world, Samarkand to Muslim Spain, traveled to the great oasis city. Bedouin from the Syrian and Arabian deserts came to trade and renew their supplies. Damascus was also a major starting point for the hajj to Mecca. One of the noted Arab travelers, Ibn Jubayr, records seeing many mosques, 20 madrasas, Eastern Orthodox churches, and thriving Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities. After six years in Damascus, Ayyub sent Saladin to Aleppo where his uncle, Shirkuh, resided. At this young age—he was 14 years old in 1152—Nur al-din awarded him his own iqta to cover his expenses. In one sense, this move seems curious. The Burids of Damascus were the enemies of Nur al-Din in Aleppo. However, in this case, it appears that family ties were more important than political differences and, as events will show, these ties proved to be politically very useful. During these years, according to noted Arab chroniclers, Saladin acquired in depth knowledge of Arab culture and history. He studied the biographies and genealogies of Arab leaders as well as their successes in battle. He also reportedly memorized the Hamasa by Abu Tammam. The Hamasa is a large compilation of famous Arab poems, collected in ten books. Not only are the poems beautiful, but also they present values, behavior, and modes\n\n40\n\nSALADIN. EMPIRE AND HOLY WAR\n\nof thinking valued by society, especially the bedouin tribes of ancient Arabia. Saladin fully participated in the hunt and sport. Hunting and playing polo gave him equestrian skills he would use for life. Also, during these formative years, like others of his family’s status, he started to learn the art of war and battle. Joining Shirkuh in Aleppo during his mid teens gave him ample opportunity to master military skills, tactics, and strategy. Later in his life, Saladin wrote that he rode and fought with Ayyub and Shirkuh early in his career. In his very late teens, Saladin became an aide to Nur al-Din. Working closely with him as his liaison officer to the military, Saladin acquired a third role model. Nur al-Din was known for his religiosity (like Ayyub), his devotion to the struggle against the Crusaders, his ambition to increase his political domain, his rigor in planning and execution of state and military decisions, his courage, his fairness, and his constancy to his word. Saladin recounted that in those years he was never far from Nur al-Din’s side “on the march or at court.” Nur al-Din loved to ride horses and would often join Saladin and his colleagues on the polo field. Hunting, hawking, and military exercises were part of the life when they were not on campaigns or at home. By the time he was about 30, Saladin married. His first son, alAfdal, was born in 1170. In all, Saladin eventually had a large family, including several wives and 16 sons. There is no record of his daughters. Like Muslim barons of the time, it was paramount for Saladin to have a large family. As a rule, medieval leaders relied on their sons as well as their brothers and uncles to fill high positions in their administrations. Loyal and able kinsmen were crucial to their rule. That being said, sultans, amirs, and atabegs always had to be wary of their relatives’ separate agendas and ambitions.1 Resources on Saladin’s early years are sparse. The most relevant are: Gibb, Life of Saladin, 4–5; Ehrenkreutz, Saladin, 25–33; Lyons and Jackson, Saladin, 2–6; Lane-Poole, Saladin, 65–76; (Lane-Poole’s material for most of this period is conjecture.)
