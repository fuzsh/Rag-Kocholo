Too often the student of European history gleans his knowledge of the oriental powers with which the West was brought into contact by the Crusades from western Christian writers, who do not fairly or truly describe those powers, and do not set forth clearly the strong and weak points which are so important in interpreting the actual forces with which the Crusaders were brought into contact. These pages are drawn from the Arabic and Persian historians so as to present a picture which, though inaccurate in some points, nevertheless shows the other side not perceived by the historians who wrote the narrative of the Crusades from a western standpoint. Directly, therefore, they supplement the western history, but are still more important in their indirect bearing as an effort has been made to show the rise and development of the Fatimid Khalifate and sect as a rival to the orthodox Abbasid Khalifate of Baghdad, which is most essential to the right understanding of the world into which the Crusaders penetrated, whilst at the same time it shows a curious and important phase of Muslim tendencies which are not without a bearing on the later history of Islam. The present essay does not claim to be an original study in a field hitherto unexplored, but simply aims at bringing together in an accessible form material which will be of service to the student of mediaeval western history and to those who are interested in the development of Islam, and to do so with such comments as will enable it to be co-ordinated with contemporary European history.\n\n[vi]\n\nCHAP.

The Prophet died in A.H. 11, and within the next ten years the Arabs, united under the leadership of his successors, extended their rule over Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Persia. To a large extent it was merely an accident that this rapid expansion of Arab rule was associated with the rise of Islam. The expanding movement had already commenced before the Prophetâs ministry, and was due to purely secular causes to the age long tendency of the Arabs,âas of every race at a similar stage of economic and social development,âto over-spread and plunder the cultured territories in their vicinity. The Arabs were nomadic dwellers in a comparatively unproductive area, and had been gradually pressed back into that area by the development of settled communities of cultivators in the better irrigated land upon its borders. These settled communities evolved an intensive agriculture, and thus achieved great wealth and an advanced state of civilization which was a perpetual temptation to the ruder nomads who, able to move over great distances with considerable rapidity, were always inclined to make plundering incursions into the territories of the prosperous agricultural and city states near at hand. The only restraint on these incursions was the military power of the settled communities which always had as [2] its first task the raising of a barrier against the wild men of the desert: whenever the dyke gave way, the flood poured out. In the seventh century A.D. the restraining powers were the Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Persia, and both of these, almost simultaneously, showed a sudden military collapse from which, in the natural course of events they would, no doubt, have recovered after a short interval; but the Arabs poured in at this moment of weakness, just as the Teutonic and other groups of central Europe had broken through the barriers of the western half of the Roman Empire; and at that moment, in the course of their incursion, they received a new coherence by the rise of the religion of Islam and, by the racial unity thus artificially produced, became more formidable.\n\nIn their outspread over Egypt and Western Asia the Arabs adopted the policy, partly deduced from the QurÊ¾an and partly based on the tradition of the first Khalifâs conduct in Arabia, of uncompromising warfare against all âpolytheists,ââthe creed of Islam was a pure unitarianism, and could contemplate no toleration of polytheism,âbut of accommodation with those possessed of the divine revelation, even in the imperfect and corrupt form known to Christians and Jews. These âPeople of the Bookâ were not pressed to embrace Islam, but might remain as tribute-paying subjects of the Muslim rulers, with their own rights very fully secured. In all the conquered lands the progress of the Muslim religion was very gradual, and in all of them Christian and Jewish communities have maintained an independent continuous existence to the present day. Yet for all this there were very many conversions to the religion of the ruling race, and these were so numerous that within the first century of the Hijra the Arabs themselves were in a numerical minority in the Church of Islam. The alien converts, socially and intellectually developed in the culture of the Hellenistic world or of semi-Hellenistic Persia, were very far in advance of the ruling Arabs who were little better than half savages at the commencement of their career of conquest: and the unexpected inclusion of this more cultured element acted as a leaven in the Islamic community, and forced it to a rapid and somewhat violent evolution. It is wonderful that Islam had [3] sufficient vigour and elasticity to be able to absorb such fresh elements and phases of thought, but that elasticity had its limits, and at a very early date sects began to form whose members the orthodox felt themselves unable to recognise as fellow Muslims.\n\nThese early sects which were generally regarded as heretical were, in most cases, reproductions of older pre-Islamic Persian and Mesopotamian religious systems, with a thin veneer of Muslim doctrine, and, in the second century of the Hijra, when they became most prominent, they were strongly tinctured with Hellenistic philosophical speculations which had already exercised a potent influence in Mesopotamia and Persia. In theory these sects were âlegitimistâ in their adherence to the principle of hereditary descent. Orthodox Islam accepted as a constitutional principle the leadership of an elected khalif or âsuccessor,â a natural development of the tribal chieftainship familiar to the pre-Islamic Arabs. Amongst them the chief was elected in a tribal council, in which great weight was given to the tried warriors and aged men of experience, but in which all had a voice, and choice was made on what we should describe as democratic lines, and this remained the practice in the earlier age of Islam. Such a constitutional theory was no great novelty to those who had lived under the Roman Empire, but was entirely repugnant to those educated in Persian ideas, and who had learned to regard the kingship as hereditary in the sense that the semi-divine kingly soul passed by transmigration at the death of one sovereign to the body of his divinely appointed successor. This had been the Persian belief with regard to the Sasanid kings, and the Persians fully accepted Yazdegird, the last of these, as a re-incarnation of the princes of the semi-mythical Kayani dynasty to which they attributed their racial origin and their culture. Yazdegird died in A.H. 31 (= A.D. 652), and his death terminated the male line of the Persian royal family, but it was generally believed that his daughter, Shahr-banu, was married to Husayn, the son of the fourth Khalif Ê¿Ali, so that in his descendants by this Persian princess the claims of Islam and of the ancient Persian deified kings were combined. Historically the evidence for this marriage [4] seems to be questionable, but it is commonly accepted as an article of faith by the Persian ShiÊ¿ites.\n\nAt a quite early date the house of Ê¿Ali began to receive the devoted adherence of the Persian converts. That Ê¿Ali himself had been prominent as a champion of the rights of alien converts to equality in the brotherhood of Islam, and still more his harsh treatment by MuÊ¿awiya, the founder of the Ê¿Umayyad dynasty, caused his name to serve as a rallying point for all those who were disaffected towards the official Khalifate. It is now the general ShiÊ¿ite belief that Ê¿Ali, the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet, was his chief companion and chosen successor, the three preceding Khalifs being no more than usurpers who had kept him out of his just rights, and whose wrong doing he had borne with exemplary patience. Ê¿Ali himself does not seem to have taken so pronounced a view, but he certainly regarded himself as injured by his exclusion from the Khalifate. It is not true to say with Muir (Caliphate, p. 301), that the idea of a divine Imamate or âleadershipâ was entirely the invention of later times because, as early as A.H. 32, in the reign of Ê¿Uthman, the Jewish convert Ê¿Abdu b. Saba of Yemen,âa district which had been conquered by the Persian king Nushirwan, and settled by Persians for nearly a century before the coming of Islam, and so thoroughly impregnated with Persian ideas,âpreached the divine right of Ê¿Ali. This view he maintained afterwards when Ê¿Ali was Khalif, in spite of Ê¿Aliâs own disapproval, and at Ê¿Aliâs murder in A.H. 40, he reiterated it in a more pronounced form: the martyred Khalifâs soul, he said, was in the clouds, his voice was heard in the thunder, his presence was revealed in the lightning: in due course he would descend to earth again, and meanwhile his spirit, a divine emanation, was passed on by re-birth to the imams his successors.\n\nCertainly the tragedy of Kerbela, which centred in the pathetic sufferings and death of Ê¿Aliâs son, Husayn, as he was on his way to claim the Khalifate, produced a tremendous wave of pro-Ê¿Alid feeling: indeed a popular martyr was the one thing needed to raise devotion to the house of Ê¿Ali to the level of an emotional religion, though many, no doubt, supported the Ê¿Alid claims simply because they formed the most convenient [5] pretext for opposing the official Khalifate, and yet remaining outwardly within the fold of Islam.\n\nAfter the death of Husayn there were three different lines of Ê¿Alids which competed for the allegiance of the legitimist faction, those descended from (i.) Hasan, and (ii.) Husayn, the two sons of Ê¿Ali by his wife Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, and both therefore representing the next of kin to the Prophet who left no son, and (iii.) the house of Muhammad, the son of Ê¿Ali, by another wife known as the Hanifite. Of these three we may disregard the descendants of (i.) Hasan, who ultimately migrated to Maghrab (Morocco), and became the progenitors of the Idrisid dynasty and of the Sharifs of Morocco: they formed a very moderate branch of the ShiÊ¿ite faction, adopted many practices of the orthodox or Sunni party, and had no part in the peculiarly Persian developments of the Asiatic ShiÊ¿ites. The first Ê¿Alid faction to become prominent was (iii.) the partisans of Muhammad, the son of the Hanifite, who were formed into a society by Kaysan, a freedman of Ê¿Ali, for the purpose of avenging Hasan and Husayn. They recognised a succession of four Imams or valid commanders, Ê¿Ali, Hasan, Husayn, and Muhammad, the son of the Hanifite, and maintained that, at Husaynâs death, Muhammad became de jure the Khalif and the divinely appointed head of the Church of Islam. Muhammad himself entirely disowned these partisans, but that was a detail to which they paid no attention. At Muhammadâs death in A.H. 81 this party, âthe Kaysanitesâ as they were called, recognised his son Abu Hashim as the fifth Imam until A.H. 98, when he died childless after bequeathing his claims to Muhammad b. Ê¿Ali b. Ê¿Abdullah (d. A.H. 126), who was not of the house of Ê¿Ali at all, and who became the founder of the Ê¿Abbasid dynasty which obtained the Khalifate in A.H. 132. It was under Abu Hashim that the party, now changed in name from Kaysanites to Hashimites, became an admirably organised conspiracy which contributed more than anything else to the overthrow of the Ê¿Umayyad Khalifs. Throughout the Muslim dominions there was deep and ever-increasing dissatisfaction with the Ê¿Umayyads, who represented an arrogant parvenu Arab aristocracy, ruling over races who enjoyed an older and richer [6] culture, and were by no means effete. The Hashimites seized hold of this discontent and sent out their missionaries (daÊ¿i, plur. duÊ¿at) in all directions disguised as merchants and pilgrims who relied upon private conversations and informal intercourse rather than public preaching, and thus began that unostentatious but effective propaganda, which has ever since been the chief missionary method of Islam. Hashimite teaching centered in the doctrines of tawakkuf or the theory of a divinely appointed Imam, who alone was the rightful Commander of the faithful and their authoritative teacher, of hulul or the incarnation of the Divine Spirit in the Imam, and of tenasukhu l-Arwah or the transmigration of that Spirit from each Imam to his valid successor, doctrines alien to Islam proper. With the death of the Abu Hashim this party passed over to the service of the Ê¿Abbasids to whom it was a source of great strength, and at their accession to the Khalifate it ceased to exist as a sect.\n\nThe most important sect, or group of sects, of the ShiÊ¿ites was (ii.) the faction which recognised Husayn as the third Imam, and his son, Ê¿Ali Zayn al-Abidin (d. 94 A.H.) as his successor, the son of the Imam and of the royal princess of Persia. But at al-Abidinâs death this party split into two, some following his son Zayd (d. 121), others his son Muhammad al-Bakir (d. 113). The former or Zaydite party established itself for a considerable period in North Persia, and still maintains itself in South Arabia. Zayd himself was the friend and pupil of the MuÊ¿tazilite or rationalist leader Wasil ibn Ê¿Ata, and the Zaydites have generally been regarded as more or less free thinkers. The majority of the ShiÊ¿ites, however, recognised Muhammad al-Bakir as the fifth Imam, and after his death JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq (d. 148) as the sixth, though here again there was a schism, some regarding Abu Mansur, another son of Muhammad al-Bakir, as the sixth Imam. Abu Mansur seems to have been one of the first Ê¿Alids to endorse the divine rights claimed for them by their followers, and did so in an extreme form, asserting that he had ascended to heaven and obtained supernatural illumination. At this time all the extremer ShiÊ¿ites regarded the Imam as an incarnation of the Divine Spirit passed on from Ê¿Ali, and many believed [7] that Ê¿Ali was the true prophet of God whose office had been fraudulently intercepted by Muhammad.\n\nThe Mansuris, however, were a minor sect, the majority of the ShiÊ¿ites followed JaÊ¿far who was Imam at the time of the Ê¿Abbasid revolution. He was one of those who were deeply influenced by the traditions of Hellenistic philosophy and science, and was the author of works on chemistry, augury, and omens: he is usually credited with being the founder, or at least the chief exponent, of what are known as batinite views, that is to say, the allegorical interpretation of the QurÊ¾an as having an esoteric meaning, which can only be learned from the Imam who is illuminated by divine wisdom, and who alone is able to reveal its true sense. The inner meaning thus revealed was usually a more or less imperfect reproduction of Aristotelian doctrine as it had been handed down by the Syriac writers. Like his brother, Abu Mansur JaÊ¿far fully endorsed the doctrine of a divine Imamate and the transmigration of the Divine Spirit, then tabernacled in himself, and it seems probable that Van Vloten (Recherches sur la domination arabe, 1894, pp. 44-45) is right in suggesting that the general promulgation of these beliefs amongst the ShiÊ¿ites was largely due to the labours of the Hashimite missionaries.\n\nThe contemporary establishment of the Ê¿Abbasids made a far-reaching change in the conditions of Islam. The Arabs began to take a secondary place, and Persian influences became predominant. In 135 the noble Persian family of the Barmecides began to furnish wazirs or Prime Ministers to the Khalifate, and controlled its policy for a period of fifty-four years. Nearly all important offices were given to Persians, and a distinct anti-Arab party was formed, known as the ShuÊ¿ubiyya, which produced a prolific controversial literature which expressed the hatred stored up under generations of Ê¿Umayyad misrule: the Arab was held up to derision, his pretensions to aristocratic descent were contrasted with the much more ancient genealogies of the Persian nobles, and he was portrayed as little better than an illiterate savage. In literature, in science, in Muslim jurisprudence and theology, and even in the scientific treatment of Arabic grammar, the Persians altogether surpassed the Arabs, so that we must be [8] careful not to talk of Arab philosophy, Arab science, etc., in the history of Muslim civilization, but always of Arabic philosophy, etc., remembering that it was not the science and philosophy of the Arabs, but that of the Arabic speaking people, amongst whom only a small minority were actually of Arab race: and this applies to the âgolden ageâ of Arabic literature (A.H. 132-232). On the other hand it must be remembered that, indirectly and unintentionally, the Ê¿Umayyads had helped towards this result. It was under their rule that the Arabic language had been introduced into the public administration, and in due course replaced Greek and Persian in all public business, so that it became the common speech of all Western Asia, or at least a common medium of intercourse between those who used various languages in their private life, and thus the brilliant intellectual and literary renascence was rendered possible by a wide exchange of thought.\n\nWe may rightly refer to this period as a renascence, for it meant quickening into new and other life the embers of the later Hellenistic culture, and especially of the Aristotelian philosophy and medical and natural science, which had never quite died away in Western Asia, but had been checked by its passage into Syriac-speaking and Persian-speaking communities, amongst whom the language in which the original authorities were written was only imperfectly known. Thus Hellenism suffered a phase of provincialism, which came to an end when Arabic appeared as a more or less cosmopolitan language, and thought began to be exchanged by different races and social groups. Under the early Ê¿Abbasids, and especially under the Khalif al-MaÊ¾mun (A.H. 198-218), there was a vast amount of translation from Greek into Arabic until the greater part of Aristotle, of the neo-Platonic commentators on Aristotle, of Galen, some parts of Plato, and other material, were freely accessible to the Muslim world: whilst at the same time translations were made from Indian writers on mathematics, medicine, and astronomy, some directly from the Sanskrit, and others from old Persian versions.\n\nAs a result the philosophical speculations of the Greeks began to act as a solvent upon Islamic theology, and from this doctrinal discussions and controversies [9] arose which, on the one side, produced a series of rationalistic heresies, and on the other side laid the foundations of an orthodox Muslim scholasticism. Long before this Hellenistic influences had permeated Persia and Mesopotamia, and these now revived and resulted in a philosophical presentation of religion which, under the veil of allegorical explanations of the QurÊ¾an, was really undermining orthodox doctrine, and heading towards either pantheism or simple agnosticism. With these tendencies the pro-Persian party was particularly associated. The Khalifs who, in spite of Arab birth, were most devoted to Persian ideas, largely because the Persians were subtle courtiers and were the champions of absolutism, were amongst those most ardent in promoting the study of Greek philosophy; and the Imams, such as JaÊ¿far and his brother Zayd, were even more devotedly attached to this type of philosophical speculation which was acting as a powerful solvent on the traditional beliefs of orthodox Islam.\n\nAt JaÊ¿farâs death another schism took place, indeed the perpetual sub-division into new sects has always been a salient characteristic of the ShiÊ¿iya. JaÊ¿far had nominated his son IsmaÊ¿il as his successor, but afterwards disinherited him because he had been found in a state of intoxication and chose as heir his second son, Musa al-Qazam. There were some, however, who still adhered to IsmaÊ¿il, and refused to admit that his father had power to transfer the divinely ordained succession at will; they asserted indeed that the sonâs drunkenness was itself a sign of his superior illumination as showing that he knew that the ritual laws of the QurÊ¾an were not to be taken literally, but had an esoteric meaning which did not appear on the surface. Musa, the seventh Imam as generally reckoned, and his son, Ê¿Ali ar-Rida (p. 202), the âtwo patient ones,â suffered harsh treatment at the hands of the contemporary Ê¿Abbasid rulers; they were brought from Madina by Harun ar-Rashid so as to be under the observation of the court, and in 148 Musa was poisoned by the wazir Ibn Khalid. His son Ê¿Ali married the daughter of the Khalif MaÊ¾mun, and was intended to be the heir to the throne. But MaÊ¾mun very nearly provoked civil war by his strong ShiÊ¿ite sympathies, and when he perceived [10] how dangerous a storm the projected accession of Ê¿Ali was beginning to arouse, he extricated himself from the difficulty by procuring the Imamâs death. Ê¿Ali al-Qazim was usually reckoned as the eighth Imam, the ninth was Muhammad al-Jawad (d. 220), the tenth Ê¿Ali al-Hadi (d. 254), and the eleventh al-Hasan (d. 260), these two latter being buried at Samarra, which replaced Baghdad as the Ê¿Abbasid capital from A.H. 222 to 279. The town afterwards fell into decay, but has been colonised by ShiÊ¿ites, and is one of the places of ShiÊ¿ite pilgrimage. The twelfth Imam was Muhammad al-Muntazir, who in A.H. 260 âdisappeared.â The mosque at Samarra is said to cover an underground vault into which he went and was no more seen. The âtwelvers,â or Ithna Ê¿ashariya, who to-day form the main body of the ShiÊ¿ites, and whose belief is the official religion of modern Persia, suppose that he is still living, and the place where he is to re-appear when he emerges from concealment is one of the sacred spots visited by the ShiÊ¿ites.\n\nBut, as we have already noted, some of the ShiÊ¿ites did not accept JaÊ¿farâs transference of the Imamate from his son IsmaÊ¿il to his second son Musa, but recognised IsmaÊ¿il still as heir. IsmaÊ¿il died in 145 whilst his father was still alive, leaving a son named Muhammad. Although IsmaÊ¿ilâs body was publicly shown before its burial at al-BakiÊ¿, many persisted in believing that he was not dead, and asserted that he had been seen in Basra after his supposed funeral; others admitted his death, but believed that his Imamate had passed to his son Muhammad; others again believed that his soul had migrated to Muhammad, so that they were in reality one person. These adherents of IsmaÊ¿il, or of his son Muhammad, or of IsmaÊ¿il-Muhammad, formed the sect known as the IsmaÊ¿ilians or the SabÊ¿iya, i.e., âseveners,â accepting the six Imams to JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, and adding his son or grandson as the seventh and last.\n\nThese âsevenersâ seem to have been a comparatively minor sect of the extremer ShiÊ¿ites. Some members of the sect are still to be found in the neighbourhood of Bombay and Surat. But, about 250 this comparatively obscure sect was taken in hand and organised by a singularly able leader, and became for a time one of the most powerful forces in Islam.\n\n[11]\n\nGENEALOGY OF THE FAMILY OF Ê¿ALI\n\n(1) Ê¿Ali d. 41. +-----------------------------+ | | marr.

H. 260.\n\nFrom the beginning the neo-IsmaÊ¿ilian sect showed all the characteristics of the ultra ShiÊ¿ite bodies: it accepted the Ê¿alim l-batin, or the principle of allegorical interpretation which is especially associated with JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, the doctrine of incarnation, and of the transmigration of the Imamâs soul. But underneath all this, borrowed from current ShiÊ¿ite ideas, it had a strong element of agnosticism, a heritage of the philosophical ideas borrowed from Greek scientists, and developed in certain directions by the MuÊ¿tazilites. As organised by its leader, whose name was Abdullah b. Maymun, it was arranged in seven grades to which members were admitted by successive initiations, and which diverged more and more from orthodox Islam until its final and highest stages were simply agnostic. According to Stanley Lane-Poole âin its inner essence ShiÊ¿ism, the religion of the Fatimids is not Mohammedanism at all. It merely took advantage of an old schism in Islam to graft upon it a totally new and largely political movementâ (Lane-Poole: Story of Cairo, Lond., 1906, p. 113). In this passage âShiÊ¿ismâ is taken as denoting the sect of the âSeveners,â and the âpolitical movementâ is simply disaffection towards the Khalifate. Similarly Prof. Nicholson considers that âFilled with a fierce contempt of the Arabs and with a free-thinkerâs contempt for Islam, Abdullah b. Maymun conceived the idea of a vast secret society which should be all things to all men, and which, by playing on the strongest passions and tempting the inmost weaknesses of human nature, should unite malcontents of every description in a conspiracy to overthrow the existing rÃ©gimeâ (Nicholson: Literary History of the Arabs, pp. 271-272).\n\n[13]\n\nUndoubtedly the ideas involved in the IsmaÊ¿ilian doctrines were totally subversive of the teachings of Islam, but so were those of the âphilosophers,â and in exactly the same way. The views of Ibn Tufayl (d. 531 A.H.) and of Ibn Rushd (Averroes, d. 595 A.H.) were purely Aristotelian in basis, and on this foundation was built up an agnostic-pantheistic superstructure. Ibn Tufayl particularly makes it quite clear that his teaching is not consistent with the QurÊ¾an which he treats as setting forth a system of doctrines and ritual precepts suitable for the unlearned who ought not to be disturbed in their simple faith, but quite inadequate for the satisfaction of the more intelligent: the mysteries of the universe, revealed through Aristotle and his followers, furnish a sounder religion, but it is expedient that this be reserved for the enlightened and not divulged to the illiterate who are unable to appreciate or understand its bearing. Such teaching is subversive of orthodox Islam, and consciously so: in the case of Ê¿Abdullah it may, perhaps, be described as a conspiracy against religion. In one sense it was the final product of the rationalism of the MuÊ¿tazilites.\n\nAdmittedly the IsmaÊ¿iliya worked as a political conspiracy against the Ê¿Abbasids, but this was true of every ShiÊ¿ite sect: the Ê¿Abbasids had used the ShiÊ¿ites in seating themselves on the throne, and then discarded them. Still it seems that we have no reason to question the perfect sincerity of the IsmaÊ¿ilians in their agnostic principles: those principles were the product of the solvent influence of Greek philosophy upon the religion of Islam: Islamic thought was too simple and primitive to be able to adapt itself to that philosophy in its entirety, hence some such position as that of Ibn Tufayl, or of Ibn Rushd, or of the IsmaÊ¿ilians, was inevitable. It was equally a necessary result of the time and circumstances that these rationalists tended towards the ShiÊ¿ites. In spite of weird superstitions, especially current in Khurasan, the ShiÊ¿ites represent the Muslim element most kindly disposed towards freedom of thought. This seems a bold statement to those familiar with ShiÊ¿ites of the present day, but it must be noted that the ShiÊ¿ites whom the European most frequently meets are either the devotees who have settled in places like Samarra, or those who seem to be more exclusive [14] than the orthodox Muslims, chiefly because they have as yet had much less intercourse with foreigners. In 2-3rd cent. Islam it was the ShiÊ¿ite princes who invariably did their best to foster philosophical and scientific research, whilst, after A.H. 232, the orthodox party, as it gets in the ascendent, becomes distinctly reactionary, and tends to repressive persecution.\n\nThe most difficult task for us is to appreciate the strong appeal which the doctrines of incarnation and transmigration made to the Persian and Mesopotamian mind. Both these doctrines had figured prominently in pre-Islamic religions in Western Asia; and both recur in most religious movements from the coming of Islam to the present day in that particular area. We may note a few instances to illustrate this, and show incidentally the strong attraction these doctrines had for the Persian mind.\n\nAbu Muslim was the general who more than any other helped to seat the Ê¿Abbasids on the throne, and suffered death at the hands of the first Ê¿Abbasid Khalif, who was jealous,âwith good cause, it would appear,âof his excessive power. But Abu Muslim had exercised an extraordinary influence over men during life, and was treated as a quasi-divine hero after death, his admirers regarding him as not really dead but as having passed into âconcealment,â some other having been miraculously substituted for him at the moment of execution. This resembles the theory which the pre-Islamic Persian teacher Mani held as to Christ. Mani fully accepted Christ as a religious teacher, side by side with Zoroaster and Buddha, but he could not admit the reality of his death, for a material body capable of death was in his view unworthy of one purely good. He supposed, therefore, that at the crucifixion Simon of Cyrene was at the last moment substituted for Christ, and this Persian idea has actually obtained a place in the QurÊ¾an (cf. Sura 4, 156).\n\nNot long after Abu Muslim we hear of a pseudo-prophet named Bih-afaridh, a Zoroastrian who had travelled in the far East, and afterwards accepted Islam at the hands of two duÊ¿at who were preaching the cult of Abu Muslim. Very little is known of his teaching, but he certainly maintained the doctrine that the Imam is an incarnation of the Deity, and seems to have [15] attached a particularly sacred signification to the numeral seven. This superstitious reverence for particular numbers was a common feature in the pre-Islamic religions of Mesopotamia, and we shall meet it again in the doctrines of the IsmaÊ¿ilians.\n\nAnother sect, of similarly pre-Islamic origin, was that known as the Rawandiyya from its origin at Rawand near Isfahan. Its members were king-worshippers in the old Persian sense, and a body of them travelled to Hashimiyya, where the Khalifs then had their residence, and tried to acclaim the Khalif al-Mansur as a god. He not only rejected the proffered adoration, but cast the leaders into prison. This was followed by an attempt to attack the palace, the Rawandis considering that, as the prince had disclaimed deity, he could be no valid ruler. For some centuries the sect, strongly disaffected towards the Khalifate, lingered on in Persia and had many sympathisers.\n\nUnder the next Khalif al-Mahdi, came the still more serious rebellion of al-MuqannaÊ¿, the âveiled prophet of Khurasan,â who asserted his own deity. He was killed in A.H. 169, but his followers, as usual, believed that he had not really suffered in person, but had passed into concealment and would in due course return again: they continued to form a distinct sect for some three hundred years.\n\nAnother pseudo-prophet of the same type was Babak al-Khurrami, who was executed in A.H. 222 or 223. He also declared himself to be an incarnation of the Divine Spirit, and asserted that the soul within him had already dwelt in his master Jawidan.\n\nWe might continue to extend the series very considerably by enumerating the various prophets and sects which reproduce these same general characteristics. The latest example occurs in the Babi movement, which still flourishes and has many converts in this country and in America. The first teacher of the Babists, Mirza Ê¿Ali Muhammad (A.D. 1820-1851) claimed only to be a Mahdi or fore-runner of One who was to come, but his successor, Mirza Husayn Ê¿Ali, declared himself to be the expected One, the incarnation of the Divine Spirit, which is an emanation of the Deity and is fairly equivalent to the Reason, Word, or Spirit of the Plotinian philosophy. In later times this doctrine [16] has rather fallen into the background, perhaps as the result of western influences, but the earlier phase shows a repetition of the traditional Persian position. All these sects show common matter in the doctrines of incarnation, of transmigration, and of an esoteric teaching to be revealed only to the elect. Such were the extremer ShiÊ¿ite sects of mediaeval times, and such are their descendants of modern times. Even in Persia to-day, side by side with the more orthodox âTwelversâ of the state church and off-shoots such as the Babists, the latest of a long series of mystical developments from the ShiÊ¿ite stock, are the Ê¿Ali Allahis who believe in the deity of the Imam Ê¿Ali, and combine with this belief many elements from the ancient Zoroastrian religion, a survival of the older mediaeval ShiÊ¿ism which caused so much trouble to the Khalifate of Baghdad.\n\nIn the teaching of most of the ShiÊ¿ites it is believed that some deceased Imam was an incarnation of deity, and it is he who, not really dead as men suppose, has passed into concealment, to return again in the fulness of time, when this evil age in which the true Khalifate no longer exists has passed away. Meanwhile there is no valid Khalif or Imam upon earth, but only some Shah or king who acts as vicegerent of the hidden Imam until his return.\n\nThis digression serves to show us how strongly Persian thought always has inclined towards the idea of a divine incarnation in the honoured religious teacher, and towards that of transmigration of the soul from one such teacher to his successor. In the 3rd century A.H. probably no sect which did not hold such theories could have obtained a favourable hearing amongst the Persians who found Islam of the Arab type unsatisfying, and every radical religious movement was necessarily compelled to assume at least the externals of ShiÊ¿ism.\n\nThe ShiÊ¿ite party organised by Ê¿Abdullah is known by various names. It is called IsmaÊ¿ilian as representing the party adhering to IsmaÊ¿il, the son of JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, and his son Muhammad, as against those who continued the succession of the Imamate through Musa; but the name is not strictly accurate as it seems that there was an IsmaÊ¿ilian sect proper existing before [17] Ê¿Abdullah, and that his re-organisation was so drastic that we may regard the continuity as being severed; and it seems certain that some part of the earlier sect continued to exist independent of his reforms. It was, no doubt, its attachment to a deceased or âhiddenâ Imam which made it a more promising field for the advocates of a speculative philosophy than any sect whose Imam was living and might dissociate himself from the doctrines held. It was also called the SabÊ¿iya or âSevenersâ because it accepted seven Imams, and also because it attached a sacred significance to the numeral seven; there were seven prophets, seven Imams, seven Mahdis, seven grades of initiation (afterwards changed to nine), etc. In many respects SabÊ¿iya is the most accurate name, but it is open to the same objection as IsmaÊ¿ilian. More commonly its members are called Fatimites as recognising Fatimid Imams who claimed descent from Ê¿Ali and Fatima: but this, although convenient because of its frequent use amongst mediaeval Arabic writers, is peculiarly inaccurate. The Ithna Ê¿ashariya or sect of âTwelversâ was equally Fatimite, and so were the Zaydites, indeed these last were the true Fatimites as holding that any person descended from Ê¿Ali and Fatima might be a valid Imam: but common usage allows the use of âFatimitesâ for the sect organised by Ê¿Abdullah. Another name is Batinites or advocates of an allegorical interpretation, but this also applies to other ShiÊ¿ite groups. Sometimes they are called Qarmatians, but this name is only applicable to one branch of the sect which originated in the district of Sawad between Basra and Kufa, and should be reserved for that branch which at a later period became alienated from the main IsmaÊ¿ilian body.\n\nThe new sect carried out its propaganda by means of missionaries (daÊ¿i) on the lines developed by the Hashimites. In this, as in most of its external features, it reproduces the characteristics usual amongst the mediaeval ShiÊ¿ites.\n\nThe organiser of the sect or masonic fraternity was Ê¿Abdullah, who is stated to have been the son of one Maymun. Sometimes Ê¿Abdullah is surnamed al-laddah (âthe oculistâ), as is done by Abu l-Feda, but more often this surname is given to his father Maymun. Maqrizi, referring to the Fatimids, says, âthis family [18] was traced to al-Husayn, the son of Ê¿Ali ibn Abi Talib, but men are divided in the matter between two opinions: some treat it as true, but others deny that they are descendants of the Prophet and treat them as pretenders descended from Daysan the Dualist, who has given his name to the Dualists, and (say) that Daysan had a son whose name was Maymun al-Qaddah, and that he had a sect of extreme views. And Maymun had a son Ê¿Abdullah, and Ê¿Abdullah was learned in all the canon law and customs and sectsâ (Maqrizi, i. 348).\n\nThe reference to âDaysan the Dualistâ is pure fable. This Daysan appears frequently in Arabic history as the legendary founder of the Zindiqs, a name given to the followers of the pre-Islamic cults of Mesopotamia and Persia, who found it convenient to make external profession of Islam. Thus MasÊ¿udi (Muruj adh-Dhahab, viii. 293) says that âmany heresies arose after the publication of the books of Mani, Ibn Daysan, and Marcion, translated from Persian and Pahlawi by Ê¿Abdullah ibn al-MuqaffaÊ¿ and others.â Ibn al-MuqaffaÊ¿ was a converted Zoroastrian who took a leading part in translating Persian and Syrian works into Arabic under the first two Ê¿Abbasids, and was generally regarded as privately adhering to his earlier religious views.\n\nIt will be noted that Zindiqism is mentioned as propagated by Ibn al-MuqaffaÊ¿, and is traced to Ibn Daysan amongst others, and this is precisely the same as the one whom Maqrizi names as the reputed progenitor of Maymun. Evidently the charge which lay at the bottom of this latter statement originally meant that Maymun was a Zindiq, and so could be described as a follower of Ibn Daysan, not that he actually was Ibn Daysanâs son, which would be an absurd anachronism. For the name Ibn Daysan refers to a perfectly genuine historical person: the Ibn Daysan of the Arabic writers was the Bar Daisan of Syriac literature, a convert from paganism to Christianity who died about A.D. 222, and whose followers formed an important sect at Edessa for several centuries, though in Muslim times he appears as a semi-legendary character. We possess a work probably written by one of his pupils called âA treatise on Fateâ in the Christian writers, from which two lengthy extracts appear in Eusebius: [19] Praep. Evangel. vi. 9, one of which is cited also in Clementine Recognitions ix., but is headed âBook of the Laws of Countriesâ in the Syriac text discovered by Cureton, and published by him in 1855. Various references are made to Bar Daisan in Euschius, Epiphanius, and other Church Fathers, as well as in the dialogues ascribed to Adamantius, but our best information as to his teaching is to be obtained from Moses bar Kepha (Patrol. Syr., I., ii. 513-5), whose summary is fully endorsed by the controversial essays of St. Ephraim, who settled at Edessa in 363 when the Bar-daisanites were a real force there. Bar Daisanâs doctrine, which is a kind of Christianized Zoroastrianism, is described by Prof. Burkitt in his introduction to Mitchellâs edition of St. Ephraimâs Prose Refutations.\n\nMarcion represents an earlier and more definitely Christian system which at one time had a very wide extension, and probably was the medium through which Bar Daisan learned Christianity. It was a kind of dualistic system with two powers, the Good God and the Evil One. The Evil One was the creator whom the Jews worshipped as God, and the Good God sent his Son on earth to save men from this delusion: as in Zoroastrianism the two rival powers maintain an unceasing strife until the day of judgment when the good God will be finally victorious. From St. Ephraim we learn that the Marcionites long retained their hold in Northern Mesopotamia side by side with the Bar-daisanites.\n\nMani shows very much these same views in a Zoroastrian setting, but with a strong element of Marcionite Christianity. Maniâs work came some twenty years later than Bar Daisan, and he, in his early days, had been a disciple of the Mandeans, the Gnostic sect which Justin Martyr calls âthe baptistsâ Î²Î±ÏÏÎ¹ÏÏÎ±Î¯ (Justin M. Dial. 80) from their frequent ablutions, who were settled in the marsh land between Basra and Wasit on the lower Euphrates. All three, Bar Daisan, Marcion, and Mani, draw largely from the same source the eclectic mixture of old Babylonian religion, of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Christianity, which developed in the lower Euphrates valley, though Marcion claimed to be, and no doubt believed [20] himself, an orthodox member of the Catholic Church, whilst Mani was no less confident in regarding himself as a Zoroastrian. The whole of the different religious ideas of the Euphrates valley were welded together by an element of Greek philosophy of the neo-Pythagorean type, which seems to have filtered in through the Jews who were settled there in force, and had shared in the common life of the Hellenistic world at the time when the neo-Pythagorean school was taking form, and showing marked sympathy towards the various forms of Eastern religious speculation. All this kind of eclectic speculation, half religious and half philosophical, lived on, and was still alive in the third cent. of the Hijra; indeed, it had spread and formed a new centre at Harran, quite distinct in its character, but obviously drawing from the same sources, and, moreover, it quickened into new life when the speculations of the neo-Platonic school were introduced through a Syriac medium. Traditionally all this type of thought prevalent in Mesopotamia was connected with the names of Marcion, Mani, and Bar Daisan, though probably very few Muslims had any clear idea of the respective parts these three characters had played, but simply cited them as heresiarchs of exceptional notoriety.\n\nBut Maymun was without doubt a real character. Abu l-Feda refers to him as a native of Qaraj or Ispahan, who professed to be a ShiÊ¿ite, but was really a Zindiq, i.e., a follower of the heresies of Marcion, Bar Daisan, and Mani, or else a materialist (Abu l-Feda, Annales Moslem., ii. 311). Used in this sense âmaterialistâ means an Aristotelian, i.e., one who believed in the eternity of matter and so did not accept the QurÊ¾anic teaching of creation ex nihilo. Ibn Khaldun states that Maymun migrated to Jerusalem with a number of his disciples and became well known as a magician, fortune teller, astrologist, and alchemist (cf. QuatremÃ¨re: Journ. Asiatique, Aug., 1836). The Fatimid advocates, as represented by the Druze writers, fully admit the descent of the Fatimids from Maymun, but claim that he was of the family of Ê¿Ali (cf. De Sacy: Chrestom., ii., note 3 on page 95), which seems as though Maymunâs position as an ancestor of Abdullahâs family was beyond question.\n\nIn the passage already quoted Maqrizi describes [21] Ê¿Abdullah as âlearned in all the canon law and customs and sects,â so that it seems that he, the fortune tellerâs son, was credited with being the original teacher and founder of the sect. Perhaps Maymun himself was the founder of a minor off-shoot of the IsmaÊ¿ilian body,âwe hear of followers who went with him to Jerusalem,âand Ê¿Abdullah succeeded him as head of this group but, himself a student of philosophy like so many other ShiÊ¿ites, and participating in rationalistic opinions, used his position to form a kind of free-masonry, in which he developed more fully the principles already indicated by JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, and so made the Aristotelian and neo-Platonic teaching somewhat modified in a Persian guise, the âhidden meaningâ of the QurÊ¾an. Probably he too was responsible for the efficient organizing of the sect, although its missionary propaganda was, as has been noted, reproduced from that of the Hashimites. He is said to have been the author of a book called al-Mizan, âthe balanceâ (Abulfeda: Ann. Mus., ii. 310). According to Nuwairi, who used the history of Abu l-Hasan b. Ê¿Ali Akhu-Muhsin, himself a descendant of IsmaÊ¿il b. JaÊ¿far and a contemporary of the chief activity of the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect, Ê¿Abdullah assumed ShiÊ¿ite views, not because he wanted to get men to recognise the Imamate of IsmaÊ¿il or his son Muhammad, but simply as a device to attract adherents: such was Akhu-Muhsinâs view, no doubt a prejudiced one, but of some weight as undoubtedly the judgment of many contemporaries. It is, however, quite as probable that the Ê¿Alid theories were derived from the existing sect of which Maymun had been head, and were left unaltered by his son when he took it in hand.\n\nIn order to make proselytes, Ê¿Abdullahâs missionaries used to propose obscure questions about the QurÊ¾an and the doctrines of traditional Islam, with the object of showing that as generally held these doctrines were contrary to reason, and so required an explanation. The revelation of Islam, they said, was difficult, and hence there was much diversity of opinion and many sects and schools of thought, all of which caused an infinite amount of disedification and much trouble. The reason of these diverse opinions is that each man follows his own private judgment and forms his own conjectures, [22] with the result that many end in utter unbelief. But God would not give a revelation full of such obscurity and ambiguity as the only guidance for men. It must be that there is some available guidance, some authoritative teacher who can explain the doctrine so that it may be both clear and certain, and such an infallible teacher implies an Imam. The daÊ¿i then gave illustrations of the obscurities and difficulties which men are not able to understand by the light of their own reason. The pilgrims at Mecca throw stones and run between the two hills, Safa and Merwa,âwhat is the purpose and meaning of this? Why is it that a woman who has omitted a fast and prayer because prevented by reasons of personal impurity is required to fast afterwards to make up for her omission, but is not required to make up for the omitted prayer? Why did God take six days to create the world when he could quite well have created it in an hour? What does the QurÊ¾an mean when he refers in a figurative manner to the âwayâ? What is the meaning of the reference to the two angels who write and take note?âwhy cannot we see them? What really are the torments of hell? What mean the words âand over them on that day eight shall bear up the throne of thy Lordâ? (Qur., 69, 17). What is Iblis?âWho are Yajuj and Majuj (Qur., 18, 93), and Harut and Marut (Qur., 2, 96)? Why have there been created seven heavens, and seven earths, and why are there seven verses in the Fatha? and many similar questions all designed to show that the QurÊ¾an is full of references to things which are not explained and need explaining, but to which the orthodox teachers are unable to give an explanation. All these are the conventional arguments which are commonly employed to prove that revelation is incomplete without an authorised teacher.\n\nThey then continued to ask other questions which throw a curious light on the kind of problems which interested the Muslims of the day, or which could be thought as deserving of attention. Why have men ten fingers and ten toes?âwhy are four fingers on each hand divided into three phalanges, whilst the thumbs have only two each?âwhy has the face seven openings?âwhy are there twelve dorsal vertebrae and seven cervical vertebrae? etc., constantly suggesting some [23] mystic meaning as lying under particular numbers. They cited âon earth are signs of men of firm belief, and also in your own selves; will ye not then consider them?â (Qur., 51, 20-21): âGod setteth forth these similitudes to men that haply they may reflectâ (Qur., 14, 30), and âwe will shew them our signs in (different) countries and among themselves, until it become plain to them that it is the truth.â\n\nThese suggestions produced doubt in the minds of many hearers, and gave the impression that the missionary had thought more deeply on the problems of religion than the ordinary teachers; and so the hearers were induced to ask the daÊ¿i to instruct them and reveal the answers to some of the problems he proposed. Forthwith he would begin a discourse dealing with some of these questions, and then suddenly check himself: the religion of God is too precious to be disclosed to those who are not worthy and who may, perhaps, treat it with contempt: God has always required a pledge of those to whom he has disclosed his mysteries. Thus we read, âAnd remember that we have entered into covenant with the prophets and with thee, and with Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary; and we formed with them a strict covenantâ (Qur., 33, 7), and again âsome there were among the faithful who made good what they had promised to Godâ (id., 23),ââO believers, be faithful to your engagementsâ (Qur., 5, 1),ââbe faithful in the covenant of God when ye have covenanted, and break not your oaths after ye have pledged them: for now ye have made God to stand surety for youâ (Qur., 16, 93), and many similar passages. âSo now,â the daÊ¿i said, âpledge yourself, putting your right hand in mine, and promise me with the most inviolable oaths and assurances that you will not betray our secret, that you will assist no-one against us, that you are laying no snare for us, that you will use the truth only in speaking with us, and that you will not join any of our enemies against us.â By this means they discovered how far the would-be proselyte was ready to be submissive and obedient, and accustomed him to act in absolute conformity with his superiors. If the proselyte readily took this pledge, the missionary next said, âGive us now an offering from your goods and first fruits which [24] shall be a preliminary to the disclosure which we are about to make to you of our doctrine, and a pledge which you will give for it.â By this they tested how far the proselyte was prepared to make sacrifices to join the sect, and how far he could be trusted to be a loyal and devoted member. Thus the proselyte was admitted to the First Grade which consisted of those who accepted the principle that the QurÊ¾an has both an external literal sense and an inner esoteric meaning which needs the help of an interpreter. The inner meaning was termed batin, or iman, âfaith,â as distinguished from the external islam, and this distinction was justified by the words of Qur. 40, 14. âThe Arabs of the desert say, âwe believe.â Say: âYe believe not, but rather say, âwe profess Islamâ; for the faith has not yet found its way into your hearts.ââ\n\nThe Second Grade. When the disciple had fully adopted the ideas taught in the first grade, and was convinced that men have fallen into error by accepting the traditional teachings of Islam, the daÊ¿i used the ordinary arguments to persuade them that there was need of an authoritative teacher, and without such a teacher men are unable to please God or obey His laws. Great stress was laid upon the unreliability of private judgment and the need of guidance and authoritative teaching.\n\nThird Grade. The daÊ¿i next proceeds to point who can be accepted as the desired teacher and infallible guide, the Imam of Islam. There have been seven such Imams, as worthy of reverence by their religious characters as by their number, for the most important things in the universe, such as the planets, the heavens (Qur. 2, 29; 67, 3), the earths (id. 65, 12, of Bukhari Sahih 59, 2) are invariably in sevens. He then enumerates the seven Imams, the first six being Ê¿Ali to JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, the seventh al-KaÊ¾im, âthe chief,â whom some understand to be JaÊ¿farâs son IsmaÊ¿il, others his grandson Muhammad, whilst others again regard these two as but one. He next endeavoured to show that the other ShiÊ¿ites, who regard Musa as the seventh Imam, cannot be correct as they do not limit the Imams to the sacred number seven, but continue until twelve are reckoned in all. He then was accustomed to speak against the character of Musa, the son [25] of JaÊ¿far, asserting that IsmaÊ¿il had deep knowledge of secret things, whilst Musa possessed no such supernatural enlightenment: he told anecdotes which placed Musa in an unfavourable light, and even attributed to him grave sins, so that it was impossible to regard him as the true Imam. Moreover it was agreed that, since Husayn, the Imamate can only be passed by direct succession, so it is not possible that it could be taken from one and given to his brother. The IsmaÊ¿ilians alone have inherited the accurate knowledge of secret mysteries bequeathed by JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq to his son IsmaÊ¿il.\n\nFourth Grade. In this grade instruction was given in the history of Godâs revelation. The age of the world is divided into seven stages, each under the guidance of a prophet whose teaching surpassed that of his predecessors and abrogated it. Between each pair there were but âsilentâ guides who did not add to nor alter the revelation of the prophet who inaugurated that age. Each of these seven prophets had a coadjutor who was his authorised exponent to mankind at large. These seven prophets and coadjutors wereâ\n\n(i.) Adam, with coadjutor Seth.\n\n(ii.) Noah, with coadjutor Shem.\n\n(iii.) Abraham, with coadjutor IsmaÊ¿il.\n\n(iv.) Moses, with coadjutor, at first Aaron, then Joshua.\n\n(v.) Jesus, with coadjutor Simon Sifa (Cephas).\n\n(vi.) Muhammad, with coadjutor Ê¿Ali.\n\n(vii.) al-KaÊ¾im, with coadjutor Ê¿Abdullah.\n\nThus the seventh prophet al-KaÊ¾im, i.e., IsmaÊ¿il or his son Muhammad, has abrogated the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad, and has given a new revelation. At this point, therefore, the convert was entirely separated from orthodox Islam which accepts Muhammad as the âseal of the prophets,â that is to say, the final completer of revelation, and was taught to regard his religion as obsolete.\n\nFifth Grade. In this grade it was taught that the traditional practices of the religion of Islam were merely temporary, a concession to the uninstructed multitude who could not yet understand the spiritual principles of iman: they were useful as an educative [26] influence with the ignorant, but the QurÊ¾anic precepts on which some of them were based had an esoteric meaning quite other than their literal form, whilst the traditional rules which had added so much detail to the laws of the QurÊ¾an were baseless and negligible. The disciple was taught to replace the external precepts of Islam by inner convictions. If he was a Persian he was reproached with the servile submission which the Persians had rendered to an Arab Khalif: if he were an Arab he was instructed that the privileges of the Arabs have now been transferred to the Persians. In addition to this he was taught certain principles of geometry and the properties of numbers, all applied in a mystical manner to the claims of the Imamate. He was further informed that each prophet had twelve hujjaj corresponding to the twelve signs of the zodiac, to the twelve months of the year, to the twelve tribes of Israel, and to the twelve nugabaÊ¾ whom Muhammad chose from the ansar or âhelpersâ at Madina. These numerals âsevenâ and âtwelveâ which have been shown to possess sacred meanings, were now cited to explain why men have twelve dorsal vertebrae, seven cervical vertebrae, etc. It is as well to note that when these teachings were first put forth the other ShiÊ¿ites who followed Musa and his successors had not yet made up the number of twelve Imams.\n\nSixth Grade. The missionary did not admit the postulant to this grade until he was perfectly assured as to his discretion and secrecy. In it the teaching that the ritual precepts of Islam as generally understood, were abrogated, was carried to its logical conclusion, and the convert was instructed to abandon the observance of prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, and all the other external practices of religion; or at least to observe them only in so far as they served as a bond of social usage or as expedient as a concession to their uninstructed companions. At the same time the teacher professed the utmost veneration for the men who had established these practices, and for the wisdom which had led them to do so. The daÊ¿i then described to his pupil the doctrines of Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, and other philosophers, and exhorted them not to follow the traditions of religion which have been passed down as mere hear-say, but to test them by the [27] methods of philosophy and to accept only those things which are endorsed by reason. Changing his former attitude, he then began to criticize the Imams unfavourably, and to contrast them with the philosophers to their disadvantage.\n\nSeventh Grade. Some of the missionaries were not themselves instructed in the doctrines of the highest grades, and only a select number were able to initiate converts into this seventh stage. This serves as the probable explanation of some events in the history of the sect which appear strange at first sight such, for example, as the estrangement of the most faithful and successful missionary Abu Ê¿Abdullah who, no doubt, revolted when he found the difference between the actual beliefs of the Mahdi Ê¿Ubayd allah, and the doctrine which he himself had learned and taught. In initiating a disciple into this highest grade the daÊ¿i first pointed out that there are in this world always correlatives, of which one is the cause, the other the result, as giver and recipient, teacher and taught, etc. Thus the QurÊ¾an tells us of God that âwhen he decreeth a thing he only saith âbeâ and it âisââ (Qur., 3, 42), in which God, the First Cause, is the greater, the thing created only derives its being from him: and again, âall things have we created after a fixed decreeâ (Qur., 54, 49), and again, âhe who is God in the heavens is God in earth alsoâ (Qur., 43, 84). Hence, following a teaching of the philosophers, it is clear that from a Being who is only One, only one thing can proceed: but the world contains many things, so it cannot be the work of the One, but needs at least two Beings. Moreover, creation is not the bringing into being that which did not previously exist, but only the arrangement and disposing of things. At bottom this was intended to be a statement of the Aristotelian doctrine of the eternity of matter, and shows striking resemblances with the speculations of the MuÊ¿tazilites. Thus Abu Hudhayl (d. circ. 226) held that before the creation the world existed, but in a state of perfect quiescence; creation was the introduction of change and movement, and this theory, in one modification or another, recurs in all the speculations of the later MuÊ¿tazilites. Very similar is the teaching of al-Farabi (d. 339), who was himself a [28] member of the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect, and held that the world proceeded from God in an instant of the immeasurable eternity which preceded time, but remained at rest until at creation God introduced movement and so produced time and change.\n\nSuch was the teaching of the seven grades which formed the original constitution of the sect. Later on two higher grades were added which, for the sake of completeness, we may consider here although they were no part of the original scheme.\n\nEighth Grade. In this the disciple learned that there are two Principles, the original and primary Cause, without name or attribute, the pre-existent (as-sabiq) who seems to be very much the same as âthe first Godâ of Plotinus, and a Second proceeding from this First Cause, due to a thought in the pre-existent, i.e., as an emanation, just as the spoken word proceeds from the thought in the mind of the speaker. Of the pre-existent nothing can be stated but what is negative. The âSecondâ seems to be very similar to the Reason or Active Intelligence as defined by the philosophers on the basis of Alexander of Aphrodisiasâ explanation of the teaching in Aristotleâs de Anima; not, as in the Zoroastrian system, a rival power, but an emanation which is an intermediary between the unknowable God and man. The true prophet, the daÊ¿i declared, is shown, not by working miracles which impress the vulgar, but by the establishment of political institutions which equip a stable and well disposed government, and by the teaching of spiritual doctrines which give an explanation of the phenomena of nature. Then, as Nuwairi and Maqrizi state, the QurÊ¾an, the resurrection, the end of the world, the last judgment, and such like doctrines of Islam are explained away as having allegorical meanings: according to the batinite doctrine, all these things signify only the revolutions of the planets and of the universe in regular rotation, or the production and destruction of things according to the arrangement and combination of elements, as explained in the teachings of the philosophers.\n\nNinth Grade. In this grade the disciple was taught the doctrines of the philosophers and what they have stated about the heavens, the stars, the soul, the intelligence, and other like things: in all he was made [29] grades which were a later addition were more definitely based on the teachings of the Greek philosophers which had been popularised in the Muslim world. At the same time the disciple learned that Abraham, Moses, and the other prophets were only founders of legal and social systems; they had received their learning from Plato, and the other philosophers who consequently are more important than the prophets commonly revered. He was especially taught to abhor the Arabs because they had been responsible for slaying Husayn, for which crime they were deprived of all rights to the Khalifate and Imamate, which were transferred to the Persians.\n\nMaqrizi says that the members of Ê¿Abdullah sect who attained to the highest grade became muÊ¿attil and ibahi (Maq. i. 348). Strictly speaking the former term denotes one who denies that the universe has a creator, and therefore implies that the initiated held the doctrine common to most of the Arabic âphilosophersâ of the eternity of matter. This teaching was one of the leading charges brought by the orthodox Muslims against Aristotle. The second term seems to mean âone who admits as (or makes) allowable,â and implies what would be described as antinomianism. Maqrizi continues that the initiated âdid not any longer recognize any moral law, nor expect either punishment or future rewardâ (id.). The historian Nuwayri gives the same account of the Qarmatian branch of the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect. Such antinomianism is not at all unknown amongst Muslim devotees: thus Maqrizi (ii. 432) in another passage refers to the Qalandariya darwishes as a type of Sufis who disregard fasting and prayer, and have no reluctance to use any form of self-indulgence, saying that it is sufficient that their hearts are at peace with God. These darwishes were of Persian origin and appeared in Syria in the 7th cent. A.H., but their order had its beginning in the 5th cent. Antinomian ideas appear with the later MurjiÊ¿ites of the 2nd cent., and are represented in the doctrines of Jahm b. Safwan, who was put to death about 131, and was, characteristically enough, a Persian convert in rebellion against the Arab Khalif. Amongst these MurjiÊ¿ites we find the doctrine to assume the system of those who believed in the [30] eternity of matter. Thus it will be seen the two highest taqiya or âconcealment,â which afterwards became common amongst the ShiÊ¿ites, the doctrine, namely, that profession of faith means only the confession of the soul to God, it being allowable that the true believer outwardly conforms to any religion.\n\nNuwayri also gives the form of contract proposed to a convert at the time of his initiation. This appears in two parts, to each of which the convert gives assent. They may be summarised thus:\n\n(1) A promise before God, and before his Apostle, his prophets, angels, and envoys, to inviolable secrecy as to all the convert knows about the missionary, about the representative of the Imam in the district where he lives, as well as regarding all other members of the sect. A pledge to accept all the orthodox teachings of Islam, and to observe all its rites, both matters which, as we have seen, were required of the lower grades and disregarded by the higher ones.\n\n(2) A pledge to loyalty towards the missionaries and the Imam, and the invocation of the curse of Iblis if this pledge is broken. âIf you have any reservation, in will or thought, this oath nevertheless has full binding force upon you, and God will take no satisfaction other than the complete fulfilment of all it contains and of the agreements made between you and me.â\n\nThis oath, it will be observed, is intended for those initiated into the first grade, and so conforms to the idea of orthodox Islam, though including the ShiÊ¿ite doctrine of an Imam, but covers all that is to be taught later with a veil of secrecy. The plan was to adapt the earlier teaching to the beliefs and capacity of the proselytes, and this method is further illustrated by the kitab as-siyasa or âbook of policy,â a manual for the guidance of the duÊ¿at, which Nuwayri describes on the authority of Abu l-Hasan.\n\nAccording to this the teacher is told to emphasize his zeal for ShiÊ¿ite theories if he has to deal with a ShiÊ¿ite, to express sympathy with Ê¿Ali and his two sons, and repugnance towards the Arabs who put them to death. If he has to deal with a Sabian, emphasis was laid on the reverence paid to the numeral seven. If his conversation was with a Zoroastrian, his principles are at [31] the basis very similar to those of the IsmaÊ¿ilians, and with him the daÊ¿i may commence at the fourth grade. If his business is with a Jew, he should explain that the Mahdi Muhammad b. IsmaÊ¿il is the Messiah expected by the Jews and speak much against the Muslims and Christians, especially about their erroneous beliefs as to the unique birth of Christ, making it plain that Joseph the carpenter was undoubtedly his father. With Christians, on the contrary, it is advised to speak ill of the Muslims and Jews, explaining that the IsmaÊ¿ilians recognise the Christian creed, but giving it an allegorical interpretation, and showing that the Paraclete is yet to come, and is the true Imam to whom they are invited to come. In dealing with dualists or Manichaeans the daÊ¿i may begin at the sixth grade of initiation, or if the convert seems worthy of confidence, the whole doctrine may be revealed at once. With one of the âphilosophersâ who, in true Muslim fashion, are treated as a distinct sect, emphasis is to be laid on the fact that the essential points of the IsmaÊ¿ilian faith are based on the teachings of philosophy, and the sect agrees with them in everything concerning the prophets and the eternity of the world; but some of the philosophers differ from the IsmaÊ¿ilians in admitting a Being who rules the world, though confessing that he is unknown. With âdualists,â i.e., Muslims of the sect so called (cf. De Sacy: Druses, p. lxviii., note 3), victory is sure; it is only necessary to dwell on the doctrine of the pre-existing and the second. With orthodox Sunnis the missionary is to speak with respect of the early Khalifs, avoid eulogies upon Ê¿Ali and his sons, even mentioning some things about them which call for disapproval: great pains should be taken to secure Sunni adherents as they form most useful defenders. When dealing with a ShiÊ¿ite who accepts Musa, the son of JaÊ¿far, and his descendants, great care is necessary: the daÊ¿i should dwell on the moral laws of Islam, but explain the sacred associations of the number seven. With some it is impossible to venture further and show that the religion of Muhammad is now abrogated, with others it is possible even to show that the ritual laws of the QurÊ¾an are obsolete, with a few he may proceed to admit that the KaÊ¾im is really dead, that he comes [32] back to the world only in a spiritual manner, and explain allegorically the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. Each is to be dealt with according to his beliefs, and care must be taken not to offend his religious prejudices. The daÊ¿i is advised to study the history of ancient legislators, their adventures, systems and sects, so as to have a fund of illustration which will arrest the attention of their pupils.\n\nSuch was the system formed by Ê¿Abdullah, probably somewhere before A.H. 250, and by him grafted on the already existing sect of ShiÊ¿ites, which upheld the claims of IsmaÊ¿il, the son of JaÊ¿far. In the reign of MaÊ¾mun (A.H. 198-218) Ê¿Abdullah had joined the revolt of Ishaq b. Ibrahim at Karkh and Ispahan, and formed a close friendship with the wealthy Muhammad b. Husayn b. Jihan-Bakhtar ad-Didan, a Persian prominent for his intense hatred of the Arabs, and it was he who first supplied Ê¿Abdullah with funds to begin his propaganda (cf. QuatremÃ¨re in Journ. Asiat., Aug., 1836). It is not easy to form any clear scheme of the chronology of the sect in its early days, nor to follow the details of its history: conspiracies and secret societies do not leave much in the way of documentary evidence of their first formation. That Ê¿Abdullah was associated with a rebellion in the reign of MaÊ¾mun is hardly likely; it seems rather that Muhammad b. Husayn ad-Didan (Dandan, or Zaydan) was so associated, and he afterwards befriended Ê¿Abdullah. This Muhammad was secretary to Ahmad ibn Ê¿Abdu l-Ê¿Aziz ibn Abi Dolaf, who became prince of Karaj in A.H. 265. No doubt Ê¿Abdullah was a younger contemporary, assisted by the old anti-Arab agitator. Certainly Ê¿Abdullah was established at Basra, whither he had removed from Persia, before 261 (Fihrist, 187), lodging there with the family of Ê¿Agil ibn Abi Talib. Thence he went to Syria, presumably finding suspicion aroused at Basra, and made his headquarters at Salamiya in the territory of Emessa (Maq. i., 348-9: ii., 11), and from there sent out missionaries who preached the claims of Muhammad b. IsmaÊ¿il b. JaÊ¿far as the âconcealedâ Imam, and of Ê¿Abdullah himself as the Mahdi or âguide,â who was to prepare men for the Imamâs return to earth (Maq. i., 348). At Salamiya he had a son named Ahmad, and when he died Ahmad succeeded him as head of the sect.\n\n[33]\n\nAhmad, like his father, sent out missionaries, and one of these was instrumental in founding the important branch known as the Qarmatians, a branch so important and prominent that some, e.g., Jamal ad-Din, have regarded the IsmaÊ¿ilians as their off-shoot. The fact seems to be that there were at first members of one body, then circumstances gave the Qarmatians a political opening in Syria and Ê¿Iraq, and, in a position of independence, they developed their doctrines more openly than the rest of the sect and, being drawn from the peasant class, these assumed a grosser form: whilst the other or parent community found a career in Africa but, as they became there a ruling minority with a subject majority of orthodox type, they were induced to observe some semblance of orthodoxy.\n\nÊ¿Abdullah was succeeded as head of the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect by his son Ahmad. According to the Fihrist he was succeeded first by his son Muhammad, then by a second son Ahmad, the latter being also described as the son of Muhammad, and so grandson of Ê¿Abdullah (Fihrist, p. 137). This Ahmad may be the one who was at Basra for some time, then at Kufa, whence in 266 or thereabouts he sent missionaries to Yemen; possibly he was the Ahmad al-Qaiyal who wrote a book on the Imamate, which was refuted by Razi (d. 320).\n\nAfter Ahmad came his son Husayn, who died not long afterwards, leaving a son named SaÊ¿id, who subsequently took the name of Ê¿Ubayd Allah, and was the Mahdi who established the Fatimid State in North Africa, dying in A.H. 323 (= A.D. 934). That he was originally called SaÊ¿id is generally admitted, but he appears variously as SaÊ¿id son of Husayn son of Ahmad, and SaÊ¿id son of Ahmad, and SaÊ¿id son of Abu Shalaghlagh. The explanation given for these different names is that Ahmad had two sons, of whom the elder, Husayn, died whilst SaÊ¿id was still young, and the son was adopted by his uncle Muhammad, the second son of Ahmad, who was also known as Abu Shalaghlagh.\n\nThere is a story that SaÊ¿id or Ê¿Ubayd Allah was the son of an obscure Jewish smith, whose widow was married to Husayn, son of Ahmad, and that he was adopted by his step-father. This is one of the three forms of what we may call the âJewish legend,â the [34] attempt to trace the Fatimid dynasty to a Jewish source. These three attempts are: (i.) that Maymun b. Daysan the oculist was a Jew; (ii.) that Ê¿Ubayd Allah was really the son of a Jewish smith; and (iii.) that he was killed in prison at Sijilmassa, and afterwards personated by a Jewish slave. Probably the âJewish legendâ was associated with the fact that the renegade Jew, Ibn Killis, was the one who encouraged the Fatimids to invade Egypt and did most to organise their government there, and with the undoubted favouritism which the early Fatimids showed the Jews.\n\nA new development in the teaching of the sect took place under Husayn, or possibly commenced under his father Ahmad. Ê¿Abdullah had been content to describe himself as the âMahdiâ or guide, who was to lead men to the Imam, who was IsmaÊ¿il, or his son Muhammad; he made no claim to be himself a descendant of the Imam. Probably it was a later theory that the Imam was âconcealedâ only in the sense that he had to hide himself from the Ê¿Abbasid Khalif. Later still, when a Fatimid Khalif was actually ruling in Cairo, the claim to descent from Ê¿Ali through Ê¿Abdullah and his family became a matter of heated controversy.\n\nHistorians differ very much as to how far the Fatimids succeeded in proving their Ê¿Alid descent, and contemporary opinion was quite as varied. Abu l-Hasan Muhammad Masawi, commonly known as Radi, born at Baghdad in 359 and dying in 406, was himself an undoubted descendant of Husayn the son of Ê¿Ali, and was official keeper of the records of Ê¿Alid genealogy. As Abu l-Feda notes (Ann. Mosl., ii. 309) he, in one of his poems, fully admits the legitimate descent of the Fatimids of Egypt from Ê¿Ali, and the actual passage is extant (cf. Diwan of Radi, Beirut, p. 972): but in 402 this same Radi joined with other Ê¿Alids and certain canonists in a proclamation denouncing the Fatimids and declaring their claimed genealogy as baseless. It is natural to suppose that in this he was actuated by fear or complaisance, and this difficulty meets us throughout; the whole question was so much a matter of current political controversy that it was practically impossible to get anything like an unbiassed opinion. Maqrizi, the leading Egyptian [35] authority of a later age, was strongly pro-Fatimid, but he claims the noble rank of sayyid on the ground of descent from Ê¿Ali through the Fatimids, and so is prejudiced in their favour. He argues that the Ê¿Alid descent of the Fatimids was never attacked by the acknowledged Ê¿Alids who then existed in considerable numbers (Maq. i., 349), an argument which is far from being true.\n\nElsewhere Maqrizi defends the Fatimid claims by saying that the Ê¿Alids were always suspected by the Ê¿Abbasid Khalifs, and so âthey had no resort but to conceal themselves and were scarcely known, so that Muhammad b. IsmaÊ¿il, the Imam ancestor of Ê¿Ubayd Allah, was called the âconcealedââ (Maq. i., 349). But this tells the other way: it admits that the Ê¿Alid genealogy was not well known: and the mere fact that Ê¿Abdullah was sought for by the Khalif simply shows that his pretensions were known to be dangerous, as a Mahdi with a body of followers would necessarily be, and is no proof of the validity of the descent afterwards claimed by Ê¿Abdullahâs descendants. The obscurity of the Ê¿Alid genealogy afterwards favoured the Fatimid claims, but it does not seem that that claim was part of their original programme. The first idea was to support the claims of the vanished Imam, claims selected in all probability because of the convenient fact that he had vanished, and to represent Ê¿Abdullah and his descendants simply as Mahdis, viceroys to guide and direct the people of Islam until the day came for the concealed Imam to be revealed again.\n\nAfter the Fatimid claims had been laid before the world the Ê¿Abbasids brought forward many calumnies (Maq. i., 349). The strongly anti-Fatimid Ibn Khallikan relates a story that when the first Fatimid Khalif to enter Egypt, al-MoÊ¿izz, came to Cairo, the jurist, Abu Muhammad ibn Tabataba, came to meet him, supported by a number of undoubted members of Ê¿Aliâs family, and asked to see his credentials. Al-MoÊ¿izz then drew his sword and cried, âHere is my pedigreeâ: and scattering gold amongst the by-standers added, âAnd this is my proof.â The story is an improbable legend, and even Ibn Khallikan rejects it on the ground that when al-MoÊ¿izz entered [36] Cairo, Abu Muhammad the jurist (d. 348) had been many years in his grave (Ibn Khall. iii., 366).\n\nThe weakest part of the Fatimid claim, as we have remarked, lies in the great diversity of forms the claim takes in different writers. When Ê¿Ubayd Allah or SaÊ¿id, Ê¿Abdullahâs great-grandson, established himself in Africa, the genealogy began to call for serious attention, and came to be examined, not by uncritical members of the sect, but by all the historians and genealogists of the Muslim world. It then appeared in no less than nine divergent forms.\n\n(1) Traced through JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq the sixth Imam, then through his son IsmaÊ¿il, his son Muhammad âthe concealed,â then JaÊ¿far al-MusaddiqâMuhammad al-Habibâand then Ê¿Ubayd Allah. Thus Maqrizi and Ibn Khaldun. According to this Ê¿Abdullah and Ahmad do not appear in the descent at all.\n\n(2) Traced through JaÊ¿far to Muhammad âthe concealedâ as in the preceding, then Ê¿Abdullah ar-Rida (the accepted of God),âAhmad al-Wafi (the perfect),âal-Husayn at-Taki (the pious),âand Ê¿Ubayd Allah the Mahdi. This appears in Ibn Khallikan and Ibn Khaldun, and seems to have been more or less the official version. According to this Ê¿Abdullah, the father of Ahmad, was the son of Mohammad âthe concealed,â not of Maymun. Similarly the pro-Fatimid author of the Dastur al-Munajjimin (MS. of M. Schefer, cited by de Goeje, Qarmates, pp. 8-9), who says that Muhammad b. IsmaÊ¿il took refuge in India; he had six sons, JaÊ¿far, IsmaÊ¿il, Ahmad, Husayn, Ê¿Ali, and Ê¿Abdu r-Rahman, but does not mention Ê¿Abdullah nor say which of these sons was the Imam: he then refers to the three âmysterious onesâ as succeeding Muhammad. Tabari (iii., 2218, 12) says that Muhammad b. IsmaÊ¿il had no son named Ê¿Abdullah.\n\n(3) As before, but Maymun as son of Muhammad âthe concealed,â then Ê¿AbdullahâMuhammadâUbayd Allah; thus in Abu l-Feda. Maymun is made the son of the seventh Imam (which is impossible), and the Mahdi is represented as Ê¿Abdullahâs grandson (see below).\n\n(4) IsmaÊ¿il, son of JaÊ¿far,âMuhammad âthe concealed,ââIsmaÊ¿il,âAhmad,âUbayd Allah. This also occurs in Abu l-Feda, and in Ê¿Ubayd Allahâs [37] âGenealogy of the Ê¿Alidsâ (MS. Leiden, 686âcited by de Goeje, Qarmates, p. 9) Muhammad had three sons, IsmaÊ¿il II, JaÊ¿far, and Yahya; IsmaÊ¿il had a son named Ahmad, who dwelt in the Maghrab.\n\n(5) IsmaÊ¿ilâMuhammad âthe concealed,ââIsmaÊ¿il II,âMuhammad,âAhmad,âÊ¿Abdullah,âMuhammad,âHusayn,âAhmad or Ê¿Abdullah,âUbayd Allah the Mahdi. This is the genealogy given in the sacred books of the Druses, and rests on the theory that there must have been seven âconcealed Imamsâ intervening between JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq and the Mahdi. It is merely an instance of the mystic value attached to the sacred numeral. Like (3) it gives Muhammad for Ahmad which is a permissible variant.\n\n(6) The five preceding genealogies are distinctively IsmaÊ¿ilian in character, but there are others which show adaptations of the âTwelversâ accounts, and these cannot be much more than later attempts to connect the Fatimid line with that recognised by the other ShiÊ¿ites. First we have the idea that the descent from JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq was through Musa, not IsmaÊ¿il, then following the next three Imams Ê¿Ali ar-RidaâMuhammad al-JawadâÊ¿Ali al-Hadi (see above)âal-Hasan al-AskariâUbayd Allah the Mahdi. According to this the Fatimite Mahdi in Africa was the son of the eleventh Imam of the âTwelvers,â and thus replaced Muhammad al-Muntazar.\n\n(7) The same line as the preceding, but admitting Muhammad al-Muntazar as twelfth Imam who âdisappearedâ in 260, and asserting that Ê¿Ubayd Allah who appeared in North Africa was this same Muhammad emerging from concealment, after an interval of 29 years.\n\n(8) The same line as far as Ê¿Ali al-Hadi, then Husayn, presumably a brother of Hasan al-Askari, and Ê¿Ubayd Allah as son of this Husayn. This is given by Ibn Khallikan on the authority of a reference in Ibn al-Athir. All these three last genealogies must be dismissed as later suggestions since it is clear that the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect rejected the Imams of the âTwelversâ after JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq: but it may be that Ahmadâs first claim was simply to be an Ê¿Alid, and not necessarily the son of the house of IsmaÊ¿il.\n\n[38]\n\n(9) Finally we have another theory, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan, that the Mahdi was descended from Hasan, a brother of JaÊ¿far as-Sadiq, and so an Ê¿Alid but not an Imam, and from this Hasan came Ê¿Abdullah, Ahmad, Hasan, and then Ê¿Ali or Ê¿Ubayd Allah the Mahdi. Back to Ê¿Abdullah this was the generally asserted genealogy of the Mahdiâs family, but Hasan, the brother of JaÊ¿far, replaces Maymun.\n\nThe chief point is that there were so many alternative forms of the genealogy, and close scrutiny shows very weak points in every one of them. To the fully initiated this was a very small matter, as no importance was attached to the claim to the Imamate or to the descent from Ê¿Ali at all. No doubt all these pedigrees served their purpose in dealing with the different types of proselytes, and their very diversity tends to prove that they were actually accepted and circulated in a sect which adapted its teachings to suit the opinions of the different classes with which it came into contact. It was not until the Fatimids became a political power that any need was felt to bring these various genealogies into any kind of agreement, and then, no doubt, the variant forms circulated by the different missionaries were a source of embarrassment.\n\nWe turn now to the formation of the important branch of the IsmaÊ¿ilian sect known as the Qarmatians, which is particularly interesting as we have detailed accounts of its formation which show how the propaganda worked, and illustrate the ease with which an armed group could set up an independent robber state in this period of the decay of the Khalifate. Of the history of their founding there are two leading narratives slightly divergent in details,âwhich De Goeje (pp. 13-17) calls A. and B. A. given by De Sacy (Druses, pp. clxvi., etc.) is that of Nuwayri, who drew his information from Akhu Muhsin, who obtained it from Ibn Razzam, and the substance, drawn from the same sources, appears in the Fihrist. B. (in De Sacy clxxi., etc.) is really the account given by Tabari, and is based on the description given by a person who had been present at the examination of Zaqruyah the Qarmatian by Muhammad b. Dawud b. al-Jarrah. The A. account is as follows.\n\nOne of Ahmadâs missionaries named Husayn Ahwazi was sent to labour in the district of Kufa known as the Sawad. As he was travelling he met a man named Hamdan b. Ashhath al-Qarmati, who was leading an ox with forage on its back. Husayn asked him the way to a place named Kass-Nahram, and Hamdan replied that he was going there himself. Then Husayn asked him where was a place named Dawr, and Hamdan told him that was his home. So they went on together. Then Hamdan says: âYou seem to have come a long way and to be very tired: get on this ox of mine.â But Husayn declined, saying that he had not been told to do so. Hamdan remarked: âYou speak as though you acted according to the [40] orders which some one had given you.â Husayn admitted that this was so. âAnd who,â Hamdan asked, âit is then from whom you receive these orders and prohibitions?â Husayn replied: âIt is my master and yours, the master of this world and of the world to come.â After some reflection Hamdan said: âThere is only God most High who is master of all things.â âTrue,â replied Husayn, âbut God entrusts control to whom he pleases.â Hamdan then asked, âWhat do you intend to do in the village to which you have asked to be directed?â âI am going,â said Husayn, âto bring to many people who dwell there a knowledge of the secrets of God. I have received orders to water the village, to enrich the inhabitants, to deliver them, and to put them in possession of their mastersâ goods.â Then he began to persuade Hamdan to embrace his teaching. Hamdan said: âI beseech you in the name of God to reveal to me what you possess of this wisdom: deliver it to me, and God will deliver you.â âThat,â said Husayn, âis a thing I cannot do, unless I previously get from you an undertaking and bind you in the name of God by a promise as an oath like that which God has always exacted from his prophets and apostles. After that I shall be able to tell you things which will be useful to you.â Hamdan continued to urge, and at last Husayn gave way, and as they sat by the roadside Husayn administered the oath to him and asked his name. Hamdan replied that he was commonly known as the Qarmat, and invited Husayn to take up his abode with him. So Husayn went to his house and gained many converts from Hamdanâs kinsmen and neighbours. There he stayed for some time, arousing in his host and others the strongest admiration of the ascetic and pious life he led, fasting by day, and watching by night. He worked as a tailor, and it was generally felt that the garments which had passed through his hands were consecrated. When the date harvest came a learned and wealthy citizen of Kufa named Abu Ê¿Abdullah Muhammad b. Ê¿Umar b. Shabab Adawi, hearing good reports of him, made him guardian of his date garden, and found him scrupulous in his attention and honesty. Husayn revealed his doctrines to this employer, but he saw through the piety which had [41] impressed the villagers and understood that he was a conspirator. Before his death Husayn appointed Hamdan as daÊ¿i in his place. This is an outline of the narrative of the origin of the Qarmatians, so called as the followers of Hamdan the Qarmat, according to the Sherif Abu l-Hasan as reported in the history of Nuwayri.\n\nGregory Bar Hebraeus gives a different account which appears also in Bibars Mansuri and in another part of Nuwayri who cites the authority of Ibn Athir, and this is the second account which de Goeje calls B. According to it a Persian of Khuzistan established himself in the Nahrayn or district between the rivers, near Hufa, and soon drew attention by the asceticism and piety of his life. When anyone went and sat by him he used to discourse about religion and try to induce his hearers to renounce the world; he taught that it was a matter of obligation to pray fifty times a day, and that it was his office to guide men to the true Imam whose abode he knew. Some merchants purchased the produce of the garden in which this recluse had taken up his abode, and enquired for a trustworthy watchman to look after their property. The gardener introduced the recluse to them, and they gave him charge of the produce. When they came to take away their dates they paid the watchman, and he, on his part, paid the gardener for the dates supplied to him, deducting a rebate for the stones. The merchants saw this reckoning going on, and supposed that he had been selling some of their dates, so they struck him, saying, âIs it not enough that you have eaten our dates?âis it for you also to sell the stones?â The gardener then spoke up and told them the facts, and when they perceived their error they made their apologies and conceived a very high opinion of his rectitude and probity. Some time later he fell ill, and the gardener sent for a certain villager commonly known as Qaramita, a word which in the Nabataean language means a man with red eyes. This villagerâs real name is not given, but Tabari adds that Muhammad b. Dawud b. al-Jarrah said to someone that he was called Hamdan. He was an owner of oxen which were used to carry the produce of Sawad to the city of Kufa. He took the sick man to his house and there the devotee [42] stayed until he was quite well, and whilst there taught the Qaramita the doctrines of the sect to which he belonged, and also instructed the villagers. From amongst his converts he chose twelve nakibs, in imitation of Moses and Jesus, and sent them out as missionaries. He required his followers to pray fifty times a day, and as a result the work of the villagers fell into arrears. A certain Haysam who possessed property in the village perceived this and made enquiry as to the reason; this led him into contact with the devotee who was induced to reveal to him his peculiar doctrines. Haysam perceived their subversive character and took him to Kufa where he locked him up in his house, but a female servant who was moved by the captiveâs apparent piety stole the key and set him free. In the morning the room was found empty, and this was reported as a miracle. Soon afterwards the devotee re-appeared to the villagers and told them that he had been set free by angels, and then he escaped to Syria. After his departure the Qaramata continued to preach and expand the doctrines which he had learned, and in this was assisted by the other nakibs. According to Ibn Athir, cited by Nuwayri, this Qaramat or Hamdan was a man who âaffected a religious life, detached from the world and mortified,â and âwhen anyone joined his sect Hamdan took a piece of gold from him, saying that it was for the Imam. From them (i.e., his followers) he chose twelve nakibs whom he charged to call men to his religion, saying that they were the apostles of Isa b. Maryam.â\n\nThe A. text refers to Husaynâs death, the B. text says that he went to Syria. Tabari speaks of the devotee as coming from Khuzistan, but Akhu Muhsin says that he was sent by Ahmad from Salamiya. De Goeje (p. 18) suggests that he may have been Ahmadâs son Husayn. According to the Kitab al-Oyun (MS. Berlin, 69âcited by de Goeje) SaÊ¿id, the son of Husayn, the son of Ahmad, the son of Ê¿Abdullah, was born at Salamiya in 259 or 260. But evidently there is some error here. Husayn was the grandson, not the son, of Abdullah, and the head of the sect did not leave Askar Mokram before 266: probably not until after [43] the repression of the slave rebellion in 270. No open revolt of the Qarmatians took place until 286.\n\nIn his Chronicle Bar Hebraeus applies to the sect of the Nusayri all that he says about the Qarmatians, and so the books of the Druses in their references to the Nusayri prove that they hold very much the same doctrines as the IsmaÊ¿ilians. It is supposed that the Nusayri sect is a survival of an ancient pagan community (cf. RenÃ© Dussand: Hist. et religion des Nosairis, Paris, 1900). This fits in with the advice given to the missionaries that Manichaean converts may be admitted to a higher grade without hesitation.\n\nAfter this rather confused account of the foundation of the sect of Qarmatians we find ourselves on surer ground. It is clear that Hamdan surnamed the Qarmati was the convert chosen to act as head of the branch founded near Kufa, and he seems to have been diligent in sending out missionaries throughout the whole district of Sawad, where success was easy as the oppressed Nabataean villagers were still groaning under the tyranny of the Arab colonists of the two camp-cities, Kufa and Basra. Not only were the peasants won over in large numbers, but many of the dissatisfied Arab tribes were also gained: these, it will be understood, were those tribes which had had no share in the wealth acquired by the Khalif and his followers. At first Hamdan required each proselyte to pay a piece of silver, corresponding to the fitr or legal alms which Muslims are expected to pay at the end of Ramadan. Then he exacted a piece of gold from each person on attaining the age of reason, a tribute which he called hijra or âflight,â perhaps because intended for the maintenance of a place of refuge called the âhouse of flight.â Later again he demanded seven pieces of gold which he termed bulgha or âlivelihood.â He prepared a choice banquet, and gave a small portion to each of those who gave him the seven pieces of gold, saying that it was the food of the dwellers in paradise sent down to the Imam. He next levied a fifth of all their possessions, basing his claim on the words of the QurÊ¾an, âAnd know ye, that when ye have taken any booty, a fifth part belongeth to God and to His Apostleâ (Qur. 8, 42). Next he required them to deposit all their goods in a [44] common fund, a reminiscence of the communism taught in pre-Islamic times by the Persian prophet Mazdak, and justified this by the passages, âRemember Godâs goodness towards you, how that when ye were enemies, He united your hearts, and by His favour ye became brethrenâ (Qur. 3, 98), and âHadst thou spent all the riches of the earth, thou couldst not have united their hearts; but God hath united them, for He is Mighty, Wiseâ (Qur. 8, 64). He told them that they had no need of money because everything on earth belonged to them, but he exhorted them to procure arms. All this took place in the year 276.\n\nThe daÊ¿i chose in each village a man worthy of confidence, and in his charge they placed the property of the inhabitants. By this means clothes were provided for those who were without, and all had their needs supplied so that there was no more poverty. All worked diligently, for rank was made to depend on a manâs utility to the community; no one possessed any private property save sword and arms. Then it is said the daÊ¿i assembled men and women together on a certain night, and encouraged them to indulge in promiscuous intercourse. After this, assured of their absolute obedience, he began to teach them the more secret doctrines of the sect, and so deprived them of all belief in religion, and discouraged the observance of external rites such as prayer, fasting, and the like. This was the distinctive mark of the Qarmatian branch: the initiated were no longer a small minority living in the midst of their fellow sectarians who still adhered to the external forms of Islam, but amongst the Qarmatians all were initiated to the fullest extent in all the teachings of the sect. Before long they began to steal and to commit murders, so that they produced a reign of terror in the vicinity. Then the daÊ¿is felt that the "
