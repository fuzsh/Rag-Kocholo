        "text": "As promised here is my second piano video. For this one I wanted to choose something a little more recent. Hope Estheim was my favourite character from Final Fantasy XIII (as well as Lightning), I found that his character development was the best in the game. At first I’m sure most people would agree that he was a whiny little kid, but then given the circumstances like him mother dying and being made a l’Cie, you can’t really blame the poor child. But as he progressed through the game, you started to bond with him the more he grew stronger. You started to realise what he was going through and began to emphasize with his character.\n\nHopes Theme from Final Fantasy XIII was originally played on guitar, there was also another track called ‘Sustained by Hate’ which was related to Hope, and that was played on piano (which I will also be making a video of in the near future).\n\nI managed to purchase the Final Fantasy XIII official piano sheet music book from Amazon, so what you hear is played through the official sheet music and not by ear.\n\nEnjoy the video and please comment and rate as you deem fit, thanks!"
