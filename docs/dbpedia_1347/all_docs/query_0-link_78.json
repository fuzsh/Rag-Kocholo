I have it on Precise on Scope and itâs super annoying when you are dealing with duos or squads since it changes targets. The other thing I hate is the Card luck thing in which you pull a card and get a reward. Well, Iâm peer sure itâs not just me, but whenever I have to choose one it always and I mean ALWAYS get the worst reward possible. For example, I remember that time when I pulled a card and the other two had 500 diamonds and 2k gold. I was about to sew your company for selling fake game, but you are lucky that I didnât lose my temper. Letâs not talk about all those hackers who shot you inside the walls or the unreal weapons. I mean, come on! How much recoil does the AK really have? At least this got fixed when you added the Bipod so, thanks, I guess. Lastly, you should really get some ideas from teens (recommended age is from 15-17) help you with the design and graphics. You need some stuff like that. Thatâs all I had to say, because I donât want to write a book with all the problems that this game has. Please reply me."
