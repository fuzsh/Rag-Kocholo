We'll have a full introduction a bit later on but, for now, let's dive into the interview.\n\nThe Witcher 3 remains one of the most modded and most beloved games on our site and we certainly see no sign of that stopping anytime soon. That's especially true when we have incredible mod authors such as nikich3...\n\nMonthly Roundup - July 2024\n\nIt’s time for another monthly roundup. I know, I can’t believe how fast the months are flying by either! I’m a little delayed on posting this one this month, as there’s been a lot going on our end, but we've got some big updates from July, so let’s take a look at what we got up to.\n\nMy Reports Page\n\nA new ‘My Reports’ page, which displays all of your moderation reports and their current status. You can find the page by navigating to your moderation settings and cl...\n\nDonation Points System Changes Delayed\n\nWe planned to release the Donation Points reports for April, May and June this week along with adding April's DP to your wallets. However, we're sorry to say we will be unable to meet that deadline due to an unexpected issue with the new system. The bug resulted in some inaccuracies in total DP for each author and we want to take the time to ensure that this is fixed, tested and verified before we publish any new reports. We messed up with this and we're sorry!\n\nOur development tea...\n\nDonation Points System update\n\nBack in May we told you we were changing the way mod author rewards work. We're fast approaching the launch of the new algorithm so we wanted to give a little more detail on what's changing, why it's changing and what it means for you. A TL:DR is at the end of the post\n\nAs we mentioned in the previous post, the Donation Points system has been a massive success with tens of thousands of mod authors receiving a bonus reward on top of the donations they'd have normally received directly...\n\nSo Many Milestones\n\nWe’re excited to share that the Nexus Mods community has hit three major milestones, showing just how far we’ve all come together over the years.\n\nA couple of months ago we reached an incredible 50 million registered users, something that seems a little wild to us at times but is a number that highlights our thriving modding community. Additionally, on the 22nd of July, we added our 3,000th supported game to the site. You’ve really spoilt us for choice with all the games we can...\n\nFallout: London releases today!\n\nGrab your cricket bat and don your flat cap because it's time to explore a new post-nuclear city in Fallout: London. The expansive new mod takes players to Old Blighty in the post-apocalyptic world of Fallout 4. You can download the mod for free on GOG and it's compatible with both the GOG and Steam versions of Fallout 4 GOTY.\n\nWith the Nexus Mods offices in the UK, we've kept a keen eye on the development of the Fallout: London project over the last few years. We featured it on th...\n\nModder to Developer - Hothtrooper44\n\nWe’re excited to reignite a series we last featured a few years ago, celebrating the journey from modder to developer. Our community has always been a hub of creativity, and we’re thrilled to highlight those who have turned their passion for modding into professional game development.\n\nToday we’re joined by Hothtrooper44, who made popular mods such as Immersive Weapons and Immersive Armors for Skyrim and Skyrim Special Edition, as well as Wasteland Sniper and Armored General fo...\n\nThe Witcher 3 REDkit Modding Contest\n\nExciting news for Witcher fans! We're thrilled to announce our collaboration with CD PROJEKT RED for the upcoming The Witcher 3 REDkit modding contest.\n\nGet ready to unleash your creativity and join the official modding contest for The Witcher 3 REDkit!

Based on revamped versions of the same tools used by the developers nearly a de...\n\nUpcoming maintenance: 10 July 2024\n\nOn 10 July 2024 (tomorrow!) we will be performing scheduled maintenance which will mean the website and API will be unavailable for up to 4 hours. This is part of our preparations for enabling the searching of mod comments. The maintenance will start at 0900 (GMT+1), you can convert this to your local timezone here.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nWe're preparing the site for the long-awaited mod comment search feature, which we know has been sorely missed since we upgraded...\n\nGet To Know: Iluviel\n\nIn addition to our modder spotlights and mod author interviews, we'll be starting a new series which we hope you'll all enjoy. As I mentioned in my introduction interview, we want to be more transparent and open with you all, and for you to get to know us all a little more. So we sat down and thought, what would be a great way to do this? To give a more personal insight into us as a company and the people who work here that make Nexus Mods what it is, whilst feeling more connected as a communit...\n\nMonthly Roundup - June 2024\n\nAnother month has flown by and with it comes our next monthly roundup for you all. This month it’s a little shorter as we’re still partway through our 3-week work cycle, but we wanted to update you on what we’ve accomplished in June.\n\nThe Nexus Mods App Alpha Test\n\nA big one this month is the launch of the Nexus Mods app alpha test. We cannot stress enough how early stages the app is, and it currently only supports Stardew Valley. While we do have plans to support mor...\n\nBaldur's Gate 3 July Modathon\n\nIt’s been almost a year since the official release of Baldur’s Gate 3. Since then, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of love and mods for the game, propelling Baldur’s Gate 3 to become our 9th most-modded game here on Nexus Mods. So, what better way to celebrate than with a modathon?\n\nThis July, the Baldur’s Gate 3 Modding Community will be hosting a month-long Modathon!\n\nEvery week, 2-3 mod authors will be randomly selected by the event hosts to win a Steam Key. ...\n\nCalling Stardew Valley testers - Nexus Mods app\n\nGet ready, gamers!

In this post, we'll give you a little update on the project and provide the juicy details on how you can join the alpha.\n\nProject update\n\nOver the la...\n\nTaking a Short Rest - Aether\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 needs no introduction. As it was probably everyone's Game of the Year of 2023 (including ours). The game went from being the 51st-ranked game on our site while it was in early access to 9th by January 2024. The modding scene has exploded, so we thought it was about time we interviewed a BG3 mod author.\n\nOn that note, it is with great pleasure that Aether has agreed to be our first mod author interviewee, and we couldn’t be more thankful for her taking the time to...\n\nIntroducing: SlugGirl\n\nHave you ever wanted to see what we’re up to as a community while scrolling through your Instagram feed?
