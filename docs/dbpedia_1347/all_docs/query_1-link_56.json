        "text": "The Final Fantasy series has a somewhat special place in my heart. Not in the same way as most fans of the series who can reminisce about a series they grew up with and that in turn grew up with them. I’m talking about the individuals in this video who each cite different games in the series that remain their favorites to this day. One theory on Final Fantasy states whichever game in the series you first play will remain your favorite.\n\nAnd that’s true for me, even though I haven’t played as much as these guys. The first game in the series I played (FF X) sits atop my ‘favorite games of all time’ list. It was FF X and Kingdom Hearts that really kicked off my love of the ‘Spirited Away’ narrative because I hadn’t seen Spirited Away yet at this point in my life (surprised gasps and hushed murmurs). Calm down. I’ve since dabbled in FF VII and the game I’m going to discuss today: FF XIII.\n\nLike all the Final Fantasy games, XIII was heavily influenced by the series’ creator: Hironobu Sakaguchi. I’ve also been hinting at an upcoming piece on music in storytelling, and all three of the FF games mentioned above had their soundtracks composed by the John Williams of video games: Nobuo Uematsu. It’s actually not unfair to attribute a lot of my love for these games to Uematsu’s soundtracks. But that’s something for another day. Let’s start this “Plotting” as we always do: with background and setting.\n\nFF XIII is set in a world that should be instantly familiar to fans of the franchise: that of a magic-based fantasy world with steampunk elements, or as it’s phrased in this game: a magical-industrial revolution. The revolution is leading to a rapid development of both magical engines that improve the daily lives of citizenry, and a global arms race between the three nations of Gohtza, Khent, and Uhra. The latter two are at war at the start of our story. A fourth island nation, Numara, chooses to engage in a policy of isolationism. The nations themselves are little more than massive city-states, surrounded by vast swaths of wild territory sparsely populated with villages and outposts that haven’t gone through the magical-industrial revolution at the same rate as the cities.\n\nThe game emphasizes the struggle of societies to remain stable amidst rapid growth and change, particularly in regards to industrialization and ‘progress.’ The entire story is set amidst the upheaval that is the fantasy equivalent of one of the greatest social revolutions in recent human history: the industrial revolution. While thought of as mainly impacting industry and the day-to-day lives of civilians, the industrial revolution had a massive ripple effect throughout all levels of the societies it came into contact with. It also naturally led to increased tensions between nations as some would more rapidly develop their industries, militaries, etc. and pose threats to their neighbors.\n\nThis sort of asymmetrical development can lead to a real political-science phenomenon in which two states engaged in policies of mutual coexistence face commitment problems when the status quo results in one state becoming more powerful relative to the other. This encourages the less powerful state to go to war to alter the status quo while the gap in the two states’ relative power is still small.\n\nIn the scenario presented in Final Fantasy XIII, Uhra is advancing much more rapidly than Khent so it’s in the interest of the latter to go to war to upset this trend.\n\nThe main character of our story is Kaim, a mercenary serving with the Uhran army during the decisive battle of the Wohl Highlands against Khent. The battle is quite the gruesome ordeal and ends somewhat unexpectedly when a meteor falls onto the field, killing everyone involved… except for Kaim who wanders out of the epicenter, mysteriously unscathed.\n\nTurns out the man is an immortal, and has spent the last 1000 years wandering around the world serving as a mercenary, traveler, loving father, and husband. Except he doesn’t remember any of these things. Like we discussed with Final Fantasy X when we were covering the “Spirited Away” arc-plot and as is discussed in the Final Fantasy VII video series linked above, these games share a theme of investigating their characters’ identities. Namely the destruction and recreation of them. But we’ll get back to these memories in a paragraph or two.\n\nOn his way back to the city of Uhra for debriefing, Kaim encounters another survivor of the meteor, another immortal without a memory by the name of Seth. In the debriefing the two are paired and sent to investigate the Uhran project Grand Staff headed by councilman Gongora, a colossal magical engine that the Uhran council believes could be malfunctioning and may have caused the meteor striking the Wohl Highlands. Kaim spends the night at an inn in the city before striking out in the morning.\n\nIt’s at this inn that Kaim (and in turn, the player) unlocks the first in a series of 30-ish short stories collectively titled “A Thousand Years of Dreams.” These stories serve the purpose of filling in the backstory of the immortals that gradually come to fill Kaim’s party, as well as serve as some of the emotional highlights of the games. They effectively communicate the journey our 1000 year old protagonists have been on, both the highs and lows. Accompanied by beautifully placed parts of Uematsu’s score and a handful of fuzzy images and colors, the dreams are essentially miniature visual novels with the player reading the events rather than having being told them. It’s strangely effective at keeping the player invested in these otherwise plain sequences.\n\nThe overall theme of these dreams is the immortals coming to grips with how temporary the lives of those around them are in comparison. It manages to highlight the extraordinary in everyday life, making something like walking into a shoe store or travelling down a windswept road a significant moment. The game as a whole emphasizes treasuring the small moments, and “A Thousand Years of Dreams” only builds on this.\n\nPressing on with the main story: Kaim and Seth are joined by the court wizard Jansen, under Gongora’s orders to keep an eye on the two immortals. In some ways, Jansen acts as the character players can most relate to, as for a good chunk of the game he’s the only non-immortal in our party. He starts off a bit annoying with all of his questions and complaining, but grows as much as anyone along the journey.\n\nThe three make it to Grand Staff but are captured by a Numaran expedition who was also conducting an expedition on the magical engine after hearing about the disaster at the Wohl Highlands. Our three travelers encounter Queen Ming of Numara, who happens to be another immortal without a memory. Jansen immediately falls in love, but we’ll get back to this later. Kaim also meets his daughter (who he thought died as a child, is now grown, ill, and dying for real) and two grandchildren, Cooke and Mack.\n\nMEANWHILE, BACK IN UHRA:\n\nGongora is beginning to plant the seeds of his takeover of the city. He uses his close ties to the Uhran prince, Tolten, as an advisor and persuades him to abolish the republic and make Uhra a monarchy again. The council, already weary of Gongora’s association with Grand Staff places him under house arrest, a turn of events he spins to Tolten as a move by the council against both of them. He also fakes an assassination attempt on Tolten to secure his influence over the young prince.\n\nReturning to our main characters in Numara, after a misadventure at some ancient ruins in which everyone gets a more uplifting finale to the death of Kaim’s daughter, things are looking up after about 10 hours of death, misery, and political conspiracies.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII explores the question of what happens to individuals when they die. It’s a question asked by Cooke and Mack, the children of the party. Indeed, the question of what comes after “the end” is one most commonly asked by children, and one we find ourselves having to explain to them, whether we ourselves are ready to answer or not. It’s fairly clever of the game’s writers to not simply ask the question through the children, but also provide an answer through the misadventures the two lead the group on.\n\nInitially, it’s Mack who wanders off to the ruins mentioned above when he hears about the possibility to encounter the spirits of the dead (e.g. his mom). Later in the game, both Cooke and Mack head off to encounter an aurora they believe will show them the spirits of the dead. There’s also a moment down the road where their mother’s spirit calls out to them and allows them to save the party from death. The dead aren’t really gone, and that’s a point the game makes repeatedly.\n\nBut don’t get too comfortable because just when things were looking up…\n\nSpeaking of political conspiracies, as word reaches Numara that Tolten is seeking to reestablish the monarchy in Uhra, a general by the name of Kakanas seizes the opportunity to overthrow Ming and force our heroes to flee to Gohtza. In a small village where Kaim seems to be well known, the group hears stories of an old witch living in the mansion. Turns out the mansion is where Kaim used to live with another immortal, Sarah, and they had that daughter we mentioned earlier who they both believed died. That event is tied to Kaim losing his memory. The old witch is merely Sarah who was destroyed by the grief of losing her daughter. The group rescues her from her grief and she joins the party, happy to learn her daughter survived (for a time) and overjoyed to meet her grandchildren.\n\nAfter much travelling through dark caves and through icy mountains, our protagonists arrive at Gohtza where a meeting between Uhra and Gohtza is arranged to defuse the rising tensions over the construction of Grand Staff, which Gohtza views as a weapon of mass destruction. Tolten represents Uhra and Ming represents Numara. The king of Gohtza, another old friend of Kaim’s, requests his and Sarah’s presence at the meeting.\n\nBut problems arise when Cooke and Mack run off when they hear rumors of a means to contact the souls of the dead (aka, their mother). Remember the aurora thing? Yeah, that. Kaim and Sarah are forced to give chase, leaving Seth and Jansen to oversee the proceedings of the peace summit. And then certain metaphorical things hit the metaphorical fan.\n\nAs it so happens, everyone was right to fear Grand Staff as a weapon of mass destruction. The Wohl Highlands incident was Gongora testing the weapon’s capabilities and now he uses it to try and assassinate all the leaders and destroy Gohtza simultaneously. Unleashing a massive ice storm, he kills the Gohtza king, strands Mack and Cooke, Kaim and Sarah who are several kilometers behind, and Ming and Jansen who are able to use magic to resist Gongora’s attack. Tolten meanwhile uses a portal to flee back to Uhra and Seth, thinking he’s in on the attack, pursues him.\n\nGohtza meanwhile lies and ruins and Gongora uses the whole incident to announce Tolten’s death and “with reluctance” take the Uhran throne for himself. Also, surprise surprise, Gongora is an immortal who is not only mad with power, is also the one behind the erasure of all the other immortals’ memories.\n\nThe entire subplot of Uhra’s changing political model ties into themes regarding the right to rule and the corrupting nature of power. It was Gongora’s inability to resist the desire to abuse the power his positions as a councilman and an immortal leant him that set all the events of this game in motion. Likewise, we are shown the positive influence a benign autocrat can have on the world in the forms of Tolten and Ming as well as the havoc a less benign figure like Gongora can wreck. It also ties into the fluid nature of societies undergoing large-scale revolutions.\n\nIn Uhra, Tolten explains to Seth he had nothing to do with Gongora’s plot, and after witnessing the immortal seize of the throne, Seth believes him. Tolten then helps Seth rescue her pirate son, Sed, who was scheduled to be executed along with others at Gongora’s coronation. The trio escapes despite Gongora’s army of magically summoned creatures (courtesy of Grand Staff) and reclaims Sed’s ship: the Nautilus.\n\nIn Gohtza, Jansen and Ming develop their romance (which had been going on since they first met in Numara but really picks up here). It’s truly at this point where Jansen secures himself as a sympathetic figure. Now he has someone to care about besides himself and can demonstrate his more virtuous traits. They set out to find everyone else and stumble upon Cooke and Mack in the blizzard. After saving the children and locating the crash site of Kaim’s and Sarah’s train, everyone is reunited with Seth, Tolten, and Sed all conveniently showing up.\n\nWith everyone back together, it’s time to take the fight to Gongora. Get ready, because everything is about to get questionably explained and unnecessarily convoluted. At his estate in Uhra, it’s revealed that all five of our immortals were sent from a parallel world to investigate this one and that it’s a difference in the flow of time that keeps them immortal. They had been sent as observers because of a magical-emotional bleed-through that was affecting their world from this one.\n\nBut Gongora had other designs, which we’ve seen play out to this point. When they were scheduled to return home, Gongora ambushed them separately on their way to the portal and erased their memories. That portal also correlates to the renewed burst of magical energy that allowed the magical-industrial revolution to happen. Now Gongora wants to shut the portal forever, erase the memories of our heroes, and rule the world as a god.\n\nDid this really need to be explained this way? I don’t think so, though to be fair the game explains it much better than I do in those two paragraphs.\n\nEveryone confronts Gongora in the Hall of Mirrors, the site of the portal and the only location where time flows normally for the immortals. Tolten, Cooke, Mack, Jansen, and Sed (as mortals) must erect a barrier between themselves and the immortals to protect themselves from the accelerated time flow.\n\nFinding himself equally matched, Gongora looks like he might get beaten until he reverses the barrier the mortals had erected, forcing them to experience the accelerated time flow. With a bit of quick thinking, Seth sacrifices herself to drag Gongora back through the portal while Kaim shatters it from his side to ensure Gongora can never return and saving his companions. We can assume Gongora receives parallel-world justice and we’re given a sweet, semi-Return of the King-style epilogue.\n\nMing and Jansen are married. Ming and Tolten, as the leading rulers left, bring their nations’ resources together to rebuild the damage done by Gongora. The monarchy is restored in Uhra and Kaim and Sarah settle back down to raise Cooke and Mack. It’s implied that though she’s permanently separated from her friends, Seth can still observe the world from her side and can watch all the happy endings unfold.\n\nAnd there you have it: Final Fantasy XIII, a game that ties itself up perfectly without need of sequels, or expanding the universe at all.\n\nThroughout the game, the characters are faced with constant questions regarding their identities. At times, some characters ask point-blank if memories are worth remembering, especially painful ones. The entire game is one of major emotional lows, with some highs that out of context don’t seem that significant, but manage to strike the right notes. The party reuniting at the end of disk 3 shouldn’t seem like that big of a deal, but after all the mishaps and tragedy up until that point, you bet it’s an emotional high.\n\nThese themes of identity, loss, right of rule, and societal revolutions are shared by other Final Fantasy games, namely VII and X, so perhaps it’s of little surprise that they are found here as well given the shared influence of Hironobu Sakaguchi.\n\nAlright, that’s about all I’ve got on FF XIII.\n\nFinal Note: Hey all! Thanks for your continuous willingness to read this blog and my thoughts on various plot elements. There’s going to be a bit of a content gap on this blog for a couple of weeks. Let’s just call it a hiatus. It’s a bit of a mental health holiday. Let’s face it, I’m running out of consistently good ideas for this blog. And while the world of stories is infinite and vast in all its forms, I need some time to clear my head. We’ll be back with regularly scheduled posts on 20 April. Go have an adventure until then.\n\nThis is the only part of this post that isn’t a joke.\n\nApril Fools you filth animals."
