Although listening to music often evokes what people describe as feeling moved, very little is known about the appraisals or musical features contributing to the experience. In the present study, we investigated experiences of feeling moved in response to music using a continuous rating paradigm. A total of 415 US participants completed an online experiment where they listened to seven moving musical excerpts and rated their experience while listening. Each excerpt was randomly coupled with one of seven rating scales (perceived sadness, perceived joy, feeling moved or touched, sense of connection, perceived beauty, warmth [in the chest], or chills) for each participant. The results revealed that musically evoked experiences of feeling moved are associated with a similar pattern of appraisals, physiological sensations, and trait correlations as feeling moved by videos depicting social scenarios (found in previous studies). Feeling moved or touched by both sadly and joyfully moving music was associated with experiencing a sense of connection and perceiving joy in the music, while perceived sadness was associated with feeling moved or touched only in the case of sadly moving music. Acoustic features related to arousal contributed to feeling moved only in the case of joyfully moving music. Finally, trait empathic concern was positively associated with feeling moved or touched by music. These findings support the role of social cognitive and empathic processes in music listening, and highlight the social-relational aspects of feeling moved or touched by music.",

        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe emotional effects of music are among the most important reasons for engaging in music listening in everyday life (e.g., [1–3]). These effects range from slight changes in affective state to exceptionally strong, transformative experiences [4]. One commonly reported response to music is feeling moved or touched [1]. Beyond the domain of music, this phenomenon has garnered increased interest in recent years. Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that people often say they are moved or touched in response to increased affiliation and morality, and that the emotional state is experienced as predominantly positive, often features tears, chills, or warm feelings, and motivates social bonding [5, 6] (Zickfeld et al., 2019). This evidence further indicates that people across a vast array of cultures and languages respond similarly to elicitors of the emotional state, labeling their state with corresponding terms in their language. In English, people typically use the terms moved and touched to describe their state. We will use feeling moved to denote this subjective feeling state.\n\nHowever, there exist few systematic studies that have tested the convergence of these features in response to music. Rather, prior studies focused on specific components or certain types of music only (e.g., [7]). Are people moved by the same affiliative aspects when listening to music as they are when for example reuniting with a loved one? What musical properties facilitate feeling moved? There is some evidence that music can indeed convey affiliation motives and that listeners can feel socially connected to different aspects of music or instruments [8–10].\n\nIn the present study, we explore correlates of feeling moved or touched in response to music, focusing on the question of whether theories of feeling moved can account for responses to music and which musical and acoustical features contribute to the experience of feeling moved. Instead of probing individuals’ subjective responses after listening to different musical excerpts, we asked participants in the current study to continuously rate their experiences and perceptions while they unfold during music listening using a continuous self-report paradigm (e.g., [11]).\n\nTheories of feeling moved\n\nBuilding on anthropological and ethnographic work, Fiske et al. [12] introduced kama muta as a universal tendency to respond emotionally (in a way that is often described as moved or touched) when communal sharing suddenly intensifies. Communal sharing is one of four basic schemes (or models) of relating to others focusing on what we have in common. It is expressed by giving according to need and ability (while the other three models are expressed by giving according to hierarchy, equality and proportionality, respectively), by bodily proximity, touch, synchrony, or food sharing (see [13], for a more detailed introduction of communal sharing and the remaining models). States of kama muta are thus characterized by appraisals of increased interpersonal closeness or connectedness (reflecting the intensification of communal sharing), by labeling them as moved, touched or heartwarming, as well as by sensations of tears, warmth in the chest and chills, by experiencing them as positive, and by renewed devotion to one’s relationships characterized by communal sharing [14, 15].\n\nEmpirical evidence has supported kama muta theory across several different cultural contexts [5, 16]. However, so far the empirical studies testing kama muta theory have only used stories and videos to evoke kama muta through the intensification of communal sharing between human characters. Fiske [14] assumes that the same appraisal of increased closeness or connectedness also accounts for instances where people describe being moved by music: “Sometimes the CS that suddenly intensifies is between musicians and audience, sometimes among the musicians or singers, sometimes among the audience, sometimes with the composer or even with the music itself.” However, so far, this proposition has not been tested.\n\nKama muta theory defines the emotion of kama muta through the main appraisal theme, intensification of communal sharing (labelled an elicitor-specific eudaimonic emotion in recent theorizing, [17]). The labels that persons give their emotional experience, such as moved, touched, heartwarming, raptured and others, in English, are but one, though for diagnostic purposes often very important, index for the emotion [12].\n\nConversely, other theories define the emotion through the label “being moved”, encompassing assumed elicitors, subjective feelings, physiological signs and sensations and often also motivational tendencies (a feeling-specific eudaimonic emotion according to Landmann [17], see [6], for a review). Of these, two are particularly relevant for the present investigation. Konečni [18, 19] treats being moved as part of the aesthetic trinity, next to thrills or chills and states of aesthetic awe. Thereby, being moved represents strong emotional states that are experienced in response to the sublime (including musical stimuli). He contends that chills are, in the context of music, far more frequent and predictable (because they are shallower) than the state of being moved. He considers being moved to be a rarer response and determined by the personal associative context of the person. If this was the case, there should be low interindividual agreement on what the moving segments in a musical piece are. Conversely, kama muta theory suggests that being moved can be evoked reliably by musical passages because the music itself conveys an intensification of communal sharing. We also expect that for moving music, the occurrence of chills and feeling moved or touched coincide to a large degree.\n\nThe other theory we draw on for the present investigation is the distancing-embracing model [20], which posits that being moved is involved in transforming negative states into pleasurable experiences in aesthetic perceptions, including music listening. Being moved is thereby conceptualized as a mixed emotion that is experienced as predominantly positive. The authors distinguish between two prototypes of being moved: a sadly moving and a joyfully moving variant [21, 22]. They expect that being moved plays a more important role in the enjoyment of sad stimuli. Indeed, empirical research has indicated that being moved is a mediating factor in explaining the enjoyment of artworks that are experienced as sad [22, 23]. Similar findings have also been obtained for sad music, and empathic responses were identified as a possible driver [7, 24].\n\nEmpathy, in turn, has been identified as a characteristic of at least an important variant of being moved, and empathic predispositions predict the propensity to feel moved [6, 21, 25]. It remains to be shown, however, whether feeling moved or touched by predominantly sad versus joyful pieces of music have the same profile, which would strengthen the argument that it is the same emotion in different affective contexts.\n\nTo summarize, based on kama muta theory we predict that feeling moved or touched by music co-occurs with a sense of connectedness and weeping, feelings of warmth in the chest, and chills. While these attributes are compatible with all theories on the state of feeling moved (for overviews, see [6, 26]), the aesthetic trinity theory [18] predicts low agreement regarding which segments move individuals, while kama muta theory predicts high agreement for music that is preselected to be experienced as moving. This high agreement should be caused by similar emotional responses to musical features, and we shall attempt to identify such features. Lastly, we predict that feeling moved by sadly and joyfully moving music will show comparable correlation patterns. This would suggest that it is the same emotion in both cases, whether two variants of the same mixed emotion [21] or the same emotion with different concurrent emotions of sadness and joy [14].\n\nFeeling moved as a response to music\n\nAs briefly alluded to earlier, feeling moved has received increased theoretical and empirical attention in the context of music. In a questionnaire study a total of 141 participants indicated that feeling moved was their fourth most common emotional response in listening to music [1], and interviews reveal that individuals often say that they are moved in the context of strong and profound experiences with music [4]. Similarly, Scherer and Zentner [27] identified feeling moved as a common response when listening to music, involving symptoms such as moist eyes or chills (although they treated feeling moved as a vague emotional category) and a recent survey showed that feeling moved is the most commonly reported emotional state when investigating crying in response to music [28]. Items assessing feeling moved have been included in the Geneva Emotional Music Scale [29] and a hierarchical clustering approach suggests that feeling moved (as measured by the items moved and touched) form a distinct cluster of musically induced emotions [30], being most similar to the states of wonder and transcendence.\n\nIn a recent review of factors affecting the enjoyment of sad music, Eerola et al. [24] identified feeling moved as a possible mediator, next to empathy or social surrogacy. Across two experiments Vuoskoski and Eerola [7] examined this proposition empirically. Testing 327 participants across two experiments, the authors presented several musical excerpts that differed in terms of movingness and sadness, and collected responses on felt sadness, feeling moved and liking. In the first experiment, feeling moved fully mediated the relationship between felt sadness and liking (see [23] for similar findings using film stimuli), and the second experiment further confirmed that this relationship could not be explained by the perceived beauty of the musical pieces. Rather, movingness appeared to contribute to the perceived beauty of sad music. Given these theoretical and empirical findings, Zickfeld [31] suggested that kama muta theory might incorporate and explain several factors contributing to the enjoyment of sad music (identified in Eerola et al.’s [24] review): feeling moved, empathy, social surrogacy, or more precisely communal sharing and affiliation, and experiencing sad music as positive and pleasurable.\n\nWhile it is easy to argue that music may increase affiliation through lyrics expressing tenderness and love [12], the ways in which instrumental music is to convey affiliation seem less straightforward. On one hand, a listener might experience an increase in affiliation by identifying or feeling a connection to the music in general (for example due to rhythmic entrainment; see e.g., [32]), the composer, the musicians, or other fans/listeners. Listening to familiar music may also remind us of nostalgic relationships with significant others: Konečni [18] argues that feeling moved by music is individually determined by the associative context or web that one has constructed with the musical piece, possibly also involving an affiliation towards certain aspects of the music. Evidence from an empirical study on nostalgia responses to music supports this assertion [33]. The authors found that musical pieces were rated as more nostalgic if they were perceived as familiar or more autobiographically salient. In addition, there is evidence that listeners can infer affiliative motives from musical improvisations [8], can feel connected to music through a form of empathy [34], and that listening to moving music from a specific culture can increase affiliation towards that culture [35].\n\nOn the other hand, in more interactive contexts feeling moved might occur due to concert attendants dancing or moving in synchrony, singing in unison, as well as perceiving the musicians performing music in synchrony. All of these aspects have been shown to elicit social bonding (e.g., [36]), and are part of communal sharing relationships that might intensify in specific contexts [13].\n\nMusical chills.\n\nFurther, strong emotional responses to music have been associated with the occurrence of chills, goosebumps or frissons [37–42]. Chills are considered a relatively common, positive psychophysiological response to music or aesthetic stimuli (see [37], for a review). Research has sometimes distinguished between chills as a subjective emotional response and goosebumps or piloerection as an objective physiological response [43]. In the present manuscript, we follow Maruskin et al. [44], who argued that goosebumps represent one physiological component of pleasurable chills.\n\nEmpirical studies have linked the occurrence of chills to strong experiences of feeling moved using qualitative methods, self-report ratings and more observational techniques such as camera devices [5, 22, 38, 43, 45]. Bannister [39] found in a comprehensive survey on chills responses to music that a high number of participants highlighted social aspects such as feelings of connectedness, the human voice, and perceived relationships between virtual agents (i.e., musical instruments/parts) as evoking chills. Similarly, a recent survey study identified moving chills as one of three types of chill responses to aesthetic stimuli, which co-occurred with feeling moved, tenderness, and tears (the other types being warm chills and cold chills, Bannister [38]; see also [44]). Such results fit previous findings and theories on feeling moved and highlight the importance of chills as a correlate of feeling moved or touched in response to music.\n\nFeeling moved and musical features\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has been no direct research linking responses of feeling moved by music to specific musical features (though this has been done for films; [43]). However, indirect evidence focusing on physiological responses to music such as chills or tears, symptoms that are also strongly associated with feeling moved, has been provided. Sloboda [46] found that tears were most often associated with appoggiaturas, while shivers or chills were linked to excerpts containing new or surprising harmonies (see also [47]). Later and Panksepp [42] identified solo instruments that emerge from an orchestral background and crescendos as elicitors of chills. Such dynamic changes in loudness have also been found to be an indicator of chills in more recent research [40, 48, 49]. Relatedly, an experimental study found that increased loudness (acoustic intensity) and reduced brightness (proportion of high to low frequencies) resulted in more frequent reports of chills [39]. Further research has also identified the entrance of a voice and surprising changes or violations of expectations as structural elicitors of chills [47]. As Grewe et al. [40, 47] noted, there seems to be no consistent evidence for a specific chill-inducing acoustical pattern. Rather, interactions among different musical features might be more successful in eliciting a chill response, possibly also depending on additional psychological variables at the individual level such as empathy or familiarity.\n\nThe present study\n\nNot only music performance but also music perception seems to be inherently social. Listeners can infer affiliative motives from musical improvisations [8] and feel connected to music through a form of empathy [34], and music can increase connectedness towards aspects conveyed and embodied by music [35]. While there exists ample evidence that feeling moved often constitutes strong emotional responses to musical stimuli [1, 4], the underlying mechanisms or conditions that moderate this reaction are yet to be investigated. As states of feeling moved typically occur in response to significant social or communal events, we argue that the inherent affiliative signals in music can evoke this particular emotion. Listeners can feel connected to aspects of the music, aspects of the performer(s), aspects of co-listeners, or an interaction of these variables [31].\n\nIn the present study we aim to investigate experiences labeled as feeling moved in response to music using continuous self-reports, a common paradigm in research on music and emotions that allows to model listeners’ responses to music dynamically (see [11, 50, 51]). Instead of prompting participants to rate their emotional reactions after being exposed to a stimulus, continuous self-report paradigms collect responses while participants are presented with a stimulus. This methodology has two obvious strengths compared to self-report ratings after stimulus presentation, and extends and goes beyond previous studies on the role of feeling moved in response to music [7, 52]. First, it allows us to obtain a more nuanced picture of the psychological dynamics and mechanisms unfolding while listening to music. It enables us to test whether the emotion components of feeling moved that have been found to co-occur in other contexts [6] also apply to music listening. For example, previous research has found a positive correlation between feeling sad and feeling moved by music [7]. However, this relationship lacks time specificity: It is not known whether some parts of the music are perceived as sad and others as moving, or whether the same parts are perceived as sad and moving at the same time. Second, it also allows us to test how experiences of feeling moved unfold based on specific musical features. As specified earlier, there is no direct evidence with regard to what musical or psychoacoustic features are associated with feeling moved.\n\nIn the present project we employed a continuous self-report paradigm based on the set-up of a recent empirical study exploring continuous ratings of different aspects of feeling moved in response to videos [53]. Participants were presented with a Likert-type scale and asked to change their ratings when their experiences and perceptions changed while listening to the musical excerpts. Seven variables or ratings were assessed continuously for all excerpts (although each participant rated only one variable per excerpt) to target the feeling, physiological, and appraisal components of the state of the emotion. To assess the feeling component, we included an item of feeling moved or touched as used in a previous study [53]. For the physiological component, we included items on chills and feelings of warmth (in the chest) (based on Schubert et al. [53]). The quality of warmth in the center of the chest has been strongly associated with feeling moved (e.g., [5, 53]), while there has been only limited research exploring the reaction in response to musical stimuli (e.g., [38]). At the moment it is not clear whether these feelings of warmth in the chest are associated with an actual objective temperature increase, or whether participants embody the metaphor of communality and feel social warmth (see [6, 54, 55]).\n\nNote that we did not assess the common response of tears or moist eyes continuously (this was rated only after the music excerpt had ended), since our pilot study indicated a rather low occurrence of self-reported tears or moist eyes in response to our stimuli. For the appraisal component, we wanted to assess the affiliative signals or communal sharing aspects conveyed by the music. While previous studies have measured this aspect using either items with regard to how close someone feels to another target [5], how close the protagonists are to each other, or with the inclusion-of-the-other-in-the-self scale measuring closeness by showing two circles increasing in overlap [53, 56], we felt that it might seem artificial to probe how close someone feels to a certain musical piece while it unfolds. Based on the findings of a pilot study, we decided to assess the extent to which the participants felt a sense of connection when listening to music, relating to findings that individuals are able to detect affiliative intentions in instrumental musical stimuli [8].\n\nGiven that moving music is perceived as more beautiful than non-moving music [7, 28], we also included an item on perceived beauty in order to test whether continuous ratings of beauty are similar to ratings of feeling moved. Finally, in line with previous studies, we also assessed how sad and joyful participants perceived the music. Specifically, we targeted the emotions perceived in the music and not felt emotions for these two items, although it should be noted that the two processes are strongly related (see [7]). This choice was made due to the possibility that the continuous ratings of experienced joy could be confounded by enjoyment of the music as a result of being moved by the music. We were, however, more interested in the elicitors of feeling moved or touched.\n\nSome theorizations have distinguished between the categories of being sadly and joyfully moved [21], and have found different predictions for a number of variables (e.g., [22]). Although all theories on feeling moved emphasize that the emotion is experienced as primarily positive, they do not exclude the possibility that it occurs together at the same time with negative emotions such as sadness. Thus, in the present study we focused on including musical excerpts that were rated as both moving and sad, as well as both moving and joyful in order to explore possible diverging patterns.\n\nBased on previous findings and theories, specifically kama muta theory, we derived a number of different predictions that were pre-registered prior to conducting the study (https://osf.io/76adr). We predicted that the time course of:\n\nfeeling moved or touched (feeling component) correlates positively with the time course of experiences of warmth in the chest, experienced chills (physiological component), and experiencing a sense of connection (appraisal component) across all excerpts;\n\nfeeling moved correlates positively with the time course of perceived beauty across all musical pieces;\n\nfeeling moved correlates positively with the time course of perceiving the music as sad for sadly moving excerpts, while it does less so for joyfully moving excerpts;\n\nfeeling moved correlates positively with the time course of perceiving the music as joyful for joyfully moving excerpts, while it does less so for sadly moving excerpts.\n\nIn addition, we explored relations between feeling moved and musical or acoustic features of the music. As there exists only indirect evidence based on musical chills, we did not pre-register any specific hypotheses but rather treated this aspect of the study as exploratory. Finally, we explored the relationship between ratings of feeling moved and two facets of trait empathy [57]; empathic concern and fantasy. Fantasy denotes the tendency to imaginatively transpose oneself into the feelings and experiences of fictitious characters, and it has been found to predict feeling moved by sad music in prior studies [7, 52]. Empathic concern denotes the sympathy and compassion one feels for others in need. It has been found to predict feeling moved across several studies and cultures and 3000+ participants with an overall effect size of r = .35 [5, 58].\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore continuous ratings of feeling moved or touched by music, and how the time course of feeling moved might covary with specific appraisals, emotional perceptions, and bodily sensations. In addition, we explored the association of continuous ratings of feeling moved with acoustical features extracted from the musical excerpts. Building on previous theorizing and studies on feeling moved (e.g., [6, 22]), we hypothesized that ratings of feeling moved would cross-correlate with feeling a sense of connection, experiencing chills, and experiencing a warm feeling in the chest (H1). Furthermore, because previous studies associated feeling moved with the perceived beauty of music [7], we hypothesized that feeling moved or touched would cross-correlate with ratings of perceived beauty (H2). Finally, we hypothesized that feeling moved or touched would cross-correlate with perceived sadness in the case of sadly moving excerpts (and less so for happily moving excerpts; H3), while it would cross-correlate with perceived happiness for joyfully moving excerpts (and less so for sadly moving excerpts; H4).\n\nMost of our pre-registered hypotheses were supported by our findings. Figs 4–6 show that the time course of feeling moved largely coincided with that of sense of connection, chills, warmth in the chest, perceived beauty and perceived joy across all musical excerpts, and with perceived sadness for sadly moving excerpts. The preregistered and additional cross-correlation analyses confirmed these impressions. A further inspection of the time courses of these ratings shows that they typically increase along the course of the excerpt, with a rather strong initial rise within the first 30 seconds, resulting in a positive linear trends in all ratings and excerpts. Notably, we cannot completely disentangle whether such a rise was caused by actual sudden changes in experiences or by a general need to change the rating because it always started at the lowest score. Furthermore, some excerpts show only monotonic increases, while others had peak ratings before the end and then declining ratings, and some more than one peak. These different time courses are not necessarily reflective of the dynamics of whole musical pieces, as we only used specific excerpts. They are similar in shape to the ones found for moving videos [53].\n\nContinuous ratings of feeling moved or touched had one of the highest cross-correlations overall with ratings of “feeling a sense of connection”, suggesting that appraisals or experiences of closeness or affiliation are associated with experiences of feeling moved also in the case of music. In contrast to a previous study in which people rated the perceived closeness of the people appearing in the video clips [53], we chose to operationalize closeness more broadly as “feeling a sense of connection”. The exact nature of the connection experienced was intentionally left open in order to accommodate for the “floating intentionality” inherent in music [82]. Thus, it is possible that this ‘sense of connection’ may have been construed as existing between the listener and another agent (the music, the performer, other listeners, or perhaps humanity in general), or between real or virtual agents perceived in the music (cf. [8]). In terms of the intensification of communal sharing relations central to kama muta theory, these ‘connections’ could be conceptualized in terms of first- or second-person empathy and compassion (e.g., empathizing with the music or experiencing the music as empathizing with oneself; see [9, 83, 84]), or in terms of affiliative intentions perceived in the music [8]. Despite the range of possible relationships and interpretations, our results demonstrate that participants rated “feeling a sense of connection” consistently, suggesting a shared understanding of the concept and the cues contributing to it.\n\nOur findings also confirmed that ratings of feeling moved or touched cross-correlated with self-reported chills or goosebumps and experiencing a warm feeling in the chest in response to music, replicating previous findings on the association of these variables (e.g., [5, 22, 43, 45]). These patterns of cross-correlations were similar across both sadly and joyfully moving excerpts. This indicates that feeling moved by music is associated with a similar pattern of physiological or bodily sensations as feeling moved by videos depicting social scenarios (and experiences of feeling moved in general; [5]), and that this pattern does not depend on the perceived sadness or joyfulness of the music.\n\nInterestingly, while Koneçni [18, 19] predicts chills to be a more frequent response to music than feeling moved, we found high cross-correlations between the two, suggesting that they largely coincided in occurrence. Furthermore, in line with a previous study showing that movingness mediates the relationship between perceived sadness and beauty in music [7], we found positive cross-correlations between ratings of feeling moved or touched and perceived beauty. Interestingly, these cross-correlations were consistent across both sadly and joyfully moving excerpts. Previous research has associated perceived beauty with perceived sadness and only to a lower degree with perceived happiness (r = .59 vs. r = .16; Eerola and Vuoskoski [85]), while in the current study we found overall weaker associations between perceived sadness and beauty than between perceived joy and beauty (r = .12 vs. r = .54).\n\nSupporting previous findings [86], moving and touching music was also perceived as beautiful. This bears the question whether feeling moved by music triggers a perception of beauty or vice versa. Is all music experienced as beautiful automatically experienced as moving or is moving music automatically perceived as beautiful? Further research is needed to investigate this possibility.\n\nFinally, we had hypothesized that feeling moved or touched would cross-correlate with perceived joy for joyfully moving excerpts but less so for sadly moving excerpts, and with perceived sadness for sadly moving excerpts but less so for joyfully moving excerpts. While feeling moved cross-correlated with perceived joy, but not sadness for joyfully moving music, the picture regarding sadly moving music turned out to be somewhat more complex: When the overall emotional tone of the music was sad rather than joyful, feeling moved or touched cross-correlated with both perceived sadness and perceived joy (except for the excerpt “Oblivion”). The finding that ratings of feeling moved or touched cross-correlated positively with perceived joy across both joyfully and sadly moving excerpts, supports previous theories suggesting that the overall tonality of the experience of feeling moved is positive [6]. This is in fact reflected in most perspectives on feeling moved (cf. [87]).\n\nThe finding that feeling moved or touched cross-correlated positively with perceived sadness for sadly moving excerpts can be interpreted from two different angles. First, it could mean that, although predominantly positive, feeling moved constitutes a mixed state including both negative and positive affect, as suggested by one specific theory [21]. Second, this could mean that feeling moved is experienced as predominantly positive but can co-occur with other negative emotions such as sadness, as suggested by kama muta theory [12, 15]. The observation that feeling moved or touched cross-correlated negatively with perceived sadness for joyfully moving excerpts provides some evidence for the latter explanation. However, it should be noted that we assessed perceived and not experienced sadness and joy, which means that our findings can only be interpreted as indirect evidence. In sum, the main findings support the idea that feeling moved is perceived as predominantly positive—also in the context of music.\n\nNot only did we obtain strong cross-correlations between feeling moved or touched and the other variables (except for perceived sadness in the joyfully moving and overall context), we also observed strong associations among perceived joy, a sense of connection, and reported chills and warmth. These findings support kama muta theory [15] and the theory by Menninghaus et al. [21]. Kama muta theory argues that the underlying emotional construct represents the co-occurrence of sudden intensifications of communal sharing relationships, experiences of tears, chills, and/or warmth in the chest, motivations to act on one’s communal sharing relations, positive valence, and labels such as moved or touched [15]. While the kama muta framework has been supported for short film clips [5], this is the first systematic evidence for the configuration of kama muta in response to music (see [31]). Notably, we did not assess the motivational component of kama muta as it is currently unclear how this might relate to the reception of music.\n\nA further theory conceptualizing experiences of feeling moved is core values theory [88]. Core values are defined as those that are of central importance to a social group. Connection is presumably of central importance to most groups, but so are other values such as achievement [89]. Our findings are thus compatible with the core values theory of feeling moved but do not provide evidence that values other than connection contribute to being moved by music. Our paradigm could be used to assess perceived skill or virtuosity of the musicians and study its cross-correlation with feeling moved. According to core values theory, there should be a positive cross-correlation to the extent that being a skillful musician is seen as an admirable value in that cultural context.\n\nFinally, aesthetic trinity theory [18, 19] conceptualizes feeling moved as a highly idiosyncratic response to the sublime, and chills as a more frequent response to music. Our results lend partial support to that theory, as ‘sense of connection’ can refer to connection with the sublime. However, given previous work on music and the sense of connection it conveys (e.g., [90]), we suggest that it mainly refers to social connection perceived between the self and the music or between agents perceived in the music. Furthermore, we found high inter-rater agreements for all scales. The ICC for sense of connection was .84 or higher for all musical excerpts studied, suggesting that there was high interpersonal agreement on which passages conveyed more connection than others. This suggests that the experience of feeling moved by music can be reliably evoked by the same musical passages across participants. It is worth noting that we had chosen these excerpts to be moving. Other musical pieces can be expected to result in lower inter-rater agreements, and thus more idiosyncratic experiences of feeling moved. Still, our findings suggest that feeling moved can be reliably evoked by particular musical features, independent of individual recollections and associations.\n\nAcoustic correlates of feeling moved\n\nOur exploratory analysis of the acoustic and musical correlates of continuous ratings of feeling moved or touched revealed a pattern of acoustic correlates for the joyfully moving excerpts, while no consistent patterns were observed for the sadly moving excerpts. Continuous ratings of feeling moved or touched correlated positively and significantly with loudness (rms energy) in the case of all joyfully moving excerpts. For three of the four joyful excerpts, feeling moved or touched also correlated with spectral roughness (or sensory dissonance). In the case of the excerpts used in the present study, higher values in this feature likely correspond to increased complexity of the spectral content, reflecting multiple instruments sounding together. For two of the joyful excerpts, Hoppipolla and Vltava, feeling moved or touched also correlated positively with spectral flux. Previous work investigating the acoustic correlates of felt and perceived emotions in music has associated loudness, spectral flux and roughness with the arousal dimension of affect (e.g., [91, 92]). It may be that, at least in the case of joyfully moving music, arousal-related musical features contribute to feeling moved by increasing felt arousal.\n\nHowever, in the case of the sadly moving excerpts, feeling moved or touched only correlated significantly with zero-crossing rate and spectral entropy, and only in the case of one excerpt—Allegri. Zero-crossing rate generally reflects rapid fluctuations in the temporal domain and has been broadly used as a feature to detect the presence of vocals or voice-like sounds and voice activity [93, 94]. Specifically, sustained sounds tend to have greater zero-crossing rate than percussive sounds. Allegri is characterized mainly by sustained vocals, while Vltava and Oblivion are dominated by string-instruments that carry the melody in a continuous fashion.\n\nOverall, it is possible that arousal is less important for feeling moved evoked by sad (compared to joyful) music, but future studies should specifically investigate whether feeling moved by sad versus joyful music is associated with different levels of psychophysiological arousal. On the other hand, timbre or choice of instruments might be more important for feeling moved by sad music [95]. Moreover, several studies have emphasized the importance of lyrics especially in sad music contributing to feeling moved [96]. This warrants further study.\n\nImportantly, the current findings are based on a small number of musical excerpts so caution should be applied when interpreting these findings, especially regarding the inconsistent results for sadly moving excerpts. In addition, since continuous ratings of feeling moved cross-correlated strongly with perceived joy and perceived beauty, it is possible that the observed acoustic features are not specific to feeling moved, but rather reflect co-occurrences with other evaluations or experiences. Altogether, we observed correlational evidence that can guide future studies in experimentally investigating different musical aspects and measuring ratings of feeling moved (e.g., [39]).\n\nTrait empathy and feeling moved by music\n\nFinally, we explored individual differences in feeling moved or touched by music. Empathic concern, the tendency to respond sympathetically to others in need [57], correlated positively with mean feeling moved or touched ratings in the case of both joyfully and sadly moving excerpts. This finding corroborates and extends previous work that has associated empathic concern with feeling moved or kama muta in response to videos, sad music, and other stimuli [7, 52, 58]. In an auxiliary analysis, we also found that empathic concern was associated with higher peaks of feeling moved—though only for two joyfully moving musical pieces, which should be interpreted with caution.\n\nRecent studies found that empathic concern was the only subscale of trait empathy (as assessed by the IRI; Davis [57]) that was consistently associated with feeling moved (as well as reported tears, chills, and warmth) in response to videos and written narratives [5, 58]. The present findings suggest that a similar relationship exists for the case of music. Zickfeld et al. [58] argued that state empathic concern could be considered as a special case of intensifications of communal sharing and thereby a type of feeling moved or kama muta. Such a relationship could explain the cross-correlation of feeling moved with perceived sadness. Perceiving someone in need can be evaluated and experienced as negative or also sad, whereas sympathizing with the needy person can be considered as intensifying one’s communal bonds, thereby inducing feeling moved [58]. How this relates to the context of music is less clear, although recent work suggests that listeners may experience feelings of compassion when listening to sad music [84]. The current results suggest an important role of empathic processes in emotional responses to moving music (see [83, 84]), and are in line with the view of musical experience as inherently social (e.g., [36]). Previous studies have argued that empathic engagement with music could take the form of resonating with the expressions and imagined experiences of the performer or the composer (e.g., [27]), or identifying with an imagined narrative or a virtual persona represented by the music [97].\n\nFantasy, the ability to transpose oneself into fictional situations or stories, another facet of trait empathy that we assessed [57], has previously been associated with feeling moved by sad music [7, 52]. However, in the present study, fantasy only showed stronger correlations with ratings of feeling moved or touched in response to joyful music, but less so in response to sad music. One difference between the previous studies versus the current study is that we averaged all feeling moved ratings across the whole time series, whereas previous studies used a summary rating of feeling moved after listening to the piece. Thus, it may be that individuals with higher levels of fantasy are not more moved by sad music throughout, but rather respond more strongly to highly moving passages, which may be better reflected in their own summary judgement rather than in averaging across the whole piece. Furthermore, they may remember these peak moments better than people lower in fantasy, or reconstruct the piece as more moving when asked about it in retrospect, thus providing a higher rating. By systematically comparing continuous with summary ratings, future research can directly test these propositions and quantify the contribution of traits, musical features and memory processes to ratings of feeling moved or touched.\n\nLimitations and future directions\n\nAn obvious limitation of the present study is that only seven music excerpts were used as stimuli. However, this aspect of the experiment design was closely tied to the constraints of the continuous rating paradigm. This limitation is particularly relevant for the analysis of the acoustic and musical features contributing to feeling moved, since the pattern of results may be specific to the particular music excerpts. It is likely that the acoustic and musical characteristics associated with feeling moved vary somewhat from piece to piece, and thus our findings reflect only a part of the entire picture. Moreover, the musical features that were explored in the present study do not represent an exhaustive selection of possible musical features, and thus there may be other, additional musical or acoustic features that contribute to feeling moved or touched. It is also likely that the relationship between musical features and perceptual ratings is non-linear, limiting the explanatory power of linear analysis methods such as those used in the present study. Similarly, we observed higher heterogeneity in effects for the sadly moving excerpts in comparison to the happily moving excerpts. This was mostly driven by Oblivion that typically showed smaller effects than the other two sadly moving excerpts, but sometimes even the opposite as for example for the relationship between feeling moved or touched and warmth in the chest. It is unclear whether that particular excerpt represents a more prototypical or more atypical version of the category of sadly moving music. Future studies employing a larger stimulus pool could remedy this shortcoming.\n\nThe generalizability of the current findings hinges not only on the limited stimulus pool, but also on the employed sample. Amazon MTurk participants have been repeatedly criticized for providing low-quality data because they do not invest sufficient effort, are non-naive, and less trustworthy (e.g., [98]). However, the evidence for these claims seems to be rather mixed and dependent on specific situations [99]. Hauser et al. [99] highlight that high-quality data can be collected from MTurk, given specific research designs and an increased focus on attention checks. In the present study, we employed several attention checks and tried to make sure that participants understood the main task in order to avoid the possible pitfalls associated with MTurk participants. The fact that we replicated the main findings from a previous study using a similar paradigm [53] also speaks to the validity of our results. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that conclusions beyond the present sample and also regarding possible cross-cultural differences in being moved responses (see [5]) are necessarily limited.\n\nHowever, our findings are an important first step towards understanding the contributing musical features, as well as the extent to which these may vary between sadly and joyfully moving music. Future studies could investigate the contributing features in a larger and more varied set of music examples and more diverse cross-cultural populations. A possibility for targeting such larger stimuli sets could be to instruct participants to self-select moving music (e.g., [43, 100]). While such a design minimizes the control over the stimulus material, it would be interesting to see whether the current findings replicate when employing such a technique. Furthermore, other types of analyses and experiments might shed more light on the musical cues and appraisals that are associated with feeling moved. For example, is feeling moved dependent on experiencing music as conveying prosocial intentions, or perceiving musical events in terms of prosocial interactions between agents (cf. [8])?\n\nAnother limitation is related to the continuous rating paradigm itself, where the participants are asked to continuously monitor their subjective experience and adjust their ratings accordingly. It may be that the additional cognitive load of monitoring one’s internal states might detract from the intensity of the experience itself. We tried to mitigate the potential effects of this possibility by having participants only use one continuous scale per excerpt, and by using a Likert-type scale with 5 steps rather than a visual analogue slider, for example, making it less likely for participants to have to constantly adjust their rating. A complementary approach for future investigations could be to measure psychophysiological responses with and without continuous ratings, for example, in order to obtain an additional index of emotional arousal. This could also help with identifying peaks in physiological arousal, and whether these coincide with self-reported emotional peaks. Based on our design we were not able to assess intra-individual processes, as participants never rated more than one scale for the same musical piece. All presented comparisons were made on an inter-individual level. While it is intriguing to see the amount of convergence for averaged ratings of different individuals for the same musical excerpt, this approach might have overestimated correlations among the different ratings, as within error variance remains undetected.\n\nWe also included two musical excerpts that featured vocals. While none of the participants were proficient in the depicted languages, the human voice is known to transport specific emotions as well as empathy (e.g., [101]). Nevertheless, the two vocal pieces showed similar results as the instrumental excerpts. In addition, we assessed perceived joy and sadness in the music, and not experienced joy and sadness induced by the music. Previous studies [7] and our pilot study suggested that ratings of perceived and experienced emotions in music correlate highly. Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that our measures only allow for indirect inferences about participants’ experiences of joy and sadness.\n\nFinally, in contrast to previous studies employing dichotomous ratings (e.g., [43]) we measured subjective chills using a continuous scale (based on Schubert et al. [53]). This was done in order to assess different intensities of chills or goosebumps. Importantly, we might therefore consider responses that would not be classified as chills responses with dichotomous rating paradigms. This is also obvious in the rather long average duration of chills ratings above the lowest scale point, suggesting that we not only covered peak-states but also lower intensities of subjective chills. Overall, we replicated associations between chills and different variables such as feeling moved, pointing to the validity of this measure. Notably, previous studies also differ in the reported average length of chills responses [43, 102], which is probably related to different methodologies and the exact operationalization of the phenomenon (i.e., as chills, goosebumps, or thrills). It is possible that for example thrills refer to a higher intensity response than goosebumps or that several short chill episodes occurring in quick succession are perceived as one longer response. A more standardized definition of the phenomenon of chills (see [44]) would be helpful in comparing different findings and evaluating the degree to which they investigate the same phenomenon."
