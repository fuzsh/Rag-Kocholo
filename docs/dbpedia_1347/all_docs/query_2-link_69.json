It also seems like perfect driving music, be it hurtling down the highway at noon, or cruising through the city at night.\n\nI also want to note that it would not be out of place in a Dynasty Warriors game at all! Anyway, let's have a look at other versions.\n\nThis is from YouTube user JillxxxValentineRE1 and I just want to say - he is phenomenal and has a huge amount of talent. This version rocks even more than the original.\n\nI can honestly say I'm not the world's biggest dubstep fan, but Lukeff7 has done a good job here. This wouldn't sound out of place in a CyberPunk environment and is well worth a listen.\n\nSo to recap:\n\n9. Snow\n\n10. Bartz\n\nWhat do you think of Snow, and Snow's theme? I obviously would've plumped for the incredible Blinded By Light, just as I might've gone for Battle on the Big Bridge for V's offering, but I don't think they count!"
