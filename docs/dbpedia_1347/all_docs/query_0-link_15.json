        "text": "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth contains 8 Piano Songs. Finding the first 6 Piano Song Sheet Music Locations and getting at least A-Rank to receive Remuneration is needed for the Piano Virtuoso trophy. The last two songs are not needed. A-Rank is the second highest rank. S-Rank, which is the highest rank, is not required for any trophies.\n\nEach Piano Song is found on a Piano in a town or village. Sit down at the Piano and press Touchpad to select any song you collected. Next to the Pianos you will find a man called Dorian. After you achieved A-Rank, talk to him to receive a reward. This is what counts as “remuneration”. After getting A-Rank on all 6 songs talk to him again, this triggers a cutscene and Dorian gives you the 7th sheet music, after which the trophy unlocks. Completing the 7th sheet music given by Dorian is not needed for the trophy. The 8th sheet music from completing Johnny’s Treasure Trove is also not needed.\n\nThis is rhythm minigame where you must press the left and right stick to play notes on the piano. The notes will show as yellow rings, you must tilt the stick at the last moment in the correct direction for it to count as “Great”. If you tilt the stick too early it will count as “Good” or “Bad” which will give a lower score. A-Rank requires getting roughly 90% “Great”. Missing a few notes is fine. There is a big learning curve initially to practice the timing. For S-Rank you’d need 100% “Great” without any Good/Bad/Misses, but luckily this isn’t needed for any trophies.\n\nNone of the Piano Songs are missable. After the story you unlock Chapter Select to go back everywhere. All of these collectibles are still available at the start of Chapter 13 via Chapter Select.\n\nPiano Song Sheet Music Locations\n\nPiano Song #1: On Our Way (A-Rank Score: 12,600)\n\nChapter 4 / Location: Junon Region > Crow’s Nest – On the piano inside the Base Camp Building in Crow’s Nest. This is a settlement found in the east of Junon region. You go there as part of Side Quest: When Words Won’t Do.\n\nPiano Song #2: Tifa’s Theme (A-Rank Score: 12,300)\n\nChapter 6 / Location: Corel Region > Costa del Sol – On the piano at The Royal Crown Hotel. You will automatically pick it up as part of main objective “Royal Coast Concert”, while playing as Tifa/Aerith. This can’t be missed. Dorian won’t be present in Chapter 6 so you can’t get the reward until his next spawn point at the third piano song. If you don’t get A-Rank here don’t worry, you can replay the song at any piano later.\n\nPiano Song #3: Barret’s Theme (A-Rank Score: 9,300)\n\nChapter 7 / Location: Corel Region > North Corel village – After going through Mt. Corel in the story, you will reach a settlement as part of the story. Go upstairs and into the bar, there you find this on the piano.\n\nPiano Song #4: Cinco de Chocobo (A-Rank Score: 12,300)\n\nChapter 9 / Location: Gongaga Region > Gongaga Village > Laurel Hill – In Chapter 9 you will automatically reach Gongaga village as part of the story. In this village check the building south of Memorial Hill to find this on the piano.\n\nPiano Song #5: Two Legs? Nothin’ To It (A-Rank Score: 17,400)\n\nChapter 10 / Location: Cosmo Canyon Region > Cosmo Canyon village > Water Grotto – As part of the story you will automatically reach Cosmo Canyon Village. There you find this inside the Inn on the piano.\n\nPiano Song #6: Aerith’s Theme (A-Rank Score: 12,100)\n\nChapter 11 – Location: Nibel Region – Reward from Side Quest: My White-Haired Angel. Accepted from the woman in the house in the north-east of Nibelheim village, only available after reaching the end of Chapter 11 and reaching Objective “Smoke Sent Up”.\n\nPiano Song #7: Let the Battles Begin! (Not needed for Trophy)\n\nReward for completing the first 6 Piano Songs with at least A-Rank. This will trigger a cutscene, afterward Dorian gives you the 7th sheet music as a reward. This isn’t needed for any trophies and can be skipped.\n\nPiano Song #8: One-Winged Angel (Not needed for Trophy)\n\nReward for completing all 88 of Johnny’s Treasure Trove Items (100% game completion reward). Refer to Johnny’s Inn Treasure Trove Item Locations. This piano song is the hardest one in the game but it’s not needed for any trophies so can be skipped.\n\nThat’s all of the Piano Songs in FF7 Rebirth."
