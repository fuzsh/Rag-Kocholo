        "text": "The Final Fantasy XIV music team has long been respected for providing absolute bangers throughout every expansion soundtrack, and Dawntrail is not an exception. Between the unique vocal themes for the first portion of Arcadion, the trial boss themes and dungeon tracks, and even the yee-haw strums of Shaaloani’s zone music, there’s a lot to like here. And you can experience it yourself on demand when the expansion soundtrack is released on October 30th on blu-ray music disc.\n\nThe full soundtrack features 66 tracks (yes, including the first portion of the Arcadion) and also comes with a Wind-up Zero minion to follow you around in-game. (Which is a bit odd, perhaps, as Zero isn’t actually in Dawntrail.) There are also going to be three digital releases for selections from the soundtrack, with the first set live today and the subsequent selections going live on August 13th and August 20th. If these are the tunes you want to rock out to, best get ready to listen to them in official releases."
