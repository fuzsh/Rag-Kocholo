That is, what music makes you feel how?\n\nI got my new speakers for my computer last week, a great enhancement from my previous, and I'm listening to Górecki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs at loud volume and it chills me to the bone. At one point my eyes were near tearing up from the intensity of the song, which few things do to me.\n\nKimya Dawson's lyrics also makes me shiver a little because of how sincere they are, and even though I do not necessarily feel the same as her or even know what she's going on about half of the time, there is an unmistakable sense of honesty there that I've never seen so clearly before. I'm not sure how to define that feeling, but it definitely gets my chemicals going.\n\nAlternate topic: How much does music quality matter to you? Are there any types of music where you think quality (for example, good speakers) are more important than otherwise? (Hint: Jazz and Classical)\n\nLoony BoB\n\nI tend to feel how the song 'feels' if you get what I mean. A song like Lose Yourself will get me into a pensive mood, a song like Love Song will make me feel upbeat and a slow song like Brahms' Lullaby will get me sleepy. If I'm in a mood, I'll be wanting some hard rock, moody rap or possibly something with a very large amount of bass. I can actually force my mood to change on some occasions simply by listening to different music.\n\nMomiji\n\n( ﾟ∀ﾟ)彡 えーりん！えーりん！\n\n^_^~\n\nWell, I must say, listening right through Act II, being plot-driven (interesting huh?).\n\nI constantly got goosebumps multiple listens to the final song \"Vital Vessals Vindicate\"~~ at the time I was kinda freaking out because I NEVER break out into cold sweats XD!!\n\nTub Ring's entire \"Zoo Hypothesis\" album has me singsinging along and really getting into the constantly changing genres of music :D\n\n( ﾟ∀ﾟ) 助けて えいりん！\n\n（彡\n\nAnyway, music is a very mood-based thing for me. Some music will get said chemicals flowing at times, and at other times, it won't.\n\nBardTard\n\n\"The Extreme\" from Final Fantasy 8 gets me like, really pumped up every time I listen to it. I don't know any other way to put it.\n\n\"Kettobase!\" by Utada Hikaru makes me feel like I could beat the crap out of someone. Especially the live version.\n\nSMiLE.dk, Shanadoo, Perfume, DJ Satomi and Cascada make me want to dance."
