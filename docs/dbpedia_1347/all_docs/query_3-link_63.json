        "text": "Online practices of musical memory making have proliferated across social media, whether in bespoke blogs, web pages, forums or Facebook groups. In the first part of this paper, we reflect on the manner in which online communities construct memories in such digital non-spaces albeit in and around references to geographically and temporally specific sites of music culture: the CBGB venue of New York, Mabuhay Gardens of San Francisco’s punk scene, Manchester of the 80s, Liverpool of the 60s and so on. We argue how the communities that have formed online and the architecture that enables them can be considered as ‘cultural frames for recollection’ that ‘do not simply invoke but actually help construct collective memory’ (van Dijck, 2006: 358). Elaborating upon our recent work that explores this architecture of online memory and the contexts of popular music culture, we extend our ideas to explore the role of music itself in such sites. We consider how and where musical texts are present but more often absent from such sites and otherwise evoked in discussion as well as in narratives of cultures of music consumption anchored by the posting of ephemera around which are concentrated complex and sentimental values. Central is an exploration of how music, its experience, form and meaning, is evoked in order to understand the role of sounds and lyrics in memory making and its display. We argue how these aspects sometimes escape the ability of communities to fully articulate meaning in any formal sense. Informing this exploration is the idea of affect and the capturing of the emotive, material and physical role of music in memory. The practices we explore raise questions about the nature of memory, the music archive, of history and the heritage recorded in such sites. We argue that, alongside the collection and sharing of music and of associated artifacts, the archive is manifest in the nature of such collective memories forged in online interactions which involves an ongoing negotiating and working through of the significance of venues, individuals, bands moments, and of course – the music itself – in personal and shared pasts and which takes on particular shapes that evoke the everyday discourse of popular music culture and consumption.\n\nThe contemporary ‘memory boom’ described by Andreas Huyssen (2003) comes into view across the field of popular music culture. The music industries have long repackaged and repromoted the music of the past, an enterprise supported in the United Kingdom by a wealth of publications such as Record Collector, Classic Rock, Uncut or Mojo. Likewise, television produces a prodigious amount of nostalgic music retrospectives as well as specialized ‘quality’ programming offering assessments of individual artists, genres and moments (see Long and Wall 2010). To this list, we should add dedicated channels such as VH1 and Vintage TV: ‘a vital, unique offering for those who grew up with the many vintage artists still touring and recording as well as for a younger demographic beginning to appreciate Vintage TV’s “soundtrack to the 20th century”’ (Vintage TV). In addition, popular music has its own sites of special historical interest, from Memphis’ Beale Street to Liverpool’s Strawberry Field, each a destination for a dedicated and expanding tourist industry with music heritage recognized as an increasingly valuable part of the experience economy (Connell and Gibson 2003). Echoing the idea of heritage as a symptom of a contemporary cultural malaise (Hewison 1987), the critic Simon Reynolds has described this range of activity as a form of ‘retromania’, lamenting ‘pop culture’s addiction to its own past’ (2011). To others, this historical purview represents the democratization of the past and the terrain upon which communities might make and take meaning from it. Certainly, the reissue industry has been posited by Paul Martin as a form of public history (Martin 2000; see also Ashton and Kean 2009), while Andy Bennett identifies a form of ‘DIY preservationism’ (2009:475) in which music enthusiasts set up small labels or Internet sites dedicated to salvaging and preserving music outside of familiar canons. Bennett’s description captures also a variety of forms of community archival projects mapped by Sarah Baker and Alison Huber (2013), activity echoed in a wealth of organized online practices devoted to music and memory (Collins and Long 2014). Across this range, practices and meanings of history, heritage, collective memory and archival formation converge, sometimes challenging the traditional parameters of culture and its preservation. Such are the cultural politics of this variety, of who determines what counts, of what is at stake, that Les Roberts and Sara Cohen have formulated a typology of discourses of popular music heritage: officially authorized, self-authorized and unauthorized. For them, popular music heritage can be understood via these categories to be a relational practice that reveals definitions of the past to be a contested and negotiated space ‘ascribed with value, legitimacy and social and cultural capital’ (Roberts and Cohen 2013:243). In this chapter, we are concerned with the flourishing online world of sites devoted to popular music of the past, to its emergence and status as communal heritage and as prompt for memory. Practices in these sites can be understood in terms of Roberts and Cohen’s self-authorized and, more often, unauthorized categories as communities add to, and make what they will of the available material of that which Wolfgang Ernst terms the online anarchive (2013). The extent of the activity only hinted at in this chapter affirms that music matters in the memory of a broad range of people. Thus, we ask: how and why does music matter for so many? In the first part of this chapter, we examine the manner in which online communities construct memories around music in the non-spaces of the digital world. We develop our focus in particular around memory practices that are anchored to geographically and temporally specific sites of popular music culture. These sites comprise the concert venues, clubs and record stores of specific towns and cities that are associated with particular genres and scenes. In the second part of this chapter, we build upon this evidence and discussion in order to consider how we might make sense of music that motivates memory in terms of ideas of affect. We suggest that a useful way of thinking of online memory work is in terms of the evocation of the soundscapes of the past. Participants explore feelings associated with physical spaces, of the records and bands that were encountered in them and indeed, the nature of the communities of practice that were there formed and that ‘reconvene’ to remember.\n\nThe material objects of popular music have featured significantly in studies of popular music. In particular, there are established literature on physical playback media (including the re-emergence of vinyl albums) and playback devices, from the Walkman to the iPod. Recently, as popular music scholars have begun to explore the everyday use of music and music technologies by casual listeners, music has increasingly been described as sound and as an ambient presence in our lives. Yet woven through these increasingly digital cultures are concrete manifestations of music listening and fandom. Drawing on the findings of a three-year Australian Research Council-funded project on popular music and cultural memory, this article considers the implications of such manifestations of materiality for the way we understand the significance of popular music, and its linking of the past and the present, in contemporary everyday life. Using fieldwork data collected in cities across Australia, the article considers how various aspects of popular music-related material culture became palpable objects for the writing of personal histories. In some instances, these material objects of participation were less foregrounded but still present. In these cases, materiality was resigned more to the past, but material cultures were actively digitized and distributed. This process was always ongoing and incomplete. This article examines and develops a central theme emerging from our research findings, namely that popular music objects acquire meanings that raise them above their everyday status via cultural means strongly influenced by the contextualizing effects of online technology.\n\nIt’s difficult to locate the exact starting point of Postmodern Jukebox, as Scott Bradlee acknowledged in a speech to the members of Oxford Union on the 8th of March 2017. Indeed, whilst the first recorded video on the Postmodern Jukebox YouTube channel features a younger Bradlee playing the jazz standard ‘A Night in Tunisia’ (2009a) on keyboard in his living room, it was not until the second video, ‘Classic 80s Hits… Interpreted for Ragtime Piano’ (2009b), that Bradlee initiated what later came to be Postmodern Jukebox’s ‘unique selling point’: covering mainstream late-twentieth and twenty-first century pop music in various ‘retro’ styles. Postmodern Jukebox went on to expand dramatically in size, progressing from a Bradlee and a singer, to a small band, to a loose collective with rotating guest singers, and finally to a group of freelance musicians, known as the ‘PMJ Family’ which is large enough to sustain multiple concurrent global tours. Yet the immense success of Postmodern Jukebox and their global appeal would be inconceivable without digital technologies: it was through the viral success of videos such as ‘Thrift Shop (Vintage ‘Grandpa Style’ Macklemore Cover)’ (2013) and ‘All About That [Upright] Bass’ (2014a) that Postmodern Jukebox was brought to international attention, and these videos remain the primary way through which their fans are first introduced to and consume their content today. The following dissertation aims to explore the effects of digital technologies on music consumption patterns and the socialities thereby engendered amongst British fans of Postmodern Jukebox through a digital ethnography of Postmodern Jukebox’s online presences, semi-structured interviews with Postmodern Jukebox fans, and fieldwork at two separate events: a Postmodern Jukebox concert at Hammersmith Apollo, London, and a talk given by Scott Bradlee at the Oxford Union. In doing so, I will establish three key ideas: (1) the consumption of Postmodern Jukebox’s music and the socialities that are there entailed is mediated not only by technologies of the early 2000s, such as Web 2.0 and the subsequent Social Networking Sites, but also specifically digital features such as the collecting of metadata about cultural products, recommendation algorithms which factor in this metadata; (2) whilst this consumption takes place within Madianou & Miller’s (2013) environment of polymedia, listeners not only choose the platform on, device through and format in which they listen to this music based relational technological affordances and socio-cultural perceptions thereof, but may also decide to ‘disuse’ a given platform based on negative socio-cultural perceptions; and (3) the varying modes or genres of consumption within this environment of polymedia, whilst all modes of ‘fandom’, result in distinct, yet overlapping and concurrent socialities."
