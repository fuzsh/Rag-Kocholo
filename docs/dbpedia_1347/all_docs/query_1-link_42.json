        "text": "Visions of Mana is just weeks away! The first entry in the Mana series in quite some time, we were excited to learn about the game alongside the news that series composer Hiroki Kikuta would be returning to write a portion of the score. We now understand that the score was split three ways, with Kikuta handling cinematic music, Tsuyoshi Sekito handling action and battle music, and Ryo Yamazaki writing exploration and event music. We’ve been able to get a word in with all three composers about their history with the franchise and their experience working on Visions of Mana, including the gear they used for the score.\n\nClick below for the full interview. Continue reading Interview: Visions of Mana Music Team →\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH is out in the wild and everyone’s taking note of the meticulous care the team has taken in re-imagining this definitive RPG. The amount of music written for the game is massive, with eight discs total for the special edition (seven for the standard edition), so when we say it took an army of talent to create it, that’s not an exaggeration.\n\nAt the helm of the score for this second installment is SQUARE ENIX composer Mitsuto Suzuki, who is no stranger to the FINAL FANTASY series, having contributed to FINAL FANTASY XIII-2, LIGHTNING RETURNS FINAL FANTASY XIII, MOBIUS FINAL FANTASY, and FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE. Being a huge fan of his work, and loving the interview series conducted on the SQUARE ENIX MUSIC channel on YouTube, we had a few questions of our own (provided by Scarlet Moon’s Dale North) related to the direction he took, his process, and his gear.\n\nSee what Mitsuto Suzuki has to say below. Continue reading Interview: FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH Lead Composer Mitsuto Suzuki →\n\nThis is the last collection of music we’ll be writing about from Tree of Savior for now. There were some additional releases in 2021 that we may get to at some point. This vocal collection features only five tracks by S.F.A and Initium, and as the title suggests, they are all vocal tracks. You can catch up on our series of Tree of Savior soundtrack reviews here.\n\nThe album opens with “Killer Jesters (Clown Theme),” coming as a chugging metal track with electronic guitar and deep operatic male vocals that becomes a duet with female vocalist as the track progresses. “Aoba (Sadhu Theme)” is a sweet and swaying vocal pop song, while “Escarcero onda (Cryomancer Theme)” is a hip Korean ballad with spacey electronics and wailing electric guitar in the background. “Rondo Miserabile (Psychokino Theme)” is a fun swinging jazz cafe theme with sultry vocals and accordion, and “Lyudmila (Arquebusier Theme)” sports operatic vocals on top of an epic electronic backing, slowly building into something quite powerful.\n\nThe vocal collection is available on Steam.\n\nNearing the end of our journey through all of the additional digital Tree of Savior soundtrack albums, Oriental OST Collection 2020, while not identified as music from Tree of Savior on the album cover, is definitely from Tree of Savior featuring mostly S.F.A but also a few tracks from soundTeMP and Cinenote. As the title suggests, this is largely music featuring ethnic instruments from the region, and is contemplative and soothing in its presentation. If you want to get caught up on our reviews, they can be found here.\n\nThe album opens with “Absolution” with droning bass pads with strings and zither over the top, coming off as foreboding and resolute. It’s then on to the contemplative and sweeping “Bamboo Grove,” the seeping and somber “Farewell,” the driving “Heartstrings” with its rolling percussion, and the airy and floaty “Juvenile Xanadu.” “One Eyes Swordsman” is a change of pace with chugging bass and buzzing saw pad, whereas “Reincarnation” is a bumping electronic track. It’s back to sweet and emotional with “Slower Whisper,” grandiose with “Southwest,” and beautiful piano and bells in “The Sword of Tears.” The album closes out with the dreamy electronics of “A Tale of Wind and Cloud” and the bustling “Tyro Emperor.”\n\nAs always, you can find the Oriental OST Collection 2020 release on YouTube and Steam.\n\nWe’re nearing the end of our journey through the Tree of Savior add-on digital soundtracks. “Splash August 2020” is appropriately upbeat and poppy, making for great summer vibes. Catch the rest of our Tree of Savior reviews here.\n\nThis collection features almost exclusively S.F.A minus two tracks, and the total run-time is about an hour. The album opens with party-like “Samba de Seoul” with the sound of ocean waves kicking things off, followed by the entrancing and dreamy vocals of “Pristine EDM mixed,” the uplifting funk rock in “Vent,” and the emotional and contemplative “Pintura Cueva.” “Fiesta Bloom” offers uplifting and pop-infused trance, “The Wisdom of Crowds” goes disco, and “Sweet Poison” (by soundTemP) is a pumping electronic track. There’s electronic chip orchestra with Baroque harpsichord and strings with “Homage to Zborovye,” decisive and epic orchestral with “Avoidance,” Hollywood western in “In My Dreams,” and the sound of birds and waves in the island-flavored “Summer Breeze” to close things out.\n\nThis is a nice assortment of tunes that can be heard on YouTube and Steam.\n\nThis time we take a look at the “Silent” July 2020 soundtrack release for Tree of Savior. Fortunately it’s not silent, although it is a lot more mellow than other releases. You can catch up with all the Tree of Savior reviews here.\n\nThe album opens with acoustic guitar and male operatic vocals in “Deives Velliava” before moving on to the aptly titled “Sad feelings” with somber strings and piano, the powerful and moving “Snow Hill,” and the reflective “Beautiful Than Flowers.” There’s a lovely music box track with “DayDream,” the contemplative and frosty “Consistency,” the somber-yet-hip “Eclipsed Road,” the sweeping “Orsha,” and the more pop-flavored “Amaranto.” “Milden Miles” adds dancy piano to melancholy strings, “Journey in Heaven” sports angelic choir and funky bass, “November Rain” comes as a relaxing flamenco style track, and “Tiger Cherish” is a powerful and lovely English ballad.\n\nIn all, the “Silent” collection differentiates itself quite nicely and is available on YouTube and Steam.\n\nOnward to the “Nostalgic” September 2020 music collection from Tree of Savior. This volume features S.F.A artists, Initium, and more soundTemP. You can catch up on all the Tree of Savior soundtrack reviews here.\n\nPerhaps the “nostalgia” in this collections’ title comes from the sort of classic South Korean MMORPG soundtrack that hearkens back to the Vol.1 release, replete with vocals throughout, opening with the amazing opener, “iKURU,” a lovely and warm J-rock track. It’s then onto more grandiose orchestral rock with “Dienos Advento,” the decisive vocal ballad “Through the Forest,” and the beautiful and dark “Guillotina Tristeza,” all with female vocals. There’s the desperate “La Patria,” the funky “The Dignity of Wrath” and “Bodacious definition,” and the sweeping and emotional “Massivity.” The team goes huge with “Vaste Terre,” an orchestral rock track, while “Signs of Penance” goes full electronic, “Even Horizon” gets an adventurous orchestral sound, and “Uno Impetus” is a catchy Megadeth-like tune. SoundTeMP’s lone contribution, “World is Missing You,” is soothing and beautiful with sweetly strummed acoustic guitar and, let’s say, nostalgic woodwinds. The album closes with “Deives Veliava,” a big female vocal performance over piano and strings.\n\nThe Nostalgic September 2020 collection is available on Steam.\n\nWe look back to the Tree of Savior May 2020 music collection featuring S.F.A and Initium. It proves to be another eclectic collection of music that spans romantic orchestral, metal, western, electronic, and vocal music. Check out our past reviews of Tree of Savior releases here.\n\nThe May collection opens with the romantic adventure, “Alma Generosa,” and is followed by the cool and dangerous “Beyond the Fashion,” the bombastic “Chance to Catch,” and the vocal pop tune, “Decide my Way.” There’s comical metal with gritty male vocals in English with “Exorcism,” smooth funk in “Groove of the Sea,” and a beautiful piano and vocal ballad in “Immortal.” “Nueve” goes for a more tragic sound, while “Open Po10” and “Ra Reina” both get a Hollywood western sound. “TOS Colony” pairs shredding guitars with violin, while “UNITogether” is a special J-pop theme featuring vocals by Tsukasa Uchiyama.\n\nYou can check out the May 2020 soundtrack collection on YouTube and Steam.\n\n[EDITOR’S NOTE: We’ve been fortunate to have been in touch with game music enthusiast Michael Kobzik about interviews conducted with videogame composers, and have agreed to partner to publish them on the Scarlet Moon blog. What better way to start than with an extensive interview looking at Scarlet Moon Artists composer Osamu Kubtota’s storied career! Enjoy. – Jayson]\n\nOsamu Kubota is a legendary composer with a long, storied career. He’s most famous for his work in Konami’s BEMANI sound division, though his career before and after is similarly impressive. We found some time to speak with Osamu Kubota about his long career and recent work.\n\nContinue reading Interview: Career Retrospective with Osamu Kubota →\n\nWe continue on in our look at all the digital collections of music from Tree of Savior, this time into the similarly eclectic but also perhaps more moodier “Halloween” themed tunes with the October 2020 collection. For reference, you can read our review of the Tree of Savior Original Soundtrack Vol.1 here.\n\nThis collection opens with the sleek electronic “Luna Whispering” by S.F.A, sporting electric piano and Korean pop vocals. It’s then on to the somber “Whisper of Moment,” the dreamy “Where is the silence,” the powerful vocal ballad “Oath of the Crusader,” and the adventurous orchestral tune “Initium.” “Armageddon” is appropriately explosive with “Paragras Eina” sports male choir on metal and “Valodoras” closes us out with beautiful strings and piano.\n\nI imagine many listeners will be interested in soundTeMP’s contributions, and they do not disappoint. The cool-yet-melancholy “Sirius” is their first contribution, followed by the trance-infused “Boy’s Anthem,” and the TeMPtastic “Exotica,” a catchy theme that is moody and groovy right out of the desert.\n\nThe moody October collection is available on Steam."
