        "text": "“Which FINAL FANTASY game should I start with?”\n\nIt’s one of the most common questions we see from people yet to dive into the series, and a hotly debated topic online - ask five fans and you’re likely to get five different answers.\n\nThe actual ‘correct’ answer, of course, is… any of them. After all, almost every game in the series acts as a standalone adventure with its own distinct world, characters and even gameplay mechanics. There really isn’t a wrong or right place to start.\n\nBut we also realize that’s not particularly helpful for new players, who have a lot of options available - particularly with re-releases and new FINAL FANTASY pixel remaster series.\n\nSo to lend a hand, we’ll run through the mainline FINAL FANTASY games that are available and give you a sense of what to expect from each adventure.\n\nThen, you can simply choose the game that most appeals most to you - we’re confident that whichever you pick, you’ll have a good time.\n\nFINAL FANTASY pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC / iOS / Android\n\nThis is the game that started it all - and it’s better than ever in the pixel remaster edition.\n\nFINAL FANTASY follows the Warriors of Light, who set off on a quest to defeat four fiends and restore their tainted crystals back to their former glory.\n\nIt may be the first, but it immediately established many of the elements that would come to define the series - vast, sprawling worlds, deep strategic combat (turn-based in this case), creative character and enemy designs and sublime music.\n\nThe pixel remaster edition updates the game with amazing new 2D art, quality of life features, such as auto-battle, and a rearranged soundtrack that’s just… *chef’s kiss.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want to see where the FINAL FANTASY series began\n\nYou want to play a traditional Japanese RPG with turn-based battles\n\nYou also want to play STRANGER OF PARADISE FINAL FANTASY ORIGIN - it directly connects to this game\n\nFINAL FANTASY II pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC / iOS / Android\n\nThe second FINAL FANTASY game focuses on four war-orphaned heroes: Firion, Maria, Guy and Leon. The group becomes embroiled in a conflict between the hostile Empire of Palamecia and the rebel resistance, with the fate of the whole world hanging in the balance.\n\nCombat is once again turn-based, but even in this early stage, FINAL FANTASY was a series that innovated. Rather than sticking with traditional leveling, FINAL FANTASY II introduced a new proficiency system, in which characters’ skill with weapons and abilities increased the more they used them.\n\nThe pixel remaster offers the definitive way to play this classic RPG. As with the other pixel remaster games, it features new 2D art that’s beautiful in HD, a rearranged soundtrack and more!\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou’ve played RPGs before and are looking for something unconventional\n\nYou’re excited to see one of the more experimental games in the series\n\nYou want to see the origin of Chocobos! The iconic birds make their first appearance in this game.\n\nFINAL FANTASY III pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC / iOS / Android\n\nWhen darkness falls and the land is robbed of light, four young heroes are chosen by the crystals to head off an exciting journey across a vast and hostile land.\n\nThis critically acclaimed entry in the series introduced a flexible job system, which lets characters change their roles in combat at any time. It was also the first to introduce powerful summons, including series mainstays Bahamut and Shiva.\n\nThe pixel remaster edition is out now, and brings with it a number of improvements to the original game, including new visuals, new music and more.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want to play an RPG that has a lot of strategic depth\n\nYou like having a lot of control over your characters and party composition\n\nYou relish a challenge - FINAL FANTASY III is one of the tougher games in the series\n\nFINAL FANTASY IV pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC / iOS / Android\n\nFINAL FANTASY IV innovated once again, with the deepest narrative and most beloved characters in the series so far.\n\nAfter questioning some troubling orders from his King, the dark knight Cecil is demoted and sent on a simple delivery job with his friend Kain. The shocking events that follow send Cecil and a group of heroes on a dramatic journey of betrayal, love and redemption.\n\nAs well as delivering one of the most powerful stories in the series, FINAL FANTASY IV was the first game to feature the Active Time Battle system, which combined turn-based and real-time elements together to create a faster, but equally strategic, battle system.\n\nIt was already a true classic, but the pixel remaster makes it even better, thanks to its new visuals, music and gameplay features.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou love games with a strong story\n\nYou want to meet some of the best characters in the series\n\nYou enjoy fast, dynamic battles\n\nFINAL FANTASY V pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC / iOS / Android\n\nThe world of FINAL FANTASY V is reliant on elemental crystals with the power of earth, water, fire and wind. These crystals bring life to and prosperity, but they have lost their power and are on the verge of destruction.\n\nFour characters are driven together by fate: Bartz, Princess Lenna of Castle Tycoon, the pirate captain Faris and the deeply mysterious Galuf. Together, they embark on a journey to save the planet.\n\nAs with its predecessor, FINAL FANTASY V features the ATB battle system, but expands the possibilities dramatically with an incredibly deep and flexible new class system that lets you customize your characters with 26 unique jobs.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou enjoy battle systems with a lot of depth\n\nYou want as many options as possible in how you build your party\n\nYou like to laugh - FINAL FANTASY V is one of the funniest games in the series\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI pixel remaster\n\nAvailable on: PC, iOS, Android (coming soon)\n\nFINAL FANTASY VI is one of the most popular entries in the FINAL FANTASY series - acclaimed by fans and critics alike.\n\nThis game introduced several interesting ideas, including a story with strong characters, but no central protagonist - each member of the party gets their own moment center stage and you can choose who to control for much of the game.\n\nIt’s set in a world where magic has vanished, and humankind has embraced the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines and other technologies. But one still does have the power of magic - a young woman named Terra, who is enslaved by the evil Empire.\n\nAn encounter with an Esper - an ancient being of incredible power - frees Terra from the Empire’s clutches and sets off a chain of events that touches countless lives, and leads to epic and terrible consequences.\n\nAnd, of course we should mention that FINAL FANTASY VI features Kefka - regarded by many as one of the greatest villains of all time…\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want to start with one of the most critically acclaimed games in the series\n\nYou like games with memorable villains\n\nYou like surprises - this game goes places you may not expect…\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII\n\nAvailable on: Switch / PS4 / Xbox One / PC / iOS / Android\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII changed the face of gaming forever.\n\nIt’s inspired a legion of fans thanks to its epic story, legendary characters and unsurpassed presentation. It’s gone on to inspire spin-offs, movies and even a full-blown remake.\n\nThe story starts in Midgar, a city controlled by Shinra Inc - a less than ethical multi-conglomerate that is absorbing Mako energy and destroying the natural resources of the planet.\n\nCloud, a former member of Shinra’s elite SOLDIER unit, joins AVALANCHE in a daring mission to bomb one of the city’s reactors, but in the chaos that follows, he makes a discovery that will change his life, and the world, forever.\n\nThe game also made waves with its cinematic presentation and innovative Materia system that essentially lets you slot abilities and magic into armor - this allows for an incredible level of flexibility in how you set up the party.\n\nThe version available now on current platforms features a number of useful features, including the ability to speed up time, turn off random encounters or even boost your characters to full health.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want an adventure with unforgettable characters\n\nYou want an easy-to-understand combat system that has a lot of depth\n\nYou want to understand what all the hype is about\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE\n\nAvailable on: PS5 / PS4 / PC\n\nThe most recent game in the series reimagines FINAL FANTASY VII and the iconic city of Midgar for modern platforms.\n\nThe story follows the same storyline as the original game up to the party’s escape from the city but the game uses the increased fidelity and scale to deepen the already-beloved characters, add new scenarios and even additional story elements.\n\nThe battle system is especially noteworthy, fusing real-time action with menu-based commands to create something that’s exciting, fast-paced and agreeably strategic.\n\nAdd in amazing minigames (Motorcycle battles! Dance offs! Competitive squatting!), loads of side quests, battles and challenges to complete, stunning graphics and a truly incredible soundtrack and you have one of the greatest games in the series to date.\n\nLet’s just say there’s a reason it won ‘Best RPG’ in the 2020 Game Awards.\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE is available both standalone and in a Twin Pack, which also includes next entry in the trilogy, FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH! It’s more cost-effective than buying each game separately so if you want both of these amazing games, it’s the way to go:\n\nGet FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE and REBIRTH Twin Pack\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want an exciting story that’s full of very memorable moments and characters\n\nYou want an amazing combat system that fuses real-time action and command-based strategy\n\nYou want to see jaw-dropping visuals - this game is beautiful\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH\n\nAvailable on: PS5\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH expands on REMAKE with a bigger world to explore, masses of side content and even more options in combat. Although it’s the second game in the FINAL FANTASY VII remake trilogy, it’s designed to be welcoming to new players.\n\nThe story sees Cloud Strife and his allies travel across the world in pursuit of the sinister Sephiroth. You’ll see how this iconic antagonist fell to darkness, help the heroes face their tragic pasts and enjoy an epic journey that’s exciting, funny and dramatic in equal measure.\n\nThe excellent battle system that debuted in FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE has been expanded - now characters can combine their skills to deal devastating (and visually spectacular) Synergy attacks, for example - and there’s so much to see and do that it’ll make your head spin. Amazing side content, fun minigames and more await.\n\nAnd we have to give special mention to Queen’s Blood - a fully featured card game that lives within the game. It’s fun, it’s tactical and it even has its own story, should you wish to engage with it!\n\nFINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH is, in short, an amazing game - and a fabulous first FINAL FANTASY game.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want to play one of the most critically-acclaimed games in the series history - check out the amazing reviews!\n\nYou want to experience the incredible story that changed gaming forever in a fresh, modern style\n\nYou want variety - this game is stuffed full of things to do: combat, side content, card games, chocobo racing, animal soccer, shooting galleries… and so much more!\n\nFINAL FANTASY VIII Remastered\n\nAvailable on: Switch / PS4 / Xbox One / PC / iOS / Android\n\nIn FINAL FANTASY VIII, the militarized nation of Galbadia has formed an alliance with the Sorceress Edea and is making a bid for world conquest.\n\nAmid the conflict, Squall Leonhart and a group of fellow students from Balamb Garden’s mercenary force, SeeD, are dispatched into action. But Squall’s universe it turned upside down when he meets the free-spirited Rinoa Heartilly and starts to dream that he is a Galbadian soldier named Laguna Loire…\n\nFINAL FANTASY VIII upped the ante with presentation once again, with more detailed characters models, jaw-dropping cinematics and one of the most adored soundtracks in the series.\n\nIt also innovated in terms of gameplay, with more real-time elements like timed button presses to enhance damage in combat, and the strategically deep ‘Junction’ system, which lets you enhance your party’s stats with magic. Also, it featured the card game Triple Triad - one of the best mini-games in the series to date!\n\nFINAL FANTASY VIII Remastered is out now for Switch, PS4, Xbox One and Steam. It's an updated version of the game with enhanced visuals, and useful boosters, such as the ability to speed up time.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou have a soft spot for romance\n\nYou want to see some of the most impressive cinematics in the series\n\nYou like card games - Triple Triad is great!\n\nFINAL FANTASY IX\n\nAvailable on: Switch / PS4 / Xbox One/ PC / iOS / Android\n\nFINAL FANTASY IX is an epic story of love, war and betrayal.

Before long Garnet, her personal guard Steiner, have joined Zidane and a colorful cast of misfits, including Vivi, Freya and Quina, on an unforgettable journey across a dangerous land.\n\nThis game marks a return to the series traditional fantasy roots, after the sci-fi inspired worlds of the prior two games. More than that, it operates as a love letter to the FINAL FANTASY series as a whole. The game contains lots of references that serve to reward series veterans, while introducing many elements of the franchise to newcomers.\n\nPlay this first if:\n\nYou want a charming, light-hearted story and characters\n\nYou want a gentle introduction to all the iconic elements of the series\n\nYou prefer fantasy settings over science fiction\n\nFINAL FANTASY X HD Remaster\n\nAvailable on: Switch / PS4 / Xbox One / PC\n\nFINAL FANTASY X tells the story of Tidus - a talented blitzball player, who journeys with a young summoner named Yuna on a quest to save the world of Spira from an endless cycle of destruction wrought by the colossal menace Sin.\n\nThe game features exciting turn-based battles and introduced the sphere grid system of character progression.\n\nRather than characters levelling up automatically as in prior games, in FINAL FANTASY X, you manually build their stats and abilities by inserting orbs into a massive grid. It’s very simple system to use, but it gives you greater control over how your party develops than many of the older games.\n\nFINAL FANTASY X|X-2 HD Remaster is available now, and updates the game with high-definition visuals, and a remastered soundtrack. The collection also includes the sequel FINAL FANTASY X-2 - a memorable game in its own right - as well bonus material and extras.\n\nPlay this first if:\n\nYou want to play one of the most popular and successful games in the series\n\nYou want a battle system that’s fast-paced, turn-based and tactical\n\nYou also want to play its sequel FINAL FANTASY X|X-2 - it’s included in FINAL FANTASY X|X-2 HD Remaster\n\nFINAL FANTASY XI\n\nAvailable on: PC\n\nFINAL FANTASY XI was even more of a departure for the series - rather than an epic single player adventure, the game was a massively multiplayer online RPG (MMORPG). Still pretty epic though.\n\nIt’s set in the vast world of Vana'diel, and allows players team up to battle, explore, chat and trade their way through a huge number of quests, full of drama and intrigue.\n\nWith the game set to celebrate its 20th anniversary soon, it's clear that this game has staying power!\n\nPlay this first if:\n\nIf you want to play a traditional old-school MMORPG\n\nYou like having a vast world to explore and lots of things to do\n\nYou have friends who play the game, and can join you on quests\n\nFINAL FANTASY XII THE ZODIAC AGE\n\nAvailable on: Switch / PS4 / Xbox One / PC\n\nThe world of Ivalice is at war.

It also features improved HD visuals, a remastered soundtrack and the ability to speed up time.\n\nPlay this first if:\n\nYou want your fantasy to be full of large scale and full of political intrigue.

It also introduced popular characters like Lightning and spawned two direct sequels.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIII (and its sequels) can be played on PC and Xbox One via backward compatibility.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou’d prefer a more guided RPG than others in the series\n\nYou like your games with an ensemble cast of characters\n\nYou like a combat system that’s strategic and makes you adapt on the fly\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIV Online\n\nAvailable on: PC / Mac / PS5 / PS4 / Xbox Series X|S\n\nFINAL FANTASY XIV Online is a massively multiplayer game set in Eorzea - a realm embraced by gods and forged by heroes.\n\nIt has everything you could want from a FINAL FANTASY game - an intricate, engaging storyline, fantastic graphics, and a deep job system that lets you change roles as much as you want.

Joined by his friends and bodyguards - Gladiolus, Ignis and Prompto - the young prince sets off on a road trip towards his bride to be. But the group is unaware of the many dangers that lie ahead.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XV opens with a statement of intent - “A FINAL FANTASY for Fans and First-Timers”.\n\nIt offers up a large world, filled with quests to complete, vicious monsters to hunt and secrets to discover and - for the first time for a numbered FINAL FANTASY game - a spectacular action-oriented battle system.\n\nIt’s an unconventional FINAL FANTASY game in that respect, but the core of the series shines through - wonderful characters, a compelling story, exciting battles and incredible presentation.\n\nPlay this first if…\n\nYou want a battle system that’s action-oriented rather than command-based\n\nYou want a large world full of side quests and monsters to hunt\n\nYou’re a foodie - the meals in this game are something else!\n\nFINAL FANTASY XVI\n\nAvailable on: PS5\n\nThe most recent numbered FINAL FANTASY game is set in Valisthea - a land where a select few are able to channel and even become massively powerful and destructive entities called Eikons. These individuals are known as Dominants, and are both revered and feared.\n\nYou play as Clive Rosfield - firstborn son to the Archduke of Rosaria, and protector of his younger brother Joshua, who also happens to be the Dominant of the Phoenix. But when tragedy strikes his family, Clive is set on a path of revenge - one that will have profound implications on the world.\n\nFINAL FANTASY XVI is a fast-paced and exciting entry in the series, focusing on action-based combat. Clive is able to call on the power of the Eikons to unleash all kinds of amazing abilities, from immolating enemies with flaming strikes to pounding them into a pulp with fists of stone. He can also issue commands to his faithful hound Torgal, instructing him to attack enemies, heal wounds and more. Torgal’s a very good boy.\n\nAdd dodges, counters, parries and more into the mix and you have a wonderfully dynamic and satisfying action combat system that’s a joy from start to finish.\n\nAnd then there are the Eikon vs Eikon battles. These massive scale brawls between towering creatures are some of the most imaginative and visually spectacular in the series yet. Best of all, you don’t just get to watch these - you get to play them.\n\nIn short, it’s an epic in every respect.\n\nPlay this first if:\n\nYou want a mature tale that doesn’t hold back\n\nYou enjoy action games with combat that’s fast-paced, flashy and ferocious fun.\n\nYou want to witness some of the most jaw-dropping moments of spectacle in the series… and take control of it!\n\nWhat about the spin-offs?\n\nFINAL FANTASY has been around for a long time, and has spawned direct sequels, like FINAL FANTASY X-2 and FINAL FANTASY XIII-2, as well as spin-off games like FINAL FANTASY TACTICS or WORLD OF FINAL FANTASY.\n\nBut to be frank, this article is more than long enough already. Maybe we’ll cover them in a future post, but much like the main numbered titles, each is designed to be played standalone, so you can’t really go wrong.\n\nAs we said at the start, there’s no right answer to where you should start with the FINAL FANTASY series. As each game is its own unique entity, you really can begin wherever you want. Hopefully the descriptions here will help you make that decision.\n\nEven so, we’re sure that any fans reading have strong views, so why not let us know on social media?"
