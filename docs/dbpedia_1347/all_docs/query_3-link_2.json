        "text": "I've been in a real Final Fantasy type of mood lately so I decided to have some fun and try to mockup these 2 masterful tracks. Both written by Masashi Hamauzu these tracks are 2 of my favorite from FF13. Fang's Theme is actually the song that made me want to start writing music way back as a kid so it was a real treat trying to recreate it using samples.\n\nAlso, if anyone has any tips on how I could make them sound better I would appreciate it. I'm trying to get as close to the recordings as possible but my ear isn't quite there yet and I'm not trained, so a lot of the arrangement is flying over my head. Especially in Fang's Theme. There's specifically 2 parts, one in the low brass chords @ around 1:01 and then the string runs @2:01 that I feel don't sound quite right. Anyway, hope you enjoy listening.\n\nWhoa, more already! Fang's theme sounds fantastic. Nautilus too. I'll have to check out the originals, I'm a big old school Uematsu guy along with the Tactics composers. What are your go to libraries? These have got so much energy and life to them - or I should say your usage of them does! I've got the Cinematic Studio Series and Pacific Strings as my main libraries but need a new computer before I can really do anything ambitious - mostly have been writing using Musescore/MuseSounds as it doesn't need much ram.\n\nWhoa, more already!

The FFXIII OST is magnificent but so are Juulu’s versions!\n\nWhoa, more already! Fang's theme sounds fantastic. Nautilus too.

I've got the Cinematic Studio Series and Pacific Strings as my main libraries but need a new computer before I can really do anything ambitious - mostly have been writing using Musescore/MuseSounds as it doesn't need much ram.\n\nThe FFXII ost is my all time favorite soundtrack. It has a lot of songs but it's really good. You should give it a listen sometime. My go to libraries are CSS, CSW (mainly the flutes), Infinite Woodwinds(the clarinet you hear)/Brass, and Cineperc. The piano is the VSL Yamaha CFX.\n\nSounds great!\n\nI've arranged Fang's Theme a few years back as well, so I can maybe offer some more in-depth thoughts on it:\n\nThe transcription is good; with Hamauzu it's usually not about the exact voicings, but the emotions evoked, and you nailed it in both the weird brass chord, and the string runs.\n\nThe climax from 1:57 on sounds a little rushed, maybe a tempo map with a slight change around that part might sound good, or maybe I've just listened too much of the Distant Worlds version which has different pacing to OST...\n\nYour timpani is especially great in Fang's Theme, well done.\n\nAwesome work!\n\nRegarding Fang's Theme, the piano at the beginning is a little rushed and could be closer and more apparent in the mix - you want the upper octave to be clear and I'm not really hearing it. Sometimes playing it slightly after the bottom helps with that, too. The snare should be panned more left and the concert toms (or are they rotos?) sound pretty good, I would push them back a bit more. Also the solo clarinet could be further back. The low brass at 1min sounds about right to me, perhaps the trumpet could have more movement in the dynamics while holding for those two measures?\n\nI love your mock-ups, they're always so lively and organic."
