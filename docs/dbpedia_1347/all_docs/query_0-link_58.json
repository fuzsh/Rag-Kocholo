        "text": "Music Discs are a new collectible in Final Fantasy VII Remake - both something new for you to find as you explore the game's expanded full-3D environments, and also an excuse to inject a little nostalgia for the original game into proceedings. Finding every music disc can be difficult, however.\n\nAdvertisement. Keep scrolling for more\n\nMusic discs are collected in a few different ways, and each one collected can then be played on Jukeboxes. They're neat little remixes of famililar songs - but there's also some neat in-game bonuses for grabbing them. They're also crucial to one particular FF7 Remake side quest. This guide will help you to get all of the discs, and complete that quest:\n\nHow FF7 Remake Music Discs work\n\nMusic Disc Unlocks by Chapter\n\nMusic Disc Locations\n\nHow to complete 'The Power of Music' quest\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Music Discs - how to collect them and what they do\n\nYou'll encounter your first music disc in Chapter 3 - either from the Jukebox inside Seventh Heaven, Tifa's Bar, at the item shop down the street that Tifa takes you to, or on the street from a guy with a boom box who's nearby when you have to rescue Johnny. While it isn't quite mandatory to get any of these, you'd have to be paying very little attention to miss all three - they're very in your face during several mandatory story events.\n\nFrom Chapter 3 on, you'll be able to collect music tracks in FF7 Remake, either by interacting with certain items or NPCs, or through buying them from shops and vending machines. The music featured isn't from right across the FF series like FF15's car music unlocks, but instead features great remixes of classic FF7 music - nostalgia overload!\n\nIn general, look out for when a 'now playing' music icon appears in the top left - if it features question marks, that means a song you don't have is playing nearby. Some places will sell you a music disc for a very small nominal fee - usually 50 gil - while others will just be given to you for free just for interacting with the right prompt. All of that is detailed below, of course.\n\nCollecting every music disc allows you to play them at Jukeboxes, and will also earn you the Disc Jockey trophy/achievement. On top of this, there's a late-game side quest that requires several specific music discs to complete.\n\nAdvertisement. Keep scrolling for more\n\nMusic Discs per chapter: disc locations listed chronologically\n\nWhile the Music Discs in FF7 Remake do have a chronological order - they're numbered - that list doesn't remotely correspond to the order in which they appear in the game. The 27th disc in the game, for instance, is only available in Chapter 3. While we have the chronological list on this page too, the by-chapter list is arguably more useful in a natural play-through of the game.\n\nFor the sake of your sanity, as well as the comprehensive list below, here's a list of music discs broken down by chapter, in order. This will help you to avoid missing any, though remember you can loop back using chapter select in the postgame if needed. We just list the disc names and numbers, so you can then cross-reference it with our location list above.\n\nChapter 1 Music Discs: none\n\nChapter 2 Music Discs: none\n\nChapter 3 Music Discs: #1 The Prelude, #3 Tifa's Theme, #4 Barret's Theme, #27 Hip Hop de Chocobo\n\nChapter 4 Music Discs: #4 Barret's Theme (second opportunity, before you take the train)\n\nChapter 5 Music Discs: #28 Stamp\n\nChapter 6 Music Discs: #18 Electric de Chocobo\n\nChapter 7 Music Discs: #2 Bombing Mission\n\nChapter 8 Music Discs: #19 Costa del Sol, #21 Cait Sith’s Theme\n\nChapter 9 Music Discs: #8 Under the Rotting Pizza (first available), #10 Honeybee Inn, #11 Don of the Slums, # 17 Farm Boy, #26 Let the Battles Begin! -REMAKE-, #29 The Midgar Blues\n\nChapter 10 Music Discs: #9 The Oppressed\n\nChapter 11 Music Discs: #6 Let the Battles Begin\n\nChapter 12 Music Discs: none\n\nChapter 13 Music Discs: none\n\nChapter 14 Music Discs: #7 Turk's Theme, #12 Fight On, #14 Main Theme of FFVII, #15 On Our Way, #16 Good Night, Until Tomorrow, #23 Descendant of Shinobi, #24 Wutai, #30 Stand Up\n\nChapter 15 Music Discs: #5 Lurking in the Darkness\n\nChapter 16 Music Discs: #31 Scarlet's Theme\n\nChapter 17 Music Discs: none\n\nChapter 18 Music Discs: none\n\nFinal Fantasy VII Remake Music Discs: all music unlocks and where to get them\n\nA few notes before we get to the raw music list - generally speaking, you'll get music discs one of three ways. The first is by interacting with a jukebox or other item playing the music. The second, and most common, is to buy the music tracks from shops or vending machines scattered throughout FF7 Remake's world. The third method is that discs will crop up as a reward for side quests or interacting with certain NPCs. Simple, right?\n\nMany of these music discs are technically 'missable' on your first playthrough, as they appear in areas or chapters you can't return to. Don't panic, though - once you get to the end of the game, you can use Chapter Select to grab any discs you might've missed.\n\nThere's also a quest that makes use of the music discs and will require you to have three specific discs in your possession. This chapter 14 quest, 'The Power of Music', has its discs noted in the list below - and we've added a little section at the bottom of the article explaining the quest.\n\nAdvertisement. Keep scrolling for more\n\nThe Prelude: You can buy this at the first item shop Tifa takes you to get water filters from, in Chapter 3.\n\nBombing Mission: Buy from the Mako Reactor 5 venting machine in Chapter 7. The machine is found after the lever lock minigame to open the doors.\n\nTifa’s Theme: Interact with jukebox in Seventh Heaven in Chapter 3. This will likely be the first disc that you get.\n\nBarret’s Theme: Buy from one of the shops near Sector 7 train station in Chapter 3 or at the very start of Chapter 4.\n\nLurking In The Darkness: Buy from a vending machine while climbing the Sector 7 Plate in Chapter 15.\n\nLet the Battles Begin: Buy from the vending machine at the switchyard location in the Train Graveyard in Chapter 11.\n\nTurk’s Theme: Get free from Old Woman NPC near the lake north of Wall Market in Chapter 14. It may be possible to grab this earlier, but Chapter 14 will have you running all over anyways, so you’ll be able to grab it then.\n\nUnder the Rotting Pizza: Follow the path southwest of the Inn (the regular inn with the vending machine inside, not the Honeybee Inn) at Wall Market, in any of the chapters where you visit there.\n\nThe Oppressed: Purchase in from the vending machine in the Sewer system in Chapter 10, you’ll pass right by it.\n\nHoneybee Inn: Buy at the pharmacy near the entrance to Wall Market.\n\nDon of the Slums: Purchase in Don Corneo’s mansion after being reunited with Tifa before being called up to his bedroom in Chapter 9.\n\nFight On: Buy at the Corneo Colosseum in Wall Market in Chapter 14. This is the shop right before the elevator heading down into the colosseum itself. This is part of the quest ‘The Power of Music’ for Betty. Remember the battles here help you to unlock more Limit Breaks while you're down there!\n\nThe Chase: Buy from a vending machine in the sewers in Chapter 14. Again, it’s pretty much right along the main path.\n\nMain Theme of FFVII: Buy in the underground area of Sector 7 Slums post-collapse, so get it in Chapter 14.\n\nOn Our Way: Found in the Sector 6 Slums, near the entrance to Sector 7 - in the playground after the evacuation. You can grab this in Chapter 14.\n\nGood Night, Until Tomorrow: Obtained as a freebie from an NPC in the Wall Market Inn in Chapter 14. This is part of the quest ‘The Power of Music’ for Betty.\n\nFarm Boy: Found in the NW area of wall market - an NPC up the stairs near the cowboy-themed bar.\n\nElectric de Chocobo: Can be found in Chapter 6 on the Sector 4 plates, in the area to the right of the main platform after turning off at least two lights. This is on the way to getting the missable Chocobo & Moogle summon materia.\n\nCosta del Sol: Purchase at the Sector 5 Slums Materia shop on any of your visits there - Chapter 8 at the earliest.\n\nGold Saucer: Purchase at The Moogle Emporium shop in Sector 5 for 1 Moogle Medal.\n\nCait Sith’s Theme: Found in the Sector 5 Slums, for sale from a vending machine near the train station.\n\nCosmo Canyon: Found in Sector 6's Collapsed Expressway area, past the second robot-hand puzzle with Aerith.\n\nDescendant of Shinobi: Obtained from the Sector 5 Slums; talk to NPC at Undercity Station post-collapse - so in Chapter 14.\n\nWutai: Get from an NPC in Wall Market’s Urban Advancement District. You’ll likely pass by this guy near the end of Chapter 14 before grappling up to the plate.\n\nTango of Tears: Found in the Sector 5 Slums, south of Leaf House.\n\nLet the Battles Begin! -REMAKE-: One of the trickier music discs to get, and it's obtainable in Chapter 9. To get it, you need to get a perfect score on the dance practice before the main minigame with Andrea, so 10x 'Great' ratings. You can retry this if you need to, but once you progress past it the only way to do it again is via chapter select.\n\nHip Hop de Chocobo: From an NPC near a pizza sign in Sector 7 slum to the right of Seventh Heaven, in Chapter 3.\n\nStamp: Found in a side room in Corkscrew Tunnel Section E in Chapter 5, after where you fight the Sentry Launchers.\n\nThe Midgar Blues: Talk to the singer at the bar in Wall Market - your earliest chance is in Chapter 9.\n\nStand Up: Talk to the NPC in the alley left of Honeybee Inn in Chapter 14. This is the last disc needed for the ‘The Power of Music’ quest for Betty.\n\nScarlet’s Theme: Find on the upper balcony level in the recreation area of the 63rd floor of Shinra Tower in Chapter 16 - right near the VR simulator and Domino's inside man. Mayor - the best!\n\nThe Power of Music: the Music Disc based Quest\n\nThe Power of Music is one of several new side quests introduced in chapter 14 of FF7 Remake - given to you by the young girl Betty once she's moved to Wall Market. She'll be in a small area of the market where there's a Jukebox, surrounded by depressed and upset people.\n\nChatting to Betty triggers 'The Power of Music' quest and adds it to your log. She wants you to find music that might cheer these people up and make them feel better about their situation.\n\nYou require three different music discs to complete the Power of Music quest:\n\n#12 Fight On\n\n#16 Good Night, Until Tomorrow\n\n#30 Stand Up\n\nAll three of these are readily available in and around the Wall Market area during the period this side quest takes place. The exact locations of each are described directly above as part of the main Music Disc location list.\n\nJust getting the discs isn't enough, however: you then need to interact with the Jukebox near Betty and use it to play each of these three songs. The songs are actually marked in the UI with the green quest marker once you interact with the jukebox. Each song cheers up a nearby NPC. Once you've played all three, everybody will be happy. That's the power of music! Completing this quest gets you the Sharpshooter's Companion Vol. III manuscript, which instantly gives Barret 10 SP extra to spend on weapon upgrades."
