The game is all pve and you arenât competing with other players. You donât have to summon on most banners because old gear are all still very viable. The banner rates have been pretty fair for me so far. The Chocobo stamp board is the pity system and itâs better than other gacha games Iâve played because you can get the banner weapon and costume guaranteed and can hit pity faster with the chance of getting more than 1 stamp from summoning.\n\nI only have 2 big complaints with this game. The first one is that the stamina cap should be a lot higher and have a faster recharge time. Youâll burn through stamina very quickly because of the x9 stamina usage, meaning youâll only be able to do 1-2 runs and if you donât have stamina boosters or donât wanna spend crystals for stamina then thatâs it your pretty much done playing. The second thing is that currently costumes are gone forever when their banner is gone. Thereâs a lot of old costumes that I wished I had but I can no longer get and newer players can never get them. Just slowly add a few older costumes at a time into the costume exchange shop, all the costumes currently in that shop are bad and it will make buying the costume exchange tickets actually worth getting."
