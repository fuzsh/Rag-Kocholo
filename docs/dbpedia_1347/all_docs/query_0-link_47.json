        "text": "Instructions\n\nYou can add or remove notes by clicking on the gray rows at the top. BeepBox automatically plays the notes out loud for you. Try it!\n\nNotes go into patterns, and you can edit one pattern at a time. Those numbered boxes at the bottom of the editor are the different patterns you can edit. Click the boxes to move to a different part of the song, or click the arrows on the currently selected box to swap which pattern is played during that part of the song.\n\nBeepBox can play several rows of patterns simultaneously, and each row has its own set of patterns. Most rows can play melodies or harmonies, but the bottom row is for drums.\n\nThe purple loop underneath the numbered boxes controls which part of the song is currently repeating. Move the loop to listen to a different part of the song, or drag the ends to expand the loop to include the whole song.\n\nWhen BeepBox has focus (click on its interface above), you can use these keyboard shortcuts:\n\nSpacebar: play or pause the song\n\nShift Spacebar: play from mouse location\n\nZ: undo, Y or Shift Z: redo\n\nC/V: copy/paste selected pattern(s)\n\n0-9: assign pattern number to selection\n\nArrows: move selection\n\nCtrl + Arrows: rearrange channels\n\n[ ]: move playhead backward or forward\n\nF/H: move to First or Highlighted pattern\n\nShift & Drag: select part of a pattern\n\nCheck BeepBox's edit menu for more!\n\nIn the note pattern editor, you can click and drag horizontally on a note to adjust its duration. You can also click above or below an existing note to add more notes to be played simultaneously, which is called a chord.\n\nYou can also long-press in the pattern editor to select a time range within a pattern, which you can then drag to move multiple notes at once.\n\nADVANCED: Drag vertically from an existing note to bend its pitch, or drag vertically from above or below the note to adjust its volume. Drag on the numbered pattern boxes to select multiple patterns to copy and paste parts of your song.\n\nBeepBox has many more features. Try playing with the buttons and menus on the right side to find out what it can do! You can also click on the label next to each option for a description of what it does.\n\nWant to see what people have made with BeepBox? Songs that were shared on Twitter prior to 2023-05-22 can now be browsed in this interactive archive!\n\nAbout\n\nBeepBox is developed by John Nesky.\n\nBeepBox does not claim ownership over songs created with it, so original songs belong to their authors.\n\nNeither John Nesky nor BeepBox assume responsibility for any copyrighted material played on BeepBox.
