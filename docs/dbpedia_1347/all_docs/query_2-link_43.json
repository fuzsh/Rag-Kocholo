And it is for that reason that I absolutely, unironically love it, even if the game it’s attached to it isn’t all that great.\n\nIt’s just one of those things that you’d almost believe to be fake if you heard it without context. Like, this has to be something a fan cooked up and slapped onto YouTube as a joke. But no. Somebody at Square Enix thought this was a good idea – a heavy metal remix of the classic Chocobo theme, complete with edgy-as-hell lyrics. Seriously, look up the lyrics; they are hilarious.\n\nIt’s so try-hard in its presentation that I genuinely struggle telling whether there’s a shred of self-awareness in it or not. Did everybody involved with the creative process believe this would be just as beloved as the original theme? I don’t think we’ll ever know (though if someone DOES know, send me the details – I’m actually curious).\n\nI can completely understand why some people may hate this track but I can’t help but love it for what it is. Stupid, yes, but I still enjoy listening to it and it’s arguably the best thing to come out of Final Fantasy XIII-2."
