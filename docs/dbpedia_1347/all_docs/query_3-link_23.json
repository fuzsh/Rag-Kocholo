        "text": "#8 Edited By Cristofyr\n\nI don't think that the voice acting is necessarily a negative, but I don't think FF has really figured out how to incorporate it properly. In many ways it feels like it's about 5-7 years behind where the voiced stuff is in more western games in that they treat it as a novelty rather than as an important part of the gameplay. Back then, it didn't matter what the characters sounded like or who you cast because the novelty of actually having voiced dialogue was still fresh to players. Today we expect games to not only be voiced, but voiced well. I had absolutely no problem with the voice acting in a games like Mass Effect or Gears of War because those game got quality voice talent that \"felt\" right for each character. They also did a much, much better job of intergrating the characters with their environment during the cutscene. The camera moved like a movie in those games complete with a small shake at the end of a pan and lens flare, compared to FF, where it a lot of times feels like a bad fashion show with it zooming in for closeups all the time. Maybe this has to do with the fact that the dialogue felt so much more natural in the other games? FF has a tendency toward melodrama, so a lot of time it feels like the characters are reading from a carefully prepared script rather than reacting how they actually would as a character and sound stiled as a result.\n\nAlso, I would argue the music has changed. Ever since X, there has been this shift (a bad one in my opinion), away from true orchestral scores toward bad pop-style music. I remember playing through an early part of the game with Sazh and Vanille and the music sounded like something I'd hear in a coffee shop rather than a game. It was really pretty bad. The main theme is also piano heavy to an extreme. Compare this to the orchestral version of the music from VII or VIII and there is a big difference.\n\n#13 Edited By Signpost\n\n@Cristofyr said:\n\n\"Also, I would argue the music has changed.

The main theme is also piano heavy to an extreme. Compare this to the orchestral version of the music from VII or VIII and there is a big difference. \"\n\nThis is one of my main complaints, I forget the exact chapter now but there was a scene with Sazh and Vanille running around and the music was an upbeat pop-track. It completely pulled me out of the moment. My first thought was how inappropriate the music choices really seem to be, they never seem to fit the tension/emotion of the chapter.\n\n#19 Edited By Cristofyr\n\n@Brodehouse said:\n\n\"@Cristofyr: I think a large part of that has to do with translation, and the difficulties in localizing a game set in a future fantasy setting. Medieval games can be given Ye Olde Englishe treatment (like the reworked Final Fantasy Tactics), and modern games can be moved over quite nicely... however, there are moments in Final Fantasy XIII where the dialogue clearly was not written in English first. You see this a lot in Metal Gear, voice actors trying to wrap their mouths around constructions that don't appear natural in English. This generally ends with the graphical avatar displaying an emotion that doesn't match the voice, or the feeling of wooden acting as the actor struggles to deliver natural emotions to an unnatural phrase. As for the music, you're thinking too literally. The music hasn't changed in that it is still used to deliver emotion the same way, much as the visuals have. From MIDI to synthesizers to real instruments, it is still designed to amplify the emotional effect of a scene. To Zanarkand is no different in scope and delivery than the Battle Theme from the original on the NES. \"\n\nSo a jazz track is supposed to convey \"We've been hopelessly cursed and we're on the run from a facist government that wants to kill us all\"?\n\nAs for text vs. voice, I am starting think that it all goes back to story telling. In the original FF games, there was no graphical capacity to have FMV or even in-engine cutscenes, so everything had to be big blocks of text. Then we hit the PS1 era and the graphical capacity improved. Now the desginers had the option of delivering parts of the story graphically, but because they was still no voice, character movement was used to telegraph specific emotions within big blocks of text. Like how Steiner from FFIX used to jump around when he was angry. It was cartoony and overdone, but it got the point across without actual speech.\n\nThen we hit the PS2 era and things started to go down hill. Characters were now voiced, but the body gestures were not toned down at the same time. The problem with this is that very few people are actually as demonstrative as FF characters when they speak. We all make hand gestures, sure, but usually not the sweeping movements like you find in FF games. This makes them look silly and the cutscenes feel overdone. It also means that there is speech when maybe there shouldn't be. Just as real people don't make gigantic gestures most of the time, they are still capable of conveying emotions clearly with subtle gestures. This is something Mass Effect caught onto. There, a character doesn't start shouting \"I'm angry and I want to hit something!\" The game would just show them narrowing their eyes and maybe slightly balling up a fist and it would get the point across without dialogue. That's the lesson the FF franchise needs to learn - just because you can have the characters talk doesn't mean you should.\n\n#21 Edited By Cristofyr\n\n@Brodehouse said:\n\n\" @Cristofyr: You're confusing the medium with the message. The medium of music is to express or evoke a mood through melody and texture. The exact song may have been a poor choice, but that doesn't somehow alter the medium. Also, the music during that segment in the Vile Peaks is pretty canny. You may not have got it, but I sure did. As soon as I heard it, I knew they were attempting to give a sonic profile of Sazh's \"jolly\" character, and focus on the difference between Lightning's style of leadership with Hope, and Sazh's leadership with Vanille. In a purely musical sense, the other thing I noticed was that while it did have a jazz nature to it, it was not very organic sounding jazz. They made it sound somewhat off-kilter and askew, with the fragmented percussion and electric guitar lines. I assume this was to evoke the 'junkyard' mentality of all the area, a sea of Pulse refuse crudely assembled together. \"\n\nI never asserted the opinion that music is an ineffective medium for evoking a mood or emotion, I was saying that in this particular instance the game failed to do so and that since around FFX, the series has been much less effective at it. The older FF games had larger overarching themes and motifs that have largely been absent in recent entries (or at least have not been good enough to be memorable). Every time I hear Aerith's theme I still remember how I felt when she got offed. Other than the theme of Zanarkand in X, I would be hard pressed to remember more than a couple of tracks from the last several games, much less what was happening when they were playing. I have literaly sunk tens of hours into XIII in the last week, but the only music that sticks out in my head are the instances when it was so jarring it took me out of the gameplay experience.\n\n#22 Edited By spacetrucking\n\n@Brodehouse said:\n\n\"Is replacing all of our once text based entertainment with voice acted entertainment truly wise? Is there a place for reading in games? \"\n\nThere will always be a place for reading in games but I personally prefer good voice acting (or just good acting) to text based exposition in games. There are certain scenes in Mass Effect 2 where the character don't even have to say anything because BioWare has now incorporated complex emotions or gestures into gameplay. A mean stare, a stink eye or an impetuous punch to the face says more about a character than a thousand words of text. That's how movies work and as technology advances, video games are getting there too. It's fun when you get to pick an option and the characters on screen act it out for you (as opposed to just filling the screen with text).\n\nIt also forces developers to come up with dialogue that doesn't come across as trite or cliched when spoken aloud. Mass Effect 1 had that problem where Shepard would start every conversation with \"Tell me about ...\" and the NPC would go on FOREVER with often boring & stilted delivery. ME2 fixed that to some extent and the result is a more entertaining experience. I feel like Square is still stuck in the 90's with their dialogue writing. They could get away with this stuff in FF6 but now games like ME2 or Uncharted 2 have raised the stakes. They need to come up with better lines that take advantage of the actors and the technology at hand. Some of the stuff in FFXIII makes it look like a hundred million dollar movie with a two dollar script."
