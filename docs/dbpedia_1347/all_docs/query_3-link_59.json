        "text": "Have you ever gotten home from a bad day and immediately ran to your room to put on your favorite sad songs playlist just so you could have a good cry? Or maybe you thought you were doing fine, but then literally anything by Adele starts to play and all of a sudden you’re sobbing in the middle of the street? (It happens to the best of us, TBH.)\n\nThere’s nothing like putting on a sad song when you’re all up in your feels. Music can help you regulate your emotions, work through problems, attain closure, and even ease pain. In fact, research shows that mood regulation is the most common use of music outside of rituals (think: weddings), says Andrew Rossetti, PhD, a board-certified music therapist and supervisor of the music therapy program in radiation oncology at The Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine at Mount Sinai Beth Israel.\n\nThe power of music is undeniable. Listening to music or performing music has an effect on the entire body—it literally moves you (and that’s not merely a feeling, it’s science).\n\nMeet the Experts:\n\nAndrew Rossetti, PhD, is a board-certified music therapist and supervisor of the music therapy program in radiation oncology at The Louis Armstrong Center for Music and Medicine at Mount Sinai Beth Israel.\n\nBethany Cook, PsyD, MT-BC, is a board-certified music therapist, licensed clinical psychologist, and adjunct professor at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology.\n\n\"Music is something that affects the human organism in a systems way, which means that pretty much the entire organism is affected, either directly or indirectly, by listening to music or by performing music,\" explains Rossetti. \"Our emotional brain is activated, our limbic system [the part of the brain involved in behavioral and emotional responses] is activated, motion is activated along with cognitive and associative processes.\"\n\nBecause the entire brain is lit up while listening to music, you’re able to tap into feelings and memories that you wouldn’t be able to while reading or seeing a picture, adds Bethany Cook, PsyD, MT-BC, a board-certified music therapist, licensed clinical psychologist, and adjunct professor at the Illinois School of Professional Psychology. “Music just offers so much more accessibility to the full spectrum of feelings,” she says.\n\nLooking for the perfect soundtrack to your next crying sesh? Or maybe you’re in search of new tunes to add to your own sad songs playlist.

If you answered yes, your body might have synchronized with the music you were listening to, resulting in released tension and prolactin (the hormone responsible for curving and controlling grief), producing a relaxation response. (Cool, right?)\n\nAnd when you’re feeling down and out, a sad song might be the one thing you need to stay afloat. “[Sad songs] keep people just in that [feeling] blue phase. It allows them to feel enough support, that they don't drop all the way to depression,” explains Cook. “It could be somebody self-soothing or knowing what their body needs. They need to feel seen or validated.”\n\nIn music therapy, therapists use music for entrainment (the alignment of a person’s biological rhythm with the external rhythms in their environment) to change a patient’s mood and help them safely release emotional tension.\n\n\"We actually entrain with the state that the patient is in, so that means playing something that’s in the same tempo and at the same intensity as we see the patient’s respiratory rate and heart rate to be, which is observable through a medical monitor. And then [we] gradually slow that down, making the music less intense and activating,\" explains Rossetti. \"In that process, you produce a relaxation response quite easily.\"\n\nWhile it might sound counterintuitive, if you’re ever feeling down, listening to sad songs can actually boost your mood, or at the very least, stabilize it.\n\nSo next time you’re in your (emotional) bag, you might want to crank on a playlist of tear-jerkers and \"Cry Your Heart Out.\" You’ll feel much better. (Promise!)"
