        "text": "Okay, so from what I know, the reason people find the song so nostalgic is because it reminds them of their childhood video games. (Myself included, even though I mostly grew up with Maplestory and various flash games)\n\nSo I showed my Mom and Dad the Undertale theme (Once upon a time), and both of them say that the song also makes them feel nostalgic.\n\nHere’s the thing:\n\nMy Mom has never played video games before.\n\nAnd my Dad first played video games when he was about 19.\n\nI can understand my Dad feeling that feeling because he has had a taste of what retro games sound like (More than me actually), but my Mom has never played any retro games.\n\nHowever, she still feels the nostalgia that we do.\n\nSo that means that there’s something in the composition that just naturally evokes that feeling in us.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis has been a question that’s been haunting my mind ever since I played Tower of Heaven back in 2013.\n\nWhat makes certain melodies and songs feel so nostalgic?\n\nIs it the mode of the song?\n\nIs it the sound design?\n\nThe composition?\n\nCosmic forces beyond our realm of understanding pulling our emotional strings?\n\nIf anyone has any explanation, or if you have music that also evokes the same feeling of nostalgia, Please do share!\n\nThere’s also something called “four chords” songs, where you can make a lot of different songs with just four certain chords and they will be popular songs. There was a comedy skit detailing this I saw once. Apparently some sounds are just universally pleasing to the ear for some reason. Music itsself is popular with just about everyone. We may enjoy different music, but almost everyone likes music. I can’t explain it, but there’s just something about music that puts people in a good mood. Makes them feel different emotions. soothes the savage beast.\n\nThat’s where people get the idea of hypnotic songs, or speaking things into existence. Sound is a very important part of our lives.\n\nRegardless if you’ve played video games or not, the opening theme to undertale is evocative of early synth music because of how it emulates the kind of stuff that was written for Gameboy and Famicom systems (and their soundchips). It’s a conscious choice, and coupled with the limited palette of the opening scene, you can’t help but acknowledge the tone that the game is going for in the beginning.\n\nThe simplicity of the theme is definitely something that is obviously meant to remind the player of early sound design, and that coupled with the limited orchestration (there’s only a total of like 3 or 4 voices in that intro), kind of makes it so that, regardless if you’re familiar with early video game systems, you can’t help but feel that this is reminiscent of those early compositions.\n\nThat’s my take anyway.\n\n“Once Upon a Time” has a slow pace, a relatively high pitch, and a tone that could be described as “longing” or “wistful.” Those elements are commonly found in other songs meant to evoke memory or nostalgia. (Atmospheric, slow-paced violin music comes to mind.)\n\nIt also sounds some of the most NES-era of all the songs in-game, so anyone who ever heard the sound of people playing video games in the 80s will have a chance of feeling nostalgic just from that, even if they didn’t play the games directly themselves. The association with that type of sound will tend to trigger the nostalgia regardless."
