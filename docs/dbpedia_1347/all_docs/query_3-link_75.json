        "text": "Link\n\nIn an extended NewsPicks interview with Nobuo Uematsu by Japanese academic Yoichi Ochiai, the veteran Final Fantasy series composer gave his thoughts on current and future game music. As well as discussing the limitations he had to work around when composing game soundtracks in the 1980s and 1990s, Uematsu also shared advice for aspiring game music composers and his thoughts on AI compositions.\n\nEvolution of Memory Limitations\n\nIn the NewsPicks video interview, Nobuo Uematsu stated that \"music played the role of oxygen\" for 8-bit games, effectively bringing their stories and characters to life, as the games had small sprites and no voice acting. He also discussed the memory limitations he had to work within, especially in the NES, SNES and PS1 generations.\n\n\"On the SNES, the capacity increased and I was able to use samples of say the violin or the flute, then compress these over and over.\" However, only 8 sounds could be played at the same time and samples used up space, so \"I was still worrying about not having enough memory during the SNES days.\" With Final Fantasy VII being developed for the PlayStation 1's CD-ROM format, Uematsu explained that \"It was now possible to stream the music, as in take what I had made in the studio and reproduce it (in the game). However, if I did that it would take a very long time to load in. I think fans would complain if they charged into battle and then it went into a loading screen.\" Therefore, in the Playstation 1 generation, Uematsu continued to use compressed sound samples to create engaging looping melodies, achieving a balance between the available memory and sound quality.\n\nHe explains that from the PlayStation 2's Final Fantasy X onwards, game music started to enter \"A period where we could pretty much do everything.\" Uematsu adds that \"As game consoles have advanced, it has been easier for me to express different genres of music (like rock and jazz, etc.) within game music.\"\n\nHollywood style soundtracks\n\nUematsu goes on to muse as to why recent game music has become less interesting in his opinion. He suggests that the problem might be that directors and producers are \"satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games,\" adding, \"I think people need to have more freedom when creating (game music).\" Uematsu thinks that if games keep using Hollywood movie-style scores, then the genre of \"game music cannot develop further.\" On the other hand, he comments that \"game music will become more interesting if composers consider 'what is something only I can do?' and use their own knowledge and experience to be truly creative.\"\n\nA.I\n\nThe artist dismisses AI as a tool for composing music, emphasizing the role of music in conveying empathy between composer and listener. He states that composing good music is a difficult art that can only be realized by \"reaching deep down inside yourself to find aspects unique to you and then expressing them.\"\n\nAfter last week I got scared just a bit with the beginning of the thread title :-/\n\nExpected but I like his take on AI usage when it comes to music.\n\nI'm always worried when i see his name popping up on a thread title :'(\n\nWhat he says about vg music being too much like movie soundtrack, it's funny cause i thought about that for the first time when i listened to Xenosaga ost back then and it was really boring to me compared to Xenogears for exemple. it was so serious and pompous.\n\nThat said i kinda think that about FFVII remake ost to... Having 30 alt versions of everything that plays at any moment (and multiple composers) makes the music feel really different and less identifying to me.\n\nView: https://youtu.be/cMbJxZWAzuA?si=1t1TnRsG621YiDZ-\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Uncharted and the music is great and well made, but these tracks have more in common with theatrical cinematic score for a hollywood action film. And so many story-based/single player games have chased this style of music for their realistic, expensive games. Pick a random spot in the video, and I really doubt you'd be able to pinpoint what stage or story moment it played for.\n\nMeanwhile I hear this track and this scene plays out in my mind, clear as day.\n\nThe problem with \"hollywood\" scores is that it all usually just ends up blurring together.\n\nI don't think the FFX track would fit so well in something like UC4. I don't remember individual tracks from Uncharted's levels, I just remember feeling immersed and that means it did its job well. TLOU2 I do remember some tracks, but they're still often mood setting pieces without much priority to melody.\n\nAbout BG3 specifically, I've played through most of Act 1 recently and the only song I can specifically recall from that game is the \"Down by the River\" theme and its variants. A lot of it just kinda… blends together.\n\nBG3 definitely seems to be more subdued. BG2 I remember most of the soundtrack because its louder, more digital sounding with some bespoke area themes. But I also don't think BG2 style soundtrack would really work for the game they made, which is more open, more deliberate and strategic (and slow).\n\nI don't think the FFX track would fit so well in something like UC4. I don't remember individual tracks from Uncharted's levels, I just remember feeling immersed and that means it did its job well. TLOU2 I do remember some tracks, but they're still often mood setting pieces without much priority to melody.\n\nI didn't mean that I wanted that track to slot into something like Uncharted. Moreso that FFX's Wandering is an incredibly distinct and unique track that was composed for for a very specific emotional turning point in the story. Almost every track in FFX is. No piece of the OST can be mistaken for the other because every note is rooted into a specific feeling or atmosphere in the game.\n\nIt's totally cool that you felt immersed with UC's soundtrack, I did too while playing it. BUT the fact that you or I can't remember most of, or even care to return to any particular music that hit at any given point in the game is kind of what myself (and I believe Uematsu/other posters) are getting at here. Music shouldn't default to the generic big budget soundscape of hollywood movies and should seek to elevate the content it's backing so that it DOES make that particular stage or moment memorable, no matter how big or small. Yeah scenes can be memorable on their own, but the music should act as a fingerprint unique to that moment. I'm picking on Uncharted a lot here even though I don't hate the game or music, but if I swapped the tracks for a shootout at the start of the game, and one in the last act, I doubt you could tell the difference, and that's the problem I'm getting at.\n\nIt's totally cool that you felt immersed with UC's soundtrack, I did too while playing it.

Maybe some \"triple A\" titles do. Going by last year Spiderman and Starfield kind of could be considered that (I haven't played much of it), but AW2 and Phantom Liberty not so much. Jedi Survivor getting the game music grammy while something like FF XVI isn't even there was kind of wack, but it was still an impressive OST that perfectly fit the Star Wars setting and being a movie like score makes perfect sense there. To me it seems more like a symptom of some expensive games were emulating blockbusters in presentation, not just that the music alone was.\n\nI don't think it does default to generic bug budget Hollywood movies though?

To me it seems more like a symptom of some expensive games were emulating blockbusters in presentation, not just that the music alone was.\n\nJust to point out that the Indiana Jones movies which the Uncharted games are kind of a derivative of. The ones scored by John Williams have really memorable soundtracks. So it is possible I just think it's a matter of the developers not prioritising it enough, and getting artists creative enough.\n\nUematsu goes on to muse as to why recent game music has become less interesting in his opinion. He suggests that the problem might be that directors and producers are \"satisfied with movie soundtrack-like music in games,\" adding, \"I think people need to have more freedom when creating (game music).\" Uematsu thinks that if games keep using Hollywood movie-style scores, then the genre of \"game music cannot develop further.\" On the other hand, he comments that \"game music will become more interesting if composers consider 'what is something only I can do?' and use their own knowledge and experience to be truly creative.\"\n\nHe's not wrong. Game music is pretty boring when it just sounds like background music from a movie. Good game music should be dripping with personality and a major part of the experience itself, instead of just loud orchestras and the occasional dramatic choir that blends into the background during the action.\n\nMuch like any aspect or art form, seminal works have usually arisen from the cognizance of limitations. I'm sure that many composers of the NES era would've loved to make their music as lush as possible, but with limited sound channels the onus was on the composers to primarily create something that could truly stick in the mind in the absence of texture, and Nobuo Uematsu is likely to realize this more than anyone as one of the all time legends of video game music. Nowadays with those limits sanded off it's so easy to get overwrought in said texture. I don't think this is a problem exclusive to games either, because these criticisms have permeated in the cinematic space as well; see Every Frame A Painting's \"Marvel Symphonic Universe\" which was cited by Mark Mothersbaugh as a video he took specific note of when he was hired to compose for Thor Ragnarok.\n\nWe've had some excellent soundtracks over the years which use Hollywood symphonics but usually that's because they exist to elevate tracks that aim to make a striking impression in terms of composition. My favorite example I like to use is Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze because it's such a perfect example of how to set a memorable tone. The first track posted is a symphonic rearrangement of an SNES track which only showcases the timelessness of composition, while the second one is an original. One is intense and the other is serene; both of these offer completely different flavors but they both still feel cohesive and evoke a variety of emotions without depending on mere texture. These melodies and compositions are engrained into my mind ever since first listen, and elevate the settings they're a part of to huge heights.\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOwf-GdGEko\n\nView: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boqy0Q-4c_M\n\nI think your missing the point.\n\nThe soundtracks had different goals to them. Some games go for OSTs that are more moody set pieces, while others go for music that is meant to be blaring at max volume.\n\nI mean it's not even about blaring volume. I just tend to vibe way more with songs that actually have a central melodic core to them, and less songs that are just trying to \"be a vibe\". In my mind, all of TLOU's music sounds like the same sad guitar plucking, and it's hard to differentiate one piece from another.\n\nWhen every song is just trying to be an atmosphere piece, I tend to just tune it completely out. Some of that is because my ADHD makes my brain hyperfocus, and if the game's music isn't trying to attract any of that focus, it just gets lost.\n\nI mean it's not even about blaring volume.

TLOU OST has a very specific tone and style to it that makes sense in the moment. It's not a game or a series that really makes sense to have a score with a lot of variety.\n\nUltimately it just feels super dismissive of the work that is done with these scores and sort of tries to massively downplay how much they have an effect on the games themselves. Again, just because it's not something you listen on repeat or can hum, doesn't suddenly mean it's not doing it's job.\n\nLike hell, the irony of this specific discussion is that, while mayhap not any individual score of TLOU is super memorable on it's own right, the actual overall style of the soundtrack is fairly unique still and if you hear any of the songs, you can tell that it's from TLOU because there isn't that many games or movies in general that have that specific sounding score.\n\nIt's not even just Western games too, while their songs are meant to be a bit more in your face, the Souls games soundtrack, Elden Ring included, very much are: \"Hollywood-like\" as well.\n\nI mean again though, that's literally the point.
