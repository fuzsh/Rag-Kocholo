        "text": "Square Enix has uploaded a new official cover on their music YouTube channel. Toru Tabei arranged and performed “The Sunleth Waterscape” from Final Fantasy XIII on guitar, initially composed by Masashi Hamauzu. Additionally, Mai Kondo recorded and mixed the performance.\n\n“The Sunleth Waterscape” is one of the most memorable and iconic tracks from the title. It plays in a standout forest area that also appears in the direct sequel, Final Fantasy XIII-2.\n\nPiano covers of “Lightning’s Theme,” “Blinded by Light,” “The Promise,” and “Saber’s Edge” from Final Fantasy XIII were previously shared. Final Fantasy XIII-2 has also gotten some love with an official piano arrangement of “Wishes.”\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is comprised of a trilogy that is available on PlayStation 3, Xbox, and PC, with countless fans pleading for a remastered collection, seeing as, aside from the MMO Final Fantasy XI, the first title is the only mainline entry not on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5.\n\nThe first Final Fantasy XIII has been endlessly critiqued for its level design and story elements, but it boasts one of the best battle systems in the entire franchise, with a remarkable presentation that still holds up astonishingly well. Hopefully, the trilogy will receive ports on PlayStation in the near future."
