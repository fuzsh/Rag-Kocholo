The above video is the unpacking of the limited edition (SQEX-10178~82), from yours truly. It’s my debut to YouTube!\n\nThis version has a fifth disc, a larger box, and a larger book. There aren’t a lot of differences. But I end up finding a lot to say anyway, rambling for a good seven minutes about what’s on the soundtrack. I even editorialize about the nature of limited editions. So check out the video, and enjoy!\n\nTags: Final Fantasy XIII, Limited Edition, Masashi Hamauzu, OSVchannel, Unboxing, Unpacking, Yoshitaka Amano"
