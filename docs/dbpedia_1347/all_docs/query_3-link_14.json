        "text": "After watching that, you shouldn’t have any doubts about how completely music changes the tone of a scene! If you decide to work in film music, you’ll probably end up working on some projects that don’t quite sell the scene on their own — which means that your job is to analyze the scene, diagnose what it needs, and deliver that through the soundtrack.\n\nYou’ll work much faster (and with less stress) if you start off with solid sources of inspiration. Find some soundtracks you like on Spotify and skim different songs for anything that catches you as being particularly sad, joyful, hopeful, etc. Then take those songs and put them in a Spotify playlist that you can play before you write music. You can even create a playlist folder and split them out into different playlists by emotion: Anger, Despair, Triumph, etc. Refer back to UJAM’s Top 10 Tips for a Music Production Workflow — #5 goes in-depth into finding inspiration in your writing process.\n\nCapturing the emotion of a scene\n\nThe first step here is about communication; if you’re working with a client, usually you’ll be speaking with the director and/or producer. Be absolutely certain you understand their creative vision and what they want the soundtrack to do for the film. They may not be able to put it exactly into words ... so it’s your job to decipher it! When in doubt, send them samples from the Spotify playlists you curate and ask if they evoke the desired feeling. This helps you narrow down your list of references, which in turn focuses you and gives you a much better chance of writing music that the client loves!\n\nIn addition, the entire time you’re watching the scene without music, ask yourself the question: “What is this scene trying to accomplish? How can I help it do that through the soundtrack?” You’ll get better (and faster) at answering this question as you work on more films. If the scene is designed to scare viewers, that probably means you need to write something ominous or unsettling, perhaps even with dramatic hits at key moments to startle the audience. There’s no right or wrong way to do this, but every time you watch a movie in the future, listen carefully to the soundtrack, think back to the questions above and ask yourself: “How did the composer answer these questions? Why did they answer them the way they did?”\n\nThis approach requires a lot of thought, and you’ll end up getting stumped at times. That’s part of the path to mastery! Every time you watch a movie, think about how the soundtrack complements the scene. Eventually, you might get this nagging feeling that you disagree with the composer’s choice — and that’s great! It means you’re exercising your critical thinking and your standards are growing. You may even disagree with the choices of some of your favorite composers, and that’s okay. The unique decisions you make are what will set you apart as a film composer!\n\nWhat music scales and chords create which emotions?\n\nIt makes sense to always use major keys for ‘happy’ songs and minor keys for ‘sad’ ones ... but it’s not always that simple. Labor of Love (by Michael Giacchino) from Star Trek is an incredible example of this — it’s entirely in a major key, and in a different context it could sound uplifting ... but it plays during a bombastic scene involving death. This is an unusual approach, but when it’s used in the right moment, the effect is dramatic and grabs viewers’ attention.\n\nBut yes, most of the time, your sad songs will be in minor keys. The song’s key, plus which chords get the most focus, largely control the feel of the song. Here are a few examples:\n\nKey of C minor -> hang on the chords G minor and then Ab major (V minor and bVI major if you want to be key-agnostic) ... this focus on a major chord in a minor key, especially with the rise from a lower note, gives a hopeful feeling\n\nKey of C major -> hang on the chord F minor (IV minor) ... this creates a very low-energy pull, giving a despairing feeling\n\nKey of C major -> hang on the chord F major (IV major) ... this again creates a low-energy pull, but in a major key, you can use this to create a wistful feeling\n\nThere are plenty of other variations of this, and these are just isolated moments. It’s tricky to sustain a feeling throughout a song — which is why it’s so useful to have references. When you’re not sure how to create and maintain a specific feeling throughout a song, see how different songs in your playlist accomplish it. If you can, combine their different approaches to create something unique!\n\nWhat instruments to use\n\nWhen it comes to writing emotional music, you’ll often reach for a string section first — in part because bowed strings are so expressive. They’re also very difficult to recreate in a digital environment, exactly for that reason ... but Hans Zimmer allowed UJAM to take some of the best recordings from his private strings library and put them into our plugin, STRIIINGS. There’s a preset called Sustains Full Neutral that allows you to create romantic, cinematic chords that you can easily drop into your songs at key moments, allowing you to easily control the emotional temperature of the song.\n\nWe had the chance to sit down with film composer and music producer Laura Escudé about her writing process, and how she uses STRIIIINGS as a jumping off point when she’s feeling stuck (even though she has years of experience writing for strings):"
