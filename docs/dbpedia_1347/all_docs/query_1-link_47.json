        "text": "Happy Friday, all! I’m going to wrap this week up with a (hopefully) divisive write-up about a game that must have a fanbase, but that fanbase doesn’t include me. Let’s look at one of the more polarizing entries in the long running series, Square Enix’s Final Fantasy XIII…\n\nGameplay and Stuff:\n\nIs it multiplayer? Nope! Yet another single player, multi hour JRPG over here\n\nCan I play it with my kids? Probably not, the story is about as convoluted as you’d expect from any Final Fantasy game, possibly moreso. Even as an adult I didn’t fully get what was going on\n\nWhat’s the time commitment to ‘git gud’? FFXIII is quite accessible, with a simple enough difficulty curve, even the option to restart battles if they aren’t going your way. As with most of these games there’s optional bosses that go way beyond the strength of the story bosses if you want a real challenge / exercise in repetition\n\nAre the controls intuitive? They’re easy enough to follow, with menu driven commands taking a lot of complexity out of fights, and the controls outside of it being standard for any modern RPG\n\nIn the world of Gran Pulse is a large floating city called Cocoon, separated from the world outside and controlled by a religious government called the Sanctum. So scared of outside influence are they, that anybody who encounters anything outside of Cocoon is “purged.” In this world, there are beings called fal’Cie, basically gods, and they can choose and mark people as their servants, dubbed l’Cie, and the task they are given is called their “Focus.” If a l’Cie complete their Focus, they will be turned into crystal, which is apparently a good thing, and if they don’t, they become Cie’th, mindless monsters that are also covered in crystals…yeah…\n\nSo anyway, the main character Lightning is looking for her sister, Serah, who is being sought out by the Sanctum to be purged. What follows is 30 hours of holding up while playing as various characters, with the occasional tilt left or right to go down small side paths for pointless treasures. You’ll be introduced to the likes of Vanille, an insufferable teenage girl, and Hope, and insufferable teenage boy, and a whole host of insufferable people who are honestly one of, if not the worst ragtag bunch every to grace a Final Fantasy title. Some things happen, everyone gets the ability to summon Zords, and after fighting a floating head the story abruptly ends.\n\nMuch like every Final Fantasy game, Square Enix have created a whole new battle system to get to grips with, this time it’s the Paradigm and Break systems; the Paradigm system allows your party members to change up their roles mid battle depending on the situation, for example swapping a damage dealer into more of a tank role, or a black mage to a healer. Everyone can become any of these Paradigms, but some are blatantly much better in certain roles. The Break system is basically integral to the whole battle system – Enemies have high defences by default, but repeatedly attacking them and using certain techniques will build up a meter, once this is full it begins to drain, and during that time their defence drops to near enough zero, meaning you can actually damage them. Once the bar empties this process begins again, and again, and onwards for the next 40 – 60 hours.\n\nContent in Game: For a game that’s pushing 10 years old, it must be said that the graphics for Final Fantasy XIII are gorgeous – there’s a lot of detail In the environments, the character designs and animations, and especially the monster designs. While a lot of it isn’t my personal tastes, I must admit there’s a lot of care put into everything, even down to the menus and UI looking very slick. This also goes into the many, many cutscenes throughout this game, all of which are competently shot, animated, and acted, even if the dialogue and content is utter guff. Part of the reason it can look this good could come down to its linearity, but you can’t argue that it works, this was a fantastic looking game at the time, and even now I’d say its aged well, albeit a little on the shiny side.\n\nThe music is also relatively nice. The old curmudgeon in me will say that the Final Fantasy series hasn’t had good music in it since Nobuo Uematsu left, but there’s some quite good tracks dotted throughout this game. The issue it runs into is that most of the music is heard repetitively, especially the battle music, which is wishy washy at the start and doesn’t get better as you hear it repeatedly. Again, the main theme of the game is quite nice at first, but once you reach the larger “open area” towards the end of the game you hear it on endless loop as you work through the optional content that is completely backloaded. Despite every Final Fantasy game being a different setting, there was always some continuity to the music, with little trills and leitmotifs, but Final Fantasy XIII drops all of this, forging its own way with the audio, and it feels like a different beast because of it.\n\nMy Personal Opinion (and why you shouldn’t listen to it): I was disappointed with Final Fantasy XII, which had a major hit to my love of the Final Fantasy series, and so when Final Fantasy XIII came out I didn’t rush out to buy it, instead electing to borrow it from a friend some time after it had launched. I was intrigued by the graphics, much like the FMVs of Final Fantasy VII that initially led me to the series many years ago. What I found as I played through this game though, was a linear experience devoid of challenge, filled with forgettable characters, a battle system that gave the impression of being deep and customizable, but exhausting itself of innovation before the end of the second disc, and a story that, try as I might, I couldn’t get into, and coupled with the awful cast of characters, I ultimately didn’t want to get into. What made this whole experience worse was simply how dragged out it was; the majority of play sessions could be summed up as follows: Hold up, watch a cutscene, hold up, open a chest, have a fight, watch a cutscene, hold up, skip a cutscene, skip a cutscene, hold up, save, 10 minutes of menu, skip a cutscene, fight a boss, save, quit. This loop continues for anything from 30 – 60 hours depending on how many cutscenes you watch, and how much of the endgame content you do. In the end I gave up on the repetitive optional hunts for palette swapped enemies and powered through the final slog of holding up and skipping cutscenes to get to the end of the story, and for me the end of my love for this series. Since finishing Final Fantasy XIII I’ve not bothered with the subsequent games, and apart from a foray back to IX and VI, I’ve never picked it back up. Either I’ve grown out of this kind of storytelling, or the series has gone in a different direction to what initially drew me to it, but I’ve never had the urge to dive back in since."
