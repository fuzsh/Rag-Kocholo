So we sat down and thought, what would be a great way to do this? To give a more personal insight into us as a company and the people who work here that make Nexus Mods what it is, whilst feeling more connected as a communit...\n\nMonthly Roundup - June 2024\n\nAnother month has flown by and with it comes our next monthly roundup for you all.

As it was probably everyone's Game of the Year of 2023 (including ours). The game went from being the 51st-ranked game on our site while it was in early access to 9th by January 2024. The modding scene has exploded, so we thought it was about time we interviewed a BG3 mod author.\n\nOn that note, it is with great pleasure that Aether has agreed to be our first mod author interviewee, and we couldn’t be more thankful for her taking the time to...\n\nIntroducing: SlugGirl\n\nHave you ever wanted to see what we’re up to as a community while scrolling through your Instagram feed?

DP earned from April 2024 onwards will be calculated using a new algorithm intended to distribute the pool of points more fairly to mod authors who make great content for the community. While we get the details ironed out, you won't see the usual reports on your wallet page at the end of each month for a little while.
