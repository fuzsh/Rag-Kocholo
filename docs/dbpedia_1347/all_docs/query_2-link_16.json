As soon as I heard this song when I was playing through the game, I knew I had to make a recording of it. There is also many songs similar to this throughout the game, one being “The Future”. I had done a recording of this previously when the game first came out, but since then I’ve done a re-recording of it on my newer more “in-tune” piano. Oh and I just realised but you can kinda see my reflection and easel in the piano… Shiny haha.\n\nLet me know what you guys think by commenting below, thanks!"
