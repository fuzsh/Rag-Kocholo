Final Fantasy XIII is a game that's divided Final Fantasy fans, and Snow is very fitting for a game like this, as he too seems to be either loved or hated. Regardless of how you feel about him as a character or FFXIII as a game, I hope you can agree with me that he has one awesome theme.

Pure rock 'n' roll. This song is dripping with both attitude and rebellion. Does the bold, brash nature of the piece remind you of a certain irrepressible, fiery young man who leads team NORA?

It's not ever going to be the kind of song whose melody gets stuck in your head, but as you listen to it, I'm sure you can feel your head slowly bob up and down. It also seems like perfect driving music, be it hurtling down the highway at noon, or cruising through the city at night.

I also want to note that it would not be out of place in a Dynasty Warriors game at all! Anyway, let's have a look at other versions.

This is from YouTube user JillxxxValentineRE1 and I just want to say - he is phenomenal and has a huge amount of talent. This version rocks even more than the original.

I can honestly say I'm not the world's biggest dubstep fan, but Lukeff7 has done a good job here. This wouldn't sound out of place in a CyberPunk environment and is well worth a listen.

So to recap:

9. Snow

10. Bartz

What do you think of Snow, and Snow's theme? I obviously would've plumped for the incredible Blinded By Light, just as I might've gone for Battle on the Big Bridge for V's offering, but I don't think they count!
