        "text": "<<< Opportunity rocks\n\nHome\n\nThe Daily Scan >>>\n\ncatching up\n\nSaturday, 03/20/04 10:57 AM\n\nIf you haven't posted for a while - for a long while - you tend to want to do two things: first, you want to make your first post back \"big\", like it can justify the time you spent not posting, and second, you want to catch up.\n\nI don't know about \"big\"; I was just really busy and fell out of my daily habit of blogging. It wasn't like I was creating this amazing post for you the whole time :) But as far as catching up, I have over 300 posts saved in my RSS reader which I've flagged for posting. I won't subject you to all of them, but it has been an eventful eight weeks...\n\nIn order of importance:\n\nThe Mars Rovers\n\nBoy was that something, watching \"NASA TV\" when Opportunity landed. If you haven't watched this movie which shows how the Mars landers make it to Mars, please do so; it is nothing short of amazing. Really helps you appreciate that these robots are an amazing technical achievement.\n\nDespite losing Beagle 2, the European Space Agency's Mars Express is sending back great pictures, too.\n\nCaltech has apparently patented the Mars Rovers' designs; look for Rover toys landing in your toy stores soon.\n\nMark Cantor posted a terrific picture, \"left the nest\".\n\nBad moments as NASA loses contact with Spirit.\n\nMars Express finds ice.\n\nCitizen smash on Opportunity's landing: Second Front Opened on Mars. Cool.\n\nFirst pictures of Meridiani Planum, Opportunity's landing site.\n\nThen we have Opportunity's Interplanetary hole-in-one.\n\nCruft in space; BBC reports \"NASA scientists say hundreds of computer files that have accumulated on the Mars rover Spirit may be the cause of problems that have crippled it.\"\n\nOpportunity rolls off its lander. Yippee! And then takes its first spin.\n\nOne theory about why Spirit stopped communicating :) [ via Joi Ito ]\n\nEETimes: The trouble with the rover is revealed. And how engineers not only diagnosed the problems, but programmed around them. Amazing.\n\nThis isn't Mars related, but it is space related, so I'm putting it here; The Hubble [Space Telescope] sees 'most distant object'. \"It is so distant its light must have set out when the Universe was just 750M years old to reach the Earth now.\" That's amazing, 750M years is practically time zero.\n\nIn more non-Mars space news, New Scientist reports Life could be tough on acid Europa. \"Far from being a haven of ice and water and an ideal spot for the search for alien life, Jupiter's moon Europa may be a corrosive hotbed of acid and peroxide.\"\n\nThis famous bet between Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, and John Preskill may be settled; Samir Mathur and his colleagues have proposed a solution to the 'information paradox' using string theory. \"The finding suggests that black holes are not smooth, featureless entities as scientists have long thought. Instead, they are stringy 'fuzzballs'.\" I love it.\n\nOpportunity finds evidence that Mars was once \"soaking wet\". Big news.\n\nWired reports ESA's Rosetta Mission Under Way. \"Europe's Rosetta space mission, aimed at landing on a comet in search of secrets of the history of the solar system, began its 10-year voyage after the spacecraft separated from an Ariane rocket early Tuesday.\" Mark your calendars!\n\nIf Mars Rover Opportunity was a teenager and had a blog, this is what it would be like. \"I got to drive today! It's so cool! I didn't think I'd ever be allowed to go out on my own. NASA is so protective sometimes; it's like they wanted to keep me swaddled in airbags forever.\" Okay, that's cute.\n\nSpirit, on the other side of Mars, finds more evidence of water. Big news. Nature summarizes the evidence.\n\nHey, we have a new planet! Please join me in welcoming Sedna to the Solar System. Well, okay, so she's a bit small (3/4 the size of Pluto) and a bit far away (currently 8.5M miles, but at times, 80M miles, in fact \"standing on the surface of Sedna, you could block the entire sun with the head of a pin held at arm's length\").\n\nThe War on Terror\n\nEight weeks. Wow, a lot has happened, in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in the Middle East, and in Europe. I'd put the Madrid bombing and the subsequent defeat of Spain's President Aznar at the top of the list. In my opinion this looks worse than it was, I think Aznar was already unpopular and the Socialists might well have defeated him without the bombing. I have a hard time believing the Spanish people voted for Zapatero thinking it would reduce terrorist activity in Spain. Stephen Den Beste doesn't, though.\n\nStephen Den Beste suggests the Palestinians are Up Against the Wall. And subsequent events have proved him right.\n\nAt least 56 dead in Iraq suicide blasts. And then, Hajj stampede: 244 pilgrims dead. Interesting how CNN reports the former as a huge tragedy (presumably one which could have been avoided by alternate U.S. decisions), while the latter is merely a Muslim ritual. No mention of how many people would have died if Hussein were still in power, either.\n\nCitizen Smash considers the al Qaeda memo captured by U.S. forces in Iraq: Please Send Help. \"America… has no intention of leaving no matter how many wounded nor how bloody it becomes.\" You bet.\n\nAdam Curry visits Iraq, and blogs about it.\n\nCommand Post: Mass Graves Report. \"So far, 270 mass graves have been found which contained the remains of 400,000 Iraqis.\" Amazingly, this is under-reported in the mass media, as is the fact that zero people have been killed by Hussein's government since the U.S. occupation. Sigh.\n\nGlenn Reynolds notes: Bush seems to be falling victim to his own success. We have been so successful in the war on terror that the country doesn't see it as a war anymore. Consider the following, if you were told on 9/12/2001 that by this date:\n\nThe Taliban have fallen\n\nIraq has fallen and has become a bastion of free press in the Islamic world\n\nLibya had given up its WMD's\n\nNorth Korea is in multi-lateral talks about WMD's\n\nA majority of the leadership of Al Qaeda are dead or in custody\n\nPro-democracy rumblings are going on in Iran\n\nArafat is isolated\n\nMany convictions of domestic sleepers or Al Qaeda members (Portland, NY etc...) and finally\n\nNO SUCCESSFUL TERROR ATTACKS ON U.S. SOIL\n\nAnd all of this has cost less than 1000 dead American soldiers. You'd be thinking \"not bad\".\n\nTony Blair gave a great speech about the Iraq war, Command Post blogs it. Read it. The tradition of great oratory in British politics is wonderful, I wish our politicians were so eloquent.\n\nNew interim constitution for Iraq. And here's Stephen Den Beste's analysis...\n\nZapatero is pulling Spanish troops out of Iraq. So be it.\n\nPresident Bush gives a great speech: No Neutral Ground. \"There can be no separate peace with the terrorist enemy.\" I disagree with him on so many things - gay marriage, for example - but on this, the biggest thing, I agree with him completely.\n\nThe Presidential Campaign\n\nAmazingly, eight weeks ago Howard Dean was the leading Democratic candidate for president. Now he's an also ran, and John Kerry is the man. Jim Ladd likes him, but I still don't know... Charles at LGF notes Kerry's record, little doubt what he thinks. Meanwhile John Edwards came and went. (Although he might resurface as Kerry's VP.)\n\nCommand Post simublogs Bush's State of the Union Speech. NYT has the full text.\n\nAnd simublogs Daschle's and Pelosi's response.\n\nBigWig gives the recipe for a third party candidacy. At the time I agreed with him, but the steam seems to have seeped out of the Dean balloon. If he became a third party candidate at this point, I believe it would barely elicit a yawn. Except from Democrats, who would treat him as they're treating Ralph Nader.\n\nPresident Match chooses your candidate for you. [ via TangoMan ] It said I should vote for Lieberman, who knew?\n\nScoble thinks Dean's bloggers blew it.\n\nJay Rosen: Why Are You Such a Loser, Dennis Kucinich? \"That's what CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked the candidate after the votes from New Hampshire were in. How would you answer it?\"\n\nJeff Jarvis: Change and Fear. \"The reason Howard Dean (with Al Gore) lost is that they ran a negative campaign. But the problem wasn't that they were negative about other candidates. It was that they were negative about America.\" I totally agree. Glenn Reynolds has more.\n\nCommand Post covers Dean's withdrawal from the race.\n\nNader to run for president. Again. Pissing off democrats everywhere. I think Dave Winer is exactly right: \"Nader's run separates the people who 'get' American democracy, and those who don't.\" If Nader keeps Kerry from defeating Bush, then Kerry didn't deserve to win in the first place.\n\nArnold thinks foreign-born citizens should be allowed to run for President. He's biased, but I agree; let the best man/woman win. What's so important about where you were born?\n\nDemocratic candidates blast Greenspan comments. \"Greenspan warned a House committee that growing federal budget deficits and the retirement of Baby Boomers will require future cuts in Social Security and Medicare to avoid tax increases that would damage the economy.\" The Dems are shooting the messenger; it is what it is, now what are we going to do about it?\n\nTim Blair says It's All Relative. As Glenn Reynolds summarizes: \"5.6% unemployment: 'low' under Clinton, 'high' under Bush! Go figure.\" Indeed.\n\nThe big news in the California primary elections wasn't that Bush and Kerry won - that was a forgone conclusion - but that Arnold won: California voters OK Schwarzenegger's budget rescue. Suboptimal, but when you're draining a swamp, things are going to stink for a while.\n\nSteven Den Beste nails Kerry as \"the tofu candidate\", and considers Partial Cures.\n\nMore Kerry bashing: check out Kerry vs. Kerry. I'm sure you could do the same with Bush, or with anyone, but it does make you wonder.\n\nSame-Sex Marriage\n\nYep, in the last eight weeks same-sex marriage has gone from a subject of discussion to a legal relationship in Massachusetts. Amazing. And very polarizing. This feels like one of those things which is just plain inevitable, the people who are opposed are rolling boulders uphill. I do think you limit marriage to a union of exactly two people, though.\n\nSan Francisco weds gay couple. And then about 5,000 more!\n\nUntil Arnold says same-sex marriages are illegal.\n\nThe Top Twelve Reasons Against Gay Marriage. [ via Adam Curry ] I like #8, \"Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\"\n\nDon't know if this belongs here, but Barbie and Ken have split! \"Couple 'will remain friends,' says Mattel.\"\n\nOkay, and there's a bunch of other interesting stuff which happened. I'm probably setting a personal record for links in a post, if not a world record, but here you go:\n\nBill Gurley interviews Michael Dell. This is before Dell resigned as CEO (in a planned succession, he remains Chairman). Oh, and here's more.\n\nAdam Curry notes a Goud(a) idea: \"A new Dutch invention can make cars, buses and other vehicles no less than 50 percent more efficient and thus more environmentally friendly\".\n\nWired: Camera Phones Help Buyers Beware. \"During the past six months, no fewer than four software firms have released applications to help consumers turn their camera-equipped mobile phones into personal bar-code scanners.\"\n\nYahoo News: Report Finds \"staggering\" WiFi Growth. [ via Scoble ]\n\nWired News announced their annual Vaporware Awards. I don't know why, but game companies seem particularly prone to pre-announce stuff. Software in general is hard, and the temptation to pre-announce is strong.\n\nA digression, here's some programmer equivalences:\n\nIf something is physically impossible, then it is really hard.\n\nIf something is possible but you don't know how to do it, then it is hard. Even if, once you knew how to do it, it wouldn't take much time or work.\n\nIf you know how to do something, it is easy. Even if it takes a long time and requires lots of work.\n\nIf you know how to do something and it won't take long, then it is done.\n\nKeep these in mind when you read software company press releases.\n\nVC superstars John Doerr, Tim Draper, Jim Breyer, technopundit Esther Dyson, and AlwaysOn editor Tony Perkins prognosticate about the future. My favorite prediction is \"Peer-to-peer technology comes back as the web's most fashionable application\". I agree, particularly the combination of RSS with Bittorrent, a subject for a future post...\n\n\"Abilities required for success in school don't differ greatly from those required in the real world\" - from an American Psychological Association article. I'm shocked. Or as godless notes, maybe the Bell Curve was right. Do you think?\n\nSo there was this 17-year old kid name Mike Rowe. He decided to start a software company, and named it Mike Rowe Soft. Microsoft was not amused.\n\nChina has approved human trials of an experimental SARS vaccine. Wow. Sometimes you can make progress faster if you don't care so much about the subjects, eh?\n\nPorn search engine Booble debuts. And naturally Google is not amused.\n\nGeek humor, courtesy of Tim Bray: \" There's a pirate’s parrot who got a bad case of sunstroke and was heard crowing Pieces of seven, pieces of seven. Which was clearly a parroty error.\"\n\nAOL is offering movie downloads for 99 cents. Cool. And clearly the wave of the future.\n\nDavid Hornik sees Microsoft at CES, and is impressed. Have they leapfrogged Apple? Don't know. I am curiously uninterested in Media Center PCs... Why is that?\n\nScoble meets Garland Wong, CTO of Kinzan, and gets excited.\n\nOttmar Liebert emailed a link to this California Assembly Resolution. \"This measure would urge the California Building Standards Commission to adopt building standards that promote Feng Shui principles and publish these standards in the California Building Standards Code.\" His comment: \"No wonder CA has a deficit :)\". Uh, yeah. Does Arnold know about this?\n\nThe world's worst working conditions? \"As I write this, there is a window open behind me with a small jet engine outside. This is supplying vast amounts of compressed air to the aircraft undergoing heavy maintenance in the hangar right outside my door. There is a 6-inch diameter air hose going through the office and out the door. All this requires that I sit at my desk wearing a body warmer to keep out the cold, and both ear defenders AND ear plugs to keep out the noise.\" So tell us something important, like how big is your monitor?\n\nCNET ponders patents. Yeah, they are offensive. And yeah, they're not going away any time soon...\n\nSpeaking of offensive, the RIAA filed 532 more lawsuits against suspected file sharers. Their PR campaign to win the hearts and minds of music lovers seems a bit misdirected, eh?\n\nCommand Post linked a fascinating study of Kurdistan.\n\nEver consider Google AdSense ads on your blog? I haven't, yet. But here's a handy tool to show you which ads would be displayed on your pages... [ via Mark Frauenfelder ]\n\nCory Doctorow notes Disney is auctioning cool stuff on eBay, like a Space Mountain ride capsule. Hey, I want one! Why? I don't know...\n\nLies, Myths, and Downright Stupidity. In other words, news :) [ via Citizen Smash ]\n\nI always liked Carl Sagan, until I read this story.\n\nMusicplasma finds music you like, by finding music that sounds like music you like. [ via Scoble ]\n\nTivo buys Strangeberry. Okay, now what? (But I do like Arthur van Hoff, because 1) he's Dutch, and 2) he's smart.\n\nBarbara Walters retires after 25 years at 20/20. So be it.\n\nThis just sounds too weird: IBM patents method for paying open source volunteers.\n\nRock veterans Peter Gabriel and Brian Eno are launching a provocative new musicians' alliance that cuts against the industry grain by letting artists sell their music online instead of only through record labels. I'm sure Ottmar is smiling...\n\nTorrentz, a directory of Bittorrent files. [ via Scoble ]\n\nBen's economics. Or explaining the national debt using Oreos. Too bad it isn't that simple :)\n\niPods and the wireless - or how to project your iPods music selections onto a wall. Pretty cool, actually. [ via Tom Coates ]\n\nArs Technica thinks the iPod mini is a smart move for Apple. Let the markets decide!\n\nCory Doctorow vs. Robert Scoble on whether \"open music\" is good for consumers. So I think I agree with Cory, but I own an iPod.\n\nTom Coates weighs in, too. He sounds ambivalent, like I am.\n\nScoble linked a bunch of reactions.\n\nOttmar likes his iPod. As an enemy of lock-in, he doesn't seem perturbed by Apple.\n\nBusiness 2.0: 101 Dumbest moments in business. The website is great, but the magazine is better; get a copy if you can. Very funny and well written.\n\nBig news: Gavyn Davies resigns from the BCC, following reaction to the Hutton report.\n\nAs usual Joel Spolsky is dead on: Please sir may I have a linker. I, too, have spent countless hours dealing with incompatibilities among modules. Link them all together, and you know it will work. Sigh.\n\nEric Sink has a great series of articles: Getting Started with your Own Software Company. Check out his blog, too.\n\nThis sounds like a joke, but it isn't: Microsoft suggests typing in links by hand instead of clicking them. Or maybe they should just fix their bugs, eh?\n\nIf you did type in links by hand, you wouldn't like this; HugeURL converts short URLs into very large ones. \"TinyURL-like services rips all the semantics out of the URLs you send around, gives a third-party a way of spying on which URLs you're loading, and invites man-in-the-middle attacks.\" Uh, right.\n\nChris Sells: When in doubt, ignore Longhorn. Sorry, Scoble.\n\nQTVR of Chinese New Year in New York. Very cool.\n\nTim Bray discusses bouncing termsheets. On the jargon and the way the VC process works...\n\nProving that great scientists are not necessarily good at marketing, a joint Russian / American team synthesizes atomic elements 113 and 115, and names them ununtrium and ununpentium. Huh?\n\nS-Train notes R.I.P. Oldsmobile. \"A classic GMC brand is about to be put out to pasture. The Oldsmobile 2004 line will be last one.\" So be it.\n\nAll the Super Bowl ads on one page. Cool. Oh yeah, there was a football game, too. And a good one! Not to mention a halftime show...\n\nStephen Den Beste writes about What Didn't Happen. Great point.\n\nMatt Haughey notes Tivo's great moment.\n\nAnd Dan Gillmor wonders about a farting horse?

Cool!\n\nDavid Burbridge ponders A New Cognitive Elite? David is smart and he is trying so hard to be objective, but the evidence is gently sweeping him into a corner. IQ does matter, and it does correlate to social standing in today's Western societies.\n\nPhilip Greenspun considers the World's Last Tropical Rainforest. \"Panama is one of the few places in the world where you don't need a hippie environmentalist to talk up the value of the rainforest.\"\n\nCory Doctorow notes Apple is selling DRMed tracks of silence for 99 cents.

[ via Dave Winer ]\n\nHalley extols the virtues of Venice Beach. \"The lush California landscape is so exquisite, I can't keep my eyes off it. The boats, the ocean, the shiny cars, the hills, the fruit trees, the Mexican paint colors of naranjas and lavendar -- this state is like a big candy-stuffed pinata I'm wacking open to see more and more sweets and treats inside.\"\n\nOttmar relays a great annecdote. How cosmic became bosnia. As in, \"I say, Tarquin, this quiche is rather bosnia.\" Well I guess you just have to read it, don't you!\n\nThe Economist: Things Fall Apart. \"What if the dark energy and dark matter essential to modern explanations of the universe don't really exist?\"\n\nJohn Patrick: What's in the News?

Good luck.\n\nJohn Robb picks up the thread, Personal Broadcast Networks. Yeah, they'll be great, but people will use them for watching \"reality\" shows with good looking people pretending to have sex, not to educate themselves. Sorry.\n\nAnd Andrew Grumet builds it! RSSTV, the combination of RSS with Bittorrent. You'll be hearing a lot more about this.\n\nAdam Curry: tulip field. Beautiful!\n\nAlpine makes a car stereo that integrates with an iPod.
