The winners slow down the least. It’s that way with most startups too. The earliest phase is usually the most productive. That’s when they have the really big ideas. Imagine what Apple was like when 100% of its employees were either Steve Jobs or Steve Wozniak. The striking thing about this phase is that it’s completely different from most people’s idea of what business is like. If you looked in people’s heads (or stock photo collections) for images representing “business,” you’d get images of people dressed up in suits, groups sitting around conference tables looking serious, Powerpoint presentations, people producing thick reports for one another to read. Early stage startups are the exact opposite of this. And yet they’re probably the most productive part of the whole economy. Why the disconnect? I think there’s a general principle at work here: the less energy people expend on performance, the more they expend on appearances to compensate. More often than not the energy they expend on seeming impressive makes their actual performance worse. A few years ago I read an article in which a car magazine modified the “sports” model of some production car to get the fastest possible standing quarter mile. You know how they did it? They cut off all the crap the manufacturer had bolted onto the car to make it look fast. Business is broken the same way that car was. The effort that goes into looking productive is not merely wasted, but actually makes organizations less productive. Suits, for example. Suits do not help people to think better. I bet most executives at big companies do their best thinking when they wake up on Sunday morning and go downstairs in their bathrobe to make a cup of coffee. That’s when you have ideas. Just imagine what a company would be like if people could think that well at work. People do in startups, at least some of the time. (Half the time you’re in a panic because your servers are on fire, but the other half you’re thinking as deeply as most people only get to sitting alone on a Sunday morning.)\n\nix\n\n7141FM.qxd\n\nx\n\n12/18/06\n\n11:06 AM\n\nPage x\n\nForeword\n\nDitto for most of the other differences between startups and what passes for productivity in big companies. And yet conventional ideas of “professionalism” have such an iron grip on our minds that even startup founders are affected by them. In our startup, when outsiders came to visit we tried hard to seem “professional.” We’d clean up our offices, wear better clothes, try to arrange that a lot of people were there during conventional office hours. In fact, programming didn’t get done by well-dressed people at clean desks during office hours. It got done by badly dressed people (I was notorious for programming wearing just a towel) in offices strewn with junk at 2 in the morning. But no visitor would understand that. Not even investors, who are supposed to be able to recognize real productivity when they see it. Even we were affected by the conventional wisdom. We thought of ourselves as impostors, succeeding despite being totally unprofessional. It was as if we’d created a Formula 1 car but felt sheepish because it didn’t look like a car was supposed to look. In the car world, there are at least some people who know that a high performance car looks like a Formula 1 racecar, not a sedan with giant rims and a fake spoiler bolted to the trunk. Why not in business? Probably because startups are so small. The really dramatic growth happens when a startup only has three or four people, so only three or four people see that, whereas tens of thousands see business as it’s practiced by Boeing or Philip Morris. This book can help fix that problem, by showing everyone what, till now, only a handful people got to see: what happens in the first year of a startup. This is what real productivity looks like. This is the Formula 1 racecar. It looks weird, but it goes fast. Of course, big companies won’t be able to do everything these startups do. In big companies there’s always going to be more politics, and less scope for individual decisions. But seeing what startups are really like will at least show other organizations what to aim for. The time may soon be coming when instead of startups trying to seem more corporate, corporations will try to seem more like startups. That would be a good thing.

She’s an extraordinarily perceptive reader and she provided a lot of advice that helped make this a better book. Thanks to the people I interviewed for sharing their stories and their time. One thing I noticed in the interviews that I didn’t mention in the introduction is how much I liked the founders. They were genuine and smart, and it was an honor to talk with them. I know the candid nature of their stories and advice will inspire would-be founders for years to come. Thanks to Gary Cornell for being willing to do a different kind of book, and to the Apress team for working on a different kind of book. I’d like to thank many people for their willingness to make introductions: Jim Baum, Patrick Chung, Mark Coker, Jay Corscadden, Rael Dornfest, Jed Dorsheimer, Randy Farmer, Steve Frankel, Anand Gohel, Laurie Glass, James Hong, Mitch Kapor, Morgan Ley, Mike Palmer, Tom Palmer, Bryan Pearce, Andrew Pojani, Will Price, Ryan Singel, Langley Steinert, Chris Sacca, and Zak Stone. Thanks to Kate Courteau for creating cozy offices for me to work in; Lesley Hathaway for all her advice and support; Alaina and David Sloo for their many introductions; and Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Lynn Harris, Marc Hedlund, and Aaron Swartz, who read early chapters of the book. I owe thanks to Lisa Abdalla, Michele Baer, Jen Barron, Ingrid Bassett, Jamie Cahill, Jessica Catino, Alicia Collins, Caitlin Crowe, Julie Ellenbogen, John Gregg, Chrissy Hathaway, Katie Helmer, Susan Livingston, Nadine Miller, Sara Morrison, Bridget O’Brien, Becky Osborne, Allison Pellegrino, Jennifer Stevens, and Suzanne Woodard for their encouragement.

Thanks to the founders of all the startups we’ve funded at Y Combinator. They are inspirations and I know they will have valuable stories of their own to share. Special thanks to Trevor Blackwell and Robert Morris for all of their support. I’m lucky to work with them. To my grandparents, Baba and Bob, who I admire and whose advice from their own experiences as authors helped me a lot. Extra special thanks to Dad and Michele, who supported me even when I had crazy ideas like quitting my job to start a company and work on a book. Over the years, my father never seemed to doubt that I could do something I’d be really proud of, and I’m very appreciative. Most of all, thanks to Paul Graham. He inspired this book and was a source of encouragement and advice throughout the entire process. I’m grateful to have benefited from his extraordinary understanding of technology, startups, and writing. But mostly, I’m glad to know him.\n\n7141FM.qxd\n\n12/18/06\n\n11:06 AM\n\nPage xiii\n\nIntroduction Some kind of magic happens in startups, especially at the very beginning, but the only people there to see it are the founders. The best way to understand what happens is to ask them, so that’s what I did. In this book, you’ll hear the founders’ stories in their own words. Here, I want to share some of the patterns I noticed. When you’re interviewing a series of famous startup founders, you can’t help trying to see if there is some special quality they all have in common that made them succeed. What surprised me most was how unsure the founders seemed to be that they were actually onto something big. Some of these companies got started almost by accident. The world thinks of startup founders as having some kind of superhuman confidence, but a lot of them were uncertain at first about starting a company. What they weren’t uncertain about was making something good— or trying to fix something broken. They all were determined to build things that worked. In fact, I’d say determination is the single most important quality in a startup founder. If the founders I spoke with were superhuman in any way, it was in their perseverance. That came up over and over in the interviews. Perseverance is important because, in a startup, nothing goes according to plan. Founders live day to day with a sense of uncertainty, isolation, and sometimes lack of progress. Plus, startups, by their nature, are doing new things— and when you do new things, people often reject you. That was the second most surprising thing I learned from these interviews: how often the founders were rejected early on. By investors, journalists, established companies—they got the Heisman from everyone. People like the idea of innovation in the abstract, but when you present them with any specific innovation, they tend to reject it because it doesn’t fit with what they already know. Innovations seem inevitable in retrospect, but at the time it’s an uphill battle. It’s curious to think that the technology we take for granted now, like web-based email, was once dismissed as unpromising. As Howard Aiken said, “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas. If your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats.” xiii\n\n7141FM.qxd\n\nxiv\n\n12/18/06\n\n11:06 AM\n\nPage xiv\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn addition to perseverance, founders need to be adaptable. Not only because it takes a certain level of mental flexibility to understand what users want, but because the plan will probably change. People think startups grow out of some brilliant initial idea like a plant from a seed. But almost all the founders I interviewed changed their ideas as they developed them. PayPal started out writing encryption software, Excite started as a database search company, and Flickr grew out of an online game. Starting a startup is a process of trial and error. What guided the founders through this process was their empathy for the users. They never lost sight of making things that people would want. Successful startup founders typically get rich from the process, but the ones I interviewed weren’t in it just for the money. They had a lot of pride in craftsmanship. And they wanted to change the world. That’s why most have gone on to new projects that are just as ambitious. Sure, they’re pleased to have more financial freedom, but the way they choose to use it is to keep building more things. Startups are different from established companies—almost astonishingly so when they are first getting started. It would be good if people paid more attention to this important but often misunderstood niche of the business world, because it’s here that you see the essence of productivity. In its plain form, productivity looks so weird that it seems to a lot of people to be “unbusinesslike.” But if early-stage startups are unbusinesslike, then the corporate world might be more productive if it were less businesslike. My goal with these interviews was to establish a fund of experience that everyone can learn from. You’ll notice certain classes of problems that constantly bit people. All the founders had things they wished they’d known when they were getting started. Now these are captured for future founders. I’m especially hoping this book inspires people who want to start startups. The fame that comes with success makes startup founders seem like they’re a breed apart. Perhaps if people can see how these companies actually started, it will be less daunting for them to envision starting something of their own. I hope a lot of the people who read these stories will think, “Hey, these guys were once just like me. Maybe I could do it too.”\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 1\n\nC H\n\nA\n\nP\n\nT\n\n1\n\nE\n\nR\n\nMax Levchin Cofounder, PayPal PayPal was founded in December 1998 by recent college grad Max Levchin and hedge fund manager Peter Thiel. The company went through several ideas, including cryptography software and a service for transmitting money via PDAs, before finding its niche as a web-based payment system. That service became wildly popular for online vendors, especially eBay sellers, who preferred it to traditional payment methods. PayPal went public in early 2002 and was acquired later that year by eBay for $1.5 billion. PayPal was started during the Internet Bubble, but it was in no sense a Bubble startup. Its success was a direct reflection of the intelligence of the people who built it. PayPal won because they built a better mousetrap. With any new method of moving money comes new forms of fraud. In large part, PayPal succeeded because it could deal with fraud—and its competitors couldn’t. The software that Levchin and his team developed to combat fraud runs quietly and invisibly. To this day, PayPal doesn’t talk much about it. But Levchin’s software was just as much the reason for PayPal’s success as a more visible product like the Apple II was for Apple. Livingston: Tell me a little about how PayPal got started. Levchin: The company was really not founded to do payments at all. My focus\n\nin college was security. I wanted to do crypto and stuff like that. I had already founded three different companies during college and the year after, which I spent in Champaign-Urbana, where I went to school. Then, in favor of not doing graduate school, I decided to move out to Silicon Valley and try to start another company. So I was hanging around Silicon Valley in the summer of ’98 and was not really sure what I was going to do with my life. I was living in Palo Alto, squatting 1\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n2\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 2\n\nFounders at Work\n\non the floor of a friend. I went to see this random lecture at Stanford—given by a guy named Peter, who I had heard about, but never met before. The lecture turned out to have only six people in it. It was in the heat of the summer, so nobody showed up. This guy was like, “There are only six of you, OK.” Afterwards I walked up to talk to him. He was this really intense guy, and he said, “We should get breakfast sometime.” So we met up the next week. I had two different ideas that I was considering starting companies around, and I pitched him on both evenly. Peter was running a hedge fund at the time. For a few weeks we kept talking, and eventually he said, “Take this idea, because this one is better, and you go start a company around it, and then I can have my hedge fund invest a little bit of money in it”—like a couple hundred thousand dollars. That was a good thing, since I was starting to run out of money. I had just moved from Champaign; most of my contacts and friends were in Chicago. One of them I was trying to convince to be the CEO. He wasn’t really available, so I wound up being without a CEO. I called Peter and said, “This investment is a great thing, but I have no one to run the company. I’m just going to write the code and recruit the coders.” And he said, “Maybe I could be your CEO.” So I said, “That’s a really good idea.” The next 2 weeks we were sort of playing with the idea, and by 1/1/99 we agreed that he would be the CEO and I would be the CTO. Livingston: How did you have the idea? Levchin: The initial idea was actually very different. At the time, I was really\n\ninto developing software for handheld devices, which is sort of an art and a science unto its own. And I was really into security. This idea that I had in college, which I was vaguely successful with—if you’ve ever seen these authentication devices, like a little card that spits out numbers at you that you can log in with. It’s like a one-time password generator, like S/Key, Digital Pathways, and CRYPTOCard. Most of the algorithms are variations on the standard called X9.9, which is a public standard. The algorithms don’t really use it correctly. In college one day I had bought all the different kinds of cards. Each costs like $50 or $100, so it’s not that expensive. They weren’t that difficult to reverseengineer because you already know the standard, so you know it can’t be too far outside the standard. I reverse-engineered most of them except for one which was very proprietary. I decided not to touch that one since I was too poor to handle a lawsuit. Once I got them all reverse-engineered, I wrote an emulator for every single type of them for a Palm Pilot. I had a lot of friends on campus who were really into security as well—most of them were sys admins—and they carried a whole bunch of these things in their pockets, because most of the time you can only use one per computer, per system. If you adminned a lab with ten servers, you’d have a stack of these things in your pocket, and that adds up. They are heavy, and they need batteries. I basically emulated the whole thing on a Palm Pilot so my friends were able to throw out their stupid devices and use my thing.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 3\n\nMax Levchin 3\n\nI posted it on the Web, which was young and silly then, and I got hundreds and then thousands of downloads, and people were offering me money to get more features in. So I thought, “This seems to be a business.” At the time, I was just keen on getting any sort of business off the ground. So, when I moved to the Valley, I basically pitched Peter on the following concept. There’s clearly demand for moving these cryptographic operations that are poorly understood. Even though it’s not rocket science to reverse-engineer this stuff, no one else had done it before me, so there’s some complexity involved. The real difficult thing actually was getting an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm on a Palm Pilot, because Palm Pilots are very low power, and, back then, they were really low power—like a 16 MHz processor. So, to do an encryption of a public key operation on a Palm Pilot was really expensive. There is some art involved in how you speed it up—both from the user interface perspective and the math perspective. In math, you have to see how much you can squeeze out of it, and in the user interface, you have to make it feel like it’s not taking that long, even though it really is taking like 2 seconds, which is a really long time. On these handheld devices, the cards that you get, you type in the password and it’s done. I was able to get it to the point where it was instantaneous on a Palm Pilot. These things are all sort of child’s play at this point, but at the time they were very important. Anyway, I wanted to start a company that would take this scarce skill of implementing crypto on handheld devices and then packaging it into libraries and products. The assumption was that the enterprises are going to all go to handheld devices really soon as the primary means of communication. Every corporate dog in America will hang around with a Palm Pilot or some kind of a device. What I wanted to do was capitalize on that emergence of technology. And then, of course, enterprise requires security; security requires these scarce skills; I have the skills; start a company. So that’s what Peter funded. By the time he joined, we had realized that, even though the theory was pretty much logical, the move of the enterprise to handheld devices was actually not forthcoming. Kind of like the early Christians in the first century were all really hard at work waiting for the second coming. Still waiting. So it felt like the early Christians. “Any minute now, there’ll be millions of people begging for security on their handheld devices.” It just wasn’t happening. We were correct to change our strategy, since it still hasn’t happened. Livingston: Tell me about how you adapted the strategy. Levchin: Initially, I wanted to do crypto libraries, since I was a freshly minted\n\nacademic. “I won’t even need to figure out how to do this commercialization part. I’m just going to build libraries, sell it to somebody who is going to build software, and I can just sit there and make a penny per copy and get marvelously rich very quickly.” But no one was making the software because there was no demand. So we said, “We’ll make the software.” We went to enterprises and told them we were going to do this and got some positive reception, but then the thing happened again where no one really wants the stuff. It’s really cool, it’s mathematically complex, it’s very secure, but no one really needed it.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n4\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 4\n\nFounders at Work\n\nBy then we had built all this tech that was complicated and difficult to understand and replicate, so we thought, “We have all these libraries that allow you to secure anything on handheld devices. What can we secure? Maybe we can secure some consumer stuff. So enterprises will go away, and we’ll go to consumers. We’ll build the wallet application—something that can store all of your private data on your handheld device. So your credit card information, this and that.” And we did, and it was very simple because we already had all the crypto stuff figured out. But, of course, there was no incentive to have a wallet with all these digital items that you couldn’t apply anywhere. “What’s my credit card number?” Pull out your wallet and look, or pull out your handheld wallet and look? So that was really not going to happen either. Then we started experimenting with the question: “What can we store inside the Palm Pilot that is actually meaningful?” So the next iteration was that we’d store things that were of value and you wouldn’t store in other ways. For example, storing passwords in your wallet is a really bad idea. If you store them in your Palm Pilot, you can secure it further with a secondary passphrase that protects it. So we did that, and it was getting a little bit of attention, but it was still very amateur. Then finally we hit on this idea of, “Why don’t we just store money in the handheld devices?” The next iteration was this thing that would do cryptographically secure IOU notes. I would say, “I owe you $10,” and put in my passphrase. It wasn’t really packaged at the user interface level as an IOU, but that’s what it effectively was. Then I could beam it to you, using the infrared on a Palm Pilot, which at this point is very quaint and silly since, clearly, what would you rather do, take out $5 and give someone their lunch share, or pull out two Palm Pilots and geek out at the table? But that actually is what moved the needle, because it was so weird and so innovative. The geek crowd was like, “Wow. This is the future. We want to go to the future. Take us there.” So we got all this attention and were able to raise funding on that story. Then we had the famous Buck’s beaming—at Buck’s restaurant in Woodside, which is sort of the home away from home for many VCs. Our first round of financing was actually transferred to us via Palm Pilot. Our VCs showed up with a $4.5 million preloaded Palm Pilot, and they beamed it to us. The product wasn’t really finished, and about a week before the beaming at Buck’s I realized that we weren’t going to be able to do it, because the code wasn’t done. Obviously it was really simple to mock it up—to sort of go, “Beep! Money is received.” But I was so disgusted with the idea. We have this security company; how could I possibly use a mock-up for something worth $4.5 million? What if it crashes? What if it shows something? I’ll have to go and commit ritual suicide to avoid any sort of embarrassment. So instead of just getting the mock-up done and getting reasonable rest, my two coders and I coded nonstop for 5 days. I think some people slept; I know I didn’t sleep at all. It was just this insane marathon where we were like, “We have to get this thing working.” It actually wound up working perfectly. The beaming was at 10:00 a.m.; we were done at 9:00 a.m.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 5\n\nMax Levchin 5\n\nIt was one of these things where you can’t just be done. With crypto, if you are one bit off, nothing’s going to work. We started testing at midnight the night before and fixed all the bugs and tested more. There were definitely some memory leaks, but it was secure. It was one of these things where the software wasn’t perfect, but the security path where the money changed hands was definitely provably secure. The danger was that the Palm Pilots might crash, but the transaction was perfectly safe. I could have bet my own life on the transaction. The thing that was not safe was just the software was not really perfect. It was clunky; I was worried that it might crash. So we had stacks and stacks of Palm Pilots preloaded with the same software. Obviously, money could only reside in one of them, but the plan was that, if I see that any one of them is crashing, I’m going to make a fresh pair, because we needed two Palm Pilots, one for the receiving and one for the sending. I was fully prepared. They were marked, “Sender A, Sender B, Sender C, Receiver A, Receiver B, Receiver C.” So I had this stack of Palm Pilots, I hopped in a car, drove to Buck’s, and it was like 9:50 a.m. Peter was getting very anxious about the whole thing. That’s where everything becomes very blurry, because I was so tired by then. There were about a dozen TV cameras and journalists—there was really big coverage. We did the beaming, and some group showed up late and said, “Well, can you do it again?” I said, “No, I just slaved away for 5 days straight—for 5 months straight. The whole point of the security is that you can’t replicate the transaction. Once it’s done, the money has changed hands.” So these guys actually made Peter pretend like it was going to happen and turned away the screen—because the screen was actually saying, “Security breach! Don’t try to resend the same money again.” Which was a triumph for me, but a pain in the ass for the camera. As I was getting interviewed by the Wall Street Journal, or some big pub guy, all I remember was that he went off to the bathroom for a second, and they brought out my omelet. The next thing I remember, I woke up, and I was on the side of my own omelet, and there was no one at Buck’s. Everyone was gone. They just let me sleep. Livingston: What did you do first after you got this new funding? Levchin: As soon as we got funding, we started hiring aggressively, and we built\n\nthis app for the Palm Pilot, which was getting pretty good growth. We were getting 300 users a day. Then we built a demo for the website, which was functional, so you could do everything on the website that you could do on a Palm Pilot, except the website was unsexy and we didn’t really care. It was like, “Go to the website and download the Palm Pilot version. It’s really cool.” Livingston: Three hundred people were downloading it per day? For fun? Levchin: Well, there are lots of geeks. It slowed down pretty quickly too, but\n\ninitially we got a lot of publicity about it. Sometime by early 2000, we realized that all these people were trying to use the website for transactions, and the growth of that was actually more\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n6\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 6\n\nFounders at Work\n\nimpressive than the growth of the handheld device one, which was inexplicable, because the handheld device one was cool and the website was just a demo. Then all these people from a site called eBay were contacting us and saying, “Can I put your logo in my auction?” And we were like, “Why?” So we told them, “No. Don’t do it.” So for a while we were fighting, tooth and nail, crazy eBay people: “Go away, we don’t want you.” Eventually we realized that these guys were begging to be our users. We had the moment of epiphany, and for the next 12 months just iterated like crazy on the website version of the product, which is today’s PayPal. Sometime by late 2000, we killed the handheld one because we peaked out at 12,000 users. They were still using it a little bit, and they were really upset when we killed it. They said, “You were about the handheld transactions, not about this web stuff.” We’re like, “No, we’re pretty much about the web stuff.” Livingston: How many users did you have for the website when you killed the\n\nhandheld product? Levchin: I think we must have been 1.2 . . . 1.5 million users. It was an emo-\n\ntional but completely obvious business decision. Livingston: When did you first notice fraudulent behavior? Levchin: From day one. It was pretty funny because we met with all these\n\npeople in the banking and credit card processing industry, and they said, “Fraud is going to eat you for lunch.” We said, “What fraud?” They said, “You’ll see, you’ll see.” I actually had an advisor or two from the financial industry, and they said, “Get ready for chargebacks. You need to have some processing in place.” We said, “Uh huh.” They said, “You don’t know what a chargeback is, do you?” Livingston: So you didn’t foresee this fraud? Levchin: I had no idea what was going to happen. Livingston: But you weren’t too surprised? Levchin: We tried to attack the system for ourselves, like a good security person\n\nwould. How can you cheat and steal money and do whatever? We made some provisions from day one to prevent fraud. We prevented all the obvious fraud, and then, I think 6 months into it, we saw the first chargeback and were like, “Ah, one per week. OK.” Then it was like an avalanche of losses; 2000 was basically the year of fraud, where we were just losing more and more and more money every month. At one point we were losing over $10 million per month in fraud. It was crazy. That was when I decided that that was going to be my next challenge. I started researching it, figuring out what could be done and attacking the problem. Livingston: So you made a conscious decision to attack this problem? Levchin: It was actually sort of a side effect. We had this merger with a com-\n\npany called X.com. It was a bit of a tough merger because the companies were\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 7\n\nMax Levchin 7\n\nreally competitive—we were two large competitors in the same market. For a while, Peter took some time off. The guy who ran X.com became the CEO, and I remained the CTO. He was really into Windows, and I was really into Unix. So there was this bad blood for a while between the engineering teams. He was convinced that Windows was where it’s at and that we have to switch to Windows, but the platform that we used was, I thought, built really well and I wanted to keep it. I wanted to stay on Unix. By summer 2000, it seemed like the Windows thing was going to happen because Peter was gone. He took a sabbatical to make sure there were no clashes between the CEOs. So, this other guy was pushing me toward accepting that Windows was going to be the platform. I said, “Well, if this is really going to happen, I’m not going to be able to provide much value, because I don’t really know anything about Windows. I went to a school that was all Unix all the time, and I spent all my life coding for Unix.” I had this intern that I hired before the merger, and we thought, “We built all these cool Unix projects, but it’s kind of pointless now because they are going to scrap the platform. We might as well do something else.” So he and I decided we were going to find ourselves fun projects. We did one kind of mean project where we built a load tester package that would beat up on the Windows prototype (the next version was going to be in Windows). We built a load tester that would test against the Unix platform and the new Windows one and show in beautiful graphs that the Windows version had 1 percent of the scalability of the Unix one. “Do you really want to do that?” It was me acting out, but it was kind of a low time for me because I was not happy with the way we were going. Part of having a CEO is that you can respectfully disagree, but you can resign if you don’t like it that much. But then eventually I became interested in the economics of PayPal and trying to see what’s going on in the back end, because I was getting distracted from code and technology. I realized that we were losing a lot more money in fraud than I thought we were. It was still early 2001. If you looked at the actual loss rates, they were fairly low. You could see that we were losing money, but, given the growth of the system and the growth of the fraud, fraud was not that big of a problem. It was less than 1 percent—it was really low. But then, if you looked at the rate of growth of fraud, you could see that, if you don’t stop it, it would become 5 percent, 10 percent of the system, which would have been prohibitive. So I started freaking out over it, and this intern and I wrote all sorts of packages—very statistical stuff—to analyze “How did it happen; how do we lose money?” By the end of the summer, we thought, “The world is going to end any minute now.” It was obvious that we were really losing tons of money. By midsummer, it was already on a $10 million range per month and just very scary. Livingston: Did the rest of the company know you were right? Levchin: Through the summer, I think various people were slowly coming to\n\nunderstand that this thing was really serious. It was pretty obvious at a certain point. I didn’t have to really convince anyone. In the beginning some people\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n8\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 8\n\nFounders at Work\n\nsaid, “Yes, it’s a lot of money, but we’re really growing, too. As an absolute amount, $5 million is a lot of losses, but, if you are processing $300 million, whatever.” There was actually a bit of an altercation at the very top management level, which caused the CEO to leave. Peter came back as the CEO. The first decision that he and I took was that my new job—in addition to technology—was going to be this fraud thing, because I already spent so much time looking at it. This guy Bob, the intern, and I—I convinced him to drop out of Stanford for a year and work with me more on it—for the next year, we just worked nonstop on trying to understand and fix these problems. Livingston: So the CEO left and Peter came back? Levchin: The three of us are pretty good friends now. At the time, already I had\n\nhated the guy’s guts for forcing me to do Windows, and then, in the end, I was like, “You gotta go, man.” My whole argument to him was, “We can’t switch to Windows now. This fraud thing is most important to the company. You can’t allow any additional changes. It’s one of these things where you want to change one big thing at a time, and the fraud is a pretty big thing. So introducing a new platform or doing anything major—you just don’t want to do it right now.” That was sort of the trigger for a fairly substantial conflict that resulted in him leaving and Peter coming back and me taking over fraud. Livingston: When was the first time that you said, “This is working”? Levchin: Bob and I built this package called IGOR. We had all these different\n\nthings that were all named after various Russian names—and they had to be four characters long and start with an I. It was sort of a random requirement that I came up with. We had IGOR, INGA, IVAN—at least two more. So we built this tool—actually we have a patent on it now—and it was very impressive. It’s based on the assumption of all sorts of convoluted guesses on our part, but the guesses turn out to be mostly right. We actually had these human investigators, like 20 to 30 human investigators, that would try to unravel particularly large fraud cases and see if we could recover some money or send the Feds after somebody. We didn’t really have much success sending people after criminals. All they’d try to do is see where the money went and see if we could recover some of it before it left the system. That was pretty difficult to do because the tools we had available to us at the time allowed you to look at only a couple of accounts at the same time. If you had a well-coordinated fraud, with thousands of accounts or hundreds of thousands of accounts involved, you basically didn’t know how to follow it. I remember walking into the cubicle of one of the investigators, and he had volumes and volumes of printouts. I asked what it all was, and he said, “I’m tracing some money.” I said, “How many cases is this?” And he said, “This is just one case.” I said, “How much money are we talking about?” He said, “It’s like $80,000 worth of losses.” “Well, that’s a lot of money, but it’s taken you clearly at least a week to print this stuff out.”\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 9\n\nMax Levchin 9\n\nWe realized that the way we were attacking these things was just fundamentally flawed. So Bob and I built this system that was part visualization package, part graph balancing tool, that would try to represent large-scale travels of money in the system in a visual form. Taking that as a base, we built all these different tools that would allow computers to predict where particularly expensive losses would be and then represent the networks of losses to the investigators in such a way that they could very quickly make a decision whether or not to pursue a particular case. Once we had that, I sort of had this tearful moment with one of the investigators where she was just crying in happiness—“You don’t even understand what you did, Max”—when we showed it to them. They were really overworked. Once that happened, there was this huge reduction. It wasn’t like 80 percent or anything. But, all this time, we had all these different ideas and we’d bring the fraud down one-tenth of a percent or one-fifth of a percent, but it was really not noticeable. Then, one day, we brought the fraud down with that tool, a lot. So we’re clearly getting better at this. Then a woman named Sarah Imbach went into a sort of self-initiated exile. She moved to Omaha and first became the manager of the fraud group and then eventually became the manager of the whole center. When the fraud group operations moved to Omaha, that made it a lot cheaper for us to run. She was working on the human management part—all the investigators—and I would be supplying her with software. Between those things, we got fraud pretty well under control in about a year. Livingston: So the fraud solution was a combination of humans and software? Levchin: Depending on who you ask. I think Sarah feels that it’s probably more\n\nhumans and the coders think it’s more technology. It’s one of those things where, in the end, fraud is so nondeterministic that you need a human or a quantum computer to look at it and sort of make a final decision, because, in the end, it’s people’s money. You don’t really want some computer saying, “$2.00 for you, nothing for you.” You need a human with a brain to say, “Hmm. This looks like fraud, but I really don’t think it is.” Then there are various processes and exception handling where you say, “Even though it’s fraud, you don’t handle it because . . .” We got really good at it later on. Initially, we sorted things by loss, but then we started sorting things by expected loss. We’d estimate the probability of losses programmatically, and then we’d get the amount of money in question calculated, figure out the expected loss, and then sort the cases for the investigators by expected loss. The investigators would only have to deal with the top 5 percent. You’d never go through the entire queue of things for them to judge, but, because they judge things pretty quickly, they would go through half the queue, and they would inevitably start with the ones we thought were the highest possible loss. So, the highest probable, the highest possible. That was one of the techniques that we used to guide development.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n10\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 10\n\nFounders at Work\n\nLivingston: Were any of your competitors doing anything similar? Levchin: We kept the stuff under wraps for a very long time. We never really\n\nshowed IGOR to anyone. We never talked about it in the press. I was definitely very paranoid. Initially, when we built it, we had a conference room where there was the IGOR terminal, and people would go in there, use it, and leave. There were no other copies available. Eventually, various federal and state authorities wanted to use it too, because they started to see that we were getting pretty good at this stuff. We would invite them in, and they would have to go into the room and use it and leave. They couldn’t take it with them, couldn’t print. Livingston: Did you patent this technique? Levchin: I didn’t really want to patent it because, for one, I don’t like software\n\npatents, and, two, if you patent it, you make it public. Even if you don’t know someone’s infringing, they will still be getting the benefit. Instead, we just chose to keep it a trade secret and not show it to anyone. After a while, IGOR became well known to the company, like all the other tools that we had built early on. We had patented some of it, and some of it we said, “OK, it’s open for wide use now.” There’s still a whole bunch of tools that they are using today that are not public. They don’t talk about it much at all, and I think that’s a good thing. Livingston: So is PayPal in a sense a security company? Levchin: I think a good way to describe PayPal is: a security company pretend-\n\ning to be a financial services company. What PayPal does is judge the risk of a transaction and then occasionally actually take the risk on. You don’t really know the money’s good; you just sort of assess the riskiness of both parties, and you say, “I’ll be the intermediary with the understanding that, on occasion, PayPal will be on the hook for at least part of the loss if the loss occurs.” Which is very tricky; it’s a hard position to be in. So the company’s core expertise, by definition, has to be in this ability to judge risk—to be able to say, “Is this the kind of transaction I really want to take on or is this something I should steer away from because you people look like thieves?” I think that’s the security part. I mean, security not in any sort of a sense of anti-hacking defensive, but just security in a broader sense: risk assessment, figuring out what’s the sane thing to do, what’s unsafe, what’s safe. Everything else that PayPal has built is sort of a commodity. The reason we had so many competitors in 2000 was because it looks really simple on the outside: you sign up, give us some credit card numbers, let’s trade some money, done. Livingston: What did you do that your competitors couldn’t? Levchin: The really complicated part is figuring out the risk. The financial\n\nindustry people understood the risk, but they weren’t willing to do the sort of stuff we did, where they would basically say, “Bad guys over here. Let’s get all the bad guys out.”\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 11\n\nMax Levchin 11\n\nThere are tools to just say, “Give me your social security number, give me your address and your mother’s maiden name, and we send you a physical piece of paper and you sign it and send it back to us.” By the time that’s all accomplished, you are a very safe user. But by then you are also not a user, because for every step you have to take, the dropoff rate is probably 30 percent. If you take ten steps, and each time you lose one-third of the users, you’ll have no users by the time you’re done with the fourth step. The point is, the startups didn’t realize there was this risk. We didn’t really realize there was this risk component either when we started. But we were just lucky enough . . . Maybe I should be thankful for that happy year of boredom when I was expecting Windows and digging into stuff, figuring out what fraud was all about. But one way or the other—whatever caused that—we were smart enough to realize that fraud was a huge issue very quickly, and then were successful enough combating it while the startup competitors of ours did not and got buried very quickly. I remember all these companies announcing that they were going out of business and they expected PayPal to go out of business soon too, because the fraud numbers were so staggering that they could not see anyone handling this sort of thing. There was one company—I think it was eMoneyMail—that shut down the company at a conference basically saying that the Internet is not a safe place to conduct transactions. They had 25 percent fraud. So for every $4.00 changing hands in the system, $1.00 was stolen. And it was all coming out of their pocket. They said, “We lost a ton of money,” and they just quit. Then, people like Citibank and other large financial institutions that also competed with us that understood the fraud thing very well—they knew from many years of practice that this was going to become a big problem—didn’t really approach it with the same happy abandon that we did. We started with this, “Fraud is going to kill us. What can we do to save ourselves?” They started from, “We have no fraud. How can we build this and not let any more fraud in?” Which is the wrong position to start because you are limiting your users, and new users learning about a new system really don’t want to be restricted. Livingston: Why do you think they thought that way? Levchin: I think there’s a very strong power of default where, to them, certain behavior to solve a particular problem is well understood. There are people that make careers out of risk management in big banks. They know that what you do is this and you don’t do that. The other part, I think, is that a lot of them are public companies. We didn’t go public until we had the fraud thing figured out. Somebody like Citibank or anyone with a substantial public visibility announcing that they are suddenly bleeding out $10 million a month in fraud would send serious shocks through the investor base. But I think, even if they did that, it’s likely they wouldn’t have been successful because—we had talked to a lot of them both as a potential acquirer and as partnership potential—none of them had actually ever gone to the sort of stuff that we did for our anti-fraud work.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 12\n\nFounders at Work\n\nThe default of how you do these things is very powerful, if you’ve been in the industry for a long time. So we were sort of beneficiaries of our naïveté. We thought, “We don’t know how to do this; let’s just invent it.” Livingston: What else worried you? Levchin: There was always something, every day. I could not sleep well for\n\n4 years. If you are in charge of technology at a really fast-growing company that gets lots of publicity, there’s always something that worries you. In early 2000, it was scalability. We had a few days when the site was down. Even though we were adding servers and rewriting code to be more scalable, at a certain point the original design was starting to crack. It was kind of painful. Peter was pretty good at insulating me. He’d be talking to the reporters saying, “We’re growing so fast.” eBay lost, I think, 20 percent of their market cap one time—they had this downtime, when the system went down because of scalability concerns a few years before and so the reporters were asking, “Is this like eBay? Are you guys going to be down for a week?” So it was really tense. Livingston: What were some of the more intense moments? Levchin: One of the more intense moments was when Peter and our PR guy\n\nwere flabbergasted with this reporter who demanded to talk to someone technical, because he wanted to hear from the horse’s mouth what’s going to happen. I was on the phone with the guy, and he asked, “Is this just like eBay? Are you guys going to crash? Are you not going to be able to scale?” I said, “Dude, I haven’t slept for 3 days trying to fix the problem.” Of course he said, “I’m going to quote you on that.” Peter was worried. It’s one of those things where you have to fly by the seat of your pants all the time. It would be nice to test some hardware and set up a big lab: “We have x systems now; let’s 2x the systems and get twice the amount of hardware and see if it can scale.” But, it doesn’t work that way because, by the time you are done testing 2x, the real system is 3x because the growth is so fast. We were getting 20,000 new active users every day. The transactional growth is exponential because people are sticking around. It’s not like people came in, did one thing, and left. They came in, did one thing, and stayed. And they kept doing more. Livingston: Was the growth viral? Levchin: We built the system to be viral from day one. The idea was: I can send\n\nyou the money, even if you aren’t a member. If I send you $10, you get an email saying, “You have $10 waiting for you. Sign up, and you can take it.” That’s the most powerful viral driver there is. Free money available to you. For eBay buyers and sellers, it became this crazy loop where buyers would be like, “I want to pay you with PayPal,” and sellers would be like, “I don’t accept PayPal.” And buyers would say, “That’s OK. I’ll just send you $10, and you can sign up.” So the seller would get infected, and the seller would say, “Oh, this is really simple, so I only accept PayPal.” Livingston: Any other turning points?\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 13\n\nMax Levchin 13\n\nLevchin: Peter and I like to reflect on the fact that we got lucky so many times.\n\nPick any one episode in the company history, and we got lucky and lucky and lucky again. I think it’s luck in the sense that we could have collapsed under this particular one, and we didn’t. Mostly we didn’t because we did something about it, and we corrected the problem or caught onto it early enough. But I think the fact that we caught the signs early enough in part is a luck thing because we could have just missed it, or we could have been too tired or too bored. Livingston: Was there ever a time when you wanted to quit? Levchin: The Windows thing was the closest I ever came to contemplating\n\nbeing out, but I probably wouldn’t have done it anyway. I was still really attached to the company. Livingston: What was one of the most surprising things to you? Levchin: It was all surprising. Nonstop learning of things that I didn’t really\n\nknow before. The most surprising thing was how big it became. I never thought it was going to be that big. I think I told Peter, “If we ever get to be 25 people, I’ll probably quit because I like small companies. Is that OK?” The next time we talked about it, we already had 75 people, so I sort of missed my window. He said, “Why don’t you stick around till 100, and we’ll see what happens?” Next time we talked, we had 1,000 people. Livingston: What advice would you give to a young programmer who’s thinking\n\nof starting a startup? Levchin: Try to have a good cofounder. I think it’s all about people, and, if you\n\nare doing it completely alone, it’s really hard. It’s not impossible, in particular if you are a loner and introverted type, but it’s still really hard. One of the ways PayPal changed me is that I used to be really introverted, and I sort of still am, but not anywhere near to the extent that I used to be. A big part of it was that I had run a company before PayPal, alone, and I thought it was fine. I could deal with it. But, you only can count on energy sources and support sources from yourself. There’s really no one else who you can go to and say, “Hey, this thing is going to fall apart any minute now. What the hell are we going to do?” The thing that kept us going in the early days was the fact that Peter and I always knew that both of us would not be in a funk together. When I was like, “This fraud thing is going to kill us,” Peter said, “No, I’ve seen the numbers. You are doing fine. Just keep at it. You’ll get it.” On the flip side, when Peter would be annoyed by some investors or board dynamics or whatever, I was usually there trying to support him. That sort of sounds touchy-feely, but I think you have to really have good people. If you have a good team, you are halfway there. Even more importantly, perhaps, you have to have a really strong cofounder. Someone you can rely on in a very fundamental way.\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n14\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 14\n\nFounders at Work\n\nLivingston: Did you feel that way about Peter when you started? Levchin: We hit it off really quickly. I have this IQ bias—anybody really smart,\n\nI will figure out a way to deal with. It was very positive. Both of us are really competitive and really—not mistrusting, but not willing to assume that the other guy knows what he’s talking about. When we met, we sort of hung out socially, and then one night we had this showdown where we sat around in this café for like 8 hours and traded puzzles to see who could solve puzzles faster—just this nonstop mental beating on each other. I think after that we realized that we each couldn’t be total idiots since we could solve puzzles pretty quickly. We would constantly try to come up with ones that the other person wouldn’t be able to solve. I’m really into puzzles. I’m not a very quick solver, so I tend to take a long time. Not always, but on occasion, I will take a lot longer than an average time to solve it, but I almost always will succeed. I think in a big way, the reason for PayPal’s success is that I got very lucky with Peter as a cofounder, and I’d like to think he got pretty lucky with me. Livingston: Who did you learn things from? Levchin: There are different segments to running a startup. Different people\n\ntaught me different things. A lot of the top management people at PayPal were really good. It was very fun and meaningful to work with them and pick up their various interests and skills. I never really paid much attention in college in econ, and I never really took any accounting classes. One night I came over to our CFO’s office, and I said, “I really don’t understand a lot of the balance sheet math and all this stuff. I’m pretty good at math, so I should be able to get it, but I just don’t understand the language, so teach me accounting.” We had this crazy multihour session where he was explaining accounting to me. I learned debits and credits and why certain things are called what they are; liabilities versus assets and capital. Until then, I had no idea. It was maybe a year into the company, and I thought, “I really should understand this balance sheet stuff. It’s kind of an art.” I had never really raised money before, so when Peter was raising money, I was tagging along as much as I could, trying to pick that up. Livingston: Did you have a good relationship with your investors? Levchin: It’s one of these things where, if you look back now, when everyone\n\nwalked away with a ton of money, everyone loves everyone. We had this great time, etc. It’s generally more complicated than that where, when the company is doing well, they’re happy and they think they’re great. The company’s not doing well; they’ve overpaid and they’ve been too nice. It’s half and half. I think I was blissfully spared a lot of it because Peter managed the board much more than I did. I was on the board all through my tenure there, but a lot of the more unpleasant conversations were handled by Peter. I got involved more as the fraud thing grew. For a long time, it was one of these things where—I was really much younger than now—my whole “brand” both to the investors and to our\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 15\n\nMax Levchin 15\n\nboard members was this crazy Russian boy-genius who comes out and sprinkles magic dust on technology and things just work. So for a long time I got away with, “Don’t ask how it works. Max will solve it.” It worked OK until the scalability problems hit us, and then I had to be much more vocal and explain to the board, “Here’s what’s going on. Here’s what I’m doing about it. It will be OK. Just chill out.” Then, when the fraud thing became my primary concern, obviously I had to get involved much more because it had to do with things they dealt with on a daily basis: money. So I had to prepare much more thoroughly. The whole boy-genius thing had to be discarded for the much more serious attitude and language. Livingston: Looking back, is there anything you would have done differently? Levchin: No. Livingston: You didn’t make any mistakes? Levchin: There are all sorts of tactical decisions that we made here and there\n\nthat played out to be wrong, but it’s not like I could have predicted it. It’s not one of these things that I’m now smarter and therefore I could have done it even better. I think, given the information available at the time, I would have likely chosen the same outcome. There are some business decisions that I think we made incorrectly, where we partnered with some companies, but generally in financial industries, partnerships are not . . . we got screwed and had to back out, but, in retrospect, these are not major. I think we hired the absolute best people, we were able to do things pretty well on average, and we had lots of fun. Livingston: Did things change a lot after PayPal was acquired? Levchin: I think the acquirers tend to be more—it pays to be different from the\n\nfounders; otherwise, you still have this clinging-on of the original culture. It’s very sad that, when you buy a company, you have to sort of squash a lot of the original stuff, but if you don’t, you foster this festering of distrust and dislike. So you just have to get through the unpleasant bits as fast as you can and go on doing business. Which doesn’t make it any easier for the early people or the founders, but I don’t know any other format in which you can acquire companies. You could let them be on their own, but then you aren’t really getting any of the benefits. Usually, when you acquire companies, you sort of calculate these synergies, which is this nebulous number: if we take you and we take me and we combine it, we can get rid of this much stuff and this many people. It’s really painful to hear about it, but that’s why people buy companies. eBay bought us because, for a while, they had their own floundering payment service. They had 65 people that were doing this thing called Billpoint that was an also-ran in the payment space. They did particularly poorly. Even though they were bought by eBay and they were the eBay solution, they still got completely smashed by us. The ultimate justice was carried out when they bought us and they announced to those people that they were going to be let go. It’s really painful. I wouldn’t want to be on their side at all. Finding out that you’re being told to\n\n7141CH01.qxd\n\n16\n\n12/5/06\n\n10:21 AM\n\nPage 16\n\nFounders at Work\n\npack up and being replaced by these people that you’d fought all this time with. The mothership has capitulated, and they’re replacing us with the people we’ve been fighting against. Livingston: What can big companies do to preserve a startup culture? Levchin: I don’t know. Less PowerPoints. I think PayPal—even by the time we\n\nwere acquired—still felt really startup in a variety of ways. But not as much as originally. People were definitely grumbling about how the startup culture was being lost, even internally. But then, when we got to eBay, which was three times the size, it was even less so. But, as you grow larger, you need more structure and coordination and meetings. My theory is that you sort of subdivide, and you make smaller units and you give them a lot of power and responsibility. You let them make it or break it. But I have no practical knowledge as to whether this works or not. Livingston: Was there anything that was misunderstood about what you were\n\ntrying to do? Levchin: No, because I think we didn’t know what we were doing. I think the\n\nhallmark of a really good entrepreneur is that you’re not really going to build one specific company. The goal—at least the way I think about entrepreneurship—is you realize one day that you can’t really work for anyone else. You have to start your own thing. It almost doesn’t matter what that thing is. We had six different business plan changes, and then the last one was PayPal. If that one didn’t work out, if we still had the money and the people, obviously we would not have given up. We would have iterated on the business model and done something else. I don’t think there was ever any clarity as to who we were until we knew it was working. By then, we’d figured out our PR pitch and told everyone what we do and who we are. But between the founding and the actual PayPal, it was just this tug-of-war where it was like, “We’re trying this, this week.” Every week you go to investors and say, “We’re doing this, exactly this. We’re really focused. We’re going to be huge.” The next week you’re like, “That was a lie.” One of the interesting moments was after we got funding from Nokia Ventures, the first VC firm that funded us. The beaming at Buck’s was still done under this, “We’re doing this handheld device thing and there’s some payment component, but it’s really handheld device, share your lunch bill with your Palm Pilot.” By the time we had our first board meeting a month later, we had already realized that that wasn’t going to work and that we had to do the web stuff much more prominently—and we had all these other ideas that we wanted to do, which we later on threw out. But we started the board meeting basically saying, “Hi, John. Hi, Pete”—the new VC guys—“We changed our business plan.” And these guys were like, “What?” They just put down $4 million to see something happen, and we said, “Sorry, we’re not going to do that; we’re going to do this.” To their credit, they were like, “All right, you guys are smart. Let’s do it.” Usually VCs get freaked out by that, but these guys were like, “OK. You’re so crazy. Let’s go.” e99a99326bbe9685d843e54a55733bb2\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 17\n\nC H\n\nA\n\nP\n\nT\n\n2\n\nE\n\nR\n\nSabeer Bhatia Cofounder, Hotmail When coworkers Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith began working on their first startup idea—a web-based personal database they called JavaSoft—they were frustrated because their employer’s firewall prevented them from accessing their personal email accounts. To solve their problem, they came up with the idea of email accounts that could be accessed anonymously through a web browser. This idea became the startup. In 1996, the first web-based email was born, offering people free email accounts that could be accessed from any computer with an Internet connection. Less than 2 years later, they had grown Hotmail’s user base faster than any media company in history. On New Year’s Eve, 1997, Microsoft acquired Hotmail for $400 million. Livingston: Take me back to how the idea got started and evolved into Hotmail.\n\nHow did you know Jack? Bhatia: I met Jack Smith when I joined Apple Computer. We were working on the same project building PowerBook portables. Our manager left the company to join a startup in the Valley called FirePower Systems. Jack and I knew Apple would have given us steady, stable employment, but it wasn’t with grand stock options. So we decided to leave Apple and join this startup. We worked very hard, cranking out products: chips that were used to design PCs that ran on the PowerPC processor. These would run multiple operating systems, and at that time the idea was that if the insides of the computer were better and faster, then people would switch because it ran multiple operating systems, including either the UNIX or Windows architecture. If the processor was better, obviously that would eliminate the need to get Intel-based processors, because the architecture of RISC-based systems was better. But what happened over time is that Intel itself caught up on the price/performance curve. After 2 years the company really wasn’t doing very much. Our manager who hired the two of us left and went on his own. So I was kind of looking around to see what I should do with my life—whether I should go to business school or 17\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n18\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 18\n\nFounders at Work\n\nlook at other things. The Internet was just unfolding, so I started spending more and more time on it, and it was interesting. It was exciting to see these little companies get started. Two of my colleagues from Stanford had gone on to start Yahoo, and I thought, “Wow. This is just a list, a directory which tells you what is where. And somebody put $1 million in them.” I mean, that was huge. So I thought, “This Internet thing is here to stay,” and I started playing around with it and came up with the idea to do a simple-to-install database at the back end. Then you’d use the browser as the front end. It could store any piece of information at the back, but the browser would be used to display it. So people could just look for it and be able to create a personal database of anything: contact information, phone numbers, special files, or whatever it is that you would do on a local PC. So I wrote a business plan and didn’t know what to do with it. I was the only guy, so how do you build a company? I knew Jack and knew that he was a great software and hardware engineer. So I shared this idea with him. He read the business plan and said the next day, “This is great, where do I sign?” So we started and I said, “The next thing we need to do is go raise some money and try to figure out how to hire more people and take this to the next level.” Livingston: Had you quit your jobs? Bhatia: No, we were actually both working, so we decided to spend all of the time on the weekends and evenings building this product. Then it came to a point that one of us had to quit our job to focus full-time on it, so I told Jack, “I’m single and don’t have a family. Why don’t you quit and start working on this and I’ll give you half of my salary?” So at least he could support his family. I didn’t need that much money. We started building the product and then started looking around for funding. We went to a number of VCs and many of them turned us down because they were like, “How are you going to make money if you are going to give it away for free? What’s the revenue mechanism?” We said we would capture detailed demographic information about people and that detailed quality of information on individuals would help us advertise to them. But of course advertising was not a proven revenue model at that time. Livingston: How did the JavaSoft idea morph into Hotmail? Bhatia: While we were putting the business plan for JavaSoft together and\n\nwere working at FirePower Systems, they installed a firewall around our corporate intranet that prevented us from dialing out to our personal email accounts. I had an account at Stanford and Jack had one at AOL, so we would dial out and email each other. But we couldn’t do that anymore because the firewall prevented us from accessing our personal accounts. So we ended up exchanging information on floppy disks and on physical pieces of paper. That’s when it occurred to us, “Wait a minute, we can access any website in the world through a web browser. If we made email available through the web browser, that would solve our problem.”\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 19\n\nSabeer Bhatia 19\n\nAnd then it occurred to us, “If that would solve our problem, it would solve the problems of many others.” We didn’t know how many others, but email was something that everyone used. To provide ubiquitous access to that email from any web browser from anywhere in the world was the killer idea. Livingston: This killer idea emerged because you guys were trying to solve the\n\npersonal email exchange problem for yourselves? Bhatia: Absolutely. That we could access our email from only two places: our\n\nhomes and our work. And while we were at work, we could not access our personal email accounts. Livingston: Once you were onto the concept of web-based email, did you immediately discard the JavaSoft database idea and go full throttle with Hotmail? Bhatia: We were kind of torn. Our plan was to use the JavaSoft idea to get money from venture capitalists. But actually the killer arrow in our quiver was always email because we thought that it was even bigger than the original idea. Livingston: But you didn’t want to tell people about the killer idea because you\n\nwere afraid they’d copy you? Bhatia: That they would copy us, or what if they just shared this idea with\n\nNetscape? Or shared it with anyone else. You have to realize that in those days we had nothing—just the idea. When we were approaching venture capitalists, they would shoot us down for one reason or another—for reasons we thought were frivolous like, “You guys, what is your background?” So we would tell them that our background was in hardware engineering. “Why are you building software?” Many of them also said, “But you’re too young. Do you have any management experience?” “No,” we said, “we’re two young kids; we have a great idea.” The whole VC community has so many links with each other—you never know. Netscape was building email servers. What if the VCs were just to say to them, “Hey, why don’t you do web-based email?” And that’s it, that’s the idea, right? There was not that much to protect in terms of IP. Whoever built it first would win the market. So we were afraid and that’s why we kept that as the secret. But we were going to do web-based email no matter what, even if we got funding for the other idea. Livingston: I read that you judged the VCs by their reaction to the JavaSoft idea. Did you plan this clever approach? Bhatia: We actually planned to do this. You can’t get an audience with any ven-\n\nture capitalist without sharing a business plan, but we didn’t want our business plan floating around somewhere with the email idea. So we would go in with the JavaSoft business plan. If they passed the litmus test of not rejecting us for the wrong reasons and said, “OK, we don’t mind that you’re young, we don’t mind that you don’t have\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n20\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 20\n\nFounders at Work\n\nmanagement experience,” only when they would start poking holes in the actual idea would we share the Hotmail idea with them. That was actually just because we didn’t trust them. Livingston: You finally pitched Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) and they passed\n\nthe test. Tell me about getting funding. Bhatia: They liked the idea right off the bat. They said, “We’re going to get one\n\nof our partners to come in and take a look at this because it could be big.” So Tim Draper came in the following week and he liked the idea. After another meeting he said, “OK, we’re ready to fund you. We like this very much. How much do you want?” I did some calculations on the back of an envelope and asked for $3 million, which was our plan based on hiring a few engineers. They said, “No, that’s too much. How much money do you need just to prove to us that you can do this—that it’s even possible to make email available on the web?” So I asked for half a million and he said, “I’ll give you $300,000.” I said, “Alright, I’ll take it.” They wanted 30 percent of the company, which would value us at $1 million. It was an intense negotiation; I threatened to go to the other VCs if they didn’t pony up the money. We finally settled on a 15 percent split with them and they valued the company at $2 million post money. But they’d put in a right of first refusal. Since I was a young entrepreneur at the time, I didn’t understand that this basically meant that you couldn’t go to any other VC. So even though they didn’t get their chunk in the first piece, in any subsequent round they would have the ability to take up the entire round. Livingston: Your lawyer didn’t point out that clause? Bhatia: We didn’t have a very good lawyer back then. Of course it was touted to\n\nus as “We love you so much that we want to have the right to buy the next round. You can go to other people too.” But that’s the one that got us. It impeded our ability to go to another VC. What ended up happening was that we could not get a higher valuation because DFJ wanted to put more money in the company themselves. So any time we would talk to another VC, they would talk him out of it: “This is not a good company, don’t worry about it.” So we were really stuck with DFJ for the next round. Livingston: They put you down to other VCs? Bhatia: They did. Of course, that was very early on and now everything is all\n\nfine and dandy, but at that point in time . . . we had a term sheet for a much higher valuation. But when we would talk to any other VC, the other VC would call the guys at DFJ and they’d say, “No, don’t invest in them.” Livingston: Were they helpful at all? Bhatia: Yes. Steve Jurvetson was very helpful; he introduced us to a lot of peo-\n\nple and, on the whole, they’re a good VC firm in the sense that they try to put deals together. But sometimes they don’t play by the rules.\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 21\n\nSabeer Bhatia 21\n\nNobody knows this, but the round before the deal with Microsoft, they literally put $5 million in the company just because they knew it was going to get sold and that we needed some bridge money. This came at a very expensive valuation with certain rights that should not have come with it—like participating preferred, which is they first get their money out and then they participate in the rest, which was OK for the earlier rounds, but not for the later ones. That was just bridge money that we needed while we were negotiating with Microsoft. They knew full well that we were going to get acquired; we were negotiating about the final price. Livingston: I’ll come back to the Microsoft negotiation in a moment. Did your background in hardware help you in terms of building servers that could handle massive loads? Bhatia: It helped us because we knew what kind of hardware we would need to\n\nbe able to handle the kind of traffic to our site. Also, when you are hardware designers, you have tremendously more discipline in writing and describing software because in hardware you cannot get it wrong. Every turn of every chip costs you millions of dollars, so when hardware designers design any piece of software, they normally get it right. They use something called state machines to describe the functioning of the software. When you do that, you are very deterministic: if this is the input, then this will be the output. So you write it in a very deterministic fashion and therefore you tend not to make too many mistakes. Whereas the pure software writers—the way they think and architect software is very creative. They put in lots of bells and whistles, but they think, “No big deal. If there is a bug, we’ll fix it. Put in a patch.” You can’t do that in hardware. There’s no patch. Once you ship a chip, it has to work all the time. So in terms of being able to test it out, there is somewhat of a difference, but I just think that hardware designers would be pretty good software designers as well. Livingston: Were you at all worried about intellectual property issues when you\n\nleft the company to start Hotmail? Bhatia: No, they were totally different. We were designing chips, which had\n\nnothing to do with the Internet. Livingston: So you now have $300,000 and you’re working full-time on\n\nHotmail. What happened in the 6 months before you launched? Bhatia: We got funded on February 14, 1996, and the site launched on the Fourth of July. We had 100,000 subscribers in the first 3 months and we were growing very rapidly from then on. We were literally getting 1,000, 2,000, 5,000 sign-ups every day. Livingston: How? Bhatia: It all spread by word of mouth. We launched a massive PR campaign with a PR firm and started talking to different journalists. We did a West Coast and East Coast press tour, and it just took off from there.\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n22\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 22\n\nFounders at Work\n\nLivingston: You had a tagline in the body of the email encouraging email recip-\n\nients to set up their own free Hotmail accounts. How did you come up with this? Bhatia: It was actually Jack’s idea to do that. We ran it by our VCs just to make\n\nsure it was OK. When you alter somebody’s email, you’ve got to be very careful. You’re sending an email to a friend of yours, and we are kind of violating the sanctity of that email by putting in a tagline at the end of it that says “This message has been sent from Hotmail. Get your free email at hotmail.com.” So we asked Tim if it was OK that we did this. We said, “We don’t want to be perceived as the evil company by altering their email.” And he said, “Absolutely, you should do it.” And the next thing we know, he claims that this idea was his. He’s given a number of interviews literally claiming that he was the father of web-based email—without him it would not have happened. I can’t believe he’s just taken credit for everything—including the tagline (which later became known as the classic example of viral marketing). He blatantly claims this at conferences, which I don’t think is right. Livingston: He claimed that web-based email was his idea? Bhatia: That it was our idea, but without them, it would not have happened and\n\nthat we would have done JavaSoft. Their version is that “we told them to do web-based email at that [first] meeting.” Why would they tell us to do webbased email? Livingston: You grew Hotmail’s user base faster than any other company in his-\n\ntory at that time. Do you believe it was more because you had a great product or you had a good PR campaign? Bhatia: That’s one thing about the Internet: if you have something that’s good,\n\nit spreads by word of mouth and like wildfire. You just have to hire a small PR firm and do it. Livingston: Had you always planned for Hotmail to be free for users? Bhatia: Yes. Livingston: How did you convince people you could make money from tar-\n\ngeted advertising? That was so novel at the time. Bhatia: It was novel, but at the same time it wasn’t novel, because Yahoo had\n\ngotten funding (and later went public) on that basis. Their whole concept was to grow by advertising, even though it was a directory, because people would pay for advertising. Our whole idea was that, if page impressions are a commodity that can be sold, can be monetized, then we would generate far greater page impression than they were able to because you interact a lot more when you do email. You click on something and a page comes up and you click on something and another page comes up. So we were thinking of the number of pages and the number of page impressions as the monetizable quantity. In our estimate, we\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 23\n\nSabeer Bhatia 23\n\nbelieved we would overtake Yahoo in the number of page impressions that we would deliver, which was what Yahoo was touting. What has happened in the last 10 years is that advertising has grown even more. It’s not just page impressions, but the number of click-throughs. The most monetizable part of advertising (at least online advertising today) is the click-through to another advertiser, which is search. When people search, they’re most likely to click through because that’s when they’re looking for something. Google has proven remarkably well that click-through is a monetizable quantity more than page impressions. You can have 100 page impressions and that has some value, but the click-through has far greater value because that’s how advertisers measure, “Is this advertising working for us or not?” Livingston: Did you have a hard time signing up advertisers at first? Bhatia: It takes a long time before you can break through to an advertiser and\n\nget them to start paying you. In fact, the first 3 or 4 months we were doing advertising for our advertisers for free. We had them give us their banners, just to show that this was a mechanism for people to get their product in front of millions and millions of consumers. People would ask, “So, how are you going to make money?” And the whole thing about making money was all those pesky ads. Ads were perceived to be kind of a negative. And that’s the reason why, when there used to be 25 search engines, only 2 or 3 have survived. The others have died because they made their front pages look like Las Vegas casinos as opposed to preserving that simple, clean interface that Google has. I think the strategy that Google took was far better. They earned the trust of the end consumer. Livingston: Did Hotmail ever become profitable from advertising? Bhatia: No, we didn’t become profitable. But we weren’t losing that much\n\nmoney. We found that we were not the best at selling ads, so we outsourced the whole thing to another company and said, “You guys go sell the ads for us. We’ll just focus on delivering these ads to you no matter how much you sell them for. Just give us a percentage of revenue with a minimum commitment and we won’t go to anybody else.” That minimum commitment they gave us, which was about $1 million per month, was alone sufficient for us to break even. Our costs were so low; we were spending about $1 million a month. So though we were not wildly profitable, we were not losing that much money. Livingston: Getting back to the first 6 months before you launched, tell me\n\nabout the major turning points. Bhatia: Before we launched, I think the first major turning point was getting\n\nthe $300,000 in funding. That was huge for us—two young kids to get that much money. The second turning point really was when I started using it and I told my friends and family about it and everybody who used the product (50 or 100 or so people) loved it.\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n24\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 24\n\nFounders at Work\n\nAnd then of course, the interesting thing was that when we finally did launch, each of us had pagers that would send us a page every hour, so we would know how quickly our user base was growing. It was just phenomenal— 100 people signed up last hour, 200 people this hour. Everyone knew how many users were signing on and that was very motivating to the whole company. Livingston: Was there ever a time when you thought you were in trouble? Bhatia: The only time was when we had to go in for the second round of financ-\n\ning. We didn’t have any money and Tim was at the Olympics in Atlanta and he refused to fund us because we wanted a slightly higher valuation. This was what all the other VCs were telling us, but he wanted to invest at a lower valuation. We had only a couple of weeks worth of money left and I would not have been able to meet the next payroll. So as soon as he came back, we literally had to accept his terms and move on. Livingston: Couldn’t you have argued legally that by not agreeing to a higher\n\nvaluation that they had “refused” you? Bhatia: At that point you are stuck; you’ve got to make a decision one way or\n\nthe other and move on. Livingston: So really the biggest challenge in the early years of Hotmail was the\n\nfunding? Bhatia: Yeah, it was the funding. And of course then the tough part was in scal-\n\ning up to that growth. Our servers would break down and we had to worry about scalability problems and how to add servers and make it more reliable. It was not all smooth sailing. Livingston: Did you ever go out of service? Bhatia: We went out of service for a few hours sometimes and we didn’t have proper backups, or the ability to restore things. Reliability was an issue and it took us some time to cross the reliability curve. Livingston: Was there ever a time when you felt you couldn’t keep up? Bhatia: We just handled the problems as they came around: we put in a new\n\nsystem, rearchitected some of the things. The engineers worked really hard, and we kind of made it work. But even now there are times when you log into Hotmail and it says, “Sorry, the server is down.” These are just issues when you have a very large user base. Livingston: Web-based email was so new to the world. What did consumers\n\nmisunderstand? Bhatia: We had a sales guy who signed up his mom, and his mom said, “Yes, I\n\ncan see that there’s an email from you, but how do I read it?” And he said, “Mom, go and click on it.” She didn’t know you had to click on it! I heard another story from a man who said his sister would get into the Hotmail account not directly by going to http://hotmail.com, but by going to Yahoo, typing in the word “hotmail,” and then it would bring up the Hotmail page and then she’d log in. And he’d say, “Why do you do it that way?” and the\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 25\n\nSabeer Bhatia 25\n\nsister would say, “My friend taught me this is how you get to Hotmail, so that’s what I’ve been doing.” The usage patterns of how people used the Internet were baffling to us. Livingston: Who were you most nervous about from a competitive standpoint? Bhatia: Anybody in the Internet space. We were most nervous about companies like Netscape, because Netscape was building email servers and they would provide web-based access to the servers. Their whole point was that they provided web-based management to servers that you could set up. So, as system administrators, you could check to see how many had people signed up or whatever, but they were not offering web-based mail to people. The good news was that a lot of people said, “I’m not sure email is a browser-based product. Email is best done on an email client like Outlook Express. It doesn’t belong in the browser.” That’s what Jerry Yang said at Yahoo. We were like, “Great!” So we had no competition from them for the first 8 months or so, till we reached a certain point and then they had no choice but to buy a company. I heard that Yahoo gave up the opportunity to buy Google for $1,000,000— that at one point, Google would have been happy to be sold to them for a million bucks. Livingston: Yahoo ultimately wound up buying Rocketmail. They were your\n\nfirst real competitor, right? Tell me about them. Bhatia: They were our partners. We needed to have a directory of users that\n\npeople could search and send email to. Instead of building our own directory, we partnered with Rocketmail. We said, “OK, we’ll use your directory on our website and we’ll send you our registration data so you could register these people’s email accounts.” We didn’t want to build a directory just for people to search for email. All they had was a directory, that’s what they specialized in, that was their business. They found out how many registrations we were sending them daily—they saw our growth from hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands, and that’s when they said, “Even we ourselves cannot get these kinds of registrations on our website. We should do email.” So they decided to do email and that’s how they came up with Rocketmail. Livingston: Were you pissed? Bhatia: They are also funded by Draper Fisher Jurvetson. So Draper was see-\n\ning two of its own companies create two different email systems. We felt bad that they had done it, but we couldn’t go to Draper and say anything. It was a decision that the company took, that’s what DFJ told us, and we were pissed at them, but at that time we knew we had to not share too much information with DFJ as well. Livingston: So you didn’t have a showdown with Rocketmail? Bhatia: We just scrapped our partnership and decided, “OK, competition is\n\ncompetition.”\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n26\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 26\n\nFounders at Work\n\nLivingston: Then you started to get into talks with Microsoft? Bhatia: Talks with Microsoft started after our first anniversary, which was July\n\n1997. In August or so, Microsoft contacted us and said, “Wow, this is really big. Do you really have 7 million subscribers?” They knew that we were growing and they wanted to find out how we provided email to 7 million subscribers because they were having a hard time providing email to just 2.5 million MSN customers. So we began talking of a partnership deal and that’s how we started talking to each other. We worked out a detailed business plan about how we would provide email to their subscribers, and then they said they wanted a tighter relationship between us and their company—that they wanted to invest in our company. So they looked at our business plan and saw very quickly that we wanted to be more than just an email company. We wanted to incorporate all of the other functions as well, such as personalized news and those kinds of things. We wanted to be a portal at that point in time. So that’s when they came to us—they wanted to be a portal as well—and they said, “We cannot have one of our providers of email be a competitor of ours, so have you thought of an acquisition?” And I said, “I really haven’t thought of an acquisition, but at the right price I can think of anything.” Livingston: Tell me about the negotiation process. Bhatia: They called us to meet with Bill on October 13, 1997, and we were\n\nshown the Microsoft campus, headquarters, the whole works. We were taken to Bill’s office, met with him, and then we were taken to a room with a gigantic table, and there were about 15 Microsoft negotiators sitting on the other side: business development people, lawyers, accountants, all of them. They gave a presentation about how much they liked the company and this and that, and they said they wanted to buy us and placed an offer of $160 million. I knew that that was the opening shot and I said, “Thank you very much for making an offer. We really, really like your company and like the fact that you like us so much. We’ll go back to our board and discuss this and get back to you.” And the CFO said, “C’mon, is that in the right ballpark?” He wanted me to open my mouth, but I was told beforehand that if I opened my mouth, there was no way I could negotiate with so many people. It was just the three of us: Jack Smith, myself, and our VP of marketing. Livingston: The VCs gave you the liberty to negotiate, right? That surprises\n\nme. Bhatia: Luckily it was very early on; had we been burning through a lot of cash,\n\nhad we been around for a while, they probably would have put pressure on us. But we were under no pressure at that point in time. Livingston: What drove you to keep on negotiating until you got the $400\n\nmillion?\n\n7141CH02.qxd\n\n11/28/06\n\n2:21 PM\n\nPage 27\n\nSabeer Bhatia 27\n\nBhatia: Once you’ve got a lead in terms of a subscriber base, that is unassail-\n\nable. It can’t be replicated easily. So I knew even if they started developing the product—I have no doubt in my mind that they could have developed it, so many engineers and smart people in Microsoft. At that time they had something like 16,000 engineers, and I had a total of 60 people in the company, only 14 engineers, so it would have been easy to pick 15 guys from 16,000 and build this product. But I knew we had that momentum behind us and that is very hard to replicate. Livingston: You arrived in this country with only $250 in your pocket. Wasn’t it\n\ntempting for you to agree to sell for, say, $300 million? Bhatia: Once you have tasted this kind of success, once you’ve tasted that it\n\nworks, that you’ve got subscribers who are telling you it’s good, you know you are going to get there. In fact, that’s exactly what’s happened. That 6-month lead that we had already over any of our competitors today has translated into about a 50 to 100 million–user lead. Seeing how they did a lousy job of providing email to their 2.5 million subscribers, I also knew that they didn’t have the technology in house. Because if they did, they wouldn’t have been asking to license this from us. If we had gone the licensing route, I think we would have been as big as Google. Because that’s what Google did, right? Initially, they said, “We’ve got search. Why don’t we license search to everyone else?” That was their original business model. They licensed it to Yahoo, Microsoft, and AOL and grew big based on their subscribers. Livingston: Do you wish you had gone the licensing route? Bhatia: No, it would have been a lot more difficult, because the cost of provid-\n\ning email was much higher than the cost of providing search—even though search is far more profitable than email in terms of the advertising monetizability of search. Because when somebody searches, they are looking to find something; they are in the mood to click. Email is more of a destination. When you are doing email, you don’t want to be disturbed by what’s on the right, you want to read whatever your friend has written to you. So it’s the end product. It not a click-through kind of a product. So I don’t know where we would have ended up had we done that. Livingston: Looking back on your experience with Hotmail, what surprised you\n\nmost? Bhatia: I think I knew that Hotmail was going to become successful one day. I\n\nwas just shocked that all of that happened in a span of 20 months from st"
