His opponent, Israel Prize-winning educator Miriam Peretz, received 26 votes. Three legislators abstained. Herzog's was the largest victory in any presidential election in the country’s history. He will enter office on July 9, when the term of incumbent President Reuven Rivlin ends.\n\nThanking the parliamentarians who voted for him, Herzog said it would be an honor to serve all the people of Israel. Addressing his opponent, the mother of two soldiers killed in action, Herzog called her a hero and an inspiration."
