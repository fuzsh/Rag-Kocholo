        "text": "JERUSALEM -- On the morning Ezer Weizman was elected the seventh president of the state of Israel, the cocky former fighter pilot prepared as he had for so many other missions in the past.\n\n'There are so many things I'm forbidden to do in this job,' he said. 'I want to see what sort of things I'm allowed to do.'\n\nThroughout his career, Weizman, 68, who was elected Wednesday by a 66-53 margin in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, has been challenging accepted norms. In his new role, Weizman's brash style is expected to redefine the largely ceremonial post that was held first by his uncle, Chaim Weizmann, more than 40 years ago.\n\nFrom his unconventional military strategy as Air Force commander in 1967, when Israel demolished the combined air capabilities of the opposing Arab armies, to his conversion from a hawk to a dove seeking direct negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, Weizman is a maverick.\n\nHe has always prided himself for his independence and bluntness and once descibed himself as 'unbridled with a big mouth.'\n\nIn 1977, Weizman helped lead the right-wing Likud Party to victory, but was expelled from the party in 1980 for opposing government policies.\n\nThe government, he claimed, was 'marking time' instead of 'taking determined steps towards a comprehensive and stable peace.' He termed Prime Minister Menachem Begin 'a hawk,' while he himself was a 'hawk for peace.'\n\nThe former Air Force commander believes Israel should be ready to 'take peace by storm' and not 'inch-by-inch.'\n\nWeizman developed a very close personal relationship with Egypt's President Anwar Sadat during negotiations over the Camp David accords. Sadat often refered to Weizman, who was defense minister, as 'my friend Ezer.'\n\nWeizman formed his own political party, Yahad, in 1984 and considered Israel's key problem to be a 'crisis in leadership.' He offered himself as a solution.\n\nHe called on Israel to recognize 'the inevitability of peace' and realize that Israel will have to reorient its outlook towards the Arab world.\n\n'The founders of Zionism always conceived of a Jewish homeland in Israel, not in outer space,' he said. 'We have to stop being oriented to Europe and the U.S. We have to live among the Arabs.'\n\nA peace settlement involving the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he asserted, 'lies somewhere between a non-Palestinian state and non- annexation by Israel.'\n\nWeizman, who advocated negotiation and territorial compromise with Palestinians who renounced terrorism, also stood for a strong defense posture.\n\nIn March 1978, Weizman as defense minister ordered 10,000 Israeli troops into southern Lebanon in response to a PLO raid in which 32 Israelis were killed. During the one month incursion guerrilla strongpoints were smashed and a 4- to 6-mile-wide buffer zone was established.\n\nAfter the raid he quipped, 'I'm afraid that people who recommend (turning) the other other cheek were never slapped.'\n\nWeizman remained defense minister until his resignation in 1980. He was eventually replaced by the pugnacious Ariel Sharon, who coaxed the government into permitting him to carry out a raid similar to Weizman's following an assassination attempt on Israel's ambassador to London.\n\nSharon's invasion turned out to bear little resemblance to Weizman's and more than 600 Israelis were killed during three years of fighting.\n\nWeizman refused to forgive the party he once led -- the Likud -- for causing the Lebanon war. Following the 1984 elections in which his party, Yahad, won three seats, he joined the Labor alignment, ending the Likud's chances of forming a coalition government.\n\n'I cannot and will not be a partner to those who were responsible for the deaths of 600 soldiers in Lebanon,' he explained.\n\nEzer Weizman was born in Tel Aviv in 1924, the son of a prominent manufacturer and the nephew of Israel's first president.\n\nDuring World War II, the flamboyant Weizman joined the Royal Air Force and later dropped the last 'n' from his name in an assertion of his independence.\n\nIn 1958, at the age of 34, he became the commander of Israel's Air Force. During his seven-year tenure he advocated the doctrine of 'forward defense,' which included the use of pre-emptive strikes.\n\nWeizman, who celebrated the end of his command by buzzing all of Israel's air bases with his personal plane, a black World War II Spitfire with a red propeller, was considered to be reckless by many senior officials.\n\nHis brother-in-law, Moshe Dayan, once said that Weizman could never become chief-of-staff because he was 'too rash, naughty and always shooting from the hip.'\n\nWeizman, however, served as defense minister from 1977 until 1980.\n\nHe is married and had two children. His son, Shaul, a former paratrooper, was wounded in the head by an Egyptian sniper during a skirmish along the Suez Canal in 1970 and later died in a 1991 car accident."
