        "text": "Dr. Chaim Weizmann, 73-year-old Jewish leader who was elected President of the Provisional Government of Israel, made his first state visit this week to the President of the U.S. Blair House, official guest house for visiting foreign dignitaries, hung out the blue and white flag of the world’s newest nation. For Zionists it was another moment for rejoicing.\n\nBut from one Jewish group came a reminder and a word of warning. The small, anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, headed by Lessing J. Rosenwald, art collector and philanthropist, pointed out: “The State of Israel is not the state or homeland of ‘the Jewish People.’ To Americans of Jewish faith it is a foreign state. Our single and exclusive national identity is to the United States. American citizens have no right to participate in the political life of the State of Israel except through the proper agencies and procedures of the [U.S.] Government.”\n\nIn other words, American Jews are in the same position as Irish-Americans, German-Americans, etc. The country of their allegiance is the U.S.—and no other."
