        "text": "mounted with a black and white photograph of president Weizmann entering Jerusalem for the first time.\n\nStock Code 100807\n\nLetter: 6th January 1950. Photo: 17th February 1949.\n\nOriginal price $3,631.00 - Original price $3,631.00\n\nOriginal price $0.00\n\n$3,631.00\n\n$3,631.00 - $3,631.00\n\nCurrent price $3,631.00\n\n| /\n\nFebruary 17th 1949 was the day of Weizmann's presidential inauguration. On that day Dr Chaim Weizmann became the first president of the Jewish state.\n\nOn this photo Dr Chaim Weizmann is cutting a ribbon with golden scissors during the ceremonies that marked his first visit to Jerusalem as president, with his wife, Vera, to his right and Mayor of Jerusalem Daniel Auster to his left, holding the scissors' box.\n\nThe photo mounted together with a letter sent by Weizmann to Moshe Sharett, the Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time. The letter refers to the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 303, adopted on the 9th of December 1949. The resolution was in support of placing Jerusalem under an international regime, conferring it a special status due to its shared religious importance. Israel refused to accept the resolution. Subsequently Israel's Prime Minister David Ben Gurion responded by proclaiming Jerusalem to be the capital of the State of Israel.\n\nPresident Weizmann's letter of January 6th 1950 reads as follows:\n\n'My dear Sir,\n\nI do hope that the distortion of the United Nations General Assembly concerning Jerusalem will be amended, because it is impossible that the Assembly will not see its mistake. However, we must be careful not to misstep.\n\nJerusalem shall be ours if we will respect the other religions, and if we ensure their rights.\n\nWith respect and regards,\n\nDr C. Weizmann\n\nPresident of Israel.'\n\nTyped letter signed by Dr C. Weizmann; 1 leaf, 4to. Text in Hebrew and English, mounted with a black and white photograph signed and dated by Weizmann in green ink in the upper left corner.\n\nProvenance\n\nDelivery\n\nWe offer secure and express delivery on all local and international orders of rare books, maps and prints placed through this website.\n\nAbout us\n\nShapero Rare Books is an internationally renowned dealer in antiquarian & rare books and works on paper.\n\nOur Bookshop and Gallery can be found in the heart of Mayfair at 106 New Bond Street, where most of our stock is available to view and on public display.\n\nWe exhibit at major international art fairs, including TEFAF (Maastricht and New York), Frieze Masters, Art Miami and Masterpiece London, as well as antiquarian & rare book fairs including New York, Paris, London, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Hong Kong.\n\nRead more\n\nAsk us a question\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nStock Code\n\nMessage\n\nSign up for our emails to be the first to see exciting news and exclusive offers.\n\nI have read and accept the \"Privacy Policy\"\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\nStock Code\n\nMessage\n\nSign up for our emails to be the first to see exciting news and exclusive offers.\n\nI have read and accept the \"Privacy Policy\"\n\nLetter from the President of Israel to Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett,\n\n[WEIZMANN, Chaim].\n\nStock code: 100807\n\n$3,631.00"
