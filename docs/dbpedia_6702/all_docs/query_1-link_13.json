        "text": "Chaim Weizmann was a prominent leader within the Zionist Movement during World War I. He played a pivotal role in persuading the British government to issue the Balfour Declaration and held the position of President of the World Zionist Organization for several years. In the turbulent times leading up to statehood, Weizmann was the only Jewish leader that US President Truman agreed to meet. Although he did not reside in Palestine and was not part of the Yishuv's leadership, his standing as the elder statesman of the Zionist Movement was undisputed. Aside from David Ben Gurion, no one had contributed more to the establishment of the state.\n\nGiven his extraordinary contributions, it was fitting to offer Weizmann the largely ceremonial position of President of the State. At the first meeting of the provisional government on May 16, the proposal to offer Weizmann the Presidency was unanimously voted in. His formal nomination took place when the first Knesset convened on January 14, 1949. Weizmann was elected as the first President on February 16 and officially inaugurated on February 17, 1949."
