He will take over from Danny Ben Abu, who retired from the position after 13 years.\n\nParalympic swimmer Inbal Pezaro was also elected representative of the athletes on the Israel Paralympic Committee board. She said: \"I take this job very seriously and I want to think about how it can be used to make an impact.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old won silver and bronze medals at the Athens 2004 Paralympic Games in the 100m breaststroke SB4 and 200m freestyle S5, respectively. She then took three silver medals at Beijing 2008, three bronze medals at London 2012, and a bronze medal at Rio 2016 in the 200m individual medley SM5."
