        "text": "The Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952) was president of the\n\nWorld Zionist Organization and first president of the state of Israel.\n\nChaim Weizmann, son of Oizer and Rachel Weizmann, was born on Nov. 2,\n\n1874, in Motele, Russia. After receiving a religious education, Chaim\n\nwas admitted to the gymnasium of Pinsk, where he continued his Hebraic\n\nstudies. At the age of 18, he received his baccalaureate. He majored\n\nin chemistry at the universities of Darmstadt and Berlin, and he\n\nreceived his doctor of science degree from the University of Freiburg\n\nin 1900. From 1900 to 1904 Weizmann was a lecturer in chemistry at the\n\nUniversity of Geneva and from 1904 to 1916 a lecturer in biochemistry\n\nat the University of Manchester.\n\nWhile in Switzerland, Weizmann joined the active Zionist leadership.\n\nHe participated in all Zionist congresses after 1898 and was a\n\ndelegate after 1901. He urged a synthesis of settlement, cultural\n\nwork, and political propaganda to secure international recognition of\n\nZionist goals in Palestine. He opposed the British proposal for Jewish\n\nsettlement in Uganda. As an exponent of cultural Zionism, Weizmann\n\nsuggested the creation of a Hebrew University in Palestine. The\n\nuniversity opened in Jerusalem in 1925. In appreciation of his efforts\n\nin building the university, he was elected its honorary president.\n\nDuring World War I, Weizmann, because of his connections with British\n\nauthorities, emerged as the leader of the Zionist movement.\n\nAs a result of his efforts, the British government issued on Nov. 2,\n\n1917, the Balfour Declaration, in which it declared its support of the\n\nestablishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. As the head of a\n\nJewish delegation, Weizmann appeared before the Paris Peace Conference\n\nin 1919 and submitted the Zionist claims to Palestine. These claims\n\nwere recognized by the League of Nations, and the British government\n\nwas appointed to further Jewish settlement and to assist the\n\ndevelopment of a Jewish national home there.\n\nIn 1921 Weizmann was elected president of the World Zionist\n\nOrganization, a post he held until 1931 and later from 1935 to 1946.\n\nWhen the Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1929, he\n\nserved simultaneously as its president. In this dual capacity, he\n\ncooperated with Great Britain except for a time in 1930, when he\n\nresigned from his Zionist post in protest against the new British\n\npolicy curtailing Jewish immigration to Palestine. After 1946, in\n\nspite of his unofficial position, Weizmann served with the Jewish\n\nAgency's delegation before the United Nations Special Committee for\n\nPalestine in October 1947. When Israel was proclaimed an independent\n\nstate, he was elected the president of its Provisional Council of\n\nState. After the elections to the Parliament, he was elected, on Feb.\n\n17, 1949, as Israel's first president, and he was reelected on Nov.\n\n19, 1951.\n\nIn addition to his political activity, Weizmann also engaged in\n\nscholarly scientific work. He founded the Sief Research Institute in\n\nRehovoth and served as its director from 1932 to 1952. This institute\n\nwas later enlarged and named the Weizmann Institute of Science."
