        "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu is facing one of the biggest crises of his long political life, amid uproar over his government's attempts to change the way the country's judicial system works.\n\nRe-elected for a record fifth time in November 2022, leading the most right-wing coalition in Israel's history, he promised to govern for all Israelis, regardless of political differences. But, instead, his planned reforms have met with mass protests on a scale barely seen since the creation of the state 75 years ago.\n\nThe Likud party leader's return to power followed a relatively brief spell in opposition after 12 straight years as prime minister, his dramatic comeback sealing a belief among his supporters that \"King Bibi\" is politically invincible.\n\nIsrael's longest-serving leader, Mr Netanyahu has held office six times - more than any other prime minister in the country's history.\n\nThe 73-year-old's unrivalled success owes much to the image he has cultivated as the person who can best keep Israel safe from hostile forces in the Middle East.\n\nHe has taken a tough line towards the Palestinians, putting security concerns at the top of any talk of peace, and long warned of existential danger to Israel from Iran.\n\nBut hanging over his political achievements is the cloud of an ongoing criminal trial for alleged bribery, fraud and breach of trust - charges he fiercely denies. And for a man described by the Times of Israel as \"ultra-divisive\", his opponents see him as a danger to Israeli democracy itself.\n\nMr Netanyahu stepped down as Likud leader and was succeeded by Ariel Sharon.\n\nAfter Mr Sharon was elected prime minister in 2001, Mr Netanyahu returned to government, first as foreign minister and then as finance minister. In 2005, he resigned in protest at the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip.\n\nHis chance came again in 2005, when Mr Sharon - just before a massive stroke that left him in a coma - split from Likud and set up a new centrist party, Kadima.\n\nMr Netanyahu won the Likud leadership again and was elected prime minister for the second time in March 2009.\n\nHe agreed to an unprecedented 10-month freeze on settlement construction in the West Bank, enabling peace talks with Palestinians, but negotiations collapsed in late 2010.\n\nAlthough in 2009 he had publicly announced his conditional acceptance of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, he later toughened his position. \"A Palestinian state will not be created, not like the one people are talking about. It won't happen,\" he told an Israeli radio station in 2019.\n\nPalestinian attacks and Israeli military action repeatedly brought Israel into confrontation in and around the Gaza Strip before and after Mr Netanyahu returned to office in 2009.\n\nThe fourth such conflict in just 12 years erupted in May 2021, putting a temporary halt to efforts by parties opposed to Mr Netanyahu to oust him following a series of inconclusive elections.\n\nMr Netanyahu is alleged to have accepted gifts from wealthy businessmen and dispensed favours to try to get more positive press coverage.\n\nHe denies wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a politically motivated \"witch hunt\" engineered by his opponents. He went on trial in May 2020, becoming the first serving prime minister to do so.\n\nThe spectacle did not, though, harm his electability.\n\n\"We have won a huge vote of confidence from the people of Israel,\" he told jubilant supporters in November.\n\nFor his political base, Mr Netanyahu's return marked the start of another, new dawn."
