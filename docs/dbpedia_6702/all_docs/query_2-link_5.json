        "text": "Famous Jewish scientist Albert Einstein is well known for his discoveries in theoretical physics. But did you know he also had the opportunity to enter the political world?\n\nFollowing the death of Israel’s first president, Chaim Weizmann, in 1952, the Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, offered the presidency to Einstein. Israeli presidents perform mostly ceremonial duties, so the role constitutes more of an honor than a position of power.\n\nNeither Einstein nor Ben-Gurion expressed much enthusiasm about the prospect of Einstein assuming the presidency. Einstein found the offer awkward, and Ben-Gurion joked to an assistant, “I’ve had to offer the post to him because it’s impossible not to. But if he accepts, we are in trouble.”\n\nThroughout his life, Einstein consistently demonstrated support for the state of Israel. “I made the cause of Zionism mine because through it I saw a means of correcting a flagrant wrong,” he wrote in a 1947 letter to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nYet when offered the presidency, Einstein tried to decline immediately, refusing an official meeting with representatives of the Israeli embassy. Israeli ambassador Abba Eban insisted on sending him a letter in the name of Ben-Gurion.\n\nEban’s offer emphasized the Israeli people’s admiration for Einstein and urged him to consider the intellectual and spiritual potential of the nation. “Israel is a small State in its physical dimensions, but can rise to the level of greatness,” Eban wrote. The letter assured Einstein that he would retain the freedom to engage in scientific research while president. It also stipulated that to accept the position, Einstein, who lived in Princeton, New Jersey, would have to move to Israel.\n\nEinstein’s reply was brief and cordial, sharing appreciation for the offer and highlighting his strong emotional connection to the Jewish people. He blamed his refusal on personal shortcomings, such as a dearth of relevant skills and his advancing age. “I lack both the natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people,” he wrote."
