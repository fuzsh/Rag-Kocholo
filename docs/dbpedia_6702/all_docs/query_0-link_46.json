        "text": "Then more cars arrived carrying other parliamentary members. They all entered the library of Doctor Jaim Weizmann's house. They stood solemnly in a semicircle waiting for the host to appear at any moment.\n\nWhen Chaim Weizmann arrived, after going down the stairs, he looked pale and his hands were shaking with emotion. A short time later his wife Vera appeared and stood next to him. Sprinzak, a little nervous and excited, said:\n\n“Jaim, son of Ozer and Rachel Weizmann; \"We come to invite you to the Knesset session so that you can swear allegiance before your voters, before your people and before your country.\"\n\nNot much time would have passed when Chaim and Vera left for Jerusalem accompanied by those present and by a solid burden of fifty years of arduous work in favor of Zionism.\n\nAlready in Jerusalem, in the Parliament, upon entering the premises where the ceremony would take place, a long blast of the Shofar (ram's horn for ritual and joy purposes) was heard and everyone present stood up while Weizmann and Sprinzak They headed to the central stage.\n\nUpon reaching the solemn moment, Sprinzak read the oath slowly - almost word for word - while Doctor Weizmann, raising his right hand, repeated:\n\n“I, Chaim Weizmann, swear allegiance to the people of Israel, to the nation. To its institutions and its laws.”\n\nBiography\n\nChaim Azriel Weizmann was born in the village of Motol, near Pinsk, in present-day Belarus, within the borders of the Russian Empire, on November 27, 1874, into a wealthy Jewish family. He studied chemistry at the University of Friborg (Switzerland), graduating in 1899. He received his doctorate at the University of Geneva (1901-1903) and in 1904 he began working as a researcher in the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Victoria University of Manchester (England). .\n\nIn 1910 he obtained British citizenship. Between 1916 and 1919, during the First World War, he served as director of the British Admiralty laboratories. He became famous because he managed to obtain acetone, a solvent whose deficiency threatened the production of cordite (explosive used by Navy cannons), through the fermentation of the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum, later known in his honor as the Weizmann organism. . Jaim Weizmann was the first to determine how to use bacterial fermentation in the production of various substances and is considered the father of industrial fermentation.\n\nConvinced that the outcome of the war would leave Palestine in British hands, he worked to obtain a commitment to support the establishment of a Jewish national home under the tutelage of the United Kingdom in what was then still an Ottoman province.\n\nThe British commitment came at the end of 1917 with the Balfour Declaration, a text that generated controversy in the Cabinet and that supported Zionist demands in a vague way, but enough for Weizmann to call it “magna carta of Jewish liberties.” . A legend relates the Balfour Declaration to the production of cordite: The admiralty would have offered him whatever prize he asked for, and Weizmann asked for a Jewish state.\n\nThe following year, in 1918, Weizmann moved to Palestine, recently conquered by British troops, as part of a Zionist commission in charge of meeting various Arab leaders, both Palestinian and from other places, to take the pulse of the situation and try reassure them regarding Zionist intentions. Since they assure the Palestinian notables that they only intend in principle to provide a place of welcome for Jews from the diaspora, referring the question of the political status of Palestine to a more or less uncertain future, the Palestinian notables say they are not opposed to the Jewish presence as long as it does not seek to impose itself on the Arab majority.\n\nEven more fruitful are Weizmann's contacts with the Hashemite prince Faisal, son of the Sherif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali and leader of the Arab Rebellion that has just entered Damascus victoriously. In the agreement that both signed on January 3, 1919, Faisal recognized the Zionists' right to develop the Balfour Declaration, including massive Jewish immigration (the main point of conflict with the Palestinian Arabs) without any reservation other than equality between different religious communities. In return, the Zionists must actively support the creation of the unified Arab State in the entire region (excluding Palestine) promised by the British in the famous Husayn-McMahon correspondence and which is beginning to be outlined from the Syrian capital. In reality, this understanding is a mirage: barely a month later, the Zionists manifest at the Paris conference their demand for Jewish control of a Palestine much larger than the one considered by Faisal, and the Arabs, for their part, hold a congress. patriotic event in Damascus in which they reject the creation of a Jewish State.\n\nThe British sponsors of the alliance between Zionists and Hashemites are also in the process of negotiating the division of the entire region with a France foreign to the former and opposed to the latter.\n\nLeader of the Zionist Movement over the years, Chaim Weizmann was the main figure of the so-called synthetic Zionism, located between left-wing Zionism, represented then by David Ben-Gurion, and revisionist Zionism, led by Zeev Jabotinsky. Weizmann's policy was characterized by his closeness to Great Britain and by the absolute preeminence of meticulous diplomatic action. He managed to mobilize important support and capital in favor of the cause of the Jewish State and was one of the main designers of the Zionist strategy. His figure lost weight when the explosive situation in Palestine made the United Kingdom reconsider its support for the Jewish State until practically abandoning the idea.\n\nMany Zionists saw in this the failure of the methods of Weizmann, who was displaced in the effective leadership of Zionism by Ben-Gurion. Zionism, and especially the Ishuv, adopted a policy of pressure and confrontation with the United Kingdom.\n\nWeizmann, in any case, preserved his prestige and carried out important diplomatic work in order to obtain the support of American President Truman for the Zionist project.\n\nOnce the State of Israel was established, Weizmann was appointed president of the Provisional State Council. In February 1949, a month after the first general election, he was elected the first president of the new state in a special session of the Knesset. The role reserved for him in his new position was rather ceremonial, despite which Weizmann continued to deploy his diplomacy. In April he visited the United States, where he raised a record $23 million in contributions for Israel.\n\nOn the other hand, his personal relationships with key figures in British political circles were of utmost importance for the recognition of Israel by Great Britain (de facto in January 1949 and de jure in April 1950).\n\nThe scientist\n\nDespite his intense political activity, Weizmann never abandoned his work as a scientist. During World War I, chemist Jaim Weizmann verified that acetone was produced by the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum. Weizmann was the first to determine how to use bacterial fermentation in the production of various substances and is considered the father of industrial fermentation.\n\nIn 1918 he was one of the founders of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an institution whose establishment had a dual academic and political character. In 1934 he founded in Rehovot (his place of residence in Palestine) a scientific institute that would later be known as the Weizmann Scientific Institute."
