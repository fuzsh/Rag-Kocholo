        "text": "Masud Pezeshkian was sworn in as Iran's new president in parliament on July 30 after he won a snap presidential election earlier this month and inherited an economy hammered by mismanagement and sanctions and a society that has shown it will take to the streets to demand basic freedoms.\n\n\"I as the president, in front of the Holy Koran and the people of Iran, swear to almighty God to be the guardian of the official religion and the Islamic republic system and the constitution of the country,\" Pezeshkian said in the ceremony broadcast live on state TV.\n\nOn July 28, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei formally endorsed Pezeshkian and instructed him to focus on cultivating relations with Iran's neighbors rather than Western states after the new president voiced openness to talking with the West.\n\nModerate reformist Pezeshkian, a 69-year-old former heart surgeon, defeated ultraconservative hard-liner Saeed Jalili in a July 5 runoff with nearly 54 percent of the vote. Jalili received just over 44 percent.\n\nThe snap election was called after the death of hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in a helicopter crash in May. The first round of voting on June 28 had voter participation of 39 percent -- a record-low turnout for a presidential election in the history of the Islamic republic.\n\nIran's theocracy, installed after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, has long maintained that it derives its legitimacy from strong popular support that translates into high voter turnout, but poor participation in recent elections and deadly antiestablishment protests have challenged the legitimacy of the current leadership.\n\nThe runoff vote on July 5 saw turnout rise to around 49 percent.\n\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by senior officials from countries including Armenia, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, and Brazil. European Union envoy Enrique Mora also attended.\n\nRegional allies backed by Iran were also in Tehran, such as Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah. Both groups have been designated as terrorists by the United States and European Union. Lebanon's Hizballah and Yemen's Huthi rebels also sent representatives.\n\nHaniyeh and Nakhalah, whose groups have been fighting Israel in the Gaza Strip since Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel, met with Khamenei and Pezeshkian. Since his election, Pezeshkian has reaffirmed support for the \"axis of resistance,\" Iran's loose network of militant groups and proxies, against Israel and the United States.\n\nKhamenei, in his endorsement decree, described Pezeshkian as a \"wise, honest, popular, and scholarly\" individual.\n\nThe United States has noted the result of the election but said that elections in Iran are neither free nor fair.\n\n\"As a result, a significant number of Iranians chose not to participate at all,\" a U.S. State Department spokesman said in comments to RFE/RL's Radio Farda on July 7.\n\n\"We have no expectation these elections will lead to fundamental change in Iran’s direction or more respect for the human rights of its citizens. As the candidates themselves have said, Iranian policy is set by the supreme leader.\n\n\"The election will not have a significant impact on [Washington's] approach to Iran either. Our concerns about Iran’s behavior are unchanged. At the same time, we remain committed to diplomacy when it advances American interests,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe United States in 2018 withdrew from a 2015 landmark nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers that eased international economic sanctions in exchange for limits to Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nWashington cited Tehran's violation of the spirit of the pact and support for extremists in the region -- charges Iran has denied -- and reimposed sanctions targeting Iran's economy and oil sector.\n\nIran has since scaled back its own commitments and expanded its nuclear program.\n\n\"We call on the Western countries to realize [the need] for building relations based on mutual respect and equality. We are ready to negotiate an easing of tensions with states that have not realized until now the place that Iran occupies [in the world],\" Pezeshkian said.\n\nHe also vowed to continue fighting against the sanctions imposed on Iran. \"I think that this is Iran’s unalienable right to have normal relations with the world and I will not bow down in the fight against tough sanctions,\" he said.\n\nWith reporting by AFP\n\nWhat do an Iranian aid worker, a labor activist, a political campaigner, and a protester have in common?\n\nAll four are women who have been charged in Iran with armed rebellion against the state -- which carries the death sentence -- in recent months.\n\nTwo of them -- aid worker Pakhshan Azizi and labor activist Sharifeh Mohammadi -- have already been sentenced to death. Political activist Varisheh Moradi and protester Nasim Gholami Simiyari are awaiting their sentences.\n\nBesides Simiyari, all the women have been accused of being members of opposition Kurdish groups outside Iran. Azizi and Moradi are both members of Iran's Kurdish minority, which has long been suppressed.\n\nThere has been a rise in the number of women sentenced to death and executed since unprecedented antiestablishment protests erupted in 2022 following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian-Kurdish woman.\n\nFear Of Execution\n\nMohammadi, the labor activist, was sentenced to death in July. She was accused of membership in an independent labor union and a banned Kurdish separatist group based in neighboring Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n\nHer family has said she was not affiliated with any political organization inside or outside the country.\n\nMohammadi's cousin, Vida Mohammadi, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that she was tortured in prison following her arrest in December and that she had spent several months in solitary confinement.\n\nMoradi, the Kurdish political activist, was arrested in August 2023.\n\nShe was accused of being a member of the Free Life Party of Kurdistan (PJAK), the Iranian offshoot of Turkey's Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and a U.S.-designated terrorist group.\n\nAzizi, the aid worker, was also arrested in August 2023 and accused of membership in PJAK, which she has denied. She was sentenced to death in July.\n\nShe spent time in Iraqi Kurdistan as well as in northeastern Syria, home to the Arab country's Kurdish minority, to help people displaced by the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State extremist group.\n\nIn a letter written from prison before her conviction, Azizi said working in refugee camps in Syria \"could have been one of the biggest moral contributions to a society that has been oppressed for years.\"\n\nShe also denied membership in opposition groups, adding, \"So whoever spends time [in Syria's Kurdish-majority region] is a member of PKK?\"\n\nSimiyari, the protester, was accused of taking part in the antiestablishment protests in 2022. She was arrested in May 2023. She has said she was tortured in prison and held in solitary confinement for prolonged periods.\n\n'Silencing Dissent'\n\nHuman rights groups have condemned what they have called trumped-up charges against the four women.\n\nIranian activists say the charge of armed rebellion against the state is often used by the authorities against political prisoners and dissidents.\n\n\"Faced with a women's movement in Iran that refuses to back down, Islamic Republic authorities are now trying to threaten these women with the gallows, in a desperate attempt to silence dissent,\" said Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI).\n\nRights groups have repeatedly accused Iran of using the death penalty to instill fear in society in the wake of the 2022 protests.\n\nSaeid Dehghan, a prominent Iranian human rights lawyer, said the four women have been charged with armed rebellion even though \"they did not possess any weapons, and no weapons have been seized or recorded in their case.\"\n\n\"The activities of these citizens were civil in nature and had no connection to a rebellion against the 'foundation of the Islamic republic,' let alone being armed to justify the charge of rebellion,\" he said.\n\nActivists fear the four women could be the next victims of Iran's surge in executions.\n\nAt least 345 people have been executed so far this year, according to the Norway-based Iran Human Rights group.\n\nCHRI said the fact that two of the women are Kurds reflected the \"Islamic republic's continued disproportionate use of the death penalty against the country's minorities.\"\n\nIran's Kurdistan region was the scene of some of the most violent crackdowns during the 2022 protests.\n\nIn recent years, Tehran has upped the ante in its efforts to go after exiled opposition Iranian-Kurdish groups that it considers to be terrorist organizations.\n\nReviving the Iran nuclear deal remains off the agenda for the Biden administration, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on August 26, as Tehran called for “new negotiations” to update the agreement before it can be revived.\n\nIran’s new foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, said last week that the agreement “cannot be revived in its current form” due to sunset clauses that have expired and insisted that new talks are needed to resuscitate the agreement.\n\nHowever, a State Department spokesperson told RFE/RL that the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the 2015 nuclear accord is formally known, “is not on the table right now.” The United States unilaterally exited the deal in 2018 under then-U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n“The United States will ensure one way or another that Iran will never have a nuclear weapon, and we are prepared to use all elements of national power to ensure that outcome,” the spokesperson said.\n\nStill, Washington views “diplomacy as the best way to achieve a sustainable, effective solution,” the spokesperson said.\n\nDuring a televised interview, Araqchi conceded that renegotiating the agreement would be challenging.\n\n“This document definitely needs to be reopened and parts of it needs to be changed. That is no easy task because once you reopen a document, putting it back together will be challenging,” he said in a live television interview.\n\nComplicating matters further are the November presidential election in the United States and ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nAraqchi said the Ukraine war had “deeply impacted how Europeans view security,” while the Gaza conflict has “completely upended the situation in the region.”\n\nThe minister, who was one of the architects of the deal between Iran and six major world powers, said the format of talks since 2021 to revive the agreement can no longer work.\n\n“New negotiations are needed,” Araqchi added.\n\nThe deal restricted Iran’s nuclear program and capped uranium enrichment at 3.67 percent. In return, the United States lifted sanctions that had suffocated Iran’s economy and energy sectors.\n\nBut Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that had been lifted under its terms. Iran retaliated by gradually scaling back its commitments and is currently enriching uranium at 60 percent.\n\nAraqchi, then a deputy foreign minister, led Iran’s negotiating team when Tehran and Washington started indirect talks in April 2021 to restore the agreement. Negotiations paused when hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi came to power in Iran and a new team of negotiators entered the fray.\n\nBut talks were suspended in September 2022 in the wake of nationwide protests that rocked Iran for months. Hundreds were killed in the unrest as the authorities cracked down on demonstrations.\n\nIran's new president, Masud Pezeshkian, who succeeded Raisi after he died in a helicopter crash earlier this year, has vowed to engage the West.\n\nBut the ultimate decision-maker in Iran is Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has praised efforts by conservatives to expand the country's nuclear program.\n\nIsrael has reportedly launched new strikes at Hizballah, which has been designated at terrorist organization by the United States, just inside Lebanon a day after a heavy exchange of missile and drone attacks between the two foes that Iran claimed showed a shift in the balance of power.\n\nState media reported on August 26 that Israel targeted the border village of Tair Harfa and an area near Sidon in Lebanon a day after Hizballah launched scores of rockets and drones against targets in northern and central Israel in the early hours of August 25. The attack came shortly after Israel carried out what it described as preemptive strikes targeting Hizballah’s rocket launchers.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties from Israel's strikes on August 26.\n\nIran said on August 26 that the exchange of fire, which marked one of the largest clashes to hit the Middle East since war broke out in the Gaza Strip last October, showed Israel has lost not only its ability to anticipate small-scale attacks but also its deterrent power.\n\n“Despite the full backing of its supporters, including the United States, Israel has lost its deterrent power and ability to predict the time and place of even a limited and calibrated attack,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani wrote on X, referring to the large-scale attack on Israel by Iran’s Lebanese ally Hizballah a day earlier.\n\n“The occupying regime has always sought territorial expansion, but now has to defend itself within the occupied territories,” Kanani added. “Fear has been embedded in the homes of the residents of the occupied lands.”\n\nIsraeli officials said the preemptive attack prevented the launch of “thousands” of rockets. Hizballah claimed to have launched more than 320 rockets and drones but Israel put the figure at around 150.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:50 0:00\n\nHizballah leader Hassan Nasrallah alleged that the group’s operation was calibrated to ensure it did not trigger a full-scale conflict.\n\nAddressing Nasrallah and Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's preemptive operation was \"another step toward changing the situation in the north and returning our residents safely to their homes.\"\n\nHizballah said its operation was “phase one” of its retaliation for the killing of Fuad Shukr, widely believe to be Hizballah’s second-most powerful person. Shukr was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut on July 30.\n\nHours after Shukr’s assassination, the political leader of the EU- and U.S.-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas was killed in Tehran. Iran vowed to avenge Ismail Haniyeh and accused Israel of killing him. Israel has neither denied nor claimed responsibility.\n\nIn his speech, Nasrallah said one reason why Hizballah took nearly a month to hit Israel was because it was discussing with Iran and other allies about whether to carry out a coordinated attack on Israel or attack separately.\n\nPressure has been growing on Iran to deliver on its promised attack against Israel to avenge Haniyeh.\n\nDuring a phone call on August 25 with Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araqchi insisted that a “measured and well-calculated” response will come.\n\n“We do not fear escalation, yet do not seek it -- unlike Israel,” Araqchi told his Italian counterpart.\n\nIsrael and its Iran-backed Lebanese foe Hizballah insist they do not seek a full-scale conflict, but they continue to take steps toward war.\n\nIt took the U.S.-designated terrorist group Hizballah nearly a month to deliver on its promised attack against Israel for the killing of its most senior commander, Fuad Shukr.\n\nBut Israel saw the attack coming, taking what the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described as preemptive strikes against Hizballah's rocket launchers on August 25, apparently reducing the scale of the Iran-backed group's offensive.\n\nRaz Zimmt, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said that while neither side wants an all-out war, each party is \"very determined to impose its own equation on the other.\"\n\nThey continue to take risks by attacking each other, but mistakes and miscalculations could spark the very conflict they want to avoid, Zimmt warned.\n\n\"This ongoing, so-called limited conflict between Israel and Hizballah is very difficult to manage,\" he added.\n\nThe IDF says around 100 fighter jets took part in its preemptive operation, while Hizballah claims it launched more than 300 rockets and drones against Israel. If the numbers are true, this marks the biggest exchange of fire between Israel and Hizballah since the 2006 war, which ended in a stalemate.\n\nWithout Israel's preemptive strikes, the scale of Hizballah's attack would have been devastating, Zimmt said. That would have prompted a \"severe\" Israeli response, he added.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:50 0:00\n\nDespite the heavy exchange of fire, the attacks do not -- at least on the surface -- seem to have affected negotiations to establish a cease-fire in Gaza and secure the release of Israeli hostages from Hamas, which is designated as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States.\n\nZimmt said while he is \"not optimistic\" about the prospects of a cease-fire, such a deal could help de-escalate tensions -- although, even that, he added, is only speculation.\n\nHizballah Going Solo?\n\nThe Middle East has been on edge for weeks, expecting not just an attack on Israel from Hizballah but also from Iran.\n\nIran vowed to retaliate against Israel after a bombing in uptown Tehran killed Hamas's political leader, Ismail Haniyeh. Israel has not commented on the attack.\n\nHaniyeh was killed hours after Shukr, widely seen as the second-most powerful person in Hizballah, was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut.\n\nMany assessed that an Iranian attack on Israel would come in concert with strikes from Hizballah.\n\nBut the Lebanese group, which is more an Iranian partner than a proxy, appears to have grown tired of waiting and struck out on its own.\n\n\"It is very important to note that Hizballah didn't wait for the Iranians,\" Zimmt said, arguing that one reason why Hizballah waited so long to launch its retaliatory strike was that it had hoped to attack Israel alongside Iran.\n\nHowever, the Lebanese group likely concluded that a direct Iranian strike was not coming, at least for now.\n\n\"This might have some impact -- perhaps not immediately -- on Hizballah's relationship with Iran,\" Zimmt said.\n\nAzerbaijan is laying the groundwork to boost its ambitions in the South Caucasus and is looking to China for help.\n\nIn just two months, Baku's ties with Beijing have quickly moved forward as the oil-rich country has inched closer politically and economically through a series of agreements that could boost China's presence in the region and open the door to newfound Chinese investment into Azerbaijan.\n\nThe series of recent moves began on July 3 when Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Astana and declared they had upgraded bilateral ties through a new strategic partnership that calls for them to work closer together economically, militarily, and politically.\n\nA few weeks later, Baku applied to upgrade its status within the SCO from dialogue partner to observer, setting the stage to potentially become a full member.\n\nAnd then on August 20, Azerbaijan announced it had applied to join the BRICS group of emerging economies led by China and Russia that also includes Brazil, India, and South Africa as founding members.\n\nTaken together, the collection of moves is part of China's growing momentum in the region as an investor and trade partner since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which has left governments and shipping companies looking for alternatives due to sanctions on Russia that have left its vast rail network -- previously the main route between China and Europe for overland trade -- less viable.\n\nFor Azerbaijan, which is at a crossroads for trade on the Caspian Sea, this has led to new energy for the so-called Middle Corridor, the alternative trade route that bypasses Russia by cutting through Central Asia and the South Caucasus to connect to the European Union, and seen new investment worth billions of dollars.\n\n\"The Middle Corridor is a key issue and Baku needs Beijing's support,” Zaur Shiriyev, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, told RFE/RL. \"The immediate concern is that the success of the Middle Corridor depends on a steady flow of goods from China to establish a strong China-Europe route in the long term.”\n\nA Series Of New Deals And Beyond\n\nAttracting more Chinese interest and investment in the Middle Corridor is a main priority for Azerbaijan and is at the center of the strategic partnership agreement signed in July.\n\nChina pledged in the document to help develop and use the trade route and Baku is hoping that it will lead to more Chinese investment in infrastructure, which would make the route more competitive and strengthen Azerbaijan's role as a central hub in the region.\n\nBut Baku's \"cooperation menu with Beijing is extensive,” says Shiriyev, with Azerbaijan eyeing further deals in green energy, advanced technology, and military purchases.\n\nThe Azerbaijani government has also expressed a desire for Chinese companies to set up a regional manufacturing hub for electric vehicles in the country and has been actively calling for more Chinese investment.\n\nBilateral trade between the two countries is also on the rise, although heavily slanted in Beijing's favor, with China overtaking Turkey as Azerbaijan's second-largest source of imports (behind Russia) with $3.1 billion worth of goods in 2023, a 40 percent rise from the previous year.\n\n\"Chinese companies are already participating in the diversification of Azerbaijan's economy, but we expect more,” Hikmet Hajiyev, Aliyev's foreign policy adviser, told the Chinese state broadcaster CGTN during a March interview in Beijing.\n\nIncreased trade and investment appear to be motivating the recent moves by Baku as the country looks to diversify away from the hydrocarbon wealth that has underpinned its economy for decades.\n\nAnother part of the strategic partnership agreement calls for China's support for Azerbaijan's full membership in the World Trade Organization and the application for BRICS membership could also open new markets. While there is no clear procedure for admitting new members or an application timeline for joining BRICS, it expanded in January to also include Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Egypt -- and has a long list of other countries who have expressed an interest in applying.\n\n\"Membership could offer Baku the opportunity to expand access to the large and rapidly growing markets of the BRICS countries, potentially creating new opportunities for bilateral trade agreements and investments in Azerbaijan's economy,” Shiriyev said.\n\nA New Balance Of Power\n\nThe appeal of closer ties with Beijing isn't limited to trade and investment, says Vadim Dubnov, a regional expert at RFE/RL's Echo of the Caucasus, who notes that China is also an increasingly important partner for Baku to lean on in the region's fast-changing geopolitical environment.\n\nA decreasing footprint from Western powers combined with Russia being weakened and distracted by its war in Ukraine has given Azerbaijan more room to maneuver in foreign affairs. This has led to Baku deepening ties with Turkey and Iran and inviting China in to play a larger role.\n\n\"Aliyev is trying to reposition himself and find a new balance with all the major players in the South Caucasus,” said Dubnov. \"Stronger ties with China allow Baku to not sit totally in any one camp.”\n\nBut the warming ties between Baku and Beijing are not a one-sided process.\n\nSince Azerbaijan's success in its 2020 war with Armenia, China's interest in the South Caucasus has grown and Beijing hopes that Baku's stronger regional standing will lead to more stability and opportunities for more Chinese investment and influence in the region, such as additional trade routes connecting Azerbaijan to Turkey through Armenia.\n\nAzerbaijan is also eyeing other opportunities to use its geographic position to its advantage.\n\nWhile the Middle Corridor makes up an East-West trade route that bypasses Russia, the shake up to global trade brought by the war in Ukraine has also created new interest in other alternatives, including those that look to cut out the West.\n\nAs the Middle Corridor has grown, Moscow has looked to drum up investment in the International North–South Transport Corridor that flows south from Russia to Azerbaijan and then aims to connect to Iran and India.\n\nChina, which has strong trade ties with Central Asia and the EU as well as Russia and Iran, has expressed support for both the Middle Corridor and the North-South route, which Azerbaijan is looking to capitalize on given its central position in both.\n\n\"If Baku previously was able to use its energy resources [as leverage] in its relations with the West, international trade corridors are also now tools with strategic importance in Azerbaijan's foreign policy,” Nurlan Aliyev, a lecturer at the University of Economics and Human Sciences in Warsaw, told RFE/RL.\n\nRFE/RL Armenian Service correspondent Lusine Musayelyan contributed reporting to this article.\n\nIran is striking out left and right in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. presidential election in November with the help of slick-looking websites, hackers, and phishing attacks.\n\nThe objective of the sophisticated campaign, U.S. intelligence and cyberthreat experts say, is to fuel distrust in the U.S. democratic system and to exploit and heighten social divisions.\n\nAs the November 5 election nears, Iranian hackers have been accused of targeting the e-mail accounts of both the Republican candidate, former President Donald Trump, and his Democratic rival, Kamala Harris.\n\nU.S. intelligence assessments and researchers say both political campaigns have been targeted by phishing attacks carried out by a group with suspected ties to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the elite branch of the armed forces.\n\nAnd experts say an Iranian network dubbed \"Storm-2035\" operates multiple inauthentic news sites on the web and social media that use AI-generated content to agitate conservative and liberal dissidence.\n\n\"Iran’s main goal in this space is to sow discord and chaos and to undermine the integrity of the United States' electoral system,\" said Simin Kargar, a senior nonresident fellow at the Washington-based Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab).\n\n\"If they can pull this off, even at a very small scale, it would be a testament to Iran’s long-held rhetoric that democracy is a 'flawed Western concept' and even the U.S., which has often accused Iran of rigged elections, is susceptible to election-related controversies,\" she added in written comments.\n\nAt least four \"Iran-run covert news sites masquerading as news outlets\" operated by Storm-2035 have been identified by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC) as \"actively engaging U.S. voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the U.S. presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\"\n\nIn an August 9 report, the MTAC singled out three of the sites by name-- Even Politics (evenpolitics.com), Nio Thinker (niothinker.com), and Savannah Time (savannahtime.com).\n\nWith Trump and Harris in a tight race 11 weeks before the vote, Even Politics was publishing content focused on the ongoing war in Gaza, alleged threats against democracy, and the influence of religious groups. Much of the content on the site appeared to be steered against Trump.\n\nNio Thinker, which emerged shortly after the beginning of the Gaza war in October, has since shifted its focus from that conflict to the U.S. election. Its content caters to \"liberal audiences\" with \"sarcastic, long-winded articles insulting Trump,\" according to the MTAC, including one calling him an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop.\"\n\nHot-Button Topics\n\nThe site also goes after Harris's alleged unwavering support for Israel, the vice-presidential nominees for both parties, and stokes the flames on hot-button topics like corporate influence and immigration.\n\nOne article presented as an op-ed lays out \"Why Harris's Stance On Palestine Cost Her My Vote.\" A story titled \"J.D. Vance And The Rise Of The Sperm Cups\" mocks Trump's running mate over his \"family values\" positioning, which it described as a \"one-way ticket back to the 1950s.\" And another written from \"an FBI agent's perspective\" alleged that Harris's running mate, Tim Walz, has a \"'longstanding connection' to China and its government.\"\n\nThe third site, Savannah Time, presents itself as originating from the city of Savannah in the key swing state of Georgia. That site, according to Darren Linvill, co-director of the Watt Family Innovation Center Media Forensics Hub, is clearly intended to appeal to the right, with stories bashing Harris and her supporters.\n\nHarris's economic policies are often in the crosshairs of Savannah Time, with one article describing them as \"fiscally reckless crayon economics that would make even a drunken sailor blush.\" Another accuses her of \"a dangerous flirtation with communist-style price controls.\"\n\nMost of the articles published by the three sites are written by \"staff,\" and the Open AI artificial intelligence research company said in an August 16 report that Storm-2035 relied heavily on ChatGPT to generate its content.\n\nExperts suggest that in many ways Iran's approach to influencing the U.S. electoral system mirrors that of Russia, which employed troll farms to flood social media with disinformation and divisive content during the 2016 presidential election, broadly favoring Trump over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"What we've seen from these websites suggests a sort of Russian-style [campaign], where they have set up websites that are targeting communities on both the left and the right,\" Linvill said.\n\n\"[They want] to potentially use those websites to target these communities to spread disinformation and perhaps make our politics more extreme than they would have been otherwise and facilitate the process of us fighting amongst ourselves,\" he added.\n\n'Remarkably Well Done'\n\nLinvill also said the Iranian websites in some ways surpass their Russian counterparts, and have improved over the years.\n\n\"They're really remarkably well done. They clearly use AI in really interesting ways to create their content, but they're really well put together,\" Linvill said.\n\nIranian efforts to influence the U.S. electoral process have been observed since as early as 2018, when inauthentic personas were used to impersonate candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and to pose as journalists, according to the cyberthreat intelligence specialists Mandiant.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the campaign increased in scope following the assassination of IRGC commander Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. air strike in Iraq in January 2020 under then-President Trump.\n\nTwo Iranian nationals, for example, were charged by the United States for their involvement in a cyberenabled campaign to influence U.S. voters in the 2020 election, which Trump lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nMandiant noted that Iranian actors sent threatening e-mails to voters in the United States during the 2020 campaign. Mandiant and other cyberexperts also said that Iran used media sites like Even Politics to attempt to influence the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAside from the use of media platforms, U.S. intelligence agencies and cyberthreat experts say that Iran is currently making use of hacking and phishing attacks in an attempt to disrupt the November presidential vote.\n\nThe Trump campaign on August 10 blamed the Iranian government for a hack of some of its internal communications, prompting a federal investigation.\n\nA joint assessment by three U.S. intelligence bodies released on August 19 confirmed \"increasingly aggressive Iranian activity during this election cycle,\" including the \"recently reported activities to compromise former President Trump’s campaign.\"\n\nThis came after the U.S. director of national intelligence in July suggested that Tehran's efforts to influence the election was \"probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States.\"\n\nConsidering the assassination of Soleimeni, the unilateral U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear accord with Iran, and the souring of relations under the Trump administration, many experts suggest that Tehran would not favor another Trump presidency. The Trump campaign, following the hacking it blamed on Iran, suggested that it was due to past hostilities with Tehran.\n\n'Hyper-Polarized Climate'\n\nKargar of DFRLab said in written comments that she had not \"seen enough evidence on favoring one candidate over another.\" But Kargar said that “given Trump’s first term policies vis-a-vis Iran, it would only make sense that Iran would want to avoid a second Trump term at any cost.\"\n\nBut Harris's campaign has also been targeted. The joint U.S. intelligence report this month also said that it was confident that \"the Iranians have through social engineering and other efforts sought access to individuals with direct access to the presidential campaigns of both political parties.\"\n\nAnd a Google threat analysis group on August 14 said that APT42 had used phishing campaigns in an attempt to compromise \"the personal [e-mail] accounts of individuals affiliated with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and former President Trump, including current and former government officials and individuals associated with the campaigns.\"\n\nTehran is going after both the Republican and the Democratic camps because \"Iran is looking for ways to sow discord and drive wedges between different communities of voters in a hyper-polarized climate,\" Kargar said.\n\nRussia, Kargar added, did the same in 2016.\n\nThe bigger question is whether Iran's campaign has had any impact in an election that is already divisive on its own.\n\nLittle is known about the hacking attacks confirmed by U.S. intelligence, although Trump wrote on social media that the hackers were \"only able to get publicly available information\" and U.S. media did not publish documents purportedly from within Trump's campaign that were sent anonymously.\n\nIn the case of the inauthentic websites operated by Iran's Storm-2035 campaign, Linvill said that \"nobody's talking about them.\"\n\n\"It seems likely that they had been set up for some future purpose to help some future narrative laundering campaign that hasn't been undertaken yet,\" Linvill said.\n\nSuch campaigns usually have a very specific goal in mind or a specific story that the actor wants to spread, Livill said, but \"we just can't say what that might be.\"\n\nLinvill said he expects that to be cleared up as the election gets closer.\n\nA new report says Iran is preparing to export Fath-360 and Ababil close-range ballistic missiles (CRBMs) to Russia and has started training Russian personnel to use the former.\n\nThere have been several reports since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 claiming Iran was gearing up to sell or had already supplied Russia with ballistic missiles. None of the reports was confirmed by U.S. or Ukrainian officials, and Iran continues to deny having armed or planning to arm Russia.\n\nAnalysts who spoke to RFE/RL were unsure about the latest report but added that if confirmed it would provide a boon for Russia's war efforts and have both benefits and pitfalls for Iran.\n\nRussia's use of North Korean ballistic missiles briefly allayed concerns Moscow would turn to Iran to restock its inventory.\n\n\"However, the extensive demands of the battlefield may have strained North Korea's supply capabilities,\" Nicole Grajewski, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told RFE/RL.\n\nShe said Moscow might be seeking Iranian ballistic missiles as a strategy to \"lessen its dependence on North Korea,\" which would allow Russia to play off Pyongyang and Tehran against each other, \"potentially maximizing its strategic benefits.\"\n\nA visit to Tehran on August 6 by Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu, who previously served as the country's defense minister, fueled suspicions that Moscow was seeking to acquire Iranian missiles.\n\nFrom Drones To Missiles\n\nSince the early months of the Ukraine war, Russia was suspected of using Iranian-made Shahed and Mohajer-6 drones, many of which have been found after being shot down in Ukrainian cities and battlefields. Iran initially denied arming Russia before relenting and admitting that it had supplied \"a limited number of drones\" to Moscow before the war.\n\nDespite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Tehran continues to deny that its drones are being used by Russia against Ukraine. That has not stopped the United States and EU from imposing sanctions on Iran for helping Moscow.\n\nGrajewski said Iranian drones \"had a comparative advantage over the Russian ones in terms of technology, manufacturing, and operational use.\" But with ballistic missiles, it \"is about quantity, not quality.\"\n\nAside from the reputational boost that would come from supplying ballistic missiles to Russia, Iran would also gain significant knowledge about how Fath-360 and Ababil perform in battle.\n\nIn addition, Grejewski said, the \"operational use and any Russian modifications would potentially help Iran with some areas where its missiles tend to be lacking.\"\n\nEarlier reports suggested Russia was eyeing Iran's Fateh-110 and Zolfaqar short-range ballistic missiles. But exporting those to Russia would put Iran in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) range and payload thresholds, said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.\n\nHowever, Fath-360 and Ababil are under the 300 km and 500 kg thresholds established by the MTCR.\n\n\"Nonetheless, that does not mean [CRBMs] should be ignored, as they help Russia conserve their own domestically produced long-range strike assets and are further signs of a deepening Russo-Iranian relationship,\" Taleblu argued.\n\nTaking Risks To Grow Partnership\n\nNot contravening the MTCR would still draw the ire of Western nations if Iran ends up supplying Russia with ballistic missiles.\n\nUN restrictions on Iran's imports and exports of missiles expired in October 2023, but the United States and the E3 (Britain, France, and Germany) as well as the wider EU extended ballistic-missile sanctions against Iran.\n\n\"The E3 was resolute in their warnings to Iran,\" Grajewski said. \"The supply of Iranian ballistic missiles to Russia would complicate any solution with the Iranian nuclear program.\"\n\nTalks on restoring the nuclear deal have stalled and the agreement is set to expire in October 2025, so Iran may be looking to bolster its relations with Russia in case the prospects for reviving the deal disappear.\n\nIran took part in Russia's annual army exhibition, which was held in Moscow on August 12-14, and showcased some of its latest military technology including the Mohajer-10 drone -- the updated version of the Mohajer-6 that Russia has used in Ukraine.\n\nBut Grajewski argued that more notable was the presence in Moscow of Brigadier General Ali Shadmani, a deputy commander of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters that is responsible for the operational command and control of Iran's armed forces.\n\nTaleblu said Iran had received a combination of things for arming Russia with drones, including cash and gold, and maintained that \"these vectors of cooperation are likely set to deepen.\"\n\n\"Iran is intent on moving up from the status of junior partner to Russia, which is one reason why the arms cooperation between the two over Ukraine is unlikely to be compartmentalized,\" he added.\n\nIran has kept the world on edge since it promised to strike Israel more than two weeks ago -- a move experts say could plunge the region into an all-out war.\n\nThe promised attack by Islamic republic is meant as retaliation for the July 31 killing in Tehran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the U.S.- and EU-designated Palestinian terrorist group Hamas.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said after the assassination that Iran was \"duty-bound\" to avenge its \"guest.\"\n\nAn Iranian attack has been \"imminent\" for the past two weeks, and this anticipation has led to frequent bouts of hysteria on social media predicting an attack by Iran and its allies -- including Lebanese militant group Hizballah -- within hours.\n\n\"I think they really enjoy that: watching Israel stuck in this waiting period, paying a heavy economic and psychological price,\" said Raz Zimmt, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been

negative impact on Israel, be it the stress to the home front, the military mobilization, and even the economic consequences, will not be limited to Israel, but also affect Iran and Lebanon,\" warned Michael Horowitz, head of intelligence at the Bahrain-based Le Beck International consultancy.\n\nWhy The Wait?\n\nAnalysts said the idea Iran is delaying its retaliation because it is relishing the psychological impact it is having is more of an excuse than a proper strategy.\n\nThey agreed intense domestic debates, the complexity of coordinating with proxies, and assessing the risks associated with an attack have all contributed to Iran's hesitation.\n\nZimmt said Iran is \"facing a major dilemma\" because while Khamenei and the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) want to restore Iran's deterrence vis-a-vis Israel, there are elements in Iran that worry a large-scale attack could drag Iran into a war with Israel and maybe even the United States.\n\nEven if a decision on how to respond to Haniyeh's killing has been made, coordinating with Hizballah and other members of the so-called axis of resistance -- Tehran's loosely knit network of regional state and nonstate allies and proxies -- is a time-consuming process.\n\nAnother factor likely affecting Iran's decision-making is the United States beefing up its military presence in the region more than it did in April ahead of Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attack against Israel.\n\n\"We're seeing a bigger response [from the United States] than in April, which is probably meant to match the scope of the threat, as Iran may carry out a larger response than the one in April,\" Horowitz said.\n\n\"The message [from the United States] in sending both defensive assets -- but also potentially offensive ones -- is one of deterrence and perhaps the only kind of message that does truly matter at this stage.\"\n\nCan Diplomacy Prevail?\n\nTehran has rebuffed calls by Western nations to show restraint, insisting it has a legitimate right to respond to Israel's killing of Haniyeh on Iranian territory.\n\nStill, the flurry of phone calls made to new President Masud Pezeshkian and acting Foreign Minister Ali Baqeri-Kani have raised speculation that attempts at diplomacy have helped delay an attack and could potentially stave it off.\n\n\"I am skeptical that diplomacy, on its own, is enough to truly change the Iranian calculus,\" Horowitz said. \"Iran will do what it feels is in its best interest, regardless of the calls and statements urging restraint.\"\n\nBut Iran has suggested a different kind of diplomacy could convince it to at least \"delay\" its promised attack: a permanent cease-fire in Gaza between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFarzan Sabet, senior research associate at the Geneva Graduate Institute, speculated Iran \"may be looking for off-ramps\" to justify a toned-down response, and some kind of Gaza cease-fire could be just the \"diplomatic victory\" it needs to do that.\n\nZimmt said a Gaza cease-fire may not be important to Iran but it does provide Tehran with \"an excuse or an explanation to legitimize this delay, both internally and mostly externally.\"\n\nHe said a cease-fire could lead to Iran either reducing the scale of its attack or choosing a different method of retaliation altogether that does not involve a direct strike on Israel.\n\nNo Good Options\n\nIt remains a mystery when and how Iran is going to respond, but as things stand Tehran does not seem to have any good options.\n\n\"Decision-makers in Tehran may have vacillated in finding a 'Goldilocks' option,\" Sabet said.\n\nThat, he explained, is Iran's conundrum to deliver \"a retaliatory strike that is not so weak as to have little symbolic or deterrent value, but not so strong as to cause an uncontrolled cycle of escalation that leads to a larger war.\"\n\nTehran is effectively left with either a weak response or one that crosses the threshold of war.\n\nBoth options \"entail significant risks,\" Horowitz said, \"either for Iran's regional projection power or the risks Iran could take if it crosses a line and is hit back in return.\""
