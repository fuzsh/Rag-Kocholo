        "text": "If Paris is the City of Light, Jerusalem is the City of Opinion. Here it rains opinions. The desert blooms on the moisture of harangue. The rarest phrase in the fifty-year-long history of Israel is “No comment,” and certainly no one has ever uttered the following sentence: “I have no comment on Bibi.”\n\nLeft or right, everyone refers to the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, by his childhood nickname, though familiarity in his case has not bred affection. The strangest thing about Netanyahu is that although he commands support—his stalling tactics on the peace process have won him a center-right majority—he commands little respect. One afternoon, I went to see David Bar-Illan, a former concert pianist, who is among Netanyahu’s closest aides and very few friends. On matters of policy, Bar-Illan is a spinmeister extraordinaire, the fellow who happily goes before the camera crews to defend the latest action of the Prime Minister. And yet when we were talking about Bibi’s attempts to win over the ultra-Orthodox vote despite his own ultra-secular habits, even his admission of adultery, Bar-Illan rolled his eyes and spoke on the record in a way no Washington equivalent ever would.\n\n“Finessing his being secular was nothing compared to other things, like adultery,” Bar-Illan said. “One thing is to have an affair with a shiksa—but a married woman! With a shiksa, even the rebbes do it. But a married woman! Now Bibi’ll go to synagogue on Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, maybe he’s gone to the Western Wall, or he’ll say the phrase ‘With God’s help.’ But he’s not fooling anyone.”\n\nThe rhetoric of Israeli democracy has always been noisier than the American brand, but talk about Netanyahu is unhinged. One of the first things I did on arriving in Jerusalem was to call Yitzhak Shamir, the previous Likud Prime Minister. Shamir picked up his phone on the first ring, as if he’d been waiting for the call all week. “Bibi?” Shamir said in his exhausted Old World accent. “He is not a very trustworthy man.”\n\nThere was a long pause at the other end of the line, as if Shamir felt he had said quite enough to cover the subject. In his view, after all, Bibi concedes too much to the Arabs and has diluted the Likud Party. “He’s too egotistical. I personally have no contact with him,” Shamir went on. “He’s a man who is not very popular. He’s a talented, successful man. He made it at a young age. He had many advantages. But people don’t like him. I wouldn’t say he is admired. I don’t believe he believes in anything. He has a huge ego. People don’t like such people. I don’t like him.”\n\nAnd so on. After Shamir had unburdened himself, I called Shimon Peres. Running on a platform of moving quickly on the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, Peres lost the 1996 election to Netanyahu, who captured the support not merely of the hard right but also of many Israelis who thought Yitzhak Rabin and Peres had gone too far, too fast. Peres also picked up on the first ring. He was leaving for China in five minutes, he said, but he managed to take ten to tear a hole in his successor. “We’ve lost so much, and for nothing,” Peres said wearily. “Netanyahu’s only consideration is his own coalition. He’s always worried about losing power—that is always his first priority. In the meantime, we’ve lost the trust we built up, we’ve lost the Arab world, we’ve lost the respect we won throughout the rest of the world. All this makes it appear that we are a bizarre nation. To achieve peace and not follow through is bizarre.”\n\nNetanyahu, who is forty-eight, is the first Israeli Prime Minister to have been born after the founding of the state. As a result, perhaps, many Israelis sense in him a distinct lack of gravitas. He often strikes people as a younger man trying to make an impression, and only suffering for it. When I went to interview Netanyahu, in his office, he began the session by lighting up a big cigar, a Davidoff. You knew it was a Davidoff because he left on the ring. Nor did he offer one to his guest: Bad manners? Low supplies? He then proceeded to fill the room with so much smoke that his young press aide, a friendly fellow from Dubuque named Michael Stoltz, reacted as if he’d been trapped in a garage with the car running. Stoltz could have died a slow death, I thought, and Netanyahu would not have stopped his pompous puffing.\n\nThe riddle of Netanyahu is that so many Israelis find him personally insufferable, and yet if there were an election tomorrow he would almost certainly defeat the Labor standard-bearer, his old military commander and role model, Ehud Barak. The Orthodox know all about Bibi’s secular indiscretions—the pandering, the philandering. The far-right nationalists cannot yet decide whether he wants to kill the Oslo peace process (as they would like) or not. Both the Russian émigrés and the Sephardim know that he is not one of them. Nevertheless, these outsider constituencies believe that Bibi is better for their interests than the Ashkenazic élites of the Labor Party.\n\nThe left, of course, cannot bear Netanyahu. In their view, Bibi has “killed the peace,” eradicated the historical chance symbolized by the 1993 and 1995 Oslo accords with the Palestinians. Bibi’s enemies see him as an incompetent, unimaginative, and cynical politician with a singular gift for staying in office. “Netanyahu knows very well what he wants,” Uri Savir, who had been Rabin’s chief negotiator in Oslo, told me, “and the main thing is to steer Israel in the direction of a mutual-deterrence policy, because he does not really believe in real peace. He does not believe in a new quality of relations. He also sees everything through the eyes of a political animal and he wants to be reëlected. Everything he does is to play to his right-wing constituency. To appeal to them, he uses the buzzwords that appeal to their ghetto mentality.”\n\nThere are still many on the left who blame Netanyahu for helping to whip up an atmosphere of hatred that led to the Rabin assassination. Nevertheless, Bar-Illan insists that one day soon all Israelis will end up marvelling at Netanyahu’s guile and ideological agility. “Bibi wants to out-Begin Begin,” Bar-Illan told me, meaning that he will do something even more shocking than Menachem Begin did when he signed the Camp David accords, in 1978, promising to give the Sinai back to Egypt and bringing about peace between Israel and its most powerful neighbor.\n\nIsrael is celebrating its fiftieth year as a state. It is amazing to realize that Zionism has outlasted the two great threats of the twentieth century—Fascism and Communism—and yet the celebration is halfhearted. No small part of this is the sense that the country’s leadership is thoroughly uninspired. Almost universally, left and right, Netanyahu is seen as a slippery pol—and not particularly adept at that. During the 1996 campaign, Bibi promised the Orthodox that he, the most secular of men, would be the avatar of the Jewish state. He went to see the spiritual leader of the Sephardim, Rabbi Yitzhak Kaduri, and whispered in the rabbi’s ear, “Leftists have forgotten what it is to be Jewish. They think they will put security in the hands of the Arabs—that Arabs will look out for us.” Israeli Radio’s microphone picked up these remarks.\n\nDuring his two years in office, Netanyahu has become known for a series of flubs and fast ones. After winning the Likud nomination largely through a new, open electoral process, he supported the repeal of that process. He courted scandal by nominating an attorney general whose main qualification was a tight connection to Shas, the Sephardic party. He defied his own intelligence chief and ordered the assassination of a Hamas leader, Khaled Meshal, in the Jordanian capital of Amman; when the plot to poison Meshal failed miserably (more Inspector Clouseau than 007) and became public, King Hussein was infuriated, and Israelis were bewildered. As Foreign Minister, David Levy said that he had a commitment from Netanyahu on social spending in Sephardic towns, and then resigned when Netanyahu reneged. The right wing remain furious about the redeployment of Israeli forces from the city of Hebron, in the West Bank.\n\nNetanyahu’s circle feels persecuted by the press. His defenders point out, for example, that he has not turned out to be militarily aggressive or ideologically unbending. Again and again, they mentioned “one of the few exceptions”—a long article by Ari Shavit published last December in the liberal daily Ha’aretz, headlined “the year of hating bibi.” Shavit is a liberal intellectual who wrote that his own circle has been unduly vicious about Netanyahu. When I began reporting this story, Netanyahu’s own father gruffly told me that I would invariably quote only his son’s enemies, “the left-wingers.” I invited him to give me a list of people I should call, and he did. Naturally, some on the list were ardent supporters, but others, while they said they supported Netanyahu’s policies, admitted that they could barely stand the man.\n\nOne such was Yoash Tsiddon-Chatto, a reserve Air Force colonel and former Knesset member on the right, who went with Bibi to the Madrid peace talks in 1991. “Something about Bibi’s personality creates an anti-rapprochement,” Tsiddon-Chatto said. “I didn’t ever think he would dodge and manipulate and weave and dodge the way he has as Prime Minister. I doubt if his father is so happy with the way his son has carried out his policies.”\n\nThe father. Everywhere I went in Jerusalem, when I asked about Netanyahu the same answer came back: “To understand Bibi, you have to understand the father.” But while the Israeli press regularly describes Benzion Netanyahu as deeply conservative in his views and harsh in character, he is nearly a legend, a kind of secret. Benzion does not exactly hide from the world—he is a controversial scholar who has published a cascade of extraordinary books and papers on the Jews of fifteenth-century Spain—but he studiously avoids journalists. Like Bibi, Benzion Netanyahu and his wife, Cela, both regard the Israeli press, which is almost uniformly pro-Labor, with unconcealed contempt. “Bolshevik” is the term they use. They are not a great deal fonder of the American press. The Times’ coverage of Israel, Benzion told me, “often seems to me unbalanced and slanted toward the leftist side of Israel’s public opinion.” I was able to spend time with Benzion mainly because we share a book editor, a friend.\n\nWhen the nation of Israel was founded, Benzion Netanyahu was on the fringe of its political life. Now he is its patriarch. His eldest son, Jonathan—Yoni—is a martyr of the Israeli Defense Forces, whose name is known to every Israeli schoolchild; the middle son, Benjamin, is the leader of the Likud Party and Prime Minister; and the youngest son, Iddo, is both a novelist and (someone had to be) a radiologist.\n\nBenzion, who is eighty-eight, is possessed of a clear mind, good health, and a forbidding personality. A cross word from him scatters the sparrows from the trees. After his son the Prime Minister makes a speech, Benzion sometimes calls to correct a grammatical mistake. “Bibi’s Hebrew has gotten far better in recent years,” he allows. Benzion is a secular man, and yet his judgments of Israel and history and much else are often so dark, so unforgiving, that he sometimes sounds like the harshest of Old Testament prophets. His views on everything from modern America to the ideological weaknesses and failings of various Israeli politicians, past and present, are often despairing.\n\nBenzion’s range of disapproval is breathtaking. Fifty years ago, at the time of Israel’s birth, his politics were already on the edge, the outer feathers, of the right wing. As a young man, he was an aide to Ze’ev Jabotinsky, the leader of the hard-line Revisionist movement. Among the early Zionists, the Revisionists were the underground fighters who argued that the Laborites, led by Ben-Gurion, were giving up too easily on territory that is now well beyond Israel. Benzion was part of a movement that saw Israel as laying claim to an area encompassing much of present-day Jordan. The pro-Jabotinsky hymn at the time went, “The Jordan has two banks: this one is ours, the other one, too.” His vision, perhaps, is an anachronism and yet it is the vision that the current Prime Minister of Israel was raised on. Benzion looms above his son no less than Joseph Kennedy loomed above his clan, and his views are at the root of Bibi’s sense of a menacing world.\n\nWhen you meet Benzion, he does not seem so forbidding: he has little white tufts of hair and weary, narrow eyes, the eyes of a Chinese scholar. On the day Bibi was sworn in as Prime Minister, at the Knesset, in 1996, Benzion sat in the audience. Ari Shavit, of Ha’aretz, remembers seeing the old man and noticing that he betrayed no outward signs of pride or joy. “I was watching it on TV, and thought, My God, to be the son of this man, even if you become Prime Minister you can never satisfy him. This is really the key,” Shavit said. “There is this person who pushes himself to the end, demanding the impossible, and even achieving it. It’s like a constant internal tyranny. You can never stop. There is no celebration.”\n\nTo say Benzion has no faith in a peace accord with the Palestinians or with any Arab nation is to state the obvious. Such treaties, to him, are the stuff of fools and naïfs. “Jewish history is in large measure a history of holocausts,” Benzion told me, “carried out by anti-Semitic leaders and factions that managed to take over whole countries or regions in times of anarchy, civil war, or rebellion. In the areas that fell under their control, all Jewish communities were wiped out. Hitler differed from them primarily in having become the sole, undisputed ruler of his country and in controlling a much larger area, which allowed him to murder many more Jews.”\n\nTo a considerable degree, Bibi Netanyahu’s internal struggle as Prime Minister is a struggle between an inherited ideology and the tug of political contingencies. His dilemma is always to what degree he can, or should, remain true to the ideals, the stubbornness, of his father. He may not always act on his father’s imperatives, but he believes strongly in his father’s rightness; both men share a keen sense of insular self-confidence, of being right when all others around them are innocent, bogus, mistaken. When I met with Bibi at his office, he fondly recalled to me how, in 1956, his father went to Ben-Gurion and told him that the Israelis, having just captured the Sinai, had to devise a strategy to keep it. Ben-Gurion had said that he would keep it for a thousand years. Why was Benzion worried about losing it?\n\n“Because the U.S. will force you to,” Benzion told him.\n\n“Of course, he was right, unfortunately,” Bibi said. “That was the first and last time an Israeli Prime Minister succumbed to an American diktat.” It is not hard to imagine this anecdote playing in the Prime Minister’s head when American diplomats like Dennis Ross and Madeleine Albright sit with him in negotiations.\n\nBoth the Israeli left and the White House would argue that Bibi has slowed down the peace process so much that the Palestinians and such Arab states as Jordan and Egypt have lost hope. In recent weeks, Clinton Administration officials have urged Netanyahu to agree to withdraw from a full thirteen per cent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian guarantees on terrorism. Netanyahu has balked at that figure, though he has indicated a willingness to pull back from nine per cent of the disputed territory (perhaps even eleven per cent). The point, he insisted late last week, at talks in Washington with Ross and Albright, was that any accord must preserve what he called a “territorial buffer” against Palestinian terrorism. Netanyahu, to be sure, continued to face intense pressure at home: Palestinians demonstrated against al nakba—“the catastrophe”—of the founding of Israel; riots broke out, and several Palestinians were killed by Israeli troops. And it is far from certain that Netanyahu’s right-wing Cabinet, especially the influential Infrastructure Minister, Ariel Sharon, would agree to a settlement resembling the American plan.\n\nNetanyahu’s over-all argument is that the left’s dream of a New Middle East, of peaceful relations and open markets in a region of Arab dictatorships, is fantasy. “The real Middle East is not this lovely palette of lovely colors,” he said. “There are some very dark streaks there. More than streaks—large swaths of fundamentalism and dictatorial regimes. There is a battle on for the soul of this Islamic Arab civilization. I don’t write them off. I think we can influence it, but first of all not in a major way and, in any case, in a way different from the way the left thinks. They think that if we make more concessions we’ll defuse the time bomb, the mechanism that keeps this going. But this is much bigger than the battle with Zionism. It’s a battle with modernity.”\n\nFor the extreme right wing, however, Bibi has not always been firm enough with the Arabs. The Prime Minister’s decision last year to cede authority over Hebron to the Palestinian Authority was, in their eyes, a betrayal of the 1996 campaign, and of Revisionist principles. Bibi’s brother-in-law, a settler named Chagi Ben-Artzi, told me, “Bibi grew up in a family in which the principle of keeping the land, the entire land, in Jewish hands was a holy principle. . . . I’ve heard Bibi’s father be very critical about the Hebron agreement. He said it is absolutely not justified. He didn’t see any good reason to give Arafat more land before he carried out one single commitment included in the Oslo accords.” Benzion denied that he had argued with his son about Hebron or Oslo in general; when Ben-Artzi made public his own opposition to his brother-in-law’s policy, their relations soured.\n\nReflecting on his son and Oslo, Benzion later said, “What I can gather from the deeds and the statements of the Prime Minister is that he is struggling to obtain, within the limits of the Oslo agreement, and through the implementation of the commitments on the part of both sides, arrangements that are vital for the security of Israel and will minimize the outbreaks of large-scale terrorism and wars.”\n\nBibi, for his part, dismisses all talk of paternal influence as “psychobabble.” His friends and colleagues who have known him for decades do not. Natan Sharansky, one of Netanyahu’s current ministers and closest advisers, told me, “Look, there’s no doubt that the father is crucial to Bibi, especially historically, in Jewish history and world history. In his day-to-day activities, it helps Bibi to somehow stay in focus. He gets caught up in the daily struggles, but he always has this view of history in mind.”\n\nWhat will Bibi do, then, in the coming months and years? Will he listen to the call of history and try to come to an agreement with the Palestinians? Or will he listen to the right-wing constituencies that will keep him in office? “I think Bibi is divided and sometimes paralyzed by the difference between his heart and his head,” said David Makovsky, who covers diplomacy for Ha’aretz. “His visceral reactions are ideological, like his father’s, but intellectually he’s come to see that his visceral reactions are not always correct. The result is paralysis. Motion without movement in the peace process.”\n\nBenzion and Cela Netanyahu reared their sons in a spacious house, on Haportzim Street, in the Old Katamon district of West Jerusalem. They still live there. There was little wealth in Jerusalem in those days, and the Netanyahus felt themselves quite nearly rich. Their car was American—a Henry J—and they had one of the few telephones in the neighborhood. Benzion edited the enormously popular Encyclopedia Hebraica. “And for that,” he told me, “I got the highest salary in Jerusalem!” The house is now worth around a million dollars.\n\nBenzion Netanyahu is known in scholarly circles around the world for his book “The Origins of the Inquisition in Fifteenth Century Spain.” In medieval studies, his thesis is considered revolutionary. The Jews were oppressed in Spain even after they had become converts to Christianity. Netanyahu challenged the traditional view that the Spaniards persecuted the conversos because many of them continued to practice their original faith in secret. Netanyahu’s work contends that the long-held notion of the conversos as “secret Jews” is a romantic delusion. He argues that in fact only a very few of the New Christians practiced Judaism, and that the Inquisition was actually a historical moment in which the Christian monarchs developed a theory of racial hatred designed to uproot and demolish a perceived threat to their social and political order. Netanyahu writes that after two massive waves of conversion, in 1391 and in 1412, these New Christians began to assume powerful positions in politics and the Church. Since the Spaniards could no longer attack the conversos on the basis of religious faith, they devised tracts describing the Jewish people as an inherently polluted, contaminated race. For the first time, Netanyahu writes, a society devised a racial theory of Jewish inferiority which laid the foundation for the Inquisition in Spain just as surely as the Nuremberg laws were the precursor to the Final Solution. After fourteen hundred pages, one is led to the darkest conclusion possible: that even if Jews go as far as to convert, and even if that conversion is thorough and official, it will not matter; the resentment of the Jews as a people will persist, even to the point of forced exile and mass murder.\n\nI called on the Netanyahus on a fine spring morning. Cela Netanyahu let me in and then quickly went off to get her husband. Cela studied law at Gray’s Inn, in London, but never practiced. Instead, she raised her three sons and, above all, was her husband’s wife. She guarded him against distraction and travelled with him in the United States when there were no academic posts available in Israel. In all, Benzion and Cela lived in America for more than twenty years—first from 1940 to 1948, to work for the Zionist movement, and then from 1963 to 1977, to teach at various colleges and work on his books.\n\nWhile I was waiting for Benzion, I walked over to the dining room. When the boys were growing up, the dining room was their father’s study, the nexus of the house. “When you went over there, you made sure not to disturb the old man,” one family friend said. “That was the inner sanctum.” Now a bust of Yoni dominates the room. Yoni was the only Israeli soldier killed during the commando raid on the airport in Entebbe, Uganda, in 1976.\n\nOver the years, the Netanyahus have cultivated a sense of uniqueness about their family. “Their perception of themselves is as a major family in the history of Israel,” one of Bibi’s friends said. “The father is the great scholar and wise man. The eldest son, Yoni, is the martyred soldier. The middle son is the Prime Minister and savior of Israel. The youngest, Iddo, is the writer, who also practices medicine. Bibi’s said that he thinks Iddo is ‘Israel’s new Hemingway.’ No matter that Israel has truly great writers—A. B. Yehoshua, Amos Oz, Aharon Appelfeld, Meir Shalev. That’s the way they think.”\n\nFinally, Benzion came in and sat down in an armchair. For a while he talked about his father, Nathan Mileikowsky, a rabbi who was born in Lithuania and helped run the famous Krinsky Gymnasium, in Warsaw. As a leading Zionist orator, Nathan toured Europe and America making speeches in support of a Jewish state. When he brought his family to Palestine, in 1920, they came ashore in a small boat in Tel Aviv and changed their name to Netanyahu—God-Given.\n\nTime and again in conversation, Benzion talked about the persistent spectre of the left in Israel. He said much of the press in Israel is worse than Pravda, because in the old Soviet Union at least readers understood that their press was frequently lying. This, in modified language, is a familiar theme in Bibi’s conversation.\n\nBenzion studied medieval history at Hebrew University. Later, he was co-editor of a literary monthly, Beitar, and then of the Revisionists’ daily newspaper Ha-Yarden. His contemporaries remember him as being extraordinarily intelligent and charming and, at the same time, arrogant and nearly seething with resentments and contempt. Even now, he radiates the same qualities, at once spinning a fascinating tale of old Jerusalem for his visitor and then talking with acid condescension (at best) about various constituencies and politicians in Israel. In his view, Arab fundamentalism and Asian nuclear power are the order of the future. He is a man of numerous and ferocious opinions, but is very wary of publicizing them—not least, perhaps, for fear of embarrassing his son.\n\nIt’s hard to replicate the old man in print. For one thing, he is both fierce and irresistibly alive; for another, he insisted that our talks were “friendly chats,” not a formal interview. But what comes through, so often, is a man who resents what he sees as the folly of others.\n\n“There was always a strong myth of persecution in that family, always a grievance,” I was told by Shalom Rosenfeld, a contemporary in the Revisionist movement who was later the editor of the leading newspaper Ma’ariv.\n\n“There is a feeling of rejection by the academic establishment, which was dominated by the left and denied Benzion a decent job, and, as a result, the Netanyahus were forced to emigrate, which was very painful,” Chagi Ben-Artzi, Bibi’s brother-in-law, said. “Part of the background of the determination of Bibi to change Israel, to make it a more democratic society, to push the process of privatization, stems from that old resentment, because the left used the economic structure of the country to dominate Israel ideologically—anyone who was not politically correct was denied economic chances. That resentment is still there. It’s not something for them that belongs to the past.”\n\nBen-Artzi’s facts are only partly correct. It’s true that Benzion did not get a job at Hebrew University, but the university was tiny in those days, and there were hardly any positions available to anyone. For work, and for superior libraries, Benzion accepted jobs at Dropsie College, in Philadelphia, and at Cornell, in Ithaca, New York.\n\nThe family’s sense of outsiderness has more to do with real politics than with academic politics. Some of Jabotinsky’s followers, including Begin and Shamir, took to the underground, carrying out military missions against the British and the Arabs. Netanyahu was among the ideologues, the campaigners. In early 1940, he went to the United States to help Jabotinsky lobby American politicians on behalf of the Zionist idea. Jabotinsky died later that year, but Benzion stayed on for eight years, as director of the New Zionist Organization, meeting with such influential figures as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dean Acheson, and key members of Congress. “When we came with Jabotinsky, people laughed at us at first,” Benzion said. “No Jew was dreaming of a Jewish state. ‘Who will create it?’ they said. ‘The English will create it? The Arabs are against it!’ Even Chaim Weizmann declared that it was impossible, that it was no more possible to create a Jewish state in Israel than it was in Manhattan.”\n\nWhen Benzion and his family returned to the new state in 1948, he took up the Encyclopedia and moved out of politics. Bibi’s eventual rivals for the Likud leadership—the Jerusalem mayor Ehud Olmert, the former Finance Minister Dan Meridor, and Ze’ev (Benny) Begin—all come from right-wing political legacies. They are known as Likud “princes.” Bibi was never grouped with the princes, because his father had made his life, finally, in academe. “I don’t think my father would ever have been in politics,” the Prime Minister told me. “He’s not temperamentally suited.”\n\nBut when I asked Bibi if he considered himself an outsider in Israel and in Israeli politics he did not deny it.\n\n“You’re damn right—outsider!” he said. “You don’t have to psychobabble it!” Netanyahu could hardly have grown up with more privilege, and yet he is a Prime Minister elected by a coalition of outsider groups. His votes came from the Sephardim, the Orthodox, the settlers, the Russians—all groups who see themselves as excluded from the liberal Ashkenazic establishment. Like Ronald Reagan, Netanyahu successfully governs as an outsider: even as he wields power, he keeps complaining to his constituencies about the lopsidedly liberal press, the fearsome lefties in academe, all the while implying that they are the establishment, and that they hate you. It is a familiar, and familial, theme.\n\n“I think the father is already within him—it’s built in,” one of Bibi’s friends told me. “The father always talked about They. They don’t understand a thing. They are naïve. They are fools. Always they, them.”\n\nIsraeli political debate is almost invariably, at root, a clash of historical narratives. No argument or incident is too ancient for consideration. The evidence for this rushes at you every day. One afternoon, while I was drinking a cup of coffee at a café in the Muslim quarter of the Old City and reading the papers, I came across a letter to the editor in the Jerusalem Post from David Wilder, a spokesman for the Jewish community in Hebron, who was responding to an article by a well-known figure in Palestinian politics, Daoud Kuttab:\n\nSir,—Daoud Kuttab viciously attacked the Jewish community of Hebron in his article “At the boiling point” (March 1). Herewith is our reply to several of Kuttab’s accusations: Kuttab refers to the “Ibrahimi mosque.” This building is known to Jews as the Machpela Cave, the second holiest site to the Jewish people throughout the world. This site has served as a mosque only since 1267. The building was originally constructed as a site for Jewish worship, built by Herod, king of Judea, 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe key phrase here, of course, is “only since 1267.”\n\nTo celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the state, Israeli television has been showing a twenty-two-part documentary on Sunday nights called “Tekuma,” or “Rebirth.” I happened to catch one of the most controversial installments—an overview of the early history of the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank and the rise of Palestinian nationalism and violence. To American eyes, it seemed fairly ordinary: interviews-plus-film-clips fare—the sort of thing you might see on A&E or the Discovery Channel. There was Golda Meir, in both English and Hebrew, denying the existence of the Palestinian people; there was the squalor of the refugee camps in Gaza; and there, too, were the terrorist attacks in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, the slaughter of Israeli athletes in Munich, a mother remembering how her two children were killed when a terrorist tossed a grenade into the back seat of her car.\n\nThe filmmaker, Ronit Weiss-Berkowitz, said that even before her segment was shown on the air she began receiving death threats. “They call my home,” she said, “and say, ‘We will burn you,’ ‘You fucking Arabs,’ ‘You stinking leftist, we know where you live.’ . . . I wanted to show, step by step, the creation of the ideology behind terrorism—which I reject, which I don’t identify with, but whose roots I understand. I wanted to show why and how a Palestinian starts thinking of terror as a solution. We Israelis think we have a monopoly on blood, tears, and pain, but, of course, this is not true. We know our side in this story. I wanted to present the other side—loudly.”\n\nFor the right wing, including the Prime Minister, the documentary series was an attempt by the leftist press to dominate the national narrative, to wallow in the guilt of “original sin”—the Jewish displacement and subjugation of Palestinian Arabs. Yoav Gelber, one of the show’s academic advisers, resigned and said that the segment belonged in a series marking “the fiftieth anniversary of the Palestinian Authority.”\n\nBibi despises the men and women who run Israeli television––to him they are part of the leftist claque that has always dominated all cultural and media institutions in Israel—and when I asked him about “Tekuma” he waved in disgust. “It’s a joke!” he said. “It’s a joke! It’s agitprop, it’s agitprop, the small segment that I’ve seen. It’s just not the facts. The presentation of the Palestinian side, what I’ve seen, is skewed beyond belief. It’s the facts that I’m dealing with. The facts can have diverse interpretations, but there cannot be diverse facts. That, I think, is important.”\n\nIn my talks with Benzion, he made it clear that he thought that the Jewish people might never recover from the murder of the European Jews; he also saw intermarriage and assimilation as posing great threats to the survival of the Jews. He feels that even present-day Israel, including the occupied territories, is but a fraction of what was originally promised; and to give up more land to the Arabs is extraordinarily dangerous, especially because a future Palestinian state could ally itself with such countries as Iraq and Iran—Israel’s sworn enemies. “There is no doubt that many of the Arabs want to see the State of Israel destroyed,” he said, “and they would end Jewish existence in the country if they had the chance to do it. Only the fear of retaliation keeps them back.”\n\nThat is Benzion in conversation and it is Bibi in his 1993 book, “A Place Among the Nations,” which gives the most embattled reading possible to the history of Zionism and the Israeli state. When I talked to Benzion, he protested the idea of familial unanimity, but he did say, “There was no generation gap at all. We didn’t agree on everything—this is not a family of robots—but our family has a coherence to it.” However, he added later, “I am not involved in any measure or degree in shaping or influencing the policies or activities of the present government of Israel.”\n\nIn “A Place Among the Nations,” Bibi’s most sustained historical metaphor for the Israeli security predicament is Czechoslovakia before the Second World War; for him, the West Bank is the Sudetenland, the limited territorial pretext used by Hitler to overrun the entire country. When I asked Netanyahu about the comparison, he allowed that it was imperfect, but still one cannot read that book without sensing the author’s parallel between the Germans and Arab aggression. The Czech metaphor is not one he indulges now as Prime Minister, but it has shaped his thinking since he was a young man.\n\nIf there was someone who really knew Bibi well, who shared with him the world of the family and a view of the world, it was his older brother, Yoni. In deciding what course to take with the Palestinians or with Syria, he has to cope with the legacy of his brother, a symbol of Israel’s conflicts with the Arab world.\n\nAlong with their parents, Iddo, Yoni, and Bibi moved to Elkins Park, a Philadelphia suburb, in 1963, and went to a local high school. Each of the sons, in turn, went back to Israel for his Army service while their parents stayed in the United States. Yoni was the first to go, and he stayed in close touch with his brother through hundreds of letters, like this one, which was mailed after Bibi had been in a punch-up:\n\nIn my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with a good fistfight; on the contrary, if you’re young and you’re not seriously hurt, it won’t do you real harm. Remember what I told you? He who delivers the first blow, wins.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War, in which Yoni had been wounded in the arm, he wrote a letter to Bibi that evoked both the spirit of their father’s toughness and a determination not to remain in America:\n\nThe recruitment of all these little terrorists only strengthens my consciousness as an Israeli. If they come to fight, we—or at least I in the Diaspora—must certainly do so all the more. My national consciousness is no doubt stronger than that of the Arabs, I’m a much better fighter than they are, and so are all Israeli soldiers.\n\nIn another letter to Bibi, Yoni wrote, “You’re the only true friend I ever had.”\n\nBecause the country is so small, Israeli soldiers often go home for weekends and vacations; each of the Netanyahu boys stayed with friends of the family while their parents remained in the States. “Yoni lived like a gypsy, and this was strange in Israel,” Yoni’s friend the scholar Avishai Margalit said to me. “To be a loner in Israel is unusual, and all three of them were to an extent like this.”\n\nBibi returned to Israel in 1967 and joined the élite reconnaissance unit Sayeret Matkal. In the unit, he was regarded as intelligent and diligent but not especially creative. He distinguished himself at a nighttime raid on the Beirut Airport in 1968 and in the rescue of hostages aboard a hijacked Sabena airliner in 1972. During the Sabena raid, Netanyahu was one of the commandos who went on board dressed as mechanics; he grabbed one of the hijackers, a woman, by the hair and slammed her into a bulkhead, demanding to know where to find the hostages.\n\nBibi returned to the United States in 1972 to study architecture and business administration at M.I.T. He raced home to his unit for the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but he made a life for himself in America, first as a student, then as a business executive in Boston. He gave right-wing lectures on Israel, lectures that rang very much of Benzion. In 1973, he shortened his name to Ben Nitay. Netanyahu always denied to the Israeli press that he had legally changed his name, and when Ma’ariv published the legal documents recording the name change, filed in a court in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, the Prime Minister’s spokesman, Shai Bazak, called the story “a malicious effort to contrive a sensational story.”\n\nThe years in the United States did nothing to push Bibi to the left. He was very much for the war in Vietnam and deeply depressed by the conciliatory turn Israel took under his father’s old comrade Begin. When Anwar Sadat came to Jerusalem, Avishai Margalit’s sister-in-law threw a party in Cambridge and invited Bibi.\n\n“When he arrived,” Margalit recalled, “he was totally grim-faced and said, ‘What’s the celebration? Now we’ll relinquish the Sinai and they’ll be on our border and there will be another war.’ He was coming for a funeral, not a party.”\n\nNo event shaped Netanyahu’s future more than the death of Yoni, at Entebbe. On July 4, 1976—the American bicentennial—Yoni Netanyahu led a team of commandos to Uganda, where Israelis had been taken hostage by Palestinian and German terrorists. As the commandos stormed the airport building where the hostages were under guard, Yoni was gunned down, either from the control tower or from within the building itself. Bibi was in Boston at the time, and as soon as he heard the news he drove to Ithaca to tell his parents. His mother, Cela, seeing Bibi, ran to the door and, before he could say a word, said, “He’s dead, isn’t he?”\n\nMany friends and acquaintances of the family told me that Yoni was the son who seemed destined for great things, perhaps first in the military, and later in politics. Had he lived, they say, Yoni might have been a chief of staff or a government minister.\n\nBibi was devastated. “If it wasn’t for Yoni’s death, I’m not sure Bibi would have gone into politics,” Netanyahu’s friend Uzi Beller told me. “He loved the States, especially the economy, the whole idea of a free market. He could easily have slipped into becoming an American businessman and made a lot of money.” Bibi could not eat solid food for weeks after the funeral.\n\n“The brother was the one person he really loved. This is crucial and underlies his loneliness,” said Ari Shavit, of Ha’aretz. “I think that on the other hand they were both in the same position. They were both committed to the father. The father was from turn-of-the-century ideology and politics, though, and they realized they had to swim in a contemporary environment. So on the one hand they had to be loyal to this unique father figure, on the other hand they had to go out into the world and function. Losing Yoni was worse than losing someone you love. Bibi lost the one person who could understand him.”\n\nAt the same time, Bibi saw Yoni not merely as a personal loss but as a national event, a figure in history. He was determined to make sure this was so. At the shiva, Bibi, his parents, and Iddo accepted the condolence calls of many Israelis. One of Yoni’s friends arrived at the house and saw Bibi talking to Chaim Bar-Lev, a former chief of staff, then a Minister of Industry.\n\nThe friend recalled, “As soon as Bibi saw me come through the door, he left Bar-Lev, came to me, and, hardly saying hello, said, ‘We’ve been at war for three hundred years with the Arabs and each generation needs a hero. Trompeldor fulfilled his role, and I’ll make Yoni the hero of his generation.’ ” Josef Trompeldor was in the Tsar’s Army and lost an arm in the war with the Japanese. After coming to Palestine, he was killed in a skirmish with Arabs in 1920 and became a hero, a legend of renewed Jewish heroism, especially for the right.\n\nBecause the Entebbe operation had been so spectacular, it was inevitable that Yoni’s name would become a symbol. But, as Bibi had promised at the shiva, the family helped promote this. Bibi and Iddo edited a collection of Yoni’s letters; more than sixty thousand copies have been sold in the Hebrew edition alone. Bibi also began a think tank called the Jonathan Institute, for the study of terrorism. To commemorate Yoni’s heroism at Entebbe, Iddo wrote a book called “Yoni’s Last Battle.” One former commando, however, a prominent military man named Muki Betser, who was at Entebbe, has been hostile to the Netanyahu family and was outraged over Iddo’s book, which he thought inflated Yoni’s role and downplayed the bravery of the rest. “I’m not sure Yoni would have liked what his little brother wrote,” Betser told the Israeli press. In the early nineties, when it became clear that Bibi was emerging as a possible candidate for Prime Minister, the press began publishing stories about Yoni—all unproven—implying that he had made crucial mistakes during the Entebbe mission.\n\nIddo Netanyahu remains Yoni’s main champion. Several months each year, he practices in the United States as a radiologist, a job that earns him enough money to live the rest of the year in Jerusalem with his family and write fiction. I met with Iddo at his house, in the Jerusalem hills. Like his father, Iddo was wary of being quoted, but he is clearly pained by the attacks on the Netanyahus.\n\nRecently, Iddo published a novel in Hebrew entitled “Itamar K.” It can very easily be read as a thinly veiled political attack—and certainly the Israeli press has done so. The hero is Itamar Koller, a young filmmaker who discovers how hard it is in Israel to have right-wing views and still win respect as an artist and an intellectual. In refusing to embrace left-wing ideology, Itamar is rejected by the Israeli cultural élite. Itamar wants to make a movie, but funding goes instead to a left-wing homosexual, and Itamar is left behind with “untapped potential, with no way of knowing whether or not he could have realized it.” The novel features set pieces on two filmmakers who cower before a former terrorist who is now a member of the Palestinian Authority. Itamar meets a writer who is infuriated by the “smiles on the faces of our ministers as they hand Bethlehem, the city where David was born, over to the Arabs.” And so, once more, there is this loneliness, this singularity to the family—the Netanyahus versus the cultural hegemony of the left.\n\nWhile Netanyahu’s early family life is the stuff of Biblical, or at least Portnoyan, complexity, his family life in adulthood, along with his relationships beyond the family, has been a feast for the tabloids.\n\nIn the late seventies, Netanyahu married the first of his three wives, an Israeli woman named Micky, and they had a daughter, Noa. But in Boston Bibi met a woman named Fleur Cates, and when Micky learned of the affair she left him.\n\nNetanyahu entered public life in 1982, when Moshe Arens made him his No. 2 at the Embassy in Washington. Bibi made a name for himself on American television as the smooth Israeli who was everywhere, defending the Begin government’s war in Lebanon. Later, Arens helped place Netanyahu as Israel’s man at the United Nations, and there Bibi became an even more public figure with his support for Soviet Jewry and his attacks on Kurt Waldheim. Netanyahu went back to Israel in 1988 to win a seat in the Knesset and to be Arens’s deputy at the Foreign Ministry. The marriage to Fleur, which was already troubled, fell apart once they were in Israel.\n\nIn 1989, Netanyahu was changing planes at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, and while he was on a moving walkway he spotted an El Al stewardess named Sara Ben-Artzi. “We were going in opposite directions,” she once said, in an interview. “He looked at me until he had to turn his head backwards. Then, on the plane, he came to look for me.”\n\nNetanyahu married Sara in March, 1991, when she was already several months pregnant. According to reports in the Israeli press, Netanyahu postponed the wedding at least once but was finally brought to heel by Yisrael Meir Lau, then the chief rabbi of Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Netanyahus now have two children. It would be folly to guess at the details of their marriage, but it is, by every outward sign, another troubled union. The first of several disasters came in January, 1993, while Netanyahu was in a struggle for the leadership of the Likud Party. Sara received an anonymous phone call telling her that her husband had a “thing” for his image consultant, a married woman named Ruth Bar; what was more, the caller said, there existed a videotape of Bar and Netanyahu in “compromising romantic situations.” Netanyahu’s reaction was to go on television immediately and admit to his infidelity and, without naming names (everyone knew he meant his rival, David Levy), accuse members of his own party of “Mafia methods.” This was “the worst political crime in Israeli history, perhaps in the history of democracy,” he told viewers. He added that his only debt—“if I have a debt and I have a debt on this matter”—was to his wife and children.\n\nAs it happened, no videotape turned up, and now Netanyahu had to apologize to Levy. For his part, Levy called Netanyahu “Napoleon,” “liar,” “eel,” and refused to speak to him or utter his name until 1996.\n\nThe Israeli press has reported that the Netanyahu marriage is sustained now by a series of guidelines laid out by Sara and family lawyers. Sources close to Netanyahu have said that Bibi felt he could not afford yet another divorce and still claim leadership of a conservative and religious political coalition. Netanyahu deflects the subject with various formulaic phrases of contrition and renewal, but his close aide David Bar-Illan was anything but evasive with me.\n\n“The confession of adultery, the Sara business, this all hurt him more than I would have expected,” Bar-Illan said. “For years in Israel no one cared about such things. Moshe Dayan screwed half the women in the Army and even got into trouble over it, but we said we didn’t care. Everyone knew all about it and about other politicians and their affairs. But the atmosphere changed. It’s the feminist thing, which is almost getting Victorian. When Bibi made his confession, it was not particularly subtle. It was hard to mistake what he meant, that he was accusing people in his own party. But it was a terrible mistake going on television and confessing to infidelity. The crime here is getting caught, and he wasn’t caught.”\n\nSince he came to power, Netanyahu’s marriage has remained a target for a hostile press. The tabloids have accused Sara of everything from plagiarizing work in graduate school to being a deranged “clean” freak. Her children’s nanny, Tania Shaw, sued the family, accusing Sara of “enslavement” and mistreatment. A long report in the newspaper Yediot Ahronot featured such details as Sara’s hurling shoes at her servants; in another account, Sara was described as bursting in on high-level government meetings and telling one of the Prime Minister’s aides, a general, to get up, “you’re sitting in my seat.” The over-all impression in the Israeli press is of a dim harridan who has her man by the neck. A member of the Knesset even declared that there should be legislation passed to restrain her.\n\nBar-Illan is supposedly a master of the press, but when I asked him about the marriage, on the record, with my pen and notebook out for all to see, he rolled his eyes and said, “Look, Sara is not the most stable woman in the world. . . . Now she only appears at the appropriate things, receptions for children, things for the retarded or the disadvantaged. And it works. It’s O.K. Finally it’s become boring to Israelis. Had she run half naked through the streets, it might have been something else, but it’s under control.”\n\nWell, not exactly under control. Last year, Sara agreed to be interviewed on Israeli state television. She threw an incredible tantrum, accusing Knesset members of making passes at her, and said of Sonia Peres that just “because Sonia is not educated, and she washes dishes and plays cards—that doesn’t mean I also have to do that.” Sara then turned on her interviewer and finally walked out. She agreed to resume the interview only if the first part was destroyed; the tapes are now in a vault at the studios, but, Israel being Israel, the material leaked almost immediately.\n\nIn another interview, Sara insisted that her marriage was genuine and not at all politically motivated. “They cannot accept that we really love each other,” she said. “Every time we hold hands it’s supposed to be a show. You should see how often we hold hands when we’re alone. It’s unbelievable.”\n\nIn a crude form, Netanyahu’s personal situation recalls Bill Clinton’s, but the comparison is weaker than it seems. Unlike Clinton, who has many layers of friends, both inside the White House and beyond, Netanyahu does not. He has forced out so many aides and ministers in his nearly two years in office that he is left mainly with yes-men. Two of Netanyahu’s oldest friends, Uzi Beller, who is a doctor, and Gabi Picker, a dentist, rarely see him or talk to him anymore. “Nobody sees Bibi a lot,” Beller told me. “Any leader has a small circle of intimates, and Bibi just doesn’t.” Bar-Illan said he considers himself one of Netanyahu’s two or three closest confidants, but even he said, “Bibi is very hard to read emotionally. He’s very closed. It’s not possible to read what he feels, even with me. I never feel I know what’s in his heart or mind. I don’t know who does.”\n\nAn Israeli journalist who has observed Netanyahu closely said, “It’s a very difficult life he has. He is a prisoner in his office. The office is a very small room. With all that security, the moment he walks out, there are several guys at his side. Then he gets into a claustrophobic Cadillac. Wherever he goes, there are these really wild security arrangements. When he goes home, he goes to something worse. He actually has no place to relax, to unwind. All these problems—the press, his family, negotiations—all of it goes along with the idea that he has of the world as always hostile and him fighting everybody and everything all the time.”\n\nNetanyahu’s few pleasures include good food (he has gained nearly fifty pounds since taking office), but while he likes luxury he does not like paying. He is notorious for rarely picking up a check. The left-wing newspaper Kol Ha’ir has reported that Netanyahu, in the past, tried to use his name to get discounts on goods and services. Even Netanyahu’s most characteristic pleasure, his Davidoff cigars, seems to have exploded in his face. In April, the papers discovered that the government was spending some three thousand dollars a month on cigars that cost thirty dollars each. Netanyahu’s spokesmen initially claimed that cigars had always been bought for foreign guests, as a kind of welcoming amenity, but then past Prime Ministers and their aides rushed in to deny it. Shamir, Netanyahu’s ostensible colleague in the Likud, said the only niceties he ever offered foreign guests were a cup of tea “and maybe a cracker to go with it.”\n\nNetanyahu is certainly an outsider, too, in his relationship with Washington, for the White House is, in no small measure, a shrine to the memory of Bibi’s shadow, Yitzhak Rabin. In Clinton’s view, Rabin was the definition of gravitas, of historical risk-taking. There are pictures of Rabin both in the Oval Office and in the upstairs residence. Hillary Clinton prizes a crystal dove given her by Rabin, and in the White House solarium there is the phrase “Shalom, Chaver” in tiles. The President has kept his kipa, his skullcap, from the funeral, and some sand from Rabin’s grave is to be seen on a plate in his study. “It’s almost a cult of Rabin here,” one high-ranking White House official told me. “There’s no one the President admired more or misses more.”\n\nWhen Bill Clinton came on the political scene, the great lions of the late-Cold War era were gone or were fading—Gorbachev, Thatcher, Mitterrand—and the statesman he came to look up to was Rabin. Their first meeting was at the Madison Hotel in Washington, during the 1992 Presidential campaign. In the realm of foreign affairs Clinton was a neophyte, and when Rabin uncorked a lecture about Middle East politics which consumed fifty-five minutes of their allotted hour Clinton was not insulted or bored; he was grateful. From then on, Clinton gravitated to Rabin as to a kind of father figure.\n\n“It looked to me that Clinton saw Rabin as mentor,” said Eitan Haber, one of Rabin’s closest aides. “They spoke on the phone constantly, coördinating every step before anything became a problem, even the smallest step. Even their agreement not to kiss or hug Arafat onstage at the White House—to make it just a handshake—was coördinated.”\n\nRabin’s assassination, in 1995, was devastating for Clinton, and he responded by going to the funeral and spending hours with the Rabin family. (By contrast, when Netanyahu went to embrace Rabin’s daughter, Dalia Pilosof, whom he had known as a student, she said, “Not now. Please, not now.” Rabin’s widow, Leah, made it plain that she preferred the condolences of Yasir Arafat.) With Shimon Peres now the Prime Minister, the relationship with the White House remained politically close yet personally more remote. Peres was more the ideologue—cool, Francophile, aloof.\n\nIn the 1996 Israeli election, however, Clinton made no secret of his preference for Peres over Netanyahu. The major factor, of course, was that Peres favored pushing the Oslo process ahead; Netanyahu’s platform consisted of his alarm about Oslo and his resistance to American pressure.\n\nAmerican television viewers had come to know Netanyahu as “Americanized”—an M.I.T.-educated Israeli politician with a perfect American accent and a feel for CNN and “Nightline.” But Netanyahu’s America was antithetical to Clinton’s: it was Ronald Reagan’s America. Netanyahu’s political friends were Richard Perle, Ronald Lauder, and Jeanne Kirkpatrick. The journalists he favored were, of course, the ones who favored him: A. M. Rosenthal, William Safire, Charles Krauthammer. He yearned for the rise in Israel of the sort of neoconservative movement that had backed Reagan. He let Republicans on Capitol Hill know that he was one of them, a kind of Israeli Republican. And so while he spoke American, he was, and remains, deeply suspicious of the Clinton White House. Of course Clinton loved Rabin, he tells everyone. The Americans always love us when we are giving away everything and getting nothing in return.\n\nWhen Netanyahu came to Washington for the first time as Prime Minister, he appeared determined to show everyone that there was a new man in office, one who would not be pushed around. Itamar Rabinovich, the Israeli Ambassador in Washington at the time, told me, “What I would have told Bibi to do on his first trip—not that he ever would have asked—is to have gone into the White House and said, ‘Let’s let bygones be bygones. I know you supported Peres in the election, but there are no grudges.’ Instead, when they met, in July, 1996, Clinton came out of the meeting saying that Netanyahu behaved and spoke in a tone that didn’t seem to let on that he knew that Clinton was the President of a friendly superpower and that Netanyahu was the leader of a small nation who needs the superpower’s support.” In short, Clinton felt he had been dissed by the leader of a country smaller than Vermont that gets three billion dollars in aid every year.\n\nOne Administration official described the personal chemistry between Clinton and Netanyahu as the same as that between the White House pets, Buddy and Socks. When Air Force One and Netanyahu’s plane were parked next to each other in Los Angeles last November, Clinton decided he didn’t have time for even a brief meeting. Of the relationship, one Administration official later said, “We’re treating him like the President of Bulgaria. Actually, I think he”—Clinton—“will go jogging with the President of Bulgaria, so that’s not fair.”\n\nNetanyahu began a trip to the United States last January by accepting the hospitality of a group of Christian evangelicals—including Jerry Falwell, who’d been selling videos that accused the President of murder. Clinton was furious, but the next morning when he met with Netanyahu he jokingly suggested, “Now we’re even.” Both Netanyahu and David Bar-Illan told me that they had had no idea that Falwell was attacking Clinton so ruthlessly, and Bar-Illan tried to fall on his sword, saying that he had been encouraged by a Jewish contact in New York to meet with the evangelicals because of their support for Israel. Considering how closely Netanyahu and Bar-Illan follow the American scene, their protestations of innocence are hard to believe.\n\n“The relations have never been more tense,” a senior Israeli diplomat told me. “The ironic thing is that after Bibi came back from America having not accepted things, he became a hero to his people, like Saddam Hussein withstanding American pressure.”\n\nNorman Podhoretz, the former editor of Commentary, mainly supports Netanyahu’s hard line with the Palestinians but admitted he was shocked at his performance. “He’s done amazingly poorly, and I wouldn’t have expected that of him,” Podhoretz said. “He used to be able to seduce anyone. . . . But as a friend he’s not a reliable person. It’s like the Kennedys. If he makes a promise or appointment, he doesn’t necessarily keep it. Then he’ll depend on his charm, like Clinton. And the magic has gone out of that trick.”\n\nWhen I asked Netanyahu to characterize his relationship with Clinton, he took a long drag on his cigar and blew smoke through his smile. He is a bearish presence with a broad smile, and he never seemed more satisfied than now.\n\n“It’s correct,” he said. “On a personal level there are interesting moments of affinity, because I think he has tremendous grasp of certain things that probably eluded his immediate circle. First of all, because he’s probably a much better politician than any of them. So he understands certain things from reading the lay of the land. He understands our political situation better than his people, especially those who led him to take the mistaken view of trying to influence the elections. . . . I have to tell you, personally, I like him. It’s very hard not to like him. I wouldn’t tell you we’ve developed warm and cozy relations. It’s not true. It’s possible. It just hasn’t happened.”\n\nWhat Netanyahu has inherited from his father is a keen notion of Us versus Them, a sense that only fools can fail to see what he sees, that Jewish history is in perpetual danger of ending completely, and that Jewish history, considering the role of assimilation in the Diaspora, is in the hands of Israel and, in no small part, its Prime Minister.\n\n“The Jewish people have had a history unlike any other people’s because they lacked the elements of national survival,” he said to me. “On the other hand, they didn’t perish completely. They perished mostly. They were about ten per cent of the Roman Empire at the time of the birth of Christ, so by any calculation they should be about a hundred and twenty million and not twelve million. The fact that we are ten per cent of what we could be is based on many forces, but it is the inability to live in a coherent place with a coherent culture.\n\n“It is not the idea of a diaspora. Other peoples have their diasporas. The Chinese have a diaspora, a far-flung diaspora, but they have a coherent center. We lost the coherent center and were dispersed. Normally what happens to a dispersed people is that they conquer new lands or they disappear. We didn’t conquer new lands, but nor did we disappear, so we were always in the twilight of our existence. Between annihilation and assimilation, you could pretty much predict that the Jewish people would not survive the twenty-first or twenty-second centuries. What happened after the worst catastrophe in our history is that we somehow amassed the national will to reforge a vital center for Jewish life here in Israel. I now think we have a Jewish future, here in Israel. It’s true that, for the first time, the majority of Jews will be here in Israel sometime in the next decade. It’ll happen, maybe even under my watch, I’m not sure. . . .\n\n“You have to protect yourself. This is what the Jews didn’t have. They didn’t have the means to protect themselves against evil, the baser impulses of mankind. And they paid a price unlike any other people. We now have the means to protect ourselves.” ♦"
