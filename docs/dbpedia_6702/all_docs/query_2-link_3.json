His grandfather, Isaac Halevi Herzog, was the first chief rabbi of Ireland (1925–36) after its independence and the second Ashkenazi chief rabbi in the British mandate of Palestine (1936–48), a position that made him the first Ashkenazi chief rabbi of Israel (1948–59) after its independence. His father Chaim Herzog, the first head of Israel’s military intelligence (1948–50; second appointment 1959–62), later served as president of Israel (1983–93).\n\nHerzog’s mother, Aura Ambache, was born to an eastern European family that had migrated to Jaffa (now in Tel Aviv–Yafo) and Jerusalem during the first aliyah (the first wave of migration from the Jewish diaspora to Palestine in 1882–1903). She grew up in Ismailia, Egypt, where her father worked as a consultant for the Suez Canal Company, and in Cairo. She moved to Palestine in 1946, joining the Haganah military organization and enrolling in a course for diplomats, where she met Chaim Herzog. They married the following year. In 1969 Aura Herzog established the Council for a Beautiful Israel, a nonprofit organization that took on environmental initiatives related to quality of life in Israel. She spoke both French and Hebrew and called Isaac Herzog “Bougie,” a French-Hebrew portmanteau (from French bijou, “jewelry,” and Hebrew būbah, “doll”). Her elder sister, Shoshana (“Suzy”) Ambache, was married to Abba Eban, who served as Israel’s first ambassador to the United Nations (1949–59). Herzog later eulogized Suzy Eban as “the personification of the Zionist story,” an attribute that rings true for much of his family.\n\nWhile his own father was serving as Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations (1975–78), Herzog completed his secondary education in New York City. He also took courses at New York University and Cornell University before returning to Israel with his family and enlisting in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). After completing his draft service as a major officer in the Intelligence Corps, he studied law at Tel Aviv University and subsequently joined his father’s law firm.\n\nWhile serving in the IDF, Herzog met Michal Afek, who was also in the Intelligence Corps. They married in 1985 and have three children.\n\nPolitical career\n\nMember of Knesset\n\nHerzog first entered public service as secretary of the Economic-Social Council (1988–90) and was later appointed government secretary in the Israel Labour Party government of Ehud Barak (1999–2001). He was elected to the Knesset in 2003 as a representative of the Labour Party. When in 2005 Labour joined in coalition with Ariel Sharon’s Likud-led government, Sharon placed Herzog in charge of the Ministry of Housing and Construction. That ministry played a key role in relocating Israeli settlers during Israel’s disengagement from the Gaza Strip later that year. Herzog held other portfolios in future governments, heading the Ministry of Tourism (2006–07) and the Ministry of Diaspora, Society, and the Fight Against Anti-Semitism (2007–09) under Prime Minister Ehud Olmert (2006–09) as well as the Ministry of Welfare and Social Services (2007–11) under both Olmert and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (1996–99, 2009–21, and 2022– ).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

As the party cycled through one-term leaders, Herzog was elected chair of the party in 2013. As the 2015 Knesset elections approached, he joined forces with centrist Tzipi Livni to form a joint ticket. The new alliance, named the Zionist Union, finished second in the election with 24 seats—Labour’s strongest performance since 2001. Herzog subsequently became leader of the opposition. But he too lost leadership of the party in 2017 after one term.\n\nSet to lose his prominent position in the Knesset after the following set of elections, he accepted an offer to head the Jewish Agency and resigned from the Knesset in mid-2018. In his role as the chair of the agency, he pledged to strengthen ties between Israel’s right-wing-oriented government and the more left-leaning Jewish diaspora, stating: “A Jew is a Jew is a Jew, no matter his denomination or the type of kippah he chooses to wear or not to wear on his head.”\n\nPresident\n\nIn May 2021 Herzog announced his intention to run for Israel’s presidency, presenting himself as a figure of unity. Although he was affiliated with the Labour Party, he received support from several right-wing members of the Knesset, and he was elected in June by the widest margin in Israel’s history.\n\nDespite the largely ceremonial nature of Israel’s presidency, Herzog’s stature as president was pronounced both abroad and at home. In January 2022 he became the first Israeli president to visit the United Arab Emirates, after the two countries normalized ties in 2020. In March he also became the first Israeli president to make an official visit to Jordan.\n\nHerzog attempted to serve as a cool and collected voice amid fiery controversies that followed the return of Netanyahu to the prime minister’s office in December 2022. Netanyahu, a polarizing figure who was facing trial for corruption, sought in 2023 to reform the country’s judiciary. The proposal would bring the judiciary under legislative oversight, a move popular among right-wing voters who had grown frustrated by what they perceived as frequent judicial overreach into political matters. But, because the reforms would allow the Knesset to override the rulings of the High Court, many Israelis were concerned that the proposal would erode one of the only checks on the power of the ruling coalition. As massive protests broke out and the proposal moved forward in the Knesset, Herzog sought to mediate between factions and offered an alternative plan for reform.\n\nAdam Zeidan"
