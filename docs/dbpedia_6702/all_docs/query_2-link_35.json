        "text": "Latest Developments\n\nSenior figures from Iran’s “Axis of Resistance” joined a swearing-in ceremony for Iran’s new President Masoud Pezeshkian at the Iranian parliament on July 30, replete with anti-Western rhetoric and chants. Red carpet guests in Tehran included Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, Islamic Jihad (PIJ) leader Ziyad al-Nakhalah, Hezbollah Deputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem, and the spokesman of the Houthi rebels in Yemen, Mohammed Abdulsalam.\n\nAccording to Reuters, attendees chanted “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” during Pezeshkian’s speech, in which he declared, “Those who supply weapons that kill children, cannot teach Muslims about humanity.” Pezeshkian, who was elected on July 5 to replace former President Ebrahim Raisi — who died in a helicopter crash — has reached out to Iran’s proxies in recent weeks. Likewise, his rhetoric against Israel and the United States has faithfully echoed that of his predecessors. “Supporting the cause of the oppressed Palestinian nation will continue with strength, and no factor can disrupt our will in this direction,” said Pezeshkian in a July 29 statement, in which he warned Israel that a strike on Lebanon in response to the Hezbollah rocket attack that killed 12 children on a soccer field would result in “heavy consequences.”\n\nExpert Analysis\n\n“The focus on the identity of the Iranian president and his political leanings — whether ‘reformer’ or ‘hardliner’ — are much ado about nothing. Pezeshkian’s election and inauguration changes nothing about Iran’s foreign policy or regional adventurism, including Tehran’s backing of Hezbollah, which will continue during his term in office.” — David Daoud, FDD Senior Fellow\n\n“The Islamic Republic’s steadfast commitment to financing terrorist groups remains a fundamental pillar of its ideology. Rather than signaling their support for the new administration by sending delegates to the inauguration, the international community should leverage public diplomacy channels to condemn the regime’s unfair election process and support the Iranian people’s aspiration for free and fair elections.” — Janatan Sayeh, FDD Research Analyst\n\nEuropean Parliament Members Outraged, Letter from Irish President\n\nOther dignitaries at the event included senior officials from approximately 80 foreign delegations including Armenia, Tajikistan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Cuba, Pakistan, Brazil, and the European Union (EU), which was represented by Spanish diplomat Enrique Mora, chief of staff to EU leader Josep Borrell. Mora’s presence drew condemnation from some EU members, including Adam Bielan, a Polish member of the European parliament. “This decision is not only misguided but stands in direct contradiction to the values and principles that the European Union purports to uphold,” Bielan said in a letter to Borrell. “Iran’s persistent support for terrorist activities and destabilizing actions across the region poses a direct threat to global security and contradicts the EU’s commitment to democracy and human rights.”\n\nOn July 29, Irish President Michael Higgins sent a letter to Pezeshkian offering his “best wishes for the challenges that lie ahead.” Higgins expressed hope that Iran “will play a crucial role in achieving” stability and cooperation in the Middle East, adding that he looked “forward to our two countries continuing to maintain ever-deeper dialogue and cooperation.”\n\nRelated Analysis\n\n“Iranian President-Elect Pezeshkian Lauds Hamas, Houthi Rebels in Yemen,” FDD Flash Brief\n\n“Iran’s President Pezeshkian speaks with Hamas leader, praises Houthis,” by Seth J.
