Given “In appreciation of devoted service and leadership in behalf of the United Jewish Appeal May 4, 1949—The First Anniversary of Israel.” The photograph measures 11 inches by 14 inches. Double matted and framed. The entire piece measures 17.5 inches by 21 inches. Rare and desirable.\n\nChaim Azriel Weizmann was a Zionist leader and Israeli statesman who served as President of the Zionist Organization and later as the first President of Israel. He was elected on 16 February 1949, and served until his death in 1952. Weizmann convinced the United States government to recognize the newly formed state of Israel. Weizmann was also a biochemist who developed the acetone–butanol–ethanol fermentation process, which produces acetone through bacterial fermentation. His acetone production method was of great importance for the British war industry during World War I. He founded the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel and was instrumental in the establishment of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem."
