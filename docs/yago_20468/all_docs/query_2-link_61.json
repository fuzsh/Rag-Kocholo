        "text": "Tabby: Steve Married Me For My Typewrtier\n\nHere's a fun PEOPLE article from way back in 1981. Titled, \"For Years, Stephen King's Firestarter Was Wife Tabitha; Now She Burns to Write, Too,\" the article discusses the King's young (at the time) marriage.\n\nAbout Tabitha's first novel, Small World, King said, \"\"I knew she could write poetry, but I never guessed she could write such a good novel right out of the box.\"\n\nThe article, written while Cujo was awaiting release, recounts this now rather famous story:\n\nAt their 1971 wedding, King walked down the aisle in a borrowed suit, tie and shoes. Their first years together were tough. \"He married me for my typewriter,\" joshes Tabby. Steve didn't own one at the time, and she further subsidized his art by working at a Dunkin' Donuts. Steve taught English in a private school and wrote in his spare time. Before his first book, Carrie, was published in 1974, King had three manuscripts rejected. Carrie almost didn't make it either. At one point he tossed it into a wastebasket. Fortunately, Tabby fished it out."
