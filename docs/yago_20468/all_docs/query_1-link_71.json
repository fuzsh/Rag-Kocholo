        "text": "Earlier this week, my friend Wendy and I went to watch a movie at the Ogden 6 Theater. Right beside the theater is a bargain bookstore. They have a sale going: buy the four books, get the fifth one free. This was just too thrilling for words.\n\nI picked up a Stephen King’s memoir On Writing, the selected letters of the poet John Keats, a collection of poems by Louise Erdrich, another collection of poems by Mark Doty, and an anthology of haiku, with contributions from Basho, Busan, and Issa, edited by Robert Haas.\n\nI’ve been reading, in a sort of slow, meditative way, a book on memoir writing by Dan Allender called To Be Told and the collection of haibun called Haiku Mind by Patricia Donegan. I thought it would be good to read King’s perspectives on memoir since I knew he would have a different sort of kick to his advice.\n\nI’ve always enjoyed Stephen King’s prose style. It’s journalistic, Hemingway-esque. His content is always reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe. There can be little doubt that Stephen King is Poe’s modern counterpart, his literary descendant, the inheritor of his gift. Some of King’s books I’ve never wanted to read, but Firestarter and The Dark Tower were two I enjoyed.\n\nKing, as I learned from reading his life story, is married to a poet. In his book, he includes an early poem she wrote called “A Gradual Canticle for Augustine.” I wanted to include it here because it’s beautiful:\n\nThe thinnest bear is awakened in the winter\n\nby the sleep-laughter of locusts,\n\nby the dream-blustering of bees,\n\nby the honeyed scent of desert sands\n\nthat the wind carries in her womb\n\ninto the distant hills, into the houses of Cedar.\n\nThe bear has heard a sure promise.\n\nCertain words are edible; they nourish\n\nmore than snow heaped upon silver plates\n\nor I is overflowing golden bowls. Chips of ice\n\nfrom the mouth of a lover are not always better,\n\nnor a desert dreaming always a mirage.\n\nThe rising bear sings a gradual canticle\n\nwoven of sand that conquers cities\n\nby a slow cycle. His praise seduces\n\na passing wind, traveling to the sea\n\nwherein a fish, caught in a careful net,\n\nhere is a bear’s song in the cool-scented snow.\n\nTabitha King (1969)\n\nin Stephen King’s On Writing (2000)\n\nStephen King’s Commentary: The poet “knew exactly what she had meant to say, and has said most of it. St. Augustine (A.D. 354-430) she knew both as a Catholic and as a history major. Augustine’s mother (a saint herself) was a Christian, his father a pagan. Before his conversion, Augustine pursued both money and women. Following it he continued to struggle with his sexual impulses, and is known for the Libertine’s Prayer, which goes: “Oh Lord, make me chaste … but not yet.” In his writing he focused on man’s struggle to give up belief in the self in favor of belief in God. And he sometimes likened himself to a bear …\n\nThe canticle is gradual perhaps because the bear’s awakening is gradual. The bear is powerful and sensual, although thin because he is out of his time. In a way, Tabby said when called upon to explicate, the bear can be seen as a symbol of mankind’s troubling and wonderful habit of dreaming the right dreams at the wrong time. Such dreams are difficult because they’re inappropriate, but wonderful in their promise. The poem also suggests that dreams are powerful — the bear’s is strong enough to seduce the wind into bringing his song to a fish caught in a net.” (p.65)\n\np.s. Poetry is everywhere."
