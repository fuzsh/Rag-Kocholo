A subsequent headline on the same story also improperly referred to novelist Tabitha King simply as Stephen King’s wife.\n\nA corrected version of the story is below:\n\nStephen and Tabitha King give $1.25M to genealogical society\n\nNovelists Stephen and Tabitha King have donated $1.25 million to the nation’s oldest and largest genealogical society\n\nBOSTON (AP) — Stephen King and his wife, fellow novelist Tabitha King, have donated $1.25 million to the New England Historic Genealogical Society.\n\nThe Kings made the gift through their foundation.\n\nThe Boston-based organization is the nation’s oldest and largest genealogical society. It says it will use the gift announced Tuesday to develop educational programming and fund a curriculum in family history for public school students.\n\nIt will also help the organization expand its headquarters.\n\nBrenton Simons is president and CEO of the society. He says the money will have “far-reaching benefits.”\n\nThe society says the Kings have deep personal interest in family and local history and their importance in education."
