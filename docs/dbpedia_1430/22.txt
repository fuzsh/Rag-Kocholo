According to Kicker, Stuttgart’s Erik Thommy is about to move to MLS side Sporting Kansas City.

The 27-year-old is close to reaching a full agreement with the American side after his contract in Stuttgart wasn’t extended. Only the final details are left to be clarified before Thommy completes his move to Sporting KC, where he will play alongside compatriot Robert Voloder.

Dynamo Moscow had shown an interest in signing Thommy, who has Kazakh roots and would also be eligible to play for Russia. Instead, the former Fortuna Düsseldorf winger will move to America.

Thommy played 54 games in all competitions for Stuttgart, scoring three and creating 10 after joining the club from Augsburg in 2018 for €500,000, before spending a season on loan in Düsseldorf.

Under Pellegrino Matarazzo, Thommy managed just 265 minutes across 11 Bundesliga games last season, losing his place in the squad to Chris Führich and Omar Marmoush.
