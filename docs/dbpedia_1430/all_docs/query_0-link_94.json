        "text": "Heartfelt tributes have been paid to a Piccadilly Rats member and 'Manchester legend' who sadly passed away this week.\n\nTommy Piggott, known in the cult busking band as 'Tommy Trouble', died on Monday evening (August 5) after suffering a seizure, his family said. They added the dancer, known for donning a 1960s policeman's outfit, had struggled for a number of years with cancer, dementia, and epilepsy.\n\nKerry Ruchat, whose mum Mandy married Mr Piggott in 2014, described him as a 'caring family man' who 'never gave up' his love of dancing and entertaining.\n\nREAD MORE:\"It's my destiny\": The Kentucky man who believes he's descended from an historic Manchester family with plans for our oldest building\n\n\"He was lovely, he was dead caring,\" she told the Manchester Evening News. \"I have four children of my own and he always thought of them as his grandchildren. He absolutely adored them.\"\n\nMr Piggott, who had been living in Moston, is recognised as a Manchester legend for his time as part of the Piccadilly Rats - a busking band known for their wacky performances in Manchester city centre. They also opened the main stage at the 2018 Parklife Festival.\n\nThe band have not performed since 2019, when frontman Ray Boddington sadly died after he was hit by a tram.\n\nIn 2016, the then-74-year-old Piggott was injured after falling off a float during Manchester’s Irish parade. He reportedly suffered several broken ribs and facial injuries, but Kerry said nothing could stop him getting back out there and making people smile.\n\n\"He still went out when he was injured and went dancing in town,\" she said. \"Even after he fell off the float he went back out in a wheelchair. He was always in town just dancing and having a blast. He was always falling over and injuring himself but he still went back, he never gave up really.\n\n\"He loved just going to town and dancing and bringing that joy to other people. That's what he loved to do.\"\n\nShe added Mr Piggott had been living in a care home over the last few months of his life, and suffered a seizure there on Monday night that he was unable to recover from.\n\n\"He was very poorly but he still remembered everybody,\" she said. \"He absolutely idolised the children, bought them little gifts. He was a real family man.\"\n\nShe told the M.E.N he will be 'very missed', not only by the family but by many Mancunians who remember his dancing fondly.\n\n\"He was a big part of all of our lives,\" she said. \"I just hope he is out of pain now, because he was in a lot of pain.\n\n\"He was a legend, and most importantly part of our family.\""
