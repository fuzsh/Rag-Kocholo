SSG Folks always put his soldiers first, way before himself. He was definitely a grunt, through and through. YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN.\"\n\nRoss Cox of Missoula, MT\n\n\"i was assigned to C Co 2/142 and we were scattered all over Iraq from scania down to the Kuwaiti border, I didn't know ssg tommy folks personally, but I did hear his peers talk highly of him and honored him they did. I served in Iraq Operation Iraqi Freedom III from 2005- 2006 and there is no greater fear than knowing that at any given second your life or the life of a comrade could change in an instant, I know first hand based on experience we were (my squad) at RRP 5 when we got into a small arms fire fight and hearing the whistling of an armored piercing bullet barely touching my right cheek and went through 2 refrigerators and got stuck in a 2x4 made me realize that life has no time limit or a time clock, it is the LORD OUR GOD to take us when HE sees that our job on earth is completed, ssg tommy folks mission on earth was completed, it is sad that he had to go the way he did, we have no questions to ask GOD as to why. all I know is that he is in a better place and he is in a platoon of angels watching over those he left behind. with this I say REST EASY SSG FOLKS MISSION COMPLETE\n\nSGT CORDOVA,NORMAN U.S.ARMY/TEXAS ARMY NATIONAL GUARD (RETIRED)\"\n\nSGT NORMAN CORDOVA RETIRED of AMARILLO, TEXAS\n\n\"It is Memorial Day, almost 11 years after we lost Tommy.

You told me once that you thought the very same.I am not sure how often or well I was able to do that, but I tried to make every decision that affected Soldiers' lives count. I watched you with your guys, and I knew that you were are rare man. In all these years, I've never known a more committed, selfless leader. You set the standard for us all to follow.\n\nWe were peers at 10th MTN, and again in the 36th, but I always looked to you as the kind of NCO I strived to be. Thank you, Tommy.

He was an incredible soldier and never ONCE complained about mission or conditions. I am at a true loss and cannot begin to understand what his family is going through at this time. I know it has been a few years, but I am only finding out about his loss now. I cannot hide my feelings as to how good a soldier and individual Tommy was to the entire platoon. He would accept any mission and complete it without fail. He was the silent, dependable soldier that always rose to the occasion. You are truly missed SGT Folks - my thoughts will be with you always.

Your friend in Jesus Christ, Polly Ballew Covington,Ga\"\n\n\"Tommy Folks Sr., Tommy Folks was a great man (a true soldier). I was a fellow squad leader in his platoon in Iraq. He would always get us up earlier then other platoons when it was time to train (when he was plt. sgt) and I hated him for that. But I see now that he was only trying to prepare us the best way he knew how, and did an outstanding job at it. (We were the most prepared platoon there, mostly of yours son's leadership qualities you've instilled in him) He will surely be missed.\"\n\nSSG. Parker, Levi of Arlington, Texas\n\n\"To Tommy Folks, Sr.:\n\nYou don't need me to tell you what a great man your son was. I will tell you how he affected those of us who served with him. I served as the Platoon Sergeant of 1st Platoon in Company A with Tommy. I frequently had dealings with Tommy as he was senior squad leader of 3rd Platoon. I remember a conversation in Ft Hood that Tommy and I had where we discovered that we had served in the same battalion in Hohenfels, but never knew it prior. We always had a laugh about that afterwards. It never ceased to amaze me how committed Tommy was to his men, his mission and his company. You never saw one of Tommy's men working without Tommy right next to him. He had the rough hands of a true working man. I was often humbled by the way basic leadership skills (that I had to learn and work at) came so easily to Tommy. Tommy always put the needs of others and his unit above his own. I will never forget your son. I was in Al Asad on another mission when Tommy gave all, he was using the truck I had left behind when I left on the 6 week mission to the Al Anbar province, bumper number TA 19, sitting in my seat. For the rest of my days, Tommy will ride with me.\"\n\nSFC Erik L. Felde of Austin, Texas\n\n\"To SSG. Tommy Folks family,\n\nI served with Tommy in 1-4 Inf BN. Hohenfels, Germany. He and I came up through the ranks together. I PCS from Germany to Ft. Bragg and unfortunately lost contact with him. We had some great times together, I will never forget. I also served in Iraq. Much of that time I wish I could Forget. Tommy was a great friend, and an even better soldier. I miss him, and think of him often. I learned of his death by watching the evening news. I didn't sleep well that night. He will be missed.\"\n\nScott Kainz of Stoddard, Wisconsin\n\n\"I didn't know him as well as I should have. But he was a great squad leader for our company. My prayers are with your family\"\n\nStewart of beaumont, tx\n\n\"I knew Tommy from the time he was just a boy.I have never been more proud or saddened by his death.Tommy was a very private man. Learning of his heroic actions in Afghanastan, and then in Iraq, was both comforting and amazing. Hearing from his brave brothers and of their respect for him meant so much to all of us in our home town of Amarillo. I hope no one ever forgets TOMMY. His three sisters and father never wiil.\"\n\nLeslie Wilkerson of Amarillo,Tx. USA\n\n\"I knew Tommy in college back at UNT. I was in my freshman year. He and I were in the same collge organization along with my friend Todd. Todd and Tommy hit it off and later became roommates at College Inn, I used to call them Beavis & Butthead because they both loved watching the show and making noises like the two....\n\nTodd called me today to let me know he found out about Tommy's passing and I sat in traffic thinking about the times back in '92....\n\nI'm sending my prayers to his family .... I wish I had kept better contact with him . If his family is reading this, I have videotape of him back then.
