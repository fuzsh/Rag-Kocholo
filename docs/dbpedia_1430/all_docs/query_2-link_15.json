        "text": "Kansas City, Kansas (Wed., June 19, 2024) â Real Salt Lake (10-2-7 / 37 points / 1st West) extended its historic unbeaten streak to 15 matches with a dramatic 4-3 road victory at Sporting Kansas City, surpassing the single-season franchise record established in 2010. RSL has now earned points in the Clubâs last 10 matches away from America First Field, losing only the Feb. 21, 2024 opener at Miami en route to a 4-1-6 / 18-point road record. The win gives Manager Pablo Mastroeni his 50th victory across all competitions with RSL, the quickest to the half-century mark in the Clubâs coaching history.\n\nReal Salt Lake came out flying for the midweek matchup, as All-Star hopeful and second-year phenom Emeka Eneli donned the Captainâs armband for the first time to become the youngest Captain in the Clubâs 20-year-history. Despite the early energy, it would be RSLâs 19-year-old goalkeeper Gavin Beavers, in his fifth MLS start of the year, facing the first test of the match. With Sporting KC winning corners in the 9th and 10th minutes, Beavers was forced to come off his line at full extension to parry both dangerous crosses off trajectory and out of the box.\n\nDespite the early danger, RSL would convert its first big chance of the game into an early 1-0 lead, as red-hot AndrÃ©s GÃ³mez scored in the 14th minute. RSL was hounding Kansas City through the midfield when Braian Ojeda jumped a loose touch to intercept the ball and start a lightning-quick counter attack. Immediately feeding it to Diego Luna, the young winger raced forward with Anderson Julio off to his left and GÃ³mez to his right, both making runs into the box. Dribbling left to move the defenders before playing a clinical through-ball to GÃ³mez on the right, GÃ³mez showed world-class pace as he ripped past two defenders deep into the box, needing only three touches before connecting perfectly with his right foot to send the ball soaring into the far post side netting.\n\nSporting KC nearly evened the match moments later as Ojeda made a challenge on Erik Thommyâs attempt in the box, the referee awarding a penalty. With SKC captain Johnny Russell taking the responsibility, he stepped up to the spot and sent a powerful shot low to the right side, Beavers perfectly reading Russell and diving with confidence at full extension to get both gloves on the shot and deflect it away. The PK save was the first of Beaversâ young MLS career in regulation as he became the second-youngest goalkeeper in Major League Soccer history to save a penalty kick (19 years, 51 days).\n\nKC would not be denied the equalizer, breaking through in the 28th minute. Nemanja Radoja controlled it in the attacking third when he played a quick pass to Stephen Afrifra outside of the box as he sat in a pocket between four RSL defenders. Stephen Afrifa took a clever touch and quickly cut upfield, creating just enough space with a final touch to the right side before sneaking a well-placed low strike back against his momentum and into the corner of goal at the far post.\n\nComing out with intensity, Realâs rabid high press quickly created a third transition goal of the match in the 51st minute. As Philip Quinton stepped up to clear a KC pass back into the midfield, Julio got on the end of it to drag in a sliding defender. His tackle deflected the ball behind, halfway between GÃ³mez and a single KC defender as he leapt forward with no hesitation to tap it past the lunging defender and run into the box on an uncontested breakaway. Face-to-face with Melia as he came out to challenge GÃ³mez, the young Columbian showed maturity as he smoothly chipped a lofted ball high over Melia and into the back of the net - jogging to the corner flag as a crowd of Claret-and-Cobalt shirts convened to celebrate his 10th goal of the season. GÃ³mezâs 10 goals is tied for 6th best in MLS this season (Arango, Benteke, Bouanga, Messi, SuÃ¡rez).\n\nBeavers was once again called into action as the hero when KC threatened in the 57th and again in the 59th. First, Beavers dealt with power in the 57th as Kansas Cityâs Russell cut across goal and onto his preferred left foot in the center of the box, sending a low-driven rocket at Beavers that he swallowed up cleanly. Then Beavers showed his athleticism as Thommy ripped a curling ball up and over the crowded area in the 59th, his shot tracking for the top corner when Beavers leapt a full extension to get a glove on it and send the attempt out of play.\n\nKansas City would not sit quietly though, as it pushed forward to get a goal back in the 70th minute. With KC probing in the attacking third, Thommy laid it off to Zorhan Bassong on the left wing. Bassong juking left and faked a cross to create space before moving left once more to whip it in, his cross sailing towards Agada in the center of the box. Agada took a touch with his chest and settled it with his left before smashing it into the back of the net with his right foot.\n\nWith Club history nearly within reach for RSL, the Claret-and-Cobalt scored a dagger fourth goal in the 84th minute to seal the deal. As Captain Chicho Arango ran down a long cross on the left side of the box, he held up play and waited for the run of Matt Crooks in the middle. Arango then floated a perfectly-placed cross onto the head of the leaping 6â6ââ Englishman as he smashed the point-blank header into the back of the net, his first goal in an RSL shirt since coming to Utah from Middlesbrough (EFL Championship) in January. The assist for Arango was his 10th of the year to bring his total on the year to a league-high 26th goal contribution.\n\nKansas City added some late drama to the mix, scoring to cut the RSL lead to one at 90+5 in stoppage time. Lining up for a late corner, Memo RodrÃ­guez whipped a cross centrally. It found its way over the traffic of the box and onto the head of Agada, sending it downward with power as it bounced into the back of the net. The late momentum would not be enough to find an equalizer though, as the final whistle blew with RSL up 4-3 to clinch its 15th unbeaten and remain atop the Western Conference.\n\nGOAL-SCORING SUMMARY:\n\nRSL - 14â - AndrÃ©s GÃ³mez (Diego Luna, Braian Ojeda): RSL was hounding Kansas City as it built up through the midfield when Braian Ojeda jumped a loose touch to intercept the ball and start a lightning-quick counter attack. Immediately feeding it to Diego Luna, the young winger raced forward with Anderson Julio off to his left and GÃ³mez to his right, both making runs into the box. Dribbling left to move the defenders before playing a clinical through-ball to GÃ³mez on the right, the 21-year-old showed world-class pace as he ripped past two defenders deep into the box, needing only three touches before connecting perfectly with his right foot to send the ball soaring into the far post side netting.\n\nSKC - 28â - Stephan Afrifa (Nemanja Radoja): Nemanja Radoja controlled it in the attacking third when he played a quick pass to Stephen Afrifra outside of the box as he sat in a pocket between four RSL defenders. Afrifa took a clever touch and quickly cut upfield, creating just enough space with a final touch to the right side before sneaking a well-placed low strike back against his momentum and into the corner of goal at the far post.\n\nRSL - 33â - Anderson Julio (Diego Luna, Emeka Eneli): Beginning with a goal kick, Beavers played short left to Ojeda who quickly moved it forward to Emeka Eneli, the 24-year-old captaining RSL for the first time to become the youngest to wear the armband in Club history. Eneli spotted Luna flashing in the midfield and played an accurate ball to his feet, Luna taking a good touch and advancing it to the halfway line with his head up. Julio found himself isolated with the back line of KC up top, showing his own world-class pace as he easily darted behind the defense to receive a perfect through ball from Luna sending him into the box. One-on-one with only Tim Melia to beat, Julio showed his technique as he calmly chipped the âkeeper to reinstate his teamâs advantage.\n\nRSL - 51â - AndrÃ©s GÃ³mez (Unassisted): As Philip Quinton stepped up to clear a KC pass back into the midfield, Julio got on the end of it to drag in a sliding defender. His tackle deflected the ball behind, halfway between GÃ³mez and a single KC defender as he leapt forward with no hesitation to tap it past the lunging defender and run into the box on an uncontested breakaway. Face-to-face with Molia as he came out to challenge GÃ³mez, the young Columbian showed maturity as he smoothly chipped a lofted ball high over Molia and into the back of the net.\n\nSKC - 70â - Willy Agada (Zorhan Bassong): With KC probing in the attacking third, Thommy laid it off to Zorhan Bassong on the left wing. Bassong juking left and faked a cross to create space before moving left once more to whip it in, his cross sailing towards Agada in the center of the box. Agada took a touch with his chest and settled it with his left before smashing it into the back of the net with his right foot.\n\nRSL - 84â - Matt Crooks (Chicho Arango, Andres GÃ³mez): As Captain Chicho Arango ran down a long cross on the left side of the box, he held up play and waited for the run of Matt Crooks in the middle. Arango then floated a perfectly-placed cross onto the head of the leaping 6â6ââ Englishman as he smashed the point-blank header into the back of the net.\n\nRSL - 90+5â - Willy Agada (Memo RodrÃ­guez): Lining up for a late corner, Memo RodrÃ­guez whipped a cross centrally. It found its way over the traffic of the box and onto the head of Agada, sending it downward with power as it bounced into the back of the net.\n\nNOTES FROM RSL 5:1 @ SKC:\n\nRSL now unbeaten in 15 consecutive matches, breaking the longest single-season streak in Club history (14, 2010).
