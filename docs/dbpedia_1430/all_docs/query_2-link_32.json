        "text": "Willy Agada joined Sporting KC in a transfer from Israeli side Hapoel Jerusalem in June 2022. A native of Nigeria, Agada scored 37 goals across four seasons in Israel before heading to the United States. Agada enjoyed an incredible start to his Sporting KC career, tallying eight goals and two assists in just 12 appearances to close out 2022 - placing him among the best goalscorers by a per-game basis in the league.\n\nAgada turned professional as an 18-year-old and bagged eight goals during his first season with Hapoel Jerusalem in 2018-2019. He doubled his goal haul the following year, scoring a team-best 15 times across 36 appearances in the Israeli second division. Agadaâs excellent 2019-2020 campaign paved the way for a loan to Hapoel Haifa in the Israeli Premier League where he finished second on the team with six goals in 2020-2021. The 2021-2022 season saw Agada return to Hapoel Jerusalem, which had gained promotion to the Premier League and led the team with eight goals.\n\nPROFESSIONAL\n\n2023: Made 16 appearances across all competitions, tallying four goals. Missed three-and-a-half months from mid-April to early August after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his leg. MLS Regular Season: Started seven of 14 appearances, finding the back of the net on three occasions. Scored his first goal of the season with the opener in the 4-1 loss to Seattle on March 25 before undergoing surgery following the April 15 match at San Jose, with his next regular-season appearance coming as a late substitute in the 3-0 win over San Jose on Aug. 26. Scored the game-winner in the 2-1 victory over Houston Dynamo FC on Sept. 23 before tallying a consolation goal in the 4-1 setback at St. Louis on Sept. 30. MLS Cup Playoffs: Made one appearance, playing the final six minutes of Sporting's 1-0 loss to Houston in the Western Conference Semifinals. Open Cup: Did not feature. Leagues Cup: Made his comeback from injury in the 4-1 loss to Toluca FC in the Round of 32 on Aug. 4, scoring a late consolation goal on his return.\n\n2022: Signed with Sporting on June 23. Named Co-Newcomer of the Year with midfielder Erik Thommy. Claimed Co-Golden Boot honors finishing the season tied with Johnny Russell at eight goals. Received two MLS Team of the Week Selections for week 26 and Week 32. MLS Regular Season: Started 10 of 12 appearances, scored a club-high eight goals and added two assists (918 minutes played). Debuted for the club on July 23, coming on as a substitute against LAFC in the 86th minute before making his first start against Austin FC on July 30. Opened his Sporting KC scoring account with a brace against the LA Galaxy in a 4-2 win on Aug. 6. Followed that up on Aug. 13 with a goal on the road at Austin FC. Earned his second multi-score match against the Portland Timbers on Aug. 21, scoring the first and fourth goal for the team. Also picked up his first Sporting KC assist, setting up Erik Thommy's score in the 40th minute. Assisted Felipe Hernandez's goal, which proved to be the leveling goal of a 2-2 match against the LA Galaxy on Aug. 4. Bagged his third brace of the season and team-best third multicore game with two strikes against Minnesota United on Sept. 17. Scored his eighth goal in Sporting blue on Oct. 2 in a 1-0 victory over the Seattle Sounders in the club's 2022 home finale. Open Cup: Made one Open Cup appearance (59 minutes played). Entered in the second half of Sporting's Open Cup Semifinal bout with Sacramento Republic FC on July 27 and converted his kick from the spot in a penalty kick shootout.\n\nHapoel Jerusalem (2022): Rejoined Hapoel Jerusalem after they earned promotion into the Israeli Premier League. For the first half of the season, before he joined Sporting Kansas City, Agada scored eight goals and played in 32 matches in all competitions.\n\nHapoel Haifa (2021): Following his breakout 2019-20 season, he went on loan to top-flight, Israeli Premier League side Hapoel Haifa. He made 18 league appearances, scored four goals and tallied two assists. In Relegation Round play he scored twice and added two assists in seven matches to help Hapoel Haifa avoid relegation and remain in the Israeli Premier League."
