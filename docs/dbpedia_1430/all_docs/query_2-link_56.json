        "text": "Tommy plays the role of the protagonist in Last Man Out; however, his sister Emily becomes his main focus several times throughout the story. There are not many antagonists in this book, but a couple of football players cause Tommy’s already out-of-control emotions to worsen. Tommy’s best friend is Rob Greco, whose nickname is Greck. He gets the name from the New England Patriots player, Rob Gronkowski, whose nickname is Gronk. Greck is described as “the Bears’ middle linebacker”(2), and “a heat-seeking missile on a football field (2).” Tommy’s sister Emily, Em, is excellent at soccer with long legs, and she often is compared to professional soccer players. Tommy’s mom goes about her normal day, being a stay at home mom, but worries her most is her kids.\n\nOne of the first memory moments is about him and his dad practicing at the park. They then were talking about football and then Tommy’s father said “Everyone wanted to play offence…” He was talking about how all of his friends and pretty much everyone else who wants to play offence instead of defence. But Tommy and his dad play defence I feel like that brings a connection from Tommy’s dad to Tommy. It adds a person vs. person conflict. Tommy is sad since, he and his father won't have that connection ever again because he is gone.\n\nIt gives great explanation of how a little heart can go a long way. Tim explains how success comes in many ways but having, “When you have the ability to do what you love, love what you do and have the ability to impact people. That’s having a life of success. That’s what having a life of meaning is” (Tebow 22). This gives great insight on how Tim believes success defines him as an individual and how maybe he can give better reasoning to make you believe that success is shaped this way. Therefore, I believe this book was an excellent read for anyone willing to understand more about Tim’s life, football in general, and how god chose his\n\nHe never did anything to show off, he did it because he felt it was the right thing to do. One day, one of the teammates forgot to bring donuts for breakfast for the team, so his teammates tied him up to a goal post. When Pat got there, he knew that was wrong; so, Pat untied the guy. He didn’t do this to be the guy’s best friend; he did it because he knew it was the right thing to do. Another example of Pat’s selflessness is when he came home from war, he told everyone he wanted to stay home but he went back. He went back not because he wanted to, but because he “had” to since he made the commitment. He didn’t do what he wanted to, he did what needed be done. He never played well in football, so that he could earn his name in magazines; he played hard in games because he was passionate about football. He played football because he loved the sport, but loved playing it even more. It was highly noticeable that Pat was a very unselfish\n\nFootball was and is a very popular sport in America and has always been a favorite. Erik Fisher plays football because he is great at the sport, hence page 27, “Dad had brought Erik to meet Coach Warner earlier in the summer. Dad had knelt down and held the ball for Erik to drill fifty-yard field goals, one after another, while according to Dad, the Coach’s jaw had dropped lower and lower.” But, Erik played football primarily for and because of the fame. He had never cared about whether he had to hurt someone in order reach the top of the “Erik Fisher Football Dream”. On September 5 (pages 50-94), when Mike Costello dies of lightning, Paul finds Erik and Arthur laughing about how Mike’s hair was singed off. Paul was disgusted. Though Erik and Arthur didn’t kill Mike, their laughter reflects their inner evil and selfish selves. Paul then reflects on his own self and decides to walk a path of truth, unlike Erik. In continuation, Ray Lewis had once said, “Don't walk through life just playing football. Don't walk through life just being an athlete. Athletics will fade. Character and integrity and really making an impact on someone's life, that's the ultimate vision, that's the ultimate goal-bottom line.” Erik never had any character or integrity, whether he played sports or not. On the other hand, Paul did have character and integrity. Paul noticed Erik’s evil actions to get higher and higher up the Erik Fisher Football\n\nI wasn't about to go through that flaming door, so I slammed a big rock through a window and pulled myself in. It was a wonder I didn't cut myself to death, now that I think about it.” He shows courage because he barrels into the church that was a raging inferno to save innocent children. He also shows courage at the end of the book, “’You're the guy that killed Bob Sheldon,’ one of them said. ‘And he was a friend of ours. We don't like nobody killing our friends, especially greasers.’ ‘Big deal.’ I busted the end of my bottle and held on to the neck and tossed away my cigarette. ‘You get back into your car or you'll get split.’ They looked kind of surprised, and one of them backed up. ‘I mean it.’ I hopped off the car. ‘I've had about all I can take from you guys.’ I started toward them, holding the bottle the way Tim Shepard holds a switch--- out and away from myself, in a loose but firm hold. I guess they knew I meant business, because they got into their car and drove off.” He fearlessly opposes the Socials, clearly showing that he has great courage and should not be underestimated. Also, another time that Ponyboy proves to be a courageous person is when he fights at the rumble even though he feels a bit sick. He put his gang first and fought for them in the rumble.\n\nHe was short sighted because, he sees danger ahead of him, but assumes that there is nothing wrong. He was insensitive to the harsh weather conditions he was facing. The narrator saw the effects of the harsh cold weather, but he exhorts himself in continuing with the journey to the camp. He was just trying to be stubborn, and his pride made him believe that he will be a hero by beating all the odds of the cold weather, by reaching the camp safe and sound. The narrator was overestimating his abilities, and his pride and arrogance clouds his logical thinking into making the right choice, which was to turn back, other than moving on with the journey.\n\nSports are a significant part of society and spectators enjoy particular events regardless of the type. However, there are many players who develop special working and social relationships with whom they are participating regardless of the type of sport. The relationship and how people interact with one another can be the determination of how successful a team can be. The particular film based on a true story that I chose is titled When the Game Stands Tall. This film consists of a high performing football team of De La Salle High School in the state of California. Jim Caviezel portrays the head coach (Bob Ladouceur) as a man with such vision and passion that goes beyond the fundamental principles of coaching the game of football. The football team had won 151 games without being defeated which is the highest winning record a team has had in the game of football. The film shows the internal struggles of the players in their lives as people, and how they perform on the field. It also shows the external tragic difficulties that they face while they attend and play for De Le Salle High School. In the movie, the head coach helps the students/players by not only coaching them but also showing them how to live a flourishing life by committing to endure difficult life situations and the way to overcome them. He helps teach the principles of brotherhood and companionship with the team that they build. In the movie, the head coach and the staff had taught the players\n\nHe’s a leader, a hard-worker, curious, and strives for perfection. He is superego driven, meaning that his dominated by his inner self. The ideas and expectations he sets for himself is what is displayed to the public. On the surface, Brady has satisfied basic needs, and is working towards self-actualization. This is seen in the amount of work he does in order to ensure he may have peak performance in his career. Cardinal traits dominate much of who Brady is. As previously stated, his leadership has been pointed out by teammates and coaches. These personality traits are a direct link to his personality type. Lastly, Brady is a living example of the social cognitive theory. Brady may spend hours on end watching film analyzing his mistakes. Through this, he learns what works, what doesn’t, and how to get the best of his"
