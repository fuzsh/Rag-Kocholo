        "text": "VANCOUVER, BC â Vancouver Whitecaps FC fought for the full 90 minutes and ultimately came from behind to earn a point in a 1-1 draw against Western Conference rivals Sporting Kansas City this Saturday evening at BC Place.\n\nThe visitors opened the scoring in the 20th minute. On a corner kick, Erik Thommyâs delivery connected to Alan Pulido, who headed it in to make it 1-0.\n\nAfter the halftime interval, Vancouver continued to find multiple opportunities in the final third. Midfielder AndrÃ©s Cubasâ quick pass sprung Ryan Gauld on a counterattack, which concluded with Brian Whiteâs attempt on target tipped by goalkeeper Kendall McIntosh before it hit the post in the 60th minute.\n\nAs the match neared its end, substitute DÃ©iber Caicedo was taken down in the box, and after video review the 'Caps were awarded a penalty kick. Gauld calmly converted from the spot to put his squad back in the game and level the match at 1-1 in the 88th minute.\n\nVancouver looked to find the winner at the death. Simon Becher intercepted a pass from McIntosh in net, and drove forward before laying off to Gauld. The Scotsman's cross connected to Caicedo, but his volley went over the net just before the referee blew the full-time whistle.\n\nWhitecaps FC now set their sights firmly on the Canadian Championship Final. The 'Caps look to defend their Voyageurs Cup title this upcoming Wednesday, June 7, as the club will host CF MontrÃ©al in a 7 p.m. PT kickoff at BC Place. The first 15,000 fans will receive a rally towel, and the club will be paying for 50 per cent off all drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, from The Warmup patio at 4 p.m. PT until kickoff in-stadium. For tickets, visit whitecapsfc.com/runitback.\n\nThe 'Caps are then back at BC Place next Saturday, June 10 against league-leading FC Cincinnati. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. PT and tickets are available at whitecapsfc.com/tickets.\n\nMATCH DETAILS\n\nVWFC GE Appliances Player of Quality: Ranko VeselinoviÄ\n\nAttendance: 13,739*\n\nReferee*: Lukasz Szpala\n\nScoring Summary\n\n20â â SKC â Alan Pulido (Erik Thommy)\n\n88â â VAN â Ryan Gauld\n\nStatistics\n\nPossession: VAN 54.8% â SKC 45.2%\n\nShots: VAN 11 â SKC 12\n\nShots on Goal: VAN 3 â SKC 2\n\nSaves: VAN 1 â SKC 2\n\nFouls: VAN 11 â SKC 7\n\nOffsides: VAN 6 â SKC 0\n\nCorners: VAN 4 â SKC 5\n\nCautions\n\n7â â SKC â Robert Castellanos\n\n39â â VAN â Brian White\n\n63â â VAN â Tristan Blackmon\n\n69â â VAN â AndrÃ©s Cubas\n\n78â â VAN â Ryan Gauld\n\n79â â SKC â Gadi Kinda\n\n86â â VAN â Vanni Sartini\n\n90â+â5 â SKC â Kendall McIntosh\n\nVancouver Whitecaps FC\n\n18.Yohei Takaoka; 2.MathÃ­as Laborda (8.Alessandro SchÃ¶pf 66â), 4.Ranko VeselinoviÄ, 6.Tristan Blackmon, 14.LuÃ­s Martins; 19.Julian Gressel, 20.AndrÃ©s Cubas (7.DÃ©iber Caicedo 76â), 45.Pedro Vite (16.Sebastian Berhalter 89â); 25.Ryan Gauld Â©, 24.Brian White; 9.Sergio CÃ³rdova (29.Simon Becher 76â)\n\nSubstitutes not used\n\n32.Isaac Boehmer, 23.Javain Brown, 27.Ryan Raposo, 31.Russell Teibert, 61.Matteo Campagna\n\nSporting Kansas City\n\n22.Kendall McIntosh; 17.Jake Davis, 19.Robert Castellanos, 3.Andreu FontÃ s (4.Robert Voloder HT), 18.Logan Ndenbe (14.Tim Leibold 42â); 54.RÃ©mi Walter, 6.Nemanja Radoja, 26.Erik Thommy (15.Roger Espinoza 89â); 77.Marinos Tzionis (11.Khiry Shelton 71â), 9.Alan Pulido (10.Gadi Kinda 71â), 20.DÃ¡niel SallÃ³i"
