        "text": "A/N: This is going to be a wild ride. Enjoy, please read summary first for lack of confusion <3\n\nChapter 1- 2026\n\n\"Kids, your grandfather is here!\" I called from the bottom of the steps and rolled my eyes as the two 14-year olds ignored me once again.\n\n\"You know, for having a mother that is literally the STRONGEST HUMAN ON THE PLANET you think they would have a little more respect.\" Erik laughed as I retreated back to the kitchen.\n\n\"Teenagers, what are you going to do?\" Erik took a seat at the kitchen table and I joined him with a cup of coffee for myself and tea for the old bag.\n\n\"Still referring to yourself as a human I see?\" I gave Erik an incredulous look; we had talked about this several times since the twins started going to Charles' school which he moved to Alberta so that the twins could still attend and he also believed Canada was a safer environment anyway. I rolled my eyes at the notion but there was also no way I would move my family back to New York. This was our home, that would never change.\n\n\"I'm not a mutant, Erik.\"\n\n\"I know we've talked about this for what feels like a hundred times but if Charles and I are teaching the twins that they are mutants and mutantkind deserve the same respect as humans then don't you think their own mother should accept that part of herself?\" in many ways, Erik had a point. I knew it was an oxymoron to allow Erik and Charles to teach my kids one thing while I rejected it completely.\n\n\"I just don't identify with the term. I don't care that you teach the twins that, whatever helps them come to terms with what they are but I just don't see myself as that.\" I explain to the older man for what also feels like the hundredth time.\n\nErik didn't continue to press, instead he nodded and took a sip of his now lukewarm Earl Grey tea. The years spent with Charles' truly rubbed off on him, especially since he was German but the man literally went through the holocaust, I don't blame him for having identity issues.\n\n\"Have you spoken to her?\" I questioned quietly just in case the twins decided to listen to me and come down the stairs at that time.\n\n\"Last week, she's well.\" I nodded because that was all I wanted to know.\n\n\"You should bring the twins to see her.\" Erik said lightly but I shook my head definitively.\n\n\"No, not yet. Natasha is their mother, just because she didn't give birth to them doesn't mean that she isn't just as much if not more. She's here, raising them with me, loving them equally. Natasha didn't attempt to destroy our reality and is now paying for it. As far as I'm concerned Natasha is their only mother.\" I could taste the bitterness in my tone, I didn't like it but it was how I felt right now. Natasha was the twins' mother, not Wanda. Maybe one day but for now, that is all they know.\n\n\"Yes, because having a deadly assassin who's ledger is gushing blood to raise your children is just as normal and-\" I hit my fist on the table to stop Erik from speaking and I felt the blood red seeping into my eyes.\n\n\"Don't you dare. That isn't Natasha and hasn't been for over 20 years. Don't forget who you're speaking to and certainly don't forget who you are as well.\" I started through gritted teeth and squeezed my eyes shut to force out the red from my eyes.\n\n\"We are all not normal and we have all made mistakes. Wanda's just happens to be more recent and more deadly than what any of us could have done.\" Erik rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Well more deadly than anything Natasha and I could do.\" Erik said referring to the Phoenix Force that still fully lived within me, indicating that if I wanted I could certainly destroy this world at my whim.\n\n\"Erik, I like you, you bring a piece of Wanda to the twins that they can't have right now even though you did nothing for her until recently but don't push me.\" I said, standing up and putting my mug in the sink once the red dissipated. It was getting easier and easier to force it away.\n\n\"And certainly don't push me on the Wanda subject. The answer is no and will be no for years. Am I clear?\" I questioned as I walked by Erik who was still seated.\n\n\"Clear.\"\n\nI nodded and began my trek up the steps to retrieve my children for school. I went up to Tommy's room first and knocked gently, the door flew open almost immediately and the almost as tall as Natasha boy smiled while removing his headphones.\n\n\"Hi mom, is grandpa here?\" Tommy questioned, I just rolled my eyes.\n\n\"Well if you didn't have those things on you would've heard me calling for you 20 minutes ago.\" I said sternly and Tommy gave me an apologetic look.\n\n\"Sorry, I was just in my own world this morning.\" Tommy looked down and he seemed truly upset that he hadn't heard me.\n\n\"Don't worry about it my boy, just be more aware, okay?\" I ruffled the top of his head and his mop of hair got messed up.\n\nTommy groaned and attempted to fix it but I just laughed.\n\n\"If you got a haircut, you wouldn't have to worry about that, you know?\" Tommy groaned again.\n\n\"No thanks, I like the hair.\" Tommy replied while looking at a picture he had on his wall.\n\nI followed his eyeline and was met with a photo of James and I from World War II. Tommy's hair certainly was reminiscent of James' back then.\n\n\"Okay, get downstairs, I gotta grab your sister.\" I gave the boy who was looking more and more like a mixture of me and his uncle everyday a pat on the back and he nodded while grabbing his bag.\n\nTommy exited his room and I followed behind him until I turned right to Laura's room. I approached the door and knocked gently. The door didn't open right away, in fact it took Laura a whole 5 minutes until the door swung open and she gave me an annoyed look. I love teenage girls, I internally groaned.\n\n\"Grandpa here?\" the twin that was a literal spitting image of Wanda asked and I nodded.\n\n\"He's been here for 20 minutes, you would've known if you heard me call for you.\" I said with slight annoyance in my voice and she rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Sorry\" was all Laura said and grabbed her bag while slamming her door shut and brushing by me.\n\n\"Good morning to you too mom.\" I said to myself and followed my hot-headed teenager down the steps.\n\nI walked into the kitchen to find Tommy and Laura speaking with their grandfather so I didn't interrupt. Instead I retreated to the living room and sat in my chair while they got ready to leave for school. I picked up Little Women and continued reading where I left off knowing I could read it from literally anywhere since I've read it over 50 times.\n\n\"Mom, we're leaving.\" Tommy spoke up, breaking me from the death of Beth and I stood up.\n\n\"Okay, have a good day at school.\" I said and he hugged me tightly while I gave him a kiss on the top of his head.\n\nLaura appeared beside him once we broke apart but when I tried to give her a hug she stepped back.\n\n\"Bye mom, see you later.\" Laura tried to walk out the door to follow Tommy but I used my powers to close it in her face.\n\n\"Laura Logan Howlett, come give your mother a hug.\" I demanded, speaking her full name and she groaned but turned to hug me nonetheless.\n\nThe hug was short but tight as I whispered a 'love you' in her ear and she repeated it back to me. I smiled and let her go, not stopping her this time and turned to Erik.\n\n\"See you later Erik.\" I said shortly.\n\nErik nodded and also left, closing the door behind him.\n\n\"Annoying.\" was all I could say as I retreated back to my own room to get ready for a day of working on the farm.\n\nI had a list of things I needed to get done but most importantly I needed to fix the exhaust on the pick up and give it an oil change. It was winter now so using the motorcycle Tony gave me would be not the smartest but also wouldn't really matter considering I couldn't die. Still reckless though so I voted against it. We were also running low on firewood I noticed as I walked by the fireplace in the living room. One more thing to add to the list.\n\nI threw on a pair of gloves and my heavy flannel and stepped outside to begin work. I walked over to the little golf cart I recently bought because getting around this land was exhausting since it was acres long and wide, I couldn't believe the help back then just did this every day of their lives, it made me appreciate them more even a hundred years later.\n\nI drove the golf cart over to the shed where the pick up was sitting and entered while removing my flannel and gloves in the process. It wasn't necessary to wear them when the shed was already hot as hell to begin with.\n\nI opened up the hatch of the truck and began my work starting from underneath it. I laid on the cool ground with my tools beside me and got lost in it. I forgot I could be in here for hours and not even notice, I just found fixing cars and mechanical parts to be relaxing so whenever our tractor was on the fritz or even something like Laura's boombox was being wonky I internally cheered at the challenge of fixing it. It reminded me of the days with Tony in the lab except not as high stakes. Well actually, an angry Laura could rain hellfire on this town so I liked to think fixing her boombox was sparing lives.\n\nI didn't realise how long I had been working until I heard footsteps and a heartbeat approaching the shed. I recognized them immediately and smiled to myself but my smile disappeared when I realised the only reason why she was coming in here was because it was late and I shurked my other chores. Dammit.\n\n\"Julia.\" I heard her stern voice and squeezed my eyes shut at the tone.\n\n\"Yes, dear.\" I said lovingly as I stood up from underneath the truck. I knew I was covered in grease and other fluids from the truck so I didn't look very appealing but I tried my best to give her my signature smirk when I caught her eyes lingering a little too long on my tanktop and jeans only body.\n\n\"Eyes are up here, Nat.\" I called her out and she instantly flipped me off.\n\n\"Not my fault you work half naked.\" I rolled my eyes.\n\n\"Anyway, dinner is ready and you still need to chop firewood and shower before it so should I save you a plate or you gonna come join us and chop firewood after.\" I groaned internally because I hated doing anything after dinner once I was cosy and inside with my family but I also didn't want to miss dinner with them either.\n\n\"I guess after.\" I whined a little and it was Natasha's turn to give me an eyeroll.\n\n\"For someone who's nearly 200 years old, you are very much a baby.\" she smirked at me and came a little closer.\n\nI took the opportunity to grab her by the waist and hug her tight to me which she hated since I was dirty.\n\n\"Julia!\" Natasha groaned when I started peppering her face with kisses.\n\nI finally loosened my grip on her but she didn't move away in the slightest instead she stayed right where she was and looked up into my eyes.\n\n\"You're so lucky I love you.\" I nodded.\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"And you're also lucky you look really fucking good right now.\" Natasha bit her lip and in that instant I knew exactly what her intentions were.\n\nI smirked as I leaned even closer to her and she inched up. I didn't need anymore permission so I pressed my lips to hers rather aggressively and the hunger pooling at the bottom of my stomach was more intense than necessary. It had been a long time since we had sex now that I think of it, which only made me want Natasha more in this moment.\n\nI pushed us backwards until Natasha's back hit the table and I lifted her up onto it. My lips went to her neck as I felt Natasha ripping my tank top from the back and clutching onto the bare skin which drove me absolutely nuts. Natasha knew exactly what she was doing. I reached for her jacket and practically ripped it off her body and then went for the shirt all in just two motions.\n\nNatasha was now in her bra in front of me and I went to remove that as well. As soon as she was completely topless I went back to paying attention to her neck and all the way down to her chest.\n\nThe moaning filling the shed was loud but it was okay to be loud here, the shed was yards away from the house and we could never have loud sex anymore so when Natasha started raising the tone of her moans there was no way I was going to stop her.\n\n\"Jesus christ Julia, get rid of my pants.\" Natasha groaned in my ear and dug her nails into my back. I knew she had drawn blood and I absolutely loved it.\n\nI went for the button on her jeans and in the heat of the moment I broke it, along with the zipper but I wasn't sorry, not even slightly. I pulled both her underwear and jeans off at the same time because I didn't want to waste anymore time.\n\nI laid her down on the table and hopped up on it as well to situate myself between her legs. The smirk on Natasha's face was growing impatient but I loved to tease her so I kissed her chest again and trailed down her stomach and felt her abs clench underneath my lips. I was dying to taste her just as badly as she wanted to feel me.\n\n\"Julia if you don't fuck me right now-\" I cut her off with my tongue slipping into her and wrapping itself around her most sensitive part.\n\n\"Fuck.\" Natasha whispered out of breath and intertwined her fingers in my hair pushing my head farther in between her legs.\n\nNatasha's onslaught of swear words was accompanied by a very loud moan as her thighs tightened around my head and the orgasm ripped through her body after only a few thrusts of my tongue. I guess she had been craving it just as badly as I was.\n\n\"I missed that, I missed you.\" Natasha said as she pulled my head up from in between her legs and I immediately kissed her with enough passion to convey how much I loved pleasing her, how much I love her.\n\nAs much as I wanted to lay with Natasha on top of the workbench forever I knew our 14 year old children would eventually come looking for us so I sighed deeply and peeled myself away from my beautiful wife. Natasha sighed as well knowing full well why I got up and she did too while adjusting herself to make it seem like we didn't just have a quickie in the tool shed.\n\n\"Gotta love being parents.\" Natasha said sarcastically, I laughed because I knew how much she actually loved it mostly because she believed she would never have it.\n\n\"I know you do, sweetheart.\" I kissed the side of her head and pulled back on my heavy flannel.\n\nNatasha rolled her eyes and I grabbed her hand as we made our way to the golf cart so I could drive us back to the house. When we got to the cart I tried to pull my hand away but Natasha just pulled it towards her and wrapped herself around my body. I gave into the hug immediately and kissed the top of her head. I knew she missed being intimate with me, I missed it too, with Laura and Tommy it was difficult to find moments but we managed the best we could.\n\n\"YA lyublyu tebya Natal'ya (I love you Natalia)\" I whispered in Russian and I felt the woman smile against my chest.\n\n\"Ya tozhe tebya lyublyu (I love you too)\" I smiled back at her response.\n\n\"C'mon, we got hungry children to feed.\" Natasha pulled away from me and we got inside the golf cart.\n\nAs soon as we pulled up in front of the house I could hear my two teenagers arguing, I blamed the super hearing most times but judging from the look on Natasha's face she could hear them too. I internally groaned once I entered the house and heard the yells loud and clear.\n\n\"Hey, hey!\" I raised my voice a little to get the twins' attention and they immediately stopped arguing.\n\n\"Tommy, speak, explain.\" I pointed to the boy and Laura's eyeroll didn't go unnoticed.\n\n\"Of course you take Tommy's side. Typical.\" Laura muttered under her breath like I couldn't hear.\n\n\"You'll have your chance to speak Laura, no one is taking sides.\" Laura's face turned solemn as she realised I heard her.\n\n\"I just wanted to talk to her about Grandpa's lecture today and she got all defensive about it.\" Tommy explained. School? They were arguing about school? God these children were not mine.\n\n\"Okay, what was the lecture about?\" I asked carefully.\n\n\"It was about mutantkind and how we should be proud to call ourselves that and it was a good lecture but the whole time Laura was rolling her eyes and I just wanted to know what was wrong.\" Tommy finished and I turned to look at Laura with a confused expression.\n\n\"What's going on Laur?\" I asked my daughter and her stone cold expression turned to a soft one.\n\n\"I just don't like being called that.\" I gave her a sympathetic look as I pulled a chair out to sit in front of her.\n\n\"Nat, Tom, give Laura and I a minute. We'll meet you in the kitchen for dinner.\" I turned to my wife and son and they both nodded.\n\nTommy turned immediately to the kitchen but Natasha came up to Laura and I and gave Laura a soft kiss on the head before retreating to the kitchen herself. Natasha's action softened the teenage girl up even more and I noticed slight tears in her eyes. This subject was really touchy for her.\n\n\"Come here, tell me what's up?\" I asked gently again while reaching my hands out to grab hers.\n\n\"I just don't like the term mutant, it makes me feel like a freak.\" Laura explained her reasoning for her outburst at her brother and I nodded in understanding.\n\n\"I get it, I don't identify with the term either, I consider myself a superhuman, enhanced, did a mutant gene create me? Absolutely, but that doesn't have to be our defining term.\"\n\n\"I know, but everyone at that school identifies with the mutant term and I don't, it just makes me feel out of place.\" I nodded as I caressed her much smaller hand in mind in an attempt to comfort her and it seemed to have been working as she looked down at our conjoined hands.\n\n\"You don't have to be just like everyone, Laur, you can be just you and you are pretty freaking spectacular.\" I said with a laugh and Laura laughed when I booped her nose.\n\n\"Yeah cause I'm just like you.\" I shook my head.\n\n\"You're better, so much better Laur, you have no idea what your life is going to unfold. You're going to be so incredible everything I ever did will look like peanuts.\"\n\n\"You saved the universe, twice. Within 2 years between each incident mom, there's no way I would ever be able to do that.\" Laura smirked at me as she sung my praises but I still shook my head.\n\n\"The world will always need saving Laura, if you choose to be the one that saves it then so be it but whatever you do, you'll always be better, you won't ever fall into the mess I did when your mother died. You will never have to know that pain and you'll be better for it.\" I explained to her and Laura nodded.\n\n\"I wanna be like you, mom. I wanna be an Avenger, I wanna save the world just like you. I wanna be a hero for little girls to look up to just like how everyone at school does to you.\" I gave her a curious look, I didn't know the kids at her school looked up to me. I felt touched but I also knew what a burden that could be for my kids.\n\n\"Then you will be my sweet girl, you'll be everything you ever want to be. Which includes not being a mutant.\" I said with a laugh and she laughed too.\n\n\"C'mon, let's not keep your mom and Tommy waiting, they're probably starving.\" I said, gesturing for Laura to follow me to the kitchen.\n\n\"Tommy is always hungry.\" Laura scoffed.\n\nI walked into the kitchen with Laura in tow and the rest of dinner went normally. Tommy and Laura both apologised to each other and told Natasha and I about their day at school. It was as normal as it could be with 3 superhuman's and a deadly assassin being a family but it was the most loving family I've ever been a part of, including the Avengers.\n\nOnce dinner was finished and the twins began the dishes I went into the living room to sit with my wife but as soon as I tried she shook her head.\n\n\"No, no, you promised.\" she said, never looking up from her book and I groaned.\n\n\"But, I wanna sit with you.\" I pouted but Natasha still didn't look up once but I could see the disapproving look resting on her features.\n\n\"You shurked your chores all day to work on that truck, go chop up firewood or you won't get anything for a very long time.\" Natasha emphasised 'anything' and I knew exactly what she meant. Screw my insatiable sex drive, once I got a taste of it I instantly wanted more which is what I planned on tonight and she knew damn well. Natasha Romanoff was too smart for her own good, I swear.\n\n\"Fine, but this is extortion.\" I left the living room once Natasha started laughing and made my way to the hall to grab my flannel.\n\n\"I'll be back kids, gonna get some firewood.\" I called to the twins in the kitchen and they groaned in response.\n\nI exited the house and went straight for the barn. Once I got inside I took the flannel off and grabbed my axe to begin chopping. I groaned loudly to myself as I placed a log on top of the bench. I started chopping, trying to get it done as quickly as possible because it was cold and I wanted to spend some more time with the twins before they had to go to bed. I looked down at my watch after I chopped a couple of logs and sighed, at this rate I wasn't going to make it.\n\nSomeone's here\n\nI perked my hearing up as soon as the phoenix force made itself known and I instantly picked up two heartbeats. I put the axe down and looked around, no one was in sight but I could feel their presence.\n\n\"You might want to come out because if I find you, it won't end well.\" I called out into the barn.\n\n\"Hey, hey, no need to get testy, it's just me.\" I heard Tony's voice as he stepped out of the shadows and my grimace turned into a grin real fast.\n\n\"Tony, what the hell? Why didn't you tell me you were coming up?\" I asked as I approached him.\n\n\"It was a matter of secrecy and I hate to do this to you but this was the safest place I could find.\" Tony explained as he gestured for someone else to come out of the shadows and I was confused when Peter walked into my sightline.\n\n\"Hi. Mrs. Romanoff-Howlett.\" Peter said awkwardly and I put my hand up.\n\n\"Please, call me Julia.\" Peter nodded and I turned back to Tony for an explanation.\n\n\"The kid is in a little bit of a pickle, he somehow got his identity leaked to the world and he needs a place to lay low, I was hoping that you could...\" Tony trailed off waiting for me to say something. I rolled my eyes and nodded.\n\n\"Yeah, fine, that's fine. Peter can stay here.\" Peter's face lit up with relief.\n\n\"Thank you so much Mrs- I mean Julia. I promise I'll be the best houseguest.\" I nodded telling the kid not to worry about it.\n\n\"Peter, why don't you go inside and explain to Natasha your situation, I need a word with Tony.\" I said and Peter nodded as he scurried away.\n\n\"Tony, what are you getting me involved with here?\"\n\n\"Nothing! I swear, the kid just needs a place to lay low and this is the most laying of the low I could think of. Middle of nowhere, your superpowered family, the kid is as safe as he can get with you.\" Tony explained and he did have a valid point.\n\n\"How did his identity get leaked?\"\n\n\"Bad guy he took out made a recording before he died, revealed Peter to be Spider-Man, it's been a whirlwind for him. The only way he can stay safe is if he just disappears for a while.\" Tony continued but something didn't make sense to me.\n\n\"The kid is just, okay with that? Doesn't sound like him.\"\n\n\"Well, he wants to keep his friends and family safe so if he has to disappear for a while then so be it, he's protective.\" Tony shrugged.\n\n\"Kid's got heart, that's for sure.\" I turned to the door where Peter had walked out of and sighed.\n\n\"I'll make sure he stays safe.\" I said and Tony sighed in relief.\n\n\"Thank you, I appreciate it and so does the kid.\" I nodded.\n\n\"Of course, as long as this doesn't bring hell onto my doorstep. I meant it when I said I was out of the game, I'm retired. Don't make me come out of it.\" I said sternly and Tony nodded this time.\n\n\"I can't make promises I don't know if I can keep but I also know who you are and there's no way you would stand down from a fight if it meant protecting the people you love.\" Tony patted the flannel I was wearing and I sighed, he had a point.\n\n\"Don't use that to your advantage Tony, I love you and Sam but I cannot get back into it, I have a family now. The stakes are different. They will always come first.\" I finished and Tony nodded again.\n\n\"Got you, crystal clear.\"\n\n\"It was good to see you Tony.\" I said as he approached the doors to the barn so he could exit.\n\n\"It's good to see you too, kid, don't be a stranger, I miss you.\" I knew that was a very uncharacteristically kind thing for Tony to say but I knew he meant it.\n\nI watched Tony leave the barn and a small part of me ached a little. I loved being an Avenger, I could do it for the rest of my life but I have a family to worry about now and I know damn well Natasha is done with all of that. Doing this small favour for Tony would be the last of it, I hoped.\n\n\"I miss you too.\"\n\nA/N: Get ready for this emotional blender"
