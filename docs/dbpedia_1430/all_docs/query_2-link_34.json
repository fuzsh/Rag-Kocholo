        "text": "This article is about a Ranger in Power Rangers Time Force.\n\nEric Myers is the Time Force Quantum Ranger. Although he identifies with the Time Force Rangers and served as their Sixth Ranger.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPast[]\n\nEric Myers was raised in a poor family where he had to fight for everything and became resentful of those born with a silver spoon in their mouth. An unknown number of years ago, Eric attended a prep school where he met Wesley \"Wes\" Collins the son of the billionaire Albert Collins. They spent an unknown amount of time together there but Eric eventually stormed out and left the school because it was full of \"lazy rich kids wasting their time\" and he had bigger plans. Sometime later, he was able to join the Silver Guardians as a soldier.\n\nTime Force[]\n\nEric is first seen when the Silver Guardians are hired by Mr. Collins to defend Silver Hills and they foil a jewelry store heist by Nadira and the Cyclobots. He then meets Wes again but acts overly cold and disinterested to him, assuming that he's out with his friends wasting their wealth before leaving. TV STORY-Worlds Apart\n\nAfter discovering that Wes is the Red Time Force Ranger, Eric attempts to find his own powers and becomes aware that the Time Force Rangers are looking for the Quantum powers and he gets to it first and forcibly becomes the Quantum Ranger much to the displeasure of Wes' teammates. Eric is able to defeat Brickneck but is unable to earn him the leadership of the Silver Guardians as Mr. Collins is unimpressed. TV STORY-The Quantum Quest\n\nEric is able to win the position of Silver Guardian Commander by gaining control of the Quantasaurus Rex which manages to win Mr. Collins' favor and finally becomes the leader of the Guardians. Mr. Collins offers Jen, Lucas, Trip and Katie to join the Silver Guardians and unite the Rangers and Silver Guardians teams with Eric as their leader but the Rangers refuse due to his questionable motives. TV STORY-Clash for Control\n\nEric becomes a reluctant ally to the regular Rangers, remaining separate and occasionally aiding them at certain times in the interests of the city although his cold attitude remains.\n\nAfter being abducted by the mutant Conwing, Eric learned that Wes' teammates came from the year 3000, something that he later reveals to Jen, and despite rejecting her request of not revealing her friends' secret to anyone, Eric eventually decided to keep their secret from Mr. Collins. TV STORY-Quantum Secrets\n\nWhen Mr. Collins was injured and hospitalized by Ransik, Eric informed Wes about his father's condition. But soon got upset when he learned that Wes would take over Bio-Lab in his father's absence and not wanting to work for his rival, Eric resigns his position and tries to leave Silver Hills, leaving his birds in the care of his young friend and neighbor Alice. But while leaving the city, Eric sees the other Rangers in their Zords fighting against Dragontron and joins the fight. After defeating Frax's Zord, Eric retakes his position in the Silver Guardians and offers to drive Wes to the hospital to see his father, which Wes agreed to. TV STORY-Destiny Defeated\n\nWhen Ransik and Frax launch their final attack on the city, Doomtron emerges and opens timeholes to destroy the city. Once the Silver Guardians arrive, they evacuate the city as Eric morphs into the Quantum Ranger and summons the Q-Rex but Doomtron easily defeats it with overwhelming firepower. Before the battle can continue for long however, the Time Force Rangers stop Eric from fighting because the Trizyrium Crystals are making the wormholes grow and the different sets being in such close proximity to each other is just exasperating the problem. However, Eric refuses which results in much of Silver Hills being sucked into the time-holes and erased from existence. Desperate, Wes sends the other Time Force Rangers back to 3000 so that they're safe whilst he and Eric remain to defend the city.\n\nThat night, the timeholes have combined into one gigantic vortex even as people rally to the local hospital as a safehaven. However, as Eric and Wes contemplate having sent back the other Rangers later the same night, Ransik finds out where they are based thanks to a patrolling Cyclobot. He then launches an all-out assault on the Clock Tower with an army of Cyclobots to flush out and destroy the two. Although the two fight bravely, they are easily overrun and are forced to destroy the building with the Electro Booster and escape on the Strata Cycle and TF Eagle. By the next morning, Doomtron returns and an army of Cyclobots invade the now completely deserted city to find and kill Wes and Eric. The two engage a group to rescue Mr. Collins but Eric is badly wounded when he shields Mr. Collins and Wes from a stray surviving Cyclobot so he hands over the Quantum Morpher so that Wes can use the Q-Rex. After Ransik surrenders and the Rangers depart for the future, Mr. Collins offers Wes command of the Silver Guardians who will now protect the city from evil for free and Wes accepts on the condition that a surprised Eric be his partner. TV STORY-The End of Time\n\nWild Force[]\n\nMeeting the Wild Force Rangers[]\n\nWes and Eric have become best friends during their duty as Silver Guardians, he is seen giving Taylor Earhardt a ticket for speeding a car. After writing her up, Eric and Wes talked about Taylor being the type of troubled girl.\n\nThe next morning, Eric, Wes, and the Silver Guardians receive a disturbance call from Cranston Plaza. The three monsters are attacking a city, the Silver Guardians arrive and Wes and Eric order them to surrender. The monsters attack them with energy beams. Wes and Eric morph and they both battle against these unknown creatures in their Ranger forms, but are easily defeated. Eric thought that all the Mutants are captured and they were sent back to the future, but before the unknown creatures can finish them off, the Wild Force Rangers arrive. However, the mysterious creatures escaped. Eric takes a hostile tone with the Wild Force group and is recognized by Taylor as the police officer that gave her a ticket and is scolded by her. He and Wes thinks the monsters are Mutants, while the Wild Force Rangers think they're Orgs. Wes shakes Cole's hand and rallies the Silver Guardians to leave.\n\nEric and Wes confused by the word Orgs by part of the Wild Force Rangers, they decided to contact Trip from the future, aware that the mysterious creatures are fugitives from the year 3001 and the strange disappearance of Jen who they lost contact for two weeks.\n\nWes and Eric track down Taylor to ask for Wild Force's help in stopping the creatures they believe are Mutants. Taylor after correcting them that they are really Orgs agrees to help and takes them to the Animarium meeting Princess Shayla. Wes and the other Rangers are informed by a call back from Trip, who says that these mysterious monsters are called Mut-Orgs that are half Mutant, half Org. Eric and Taylor are still making jabs at each other.\n\nThe Mut-Orgs attack again, and the Wild Force Rangers with Wes and Eric fight them in a quarry. The Mut-Orgs resist their attacks and pummel them. Wes is injured enough to force a demorph, but when a Mut-Org is about to finish him, it is stopped by some blaster shots from high up. It turns out to be Jen in a cloak, armed with a special gun that can hit the Mut-Orgs. She helps the Rangers get away. TV STORY-Reinforcements from the Future, Pt. 1\n\nTeaming up with the Wild Force Rangers[]\n\nThe Rangers return to the Animarium, discouraged. Circuit contacts them and says that reinforcements are on the way in the Time Ship. The rest of the Rangers see the Time Ship on the beach. The Time Force Rangers have a reunion after much time until Ransik and Nadira appears.\n\nIn the Animarium, Eric like the other Rangers found out that Ransik created the Mut-Orgs. After that, when the Time Force Rangers spend the night on the Animarium.\n\nDuring this time, he developed a love-hate relationship with Taylor Earhardt resulting that they will get to know a little more. Eric and Taylor have a civil conversation about the Quantum Defender and gain some mutual respect.\n\nThe next day, Eric along with the other Time Force Rangers, Wild Force Rangers, Nadira and Ransik go to the power plant and divide into groups.\n\nEric goes with Taylor and Katie in the reactor room, where they fight the Putrids to give Trip time to shut down the reactor. He allowed Taylor to use his Quantum Defender and destroy the reactor.\n\nThe Mut-Orgs without the mutant powers try to run, only to be stopped by Merrick. Soon, all the Rangers gather to face the Mut-Orgs, morph into their Ranger forms.\n\nEric and Merrick Baliton the Lunar Wolf Wild Force Ranger in their Ranger forms, defeated a Putrid Army.\n\nThe other Time Force Rangers and Wild Force Rangers are regrouped by Eric while he's using his Quantum Megabattle Armor, while Wes and Cole uses their Battle Warrior Armor and Animarium Armor respectfully, attacking with the Chrono Blasters and Crystal Sabers that finally destroy the Mut-Orgs.\n\nWith the battle now won, the Rangers rush back to Ransik and Nadira, Eric liked the other Rangers witness Ransik's redemption and has also turned him fully human. They all return to the Animarium for a picnic in celebration.

Johnson and Tommy. Jason Lee Scott, the original Red Ranger pulls up to the group on a motorcycle.\n\nEric and the other Red Rangers aboard the Astro Megaship Mark II. During their travel to the Moon, he's listening to the plans of the Machine Empire and the Evil Zord Serpentera.\n\nOn the Moon, General Venjix and his other generals prepare to board Serpentera but they are then interrupted by the Red Rangers. Venjix sends Cogs to distract the eight Rangers while he and the others proceed to Serpentera. Eric do battle with the Cogs unmorphed and dispose of them with relative ease.\n\nCole is rescued by Leo Corbett and Aurico on Leo's Jet Jammer, Venjix and the other Generals then arrive and are shocked to see ten Red Rangers before them. All of the Rangers then morph with their respective calls (except Aurico, who never appears demorphed) and do battle with the Generals in groups of two.\n\nEric and Aurico fight Tezzla on a hill and destroy her with Eric's Quantum Defender.\n\nWith no time to get to the Megaship before Serpentera takes off, Eric and the other Red Rangers rely on Cole with his Wild Force Rider to battle Venjix. Both Venjix and Serpentera are destroyed for good, truly ending the Machine Empire menace once and for all.\n\nAfterwards, the nine human Rangers part ways, and Cole remarks how Tommy appeared to be the \"greatest Ranger ever\" with the other Rangers bragging of their exploits, during which he jokingly bemoaned the fact that his Q-Rex could easily defeat his Dragonzord. TV STORY-Forever Red\n\nDino Thunder[]\n\nEric is featured in a chronicle of Power Ranger history compiled by Tommy shortly after he forms the Dino Rangers, which is found by the nascent Ranger team in the Dino Lab.

TV STORY-Morphin Master\n\nPersonality[]\n\nWhen he was first introduced, Eric was extremely bitter and jaded and wanted to top Wes because of their different backgrounds, which is quite odd as Wes showed he wanted nothing more than to be genuine friends with him, despite their backgrounds; Wes turned down a party with a rich kid, wanting to hang out with Eric instead. As Eric put it from his point of view \"[Wes] has all the money and connections; he just didn't know how to use them.\" It's likely that Eric was annoyed with Wes's laid back attitude, as he effectively treated everything, mainly school and life, like it wasn't a big deal, a luxury his wealth afforded him while Eric had to work extremely hard to reach a similar position.\n\nSince then though, Eric has warmed up to being with the Time Force Rangers. By the end of the series, he was not bitter toward Wes for taking over his position as leader of the Silver Guardians and they have become real, genuine friends from their time as partners. When teaming up with the Wild Force Rangers, Eric let it slip that he considers the Time Force Rangers his friends when sympathizing with Taylor Earhardt, who complains her friends driver her crazy by saying he felt the same way about the Time Force Rangers before embarrassingly walking away from his slip.\n\nQuantum Ranger[]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nAllies[]\n\nRangers[]\n\nTime Force Rangers - Teammates\n\nWesley Collins/Time Force Red (II) - Best Friend\n\nKatie Walker/Time Force Yellow\n\nLucas Kendall/Time Force Blue\n\nTrip/Time Force Green\n\nJen Scotts/Time Force Pink - Leader\n\nLightspeed Rangers\n\nCarter Grayson/Red Lightspeed Ranger\n\nChad Lee/Blue Lightspeed Ranger\n\nJoel Rawlings/Green Lightspeed Ranger\n\nKelsey Winslow/Yellow Lightspeed Ranger\n\nDana Mitchell/Pink Lightspeed Ranger\n\nRyan Mitchell/Titanium Ranger\n\nWild Force Rangers\n\nCole Evans/Red Wild Force Ranger\n\nTaylor Earhardt/Yellow Wild Force Ranger - Love Interest\n\nMax Cooper/Blue Wild Force Ranger\n\nDanny Delgado/Black Wild Force Ranger\n\nAlyssa Enrilé/White Wild Force Ranger\n\nMerrick Baliton/Lunar Wolf Ranger\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers\n\nJason Lee Scott/Mighty Morphin Red Ranger (I)\n\nAquitar Rangers\n\nAurico/Red Aquitar Ranger\n\nZeo Rangers\n\nTommy Oliver/Zeo Ranger V - Red\n\nTurbo Rangers\n\nT.J.
