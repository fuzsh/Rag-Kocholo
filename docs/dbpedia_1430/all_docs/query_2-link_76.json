        "meta_description": "S3E21 - For the Glory KC is back with the 86th episode of the show!Â \nSporting Kansas City have extended their losing streak to five games. But before we get to the bad results, they did have a good result this week. They did what a Major League Soccer team should have done and downed FC Tulsa, a second division foe, 4-0 in the US Open Cup. That sets Sporting KC up to play FC Dallas in the quarterfinal where they only need three more wins to lift a trophy in an otherwise abysmal year.\nWhile Sheena sneaks some negativity in that Open Cup conversation, we do eventually switch gears to talk about the 2-1 loss to the Portland Timbers on the road. The \"starters\" were all back except Remi Walter, who was replaced by the goal scorer Memo Rodriguez. The game went poor from a chance creation perspective, results perspective, and an injury perspective.\nErik Thommy appeared to pull his hamstring and had to sub out early and then Memo Rodriguez picked up a suspension for yellow card accumulation. That led to a conversation of what the midfield could possibly look like against the Vancouver Whitecaps on Wednesday. I think it's time for an SKC II loan over playing someone out of position.\nThe Kansas City Current did what they often do and kept winning! This time in the first ever meeting against the Utah Royals. Despite the win, it wasn't all good news as Gabby Robinson went down with an injury and we fear the worst.\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the surprise resignation of General Manager Camille Ashton from the KC Current.\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\n Gianluca Busio on the verge of Serie A again\n KC Current haveÂ so many international call ups\n  SKC Academy have a couple as well\n  And a clarification on pay \"raises and cuts\"\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\n  Sporting KC advance in the Open Cup - 7:23\n  But lose their 5th straight in MLS play - 24:16\n  Clarification on a new MLS rule - 53:43\n  KC Current win! - 55:01\n  Camille Ashton resigns - 1:02:32\n  Digital Crawl - 1:06:41\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\n  Sporting KC vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Wednesday, May 29th @ 7:30 PM CDT\n  USWNT vs. South Korea, Saturday, June 1st @ 4:00 PM (TNT/Max/Peacock)\n  Sporting KC at Minnesota United, Saturday, June 1st @ 7:30 PM\n  SKC II at MNUFC 2, Sunday, June 2nd @ 6:00 PM\n  The KC Current are off for the international break\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

        "text": "S3E32 - For the Glory KC is back with the 97th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City pulled off a great win when they returned to MLS play on Saturday. They won 3-0 over Orlando City which will serve as a nice tune-up for the do-or-die game against Indy Eleven on Tuesday in the US Open Cup semifinals.\n\nWe break down the unique lineup, that included Zoran Bassong in the midfield. Also, the top moments from the game including the goals and the other performances that stood out to us.\n\nThen we get to the rumor of the week that Kayden Pierre was being sold to Belgian club, Genk. A rumor, later confirmed by Peter Vermes. Is Mike Burns responsible for the first sale since Gianluca Busio? We talk through what this means for youth development, how the transfer fees come back into the system to help Sporting KC and more.\n\nUnfortunately, when one KC teams wins, apparently the other one isn't allowed to. The KC Current fell to the Washington Spirit earlier today in a crushing 4-1 result on the road. Kansas City remain on the road to face the North Carolina Courage next weekend, who are suddenly nipping on their heels as KC slipped from 1st to 3rd in the standings in back-to-back NWSL games. What went wrong? We give our theories.\n\nIn more mixed Current news, the teams moved on from Alexa Spaanstra and Lauren this week but signed Hildah Magaia to offset some of that movement. Jereko also made her debut against Washington, but it wasn't with enough time left to change the game.\n\nAnd in possibly the biggest soccer news of the week, the NWSL and NWSLPA reached a new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) through 2030 that includes elimination of all drafts (college and expansion), free agency for all, players ability to veto trades and a whole lot more.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on a few topics, including:\n\nSKC II results\n\nThe Women's Cup teams\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nA Fun Benny Feilhaber Story (and some nonsense) - 1:52\n\nSporting KC Win! - 11:15\n\nKayden Pierre Sold - 38:55\n\nKC Current lose - 51:14\n\nThree more KC Current moves - 59:44\n\nHistoric NWSL CBA - 1:08:09\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:21:10\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC vs. Indy Eleven (US Open Cup), Tuesday, August 27th @ 7:00PM\n\nSKC II at Vancouver Whitecaps 2, Saturday, August 31st @ 6:00PM\n\nKC Current at North Carolina Courage, Sunday, September 1st @ 1:00PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

Just follow this link!\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E31 - For the Glory KC is back with the 96th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City didn't lose this week. Of course, they didn't play either. However, they did make some news. They finally made a signing, basically their first \"big\" signing of the year. We technically don't know how much new center back Joaquin Fernandez is making, but I'd guess he's on a Targeted Allocation Money (TAM) deal which is more than the four minimum contract guys that were signed in the offseason. It may be less, but it won't be the minimum.\n\nAfter making guesses how Joaquin will fit in, Sheena and I took a listener question and basically did an entire podcast about it. If we didn't have to follow any roster rules and could ignore contract lengths, who would we actually keep on this team?\n\nWe didn't go through every single player on the roster, but we hit the vast majority of it. There were definitely a few surprised decisions and a few super on brand for us.\n\nIt's an interesting exercise because it reminds you it's hard to let go. There are only four players fully out of contract after the season and there was an argument to keep all but one of them in some capacity (though I personally took a harder stance).\n\nThen most of the players that Sheena and I agreed we should move on from if the roster rules and contracts didn't apply, aren't out of contract and can't really be moved on from at all without a trade, transfer or the use of the single buyout. In other words, the 2025 edition of Sporting KC will probably look a lot like the 2024 version. It's important the changes that are made, are done to perfection.\n\nThe rebuild for Sporting KC may be long and hard.\n\nThankfully, we have the KC Current to lift us up in these dire times. They played in The Women's Cup this week and won the whole dang thing, lifting the first trophy in club history. Shame so little of you saw it, unless you happened to own a Vizio TV. Seriously, the channel was only available on a specific brand of TV in the United States. Wild choice by the organizers of this competition.\n\nIn addition to the two wins, we give the tiniest insights on new KC Current signing Jereko and where she may fit in.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on a few topics, including:\n\nFIFA Fan Fest coming to KC in 2026\n\nSporting KC's Academy rankings (eek!)\n\nA few KC Current transactions\n\nAnd potential new USMNT coach, Mauricio Pochettino\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC finally make a signing - 5:29\n\nNo rules Sporting KC fantasy GM - 20:59\n\nKC Current win two more! - 1:11:29\n\nKC Current make another signing - 1:24:46\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:27:21\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSKC II vs. Austin FC II, Sunday, August 18th @ 6:00PM\n\nSporting KC vs. Orlando City, Saturday, August 24th @ 7:30PM\n\nKC Current AT Washington Spirit, Sunday, August 25th @ 11:00AM\n\nSKC II have next weekend off\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

First, there was a competitive game against Toluca FC that featured a beautiful Stephen Afrifa goal, only to come up short. But SKC won the expected goals (xG) battle and showed some promise.\n\nThen Vermes benched Willy Agada and went back to Alan Pulido and the team had an abysmal 4-0 loss against the Columbus Crew that only had an xG of 0.1 over the 90 minutes. The Crew are really good, but they made Sporting KC look even worse. And perhaps, SKC aided them in that. They kept it close for 44 minutes and then it went completely off the rails.\n\nOver the course of these two games, Sheena and I discuss some good news (returning injured players like Logan Ndenbe, Jake Davis and Dany Rosero) and a lot of bad news (Pulido playing the 10, Agada missing so many shots PV thought Pulido was the solution, etc.). In particular, we got to wondering if there is a starting center back among the five on the roster currently.\n\nRight now, the team has Andre Fontas, Robi Voloder, Robert Castellanos, Chris Rindov and Rosero. Of those, the team can literally move on from anyone but Rosero by simply letting their contract expire (Fontas) or not picking up their options (all the rest of them). So, what should they do? That part of the conversation picks up at 39:34 in the podcast.\n\n[Teaser for next week's pod: With no Sporting KC game, we're going to look at the whole roster and finally answer a prompt a fan asked us weeks ago about who we'd keep in a world without roster rules.]\n\nThe KC Current did what they do and won both of their games this past week. They won their group in the Summer Cup and then won their semifinal matchup against the North Carolina Courage to make it to the finals (which are in October for some reason).\n\nThen we got into the roster movement the Current went through in the last week. Claire Lavogez is gone (though nothing has been officially announced), as is backup goalkeeper Hope Hisey. Then the team brought in a 33-year-old GK in Almuth Schult. What does it mean for AD Franch and Jordan Silkowitz? We give our thoughts.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on a few topics, including:\n\nSKC II keep losing\n\nUSMNT eliminated at Olympics\n\nMy interview with Jake Reid\n\nA Sporting KC signing is coming\n\nCastellanos pronunciation\n\nAntoinne Griezmann isn't coming to KC\n\nLots of KC Current stories\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC lose twice - 7:51\n\nWho is Starter Quality of the SKC Center Backs? - 39:34\n\nKC Current win two more times - 50:30\n\nThree KC Current moves - 1:01:32\n\nUSWNT win the Olympics Gold - 1:13:00\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:30:04\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nNo Sporting KC games until August 24th (Orlando City)\n\nKC Current vs. Mamelodi Sundowns (Womenâs Cup) - Wednesday, August 14th @ 8:00PM CDT\n\nKC Current vs. either Atletico Madrid or Kobe (depending who wins/loses the first games)\n\nSKC II vs. Austin FC II, Sunday, August 18th @ 6:00PM (Rock Chalk Park)\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

They thoroughly controlled the game, and despite going down 1-0 early, fought back for a 2-1 victory. Superman made its way into the show twice this week, including Willy's form on the diving header and a weird discussion about what Peter Vermes has tattooed under his shirt. It was a little For the Glory KC #AfterDark, but the lite version.\n\nThe Chicago/Sporting KC game led to discussions about Stephen Afrifa starting to break out, how to pronounce Robert Castellanos (among other things about his goal), Remi Walter (and an over/under on how much he's discussed), and the four Sporting KC II loanees who are rostered for Leagues Cup. Sheena and I also had a debate about left back with Logan Ndenbe's return to the bench and who should still be around between him, Tim Leibold and Zorhan Bassong.\n\nRubiel Vazquez from PRO made back-to-back appearances as the center ref and made a few, slightly less impactful, bad calls this week. The Alenis Vargas no-call felt the most shocking due to the sound it made when he hit the end boards.\n\nMarinos Tzionis was also sold this past week and we give our thoughts on his relatively brief stint at Sporting KC.\n\nThe KC Current finally return to the podcast with their games and our recording schedule lining up. Breaking news: They are still really good at soccer, even shorthanded. They dominated Pachuca 3-0 and frankly could have scored more if they put their foot on the gas. That's despite missing Temwa Chawinga and nearly a dozen players total.\n\nAnd the KC Current surprised us again with another blockbuster trade, this time coming into KC, with Alana Cook coming to town from Seattle.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on a few topics, including:\n\nSKC II keep struggling\n\nThe USMNT and USWNT's Olympic performances\n\nAnd Canada cheating in a huge drone scandal\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC extinguish the Fire - 5:01\n\nMarinos Tzionis is gone - 38:09\n\nKC Current win again - 43:00\n\nCurrent trade for Alana Cook - 48:43\n\nDigital Crawl - 52:13\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nUSMNT U-23s vs. Guinea - Tuesday, July 30th @ 12:00pm CDT\n\nUSMNT U-20s vs. Guatemala - Tuesday, July 30th @ 4:06pm (CONCACAF Championship)\n\nUSWNT vs. Australia - Wednesday, July 31st @ 12:00pm\n\nKC Current vs. Tigres - Thursday, August 1st @ 7:00pm\n\nSKC II vs. VWFC 2 - Friday, August 2nd @ 7:00pm\n\nSporting KC vs. Toluca - Monday, August 5th @ 8:00pm\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

Five to be exact. And we just took off one week for our Canadian vacation! Sheena and I discuss our trip to the great white north, Banff, Vancouver, Albert, British Columbia and more.\n\nThen we get down to the soccer, starting with that 1-1 draw against rivals St. Louis City SC. To lead off the game, we had to discuss Thor getting away with a challenge that should have seen him sent off for a second yellow at the very least.\n\nBeyond the STL/SKC game, Sheena and I debated the future of Remi Walter with Sporting KC. His contract is up after the season, and he'll turn 30 early next year. With the emergence of Jake Davis in his natural midfield role, Memo Rodriguez being a stable backup, the impending signing of a TAM level midfielder and his $900,000 salary, does Remi still have a place on Sporting KC?\n\nIn addition to the St. Louis game, we talk about our experience seeing the Vancouver Whitecaps game in person. Plus, we breeze through the two FC Dallas games and the San Jose Earthquakes game, which were all victories, from while the podcast was on its break. Are we the reason for the losing?\n\nThen we had to talk about those sweet, sweet retro kits and accessories!\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on a few topics, including:\n\nUSMNT fire Gregg Berhalter\n\nKC Current sign and loan out a player\n\nSKC II results\n\nA new youngest player in MLS history debuts\n\nLots of United States youth National Team competition updates\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nWe went to Canada - 2:16\n\nSKC draw St. Louis - 10:45\n\nRemi's KC future - 22:54\n\nSKC lose to Vancouver in front of us - 46:11\n\nA bunch of other SKC games - 54:41\n\nInjury depletion and random midfield thoughts - 1:03:06\n\nRetro Kits - 1:13:17\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:22:55\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSKC II vs. St. Louis City II - Sunday, July 21st at 6:00 PM CDT\n\nUSMNT U-20s vs. Cuba - Monday, July 22nd at 9:00 PM\n\nUSMNT U-23s vs. France - Wednesday, July 24th at 2:00 PM\n\nUSWNT vs. Zambia - Thursday, July 25th at 2:00 PM\n\nUSMNT U-20s vs. Costa Rica, Thursday, July 25th at 9:00 PM\n\nUSMNT U-23s vs. New Zealand - Saturday, July 27th at 12:00 PM\n\nKC Current vs. Tigres - Saturday, July 27th at 7:00 PM (Summer Cup)\n\nSporting KC vs. Chicago Fire - Sunday, July 28th at 8:00 PM (Leagues Cup)\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

Primarily, this week's episode is focused on the off the field matters due to recording schedules. We're heading out of the country early in the week and may be taking a brief hiatus from podcasting, so be sure to subscribe to the podcast to catch when the next episode comes out.\n\nThis week, Sporting KC introduced Mike Burns as their new Sporting Director and he and Peter Vermes covered a lot of interesting topics at the introductory press conference. There were budgets (the largest ever), staffing updates, player signing plans and more.\n\nThen things got really interesting when Sam McDowell of the KC Star sat down with managing owner Mike Illig and Peter Vermes to get deeper into the weeds. He has a must-read article outlining the utter lack of a budget since 2020. It sheds a new light into who is to blame for how things have worked around Sporting KC the last couple years. Vermes isn't guilt free, but Sheena and I go over the ways things have been handled that were beyond Peter's control.\n\nI'm personally thankful for this ownership group rescuing the Kansas City Wizards and doing an amazing rebrand, building a soccer specific stadium and all the success they've brought over the years. But that story Vermes told about ownership passing on a DP striker in 2018 because they were already in first place, makes me think there would be a third star about the crest if things were handled differently.\n\nThe hope is, going forward, ownership gives the budget and gets out of the way and lets the soccer minds handle things. And if they are given a fair shot to fix some things they weren't given a fair shot at before, and they don't fix it, then ownership can step in and make a change.\n\nListen in for all the details and quotes.\n\nWe also briefly discuss Sporting KC's loss to the Colorado Rapids but move quickly to the Missouri side of the border to talk the Kansas City Current. Unfortunately, the losing on the Kansas side trickled over and the KC Current's unbeaten run came to a rather uninspiring end against the Orlando Pride. The fans in the stadium were lighting up the ref, but was it really the refs fault?\n\nPlus, a fun little Temwa Chawinga/Vlatko Andonovski story that is inspiring for KC's future.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, go quite a bit deeper than usual on a few topics, including:\n\nUSMNT bombing out of Copa America\n\nLogan Ndenbe injury update!\n\nSKC II results and an all-star call-up\n\nCPKC stadium hosting the NWSL Championship\n\nLots of little KC Current stories\n\nAnd Bradley Carnell is fired in St. Louis\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nKC Current Media Game - 2:18\n\nDoes Sporting KC have an ownership problem? - 8:29\n\nSKC lose to the Rapids in Colorado - 46:33\n\nKC Currentâs streak is over vs Orlando - 55:58\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:17:48\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC vs. FC Dallas - Sunday, July 7th @ 7:30 PM\n\nSKC II at Tacoma Defiance - Sunday, July 7th @ 9:00 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. FC Dallas (US Open Cup) - Wednesday, July 10th @ 8:00 PM\n\nSporting KC at San Jose Earthquakes - Saturday, July 13th @ 9:30 PM\n\nSKC II at The Town - Sunday, July 14th @ 7:00 PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

On Saturday night, they shut out Austin FC 2-0, just their second shutout in 21 tries this season. The victory was picked up by quality finishing and even better defense.\n\nIt also feels like someone over at Sporting KC in the technical staff may be listening to the podcast. Last week, we put out a loose plan for going forward in 2024. Stop playing guys that'll be gone after the year, unless you are trying to see if you need to bring them back. It wasn't perfect, as Andreu Fontas found the bench, but Johnny Russell and Tim Melia still started. Russell played lights out and Melia had very little to do since Austin only mustered two shots.\n\nSKC also played the midfield trio of Nemanja Radoja, Erik Thommy and Jake Davis, a group I've personally been clamoring to see together more. Davis did well to make up that ground coverage that Remi Walter supplies and a touch of physicality in the midfield this team doesn't have outside of Memo Rodriguez. The game also saw the return of Alan Pulido and Tim Leibold from injury, with Leibold scoring the game winner.\n\nWalter, Daniel Salloi and Robert Castellanos were all listed as questionable, but they all sat out the game.\n\nSpeaking of physicality, it reminds us immediately of the retirement of Roger Espinoza. He was honored before the game and spoke to the media at halftime and a little in the locker room.\n\nThe conversation wouldn't be complete without all the front office movement from the week. Brian Bliss is out, and Mike Burns is in, though not in exactly the same job. We'll have a better understanding of Burns' role after the Tuesday press conference as Peter Vermes asked we avoid asking about Burns in the post-game presser. Sheena and I give our initial impressions on the hiring and firing, knowing more information is coming down the line.\n\nThe Kansas City Current continue to set records and hold back the opposition. In the past week they went to the Portland Thorns and won 4-1 and then returned home for a 2-0 win over the Houston Dash. We share our thoughts on those games, Temwa Chawinga, the river 'goal' and so much more.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few other topics, including:\n\nTwo NWSL coaching firings, both with KC ties\n\nA Memo Rodriguez transfer rumor\n\nThe USMNT's up and down week at Copa America\n\nUSWNT Olympic Roster is out\n\nand Kamron Habibullah is midseason MLS Next Pro MVP\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC win! - 6:44\n\nSKC do some hiring and firing in the front office - 45:58\n\nKC Current win twice! - 1:14:15\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:31:18\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSKC II vs. Austin FC II - Sunday, June 30th @ 6:00 PM CDT\n\nUSMNT vs. Uruguay - Monday, July 1st @ 8:00 PM\n\nSporting KC at Colorado Rapids - Thursday, July 4th @ 8:30 PM\n\nKC Current vs. Orlando Pride - Saturday, July 6th @ 6:30 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. FC Dallas - Sunday, July 7th @ 7:30 PM\n\nSKC II at Tacoma Defiance - Sunday, July 7th @ 9:00 PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

Things get weird as we recorded waaay after dark.\n\nSporting Kansas City had another rough week. So much, that my co-host preferred we \"just get it over with\" on Saturday night versus waiting to do a podcast on Sunday. Despite that, we have a lot of thoughts about the losses to Real Salt Lake and the Columbus Crew. I'd like to think it was more about the catharsis of getting some of these thoughts out, while they are fresh in our minds. For a deeper tactical breakdown, check out the Home and Away podcast.\n\nAmazingly, it's not all bad. For years we've criticized when SKC just did the same thing over and over and expected different results. At least they tried some things.\n\nThere were massive lineup changes in both games including rolling out a 3-4-3/5-4-1 against the Crew. Andreu Fontas seemingly got benched (until an injury). Kayden Pierre made consecutive starts at right back (and may have broken a bone). Both goalkeepers got starts, allowed four goals, and stunningly were some of the better players in those games. Young players got extensive minutes at forward too.\n\nThis episode has some venting. It has some rants. It even has a bit of a plan for what we'd like to see from Sporting KC for the rest of 2024, since ownership made it clear Peter Vermes is safe.\n\nWe also had to learn a little bit about the Keepers of the Spoon. Sporting KC are dangerously close to the bottom of the table and fans will probably need to read up on how that Wooden Spoon 'trophy' works. Is it a trophy? Is there more than one of them? We have the answers, but until then, thankfully, the San Jose Earthquakes still exist.\n\nThe Kansas City Current have some nuggets, but we recorded before their game. Double coverage next week!\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few other topics, including:\n\nFailed Sporting KC transfer rumor\n\nSKC Injury Update\n\nKC Current Injury Update\n\nFailed KC Current transfer rumor\n\nSKC U-17s and MLS Next Cup\n\nKei Kamara breaking records\n\nAnd we snuck in this story\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC lose to RSL - 7:06\n\nWhat is the Wooden Spoon? - 28:42\n\nThen SKC lose to Columbus - 32:09\n\nMy first rant of the podcast - 41:36\n\nSecond rant of the podcast - 55:05\n\nA bit of a plan for the rest of 2024 - 1:08:27\n\nSheena wants you to boycott - 1:14:14\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:27:08\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nKC Current at Portland Thorns - Sunday, June 23rd @ 3:00 PM CDT\n\nUSMNT vs. Bolivia - Sunday, June 23rd @ 5:00 PM\n\nSporting KC II at St. Louis City II - Sunday, June 23rd @ 6:00 PM\n\nUSMNT vs. Panama - Thursday, June 27th @ 5:00 PM\n\nKC Current vs. Houston Dash - Friday, June 28th @ 7:00 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. Austin FC - Saturday, June 29th @ 7:30 PM\n\nSKC II vs. Austin FC II - Sunday, June 30th @ 6:00 PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

After a hopeful win at home against the Seattle Sounders, they dropped a result to the LA Galaxy 4-2 in California. There were some interesting lineup choices, lots of standing around on the first goal and lots of things to talk about that are pretty negative from the game.\n\nHowever, was there something to build on? The underlying numbers are actually not that bad. Sporting KC were creating chances, they just didn't finish them. That, sadly, feels like progress from all these games where it felt like they can't even get a decent shot off. The issue is, it's all too late as the season is in the back half and they just lost again.\n\nUnfortunately, we have to talk about the elephant in the room that is Felipe Hernandez. He was suspended for the second time for gambling related violations. It really feels like we'll never see Felipe in a Sporting KC uniform again. The question is, what sort of punishment is he in for? I'd assume he'll not be allowed to play in Major League Soccer, but how far or wide could a ban/suspension go?\n\nThen we talk about the Peter Vermes interview in the KC Star with Daniel Sperry about the upcoming transfer window. On the pod we try to look long-term since any move will come too late in the season if the team hasn't already gone on a great winning streak. Vermes mentions the need for an attacking midfielder, in somewhat of a contrast to what Mike Illig said last week about needing a winger and a central defender.\n\nThe Kansas City Current unfortunately couldn't carry Kansas City soccer this weekend settling for a 2-2 draw to the Chicago Red Stars. It led to a discussion about rivalries in the NWSL. It sort of feels like the only rival the Current have right now, is the referees.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few other topics, including:\n\nSKC II lose\n\nCamille Ashton found a new, very similar, NWSL job\n\nSKC injury updates for Salloi, Remi and Rosero\n\nA KC Current injury update for Vanessa DiBernardo\n\nLots of US Soccer news\n\nand Pitchside Coffee by several KC Current players\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC lose again - 4:41\n\nFelipe Hernandez suspended - 27:41\n\nVermes gives a transfer update - 44:01\n\nKC Current draw at home - 58:05\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:07:22\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC vs. Real Salt Lake - Wednesday, June 19th @ 7:30 PM CT\n\nSporting KC at Columbus Crew - Saturday, June 22nd @ 6:30 PM\n\nKC Current at Portland Thorns - Sunday, June 23rd @ 3:00 PM\n\nSporting KC II at St. Louis City II - Sunday, June 23rd @ 6:00 PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

For the second straight season (let's not make it three, please) Sporting KC ended a 10-game winless run with a victory over the Seattle Sounders. This time, it was seven straight losses, so a win was a massive relief.\n\nThe question is, can Sporting KC sustain this success? They got the game winning goal against a 10-man Seattle side and their expected goals (xG) was actually lower than Seattle's. Then again, confidence can do wonders. The release of emotions from the players both on and off the field showed how much it meant to all of them.\n\nThe victory comes on the same day that Sam McDowell put out a fantastic story in the KC Star about a sit-down interview with managing owner Mike Illig. Mike, son of Cliff Illig, told Sam that he had no plans to fire Peter Vermes and wanted him to run a rebuild over the next three transfer windows (through the summer of 2025).\n\nInfamously, Peter Vermes signed a five-year contract extension after missing the playoffs in 2022 that just kicked in this year. He's signed through the 2028 season, and it always sort of felt like they wouldn't pay him for four-and-a-half years of nothing, plus pay another coach.\n\nSheena and I weigh in on the story, Peter handling the rebuild, the targeted positions of center back and winger (no midfielders?) this summer. Fontas and Russell are probably approaching the end of their SKC careers, so replacing them makes sense. Ignoring the midfield is concerning though.\n\nBefore listening, I encourage you to read the whole story over at the Star.\n\nWe also address the rumor that Robert Castellanos has interest from Chivas (Liga MX).\n\nAnd the Kansas City Current just keep winning! This time 5-2 at home over the Seattle Reign to climb back to the top of the NWSL standings. There were new starters, new goal scorers, a testing of the team's depth and the return of orchestrated celebrations by captain Lo LaBonta.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few other topics, including:\n\nSKC II keep winning\n\nImportant moments for Pulskamp and Russell\n\nGianluca Busio gets promoted\n\nTwo more coaches are fired in MLS\n\nand an NWSL attendance record\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC defeated the Sounders(again) - 7:21\n\nVermesâ job is safe - 25:16\n\nRobert Castellanos Transfer Rumor - 47:47\n\nKC Current crush the Reign - 55:43\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:09:53\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nUSA U-23s vs. Japan, Tuesday, June 11th @ 7:00 PM CT\n\nUSMNT vs. Brazil, Wednesday, June 12th @ 6:00 PM\n\nSporting KC II at Real Monarchs, Wednesday, June 12th @ 6:00 PM\n\nEuros 2024 Starts Friday at 2:00 PM - Germany vs. Scotland\n\nKC Current vs. Chicago Red Stars, Friday, June 14th @ 7:00 PM\n\nSporting KC at LA Galaxy, Saturday, June 15th @ 9:30 PM\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

But before we get to the bad results, they did have a good result this week. They did what a Major League Soccer team should have done and downed FC Tulsa, a second division foe, 4-0 in the US Open Cup. That sets Sporting KC up to play FC Dallas in the quarterfinal where they only need three more wins to lift a trophy in an otherwise abysmal year.\n\nWhile Sheena sneaks some negativity in that Open Cup conversation, we do eventually switch gears to talk about the 2-1 loss to the Portland Timbers on the road. The \"starters\" were all back except Remi Walter, who was replaced by the goal scorer Memo Rodriguez. The game went poor from a chance creation perspective, results perspective, and an injury perspective.\n\nErik Thommy appeared to pull his hamstring and had to sub out early and then Memo Rodriguez picked up a suspension for yellow card accumulation. That led to a conversation of what the midfield could possibly look like against the Vancouver Whitecaps on Wednesday. I think it's time for an SKC II loan over playing someone out of position.\n\nThe Kansas City Current did what they often do and kept winning! This time in the first ever meeting against the Utah Royals. Despite the win, it wasn't all good news as Gabby Robinson went down with an injury and we fear the worst.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the surprise resignation of General Manager Camille Ashton from the KC Current.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nGianluca Busio on the verge of Serie A again\n\nKC Current have so many international call ups\n\nSKC Academy have a couple as well\n\nAnd a clarification on pay \"raises and cuts\"\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC advance in the Open Cup - 7:23\n\nBut lose their 5th straight in MLS play - 24:16\n\nClarification on a new MLS rule - 53:43\n\nKC Current win! - 55:01\n\nCamille Ashton resigns - 1:02:32\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:06:41\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC vs Vancouver Whitecaps, Wednesday, May 29th @ 7:30 PM CDT\n\nUSWNT vs. South Korea, Saturday, June 1st @ 4:00 PM (TNT/Max/Peacock)\n\nSporting KC at Minnesota United, Saturday, June 1st @ 7:30 PM\n\nSKC II at MNUFC 2, Sunday, June 2nd @ 6:00 PM\n\nThe KC Current are off for the international break\n\nWe recently turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nAs a special gift to For the Glory KC listeners and KC Soccer Journal readers, Backheeled dot com is giving away 30 days of their amazing, independent American soccer coverage for free.

This time, it was a 3-2 loss on the road against Austin FC. Peter Vermes made a big deal about \"effort\" and \"mentality\" after last week's loss against the Houston Dynamo, but the changes to the lineup were minimal.\n\nSheena and I discuss what we thought was going to happen versus what happened and how things played out. Did the new starters play glorious or did the wrong people find their way to the bench? The only changes were Erik Thommy, Robert Castellanos and Zorhan Bassong staring while Willy Agada, Robert Volder and Tim Leibold found themselves benched. Peter thinks the effort is good though.\n\nThen we couldn't avoid our chance to play Fantasy Sporting Director as the salaries for Sporting KC were released and there are a lot of questionable contracts on the list. Sheena managed to limit the amount of blackmail accusations, but we both have strong opinions about who is being paid too much and just a little on who is underpaid.\n\nThe Kansas City Current couldn't lift us out of the doldrums as they gave up a late lead in an extended amount of stoppage time against Racing Louisville. 112 minutes were played in a 90-minute game, so we look at if that time was justified and what could have been done differently to hold on to the lead. But hey, at least the KC Current are still unbeaten! Plus, a ball almost got into the Missouri River.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nNashville SC are the first in MLS to fire a coach\n\nSKC II update\n\nAnother Marco Reus rumor\n\nRaquino!\n\nand what is going on with the Tulsa Athletic\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC lose yet again - 6:19\n\nSKC/MLS Salaries Released - 27:51\n\nKC Current draw late - 1:05:09\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:21:21\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC vs FC Tulsa, Tuesday, May 21st @ 7:30 PM CDT\n\nKC Current at Utah Royals, Saturday, May 25th @ 9:30 PM\n\nSporting KC at Portland, Saturday, May 25th @ 9:30 PM\n\nSKC II off this week\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E19 - For the Glory KC is back with the 84th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City just keep tumbling. They are down to 12th place in the Western Conference, just a single point ahead of 13th and 14th placed San Jose Earthquakes and the Portland Timbers. They got there with a 2-1 loss to the Houston Dynamo on Saturday night.\n\nSheena and I set out to try and figure out what is wrong. I have a theory that they actually need to go away from the 4-2-3-1 formation and back to the 4-3-3. Folks get tired of that formation, but the 4-2-3-1 is not working! They haven't won a single game in five tries rolling it out. Let's recap:\n\nWe first saw it against the LA Galaxy and blew a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2\n\nThen again against Portland and blew a 3-0 lead to tie 3-3\n\nLost to Inter Miami in this formation\n\nTied St. Louis 3-3\n\nLost to Minnesota United\n\nWe talked about the outstanding performances of Memo Rodriguez and a lot of middling performances all around the roster. Peter Vermes agreed in his post-match press conference. There was a lot of discussion around a \"change in mentality.\" Vermes said, \"its' not all the guys, it's quite of few of the guys though.\" He also called the Houston goals \"atrocious\" and \"amateur, at best.\" And above all else, he said a lot of players lacked effort. There was talk in benching players, suffering and so many other topics in a short seven-minute presser. Daniel Salloi gave some tough interviews in the locker room too.\n\nWe try to figure out who lacked effort and who is going to get benched, and there are a lot of potential candidates. We also discuss briefly the 120-minute win over Union Omaha to advance in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup to face FC Tulsa in the Round of 16.\n\nThankfully, we still have the Kansas City Current. While they only mustered out a draw Wednesday on incredibly short rest and travel nightmares against Vlatko's former team, the Seattle Reign, they won again on Sunday against the North Carolina Courage.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nEspinoza and Zusi are back... sort of.\n\nSKC are the 41st most valuable franchise in the world\n\nAnd a bunch of other stuff covered in this story\n\nBia, Chawinga and DiBernardo earn NWSL honors\n\nNeil McGuinness is the new LAFC Technical Director (but SKC only could find Gavin Wilkinson?)\n\n14-year-old Cavan Sullivan is one to watch\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nNorthern Lights - 1:38\n\nSporting KC lost at home again - 5:20\n\nVermes post-game Presser after Houston - 21:59\n\nSKC (barely) advance in the US Open Cup - 43:37\n\nKC Current have another solid week - 50:11\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:04:01\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC at Austin FC, Saturday, May 18th @ 7:30 PM CST\n\nKC Current vs. Racing Louisville, Saturday, May 18th @ 8:30 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E18 - For the Glory KC is back with the 83rd episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City are now winless in five straight. Heading into the Real Salt Lake game, it never really felt like they were going to win, but they kept it close for a long time. There were six changes to the lineup, as well as four subs used. The offense wasn't clicking but John Pulskamp nearly came through with some hero ball.\n\nSheena and I weigh in on that lineup choices, all the missing players for illness (Radoja) and injury (Rosero and Walter). Plus, is this the last we'll see of Marinos Tzionis? It felt like he was setup to fail playing out of position with zero minutes in MLS or MLS Next Pro this year.\n\nOne of my favorites, Alenis Vargas, has some answering to do for that performance against RSL. I advocate for the 'kids' all the time, but this was a terrible shift from Vargas that might see him relegated back to SKC II or the proverbial Vermes 'doghouse.'\n\nAnd we absolutely can't avoid talking about this bizarre situation between Daniel Salloi and Brayan Vera.\n\nIt wasn't all downer news around Sporting KC though. Jake Davis signed a long-term contract extension, which is a welcome addition. And it seems really likely that Alan Pulido took a pay cut, which is a big deal.\n\nThe Kansas City Current nearly lifted our weekend up before a four-hour delay in the game and a fluky second half goal that allowed the Houston Dash to draw level. Despite the Current outshooting the Dash 29-8, including 14-3 with shots on goal, they couldn't pull off a win and find themselves at least temporarily out of first place looking up at the Orlando Pride.\n\nThe way the rain delay was handled and the scheduling nightmare it has left the Current in was the ire of Vlatko Andonovski in the post-game press conference. We have thoughts!\n\nIncluded in the game discussion on the broadcast was the news that Gabby Robinson may be getting a look for the United States Women's National Team. Go Gabby!\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nSporting KC II fall short against North Texas, but win awards for April\n\nThe 2027 Women's World Cup isn't coming to the US or Mexico\n\nPlus: The Columbus Crew advance in CCC, Kelley O'hara plans to retire and more\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC lose to RSL - 4:18\n\nJake Davis signs a new contract - 41:18\n\nAlan Pulido may have taken a pay cut - 43:59\n\nKC Current vs. the Houston Dash and the weather - 47:57\n\nKC Comets come up just short - 1:16:54\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:23:00\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nSporting KC at Union Omaha - Wednesday, May 8th @ 7:00 PM CT\n\nKC Current at Seattle Reign - Wednesday, May 8th @ 9:00 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. Houston Dynamo - Saturday, May 11th @ 7:30 PM\n\nSporting KC II vs. Colorado Rapids 2 - Sunday, May 12th @ 2:00 PM\n\nKC Current vs. North Carolina Courage - Sunday, May 12th @ 5:00 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E17 - For the Glory KC is back with the 82nd episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City are officially 10 games into their 2024 season and it's a benchmark that Peter Vermes likes to focus on. The team is 2-3-5 (11 points) and sitting in 10th place. It's better than last season, but that's an incredibly low bar to clear.\n\nWe asked Peter Vermes how he felt about where the team was, and his answers left something to be desired. My colleague Jimmy Mack Tweeted out the quotes.\n\nSheena and I weigh in the quotes, the play against Minnesota United FC in the 2-1 loss and the rumor from Taylor Twellman that signings are coming in the summer and where we'd like to see those signings. Oh, and we have to talk about this meme-worthy image and subsequent work from Offside Modeling that confirmed it was onside.\n\nThe Kansas City Current thankfully brought us happier things to talk about in their 3-1 come-from-behind win over Angel City FC in Los Angeles on Friday night. Plus, we went to Game One of the KC Comets attempt to win the Ron Newman Cup in the MASL Final on Sunday afternoon. Game two is Tuesday.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nThe new KC Current development around the stadium\n\nDom Dwyer signing with the Oakland Roots\n\nThe Major of Indianapolis Talking MLS Expansion\n\nFormer KC player signings in MLS and the USL Super League\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nOur Experience with the MASL Finals and the KC Comets - 2:03\n\nSporting KC lose to MIN - 8:28\n\nTaylor Twellman says SKC signings are coming - 46:22\n\nThe KC Current make a Big Comeback - 53:03\n\nItâs not all good news around the Current - 1:07:57\n\nErrors and Corrections are back - 1:12:20\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:17:19\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nKC Comets at Chihuahua Savage - Tuesday, April 30 @ 9:05 PM CT\n\nSporting KC at Real Salt Lake - Saturday, May 4th @ 8:30 PM\n\nKC Current at Houston Dash - Sunday, May 5th @ 12:00 PM\n\nSporting KC II host North Texas SC - Sunday, May 5th @ 6:00 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E16 - For the Glory KC is back with the 81st episode of the show! Sort of...\n\n[This is a weird request, but if this is the first time you've ever listened to the podcast, don't. There are some audio issues, and I wouldn't want to leave you with a bad impression. Sheena and I's audio tracks are out of sync and I'm responding to things she said, but she hasn't said them yet because of a delay. We recorded on Sunday night, and she hasn't had time to re-record. We polled Twitter and they said release it, so here you go!]\n\nSporting Kansas City ended their homestand leaving us wanting more. We commiserated on what went wrong on the goals as well as what went right on the ones Sporting KC scored. But we simply can't avoid discussing Peter Vermes' somewhat stunning postgame comments after the draw against St. Louis City SC. He either thinks the media, or the fans, are too worried about not closing out games. But he isn't worried. Wild! We have thoughts!\n\nThen, much like PV snuck into his presser, Sporting KC were playing against more than just St. Louis City. He didn't say it, but he meant the referees. It was one of the worst officiated games in recent memory. Alan Chapman called ticky tack fouls early, nothing for a huge stretch, then back to the ticky tack at the end. Inconsistent. 21 fouls to St. Louis. No yellows during the run of play. No persistent infringement. Either let them be physical or don't.\n\nAnd Taylor Twellman, noted St. Louis native, and about everyone else who isn't a St. Louis mark thought this Klauss challenge on Willy Agada was a foul. But Chapman saw nothing in it, immediately calling it shoulder to shoulder, and a goal was scored right after.\n\nI will say, this gif some St. Louis fan made was pretty amazing.\n\nThanks goodness there are other KC soccer teams though. The Kansas City Current continued their winning ways with a 5-2 thrashing of Bay FC. Sheena has found her favorite KC Current player and it's an embarrassment of riches on that talented team. In sad news from the game, Alex Loera announced she tore her ACL against her former club and will miss the rest of the season.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we hit a few topics, including:\n\nWhen Sporting KC can sign players next\n\nSKC's trip to Union Omaha for the US Open Cup\n\nOzzie Cisneros going out on loan\n\nSKC II's game and a signing\n\nLoera's ACL tear\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nI Refereed a game! - 2:08\n\nSKC/St. Louis atmosphere, chants, tifos and a draw - 6:10\n\nPeter Vermes thinks weâre too worried about the blown leads - 22:49\n\nPRO: Consistently Inconsistent - 34:34\n\nKortne Ford retires - 47:16\n\nThank God for the KC Current - 50:39\n\nCompeting KC soccer events - 1:04:26\n\nWhat is the MLS Icon rule? - 1:10:24\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:13:15\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nKC Current at Angel City FC - Friday, April 26th @ 9:00 PM\n\nSporting KC at Minnesota United - Saturday, April 27th @ 7:30 PM\n\nKC Comets vs. Chihuahua Savage - Sunday, April 28th @ 4:05 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E15 - For the Glory KC is back with the 80th episode of the show!\n\nI'm not sure if you heard, but Sporting Kansas City were out here setting records last night. 72,610 fans were in attendance inside Arrowhead stadium to witness Sporting KC take on Lionel Messi and friends on Inter Miami CF. The end result was a loss, but were there 'wins' to be had?\n\nOn this week's episode, Sheena talks about her experience in the stands contrasting to my experience from behind the scenes and in the press box. From the atmosphere to the amount of pink/Messi jerseys, there were a lot of off the field items to discuss.\n\nBut it wouldn't be a For the Glory KC if we don't actually talk about the soccer. We get into the 'only three mistakes,' according to Peter Vermes that Sporting KC made, to the things that went very right and all the in between stuff.\n\nThere is talk about a goalkeeper change. A change at striker (Sheena wants to go pretty far here). Subpar refereeing from Victor Rivas. Remi Walter in a walking boot and an update on his status. Pitch invaders. And we can't avoid the problem with Sporting KC dropping points, particularly at home.\n\nAfter the game, there is a bit rumor that came out this week from The Athletic. Fairly substantial rule changes could be coming to Major League Soccer. Weirdly the rules look to be changing this summer, mid-season. I'll explain what they are and start to get into out Sporting KC can potentially benefit. Come back to the KC Soccer Journal later this week for a deeper look at that possibility and a robust explainer if you are into that sort of thing.\n\nThen we switch over to talk about the Kansas City Current's first non-win of the season as they held on for a draw against NJ/NY Gotham.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we go longer on fewer topics:\n\nUSWNT winning the SheBelieves Cup\n\nCould the Swope Park Rangers return?\n\nDid SKC handle the 'retro' aspect of the SKC/Miami game well?\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nGetting on Channel 5 News - 1:26\n\nThe Atmosphere - 3:33\n\nMessi Jersey Exchanges - 17:18\n\nSporting KC drop all three against Miami - 20:54\n\nVermes Out? - 1:00:37\n\nNew, semi-large rules changes are coming to MLS - 1:01:57\n\nKC Currentâs perfect season ends - 1:12:26\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:21:01\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nKC Comets @ Utica City FC, Monday, April 15th at 5:00 PM CT (CBS Sports Golazo Network)\n\nKC Current vs. Bay FC, Saturday, April 20th at 6:30 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. St. Louis City, Saturday, April 20th at 7:30 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E14 - For the Glory KC is back with the 79th episode of the show!\n\nSheena and her casual takes are back! Two weeks of no regular co-host was weird. So, let's get weird in a different way with a late-night podcast recording session.\n\nWe start the show with Sporting Kansas City who have found a way to drop nine points in just seven games from a winning position. It's definitely better than how 2023 started, but it feels like a lot of miss opportunities.\n\nThe game started so good with a 3-0 Sporting KC lead that evaporated into a 3-3 draw. It feels like there is plenty of praise for how it started, but also plenty of blame for what went down. The game devolved into the second straight collapse in the second half at home. At least they didn't lose to the Portland Timbers like they did to the LA Galaxy.\n\nPeter Vermes didn't pull punches after the game saying the team did the exact opposite of what they discussed at halftime. But, how much of that is on Peter? We have some thoughts.\n\nSome of that blame ends up on Willy Agada for missing the net by a good yard on what may have been the game winning penalty kick. That said, he still scored twice, making it three goals this season in just 283 minutes compared to just one goal in 425 minutes for Designated Player Alan Pulido. Is it time for a change at center forward, even if Pulido is healthy?\n\nAnd it's almost time to retire a segment that Sheena hates, the \"Messi Update.\" Inter Miami are coming to Kansas City in less than a week and the question remains if Lionel Messi will be on the field. Sporting KC have bet the house on it.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nSKC II win!\n\nJake Davis and April Fools Day\n\nSKC Academy\n\nRoger Espinoza and the Des Moines Menace\n\nUSWNT beat Japan!\n\nNWSL Expansion is coming\n\nKC Comets attendance records\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC Collapse again - 2:34\n\nIs Willy Agada the Starting Striker? - 24:28\n\nMessi is coming to KC? - 49:51\n\nDigital Crawl - 59:46\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nUSWNT vs Canada - Tuesday, April 9th at 6:00 PM CT\n\nInter Miami vs. Monterrey - Wednesday, April 10th at 9:30 PM\n\nSporting KC vs Miami - Saturday, April 13th at 7:30 PM\n\nKC Current vs Gotham - Sunday, April 14th at 5:00 PM\n\nS3E13 - For the Glory KC is back with the 78th episode of the show!\n\nThis week, we have a very special episode with not one, not two, but three hosts! I'm joined by some familiar names to those of you that read the KC Soccer Journal. Juan Cisneros and Xander Kennedy make their For the Glory KC debuts! Don't worry, Sheena will be back, but we just closed out an eight-day road trip with a seven-and-a-half-hour drive and only one of us was a soccer sicko enough to immediately make a podcast.\n\nWe start the show with some Sporting Kansas City love as they picked up a huge three points on the road against Toronto FC. Sporting KC managed to pull off the win without the injured Alan Pulido (not to mention Johnny Russell and Andreu Fontas). It begs the question, is that a good or bad thing? Xander, Juan and I break down the lack of production from the forward line, but the goals still coming in elsewhere.\n\nWe also get into the bangers scored by Remi Walter and Jake Davis, as well as the highly repeatable Alenis Vargas goal if Peter Vermes sticks with trusting his young and pacey backups. Plus, we can't avoid the goal at the death from Toronto, which was apparently over a half of a foot offside.\n\nIn addition to all the goals scored, we dash around to various other topics including Memo Rodriguez stepping up his game, Sporting KC's propensity to shoot from distance, the return of Felipe Hernandez, Robert Voloder continuing to start and the return of the refs as PRO and the PSRA reached a new CBA.\n\nBefore we fully move off of Sporting KC, we have to talk about Roger Espinoza returning for at least one game and it won't be too far from Kansas City. He will be joining the Des Moines Menace this Wednesday in the US Open Cup as they take on Union Omaha (in Nebraska). Which begs the question, who else should join Des Moines (or any other team) to try to make a cup run?\n\nThe KC Current continued their strong form as well as they climbed to the top of the table off their third straight win. There were goals scored by Vanessa DiBernardo, Alexa Spaanstra, Temwa Chawinga and Bia, but it feels like they could have scored so many more. We also get into the level of their competition through the first three weeks and of course, the set piece defending. Plus, does the NWSL have a VAR problem? We've got some thoughts!\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nKei Kamara to LAFC\n\nInternational call-ups for the KC Current\n\nInternational club soccer coming to CPKC Stadium\n\nUSMNT over Mexico in the Nations League\n\nAnd the Messi/Arrowhead update\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nMeet the Guest Hosts - 1:38\n\nSporting KC win on the road! - 4:47\n\nAre these SKC goals sustainable? - 15:59\n\nRepeatable goals, Sporting KC youth and Toronto's offside goal - 23:00\n\nRoger Espinoza and the Des Moines Menace - 43:42\n\nKC Current win at home (again)! - 55:27\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:16:15\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nThe KC Current have TWO weeks off\n\nInter Miami vs. CF Monterrey (CCC) - Wednesday, April 3rd at 7:00 PM CST\n\nDes Moines Menace @ Union Omaha (US Open) - Wednesday, April 3rd at 7:30 PM\n\nUSWNT vs Japan - Saturday, April 6th at 11:30 AM\n\nSporting KC vs. Portland Timbers - Sunday, April 7th at 12:30 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E12 - For the Glory KC is back with the 77th episode of the show!\n\nWe start this week with Sporting Kansas City and their utter collapse against the LA Galaxy. Sadly, it was a game they utterly dominated if not for the eight minutes of terror. You simply cannot give up three goals in eight minutes and expect to win. You also can't go up 2-0 and lose games.\n\nI do a deliriously short podcast in the middle of the night after the ups and downs of Saturday night. A little For the Glory KC after dark, if you will.\n\nThe KC Current were around to lift our spirits right after Sporting KC crushed them. They found a way to win on the road against the defending Shield winners, the San Diego Wave. The Current feel like they are going to be really good this year. They did it without two more players, Hailie Mace and Debinha, who showed up on the injury report. Their replacements did quite well!\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nSKC's MLS Cup Odds\n\nDany Rosero's Team of the Week win\n\nThe KC Current/Portland Thorns TV ratings from ABC\n\nThe NWSL/Liga MX Femenil Summer Camp announcement\n\nTwo KC Comets legends retire\n\nA brief discussion of that wild USMNT game against Jamaica\n\nA fun Sacha Kljestan story with the Des Moine Menace\n\nPlus, our usual Messi/Arrowhead update (it's sorta bleak)\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC collapse - 1:26\n\nThe KC Current ride high - 20:34\n\nDigital Crawl - 28:49\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nKC Current vs Angel City FC, Saturday, March 30th @ 2:30 PM CST\n\nSporting KC @ Toronto FC, Saturday, March 30th @ 6:30 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E11 - For the Glory KC is back with the 76th episode of the show!\n\nThis week, there is no place to start but with the KC Current and their historic opening of CPKC Stadium. 11,500 showed up for the sellout in an all too thrilling win over the Portland Thorns. The final score of 5-4 almost ruined an otherwise perfect opening day (well, that an Debinha getting injured). But they got the win!\n\nSheena got the fan perspective and got tickets to opening day, and I brought the behind-the-scenes views from the media room, press box and elsewhere in the stadium. From fan experience, to atmosphere, to food and a well-run transportation system, opening day went off with minimal flaws.\n\nAnd of course we talk the thrilling soccer with five different goal scorers, including Vanessa DiBernardo who will forever be the first player to score in the stadium. She was joined by rookie Ellie Wheeler, new signing Bia, KC's returning champion Kristen Hamilton and another rookie, the youngest goal scorer in NWSL history, Alex Pfieffer! And while she didn't score, Temwa Chawinga had an immediate impact, Lo LaBonta was everywhere and 18-year-old rookie Claire Hutton really locked down the midfield.\n\nWe can't avoid discussing the four goals that got in and look to see if it's a worrying trend or just world class play from a couple Portland superstars.\n\nNot to be left out of the amazing weekend are Sporting Kansas City who are undefeated. 'Winless' no longer applies as they got the monkey off their back against the San Jose Earthquakes. Robert Voloder got a surprise start for the injured Andreu Fontas. There were set piece goals in both directions, as well as the return of Remi Walter from injury and Alan Pulido from obscurity.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nBenny Feilhaber is a Legend\n\nSporting KC II win and make seven signings\n\nThe KC Comets win\n\nThe USWNT win the first ever CONCACAF W Gold Cup\n\nFormer SKC and KC Current players on the move\n\nand will Messi make it to Arrowhead?\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSheena Learns What a \"Celly\" is - 2:04\n\nKC Current open their stadium - 4:24\n\nThe Actual KC Current Game - 19:12\n\nThose Four Goals Allowed... - 33:09\n\nPSA From Sheena & Food Reviews - 38:44\n\nSporting KC Win - 42:53\n\nWere the Fans Worn Out by Saturday Night? - 1:01:36\n\nLeagues Cup Schedule - 1:07:28\n\nErrors and Corrections - 1:09:08\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:09:43\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nUSMNT vs Jamaica, Thurs, March 21st @ 6:00 pm CST (Nations League Semi-final)\n\nSporting KC vs. LA Galaxy, Saturday, March 23rd @ 7:30 PM\n\nKC Current at San Diego Wave, Saturday, March 23rd @ 9:00 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E10 - For the Glory KC is back with the 75th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City are still undefeated, but three straight draws aren't exactly what most were hoping for to start the season. But hey, at least they didn't lose!\n\nSheena and I break down the game and get into all sorts of details. We start on a new starting XI that was forced because Remi Walter was out dealing with his ankle injury he picked up against the Philadelphia Union. He was replaced by Memo Rodriguez who had an up and down game.\n\nIn fact, the whole team had a bit of Jekyll and Hyde vibes. Pretty much every player on the team had at least a good moment or two mixed in with a potentially disastrous play or two. In some cases, it was a lot of good moments from one player (like Andreu Fontas or Tim Melia) but even they had really bad plays too. Of course, we have to address that weird indirect free kick.\n\nWe talk about our best and worst players, but nearly everyone gets a comment or two in each direction. The conversation also turned to Dany Rosero, in Sheena's eyes, underperforming. It's fitting that she wants him to be more dangerous on set pieces because most of his teammates think he'll lead the team in defenders who score.\n\nAfter the LAFC versus Sporting KC discussion, we turn to news about now former SKC Academy player Ramiz Hamouda. The KC Star's Daniel Sperry put out a nice Twitter thread that broke down the whole situation. We weighed in on it and let the conversation take us back to the SKC/LAFC game a bit.\n\nAnd we can't ignore the KC Current and the start to their season this weekend! They added two more signings, locking down draft picks Ellie Wheeler and Hope Hisey, as well as recalling goalkeeper Jordan Silkowitz from the Brisbane Roar. Plus, our expectations for the first home game both on and off the field.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nSKC II make two signings and wrap up preseason\n\nUSWNT advance to the Gold Cup Finals\n\nWill Messi make it to Arrowhead?\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSheena has a request - 5:27\n\nNo Remi and Yes, it was a Problem - 8:26\n\nJekyll and Hyde - 15:48\n\nThat Weird Tim Melia Play - 20:39\n\nWho Else Stood Out? - 25:00\n\nRamiz Hamouda/Youth Development - 33:32\n\nKC Current - 46:21\n\nErrors and Corrections - 56:58\n\nDigital Crawl - 58:28\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nInter Miami vs Nashville in CCC, Wednesday, March 13th at 7:15pm CST (winner plays midweek before the Arrowhead game)\n\nKC Current vs. Portland Thorns - Saturday, March 16th @ 12:00 PM\n\nSporting KC vs. San Jose Earthquakes - Saturday, March 16th @ 7:30 PM\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and are a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E09 - For the Glory KC is back with the 74th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City played their home opener, and it went really well... for 94 minutes. We break down the end of the game, rate the replacement refs and make numerous other observations about the game. Peter Vermes was not very happy, but he didn't blame the replacement refs. Though he did get very fired up in the post-game press conference.\n\nBefore we get to the soccer though, we have to take a detour to Sporting KC media day. I have a fantastic Remi Walter story to share (to Sheena's utter embarrassment), a few other things that stood out, including Sporting KC's use of analytics and more.\n\nWe also learn how to pronounce Nemanja Radoja's name, talk about the new stadium upgrades and a lot of other things. Look at the run time!\n\nPlus, we have some league wide news around the US Open Cup (and Sporting KC's participation), the new rules that are coming in 2025 from the newly formed Sporting & Competition Committee, some silly Don Garber comments and finally we get to talk kits about both MLS and the NWSL.\n\nWe also spend a little more time with the KC Current with updates on Nichelle Prince's health, a free shuttle to games and a tiny bit of preseason news. As for the Current's kits... why not just do teal? Olive and York did it for them if you are so inclined.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nSKC II make a signing and have another preseason game\n\nHartzell is out as the âhype manâ for SKC\n\nSKC Academy CB Ramiz Hamouda signed with the Birmingham Legion (USL)\n\nAlong with a Carlos Vela rumor outside of LAFC, a PRO/PSRA deadline, Paul Pogba is suspended, no blue cards in 'elite' soccer and USWNT and USYNT updates\n\nHere is a rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC Media Day Insights - 4:34\n\nSporting KC vs. Philly - Part 1: The end of the game - 17:33\n\nReplacement Refs - 27:58\n\nSKC vs Philly - Part 2: Other Observations - 32:10\n\nHow do you say \"Radoja?\" - 49:39\n\nUS Open Cup is on, sorta - 53:28\n\nOther MLS news - 58:06\n\nKit Conversations (MLS & NWSL) - 1:02:42\n\nKC Current - 1:12:09\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:18:43\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nInter Miami at Nashville in CCC, Thursday, March 7th at 8:00pm CST (winner plays midweek before the Arrowhead game)\n\nSporting KC at LAFC, Saturday, March 9th at 9:30pm\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E08 - For the Glory KC is back with the 73rd episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City got the 2024 season underway on Saturday night and it was more of a whimper than a bang, but it's early. While play was sloppy and the passes were often off target, it is only one game into the year and the team managed a draw despite not playing particularly well.\n\nSheena returns to the podcast, and we break down the goals by both teams and a tactical wrinkle with Erik Thommy and Remi Walter. We also look at Peter's subbing patterns, the crappy Houston Dynamo fans booing Memo Rodriguez, a few player debuts and how the replacement refs did.\n\nBeyond the game, there was other news around Sporting KC this week. Peter Vermes gave an interview to the KC Star with some juicy information about four Designated Player targets that didn't work out, including Kellyn Acosta and four players to watch as breakout candidates this season.\n\nAnd SKC announced their roster designations including two surprise DPs (Salloi and Radoja) as well as green cards and some clues about new signing salaries. We even get a little behind the scenes from my trip to Swope Soccer Village to watch Sporting KC II play UMKC (they won 5-2).\n\nWe also spend a little time with the KC Current and MLS at large.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nWho should be Sporting Legend\n\nA new SKC II signing\n\nA US Open Cup update (and it's not positive)\n\nSKC Academy and SPR player Tucker Lepley signs with the LA Galaxy\n\nA couple non-roster invitees of the KC Current, including the owners daughter\n\nAnd a US Soccer update on the full national team and the U-20 women\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC draw at Houston - 5:31\n\nPeter Vermes Interview - 36:48\n\nSKC II Behind the Scenes - 42:54\n\nSKC Roster Updates - 49:32\n\nAround MLS - 55:15\n\nKC Current - 57:43\n\nErrors and Corrections - 1:07:57\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:08:14\n\nUpcoming Schedule:\n\nUSWNT in the CONCACAF W Gold Cup\n\nThe Philadelphia Union play Deportivo Saprissa on Tue, Feb 27th at 7:15\n\nSporting KC host Philadelphia Union - Saturday, March 2nd at 7:30\n\nKC Current play the Houston Dash in preseason next Sunday (March 3rd)\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E07 - For the Glory KC is back with the 72nd episode of the show!\n\nBefore we get to the soccer, despite my efforts to mostly keep the podcast out of the political realm, we have to speak of the horrible tragedy at Union Station this week in Kansas City. It shouldn't be political, but it somehow is. I realize sports are an escape for many, myself included, but I can't sit idly by. There are time stamps below if you want to 'stick to the soccer.' Or if you don't want to listen, that's your right too.\n\nSpeaking of the soccer, we get to that, but it's a little different this week. My co-host and wife, Sheena, is ill so I have a guest host! We talked about Sporting Kansas City playing their final preseason game and how they pulled off a 3-1 win over Atlanta United on Saturday. Plus, the resulting Peter Vermes quotes on Johnny Russell and Tim Leibold's injuries, how they approached preseason differently and of course all the goals.\n\nFrom there we preview the Sporting KC season, with a brief look back at the offseason. Then we move on to the opening day opponent, the Houston Dynamo.\n\nNot to be left out is the news that PRO referees are going on strike and replacement refs will be used to start the MLS season.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nSporting KC II start preseason (and lose...)\n\nAs do the KC Current (and win!)\n\nUpdates on SKC connected folks, including Nate Bukaty, Cam Duke, Kendall McIntosh and Tyler Freeman\n\nAnd the Messi update returns, with good and bad news for Miami\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nA marred celebration in KC - 1:27\n\nGuest Host - 9:15\n\nSKC Preseason Win, Quotes and Possible Signings - 10:59\n\nSKC Season Preview - 18:49\n\nHouston Dynamo Preview - 30:11\n\nReferees on Strike - 41:17\n\nErrors and Corrections - 48:41\n\nDigital Crawl - 50:05\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E06 - For the Glory KC is back with the 71st episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City didn't have any huge news in the week, but there were a lot of little stories building towards the start of 2024. First, the roster seems set with the news that Kellyn Acosta would not be signing with Sporting KC and Peter Vermes confirming it's \"highly unlikely\" a Designated Player is signed before Week 1. Sheena and I share how we're feeling about the roster.\n\nThen we weigh in on Khiry Shelton's now serious injury and surgery, Daniel Salloi's injury situation and how preseason is going for Sporting KC and if it leaves us feeling optimistic or pessimistic.\n\nPlus, we have to talk about the possible advent of Blue Cards in soccer around the world. Blue cards -- they aren't just for indoor soccer anymore! IFAB is considering 10-minute \"sin bin\" penalties for dissent and cynical fouls that would leave a team down a man. Also, two blue cards equal a red, or a blue and a yellow equal a red (which is confusing because those are all primary colors).\n\nThe KC Current don't get much love this week because I couldn't get to media day on super short notice. That said, Kristen Hamilton dropped some promising quotes in the KC Star, and we talk about the outlook for 2024.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nBenny Feilhaber's near departure\n\nSKC II's schedule is out\n\nStill no firm US Open Cup plans for MLS\n\nThe USYNT U-17 girls are going to the U-17 World Cup!\n\nPlus: Diego Rubio, new SKC announcers, former players on the move and the USL Super League\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nThe Super Bowl and Chad's \"Super Bowl\" - 1:38\n\nNo Acosta or any other DP - 9:19\n\nShelton injured - 22:25\n\nSKC Preseason Win and Salloi Update - 25:04\n\nBlue Cards? - 33:10\n\nKC Current - 41:04\n\n(NEW SEGMENT) Errors and Corrections - 44:24\n\nDigital Crawl - 46:25\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS03E05 - For the Glory KC is back with the 70th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City had a relative active week, considering how slow the offseason has been. They played the final preseason game of leg one before coming to and from KC in the proceeding days. They'll be back in Miami by the time you read this.\n\nOutside of the preseason game itself, a 2-1 Nashville SC win, Peter Vermes gave updates on player performances, Khiry Shelton's injury and more. Then there were the transactions. Sporting KC made a trade that could open the door for a future move and added Memo Rodriguez as depth. I lay out my theory how the next few weeks and then summer transfer window may play out. My masterplan if you will (that's during segment two, timestamp below).\n\nThen we switched gears to talk about Sporting KC's youth development problem and its latest saga with Ramiz Hamouda leaving the SKC Academy without a contract and the team getting nothing for him.\n\nWe also briefly talked Leagues Cup news too.\n\nThe KC Current made a series of signings this week too (Mallory Weber, Regan Steigleder and Sophie Braun) as well as an extension for Lo LaBonta. Vlatko Andonovski also gave some training updates and let us know who is a full participant and who we'll still have to wait on.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nKC gets six (!) World Cup games.\n\nDaniel Salloi is changing numbers again.\n\nSeveral former KC Current players are on the move.\n\nKU football at Children's Mercy Park.\n\nand Kelyn Rowe retires.\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSKC Preseason Results and News - 5:13\n\nSKC Make a Signing and Trade + My Masterplan - 12:25\n\nSad SKC Academy News - 24:59\n\nLeagues Cup Opponents and Hosting - 36:35\n\nKC Current Signings and News - 40:50\n\nDigital Crawl - 48:50\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS03E04 - For the Glory KC is back with the 69th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City have a lot going on this week, considering real soccer is still nearly a month away. A topic to break Sheena's heart is if Kellyn Acosta, rumored to be joining KC, is being looked at to replace Remi Walter long-term. He primarily plays that same position and Remi is out of contract after the 2024 season. We take a look at the cost and fit of Acosta within Sporting KC.\n\nWe also briefly discuss Memo Rodriguez being on trial, the 3-3 Sporting KC/Charlotte FC draw and all the Peter Vermes quotes that came out of the post-game presser. Plus, our takes on the leaked Sporting KC secondary kit, the other leaked MLS kits and Sheena does her first \"bio\" of 2024, covering Marinos Tzionis. Who else would you like to see a mini-bio on?\n\nThe KC Current have a ton going on as well. We go over the schedule release, all the signings (Bia Zanaratto, Desiree Scott and Bayley Feist), the trialists and the departures (Cassie Miller, Mimmi Larsson). And I have a radical idea that the NWSL should adopt -- getting rid of trades.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nFelipe Gutierrez retires\n\nChance Myers is the Technical Director in Nashville\n\nPRO may be going on strike\n\nHector Herrera is out for the SKC opener\n\nThat bizarre Jesus Ferreira/FC Dallas/Russia saga\n\nRylan Childers signs in Denmark\n\nAnd Inter Miami players are dropping like flies\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nHow do we feel about Kellyn Acosta on SKC? - 5:41\n\nMemo Rodriguez on Trial with Sporting - 18:53\n\nPreseason results and PV quotes - 22:28\n\nLeaked MLS kit thoughts - 38:58\n\nSheena does a Marinos Tzionis Bio - 47:51\n\nKC Current Schedule - 52:26\n\nLots of KC Current roster moves - 1:00:18\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:11:23\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS03E03 - For the Glory KC is back with the 68th episode of the show!\n\nSporting Kansas City, against everything I personally expected, did the right thing and moved on from Gavin Wilkinson. But somehow, they still got that wrong. From the non-apology given by Mike Illig to Peter Vermes' refusal to even entertain answering questions about the whole situation in Saturday's press conference. We have thoughts!\n\nWe do get to actually talking soccer this time out though, getting into all the Sporting KC preseason news. From the roster to the schedule and the results of the first game. Plus, we catch up on that Kortne Ford signing that got lost last week. And did Roger Espinoza officially retire?\n\nThe KC Current are back in the news for many reasons. We catch up on their two trades and weigh in on yet another player being caught out by their trade. We also catch up on their rumored signings (Desiree Scott and Bia) as well as the 2024 NWSL College Draft.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\n2026 World Cup Final location\n\nFormer KC players/coaches update (Busio, Nguyen)\n\nA couple smart MLS trades from rivals St. Louis City and Real Salt Lake\n\nKC Current staff announcements\n\nSam Mewis retiring\n\nMore NWSL Expansion for 2026\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nWilkinson is gone - 5:09\n\nNew controversy from the Wilkinson hire - 13:38\n\nSporting KC Preseason - 36:12\n\nSheena wants signings! - 44:29\n\nEspinoza officially retired? - 50:48\n\nKortne Ford to SKC II - 53:40\n\nGautrat and Kizer Trades - 57:12\n\nA Rumored three Current signings - 1:08:32\n\nThe NWSL draft - 1:12:28\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:16:46\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E02 -\n\nFor the Glory KC is back with the 67th episode of the podcast but it's going to be a little different than usual.\n\nSporting Kansas City made headlines this week with the hiring of Gavin Wilkinson as the team's new Sporting Director. It's a search we didn't hear about until the hire was made. Peter Vermes gave up his title but got a new one -- Chief Soccer Officer. Wilkinson will report to Vermes, even though it's often the other way around with a coach/manager and the Sporting Director.\n\nFor the podcast this week, instead of doing our cheery, usual thing, we've decided to dive deeper into the Wilkinson hire. No digital crawl. No KC Current news (why drag them into this). No news on other signings or happenings around the team or the league. That will come at another time (maybe). This is dedicated to Wilkinson's history that led us to this place today.\n\nBecause not everyone wants to listen to us talk for an hour, I'll put a portion of the podcast details in writing, so they can live there forever.\n\nWhat I will tell you about myself is I'm an 'evidence guy.' While I wrote the initial 'news' piece of the report of Wilkinson's hire, I tried to minimize how much my opinion was in that story. After spending many hours reading the Yates Report and other sources, I feel confident in my final position. But you can decide for yourself.\n\nI will tell you this is by far the most research I've put into a podcast that is usually just a husband and wife talking about the teams they love. I'm tired, but I hope it was worth it! It's been a mentally draining four days since the announcement. Here is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nGavin Wilkinson - 02:33\n\nTimeline - 05:13\n\nBrief Andy Polo Summary - 23:29\n\nWe weigh in - 26:55\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS3E01 - For the Glory KC is back with the 66th episode of the show and the first episode of season three. And waiting an extra day brought a lot of news!\n\nSporting Kansas City made waves on Monday when they did something that I personally thought was just a fun op-ed I wrote. They moved the Sporting KC versus Inter Miami/Messi game to the Kansas City Chiefs Arrowhead Stadium. Sheena and I discuss the pros, the cons and the massive risks the team is taking. The potential for embarrassment, either by Messi not playing or Sporting KC simply losing, could be disastrous (except for the impact to their wallets).\n\nI'll also go ahead and place this poll here, so we see how it ends. The fanbase looks pretty divided on this one as of publication.\n\nThen we switch gears to a tease by Sporting KC of the return to Argyle Kits. It's not clear if it's for the secondary kit, which gets replaced this year, or the rumored third kits that may be returning. But this has to mean we're getting Argyle Kits, right?\n\nThe KC Current don't want to be left out as they made an intriguing signing adding Malawi forward Temwa Chawinga. Plus, the NWSL made some mostly promising rule changes that kick in for 2024 that we go over.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we touch on the following topics:\n\nGadi Kinda's farewell and that bizarre signing video\n\nSKC assistant, Ash Wallace, getting an extension\n\nChardonnay Curran signs with the Chicago Red Stars\n\nCarline Sjoblom rejoins Sweden\n\nNJ/NY Gotham FC sign all the USWNT players\n\nAnd big MLS moves from the Colorado Rapids and FC Cincinnati\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nThey moved the SKC/Miami game to Arrowhead - 7:03\n\nArgyle Kits?!?! - 37:15\n\nKC Current sign Temwa Chawinga - 42:44\n\nNWSL Rule Changes - 48:53\n\nPRO work stoppage imminent - 53:24\n\nDigital Crawl - 56:44\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E58 - For the Glory KC is back with the 65th episode of the show and the final podcast of season two and 2023!\n\nWe look back on 2023 and our favorite memories from Sporting Kansas City and the KC Current. Sadly, we have to talk about Gadi Kinda no longer being on Sporting KC, even if we've seen it coming for weeks.\n\nThen we break down the 2024 Sporting KC MLS schedule. The biggest dates, the possible road trips and of course, Messi. Which naturally led us to the debate about if the Inter Miami game should be moved from Children's Mercy Park to Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nThe SKC preseason was also announced, meaning no more preseason trips to Arizona, but Florida is on the table. We give some new details on the three Sporting KC draft picks, some changes to the US Open Cup (again) and of course, the Digital Crawl, y'all.\n\nIn the Digital Crawl, we breeze through the following topics:\n\nA possible third kit is being released for Sporting KC\n\nSKC II add 19-year-old Haris Alisah\n\nFormer KC Current players Addisyn Merrick and Elyse Bennett land in Utah\n\nLots of personal news for Cece Kizer, Erik Thommy and Kortne Ford\n\nAnd the revelation today that Hugo Lloris is signing with LAFC\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nFavorite memories of SKC/Current for 2023 - 4:33\n\nGadi Kinda is officially gone - 14:00\n\nSporting KCâs schedule is out - 20:02\n\nShould SKC move the Messi game to Arrowhead - 31:15\n\nSporting KC preseason announced - 43:53\n\nSKC draft 3 players in the SuperDraft - 48:16\n\nUS Open Cup update - 54:28\n\nDigital Crawl - 58:32\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E57 - For the Glory KC is back with the 64th episode of the show!\n\nOn this week's episode we decide to do a \"double episode\" with Christmas coming next week and likely a slow news week with it. If you are only interested in certain teams/topics, be sure to check out the run down below.\n\nWe start the show with Sporting Kansas City as they made some moves this week and a few more rumors rolled in. We get into the signings of left back Zorhan Bassong and forward Alenis Vargas. Sheena and I share our thoughts on the players and how the roster spending flexibility hasn't been impacted much by these moves.\n\nSadly, that brought us to Gadi Kinda, who is \"extremely unlikely\" to return according to reporting from Paul Tenorio and Tom Bogert.\n\nThen we turned our attention to Major League Soccer at large. MLS took the extraordinarily (stupid) move of removing all MLS teams from the 2024 US Open Cup. We have thoughts! And then we get into a mostly positive set of rule changes, that certainly don't go far enough to capture the attention of the audience with Messi only in Miami for two more season. The spending isn't changing much but some of the time wasting may be a thing of the past.\n\nThe KC Current also made some big moves this week, swinging an unpopular trade for expansion draft protection and signing two other players in other transactions. Izzy Rodriguez re-joins the team, and 17-year-old Claire Hutton will come over from New York.\n\nFinally, we get to the Digital Crawl. We breeze through the following topics:\n\nThe Sporting KC U-19s got eliminated from the UPSL playoffs\n\nSeveral little KC Current news nuggets\n\nThe KC Comets earn a mention (listen to Thad for way more on the Comets)\n\nThe upcoming CONCACAF Champions Cup\n\nand Bruce Arena is reinstated to MLS\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nSporting KC Make Two Signings - 4:45\n\nGadi Kinda almost certainly gone - 20:00\n\nMLS Teams out of the US Open Cup - 26:53\n\nMLS Rule Changes - 39:01\n\nThe Current trade Kate Del Fava - 50:15\n\nKC Current make two signings - 1:01:12\n\nOur MLS Schedule wishes - 1:07:29\n\nHow we got into Sporting KC - 1:13:34\n\nDigital Crawl (including the schedule) - 1:25:17\n\n**Apologies in advance, there is a little crosstalk between us. We record on a website (Riverside) that captures our audio to our computers, so we were apparently cutting out live, but just talking over one another on the hard recording. It's not a ton, but it happens!\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E56 - For the Glory KC is back with the 63rd episode of the show!\n\nOn this week's episode, Sporting Kansas City didn't do a darn thing this week, but we still found stuff to talk about. There was a minor rumor, already covered here on KCSJ, about Gadi Kinda. MLS Commissioner Don Garber gave his State of the League address, and he dropped a few nuggets:\n\nThe MLS schedule is coming December 20th!!\n\nThere is no break for Copa America in 2024\n\nNo fourth Designated Player is coming, but rule changes are\n\nHow to deal with the 2026 World Cup schedule\n\nMLS Expansion (Phoenix, Tampa and others mentioned)\n\nand more!\n\nThen we moved over and talked about the Twitter Mailbag. Next time we'll have to expand to Instagram and the comments on the KC Soccer Journal. We took a lot of questions on youth development, Peter Vermes, offseason moves that are done and are still to come, stadium experiences and more.\n\nFinally, we get to the Digital Crawl. We breeze through the following topics:\n\nUS Soccer bidding on the 2027 Women's World Cup\n\nOther US international results\n\nThe KC Current made a couple announcements\n\nand Logan Ndenbe got engaged! Congratulations!\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nGadi Kinda Update - 5:58\n\nDon Garberâs State of the League - 13:02\n\nSporting KC Mailbag - 23:22\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:08:02\n\nThe offseason picks up Monday, check the schedule!\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E55 - For the Glory KC is back with the 62nd episode of the show!\n\nOn this week's episode, Sporting Kansas City made a series of massive roster decisions likely ending the KC soccer careers of Roger Espinoza and Graham Zusi. Sheena and I commiserate, remember fond times and get some of the feels out about their departure. On top of that, we talk about if the moves make sense and how we wanted to see their careers end. Plus, could they end up on other clubs? There is a lot of Roger and Zusi talk to kick off the pod.\n\nThen we move to the other moves on the roster. From Kortne Ford and the center back situation to our child's proclamation that she has disowned the team over Cam Duke's departure. We can't skip Sheena's favorite player Remi Walter, or the news Johnny Russell is coming back and what that means for roster spend and flexibility. There is still a fair amount to discuss around the rest of the roster including Gadi Kinda, Kendall McIntosh, Stephen Afrifa, Willy Agada and more.\n\nBeyond that, Peter Vermes has already come out and said the team needs a backup goalkeeper, left back for the injured Ndenbe, another CB (they already have five), midfielders plural and help in the attack. With 24 roster spots filled and only six available, that's six players right there. We give an early preview of what else we think this team needs to do this offseason.\n\nAdditionally, PV addresses the talk of a fourth Designated Player and changes to the current DP rules and we weigh in on that.\n\nThen we speed through the handball that PRO got wrong, and the Sporting KC II roster moves.\n\nFinally, we get to the Digital Crawl. We breeze through the following topics:\n\nThe next USMNT friendly was announced\n\nTim Howard is going into the soccer HOF\n\nMatt Miazga gets suspended\n\nAnd the MLS offseason calendar\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nThank you, listeners! - 5:11\n\nZusi and Espinoza are gone - 7:05\n\nFord, Duke, McIntosh, Russel, Remi, other moves and PV's needs - 28:20\n\nIs there going to be a 4th Designated Player? - 49:46\n\nPRO admits they got it wrong on the handball call - 55:55\n\nSKC IIâs roster moves - 1:03:00\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:06:25\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E54 - For the Glory KC is back with the 61st episode of the show!\n\nOn this week's episode, Sporting Kansas City are unceremoniously bounced from the playoffs by the Houston Dynamo.\n\nFirst, we have to discuss the tactical approach from Peter Vermes and company. With only 26 percent possession in the first half, it seems they didn't want the ball. Which is a puzzling choice when Houston is at their best when they have the ball. After the game, Vermes confirmed to me that it was the plan and he basically thought it was effective. I strongly disagree. I disagreed before the game too, for the record.\n\nThen of course, we have to discuss the handball heard round the world (except in the VAR room). The referee apparently told Johnny Russell it hit his chest. Did the VAR not tell the ref that was wrong? Did they even look at the best angle before play resumed? So many questions left unanswered.\n\nThis also reminded me of that Seth Sinovic red card against LAFC in 2018.\n\nBut don't worry, it's not just a podcast about bitching about the ref. I thought outside of the handball (huge!) and the low stoppage time, the ref was good. We also discussed:\n\nThe return of Graham Zusi\n\nJake Davis' off night\n\nFontas being the best player on the pitch\n\nThe struggles of Pulido, Kinda and others on the offense\n\nLeibold's performance replacing Ndenbe\n\nLate subbing (of course)\n\nThose dang three weeks off between games\n\nWe diverge a bit from the game to talk about the retreat that famously happened after Sporting KC started the season 0-7-3 before defeating the Seattle Sounders. Excellent journalism by Sam McDowell in the KC Star that you should read.\n\nThen we get to the Digital Crawl. We breeze through the following topics:\n\nUSA eliminated from the U-17 World Cup\n\nNWSL Draft announced a date\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nHouston eliminates Sporting KC - 2:39\n\nSKC's tactics - 5:14\n\nThat dang handball situation and Pulido's play - 13:04\n\nLots of other SKC/HOU thoughts - 22:47\n\nSporting KCâs famous retreat - 51:04\n\nDigital Crawl - 1:00:31\n\nUpcoming Games\n\nNone that matter to me...\n\nJust kidding, go watch the KC Comets\n\nSpotify took away our ads, so we turned on \"Listener Support.\" Don't feel obligated, but if you have a few spare bucks and a fan of the pod, we'd appreciate your donation.\n\nBig thanks to Splitter Conspiracy (listen to them here) for our theme music made with the permission of the KC Cauldron.\n\nS2E53 - For the Glory KC is back with the 60th episode of the show!\n\nOn this week's episode, Sporting Kansas City are about to play the Houston Dynamo and we do an early preview for the game. We break down the players to watch for Houston and the form of both teams. Sporting KC struggle on the road in the playoffs in particular and Houston are quite stout at home both this season and historically. Could that spell disaster for Kansas City's season?\n\nWe give an update on Dany Rosero and his availability for Sunday.\n\nThen we turn our attention to the KC Current who made a bevy of roster moves this week, including the trading of star midfielder Alex Loera. Sheena and I go down the roster and decide which nine players to protect and what a better strategy would be to deal with possibly losing two players to the Utah Royals in the expansion draft.\n\nThen we get to the Digital Crawl. We breeze through the following topics:\n\nUnited States vs. Trinidad and Tobago\n\nThe U-17 World Cup\n\nPulskamp and Busio getting a USA U-23 call up\n\nPhoenix Rising win the USL Championship\n\nEmma Hayes is officially announced as the new USWNT coach\n\nand a Messi update, including a date to face Ronaldo\n\nHere is a quick rundown of topics (and approximate start times):\n\nHouston/Sporting KC Playof"
