L££ UBHARY ftRlQKAM YOUNG UN!VBft8*TY PROVO. UTAH The basis of this book is the first volume of the series of Lehrbucher des Seniinafs far Orientalische Sprachen^ publish- ed at Berlin in 1890. Its author, Dr. Lange, before his appoint- ment at Berlin, had been, for a number of years instructor in the German language at the Daigaku Yobiinon (Preparatory School to the University) in Tokyd. Since that time all his energies have been devoted to the task of making his country- men acquainted with the Japanese language and literature. My own experience as a missionary student of the lan- guage having' proved the value of this work I prepared an English edition which was printed at Sendai, 1 901-1903. After I undertook the task Dr. Lange sent me copious notes -of corrections and additions gathered during his ten years' ex- perience as a teacher. Justice to him requires irie to state that I used the material thus graciously placed at my disposal with , .a very free hand, for several reasons. In the first place Dr. Lange had prepared his book with the needs of a Germ an student in view, and while the needs of an English-speaking student are in the main the same, there are many cases in which ail explanation intended for the one will not help the other. Secondly, Dr. Lange's notes were in many instances mere suggestions, very fruitful indeed, but not fully developed. And, finally, I felt that I had one advantage over the original author in that I had used his text-book when I first learned my Japanese, and was thus in a position to test it as he could not. My subsequent experience in the use of the language had revealed omissions not so apparent to the author himself. Accordingly it was my aim to recast all the material in such a way as to make it most helpful to the English-speaking student. This book is not a translation and Dr. Lange is not responsible -/or any errors that it may contain. IV PREFACE If I had been permitted to remain in. Japan I might have undertaken a complete reconstruction of the work ； but that is out of the question for the present. A call for a second edition having come unexpectedly soon, 1 have had time only for a superncial revision, with constant reference to the second German edition, which appeared at Berlin in the early part of this year. The new Lehrbuch contains eight hundred pages, of which the last two hundred are devoted to an entirely new German- Japanese vocabulary. Since students now have access to a very satisfactory English- Japanese dictionary it does not seem necessary to include such a feature in the English edition. The improvements in the body of the new German edition were laro-ely anticipated by the former English edition, in the preparation of which, as has been stated, Dr. Lange generously co-operated with me. Accordingly, in the main, the arrange- ment and the paging remain as before. The selections at the end have been somewhat increased. The aim of the book is pedagogical rather than scientific; hence the combination of system and no-system and the num- erous repetitions. 1 he pedagogical principle has been applied, for example, in the study of words. When it seems likely t ひ aid the memory of the student to indicate the origin of a word, this is done ； but when the etymology is disputed or apt to be confusing, nothing is said about it and the student must leara the word as a whole. The repetitions in most cases are not accidental but designed. For the student must pass through three stages to become master of an idiom. First, he needs to be thoroughly convinced that there is such an idiom ； secondly, he must learn how to use it, and, thirdly, after he has entirely forgotten its existence he needs to be reminded that he cannot get along very well without it. A truly scientific grammar of the colloquial is yet to be written. But in one respect this work may claim to be scienti- fic : it has been the constant aim of Dr. Lange, and of myself, to set forth the language as it is actually spoken by the Japan- PREFACE V ese themselves, not as we would speak it. The sentences have all been taken from the mouths of Japanese and repeatedly reviewed and criticized by competent Japanese. The senten- ces to be translated from English into Japanese were first writ- ten out in Japanese and then translated into English with a view to retranslation. Dr. Lange acknowledges his obligations to Mr, Tsurutaro Senga and Mr. Tsuji lakahira, who assisted him with his two editions respectively. In the preparation of the former English edition, at every step I leaned heavily on my colleagues and friends Messrs. Tadashi Igarashi, Jir5 Maeda and Iwae Irie. The proofs of the present edition have been read by Mr. J. L, Co wen and reviewed by Prof. Isao Matsuda. Thanks are also due to Rev. H, K. Miller and Mr. Cowen for invaluable assistance.

INTRODUCTION ' The Japanese Language The Japanese Language is the mother-tongue of about 50,000,000 persons. lii Japan proper, excluding the recent accessions to the Empire, such as Taiwan (Formosa), the native population is linguistically homogeneous, with the ex- ception of a few remnants of the aborigines. Even the Ainu, of whom about 18,000 may still he found in Hokkaido and Saghalien, are being rapid 1 y assimilated. The relation of the Japanese to other languages has not yet been satisfactorily determined. The attempt to discover an affinity with the Aryan languages a has, it must be said, not been successful ； for the words that are identical or even similar are too few to justify the inference of a common origin. The same criticism is applicable to the attempt to establish a relation with the Semitic languages.^ A comparison of Japanese roots with those of certain Altaic languages, such as the Mongolian, Tungusic, Manchurian, Turkish, etc., does not bring us any nearer to the solution of the problem, c Neverthe- less Japanese is usually regarded as belonging to this great group of Altaic languages, for the reason that it has iii common with them the characteristic known as agglutination. Ihat is, in Japanese, as in all agglutinative ton9\"ues, inflection in the ordinary sense is replaced by a loose attachment of par- ticles to the stem as suffixes, while the stem itself remains com- paratively unaffected. But it must be noted that the colloquial as compared with the classical Japanese seems to be in a state of transition from the agglutinative to the inflectional stage. In regard to syntax also the Japanese is very much like some of the languages that belong to the Altaic group, e. g., the Maiichuriaii. , Sinico-Japanese Witn Chinese the Japanese language proper has no relation whatever. In the former, words are properly monosyllabic and frequently end in consonants ； in the latter they are mostly a See \"transactions of the Asiatic Society Japan, Vol, II. ， p. 199 rt, b Japan Evangelist, October, 1906. C Grunzel, Entzvurf eiuer vergieu/ienden Granunatik der altaischtn Sprachett^ Leipzig, 1895. X INTRO D UCTION polysyllabic, the syllables being uniformly composed of a vowel or of a simple consonant followed by a vowel. a The syntax too is utterly different. Yet Chinese is of great importance in the study of Japanese, even of greater importance than Latin is in the study of English. Through the study of Chinese literature and the Buddhistic scriptures (which came to Japan in the form of Chinese translations), the importation of the Chinese arts and sciences, and the adoption of the ideographic script, it has come to pass that a great mass of Chinese words and expres- sions has found entrance into the Japanese language, in nu- merous cases even supplanting the native terms. Accordingly modern Japanese is a mixture of native elements and words borrowed from the Chinese and possesses a rich vo- cabulary. For many ideas there are both Japanese and Chi- nese terms. Of the latter the greater number are not under- stood except ill educated circles. Many, however, have become thoroughly naturalized ； e.g., sen-takii laundry, b In many instances the Cninese expressions have supplanted the native. Thus, for example, the modern peasant calls thunder rai (c) rather than kami-nari. The dictionaries are full of classical native words which are understood only by those who make their study a specialty. The common use of words derived from the Cninese is due not simply to the natural liking for foreign terms, but much more to the fact that the demand for new words expressing new conceptions is most easily and conveniently met by form- ing compounds from the Chinese. These are often remarkable for conciseness. \" Telegraph ，, is den- shin, from den lightning and snin tidings. Marconi has no sooner perfected his great a The only exception is iu But in genuine Japanese words, like shinan (classical future of shinu to die), the n is derived from mu. All other words ending in n are either imported from other languages or of onomatopoetic character. b It rarely happens, however, that foreign terms are regularly inflected like genuine Japanese words. The rule is lo regard them as substantives, adding sio ji (to do) to form verbs, na or no to form adjectives and ni to form adverbs. Sometimes a single word may serve all these purposes ； e. g., teki-tb suitability, ieJzitd suru be suitable, tekito na suitable, tekito ni suitably. But we also have such regular verbs as tekitau、 tekitatte oppose, from teki-tai ； rydru, ryoUe cook, from ryd-ri ； shikeni, shikette be stormy, from shi-ke ； gucnirtt^ guckitie be silly (rare), from gu-chi ; taijiru, taijite subdue (rare), from tai-ji， and the adjective hidoi, from hidd. Some nouns, like uma horse and zeiti cash, hive been so transfcrined that few suspect their Chinese origin. INTRODUCTION XI. invention than the Japanese have a new word ready for the dictionary ； namely, mu-sen- den- shin {inu-sen without line). \" Automobile \" is p-do-sha (self move vehicle). \" Concrete \" is yu'kei (having form) ； ** abstract,\" inii-kei. The exigencies of our own time have called forth an immense number of new scientific and philosophical terms which the dictionary-makers have been quite unable fully to compile. Ill order to speak correctly it is often important to know whether a word is of Japanese or of Chinese origin especially in using the honorifics and the numerals. ^ This distinction will be easy to make after a little practice. 1 lie Chinese vocables are very short. Monosyllables containing a long vowel or ending in 7i are 9\"enerally of Chinese origin. These vocables usually occur not singly but in compounds, mostly of two components. 1 here are, however, a few hybrid com- pounds (Ch. IX ) like our own \"automobile.\" The pronunciation of the words taken from the Chinese is very different from that now in vogue in China. ^ Originally derived from certain Chinese dialects, it has apparently suffered great phonetic changes in the course of time, so that the Chi- nese cannot understand it at all. The classical pronunciation now taken as the standard by educated people is the kan-on (lit. sound of Kan). Kan or Han was the name of the dynas- ties that reigned in the north from B. C. 206 to A. D. 264. c But many older words, especially those connected with Bud- dhism, are pronounced accordiiicr to the go-on. Go or \\Vu, at the time when Chinese literature was introduced into Japan, about A. D. 300, was one of the three Chinese states and in- cluded the provinces south of Shanghai. More modem sounds, are known as td-on, 1 6 or Tang- having*\" been the dynasty reigning from 618 to 913. Excepting proper names, there are very few words that follow the tdon、 the most common being an- don lamp (old style), cho-chm lantern, fu-ton cushion, tern- bin balance, fu-skin building operations, etc. a Another case in point is that of the word /e/ct (different from the fekis above), used in formal speech as a suffix to nouns derived from the Cliiiicse, The rule is that before a Chinese word no particle is needed, but before a nat ive word no must be added ； -. g.， from ri-so ideal and niii gen man, riso-teki ningen ideal man, but l iso-teki no kimi ideal country. b See Lange, i!.inf uhrunir in die jnpaiiische Schrif\" p. 70 ff and Clmmhcr- lain, « Introduction to the Study of Japanese Writing.\" p. 372 ff. C Kan often means ** China '' in general, but^ like almost all Chinese words, occurs only in compounds ； e. g., kan go Chinese words kan-ji Chinese charac- ters, kfiin bun (for kan-bun ヽ Chinese composition, etc. See also p. 122a. XII INTRO D UCTION In a few words, such as nan south, the pronunciation has not varied. But in Mei-ji enlightened rule, niyd-nichi to-mor- row {nichi day) and Min the Ming dynasty, the same word has three different pronunciations. So the character shan in Shan-hai Shanghai is sho and jd in goon. Practically only the kanon and goon need be taken into the account, and the student need not trouble himself much about the differences between them. Usually the goon is distinguished from the kanon by association with old Buddhistic terms. Compare : Goon Kanon Japanese English nin jin れ ito man, person nichi jitsu fit day- dai tai dktt great sai set nisfu west kon kin ima now 、 on in koe, oto voice, sound \"5 kd yukUy okonaii go, perform myd mei na name ' hyd hei tsmvamono soldier kyd ket miyako capital sho set tad as fill right gon koto b a word, speech motsu butsu mono thing mon bun fumi letter gwat soto outside kwai picture ka shit a under gwatsu getsu tsu/et moon, month riki ryoku chikara power Not intrequently one word may be pronounced in both ways without changing the sense ； e. g„ Id- kyd or To-kei (east capi- tal). In most cases usage allows only one or the other. Thus we say sai-kyd west capital, i. e., Kyoto, but set- nan southwest (lit. west south) ； myd-jt family name (lit. name character), but sei-mei the full name (family name and personal name) ； .ge-kwa-i surgeon (lit. external branch physician), but g-wai-kokti foreign country ； bimbo- nin pauper, but gwaikoku-jin foreigner. , The tones or accents of the Chinese are disregarded, except ill the composition of Chinese verses. This fact and phonetic decay have brought it to pass that ten, twenty or thirty characters may have exactly the same sound. This is the a The Japanese equivalent of an ideogram as distinguished from the Chin- ■ese sound [on) is called koe、 kun (c) explanation, or yomi reading. INTROD UCTION XIII most distressing' feature of the spoken Japanese language. Men of the same set or clique have no difficulty in understand-, iiig their own technical terms, but to the uninitiated, even though they be well educated, rare Chinese compounds convey no sense until the speaker by writing in the air or by explana- tion indicates what the ideograms are. Words Derived from Western Languages In comparison with the Chinese the number of words im- ported from the European languages is small. Thus we have from the Spanish and Portuguese biidoro (vidrid) glass (mod- ern glass, garasti)y kasuteira {castilld) sponge cake, kompeito {confeito) candy ； from the French, shabon {savo7i) soap, shap- po {chapeau) hat ； from the Dutch, kdhii ikoffij) coffee, doii- taku {zondag) holiday ； from the German, chifusu {Typhus), iorahdniu yTrachomd) granular eyelids, etc. Many words have lately come in from the English ； e. g., baiorin violin, boto boat, bur as hi brush, dokko doc\\<.^ /uraneru flannel, JutobZru football, hai/iata (lit. high collar) a foreignized Japanese, hankecfii handkerchief, hiKt inK, iruminei short illumination, katsuretsu cutlet, maichi match, naifu knife, peiji page, pointo switch (on a railway), rampu lamp, ramiine lemonade, sandu- ichi sandwich, shatsu shirt, shichu stew, sutekki stick, suieishon station, tonneru tunnel, etc. From the Enp-lish through the French : btjuteki {di/ieck) beefsteak. Biiranketto blanket has beccme keUo, a The Standard Colloquial 111 English there is now only a slight difference between the language of an essay and that of everyday conversation. In Japanese the written language and the spoken language have for centuries been developing separately. Scholars absorbed in the study of the ideograms and the literary style associated with them, have been quite indifferent to their mother-tongue pro per. Even now it is bard to find a Japanese with any seiisei of colloquial etymology or grammar. When asked about tnef origin and significance of a word your informant proceeds to discuss the ideograms used to write it. Ask mm about the conjugation of a verb, and he gives you paradigms from the' a 'i here are also a few Japanese words in European languages; e. g,, the Spanish biombo、 from bydbu screen, inoxa (p. r45a), kimono, rikslm, jujitsu, etc. XIV INTROD UCriON classical grammar which have little or no application- to the matter in hand. The Japanese have scarcely begun to make a serious scientific study of their own conversational language. On the other hand, of the few who are interested, some reveal their inherited prejudice against zokn-go (vulgar language) by limiting its province to the small talk of everyday lite. The [student cannot be too wary in accepting Japanese opinions I about the colloquial. But it goes without saying that in the language actually employed by the Japanese of the present day our authoritative guide must be found. It can no longer be said that the colloquial of Tokyo is normative. Tokyo too has its dialectical peculiarities. We shall not go far wrong if we regard as the standard the langu- age spoken in the higher educational institutions of the Empire. There is here a constant circulation and intermingling of teach- ers and students from all parts of the country, and it is here that the process of crystallization is going on most rapidly. This language of the schools, which will naturally be the lan- guage of the future, is being influenced both by the literary lan- guage and by English and other foreign languages. No obstacle should be placed in the way of the gradual assimilation of any needed material from the comparatively more terse and expressive literary language. The ideal of the Gem-btin-it- chi- kwai {gen speech, bun literature, it- chi union, kivai association) necessarily involves the modification of the colloquial, which in its present condition does very well for story-telling, but for other literary purposes is rather a clumsy instrument. Again, Japanese is being modified by the influence of English much as European languages have been influenced by Latin. The student will soon perceive that the speech of a Japanese versed in English is much clearer to him than that of a Japan- ese of the old school, even when both are speaking to their own people. As nearly all Japanese students are learning English or some other European tongue, the inference is obvious. 丁 he development of the language has been most rapid around the centers Kyoto and Tokyo. The most peculiar dialects are those of the northern and western extremities of Japan proper. Thus, for instance, in Tok yo one may say. Watakushi ni kudasaran ka. (Won't you give it to me ？), while in the dialect of Satsuma this becomes. Atai tamazvan ka. These dialects in many points preserve more of the classical language than the standard colloquial. For example, the people of the INTRO D UCTION XV the north say yogainbei (it may be good), from yokaru-beshi、 thus preserving the classical be ski. In the ports there is a g\"ood deal of pidgin-Japanese (】 っズ， ジ- hama-kotoba)、 which is to be avoided ； e. g., peke=-daine bad, spoiled. The student ought also to be on his guard against the slang of the laboring classes. Practical Hints It would be well for the student before he begins work on this book to go through a briefer course of the nature of a primer. To get a general idea of the genius of the language it is well at the outset to read rapidly a book like Chamberlain's \" Handbook of Colloquial Japanese, not stopping to master the details. Imbrie's \" English- Japanese Etymology \" will be found helpful later on. During the first year it will be a saving of time to employ as a teacher one who has a good knowledge of English. The teacher should be instructed when reading the Japanese sentences to vary them as much as possible. The student after translating into English should retranslate into Japanese. He will then be well prepared to take up the second set of exercises. If the teacher knows no English, have a in end instruct him how to proceed. Read to him the Japanese sentences one by one and have iiim criticise the pronunciation. Let him then ask simple questions which require the student to give the substance of the sentence in his replies. Let the teacher repeat each answer, correcting it as he does so. Don't let him ask questions about the grammar or definitions of words. Then translate the English sentences and ask the teacher to correct the translations in the same way. Lilliansla- tion it should be the aim of the student to render the ideas of the original in as brief a form as possible, translation word for word being- quite out of the question in nearly all cases. When learning words the student should try to form in his mind a vivid conception of the actual thing or act or relation expressed by it, without reference to English equivalents. The measure of one's progress is the degree in which the untranslatable elements of the language are mastered. One peculiarity of the Japanese must be kept constantly ill mind, namely, the persistent consciousness of the relative rank of the speaker and the person addressed as shown in the choice of words and grammatical forms. For the same idea there may be two sjts of expressions, one used when the XVI INTRO D UCriON subject is a despised person or one's humble self, the other be- ing reserved for use when the subject is a person for whom one wishes to show respect or when it is necessary to guard one's own dignity in dealing with an inferior. It is not easy I even for a native to observe the proper distinctions without being either rude or excessively polite. The Japanese are extraordinarily polite to foreigners, and foreigners are expect- ed to speak a little more politely than a native would under the same circumstances. No progress is possible without the perpetration of ridiculous mistakes, and the time when one is still obviously \" green \" is the most opportune time for mistakes. The people are natu- rally generous and indulgent to newcomers. So the beginner is advised, whatever may have been his previous habit, to make it a rule to chatter about any and everything under the sun to anybody that will listen. As soon as he comes to feel sensitive about mistakes progress will be very difficult. Helps for Further Study The student who has mastered this text-book should be fa- miliar with the grammatical structure of the colloquial and be well acquainted with about five thousand words. It is not practicable, even if it were desirable, to include more in a book of this character. In the selection the aim has been to gather a fully representative vocabulary of words that are in common use. Of the common terms, for every one that has been taken one or two have been left. The terminology of one's special business or profession will be learned almost without effort. But if one aspires to be able to converse freely on any subject of common interest, at least double the number of words con- tained here will be needed. A vocabulary grows only by prac- tice, but practice is dependent on observation, and to prepare one's self tor exact observation printed books are indispensable. I It is a common experience that an entirely strange word just learned from a book may be heard several times within a few- hours afterwards. Colloquial literature consists mostly of stories and speeches of various kinds. Thei'e are a few collections of extracts in rofuaji, of which the best are : Lloyd, Colloquial Texts ； Plaut, Japanisches Lesebuch, Berlin, 1 891 ； Benkydka no To\"w、 Hongkong, 1892， the little monthly periodical Yachigusa published m T5kyo, 1898-9, and the similar publication Romaji begun in 1905. ' INTRO DUCT ION XVII III choosing books written in the Japanese script the begin- ner should avoid those in which the kana are small or badly printed. Before he undertakes to read poorly printed books or newspapers it is necessary thoroughly to master the kana by the use of the children's first two or three readers or other col- loquial books in which the characters are printed large, if they can be found. The exercises and conversations in MacCauley's \" Introductory Course in Japanese ，, satisfy this requirement, but unfortunately the hiragana are written from left to right, an unusual arrangement not easy even for Japanese to read. Of the numerous conversation books Muramatsu's Afeiji Kwaiwahen is especially commended. Many of the expressions in Satovv's Kwaiwahen have become antiquated, particularly those having references to travel in the interior. Highly to be recommended, though the printing of the kana leaves much to be desired, are the M u kashi- banash i (ancient tales) and Otogi- banashi (entertaining tales) of Mr. I way a. In order to accustom the student to the style of these tales, one of them in romanized form has been included among the selections at the end of this book. Mr, Iwaya, whose noni de plume is Sazanami, also edits an interesting periodical called S J ion en Sekai (Young Folks' World). Novels will also be very helpful. Older stones such as those of Encho are not so well adapted to the needs of the student as those dealing with present conditions. For students who are interested in the conflict between old and new ideas in modern Japan the novels of Mr. Tokutomi {Hototogisu, Omoiide no Ki、 KurosJiio) are recommended. In almost any newspaper colloquial material may be found ill the form of interviews, reports of addresses, etc., and the volume of literature written in the style of lectures is constant y increasing. But the student will need to remember that to make a genuine colloquial sentence more is required than to end it with de aru, tie ariviasu or de gozaimasu (beware of \" co!- loquialized ,, books ！) ； also that a man may be a fine literary writer and yet have a wretched style in speaking. The style of the interesting old sermons of which we have had samples in Shin^aku Michi no Hanashi, or Kyuo Ddwa, is of course antiquated. XVIII INTRODUCTION In the study of colloquial grammar a beginnings have been made by Matsushita, Nihon Koktigo Bun ten, TokyO; 1901 ； Maeha, Nihongoten, Tokyo, 1901 ； Kauai, Nihon Zokugo Bun- ten, Tokyo, 1901 ; Ishikawa, Hanasmkotoba no Kisoku, Tokyo, 1 901 ； Irie, Nihon Zokugo Bumporon、 Seiidai, 1902. Excepting the first and the last named, these books are themselves ex- ^amples of the literary use of the colloquial. In the literature of the Gembun-itchi movement, such as Yamada's Biinrei and Sakai's Futsubun, both published in Tokyo, 1901, may be found illustrations of the colloquial as adapted for use in letters, documents, etc-, and interesting discussions concerning colloquial style. ' Brink ley's Japanese- English Dictionary is fuller and in many ways more satisfactory than its predecessor, Hepburn's. It is an invaluable treasury to those who have to depend on romaji. The student may profitably supplement it by one or more of the native go-pi-on dictionaries, Otsuki s Genkai= Kotoba 110 Umi に gen word, kai sea), Tokyd, 1891 ; Mozumi's Nihon Daijirin 、d ひ i great, ji word, tin forest), Tokyo, 1894, or Ocbiai's Kotoba no Iztuni {izumi fountain), Tokyo, 1899. Of these the first is said to be the most scholarly ； the last, most comprehensive. Some students will be especially in- terested in Churchhill's Dictionary of Military Terms and Expressions. The Eng\"lish- Japanese Dictionary of the Spoken Language, compiled originally by Satow and Ishibashi, third edition by Hampden and Parlett, Yokohama, 1904, is indispensable. Chief among the desiderata is a new edition of Gubbins' Dictionary ― a complete classified dictionary of Sinico, Japanese compounds on the plan of that still valued work. a In tb is book the. usual division of the parts of speech has been followed. In a scientific grammar this would probably have to be somewhat modined: Older grammars of the literary language divide all words into three classes . (i), tai-gen including nouns, pronouns numerals, interjections ； (2) yd-gen= haiaraku kotoba (working words), including (he verbs and adjectives, which are inflected, and (3) teniu'oha, from tc, ni, wo, ha {=^zva), including particles and postpositions. ©rtbograpb? anb pronunciation The Ideographic Script As has been remarked, the Japanese have adopted the Chi- nese ideographic script, in which the characters are symbols not of sounds, but of ideas. They are like our Arabic numer- als and mathematical signs, whicn are variously read in differ- ent languages, but have the same sense everywhere. To read Japanese texts readily one must master between four and five thousand characters. To accomplish this two or three years are required, even in the case of a bright student. But the attempt should be made. Every one who aspires to become so pro- ficient as to be able to understand anything said in his pres- ence and to express himself freely on any subject, must mas- ter the Chinese elements in the language. Generally the eas- iest way to do this is to learn the ideograms, and the easiest way to learn the ideograms is to learn how to write them. The attempt to learn to write beautifully like a native would be in most cases a waste of time, if not an impossible task, but at least the order of the strokes should be mastered. But in the order of time the first and most important task is to get a firm hold on the grammatical structure and principal idioms of the language. The student who is ambitious to \" master ，， the language is therefore advised to \" divide, ，， that is, to devote his first year to the study of the colloquial and postpone the study of the literary language and the characters to the second year, a Printed helps of two kinds will be avail- able, those in kana^ the native syllabary, and those in rdmaji、. the roniaiiize.d form. Kan a The Japanese began at a very early date to use the ideograms phonetically, that is, to indicate sounds without regard to the proper sense of the characters. They called them kcina、 from kari-na borrowed name. This use of the ideograms continues to this day in the case of proper names. Thus America is written A-me-ri-ka (35 米禾 リカ!]) the characters meaning a Those who read The German will be plensed with Dr. Lange's Uebiings- iind J.ese-huch ziifji Siuduivi der ja panischeti Sc/irif/, Berlin 1504. The selections it contains are exclusivley colloquial. XX INTRODUCTION respectively ： next, rice, gain, add. a In the same way the ideo- gram for \" root,\" called in Japanese ne, is often substituted for the homonymous character ne, {ini-ne) meaning \" peak,\" as in Hako-m and words like ya-ne roof {ya house). Througli this phonetic use of the Chinese ideograms there came into existence about A. D. 900 two syllabaries called kata-kana and kira-kana. A kata-kana {fiata side) is written squarely, being in most cases a side or portion of a common character having the sound represented by it ； e. g., ァ (〃) from 阿， ィ (/) from 伊, ク (w) from 宇, 力 (kd) from 力 U. The k at a k an a are now used only in formal documents; in writing foreign names and interjections, in telegrams, etc. The htra-gana (Jiira) level, ordinary) are characters written cursively and, in most cases, very much simplified ； e. g., あ (め from 安, V、 ひ) from 以， う (め from 于， か {ka) from 力 0. Formerly there was a preat variety 01 them, but in our own times the emoloy- ment of movable types in printing and the policy of the Educational Department have had the effect of practically reducing\" the number in common use to 48, one for each sound. In the following table we give the Jiiragana arrane^ed in the order of the go ju 011 \" the fifty sounds,\" Under each mra- gana is piven the corresponding\" katakmia and under that the equivalent in Roman letters. The columns are read 111 order beoi lining' with the right : a, i、 u, e, 0 ； ka^ Ri, kn, ke^ ko, etc. Most dictionaries now follow this order, the n being sometimes regarded as a variant of mt(. It is to be observed that there is no ye, or wu. To make the scheme complete the corresponding syllables from the first column are sometimes put into the vacant places. Wi, we, wo are scarcely disting-uished in pronunciation from i, e、 0. It is also to be noted that the Japanese do not say si、 ti、 tu， hu， but ski, chi、 isuy ft\" The table is of great importance for the conjugation of the verb. (See next paireX From the syllables in which the consonant is surd correspon- ing sonants are derived : from the k column, giy gu^ ge, go (力、、 ギ ゲ ゲ ゴ)； from the s column, za^ ji, zu, ze, zo (ザ、 ジ ズ ゼ ゾ)； from the / column, da, ji、 zu, dg、 do (ダ デ ッ * デ、 K). Such change in the sound is called nigori (lit. turbidness, a 丄 he extreme of arbitrariness is reached in the case of :'oine pr per names that have been bodily imported from China, where the modern pronunciation approximates original sound. But the Japanese conventional pronunciation is pretty far off sometimes ； e. g.， New York is written 紐 育 ( hn-iku. Here the ideograms give neither sense nor sound.

Though the blossoms (hues) are fragrant they fall away ； . In Ihis our woi' レ】 who will abide alway ？ XXII INTRODUCTION To-day I crossed the very mountain-recesses of mutability ； And saw a shallow dream, nor was I intoxicated thereby. Though these comparatively easy syllabaries have been in existence a thousand years, they have not supplanted the ideograms, but play only a minor role beside them. The Japanese syntax being so different from the Chinese, in ordinary Japanese composition the hiragana are interspers- ed among the characters to indicate modifiers, particles, terminations, etc. ': . •'、 、 Such composition is called katia-majtri^ horn, majiru be niixed. Further, for the benefit of the uneducated, mragana may be written to the right of the ideograms to indicate the pro- nunciation. This is called kanci-tsuki、 from tsiiku be attacaed. It is thus possible to read most Japanese books without a knowledge of the ideograms. The traditional spelling corre- sponds to an ancient pronunciation which has been con- siderably modified iii the course of time. In the case of native words the syllables of the h column have been most affected. kali am be changed is pronounced kaivaru kahi shellfish ,, ,, kai ifu say ,, ,, make before ,, ,, ク騰 hoho cheek ，， .. ho But it is in the pronunciation of the Chinese words that the greatest changes have occurred. Thus to も tau, taju are all pronounced to (not to speak of towo and to ho in the case of native words) ； kiy au 、 kiyou, keu and kef it (see the iroha above) are all pronounced kyo、 Tokyo in kana is spelled ton kiy au. The Japanese have been so indifferent to this traditional spell- ing that even among educated people hardly one in ten knows how to spell correctly. There has been a natural tendency to choose the briefest forms, as keii for k》o、 sen for shd、 ten for cJiJy etc. Til し、 Department of Education three years ago issued a regulation to the effect that sounds like ノ 3 should invariably be written to 一 ； sounds like k ジ o、 ki yo 一 , etc. This reform makes the kana spelling of the Chinese words almost as simple and phonetic as romaji. a a For example, even in the reformed kana the following must be written alike but pronounced differently : kiyd will wear and kyd to-day ； katsute previously and kafle one's own convenience. INTROD UCTION XXIII ROMAJI The system of romaiiization adopted for this book is identi- cal with that followed by all the rdmaji dectionaries. A fair degree of uniformity has been secured through the efforts of the Rom a -ji- kwa i {ji letter, kwai association), a society organized by Japanese and foreigners in 1885 for the purpose of effecting a substitution of the Roman script for the Chinese, a A committee appointed by the Educational Department to investigate the question of romanization submitted a tentative report in 1900. The system recommended differs very little from that now in use. The chief innovations are the substitu- tion of si for shi and s プ a, syuy syo for sha, shu, sho, following the analogy of ky a 、 kyu、 kyo etc. Further, the し ommittee would write ci、 c\"， cu, co for cfii、 cha, chu、 cho， following' presumably the analogy of Italian. The changes proposed have not been adopted in this book for the reason that the Educational Department has not yet reached 3 final decision in the matter, and it would be very inconvenient for the student to have in this book a system different from that followed by the dictionaries. In October' 1905, a new organization was formed, the Rniaji-kirome-kzvai^ vviiich publishes a monthly entitled Koinajt. Both of the above forms of transliteration appear on the pages of this periodical : one writer spells shashinjutsit (photography) and another syasinzitu / a While much of the Japanese literature, being intended for the eyes, is hardly intelligible without the ideograms, it is quite reasonable to expect tliat any conversation commonly understood through the ear should be intelligible wlien reduced to writing by means of an adequate phonetic system. But the full realization of the ideal of the Rdinajikivai must wait until the teachers, preachers and public speakers of Japan have by a process of natural selection evolved a vocabulary at once intelligible to their hearers and adequate to ex. press thought on every subject, that is, until the spoken language becomes as satisfactory a medium of expression as the present written language is. Forces now at work in Japan will brinu this about before very long. b See Kivainpd (Official Gazette), 5, Nov.. 】900. The innovations proposed are comparatively unimportant. Others will be referred to incidentally. There ne questions counecied with romanization which press for an oflicial solution and in most cases I he suggestions of the Committee are excellent. Its report deals largely with the question of the division of words. For instance, the Committee would write oaeari iiasai viase for o ara'.i nasai/nase. In regard to this question great confusion now prevails. See also suggestions by Mr. Fujioka in his Kd/zmji Tebiki, S- inkoronslia, Tok) o, 1 906. XXIV INJRODUCTION Roinaji IS designed to represent phonetically the standard pronunciaUon of the present day. In reading roinaji the general principle to be observed is that the vowels are PRONOUNCED AS IN GeRMAN ； THE CONSONANTS'. AS IN English. Vowels As might naturally be inferred, in the case of Eaglish- speaking\" people it is the vowels rather than the consonants that are hard to pronounce, a In English the vowels are largely sacrificed to the accent, hi Japanese the reverse is true, that is, the vou'els govern the accent. What we call the long and short sounds of the vowels in English are really differeiU sounds. In Japanese a short vowel has the same sound exactly as the corresponding long vowel, differiiicr only as an eighth note in music differs from a quarter, b The sounds of the (long) vowels are ; a 1 i Ire a in father (a) i ,, i „ pique \\€) u ,， II rude (oo) f ，， e ,, prey (a) 0 ，， o „ hope (o) Long Vowels. -ー The long vowels are written Ti {aa)y ii (ず)， u {uu), ei o (oh), c There are practically no diph- thongs. An is ordinariJy pronounced and written d ； iu、 yu ； a A vowel is called bo-in (mother sound) ； a consonant , shi-tn (child sound). b There are exceptions. For a sound very much like the English short \"a\" see kyatto. Before a double consonant or n followed by a consonant there is a natural tendency lo modify vowels so as to resemble the English short vowels. c Ii occurs almost exclusively at the end of adjectives, being a contraction of //ゾ or isJii. Theoretically there is a difference between . J (chosen by the よ、 cmaji Committee) and ei, but practically they are not distinguished and we write uniformly ei. In the same way d might be written on ； and this is done in the case of a verb like yon \" get drunk.' Verbs uniformly end in u. Ac- cordingly we write kau \" buy,\" raihci than kd, though the combination a u is in the case of a Chinese word always wriiten d. For the same reason we write ku\" eat, rather than kli. The combination i u in the case of a Chinese word is written yu the lule having been that u (or fii) following a syllable ending in I makes a long sound, while yu following such a syllable makes a short one- (Thus s/u yu results in slut, but ski n makes shTi ― in the reformed kana written shi yu— ). But in the case of the verb iu \"say\" we depart from the rule, since the stem is com nionly pronounced ii We should, however, write ヌ\"\" if tlie stciP were pronounced yui. INTRODUCTION XXV eu， yd ； ou、 0. The combinations ひ i, oi and ui come nearest to being diphthongs/'^ For the purpose of this discussion n is practically a vowel. In singing it may form a syllable by it- self. It follows that an, i，t， icti, en、 on, kcvi、 kin, kun, etc., are long sounds. If one wishes to speak intelligibly, it is a matter of prime importance to distinguish long and short sounds. It is especially important to distinguish o from d. Next in import- ance is the distinction between ;/ and u. Compare ： oi nephew tori bird koko here koto thing, affair toki time ho het infantry yo-san estimate kuki stalk yiiki snow 01 many tori thoroughfare kb'kd filial piety kj id high class td-ki registration ho-Jiei artillery yo-snfi sericulture Au-ki atmosphere yu- ki courage To the Japanese ear the words in the one column are utterly different from those in the other. There are a few cases in which the length of a vowel is a matter of indifference. A final 0 is often shortened ； e. g., so suite so doing', may be pro- nounced so shite. ； katappd one of the pair, katappo ； honto reality, honto ； be^ikyo diligence, benkyo. More rarely d may- be shortened in other positions ； e. g., imoto younger sister may be pronounced tin o to. tinal short vowels are sometimes lengthened ； e. g., sore jd^ for sore ja if that's the case. The o in yoku、 well, may be lengthened. Short Vowels ― The followinp- points deserve notice : U in shu and ju is often pronounced i， especially in Tokyo : e. p-., shu Jin master becomes shtjin ； bi-jutsii fine arts, bijttsu. 1 his is to be avoided as a corruption.^ But the substitution of i for yu is not always bad ； e. g., iku for yuku go, kami ii for kami yui hair dresser (p. 830a). ■initial u followed by ma is practically silent, uiiia horse be- a In the northern provinces and vulgarly in Tokyo ai 15 pronounced like (i ; e. g.. So ja net for So ja nai 1 hat's not so. In Tokyo ae and oe are often pronounced like ai and oi ; e.g., kaeru return, kairti ； koe voice, koi. We might add to the diplithongs au in kau as commonly pronounced in T5kyo, 】n western Japan kau is kd. b In norlhern Japan people often reverse i and u saying, for instance, mkcsn or even s/iikous for sukoshi a 】htle. XXVI INTRODUCTION ing pronounced mina (p. i ib). - E in early romaji texts was generally written ye. This spelling- has been retained in the case of only two words, ye \"to\" and yen the unit of currency. Ihe Romaji Committee would practically reverse this rule and write e for the post- position yg, but ye in other cases. The fact is that the pro- nunciation depends on the sound that precedes. The y is especially prominent when the preceding word ends in a vowel or n ； e. g., hei sm military service \\keiyeki), meneki exemption, from the servxe {inenyeki). The sound of yen is not でれ, as many foreigners pronounce it, nor is the y as distinct as in \"yes. \" O is sometimes corrupted so as to sound like u •• e. g-., hitotsu \"one\" becomes mtutsu ； asonde amusing one's self, asunde ； kom-ban this evening, kumban. This pronunciation should be avoided. On the other hand in some dialects o is substituted for u ； in Niigata shu-jin, master, becomes shojin. Yoi \" good \" is commonly pronounced ii. As has been said, wo is practically pronounced o. It is so written except in the case of the particle u'o (the Romaji com- mittee would write this also o), the pronunciation of which, like that of ye, depends on what g-oes before. The student must be on his guard in pronouacing a word like sh:o salt, in kana written shi ho. The w is hardly audible, but if the student is not careful he is apt to say shiyo、 i. e.， sho. In the same way ki-oku memory must be carefully distinguished from Riyoku purely and kyoku office. When two vowels are brought top^ether in compounds a y or w naturally creeps in ； e. g., ba-ai CdiSQ, becomes bayai or bazvai. The Romaji Committee in such a case would write y after i or e、 and w after u ox o ; e. g., tsu/siyau, for tsuki-au associate ； uiiieyawaseru^ for ume awasefu make up a deficiency ； guwai for ai adjustment ； owashi, for o ashi money. The Com- mittee recommended that a list of such words be made, which is an excellent suggestion. Quiescent Vowels. 一 Words like kyoku 、 ryoku, etc., derived from the Chinese, were originally monosyllabic, though written with three kana: ki yo ku, ri yo ku. Accordingly in romaniz- ing certain combinations the Rdinajikwai treated i as silent ； e. kyo 、ke u， now ki yo — ),etc. Many Japanese would go further and write, for example, kyok、 ryok. In native words there are many other cases in which the weak vowels i and w are practically inaudible, but the Rdinajikwai did not ven- ture to extend its principle to them, probably on account of the INTRODUCTION XXVII extreme difficulty of making- rules to cover all cases. Not only does the pronunciation vary according to locality, individual idiosyncrasy, etc., but even the same word may be pronounced differently by the same person, depending on the nature of the context. Compare, for instance, nakute \" there being none \" and nak, te wo \" though there are none.\" . The addition of mo brings upon na and te a strong accent, with the result that the u in ku disappears. A silent i or u is very apt to occu I* when ki、 ku、 shi、 su, chi、 な,/, hi, or fu precede any syllable of the k s, t、 and w series, especially when that syllable is accented. Final su ordinarily loses the vowel and becomes ss, and the vowel in final tsi\" sm and chi is bartfly audible. Eng-lish -speaking\" people are apt to goto extremes ill clipping final vowels. The Rdiuaji Committee has recom- mended that a table be made of words in which there are silent vowels. It would write taski for iasuki (cord to tie back tli6 sleeves), dougri for dongnri acorn, etc. The Japanese certain- ly do say taski, not tasuki. It is, however, impossible to decide all the cases without being\" more or less arbitrary. The plan of this book is to follow the spelling of the dictionaries, except in the Exercises, where apostrophes are used to indicate silent vowels, a Experience proves that tins system is a valuable aid to correct pronunciation. But to avoid abuse we have been conservative. There are, for example, so many peo[)le who pronoutice every vowel in waiakushi that we do not feel justi- tied in elidiiifj the u, as the Committee does. Consonants These will give the English-speaking- student little trouble, G when it does not stand at the beginning of a word is com- monly pronounced like ng \" in \" singing : Nagasa/si, like Nanp-asaki ; tiguisu bush- warbler, like unguis\" ; kago basket or cage, like kango (to be distinguished carefully from kan- go Chinese word). This may explain the presence of the n in the names of the provinces Bingo and Bun go {Bi-go, Bii-go) In a Dr. Lange himself prefers to use the apostrophes throughout. The compiler of the English Edition has ventured to disagree with rum in regard to this one point, on the ground that so long as the matter i:; not oFicially determined, great inconvenience in the use of dictionaries will result from any alteration of the present spelling. It seems, however, certain tliat the Japanese when they once take the matter in hand will elide more Vs and tCs than Dr. Lange or any other foreigner has lh()U<;lit of doing. The spelling will in (urn react on the j)ronii nciatioii xxviil INIROD UCTION western Japan, however, g is pronounced exactly as in \" ago.\" See p. 69a. »S before i becomes slu In some parts of western Japan, as in the vicinity of Osaka and in Kyilshu, s in the syllable se is pronounced like \" h or, more exactly, like the German \" ch \"，• e. g., omahen for cm a sen (dialectical) there is not. In T5ky5 se may become shi ； hence the change of se-ou cany on the back {se back, on carry) to shou. Ji IS formed by nigori from siu or chi. In the province of Tosa the two sounds are distinguished, the former / being like \" z \" ill \" azure ，, and the latter like \" g ，， in \" age.\" In some places the formt'r sound prevails, but in most parts of the country both ジ and T are pronounced ji as in ''Jig\".\" ZAi too should have two sounds, zu and dzii (often written so), from sti and fsu, but the distinction is not generally observed and one or the other prevails. T before i becomes ch ； before w, ts. N is pronounced \" ng \" before sounds of the k series ； before sounds of the h {p 、ゃヽ and m series it becomes in : son-kei respect ； son-gai damage ； sambyakii three hundred, from san three and Jiyaku hundred ； sent- in on specialty, from sen special and in on s^ate, department. The Roviaji Committee in such cases would not change the n to '\"\" In some compounds the distinction between a final n and ail initial n must be carefully observed. Compare gen- an original motion and ge-nan manservant. H before i in Tokyo and elsewhere is pronounced like sh、 as in hito person. 1 he student will do well to avoid this corruption, IS not quite the same as the English \" f,\" being formed by the two lips, not by the lower lip and the upper teeth. The study of foreign languages has, however, a tendency to make the f more like the English. The nigoried form of/// is bu、 not VH. There is no v in Japanese. In the h series a labial sound, / or ズ not h， characterized the syllables originally, and ill some provinces there are still traces of this ancient pro- nunciation. M before u has frequently been altered to み： e. g., eraiiiii^ erabu choose ； samushii) sabishii lonely. 】' (タ\" ， タ\" yo) occurs largely in combination with other consonants. One must carefully distinguish myo and miyo、 kyoku and kiyoku, etc. In parts of northern Japan y when not combined with another consonant is comaionly corrupted to z or j. INTRODUCTION XXIX R is not quite the same as the English \" r,\" especially in the syllable ri. The tip of the tongue is held more closely to the upper gum. la many places, as in Satsuma, r sounds like d. It is extremely difficult for the Japanese to distinguish the English \" 1 ,， and the English \" r,\" their own r being an inter- mediate sound. The vulgar sometimes trill r ； e, g., berrabd fool. ' W after i or t sometimes becomes y ； e. g\\, sorya^ from sore wa as for that. \\Va and wo occur largely in Chinese words combined with k and g\\ e. g.， kwa-ji conflagration, givai-kokti foreign country. In some parts the distinction between kwa ana ka, etc., is carefully observed, but is neglected in Tokyo. The reformed kana and the Committee's rdmaji ienioi'e it. But the w is retained in this book, for reasons already indi- cated. There is no need of \" q ，， or \" x,\" the former being represent- ed by kw and the latter by ks. DuBLE Consonants. ― While the consonants in themselves are not so difficult, the student will need to be especially careful to distinguish single and double consonants. The double consonants are kk、 ss {ss/i), U (tchy tts), fin, pp, 'mm. The best way to get them is to give a strong- accent to the preceding syllable and then for a moment hold the vocal organs in the position required to pronounce the consonant in question. The second of the two will then sound distinct from the first. Distinguish carefully pairs like : ika cuttle- fish ikka how many days ？ dasu put forth dassu (rii) escape from i-sho clothes is-sho one's whole life kita [he] came kitta [he| cut i-chi position it-chi union ana hole imna such am a nun am-\"m shampooer Consonants which are sin$jle in the literary language ar': frequently doubled in tlie colloquial ； e. p\\, mi una for uiina all, OJinaji for onaji same, luittsu for mitsu three, auuiiari for amari too, bakkari for bakari only, totta for toda merely, inassugti for ina-sugu straight (adverb). Excepting nn and mm, the first of two double consonants is in kana represented by tsu. Gakko school, from gaku nud お, may be written either gakukd or gatm'co. The compound haiiaUu development is sometimes pronounced hatsudatsu. XXX INTRODUCTION Nigori. ― In a comp aiiid a the first consonant of the second member is liable to the change called nij(cri : [hair), b shiraga gray hair {^shira = sJiiro stem of sJiiroi white, kami yakizakana baked fish {yara stem of y aku roast, sakana fish). sJmijin piety {shin faith, shin heart). ' jinja Shinto temple \\jtn god, sha shrine). pandane yeast {pan bread, taiie seed). [pack). kwanzuvie canned goods 、kumn can, tsuine stem of tsiinietu tokidoki at times (toki time). chikajika soon {chikai near). sakiirabana cherry blossom {^sakura^ hand). ' shinjvnlmkai pious {shinjin piety, ftikai deep). ― Since the kana for wa in native words is ha， this may also by nigori become ba ； e. g., wo wa becomes woba. [sngon is less common in Chinese than in native words, and less common in compound verbs than in compound nouns. There is a great deal of fluctuation in the usage, eupliony being the only guide. 1 lius \\vc say O-hasiii Great Bridge, but Megan e-bashi Eyeglass Brid9\"e (so named from its shape) ； either O-saka or O-zaka Great Slope ； an-nai-sha or annatja guide ； sai-han-sho or saibanjo court of justice, c In some instances the two forms have different senses ； e.g., chosha an elder or a superior, clidja a wealthy' person. Nigori is not limited to compounds, i iie first consonants of some words which are commonly attached loosely to other words suffer nigori ； e.g., bakarl only, from hakurii consider. Kiri \" only may also be pro- nounced girt ； kurai \" about,\" gurai. Mtiisukashtt \" difficult ，， is often pronouned muzukashii. Han-nigoriy that is, the change of h or / to />, occurs frequently in compounds from the Chinese when the first member ends in n. Thus fun be stirred and h ひ tsu be aroused make Jump at su enthusiasm ； man be full and fuku stomach, Diauipuku satiety. From the native words omou think and hakaru consider we have omompakarti cogitate. a 'i he vowels suffer little or no change in composition. A final e in the first member of a compound is often changed to a. Thus from kerne metal and mono tiling we have kanamotw hardware (but with hako box, kauebako money box) ； from sake liquor and ya house (p. i6), sakaya liquor dealer (but with noiui stem of noma drink, sakenomi dixwvi^.^x^'). b In western Japan peoiple say shirage from which, also means hair; c There are two sounds to the Chinese character for * god,\" shin and ノ m. Compare shin-gaku theology, from gakti learning, and jin-ja Shinto shrine. 1 lie Japanese, by the way, say Shindo, not Shinto. INTRODUCTION XXXI A preceding syllable coalescing with h or / may result in pp ： kiri stem -of kirti cut and fu (c) token make kippii ticket ； ietsti iron and ho barrel, teppo gm，. For other examples see p. 69 ff. Of native origin is hip p am bdng aloiio\", for hiki- haru. An h between vowels tends to become f>p : e.g., akep- panasii from akehanasu leave open ； iiiappiray from ma-hira earnestly. The adverbs yohodo very and yahari still are also pronounced yoppodo and yappari. Accent As has been intimated, if the student will take care of the vowels, the accents will generally take care of themselves. Among the vowels there is as it were an order of precedence. iMist there are the long sounds, then then o and < ？, and finally u and i. The stronger tend to draw the accent away from the weaker. Alternate syllables seem to pair off in the contest, the stronger pair winning-. A combination tending- to make a vowel quiescent may also affect the accent. When a difference between the vowels does not interfere, a word of three or four syllables is naturally accented on the first and third ； e.g., atiata you, hanahada very. The a before the causative enaing sent or the potential ending- rem is always accented. When a word is a compound, that fact naturally affects accents, a In general it is to be remembered that accent is not so strong as in English. It is one of the clisadvantai'-es of rdviaji that since the words look somewhat like English words the student is apt to give them Eng-lish accents. To correct this tendency the student who wishes to acquire a natural pronunciation should do a great deal of reading aloud from the Japanese script under a Japanese teacher of the old school, if one can be found who is not afraid to criticise. hjri, ― It is essential to good pronunciation to observe the km (lit. cutting), or ku-giri {ku phrase), that is, not to pause in such a way as to cut off particles, etc., from preceding words to which they belong. a In western Japan homonymns are often distinguished by means of the accent. For example, hana flower has a marked accent on the first syllable as compared with hana nose. In the same way they distinguish has hi chop- stick, has hi end, hashi bridge; kaki oyster, kaki persimmon and kaki fence ； kami hair, kami paper and kami god, etc. The Japanese themselves are so niuch in doubt about tliese accents that the student can well afford to neglect them. THE NOUN.a CHAPTER I. The Japanese language has, properly speaking, no article, no plural, and no gender. 1. There is an equivalent of the English \" a certain,\" namely, aru (lit. existing) : aru onna a certain woman. More recently this arujlna.s come to be used also with plurals in the sense of \" siime ノ' To the English article in its_^eneric sense, as in \" the cat ，, or \"a cat ，， (speaking generally), corresponds the Japanese idiom : neko to iu inojio what is called cat {neko cat, to particle of quotation, iu say, mono thing). 2. When there is need of bringing out the idea of plurality^ the suffixes dnmn (Trom imnn rompanjnn), .^hu (c) or .<:h\\t crowds tachi (c) or dachi all, and gata ffrom kata side), may be employerL-^JThese are, with the exception of the first, used only with words denoting persons' The last is the most polite ： Hyakusho peasant ； hyakushodomo peasants, Ko child ； kodomo children, Akindo merchant ； akindoshu merchants. Onna woman ； onnashu women (of servants girls, etc.). Oya parent ； oyatachi parents. Fu-jm (c) lady ； ju^tngata ladies. Many words may be made plural by doubling\" : Kuni country ； kutiiguni countries. Hito person ； hitobito people. I okoroy sho (c) place ; tokorodokorOy shosho various places. The plural may also be expressed by means of words used as prefixes meaning \" many,\" \" all,\" etc. Bankoku all countries, from ban myriad. Shokoku various countries (or provinces) from sho many, a Jitsu-mei-shi true-name -word, or simply nieishi. b The suft^iX ra is in the colloquial used mostly with pronouns. The ideo- gram used to represent it is to \" class.\" Both ra and to may also have the sense of \" etc.\" c The words kodomo child, wakaishu young fellow (from wakai young), and t&niodachi friend, have come to be used also in a singular sense. To make the plural sense of kodomo distinct, き till another suffix must be added ; kodomoia kodonioshuy kodomolachi. 2 The Noun. [] 3. Ill the case of animals the masculine and feminine gen- ders may be expressed by means of the prefixes o {on^ 2ccA,me i men\\ ； or, more commonly, by osu and mesu wth the genitive particle 710 : Inu dog ； ohm {inu no osu) ； meinu (inu no mesu). Tori fowl ； ondori cock ； meridori hen. But it is to be observed that the Japanese usually leave the distinction unexpressed. For instance : Tori nammashita. The (or, a) cock crowed. Here it is not necessary to say specifically ondori. Vocabulary. akindo trader, shopkeeper. hyakusho peasant. cmcm father. hah a mother. otoko man, male. onna woman, female, oya parent. ko、 kodomo child. tomodacnt friend. inu dog. kit sun e fox. neko cat. nezumi rat, mouse. ^ sni/^a deer. uma (proncd. mind) horse. usagi hare, rabbit. us hi ox, cow. tori bird, fowl. When nouns are joined by the conjunction \" and ，， or enu- merated in a series which is brought to a conclusion, to \" and ，， or mo \"too\" is affixed to each ( 一 mo — ク だク, =botli — and). When the series is not closed, that is, when, only a few speci- mens of a possible list are piven, ya or dano is affixed to each. Ya is always, and to, except in formal speech, usually, omitted after the last word. However the asyndetic construction is not uncommon in Japanese ； e.g., oya ko parent and child.

Dogs and rfoxes. Horses and (ク\" ) clogs and cats. Parents and friends. Shopkeepers and peasants. Relations like the cases in European languages are expressed by means of the particles ga (NominativeY^;?^ (Genitive) . ni (Dative)^and liiQ (^Arciisative)- J^nrtlier, what we i:all the subject in Enjrlish_ is often_ distineuished by the particle wa. But this particle is also attached to the word that becomes in English the grammatical object ； and it may be added to the particles no, ni，.wo， de, and to other words. To explain fully and systematically the uses of wa and its relation to ga would only confuse the beginner at this stage. Reserving more particular rules for later occasions, we shall now endeavor to state the main principles from which they are derived. I. .simply marks ont fhe subject^ excluding Other things, while^^/z indicates that an important predirat-e is to follow. Kore ga wariiu This (not the others) is bad (warm is bad). Kore wa warui. This is bad. The former sentence answers the question, Which is bad ？ Ihe It is a safe rule not to use wa when there is no occasion to think of two or more possible predicates. Hence in subordinate clauses the subject almost invariably requires ga. Taro kimashita toki ni yuki jutte imashita. Snow was falling when {toki ni) Taro came. 2. Wheii subjects only are contrasted is affixed to both. When predicates are contrasted so as to put a word ia ona sentence in antithesis to a word ia another, both require wa^ Zen wa (good) nase (do) ； aku wa (evil) n ひ su na (do not). Do good and not evil. Note that wa、 not wo, is attached here to what we should call CHAPTER II 4 The Noun. [It the object. Logically zen and aku are subjects. It is a corol- lary of the above rule that wa may properly be used with the emphatic word in a negative sentence. The foreigner often finds it hard to tell whether he ought to use wa or ga with the subject. There are cases in which wa only may be used, and other cases in which ga only is permis- sible ； but often it depends on the point of view which is to be chosen. Sometimes in the same sentence either may be used with practically no difference in the sense. It may be in place also to warn the beginner that the usage is subject to consider- able variations in the dialects. Vocabulary. aniru duck リ： lomestic). hato dove, pigeon. karasu crow, raven.

Adjectives similar to the above, ending in i， may be used attributively, in which case they precede the noun. They may also follow the noun as predicates, requiring^ no verb. It should be remembered, however, that the simple adjective is thus used only in familiar talk. See Ch. XI. Exercises. Sh'ka ya kitsune wa hay ひひ Kono ktjt wa umai, ano a Not to be confounded with kom ひ、 which now denotes a full grown male horse. b Women usually say oishii. c Kono and ano are used before nouns like adjectives. d When several words are joined by to or タ <?, wa or ga is added only to' the last.

Doves are beautiful. Ihose calves are large. Duck is delicious. This horse is bad. This dog is black ； that dog is white. A white dove is beautiful. Cranes are large. CHAPTER III. Wa does not designate a particular case. As we have inti- mated, it serves to isolate a word or expression, to make it con- spicuous. Often it may be translated. \" In regard to.\" It is used with especial frequency after words denoting time and place. Konnichi wa (to-day) yoi o tmm desu. It is fine weather to-day. Konnicm wa implies at least a laiiit contrast with other times : else wa would not be used. Compare : Konnichi kaeriinashita. He returned to-day. Konnichi wa kaerimasen. He does not return to-day. The second sentence implies, \" he may return later.\" After —a word with wa beginning the sentence the grammatical subject naturally requires グ\", unless a second contrast is emphasized. Koko wa sainusa ga tsuyoi. Here the cold is severe (strong). In case we wished to contrast the cold ana the wind, it would be : Koko wa sainusa wa tsuyoku nai keredomOy kaze wa tsuyoi. Here the cold is not severe, but the wind is high. a Wa or ga is usually omitted when mo is used. 6 The Noun [i 1 r> A sentence like \" The fox has a long tail,\" becomes : Kitsune wa ひ ga nagai. Here we observe that the subject with wa is grammatically disconnected from the sentence, while the predicate nagai (longV takes the subordinate subject o (tail) with ga. Nth on wa yama ga di. Japan is mountainous. Literally : lii iwai'd to Japan, mountains are many. Gram- matically yama ga di is a complete sentence, but the expression simolv fills the place of an adjective. Many similar expressions have become idiomatic. Ihe adjectives most commonly modi- fied by subjects with ga in this way are yoi and its opposite. warui : kokoro-mochi ga yoi feeling is good -comfortable. gen-ki ga yoi vitality is good = vigorous, vivacious, lively. tsu-gd ga yoi circumstances are good = convenient. yd-nn ga yoi caution is good = careful. kucnt ga warui mouth is bad = sarcastic. t-)i ga warui temper is bad= ill-natured. sei ga takai stature is high = tall. sei ga hikui stature is low = short. ki ga imp な ai spirit is short = quick-tempered. yoku ga jukai desire is deep = avaricious.

CHAPTER IV, The particle no with a noun corresponds to the ^eiiitive_cas£, and is rendered sometimes by the English possessive, and sometimes by the preposition \" of ，， : Tori no koe a bird's cry.

Ni following a noun, correspondends to the dative case^ Ano kodomo wa haha ni nite iru {iinasu). That child resembles [its] mother. The Japanese idiom resembles the Latin in another particular : Us hi ni tsuno ga aru {ariinasu). To oxen are horns, i. e., Oxen have horns. When a comparison is involved, wa may be added to ni •、 or we may say simply : Ushi wa tsuno ga am. Oxen have horns. The construction with ni is preferred when there is a close re- lation between the objects, and especially when the parts of a person or thing are named. Ningen ni te ga aru {arimasii). Men have hands. Watakushi ni wa imoto ga it at (arimasen).^ I have no [younger] sister. As a postposition ni has various other uses which will be ex- plained in Ch. LXXVIII. We add a few explanations concerning the use of verbs. In Japanese the verb always stands at the end of the sentence^ In nite iru \"are resembling \" nite is the subordinative of the verb 7iiru \" to resemble,\" and iru means \" is ,, or \" are.\" Iru^ when it stands alone, that is, not with subordinative, differs from aru in being used only when the subject is a person or some other living thing. The short forms iru and aru are used only in speaking familiarly, as to members of one's own family or to intimate friends. In polite speech, whether to those of higher rank than ourselves, or to strangers, even if they be of a Ni is not required in : Anaia wa Icasa ga anniasii ka. Have you an umbiella ？ TO The Noun lower rank, we must add to the concluding verb at least the suffixes masti (preset), masho (future or probable), mashita (past). These are added to the stem of the verb. ari-niasu ari-masho ari-mashita i-masu i-masho i-niashita is, are will or may be was, were. There are two classes of verbs. In the one class the form used at the end of the sentence, the conclusive form, is derived J^y adding rti to the stem. In the other class the conclusive form substitutes u for the i of the stem. In. the vocabularies verbs of the former class are distinguished by the use of the hyphen, thus : i-ru^ ni-ru. In Hepburn's Dictionary verbs are arranged according to their stems, as ari\\ in Briiikley's, according t ひ their conclusive forms, as im, aru. Vocabulary. abura fat, oil, blubber. ha tooth. hune feather, wing. hari needle, sting. hige beard. tsume nail, claw, hoof. 一 tsuno horn, feeler. koke or uroko scale (of fish). musfu insect, worm, bug. cho, cho-cho butterfly. hachi bee. hai house-fly. ka mosquito. kirigirisii cricket. noim flea. eoi shrimp. ok ami wolf. saru monkey. ni-ru resemble. i-ru be (of living things);, live. aru be (in existence or in one's possession), nai not existent, not pos- sessed (polite : arimasen), yoku well, frequently. taku-san much, many, in great quantity.^ Exercises.

VII] No SUBSTITUTED FOR Ga 13 CHAPTER VII. The predicative expressions giyen in Cb III. may also be used attributively by substituting no for ga : O taku no jocku wa genki no ii {yoi) onna desu. Your maidservant (lit. m. of your house) is a lively woman. Sei no takai hito desu, [He or she] is a tall person. Such expressions occur frequently in Japanese and may be variously translated : Aiama no okii sakana. A fish with a large head. Okii ataina no sakana would be very wrong. Nor would it be euphonious to repeat a noun, thus : Ano onna wa genki no ii onna desu. The reason why no mav be substituted for is that g-g was orig-inally a genitive particle. See Ch. IV. As such ga is still used in the literary language and occurs in many proper names : Ume-ga-tani plum-valley. Tsuru-ga-oka crane-hill. The verb \" is \" or \" are \" after a oredicate noun becomes de tfriTTcontracted to da), ae arimasu (contracted to desu). de ^rozarimasu (or de gozaimasu)^ the last being most polite and the first most familiar.

One of the components may be an adjective ： ao-mono green things, vegetables, from aoi. waka-dan7ta young master, from wakai. Numerous compounds are formed by the use of the prefixes 0 great and ko small (in a few proper names 6) ： d-kaze great wind, typhoon. o-mizu great water, flood. d-atari great hit (in the theater or speculation), d-mugi barley, ko-mugi wheat. ko-yubi little finger. ko-zutsumi parcel, from tsutsumi bundle. 卜に しい ko-zo little priest, apprentice, errand-boy.^,, , ' ko-goto little word, i. e.， complaint, from koto word. 0-miya great shrine. 0-yama little mountain. But it must not be presumed that such compounds may be formea at will, nor that a word forming a compound with one of the two prefixes may form one with the other also. a Boys in former times had the hair closely cropped or shaved, like priests. i6 The Noun [vin 3. One of the components may be a verb. In genuine し hi- nese compounds an object-noun loUows the verb that governs it, but in the case of pure Japanese words the oDject-noun precedes. This distinction, of course, does not apply where the verb is intransitive or where the noun is the principal com- ponent and the verb has the nature of a modifier. hi-tsuke incendiary, from hi fire and tsuke-ru applv ； but tsuke-bi incendiary fire. mo7io-morai beggar (more commonly kojt/et ), from mon ひ thing and morau receive : but morai-mono gift. mono-oki storeroom, from oku put ； oki-mono an ornament kept in the toko-no-ma (alcove of a room). tate-kata style of building, from tate-ru buiia and kata mode ； or taie-ydy from yd manner.^ sei-shi manufacture of paper, from sei make and shi papeiv s ha- shin photograph, from sha to copy and shin truth. jt-shin earthquake, from j《 earth and smn (intr.) to quake. Some nouns occurring in compounds are rarely, if ever, used alone ； e. g., ya house, firm, tradesman. The Cninese ka (house) is in Japanese similarly used, but only of persons. kusuri-ya druggist. ionya (toi-yci) wholesale store, from tou inquire. kencntfiu-ka architect, from ken-chiku building operations. fuhei-ka grumbler, from fu-hei dissatisfaction. tai-sJiok'ka gourmand, from tai great, shoku eat.

[horses, ba-sha any vehicle drawn by gwai-kokti foreign country. p-shin earthquake. ken-kiva quarrel. kin-jo vicinity, neighborhood. a Shi-kata and shi- yd are similarly formed from the stem of the verb suru to do. 1 hese words are daily used by every one who speaks Japanese. Shikata ga nai, or Smyd ga nai. There is no help for it (no way of doing).

Watakushi wa 7vakariviasti. I understand. IVakai-iniasen. I don't know. In some localities ivakarimasen also means : I cannot agree ； it won't do ； it is impossible. d The beginner may find it difficult to distinguish md and mcid ひ. The latter is commonly associated with negative ideas and may be used alone in the sense of \" not yet.\" Ala da samni. It is still cold, it is not yet warm. Aid means \" still ，， only in such expressions as ind hiiotsn still one, one more. e Words like this, corresponding to our prepositions, follow their nouns and should be called postpositions.

In the next sentence js^anda is the name of a district in the same citv, from ka7)n god and ta paddy- field. g When an interrogative sentence is fcrnied with a word like doko, the subject (or object) of the English sentence often takes iva. Ka may be omilled when interrogative pronouns or adverbs are used. h Ilei or hai is a mere interjection ineaniii<j that the speaker is attentive to the words tvhich have been addressed to him. Sayd is used in the same way, when reflection is necessary before an answer can be given. i A town on the Nakasenddy one of the great hit'^hways of Japan. i8 The Noun [viii okii kwaji ga s、 kuna ひ Yube no kwaji wa tskebi de atta kere- domo, sono hi wo ts， f^eta mono wa b inada wakarimasen.

' IX] Compounds 19 CHAPTER IX, 1. There are also compounds in which Chinese and Japanese words occur together : jd-l?ukuro envelope, from jo (c) letter and fiikitro sack. ju-bako set of lacquered boxes, from ju (c) pile up and hako. moto-kin capital, principal, from nioto basis and kin (c) money. yu-to hot water vessel, from yu hot water and tj (c) tub. Such mixed words are called jtibako-yomi or yuto-yomi. Ya- rn i means reading, 01' the pronunciation of the Chinese ideo- grams. If both characters in jubako were given the Chinese sound, they would read jJi-sd ； if Japanese, kasane-bako. So yuid is often read yu-oke and motokin, gwan-kin (c). 2. In many compounds the words retain their proper meaning and in translation must be separated by '( and ，， : sai-sni (c) wife and child (ren), family. o-fuku (c) or iki-kaeri going- and returning', jo-ge (c) above and below (also ue-shita), up and down. 3. In some cases there have been changes in the sound ： akyudoy akindo merchant, from aki (nai ) trade and hito. nakodo a go-between (in marriage), from naka middle and hito.
