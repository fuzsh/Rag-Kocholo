        "text": "Both are generic shounen series on the surface, but are enjoyable regardless. They both take place in a school dedicated to defeating the supernatural and both stories revolve around the students, mostly. The main characters also both deal with being demonic.\n\nreport Recommended by RedBardIsCool\n\nBoth Anime styles are the king you would find in those nice child friendly movies you might watch for Halloween. They have a wide cast of characters and things get crazy as the plot progresses. Both series are action packed.\n\nreport Recommended by Yemi_Hikari\n\nWhat to say? Stories are mainly different, but overall they still share some mentionable point: • well, let's start saying that they both are famous shonen that share the same action, fantasy, supernatural genres • both evolve around special schools/academy who teach our characters how to use their powers • both have a various number of characters, be it protagonists or villains, with strong and likeable personalities • both stories deal with defeating the evil, in SE are the witches and the Kishin (sort of demon), while in AnE is represented by the ultimate evil: Satan • overall both are enjoyable series but there's one last thing to mention. Both anime end up having a \"filler ending\", or better say: they are concluded with something definitely not canon to the story of the manga. Yes i think you should be warned about this, as it's quite an important thing when it comes to anime adaptations. That said, i think if you liked one of those you might probably like the other as well!&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by EtnaEraclea\n\nBoth animes have student studing in a big academy to fight demons. In soul eater they are demon hunter. In Ao no Exorcist they are demon exorcists and they go out slaying demons with teacher supervision sometimes, just like in Soul Eater. The stories are very similar except in Ao no exorcist they have their own weapons, unlike in soul eater where they had the meister and \"weapons\" which were actually another person.\n\nreport Recommended by BlueNishiki\n\nHomogenous shows with a school setting training to become a specialist in some sort. In SE, they work hard to be strong weapons and meisters. In Ao no Exorcist, they attend school, well, obviously, to be exorcists. Friends helping each other, having fun and serving the people of their land. Both shows will be extremely entertaining especially if you are a fan of unique fighting scenes, backstories, school themes and so on. Also, they both became indepedent and rebelled from the manga.\n\nreport Recommended by connielas\n\nHonestly, when I first started watching Ao no Exorcist, I felt it screamed Soul Eater. I mean, not only are the art styles similar, but Rin (the protagonist) reminded me greatly of Soul. Even then, as you continue to move forward through the series, you'll be able to make more and more comparisons. For instance, Faust is a lot like Lord Death, having that same wackiness. There are a lot of other similarities, like similar humor and such. But regardless, you should take the time to watch this.\n\nreport Recommended by NightsofDawn\n\nAo no Exorcist and Soul Eater are action anime that have a \"let's team-up and save the world\" feel to them. They both take place in a special special academy, which trains young teenagers to become fighters that stand against Satan and his henchmen in Ao no Exorcist, and demons in Soul Eater. The characters in both series are simply AMAZING, each having their own unique look, personality and fighting style. Both series also feature superb animation mixed with amazing action sequences that will make the viewer beg for more after each fight. If you are a shounen anime fan and you liked watching one of them you shouldn't hesitate to try out the other.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by FireHeart\n\nBoth deal with a group of students in training to become great fighters in the war against demons/the supernatural. They have intense plot lines but are injected with enough humor to keep it from being too serious. However, the drawing style for Ao No Exorcist is a bit more wispy and edgy than for Soul Eater which uses a more cartoony style.\n\nreport Recommended by Melkmeid\n\nBoth series features supernatural themes in a supernatural world where the main characters learn new skills. They are considered shounen and often or not, their battles incorporates such themes. Both series has a lot of drama, comedy, and action. Both series' main male protagonist also have similar personalities. Both series also has powerful antagonists that puts not only the main characters and their friends at risk but the world as well.\n\nreport Recommended by Stark700\n\nBoth anime involve demons/demon slaying, and both involve an academy\n\nreport Recommended by omgLASERpewpew\n\nWhether you're the son of the devil or a team of weapon and meister, in order to become better at what you do, you need to learn the basics at school. Both anime follow a group of students who attend one of many magic schools. Watch them learn about friendship, morals, strength and see them grow as they fight witches (Soul Eater), or even Satan himself. (Ao no Exorcist)\n\nreport Recommended by Mangetsu-san\n\nBoth are shounens that in both the group of main Charcthers are in a school that teaches about defeating their enemies(Which is demons in blue exorcist and demons/witches/and other Halloween related things In soul eater)\n\nreport Recommended by Ozzey\n\nSoul Eater and Ao no Exorcist are alike because both deal with gifted kids who to a school that teaches them how to fight things such as demons. Both have humor and main protagonists that like to slack off.\n\nreport Recommended by theotakumonster\n\nboth have a spooky/halowen atmosphere to them both have great action scenes both involve a supernatural school (with clownish yet powerful principal) both have their GREAT seiyuu cast both are shounen anime that have ended.\n\nreport Recommended by Kaiga-Tagami\n\nschool, group of students together, quite similar, both awesome gotta watch\n\nreport Recommended by LostChapter\n\nI did enjoy Soul Eater more... However, I finished watching that anime a while ago, and it has been difficult to find an alternative. Blue Exorcist had a similar feel, and offered a nice change of pace. Both stories involve a 'school with a difference'. One where young students can hone their skills, with the aim of vanquishing evil and protecting others. In Blue Exorcist, Satan's forces (including demons) materialise as the principle threat. And in Soul Eater, young meisters are tasked with tackling the menace of witches and Kishins. Characters from both series stand out as individual, each offering a variety of different skills and abilities. However, focus on teamwork and friendship remains key, as bonds are tested through trial and tribulation. The styles of animation are very similar. Clean, crisp, and easy on the eye. You are also presented with well coordinated fight scenes and the odd twist and turn to keep you on your toes. In addition, the level/style of humour is similar. It is worth noting that both anime veer away from the manga's at different points in the story. Blue Exorcist also only has half the amount of episodes. If I may be unceremonious, I thought that Rin was awesome! His haphazard, hot-headed, yet caring nature keeps you entertained. &nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Kenji_Kun\n\nThese two shonen anime both involve an academy, there's elements of horror, and the balance of drama and comedy is similar.\n\nreport Recommended by SugoiChappy\n\nLooking for humor combined with a progressive action filled story that revolves around magic, mythical creatures and other dark sorcery? Then look no further. Soul Eater and Ao no Exorcist are extremely similar in art style, setting, character development and overall tone. The main characters in both these Anime series have goals to achieve greatness and reach powerful titles. However they acquire help from their friends. Both Anime's encourage teamwork, friendship, leadership and many more traits. Overall for both of the Anime's story is steadily paced with unique characters and well balanced genre elements.\n\nreport Recommended by XNekoro\n\nBoth are centred in school/academy where they learn to fight against supernatural forces, and both have a similar theme of self discovery and teamwork.\n\nreport Recommended by bessimajamal\n\nBoth start out very strong with an interesting premise and loveable characters and awesome fight scenes. Both also have disappointing anime-filler-endings but much more awesome-completely-different manga endings. Soul Eater's manga is finished though, while Ao no Exorcist's isn't at the time of writing.\n\nreport Recommended by clarissassin\n\nYour typical shounen anime with good arcs and fight. Both are must watch anime atleast once in your anime carrier,. Lots of demon/youkao with a big character pool who gets decent development. Good side-comedy.\n\nreport Recommended by GiantQAACSleier\n\nThe plot's are very different however both these anime have the same feel to them- that Shounen adventure that won't let you sleep till you've finished all the episodes. Also if you like kids fighting demons both these animes are full of what you;re looking for. Not only is there action, but also plenty of comedy. These animes will leave you inner Shounen satisfied.\n\nreport Recommended by padlock14\n\nAo no Exorcist and Soul Eater are very similar because they both are about killing demons and they both have an academy where they learn to do that.\n\nreport Recommended by JakklL\n\n- Both the anime share almost the same type of story. - Both anime involve fighting against supernatural creatures. - Their worlds are related to after-life. - Some of the characters are demons/supernaturals.\n\nreport Recommended by One\n\n- In both there are special academy, which prepare the fighters with evil. In Blue Exorcist it is presented with a Satan and his henchmen. In Soul Eater- demons. - The warriors are teenagers, of course. All of them fight with their own style. - Both contains great action and a stellar cast. - Both animes are very dynamic and the pace is very similar. - Both animes give you a good amount of suspense and adventure a balance of comedy. - Both have the whole, \"let's team-up and save the world\" feel to it. - Both stories feature supernatural happenings in a classic high school setting and offer typical shonen tropes. - Both appeal to gothic aesthetics and feature plot points addressing difficult family relations (Father-Son, Brother-Brother relations in Blue Exorcist and Father-Daughter, Mother-Daughter in Soul Eater). - Both have a refreshing fun feel to it. So enjoy.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by AreyKyoya\n\nBoth of the series follow an exorcist type story and both of the stories have a large scope. Both are also very action heavy but also very character and story driven.\n\nreport Recommended by YoshikuniTaiki\n\nIt is similar because they are action anime with a dark comedy twist. They grip you emotionally towards the characters, and both have are good with quick paced action. Also, they have plenty of times where they can make you laugh. The down biggest down sides to them are that Ao no Exorcist, or Blue Exorcist, ends too soon due to major events in Japan at the time, and Soul Eater starts off weak, in my opinion, though I stayed for the strange style that feels both unique and obvious at the same time.\n\nreport Recommended by Alec_KS\n\nThe humour is so similar. Both have ridiculous characters who play off each other really well, but also have serious storylines. The action is also reminiscent of Soul Eater\n\nreport Recommended by demision\n\nBoth shows have: - Academy setting that aims to teach the students to exterminate \"special\" beings - A rather funky/bizarre setting and cast of characters - A heavy focus around group of students that happen to be involved in different kinds of adventures and happenings Despite being very much different in art style, the atmosphere and vibes are very much alike for both shows.\n\nreport Recommended by dePuddi\n\nthe anime heavily focus on the extermination of souls/demons. I think they both show a lot of thematics like teamwork and working as a group to defeat the enemy. The anime heavily applies on the fact that trying to solo a powerful anime will result in defeat and also the use of 'Plot Armor' isn't quite used just under some circumstances when its like the final fight of the shows\n\nreport Recommended by LowIqSalty\n\nBoth series have action, fantasy, and supernatural themes. Very similar because both of the shows revolve around school and killing demons. The story telling and protagonists have the same vibes.\n\nreport Recommended by Khunime\n\nDemons? Check! Comedy? Check! Both of these anime are for people who don't really want to invest their souls (heehee!) into an anime with a super serious storyline. Yeah, they both do have their serious moments and awesome fights, but they have some good comedy in there too. The only extreme difference is that one series is about eliminating demons with the power of the church while the other is about using demons to eliminate demons.\n\nreport Recommended by gengrie\n\nBoth anime are about \"gods\" (Soul Eater: Shinigami). In both anime, some characters can change into a weapon and be used by their partner. In both anime, the \"gods\" (can) fight some sort of a monster that isn't human or another normal animal. They're also fun to watch. :)\n\nreport Recommended by SD_CV\n\n1 person weilding another person who can turn into a weapon, It has that Bones humor where its really animated but really tries to put away the humor for serious moments.

In battle, characters are able to wield weapons that are incarnations of their partners. As flashy as it sounds, they offer a host of powerful abilities that can turn the tide of a battle. The main characters from both series has a hotblooded personality but is down to earth when it comes to casual conversations. At the same time, they do truly care about their partners and the people around them.\n\nreport Recommended by Stark700\n\nPeople can turn into weapons and be used by their master.\n\nreport Recommended by ChillPhil\n\nCommon elements: [x] Deep exploration between friendship and partnership [x] Weapons and humans [x] Comical relief [x] Supernatural causes [x] Colourful cast of characters that act neither black or white to add complexity [x] Solving cases to make the world a better place [x] Carry action packed scenes in each episode Watch Soul Eater if: You want a story about learning and changing oneself and dealing with other characters relationships. It follows different characters and each having their own unique perspective. It is more heavier on action, and the art style is more simple, but it has a nice halloween feel to it. Watch Noragami if: You want to match comedy and action, and are interested on focusing with a few characters. This one also deals feelings from the current and afterlife, along with vulnerability of Shinto gods.

Also the art has big meaning in both anime. We can find something special in every characters appearance in Soul Eater (for instance, Soul's teeth or Maka's eyes), the same is with Noragami's characters (Yato's eyes, Yukine's hair and eyes, Hiyori's \"tail\"). And they are enjoyable too.\n\nreport Recommended by Nannuka\n\nSame humor, same animation studio and in both animes, a \"person\" become to a weapon.\n\nreport Recommended by dahfydd\n\nBoth contain the idea of having a person be able to turn into weapon, and using that weapon to slay some kind of spirit.

In Soul Eater, they use these weapons to defeat 'demons'. In Noragami, they fight 'phantoms'. There's an immediate understanding that souls can be consumed by darkness. Not only do main characters run into these dark beings, but they encounter other people paired up with a weapon that has human-form. The lead characters in both are especially motivated. Putting in hard work towards their personal goal. The music is also similar in both shows. That might be because they come from the same studio, Bones.\n\nreport Recommended by JakklL\n\nBoth series are involved with people turning into weapons and their connection with their master and both series are invovled with deafeating evil spirits their are many similarities with their plot and setting and ideas.\n\nreport Recommended by IsabelleKouppi\n\nSimilarities: human's soul as a weapon, gods, gags, strong relationships, fighting style, action.\n\nreport Recommended by ohnoyouwont\n\nInvolvement of supernatural worlds and monsters are always welcome.\n\nreport Recommended by Nownownownow\n\nSoul Eater use people weapons premise.In Soul Eater, they use these weapons to defeat 'demons'.

Both anime revolve around human weapons and gods (shinigami in Soul Eater’s case). The comedy and feeling is very similar in both, with Soul Eater being a bit more over the top IMO. The characters are similar too. Yato reminds me of Soul Eater Evans and Hiyori reminds me of Maka. The art styles are very different, however. Noragami has a normal anime artstyle, while Soul Eater has a more cartoonish artstyle. If you want anime that has human weapons, watch Soul Eater and Noragami.

Both contain comedic charms and lovable and stupid characters that we can’t help but fall in love with. Both dive into the struggles of partnerships between friends and strangers, and what it is people are willing to sacrifice to achieve popularity or win a fight.

Both have reasonable \"power ups.\" All episodes that could be considered as \"filler\" seem to fulfil an important role in both shows, thus giving us few unimportant episodes. Exorcists and students are very similar, as they both fight 'demons' to save the world secretly. Both are reletively gothic in style, though D. Gray-man is much darker. They both have their serious and comedic moments. Both have AWESOME opening themes. Each character (Exorcists and students) all use unique weapon fighting styles and techniques, and the weapons tend to develop their own unique personalities, almost becoming characters themselves (In Soul Eaters' case, obviously, they are characters.) Both have eccentric leaders that give out missions (Lord Death vs. Komui) and both have tall, powerful, long red-haired, womanizing, alcohol-prone characters that have close ties with one of the main characters (General Cross vs. Spirit), as well as a crew of powerful fighters that come in and help midway throughout the series (Generals vs Death Scythes). Both series also have peculiar villains and intriguing antagonists that almost get as many fans as the protagonists (Ashura + Witches vs. Earl and the Noa).

If you're looking for a dark shounen with a strange sense of humour, D.Gray-man is for you. If you want a lighthearted shounen with a relatively raunchy sense of humour, go for Soul Eater. They are both action-centric anime about teenagers with unique weapons that are used to destroy corrupted souls. These anime also share similar flaws, in that they both have quite a bit of filler (Soul Eater especially).\n\nreport Recommended by DrHorrible123\n\nBoth have a serious plot (though D Gray Man's anime's plot is more serious than Soul Eater, Soul Eater is more intense in the manga :P) and they have moments of humor in both animes that I really really love, plus both emphasize on friendship, teamwork and scarifice :D\n\nreport Recommended by nocturnallights\n\nD.Gray-Man has the same style.

The first protagonist, Maka, wields a scythe name Soul Eater. She is the daughter of the current Death Scythe (the weapon used by Shinigami aka Death). The second is Black Star, a ninja, and his weapon of choice it Tsubaki, who can transform into various ninja weapons. The third student is Death the Kid, Shinigami's son, who wields Patricia and Elizabeth, a pair of guns. The seeds, are very similar to Hollow.

I don't know if this matters to anyone who sticks to one or the other.\n\nreport Recommended by Icy_Auron\n\nIf you think bleach could focus more on teenage drama, jokes, boobage, and general silliness, then this is for you. If you like how bleach can be very serious, then you will find this childish. I don't mean to sound to down on a show that I'm recommending, but it's prettymuch a ripoff of bleach's plot but changed around to appeal more to a younger and/or unisex audience rather than only males. Soul Eater has more jokes, and more fan service.\n\nreport Recommended by kaptain_kompost\n\nThey both involve shinigamis and taking souls.

Their worlds contrasts with the law of nature along with the modern world. The main male protagonist from both series are hot headed but does care about his friends and companion. The main female characters contrasts quite a bit from both series but do also play some pivotal roles in the stories. They often encourage their companion to believe in themselves at what they do.

They both have whimsical characters, backgrounds, and situations. Staz (the main character of Blood Lad) looks very similar to Death the Kid as well, and they both have quirky personalities. They both fall under the fantasy genre and have similar creatures like werewolves, demons, ghosts, etc. They both remind me of each other and they are both excellent series.

While the storyline differs between the two, both anime have an identical art style and tone, with Soul Eater having better production values, less fanservice, and more action. Also, Soul is very similar to Staz!\n\nreport Recommended by SebCyrSC2000\n\nI found Soul Eater to have the same atmosphere as FMA. There are some episodes that are hilarious, and some that are just creepy. There's great character development in both of these along with epic fighting. The first few episodes are the intro, and then the story takes off afterwords. The art work is amazing (at least in HD) It's dark, comic, 3d, 2d in a 3d environment, and colorful. I'd say the main difference is that Soul Eater isn't as depressing. Both of them are great series to watch.\n\nreport Recommended by Manga_sama\n\nBoth animes contain a lot of action, comedy, and something that the characters strive for, which is unrevealed until later in the story. i love both of these animes. perfect for people who like action and adventure. also, both have protagonists about the same age, relatively young, as Edward in FMA starts as 12, then the story moves forward to when he's 15 and Alphonse is 14. They gradually age, making note several times in the anime and once in the movie. Unique to Soul Eater, however, is the almost comical reference to witches, etc. and the fact that the characters themselves become weapons (though it depends on how you look at it, as Edward's automail arm can be considered a weapon as well as part of him/his body.)&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by animeaddict9696\n\nAn amazing anime, full of action! A perfect example of shounen, i recommend\n\nreport Recommended by Natyyds\n\nTwo of Square Enix's greatest shows and were also, along with Eureka 7, the first series to run for 51 episodes. They both create the perfect balance between a gripping storyline, epic fights and appropriately used light-hearted humour. Each shows a great amount of character depth and growth and they both use characters with their own personalised fighting styles (eg. different types of alchemy and different kinds of weapon partners). Also if you watch the dub you'll recognise a lot of Funimation's top voice actors in both. If you liked one of these I would highly recommend the other - they're both addictive!\n\nreport Recommended by risemboolranger\n\nwhile watching these i noticed that if you remove all the humor in them, they become seriously f*cked up, evil and sadistic, but they're both great anime and and the humor in these two is hilarious! the characters are very unique and awesome and the plot is great, although i was kinda disappointed with the ending of soul eater.\n\nreport Recommended by Akira-Shimizu\n\n-Very similar animation, since both are done by studio BONES. -FMA also uses the concept of \"alchemists\" as human weapons, except in Soul Eater, it's more literal. -Both have high quality dubs. -Very similar atmosphere. -Both stray away from the original source material to make a unique story with the manga's concepts. -Both have supernatural ideas. -Both have serious as well as humorous episodes. -Both are equally long(51 episodes)\n\nreport Recommended by LPGeneratorx\n\nBoth are fantastic shounen anime from Studio Bones that deal with darker themes than most in the demographic.\n\nreport Recommended by LoveLikeBlood\n\nBoth are fantasy anime which have a very large cast of characters. They both also run for the same amount of episodes (51). They both also have an ending that is only for the anime. The difference is Soul Eater has a comedic tone, while Fullmetal Alchemist has a dramatic tone.\n\nreport Recommended by AndieJ\n\nHas a very similar idea, with a bunch of filler and a large cast but still keeping everything coherent Both are heavily reliant on their action and comedy. Both descend from \"happiness\" to madness. Both have minor psychological aspects, nearer the end\n\nreport Recommended by PatViBrittania\n\nIf you like Fullmetal Alchemist, DEFINITELY check out Soul Eater. It was made by the same studio, Bones, so the animation is gorgeous. At least I think so. (I might be kinda biased, Studio Bones is easily my favorite anime studio.) The stories are pretty different from eachother, but the characters in both series are incredibly likable, and both have really awesome fight scenes. They're also both way shorter than your average shounen anime, and they avoid a lot of the annoyingly overused tropes in the genre.\n\nreport Recommended by HammerMeister99\n\nFirst versions of a shounen manga serialized in Shounen Gangan. Adapted by Bones with 51 episodes each. Both have original endings, but FMA was adapted again after the manga ended.\n\nreport Recommended by KitsuFrost\n\nVery similar animation, since both are done by studio BONES. -FMA also uses the concept of \"alchemists\" as human weapons, except in Soul Eater, it's more literal. -Both have high quality dubs. -Very similar atmosphere.\n\nreport Recommended by Ridzaxster\n\nBoth have the same shounen-ness to them and they both deal with characters searching for power\n\nreport Recommended by RedBardIsCool\n\nThey both have a light-hearted (and sometimes perverted) sense of humor, same style of drawing, same style of characters.\n\nreport Recommended by theobviousalias\n\nIf you see black star and naruto you will find similiar clumsy character.Because they both have the same idiotic that alway's rushing into thing's without thinking first.they also have strong will & dream.That why i recomended this serial because they both funny,and if you like naruto series i confident that You also like this series.Please Enjoyed!\n\nreport Recommended by TX-1000\n\nThe art style for Soul Eater actually is rather similar to Naruto's in the fact that it uses rather thick lines and bright, solid colours. Even the tone of the anime is similar, adding light-hearted and funny moments in-between epic action. Soul Eater injects a bit more humour than Naruto, but they both do a good job of relieving tension with humour at the right moments. Both anime focus on building up the quirky characters (which are very lovable and memorable) as they progress further into their world and as they get into more fights. Both stories are essentially following the main characters getting stronger and maturing as they strive towards their ultimate goal.&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Overcooled\n\nNaruto relates to the character Black Star in Soul Eater very much(as mentioned by others)--the difference is that Black Star is much cooler(IMO). Both animes have a similar relation with the characters being mediocre at first and eventually grow stronger. Soul Eater however is fairly more organized in episodes and actually has an ending(also, it didn't exceed over 100 episodes!). There's lots of your humour and action just like Naruto too.\n\nreport Recommended by hakumeia\n\nSome of the characters resembles each other like... Black star and Naruto who thinks they're better than everyone else Death the kid and Sasuke who are bad asses maka and sakura who feels the need to be stronger\n\nreport Recommended by aprilfreak101\n\nWhen watching Soul Eater i instantly thought \"this is like naruto only a bit cooler\" Both have characters coming out of a school where they are trained to fight at young ages and get put into dangerous situations leading to fighting some sort of ultimate evil.\n\nreport Recommended by OzzyOtaku\n\nThere are a lot of resemblances between the two. Some of the main characters are like main characters from Naruto. Me and my friend joke around and try to assign a Soul Eater character to a Naruto character. So far we have matched Kakashi, Naruto, Sasuke, Kabuto, Orchimaru, and the Mizukage.\n\nreport Recommended by zayber\n\n1. In Soul Eater, they have powerful wavelengths and they try to control it. Same as Naruto, they have strong Chakra and they have to control it. 2. Both anime have groups of 3: Maka, Death the Kid and Black star. And Naruto, Sakura and Sasuke. 3. Naruto and Black☆Star both love attention.\n\nreport Recommended by kappermix\n\nSoul eater is very similar to Naruto as it about groups of young people who fight. It might not be long and it might have shallower plot but it's better made with nicer sense of humour and not that long. Extreme similarities can be seen on some charachters such as Naruto and Star.\n\nreport Recommended by JakklL\n\nSoul Eater and Naruto are very similar because they both contain great comedy and fight scenes. When I first started watching Soul Eater, the first person that reminded me of Naruto was Black Star. They're both loud and obnoxious, but do care about their comrades intensely. Black Star also reminds me of Sasuke because they have similar back stories. Then there's Maka, who reminded me of Sakura because of their kind and caring personalities and also their tendency to punch/chop people that annoy them. There are so many other people who remind me of the characters from Naruto, but if I listed them I would probably spoil it for you. Then there's also the comedy that made me crack up constantly. There were also some pretty heartfelt scenes and sad back stories but they weren't as sad as the ones from Naruto. Even though there aren't any couples, you will probably end up shipping a lot of the characters. So, if you enjoyed Naruto or Naruto Shippuuden and you think there are too many episodes or you don't want to put up with lots of filler episodes, then I recommend that you watch Soul Eater!&nbspread more\n\nreport Recommended by Scarlet_witch"
