        "text": "Masaru Sato (佐藤 勝, Satō Masaru, May 29, 1928 – December 5, 1999) was a Japanese composer of film scores.\n\nContents\n\nMasaru sato mesu\n\nMusical style\n\nSelected film scores\n\nReferences\n\nHe was born in Rumoi, Hokkaidō, and raised in Sapporo. While studying at the National Muscademy, Sato came under the influence of Fumio Hayasaka, Akira Kurosawa's regular composer for his earlier films. He became a pupil of Hayasaka's, studying film scoring with him at Toho Studios, and working on the orchestration of Seven Samurai (1954). When the older composer died suddenly in 1955, leaving the scores to Kenji Mizoguchi's New Tales of the Taira Clan, and Kurosawa's Record of a Living Being incomplete, Toho assigned Sato to finish them. His first original score was for Godzilla Raids Again in 1955. He wrote the music to all of Kurosawa's movies for the next decade, including Throne of Blood, The Bad Sleep Well, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, and Red Beard. In addition to Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Sato worked with Hideo Gosha."
