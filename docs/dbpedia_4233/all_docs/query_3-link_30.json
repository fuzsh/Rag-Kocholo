BY THE METHODIST PUBLISHING HOUSE TOKYO, JAPAN The basis of this book is the first volume of the series of Lehrbucher des Seminars far Orientalische Sprachen, publish- ed at Berlin in 1890. Its author, Df. Lange, before his appoint- ment at Berlin, had been for a number of years instructor in the German language at the Daigaku Yobimon (Preparatory School to the University) in Tokyo. Since that time all his •energies have been devoted to the task of making his country- men acquainted with the Japanese language and literature. My own experience as a missionary student of the lan- guage having proved the value of this work I prepared an English edition which was printed at Sendai, 1901-1903. After I undertook the task Dr. Lange sent me copious notes -of corrections and additions gathered during his ten years' ex- perience as a teacher. Justice to him requires me to state that I used the material thus graciously placed at my disposal with .a very free hand, for several reasons. In the first place Dr. Lange had prepared his book with the needs of a German student in view, and while the needs of an English-speaking student are in the main the same, there are many cases in which an explanation intended for the one will not help the other. Secondly, Dr. Lange's notes were in many instances mere suggestions, very fruitful indeed, but not fully developed. And, finally, I felt that I had one advantage over the original author in that I had used his text-book when I first learned my Japanese, and was thus in a position to test it as he could not. My subsequent experience in the use of the language had revealed omissions not so apparent to the author himself. Accordingly it was my aim to recast all the material in such a way as to make it most helpful to the English-speaking student. This book is not a translation and Dr. Lange is not responsible for any errors that it may contain. 221154 IV PREFACE If I had been permitted to remain in Japan I might have undertaken a complete reconstruction of the work ; but that is out of the question for the present. A call for a second edition having come unexpectedly soon, I have had time only for a superficial revision, with constant reference to the second German edition, which appeared at Berlin in the early part of this year. The new Lchrfyich contains eight hundred pages, of which the last two hundred are devoted to an entirely new German-Japanese vocabulary. Since students now have access to a very satisfactory English-Japanese dictionary it does not seem necessary to include such a feature in the English edition. The improvements in the body of the new German edition were largely anticipated by the former English edition, in the preparation of which, as has been stated, Dr. Lange generously co-operated with me. Accordingly, in the main, the arrange- ment and the paging remain as before. The selections at the end have been somewhat increased. The aim of the book is pedagogical rather than scientific ; hence the combination of system and no-system and the num- erous repetitions. The pedagogical principle has been applied, for example, in the study of words. When it seems likely to aid the memory of the student to indicate the origin of a word, this is done ; but when the etymology is disputed or apt to be confusing, nothing is said about it and the student must learn the word as a whole. The repetitions in most cases are not accidental but designed. For the student must pass through three stages to become master of an idiom- First, he needs to be thoroughly convinced that there is such an idiom ; secondly, he must learn how to use it, and, thirdly, after he has entirely forgotten its existence he needs to be reminded that he cannot get along very well without it. A truly scientific grammar of the colloquial is yet to be written. But in one respect this work may claim to be scienti- fic : it has been the constant aim of Dr. Lange, and of myself, to set forth the language as it is actually spoken by the Japan- PREFACE V ese themselves, not as we would speak it. The sentences have all been taken from the mouths of Japanese and repeatedly reviewed and criticized by competent Japanese. The senten- ces to be translated from English into Japanese were first writ- ten out in Japanese and then translated into English with a view to retranslation. Dr. Lange acknowledges his obligations to Mr. Tsurutaro Senga and Mr. Tsuji Takahira, who assisted him with his two editions respectively. In the preparation of the former English edition, at every step I leaned heavily on my colleagues and friends Messrs. Tadashi Igarashi, Jiro Maeda and Iwae Irie. The proofs of the present edition have been read by Mr. J. L. Cowen and reviewed by Prof. Isao Matsuda. Thanks are also due to Rev. H. K. Miller and Mr. Cowen for invaluable assistance.

INTRODUCTION THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE The Japanese Language is the mother-tongue of about 50,000,000 persons. In Japan proper, excluding the recent accessions to the Empire, such as Taiwan (Formosa), the native population is linguistically homogeneous, with the ex- ception of a few remnants of the aborigines. Even the Ainu, of whom about 18,000 may still he found in Hokkaido and Saghalien, are being rapidly assimilated. The relation of the Japanese to other languages has not yet been satisfactorily determined. The attempt to discover an affinity with the Aryan languages a has, it must be said, not been successful ; for the words that are identical or even similar are too few to justify the inference of a common origin. The same criticism is applicable to the attempt to establish a relation with the Semitic languages.b A comparison of Japanese roots with those of certain Altaic languages, such as the Mongolian, Tungusic, Manchurian, Turkish, etc., does not bring us any nearer to the solution of the problem. c Neverthe- less Japanese is usually regarded as belonging to this great group of Altaic languages, for the reason that it has in common with them the characteristic known as agglutination. That is, in Japanese, as in all agglutinative tongues, inflection in the ordinary sense is replaced by a loose attachment of par- ticles to the stem as suffixes, while the stem itself remains com- paratively unaffected. But it must be noted that the colloquial as compared with the classical Japanese seems to be in a state of transition from the agglutinative to the inflectional stage. In regard to syntax also the Japanese is very much like some of the languages that belong to the Altaic group, e. g., the Manchurian. SINICO-JAPANESE With Chinese the Japanese language proper has no relation whatever. In the former, words are properly monosyllabic and frequently end in consonants ; in the latter they are mostly a See Transactions of the Asiatic Society Japan, Vol. II., p. 199 tf. b Japan Evangelist, October, 1906. C Grunzel, Entivurf einer vei'gteulienden Gratnmatik der altaischen Sprachent Leipzig, 1895. x INTRODUCTION polysyllabic, the syllables being uniformly composed of a vowet or of a simple consonant followed by a vowel. a The syntax too is utterly different. Yet Chinese is of great importance in the study of Japanese, even of greater importance than Latin is in the study of English. Through the study of Chinese literature and the Buddhistic scriptures (which came to Japan in the form of Chinese translations), the importation of the Chinese arts and sciences, and the adoption of the ideographic script, it has come to pass that a great mass of Chinese words and expres- sions has found entrance into the Japanese language, in nu- merous cases even supplanting the native terms. Accordingly modern Japanese is a mixture of native elements and words borrowed from the Chinese and possesses a rich vo- cabulary. For many ideas there are both Japanese and Chi- nese terms. Of the latter the greater number are not under- stood except in educated circles. Many, however, have become thoroughly naturalized; e.g., sen-taku laundry. b In many instances the Chinese expressions have supplanted the native. Thus, for example, the modern peasant calls thunder rai (c)- rather than kami-nari. The dictionaries are full of classical native words which are understood only by those who make their study a specialty. The common use of words derived from the Chinese is due not simply to the natural liking for foreign terms, but much more to the fact that the demand for new words expressing new conceptions is most easily and conveniently met by form- ing compounds from the Chinese. These are often remarkable for conciseness. \" Telegraph \" is den-shin, from den lightning and shin tidings. Marconi has no sooner perfected his great a The only exception is n. But in genuine Japanese words, like shinan (classical future of shimt to die), the n is derived from inn. All other words ending in n are either imported from other languages or of onomatopoetic character. b It rarely happens, however, that foreign terms are regularly inflected like genuine Japanese words. The rule is to regard them as substantives, adding sum (to do) to form verbs, na or no to form adjectives and ni to form adverbs. Sometimes a single woid may serve all these purposes; e. g., teki-to suitability, tekito suru be suitable, tekito na suitable, tekito ni suitably. But we also have such regular verbs as tekitau, tekitattc oppose, from teki-tai ; rydru, ryotie cook, from ryo-ri ; shikeru, shikette be stormy, from shi-ke ; guchiru^. guchitie be silly (rare), from git-chi; taijirn, taijite subdue (rare), from tai-ji, and the adjective hidoi, from hido. Some nouns, like nma horse and zeni cash,, hive been so transformed that few suspect their Chinese origin. INTRODUCTION xr invention than the Japanese have a new word ready for the dictionary ; namely, mu- sen- den- shin (inn- sen without line). \" Automobile \" is ji-do-sha (self move vehicle). \" Concrete \" is yu-kei (having form) ; \" abstract,\" mu-kei. The exigencies of our own time have called forth an immense number of new scientific and philosophical terms which the dictionary-makers have been quite unable fully to compile. In order to speak correctly it is often important to know whether a word is of Japanese or of Chinese origin especially in using the honorifics and the numerals. a This distinction will be easy to make after a little practice. The Chinese vocables are very short. Monosyllables containing a long vowel or ending in « are generally of Chinese origin. These vocables usually occur not singly but in compounds, mostly - of two components. There are, however, a few hybrid com- pounds (Ch. IX) like our own \" automobile.\" The pronunciation of the words taken from the Chinese is very different from that now in vogue in China. b Originally derived from certain Chinese dialects, it has apparently suffered great phonetic changes in the course of time, so that the Chi- nese cannot understand it at all. The classical pronunciation now taken as the standard by educated people is the kan-on (lit. sound of Kan). Kan or Han was the name of the dynas- ties that reigned in the north from B. C. 206 to A. D. 264. c But many older words, especially those connected with Bud- dhism, are pronounced according to the go-on. Go or IVu, at the time when Chinese literature was introduced into Japan, about A. D. 300, was one of the three Chinese states and in- cluded the provinces south of Shanghai. More modern sounds are known as to-on, To or Tang- having been the dynasty reigning from 618 to 913. Excepting proper names, there are very few words that follow the toon, the most common being an- don lamp (old style), cho-chin lantern, fu-ton cushion, tern- bin balance, fu-shin building operations, etc. a Another case in point is that of the word teki (different from the tekfs above), used in formal speech as a suffix to nouns derived from the Chinese. The rule is that before a Chinese word no particle is needed, but before a native word no must be added ; . g., from ri-so ideal and nin-gen man, riso -teki ningen ideal man, but riso-teki no kuni ideal country. b See Lange, Einfuhrung in die japanische Schrift, p. 70 ff and Cli amber- lain, \"Introduction to the Study of Japanese Writing,\" p. 372 ff. c Kan often means \" China \" in general, but like almost all Chinese words, occurs only in compounds; e. g., knn go Chinese words kan-ji Chinese charac- ters, kam bun (for kan-bnii] Chinese composition, etc. See also p. I22a. XII INTRODUCTION In a few words, such as nan south, the pronunciation has not varied. But in Mei-ji enlightened rule, myo-nichi to-mor- row (»«:>&• day) and Min the- Ming dynasty, the same wofd has three different pronunciations. So the character shan in Skan-hai Shanghai is sko \\nkan-on and/<5 in goon. Practically only the kanon and goon need be taken into the account, and the student need not trouble himself much about the differences between them. Usually the goon is distinguished from the kanon by association with old Buddhistic terms. Compare : Goon nin nichi dai sai kon on gyo myo hyo kyo sho gon motsu mon e g* gwatsu riki Kanon jin jitsu tai sei kin in ko met hei kei sei gen butsu bun gwai kwai ka getsu ryoku Japanese English hito man, person hi day okii great nishi west ima now koe, oto voice, sound yuku, okonau go, perform na tsuwamono miyako tadashii kotoba mono fumi soto shit a tsuki ckikara name soldier capital right word, speech thing letter outside picture under moon, month power Not infrequently one word may be pronounced in both ways •without changing the sense ; e. g,, 7o-kyd or To-ket (east capi- tal). In most cases usage allows only one or the other. Thus we say sai-kyo west capital, i. e., Kyoto, but sei-nan southwest (lit. west south) ; myo-ji family name (lit. name character), but sei-mei the full name (family name and personal name) ; ge-kwa-i surgeon (lit. external branch physician), but gwai-koku foreign country ; bimbj-nin pauper, but gwaikoku-jin foreigner. The tones or accents of the Chinese are disregarded, except in the composition of Chinese verses. This fact and phonetic decay have brought it to pass that ten, twenty or thirty characters may have exactly the same sound. This is the a The Japanese equivalent of an ideogram as distinguished from the Chin- ese sound (on) is called koe* kun (c) explanation, or yonii reading. INTRODUCTION xnr most distressing feature of the spoken Japanese language. Men of the same set or clique have no difficulty in understand- ing their own technical terms, but to the uninitiated, even though they be well educated, rare Chinese compounds convey no sense until the speaker by writing in the air or by explana- tion indicates what the ideograms are. WORDS DERIVED FROM WESTERN LANGUAGES In comparison with the Chinese the number of words im- ported from the European languages is small. Thus we have from the Spanish and Portuguese biidoro (yidrio) glass (mod- ern glass, garasit), kasuteira (castilla) sponge cake, kompeito (confeito) candy ; from the French, shabon (savoii) soap, shap- po (chapeau) hat ; from the Dutch, kohii (koffij) coffee, don- taku (zondag) holiday ; from the German, chifusu (Typhus), torahomu {Trachoma) granular eyelids, etc. Many words have lately come in from the English ; e. g., baiorin violin, boto boat, burashi brush, dokko dock,/ura?ieru flannel, JutobZru football, haikara (lit. high collar) a foreignized Japanese, hankechi handkerchief, inki ink, irumineishon illumination, kalstiretsu cutlet, matchi match, naifu knife, peiji page, pointo switch (on a railway), raujpu lamp, famune lemonade, sandu- ichi sandwich, shatsu shirt, shichu stew, sutekki stick, suleishon station, tonneru tunnel, .etc. From the English through the French : bifuteki (bifteck) beefsteak. Buranketto blanket has beccme ketto.* THE STANDARD COLLOQUIAL In English there is now only a slight difference between the language of an essay and that of everyday conversation. In Japanese the written language and the spoken language have for centuries been developing separately. Scholars absorbed in the study of the ideograms and the literary style associated with them, have been quite indifferent to their mother-tongue proper. Even now it is hard to find a Japanese with any sense of colloquial etymology or grammar. When asked about the origin and significance of a word your informant proceeds to discuss the ideograms used to write it. Ask him about the conjugation of a verb, and he gives you paradigms from the a There are also a few Japanese words in Eui-opem languages; e. g., the Spanish biombo, from bydbu screen, moxa (p. r45a). kimono, riksha, jujitsu, etc. xiv INTRODUCTION classical grammar which have little or no application to the matter in hand. The Japanese have scarcely begun to make a serious scientific study of their own conversational language. On the other hand, of the few who are interested, some reveal their inherited prejudice against zoku-go (vulgar language) by limiting its province to the small talk of everyday life. The student cannot be too wary in accepting Japanese opinions about the colloquial. But it goes without saying that in the language actually employed by the Japanese of the present day our authoritative guide must be found. It can no longer be said that the colloquial of Tokyd is normative. Tokyo too has its dialectical peculiarities. We shall not go far wrong if we regard as the standard the langu- age spoken in the higher educational institutions of the Empire. There is here a constant circulation and intermingling of teach- ers and students from all parts of the country, and it is here that the process of crystallization is going on most rapidly. This language of the schools, which will naturally be the lan- guage of the future, is being influenced both by the literary lan- guage and by English and other foreign languages. No obstacle should be placed in the way of the gradual assimilation of any needed material from the comparatively more terse and expressive literary language. The ideal of the G em- bun-it- cki- kwai {gen speech, bun literature, it-chi union, kivai association) necessarily involves the modification of the colloquial, which in its present condition does very well for story-telling, but for other literary purposes is rather a clumsy instrument. Again, Japanese is being modified by the influence of English much as European languages have been influenced by Latin. The student will soon perceive that the speech of a Japanese versed in English is much clearer to him than that of a Japan- ese of the old school, even when both are speaking to their own people. As nearly all Japanese students are learning English or some other European tongue, the inference is obvious. The development of the language has been most rapid around the centers Kyoto and Tokyo. The most peculiar dialects are those of the northern and western extremities of Japan proper. Thus, for instance, in Tokyo one may say. IVatakushi ni kudasaran ka. (Won't you give it to me ?), while in the dialect of Satsuma this becomes. Atai tawawan ka. These dialects in many points preserve more of the classical language than the standard colloquial. For example, the people of the INTRODUCTION xv the north say yogambei (it may be good), from yokaru-beshi, thus preserving the classical beshi. In the ports there is a good deal of pidgin- Japanese (Yoko- hama-kotoha), which is to be avoided ; e. g., peke=-dame bad, spoiled. The student ought also to be on his guard against the slang of the laboring classes. PRACTICAL HINTS It would be well for the student before he begins work on this book to go through a briefer course of the nature of a primer. To get a general idea of the genius of the language it is well at the outset to read rapidly a book like Chamberlain's \" Handbook of Colloquial Japanese,\" not stopping to master the details. Imbrie's \" English- Japanese Etymology \" will be found helpful later on. During the first year it will be a saving of time to employ as a teacher one who has a good knowledge of English. The teacher should be instructed when reading the Japanese sentences to vary them as much as possible. The :-tudent after translating into English should retranslate into Japanese. He will then be well prepared to take up the second set of exercises. If the teacher knows no English, have a friend instruct him how to proceed. Read to him the Japanese sentences one by one and have him criticise the pronunciation. Let him then ask simple questions which require the student to give the substance of the sentence in his replies. Let the teacher repeat each answer, correcting it as he does so. Don't let him ask questions about the grammar or definitions of words. Then translate the English sentences and ask the teacher to correct the translations in the same way. In transla- tion it should be the aim of the student to render the ideas of the original in as brief a form as possible, translation word for word being quite out of the question in nearly all cases. When learning words the student should try to form in his mind a vivid conception of the actual thing or act or relation expressed by it, without reference to English equivalents. The measure of one's progress is the degree in which the untranslatable elements of the language are mastered. One peculiarity of the Japanese must be kept constantly in mind, namely, the persistent consciousness of the relative rank of the speaker and the person addressed as shown in the choice of words and grammatical forms. For the same idea there may be two sets of expressions, one used when the xvi INTRODUCTION subject is a despised person or one's humble self, the other be- ing reserved for use when the subject is a person for whom one wishes to show respect or when it is necessary to guard one's own dignity in dealing with an inferior. It is not easy even for a native to observe the proper distinctions without being either rude or excessively polite. The Japanese are extraordinarily polite to foreigners, and foreigners are expect- ed to speak a little more politely than a native would under the same circumstances. No progress is possible without the perpetration of ridiculous mistakes, and the time, when one is still obviously \" green \" is the most opportune time for mistakes. The people are natu- rally generous and indulgent to newcomers. So the beginner is advised, whatever may have been his previous habit, to make it a rule to chatter about any and everything under the sun to anybody that will listen. As soon as he comes to feel sensitive about mistakes progress will be very difficult. HELPS FOR FURTHER STUDY The student who has mastered this text-book should be fa- miliar with the grammatical structure of the colloquial and be well acquainted with about five thousand words. It is not practicable, even if it were desirable, to include more in a book of this character. In the selection the aim has been to gather a fully representative vocabulary of words that are in common use. Of the common terms, for every one that has been taken one or two have been left. The terminology of one's special business or profession will be learned almost without effort. But if one aspires to be able to converse freely on any subject of common interest, at least double the number of words con- tained here will be needed. A vocabulary grows only by prac- tice, but practice is dependent on observation, and to prepare one's self for exact observation printed books are indispensable. It is a common experience that an entirely strange word just learned from a book may be heard several times within a few hours afterwards. Colloquial literature consists mostly of stories and speeches of various kinds. There are a few collections of extracts in roinaji, of which the best are : Lloyd, Colloquial Texts , Plaut, Japanisches Lesebitch, Berlin, 1891 ; Benkyoka no Toino, Hongkong, 1892, the little monthly periodical Yachigusa published in Tokyo, 1898-9, and the similar publication Romaji begun in 1905. INTRODUCTION xvn In choosing- books written in the Japanese script the begin- ner should avoid those in which the kana are small or badly printed. Before he undertakes to read poorly printed books or newspapers it is necessary thoroughly to master the kana by the use of the children's first two or three readers or other col- loquial books in which the characters are printed large, if they can be found. The exercises and conversations in MacCauley's \" Introductory Course in Japanese \" satisfy this requirement, but unfortunately the hiragana are written from left to right, an unusual arrangement not easy even for Japanese to read. Of the numerous conversation books Muramatsu's Meiji Kwaiwahen is especially commended. Many of the expressions in Satow's Kwaiwahen have become antiquated, particularly those having references to travel in the interior. Highly to be recommended, though the printing of the kana leaves much to be desired, are the Mukashi-banashi (ancient talts) and Otogi-banashi (entertaining tales) of Mr. I way a. In order to accustom the student to the style of these tales, one of them in romanized form has been included among the selections at the end of this book. Mr. Iwaya, whose now de plume is Sazanami, also edits an interesting periodical called Shonen Sekai (Young Folks' World). Novels will also be very helpful. Older stones such as those of Encho are not so well adapted to the needs of the student as those dealing with present conditions. For students who are interested in the conflict between old and new ideas in modern Japan the novels of Mr. Tokutomi {Hototogisu, Omoiide no Ki, Kuroshio) are recommended. Jn almost any newspaper colloquial material may be found in the form of interviews, reports of addresses, etc., and the volume of literature written in the style of lectures is constant y increasing. But the student will need to remember that to make a genuine colloquial sentence more is required than to end it with de aru, de arimasu or de gozaimasu (beware of \" co!- loquialized \" books !) ; also that a man may be a fine literary writer and yet have a wretched style in speaking. The style of the interesting old sermons of which we have had samples in Shingaku Michi no Hanashi, or Kyuj Dowa, is of course antiquated. xvni INTRODUCTION In the study of colloquial grammar a beginnings have been made by Matsushita, Nikon Kokugo Bunten, Tokyo, 1901 ; Maeha, Nihongoten, Tokyo, 1901 ; Kanai, Nikon Zokugo Bun- ten, Tokyo, IQQ[ ; Ishikawa, Hanaskikotoba no Kisoku, Tokyo, 1901 ; Irie, Nikon Zokugo Buinporon, Sendai, 1902. Excepting the first and the last named, these books are themselves ex- samples of the literary use of the colloquial. In the literature of the Gembun-itchi movement, such as Yamada's Bunrei and Sakai's Futsudun, both published in Tokyo, 1901, may be found illustrations of the colloquial as adapted for use in letters, documents, etc-, and interesting discussions concerning colloquial style. Brinkley's Japanese-English Dictionary is fuller and in many ways more satisfactory than its predecessor, Hepburn's. It is an invaluable treasury to those who have to depend on rjmaji. The student may profitably supplement it by one or more of the native go-ju-on dictionaries, Otsuki's Genfcai= Kotoba no Umi (gen word, kai sea), Tokyo, 1891 ; Mozumi's Nikon Daijirin (dai great, ji word, /-///forest), Tokyo, 1894, or Ochiai's Kotoba no Izumi (izumi fountain), Tokyo, 1899. Of these the first is said to be the most scholarly ; the last, most comprehensive. Some students will be especially in- terested in Churchhill's Dictionary of Military Terms and Expressions. The English-Japanese Dictionary of the Spoken Language, compiled originally by Satow and Ishibashi, third edition by Hampden and Parlett, Yokohama, 1904, is indispensable. Chief among the desiderata is a new edition of Gubbins' Dictionary — a complete classified dictionary of Sinico, Japanese compounds on the plan of that still valued work. a In this book the usual division of the -parts of speech has been followed. In a scientific grammar this would probably have to be somewhat modified: Older grammars of the literary language divide all words into three classes . (i), tai-gen including nouns, pronouns numerals, interjections • (2) yd-gen= haiaraku kotoba (working words), including Ihe verbs and adjectives, which are inflected, and (3) teniivofia, from te, n\\, wo, ha (==iva^ including particles and postpositions. ©rtbograpbp an& pronunciation THE IDEOGRAPHIC SCRIPT As has been remarked, the Japanese have adopted the Chi- nese ideographic script, in which the characters are symbols not of sounds, but of ideas. They are like our Arabic numer- als and mathematical signs, which are variously read in differ- ent languages, but have the same sense everywhere. To read Japanese texts readily one must master between four and five thousand characters. To accomplish this two or three years are required, even in the case of a bright student. But the attempt should be made. Every one who aspires to become so pro- ficient as to be able to understand anything said in his pres- ence and to express himself freely on any subject, must mas- ter the Chinese elements in the language. Generally the eas- iest way to do this is to learn the ideograms, and the easiest way to learn the ideograms is to learn how to write them. The attempt to learn to write beautifully like a native would be in most cases a waste of time, if not an impossible task, but at least the order of the strokes should be mastered. But in the order of time the first and most important task is to get a firm hold on the grammatical structure and principal idioms of the language. The student who is ambitious to \" master \" the language is therefore advised to \" divide, \" that is, to devote his first year to the study of the colloquial an4 postpone the study of the literary language and the characters to the second year. a Printed helps of two kinds will be avail- able, those in kana, the native syllabary, and those in rdmaji> the romanized form. Kan a The Japanese began at a very early date to use the ideograms phonetically, that is, to indicate sounds without regard to the proper sense of the characters. They called them kana, from kari-na borrowed name. This use of the ideograms continues to this day in the case of proper names. Thus America is written A-nie-ri-ka (5H^|v;plJjD) the characters meaning a Those who read The German will be pleased with Dr. Lange's Uebungs- nnd Lese-buch zttni Sttidium der jafaniscken Schrifl^ Berlin 1904. The selections it contains are exclusivley colloquial. xx INTRODUCTION respectively : next, rice, gain, add. a In the same way the ideo- gram for \" root,\" called in Japanese ne, is often substituted for the homonymous character ne, (ini-ne) meaning \" peak,\" as in Hako-m and words like ya-ne roof (ya house). Through this phonetic use of the Chinese ideograms the re came into existence about A. D. 900 two syllabaries called kata-kana and hira-kana, A kata-kana (kata side) is written squarely, being in most cases a side or portion of a common character having the sound represented by it; e.g., T (a) from jjjif, >f (i) from ffi, *r (u) from ^, Jj (ka) from jfJD- The katakana are now used only in formal documents, in writing foreign names and interjections, in telegrams, etc. The liira-gana (/lira) level, ordinary) are characters written cursively and, in most cases, very much simplified ; e. g., $> (a) from $£, V (i) from J£i, 5 (u) fr°m ^i ft* (&<*) from ')j\\\\. Formerly there was a great variety of them, but in our own times the employ- ment of movable types in printing and the policy of the Educational Department have had the effect of practically reducing the number in common use to 48, one for each sound. In the following table we give the hiragana arranged in the order of the go ju on \" the fifty sounds.\" Under each hira- gana is given the corresponding katakana and under that the equivalent in Roman letters, The columns are read in order beginning with the right : a, i, if, e, o ; ka, ki, ku, ke^ kot etc. Most dictionaries now follow this order, the n being sometimes regarded as a variant of /;///. It is to be observed that there is no yi,ye, or wu. To make the scheme complete the corresponding syllables from the first column are sometimes put into the vacant places. Wi, we, wo are scarcely distinguished in pronunciation from i, e, o. It is also to be noted that the Japanese do not say si, ti, tu, hu, but ski, chi, tsu, fu. The table is of great importance for the conjugation of the verb. (See next page). From the syllables in which the consonant is sund correspon- ing sonants are derived : from the k column, ga, gi, gn, ge, go (if *? ^* tf 12*); from the s column, sa, fi, zu, ze, zo \\*f & ^T -t* y*) ; from the / column, da,ji, zut de, do (#•* =f y' ^ K). Such change in the sound is called nigori (lit turbidness, a The extreme of arbitrariness is reached in the case of ?ome pr per names that have been bodily imported from China, where the modern pronunciation approximates original sound. But the Japanese conventional pronunciation is pretty far off sometimes ; e. g., New York is written $J]f ; 'hn-iku. Here the ideograms give neither sense nor sound.

The k column by nigori becomes dat bi, bu, bey bo (s? t* 7* ^< •$?) J by what is called Jian-nigori (Jian half),/^, pi, pu, pe, po (^ u* 7* ^ ;tf). In Japanese writing the marks of nigori are often omitted. There is another arrangement of the syllabary called iroha : i ro ha ni ho he to chi ri nu ru wo wa ka yo ta re so tsu ne na ra inu u wi no o ku yo ma ke fn ko e te a sa ki yu me mi shi we. hi mo se su This is in the form of a stanza of poetry giving expression to Buddhistic sentiment : Iro wa nioedo chirinuru wo; waga yo tare zo tsttne naramu. Ui no okuyama kyo koete, asaki yume inishi, ei mo sezu. 1'hough the blossoms (hues) are fragrant they fall away ; IM this our world who will abide alway ? INTRODUCTION To-day I crossed the very mountain-recesses of mutability ; And saw a shallow dream, nor was I intoxicated thereby. Though these comparatively easy syllabaries have been in existence a thousand years, they have not supplanted the ideograms, but play only a minor role beside them. The Japanese syntax being so different from the Chinese, in ordinary Japanese composition the hiragana are interspers- ed among the characters to indicate modifiers, particles, terminations, etc. Such composition is called kana-majiri, from majiru be mixed. Further, for the benefit of the uneducated, hiragana may be written to the right of the ideograms to indicate the pro- nunciation. This is called kana-tsuki, from tsuku be attached. It is thus possible to read most Japanese books without a knowledge of the ideograms. The traditional spelling corre- sponds to an ancient pronunciation which has been con- siderably modified in the course of time. In the case of native words the syllables of the h column have been most affected. kaharn be changed is pronounced kawarit kahi shellfish „ „ kai ifu say „ „ tu make before „ „ mae hoho cheek ,, M ho But it is in the pronunciation of the Chinese words that the greatest changes have occurred. Thus tou, tau, taju are kll pronounced to (not to speak of towo and toho in the case of native words) ; kiyau, kiyou, keu and kefit (see the iroha above) are all pronounced kyd. Tokyo in kana is spelled toukiyau. The Japanese have been so indifferent to this traditional spell- ing that even among educated people hardly one in ten knows how to spell correctly. There has been a natural tendency to choose the briefest forms, as keu for kyo, sen for s/id, ten for chjy etc. Tne Department of Education three years ago issued a regulation to the effect that sounds like to should invariably be written to — ; sounds like kyo, ki yo — , etc. This reform makes the kana spelling of the Chinese words almost as simple and phonetic as romaji. a a For example, even in the reformed kana the following must be written alike but pronounced differently: kiyo will wear and kyd to-day; katsnte previously and katie one's own convenience. INTRODUCTION xxin RoMAJI The system of romanization adopted for this book is identi- cal with that followed by all the roinaji dectionaries. A fair degree of uniformity has been secured through the efforts of the Roma-ji-kwai (ji letter, kwai association), a society organized by Japanese and foreigners in 1885 for the purpose of effecting a substitution of the Roman script for the Chinese. a A committee appointed by the Educational Department to investigate the question of romanization submitted a tentative report in 1900. The system recommended differs very little from that now in use. The chief innovations are the substitu- tion of si for shi and sya, syu, syo for ska, shu> sho, following the analogy of kya, kyu> kyo etc. Further, the Committee would write ci\\ ca, cu, co for chi, cha, cJiu, cko, following presumably the analogy of Italian. The changes proposed have not been adopted in this book for the reason that the Educational Department has not yet reached a final decision in the matter, and it would be very inconvenient for the student to have in this book a system different from that followed by the dictionaries. b In October, 1905, a new organization was formed, the Rjmaji-kirome-kwai) which publishes a monthly entitled Rumaji. Both of the above forms of transliteration appear on the pages of this periodical : one writer spells shashinjiitsu (photography) and another syasinzitu ! a While much of the Japanese literature, being intended for the eyes, is hardly intelligible without the ideograms, it is quite reasonable to expect that any conversation commonly understood through the ear should be intelligible when reduced to writing by means of an adequate phonetic system. But the full realization of the ideal of the Romajikivai must wait until the teachers, preachers and public speakers of Japan have by a process of natural selection evolved a vocabulary at once intelligible to their hearers and adequate to ex. press thought on every subject, that is, until the spoken language becomes as satisfactory a medium of expression as the present written language is. Forces now at work in Japan will bring this about before very long. b See Kivainpo (Official Gazette), 5, Nov.. 1900. The innovations proposed are comparatively unimportant. Olhers will be referred to incidentally. There ere questions connected with romanization which press for an official solution and in most cases the suggestions of the Committee are excellent. Its report deals largely with the question of the division of words. For instance, the Committee would write oagari iiasai niase for o a^ari uasaiinizse. In regard to this question great confusion now prevails. See also suggestions by Mr. Fujioka in his Roinaji Tebiki, S' inknronsha, Tok) 6, 1906. xxiv INTRODUCTION Romaji is designed to represent phonetically the standard pronunciation of the present day. In reading romaji the general principle to be observed is that THE VOWELS ARE PRONOUNCED AS IN GERMAN; THE CONSONANTS, AS IN ENGLISH. VOWELS As might naturally be inferred, in the case of English- speaking people it is the vowels rather than the consonants that are hard to pronounce. a In English the vowels are largely sacrificed to the accent In Japanese the reverse is true, that is, the vowels govern the accent. What we call the long and short sounds of the vowels in English are really different sounds. In Japanese a short vowel has the same sound exactly as the corresponding long vowel, differing only as an eighth note in music differs from a quarter. b The sounds of the (long) vowels are : a like a in father (a) i „ i „ pique (e) u ,, u ,, rude (oo) e „ e „ prey (a) o ,, o „ hope (o) LONG VOWELS. — The long vowels are written a (aa), ii (z), u (««), ei (?), o (0u).c There are practically no diph- thongs. An is ordinarily pronounced and written o ; in, yu ; a A vowel is called bo-in (mother sound) ; a consonant, shi-in (child sound). b There are exceptions. For a sound very much like the English short \"a\" see kyatto. Before a double consonant or n followed by a consonant there is a natural tendency to modify vowels so as to resemble the English short vowels. c Ii occurs almost exclusively at the end of adjectives, being a contraction of iki or is hi. Theoretically there is a difference between ? (chosen by the Roinaji Committee) and ei, but practically they are not distinguished and we write uniformly ei. In the same way o might be written on, ; and this is done in the case of a verb like you *'• get drunk.' Verbs uniformly end in u. Ac- cordingly we write kau \" buy,\" rather than ko, though the combination a u is in the case of a Chinese word always written o. For the same reason we write kiai eat, rather than ku. The combination in in the case of a Chinese word is written yu the rule having been that u (or fit] following a syllable ending in i makes a long sound, while yu following such a syllable makes a short one. (Thus shi yu results in shtt, buts/iz?* makes shu— in the reformed kana written shi yu—]. But in the case of the verb iu *: say \" we depart from the rule, since the stem is commonly pronounced ii We should, however, write yuu if the stem were pronounced vni. INTRODUCTION xxv eu, yd ; out o. The combinations ai, oi and ui come nearest to being diphthongs.-'1 For the purpose of this discussion n is practically a vowel. In singing it may form a syllable by it- self. It follows that an, in, un, en, on, kau, kin, kun, etc., are long sounds. If one wishes to speak intelligibly, it is a matter of prime importance to DISTINGUISH LONG AND SHORT SOUNDS. It is especially important to distinguish o from o. Next in import- ance is the distinction between // and u. Compare : oi nephew oi many tori bird tori thoroughfare koko here kb-ko filial piety koto thing, affair kj to high class toki time to-ki registration ho hei infantry ho-hei artillery yo-san estimate yo-san sericulture kvki stalk ku-ki atmosphere yttki snow yu-ki courage To the Japanese ear the words in the one column are utterly different from those in the other. There are a few cases in which the length of a vowel is a matter of indifference. A final o is often shortened ; e. g., so shite so doing, may be pro- nounced so shite ; katappb one of the pair, katappo ; honto reality, honto ; benkyo diligence, benkyo- More rarely o may be shortened in other positions ; e. g., iinoto younger sister may be pronounced imoto. Final short vowels are sometimes lengthened ; e. g., sore jd, for sore fa if that's the case. The o in yoku, well, may be lengthened. SHORT VOWELS — The following points deserve notice : U in shu and /a is often pronounced i, especially in Tokyo : e. g., shujin master becomes shijin ; bi-jutsu fine arts, bijitsu. This is to be avoided as a corruption.15 But the substitution of i for yu is not always bad; e. g., t&uforyukM go, kauri ii for kami-yui hair dresser (p. 8303). Initial u followed by ma is practically silent, uina horse be- a In the northern provinces and vulgarly in Tokyo at is pronounced like d ; e. g., Soja net for Soja nai That's not so. In Tokyo ae and oe are often pronounced like ai and oi ; e.g., kaeru return, kairu ; koe voice, koi. We might add to the diphthongs au in kau as commonly pronounced in Toky<\\ In western Japan kau is ko. b In northern Japan people often reverse i and u saying, for instance, utkfsit or even shikous for sukoshi a little. xxvi INTRODUCTION ing pronounced mma (p. lib). E in early romaji texts was generally written ye. This spelling has been retained in the case of only two words, ye \" to \" and yen the unit of currency. The Romaji Committee would practically reverse this rule and write e for the post- position yet but ye in other cases. The fact is that the pro- nunciation depends on the sound that precedes. The y is especially prominent when the preceding word ends in a vowel or n ; e. g., hei shi military service (heiyeki}, meneki exemption from the service (inenyekt). The sound of yen is not en, as many foreigners- pronounce it, nor is the y as distinct as in \" yes. \" O is sometimes corrupted so as to sound like // : e, g., hitotsu \"one\" becomes hitutsu ; asonde amusing one's self, asunde ; kom-ban this evening, kumban. This pronunciation should be avoided. On the other hand in some dialects o is substituted for u; in Niigata sku-fin, master, becomes shojin. Yoi \" good \" is commonly pronounced ii. .As has been said, wo is practically pronounced o. It is so written except in the case of the particle wo (the Romaji com- mittee would write this also o), the pronunciation of which, like that of ye, depends on what goes before. The student must be on his guard in pronouncing a word like sh:o salt, in kana written shi ho. The w is hardly audible, but if the student is not careful he is apt to say shiyo, \\. e., sho. In the same way ki-oku memory must be carefully distinguished from kiyoku purely and kyoku office. When two vowels are brought together in compounds a y or w naturally creeps in ; e. g., £iz-<z/ case, becomes bayai or bawai. The Romaji Committee in such a case would write y after i or ey and w after u or o ; e. g., tsukiyau, for tsuki-au associate ; umey awaseru, for ume-awasefu make up a deficiency ; guwai for gn ai adjustment ; owashi, for o ashi money. The Com- mittee recommended that a list of such words be made, which is an excellent suggestion. QUIESCENT VOWELS. — Words like kyoku, ryoku, etc., derived from the Chinese, were originally monosyllabic, though written with three kana: ki yo kuy ri yo ku. Accordingly in romaniz- ing certain combinations the Romajikwai treated i as silent ; e. g., kyo (ke u, now ki yo — ),etc. Many Japanese would go further and write, for example, kyok, ryok. In native words there are many other cases in which the weak vowels i and u are practically inaudible, but the Romajikwai did not ven- ture to extend its principle to them, probably on account of the INTRODUCTION xxvn extreme difficulty of making rules to cover all cases. Not only- does the pronunciation vary according to locality, individual idiosyncrasy, etc., but even the same word may be pronounced differently by the same person, depending on the nature of the context. Compare, for instance, nakute \" there being none \" and nak'te wo \" though there are none.\" The addition of mo brings upon na and te a strong accent with the result that the u in ku disappears. A silent z or u is very apt to occur when ki> ku, ski, su, chi, tsu, hi, or />/ precede any syllable of the k s, t, and w series, especially when that syllable is accented. Final sit ordinarily loses the vowel and becomes ss, and the vowel in final tsu, ski and chi is barely audible. English-speaking people are apt to goto extremes in clipping final vowels. The Roviaji Committee has recom- mended that a table be made of words in which there are silent vowels. It would write taski for tasuki (cord to tie back the sleeves), dongri for donguri acorn, etc. The Japanese certain- ly do say taski, not tasuki. It is, however, impossible to decide all the cases without being more or less arbitrary. The plan of this book is to follow the spelling of the dictionaries, except in the Exercises, where apostrophes are used to indicate silent vowels. a Experience proves that this system is a valuable aid to correct pronunciation. But to avoid abuse we have been conservative. There are, for example, so many people who pronounce every vowel in tvatakushi that we do not feel justi- fied in eliding the u9 as the Committee does. CONSONANTS These will give the English-speaking student little trouble. G when it does not stand at the beginning of a word is com- monly pronounced like \" ng \" in \" singing \" : Nagasaki, like Nangasaki ; ugnisti bush- warbler, like unguisu ; kago basket or cage, like kango (to be distinguished carefully from kan- go Chinese word). This may explain the presence of the n in the names of the provinces Bingo and Bun go (Bi-go} Bit-go} In a Dr. Lange himself prefers to use the apostrophes throughout. The compiler of the English Edition has ventured to disagree with him in regard to this one point, on the ground that so long as the matter i; not officially determined, great inconvenience in the use of dictionaries will result from any alteration of the present spelling. It seems, however, certain that the Japanese when they once take the matter in hand will elide more fs and it's than Dr. Lange or any other foreigner lias thought of doing. The spelling will in turn react on the pronunciation xx vi ii INTRODUCTION western Japan, however, g is pronounced exactly as in \" ago.\" See p. 6Qa. S before i becomes sh. In some parts of western Japan, as in the vicinity of Osaka and in Kyushu, s in the syllable se is pronounced like \" h \" or, more exactly, like the German \" ch\" ; e. g., omahen for cmasen (dialectical) there is not. • In Tokyo se may become shi ; hence the change of se-ou carry on the back (se back, on carry) to shon. Ji is formed by nigori from shi or chi. In the province of Tosa the two sounds are distinguished, the former/ being like \" z \" in \" azure \" and the latter like \" g \" in \" age.\" In some places the former sound prevails, but in most parts of the country both $? and J~* are pronounced// as in \"jig.\" Zu too should have two sounds, zu and dzu (often written so), from su and tsu, but the distinction is not generally observed and one or the other prevails. T before i becomes ch ; before //, ts. JVis pronounced \" ng \" before sounds of the k series ; before sounds of the h (b, p) and ;;/ series it becomes in: son-kei respect ; son-gai damage ; sambyaku three hundred, from san three and hyaku hundred ; sem-mon specialty, from sen special and mon gate, department. The Rouiaji Committee in such cases would not change the n to in. In some compounds the distinction between a final n and an initial n must be carefully observed. Compare gen- .an original motion and ge-nan manservant. H before i in Tokyo and elsewhere is pronounced like s/i, as in htto person. The student will do well to avoid this corruption. /MS not quite the same as the English \" f,\" being formed by the two lips, not by the lower lip and the upper teeth. The study of foreign languages has, however, a tendency to make the f more like the English. The nigoried form of/\"// is bu, not vu. There is no v in Japanese. In the h series a labial sound,/ or/ not hy characterized the syllables originally, and in some provinces there are still traces of this ancient pro- nunciation. M before u has frequently been altered to b : e. g., eravni, erabu choose ; sainushii, sabishii lonely. Y (,y<*> yu yo) occurs largely in combination with other consonants. One must carefully distinguish myo and miyo, kyoku and kiyoku, etc. In parts of northern Japan y when not combined with another consonant is commonly corrupted to z or/. INTRODUCTION xxix R is not quite the same as the English \" r,\" especially in the syllable ri. The tip of the tongue is held more closely to the upper gum. In many places, as in Satsuma, r sounds like d. It is extremely difficult for the Japanese to distinguish the English \" 1 \" and the English \" r,\" their own r being an inter- mediate sound. The vulgar sometimes trill r\\ e, g., berrabd fool. W after i or / sometimes becomes^; e. g., sorjii, from sore wa as for that. Wa and wo occur largely in Chinese words combined with k and g\\ e. g., kwa-ji conflagration, givai-koku foreign country. In some parts the distinction between kwa and kat etc., is carefully observed, but is neglected in Tokyo. The reformed kana and the Committee's rjuiaji ignore it. But the w is retained in this book, for reasons already indi- cated. There is no need of \" q \" or \" x,\" the former being represent- ed by kw and the latter by ks. DUBLE CONSONANTS. — While the consonants in themselves are not so difficult, the student will need to be especially careful to DISTINGUISH SINGLE AND DOUBLE CONSONANTS. The double consonants are kk, ss (ss/i), tt (tch, Us), nn, pp, mm. The best way to get them is to give a strong accent to the preceding syllable and then for a moment hold the vocal organs in the position required to pronounce the consonant in question. The second of the two will then sound distinct from the first. Distinguish carefully pairs like: ika cuttle- fish ikka how many days ? dasu put forth dassu (rii) escape from i-sho clothes is-sho one's whole life kita [ne] came kitta [he] cut i-chi position it-chi union ana hole anna such ama nun am-ma shampooer Consonants which are single in the literary language are frequently doubled in the colloquial ; e. g., minna for mina all, onnaji for onaji same, itrittsu for mitsu three, ammari for amari too, bakkari for bakari only, totta for toda merely, massugu for uia-siigu straight (adverb). Excepting nn and ;;/;;/, the first of two double consonants is in kana represented by tsn. Gakkj school, from gaku and kdt may be written either gakuko or gatsu&o. The compound hattaltu development is sometimes pronounced hatsudatsu. xxx IN TROD UCTION Nigori. — In a comp ,und a the first consonant of the second member is liable to the change called nigcri : [hair). ]> shiraga gray hair (s/iira = $hiro stem of shiroi white, kami yakizakana baked fish (ya&i stem of yaku roast, sakana fish). shinjin piety (shin faith, shin heart). jinja Shinto temple (jin god, ska shrine). pandanc yeast (pan bread, tane seed). [pa.ck), kwanzuine canned goods (kwan can, tsume stem of tsuinetu tokidoki at times (toki time). chikajika soon (chikai near). sakurabana cherry blossom (sakura> kana). shinjinbukai pious (shinjin piety, fnkai deep). Since the kana for wa in native words is hat this may also by nigori become ba ; e. g., wo wa becomes woba. Nigori is less common in Chinese than in native words, and less common jn compound verbs than in compound nouns. There is a great deal of fluctuation in the usage, euphony being the only guide. Thus we say O-hashi Great Bridge, but Megane-bashi Eyeglass Bridge (so named from its shape) ; either O-saka or O-zaka Great Slope ; an-nai-sha or annaija guide ; sai-han-sho or ' saibanjo court of justice. c In some instances the two forms have different senses ; e.g., chosha an elder or a superior, choja a wealthy person. Nigori is not limited to compounds. The first consonants of some words which are commonly attached loosely to other words suffer nigori ; e.g., bakari only, from hakdru consider. Kiri \" only !' may also be pro- nounced giri ; kurai \" about,\" gurai. Mutsukashii \" difficult \" is often pronouned inusukasJiii. Han-nigori, that is, the change of // or / to p, occurs frequently in compounds from the Chinese when the first member ends in ». Thus fun be stirred and katsu be aroused make Jumpatsu enthusiasm ; man be full and fuku stomach, inampuku satiety. From the native words oinou think and hakaru consider we have omompakaru cogitate. a The vowels suffer little or no change in composition. A final e in the first member of a compound is often changed to a. Thus from kane metal and mono thing we have kanamono hardware (but with hako box, kanebako money box)j from sake liquor and^/rt house (p. 16), sakaya liquor dealer (but with now* stem of nomu drink, sakenomi drunkard). b In western Japan people say shirage from ket which also means hair. c There are two sounds to the Chinese character for « god,\" shin and jin. Compare shin gaku theology, from gaku learning, and jin-ja Shinto shrine. The Japanese, by the way, say Shin do t not Shinto. INTRODUCTION xxxi A preceding syllable coalescing with h or / may result in pp : kiri stem of kiru cut and fu (c) token make kippu ticket; tetsu iron and ho barrel, teppo gun. For other examples see p. 69 ff. Of native origin is hipparu bring along, for hiki- haru. An h between vowels tends to become // : e.g., akep- panasu from akehanasu leave open ; mappira, from uia-hira earnestly. The adverbs yoJtodo very and yahari still are also pronounced yoppodo and yappari. ACCENT As has been intimated, if the student will take care of the vowels, the accents will generally take care of themselves. Among the vowels there is as it were an order of precedence. First there are the long sounds, then a, then o and «?, and finally u and i. The stronger tend to draw the accent away from the weaker. Alternate syllables seem to pair off in the contest, the stronger pair winning. A combination tending to make a vowel quiescent may also affect the accent. When a difference between the vowels does not interfere, a word of three or four syllables is naturally accented on the first and third ; e.g., anata you, hanahada very. The a before the causative ending seru or the potential ending reru is always accented. When a word is a compound, that fact naturally affects accents. a In general it is to be remembered that accent is not so strong as in English. It is one of the disadvantages of romaji that since the words look somewhat like English words the student is apt to give them English accents. To correct this tendency the student who wishes to acquire a natural pronunciation should do a great deal of reading aloud from the Japanese script under a Japanese teacher of the old school, if one can be found who is not afraid to criticise. Kiri. — It is essential to good pronunciation to observe the kiri (lit. cutting), or ku-giri (ku phrase), that is, not to pause in such a way as to cut off particles, etc., from preceding words to which they belong. a In western Japan homonymns are often distinguished by means of the accent. For example, hana flower has a marked accent on the first syllable as compared with hana nose. In the same way they distinguish has hi chop- stick, hashi end, hashi bridge; kaki oyster, kaki persimmon and kaki fence; kami hair, kami pnper and kami god, etc. The Japanese themselves are so much in doubt about these accents that the student can well afford to neglect them. THE NOUN.a CHAPTER I. The Japanese language has, properly speaking, no article, no plural, and no gender. 1. There is an equivalent of the English \" a certain,\" namely, aru (lit. existing) : aru onna a certain woman. More recently this aru has come to be used also with plurals in the sense of \" some.\" To the English article in its generic sense, as in \" the cat \" or \"a cat \" (speaking generally), corresponds the Japanese idiom : neko to iu mono what is called cat (neko cat, to particle of quotation, iu say, mono thing). 2. When there is need of bringing out the idea of plurality, the suffixes ra^ domo (from tomo companion), shu (c) or s/iu crowd, tachi (c) or dachi all, and gata (from kata side), may be employed. These are, with the exception of the first, used only with words denoting persons. The last is the most polite : Hyakusho peasant ; hyakushodomo peasants. Ko child ; kodomo children.0 Akindo merchant ; akindoshu merchants. Onna woman ; onnashu women (of servants girls, etc.). Oya parent ; oyatachi parents. Fu-jin (c) lady ; fujingata ladies. Many words may be made plural by doubling : Kuni country ; kuniguni countries. Hito person ; hitobito people. Tokoro, sho (c) place ; tokorodokoro, shosho various places. The plural may also be expressed by means of words used as prefixes meaning \" many,\" 4< all,\" etc. Bankoku all countries, from ban myriad. Shokoku various countries (or provinces) from sho many* a Jitsu-mei-shi true-name-word, or simply meishi. b The suf?,x ra is in the colloquial used mostly with pronouns. The ideo- gram used to represent it is to \" class.\" Both ra and to may also have the sense of \"etc.\" c The words kodomo child, -wakaishu young fellow (from ivakai young), and tomodachi friend, have come to be used also in a singular sense. To make the plural sense of kodomo distinct, still another suffix must be added ; kodomora kodomoshu, kodomotachi. ,*, •\"* - 2 THE NOUN. [i 3. In the case of animals the masculine and feminine gen- ders may be expressed by means of the prefixes o (pti) and me (men) ; or, more commonly, by osu and mesu wth the genitive particle no '. Inu dog ; oinu (inu no osu) ; meinu (inu no mesu). Tori fowl ; ondori cock ; mendori hen. But it is to be observed that the Japanese usually leave the distinction unexpressed. For instance : Tori ga nakimashita. The (or, a) cock crowed. Here it is not necessary to say specifically ondori.

When nouns are joined by the conjunction \" and \" or enu- merated in a series which is brought to a conclusion, to \" and \" or mo \"too\" is affixed to each ( — mo— mo — both — and). When the series is not closed, that is, when only a few speci- mens of a possible list are given, ya or dano is affixed to each. Ya is always, and to, except in formal speech, usually, omitted after the last word. However the asyndetic construction is not uncommon in Japanese ; e.g., oya ko parent and- child. Bxercises.

Relations like the cases in European languages are expressed by means of the particles ga (Nominative), no (Genitive), ni (Dative), and wo (Accusative). Further, what we call the subject in English is often distinguished by the particle wa. But this particle is also attached to the word that becomes in English the grammatical object ; and it may be added to the particles no, ni, wo, de, and to other words. To explain fully and systematically the uses of wa and its relation to ga would only confuse the beginner at this stage. Reserving more particular rules for later occasions, we shall now endeavor to state the main principles from which they are derived. 1. Ga simply marks out the subject, excluding other things, while wa indicates that an important predicate is to follow. Kore ga warui. THIS (not the others) is bad (warui is bad). Kore wa warui. This is BAD. The former sentence answers the question, Which is bad ? The latter is a reply to the question, What sort of a thing is this ? Who came ? Dare ga kimashita ka. Taro came. Taro ga kimashita. Where is Taro ? Taro wa doko ni imasu ka. Taro just came. Taro wa tadaima kiiuashita. It is a safe rule not to use wa when there is no occasion to think of two or more possible predicates. Hence in subordinate clauses the subject almost invariably requires ga. Taro ga kimashita toki ni yuki ga futte imashita. Snow was falling when (toki ni) Taro came. 2. When subjects only are contrasted ga is affixed to both. When predicates are contrasted so as to put a word in one sentence in antithesis to a word in another, both require wa. Zen wa (good) nase (do) ; aku wa (evil) nasu na (do not). Do good and not evil. Note that wa, not wo, is attached here to what we should call: 4 THE NOLTN.. £n the object. Logically zen and aku are subjects. It is a corol- lary of the above rule that wa may properly be used with the emphatic word in a negative sentence. The foreigner often finds it hard to tell whether he ought to use wa or ga with the subject. There are cases in which wa only may be used, and other cases in which ga only is permis- sible ; but often it depends on the point of view which is to be chosen. Sometimes in the same sentence either may be used with practically no difference in the sense. It may be in place also to warn the beginner that the usage is subject to consider- able variations in the dialects.

They may also follow the noun as predicates, requiring no verb. It should be remembered, however, that the simple adjective is- thus used only in familiar talk. See Ch. XI. Exercises.

Duck is delicious. This horse is bad. This dog is black ; that dog is white. A white dove is beautiful. Cranes are large. CHAPTER III. Wa does not designate a particular case. As we have inti- mated, it serves to isolate a word or expression, to make it con- spicuous. Often it may be translated, \" In regard to.\" It is used with especial frequency after words denoting time and place. Konnichi wa (to-day) yoi o tenki desii. It is fine weather to-day. Konnichi wa implies at least a faint contrast with other times : else wa would not be used. Compare : Konnichi kaerimashita. He' returned to-day. Konnichi wa kaerimasen. He does not return to-day, The second sentence implies, \" he may return later.\" After .a word with wa beginning the sentence the grammatical subject naturally requires gat unless a second contrast is emphasized. Koko wa samusa ga tsuyoi. Here the cold is severe (strong). In case we wished to contrast the cold and the wind, it would be : Koko wa samusa wa tsuyoku nai keredomo, kaze wa tsuyoi. Here the cold is not severe, but the wind is high. a Wa or ga is usually omitted when mo is used. 6 THE NOUN [n: A sentence like \" The fox has a long tail,\" becomes : Kiisune wa o ga nagai. Here we observe that the subject with wa is grammatically disconnected from the sentence, while the predicate nagai (long) takes the subordinate subject o (tail) with ga. Nikon wa yama ga oi. Japan is mountainous. Literally : In regard to Japan, mountains are many. Gram- matically yama ga oi is a complete sentence, but the expression simply fills the place of an adjective. Many similar expressions have become idiomatic. The adjectives most commonly modi- fied by subjects with ga in this way are yoi and its opposite warui : kokoro-mochi ga yoi feeling is good *= comfortable. gen-ki ga yoi vitality is good = vigorous, vivacious, lively. tsu-gd ga yoi circumstances are good == convenient. yo-jin ga yoi caution is good = careful. kuchi ga warui mouth is bad = sarcastic. i-ji ga warui temper is bad = ill-natured. sei ga takai stature is high = tall. sei ga hikui stature is low = short. ki ga mijikai spirit is short = quick- tempered. . t& \\ yoku ga jukai desire is deep = avaricious.

The particle no with a noun corresponds to the genitive case, and is rendered sometimes by the English possessive, and sometimes by the preposition \" of \" : Tori no koe a bird's cry. Nikon no ten-shi the Emperor of Japan. Notice that the limiting noun together with no always precedes the word which it limits. This is one instance of the general rule that all modifiers precede the principal or governing word. In the classical style ga performs the same function as no : Kimi ga yo the lord's (Emperor's) reign. a Ano otoko (that fellow) and ana onna are not elegant. Ano kata wa sei ga takai is better. Still more polite : Ano o kata wa o sei ga takd gozaimasu. b Ano hito, ano kata, etc., may mean either \" he \" or \" she.\" S THE NOUN [iv As in other languages, the genitive may be explicative or appositional.

Note that ko-tori means little bird, not young bird (see Ch. VJII). v] Ni 9 The eggs of this fowl are small. Veal is delicious. The don- key's ears are long. Whale's meat is unsavory. Pork is white.

This white hare's eyes are red. The head of the ox is large. The eyes of the flounder are small. The eggs of the carp are delicious. The head of the fat is delicious. CHAPTER V, Ni following a noun correspondends to the dative case. Ano kodomo wa haha ni nite iru (imasu). That child resembles [its] mother. The Japanese idiom resembles the Latin in another particular : Ushi ni tsuno ga aru (arimasu). To oxen are horns, i. e., Oxen have horns. When a comparison is involved, wa may be added to ni ; or we may say simply : Ushi wa tsuno ga aru. Oxen have horns. The construction with ni is preferred when there is a close re- lation between the objects, and especially when the parts of a person or thing are named. Ningen ni te ga aru (arimasu). Men have hands. Watakushi ni wa imoto ga nai (arimasen)?- I have no [younger] sister. As a postposition ni has various other uses which will be ex- plained in Ch. LXXVIII. We add a few explanations concerning the use of verbs. In Japanese the verb always stands at the end of the sentence. In nite iru \"are resembling\" nite is the subordinative of the verb niru \" to resemble,\" and iru means \" is \" or \" are.\" Iru, when it stands alone, that is, not with subordinative, differs from aru in being used only when the subject is a person or some other living thing. The short forms iru and aru are used only in speaking familiarly, as to members of one's own family or to intimate friends. In polite speech, whether to those of higher rank than ourselves, or to strangers, even if they be of a Ni is not required \"in : Anata tua kasa ga arimasu ka. Have you an umbrella? io THE NOUN [y lower rank, we must add to the concluding verb at least the suffixes masu (preset), masho (future or probable), mashita (past). These are added to the stem of the verb. ari-masu ari-masho ari-mashita i-masu i-masho i-mashita is, are will or may be was, were. There are two classes of verbs. In the one class the form used at the end of the sentence, the conclusive form, is derived by adding ru to the stem. In the other class the conclusive form substitutes u for the i of the stem. In the vocabularies verbs of the former class are distinguished by the use of the hyphen, thus : i-rut ni-ru. In Hepburn's Dictionary verbs are arranged according to their stems, as i, ari\\ in Brinkley's, according to their conclusive forms, as iru, aru. Vocabulary.

C The familiar past tense is formed by adding fa to the stem. d Ga indicates that emphasis rests on ano. The man that planted Ihe trees is that gardener, not some one else. If still more emphasis were needed, we anight say : Kono ki ivo ueta hito lua ano uekiya desu. e When brief mention is made of a single instance the simple subject com- monly requires ga, while iva is used in general statements. The student should observe this distinction in the exercises to \"be translated into Japanese. VIl] No SUBSTITUTED -FOR Ga CHAPTER VII. The predicative expressions given in Ch III. may also be used attributively by substituting no for ga : O taku no jochii iva genki no ii (yoi) onna desu. Your maidservant (lit. m. of your house) is a lively woman. Set no takai hito desu. [He or she] is a tall person. Such expressions occur frequently in Japanese and may be variously translated : Atama no dkii sakana. A fish with a large head. Okii atama no sakana would be very wrong. Nor would it be euphonious to repeat a noun, thus : Ano onna wa genki no ii onna desu. The reason why no may be substituted for ga is that ga was originally a genitive particle. See Ch. IV. As such ga is still used in the literary language and occurs in many proper names ; Ume-ga-tani plum- valley. Tsuru-ga-oka crane-hill. The verb \" is \" or \" are \" after a predicate noun becomes de aru (contracted to da), de arimasu (contracted to desu), de gozarimasu (or de gozaimasu), the last being most polite and the first most familiar. Notice the difference between : Matsn no ki ga arimasu. There are pine trees. Matsu no ki desu (for de arimasu). They are pine trees.

Sama or san is added to names of persons or to titles of important personages, such as tensJii sama Emperor, danna san master of the house. In the case of girls o is always prefixed unless there are more than two syllables. Sama is also used in certain polite phrases, such as o kage sama I owe my good fortune to you (kage shadow), go kuro sama 1 have caused you much trouble. d Notice the circumstantiality of the expression. Shi is a disjunctive particle that marks the transition from one coordinate clause to another. In classical language the simple stem of the verb is used in such a position. Thus art might be substituted in the above for ant ski. Shi makes the transi- tion more distinct. e Instead of repeating sant, we may say o no mijikat no mo aru. i A rivet near Mount Fuji. g A river near Toky5. vm] COMPOUNDS 1 5 CHAPTER VIII. Japanese resembles German in the facility with which com- pound nouns may be formed. Compounds derived from the Chinese are especially numerous. 1. The components may themselves be nouns: sakana-ichi fish-market. oya-yubi parent- finger, thumb. soto-gawct outside, uchi-gawa inside. uri-zane-gao melon-seed-face, i. e., beautiful face. The following are of Chinese origin : kwa-ji fire-affair, conflagration. ba-sha horse- vehicle, wagon or carriage. tetsu-do iron-way, railroad. den-ki lightning- spirit, electricity. tetsudo-basha street car. denki-tetsudo electric railroad. 2. One of the components may be an adjective : ao-mono green things, vegetables, from aoi. waka-danna young master, from wakai. Numerous compounds are formed by the use of the prefixes o great and ko small (in a few proper names o) : o-kaze great wind, typhoon. o-mizu great water, flood. o-atari great hit (in the theater or speculation). o-mugi barley, ko-mugi wheat. ko-yubi little finger. ko-zutsumi parcel, from tsutsumi bundle. ko-zo little priest, apprentice, . errand-boy. a ko-goto little word, i. e., complaint, from koto word. O-miya great shrine. O-yama little mountain. But it must not be presumed that such compounds may be formed at will, nor that a word forming a compound with one. of the two prefixes may form one with the other also. a Boys in former times had the hair closely cropped or shaved, like pries! s. 1 6 THE NOUN [vin 3. One of the components may be a verb. In genuine Chi- nese compounds an object-noun follows the verb that governs it, but in the case of pure Japanese words the object-noun precedes. This distinction, of course, does not apply where the verb is intransitive or where tlie noun is the principal com- ponent and the verb has the nature of a modifier. hi-tsuke incendiary, from hi fire and tsuke-ru apply ; but tsuke-bi incendiary fire. mono-moral beggar (more commonly kojiki), from mono thing and morau receive : bui.morai-inonoglfc, mono-oki storeroom, from oku put; oki-mono an ornament kept in the toko-no-ma (alcove of a room). tate-kata style of building, from tate-ru build and kata mode \\ or tate-yd, from yd manner.a sei-shi manufacture of paper, from sei make and ski paper. ska-shin photograph, from ska to copy and shin truth. ji-shin earthquake, from ji earth and shin (intr.) to quake. Some nouns occurring in compounds are rarely, if ever, used alone ; e. g., ya house, firm, tradesman.

The word is applied to a product which is characteristic of a given locality and so comes to be associated with its name. b Corresponds to ano, kono. Kono may be called the pronominal adjective of the first person, sono, of the second, and ano, of the third. See Ch. XIV. c This verb is properly intransitive and impersonal. Watakushi iva ivakarimasu. I understand. Wakariwasen. I don't know. In some localities ivakarimasen also means: I cannot agree; it won't do ; it is impossible. d The beginner may find it difficult to distinguish mo and mada. The latter is commonly associated with negative ideas and may be used alone in the sense of \" not yet.\" Mada samni. It is still cold, it is not yet warm. Mo means \" still \" only in such expressions as mo hifotsn still one, one more. e Words like this, corresponding to our prepositions, follow their nouns and should be called postpositions. See Chap. LXXVIII. f The name of a bridge in Tokyo (ftas/ii bridge). In the next sentence Kanda is the name of a district in the same city, from /(vzw/god and fa paddy- field. g When an interrogative sentence is fcrmed with a word like dokot the subject (or object) of the English sentence often takes iva. Ka may be omitted when interrogative pronouns or adverbs are used. h Hei or hat is a mere interjection meaning that the speaker is attentive to the words which have been addressed to him. Sayo is used in the same way, when reflection is necessary before an answer can be given. i A town on the Nabasendo, one of the great highways of Japan. 1 8 THE NOUN [vin okii kivaji ga s'kunai* Yube no kwaji wa tskebi dt atta kere- domo, sono hi wo ts'keta mono wa b mada wakarimasen.

There are also compounds in which Chinese and Japanese words occur together : jo-biikuro envelope, from Jj (c) letter a.ndfu&uro sack. ju-bako set of lacquered boxes, fromjw (c) pile up and hako- moto-kin capital, principal, from moto basis and kin (c) money. yu-to hot water vessel, from yu hot water and to (c) tub. Such mixed words are called jubako-yomi or yuto-yomi. Yo- mi means reading, of the pronunciation of the Chinese ideo- grams. If both characters in jubako were given the Chinese sound, they would read ju-so ; if Japanese, kasane-bako. So yuto is often read yu-oke and motokin, gwan-kin (c). 2. In many compounds the words retain their proper meaning and in translation must be separated by \" and \" : sai-shi (c) wife and child (ren), family. o-fuku (c) or iki-kaefi going and returning, jo-ge (c) above and below (also ue-shita), up and down. 3. In some cases there have been changes in the sound : akyudo, akindo merchant, from aki (nai) trade and kito. nakodo a go-between (in marriage), from naka middle and kito.

In the sense of \" at \" or \" in \" de difiers from ni in that it is used to indicate the scene of an action, while ni simply marks the place where a thing or person exists. Tokyo ni tomodachi go. arimasit. I have a friend in Tokyo, but 'J'dkyo de tomodachi ni aimashidi, I met a friend in, Tokyo. b Oru or irp must be used in saying that a person or a living thing is in such and such a place. But : urise ga taktisan arimasu. It is, however, per- missible to use aru even of a living thing when it is in question whether such a thing exists or not. So it is correct to say: Kono kinjo ni o isha san wa anmasen ka. Is there no physician in this vicinity? But here onmasen would be more natural. c An interrogative pronoun as subject always requires ga, never wa. The subject of the answer also requires ga. x] DERIVATIVES 2 1 This shoemaker is dear, but [he] is skilful. My tailor's house (iicht) is distant. My neighbor (tonari) is a photographer.
