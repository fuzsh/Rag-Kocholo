        "text": "FROM her ninth-floor apartment on Fifth Avenue and 93rd Street, Nathalie Cox enjoys a picture-postcard vantage point of Central Park and the interesting configuration of buildings on Central Park West. ''We look out at all this green,'' she said. ''The reservoir is very peaceful. My husband, Marshall, jogs around there every morning.''\n\nOn Fifth Avenue, you have the best of city, country and culture, said Susan Behar as she walked with her toy poodle, Chloe, near her building at 85th Street. ''You walk three steps and you're in a park,'' she said, pointing at Central Park across the avenue. ''At night, it feels like you're in Paris. It becomes a very quiet neighborhood.''\n\nLate on Sunday afternoons, the avenue's doormen snap to attention as cars pull up with residents who had been away for the weekend. Bicyclists soon arrive with delivery packages.\n\nWhile Fifth Avenue runs from Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village to 142nd Street in Harlem, the most prestigious and expensive residential stretch of it faces Central Park on the Upper East Side. Here, brick and limestone residential buildings share the avenue with museums, consulates, private clubs, churches and synagogues. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, mansions were built on this part of Fifth Avenue for families like the Astors, the Vanderbilts and Marjorie Merriweather Post and her husband, E. F. Hutton. Some of the mansions remain, but only a scant few are single-family homes.\n\nAndrew Carnegie's 64-room chateau at 2 East 91st Street was converted into the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1970's. Henry Clay Frick's Louis XVI-style mansion at 1 East 70th Street has a collection of Old Master paintings. And the French Renaissance-style Felix and Frieda Warburg House at 92nd Street is now the site of the Jewish Museum.\n\nHistorically, the most significant block on the avenue is from 78th to 79th, which retains all four of its original mansions, said Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian at Columbia University. The Payne and Helen Whitney House, on this block, at 972 Fifth Avenue, was designed in 1902 by Stanford White and is now the Office of Cultural Services of the French Embassy. Commanding the 78th Street corner of the block is the residence designed by Horace Trumbauer for James B. Duke, now the New York University Institute of Fine Arts.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
