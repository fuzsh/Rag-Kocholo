        "text": "The Upper East Side has a reputation for being home to the wealthy, but even those on a budget can call this neighborhood home. This quiet, lush neighborhood offers a reprieve from the hustle and bustle of downtown. Chock full of history, culture, and green spaces, here’s what you need to know about it before living on the Upper East Side.\n\nThe basics\n\nLocation: The Upper East Side stretches from 59th to 96th Street, with the East River and Central Park/Fifth Avenue as its boundaries.\n\nCommute: Living on the Upper East Side, you won’t be too far from anything. The 4/5/6 trains run along Lexington Avenue through the neighborhood, and the Q train runs along Second Avenue up to 96th Street. These subway systems easily connect residents to Downtown or Lower Manhattan. Getting crosstown to the Upper West Side is trickier, with only a few buses cutting through Central Park. However, if you want to travel to Queens, the F train intersects with the Q train at Lexington Avenue/63rd Street.\n\nSub-neighborhoods of the Upper East Side: Within the borders of this expansive neighborhood are three sub-neighborhoods: Lenox Hill, Yorkville, and Carnegie Hill.Lenox Hill is the largest of the three sub-neighborhoods, encompassing the southern half of the Upper East Side and stretching from 59th to 77th Street. Together, Carnegie Hill and Yorkville make up the northern half of the Upper East Side, extending upwards from 79th to 96th Street. This area is divided in half along 3rd Avenue, with Carnegie Hill as the western and Yorkville as the eastern portion.\n\nIs the Upper East Side a nice neighborhood?\n\nThe Upper East Side neighborhoods pride themselves on being self-contained Manhattan retreats with a more relaxed pace than other areas of New York City. Residents appreciate the convenience, culture, and charm this uptown neighborhood provides. Rent an affordable and spacious apartment here to seek a peaceful and welcoming community with abundant amenities, including museums, cafes, and the inimitable Central Park. You can still discover a bustling nightlife in the Upper East Side if you like to indulge in fresh cocktails or dance at clubs.\n\nUpper East Side today\n\nThe Upper East Side is characterized as an upscale neighborhood known for its prominent cultural institutions, unparalleled shopping, distinguished prep schools, immaculate landscaping, and luxury homes.\n\nAlong its main avenues, particularly in Carnegie Hill, you’ll find evidence of its storied reputation. Park Avenue, Madison Avenue, and 5th Avenue are lined with luxury doorman buildings featuring the signature green awnings, coupled with quiet streets filled with picturesque brownstones and townhouses. Move farther east and away from Central Park, though, and the UES becomes far more approachable. You’ll find more affordable apartments in several high rise buildings and an abundance of smaller, pre-war buildings throughout Lenox Hill and Yorkville.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nThe Upper East Side has diverse fine-dining and casual restaurants across all cuisines. While there may be fewer renowned spots than in the rest of the city, there are plenty of small cafes and bistros, locally-owned chains, and specialty shops serving delicious bites for residents to enjoy.\n\nLiving on the Upper East Side means enjoying H&H Bagels whenever you want. Don’t let the line out the door intimidate you. It moves quickly, and you’ll be eating your indulgent bagel sandwich and muffins in no time. If the line is too long for your taste, check out Bagel Works as an alternative. This small take-out-only spot serves all your morning breakfast needs. Grab a fresh, homemade bagel with your choice of spread or fillings to start your day off on the right foot.\n\nEnter the whimsical world of Alice in Wonderland at Alice’s Tea Cup, Chapter II , in Lenox Hill. Indulge in an afternoon tea, complete with delicious scones, finger sandwiches, and an assortment of sweets with your choice of tea from the wide variety on offer. If you’re looking for something savory, its grilled sandwiches are also delicious.\n\nSandro’s Restaurant , in Yorkville, is an intimate neighborhood spot serving robust Roman-style Italian cuisine. This authentic trattoria keeps guests returning with its al dente preparation of classic pasta dishes. Try the mouthwatering spaghetti cacio e pepe or bucatini amatriciana and they will not disappoint.\n\nIf you want to impress your dinner date, head to DANIEL for a world-class fine dining experience. Daniel Boulud is head chef of this two-Michelin-star establishment, famous for its refined European cuisine and impeccable hospitality. Choose from one of its tasting menus for an extravagant yet satisfying meal.\n\nIn the mood for sushi? Nestling in East 73rd Street and York Avenue, Tanoshi Sushi Sake Bar may look like a hole in the wall, but don’t let that fool you. This no-frills, bring-your-own-bottle-friendly spot serves fresh and affordable maki, sashimi, and nigiri, with the option to add items from an a la carte menu. Due to limited seating availability each evening, online reservations are advisable.\n\nIndulge your sweet tooth and bring home tasty candies from The Sweet Shop New York City. Self-proclaimed candy buffs Kelly and Glyn Jaime created The Sweet Shop to offer nostalgic sweets for everyone to enjoy. You’re certain to find something to satiate your cravings, whether it be ice cream, gelato, or handmade chocolates. Be sure to browse their candy walls, which are full of over 60 different candies and 40 types of licorice.\n\nWhere to play\n\nAlthough people appreciate the neighborhood for being a peaceful slice of life, there are still many things to do on the Upper East Side. With Central Park as your backyard, there’s no better place to be on a sunny day. Jog around the reservoir, bike along the many paths, or relax and picnic on the grass. If you live further east, John Jay Park, Carl Schurz Park, and the East River Promenade are great park alternatives.\n\nImmerse yourself in the rich culture of this neighborhood and explore Museum Mile, home to several of New York City’s prominent museums. See some of the world’s best art collections spanning all periods at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , in Carnegie Hill. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is an architectural marvel that houses modern and contemporary art. The smaller specialty museums are also worth a visit. Check out the Neue Galerie for German and Austrian artwork and the Cooper Hewitt Museum, which focuses on historical and contemporary design.\n\nShop up a storm while strolling down designer-store-lined Madison Avenue. If you’re shopping on a budget, there are several thrift and consignment stores full of hidden gems for you to discover. You can find your typical retail clothing stores along Lexington and Third Avenues.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nIf you’re already living on the Upper East Side, you know it’s not exactly a nightlife destination. In fact, many choose to live here because of its quieter, relaxed atmosphere. That being said, there are still plenty of pubs and bars nearby if you’re looking for a casual place to grab a drink or catch up with friends.\n\nThe Penrose brings the energy of downtown to the Upper East Side. This upscale, yet laid-back, restaurant and bar offers a selection of craft beers, creative cocktails, and noteworthy bar food. Quickly becoming a neighborhood favorite, The Penrose is the perfect stop for a boozy brunch on the weekends or weeknight dinner and drinks.\n\nIf you’re a fan of whiskey and bourbon, Bondurants is your go-to. Featuring an extensive, yet carefully curated, menu with small-batch whiskey, handcrafted cocktails, and a constantly rotating draft, this casual neighborhood bar’s unique offerings make it a standout.\n\nDescend into the hidden, underground speakeasy known as Sugar East. Formerly the Merchants NY Cigar Bar, its tobacco license was grandfathered in, making this lounge one of only eight bars in the city where you can legally smoke indoors. Transport yourself to 1950s Havana with Sugar East’s wood paneled walls and Art Deco accents, and get cozy in one of their leather booths while you sip on one of their tropical cocktails.\n\nFeel like you’re in a small town at Earl’s Beer and Cheese. Despite its location on Park Avenue, this cozy establishment has a decidedly homey atmosphere serving up a rotating selection of craft beers paired with hearty cheese-centric dishes. Order their beer cheese to enjoy with your brew, or, for something more substantial, try their acclaimed NY State Cheddar Grilled Cheese, a twist on the classic sandwich but filled with pork belly, kimchi, and a fried egg on sourdough.\n\nWhat to know about renting in the Upper East Side\n\n1. Diverse housing options:\n\nOne of the first things to note about the Upper East Side is the diverse range of housing options available. From classic pre-war buildings with ornate details to modern luxury high-rises, the neighborhood caters to various tastes and lifestyles. Rental apartments range from cozy studios to spacious multi-bedroom units, ensuring there’s something for everyone.\n\n2. Budget considerations:\n\nWhile the Upper East Side is known for its opulence, it’s essential to dispel the myth that living here is exclusively for the wealthy. While luxury apartments do exist, there are also more affordable options tucked away on tree-lined streets. Prospective renters should carefully assess their budgets and explore the various pockets of the neighborhood to find the perfect balance between elegance and financial feasibility.\n\n3. Transportation accessibility:\n\nConvenience is a hallmark of the Upper East Side, and its transportation options reflect this. With a well-connected network of buses and easy access to the 4, 5, and 6 subway lines, commuting to other parts of Manhattan is a breeze. Proximity to major roads and highways also facilitates travel beyond the city, making the Upper East Side an excellent choice for those who work in different boroughs or even neighboring states.\n\n4. Cultural and culinary delights:\n\nBeyond its residential allure, the Upper East Side is a cultural hub. Renowned museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum are within arm’s reach, offering a daily dose of artistic inspiration. The neighborhood also boasts a diverse array of culinary delights, from Michelin-starred restaurants to cozy cafes, ensuring that residents can satisfy their taste buds without venturing far from home.\n\n5. Parks and recreation:\n\nFor those who enjoy outdoor activities and green spaces, the Upper East Side doesn’t disappoint. Central Park’s eastern edge provides a serene escape, while smaller parks and waterfront areas along the East River offer opportunities for leisurely strolls and scenic views.\n\n6. Community atmosphere:\n\nDespite its upscale reputation, the Upper East Side is not without a strong sense of community. Local markets, boutique shops, and neighborhood events contribute to a lively atmosphere where residents can connect and build relationships.\n\nCommonly asked question about living in the Upper East Side\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nRenting in the Upper East Side offers a unique blend of elegance, cultural richness, and convenience. By considering factors such as housing options, budget, transportation, cultural amenities, and community life, prospective renters can make an informed decision and fully embrace the allure of this iconic Manhattan neighborhood."
