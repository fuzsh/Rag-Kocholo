        "text": "A downed tree stretched across Fifth Avenue near 93rd Street on the Upper East Side Sunday morning.\n\nThe tree fell during Saturdayâs massive rainstorm, crushing cars on both sides of the road and blocking traffic.\n\nResidents told Spectrum News NY1 Sunday morning that they were still in awe a day after the tree came down.\n\nâI park my car right here. I walk my dog right here, and itâs a little frightening, seeing this big of a tree going down in New York City,â said resident Arnie Ursaner.\n\nâVery lucky. I mean, it could just have easily been my car sitting right there,â Ursaner added.\n\nThe city Department of Parks and Recreation was on the scene to clean up the tree Sunday morning.\n\nIt was a challenging operation to clear the tree. City workers started by removing smaller branches before moving onto the trunk.\n\nâSometimes Mother Nature can play tricks, and this was a dirty trick. That poor car over there,â said resident Bob Makarowski.\n\nNo injuries have been reported as a result of the fallen tree.\n\nSaturdayâs weather event caused flooding across the city, including on the Cross Island Parkway.\n\nEven though the rain has concluded, city officials are urging New Yorkers to watch out for black ice on Sunday."
