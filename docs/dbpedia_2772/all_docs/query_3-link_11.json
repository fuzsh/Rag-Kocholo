It's really \"off-topic\" in my mind... :-/\n\nHere's it almost unedited:\n\nhttp://jonathan.chanfamily.org/public/chc2/upper_east_side_pics/audio.wma\n\nHistory of Upper East Side\n\nThe Upper East Side is the Manhattan Board 8. It is from E 59th street to E 96th street, from Fifth Avenue to the East River. [1]\n\nIn 1811, the whole Manhattan island was divided and sold in lots under the Commissioners Plan for New York. But the area of Upper East Side was still undeveloped and barely settled. The area around Third to Fifth Avenue and 65th street to 69th street was tracted out as Hamilton Square. It was intended to be estates. An Episcopal Church was first build there in 1807. In 1837, the land was rented for pasture. Although a settlement started in Yorksville, people can only use horsecar lines and street railroads to get to lower Manhattan. After the Irish potato famine and the Revolution of 1848, large number of Irish and German immigrants moved in the city. Overpopulation caused the expansion of the city, pushing the settlements upward. The increasing density led to the demand and then the building of Central Park. The park was designed to release pressure of the crowded city and to provide more jobs for New Yorkers during the Panic of 1857. According to History of Real Estate, property above 59th street rose over 200% between 1868 and 1873. Rowhouses rose on Madison Avenue, close to the hourecar lines. When the Panic of 1873 stroke, land value drops drastically. In 1878, elevated railroad opened from the South Ferry to 129th street on Third Avenue. And three years later, the Second Avenue one followed. Almost immediately, the population of the Upper East Side rose, and thus browntone-fronted house rose up with the population. There are New York and Harlem Railroad under Park Avenue. Thus the area were developed slower. But east of Park lined up with rowhouses, stables, and carriages houses. Interstingly, Fifth Avenue was the most desirable, but remained under developed until 1890's. Early residence were middle-class merchants and professionals, mostly from Irish and German, especially German-Jewish, descent. Later came the capitalists and other wealthy people of the city. With population growth, other institutions established themselves in the Upper East Sida. Many churches and synagogues were built for the people. The hospitals, education institutions, and religious institutions were also built. And soon, Armory, Asylum, police station, and fire station rose up. From 1880 on, the wealthy started to purchase land on Fifth Avenue and then built their own houses. Besides Central Park, the design of Fifth Avenue also attracted the wealthy to Upper East Side. Since it is right next to the park, the park commissioners put it into consideration and thus the Avenue was wide and extra spacious. Also, trees were grew along the park. Besides the big mansion, the wealthy has space for gardens, areaways, and stoops. The wealthy also built stables and carriage houses around the area. They also brought in Clubs and club buildings. This period of building town houses and mansions lasted around 25 years. After WWI, living in apartment buildings became fashionable. Along with the chnage of trend, the rising land costs and other economic difficulties of maintaining a private residence, the wealthy sold their houses and moved into luxurious apartments in the same areas. The mansions were abandoned. However, the neighborhood remained wealthy and luxurious. Also, the railroad was re-built underground, making Park Avenue more desirable. Thus a mall was built, then followed by luxurious apartment buildings. Town houses and churches rose up as well on Park Avenue. The children of the wealthy who built the mansions were still living in the luxurious apartments. In the 1920's, many commercial shops were built on Madison Avenue, making it a commercial center. As land values increased, institutions like hospitals sold their land for apartment constructions and moved out the area. After WWII, more apartment buildings, although not as grant as the previous, continued to be built. Now, some of the mansions and elegant town houses were used by private institutions, consulates, and the United Nation missions. Thus, they still stand strong in the area, keeping the hgih class of the Upper East Side. Madison Avenue continued to be a commercial center for the area. And the Upper East Side, espeically the Historical District, is still a desirable place in New York City.

Especially that I've read the history of Central Park, I can sort of relate to it. It is intersting to see the part of this particular change. Imaging all the changes they've made since the building of the park. It must be a very long process. Also, it is intersting to hear what people lived around the park actually cared about. They actually walked around the park as their garden. They were concerned about the bicyclist, the strollers, the runners, etc. And they also cared about the appearance of the park, even though it was only a small curve of such a large park. In addition, they cared for the historical landscape and the function as well. It is rather intersting to sit through the Park Committee meeting. It makes me want to walk around the park aften as well. Too bad that I lived at least an hour away.\n\nSusan 05.02.08\n\nJonathan, I'll send you the videos (of the meeting) and the pictures we took last night....and then you can choose which ones to send to ilya...is that ok?? thanks!!!\n\nPhoto Gallery of the Upper East Side 4/27 - Charissa\n\nsorry for the delay, I was away and off track a little.\n\nFrom the buildings we can notice that there are many delicately carved buildings. There are many statuettes and decorative figures and shapes on the walls and doors. From these, we can see that people who used to lived in these buildings must be very wealthy. Now, most of them became museums or private institutions. There are many offices of embassadors from different places. As we walked away from Central Park, the buildings grew taller and less grant. There are many add-ons to the original old buildings. There are also a lot of buildings that were garages. They have a much wider door than other buildings. We can see from these garages that wealthy people used to park their carriages here and maybe ride in Central Park (see also the context section).\n\nFormat of the Page\n\nSusan: um......that's how our page will be set up? is that what you mean? or is that just a part of the page set up? cuz then...there's demographics you're missing....\n\nMiriam: here's a possible format: Pic A Few Sentences of Background info Info about the park-- from when it started being built until completion Info about how it effected the UES after it was built Interview and the pictures scattered throught with captions Flash movie of maps\n\ndid i miss anything?\n\nTrial Vid\n\ntrialvid_site\n\nSusan: o....ok, so it wasn't the Flash Crash after all.....haha\n\nHehe Miriam, it wasn't your fault... the site's not working...

Old Business 4. New Business\n\nSummary\n\nSusan: (05.02.08)\n\nJonathan, I agree with you. The Parks Committee Board Meeting was quite interesting, except things started to heat up a bit......but everything went well. Yea...he (Gary, i think his name was) did mention some Central Park history in his proposal. How the park's interior remained the original and was never changed, and how the curbs outside the park has been changed numerous times already.\n\nSince they were talking about how issues regarding pedestrians, bikers, and runners.....if they did find a way separate these three so that safety can be maintained....would this affect the Park? Like...would less and less people start going to the park due to so many rules and regulations?? just a thought.... and what's up with speed limits for bikers? haha\n\nHello everybody - I think it went very well... When I uploaded the audio, I found it was much better than first expected... I will upload the stuff ASAP... I think we have some clips that we can definitely use. He does go into certain central park history that could be useful... - Jonathan\n\nLaura Mayer and Margaret Price, Co-Chairs\n\nSusan [Demographics] 04.27.08\n\nCharissa: Susan, I think the decrease in population is also affected by the change of purpose of Central Park when it is no longer the place for plain relaxation, but many different activities and distractions.\n\nYears: 1850, 1870, 1900, 1920, 1950\n\nYear 1= 1850 Year 2= 1870 Year 3= 1900 Year 4= 1920 Year 5= 1950\n\nAs you can see from the graph, the population has changed signficantly over the years from 1850 to 1950. Central Park was first opened temporarily in 1857. Since then, the population has increased. There was a drastic increase in population from the year 1870 to 1900. That's probably the time when the Park became open and well known throughout the New York. However, there was a decrease in total population from the year 1920 to 1950. This was most likely due to the Great Depression which caused many people to move away from the New York County.\n\nThe early census (1850) used terms really different from the current census. In the 1850 census, they used the term \"colored\" to refer to people other than the White race. As time progresses, they gradually began to define everyone by race. For instance, Asian, Mexican, Hispanic, etc.\n\nOver the time from 1850 to 1950, the economy changed from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing economy. More people began to work in factories and earning a salary. Even children began working next to their parents in factories in order to help support the family.\n\nMore people became enrolled in the educational system. I find it interesting how in 1850, only about 1.3% of pupils manage to go to college after receiving a lower education. The majority of the students entered the work force at an early age and rejected the college education.\n\nIn 1950, there were a lot of job separations and different job employments (farmers, civilians, government workers, professionals, etc).\n\n1850 Historical Census Browser [1] New York County, New York\n\nTotal Population: 515, 547\n\nTotal Free Colored Population: 13,815\n\nTotal Free Colored Females: 7,717\n\nTotal Free Colored Males: 6,098\n\nTotal White Population: 501, 732\n\nTotal White Males: 248,008\n\nTotal White Females: 253, 724\n\nTotal Free Colored Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 1,667\n\nFree Colored Female Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 1,055\n\nFree Colored Male Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 612\n\nTotal White Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 17,140\n\nWhite Female Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 12,271\n\nWhite Male Adults Who Cannot Read and Write: 4,869\n\nAggr.

In 1811, whole Manhattan island was divided and sold in lots; only a few squares were left. As more people live in the city, they started to realize the need of something natural. Influenced by the Romantic Movement in Europe <def> a movement that saw in nature refuge from the Industrial Revolution</def>, people started to voice their opinion. In 1844, poet William Cullen Bryant demanded, \"Commerce is devouring inch by inch the coast of th island and if we would rescue any part of it for health and recreation it must be done now\". Writer Andrew Jackson Downing made a similar cry in his magazine, The Horticulturist, five years later. More and more people demanded for a park, as the New York Times article indicated (I put it on earlier in school and I cannot open it at home now, so I will cite and fill in info later). By 1850, creation of a public park in New York city became a political issue and Ambrose C. Kingsland was a supporter of the issue. That helped him to win the mayoral election in 1851 . Once Kingsland was in office, he asked the Common Council to take action. With the approval of the State Legislature, they bounded off 153 1/2 acres of land by Third Avenue and the East River from 66th street to 75th streets. In 1853, the State Legislature authorized the city to buy the site from 59th to 106th street between Fifth and Eighth Avenues, about 624 acres of land. The park faced oppositions from the businessmen, which can be eased by business opportunities. The Common Council voted to reduce the size of the park in 1855, but it was vetoed by Mayor Fernando Wood . In 1859, the city enlarged to park from 106th to 110th streets. The 843 acres park cost about five million dollars . In 1857, A Board of Commissioners of the Park was established and an Advisory Committee to help them. The head of the committee was Washington Irving. Other members included historians, writers, newspapermen, lawyers, etc. Egbert L. Viele was appointed Chief Engineer of the park. In August 1857, they started to clear the park. However, a panic striked the US in 1857. Central Park made driving fashionable, making the building on Broome and Mott streets the city's greatest carriage maker. I think the fashionable part contributed to the carriage houses we see close to the park - some of those wealthy, famous people park their carriages close to the park, not necessarily where they live, maybe sometimes they go ride in, near, or around the park for leisure. By 1873, some, earth, and topsoil amounting to 10,000,000 one-horse cartloads were moved out or into the park. This makes me wonder where did they put the things that are moved out of the park? The park was all man-made. By 1873, about four to five million trees, shrubs, and vines had been planted. The park was popular from the moment a portion of it was opened in the fall of 1858 and gradually increase its visitors as it gradually expand from 59th street north. By the 1860's, there were still many vacant lots south of 59th street, and the land adjacent to the park was almost completely unimproved. Olmsted and Vaux thought educational value of the park was important, thus they reserve space for museums in the Arsenal place and where the Museum of Natural History stands today. The land in which the Metropolitan Museum of Art is standing was already set aside for institutional use by the State Legislature in 1868. No wonder the Met. can carve partly inside the park. The same architects designed Prospect Park and Central Park. People were excited about the park and wanted to do many things in there. Since the park were to be used democratically, different people had different ideas of what to use the park for. The park menaced the 1881 world's fair, which led the State Legislature to prohibit future exhibitions of the kind. Some people want to sell off parts of the park to boost finance of NYC, but before the turn of the century, only two places were private, the Menagerie at the Arsenal and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They were both seen as invaders of the park. The invention of automobiles, in the city started from 1896, affected the park as people are granted permit to drive through the park. It created problems between cars and horse carriages and also the driveways in the park. By the 1920's the automobiles dominated the park . The National Recreation Association saw the park as a place for public recreation. Short after 1910, Central park had a permanent tennis court and baseball diamonds. It also had a Ball Ground dated earlier, which was turned into the Heckscher Playground with fences around it in 1925 as a donation of someone. From the 1900's on, the original park was changed greatly. Many parts were added like playgrounds, memorials, benches, and fences. It changed the original purpose of the park as a garden of trees, shrubs, and lawns to a more industrial, multi-functioned public space. At the same time, the natural lives of trees and birds were reducing due to neglect. We need to check the demographic, but this might be one of the reason for changing the demographics around the park. In the 1930's, a $1,000,000 system of sprinkler irrigation was placed below ground. It helped to bring more greenness back to the park. The Panic of 1929 stopped the growth of the park. It was not resumed until Mayor La Guardia came in office in 1934. The park's landscape was greatly altered by the addition of the Zoo, buildings, lost of the water bodies, the Wollman Skating Rink, new paths, lost of plants, removal of sheeps from the Sheep Meadow, etc. Central Park is declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965 by the Department of Interior. In 1936, the Park Department started to solve the problems of crime and vendalism in the park. It empowered employees to issue summoneses for violations of park regulations. The Police Athletic League was developed to educate people of the park's history and planning. It wanted people to understand that Central Park is the people's park and it's damage affect the people directly. It also developed trained police for Central Park, similar to guards or \"park maids.\" People felt safer to use the park with the police around. Crime rate in the park did not exceed the rate on the street, but it was more visible in the Park. Then, a speical full-time team of maintaining and organizing the park.

This has been expanded to the post World War II period, 1862-1956, accounting for buildings that are now at least 50 years of age and that represent a continuation of the historical and architectural development of the Upper East Side. The 92 non-contributing buildings in the original district have been reevaluated in light of new research into this later era of development. Forty-three of the 92 non-contributing buildings were determined to now be contributing. In addition, two properties, formerly considered to be contributing resources in the original district (5 and 9 East 64th Street), have been determined to be non-contributing as a result of recent changes and additions that have altered their integrity. Another property, 969 Madison Avenue, was under construction at the time of the original district nomination and it too is now considered non-contributing.\n\nAdditional distinct periods of significance â 1959, 1966, 1968 â have also been identified for three exceptionally significant buildings by prominent architects that independently meet the National Register criteria. These are the International Style Asia House at 112- 114 East 64th Street completed in 1959 by Philip Johnson, the Whitney Museum of American Art at 945 Madison Avenue completed in 1966 by Marcel Breuer, and the townhouse at 101 East 63rd Street completed in 1968 by Paul Rudolph. The buildings in the expansion area are of an urban character, scale, style, and materials similar to those in the original district. The expansion area consists primarily of residential buildings, with ground and second floor commercial uses on Lexington Avenue, that are oriented to the street within a rectangular street grid. Low, small-scale rowhouses line Lexington Avenue and the east-west cross streets. The expansion area also contains larger apartment buildings on Park and Lexington Avenues as well as East 72nd Street, a wide cross-street, that has historically allowed for development of bulkier buildings than permitted on the more narrow side streets. There are also a few buildings built as stables and also solely commercial, office, hotel, and religious uses.\n\nPhil 040408\n\nhttp://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE5DC1F39F93BA25752C1A962948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all\n\nIF YOU'RE THINKING OF LIVING IN THE UPPER EAST SIDE\n\nBy MICHAEL STERNE Published: November 18, 1984\n\nThe Upper East Side is New York City's prime residential neighborhood. No other section has its glitter and glamour, its cachet and chic. To be at home in this enclave of a hundred square blocks from 60th to 86th Streets, Fifth to Third Avenues, is to have at your door some of the best New York has to offer.\n\nThe primary advantage of the Upper East Side is superior housing. Along Park and Fifth Avenues and on the cross streets is clustered the city's largest stock of luxury-class prewar apartment houses. Prewar is the essential characteristic: almost nothing built since the 1930's affords the same amenities: large rooms, high ceilings, windowed kitchens and baths, redundant closets, working fireplaces.\n\nTwo great feats of 19th century engineering laid the basis for the development of the Upper East Side. One was the creation of Central Park, which drew fashionable New Yorkers up Fifth Avenue, first to baronial town houses and then to the grand apartment houses that replaced them. The park remains the pre-eminent amenity of the neighborhood - indeed, of the whole city - and East Siders are in the forefront of efforts to preserve it.\n\nThe other was the submerging of the New York Central's railroad tracks below Park Avenue - once called Fourth Avenue - which created a broad boulevard along which more apartment houses could be erected. Except for a scattering of institutions, hotels and town houses, the whole of both avenues from 60th Street northward is developed with high rise apartment buildings.\n\nPhil 040408\n\nhttp://www.uppereast.com/history.html\n\nUpper East Side History\n\nThe Upper East Side is a neighborhood of great diversity. In addition to being able to claim our country's most affluent zip code (10021), there are a wide range of people inhabiting the area bound from 59th to 96th Streets and Central Park to the East River.\n\nSignificant development of the Upper East Side began in the mid-19th century. Prior to this, very little construction occurred in this area since most people lived downtown and much of the land on the Upper East Side remained in the hands of the city government, or was divided into country estates. Beginning in the 1850s, wood frame houses began to spring up, but the area remained free of organized development of any kind.\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century, the increase in the population of New York City was the primary catalyst for transforming areas north of Manhattan's settled districts at that time. Vast numbers of foreign immigrants and other American migrants flooded the city. Still, the Upper East Side experienced only speculative development activity in areas along Fourth (renamed Park Avenue in 1888) and Fifth Avenues. Plans were existed to expand significantly, but these plans were shattered due to the Panis of 1873 when a severe economic depression lasting for about six years devastated the region sending Upper East Side land prices plummeting.\n\nThe Upper East Side regained its status as a prime location for speculative residential real estate investment in the 1880s as the New York area recovered financially and elevated railroads were built on Second and Third Avenues in 1880 and 1878 respectively. Most of the people who bought housing on the Upper East Side commuted to jobs located in downtown New York City. Almost the entire Upper East Side, with the exception of Fifth Avenue, was built up with residences by the early-1890s.\n\nThe western sections of the Upper East Side had new construction which took the form of Neo-Grec, Queen Anne or Romanesque REvival stone or brick and stone rowhouses built for sale to the middle-class. These rowhouses were often purchased by business and professional people many of whom were successful immigrants with German, German-Jewish or Irish heritage. Further east, the presence of the noisy and dirty elevated train lines (described above) contributed to decisions to contruct larger tenements more accustomed to housing large numbers of working people.\n\nFifth Avenue north of 59th Street was not considered to be a prestigious address prior to the 1890s. Up until this time, the wealthiest and most affluent people lived south of 59th street in mansions and rowhouses near Fifth Avenue. Fifth Avenue, along Central Park north of 59th street, was too expensive for many builders to touch however ... so these expensive plots remained vacant. The wealthy class began to dip its toe in the water of speculating in real estate along 5th avenue north of 59th street in the mid-1890s ... and by 1915 large palatial residences were erected on Fifth Avenue all the way up to 96th street!\n\nOnce the wealthier class expanded into areas north of 59th street, a substantial number of the rowhouses on neighboring streets were demolished and replaced by newer, more elegant residences. New York Central's Railroad tracks which ran along Park Avenue were electrified and covered early in the 20th century which eliminated many of nuisance conditions which suppressed land values to that point in time. At this time the wide Park Avenue boulevard was transformed into a prime location for new residences, which were constructed by both real estate developers and wealthy individuals looking to build homes on Park Avenue for their own personal use. Many of these new residents employed a significant number of servants of English, Swedish or Norwegian descent. All of the above new housing construction was accompanied by that of institutional buildings such as churches, synagogues, clubs, schools and museums which served the social and spiritual needs of new residents. At this time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art undertook a major expansion as the Upper East Side had become an elite residential neighborhood. All of the major mansion and townhouse construction came to an end in about 1915 as rapidly escalating land values, the introduction of the income tax in 1913 and the scarcity of available servants rendered this area too expensive for all but the country's wealthiest individuals.\n\nAt this time apartment houses began to be erected with all of the amenities expected in any high class single family home. Luxury apartment buildings appeared on the Upper East Side for the first time in the first decade of the 20th century, and rapidly expanded during the next two decades. Still, the idea of living in a single building with many other families had not caught on with everyone, and those affluent families with enough money pursued single-family construction of rowhouses and renovation of existing rowhouses further east on the Upper East Side.\n\nThe depression and World War II times saw very little development on the Upper East Side.\n\nPhil 040408\n\nhttp://www.livingcityarchive.org/htm/decades/1870.htm\n\n1870s\n\nTweed was responsible for numerous changes to the built environment, notably the development of the Upper East Side. He used his position in the Department of Public Works to orchestrate the building and coordination of miles of high quality sewer, water, and gas lines along with roads. Mid-decade, the Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide was exuberant: \"from One Hundred and Tenth street to Harlem river, from St. Nicholas avenue to the East river, the Boulevards and cross-streets are laid out and improved in the highest style of Tammany Art-opened, regulated, curbed, guttered and sewered, gas and water mains laid, with miles and miles of Telford-McAdam pavement, streets and avenues brilliantly lighted by fancy lamp-post\" resulting \"in one of the most desirable and picturesque localities for residence.\"\n\nPhil 040308\n\nI don't know if you guys are focusing on the UES or Central Park or both, but the Digital Collection of the NYPL has amazing images of the park such as the one below.

Could the number of doctor's offices have anything to do with the proximity of Lenox Hill Hospital on 77th between Park and Lex? Can you create a Google map of all those doctor's offices? How does this connect with your research interests in the neighborhood?\n\nMiriam: here's a map i found an google maps of the doctor's offices-- it's not letting me upload the actual image, but here's the link.\n\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&geocode=&q=category:+Physicians+%26+Surgeon+MD+%26+Do&near=Upper+East+Side,+New+York,+NY&ie=UTF8&cd=1&ei=N8LyR8SzNZrYigHWot0o&layer=c&ll=40.768582,-73.953695&spn=0.031007,0.080338&z=14&cbll=40.776372,-73.958161\n\nSusan: hmmm.....I thought there were more doctor's offices than that.....\n\nPhil: Look carefully at the map the link pulls up.

Concerning the history of Central Park, look at:\n\nhttp://www.centralparkhistory.com/\n\n3.

Liston CHAIR Maxine E.

Hey, we got to use our oral history skills one way or another...why not here? and also...does this mean we're going to forget about the MET idea and start attacking the building of the park?\n\n4. There is even a WIKI about the area! As John suggested on Monday, maybe y'all could post some of your findings to it?\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Community_Board_8\n\n5.

Almost every other building had a story attached to it. Also, it is a very beautiful area with wonderfully detailed architecture that is not as popular nowadays. The beauty of the buildings is enhanced by the presence of the park, which is kind of like their shared backyard.\n\nI also found the number of doctor's offices overwhelming. I wouldn't necessarily have thought of fifth avenue as a health care center, but there were a disproportionate amount of doctor's offices in the area. I feel like the upper east side is kind of like a fairy tale getaway land where people go to shop and enjoy the museums, and to have taxis summoned for them at the blinking of a red light. Overall, I think it's a fascinating area, and look forward to learning more about it.\n\nCharissa: Sorry for posting this so late. I just sat there reading about Greenwich Village and remember our own neighborhood. Like Bailey said, I also enjoyed the walking tour very much. But too bad we did not have time to eat lunch together. Since I knew nothing about the neighborhood, it helped me to get a sense of who lived there and what were the buildings used for. It also gave me a better sense of the neighborhood and the area, especially after reading the guide book. The history of the buildings are very interesting indeed. I did not know so many famous people lived there before. I was a great experience anyways. Now we can start asking useful questions.\n\nhere are some notes: Why are there so many doctor's offices? Why are there so many embassies. When did the rich moved in and when did they moved out? Why? - we can check the directory record. Did the shops come first or did the people come first. Why did the Met. carved in the park? Why is there an Asian Art Society in Upper East Side? the neighborhood is built from the park out. research period: 1860 to 1890. Started as family houses > moved to apartments > some bigger houses became Museums. In the late 90's, a woman and son moved in the neighborhood and murdered the owner of their brownstone and took it! scary...\n\nBooks we should read: People in the Park by Elizabeth Blackmar and Roy Rozenneig? and Manhattan moves Uptown\n\nBut I think maybe I did not observe carefully enough because I still have not much of an idea who is living in the neighborhood right now...maybe someone can tell me. Thanks. And also, who is doing the census research? We should do it as soon as we can. Thanks. See you in class.\n\nJonathan: I believe the walking tour was a great opportunity to get to know the area we wish to research. Unlike Bailey or Miriam, I never spent much time in the area. I had two questions that formed in my head that may be good research topics as I walked through the area: \"How the park influenced the development of the area?\" and \"Why are there so many embassies in the area?\" I wondered if the rich people would have move into the area if the park was never built? I think the questions we've been asking can be un-peeled layer by layer and that we'd find them more interrelated than not. My hypothesis is the rich people came to the neighborhood because of the relative remoteness (at the time) and because of the park that gave the place a sense of rural living yet living only minutes away from the hussle and bussle of the city. As the rich people settled there, I believe it only made sense to place the museums in the same area as the people who donated. I believe the doctors came in later just because of the status one could have in the area. I do not know how the embassies are related though.\n\nMiriam: I really enjoyed our walking tour. Almost every building there has a story behind it and it was really interesting hearing some of them. They busy atmosphere and the people running around is what the city is about, but Central Park cutting it off creates a calmer tone to all the running around. Because it's such a wealthy neighborhood, people put a lot of thought into the style of architecture of the buildings, which adds even more to the experience. It was a little disorienting coming back there after high school, seeing it from a tourist perspective as apposed to a residential. I never knew about the land-marking and the brown street signs, that was a new piece of information for me. The only problem I had with the upper east side was the fact that I walked down Madison for a good ten blocks and there was no Starbucks in sight.\n\nSusan: The walking tour was quite helpful to me because I never really go out to the world....I'm usually always stuck within my own circle which consists of a bit of Staten Island and a bit of Brooklyn. I found the architecture to be really interesting....the way some of the designs were. They looked a bit Roman and Greek styled. About what Jonathan said: I think people moved in because of the building of the park. Rich people usually move to the suburbs, away from the city....maybe the park gave them a suburban feeling....which attracted them to move in. The upper east side gradually builded stemming from the park. And....why are there no Starbucks in 10 blocks?? I thought Starbucks was a city thing.....there might be something about it..................rich people don't like Starbucks coffee??\n\nUpper East Side\n\nThis is where we got the idea to focus on the Museums from the [history link http://www.uppereast.com/history.html]\n\n\"All of the above new housing construction was accompanied by that of institutional buildings such as churches, synagogues, clubs, schools and museums which served the social and spiritual needs of new residents. At this time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art undertook a major expansion as the Upper East Side had become an elite residential neighborhood. All of the major mansion and townhouse construction came to an end in about 1915 as rapidly escalating land values, the introduction of the income tax in 1913 and the scarcity of available servants rendered this area too expensive for all but the country's wealthiest individuals.\"\n\nWe love the logo....centered too....\n\noOo...prettiful-ness...loving the blue sky!\n\nMap of Upper East Side\n\nyay!!!!! we have a map now!!! success! (group work!)\n\nHey guys, I found a website which might be a bit helpful....but there's no specific event explaining how the Upper East Side became a wealthy community....(Susan)\n\nPhil: Good find. But don't forget your citation. Where did this come from? (040108)\n\nThis is the income of that area from a 2000 census. The darkest area is 100,000 to 200,000.\n\nweb site\n\nUpper East Side History http://www.uppereast.com/history.html\n\nQuestions\n\nQuestion: When did the UES become identified as the \"place to be\" for Manhattan's wealthy?
