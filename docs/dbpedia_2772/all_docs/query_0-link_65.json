So today I thought I’d share a few of the prettiest streets on the Upper East Side. In general, I always love to walk in the upper 60s, the 70s, the 80s, and the low 90s between Lex and Park, Park and Madison, and Madison and Fifth. That’s a lot of ground to cover, so here are more specific streets where, in my opinion, you can see some of the prettiest houses on the Upper East Side!\n\n63rd between Madison and Fifth\n\n64th between Park and Madison\n\n67th between Madison and Fifth\n\n70th between Lex and Park\n\n73rd between Lex and Park\n\n74th between Park and Madison\n\n76th between Madison and Fifth\n\n78th between Second and Third\n\n78th between Park and Lex\n\n81st between Third and Lex\n\n81st between Park and Madison\n\n82nd between Third and Lex (amazing for Christmas and Halloween!)\n\n82nd between Madison and Fifth\n\n93rd and Madison\n\n94th between Madison and Fifth"
