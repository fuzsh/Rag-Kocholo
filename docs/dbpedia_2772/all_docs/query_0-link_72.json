        "text": "On a quiet Upper East Side block stands a lovely Gothic Revival church, its blond brick facade and copper steeples fitting in with beauty and symmetry amid its low-rise neighbors.\n\nFormer church, I should clarify. Though small crosses still grace the roof, the arched front entrance at 211 East 83rd Street between Second and Third Avenues is now boarded up; stained glass no longer fills the windows.\n\nA resident across the street told me the church bell was recently removed. Religious artifacts and liturgical items were apparently taken away at night earlier this summer, per the New York Post.\n\nThis historic sanctuary—sold to a developer in April for $11.8 million, per East Side Feed, and now under threat of demolition—deserves better.\n\nIts story begins in 1892, when the church was built for a German Lutheran congregation. A quarter of a century later, it became the home of the Church of St. Elizabeth of Hungary—just as many of New York’s Hungarian and Slovak immigrants were relocating from the Lower East Side and East Village to the less crowded tenements and storefronts of Yorkville.\n\nSt. Elizabeth’s Catholic church moved from Lower Manhattan to Yorkville (above, in 1940) with its congregants, leaving the original small church at 345 East Fourth Street for this four-story house of worship, which includes a rectory on the left.\n\nThe church was one of the foundations of the Hungarian community here. Since the early 20th century, thousands of Hungarian immigrants—who colonized “Little Hungary” around East 79th Street—shared Yorkville with Czech immigrants closer to East 72nd Street and German newcomers on and around East 86th Street.\n\nAs the number of church members began to dwindle toward the end of the 20th century, St. Elizabeth’s took on a new role. In 1980, it was designated by Cardinal Cooke as a congregation for deaf parishioners, with services conducted in sign language.\n\nSt. Elizabeth’s fortunes turned in 2014, when the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York announced it would close and merge with a neighboring parish, St. Monica’s on East 79th Street. (Another Hungarian congregation, St. Stephen’s on East 82nd Street, also merged with St. Monica’s.)\n\nWith the church sold and being emptied out, this pillar of a formerly vibrant immigrant community needs an angel. Neighborhood preservation group Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts is spearheading a campaign to have St. Elizabeth’s obtain landmark status, which could stop its destruction.\n\nClick on the campaign link above or email save.st.elizabeths.of.hungary@gmail.com to find out more about keeping this sanctuary of loveliness and peace in the cityscape.\n\n[Third image: NYC Department of Records & Information Services]\n\nIn 1901, a five-story, brick and limestone Beaux-Arts townhouse (below, far left) made its debut on Fifth Avenue between 79th and 80th Streets.\n\nDescribed by one newspaper as “one of the finest houses on Upper Fifth Avenue,” this stylish piece of real estate wasn’t the most ostentatious mansion in the neighborhood.\n\nBut with its bow front, numerous ornamental carvings, and iron balcony wrapping around the fifth floor, it had an excess of Gilded Age architectural bells and whistles compared to its more restrained and balanced neighbors.\n\nThe owner, William Bateman Leeds, was a tremendously wealthy businessman. Born in Indiana, Leeds didn’t come from money. But this enterprising former railroad engineer founded a company that produced tin. After monopolizing the tin industry and eventually selling his company to U.S. Steel, Leeds earned the nickname the “Tin Plate King.”\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the Tin Plate King reportedly paid his first wife a million dollars for a divorce. After his marriage was dissolved he wed his second wife, Nonnie May “Nancy” Stewart, in 1901.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue house, which he bought for $260,000 and paid another $70,000 to add a marble hall and staircase, was a gift for his beloved bride.\n\nThe couple’s incredible wealth made them regulars on the society pages of New York newspapers. But it was their baby son, William Bateman Leeds, Jr., who arguably became the mansion’s most famous resident.\n\nDubbed the “world’s richest boy,” young William Leeds was born on September 19, 1902. From his earliest years, he had everything a pampered Gilded Age child could want—lots of toys, play clothes, and an entire playroom in his Fifth Avenue mansion, as these photos show.\n\nBut hobby horses and toy trains only go so far. “William’s life, sadly, was not all presents and playing,” wrote Susannah Broyles in a 2014 blog post from the Museum of the City of New York, which has these photos of young William in its collection.\n\n“For some reason, his mother, Nancy, believed her son to be frailer than most and kept him secluded from the outside world for much of his childhood.”\n\nThings drastically changed for the boy in 1908, when his father died at the Hotel Ritz while vacationing in Paris. Though accounts of the amount of money he supposedly inherited varies, William “was now the the proud inheritor of a cool $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 (nearly a billion dollars in today’s money),” states Broyles.\n\nAfter selling the Fifth Avenue townhouse in 1911, William’s mother moved him to an estate in Montclair, New Jersey. While she relocated to London with the aim of remarrying into royalty, William was left behind “with a governess, housekeeper, and 15 servants to meet his slightest wish,” according to one 1912 newspaper article.\n\n“Mrs. Leeds keeps in touch with the lad almost daily through cable messages and is kept constantly posted as to his physical condition and progress in school,” the article continued.\n\nWilliam joined his mother in England a year later, and she enrolled him at Eton. Nancy, meanwhile, found a Greek prince to marry in 1920 and became known for the rest of her life as Princess Anastasia (above painting, 1922)\n\nBy now, William was a young man, and his whereabouts regularly made the gossip pages. While visiting his mother in Greece he fell in love with 17-year-old Princess Xenia, and the two married in 1921 (below).\n\nThey eventually divorced, and William tied the knot a second time with a former Atlantic City telephone operator. The two maintained an apartment at 30 Beekman Place and shared a love of travel and yachting.\n\nThe world’s richest boy, who spent the first years of his life swaddled in luxury in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, didn’t turn out to be a stereotypical caddish rich kid or win-at-all-costs titan of industry.\n\nAs an adult, William kept a low profile and pursued philanthropy, “sending a boatload of medical supplies to Pitcairn Island in the dark days before Pearl Harbor, supporting a leper colony in Tahiti, donating an entire ambulance corps to the British when they were fighting Germany virtually alone,” per his obituary, among other causes.\n\nAfter a cancer diagnosis, he died in 1972 at age 69 at his home in the Virgin Islands, an apparent suicide.\n\nAnd what was the fate of his Fifth Avenue childhood home? After changing hands for several decades and being carved up into apartments, the townhouse was sold to a developer in 1959. A decade later, a 25-story glass and brick apartment tower took its place (above photo, middle building) and still stands today.\n\n[Top photo: MCNY, 89.3.2.3; second photo: MCNY, 89.3.1.49; third photo: MCNY, 89.3.2.17; fourth image: MCNY, 89.3.1.41; fifth image: Wikipedia; sixth image: Wikipedia]\n\nIn the 1870s, East 63rd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues was taking shape as a residential block of brownstones designed for upper middle class families.\n\nThirty years later, the out-of-style brownstones were destined for the wrecking ball.\n\nThis quiet stretch of East 63rd Street was transitioning into a “stable row”—a side street in a posh neighborhood where the new wealthy mansion dwellers residing on Fifth and Madison Avenues would build private stables to house their horses and luxury carriages.\n\nC. Ledyard Blair, a young banker and lawyer whose vast fortune came in part from his railroad tycoon grandfather, decided to build a stable here too.\n\nAt the time, Blair, his wife Florence, and their four daughters lived at 15 East 60th Street. The Blairs were in the process of constructing a massive estate in Somerset County, New Jersey (dubbed “Blairsden”), where Ledyard and Florence—both accomplished equestrians who belonged to the city’s Coaching Club—could ride, entertain, and enjoy private family time.\n\nIn the next decade, the Blairs would relocate to a new mansion at Two East 70th Street. But for now, East 63rd Street was a close-to-home space for their horses and vehicles.\n\nIn 1899, Blair purchased two lots where a pair of brownstones once stood, per the Landmarks Preservation Commission. He then brought in the architectural firm Trowbridge and Livingston to come up with a new building that would be imaginative yet dignified.\n\nThe result is this four-story bit of enchantment at 123 East 63rd Street. Completed in 1900 (second photo), the stable looks like a Beaux-Arts dollhouse. The limestone and red brick facade is topped by a slate mansard roof with ocular windows; the third floor has a rounded arch over the center window, decorated with a delightful iron balcony.\n\nStables like this one often ended up as artist studios once the carriage era was over. But this stable was intended to be an artist studio from the beginning.\n\nBlair gave the upper floors to his friend, John White Alexander—a portrait artist and mural painter who was a contemporary of William Merritt Chase and John Singer Sargent, notes the Somerset Hills Historical Society.\n\nAlexander’s oil painting of Florence Blair, painted in 1901 (below), was most likely painted in the East 63rd Street stable-slash-studio, per the Society.\n\nIt’s not clear when Alexander and Blair left the stable. But by about 1920, this one and the many others across Manhattan had outlived their purposes.\n\nAutomobiles now ruled Manhattan’s roads, and parking a car required a lot less space (and fewer hired hands) than maintaining a carriage.\n\nHow this lovely relic managed to survive while neighboring stables met the wrecking ball isn’t clear. It may have to do with the stable’s transformation into a private club in 1953, per the LPC.\n\nToday, 123 East 63rd Street is owned by the Gurdjieff Foundation. Wedged between tall apartment buildings, the stable and artist studio is still enchanting and startlingly beautiful.\n\nConsider it a remnant of an Upper East Side when fanciful stable rows with whimsical design motifs interrupted unbroken lines of more restrained townhouses and mansions.\n\nEast 66th Street was another Stable Row, as was East 69th Street. This gingerbread house of a stable still exists on East 38th Street.\n\n[Second photo: Architectural Record, 1901; fifth photo: Wikipedia; sixth image: Find a Grave]\n\nWhat kind of block was East 63rd Street between Second and Third Avenues in the first half of the 20th century?\n\nLike so many other streets hemmed in by elevated trains and relatively close to the riverfront, it was a modest stretch of walk-up residences, stores, and stables—anchored on the Second Avenue end by the Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls, one of the city’s young women’s residences that offered room, board, and a sense of security for modest fees.\n\nBy the 1960s, however, this part of East 63rd Street had undergone a facelift.\n\nGone were most of the low-rise buildings, overtaken by a tide of almost identical tall postwar apartment houses. Their white glazed brick “was supposed to make them look like beacons of clean, shiny modernism in the midst of the dirty city,” wrote The New York Times in a 2011 article.\n\nNothing illustrates the changed face of the block like this lone holdout stable at 212 East 63rd Street, now hemmed in by white-brick giants.\n\nEven the sides of the stable, which juts out from its neighbors, is covered in white brick. It’s a strange attempt to obscure its old-school style and construction.\n\nHow this stable managed to evade demolition is a mystery. Built in 1899 and once home to horses and the grooms who tended to them, it has the architectural hallmarks of the late Gilded Age: rounded, Romanesque ground-floor windows and doorway, and the ornamental arrangement of the bricks above them.\n\nTidy and well maintained, the stable’s backstory is missing (as is its chimney, though maybe it’s just out of view). It has long since transitioned into a residence.\n\nThis holdout serves as a reminder of an East 63rd Street with rougher edges, and while other buildings fell, it continues to grace the contemporary cityscape with its modest beauty and 19th century vibes.\n\n[Third image: NYC Department of Records & Information Services]\n\nIn 1686, Philip Jacob Rhinelander, a German-born French Huguenot escaping religious persecution in Europe, immigrated to New York.\n\nA century later, his descendants comprised one of the richest families in Gotham. The Rhinelanders made their money as shipbuilders, sugar importers, and stewards of a vast real estate empire across Manhattan, states the Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts.\n\nThe Rhinelander Sugar House once on William Street, Rhinelander Row and Rhinelander Gardens in Greenwich Village, the Hardenburgh-Rhinelander Historic District on East 89th Street—all are named for 18th and 19th century family members from this old-money clan.\n\nBut there’s another landmark in Manhattan that still bears the Rhinelander name: the Rhinelander Industrial School at 350 East 88th Street.\n\nThese days, the school is a ghostly shell between First and Second Avenues, its stepped gables and terra cotta “R” on the front facade (below) behind construction scaffolding.\n\nBut within its brick walls (now sadly covered in stucco) holds the story of two Rhinelander family heiresses and the gift they gave to needy children in what was then a poor immigrant neighborhood.\n\nThe sisters, Julia and Serena Rhinelander (in the above illustration), were born into a wealthy household at 477 Broadway in 1824 and 1829. In 1840, their father, William C. Rhinelander, moved the family to two adjoining houses that formed one mansion at Fifth Avenue and Washington Square North—at the time a fashionable enclave for Manhattan’s most elite.\n\nIn time, Julia and Serena’s sister and brother left the family mansion; their parents passed on. But the sisters, who never married, continued to live in the house at 14 Washington Square.\n\nAs heirs to a reported $50 million fortune, they didn’t have to work. Instead, they traveled, they attended social events, and they devoted themselves to philanthropy.\n\nOne of the philanthropic measures they decided to take on was the funding of a school that would be owned and operated by the Children’s Aid Society. The Society, launched in 1853 by Reverend Charles Loring Brace, began opening schools across New York City in the 1880s and 1890s where poor children could take regular classes while also learning a trade.\n\nWealthy New Yorkers donated the funds to build these schools. Julia and Serena decided they would as well, and they also donated a plot of Rhinelander family land on East 88th Street where the school would be located.\n\nUnfortunately, Julia Rhinelander never lived to see the school completed; she died in 1890 while vacationing in France. Serena, now alone in the family mansion (below, the house on the corner), did see the Rhinelander Industrial School open in May 1891.\n\nDesigned by Calvert Vaux (the architect behind many of the Society’s schools and homes for kids), the facility was described as a “beautiful building” by the New York Times, who noted that it had space for about 300 children, including a “kindergarten, sewing, and cooking schools.”\n\nThe school thrived as Yorkville’s population boomed. “By 1902, the Rhinelander Industrial School was serving 477 children, only up through age 12 because ”the children go to work at the age of 13,” according to the annual report of that year,” wrote Christopher Gray in the New York Times in 1989.\n\n“Boys were taught manual trades and girls were taught cooking to provide household economy to those who needed it most,” added Gray.\n\nSerena Rhinelander died in 1914 in her mansion at 14 Washington Square, after a lifetime of donating liberally to churches and charities in her “quiet and unostentatious way” according to her obituary in the New-York Tribune.\n\nMeanwhile, the school changed with the times throughout the 20th century. The building was remodeled in the 1950s, noted Gray, gaining its stucco facade.\n\nIt’s unclear how long classes were held and what subjects were taught. Yorkville by the late 20th century was no longer an immigrant neighborhood, and industrial schools that taught sewing and cooking had outlived their usefulness.\n\nIn 1989, the school was renamed the Rhinelander Children’s Center. As of 2014, the Children’s Aid Society was trying to sell the building to raise money for a new facility in the Bronx. Considering that the former industrial school is behind scaffolding, it appears to have been sold.\n\nWhat does the next chapter hold for this relic of Gilded Age benevolence? Perhaps the school is undergoing redevelopment—or waiting for the wrecking ball.\n\n[Fourth image: NYC Department of Records & Information Services; fifth image: NYPL Digital Collections;\n\nNew York City has always had its share of recluses. Many remain anonymous after years of seclusion behind apartment walls, others become infamous later in life or after death.\n\nHuguette Clark (above photo) falls into the latter category. More than a decade ago, headlines appeared revealing that this forgotten heiress—born in 1906 to rakish copper magnate and Montana senator William A. Clark (below) and his much younger second wife—had been living out the past 20 years in a Manhattan hospital suite, tended to by private nurses.\n\nFollowing Huguette’s death at Beth Israel Medical Center in 2011, a few weeks shy of her 105th birthday (and with a $300 million fortune to be divvied up), more details of her unusual life came to light.\n\nAs a girl (above right), the “Baby Copper Queen” took the path of other rich Gilded Age daughters. She traveled abroad with her parents, studied the violin, graduated from Miss Spence’s School (now Spence), made her debut in society, and married a Princeton graduate described as a “promising young bond salesman” in 1927.\n\nAfter a divorce in 1930 (Huguette claimed abandonment, her former husband said the marriage had been unconsummated, according to her New York Times obituary), she returned to the palatial twelfth-floor apartment at 907 Fifth Avenue (below) where she had been living with her mother, Anna, since her father’s passing in 1925 at age 86.\n\nPreviously, the family resided in a 121-room mansion fronting Fifth Avenue at 77th Street dubbed “Clark’s Folly” because it was so insanely ornate.\n\nHer retreat over the next decades from society events and social outings went unnoticed by the press. Apparently she was content to lead a small life, collecting dolls, visiting the family’s Santa Barbara estate, and staying out of the public eye—a lifestyle her mother seemed to pursue.\n\n“Mrs. Clark did not care for social distinction, nor the obligations that would entail upon my public life,” William Clark once wrote of his wife, according to Bill Dedman’s 2010 NBC News article and photo gallery exploring the family backstory and re-introducing Huguette to contemporary viewers.\n\nWhen her mother passed away in 1963, Huguette isolated herself even more. It wasn’t until the early 1990s that a frail Huguette arrived at Doctors Hospital on the Upper East Side for treatment for skin cancer lesions that disfigured her face. Doctors removed them, but she opted to stay in the hospital.\n\nShe transferred to Beth Israel when it merged with Doctors Hospital…and never left.\n\nHuguette’s reasons for leading much of her life in seclusion from the outside world remain a mystery. She left no diary or trail of clues. Maybe she was simply an introvert, or very much her publicity-shy mother’s daughter. Perhaps her reclusiveness was driven by grief after losing her mother, her father, and in 1919, her sister Andree (second photo on the left), who died at age 16 of meningitis.\n\nWhat she did leave behind are her paintings. While her father was an avid art collector whose collection of 800 or so paintings, sculptures, and antiquities are now housed at the Corcoran Gallery, Huguette herself was an artist with a focus on portraits, landscapes, and still lifes.\n\nThe image above is a self-portrait of the heiress as a young woman. Holding her palette and standing before a canvas, she seems to see herself a serious artist. There’s a softness to her face and form that reveals a comfort in this space, most likely a studio in her Fifth Avenue apartment.\n\nThe second and third photos have self-evident titles. The first is “Scene From My Window, Night,” (above) which overlooks Fifth Avenue traffic, illumination from headlights and street lamps, and the modern skyscraper cityscape including the Empire State Building in the background.\n\n“Scene From My Window—After the Snowstorm” (below) is a similar nocturne featuring soft lights, a snowy Central Park, and prewar apartment buildings like her own in the distance.\n\nWhen she painted these and others isn’t known. Huguette did exhibit some of her work at the Corcoran Gallery in 1929, and I imagine these date to about that time. If she exhibited elsewhere, I couldn’t find any reference.\n\nThe last two paintings intrigue me. On one hand, they’re lovely landscapes showing what makes New York so enchanting: the lights, the snow, the skyline. They seem to have been painted by someone who took pleasure in this side of Manhattan and wanted to recreate it.\n\nOn the other hand, the window panes mimic jail bars. Was Huguette’s Fifth Avenue apartment a kind of prison for her? It’s impossible to know, but I prefer to think that this heiress, one of the last human links to the Gilded Age, put herself there by choice—and created a life behind these masonry and glass walls that gave her fulfillment.\n\n[Top image: NBC News; second image: Wikipedia; fourth image: Indianapolis Star; fourth, fifth, and sixth images: Artnet.com]\n\nRight now, if we could flip back the calendar to January in the Gilded Age, we would find ourselves in the middle of the exhilarating swirl of balls, parties, and charity events that made up elite society’s winter social season.\n\nIt was an annual ritual for decades. The season kicked off in November with the horse show and the opening of the Academy of Music’s opera series. (Though some of the select box seat holders tended to arrive late and leave early, more interested in gossip than opera.)\n\nDecember was reserved for the weekly Patriarchs Balls held at Delmonico’s. And in January, the most anticipated gathering of old-money New Yorkers would commence: Caroline Astor’s annual ball.\n\nCaroline Astor, of course, was Gilded Age Gotham’s society doyenne, a plump, plain-looking woman with a black pompadour (later a black wig) and a penchant for diamonds.\n\nWith her Knickerbocker heritage and 1853 marriage to John Jacob Astor’s grandson (who preferred sailing his yacht and carousing with other women over playing second fiddle at his wife’s social events), Mrs. Astor was able to propel herself into the role of society queen bee from the 1870s into the early 20th century.\n\nMrs. Astor reigned with help from her sidekick, Ward McAllister. The Southern-born McAllister was the inventor of the Patriarch Balls as well as the “Astor 400″—a list of the most socially prominent New Yorkers. At some point “the four hundred” were thought to be the number of people who could fit comfortably in the Astor ballroom, but the origin of this is in question.\n\nIn any event, Mrs. Astor’s mansion was certainly roomy enough to hold hundreds of people. But who would receive an invitation? According to Gilded Age socialite and memoirist Elizabeth Wharton Drexel, Mrs. Astor would carefully scan the Social Register, winnowing down potential invitees.\n\n“Failure to be invited signified that, whatever your pretensions, you were a goat and not a sheep,” wrote Lloyd Morris, author of 1951’s Incredible New York.\n\nOnce a guest list was finalized, each hand-written invitation would be sent out. This “coveted slip of cardboard,” as Drexel described it, began with “Mrs. Astor requests the pleasure….”\n\nWhat would these chosen guests—the “graded ranks of her hierarchy,” according to Morris—expect as they alighted from their carriages in front of Mrs. Astor’s rather staid mansion (second image) on Fifth Avenue and 34th Street?\n\nOn that night, “her mansion was ablaze with lights, and all its splendid rooms were banked with masses of flowers,” described Morris. “Through a wide hall, guests proceeded to the first of three connected drawing rooms, where their hostess received them, standing before the life-size portrait which she had recently commissioned from [portrait artist] Carolus-Duran.” (Top image, from 1890)\n\nAs she greeted her invitees, Mrs. Astor glittered in her Gilded Age finery, purchased during her annual trip to Paris.\n\n“A tall, commanding woman of formidable dignity, she was magnificently gowned by Worth,” continued Morris. “Precious antique lace draped her shoulders, edged her huge puffed sleeves. Her pointed bodice and long train were of rich dark velvet, her skirt was of satin, embroidered with pearls and silver and gold.” A diamond tiara rested on her pompadour.\n\nAfter greeting Mrs. Astor, guests made their way through the drawing rooms to the mansion’s art gallery (above photo), which functioned as a ballroom. While the orchestra played, a supper catered by prominent French chef J.A. Pinard was served in Mrs. Astor’s dining room where “the delicately embalmed bodies of terrapin and fowl reposed on ornate silver.”\n\nIn 1896, Mrs. Astor departed her Murray Hill mansion and moved into a sumptuous new palace on Fifth Avenue and 65th Street (below, in 1926). This French Renaissance double mansion was shared with her son John Jacob Astor IV and his young family.\n\nAfter the move uptown, Mrs. Astor resumed holding her January ball, receiving 600 guests. “It was the largest and most elaborate ball given this season,” the New York Times noted.\n\nThe atmosphere was more luxurious than ever. On January 8, 1901, The New York Times covered the festivities once again, noting that this year’s ball had a record attendance of “the most representative men and women in society.”\n\n“It was fully midnight before the last guest had arrived,” the Times wrote. “The entrance of the house was banked on either side by boxwood trees and masses of Southern smilax, in which were placed crimson poinsettias.”\n\n“Mrs. Astor received alone in the drawing room, which was decorated with mauve orchids in golden vases, to the left of the main hall,” continued the Times. “She wore a superb gown of black velvet pailletted in silver, and all her famous diamonds.” (Below, in black with her tiara)\n\nSupper was catered by Sherry, the restaurateur who operated his eponymous French eatery on Fifth Avenue and 44th Street frequented by old money and nouveau riche New Yorkers. The menu consisted of several dishes, including terrapin (clearly a Knickerbocker New York favorite), canard canvasback, foie gras, bonbons, and pommes surprises.\n\nAfter supper, the cotillion began. Ninety couples danced to a live band. After the dancing ended around 3:30 a.m., many stayed for a second supper, the Times reported, along with a list describing some of the gowns female guests wore.\n\nMrs. Astor died in 1908; when she held her final ball isn’t clear. According to her obituary, she had suffered a nervous breakdown in 1906, living mostly in seclusion until her passing from heart disease two years later at age 78.\n\nHer timing was impeccable. Lavish balls like hers were falling out of fashion, old money and new money had long intermingled, and society as she understood it was about to be lost to the ages.\n\n[Mrs. Astor portrait: Metmuseum.org; second image: MCNY X2010.11.4466; third image: Wikipedia; fourth image: Wikipedia; fifth image: MCNY X2010.11.4462; sixth image: NYPL; seventh image: Wikipedia; eighth image: Wikipedia]\n\nYou could say that sidewalk clocks (along with street lamps and fire call boxes) are the original New York City street furniture.\n\nThese elegant cast-iron timepieces began towering over Gotham’s sidewalks in the late 19th century in business districts thick with pedestrian traffic. (In one fanciful instance, the clock was embedded into the sidewalk itself on Broadway and Maiden Lane.)\n\nThey were designed for function—this is an era before wristwatches made their debut—as well as advertising. What better way to establish your business as solid and dependable then having its name emblazoned on a charming cast-iron clock?\n\nThat’s likely why, in 1898, Adolph Stern placed this black and gold sidewalk clock in front of his shop on Third Avenue near 85th Street. According to a New York Daily News article from 2001, Stern owned a jewelry store on this busy section of Yorkville under the elevated train.\n\nStern’s store was less a jewelry store and more of a pawn shop that sold jewelry. The Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) has it in their 1981 historic designation report that the clock stands in front of 1501 Third Avenue, which was “occupied by a pawn broker for many years.” The clock “was probably installed as an advertisement for that business,” per the LPC report.\n\nThe 17-foot tall double-faced clock standing outside Stern’s shop on 1501 Third Avenue (above and below in 1940, now Stern & Son) became a fixture on the streetscape. “With its paneled base, fluted column, and scroll top, this clock is almost identical to the Sherry Netherland clock,” states the LPC report, of the clock in front of the hotel at Fifth Avenue and 59th Street.\n\n“The dial, however, is crowned by a giant screw and watch fob ring, creating a delightful oversized pocket watch.” The Third Avenue clock had something even more unique above the fob ring: an ancient pawn shop symbol consisting of three gold balls supported by a three-pronged bar (see above and below photos).\n\nFor decades, this giant timepiece stood as a witness to a changing neighborhood and a changing world. Wristwatches became normalized; Yorkville began losing its German population, the elevated train came down, Stern’s shop gave way to a furniture store…and handsome examples of street furniture were often left to fall into disrepair.\n\nAs the 20th century went on (below in 1932, mostly hidden by the el train) and the old clock became marred by graffiti, it went missing.\n\n“Century-Old Clock Gone From the Sidewalk,” a newspaper headline read in August 1985, explaining that someone made off with the clock after $4,000 had been raised to refurbish it. A witness from a furniture store said they saw several men in a van take it away, claiming they had “police permission.”\n\nApparently it was just a mix-up: a Long Island man who collects clocks got the go-ahead from a city administrator to buy it and haul it away, according to a Newsday article a month later. The city got it back with the intent of doing repairs.\n\nRestoration came in the late 1990s, and the sidewalk clock was reinstalled in front of 1501 Third Avenue in 1999, according to a plaque on the base of “The Yorkville Clock,” as it’s now called.\n\nDelightful as the clock is (and a comfortable place to lean against, as the man in the photo at top demonstrates), something has been left off it: the three balls that comprises the ancient pawn shop symbol.\n\nToo bad—the symbol (or a reproduction of it) could have served as a wonderful reminder that a pawn shop had the idea to install the clock here more than a century ago.\n\nIf the clock looks familiar and you’re an old movie fan, you may have seen it in a scene in the 1945 drama The Lost Weekend, starring Ray Milland. The site nycinfilm.com has photos from the scene where the clock appears and info on how it was shot.\n\n[Third image: NYC Department of Records & Information Services; fourth image: NYC Department of Records & Information Services; fifth image: MCNY, 33.173.234]\n\n“You can get those fire engines on Schoenfeld’s on Lexington Avenue,” Macy’s confident department store Santa tells the irate mom played by Thelma Ritter in the 1947 holiday classic Miracle on 34th Street. “Only $8.50, a wonderful bargain.”\n\nYou know the plot: Macy’s hires a kind old fellow to be their store Santa Claus. But it turns out the chunky, bearded man is Santa Claus, aka Kris Kringle. And Kris doesn’t give a hoot about Macy’s desire to make tons of money selling toys during the Christmas season.\n\nSo if Macy’s doesn’t have the exact toy a child asks for, Kris tells the parents where they can find it. “I keep track of the toy market pretty closely, does that surprise you so?” Kris asks Ritter’s character, who is shocked that Macy’s Santa is sending customers to another retailer.\n\nIt’s a movie not only about the true spirit of Christmas but also the ruthless department store wars of the middle of 20th century Manhattan. The names of competing department stores referenced in the movie are all recognizable, even if the store itself no longer exists, like Gimbels and Wanamaker’s.\n\nBut Schoenfeld’s? This small toy store was definitely not a department store. It operated on the ground floor of a tenement building at 1254 Lexington Avenue between East 84th and East 85th Streets.\n\nThe German store name leads me to wonder if a local Yorkville family launched this business, but details are hard to come by. Schoenfeld’s was open as early as 1927, when this ad for a toy motorboat appeared in Scribner’s Magazine.\n\nWhen Schoenfeld’s folded is a mystery, though clearly it vanished after the movie hit theaters. At least one photo of this toy emporium exists—taken around 1940 and part of the Tax Photo Collection at the NYC Department of Records & Information Services.\n\nThe photo (top image) and the Scribner’s ad are all that remain of a piece of New York City retail history, immortalized in a short line in a Christmas classic movie."
