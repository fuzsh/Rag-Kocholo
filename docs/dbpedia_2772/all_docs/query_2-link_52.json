        "text": "5TH AVE-FULL FLOOR IN TOP LIMESTONE COOP\n\nA grand example of architectural elegance, this rare and stunning residence occupies the entire fifth floor of one of Manhattan’s most coveted Fifth Avenue limestone prewar cooperatives. The residence enjoys an expansive 56’ of frontage along Museum Mile, and a premier address on one of Fifth Avenue’s best blocks. Oversized windows and soaring ceilings amplify the natural light and voluminous rooms throughout the home.\n\nEnter via your own private elevator landing that opens into an impressive 24’8\" x 11’ gallery with hardwood floors and tasteful columns flanking wonderful open doorways. Proceed straight into the breathtaking 40′ × 19′4\" west-facing living room enriched by a wood-burning fireplace, intricately-detailed 20’ ceilings, and 3 dramatic 14’ windows overlooking the stunning facade of The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Graciously adjoining the living room through two doorways is the stately southwest corner library graced by built-in bookcases, a wood-burning fireplace, and magnificent views of the Central Park South skyline as well as the David Koch Plaza, with its beautiful fountains and landscaping. The spacious library can easily be converted to an additional bedroom if desired, due to its adjacent location to the gallery which has a coat closet and full bath. Also flowing off the living room is the east-facing dining room that can comfortably seat 18 guests, and accesses both the gallery and kitchen for effortless entertaining.\n\nThe windowed gourmet kitchen, conveniently entered from the gallery or through the butler’s pantry off the dining room, is well equipped with a center island and every amenity to indulge the selective chef, such as two four-burner gas ranges, two wall ovens, two Subzero refrigerators/freezers, two dishwashers, a double sink and a walk-in wine refrigerator. Completing this wing is a laundry area, a pantry that discretely holds the apartment’s central air conditioning equipment, and a double staff room with northeastern exposure and full en-suite bathroom.\n\nThe private bedroom wing off the gallery houses three south-facing bedrooms. The luxurious master suite offers a wood-burning fireplace and two full marble bathrooms, one of which has been connected with the adjacent bedroom to create a study and dressing room. The guest bedroom is equally large and has a huge closet as well as a windowed marble bathroom.\n\nBuilt in Fifth Avenue is among the most prestigious and sought-after white-glove doorman residences on Fifth Avenue. Designed by Warren & Wetmore of Grand Central Terminal fame, the handsome limestone building stands 14 stories between 83rd and 84th Streets, and is occupied by 14 lavish apartments. Central Park is at your doorstep and glamorous shops and fine dining on Madison Avenue are a block away. There is a 2% flip tax paid by the purchaser."
