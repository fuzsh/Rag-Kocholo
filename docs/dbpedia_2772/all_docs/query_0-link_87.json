        "text": "Home to some of the country’s wealthiest people, New York’s Upper East Side is best known for upscale real estate on Fifth, Madison, and Park Avenues. On the Upper East Side, you can find classic mansions that date back to the 19th century, Renaissance-style townhouses, luxury condos, and an array of apartments that meet every price point. In addition to the large affluent residential population, the Upper East Side is also home to some of the most famous museums in the world including the MET, Guggenheim, and more.\n\nThe Upper East Side (UES), is one of the most upscale areas in New York City and includes several smaller neighborhoods, including Lenox Hill, Carnegie Hill, and Yorkville. On the UES, you will feel a slower and more relaxed vibe compared to the bustling streets of midtown Manhattan. Even though you may feel farther away from the hub of the city, you can find everything you need including world class restaurants, playgrounds, community centers, libraries, and schools.\n\nAll Notable New Yorker photos courtesy of Wikipedia via Wikimedia Commons.
