        "text": "The Upper East Side apartment that journalist Barbara Walters called home for 30 years hit the market today for $19.75 million. The late broadcasting legend lived there until her death last December. Located in tony co-op building 944 Fifth Avenue, the residence sits on the eastern edge of Central Park. Designed by architect Nathan Korn, the Italian Renaissance palazzo-style building was constructed in 1925 and stands at 14 stories. Alexa Lambert at Compass has the listing.\n\nOccupying the building’s entire sixth floor, the 11-room abode remains mostly untouched since Walters’s passing. One can only imagine the trove of antiques, art, and memorabilia inside; according to a 1975 AD apartment tour, Walters was a known collector. Interior decorator Burt Wayne designed the space featured in AD’s tour, which was filled with a variety of Victoriana passed down from her mother. “He never makes me feel as if I have to throw anything away,” the award-winning journalist said of Wayne.\n\nRecent images reflect a perfectly-kept capsule of Walters’s penchant for classical decor, peppered with more modern pieces. Traditional drapes hang over the windows in a study-like room with an antique-looking desk nearby. A red-lacquered dressing room with a wide bookshelf contains a red-leathered Eames chair (perhaps the same chair mentioned by Wayne in the 1975 interview?) amongst other furniture, sitting on a black-and-white animal skin carpet.\n\nAnd just as in her 1975 apartment where “flowers climb across the walls, the cushions and a chaise,” so too do they occupy the Emmy-winner’s final living room and primary bedroom."
