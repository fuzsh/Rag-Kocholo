        "text": "Fifth Avenue Campus\n\nMarymount’s flagship campus at Fifth Avenue and 84th Street is home to students in Nursery - Class V. Composed of three adjoining landmark mansions, the Fifth Avenue campus offers a beautiful yet cozy home away from home for our younger students. This campus includes state-of-the-art makerspaces and science labs, art studio, a gymnasium, an auditorium, a courtyard play area, a chapel, and a library.\n\nView Virtual Tour\n\n97th Street Campus\n\nMarymount opened its permanent second home for Classes VI-XII in September 2023 on East 97th Street. Designed by visionary architects COOKFOX, this 155,000-square-foot building enhances and expands the academic, athletic, and artistic programming for our Upper Mid and Upper Schools. This brand-new campus features four science labs plus engineering & design studios, two art studios, music room & practice rooms, a chapel, regulation-size gym and wellness center, 300-seat proscenium theater, full-floor dining area, and multiple outdoor spaces.\n\nNYC: Our Extended Campus\n\nThe School’s unique relationship with The Metropolitan Museum of Art allows students to take studio art, humanities, and art history classes in two dedicated classrooms at the museum. From these museum galleries to the stage at Carnegie Hall to the fields of Central Park, New York City is our extended campus. Central Park is a natural science laboratory and also offers facilities for physical education classes, team sports, recess, and field days. Other city sites, such as the United Nations, the Tenement Museum, Ellis Island, the New York Zoological Society, Carnegie Hall, the American Museum of Natural History, the Rose Planetarium, MoMA, the Guggenheim, El Museo Del Barrio, and Broadway are also frequent extensions of the classroom for Marymount students."
