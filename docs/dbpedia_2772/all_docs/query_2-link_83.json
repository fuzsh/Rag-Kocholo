        "text": "Walking Tour of the Upper East Side\n\nhe Upper East Side is synonymous with old money; this is the land of bluebloods and blue-haired ladies. That generalization doesn't hold true throughout the neighborhood, of course-the farther east you go from Central Park, the more affordable and down-to-earth things become. But for our purposes, we'll stay close to the park and take a look at the lifestyles of the rich and famous, the mansions of titans such as Vanderbilt, Carnegie and Whitney. Many of their homes are now museums, schools, charitable organizations or embassies; others have been subdivided into some of the most expensive apartments in the world.\n\nStart by taking the 4, 5 or 6 train to 86th Street. Walk west along 86th Street till you reach Fifth Avenue. The giant brick-and-limestone mansion at the southeast corner was built in 1914, and was later purchased by Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1944. The founder of the Vanderbilt fortune, Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, was a notorious tightwad, but he left a bundle for generations of his descendants to build impressive homes.\n\nTurn left and head down Fifth Avenue, toward the apartment building at no. 1040 that was the home of Jackie Onassis. Jackie loved living in the city, since New Yorkers take pride in playing it cool around celebrities; by blending into the scenery, she achieved a small measure of privacy here. Jackie O. was often spotted jogging around the Central Park reservoir nearby.\n\nContinue strolling down Fifth, past the Metropolitan Museum of Art. At the southeast corner of 82nd Street stands the former mansion of Benjamin Duke. Born to a tobacco farming family in North Carolina, Duke and his younger brother, James, were founders of the American Tobacco Company and the principal benefactors of a little college that became Duke University. The Benjamin Dukes bought their place from a developer who built it on spec in 1901. They later sold it to his brother, James, who lived there until he built his own nearby. Members of the Duke family and their relatives, the Biddles, lived in the Benjamin Duke house until recently.\n\nThe French Gothic palace on the southeast corner of 79th Street, property of several millionaires at different times, belongs now to the Ukrainian Institute of America. The onetime home of financier Payne Whitney (given to him as a wedding present by a doting uncle) between 78th and 79th Streets now serves as the French Embassy's cultural offices.\n\nJames Duke's place, modeled on a chateau in Bordeaux, rose on the northeast corner of 78th Street in 1912. A leading critic calls it \"one of the most magnificent mansions in New York.\" Duke's widow and their daughter, Doris Duke, lived there until the late 1950's when they gave it to New York University. It is now NYU's Graduate School of Art History.\n\nAt 75th Street on the northeast corner, the Commonwealth Fund occupies the home of Edward Harkness, son of one of John D. Rockefeller's original partners in the Standard Oil Company. Edward Harkness built most of the undergraduate dorms at Harvard and Yale. The Commonwealth Fund, founded by his mother, devotes Harkness millions to health and medical research.\n\nAt 75th Street, you might take a detour east to Madison Avenue and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Even if you don't have the time for a full-fledged museum visit, this is a great place to rest and refuel; Sarabeth's at the Whitney stands head and shoulders above your average museum cafeteria. This stretch of Madison Avenue is also prime gallery-hopping territory.\n\nOn East 73rd Street between Fifth and Madison stands the house Joseph Pulitzer built - no. 11, the one with lots of columns-now subdivided by 13 less affluent tenants. Despite the luxury of this home, Pulitzer, German-born publisher of the New York World and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, barely lived here, due to his extreme sensitivity to sound (a special soundproof room constructed here apparently didn't satisfy him).\n\nContinuing down Fifth Avenue, you'll reach the mansion of coke and steel tycoon Henry Clay Frick, which stretches from 70th Street to 71st Street and encompasses a lovely courtyard and pool. Frick, once chairman of Carnegie Steel, was an avid collector of art, especially of the Italian Renaissance. The mansion was designed by the same architects who designed the New York Public Library, and planned from the start as both home and gallery. Frick left the house and the art to the city, and the Frick Collection is one of the real jewels of New York City's art scene.\n\nTurn onto East 70th Street and stroll away from the park for a few blocks, continuing all the way to Lexington Avenue. This is one of the most elegant streets in Manhattan, lined with a row of stunningly beautiful town houses.\n\nAt the northeast corner of Park Avenue and 70th Street is the Asia Society, founded by John D. Rockefeller in 1956 to foster better relations between America and Asia through culture and the arts. Its galleries are worth a look.\n\nWalk south and look for 680 Park Ave., at the north corner of 68th Street. Designed by McKim, Mead & White, this neo-Federal town house was built for banker Percy Rivington Payne. It later became the Soviet Mission to the United Nations; Nikita Khrushchev stayed here while visiting the U.N.\n\nContinue down to 66th Street, and turn right, heading back toward Central Park. At 3 East 66th St. was the home of Ulysses S. Grant from 1881 to 1885. Forced into bankruptcy after a scandal-ridden presidency and ravaged by cancer, Grant retired here to concentrate on penning his memoirs. After his death, his autobiography met with great critical acclaim and earned a tidy sum for his family.\n\nThe Roosevelts' twin town house is worth a final two-block walk from Fifth Avenue to no. 47-49 East 65th Street. It has just one front door. Inside the vestibule were separate entrances to FDR's domineering mother's quarters on the left, and her son's on the right. (Small wonder that Eleanor didn't like it.) The Roosevelts lived there in 1920-21 when FDR was convalescing from polio and stayed there whenever they were in the city. The house is now a student center for Hunter College, which is nearby on Park Avenue.\n\nAt Fifth Avenue and 61st Street stands the Pierre, one of Manhattan's poshest hotels and a member of the Four Seasons chain. Amid lavish trompe l'oeil murals, you can indulge in the pricey pleasure of afternoon tea in the Rotunda Lounge. The Café Pierre bar is an elegant spot for a cocktail."
