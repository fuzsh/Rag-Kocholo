        "text": "<p>NYU is in Greenwich Village= Very trendy, young, hip. When you say 5th ave like that I think you mean in the Central Park range (59th street up till about 96th). That’s where Madonna and the like reside. NYU is about 3 miles from there. (60+ blocks). NYU is closer to things like China Town, Little Italy, etc. Need not worry about running into too much “old money” around NYU–it’s a pretty youthful area.</p>\n\n<p>Fifth Avenue runs up and down New York… (hint for future new yorkers: #'d avenues run north-south, streets east-west)</p>\n\n<p>and it meets right up to washington square park. but it’s not the 5th avenue most people think about.</p>\n\n<p>Is NYU near 5th Ave?.. Yes, it is. Wash Sq Park is where 5th Ave Starts downtown.</p>\n\n<p>Rich Neighborhood?.. Well… Yes and No. It is not rich like Upper East Side trust fund rich (It isn’t like Gossip Girl). But there is some new money there. Like hipster money.</p>\n\n<p>Well… The north side of Wash Sq Park is Waverly, but for all ease of explanation, lets just assume that NYU is located at 8th St. and 5th Ave. It is about 40 blocks uptown to get to the shopping you like. The really good shopping starts at 5th and 59th (Central Park South) and goes until about 5th and 40th. It is pretty easy to get there on the Subway. (Either the V-train or the 4/5/6, depending on where you are living next year). </p>\n\n<p>But don’t discount the SoHo shopping… it is awesome! There is even a bloomies downtown. And, Century 21 too! (The most awesome discount clothing store EVER!)</p>\n\n<p>Yes, NYU is located near 5th Ave. Look at this map, it shows how 5th Ave. ends right before Washington Sq. Park. <a href=“Undergraduate Admissions”>Undergraduate Admissions, as well as most NYU buildings, including Silver/Waverly/Library/Student Center/Bookstore/Computer Store/Campus Eatery are all located near Washington Sq park.\n\nHowever, downtown 5th avenue is not the upscale place you are imagining, which is in Midtown. But most students don’t exactly shop at Saks 5th Ave between classes…\n\nNYU is also located right near Broadway, which runs down Manhattan, there are a lot of great shopping places there, including the typical places you will see in the mall, as well as a couple of upscale places, boutiques, and some specialty stores. Overall, NYU is in a nice area - you definitely don’t have to worry about crime. I suggest you visit the school before deciding to attend.</p>\n\n<p>Where to all of the rich people live…</p>\n\n<p>Old Money- Upper east side and Central Park West, Some in Midtown</p>\n\n<p>New Money- SoHo, Lower East Side, Willamsburg (brooklyn) and Brooklyn Heights</p>\n\n<p>But, basically anyone who lives south of 125th street has to be atleast Upper Middle class, because it is ****ing expensive to live in NY.</p>"
