        "text": "5th Avenue / Madison Avenue Office Space for Rent Guide\n\nEssentially the highest-priced office submarket in Midtown Manhattan, Madison/Fifth commands respect through its sheer name. The area features some of the most iconic addresses in the borough, proving popular with well-capitalized companies looking for exposure and vanity addresses. With an inventory that consists of 24 million square feet of office space, the submarket is one of the largest in Midtown.\n\nWho is renting office space on 5th Avenue / Madison Avenue?\n\nThe submarket is globally recognized as being the global hotspot for advertising. The area is home to the most high-profile branding and advertising agencies, harking back to the 50s when the industry caught on new highs and established Madison Avenue as its habitat.\n\nConcerns from Colgate-Palmolive to Citigroup to Major League Baseball have their headquarters here, as do many of the largest and most prestigious law firms. The Seagram Building, between 52nd and 53rd streets, was designed by the legendary Mies van der Rohe and built-in 1958. Though at 800,000 square feet, it is not nearly as large as some of the other office buildings in this area of Midtown, it has an unmatched prestige, being one of the most elegant skyscrapers in the city.\n\nHow much does it cost to lease an office on 5th Avenue / Madison Avenue?\n\nDue to asking prices that run around the $90 per square foot mark and average Class A prices closer to $97, space here comes at a real premium. As a result, vacancy is the highest in Midtown, at roughly 17 percent.\n\nTransportation and commuting"
