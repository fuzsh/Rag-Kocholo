        "text": "From 57th Street to 110th Street, from the East River to Fifth Avenue, with Sutton Place and Carnegie Hill as separate venues\n\nThe Upper East Side has its own cachet, being home to many of the wealthiest New Yorkers. The mile-long \"Gold Coast\" between East 60th and East 80th from Fifth to Park avenues showcases the park-side mansions built by barons of the gilded age. Throughout the area, a mix of classic brownstones and luxury high-rises cater to a variety of residents, from singles to families. Museum Mile, running along Central Park, offers an unparalleled cultural bounty with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Jewish Museum, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Guggenheim Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Frick Collection. Madison Avenue is a shopper's Mecca, with upscale designer shops and retailers including Hermes, Jimmy Choo, Barneys New York, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Furla, Pratesi. Frette and Ann Taylor, along with rare book and manuscript shops, galleries and jewelers. The lush oasis of Central Park offers an array of activities, with The Lake, Loeb Boathouse, Wollman Rink, and the Central Park Zoo. Also in the park is the legendary Tavern on the Green."
