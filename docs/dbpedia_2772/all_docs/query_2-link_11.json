        "text": "I’ve only read the first three paragraphs and I’m immediately frustrated with the anti-pedestrian tone this article takes. I love America but can we PLEASE stop worshipping cars over people!\n\nLet’s put aside the health, cultural and sustainability benefits for a second and say, “This will INCREASE business for everyone on 5th ave.” Meanwhile the business owners are bellyaching that it’s bad for their bottom lines. This isn’t some revolutionary concept that hasn’t been tried before. Countless cities around the world have done this to immeasurable success.\n\nMark my words, this will succeed and then business owners who aren’t on 5th ave will complain that it worked TOO well and now it’s syphoning business away from them.\n\nAlso, shame on the author of this article for perpetuating the typical North American, anti-pedestrian rhetoric. It’s easy to see how people who are less informed about good city planning could read this article and think the reduction in car traffic is actually a BAD thing."
