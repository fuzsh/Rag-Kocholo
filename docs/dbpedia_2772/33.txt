Upper East Side Shopping in New York is perhaps a little less obvious than shopping on Fifth Avenue. However, you should certainly check out this neighbourhood! The Upper East Side is the part of Manhattan between 59th and 96th Street, on the east side of Central Park covering around 5 kilometres. The area is known for being very chic; right across from Central Park, on Fifth Avenue, you can marvel at the brownstone houses and luxury shopping brands.

Shops and museums

The part of Fifth Avenue that’s next to Central Park is also called the ‘Museum Mile’ because of the many museums located here such as the Guggenheim Museum and the Metropolitan Museum. You can very easily combine a visit to the museum with shopping in the Upper East Side. Even a peaceful morning in Central Park could be complemented with an afternoon of shopping as there is something for everyone.

Same brands, fewer crowds

Unlike the famous Fifth Avenue shopping area (the part just below the Upper East Side), this is a quiet neighbourhood, visited less by tourists, even though it has the same shops. Here too you’ll find brands such as Zara and Sephora. These are mostly located on Lexington Avenue, around 62nd Street and below. You can find the well-known department store Bloomingdale’s on 59th Street between 3rd and Lexington.

Luxury Shopping

Those with a little more to spend or those who just want to enjoy the luxurious feeling of the neighbourhood should head to Madison Avenue. Here you’ll find the most expensive designers in beautiful buildings and with breathtaking store windows. Lanvin, Oscar de la Renta, Christian Louboutin, Dolce & Gabbana… Each and everyone is a feast for the eyes.
