Joachim Murat was a French military commander and statesman and brother-in-law of Napoleon Bonaparte. During the Napoleonic Wars, he was crowned King of Naples as Joachim-Napoleon.

During the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, Murat became very close to Napoleon, accompanying him on many military campaigns. In 1800, Murat married Napoleon's sister, Caroline Bonaparte.

In 1806, Napoleon granted Murat the Grand Duchy of Berg, and in 1808 he was granted the Kingdom of Naples, succeeding Joseph Bonaparte who was crowned King of Spain.

After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Murat fled into exile before being arrested by Ferdinand IV of Naples. He was sentenced to death by firing squad and was killed on 13 October 1815.
