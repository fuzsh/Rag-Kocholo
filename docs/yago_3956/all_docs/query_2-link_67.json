        "text": "Tag: Joachim Murat\n\n“The Emperor is excessively occupied with his future”\n\nI've posted quite a few letters from Murat to his daughter Letitia here (see the letters list at the bottom of the Archive page); however, very letters still exist from Caroline Murat to any of her children (or at least, very few of them have been published anywhere). Below is one of Caroline's letters to …\n\nContinue reading “The Emperor is excessively occupied with his future”\n\n“You must truly have lost your mind”\n\nThis second installment of Napoleon's letters (via the Fondation Napoléon) to Murat spans from 3 November - 15 December 1808. There is a noticeable change in tone in these letters from those of the first few months of Murat's reign, with the Emperor beginning to unleash a torrent of criticisms against Murat about matters great …\n\nContinue reading “You must truly have lost your mind”\n\n“Distinguish yourself and make yourself loved”\n\nAs many Napoleonic history buffs are already aware, the Fondation Napoléon has recently published the the entirety of Napoleon's correspondence online (here). This will be the first part of a series of translations of the Emperor's letters to Murat. Rather than going from earliest to latest, I'm starting with the letters from the beginning of …\n\nContinue reading “Distinguish yourself and make yourself loved”\n\n“Deep down, the emperor did not like Prince Murat…”\n\nMademoiselle Avrillion, who served as a lady-in-waiting to the Empress Josephine, published her memoirs with the intention of “recounting with simplicity and in good faith what I have seen and heard during the more than twelve years I spent in the service of an excellent woman, who, in fatal circumstances, also had her own kind …\n\nContinue reading “Deep down, the emperor did not like Prince Murat…”\n\n“His courage… always grew with his position”\n\nGeneral Auguste-François-Marie Colbert de Chabanais met Murat in 1797, and served as his aide-de-camp in Italy and Egypt, where he was badly wounded; he returned to serve under Murat once more just before the battle of Marengo. In 1803, Murat attended his wedding. Colbert was a promising young officer rising quickly through the ranks; like …\n\nContinue reading “His courage… always grew with his position”\n\n“I have not been deceived by anyone”\n\nReturning to the memoirs of General Belliard, Murat's close friend and chief of staff, we have a letter from Caroline Murat to Belliard, written on 20 October 1812, two days after her husband's defeat at the Battle of Tarutino. Caroline expresses her hope that the army will arrive in Moscow soon; Napoleon had just begun …\n\nContinue reading “I have not been deceived by anyone”\n\n“A king… appearing as a friend caring for another friend”\n\nReturning to the memoirs of General Griois with a scene from the Russian retreat. Arriving back at the ruined city of Smolensk on 13 November, Griois, after procuring some shelter and food, seeks out Murat to report on the loss of his artillery. He finds him with his wounded chief of staff, Belliard, and is …\n\nContinue reading “A king… appearing as a friend caring for another friend”\n\n“It would be the height of madness”\n\nAnother excerpt from Dedem de Gelder, backtracking to the 1812 campaign. After Napoleon's abandonment of the Grande Armée (the command of which he had left to Murat), the political ramifications of the disastrous campaign are already being felt; the Prince of Schwarzenberg confirms to Dedem that Austria, Napoleon's reluctant ally since his marriage to Marie-Louise, …\n\nContinue reading “It would be the height of madness”\n\n“The allies… paid him the blackest ingratitude”\n\nGoing back to the memoirs of General Dedem de Gelder this week. In this excerpt, Dedem discusses Murat's defection from Napoleon in 1814. It is a surprisingly sympathetic take from a man who is far from being an admirer of Murat, and who is deeply critical of his conduct at other points in his memoirs. …\n\nContinue reading “The allies… paid him the blackest ingratitude”"
