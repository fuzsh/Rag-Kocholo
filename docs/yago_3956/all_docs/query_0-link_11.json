His ability initially as a simple cavalryman and later as a cavalry commander was prodigious. It was his provision of 40 cannons to fight the Royalist uprising of 13 Vendémiaire which first brought him into contact with Bonaparte, and he after distinguished himself not only in the First Italian Campaign at Dego and Mondovi but also in the Second, notably at Marengo, becoming one of Napoleon’s closest associates, fighting with the cavalry throughout the whole of the Consulate and the Empire. His most glorious action was probably at Iena where he completely destroyed the Prussian army and caused Blücher to capitulate. As Murat remarked ironically in a letter to Napoleon, ‘Sire, the battle is over because there is no one left to fight’. The only major battle he missed (perhaps significantly, along with Berthier) was Waterloo. Although Governor of Paris, he nevertheless took a back seat in the Duc d’Enghien affair and did not stand in Napoleon’s way. He was in the end rewarded with the kingdom he so much sought after, namely that of the Two Sicilies, but not without strings attached. The title King Joachim-Napoleon was imposed, as was the clause that on his death Caroline his wife would become sole ruler. Berthier reminded Murat that ‘for your subjects you must be the king: but for the Emperor you must be viceroy’. Nevertheless, Murat threw himself heartily into the job of ruling Naples, modernising his kingdom with the bringing of the Code civil, the breaking up of the vast landed estates, with his foundation of a university and a naval academy, his encouragement of the cotton industry, and his effective solution to the problem of Brigands. Disagreements with Napoleon and Caroline his wife however led to tension in the kingdom, and he abandoned command of the shattered Grande Armée on the retreat from Russia in 1812 (handing it to Eugène de Beauharnais) to return to stabilise his kingdom in Italy. An unsuccessful treaty with Austria and the fact that he was not recognised as lawful ruler by the allies during the First Restoration led to his (in the end fruitless) attempts to rejoin Napoleon for the Hundred Days. He tried to play the card of Italian unification in order to provide himself with a role and defence from Austria, but the defeat at Tolentino put an end to his hopes. Given the context, his landing at Pizzo almost seems like an attempt at suicide.\n\nFurther reading"
