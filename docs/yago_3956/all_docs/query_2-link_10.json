        "text": "After first tying the knot in 2021, HRH Prince Joachim Charles Napoleon Murat, Prince of Ponte Corvo, and Miss Yasmine Lorraine Briki said ‘I do’ for the second time on October 22, officially making the bride, once again, HRH Princess Yasmine Murat.\n\nHeld at the Cathedral Saint Louis des Invalides in Paris, the wedding was a regal affair, and was attended by a sparkling guest list full of royals, including the couple’s newest addition to the family, their little son Prince Joachim. Here’s everything you need to know about the religious ceremony.\n\nPrincess Yasmine’s ethereal wedding day ensemble\n\nA descendent of the Al-Breiiki Princely family, Princess Yasmine walked into the wedding venue dressed in a beautiful ivory bridal gown which featured elegant dropped shoulders, a sweetheart neckline, and a detachable train that featured intricate gold embroidery, with the alphabet ‘Y’ sewn in at its end, along with a golden crown to signify her new title. Among the most spellbinding details of the bride’s look, however, was her lovingly crafted tiara, a diamond, pearl and emerald piece that was designed by Princess Yasmine herself.\n\nA passionate illustrator, Princess Yasmine sketched out her dream tiara, which would then be brought to life by jewelry designer Julian Pelliccia for her religious wedding ceremony, keeping her own love story in mind. While the front of the headpiece includes a sculpted ‘M’ to signify the family name of her husband, the emerald that sits just below it is actually a gift Prince Joachim gave her on the birth of their son.\n\nAll the guests at Prince Joachim and Princess Yasmine’s wedding\n\nThe couple made their vows to each other at the Cathedral Saint Louis des Invalides surrounded by loved ones, civil and military authorities, and guests from around the globe. Among the many there to witness their union were HRH Prince Napoleon and HRH Crown Prince of Albania (who participated in the wedding as best men), HRH Crown Prince of Egypt, HRH Prince Charles-Emmanuel of Bourbon-Parme, HRH Prince Amaury of Bourbon Parma, HRH Princess Annunziata of Bourbon Sicily, HRH Princess Chantal of France, HRH Prince Charles-Philippe d’Orléans, HRH Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, HRH Princess Hélène of Yugoslavia, H.S.H. Prince Belozinsky, the Duke of Montebello, the Duke of Dalmatia, H.S.H. Prince Constantin Mourousy, HE Ambassador of Egypt in France Mr Alla Youssef, and Viscount Atushi Hannagata, member of the Imperial Court of Japan.\n\nThe complete wedding program\n\nAlong with the official cathedral wedding, Prince Joachim and Princess Yasmine’s celerations also included a pre-wedding reception on October 21, where guests attended in their finest black tie looks, and a post-wedding gala dinner. Come October 23, guests bid the couple and their son farewell after enjoying a casual brunch.\n\nBelow, take a closer look at the royal wedding."
