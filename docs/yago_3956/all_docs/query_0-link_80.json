        "text": "Joachim Murat 1767-1815\n\nJoachim was married to Caroline Bonaparte, which made him Napoleon's brother-in-law.\n\nJoachim Murat's Family\n\nJoachim had two sons, Napoléon-Achille and Napoléon-Lucien-Charles, as well as two daughters.\n\nJoachim Murat's Life\n\nJoachim signed on with the army in 1787. He was smart and courageous. He came to Napoleon's attention in 1795 when they put down a rebellion of anti-royalists in Paris.\n\nHe later fought with Napoleon in Italy and Egypt. Joachim was also actively involved in the coup d'etat that put Napoleon into power. Napoleon thought he'd better keep the loyal ones close, and so he married Joachim to his sister Caroline. That was in the year 1800.\n\nJoachim went on fighting in important battles, such as the Battle of Marengo. Napoleon was very pleased with the boy and made him grand duke of Berg and Cleves and also sent him to Spain as lieutenant.\n\nHaving arrived in Spain, ambitious Joachim thought it was a pity that the Spanish throne was vacant and tried to sit on it. But the Spaniards were very much against that idea and Joachim had to find something else he could dream about.\n\nLater Napoleon put his brother Joseph, who was previously king of Naples, on the Spanish throne. Knowing about Joachim's fondness of sitting on thrones, Napoleon made Joachim king of Naples. That was in the year 1808 and Joachim loved it. Napoleon called him Joachim-Napoléon, which would be Gioacchino-Napoleone in Italian, but the Italians kept calling him Gioacchino Murat.\n\nAs king of Naples Joachim did a decent job. Among other things, he set up the Napoleonic Code and strengthened the economy.\n\nJOACHIM NAPOLEON, KING OF NAPLES\n\nClick image to enlarge\n\nHe continued his life as a solider but that worked only for a time. On the retreat from Moscow he simply abandoned his troops and hastened home because he felt his kingdom of Naples was in danger.\n\nJoachim then got caught up in the middle of European politics. Napoleon's enemies courted Joachim Murat as a potential ally. In effect, Joachim didn't know whose side he should be on. And that got him killed.\n\nThe Austrians sacked Naples and Joachim fled to Corsica. He tried to come back to Naples but got arrested and shot.\n\nJoachim Murat's Short Biography\n\n1767 Birth in La Bastide-Fortunière, France\n\n1787 Joins cavalry\n\n1795 Fights in Paris, meets Napoleon I\n\n1796 - 1797 Fights in Italy\n\n1798 - 1799 Fights in Egypt\n\n1800 Fights in Italy for Napoleon\n\n1803 Becomes Napoleon's lieutenant and travels to Spain\n\n1804 Becomes governor of Paris and marshal of the Empire\n\n1805 Fights in the Battle of Austerlitz\n\n1806 Becomes grand duke of Berg and Clèves\n\n1808 Becomes king of Naples\n\n1815 Death by execution in Pizzo, Calabria\n\nMore History"
