        "text": "Preface\n\nNapoleon famously declared that history is a set of lies that have been agreed upon. He was right in that history often resembles a museum of untruths. But he was also wrong, for there is very little agreement when it comes to many of them. The history of Napoleon and his age bears this out. Even today, the merits and achievements of the central figures of the Napoleonic era are subject to ongoing wars in scholarship in which heroes are constantly being made and unmade, and in which narratives are carefully constructed in one quarter while being hastily pulled down in another.\n\nAll the participants who approached greatness, or sought to, in that great age have unavoidably been fed into this seemingly endless battle between fabricating stories and telling the truth. After all, impartial biographies have always been collateral damage whenever writing is carried out to persuade. Napoleon himself has seen his legacy exulted or trashed in equal measure, and lesser personalities such as Metternich, Wellington, Czar Alexander, Josephine or a thousand others have not been spared either, finding themselves appointed to roles in a confected drama and assigned qualities they never had – or never pretended to have – all to win a point, prove a moral or sell a book.\n\nThis constant refashioning of reputations, however monumental they might appear, means that they are never really set in stone. They are too subject to the dictates of caprice, prejudice and moralizing to be fixed and constant. Of the reputations we still remember from the Napoleonic era, that of Joachim Murat – Napoleon’s brother-in-law and, for a time, favourite lieutenant – stands out. But it is one that, more than most, has been the plaything of those who wish to cast the famous as either hero or rogue. The truth is, however, that Murat was sometimes one, sometimes the other … and sometimes both.\n\nJoachim Murat was famous as a soldier, but overlooked as a king. And while this dashing figure led a heroic and adventurous life, he was not always the hero in his own adventure. This complicates him as a person, and complicates his legacy too, but such complexity has not prevented successive waves of historians from simplifying his biography into that of a vain soldier, addicted to glory. He was vain, and fought, in part, for glory, but he was also much more than that. He was, for example, an important piece in Napoleon’s new ordering of Europe, and also went on to play an unfortunate and controversial role in the French emperor’s downfall.\n\nMurat, son of an innkeeper, had won his spurs as Napoleon’s finest cavalry general, and then won his throne when, in 1808, Napoleon appointed him King of Naples. He loyally ran this strategically important Italian kingdom with his wife, Caroline Bonaparte, for six years until, in 1814 – with Napoleon beaten and in retreat – the royal couple chose to betray their imperial relation and dramatically switched sides to save their crowns. This won them respite for just one year, but it earned them the undying hostility of those who had once idolized Murat as Napoleon’s dutiful general.\n\nJust one year after this dramatic betrayal, an act that still has the power to make one wince, came Murat’s equally dramatic but perhaps inevitable fall. A series of miscalculations took the cavalier king from thinking he had secured his dynasty to fleeing his kingdom. After a brief period as a fugitive and exile in a France wracked by political turmoil, Murat then gambled everything in a rash bid to reverse his fortunes, only to lose everything in those final agonies on the Calabrian shore.\n\nThe idea behind this book was to chart that rapid and remarkable fall, one acted out in parallel to Napoleon’s own disastrous 100 Days, and to try to make some sense of a drama that seemed as sublime as it was ridiculous.\n\nI have tried to present this story as impartially as I can, but with some sympathy for all its victims. As I studied this particular decline and fall, I realized that this episode helps reveal some of the problems inherent in trying to understand how a defeat gets to be presented by those who experienced it, or those who subsequently try to excuse it. This makes Murat’s failure worthy of study in its own right, but it is, of course, also an important event given that Murat lost his throne in one of the first attempts to unite Italy. Although contemporaries did not perhaps realize it, the circumstances surrounding Murat’s death thus came at a critical juncture between two great historical movements. It brought an abrupt end to the first act in Italy’s quest for independence, while also marking the finale of two decades of revolution, war and tumult in Europe.\n\nStill, it is Murat’s fate that is central to this story, and failure always lends events a poignancy to which victory can never really aspire. It seems that failure is also more complex; after all, history tends to ensure that charting the rise of any historical figure is much easier than understanding their mistakes. This is just as true of the final months in the life of Joachim Murat. The missteps and miscalculations that brought him from presiding over his flamboyant court in the spring of 1815 to being condemned to death by a court at Pizzo in Calabria just six months later are hard to explain. And that is largely because, unlike success, failure requires a much more careful examination of both the potential causes and the available sources.\n\nHowever, regarding Murat’s precipitous fall in 1815, it is the sources that prove the most problematic. All of those who participated in these events, and who recorded them for posterity or sought to explain them, had axes to grind and sabres to sharpen. Many of those who had taken part or witnessed key events in the fall of Murat, his brief exile and his unsuccessful landing in Calabria to retake his kingdom, were given to obscuring the truth even if they did not quite succumb to telling outright lies. Although some of them did go as far as that. Francis Maceroni has left at least three differing accounts of what he said to Murat the day before the king launched his attempt to retake his throne, while Ignazio Carabelli wrote an entire book to cover up what he was doing in Ajaccio that same evening. Of Murat’s loyal followers, General Franceschetti, who accompanied Murat to Pizzo, wrote an account that borders on hagiography and omits anything which might make the writer or his hero look bad. Of the others who sailed with Murat, many would play the same trick, and while they were forced to distance themselves in the depositions taken during their own captivity, they eventually emerged as faithful partisans of Murat’s cause (I’m thinking of you, Matthieu Galvani). As for official published records, little reliance can be placed on them when it comes to impartiality. The Minister of Police in Naples even went so far as to claim that they had lured Murat to Calabria to capture him, while a captain of gendarmes in Pizzo claimed the credit for seizing Murat when he landed, a claim loudly imitated by the entire population of that town when they realized that financial rewards were in the offing. We are at least on firmer ground when it comes to unpublished letters and accounts in the archives, yet these too can be drafted to make the writer look good in the eyes of the recipient and, equally, of posterity.\n\nIn this story, actions and behaviours have been countlessly reinvented, but so too has what was said and why. It was the style of nineteenth-century histories that every goodbye takes on the character of a rousing speech, while every harangue becomes a fine example of heroic rhetoric. Everyone is putting on an act for the history books, playing to their own gallery, creating a legend, and this is especially the case when it comes to the final moment. Murat’s most memorable comment, bravely uttered before that firing squad, a phrase that summed up his bravery as well as his vanity, was ‘shoot at my heart, but spare the face’. Well, that turns out not to be true, either.\n\nSuch legends, neat little parables of love or hate, do not sit well with writing a history, but they are often imposed by the cultural or political imperatives of the age. Murat’s fall is just as subject to those imperatives as the decline and fall of Napoleon’s empire, or that of the Romans, even if acted out on a comparatively smaller scale. That process of retelling began at once. No observer writing in 1815 could be neutral on the fate of a Bonaparte, and Joachim Murat was king by right of force of arms and for being married to Napoleon’s sister. The restoration of the Old Order in 1815 saw to it that entire cultures were turned against anyone associated with the Bonaparte clan, and Murat, even if he had betrayed his brother-in-law, would be denigrated by court historians because they needed to see him as just another of Napoleon’s troublesome revolutionaries. For most people in 1816, it stood to reason that Murat was a fool or knave, or both, and a criminal for having tried to unseat the re-established, and rather divine, order that had restored calm across Europe. Then, in the 1820s and 1830s, when that calm seems to have stagnated, and revolutionary glories seemed preferable to regal ineptitude, Murat began to find himself rehabilitated along with those who had served him. Indeed, such a revival in Murat’s post-mortem fortunes was soon to take on even greater import when the dynasty that had killed him, the reviled Bourbons of Naples and Sicily, fell foul of the forces of destiny. For in 1860, the Bourbons were overthrown by an equally rash but rather more successful set of usurpers, Garibaldi’s Red Shirts, and shortly afterwards that useless clan found themselves condemned to the same historical oblivion they had consigned Murat to in October 1815. Murat was now lifted out from obscurity and appointed as an early and prescient advocate of that spirit of unity that had seized all of Italy. He became a hero and his failure a tragedy; and because no hero is ever responsible for his own folly or his own fall, the events leading to his execution at Pizzo also now had to be re-examined and excused.\n\nMurat’s sudden and surprising elevation into Italy’s pantheon of heroes was, no doubt, deserved, but it doomed to failure subsequent attempts to impartially establish his motives and behaviour in the final months of his life. Even if judgement on Murat later gained a little nuance when history began to pretend it was a science, the sober telling of Murat’s ruination was always going to be compromised by accumulated stories that were so partisan and so intoxicated with passion.\n\nDespite the distortions and the lies that complicate a task such as this, I have tried to understand what happened in these last, exciting months in the life of a man raised to greatness but ruined by folly, and to present my version of that story. I am sure I must have introduced my own mistakes and misconceptions. I am also certain that this cannot be the final word. Finding more evidence is possible; it may even now be lying on the shelves of some dusty archive. I have done what I can with the sources I have seen. I therefore close this gentle introduction with the admission that the real truth, the absolute truth, concerning these events lies buried with Murat himself. This admission leads me to one more: the body of that regal hero has yet to be found.\n\nChapter 1\n\nEscape\n\nHistory may lie, but it can also remind us of some important truths. And one of those, one that must still dog the powerful and the ambitious, is that power is much easier to lose than to win. Kings, princelings and presidents beware; status earned or unearned, handed down across generations, or taken in one, can be lost in a moment.\n\nFor Joachim Murat, made king of Naples by Napoleon Bonaparte, that moment came in May 1815. After a rash and unsuccessful attempt at conquering Italy in the spring of that year, he quit his disintegrating army and fled back to his capital, from where he resolved to abandon his kingdom before it could abandon him. As his soldiers quit their colours, and his officials cleared their desks, Joachim Murat, who had ridden at the head of a thousand cavalry charges, prepared to steal away like a thief in the night.\n\nIt was the evening of 19 May 1815. Clad in a grey riding coat of the kind Napoleon had worn in happier times, and with his distinctive curly hair cropped short, Joachim Murat watched as a trunk of clothes and another with 400,000 Francs in cash were loaded onto the Marquis di Giuliano’s coach. He then bade farewell to his queen – Napoleon’s sister, Caroline – stuffed his sash with diamonds and quit the royal palace in Naples. Clambering on board the coach, he ordered his faithful groom, Narcisse Pouleur, to drive them off to the nearby coast and an uncertain future. A month beforehand he had been surrounded by an impressive army and a resplendent staff, but now, in defeat, his entourage was nervous and modest. He was accompanied by his loyal valets Charles Thillier, Armand-Victor Blanchard (known as Armand) and Leblanc. The soldiers serving as escort were General Eugene Bonafous and Colonel Pierre Bonafous,¹ as well as Murat’s aides de camp, the Marquis de Giuliano and the 38-year-old General Joseph Marie Thomas Rossetti. Fortunately for us, Rossetti, a normally taciturn man from Turin, was an inveterate diarist and his entry for that night describes Murat’s escape:\n\n‘At eight the king climbed into the carriage of the Marquis de Giuliano, his aide de camp, and we set off for the caves of Posilippo where fresh horses awaited us, and we reached Pozzuoli at dusk. The officer in charge of the town gate asked us who goes there and I went forward and made myself known to this officer without giving too much away. However, as we passed through the town the king was recognised. The governor sent an officer over to warn us to be careful because some armed peasants had been seen hereabouts sporting red [Bourbon] cockades and it was thought they had been sent from Sicily. The officer added that he would send out a patrol of the Civic Guard to clear the way. The king paid no attention to this and we continued on our way and at eleven that evening we were at Miniscola [sic; Miliscola] where Major Malceswki [sic; Colonel Malczewski] waited for us with two boats. We waited half an hour more for Monsieur Decoussy [August de Coussy], the king’s secretary, and for my brother, who was also coming with us, and no sooner had they arrived than we embarked from a headland and set sail for Gaeta.’²\n\nThe boats on the beach at Miliscola near Bacoli had been commandeered by Colonel Jan Adam Malczewski and General Armand Millet de Villeneuve. Upon arrival, Murat’s party had handed over the coach and their horses to Millet, who returned to Naples, and then made their way on foot towards Torrefumo, before clambering down the sandy cliffs to the waiting boats.\n\nThe king was fleeing his kingdom. He had ruled for seven years over his corner of Napoleon’s empire. He had tried his best and Naples had nearly flourished under him. Generous to his enemies, endlessly forgiving to his friends, his panache and vanity were more obvious than his intellect. Yet he had earned his crown, or at least done more for it than the stuffed robes of the Ancien Régime ever had, although Murat acknowledged that he was only king because of his brother-in-law’s generosity. Well, perhaps not generosity, for it was Napoleon’s preferred system to place family on the thrones of conquered Europe, and so, while he reserved the choicest parts for himself and France, he established the Bonaparte clan on thrones vacated by those pretending to divine, rather than imperial, right. In Italy, Napoleon made himself king in the north but needed a lieutenant he could trust for the more unstable south, where the throne of Naples had been vacated, albeit unwillingly, by the congenitally depraved Bourbons. The latter had fled to Sicily, nursing resentment at British expense, so Napoleon selected his lawyerly elder brother, Joseph, for king. Joseph was, however, promoted to Spain in 1808, in a troubling example of dynastic overreach; as Naples could not be left vacant in case the Bourbons attempted a return, so Napoleon was glad to gift it to Joachim Murat and his wife, Maria Annunciata Carolina, the emperor’s youngest sister and, by all accounts, the second most capable Bonaparte.\n\nNaples was, for all its faults – poverty, stagnation and a lust for violent revolt – quite a gift. Murat’s first kingdom was, at least geographically, impressive, forming the entire south of the Italian peninsula and dominating much of the central Mediterranean, boasting a capital that even some Frenchmen considered second only to Paris. The land itself sustained its people, and had the resources and potential to be even richer and more prosperous were it not for the fact that, hitherto, it had been cruelly mismanaged. And were it not for the fact that, throughout this period, Murat’s kingdom laboured under the dead hand of war.\n\nJoachim Murat would not shield Naples from the wars consuming Europe; after all, he was, first and foremost, a soldier. Son of an innkeeper from near Cahors, he had joined the French Army in 1787, but it had been the Revolution that had been his making; promotion and advancement had been especially rapid after he had caught the eye of Napoleon. The Corsican, the Revolution’s best general, and soon to be the general in charge of the Revolution, conquered Italy and brought the empires of central Europe to their knees. In every successful battle, Murat had always been to the fore, breaking squares and sabring squadrons, bolstering Napoleon’s reputation and aiding his consolidation of power. As the Revolution was forgotten in this lust for glory, the rewards of lands and titles were showered upon the humble Frenchman. Murat found himself marshal, grand duke, Admiral of France and then, finally, king.\n\nMurat assumed the throne as King Joachim Napoleon in July 1808, when, sword in one hand and sceptre in the other, the Cardinal Archbishop of Naples positioned the crown among his curly locks. King Joachim and Queen Caroline began their rule energetically enough, introducing modernizing reforms in the French style, battling stagnation by rationalizing laws and finances, and – no doubt to the considerable regret of the Cardinal Archbishop – breaking the power of the Church through land reform and the adoption of the Code Napoleon. They were popular enough,³ but would have earned more affection from their modernized subjects had they been able to end that other blight on the land: the incessant demand for blood and money to fuel Napoleon’s constant conquests. The Neapolitans were not willing to die, or fight much either, for a cause that was clearly not their cause; and when, after 1809, conscription was expanded and Napoleon’s demands for troops for his invasions of Spain and Russia increased, Naples bridled at the cost. War closer to home was just as ruinous, and conscription for Napoleon – just as much as Bourbon money and arms – fed an insurgency that ravaged Calabria, Murat’s most impoverished province, for much of his reign.\n\nMurat would eventually triumph over that insurgency, but disasters in northern Europe proved a more existential threat. Napoleon had been routed in Russia in 1812, then driven from Germany, and soon he retained control of just France and Italy. As the coalition facing Napoleon closed in on Italy’s rich resources, it was increasingly plain to Murat and Caroline that only some dramatic change in fortune might save them. They certainly opted for the dramatic, surprising everyone, and most especially Napoleon, by changing sides. This was an act of betrayal in which Murat lost his honour to keep his throne, but it delighted the Austrians, who promptly seized northern Italy. While the British were less taken with ‘the person who currently exercises power in Naples’ – after all, they had been hosting the Bourbon King Ferdinand and his queen in exile in Sicily – they were pragmatic enough to see that Murat’s treason hastened Napoleon’s inevitable end.\n\nAlthough many of his French officers promptly resigned in protest, Murat mustered enough Neapolitans to make a bold foray into northern Italy in February 1814. There, deaf to Napoleon’s curses, his troops took an active, although not very active, part in the coalition against the French Empire. They marched northwards accompanied by their king and the lingering stench of betrayal, and had entered Rome and pushed through Parma before Napoleon, beaten in France and ejected from Paris, ended the unhappy war that April and abdicated in favour of his son.\n\nThe Allies ignored this optimistic transfer of power to young Napoleon II, sending the first and most dangerous Napoleon into exile on Elba and bringing back the Bourbons so they could trample over all the glory of the empire and undo all the gains of the Revolution. Murat and Caroline therefore found themselves in the unenviable position of being the last of the Bonaparte clan left with a crown, and as the palaces of Europe again filled with those whose only claim to legitimacy sprang from acceptable levels of incest, their position in Naples seemed increasingly tenuous. Betraying Napoleon had not won them any friends, nor had Murat’s indiscrete hints that he might like to see himself at the head of a united Italy, so it was not long before Europe’s crowned heads were plotting a betrayal of their own. At the Congress of Vienna, convened in late 1814 to allow those mandated by God or Prince Metternich to settle the fate of peoples, Europe’s diplomats agreed that Murat would have to go and that Ferdinand of Bourbon, evicted by the French in February 1806, should be brought back from Sicily and restored to his Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.⁴ Soon, amid all the polite talk of divine right and the noise of turning back clocks, the delegates were all making barbed jokes that ‘Murat will be soon keeping his brother-in-law company’ on Elba. On 25 February 1815, Cardinal Ercole Consalvi was even telling a concerned Pope: ‘Murat’s fall is decided.’\n\nThen everything changed: Napoleon escaped from his island prison. With just a few hundred loyal men, the Corsican adventurer landed in the south of France and marched on Paris to put back on his imperial robes and reclaim his empire. The Congress of Vienna, hesitating briefly between shock and disgust, declared Napoleon outside the law before the diplomats scurried home just as the French, enthusiastic again for their empire, welcomed Napoleon back to Paris as their emperor and turned their backs on the Bourbons as they fled for Belgium and more sad days of exile.\n\nFurther south, another ruler was on the move. Murat, who had sensed that the Allies had been sharpening their knives while looking in his direction, sought to turn Allied confusion to his own advantage. He planned to quickly seize the rest of Italy for himself, uniting that tired peninsula under his banners, distracting the Allies at a critical moment and thus easing the pressure on Napoleon. This, or so the king calculated, would win him territory but also, perhaps, earn him imperial forgiveness for the treason of the previous year. Consequently, declaring that the hour of vengeance had come, Murat began to marshal his soldiers along the northern limits of his anxious kingdom while he lingered a little longer in Naples in an attempt to win over his wife to this eminently risky endeavour. Caroline was, however, against a war with the armed might of Austria. She was outspoken in her disdain, even telling one visitor: ‘You would think it enough for a peasant from Le Quercy to sit on the fairest throne of Italy; but no, he needs to have the entire peninsula.’\n\nMurat, having failed in a domestic campaign to win over his wife, clambered into an eight-horse carriage on 17 March to begin his military campaign against the vast and equally formidable Austrian Army. However, his plans were rather at odds with Napoleon’s own ideas for the coming clash of empires. Napoleon did not then wish to antagonize the Austrians too much, hoping to keep them neutral and to encourage them to return his wife and son from Vienna. His most recent advice to Murat had therefore limited itself to asking the king to distract the Austrians rather than charge directly at them.⁵ Murat, however, was in a bellicose mood, and on 26 March his messenger handed Napoleon a note declaring that he would advance to the Po ‘to show you I have always been devoted to you and to justify to you and the whole of Europe that the opinion you had of me was right’.\n\nNapoleon’s opinion of Murat was not what it had once been, but in any case, the emperor had no opportunity to give it.
