This, for some unaccountable reason, was not received in very good spirit by some one who signed himself \"Carlo F. Dxss, Painter,\" under the article headed \"Harrison's Courtesy,\" in Pasadena Star, July 20th, in which he says: 'A relative of Harrison's is boasting of getting a letter,' etc. 'Carlo' evidently wrote that article prompted by the spirit of meanness or jealousy. It is not so much what is said or written, but the spirit in which it is said. 'Carlo F. Dxss, Painter,' may consider it a crime to be related to 'our next President,' but others may think differently. The lady in question is a lady in every sense of the term - not seeking notoriety, but attending to her home duties. I hope 'Carlo F. Dxss, Painter,' will now be satisfied with this notice of his weakness, unenviable as it is.\n\nLos Angeles Times, 27 Oct 1894\n\nCapt. Dxss has painted six pictures for W. C. Stuart's new house on Orange Grove avenue.\n\nPrince and Princess\n\nLos Angeles Herald, 28 June 1900\n\nA strange story of royalty, love marriage and concealed identity has come to light. Carlo F. Dxss, the artist and vocalist who has lived here for 14 years, is not Carlo Dxss but Carlo August Frederick Henry Murat, a prince of Naples. The story leaked out at the time the prince was married to Miss Julia Sheltema, daughter of Captain and Mrs. J. T. Sheltema of 536 Herkimer street. Mr. and Mrs. Dxss, or rather Prince and Princess Murat, were married last Saturday at San Bernardino. They tried to keep the matter secret but it got out and a reporter who called at Herkimer street yesterday was bluffed off by Mrs. Sheltema, who said that it was nonsense to think that the Miss Sheltema who was married in San Bernardino was her daughter. Mrs. Sheltema made a fine distinction between these words and an out-and-out denial. The bluff worked all right, but today the family decided to own up. The prince is 62 and his bride 23. He came here from Naples in 1866, and has lived in Pasadena 14 years. He changed his name for political reasons. He knew Captain and Mrs. Sheltema a long time ago in Holland and met them again here. He has been engaged to Miss Sheltema for a long time. They went to San Bernardino to be married because they thought they could keep the secret from their friends for a year or so, when they would be better ready to spring it. They propose to go to Europe. The bride and groom are very happy and now that the story is out, they say they are glad it is over with. They will live here for the present.\n\nMan of Royal Descent is Married to a Pasadena Belle\n\nLos Angeles Times, 28 Jun 1900\n\nBride of a Prince\n\nMonday's Times contained an announcement of the marriage in San Bernardino last Saturday of Carlo August Frederick Henry Murat, a native and Prince of the former kingdom of Naples, to Miss Juliet Scheltema. Friends of Miss Scheltema, whose home is on Herkimer street in this city, saw the story, and accused her of being the bride, but as she had not been known to have the acquaintance of a Prince, and as she strenuously denied the report, it was decided that the couple married at San Bernardino were other than Pasadenans. Yesterday, however, Miss Scheltema that was, arrayed herself in a new white dress, and went to call upon some friends. When her resemblance to a bride was commented on, her confusion betrayed her and she confessed that she really had been married. The identity of her titled husband was disclosed when she said that he was Carlo F. Dxss, the Vernon avenue landscape artist, who has the distinction of being the only man in Pasadena who eschews vowels in the spelling of his surname.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Dxss, or Murat, as they probably will be known henceforth, were seen today at the home of Capt. J. T. Scheltema on Herkimer street, and, while they were chagrined that the news of their marriage had become public, their happiness seems to have overcome their disappointment, for they are as merry as others of the vast host of June brides and grooms. Mr. Murat is 62 years old, is a linguist, a singer, and artist of note, and a man of culture. Mrs. Murat is 23, is pretty, is a scholar in music, and is intelligent and vivacious. They say their reasons for keeping the wedding a secret were prompted by an aversion to attracting publicity to the rank of Mr. Murat, for the reason that he considers himself too poor to keep up appearances expected in one of royal blood. The couple did not care to marry under an assumed name, so they decided to go to San Bernardino to have the knot tied. They left Saturday morning for that city, Miss Scheltema and her mother going on the Santa FÃ© train, while Mr. Murat and Capt. Scheltema went via the Southern Pacific. The Prince secured a license from the County Clerk's office, and was walking about the Courthouse with Capt. Scheltema, both wearing decorations received by them while serving in foreign armies, when Mr. Murat was approached by an affable gentleman who was attracted by the cross of the French Legion of Honor, worn on the breast of the Pasadena artist. Addressing Mr. Murat in French, the stranger carried on a long conversation, in which he learned of the mission to San Bernardino, and it was from this source that the story became public. Mrs. Murat laughingly said that women are accused of being unable to keep secrets, but she playfully chided her husband for disclosing their secret to a total stranger.\n\nCarlo August Frederick Henry Murat has lived in Pasadena under the name of Carlo F. Dxss for fourteen years. He was born in Naples, of which kingdom his grandfather was ruler. He spent his early boyhood in Holland, and when 14 years old he went to France. He served through the Crimean war as an aide on the general staff of the French army and received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and a number of other metals for bravery. He came to the United States in 1866, and has followed his art in various parts of this country.\n\nMurat Estate Children Begin Contest\n\nLos Angeles Times, 12 May 1904\n\nThere is to be a contest over the distribution of the estate of the late Carlo F. Murat, who, it is claimed, was the son of the one time King of Naples, and the legitimate heir to the Neapolitan throne, if, in the whirligig of time, that monarchy should be restored.\n\nJuliet Murat, the widow, filed her petition to be appointed administratrix, alleging that the estate consisted only of personal property valued at $100, but yesterday the children of Prince Murat filed their contest. Jesse Dxss Murat and Gertrude Athey Murat are the children by a first marriage and there is not much love lost between them and their stepmother.\n\nIt is the contention of the son and daughter of the deceased that the estate of their father consists of personal property, it is true, but of a value exceeding the insignificant sum alleged by very many hundreds of dollars. They aver that during the lifetime of their mother there were a great number of very valuable paintings, and that many of these remained in their father's possession to the end. Then, too, they say that their father had in his possession a number of heirlooms not only valuable in themselves, but of a very large additional value by reason of their historic associations. The actual value of these works of art and vertu it is difficult to estimate, and that has not been even attempted, but the children are determined to contest the right of Mme. Murat to absorb them all other than through the regular procedure of the court. In the contest that has been filed it is set out that Mme. Murat is not a proper person to have charge of their father's estate for the reason that on account of \"her bias, prejudice, hatred, and ill will against the children,\" she will use her power as administratrix to prevent them from receiving anything out of the estate. In these premises they have nominated Public Administrator McGarvin as a suitable person to take the matter in charge.\n\nGiven Jewels for Orphans: Pasadena Woman Donates 'Em to Noble Cause\n\nField Marshal's Descendant Parts with Heirlooms\n\nThey Include Valuable Rings Owned by Napoleon\n\nLos Angeles Times, 19 Jul 1917\n\nPasadena, July 19 - Mme. Juliet Murat, widow of Capt. Carlo Frederick Murat, a direct descendant of Joachim Murat, Napoleon's famous field marshal, announced yesterday that she had decided to donate a valuable collection of heirlooms of the Murat and Napoleon families to the cause of the French orphans. The collection consists mostly of jewelry and includes several rings once owned by Napoleon and Josephine. Capt. Murat, who died in Pasadena about ten years ago, was a veteran of the French army and was decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honor by Naoloeon III. Many of the most valued personal belongings of Field Marshal Murat, a number of them gifts from Napoleon, were handed down to Capt. Murat and given by him to his wife. Mme. Murat lives at No. 540 Herkimer street. Yesterday she invited a number of friends to her home for a last view of the treasures. For some time Mme. Murat has been supporting several French orphans.\n\nReferences"
