The director was Michael Curtiz, an immigrant film director from Hungary.\n\nThe movie Casablanca had 11 Oscar nominations and won 3 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay.\n\nMichael Curtiz was a prolific director who made 180 films in his career.\n\nThe black and white film, Curtiz, about him, was fascinating. It has been streaming recently.\n\n“As Time Goes By” is performed by Dooley Wilson who played Sam in the movie. Sam is seated at the piano, and Ingrid Bergman says, “Play it Sam.” (Not “Play it Again Sam”)"
