        "text": "Details\n\nMICHAEL CURTIZ ACADEMY AWARD FOR \"CASABLANCA\"\n\nWarner Bros., 1942\n\nThe 'Best Director' Academy Award presented to Michael Curtiz for directing the most oft-quoted Hollywood film ever made. The weighty gold-plated Oscar statuette stands on a reel of film which is atop a circular black marble base; a rectangular brass plaque on the front reads Academy First Award/to/Michael Curtiz/For Direction of/Casablanca while a smaller brass plaque on the back notes Academy of/Motion Picture/Arts and Sciences/First Award/1942. Curtiz was nominated in this prestigious category four other times throughout his stellar fifty-plus year career; for \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" in 1942 (See Lot 34), \"Angels with Dirty Faces\" and \"Four Daughters\" both in 1938 and \"Captain Blood\" in 1935, though \"Casablanca\" was his only win.\n\nHeight: 12 inches\n\nFurther details\n\nThe black stone base of this Oscar should be noted as it is 'pre-war.' During World War II, when materials were scarce, the Academy started using plaster for their Oscar bases as it was less expensive. (After the war, spun brass was used and still is today.) Mr. Curtiz's award is unique in that it still retains its vintage 'pre-war' black stone base. Also, please note that the statuette portion was officially replated by The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."
