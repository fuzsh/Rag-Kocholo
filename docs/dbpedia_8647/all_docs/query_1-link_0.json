        "text": "Filmography\n\nMichael Curtiz (1886–1962) was a Hungarian-born American film director whose career spanned from 1912 to 1961. During this period, he directed 178 films.[1] He began his cinematic career in Hungary, then moved to Austria, and, finally, to the United States. As his biographer, Alan K. Rode, notes, \"A cinematic pioneer, Curtiz made a seamless transition from hand-cranking cameras in silent films to directing the first sound feature where the characters spoke their parts. He led the way in two- and three-color Technicolor, directed the first motion-picture produced in VistaVision, and worked extensively in CinemaScope.\"[2] Rode also notes that \"he helmed rousing adventures, westerns, musicals, war movies, romances, historical dramas, horror films, tearjerkers, melodramas, comedies, spectacles, and film noirs\".[3]\n\nBorn in Budapest, Curtiz graduated from Hungary's Royal Academy of Theatre and Art in 1906.[4] After six years as a stage actor and director, he joined the nascent Hungarian film industry.[5] His first film credit was the 1912 drama, Maés Holnap (\"Today and Tomorrow\").[6] In 1913, after directing several films, Curtiz traveled to Denmark to hone his skills as an apprentice for director August Blom. Returning to Hungary, he became a freelance director for several film companies.[7] In 1919, Curtiz immigrated to Vienna, and became one of Austria's top film directors. His first film there was Die Dame Mit Dem Schwarzen Handschuh (\"The Lady with the Black Gloves\", 1919), starring his wife, Lucy Doraine.[8] Among his subsequent Austrian films were the two-part epic Sodom and Gomorrah (1922), and Die Sklavenkönigin (\"The Slave Queen\", 1924). The latter film was released in the United Kingdom as The Moon of Israel. Harry Warner, one of the founders of Warner Bros., instructed his brother, Jack, to view the film. After doing so, they were impressed enough to offer Curtiz a contract to direct in the United States.[9][a]\n\nIn 1926, Curtiz began his American career with The Third Degree, starring Dolores Costello. He followed this with several more films starring her, including the part-talking biblical epic Noah's Ark (1928). In 1932 and 1933, respectively, Curtiz directed the two-color Technicolor horror films Doctor X and Mystery of the Wax Museum, both starring Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray. In 1935, Curtiz directed the swashbuckling adventure Captain Blood, which made major stars of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. He followed this with several move adventure films starring them, including The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), and Dodge City (1939), and Flynn in The Sea Hawk (1940). During this period, Curtiz also made the gangster films, Kid Galahad (1937), starring Edward G. Robinson, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart, and Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) with James Cagney and Bogart, and the dramatic film Four Daughters (1938), which brought stardom to John Garfield.[11] In 1941, Curtiz directed Robinson and Garfield in The Sea Wolf.[12] During the war years (1941–1945), Curtiz directed James Cagney and Joan Crawford into Academy Award-winning performances with, respectively, Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) and Mildred Pierce (1945).[13] In between these, Curtiz directed his magnum opus, Casablanca (1942), with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Curtiz's only Academy Award for Best Director.[14]\n\nIn the post-war years, Curtiz directed Life with Father (1947), an adaptation of a popular Broadway play, and the film noir The Unsuspected (1948), his first film by his own production company.[15] For his company, he also produced, and directed, Romance on the High Seas (1948), a musical which marked the film debut of Doris Day.[16] Curtiz eventually disbanded his company, and remained a contract director with Warner Bros. until 1954.[17] Among his later films under his Warners contract was another film noir, The Breaking Point, starring John Garfield.[18] After leaving Warner Bros., Curtiz directed White Christmas (1954) for Paramount Pictures, the first film in VistaVision and the highest-grossing film in his career.[19] Also for Paramount, he directed the Elvis Presley vehicle, King Creole (1958). In 1961, Curtiz directed his final film, The Comancheros, with John Wayne.[20]\n\nFor his contribution to cinema, Curtiz was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[21] In the 1998 and 2007 listings of the American Film Institute's Greatest American Films, Casablanca ranked, respectively, in second and third place, while Yankee Doodle Dandy ranked 100 on the first list, and 98 on the second.[22] As of 2018, four films directed by Curtiz have been added to the National Film Registry: The Adventures of Robin Hood, Casablanca, Mildred Pierce, and Yankee Doodle Dandy.[23]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe filmography of Michael Curtiz is derived from the one presented in the biography by Alan K. Rode.[24]\n\nHungarian films: 1912–1913\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael Curtiz was born Mano Kaminer in Budapest in 1886. In 1906, he graduated from Hungary's Royal Academy of Theatre and Art.[4] Under the stage name of Mihály Kertész, he established himself as a stage actor, performing in classical and modern theatrical dramas. Eventually, he turned to director as well.[25] In 1912, Kertész entered Hungary's motion picture industry, as an actor and director for the Projectograph Film Company. His first film for them was also the company's initial feature.[26] All of Curtiz's films from this period are lost.[27]\n\nHungarian films: 1912–1913 Year Title Function Notes Ref Original English translation Director Other 1912 Ma és holnap \"Today and Tomorrow\" Yes Yes Projectograph Production; Curtiz wrote the screenplay for this film, and also played a supporting role [6] 1913 Krausz doktor a vérpadon \"Doctor Krausz on the Scaffold\" Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\"[b] [28] 1913 Gyerünk csak \"Come On\" Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\"[b] [28] 1913 Házasodik az uram \"My Husband's Getting Married\" Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\"[b] [28]\n\nDanish film: 1913\n\n[edit]\n\nIn July 1913, Kertész left Hungary, and travelled to Denmark to train as a film director. There, he went to work for the Nordisk Film Company, as an assistant director to August Blom.[29]\n\nDanish film: 1913 Year Title Function Notes Ref Director Other 1913 Atlantis Yes Nordisk Films Kompagni Production (Denmark); directed by August Blom; Curtiz played a supporting role in the film, and was also an assistant director; prints survive [30]\n\nHungarian films: 1914–1919\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter six months in Denmark, Mihály Kertész returned to Hungary. There, he returned as a film director, alternating between the Projectograph, Uher, and Kino-Riport companies.[7] With the coming of World War I in 1914, Kertész was called up by the Austro-Hungarian army, and served as an artillery officer.[31] After being discharged in 1915, he resumed film-making, and married actress Lucy Doraine, who would star in several of his films. In 1917, a new film company, Phönix-Film, was formed by the merger of Projectagraph and Star-Film Productions.[32] Kertész served as their head of production until 1919.[7] Except where noted, all of the films from this period are lost.[27]\n\nHungarian films: 1914–1919 Year Title Function Notes Ref Original English translation Director Other 1913 Mozikirály \"Movie King\" Yes Projectograph Production; features Sári Fedák; a \"sketch film\" [28] 1913 Az Utolsó Bohém \"The Last Bohemian\" Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\" [33] 1913 Kablélek \"Captive Souls\" Yes Projectograph Production; features Sári Fedák [34] 1914 Az Aranyásó \"The Golddigger\" Yes A \"sketch film\"; scenario by Ferenc Molnár; loosely based on a story by Bret Harte [35] 1914 A Hercegnó Pongtolája \"The Princess in a Nightrobe\" Yes Kino-Riport Production; \"sketch film\" [36] 1914 Az Éjzaka Katona \"Prisoner of the Night\" Yes Yes Projectograph Production; Curtiz acted in this film, and wrote the screenplay, as well as directed [37] 1914 A Szökött Katona \"The Escaped Soldier\" Yes Miklỏs Pảstory Production; screenplay by Miklós Pásztory [37] 1914 A Kölcsönkért Csecsemök \"The Borrowed Babies\" Yes Jenő Janovics Production; based on the stage play Baby Mine by Margaret Mayo [38] 1914 A Tolonc \"The Undesirable\" Yes Jenő Janovics Production; with Lili Berky and Victor Varconi; prints survive[c] [40] 1914 Bánk Bán \"Bánk the Regent\" Yes Jenő Janovics Production; based on the play by Ferenc Erkel [41] 1914 Sarga Liliom \"Yellow Lily\" Yes Directed by Fẻlix Vanyl; Curtiz played a supporting role in this film [42] 1915 A Paradicsom \"The Tomato\" Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\" [43] 1915 Akit Ketten Szeretnek \"One Who Is Loved By Two\" Yes Yes Projectograph Production; a \"sketch film\"; Curtiz starred, as well as directed [43] 1915 Cox És Box \"Cox and Box\" Yes Proja Films; directed by Márton Garas; Curtiz played a supporting role in this film [42] 1916 A Bánat Assonya \"Melancholy Lady\" Yes Yes Screenplay by Curtiz [36] 1916 Makkhetes \"Seven of Spades\" Yes Kino-Riport Production [36] 1916 A Karthausi \"The Carthusians\" Yes Star-Film Production [36] 1916 A Doktor Úr \"Mr. Doctor\" Yes Kino-Riport Production; based on a play by Ferenc Molnár [44] 1916 Az Ezüst Kecske \"The Medic\" Yes Kino-Riport Production; based on a novel by Sándor Bródy [44] 1916 A Farkas \"The Wolf\" Yes Yes Kino-Riport Production; with Victor Varconi and Lucy Doraine; screenplay by Curtiz and Ladislaus Vajda [45] 1916 A Fekete Szivárvány \"The Black Rainbow\" Yes Kino-Riport Production; with Vilma Medgyaszay [46] 1916 A Magyar Föld Ereje \"The Strength of the Fatherland\" Yes A propaganda film for the Hungarian Red Cross [46] 1916 Károly és Zita királyné koronázása Budapesten \"The Coronation of King Charles IV and Queen Zita in Budapest\" Yes A depiction of the coronation of the last Habsburg monarchs; Curtiz may have directed this film, and is seen filming a parade; prints survive [47] 1917 Halálcsengö \"The Death-Bell\" Yes Star-Film Production [32] 1917 Zoárd Mester \"Master Zoard\" Yes Yes Phönix-Film Production; screenplay by Curtiz [48] 1917 Tatárjárás \"Tartar Invasion\" Yes Yes Glória-Film Production; screenplay by Curtiz; a four-minute fragment survives [48] 1917 Az Árendás Zsidó \"Jean the Tenant\" Yes Phönix-Film Production [49] 1917 A Kuruzsló \"The Charlatan\" Yes Phönix-Film Production; based on a play by Imre Földes; remade by Curtiz as Namenlos (\"Nameless\", 1923) and Alias the Doctor (1933) [32] 1917 A Senki Fia \"Nobody's Son\" Yes Phönix-Film Production [48] 1917 A Szentjóbi Erdö Titka \"Secret of St. Job Forest\" Yes Phönix-Film Production; features Dezső Kertész (a.k.a.

By the end of 1920, he had established himself as the company's top director.[58] As in Hungary, his wife, Lucy Doraine, appeared in several of his Austrian films.
