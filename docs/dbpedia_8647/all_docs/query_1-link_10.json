        "text": "Curtiz began acting in and then directing films in his native Hungary in 1912. After WWI, he continued his filmmaking career in Austria and Germany and into the early 1920s when he directed films in other countries in Europe. Moving to the US in 1926, he started making films in Hollywood for Warner Bros. and became thoroughly entrenched in the studio system. His films during the 1930s and '40s encompassed nearly every genre imaginable and some, including Casablanca (1942) and Solange ein Herz schlägt (1945), are considered to be film classics. His brilliance waned in the 1950s when he made a number of mediocre films for studios other than Warner. He directed his last film in 1961, a year before his death at 74.\n\nMichael Curtiz was a Hungarian-born (as Mihaly Kertesz) American director who turned out some of the best-regarded films ever to come out of Hollywood. He received his diploma from the School for Dramatic Arts in Hungary in 1906. He then went to live in Pécs, then Szeged. He began acting in and then directing films in his native Hungary in 1912. The next year he went to Denmark to study the newest achievements of film art in the studios of the then flourishing Nordisk company. Here he worked as assistant and director and acted as the main character in Atlantis (1913). Returning to Hungary in 1914, he worked for Jenö Janovics's production company in Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca, Romania). In 1915 he returned to Budapest and the next year worked for Kinoriport, then as a director for Phönix until late 1918. He shot a total of 38 films in Hungary. He was one of the most productive and educated artists in Hungary at the beginning of the silent film era. In 1919 he shot Jön az öcsém (1919), based on a popular poem by Hungarian poet Antal Farkas. Hungary entered a period of political instability known as the Commune, and Curtiz settled down in Vienna, Austria. After World War I--during which he fought in the Hungarian army--he continued his filmmaking career in Austria and Germany, and in the early 1920s he began directing films in other European countries. Curtiz moved to the US in 1926 and began making films for US studios, mainly Warner Brothers, where he spent most of his career and where he directed such classic films as Casablanca (1942), Die Abenteuer des Robin Hood (1938), Der Verrat des Surat Khan (1936), Herr des Wilden Westens (1939) and Solange ein Herz schlägt (1945), among many others."
