        "text": "This volume offers insightful essays analyzing the reasons for this film classic's acclaim, as well as its influences on the modern film industry.\n\nConsidered one of the greatest films of the twentieth century, Casablanca earned three Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and instant critical and commercial success following its release in 1942. Directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, this romantic drama is still hailed for its all-star cast, exceptional screenwriting, and memorable soundtrack, and continues to be ranked as one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.\n\nThe essays add to the critical \"conversation\" from different angles; collectively explaining why Casablanca is so highly regarded-still, or despite its flaws-and why it will likely remain so. Certain themes resonate among the essays, as contributors consider whether Casablanca was, in fact, the \"happiest of happy accidents\" that critic Andrew Sarris posited and try to identify the reasons for its success.\n\nEach essay is 2,500 to 5,000 words in length, and all essays conclude with a list of \"Works Cited,\" along with endnotes.\n\nThe volume's appendices offer a section of useful reference resources, including:\n\nCast\n\nAwards & Honors\n\nChronology of Director's Life\n\nDirector's Filmography\n\nBibliography\n\nDetailed Bio of the Editor\n\nContributors\n\nGeneral Subject Index\n\nEach volume in theCritical Insights: Film collection focuses on a single film classic from American cinema, providing detailed insight and contextual analysis about each subject. These brand-new titles make perfect additions to academic, public, and community Film Studies collections everywhere."
