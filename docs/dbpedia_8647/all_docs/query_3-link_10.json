        "text": "What is the relationship between you and Michael Curtiz?\n\nMy grandmother was a younger sister of Michael Curtiz. There were seven siblings in the Kaminer (Kertész) family: Michael (Mihály), Gábor, David (known in the family as Dezső), Lajos, Regina, Kornélia and my grandmother, Margit. After Michael, my great-grandmother was the first to arrive in the United States; she was brought to Hollywood by Michael ahead of the persecution of the Jews in 1939. She was soon followed by Gábor and David. However, Margit, Lajos, Regina and Kornélia stayed in Hungary. My grandmother was deported in 1944 and her husband died in Auschwitz. She and her daughter, Kató, survived the Holocaust. My father, Lóránd Manhart, studied in Strasbourg during the war, from where he sailed to the United States in 1941. My grandmother followed him after the war, and my great-aunt, Kató, along with her husband and two daughters, came after them only years later.\n\nI am sure you have a few personal memories of Michael Curtiz?\n\nYes, as a child I met him a few times in Hollywood. He had a large house with staff. I remember his wife, Bess Meredith Lucas, too. Michael once asked me whether I wanted to appear in one of his movies, but according to my parents I replied with a categorical ‘No’. On one occasion, we had lunch with them and as a child I have this indelible memory that there was paper decoration even on the fried chicken. I was also amazed at the secret button underneath the table, with which he called the staff. The house with large swimming pool stood on the top of a hill at the end of a long drive. It may have been in Encino, but I’m not certain of that.\n\nHow did you end up with the photo album?\n\nThe album was Michael Curtiz’s, maybe Warner Bros. Studio made it for him, and later it was given to my parents. A few years ago my father dug it out and gave it to me when my daughter decided that she would be an actress in Hollywood. She did indeed appear in a few films under the name Emilie Odeile in 2004 and 2005, but she quit the acting profession after this. However, the album stayed with us.\n\nThe album contains quite a few rare photographs that any American film collection would be delighted to own. Why did you decide to present the album to the Hungarian Film Archive?\n\nAfter my father passed away, I thought that the album should go somewhere where it would be appreciated. Ági Rados, my Hungarian friend, was the one who first found Tamás Yvan Topolánszky, winner of the main prize at the 42nd Montreal International Film Festival for his film Curtiz, which is about my great-uncle. Tamás told me about his film and I spoke to him about the album. Initially I promised to give him the album, but when I got in contact with the Film Archive I thought this would be a better place.\n\nYou were born in America yet you speak fluent, accentless Hungarian. How did you learn the language so well?\n\nYes, I was born in California and I have lived here all my life. I worked in an attorney’s office in San Francisco for 30 years, currently I live in St. Helena with my husband, where we have a winery. But my parents and my grandmother spoke to me in Hungarian right from birth, thanks to which I speak the language well.\n\nHave you ever been to Hungary?\n\nI visited Hungary with my husband for the first time last July. It’s a beautiful country... we toured Budapest and the Balaton.\n\nWe hope that from now on you will come to Hungary more often. Thank you very much for the album, which will be a treasured item in our photo archive collection.\n\nI am delighted that you are pleased with these surviving photos of my great-uncle, Michael Curtiz. If only my grandmother and my father could have lived to see that his memory is held in such high esteem."
