        "text": "The two stars of Casablanca, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman\n\nMichael Curtiz (Mihály Kertész) was born on December 25, 1886 in Budapest under the name Manó Kaminer. He wanted to be an actor, so in 1903, at the age of 17, he ran away from home with a circus. He graduated in Budapest in 1906, and worked in Pécs and Szeged (both cities in southern Hungary). As an actor, he was almost the first to start making silent films. In Denmark in 1912, he directed his first film, The Last Bohemian.\n\nHis 1915 silent film The Exile, based on the folk play by Ede Tóth, was shown in Denmark and hailed by critics as the first outstanding Hungarian film, a priceless work of film and theater history, reports Magyar Nemzet.\n\nThe original work was long thought lost after the Second World War, however, in 2006, the only surviving copy was found in New York. After its restoration, it was shown in Hungary in 2014, at the Palace of Arts (now Müpa). The Exile is the only film in which we can admire the performance of the famous Hungarian actress Mari Jászai.\n\nCurtiz worked in film factories in Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsvár, Romania) and Berlin before emigrating to the United States in 1926.\n\nIn Hollywood, he made such successful movies as Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), Captain Blood (1935), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and Mildred Pierce (1945).\n\nHis most famous directorial work, however, was Casablanca in 1942, one of the world’s most popular romantic films, for which Michael Curtiz won the Academy Award for Best Director.\n\nThe film starred Humphrey Bogart, who was also born on Christmas Day (December 25, 1899) and is still remembered as the most famous Hollywood male star of all time.\n\nFact\n\nCasablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Filmed and set during World War II, it focuses on an American expatriate (Bogart) who must choose between his love for a woman (Bergman) and helping her husband (Henreid), a Czechoslovak resistance leader, escape from the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Germans.\n\nVia Magyar Nemzet; Featured image via Wikipedia"
