        "text": "CONTEXTUAL OVERVIEW\n\nCasablanca — the 1942 film everyone has heard about in great discourse, a romance (or two, at that), a drama, and a war film, all wrapped into one little hour and forty-two minute production. At the head of the narrative stands director, Michael Curtiz, one of Hollywood’s (Hungary’s) Golden Age directors, who enabled this film to win extraneous awards: Academy Award for Best Picture (rightfully so), Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, ranks as one of the greatest films in history, and is on the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry. The film is set in the midst of WWII in a refugee-filled Casablanca (a territory in Monocco), where American expat, Rick Blaine owns a “gin joint” also known as “Casablanca,” which acts as a beacon for refugees longing to reach the United States. However, an ex-lover of Rick’s happens upon Casablanca, sending Rick into an emotional downward spiral, causing him to have to decide between his own desires and the needs of others.\n\nTHE MEAT\n\nAs described in van Dijk’s “Politics, Ideology, and Discourse,” the Marx-Engles concept of ideology can refer to the partisan ideas of others and can be a form of “false consciousness” as it pertains to the rigid or misguided perspective of moral correctness of an event or happening. Although van Dijk describes this definition of ideology as having a “poor connotation,” it is largely what occurs when a viewer enters the cinematic universe of a particular director’s film. In any given film, the director creates a framework of forced ideology, in which a viewer is convinced of people or situations being inherently “good” or inherently “bad” to enable effective storytelling. Therefore, the viewer’s ideology tends to be directly influenced by the director’s intentions of how they want to make the viewer feel, because the viewer is unaware of the economy of the alternate reality that a movie takes place in. The Marx-Engles definition of ideology particularly pertains to the ideologies that each viewer has when watching a film.\n\nIn Casablanca, we empathize with Rick Blaine, who is painted to be robbed of Ilsa’s love, as she chooses Victor Laszlo, her husband, over Rick Blaine. Ilsa had an intermittent affair with Rick in Paris many years prior to their present-day rekindling in Casablanca. Perhaps the most infamous scene of the movie is of Rick sitting at the bar, drinking alone, internally stewing over Ilsa. Sam approaches him and offers support, in response, Rick begins rattling off about Ilsa.\n\nMichael Curtiz, the director of Casablanca, accomplishes the ideology of the audience to sympathize with Rick not only narratively, but through visual effects. The scene opens with Rick sitting alone at a bar in a largely-dark room, with minimal lighting cast on Rick’s face. The low-key lighting on Rick’s face is high-contrast and noirish in feel, resembling chiaroscuro. This use of lighting intentionally heightens the emotional tension and emphasizes the feeling of conflict via the juxtaposition of light and dark on Rick’s face, reflecting his inner turmoil. Additionally, the low-key lighting establishes an isolative and depressive environment, as it pertains to Rick. To further establish the ideology of the viewer’s responsibility to sympathize with Rick, Curtiz and set designers fashioned this scene in a cavernous-looking bar, the spherical shading cast on the walls makes the viewer feel almost as if we are looking into Rick’s brain. The only other person present is Sam, who is very rarely in the shot, but when he is, he is largely backlit. Curtiz uses backlighting to nearly erase the identity of Sam, making him more of a shadowed unidentifiable figure, who can be configured to mirror and convey the concerns that the viewer has for Rick, mayhaps intentionally breaking the third wall to make the viewer feel as though they are directly sympathizing with Rick. Curtiz impressively and successfully impels his sympathetic ideologies for Rick onto the viewer, which could have been much less strained and required less artistry if Curtiz wanted to paint Laszlo as the primary protagonist and the one who should have “gotten the girl,” as his character lent itself more to the role. Therefore, Casablanca’s Curtiz perfectly emulated the Marx-Engles concept of ideology as it pertains to the director’s effect on the perspective of the film-watcher.\n\nvan Dijk, T.A. “Politics, Ideology, and Discourse.” Encyclopedia of Language & Linguistics, 2006, pp. 728–740., doi:10.1016/b0-08-044854-2/00722-7."
