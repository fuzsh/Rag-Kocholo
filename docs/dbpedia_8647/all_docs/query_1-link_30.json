        "text": "Not many films are so notable that their birthdays get observed, but when the film is Casablanca, culture mavens are bound to make a fuss. As pointed out in this article in the Paris Review, Casablanca turns 75 soon, and its influence and renown are only growing.\n\nDirected by Hungarian Michael Curtiz, born Mihaly Kertész in 1888 (see the Hungarian connection?), Casablanca is rarely left off of ‘best all-time films’ lists. It is more relevant now than ever, made by an immigrant (Curtiz moved to Hollywood at age 38 to direct for Warner Brothers, and many of the actors are either immigrants or refugees in this film about expats/refugees during political tumult). According to Wikipedia: “Much of the emotional impact of the film has been attributed to the large proportion of European exiles and refugees who were extras or played minor roles (in addition to leading actors Paul Henried, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre.” Incidentally, character actor Peter Lorre also had Hungarian roots. Even though Curtiz directed many other Hollywood classics, including Yankee Doodle Dandy and Mildred Pierce, he will be best remembered for this anti-fascism-themed war film with a Hungarian flavor.\n\nAmerican film critic Roger Ebert once summed up his feelings for the commercially and artistically ambitious Casablanca as such: “When asked what is the greatest film of all time, I say Citizen Kane. When asked what is the movie you like the best, I say Casablanca.”\n\nFollowing are some of the more interesting, less known factoids about the film:\n\nIt was originally slated to be directed by Ben Hur director William Wyler.\n\nIt was a rare case of a film being shot in sequence, done so because to script wasn’t finished until halfway through shooting.\n\nIt was filmed entirely on a sound stage in Los Angeles.\n\nIngrid Bergman was 5 centimeters taller than Humphrey Bogart. He needed to stand on cement blocks or cushions for their more intimate scenes.\n\nThe film’s iconic line “Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,” was written by a producer and dubbed in a month after final shooting.\n\nThe New Yorker magazine was not impressed, calling the film “pretty tolerable”.\n\nCasablanca was nominated for eight Oscars and won three, including best director and best picture.\n\nThe film premiered at the Hollywood Theater in New York City on November 26, 1942, to coincide with the Allied invasion of North Africa and the capture of Casablanca.\n\nFrançois Truffaut refused an offer to remake the film in 1974. Later there was talk of Ben Affleck remaking it with Jennifer Lopez.\n\nThere is an unconfirmed rumor that Ronald Reagan was going to play Rick instead of Bogart.\n\nA hugely unpopular colorized version of the film was released on cable TV in the 80s.\n\nThe hero of the film is an anti-fascist with a Hungarian name – Viktor Laszlo.\n\nThe airplane in the final scene is actually constructed of cardboard.\n\nHappy 75 Casablanca! Here's looking at you, kid."
