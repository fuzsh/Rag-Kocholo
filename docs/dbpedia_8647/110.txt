"Casablanca director Michael Curtiz is finally getting the recognition he deserves." Film critic Kenneth Turan previews this series in the Los Angeles Times.

Academy Award-winning director Michael Curtiz (1886-1962), whose best-known films include Casablanca (1942), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) and Mildred Pierce (1945), was one of cinema’s most gifted and underrated directors. Curtiz directed over 180 films—94 of them during more than a quarter-century at Warner Bros. He was in many ways the anti-auteur, helming tearjerkers, swashbuckling adventures, westerns, musicals, war epics, historical dramas, horror films, melodramas and film noir. Curtiz’s protean body of work, wrought from a tumultuous and often-obscured personal life, is detailed in Alan K. Rode’s monumental biography Michael Curtiz: A Life in Film. The Archive is pleased to celebrate the career of Michael Curtiz with a retrospective of some of the director’s most renowned and seldom shown titles, including a pair of ultra-rare silent movies and a trio of films from his production company based at Warner Bros. Author Alan K. Rode is scheduled to introduce the screenings and will sign copies of his book before and between films.
