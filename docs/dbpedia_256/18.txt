Brent Townshend of Menlo Park, a founder of the Menlo Park-based Ordinate Corp., announced the company has introduced PhonePass, a testing method for assessing proficiency in spoken English. Developed by Mr. Townshend and co-founder Jared Bernstein, the service is a computer-administered test that takes place in a 10-minute phone call. The test, which costs about $50 to take, uses Ordinate's voice-recognition technology. It is designed to help industry and educators determine the level at which a person can speak and understand everyday English.
