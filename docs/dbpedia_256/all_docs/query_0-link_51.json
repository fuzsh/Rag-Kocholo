        "text": "It's 10 p.m., you know where your children are, and you're in the mood for a good movie. But nothing on the usual cable channels strikes your fancy, and you're too tired to go rent a video. No problem--if you live in Delaware County, near Philadelphia. That's where Suburban Cable offers special set-top boxes, called OnSet, that pretend to be VCRs.\n\nCall the OnSet menu to the TV screen, pick the movie you want to rent--$3.95 for new releases, less for oldies--and settle back. A computer at Suburban Cable's parent, Lenfest Communications Inc. in Oaks, Pa., immediately transmits your choice, which will remain accessible for 24 hours. You can watch it as often as you want, using the OnSet remote control to fast-forward past the boring parts or freeze interesting scenes."
