This document summarizes a presentation given by Hannah Sommers on supporting researchers at The George Washington University. It discusses establishing trust with researchers by understanding their needs through Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Patrick Lencioni's model of team dysfunction. It provides examples of library services that help researchers like workshops, a next generation library system, and supporting data management and reproducibility. The presentation highlights the roles of several library staff members in developing these services to better support the research workflow.",
