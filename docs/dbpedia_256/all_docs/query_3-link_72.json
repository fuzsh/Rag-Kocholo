Our conversations delved deep into not only the realm of engineering but also underscored the importance of wide-ranging learning to develop multifaceted innovators. While our discussions with NUS are still in the preliminary stages, we're keen on the prospect of exploring initiatives that impart the know-how derived from real-world engineering industry experiences to undergraduates. Our goal? To keep the flame of engineering passion burning brightly, attracting a steady influx of students to NUS's engineering discipline year after year, all set to innovate in our ever-evolving world.

In the below chart it is clear that Sunway University's number of articles and review articles in Web of Science in 2023 has significantly increased to 4% of total publications in Malaysia, 8.5% of total citations and 2.12 times the Malaysian average C/P. In fact, Sunway University is now number 1 in the world in C/P as well as in an amazing 4.15% of top 1% articles, ahead of powerhouse Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This indicates great potential for rising further in the rankings based on research quality but will also require higher reputation scores for research and our holistic teaching. All data derived on September 29, 2023, from Web of Science CLARIVATE. #sunwayuniversity #timeshigherranking #QSranking\n\nREALITY CHECK 2024 COMPARING THE ESTABLISHED TOP GLOBAL UNIVERSITIES WITH MALAYSIAN UNIVERSITIES. It turns out that in recent years Malaysia has caught up in number of papers and, more importantly, number of citations per paper, with the top global universities. This bodes well for Malaysia as an education hub in Asia. Malaysia offers good quality and is one of the most economical places to study in addition to a tropical climate, safety and great food. Three private universities from Malaysia are leading the pack. In terms of number of papers, Sunway University has gone from 27% in 2022 to 82% of the number of papers from Harvard University in 2024. All data derived from Scopus on March 8, 2024. #sunwayuniversity #economicsandbusiness #citationsperpaper\n\nThis Global Program on Innovation and Entrepreneurship has a major focus on Innovating Digital Economy for the emerging countries. More than 85% of the global population live in the developing world. But emerging countries often face a significant digital divide, where access to technology is limited. Innovating education and building new skills are a means to achieve digital inclusion and access to the digital economy and reduce inequalities and promote social and economic development. The digital economy has become a major driver of economic growth worldwide. Innovating education and skills development in emerging countries is essential for their successful participation in the global digital economy, attract foreign investment, and promote innovation. . During this program participants are required to work on a Group Project focused on specific issues related to the major sectors of the economy and develop/propose solutions.\n\n‚ú® VIDEO ON COMMUNIVERSITY: A UNIVERSITY MODEL OF SUSTAINABILITY ‚ú® We are thrilled to share our latest video production, on Communiversity, which delves into the crucial role of universities in addressing local and global sustainability challenges. The video can be watched here: https://lnkd.in/gygKez4a The concept and system itself are developed by the Communiversity Appraisal System Task Force which comprises several Malaysian universities, chaired by Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Dato' Dzulkifli Abdul Razak, with support from the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia. The video highlights the following: üîç Unveiling Challenges: In a time of unprecedented crises, we explore the current purpose of education and its role in tackling social, economic, and environmental issues. üìâ Rethinking Rankings: Traditional university rankings fall short in capturing the broader purpose of education, particularly in the realm of sustainability. The video highlights the perverse incentives of current metrics, presents thought-provoking insights from experts, and emphasises the need for a flexible approach to education. üîÑ Communiversity: Introducing the concept as the paradigm shift needed in education, the video presents five fundamental pillars of the university appraisal system, aiming to truly reflect the essence of universities and our impact on society: 1. Community Transformation and Leadership 2. Institutional Collaboration 3. Responsible Research and Innovation 4. Integration of Knowledge 5. Sustainable Entrepreneurship üí° Join us in reshaping the future! Watch the video, share your thoughts, and let us champion a new era of higher education that prioritises holistic development and approach. #Communiversity #UniversityRanking #Sustainability #HigherEducation #SystemicChange\n\nCalling all Educators, Researchers, and Scholars! Are you interested in the intersection of education and multidisciplinary research? Then you won't want to miss the 7th International Conference on Multi-Disciplinary Research Studies and Education (ICMDRSE-2024) happening in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on May 25th and 26th! This conference is a fantastic opportunity to: üí•Engage in cross-disciplinary conversations on critical issues, trends, and solutions. üí•Showcase your groundbreaking research and inspire new ideas in education and various fields. üí•Network with a vibrant community of scholars, educators, and researchers from around the world. The theme for ICMDRSE 2024 is \"Cross-disciplinary Conversations: Education & Multidisciplinary Studies.\" This focus on collaboration across disciplines promises a dynamic environment for exchanging knowledge and fostering educational excellence. Whether you're an engineering professor, a K-12 educator, or a researcher in any field, ICMDRSE-2024 has something to offer you. #ICMDRSE2024 #MultidisciplinaryResearch #Education #Collaboration #Malaysia #Conference\n\nAt the beginning of my journey, I was delighted at the opportunity to write a voluntary thesis at the Graduate School of International Studies (GSIS) Yonsei University Encouraged by vigorous and supportive faculty members at the school, the thesis experienced several iterations to the original idea. Yet, it is with pleasure to inform you that this final version of the thesis have been succesfully defended. Titled ‚ÄúThe Dynamics of Industrial Transformation: A Case Study of the Indonesian Automotive Industry‚Äù, this thesis tries to understand the causes behind the competitiveness problem of the Indonesian automotive industry. Using political economy analysis, this thesis produced three important findings: üîπThe partnership between Indonesian konglomerat and the Japanese keiretsu gave birth to an oligopoly market structure, lacking drive for innovation üîπWhile the Government of Indonesia (GoI) have a single interest in the development of the industry, each agent inside the GoI structure conflicted on how to reach that interest üîπThe advent of the Electric Vehicle (EV) industry shifted the GoI preference in designing the new industrial policies, putting the existing industry as a loser in favor of the new and exciting EV industry. From the findings above, the thesis also produced two important theoretical impacts: üî∫The keiretsu model, long attributed as the driver of Japan‚Äôs economic miracle, might not always work as intended, particularly in the developing country setting. üî∫While policies are made with specific outcomes in mind, the policies might also produced unintended consequences, be it favorable or adverse. I am now looking forward to return to the workfield, applying the knowledge that I have obtained from this process. Should any of you are interested to explore further opportunities or discuss with me on the thesis itself, hit me up in the messages!"
