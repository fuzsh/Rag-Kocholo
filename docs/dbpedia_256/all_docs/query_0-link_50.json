        "text": "We believe that clerkships provide valuable experience and a fantastic opportunity for training with our nation’s judiciary, and we reward that experience: We offer clerkship bonuses that are significantly larger than many of our peer firms to incoming associates who join our firm immediately after clerking at the state supreme court, federal district or appellate levels, in the amount of $80,000 for a single clerkship and $105,000 for two or more clerkships (net of any clerkship bonus received previously from the firm or from another employer). We also pay competitive bonuses for clerkships at the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as well as the United States Supreme Court. Our clerks find that they are better lawyers for having seen the legal system operate from the inside, and we are committed to attracting the best and most motivated judicial law clerks in the country. In that regard, nearly 75 percent of our lawyers and over 80 percent of our litigators have clerked for federal or state judges. Below we include a list of the current attorneys at our firm organized by their clerkship.​\n\nIf you are currently clerking and are interested in an attorney position at MTO, please apply. We recognize that different judges have different rules for when clerks may apply to firms. We generally begin to interview clerkship candidates in the fall and continue through the spring. For those whose judges do not allow clerks to apply until later in, or at the end of, their clerkship term, we continue to accept applications throughout the spring and summer. We are flexible and look forward to hearing from applicants from clerkships across the country.​\n\nPlease note that we do not pay recruitment or placement fees to search firms for any candidates applying directly from judicial clerkships.​\n\nFor additional inquiries, please contact:"
