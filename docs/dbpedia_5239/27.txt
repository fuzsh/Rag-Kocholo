Presented is an inventory of the Republic Pictures library, as published in a company document dated April 6, 1994. Non-Republic feature films from the company’s predecessor, National Telefilm Associates, are excluded but were part of the original document, which encompassed almost 1,500 permanent features; another 300 were under lease.

The first list herein is specific to American theatrical features produced and/or released by the company between 1935–1959. Foreign features and serials are listed separately.

With the creation of Republic in 1935, absorbing Monogram Pictures Corp., Mascot Pictures Corp., Liberty Pictures Corp., Majestic Pictures Corp., and Select Productions, Inc., some sources erroneously list titles being distributed by Republic, assuming all the companies became one and the same.

Monogram’s 33 national distribution exchanges remained relatively the same except for the new name of Republic. But due to existing deals with independent state rights exchanges, Mascot, Liberty, and Majestic were obligated to continue their identities for a short time to fulfill commitments to their franchise holders.

The last picture made under the Monogram banner, “Cheers of the Crowd,” began production on May 21, 1935. However, Mascot, brought into the Republic setup in early June 1935, had a five-picture commitment with its exchanges, after which it would permanently drop its name and distribute under the Republic banner.

Mascot would begin production of its last serial, “The Fighting Marines,” in late September 1935, and its last feature, at the Talisman Studio, “Doughnuts and Society,” in early February 1936. These were made even though the company had officially started its production schedule under the Republic name at the Mascot Studio in early July 1935.

Mascot’s plant was the former Mack Sennett Studio, acquired in a bankruptcy sale of the comedian’s estate. Formally taking possession in January 1935, under a five-year lease, Mascot had purchased all of its operating equipment and furnishings, the property described as completely dilapidated.

With four stages, the 1928-built studio would become the official home of Republic in October 1935, when the various production units were amalgamated under one roof. Republic would soon build two additional stages, and purchase the studio outright in 1939.

Monogram, working mostly out of the RKO Pathé lot at the time, did not have its own studio, nor did Liberty and Majestic.

Titles copyrighted by Mascot during this transitioning period, albeit few, are excluded like those of Monogram. Note that Gene Autry’s first film for Republic, “Tumbling Tumbleweeds,” completed in mid-July 1935, was planned as a Mascot title months earlier but Republic handled the copyright and distribution.

Liberty’s last-produced picture, “Born to Gamble,” completed in early June 1935, is excluded since it was copyrighted by the company, which handled distribution—like Mascot—through most of its own franchised exchanges.

The film carried the Liberty name on its print and advertising material, but was released by Republic in their newly opened New York exchange as were some Mascot titles. A few other Republic exchanges handled the film also.

“The Crime of Doctor Crespi” is included because Republic also copyrighted the film at the same time as Liberty—mistakenly according to Republic—and handled its release. The film was not made by Liberty in the first place, since it was produced independently in September 1934 at the Biograph Studio, New York.

After “Born to Gamble,” Liberty’s president, M.H. Hoffman, would briefly become a unit producer for Republic and Columbia. In 1939 Liberty’s small library of 12 features—including the aforementioned film—was acquired by Herbert J. Yates’ Consolidated Film Industries (CFI) and then by Republic, its corporate cousin.

Mascot’s library of 19 features and 20 sound serials was sold in 1945 to George Hirliman of International Theatrical and Television Corp., through negotiations with Nat Levine and CFI. Levine, who founded Mascot in 1927, had resigned the presidency of Republic in early 1937.

Mascot, Liberty and Majestic were all financed by CFI, which ended up owning a stake in their film libraries except Majestic, but no titles would be in the official Republic library itself. Monogram, too, was financed by Consolidated.

Although part of the rumor mill in 1935, Invincible Pictures Corp. and Chesterfield Pictures Corp. were not involved in Republic’s creation in any way—both companies were financed by Pathé. This myth still persists today.

In early 1934 Majestic, relying on independent pickups, formed its own production unit under the helm of Larry Darmour, Majestic Producing Corp. With the absorption into Republic, the company would continue to distribute, along with Republic, the few Darmour titles still in circulation. Majestic’s last film, “Reckless Roads,” was completed in May 1935.

With the success of the fledgling Monogram, Herbert J. Yates had his eyes on the company early on. This included a proposed plan in late 1933 to acquire the company and its main distribution system, First Division, run by Harry H. Thomas. Yates had planned to enter into a combination with Harold B. Franklin, the former head of Fox West Coast Theatres and RKO Theatres.

One other company, rarely mentioned, absorbed into Republic was Select Productions, Inc., headed by William Saal and Burt Kelly. In 1934 the company, a subsidiary of CFI, made five films in the East, at the Biograph Studio, New York.

Select’s president, William Saal, would later become the executive assistant to Herbert J. Yates, with him to the very end of Republic Pictures in 1959.

The newly reconstructed Biograph Studio, which opened for production in the Bronx on January 2, 1934, was owned by CFI, the precursor to Herbert J. Yates’ plan to enter motion picture production in a big way. The first film to be made at the modernized plant was “Frankie and Johnnie.”

While still temporarily active in the East, Select Productions then started Hollywood production in October 1934 with “Federal Agent” and then “Salvage” (released as “Burning Gold”), and in early 1935, “Go-Get-’Em, Haines” and “Racing Luck,” all starring Bill Boyd.

The films were belatedly released by Republic to cash in on Bill Boyd’s popularity as Hopalong Cassidy. All were presented under the Winchester Pictures banner, helmed by George Hirliman who also helped Herbert J. Yates oversee talent for the Biograph Studio.

Although “Forbidden Heaven” was sometimes reported as the first Republic production, “Westward Ho” was the first to be completed, on June 25, 1935, when additional scenes were filmed at the Talisman Studio after principal photography ended early in the month. The film was trade-screened on June 1.

“Forbidden Heaven” started on June 12, at the RKO Pathé Studio, and wrapped up on June 27. It was the first, however, to be planned solely as a Republic production since “Westward Ho” and “Lawless Range”—filmed back-to-back beginning on May 19 at Lone Pine, California—were in the production pipeline with Monogram.

“Westward Ho” was the first to be released generally, in late August, and “Forbidden Heaven” in late September. “Lawless Range” was tentatively planned for a July 30 release but hit the exchanges in late October. Two other Republic titles predated the release of “Forbidden Heaven”: “Two Sinners” and “Cappy Ricks Returns,” both released in September 1935.

As listed in Republic’s 1994 document, ‘T’ denotes a film available on broadcast tape, ‘F’ on 16mm film. Titles without a format designation (‘—’) were either not part of the Republic library at this time or simply not available for distribution.

The document’s origins predate 1994 since some Republic titles have expiration dates going back to 1984, when National Telefilm Associates (NTA) was renamed Republic, the dates reflecting when distribution rights expired.

Some expiration dates, though not Republic studio titles, go back to 1966, reflecting the document’s early origins.

Besides seven other cases outlined below, those that expired in 1984 were 23 titles in the Red Ryder series, which today is marketed on home video by VCI Entertainment under license from Red Ryder Enterprises, Inc. NTA’s rights expired by the end of the 1960s, and Leo A. Gutman, Inc., New York, was distributing the series to TV by at least 1980. Republic’s document listed the expiration as January 24, 1984, so the then-NTA must have reacquired the rights after Gutman.

The others with expiration dates are seven titles made independently for Republic: “The French Key,” “The Glass Alibi,” “The Pretender,” “Strange Impersonation,” “Winter Wonderland,” “Woman Who Came Back” and “Yankee Fakir,” all now owned by Films Around the World, Inc. (FAT-W).

The Republic releases “The Great Flamarion,” “Identity Unknown,” “That’s My Baby!” and “Trocadero” are now owned by FAT-W also. No expiration dates, however, were included for these indie titles because their copyrights were not renewed.

“Trocadero,” for reasons unknown, was not listed in Republic’s document but was in the NTA library in 1984, although apparently not in circulation. Even when the film came into the hands of Classics Associates, Inc., later called Films Around the World, it was not available on 16mm.

The eleven titles now with FAT-W were once owned by a former Motion Pictures for Television subsidiary, Western Television Corp., later a division of Television Industries, Inc. They were leased to NTA by the films’ new owner, Link Industries, Inc., two years before NTA purchased the Republic library in 1967.

All eleven were on TV in the early 1950s from MPTV, the largest distributor at the time. And all were produced off the Republic lot by either Walter Colmes or W. Lee Wilder under their associated company names.

Three other independent films came back to the Republic library through TV distributors: “Captain Tugboat Annie” and “Adventures of Captain Fabian” were acquired in 1952 and 1958, respectively, by M&A Alexander Productions, Inc., whose library formed a substantial part of NTA in the mid-1960s.

The third, “Macbeth,” was acquired by the Bank of America in a foreclosure suit, and released to TV by the Film Division of General Teleradio in 1955. NTA acquired the domestic TV rights in 1958, along with 29 other titles in the foreclosure—ultimately owning the films outright.

Although tracking down TV distributors may seem unimportant, such companies often owned all negative rights, especially minor titles like these, the films no longer valued for theatrical exhibition. This at a time when home video—discounting narrow-gauge—did not exist. The distributor of one orphaned independent Republic title from the 1940s, however, has eluded me: “The Big Show-Off” was playing on TV in 1952, only to disappear by the early 1960s.

Not included in Republic’s document are 56 Gene Autry titles, the majority with copyright renewals by Republic and NTA, the remainder in the public domain. These are now owned by the Autry estate. When exactly NTA lost the rights is unknown, but the films were being distributed to TV in 1982 by Autry’s own Golden West Television, Inc.

The Roy Rogers titles in the Republic library are still owned by its successor, Paramount, but his estate also has rights. Of the cowboy’s 81 starring roles for the studio, most are in the public domain. However, in an odd case of dual ownership, even those under copyright today have been released on home video without the involvement of Paramount, advertised as “authorized by the Roy Rogers Estate.”

Films with no elements in 1994 are prefaced by an ‘X’, all but one followed by a two-letter designation. Although the others are explained below, X-RP denotes an in-house Republic production still known to be in the library in absentia, so to speak, except those with expired underlying rights, which are noted. Film elements may be incomplete or non-existent for most of them.

Comprehensive rights are far beyond the scope of what is presented here, the list more to provide a snapshot of what was available in 1994 and decades earlier.

Republic’s library remained relatively intact into the early 1980s, unlike its counterpart Monogram/Allied Artists which sold outright many of its features years before.

With its entry into the early field of television distribution in 1951, through its Hollywood Television Service, Inc. subsidiary, Republic retitled a number of films for the medium. These variants are reflected in the company document and included herein with their original titles.

A few of the new titles reflect theatrical reissues or those retitled shortly after release, but many were specifically for television, which are noted. Other non-Republic variants include three Gene Autry features that MCA-TV retitled when the company had his Republic films in the 1950s.

Reissues are noted only when the original titles have been changed for domestic release, and have been verified as true theatrical reissues, disregarding other forms of title variants. It appears that Republic generally retitled only those reissues with bigger budgets, leaving their often re-released B pictures—especially westerns—with their original titles. UK titles are also included.

By May 1957 Hollywood Television Service advertised 447 pre-1948 features available to TV, excluding the 67 titles with Roy Rogers and 56 with Gene Autry that MCA-TV—a Republic shareholder—had acquired for worldwide distribution in 1955.

Pre-1948 meant productions started before August 1, 1948, and vice versa, as per an agreement with Hollywood’s talent guilds. Republic ignored the agreement for post-1948 titles, in 1958, since corporately it had ceased motion picture production.

In early 1958, under much controversy, Republic released the first batch of its post-’48 library to TV: 203 features and 15 serials, most of it known as the Constellation Group. In April 1959, Douglas T. Yates, company vice-president, stated 461 pre-’48 titles were in distribution besides the 203 post-’48 pictures.

Douglas T. Yates’ total excluded MCA-TV’s 123 titles with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry, and the 23 Red Ryders, which were all pre-’48. The Republic backlog released to TV totaled 94% with their inclusion.

Republic’s president, Herbert J. Yates, stated in early 1959 that only “about 50” post-’48 films remained in the company’s vaults. In late 1960 those would be released to TV in HTS’s Saturn Group package comprised of 30 titles.

The company’s last two post-’48 serials were released by HTS in 1963, leaving 20 of 66 cliffhangers unreleased by the company—about half of those with expired rights. The number of Republic serials in TV circulation would change very little over the years.

In the latter part of 1960, Hollywood Television Service’s library—with over 1200 titles including TV episodes, serial episodes and shorts—had 246 post-’48 and 615 pre-’48 feature films. This included the 23 Red Ryder titles and the 123 with Roy Rogers and Gene Autry.

The Red Ryder series was part of the very first package of films released by HTS, in 1951, with KTTV, Los Angeles, the first station in the country to sign a deal, acquiring 127 features and 48 half-hour serial episodes. The rights to the Red Ryders eventually expired but were acquired again by HTS from Stephen Slesinger, Inc. in early 1960.

The 123 Roy Rogers and Gene Autry titles also returned to HTS the same year in a new agreement with MCA-TV, which had acquired worldwide TV rights to the films in March 1955. A long legal battle between Republic and the cowboy stars kept the films from being broadcast until the MCA-TV deal.

With 246 post-’48ers and 615 pre-’48ers, HTS had a total of 861 feature films by the end of 1960.

There are 804 of 951 theatrical feature films, both American and foreign, listed herein with TV elements—tape and/or film, including the 23 Red Ryders, which should not have been shown as such since their rights expired in 1984. This totals 860 features if the 56 Autrys with no elements are included. (The use of the word elements is specific to TV, which means 16mm or broadcast tape—not 35mm.)

The closely matching total is deceiving, however, because 13 of the titles with elements in 1994 were with three other TV distributors in 1960: Western Television, M&A Alexander Productions, and NTA (its pre-Republic years).

This means 14 more features were being distributed in 1960 compared to 1994 if one includes the Red Ryder and Gene Autry titles for comparison.

Not listed with elements in 1994 but first released by HTS between 1958–1960 were nine independent American titles: “Yellowneck,” “Hidden Guns,” “Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer,” “Journey to Freedom,” “Hell Canyon Outlaws,” “Raiders of Old California,” “Hell Ship Mutiny,” “Outcasts of the City,” and “Street of Darkness.”

Also not listed with elements in 1994 but first released by HTS in 1958 were four foreign titles: “Thunder Over Tangier,” “The Fighting Wildcats,” “Scotland Yard Dragnet,” and “International Counterfeiters.”

This accounts for 13 extra features being distributed in 1960. The 14th feature, “The Avengers,” was not listed in 1994, but was available at least into the 1970s.

HTS wasted no time with Republic’s latter post-’48 backlog, releasing many of them to TV two years after their theatrical release dates.

Another title without elements in 1994 but handled by HTS was “Bill and Coo,” first broadcast in 1955 as a “Specialty Attraction,” but the rights had lapsed by 1960. Republic’s UK distributor at the time, Eros Films, did manage a reissue in 1959.

Not listed above is “Behind City Lights,” without elements in 1994 but released by HTS in 1952, only to be pulled from circulation a couple of years later.

Two others without elements in 1994 were “Affairs of Jimmy Valentine” and “The Return of Jimmy Valentine,” both briefly released under their original titles by HTS in the early 1950s, and subsequently retitled “Unforgotten Crime” and “Prison Shadows,” respectively. They were not available from HTS in 1960, apparently pulled from circulation around the same time as “Behind City Lights.”

Hollywood Television Service announced in 1960 that it was planning to release its 850-film library to foreign television stations, the number a generalization. The company had exactly 861 titles for domestic release, including 433 available with Spanish subtitles and a lesser number with French, German, Italian, and Portuguese subtitles.

Note that what HTS had were only those features in circulation—the total would be different if John Wayne’s lost six-reeler, “The Oregon Trail,” had previously been discovered in a Kansas salt mine.

Also available from HTS at this time were 501 serial chapters—most if not all edited to 13 minutes—in three packages: Science Fiction Cliff Hangers, Jungle Adventure Cliff Hangers, and Republic’s Famous Cliff Hangers. In addition there were four TV series: “Stories of the Century,” “Frontier Doctor,” “Stryker of Scotland Yard,” and “Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe.”

A few in-house Republic productions have never been released to TV or any other media since their theatrical runs: “The Harvester” and “Michael O’Halloran,” both based on novels by Gene Stratton-Porter. Also “Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case,” now owned by Kit Parker who, after securing the underlying rights, has found no useable film elements. He also owns “Mr. District Attorney,” which has never been released to TV but is available on home video.

Although the four films above were made in-house and released to TV at one time, as mentioned none were in Republic’s 1994 document, probably because of poor elements or underlying rights issues.

Of the independent titles from Republic, only two have disappeared from circulation since their theatrical runs: “A Gentle Gangster” has not seen the light of day since, although the British Film Institute has elements; and “Deerslayer,” not to be confused with the 1957 version which was purchased by NTA from 20th Century-Fox in 1960.

The Republic library and other films acquired by NTA are housed at the UCLA Film & Television Archive, where their online catalog can be searched to see what elements exist in their holdings.

Although excluded from Republic’s original document, the initial copyright claimant as registered with the US Copyright Office is listed for each film along with its renewal number. Copyrights renewed other than by Republic’s corporate entities—Republic Corp., National Telefilm Associates, Inc., Repix, Inc.—are italicized.

Of the few films never registered, most have Republic copyright statements on the prints. The law at this time allowed a film to be registered within 28 years of its release, and Republic belatedly registered some of its last films within the deadline, also registering for renewal in the same 28-year window.

In almost all cases, however, films were registered upon their initial release.

In rare cases Republic was the registered copyright claimant but a different one appeared on the print. And some independent films, where Republic’s rights lapsed, had new credits for TV distribution, inserting entirely different copyright claimants. These are not noted.

No guarantee is implied for documenting every copyright renewal, though confidence prevails that all have been accounted. This is not a legal document—some renewals could be missing.

Even without renewal a film may have underlying rights protected by copyright. “Hell Ship Mutiny,” for example, has some of its music under copyright even though the film itself was never registered.

Theatrically released features culled from serials are included, and any renewals listed are specific only to the condensed versions. These are noted as ‘from serial’ but do not always reflect the chapter play’s original name.

No serials were listed in the Republic document, but included were the 26 retitled and condensed 100-minute features the company released to television in March 1966. These are included in a separate list following the serials.

Colorized films in Republic’s document are excluded.

The year for each film was not included either. These have been based on a film’s premiere or release date (i.e. its first showing to the general public), but note that it was not uncommon for Republic to hold back some films for six months or more before distribution.

All films are black and white unless noted. Those in Naturama, Republic’s 2.35:1 widescreen format, or any other anamorphic format are also noted. Republic’s first three-color Trucolor film was “Honeychile,” and it is assumed that all subsequent titles in the format were the same.

A brief chronology of the Republic library:

In the UK in 1954, Republic released theatrically two episodes of its TV series “Stories of the Century” as a 59-minute feature titled “Stories of the Century No. 1.” The episodes used were “Quantrill and His Raiders” and “Belle Starr,” both co-starring Mary Castle.

Although not released by Republic, special mention must be given to “Too Late for Tears” (1949), made at the Republic Studio for independent producer Hunt Stromberg’s Streamline Pictures for release by United Artists. All post-production work (music, editing, special effects) was done at the studio—all in-house except for the financing. The film, now in the public domain, was reissued by Astor Pictures in 1955 as “Killer Bait.”

Another completely in-house production made at the Republic Studio was “Montana Belle” for producer Howard Welsch’s Fidelity Pictures. Initially intended as a Republic release, after its completion in late 1948, RKO purchased the film from Fidelity in early 1949, marking the second time Republic’s color process, Trucolor, would be released by another company. Announced to hit the exchanges a number of times in the proceeding years, “Montana Belle,” however, sat on the shelf until its general release in November 1952.

Another independent feature in Trucolor predated the release of “Montana Belle.” Norman Dawn’s obscure “The Daring Miss Jones” was released in 1951 by Exploitation Film Distributors, Inc., the bulk of the film lensed in 1947.

The following is a list of production companies for films prefaced by ‘X’ in American Features, excluding the Red Ryder series, Gene Autry titles and those culled from serials. Republic’s producing arm was Republic Productions, Inc.—the distributing arm was Republic Pictures Corp.— so this has been used to denote in-house product:

Affairs of Jimmy Valentine (Republic Productions; also released to TV as “Unforgotten Crime”), African Manhunt (Trinity Productions), The Avengers (Republic Productions), Beginning of the End (AB-PT Pictures), Behind City Lights (Republic Productions), The Big Show-Off (Williams-Spence Productions), Bill and Coo (Ken Murray Productions), Burning Gold (Select Productions/Winchester Pictures), Cancion de Mexico (Republic Productions; Spanish version of “Song of Mexico”), Crazylegs (Hall Bartlett Productions), The Crime of Doctor Crespi (Select Productions/JHA [John H. Auer] Pictures; principal photography was completed September 27, 1934, at the Biograph Studio, New York), Daniel Boone, Trail Blazer (Gannaway-Ver Halen Productions), Deerslayer (Cardinal Pictures), Eighteen and Anxious (AB-PT Pictures), The Fabulous Suzanne (Star Pictures [Steve Sekely Productions]), Federal Agent (Select Productions/Winchester Pictures), Frankie and Johnnie (Select Productions/All Star Productions; principal photography was completed March 9, 1934, at the Biograph Studio, New York, with retakes a year later), The French Key (Walter Colmes Productions), Fugitive Lady (Scalera Film/Venus Film [Mike J. Frankovich]; made in Italy in both English and Italian versions), A Gentle Gangster (A.W. Hackel Productions), Girl in the Woods (AB-PT Pictures), The Glass Alibi (W. Lee Wilder Productions), Go-Get-’Em, Haines (Select Productions/Winchester Pictures), The Great Flamarion (Filmdom Productions [W. Lee Wilder Productions]), The Harvester (Republic Productions), Hell Canyon Outlaws (Jerold Zukor Productions), Hell Ship Mutiny (Lovina Productions; culled from at least three episodes of the ill-fated TV series “Knight of the South Seas”), Hidden Guns (Gannaway-Ver Halen Productions), House by the River (Fidelity Pictures), Identity Unknown (Walter Colmes Productions), Invisible Avenger (Demby Productions; culled from two television pilots), Jealousy (Gong Productions), Journey to Freedom (Apostolof Productions), Los vengadores (Republic Productions; Spanish version of “The Avengers”), Michael O’Halloran (Republic Productions), Moscow Strikes Back (Central Studios [USSR]/Artkino Pictures; Artkino had this American version of a Russian documentary in release for a month before Republic struck a deal for distribution rights), Mr. District Attorney (Republic Productions), Mr. District Attorney in the Carter Case (Republic Productions), The Oregon Trail (Republic Productions), Outcasts of the City (Lorraine Productions), The Pretender (W.W. [W. Lee Wilder] Productions), Racing Luck (Select Productions/Winchester Pictures), Raiders of Old California (Albert C. Gannaway Productions [Gavel, Inc.]), The Return of Jimmy Valentine (Republic Productions; also released to TV as “Prison Shadows”), Roogie’s Bump (John Bash Productions), A Song for Miss Julie (Pre-Em Pictures), Strange Impersonation (William [W. Lee] Wilder Productions), Street of Darkness (Robert Keys Productions; seldom seen indie made as “Seed of Darkness” and “Hop Alley” in New Orleans), That’s My Baby! (Walter Colmes Productions), This Is Korea! (United States Navy/Republic Productions), Trocadero (Walter Colmes Productions), The Unearthly (Brooke L. Peters [Boris Petroff]), Winter Wonderland (Walter Colmes Productions), Woman Who Came Back (Walter Colmes Productions), Yankee Fakir (W. Lee Wilder Productions), Yellowneck (Empire Studios).

Note that other independent companies, many with financial guarantees from Republic, made films for the studio.

Republic’s second venture into foreign production after “Cancion de Mexico” (“Song of Mexico,” 1945) was “The Avengers” in 1949, filmed mainly in Argentina and also at the company’s Hollywood studio. The film, also made in a Spanish version titled “Los vengadores”—with Fernando Lamas instead of John Carroll in the male lead among other differences—would not have been lensed in Argentina if not for Republic’s frozen funds in the country.

“Atlantic City” (1944, R520385) was re-edited and theatrically reissued by Republic in 1950 as “Atlantic City Honeymoon.” The reissue was copyrighted and registered that year under the new title and renewed in 1977 as R682673. This is the only case of a Republic reissue being copyrighted and renewed.

“Michael O’Halloran” (1937) was also copyrighted by Republic as “Any Man’s Wife” shortly after its initial registration, reflecting its new release title. The 1948 version, made by Windsor Pictures Corp. for release by Monogram, later ended up in the Republic library—via the TV library of M&A Alexander Productions—and was renewed by National Telefilm Associates as R616958.

The copyright renewal for “Hell Canyon Outlaws” by Tartan Enterprises is bogus, along with the other 19 films renewed by the company. The renewal number is excluded.

“Beginning of the End” (1957), “Eighteen and Anxious” (1957), “Girl in the Woods” (1958), and “The Unearthly” (1957) had their copyrights renewed by Peter S. Rodgers, a former NTA executive who was with the company since 1955. The films are now in the library of the Peter Rodgers Organization. All were initially released to TV by M&A Alexander Productions, Inc. which by 1966, with Rodgers as its president, was a division of NTA. The Peter Rodgers Organization also distributes the Republic title “Yellowneck” (1955).

Formed in 1933 by M.H. Hoffman, his son and Budd Rogers, Liberty Pictures Corp. was absorbed into Republic in 1935. Based on this news item, the company owned Liberty’s film library:

Weekly Variety, February 10, 1954:

Republic Sues DuMont

Infringement action involving six pix on tv was filed in N.Y. Federal Court last week by Republic against DuMont and Sutton Television. The company also sued Ideal Television Co. in connection with 12 films. Republic asked an injunction to keep DuMont from infringing on its rights to the films, as well as for damages, an accounting and return of the negatives.

The pix, according to Republic, were made by Liberty Films in 1933. In 1939 they became the property of Consolidated Film Industries and in 1945, with the merger of Consolidated and Republic, they became the latter’s property. Company claims the defendants were notified of the Republic claim but the showing of the pictures continued.

Among the titles involved are “Once [to] Every Bachelor,” “Sweepstake Annie,” “Dizzy Dames” and “Born to Gamble.”

The total number of films in the litigation was 12, not 18 in the ambiguity of Weekly Variety—another report in Motion Picture Daily stated the total was 12 pictures. Sutton had six of them, while Ideal had all 12, a case of two different distributors handling the same product.

Besides the four titles mentioned, the other eight would have been “Cheaters,” “No Ransom,” “The Old Homestead,” “School for Girls,” “Take the Stand,” “Two Heads on a Pillow,” “When Strangers Meet,” and “Without Children.”

All 12 were copyrighted by Liberty Pictures Corp. and made between 1933–1935, the majority at the RKO PathÃ© Studio, Culver City.

Why Republic did not monetize these films on TV is unknown, as was the litigation’s outcome. The titles were never officially released to TV even after 1954.

It was certainly not unusual for a laboratory to own films, typically due to indebtedness, but it was unusual not to exploit them in some way. Many were based on stories by prominent authors, so there may have been rights issues.

With the initial formation of Republic, the company had to keep its exchanges going with product while in-house productions were underway. A good source for the Monogram, Mascot, Liberty and Majestic titles Republic distributed is The Philadelphia Exhibitor, published beginning on November 1, 1935. Presented below are those listings, edited to include only the titles and exchange information.

The exchanges listed are incomplete, however, since the publication catered to the Philadelphia area, “elsewhere” as referenced in the listings meaning the general vicinity. Republic had 33 US exchange territories and most did not handle Mascot, Liberty and Majestic which were otherwise distributed by state rights outfits, not by the studio on a national level.

Despite the limited number of Republic exchanges distributing Mascot, Liberty and Majestic, the five exchange territories of Albany, Buffalo, New York, Philadelphia and Washington covered 33 percent of the country’s theaters.

Republic finalized its distribution setup by the middle of May 1935, the core of it based on Monogram’s system. As documented in The Philadelphia Exhibitor, the Republic exchange there did not handle Monogram, otherwise Republic took care of its predecessor’s distribution nationwide.

From the beginning, disregarding company-owned exchanges, Republic franchises were given only to those who handled their product exclusively, a practice that continued almost until the company’s demise in 1959. Mascot, Liberty and Majestic were notable exceptions—there were others—until the dust settled.

Unlike Republic’s policy, Monogram allowed their franchises to handle outside product. When Mascot finalized its national distribution setup for the 1934–35 program in July 1934, 15 Monogram exchanges were contracted, all of which became Republic in 1935. All would continue to handle Mascot’s product under existing agreements.

Some of these Monogram exchanges that became Republic also handled B outfits like Supreme, Puritan and Conn, to name a few. There is no way to document what exchanges released what titles, nor is it important. My curiosity lies with the product of those companies absorbed into Republic and the details regarding distribution.

The key is that initially a number of Republic exchanges operated as state rights distributors, releasing the films of Mascot, Liberty and Majestic not because of corporate takeovers but because of agreements signed before Republic was even created.

Exchange territories can be misleading since some may assume it only means the limits of the cities referenced. Those listed below for Mascot, Liberty and Majestic are defined to illustrate the scope of some of the 31 major national distribution territories; state rights for independents generally had at least 19 major territories, the boundaries defined differently:

Albany: upper New York, western Vermont and western Massachusetts. Atlanta: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, parts of Mississippi and South Carolina and Tennessee east of the Tennessee River. Boston: Maine, Massachusetts, except extreme western part, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and all but extreme section of Vermont. Buffalo: western New York State. Charlotte: North Carolina and most of South Carolina. Cincinnati: southern Ohio and parts of Kentucky and West Virginia. Cleveland: northern half of Ohio. Dallas: Texas. Detroit: lower peninsula of Michigan. Kansas City: Kansas and western Missouri. Los Angeles: part of Arizona, Southern California and parts of Mexico, New Mexico and Nevada. New Orleans: Louisiana and part of Mississippi. New York: Long Island, greater New York City, New York State as far as Poughkeepsie and northern New Jersey. Oklahoma City: Oklahoma. Omaha: western Iowa and most of Nebraska. Philadelphia: most of Delaware, southern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. Pittsburgh: western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Portland: part of Idaho and most of Oregon. San Francisco: northern California, Nevada and southern Oregon. Seattle: Washington and western Montana. Washington: District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, small section of Delaware.

The original release dates for all but three of the titles listed below are from Harrison’s Reports, the others and three serials from Motion Picture Herald.

Monogram Pictures Corp.:

(Distributed in Albany, Buffalo, New York City, Washington by Republic; in Philadelphia by First Division [First Division Exchanges, Inc.]).

Except for Philadelphia, Monogram was handled by the 32 other Republic exchanges.

Harry H. Thomas, head of First Division, reported in March 1935 that he had “disposed of the Monogram franchise in the New York territory and our commitments in Philadelphia will not be renewed,” a sign of the backroom discussions going on before the formation of Republic.

First Divisionâs contract terminated at the end of the 1934-35 releasing season.

Mascot Pictures Corp.:

(Distributed in Washington by Gold Medal [Gold Medal Film Company, Inc.], elsewhere by Republic).

Only feature films were included in The Philadelphia Exhibitor for these specific listings, but Mascot’s last three serials had the same distribution.

Fifteen Monogram exchanges were contracted by July 1934 for Mascotâs product, all becoming Republic in 1935: Albany, Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Little Rock, New Orleans, New York, Oklahoma City, Omaha and Tampa. All continued to distribute Mascot under existing agreements.

Mascot had formed their own exchanges in Seattle and Portland in 1932, purchasing those of its former franchise holder, Slater-Hurst Company. Both Mascot exchanges acquired the Majestic Pictures franchises and were known under that name—and Mascot Film Exchanges—as Majestic was finalizing its national distribution setup.

The Sheffield Exchange System, previously with Monogram, acquired the Republic franchises for the Northwest and Sheffield assumed Mascotâs rights for Seattle and Portland.

Gold Medal Film Co., Philadelphia, which handled Republic with its formal opening on July 15, 1935, was one of Mascotâs 1934 franchises. Herman Gluckman, the franchise owner of Republic for Philadelphia (previously owned by First Division), used Gold Medal’s facilities to create a combined Gold Medal-Republic exchange. Like New York, Gluckmanâs Philadelphia exchange was originally called Capital Film Exchange, Inc.

So along with Philadelphia, Seattle and Portland, 18 Republic exchanges handled Mascot. Gold Medal also had an exchange in Washington, which handled Mascot as per the 1934 agreement.

Herman Gluckman owned Mascotâs franchise for New York, acquired in 1929 for his Capital Film Exchange, Inc., which became the Republic franchise with its formal opening on July 11, 1935. A number of the state rights distributors in the 1934 Mascot deal were also part of the ones signed between 1929–1932.

In 1933, Gluckman changed the name of his Capital Film Exchange, New York, to Majestic Pictures Corp. and ultimately Majestic Film Distributing Corp., reflecting his presidency of Majestic Pictures. When the company was absorbed into Republic, it became known as Republic Film Exchange, Inc.

Illustrating how some Republic exchanges had existing contracts, Majestic acquired the New York state rights franchise for a serial, “The New Adventures of Tarzan,” from Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises, Inc. Majestic had become Republic by the time of its New York release, and fulfilled its contract by distributing the serial and its feature version under the Republic name.

Burroughs-Tarzan Enterprises had contracted 22 state rights distributors to cover the country for the serial, which also included the soon-to-be Republic exchanges in Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, St. Louis, San Francisco and Washington.

Gluckman sold his New York and Philadelphia exchanges to Republic in 1940.

Republic retained partial ownership, through its Consolidated Film Industries, of these titles (among other Mascots) until 1945.

Liberty Pictures Corp.:

(Distributed by Liberty [Hollywood Film Exchanges, Inc.] in Philadelphia, Washington by Hollywood [Hollywood Film Exchanges, Inc.], elsewhere by Republic).

Liberty Pictures completed its national distribution setup in early 1935, handling Los Angeles and San Francisco territories with their own Allied Exchanges (Allied Pictures Corp.). Both were awarded to Allied as Republic franchises in 1935, those of Monogram previously held by Co-Operative Film Exchange which promptly acquired the exchanges.

Motion Picture Daily, June 27, 1935, reported three Republic exchanges in Pittsburgh, New England and Ohio and Kentucky would handle the films “Dizzy Dames,” “Born to Gamble,” “The Old Homestead,” “Without Children,” and “Sweepstake Annie.” This was in addition to Republic exchanges serving upper and metropolitan New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania—the area covered in The Philadelphia Exhibitor—handling Liberty product.

The only other notable Liberty franchise was Monogram’s Detroit exchange which became part of Republic.

Jack Bellman’s Hollywood Film Exchanges acquired the franchise to Liberty Pictures in January 1934 for New York, Philadelphia, Buffalo and Washington. With the formation of Republic, Bellman merged his New York exchange in a combination with Herman Gluckman, owner, and became the executive manager of Republic Pictures Corp. of Greater New York and New Jersey.

So besides owning Liberty’s films, Republic also distributed a number of them in eight of their exchanges: Albany, Boston, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh and San Francisco.

The origins of Republic’s exchange system is shown below, all but four of the 33 branches seamlessly transitioning from Monogram.

Listed for each exchange territory is the original name of the distribution company during Monogram’s tenure. A few adopted the Monogram name, but the original company names are included instead.

Unlike Monogram, Republic had a policy where each branch had to be named after the studio and to handle its product exclusively, with the exception of short subjects. This policy took some time, as some exchanges had existing distribution agreements with other companies. Those exchanges wanting to release outside product had to get home office approval.

Monogram’s exchanges in New York and Philadelphia were owned by First Division. With the formation of Republic, Gold Medal Film Co., Philadelphia, became its distributor but First Division continued to handle Monogram there.

The founder and president of First Division—on its last legs in 1935—was Harry H. Thomas, who just happened to be a former Monogram executive.

What happened in Philadelphia, with two different exchanges in the same territory handling Monogram and Republic, did not happen elsewhere.

When Monogram was reborn in 1936, with its distribution system completed by May 1937, the company announced a policy of exchanges named after the studio to handle its product exclusively. Unlike Republic, however, in a short time the new Monogram quickly made exceptions to the latter.

With the opening of Monogram’s Minneapolis franchise in July 1931, the company announced the completion of its 33 national exchanges, the number including two in Canada, in Toronto and Montreal, run by Excellent Film Exchange.

The national setup also included an exchange in Birmingham, Alabama, owned by Arthur C. Bromberg Attractions who sold it in January 1932. And one in Butte, Montana, run by the Sheffield Exchange System, soon closed as an official Monogram branch until reopening in November 1934.

Established later were Monogram exchanges in Little Rock, Arkansas, October 1931; New Haven, Connecticut, by early 1933, and its last exchange, in Des Moines, Iowa, May 1935.

In August 1932, Regal Films, Ltd. acquired the Canadian franchise previously held by Excellent Film Exchange, extending Monogram’s branches in the Dominion from two to six. Empire Films, Ltd. acquired those rights in late 1933, which were carried over to Republic.

At the time of Republic’s formation, Monogram had 39 exchanges including those in Canada.

Memphis is included but it never had a Monogram exchange, with Arthur C. Bromberg Attractions opening a Republic franchise there in January 1936, its 34th branch in the US. The Little Rock exchange was closed in mid-1940, its territory then handled out of Memphis.

The core of Monogram’s exchange system actually goes back to the company’s precursor, Syndicate Pictures Corp., incorporated in July 1928 by Harry H. Thomas, a pioneering independent New York exchangeman. The company, however, was active by May 1928, when production began on its first film, âThe Silent Trail,â part of a series of westerns starring Bob Custer, supervised by Trem Carr.

Soon helmed by the future president of Monogram, W. Ray Johnston, Syndicate created a state rights system, finalized in 1930, of 28 branches—21 of which would become Republic.

In mid-1930, Syndicate Pictures formed their New York exchange under the auspices of Bell Pictures, Inc., franchise holder for a year by then, the company renamed Syndicate Exchanges, Inc. Previous to Bell, Syndicate was distributed in New York by Harry H. Thomas’ First Division Pictures, Inc., the company—initially called Merit Film Corp.—handling W. Ray Johnston’s Rayart Pictures Corp. since its inception in 1924.

With the advent of sound, Trem Carr leased a small studio on Sunset Boulevard in May 1929, the former Stern Bros. plant, known briefly as Goldstone Studio and then National Film Recording Studioâthe future home of Syndicate and Monogram.

Earlier, in March 1929, indie producer Phil Goldstone acquired a long term lease, with an option to buy, on the studio, renaming it National Film Recording Studio. Goldstone, who owned the Metropolitan Studio at Fort Lee, N.J., converted National’s larger stage, 63’ by 135’, for sound using the Biophone disc recording system.

Looking southeast from Sunset Boulevard and Gower Street towards the former Syndicate-Monogram Studio in 1939, located at the corner of Sunset and North Beachwood Drive. This was the former Stern Bros. plant, newly built for $35,000 and opened on May 31, 1919, as the Francis Ford Studio.

The original Stern plant, nearby on the other side of Gower, was destroyed by fire on August 15, 1926, when it was known as Century Studio. The Stern brothers, Julius and Abe, making shorts for Universal, then acquired the former Francis Ford Studio, the director vacating it by June 1924.

In late September 1926, while still building their new studio, the Sterns resumed limited production.

The original Stern plant was Universal’s first Hollywood studio, established in an old brewery at the corner of Sunset and Gower in October 1914, before moving to Universal City in 1915. The location of Stern’s new studio was described in 1926 as âin No. 6040 to 6048 Sunset Blvd.â

Operating under different names mostly as a rental plant, notably by Reliable Pictures Corp. which acquired a lease in 1935, bannering the studio with its name. The company, headed by Bernard B. Ray and Harry S. Webb, the latter previously producing for Syndicate, made about 40 pictures from 1934 to late 1936. Reliable even owned a ranch at Newhall for location work.

Barely visible in the photo, one can still see RELIABLE STUDIOS on the rear plant facing North Beachwood Drive, although by April 1937, with a fresh coat of paint, was officially called Sunset Studio.

At the start of 1935, Reliable Pictures was based out of the California Studio just down the street on Beachwood, the plant leased in 1935—and eventually sold—to Columbia Pictures whose lot is just out of view to the right.

The new Century Studio, when opened in 1926, was described as having âthree large stages, a large water tank and is equipped with every modern appurtenance for the making of pictures.â The rear plant was not part of the original Francis Ford Studio.

When Monogram moved to the nearby Metropolitan lot in May 1933, their former plant became known as Alexander Bros. Studio, owned since 1929 by Max and Arthur Alexander who were previously with the Stern Film Corp. The two would use their M&A Alexander Productions as a distributor of films for television, their large library eventually owned by Republic Pictures.

With Monogram now gone, taking their Western Electric equipment with them, the Alexanders installed Blue Seal’s Cineglow sound recording system, avoiding the expensive royalties charged by WE and RCA. Max Alexander produced his first film at the studio, âI Can’t Escape,â in April 1934, shot in six days.

In August 1936, Maurice Conn took full control of the Reliable Studio for his own use, which he completely remodeled and equipped, though still owned by Stern Brothers Realty Corp. Also overseeing rentals, Conn helmed Ambassador Pictures, Conn Pictures and Melody Pictures, the studio now bearing his name.

Other companies such as Screencraft, Victory, Puritan, Metropolitan and Million Dollar, for example, rented the plant which, along with the International and Talisman studios, was one of the most popular used by indie producers at the time. Producers Releasing Corp. made its first film, âI Take This Oath,â at International.

Maurice Conn was bankrupt by 1938, and the former Conn Studio would then be home to Progressive Pictures Corp., the company having just made three features at the Grand National Studio, with more announced but never made. Instead, the Sunset Studio would be home to Sam Katzman’s Victory Pictures, which used the plant for interiors on eight Tim McCoy westerns.

In July 1939, Progressive moved all their executive and production staff down the street on Beachwood near the California Studio, forming Producers Pictures Corp. and Producers Distributing Corp., the forerunner of Producers Releasing Corp. PDC then used the Grand National Studio as their rental lot, starting their initial film, âTorture Ship,â in early September 1939.

Sig Neufeld was in charge of production for PDC, the producing arm known as Producers Pictures Corp. Sig and his brother, director Sam Newfield, had worked for Arthur and Max Alexander at the Century Studio in the 1920s.

Jumping ahead after PDC was reorganized as PRC in March 1940, the new company’s first nine films were made by Sigmund Neufeld Productions, Inc., whose office was based out of a studio at 1033 North Cahuenga Boulevard, headquarters of his previous outfit, Excelsior Pictures Corp.

The Sunset Studio would briefly house PRC’s offices as the company was getting its feet off the ground, setting up their exchanges and lining up other unit producers to make its product.

PRC initially listed their studio at 1033 North Cahuenga Avenue and then 6404 Hollywood Boulevard, in the Creque Building, but very little is known about the latter plant. Perhaps it was used for interiors on their first westerns. By October 1940, the company had established permanent offices in the Palmer Building on Hollywood Boulevard.

By now firmly established, PRC moved their offices from North Highland Avenue to 1440 North Gower Street in May 1942, the leased Chadwick Studio, acquired in January 1942, just down from the Columbia Drug Co. seen in the photo. PRC had first used the Chadwick plant in late 1940, just after Columbia Pictures relinquished its multi-year lease.

The offices were relocated about four months later to the Talisman Studio where most of PRC’s productions were being made, the company continuing to use the small Gower Street plant which was bannered PRC STUDIOS.

The Gower studio was previously being used by Range Busters, Inc., headed by former Monogram executive George W. Weeks who released his westerns through the company. He would move to the Cinematone Studio on Gordon Street, around the corner from Sunset Studio.

Besides leasing their studio, the Alexanders also produced under various names: Beacon Productions, Normandy Pictures, Colony Pictures, and M&A (Merrick-Alexander) Productions. The latter company, having just made two films for Select Attractions, then became a production unit for PRC, lensing their first feature for the company, âHard Guy,â beginning on August 19, 1941.

Earlier, in mid-1940, Academic Film Co., Inc., was formed with the Alexanders in charge of making 16mm American historical two-reel shorts at their studio. Previous to âHard Guy,â the company had produced five shorts which PRC released, all written and directed by George A. Durlam who had made a number of Syndicate westerns.

Ironically, financing PRC for most of their 1941–42 season was Herbert J. Yates’ Consolidated Film Industries, with PRC receiving a large loan in early 1941. This in return for handling the company’s laboratory work. Also involved in the deal was RCA, which advanced credit on sound equipment. Pathe Laboratories gained control of PRC in January 1942, superceding the three-year agreement with CFI.

In 1942, the Alexanders and Alfred Stern, nephew of Universal founder Carl Laemmle, formed Alexander-Stern Productions, Inc., which would make 40 pictures for PRC up until 1946. The majority were westerns, the company owning somewhat of a rarity for an independent outfit—its own sound truck for location work.

Using rented facilities since its inception, mostly the Talisman and Fine Arts studios, PRC purchased the latter—previously named the Grand National and Educational studios—on Santa Monica Boulevard in August 1943, the equipment and other appurtenances purchased from PRC’s leased Chadwick plant, as well as those from Fine Arts itself.

Columbia, needing more space, had purchased the Talisman plant which forced PRC to find an adequate studio of its own. With the purchase at a public auction, Alexander-Stern Productions moved from their Sunset Studio to the 10-acre, seven-stage PRC lot, the various producing units brought under one roof.

How many of the PRCs were made at the Sunset Studio previous to the move, however, is unknown. It was probably only a few, especially with the war creating shortages in production staff and equipment.

The Alexander brothers produced their last film in late 1948, âAmazon Quest,â at the Chaplin Studio, and then paid full attention to the burgeoning television distribution market with Alexander Productions, which also created a theatrical arm the same year. The Alexanders, however, had been distributing films to television by 1940. M&A Alexander Productions, Inc., formed in 1951, used their former studio’s offices as home base until the early 1960s.

Note that Sunset Studio is unrelated to another rental plant that opened in 1949 under the same name, located at 5545 Sunset Boulevard.

Carrâs initial work at National Studio would be his first all-talking sound film, âHandcuffed,â for Rayart. Carr then made âBride of the Desertâ there, a Rayart western, before moving to the Darmour Studio to produce for Johnston’s newly formed Continental Talking Pictures Corp.

While at Darmour, Carr began producing a series of Bob Steele westerns for Tiffany, beginning in March 1930, while continuing there to make three more features for Continental. He also went to the East Coast to make one of Syndicate’s few non-westerns, âConvict’s Code,â at the Metropolitan Studio, Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Previous to working at Darmour and National, Carr was using California Studio, Metropolitan Studio and Mack Sennett’s newly completed plant to make Rayart’s busy schedule of productions.

In June 1930, Carr returned to the National Studio to make more of Syndicate’s westerns, using Powers Cinephone recording equipment initially borrowed from Ralph Like. The company’s product would be all-talking sound films for the first time, starting with âThe Lonesome Trail,â although made under the Raytone Talking Pictures Corp. banner, a subsidiary of Rayart.

Carr completed his last Bob Steele picture in January 1931, to resume later, timing with the formation of Monogram the following month, the company continuing its lease on the National Studio. He began overseeing the last of Syndicate’s productions, with Balsley and Phillips-Western Electric replacing the Cinephone equipment in early February 1931.

At the same time the two-story studio underwent renovations, which included soundproofing of the third stage and construction of projection, cutting and re-recording rooms. Balsley and Phillips also built a laboratory around the corner on Gordon Street.

The little plant, now called Monogram Pictures Studios, soon to have 60 regular employees, was being readied for the start of production in late April, initially with âShips of Hate.â Trem Carr, Monogram’s vice-president for production, would have direct supervision of all activities on the West Coast, with two stages dedicated to production, encompassing 18,000 square feet.

After the completion of âShips of Hateâ at Monogram, Carr resumed Tiffany’s Bob Steele westerns at Darmour, in May 1931, churning out eight more oaters for his Trem Carr Pictures, Ltd., the last film completed in July 1932. Steele would then begin work on eight westerns under contract to Monogram.

Continental Talking Pictures made three more features after Monogram was formed: âDefenders of the Law,â âThe Mystery Trainâ and âAir Eagles,â all produced in 1931, in that order, by Larry Darmour at his small studio. Although uncredited, âAir Eaglesâ was produced by Big Productions Film Corp., co-founded in 1914 by W. Ray Johnston, the company also producing eight Syndicate westerns starring Bob Steele.

The last release of Syndicate Pictures was âLaw of the Rio Grandeâ on July 20, 1931, starring Bob Custer, produced by Webb-Douglas Productions with interiors at Monogram although the company, which had made other Syndicate westerns, was based earlier at Ralph Like’s Cinephone Studio—purchased by the new Monogram in 1942 when it was called International Studio.

Subsequent releases by Syndicate Exchanges after âLaw of the Rio Grandeâ were unrelated to Syndicate Pictures. The former continued to use the name as a state rights distributor until 1941, when it acquired PRC’s New York franchise, the exchange’s product unrelated to its former namesake.

Monogram’s exchanges were independently owned and operated, each franchise holder required to own stock in the company and pay a pro rata share of each film’s cost.

When Monogram was revived in 1937, W. Ray Johnston, former Republic Pictures president, acquired the outstanding stock—about 45 per cent—of Monogram Pictures Corp. that was still owned largely by franchise holders who transitioned to Republic in 1935. Along with the stock owned by Johnston, Monogram was reborn which included most of its original film library.

Trem Carr left Republic in January 1936, Nat Levine purchasing Carr’s 50 per cent interest in Republic Pictures Corp., the distributing unit, and Republic Productions, Inc., the producing unit, reportedly for $500,000. Carr would then produce for Universal.

In October 1937, Carr, a substantial shareholder, was elected a member of the new Monogram’s board of directors, and in 1941 was once again head of production at the studio.

For its 1930–1931 season, Syndicate also offered 18 Walt Disney Alice comedies, a combination of live action and cartoons, first released in 1925–1926; and 12 two-reel westerns starring Jack Hoxie, culled from features first released in the early 1920s by Arrow Film Corp., W. Ray Johnston the company’s vice-president until 1924, when he organized Rayart Pictures. All the shorts were synchronized with new sound.

Dallas and Oklahoma City, prime territories for Syndicate’s westerns, were operated as separate entities by Syndicate and Monogram yet shared the same managers when the latter was organized.

By the end of 1941, Republic owned 23 of its 33 domestic exchanges, most if not all acquired between 1939–1941. The company continued to purchase more, finalizing its ownership of all franchises by acquiring Sheffield’s multiple units in 1946.

By April 1958, Republic had sold 19 of its 32 company-owned exchanges (Butte, Montana, was closed by then), with more to follow as distribution was farmed out to state righters, the company returning briefly to its franchised origins:

Buffalo-Albany, Waldman Films; Atlanta and Jacksonville, Capitol Releasing; Boston, Embassy Pictures; Charlotte, American-Astor Distributing Co.; Chicago, Linro, Inc.; Cincinnati, Screen Classics; Cleveland, Imperial Pictures; Dallas, Empire Pictures Distributing Co. (a subsidiary of General Films Distributing Co.); Denver, Apex Films (American International Pictures of Colorado); Des Moines, Realart Pictures of Iowa and Nebraska; Detroit, Allied Film Exchange; Indianapolis, Howco Film Exchange; Kansas City, United Film Exchange; Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland-Seattle, Favorite Films of California; Memphis, Colonial Pictures; Milwaukee and Minneapolis, Independent Film Distributors; New Orleans, Howco Pictures of Louisiana; New York, Realart Film Exchange of N.Y.; Philadelphia, American International Pictures; Pittsburgh, Screen Guild Productions of Pittsburgh; St. Louis, Realart Pictures of St. Louis; Salt Lake City, R.T. Pictures; Washington, American International Pictures Exchange of Washington.

Monogram exchanges 1931–1935, which became Republic unless noted. An asterix denotes a franchise of Syndicate Pictures Corp. in late 1930.
