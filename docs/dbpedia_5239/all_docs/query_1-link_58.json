        "text": "Completing the jungle theme for now is Congo Bill (1948).\n\nThis is a later serial, and is pretty unremarkable. The story is about yet another orphan (lion) girl growing up in the African wilderness to become a white queen. And, of course, she’s also an heiress, so there are villains intent on getting their hands on the fortune. The only difference here is that she’s the queen of “a lost white tribe”. She’s less than convincing, and looks more like a tourist holidaying in Hawaii (only here the natives aren't so welcoming).\n\nYet the first few episodes are promising. The story begins in America at the winter quarters of The Culver Circus, for whom Congo Bill (a character from Action comics) is employed as an animal trapper and trainer. There’s dark dealings, murder and attempted murder. The back of the DVD cover reads:\n\nIn 1954, the country of Finland banned the serial claiming it was too violent...Even Don McGuire, the actor who played the lead of Congo Bill publicly told reporters it was the lowest part of his acting career.\n\n(I didn't realize the Finns were so faint hearted! )\n\nThe first few episodes may appear more violent, but it isn’t much by today’s standards. One of the circus directors is hit over the head and dragged in front of a gorilla’s cage to be killed. Another victim is interrogated in a lion’s cage as the animal in question is gradually breaking down the barrier between them. The victim spills the beans, but is still left to be mauled by the lion.\n\nWhen the action moves to Africa it becomes much more standard fare, with a scrubby California doing duty for the dark continent. There is, however, one 'violent' scene in a torture chamber where Congo Bill is strapped to a bench and bullwhipped. Apart from that there’s the usual storyline plus lots of plotting by men in white suits at the Green Parrot hotel, a location described in a Conradian manner by the narrator as\n\n…the infamous inn of the Green Parrot, the last stop of humanity’s dregs on the path to oblivion.\n\nI fast forwarded through quite a bit of the later parts of this one (when it was obvious that nothing was happening apart from walking or fighting).\n\nKing of the Mounties (1942)\n\nI didn’t realize that parts of this serial are regarded as ‘lost’. It’s incomplete inasmuch as a third of the sound is missing along with a one reel of film. However, it’s been restored by Eric Stedman of the Serial Squadron: meaning that missing audio dialogue has subtitles; sound-effects are re-created; missing scenes are replaced by stills and written descriptions.\n\nIt’s a shame because it’s a pretty good serial, though the majority of the 12 episodes are the original material… and it’s directed by William Witney!\n\nThe story concerns the combined German/Japanese/Italian plans to invade Canada and the US. The flying wing from Spy Smasher is used here to transport the villains down into their hideout in a semi-active volcano. Very James Bond, but also very dangerous, as the flying wing is the only way in and out.\n\nThere are plenty of fistfights and vehicle chases against a very scenic backdrop (another part of California standing in for Canada?)\n\nI think this is the first serial in which I’ve seen blood. Usually deaths are bloodless, and bullets pass magically through clothing without leaving any work for the tailor. Yet blood pouring under a closet door alerts Sgt. King to the body of Captain Sato, which promptly falls out onto the floor. As King is ducking down to check the body, a saboteur throws a knife which buries itself in the doorframe, just where King had been standing a moment before. It’s a very slick sequence.\n\nSergeant Dave King of the Mounties virtually defeats the invasion plans single-handed, whether from horseback or from the air. He even loses his lemon squeezer during fistfights, though not while hanging onto the wing of his climbing P40 Warhawk while attemping to prevent a Japanese soldier from making off with it. (I was wondering why, when Harrison was having trouble keeping his hat on filming TLC, why they didn't immediately resort to the serial trick of placing a rubber band under the band).\n\nBeing originally released in 1942 I can see this one playing as propaganda, since much of the villainy is undertaken by home grown saboteurs. Just the thing to encourage kids to turn in their traitor parents! The final sentiments about freedom and democracy, and the need for unity between Canada, USA and Britain, were obviously very pointed, this being 1942, with the camera pausing on the portraits of Roosevelt and Churchill. In an earlier episode Admiral Yamata mentions the American bombing of Tokyo, which is a presumably a reference to the Doolittle Raid of 18th April 1942 undertaken by sixteen B-25s from the carrier USS Hornet.\n\nAt the end I expected to see the 'Buy War Bonds' message, which appeared in films of the time. Though I've yet to see a serial of the period that does. Possibly because they were aimed at children, and not at families where the the bread winners would be sitting in the audience.\n\nYet, War Bonds did appear in comics, such as this 1943 one, topical to King of the Mounties, since War Bond is clouting Hirohito, Hitler and Mussolini:\n\nDrums of Fu Manchu (1940)\n\nI?m five chapters into this William Witney and John English Republic serial.\n\nSo far it?s turning out to be a really good one, already full of murder and intrigue.\n\nFu Manchu is seeking the lost tomb of Genghis Khan, ??the goal of every archaeologist in the world?? Inside the tomb les the ?sacred sceptre? of Genghis, which will give Fu control over Asia in a year regarded by them as ?holy?.\n\nOpposing him is Sir Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard, and Allan Parker, son of ?the eminent archaeologist? Dr. James Parker.\n\nThis serial has a lot of atmosphere. It begins with a city in the rain, and one of Fu Manchu?s lobotomized zombie servants, known as Dacoits, stalking Sir Nayland.\n\nFu Manchu is suitably evil and often a step ahead of the game. He presents such delights as torture by the ?Seven Gates of Paradise?, involving a rat-filled cage, and the ?Pendulum of Doom?, which Fu explains was envisaged by Edgar Allan Poe. He also has a trapdoor in his ?throne room? leading to a watery cavern complete with a giant octopus ? pre-dating Jabba?s Rancor pit by forty years.\n\nThere is a trail of clues to follow, such as scrolls, and a plaque. When the translation of a scroll is seized by Fu Manchu the opponents seem at a loss, until it?s revealed that they had made a Photostat copy. It?s reminiscent of Toht having a copy of the Headpiece of Ra on his hand, despite the fact the original was gone.\n\nIn another scene reminiscent of Indy, Allan Parker and Mary Randolph are aboard Fu?s plane. The fuel is leaking from a broken pipe so Fu and his pilot jump out with the only parachutes, leaving Allan and Mary to their fate?\n\nThe fifth chapter, entitled ?The House of Terror?, is brimming with atmosphere. Sir Nayland goes to the creepy old house of a reclusive professor. It?s night and rain is lashing down amid a raging thunderstorm. The grounds are patrolled by vicious dogs, yet Fu and his Dacoits are creeping up through the gardens?\n\nDrums of Fu Manchu (1940)\n\nEpisode six has an even greater similarity to Toht's hand and the imprint left upon it by the Headpiece.\n\nFu Manchu and his Decoits have stolen the Kardac plaque segment from Ezra Howard's 'House of Terror', and once again Sir Nayland and Allan Parker fear that Fu has taken the hunt out of their control.\n\nHowever, an imprint of the plaque is discovered in the wet mud of the garden. Nayland covers it with his coat, saying he will take a plaster cast mould.\n\nIt's another reversal of the situation in Raiders, yet one that screams out as a possible origin. I don't know if Drums of Fu Manchu was ever in the back of Lucas' mind during the Raiders story conference, but they were planning to have scenes in Shanghai, and the also connection with the good guys being left aboard a Chinese gangster's fuel-leaking aeroplane after the the Chinese have baled out with the only parachutes:\n\nGEORGE LUCAS: Some very rich Chinese war lord.\n\n...\n\nGEORGE LUCAS : One, he goes to the War Lord to steal the thing. That makes sense. It makes sense that the War Lord would have made copies. How did they get the top section? What if it's metal and flat, and in the fight it rolls across the floor. One guy sees it and he goes for it. What if it rolls across the floor and into the fire and the fire sort of burns past it. It's sitting there smoldering. One of the guys sees it and goes over and grabs it, and then screams. That guy runs off. Back here he says they had a copy of one part, but how did they get they other. \"A man had it burned into his hand.\" It would just be a rough copy...\n\nThe Drifter said:\n\nHere is a random question for you all.\n\nWould there be any modern movie or series that you would consider to be a type of serial or close to them, other than the Indiana Jones films?\n\nSky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was directly inspired by the serials. At one stage it was going to have chapter breaks with cliff-hangers.\n\nThe Star Wars movies were, of course, inspired by Flash Gordon. And that's continued with the current Clone Wars series.\n\nIt seems like a lot of television series employ the cliff-hanger device, particulary in the last episode of a series, e.g., Alias, Battlestar Galactica (new series), etc. For the most part modern movies and TV series are much more sophisticated, as they're intended for a broader and more discerning audience, so it's hard to place them directly on the simplistic pattern of the majority of serials from the '30s to the '50s.\n\nMeanwhile, I finished Drums of Fu Manchu.\n\nThe first half was definitely the best, as the later episodes become more generalized when they move to 'India' and 'Afghanistan (?)'\n\nYet, there were still some references that could easily have inspired the Indy movies:\n\nThe Kardac plaque segment reveals the next location in the search for the lost tomb of Genghis Kahn as 'The Temple of the Blind Dragon', which has since been renamed 'The Temple of the Sun', the same name as the Grail Temple in The Last Crusade.\n\nTravelling to The Temple of the Sun, Allan and Sir Nayland are ambushed by tribesmen in a reversal of the situation in which the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword ambush Vogel’s convoy. And whereas Vogel’s tank goes over the cliff, here it’s Allan and Nayland’s car (and it’s not even the Republic woody wagon! Though two of them make an appearance later, and both of them end up over a cliff!)\n\nOffering Mary Randolph as a sacrifice to the Goddess of the Sun, Fu Manchu plans to use a death ray, directing the rays of the sun through a crystal, to which the Eye of Ra in the Map Room may be a nod.\n\nOutside the entrance to the tomb is a spear trap triggered by a trip wire, and in an antechamber there’s a statue of Kali. And inside the burial chamber itself the act of opening the lid of the box containing the sacred sceptre closes the door, sealing in any robber, while gas is released.\n\nAside from those possible Indy-isms, the British Army comes to te rescue when the tribesmen rise up, and there's a mini Gunga Din battle scene.\n\nThe Drifter said:\n\nHere is a random question for you all.\n\nWould there be any modern movie or series that you would consider to be a type of serial or close to them, other than the Indiana Jones films?\n\nMontana was right to recommend \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" as a modern serial-esque flick. Two more are the mid-90s films, \"The Shadow\" and \"The Phantom\". Both of them were serials in the '40s and were based on pulp magazine/comic book characters. (I don't care for \"The Shadow\" but the first half of \"The Phantom\" in the jungle is rather good.)\n\nAs for modern TV series, \"24\" and \"Lost\" definitely leave the viewer hanging but not in the same way as the old classics.\n\nNot many people remember the TV series from 1979 called, \"Cliffhangers\". It was a 1 hour show with 3 seperate stories of 20 mins. each. They all ended in a cliffhanger and I was addicted. Sadly, the series got cancelled after a only a couple of months and it has never been commercially available on VHS nor DVD.\n\nHas anyone seen the colourized feature length version of a serial?\n\nI noticed that there's a colourized version of The Crimson Ghost, which is described here:\n\nThis is the 1946 serial classic, The Crimson Ghost- starring Linda Stirling, Charles Quigley and Clayton Moore- completely COLORIZED, turning the B&W original into a FULL COLOR feature!! Not only that, but although all 12 chapters are here, and not a SECOND of vital story is missing, the recaps and credits have been edited out for better single-sitting viewing, which alters the running time from a cumbersome 240 minutes in the black & white original to a streamlined 93 minutes for this full-color version. But every bit of this great adventure cliffhanger remains\n\nI can't imagine that recaps and credits account for the missing 147 minutes. Yet the blurb says \"every bit...remains\".\n\nAs a completist I'd want to see the redundant scenes as well, but the novelty of colour is intriguing.\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nHas anyone seen the colourized feature length version of a serial?\n\nI noticed that there's a colourized version of The Crimson Ghost, which is described here:\n\nThanks a lot for posting the link, Smiffy, because I've never seen a colourized serial before and I must say that it looks swell (yes, \"swell\")! Would love to see this treatment on my favourites.\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nI can't imagine that recaps and credits account for the missing 147 minutes. Yet the blurb says \"every bit...remains\".\n\nAs a completist I'd want to see the redundant scenes as well, but the novelty of colour is intriguing.\n\nThe time of 240 minutes down to 93 doesn't make any sense. \"The Crimson Ghost\" was apparently 167 minutes long (not 240). The credits, etc. reach approximately 3-4 mins. each.\n\n4 x 12 = 48 minutes (a very, generous total for the length of all the credits)\n\n167 - 48 = 119 minutes (without the credits)\n\n119 - 93 = 26 minutes\n\nThese leftover (approximate) 26 minutes *could* be the repeats of the previous chapter endings (AND/OR the re-cap scenes towards the end). ALL THAT SAID, whether \"every bit remains\" or not, the colour version of \"The Crimson Ghost\" seems like a bargain!\n\nStoo said:\n\nThanks a lot for posting the link, Smiffy, because I've never seen a colourized serial before and I must say that it looks swell (yes, \"swell\")! Would love to see this treatment on my favourites.\n\nThen it, too, shall go on the list!\n\nStoo said:\n\nThe time of 240 minutes down to 93 doesn't make any sense. \"The Crimson Ghost\" was apparently 167 minutes long (not 240).

That might have been the starting point.\n\nStoo said:\n\nALL THAT SAID, whether \"every bit remains\" or not, the colour version of \"The Crimson Ghost\" seems like a bargain!\n\nEven more of a bargain as it's among that list to choose from. The next possible selection now looks like:\n\nAdventures of Captain Marvel\n\nThe Adventures of Smilin? Jack\n\nThe Crimson Ghost\n\nThe Crimson Ghost ? colourized feature length film\n\nFlash Gordon\n\nFlash Gordon Conquers the Universe\n\nFlash Gordon's Trip to Mars\n\nGang Busters\n\nThe Great Alaskan Mystery\n\nKing of the Texas Rangers\n\nThe Masked Marvel\n\nThe Master Key\n\nSecret Agent X-9 (1945)\n\nThe Secret Code\n\nS.O.S. Coast Guard\n\nThe Spider?s Web\n\nThough I still have eight left to watch at the moment.\n\nI started watching G-Men vs. The Black Dragon (1943) a few days ago, and managed one episode. Just couldn't get into it, even though it's\n\na William Witney serial. I read that it was his last production before leaving for military service, and had even left before filming was complete.\n\nTried again and got to the end of episode four. It feels tired. That's in spite of good special effects, with some great exploding buildings, and energetic fight scenes that relish in destroying as much of each set as possible. Three minutes into the first episode a car has already gone over a cliff!\n\nThe biggest drawback is that the main villain, Oyama Haruchi, the leader of the Black Dragon Society, is a white man (Nino Pipitone) poorly made up to play a Japanese with a very strange accent. That wasn?t a problem when Henry Brandon played the Chinese Fu Manchu, as his appearance was intentionally bizarre. However, he's every bit as evil as Fu, as he politely requests a scientist to sit for his torture. A heavy softens up the victim with a couple of whacks with a rubber pipe (off-screen), before a cord is wound around his neck and pulled by two men until the scientist raises his hand in submission.\n\nOne unusual inclusion is Haruchi?s pet Raven, which has been trained to fetch items, and kill on command (seems as though he has poison on his beak when he pecks).\n\nGot to persevere with this one.\n\nDespite the top notch special effects, miniature work and variety of locations, G-Men vs. The Black Dragon didn't hold my attention. The biggest problem was still the appearance and accent of Nino Pipitone's Haruchi. In some scenes his white face paint resembles the Phantom of the Opera's mask, and his accent is all over the place, but more usually settling on the wastern European.\n\nRex Bennett, the main hero, might be a top G-Man but he can't take a prisoner. Every time somebody pulls a gun to make a capture a fistfight ensues. Add to that three cars over a cliff and I get the feeling that they rushed this story more than the better serials.\n\nOn the upside Rex does a good anterior Bruce Willis in Die Hard: falling out of a skyscraper's window he grabs a fire hose.\n\nThe electricity pylons exploding and upping the threat level during a fistfight was also a bit different.\n\nAs a product of 1943 it's imperative that democracy conquers in the end, as the last chaper's title promises. For the last shot it's the reformed Raven that waves a little Stars and Stripes. (He wasn't bad after all, just \"badly trained\").\n\nSo, I watched <I>King of the Rocket Men</I> yesterday.\n\nDespite what this poster suggests, there's only one rocket man in the only thing. Apparently \"King of\" was a naming trope for a few of the serials.\n\nMan, Stoo, are you ever right when you say that lots of cars go over cliffs in these things. I'm pretty sure there were two cars and a motorcycle at various points in the serial.\n\nSomething Montana mentions here occurred in one of them:\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nThe recaps do sometimes change. They intercut new footage showing what had been held back on the first viewing. So while the original might show the hero bound in a burning building, and then the building exploding, the recap might show a colleague entering the building to perform the rescue.\n\nThe car went over the cliff at the end of one of them, while the chapter following revealed that Rocket Man and the heroine jumped out of the car on his suggestion first.\n\nOne of the chapters, the tenth, was almost entirely a recap of what had come up to then, which I think you fellows have mentioned happens. The final chapter includes reused footage of the flooding of New York City from an older film, 1933's <I>Deluge</I>. The villain, a Dr. Vulcan, is some sort of scientist. Interestingly, so are the heroes, both the lead who takes on the identity of Rocket Man, and also his associate who invented the suit.\n\nA word of warning to any who might try viewing the serials on Netflix Instant: the order of the chapters was not always correct. They were all included - twelve chapters, in this case - but they were not in the proper order.\n\nAttila the Professor said:\n\nSo, I watched <I>King of the Rocket Men</I> yesterday.\n\nSomething Montana mentions here occurred in one of them:\n\nThey play with time as well. In the first showing the time between showing the character in peril and then the eventual mishap is condensed. In the second showing it becomes apparent that the character had more time available before the mishap. It's a cheap trick, and the young serial audience at the time would surely have soon got wise to it. Yet, as Stoo pointed out, it's not a question of 'if' the character will survive, but 'how'.\n\nWith all the vehicles going over the cliff, accompanied inevitably by the same survival technique (i.e. jump out before it's too late), I can't see that it would be the cliffhanger that encourages the viewer to return to the cinema the following week - but rather the draw of the story and of future cliffhangers and other action.\n\nAttila the Professor said:\n\nOne of the chapters, the tenth, was almost entirely a recap of what had come up to then, which I think you fellows have mentioned happens.\n\nI saw that done in one of the serials I watched early on. It struck me as a very cheap trick to pull on the audience!\n\nSo, Attila, did you enjoy the process of watching King of the Rocket Men, or did it become a trial you felt you had to go though?\n\nI've experienced both reactions while going through my list.\n\nThe ones that have left the best impression so far have been:\n\nZorro Rides Again\n\nZorro's Fighting Legion\n\nJungle Girl - mainly for the connections I couldn't help making with Temple of Doom\n\nSpy Smasher\n\nDrums of Fu Manchu - especially the first half\n\nJungle Menace - for its noirish atmosphere\n\nMysterious Doctor Satan\n\nAttila the Professor said:\n\nSo, I watched <I>King of the Rocket Men</I> yesterday.\n\nDespite what this poster suggests, there's only one rocket man in the only thing. Apparently \"King of\" was a naming trope for a few of the serials.\n\nIn the case of \"King of the Mounties\", the hero's name is actually Sergeant King.\n\nAttila the Professor said:\n\nMan, Stoo, are you ever right when you say that lots of cars go over cliffs in these things. I'm pretty sure there were two cars and a motorcycle at various points in the serial.\n\nThe car went over the cliff at the end of one of them, while the chapter following revealed that Rocket Man and the heroine jumped out of the car on his suggestion first.\n\nOne of the chapters, the tenth, was almost entirely a recap of what had come up to then, which I think you fellows have mentioned happens.\n\nIt is common to have a later episode show many scenes from previous chapters, which was probably done as a 'review' for anyone who missed out on the beginning (or middle) of the run.\n\nRe: Cars going over cliffs. Yeah, that's the serials' classic standard!\n\nAttila the Professor said:\n\nA word of warning to any who might try viewing the serials on Netflix Instant: the order of the chapters was not always correct. They were all included - twelve chapters, in this case - but they were not in the proper order.\n\nDear Lord. Anyway, Attila, I am pleased that you finally managed to see a complete series. Nice to have you joining the discussion!\n\nMontana Smiffy said:\n\nThe recaps do sometimes change. They intercut new footage showing what had been held back on the first viewing. So while the original might show the hero bound in a burning building, and then the building exploding, the recap might show a colleague entering the building to perform the rescue.\n\n\"Perils of Nyoka\" wins the prize of Craziest Offender for a changed recap. Without trying to spoil anything, it has one particular cliffhanger where many of the shots were filmed twice. One version WITH the life-saving prop in her hands and one WITHOUT. It's big difference!\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\nI think in every case the character's name is 'King' - Jeff King of Rocket Men; Tom King of the Texas Rangers (and incidentally that last one is supposed to be one of the best serials from numerous reviews).\n\nI didn't realize that! Thought it was only \"King of the Mounties\".\n\nRegarding your trouble enjoying \"G-Men vs. The Black Dragon\": It's not the greatest, I know, but perhaps it pales in comparison to what you've already seen because you've watched so many, one after another, in such a short span of time. If you had watched it earlier on maybe you would've appreciated it more? You may be suffering from a serial overdose!\n\nMontana Smith said:\n\n...energetic fight scenes that relish in destroying as much of each set as possible\n\nRex is good for that. I love seeing everything in the rooms get destroyed! Remember, \"G-Men vs. The Black Dragon\" is followed by, \"Secret Service in Darkest Africa\", the other Rex Bennett adventure...with MANY MORE fistfights!\n\nLeave nothing unsmashed.\n\nStoo said:\n\nRegarding your trouble enjoying \"G-Men vs. The Black Dragon\": It's not the greatest, I know, but perhaps it pales in comparison to what you've already seen because you've watched so many, one after another, in such a short span of time.

I think that if I'd seen it first I would have been impressed.\n\nI had a John Wayne marathon to cleanse the palate... Rio Bravo, El Dorado, True Grit, Chisum, Cahill U.S. Marshal, Rooster Cogburn. But it didn't do the trick with G-Men vs. The Black Dragon!\n\nStoo said:\n\nRex is good for that. I love seeing everything in the rooms get destroyed!\n\nG-Men left very little intact. It is fun watching a room being reduced to splinters! In one scene you see him deliberately kick out the stair rails in preparation for throwing the thug through them!\n\nStoo said:\n\nRemember, \"G-Men vs. The Black Dragon\" is followed by, \"Secret Service in Darkest Africa\", the other Rex Bennett adventure...with MANY MORE fistfights!\n\nLeave nothing unsmashed.\n\nMore?
