        "text": "What makes films memorable and meaningful? Great cinematographers are not only translators of a directorâ€™s vision but are involved in a dance between director and actor. When combined with personal techniques like handheld, the camera itself can become a character, bringing us back in time and behind the eyes of well-known figures like Van Gogh and Stephen Hawking, which is what BenoÃ®t Delhomme did in the films At Eternityâ€™s Gate and The Theory of Everything.\n\nBenoÃ®t Delhomme studied cinematography at the Ã‰cole nationale supÃ©rieure Louis-LumiÃ¨re and went on to make his breakthrough as a director of photography for the movie The Scent of Green Papaya directed by Tran Anh Hung. The film went on to win the CamÃ©ra d'Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award. BenoÃ®t has established himself as an international cinematographer and has worked with creatives such as Al Pacino, Julian Schnabel, and James Marsh. Over the years, BenoÃ®t Delhomme has worked on a wide array of films where his focus has been to tell a strong story through the visual. This focus has shined not only through his work as a cinematographer, but also his work as a painter.\n\nI don't know if Julian Schnabel trusted me, and I had to prove myself. For example, he had another guy in mind. And for many weeks, he said to me, \"Maybe we should keep two cinematographers?\" And one evening he said, \"I'm going to paint in my outdoor studio tonight if you want to come.\" And, I went to see him painting and brought a small digital camera. And he had music on and was doing this incredible painting. I was kind of fascinated to be there. We didn't talk. He knew I was filming him. He didn't say anything. So I spent part of the night cutting my small documentary. And in the morning at breakfast, I put my computer on the breakfast table and showed it to him, and he was so focused and very moved by what he saw. And he said, \"Okay, you captured what I was doing. You've got the film.\"\n\n*\n\nIf you want to do your art well, you need to have some pleasure. If talking is not a pleasure, it's horrible. And when filming on a set is a bad experience, it's one of the worst things in life. As a cinematographer, if you can't make what you do personal to you, there is no soul. You need to make it personal.\n\nThis interview was conducted by Mia Funk with the participation of collaborating universities and students. Associate Interviews Producers on this episode were Sophie Garnier and Tara Swan. The Creative Process is produced by Mia Funk. Additional production support by Katie Foster.\n\nMia Funk is an artist, interviewer and founder of The Creative Process & One Planet Podcast (Conversations about Climate Change & Environmental Solutions)."
