        "text": "The Mandalorian season four has yet to be confirmed, but we are getting another adventure with Din Djarin and Baby Yoda.\n\nIn January, the Star Wars franchise surprisingly confirmed The Mandalorian & Grogu movie, which is rumoured to start filming this year. Could this be in place of season four or separate from it?\n\nSince the season three finale dropped in April 2023, there's been barely a word on the show's development. But Jon Favreau confirmed in May 2022 that he was already writing the fourth season.\n\nSo what's going on? Here's everything you need to know about The Mandalorian season four.\n\nThe Mandalorian season 4 potential release date: When will The Mandalorian season 4 be on Disney+?\n\nThere's no official release date for The Mandalorian season four at the time of writing.\n\nUsually, we'd say you could expect a new season to debut later in the year, as the first season premiered in November 2019 and the second in October 2020.\n\nHowever, season three was delayed until March 2023, and now it seems season four will be delayed as well (if it's released at all).\n\nFilming may have been pushed back from its scheduled September start date because of the Hollywood strikes last year, Deadline reported. However, since the strikes have ended, there has been no movement on the Mando front – despite Favreau saying the scripts are complete.\n\n\"I know that Jon has written the scripts. I know he's excited about continuing to tell stories in this world, and so when and how that happens, considering everything, we'll see,\" executive producer Rick Famuyiwa told Deadline. \"It's certainly coming. I just don't know exactly when.\"\n\nFamuyiwa's comments feed into the rumour that season four could have become The Mandalorian & Grogu.\n\nIt's possible that those \"completed scripts\" have been reimagined into a feature-length film. But for those who still have an appetite for more from the series, there may be some hope.\n\nFamuyiwa discussed the season four production process with Collider, saying, \"I'd be shocked if they just stopped making them at this point.\"\n\nHe added: \"But yeah, I think that's just the way shows come together, and the process around the shows, I know that they're deep into starting the prep and the pre-production process. Now exactly when it goes to lens and things start to shoot, I don't know…\"\n\nWe're not too sure either, but either way the release date could heavily depend on where the fourth season sits within the franchise and if it will be set before or after the events of The Mandalorian & Grogu movie.\n\nMandalorian and Grogu's big-screen adventure is scheduled to be released in May 2026, as reported by Deadline.\n\nIf this is the case and The Mandalorian season four is story set after the movie's story arc, then fans could also be looking at 2026 release date for the show, later in the year.\n\nWe would expect it to land in the winter to give enough breathing space between both projects.\n\nHowever, there's also the possibility that its season four is set prior to the movie, in which case, if filming does kick off this year, we would expect the next instalment to land in 2025.\n\nThe Mandalorian season 4 cast: Who will be back in The Mandalorian season 4?\n\nObviously, Din Djarin and Grogu lived to fight another day, so you can expect Pedro Pascal back as the titular Mandalorian (if it even refers to him anymore), even if he has said news of his return is a \"mystery\".\n\n\"There's such preciousness around even saying that I'm signed up for season four if it's already written,\" Pascal told Radio Times. \"I'm naturally a blabbermouth, but I really get protective of it, because I get a thrill out of the surprises that are in store for the audience.\"\n\nAfter the death of Paz Vizsla in season three's penultimate episode, we were prepared for more heartbreaking deaths in the finale – but our heroes all survived.\n\nNow that Mandalore is again controlled by Mandalorians, expect to see more of Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan Kryze, Emily Swallow as the Armorer and Simon Kassianides as Axe Woves, among others.\n\nOne person who (probably) won't be back is Giancarlo Esposito as Moff Gideon, considering the combined forces of Din, Bo-Katan and Grogu – as well as a flaming ship – saw him burned to a crisp.\n\nOther potential returns in season four include Amy Sedaris as Peli Motto and Paul Sun-Hyung Lee as Carson Teva. Although, as mentioned above, nothing has been confirmed yet.\n\nSadly Carl Weathers won't join them as magistrate Greef Karga, the actor having passed away in February.\n\nThe Mandalorian season 4 plot: How does The Mandalorian season 3 ending set up season 4?\n\nWe assume the plot of The Mandalorian season four will largely depend on what happens in The Mandalorian & Grogu.\n\nSince the movie has yet to make its way to theatres, we'll have to do our best guesswork from the season-three finale of Mando.\n\nIn truth, the season three finale felt more like a series finale than something that set up what's to come.\n\nAfter the Moff was defeated, Din Djarin adopted Grogu as his son. As a result, Grogu is now Din Grogu and a Mandalorian apprentice. The duo headed back to Nevarro, where Greef Karga gifted them a cabin outside of town to live in.\n\nNow that he's got Grogu to train, Din Djarin tells Carson Teva that he's going to be \"more selective\" in his assignments, offering to work for the New Republic \"on a case-by-case basis\" – but it's an arrangement that'll be kept between him and Carson.\n\nNevarro has a new marshal, too, but it's not Din Djarin. It's the rebuilt IG-11 (voiced by Taika Waititi).\n\nAnd that's where we end the season: with Din Djarin and Grogu chilling in their new home.\n\nSeason four has a relatively clean slate to start from, and we can expect the Star Wars series to build to director Dave Filoni's movie going forward. The standalone film will tie up this era of Star Wars storytelling, but it could also spin off into new series.\n\nTalking to Variety after the film's announcement at Star Wars Celebration, Filoni spoke about the thread that will tie all the Disney+ series to date into the movie.\n\n\"On a base level, I would just say the coming conflict, the growing idea that the empire wasn't as defeated as a lot of people want to believe and that the remnant is out there,\" he said.\n\nFiloni continued: \"We saw that from the very beginning with The Mandalorian and how Giancarlo's [Esposito] character Gideon was plotting. There are always people that are willing to undermine something that the Republic is trying to build and put back on its feet.\n\n\"I grew up with a lot of stories in the expanding universe that were exploring what happened after Return of the Jedi. There has been this, for fans, idea that there was a new Republic and a remnant Empire and the conflict persisted after Return of the Jedi, even though the heroes won and were more in control. What did that control look like?\n\n\"And since Force Awakens is 30 years on from Return of the Jedi, we have room then to tell another story. That's what I'm coalescing into this time period.\"\n\nThe Mandalorian season 4 trailer: Any footage of The Mandalorian season 4?\n\nSadly not. Once filming kicks off, teaser trailers and first-look pics should follow. But until then, we don't have anything to show you.\n\nAs always, we'll let you know as soon as we know more. But for now, soak in the highlights of season three."
