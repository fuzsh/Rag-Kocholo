        "text": "This article is about the special. You may be looking for the book or the audiobook.\n\nThe Great Discovery is a 2008 direct-to-DVD feature-length special for Thomas & Friends. It was filmed and produced in 2007, and was released in 2008 for US cinemas in July, and later for DVD for the US in September, and was then released for UK cinemas in late September, and later for DVD in October. It is the third Thomas film in the series and the final film to use models and figurines at Shepperton Studios, as well as the final one being made completely in live-action.\n\nPlot\n\nThe railway is preparing for Sodor Day and Thomas and James are racing to the wharf to be given a special job by the Thin Controller. Thomas wins and is sent into the hills to collect lumber with Duncan. After Duncan teases Thomas by stating that the Thin Controller wants him to work with Thomas because Duncan knows the tracks in the hills, Thomas teases back by calling Duncan small. This leads Duncan to pay Thomas out by sending him on an old, disused branch line which he claims will lead Thomas back to the wharf faster.\n\nAfter avoiding an old, collapsing bridge, Thomas takes another route at the old junction and as he journeys further down the line, he comes across an old overgrown town.\n\nJust then, he meets Madge, who he tells the news about the discovery to, and she drives off and meets Mighty Mac, who tell Sir Handel, then Skarloey, then Rheneas, who he tells the Thin Controller about the news, and he gets Harold to find the Fat Controller. After hearing all the news, the Fat Controller tells Thomas that the town is Great Waterton - the largest town on Sodor when steam engines first came to the island that had since been thought to be lost. The Fat Controller decides that the restoration of the legendary lost town would be perfect for Sodor Day and calls the Pack to help. Thomas is told to take charge of the engines working around the town, while a new tank engine named Stanley is brought to do Thomas' regular jobs.\n\nAll of the engines take a liking to Stanley, who does a good job and has fun as well. Unfortunately, Thomas becomes jealous of Stanley after seeing him doing his jobs and fraternising with his friends. He is furious When Stanley takes his place at Tidmouth Sheds, and the final straw comes when Thomas rolls off the tracks and Stanley takes his place as the leader of the restoration project. When Thomas comes back from the works, the Fat Controller decided to let Stanley stay in charge as he has done a good job, much to Thomas' shock and dismay.\n\nLater, Thomas is shunting stone trucks for Stanley to take away when he decides to make Stanley look silly by giving him a train too heavy for him to pull. Unfortunately, the plan backfires - as Stanley ascends the hill, a coupling breaks and the trucks race down the hill, veering into a siding and crashing into the half-finished tower. After that, the Fat Controller states that this will likely set back the restoration past Sodor Day and Thomas takes the blame, causing the other engines, except Stanley, to be angry with him.\n\nLater that night, Thomas decides to clear the rubble out of the way. He is almost finished when he accidentally bumps a truck into an old mine shaft. Racing in after it, Thomas crashes into a blocked tunnel and falls down into the water where he floats down an underground waterway.\n\nAfter the engines meet at Great Waterton, Stanley asks where Thomas is and the engines soon realise that Thomas is missing. The Fat Controller organises a search party and everyone searches everywhere, but no one can find Thomas. While searching, Stanley realises about how upset Thomas has been about him ever since he came to Sodor and all that he had been doing and so decides to help put things right.\n\nEveryone is just about to give up, when Percy reminds them that Thomas found Great Waterton on his own, that it is his town and that they cannot have the opening without him, and everyone agrees after realising how harshly they have treated Thomas lately. Stanley thinks Thomas ran away after the accident yesterday and tries to find him in the hills. Meanwhile, Thomas continues floating in the dark tunnel until he reaches an opening exit to the mine and is flung across a canyon and down a hill without the wooden planks that made him float into the mine.\n\nStanley decides to make another search effort by himself before he returns to work. Thomas, with the last of his steam, sounds a loud, long whistle. Stanley hears it and hurries to where Thomas is stranded beside the track. The two make up and Stanley pulls Thomas back onto the rails, but the strain is too much for Stanley and a valve inside his boiler bursts. Thomas, using some of Stanley's coal, pushes him back to Great Waterton. The word soon spreads that Thomas has been found.\n\nThe standpipe tower is rebuilt, completing the restoration. As a sign of friendship, Thomas offers Stanley his last job - bringing the mayor to the festivities at Great Waterton. The engines gather at the town for the celebration and Thomas realises just how important his friends are.\n\nCharacters\n\nThomas\n\nEdward\n\nHenry\n\nGordon\n\nJames\n\nPercy\n\nToby\n\nEmily\n\nHarvey\n\nSkarloey\n\nSir Handel\n\nRusty\n\nDuncan\n\nFreddie\n\nMighty Mac\n\nMadge\n\nJack\n\nAlfie\n\nOliver the Excavator\n\nNed\n\nHarold\n\nCranky\n\nSir Topham Hatt\n\nLady Hatt\n\nJenny Packard\n\nMr. Percival\n\nBuster (not named)\n\nArthur (speaks only in English and other dubs; does not speak in Japanese dub)\n\nTerence (speaks in Polish dub only; does not speak in English and other dubs)\n\nBill and Ben (do not speak)\n\nMolly (does not speak)\n\nMavis (does not speak)\n\nSalty (does not speak)\n\nRheneas (does not speak)\n\nPeter Sam (does not speak)\n\nAnnie and Clarabel (do not speak)\n\nRocky (does not speak)\n\nBertie (does not speak)\n\nTrevor (does not speak)\n\nMax and Monty (do not speak)\n\nJeremy (does not speak)\n\nSodor Brass Band (do not speak)\n\nThe Mayor of Sodor (does not speak)\n\nDiesel (not named; does not speak)\n\n'Arry and Bert (not named; do not speak)\n\nDiesel 10 (not named; does not speak)\n\nDennis (not named; does not speak)\n\nRosie (cameo)\n\nWhiff (cameo)\n\nGeorge (cameo)\n\nButch (cameo)\n\nStephen Hatt (cameo)\n\nBridget Hatt (cameo)\n\nFarmer Finney (cameo)\n\nRefreshment Lady (cameo)\n\nCyril the Fogman (cameo)\n\nLord Callan (cameo)\n\nDavid Mitton (cameo)\n\nKuffy the Clown (cameo)\n\nThe Photographer (cameo)\n\nSir Topham Hatt's Blond-haired Assistant (cameo)\n\nThe Storyteller (cameo)\n\nThe Clowns (cameos)\n\nSodor Dairy Manager (cameo)\n\nThe Dairy Employees (cameos)\n\nTwo Railway Board Members (cameos)\n\nElizabeth (flashback cameo)\n\nBig Mickey (faceless cameo)\n\nTroublesome Trucks (music video cameos)\n\nHenrietta (music video cameo)\n\nKelly (music video cameo)\n\nDuck (mistakenly mentioned in Finnish dub)\n\nAllicia Botti (mentioned in newspaper)\n\nCharacters Introduced\n\nStanley\n\nJ.

However, he was also planned to appear in the twenty-third series episode, Free the Roads, but also dropped, but this should have been his last appearance until the said episode and this should have been Dennis and George's last appearances in the model series.\n\nThis was the only time for several things:\n\nJamie Thomason's only special as voice director.\n\nStanley's only full model appearance, without a CGI face.\n\nHarvey's only speaking role in a special.\n\nBuster's only appearance in the main series.\n\nThe only time in the main series to feature Jack's horn.\n\nThe only film where a yellow overlay was added on all the footage.

The trailer was released on the original Fox 2008 DVD release, Engines and Escapades. The trailer was altered with the concept logo and also have a quote saying, \"Coming September 9th on DVD, from Hit Entertainment.\" It included the Fox logo. This was later changed when KidToon Films released a trailer for the film's release in theatres, altering the concept logo with the current one, getting rid of the Fox logo and replaced it with the Lionsgate logo and the quote was also altered saying, \"The Great Discovery, from Hit Entertainment.\"\n\nAmong other things, the Sodor Daily newspaper reports that \"Percy is in tears\" and mentions something about \"Trevor the Traction Engine.\" Another article reports on an Allicia Botti concert. The paper's articles are apparently written by \"J.K. Lee.\" The \"Percy in tears\" article could refer to how sad he was after Thomas became lost.\n\nIn the US, special Walmart editions, including a bonus CD featuring all five songs from the special, were released.\n\nOn the UK DVD, in the game Follow the Whistle, part of the Thomas, You're the Leader song will play at the beginning along with an engine's whistle.\n\nThe first UK trailer was narrated by Tim Whitnall, who later joined the voice cast in 2014, six years later.\n\nDue to Jack and the Sodor Construction Company never being shown in Italy, France, Romania, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Middle East, Indonesia, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the audience would not have known who Monty and Buster are. As the sixth series was not fully shown in Latin America, Brazil and not shown at all in Spain, the audience would not have known who Jack and the Sodor Construction Crew are.\n\nAccording to a behind the scenes photo, there are not any rails on the bridge that Molly and Rosie are on at the Great Waterton ceremony.\n\nIn Finland, this special premiered before the tenth series, so the audience would not have known about Rocky, Rosie and Freddie.\n\nIn South Korea, this special premiered before the eleventh series, so the audience would not have known about Madge.\n\nIn Indonesia, this special aired after the twelfth series.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Boxford's Summer House buildings from the eighth series were used for Topham Hall.\n\nLearning Segments were planned to appear during the special similar to Calling All Engines! but they were later removed and put into the bonus features of the US DVD, as the crew felt \"the story was served better by losing those moments\".\n\nAccording to Steve Asquith, a lightweight model of Thomas on wires was used in the shots of him flying across the ravine and hidden rigs under water were used for the flooded mine sequences.\n\nDuring production, Thomas received three new brass models to replace his original plastic model, being twenty-four years old at this point.\n\nThe Great Discovery version of the Engine Roll Call song was dubbed in Korean but it was only seen in theatrical releases, the DVD release only used the English version in South Korea.\n\nIn the US DVD includes the Latin American Spanish and French audio tracks.\n\nThe song \"Thomas, You're the Leader!\" was cut from German TV airings. The special was also split into three 20 minute parts airing on three different days.\n\nIn the PBS Airings, the normal Engine Roll Call is used instead of the one from the special, “Thomas, You’re the Leader!” Was also cut from it\n\nGoofs\n\nWhen Thomas and James race to the wharf, the number of lines between them changes.\n\nThomas and James switch tracks at one point when they race through the wharf.\n\nWhen Thomas and James enter the wharf, Freddie and Skarloey appear twice in two different places.\n\nMighty and Mac have the same whistle sound.\n\nDuncan's buffer beam is chipped.\n\nThe date for the newspaper is Monday, 24th March 1953. However, this date is incorrect, as 24th March 1953 was actually a Tuesday. This also leads to a number of errors, as most characters who are featured in the special either had not arrived on Sodor yet at the time or their basis were not built by then.\n\nWhen Thomas and the Fat Controller leave Great Waterton for Tidmouth Sheds, a red wire can be seen hanging by Thomas' wheels.\n\nThe yellow cab lining on the left side of Thomas' close-up model is chipped.\n\nWhen Thomas arrives at the Great Waterton sheds, James can be seen stopped behind the breakdown crane before he starts moving into frame.\n\nWhen Percy leaves Thomas with Annie and Clarabel, he can be seen stopped offscreen before he moves into frame. Despite this, his puffing can be heard before he starts moving.\n\nWhen Stanley arrives, one of Henry's eyebrows are missing.\n\nWhen Stanley pulls the trucks up the hill, his steam platform continues to emit steam after he has passed over it.\n\nStanley's siderods are out of alignment when his wheels spin as he struggles with the trucks.\n\nWhen the engines are shown covered in brick dust, Toby's face looks crooked and loose.\n\nWhen Stanley returns to Great Waterton after the accident, he is on the track to Thomas' left. In the next scene, when Thomas is alone in a siding, Stanley is on the track to Thomas' right.\n\nWhen the narrator says, \"the engines looked\", James' face is loose.\n\nThroughout the special Percy's left buffer is chipped.\n\nWhen Stanley leaves Great Waterton to look for Thomas, James is seen at the back of the group of engines. After Stanley realises that Thomas has been feeling upset, James is seen behind the line of stone trucks.\n\nIn the close-ups of Thomas in the mine, the light from inside his lamp can be seen shining through the bottom of it.\n\nWhen Thomas sees the barrier in the disused mine he brakes, but before he smashes through the barrier, his wheels are moving again.\n\nWhen Thomas falls off the bank the planks of wood that also fall are bigger than him.\n\nWhen Thomas tips over, a bent piece of rail used to push him up and off the rails can clearly be seen.\n\nWhen Thomas comes to a stop at the bottom of the hill, the grass goes over his face, but in every following scene, the amount covering his face is different, since the next shot is a close up of Thomas' face, so it would need to be clean to show his expression.\n\nAfter Stanley pulls Thomas onto the tracks, the points that lead to where Thomas landed can be seen; this proves a hidden track was used to help Thomas onto the line.\n\nAfter Thomas is pulled back onto the rails, he becomes clean.\n\nAfter being pulled back onto the tracks and after Stanley's boiler valve bursts, Thomas whistles. But the narrator said earlier that Thomas had ran out of puff and could not whistle again.\n\nAt the opening of Great Waterton, Gordon and Henry swap places twice by the standpipe and Jack is sitting on the rails.\n\nDuring the scenes with Jack and the Pack, Percy's stepladder is red, this is because they used his large scale model from the Jack and the Sodor Construction Company series which does not have a green stepladder.\n\nNed's eye pupils appear to be thicker than usual.\n\nIn the shot of Thomas, Max and Monty, Max and Monty's dumpsters are raised. But in the next shot, Max's dumpster has lowered.\n\nBefore Stanley appears on-screen pulling the trucks up the hill, a thin wire is seen pulling him. The same thing happens when Stanley pulls Thomas back onto the tracks.\n\nIn the English dub, the narrator says that the Fat Controller and Miss Jenny arrived after the tower fell down, but the Fat Controller is already at Great Waterton when Stanley starts pulling the trucks and when they rolled down the hill.\n\nWhen the Skarloey Railway engines look for Thomas, Duncan is seen smiling.\n\nMadge's eyes are misaligned when she first starts talking to Mighty Mac.\n\nIn the Finnish dub, Max mistakenly called \"Ankkanen\", which is the Finnish name for Duck.\n\nAt various points of the special, a steam platform is visible in Thomas' scenes such as when he arrives at the siding after the tower accident and when he arrives at Great Waterton with the trucks before the opening.\n\nWhen Duncan arrives at the Transfer yards logs can already be seen on Thomas' flatbeds.\n\nWhen the camera pans over the long line of trucks one of them is crooked.\n\nWhen Thomas slides towards the bottom of the hill the ground slightly sinks.\n\nWhen Thomas starts reversing back to the other side of the bridge the paint on his front wheel is chipped.\n\nThomas' eyes are misaligned during the entire mine chase.\n\nWhen Thomas stops on the bridge the rails in front of him are misaligned.\n\nWhen the small part of the bridge breaks off, it supports a wire that can be seen at the bottom of the screen, this was attempted to be hidden by adding a blur effect on top of it.\n\nIn the widescreen version, when the entire bridge collapses, the edge of the set can be seen to the far right (this does not happen in the fullscreen version as it is cropped off). Also, two small black wires can be seen at the front of the bridge when it does collapse, one of which kicks up dust above Thomas.\n\nOn the UK DVD, in the game Follow the Whistle, Gordon is in Edward's place. He also has Edward's whistle sound and face whenever he blows his whistle.\n\nOn the Canadian Maple Pictures DVD, the back cover refers to Thomas as \"Thomas the Train\", and misspells \"big day\" as \"bug day\".\n\nIn the UK dub, the American term \"freight cars\" is accidentally used at one point.\n\nIn the US dub, the British term \"trucks\" is used at multiple points.\n\nIn South Korea, this special is stated to be the first Thomas movie on the trailer and DVD.\n\nIn the European Portuguese, German and Swedish dubs, the audio of the normal Engine Roll Call was used, so Edward's line is sung while Stanley's part is shown.\n\nWhen Thomas derails the set bounces a bit, and his train tumbles off the tracks twice. This also happens when he land after flying over the ravine.\n\nWhen Stanley coupling snaps the ground jolts up.\n\nAs the Fat Controller says that Great Waterton may not be ready in time for Sodor Day, some of the engines have their eyes misaligned.\n\nIn most scenes Gordon's buffers are crooked.\n\nAt the junction, Gordon's eyes are misaligned, and there is a gap between his face plate and eyes.\n\nWhen Thomas arrives at Great Waterton, Henry passes by him twice. His trucks are also dirty at first, but are clean in the next shot.\n\nWhen Stanley says hello to Thomas at Great Waterton, his eyes are misaligned.\n\nWhen Toby says \"Why would Thomas do such a thing?\" his left eye (viewers' perspective right) is slightly moving on its own.\n\nHenry's eyes are misaligned towards the end of the movie.\n\nIn Other Languages\n\nMerchandise\n\nTake Along\n\nStanley (discontinued)\n\nThomas and Morgan's Mine Car (discontinued)\n\nWorking Hard Gift Pack (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Grand Opening 4 Pack (discontinued)\n\nMorgan's Mine Set (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Fold and Go Set (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Expansion Pack (discontinued)\n\nWooden Railway\n\nStanley (discontinued)\n\nMud Covered Thomas (discontinued)\n\nMorgan's Mine (discontinued)\n\nSodor day Thomas and Stanley (discontinued)\n\nA Race to the Wharf Set (discontinued)\n\nThe Great Discovery Set (discontinued)\n\nMotor Road and Rail\n\nStanley (discontinued)\n\nTrackMaster\n\nStanley (discontinued)\n\nThomas at Action Canyon (Thomas at Tumblin' Bridge in the UK) (discontinued)\n\nThomas at Morgan's Mine (discontinued)\n\nHornby\n\nThomas and the Great Discovery Set (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Station (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Butchers (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Post Office (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Blacksmiths (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Footbridge (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Blacksmiths (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Ben's Books (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Ed's Garage (discontinued)\n\nGreat Waterton Station Platform (discontinued)\n\nStanley's Shed (discontinued)\n\nLEGO\n\nStanley at Great Waterton (discontinued)\n\nThomas at Morgan's Mine (discontinued)\n\nJames Celebrates Sodor Day (discontinued)\n\nCapsule Plarail\n\nStanley\n\nCollectible Railway\n\nStanley\n\nAdventures\n\nStanley\n\nWood\n\nStanley\n\nBooks\n\nThomas and the Great Discovery\n\nMy Thomas Story Library - Stanley (discontinued)\n\nRunaway Engine!\n\nOther\n\nAudiobook\n\nThe Great Discovery Card Game (discontinued)\n\nDVD Bonus Features\n\nUK\n\nIntroducing Stanley text\n\nThomas and James are Racing sing-a-long\n\nJobs-a-Plenty sing-a-long\n\nWhere, oh Where Is Thomas? sing-a-long\n\nThomas, You're the Leader sing-a-long\n\nFollow the Whistle game\n\nUS\n\nThomas, You're the Leader sing-a-long\n\nBehind the Scenes with Pierce Brosnan\n\nSpot the Difference\n\nTough Trucks!\n\nThomas' Puzzle Parts\n\nTrailers\n\nSouth Korea\n\nEngine Roll Call (The Great Discovery version) sing-a-long\n\nThomas, You're the Leader sing-a-long\n\nTrailers\n\nDVD Boxsets\n\nUK\n\n65th Anniversary Gift Box\n\nUltimate Movie Box Set\n\nUS\n\nThe Movie Pack\n\nDiscovery on the Rails\n\nAUS\n\nThe Complete Ninth Series and The Great Discovery Double Pack\n\nGER\n\nAdventure on Rails!\n\nTrailers and Featurettes\n\nExternal Link\n\nBBC NEWS | Entertainment | Brosnan to narrate Thomas series"
