        "text": "Dr Heather Inwood says:\n\nOne of the best things about teaching Chinese Studies at Cambridge is the mix of students we get and the range of factors that have led them to pursue such a \"different\", challenging and endlessly fascinating subject. No matter how much they know before coming here, it is always a thrill to see students' thinking, ambitions and even self-identity move in new directions as they immerse themselves in the subjects we teach, be it classical and modern language, history of both the ancient and much more recent kinds, linguistics, anthropology or literature and culture.\n\nSee our flyer [PDF] and FAQs [PDF]\n\nIntroduction to Chinese at Cambridge\n\nMandarin Chinese is the most widely spoken language today by a very long way. It is spoken by around a billion people worldwide. So itâ€™s not surprising that many people are looking to learn this language as an important route into commerce, politics or international relations.\n\nHowever, the study of this great language opens up a much broader world and a rich cultural heritage.\n\nAt Cambridge, we teach\n\nextensive writing and spoken abilities in modern Chinese\n\na solid grounding in classical and literary Chinese\n\na critical understanding of the rich variety of Chinese culture\n\nPlease be aware that this course is intended for students who do not speak Chinese as their mother-tongue. We will consider applications from students who wish to learn Chinese from scratch as well as those who have studied Chinese at secondary school and / or sixth form college.\n\nYou can see some more details on the course and the individual papers on the pages for Current students and Offer holders under Chinese Studies Course Descriptions\n\nFor more information contact\n\nthe Undergraduate Programmes Administrator\n\nug_progadmin@ames.cam.ac.uk"
