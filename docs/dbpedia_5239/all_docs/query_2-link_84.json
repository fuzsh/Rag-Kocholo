You’ll learn a lot of vocabulary about life and the cultures of the six countries of origin. The only sous-titres (subtitles) available are in English, so it’s a great opportunity to practice your listening skills without the written support available.\n\nHow watching tv shows and movies can help your French\n\nImmersion is the best way to quickly learn a new language. So aside from using a program like Rosetta Stone that has tutors, Live Lessons, and visual cues for learning, you’ll want to read, watch, and listen to as much French as possible. That’s why watching French movies on Netflix helps you learn French faster—not to mention it’s fun!\n\nConnect what you see with what you hear\n\nFrench is notorious for its complicated orthographe (spelling), so what better way to match written French with spoken French than by watching an entertaining show while reading the subtitles? You can compare the pronunciation of endings of words, liaisons between words, and the general cadence of speech.\n\nNotice grammar structures in context\n\nLet’s say you’ve just studied the superlative in French. When you watch French movies and TV shows on Netflix, you can make mental note of the superlatives that you hear in context. You’ll soon notice that they match the structures of French grammar rules that you’ve learned. Lean in to your curiosity if you find any exceptions or confusion and rewatch parts of the show that were a little unclear the first time.\n\nLearn new vocabulary\n\nIf a picture is worth a thousand mots (words), a movie or tv show in French can offer even more visual support for learning new words from all French parts of speech. Switch the subtitles back to English and compare the translations of how ideas are expressed.\n\nControl the speed and repeat conversations\n\nHere’s a powerful trick that’s not as easy with in-person conversations. In your streaming settings, turn the audio speed down so you can comprehend better until you can listen confidently at full speed. Repeat the conversations as many times as you need. While you can ask a person to speak more slowly, there’s an advantage to slowing down the audio with subtitles.\n\nExperience different regional accents and dialects\n\nBy watching a variety of shows from different settings you can hear a wider range of accents and regional dialects, as well as the slang and casual speech of different generations.\n\nMovie and TV show vocabulary you’ll want to know\n\nMaster these words to discuss various movies and TV shows in French on Netflix or any other preferred streaming service like Apple TV, Amazon Prime, or Hulu.\n\nBonus: what to watch on Amazon Prime Video\n\nYou might want to check out a few other French films on Amazon Prime Video! These are available to rent or buy, but some are included in your subscription."
