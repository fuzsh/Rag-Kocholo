        "text": "Walter Niel Gunson, known Niel Gunson, was a pioneering historian of the Pacific who completed his PHD at the Australian National University in Professor Jim Davidson’s Department of Pacific History, 1955-1958. He was born and raised in Gippsland, Victoria. He was a Fellow in the Department of Pacific and Asian History, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, 1962-1993, and held a visiting fellowship after retiring in 1993.\n\nGunson is recognised for his ethnographic research in the history of Protestant missions to the Pacific Islands and Polynesia in the 19th century. His later research focused on genealogy and kinship studies in the Pacific. His other interests included European, Australian Indigenous and local history. He owned a large library and archive collection which he shared with others.\n\nGunson mentored at least 20 PHD scholars. The Journal of Pacific History created the Gunson Prize in 2012 for scholars researching Pacific history. He was a foundational member of The Journal of Pacific History, and in 1975 helped establish the journal Aboriginal History. He worked for the Pacific Manuscripts Bureau. He established the first Tongan history workshop at the ANU in 1987 which resulted in the formation of the Tongan History Association (currently the Tonga Research Association) in 1989.\n\nWallace Raymond ('Wal') Ambrose was born in Auckland, New Zealand in 1933. He began his education as an artist, at Seddon Technical College, followed by the Elam School of Art, at the time a part of Auckland University College, where he earned a Diploma of Fine Arts in 1953. He was awarded the Postgraduate Diploma of the Auckland Teachers College in 1955, for the art teachers' course.\n\nA chance encounter that year with members of the University Archaeological Society summer excavation season saw Wal begin what would become a lifelong interest in archaeology. During the following year, Wal continued his involvement with the Society, and in 1956, the Department of Anthropology hired him as photographer and cartographer.\n\nWal Ambrose became the organiser and site supervisor for all of Jack Golson's excavations during his time at the University of Auckland. He also participated in excavations with Roger Green and Wilfred Shawcross in New Zealand during between 1957 and 1963. He directed the departmental excavations at the Kauri Point site in 1961-1962. He conducted three seasons of salvage work recording rock art for New Zealand National Historic Places Trust.\n\nAmbrose also was a member and served in a variety of offices for the University Archaeological Society and the New Zealand Archaeological Association, including as editor of the quarterly NZAA newsletter. During this time Ambrose also earned his university degree at the University of Auckland, in anthropology and geology.\n\nIn 1963, he joined the then Department of Anthropology and Sociology in the Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National University as a Research Assistant where Jack Golson had recently accepted a position. Ambrose completed a Diploma of Archaeological Conservation at the London Institute of Archaeology in 1965. Ambrose was a pioneer in the field of archaeological conservation in Australia, writing many articles and manuals on the deterioration and conservation of materials, and playing a leading role in the establishment of the Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material. When the new department of Prehistory was established in the Research School at ANU, Wal Ambrose’s position was reclassified as Research Officer in Conservation and Experimental Archaeology in 1966. At the same time, realising the need to stabilise artifacts, the Department of Prehistory established a Conservation section, and remains the only archaeology department in Australia to maintain a dedicated conservator on staff. In 1970 he was seconded to the Anthropology Department of the University of Papua New Guinea. In 1982, his position at the Australian National University was that of Experimental Archaeologist, which would continue until his retirement in 1998, at which point he became a Visiting Fellow of the Department of Archaeology and Natural History.\n\nWal Ambrose was greatly involved in the ANU excavations at Kuk, led by Jack Golson, now a UNESCO World Heritage site for establishing the independent development of agriculture in Papua New Guinea. Ambrose created methods for freeze drying the wooden artifacts being excavated from the Kuk swamp, a process that was successful in maintaining the original form of the artifacts, including marks of manufacture and use. His revolutionary treatment has now been widely adopted and recognised by the Cellulose, Paper and Textile Division of the American Chemicals Society and the Archaeological Materials Working Group of the International Council of Museums. Ambrose also developed and patented his invention for a temperature and relative humidity monitoring device for long-term soil monitoring, which was used to a great extent at Kuk and on many ANU-led excavations throughout the region, and humorously and fondly known throughout the department as “Wall’s balls” for their spherical shape.\n\nAmbrose’s experiments with freeze drying technology led to expeditions to Antarctica, to test freeze drying without a vacuum chamber in dry, cold conditions. Ambrose’s venturi system, which allowed for air suction, was proved a success and was later patented. His findings have led to different approaches to the conservation of Antarctic heritage buildings. Ambrose patented his invention for a temperature and relative humidity monitoring device, which was\n\nAmbrose also contributed greatly to obsidian studies. He amassed a large collection of obsidian samples, which were then tested using emission spectography. Ambrose collaborated with scientists from the Australian Atomic Energy Commission to develop PIXE/PIGME analytical system to differentiate the composition and original location of the obsidian samples. The PIXE/PIGME system became standard for obsidian study, and Wal Ambrose’s collected obsidian samples became a reference file for the composition of Pacific obsidians based on that system. Ambrose was also at the forefront of obsidian dating, especially in hydration dating.\n\nWal Ambrose was involved in many excavations during his long career at the Australian National University including: Northern Territory (1963); Dorset (University of London, 1964-1965); various locations in the Papua New Guinea Highlands, including Kuk (1966, 1968); Kauri Point, NZ (1967); Anir Island, New Ireland, PNG (1970-1971); Kuk, PNG (1972); survey of all known obsidian source sites in Papua New Guinea (1974); Admiralty Islands (1977), Lou and Hus Island, Admiralty Island (1978); Lou, Baluan, and Manus, Admiralty Islands (1981); Manus, New Ireland, New Britain (1984); Lou Island, Manus and Boduna Island, Talasea (1985); Baluan Island, Manus, and Schouten Islands (1987); Pamwak rockshelter, Manus Island (1989, 1990); Antarctica, experimental freeze-drying project (1990/1991); Assessment of historic building preservation at Wilkes Station Antarctica (1994).\n\nAfter retiring as Experimental Archaeologist with the Australian National University department of Prehistory, Wal Ambrose became a visiting fellow of the new Archaeology and Natural History department, and later pursued his PhD. His Doctor of Letters was awarded by the Australian National University in 2006. Wal Ambrose died in January 2024.\n\nElspeth Young was a geographer who spent many years studying Indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea, focusing on land management issues facing Indigenous peoples.\n\nShe graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1963, with MA (Honours) in Geography, with her thesis: Glenelg: a study of the developments in the economy of a West Highland District. After completing a Diploma of Education she taught geography and mathematics for a number of years in the UK and later in Trinidad. She returned to the UK to a position lecturing in economic geography at the Edinburgh College of Commerce in 1969. In 1971, she was appointed a Research Assistant and Tutor in the Geography Department of the University of Papua New Guinea. At the University of Papua New Guinea, she also pursued an additional degree, earning a MA for her thesis: Population Mobility in the Kainantu Area. Under the direction of Gerard Ward and Diana Howlett, she pursued her PhD at the Australian National University, which was awarded for her thesis: Simbu and New Ireland Migration (1977). In 1978, she switched her focus from PNG to Australia and began a study of Willowra station, north of Alice Springs. She became the first geographer to have worked on Northern Territory Land Claims, contributing to the successful claims to Ti Tree and Mt Allen (1980–85). Elspeth Young became a Research Fellow in Demography, ANU, (1980–1981) and Senior Research Fellow (1982–1985) in the North Australia Research Unit of the ANU. In 1985, she joined the Department of Geography and Oceanography at University College, University of New South Wales, Australian Defense Force Academy (1985-1994), where she would become an associate professor. In 1994 Elspeth returned to the ANU as Director of the Graduate Studies in Environmental Management and Development program. She stepped down from the position in 1999 and became a Reader at the program. She died in the UK in 2002. She made a bequest to the ANU in the form of the Elspeth Young Memorial Grant (https://study.anu.edu.au/scholarships/find-scholarship/elspeth-young-memorial-grant), supporting Indigenous Australian undergraduate and graduate students at the Australian National University.\n\nKondelea (Della) Xenodohos (later known as Della Elliott) was born in Melbourne in 1917. After leaving school at the age of 14, she graduated from business college as a typist but found it difficult to gain regular paid work. She worked for a while with the International Labour Defence before gaining paid work with the Friends of the Soviet Union and the Militant Minority Movement.\n\nIn the 1940s Della was a delegate to the Labour Council of NSW and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and passionately pursued the issue of equal pay for women. This included working as a member of the Australian Women's Charter Committee alongside feminist activist Jessie Street.\n\nDella and Laurie divorced in 1945 and she began working for the Waterside Workers Federation (WWF). Here she met Seaman's Union of Australia (SUA) leader Eliot V. Elliott. They were partners for the rest of their lives, eventually marrying in 1982.\n\nDella began work at the SUA in 1955 as an administrator in the federal office, keeping meticulous records and facilitating a number of industrial campaigns, as well as editing the Seamen's Journal. Della eventually retired from the SUA in 1988, four years after Eliot's death.\n\nDella was a strong supporter of the League for Democracy in Greece and the Union of Australian Women. She was also passionate about Indigenous issues and founded a scholarship at the University of Sydney for female Indigenous students.\n\nDella Elliott died in Sydney on 2 October 2011 at the age of 94.\n\nEliot Valens Elliott was born Victor Emmanuel Elliott in New Zealand in 1902. He joined the Federated Seamen’s Union of Australasia (FSUA), later the Seamen’s Union of Australia (SUA) at the age of 17 and worked stoking boilers. He quickly earned a reputation as a tough delegate focused on campaigning for better working conditions. Elliott came to prominence during the 1935 seamen’s dispute as Assistant-Secretary of the Sydney strike committee and was elected Queensland Branch Secretary of the FSUA. By late 1924 his sailing records showed a change of name to Eliot V Elliott.\n\nHe became General Secretary of the FSUA in 1941 and in 1942 served as the seamen’s representative to the Maritime Industry Commission. He was also active in the international labour movement, sponsoring union recruitment and organisation among Australian and visiting seamen and promoting collective action by Chinese, Greek and Indonesian seamen. Although he led the SUA in their opposition to the Korean and Vietnam Wars, he generally relied on negotiation skills rather than engaging in costly strike action. He was a fierce opponent and defended the rights of SUA members in bitter battles with BHP and the Utah Development Co.\n\nIn 1949 Elliott joined the CPA’s central committee and was appointed vice-president of the maritime section of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), which had strong backing from the USSR. Although the Australian Council of Trade Unions withdrew from the WFTU that same year, the SUA didn’t disaffiliate until September 1952. Elliott maintained a long-term pro-Moscow view, which contributed to his removal from the central committee of the CPA in 1969, and him joining the new Socialist Party of Australia in 1971.\n\nElliott's long-time partner was prominent trade unionist and activist Kondelea Xenedohos (more commonly known as Della Elliott), whom he met while both were working for the WWF.\n\nAfter 37 years as General Secretary, he retired from the SUA in 1978. He died in Sydney on 26 November 1984, survived by Della and his son.\n\nJoan Marjorie Rochester was born in Victoria in 1931. She married Cedric Coxsedge in 1953 and had two sons and a daughter.\n\nShe became a professional artist in the 1960s and held four exhibitions of pen and wash drawings of historic buildings as well as undertaking a commission for the Builders' Labourers' Federation drawing Green Bans buildings around Australia in 1975.\n\nAs well as being an accomplished artist, Joan was a committed activist and politician. As a member of the Save Our Sons Movement which opposed conscription for the Vietnam War, she went to jail in 1971 for anti-conscription activities. She campaigned against the Croatian terrorist movement Ustashi in the early 1970s, opposed secret service organisations and was founding Chairman of the Committee for the Abolition of Political Police in 1973.\n\nA member of the Australian Labor Party from 1967, Coxsedge contested unsuccessfully the Legislative Assembly seat of Balwyn in 1973 and stood for pre-selection in Richmond in 1976 against the Leader of the Opposition, Clyde Holding. She eventually became the first Labor woman to be elected to the Victorian Legislative Council as the Member for Melbourne West Province in July 1979 and served until 1992. While in office she wrote and produced the newsletter Hard Facts for Hard Times from her Footscray office, in which she offered a left view of current local, national and international events.\n\nCoxsedge was involved with a large number of community groups and projects. She served as a Board Member of the Footscray Community Arts Centre (1980-98) and Chair of Board (1990-93); Board Member of West Theatre (1989-90) and Chair of End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism (1993-98).\n\nJames Patrick Sinclair was born in Dubbo NSW on 18 April 1928. He attended Dubbo High School, Sydney Grammar School and the Australian School of Pacific Administration (ASOPA) in Sydney. In November 1947, he Joined the Department of District Services and Native Affairs, Administration of Papua New Guinea. After attending an orientation course at the Australian School of Pacific Administration he proceeded to Papua New Guinea in August 1948 as a cadet patrol officer. He also attended the No 4 Long Course at ASOPA in 1953 - 1954. From 1948 to 1975 he served successively on many stations as a patrol officer, assistant district officer, deputy district commissioner and district commissioner. He was the last Australian District Commissioner of the Eastern Highlands District, 1969-1974.\n\nDuring his service James Sinclair conducted extensive exploratory and pacification patrols in Morobe and Southern Highlands Districts. He opened the station of Koroba in 1955, Lake Kopiago base camp in 1956 and explored the then Uncontrolled area to the Strickland River until late 1958. He married Janece Marie McGrath in January 1959 and had three children. He subsequently served in charge of the Wau, Finschhafen and Lae Sub-Districts before moving to the Eastern Highlands in 1968.\n\nJames Sinclair retired in August 1975 following Independence in Papua New Guinea. He returned to his previous hobby of writing on Papua New Guinea history, which became a full-time occupation and he has since published more than 30 books. His first book, ‘Behind the Ranges’¸ was published in 1966 and told of his exploratory work in Morobe and the Southern Highlands. In 2013, several publications edited by James Sinclair were ready for publication, including publications about Peter Fox, A Lloyd Hurrell and John Middleton. Jim died on 9 October 2017.\n\nHonours: James Sinclair has been awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992; the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Letters from the Australian National University in 1999; and a Companion, Order of the Star of Melanesia (PNG) in 2008.\n\nThe Australian Agricultural Company (AACo or The Company) was formed in London in April 1824. Its purpose was to raise fine woolled sheep and sell wool on the London market. The formation of the Company was supported by an Act of Parliament and a Royal Charter. Its directors and major shareholders included directors of the Bank of England, the East India Company and Members of Parliament; with assigned convicts given the roles of shepherding and general labour. The Company’s initial land grant was one million acres in New South Wales plus two thousand acres in Newcastle. After some uncertainty the land, in the colony, was in three blocks: 464,640 acres between Port Stephens and the Manning River (Port Stephens Estate), 249,600 acres on the Liverpool Plains west of Willow Tree (Warrah) and 313,298 acres at the Peel River south of Tamworth (Goonoo Goonoo). The AACo operated in four major NSW locations during the nineteenth century – Port Stephens, Tamworth, Quirindi, and Newcastle – and from the last quarter of the century also in Queensland and eventually in Northern Australia. Its interests expanded to include wool, wheat, cattle, coal and land sales.\n\nWithin a year of its formation the AACo also became involved in coal mining at Newcastle, taking over the government’s operations there. After protracted negotiations the Company’s first pit was opened in 1831.The discovery of gold in New South Wales on the Company’s Peel Estate led to the formation of the Peel River Land and Mineral Company in 1854. Between 1825 and 1862 the AACo, with the Peel River Land and Mineral Company, brought from Europe to New South Wales over 700 men to work either at the colliery in Newcastle or on the extensive pastoral estates at Port Stephens, Tamworth and the Liverpool Plains. The new arrivals were managers, skilled mechanics, shepherds, miners and labourers. The first group of employees was managed by the Company’s first Agent, Robert Dawson (Agent, 1824-1828). Dawson’s successors included Sir Edward Parry (Commissioner, 1830-1834); Henry Dumaresq (Commissioner, 1834-1838); Phillip Parker King (Commissioner, 1839-1849); followed by several General Superintendents with Jesse Gregson, the Company’s longest serving General Superintendent from 1875-1905.\n\nIn 1864 the AACo began the development of the Warrah Estate for sheep breeding, investing extensively in wells, bores and fencing. The AACo purchased Corona (near Longreach) in 1912; Bladensburg (near Winton) and Highfields (between Corona and Bladensburg) in 1915; Headingly (Urandangie) in 1916; before moving into the Northern Territory with the purchased of Avon Downs (Barkly Tablelands) in 1921. From the 1930s gradually phasing out sheep the AACo became increasingly involved in beef cattle, developing the Santa Gertrudis stud at Goonoo Goonoo and purchasing Rockhampton Downs (Barkley Tablelands NT) in 1948, Wrotham Park (near Chillagoe, Q) in 1963, Brunette Downs (north of Tennant Creek) in 1979.\n\nIn 1975 the London-based directors resigned and the Company’s tax domicile was transferred from London to Tamworth, NSW and then to Brisbane in 1985 following the sale of Goonoo Goonoo. From 1976 the Company’s name was listed on the Australian Stock Exchange as the Australian Agricultural Company Limited. In 1995 Elders Ltd acquired the AACo and it was delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange. The Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Futuris Corporation Limited after Futuris took over Elders in 1997. The Company was re-listed in 2001.\n\nDr Roy Scragg was the Director of Public Health for the Australian Administration of the (then) Territory of Papua New Guinea from 1957 to 1970. He also served in the PNG Parliament as a member of the Legislative Council and Executive Council PNG and as Member, House of Assembly and Constitutional Committee from 1957 to 1968. Dr Scragg had a large impact on the development of the public health program in Papua New Guinea, and undertook pioneering research into infertility.\n\nRoy Scragg was born in Feilding, New Zealand, later moving to South Australia where he obtained his medical degree from Adelaide University in 1946. He then joined the Department of Public Health for the Australian Administration of the (then) Territory of Papua New Guinea. Dr Scragg obtained a Diploma in Tropical Medicine and Hygiene from the Sydney School of Public Health in 1950, shortly before he began his ground-breaking research into infertility in New Ireland. He discovered the role of gonorrhoea in infertility in New Ireland, which had led to a decline in population. Twenty years later, in 1975, the WHO commented that the “most complete epidemiological study on the prevalence of infertility, pregnancy wastage, and child loss is that by Scragg on New Ireland in the West Pacific.” He received a Doctorate in Medicine from Adelaide University in 1955 for his thesis on the depopulation of New Ireland.\n\nIn 1957, Dr Roy Scragg was appointed the Director of Public Health for the Australian Administration of the (then) Territory of Papua New Guinea from 1957. He succeeded Sir John Gunther in the post. He ensured that the country was covered with a network of aid posts and health services, even in remote regions, to control the major diseases and causes of death. During his time as Director of Public Health, the crude death rate (per UN estimates) in PNG declined from 27.4/1000 to 16.5/1000.\n\nDr Scragg promoted the training of PNG nationals as doctors, nurses, and medical personnel, paving the way for independence. Although he had to send PNG nationals to Fiji for medical training, Dr Scragg was an active participant in the establishment of health science education in PNG and the establishment of the Medical School within the University of PNG.\n\nOn his return to Australia, Dr Scragg continued contributing to scholarship and public life. He served as a fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Medical Administrators, president of the Public Health Association of Australia and life member of the Australasian Epidemiological Association, among other positions. In 1971 Scragg was recognised as an officer of the Order of the British Empire and in 2021 he was appointed a member of the Order of Australia (AM) to mark his significant contributions to medicine, epidemiology and medical associations. He earned a master of public health in 1982 from the Sydney School of Public Health and was made an honorary doctor of Adelaide University in 2014. Dr Roy Scragg died in 2022.\n\nThe Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies was established in 1948 as the Research School of Pacific Studies, changing its name in 1994. It is Australia’s pre-eminent centre for research and postgraduate training in the Asia-Pacific region, with one of the largest concentrations of expertise in the world. Priority areas for research are Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and the Southwest Pacific. Research is multidisciplinary and is focused on anthropology, archaeology, economics, history, human geography, international relations, linguistics, political science, resource management and strategic defence studies. In 1947 New Zealander Raymond Firth, an anthropologist who had published widely on the Pacific and Southeast Asian region, was invited by the Interim University Council to act as the Academic Advisor for Pacific Studies with the hope that he would take on the job as Foundation Professor. Firth’s initial plans for the School of Pacific Studies were that it would have an emphasis on human studies and be concerned mainly with the Pacific Island territories for which Australia was responsible. In contrast to this, proposals put forward by Sir Frederick Eggleston to the Academic Advisory Committee, before Firth’s appointment, called for a school that was to also have an Asian focus and concentrate on political problems in the Pacific. In 1949 Firth resigned from the Academic Advisory Committee, deciding not to make the move permanently to Australia from England, giving Eggleston the opportunity to substitute a broader scope for the School including India, Southeast Asia, China and Japan. In mid-1949 Firth was persuaded to resume his role as Academic Advisor and made the initial appointments of chairs to Siegfried Frederick Nadel (Anthropology and Sociology), Walter Russell Crocker (International Relations), James Davidson (Pacific History), and Oskar Spate (Geography) and the appointments of Readers W.E.H. Stanner (Comparative Social Institutions) and C.P. Fitzgerald (Far Eastern History). Further departments were added: Economics (1960), Linguistics (1968), Prehistory (1969), and the New Guinea Research Unit (1961). The Geography Department reformed as two departments in 1968: Biogeography and Geomorphology, and Human Geography. Its name was changed to the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies in 1994, to reflect the balance of research activity in the School which had shifted significantly from the Pacific towards Asia.\n\nProfessor Arthur Burns was a Professor of Political Science, specialising in superpower rivalry, nuclear weapons and game theory. Born in Summer Hill, Sydney on 24 March 1922 to Crayton and Denise Burns, Arthur Burns was educated at Scotch College, before studying history, theology and philosophy at the University of Melbourne. In 1946 he was awarded a Masters in Philosophy and History for his thesis on Historical Explanation. In the same year Burns married Netta Cox, and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister. In 1947 to 1948 he attended the London School of Economics under a British Council Scholarship. On returning to Melbourne, Burns tutored and lectured in Church History at Ormond College Theological Hall, and in History at the University of Melbourne. He was appointed Research Fellow in International Relations within the Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National University in 1955. In 1961 Burns transferred to the Department of Political Science, Research School of Social Sciences, where he oversaw a Defence Studies Project 1963 – 1966, which was managed by the department on behalf of the Australian Institute of International Affairs. Burns was appointed to second Chair in the Department in 1966. He undertook international posts at a variety of institutions including the Universities of Princeton and Chicago, and the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies. Burns published prolifically in the 1950s and 1960s, with his major works being From Balance to Deterrence (1956), and Of powers and their politics: a critique of theoretical approaches (1968). Burns was involved in litigation with the ANU 1981 to 1994 after his employment was terminated. He was an independent candidate for the Australian Capital Territory Assembly in 1995 as part of the Abolish Self Government Coalition, but died five days before the election.\n\nDr John Baker holds a BA degree with First Class Honours from Hull University, an MA from London University and a PhD from the Australian National University. His academic and business interests include public management and the economic development of countries in South East Asia and the South Pacific. In his early career (1964 - 1965) he worked in the Solomon Islands under the Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) scheme.\n\nJohn Baker was an economist to the Government of Tonga from August 1969 to May 1970, the first economist employed by the Tonga Government to work on development planning. He was engaged to undertake the preparation and drafting of the Tonga Development Plan 1970-75, Tonga's second development plan. Following his work in Tonga, Dr Baker studied at the ANU where he completed a PhD on shipping in Tonga and Fiji.\n\nIn 1975 he joined AIDAB, Australian Agency for International Development (the predecessor of AusAID) where he was Head of the South Pacific Section. He occupied a number of other senior government positions in Canberra including positions in the Corporate Services Division of the Department of Primary Industry, the Departments of Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs. He was the Australian Ambassador to Madagascar and the Comoros from 1982 to 1984.\n\nDuring the late 1980s he was First Assistant Commissioner of the newly-created Public Service Commission (PSC) and played a leading role in the development of various APS management reforms, which produced APS 2000, a major report on the future development of the Australian Public Service (APS). In his subsequent career, Dr Baker was Australian High Commissioner to Tanzania.\n\nIn 1991, John Baker established his own Canberra based consultancy company, the Centre for Public Management Pty Ltd (CPM) and the Executive Director. John Baker is a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Management.\n\nProfessor Harold Brookfield was a British and Australian geographer with interests in rural development, family farming, land use and society in developing countries. He completed a BA and PhD at the London School of Economics. He was briefly a lecturer in Geography and Birkbeck College, London and Lecturer in Charge at the Department of Geography, University of Natal where he began engaging with development and social justice issues in South Africa and Mauritius. After three years, he moved to Australia to join the University of New England and in 1957 joined the Research School of Pacific Studies at the Australian National University where he spent most of his academic career. He spent two periods at the Geography (later Human Geography) Department in RSPAS – the first from 1957 to 1969, and then again from 1982 until his retirement in 1991, at one point becoming the Head of the Human Geography Department and Acting Director of the School.\n\nBrookfield conducted field work in Papua New Guinea, the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville and the Philippines. His interests focussed on Papua New Guinea where he conducted fieldwork in the highlands and collaborated with anthropologists from the Research School. In the 1970s his work extended to smaller islands of the Caribbean and the smaller eastern islands of Fiji. His work largely focused on the relationship between humans and their landscapes, particularly as this was understood through the lens of agricultural production. His work on agricultural intensification, land use and land degradation, and the impact of El Nino events was ground-breaking and innovative.\n\nThe Australian Mutual Provident Society was formed in 1849 as a non-profit, life-insurance company, and mutual society, with its first office located in Sydney.\n\nGeorge King was chairman for fifteen years from the 1850s. Richard Teece was general manager and actuary from 1890 and a director from 1917 to 1927.\n\nAs the company grew, offices were opened across Australia including in Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and Darwin as well as regional centres such as Newcastle, Goulburn, Bendigo, Warrnambool, Maryborough, Townsville and Rockhampton.\n\nIn 1876, the company expanded to New Zealand and opened its first office in Wellington.
