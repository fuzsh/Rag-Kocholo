Over their 150+ years developing smart engineering it became evident there is much to be retained and shared and with clients and employees alike. Hybrid developed a series of compelling insights showcasing key landmarks of ‘smart engineering for extreme environments’.\n\nThese included a comprehensive online history, printed collateral for new employees and a celebratory book. An online version of the book was created using parallax scrolling."
