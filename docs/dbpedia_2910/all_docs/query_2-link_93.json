        "text": "MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio — Parker Hannifin has completed its acquisition of Meggitt PLC, an aerospace and defense company based in the United Kingdom.\n\nParker, which is headquartered in Mayfield Heights, announced the closing of the sale on Tuesday, about a year after announcing an agreement to buy Meggitt. Parker will pay about 6.3 billion euros, around $6.5 billion, based on Tuesday’s exchange rates.\n\nMeggitt employs 9,000 people globally and had 1.63 billion euros in annual revenue. It will become part of Parker’s aerospace group. Parker was already doing business in the U.K., employing about 2,100 people in the country.\n\n“We are excited to have reached the closing of what is a very compelling strategic and cultural combination,” said Tom Williams, Parker’s chairman and CEO.\n\nParker and Meggitt first announced the acquisition in August 2021. The U.K. had to approve the deal, and as part of getting that approval, Parker agreed to sell its aircraft wheel and brake division on Center Road in Avon.\n\nThe U.K. government approved the sale in July.\n\nRoger Sherrard, president of Parker’s aerospace group, said Parker has great respect for Meggitt and its place in British industry, and is committed to being a responsible steward of Meggitt\n\n“The combination of Parker and Meggitt is exciting for both companies and provides our customers with a broad array of solutions for the global aerospace industry,” Sherrard said in a press release. “We welcome the Meggitt team to the Parker Aerospace Group. Our joint integration team will work collaboratively to ensure a seamless transition for customers, distributors and suppliers.”\n\nParker made a few agreements when buying Meggitt, including keeping its headquarters at its current location in Coventry, England for five years. It also agreed to maintain a certain headcount in the U.K., sticking to Meggitt’s sustainability targets and honoring contracts with the U.K. government.\n\nParker is a leader in motion and control technologies, and has operations in 50 countries and more than 300 manufacturing locations. It employs 58,000 people."
