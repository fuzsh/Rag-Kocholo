        "text": "Hi\n\nTimelines covering the period Gallipoli campaign to March 1917 for Asturias, Galeka & Glenart Castle. Below a few observations for each ship arising from the files.\n\n*****\n\nH.M.H.S. “Asturias”\n\nIt appears the nurses were unpaid for two months following the torpedoing – Lilian Montague’s proud father took on the role of advocate for the surviving nurses with a flurry of letters to sort that out. Here’s an extract from another Mr W T Montague letter, an account of Asturias being mined off Salcombe (WO 399/5912):\n\nTo Miss Beecher, Matron in Chief, Q.A.I.M.N.S.\n\nI hope you will pardon one for writing to you and also a fathers pride, but I have looked to see if any notice would be taken of the splendid conduct of the nurses who were on the torpedoed Hospital Ships. I have seen and talked with several of them who were on the good ship Asturias when the G’s tried to sink that vessel.\n\nHow when the ship was struck in the darkness of the night, at a moments notice, with no panic they were all ready, each one at their allotted boat; quietly waiting orders, how when they were lowered onto the water they sung and called to each other “are you all right”, how some of them helped row the boats to land, how when they found some of the crew who were injured, collapsing, they succoured them, parting with some of their clothes to men who were scantily clad…. These stories are only told round their own fireside but they should? one wills, admiration for these splendid women….\n\nWithin several files e.g. WO 399/2334there is a list of nurses Ex Hospital Ship “Asturias”, whofollowing the torpedoing were being posted to France. Matron Elizabeth Ann Dowseon the list, but after reading her file I thinkeither clerical error had been made, mixing up the sinking of the Britannic with the Asturias,(as far as I can tell she was on sick leave during March 1917)or she may have been pencilled in for the role of Matron on Asturias, but circumstances prevented her from fulfilling the posting.\n\n*****\n\nH.M.H.S. “Galeka”\n\nTaken a punt on the Dowager Countess of Carnarvon four nurses. Florence Borrett is confirmed as on board Galeka. Park, Duckett & Evans are my best guess for the other three B.R.C. nurses as they all worked for the Trained Nurses’ Economic League & appeared in the same photo but I have no further evidence.\n\nThe photo & more info on Florence Borrett: https://www.greatwarforum.org/topic/50770-florence-adeline-borrett-brcsosjj-raf-matron-ncaa/\n\nNames of other Dowager Countess of Carnarvon B.R.C. nurses whose records, if available, may hold clues.\n\nMIC’s found for:\n\nCharlotte KEANE\n\nCelia PEARSON\n\nMargaret ROBERTS\n\nEdith C SMART\n\nNellie TAYLOR-MORLEY (Mrs PEPPER)\n\nEdith JOHN (Mrs EDWARDS)\n\nAlice B LEWIS-EDWARDS\n\nMary I LITTLE\n\nGrace J O MACLEAN\n\nElsie SHARPE (Mrs LAWLEY) [listed as E SHARP]\n\nGertrude CONOLLY\n\nH BLAND [listed as K BLAND]\n\nM COPINGER see HARVEY\n\nK B JONES [listed as D JONES]\n\nM MacCALL\n\nCannot find MIC’s for:\n\nJ BRYAN\n\nM BUXTON\n\nK COLDWELL\n\nA HOLMES\n\n(there is one other nurse in this party – her name unknown)\n\nPhoto HMHS Galeka half submerged: https://wellcomecollection.org/works/k87jpa7p/items?canvas=11\n\nA void for nurses present on Galeka at the sinking in Oct 1916 –any names known?\n\n*****\n\nH.M.H.S. “Glenart Castle”\n\nWhen reading the War Diary (WO-95-4145-2) for Glenart Castle all appears ship shape.\n\nI.M.S. Lieutenant Colonel, A. William Dawson, was given the role of O/C on 26th October 1914 as his ‘establishment’ hadn’t yet arrived from India and Matron Frances Reddock was posted to the ship on the 23rd August 1915. The Glenart Castle sailed from Southampton to Alexandria and arrived at Sulva Bay on the 13th September.\n\nMatron Frances Reddock’s file WO 399/6903 contains a hand written four page report to Miss Becher (Matron-inChief Q.A.I.M.N.S.) written by BeatriceIJones?(Icannot decipher all the textof the report– perhaps someone can).\n\nAt some point the relationship between Dawson and Reddock broke down. The nurses became divided with four ‘under her wing’ the rest with Dawson, and ‘there has been nothing but friction and trouble’. The two sides hardly spoke to each other. The next problem came at Bombay where the nursing staff disembarked Glenart Castle. They had no posting until the conversion of HMHS Varsova was completed, which left the nurses sitting in the bar of the Taj Mahal Hotel, drinking and smoking. Apparently Matron Reddock ignored the nurses and did nothing to enforce any discipline. Matron Reddock was blamed for all the problems and her engagement was terminated from 28th September 1916. She died on 17 June 1919 (being no longer in service, the cause is unknown).\n\nI hadn’t expected issues like this on a hospital ship. On Matron Reddock's application form her last role was nursing sister with Q.A.I.M.N.S. in India from 1905 to 1913. Had there been any previous ‘history’ between her and I.M.S. Lieutenant Colonel, A. William Dawson?\n\nI first came across the Matron of Glenart Castle mentioned in South Coast Times & Wollongong Argus,14 January 1916 as 'Ruddock'. An excerpt of a letter written by her on 28 November 1915 in which she is relating to the mother of Pte. Frederick Warren Muir that the medical staff did all they could for her injured son.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/141649454?searchTerm=matron ruddock\n\nNurse Alice Flintoff WO 399/6903 is mentioned quite often in the report, she had been posted to 3rd London G.H., caught influenza and died on 9th November 1918. She also suffered from a condition attributed to infection caught on active service in India & Mespot.(commemorated by CWGC)\n\nAny additions / corrections wellcome – unfortunately the web BRC/VAD database has been ‘down for maintenance’ for quite a while so Ihaven’t been able tocheck details for the voluntary nurses.\n\nRegards ZeZe\n\nEdited 30 September , 2022 by ZeZe\n\nZeZe,\n\nI have managed to transcribe most of the 4 page letter you mentioned in a previous post. It makes for interesting reading, although Miss Jones' writig and grammar are not the best I have seen.\n\nBASRA\n\n20.7.16\n\nDear Miss Becher,\n\nAt last I have seen Mrs Reddoch but I have got little or no satisfaction from her, as her statements are so very different from what I have already heard, but I consider that she is entirely to blame.\n\nThe trouble has all arisen from her mis-understanding the position of a matron in our Service. She was appointed to the Glenart Castle not knowing, or asking for any of our rules & regulations & instead of working well with her O.C. & consulting him in all matters relating to the working of the Hospital Ship, she tried to assert her authority over questions which which {sic} did not concern her duties. Naturally this put up the back of all the M.O.’s on board & the nurse {sic} [perhaps she meant to say ‘nursing staff’] became divided against itself. She with four nurses under her wing & Col. Dawson with the other four & from that day to this there has been nothing but friction and trouble.\n\nIn February the Glenart Castle was dismantled & the nursing Staff were put in the Taj Mahal Hotel Bombay to wait until the “Varsova” was being converted into a Hospital Ship.\n\nDuring the whole time she was there she absolutely ignored the four nurses she reports upon. Instead of arranging for a table for herself & her whole staff she allowed them to sit by themselves & she hardly ever spoke to them. They were allowed to lunch and order drinks in the lounge & public sitting rooms of the hotel & to go about anytime of the day with men they picked up in the hotel.\n\nI heard that a Court of Enquiry which lasted for three whole days had taken place The reason of the inquiry or its results I could not find out. As I was told that it was confidential & that Mrs Reddoch was the only one who could tell me the reasons, or show me the proceedings. When I asked her about the it all that she knows was that a notice was sent to her to attend the A.D.M.S.’s office at a certain date & hour, but no reasons were given. The questions asked all related to matters which had arisen from the time of her appointment on the Glenart Castle. She never heard the result of the enquiry. In the meanwhile she applied to Simla for herself & four nurses to be transferred to Mesopotamia. Consent was given & they were sent direct to Amara at the beginning of May. [They arrived 15th May – WO95/5017/1]. The four undesirable & giddy[?] nurses were left at the Taj Hotel Bombay without anyone to supervise or look after them.\n\nWhen the “Varsova” was completed Miss Flintoff, with the other three nurses & two Eurasians were appointed as the nursing staff Miss Flintoff took charge. I had the opportunity when I was in Bombay of going over the Varsova & seeing both Miss Flintoff & Col. Dawson. He told me he was very satisfied with his nursing staff & asked me not to move them. But I told him they would have to be moved as they had completed their six months Hospital Ship duty, and I would wait until I got properly settled & was able to pick out a good staff for him. I had not then received your letter nor did know that Miss Flintoff was one of Mrs Reddoch’s staff.\n\nSince Mrs Reddoch has been at Amara she has been Home Sister at No 2 British Gen. Hospital. {late Rawal Pindi from France} She is good friends with Miss Watt the Lady Supt.\n\nI believe that she has done very good work there, but unfortunately when Miss Murphy Act. Matron, Q.A.I.M.N. S. with 30 nurses of No 32 General Hospital arrived on the scene there has been just nothing but friction & quarrels & discontent all round.\n\nSo far as I can see there will never be any peace as long as Mrs Reddoch is in the Service & I would suggest that when her years contract expires which does on the 23rd of August it is not renewed & that she may be recalled to England by wire at an early date.\n\nI wanted to bring her down here as soon as possible so that she will be strictly under my supervision, & to prevent any more friction at Amara.\n\nMiss Waterhouse refused to take her back on the Reserve of the Indian Service on account of the friction she always causes whatever station she was sent to.\n\nShe denies leaving the nurses & going off with her husband, but she told me that she and her favourite went for a short tour up country. The “Varsova” arrives here about October 20th. I will deal with Miss Huulyt[?] then. I am afraid this is a very lengthy letter, but I could not put the whole case with fewer words.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBeatrice I.

WO/399/8258\n\nStaff Nurse Charlotte Maud BOTTOMLEY – QAIMNSR – service record states she was posted to Glenart Castle, 22/12/15. {Was originally to be posted the Galeka, but this was scored out on her record}. WO/399/779\n\nIt would seem from the above that although Miss Jones only referred to 4 nurses, Mrs Riddoch was still responsible for her original 8 nurses. It would seem that the Taj Mahal nurses were those who had sided with Colonel Dawson. The other 4 are not mentioned in the letter, so presumably were looked after. The 4 nurses with Mrs Riddoch at Amara must be those who were under her control on Glenart Castle. She even took one of them on a tour up country.\n\nI agree with you that the matron’s surname should be REDDOCH, but it is understandable how mistakes have been made in the records. It is very easy to confuse ‘H’ with ‘K’, depending on the handwriting, and the same goes for ‘I’ and ‘E’.\n\nAccording to the extract from her Probate of Will {1920} her surname was REDDOCH. Incidentally, she left an estate worth £15,940.5s.5d., so certainly didn’t have to work as a nurse.\n\nRegards,\n\nAlf McM\n\nEdited 3 October , 2022 by alf mcm\n\nZeZe,\n\nShown below are excerpts from the war diaries of Maud McCarthy, Matron-in-Chief, B.E.F.

Said she had given instructions that the present Matron, Miss Keene and two Staff Nurses, Francis and Maggitt, [Probably Rose or Ruth Meggitt] should remain on shore and asked for reports on their work. As the Asturias had left, I asked that Miss Cowie, who was waiting at Headquarters, should go at once to Boulogne, and proceed to Southampton with as little delay as possible and that the War Office should be informed of what arrangements had been made.\n\n22.02.17\n\nAbbeville\n\nTermination of Engagement: War Office letter received terminating the engagement of Staff Nurse N.

Not updated correctly - A/Matron Ethel Julia Marion Keene is identified but her nurse record file doesn't appear to have survived.\n\nOne “Asturias” survivor who had an eventful war was Q.A.I.M.N.S.R. Staff Nurse Ida Blanche LEEDAM. I’m glad I’ve tracked down her interesting service history, she is listed as ‘LEEDHAM’ in a letter and her TNA file is under ‘LEEHAM’ (no MIC?)\n\nIda completed her application form on 24th August 1914 giving her DoB as 5th October 1883. (she appears to have taken six years off her age – Freebmd result for birth registration is 4th qtr 1877).\n\nStraight away Ida asked to serve abroad,and again in November 1914 she writes from the Military Hospital, Sheerness saying she was ‘very happy there’ but would prefer to be serving at the Front.\n\nHer first posting abroad was on 12th May 1915 to No1 General Hospital, Etretat where she served for a year until transferring to H.M.H.S. Asturias in May 1916. Ida suffered a bout of ptomaine poisoning (food poisoning) in September but had recovered by 15thNovember to be posted back on board Asturiasand survived the torpedoing of the ship on the 21st March 1917.\n\nIda was granted four weeks leaveafter the tragedy, but by 20th April Ida was keen to get back into the action, she writes ‘I am in perfect health, and have all my things(holdall, kit-bag & trunk) from the H.M.H.S. Asturias. I am quite ready for “Sea-duty” again if required. But if at anytime there should be a vacancy on a train, I would esteem it a great honour if you will kindly recommend me’.\n\nIda returned to France in May 1917, serving at various hospitals, and casualty clearing stations. She was promoted to A/Sister on 1st June 1917, A/Matron 22 January 1918. On 17th June 1918 she was granted her wish to be posted to an Ambulance Train (No. 24).\n\nOnly six days later on the 23rd June at 10:20 the train was targeted in an air raidat Doullens. The WarDiary reports: ‘Several bombs dropped in the vicinity of train. Considerable material damage, and Capt G W Will and Sister I. B. Leedham wounded.’George Wishart Will was Officer Commanding No. 24 Amb. Train, Sister Leedam was wounded in the left leg. The train continued to load up with wounded troops which were taken back to Rouen the next day where Ida was evacuated to No.8 Gen Hosp. She returned to train duty on the 24th July to be on board when a few weeks later, five coaches & the T.R.H.P.O. (any ideas) were ‘derailed, damaged and detached’ as the train crossed points near St Etienne – no staff casualties reported.\n\nIda was part of the British Army of the Rhine in 1919 & demobilised at the end of 1920.\n\nAfter a gap of ten years in civvy street she re-joined at the Military Hospital, Catterick for temporary duty.She then had a very short spell of trooping duty on board “Nevasa” before returning to Home Duties, but wasn’t well. In August 1936 Ida was admitted to hospital, diagnosed suffering fromparkinsonism and declared unfit for general duties. Her appointment was terminated in February 1937, Ida died on 17th November 1944 with a recorded age of 66.\n\nFreebmdhttps://www.freebmd.org.uk/search\n\n24 Ambulance Train 1918 Jan – 1919 Apr:https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/96b7df4368f840b591c3fe063a739a67\n\nNurse Records Filehttps://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C10797624\n\nRegards ZeZe\n\nEdited 19 November , 2022 by ZeZe\n\nadded Leedam info\n\nZeZe,\n\nSearched for 'KEENE' in Maud McCarthy's diary and found quite a lot;-\n\n18.04.16.\n\nLetter from Miss Keene, new A/Matron Asturias, saying she is not a good sailor, but she will write again later and say how she is getting on.\n\n27.06.16\n\nLetter received from Miss Keene, Matron, Asturias, to say Nurse Francis TFNS causing trouble, OC wishing her to be moved.
