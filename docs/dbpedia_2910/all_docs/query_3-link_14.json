        "text": "Their Challenge\n\nOperating within the Aerospace Industry, Parker Meggitt’s production process needs to be transparent, requiring heavy documentation and full traceability at multiple stages of the assembly line.\n\nBefore VisualFactory, operators would spend a vast amount of time signing paperwork and archiving documents to record serialisation, performance and other vital measures.\n\nThis time-consuming activity restricted available capacity and required careful management to ensure operators were always working from the latest version of the work instructions.\n\nSolution\n\nWork instructions are now displayed on screen, guiding the operators through the process and ensuring the latest version is always available, immediately at point of use.\n\nManufacturing history and testing are now recorded within VisualFactory, removing the time needed to sign and archive documentation. Test rigs are linked directly to VisualFactory, displaying the results on screen for the operator.\n\nBy use of parameters VisualFactory also clearly indicates to the operator whether the unit has passed or failed test and automatically stores the result.\n\n\"We have identified our ‘hidden factory’ with the vRework module that has helped us to understand, document and improve first pass yield. Operators are happy as they see VisualFactory as an investment in them, making their job easier and helping them to work in the most effective way.\"\n\nDigital Programme Manager, Chris Perry\n\nParker Meggitt has a digitalisation plan for all of their 34 locations across the Americas, Europe,Middle East, and Asia Pacific. VisualFactory is a key player in this. Meggitt are currently in the process of increasing to 250 vScreens in their Ventura County, USA facility, 8 vScreens in Coventry, UK and 12 in Birmingham, UK."
