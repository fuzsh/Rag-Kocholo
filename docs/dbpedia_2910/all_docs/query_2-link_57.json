        "text": "Welcome to\n\nMeggitt Valves & Whittaker Controls\n\nVBR Turbine Partners is proud to bring all Meggitt OEM services to Rolls Royce (Siemens), General Electric and Solar gas turbine operators. VBR provides new Meggitt Gas Turbine Valves and Controls, product upgrades and OEM approved overhaul services from our own location in Elst, Netherlands. VBR Turbine Partners is the only OEM approved distributor and overhaul facility for Meggitt Whittaker based in Europe. (more)\n\nFor years Whittaker Controls was known as a well respected engineering company of gas turbine air flow control and fuel control valves. A company with a history starting in aviation and aerospace that has further developed this knowledge for the industrial gas turbine industry worldwide. Based in North Hollywood California, Whittaker Controls became a member of Meggitt Plc group in 1999.\n\nOver the last years Meggitt made a transition in valve actuation technology. The products evolved from ‘brute force’ hydraulically actuated valves to well balanced fully electrically operated control valves. This resulted in more reliable, more accurate, faster actuating and more economic control valves for gas turbines. Fuel valves operate under the most demanding and extreme conditions. Reliability has remained the main criterea for all product developments.\n\nPlease contact us for any inquiry on Meggitt Controls gas turbine valves or OEM overhaul services you may have.\n\nDear Customer,\n\nVBR Turbine Partners wishes to inform you on the Meggitt motor controller for fuel metering valves.\n\nPart numbers that are affected by this message:\n\nC450305 Motor Controller\n\nC450285 (C450305 triple enclosure)\n\nC450295 (C450305 with hi-temp enclosure)\n\nThe C450305 motor controller is a replacement for the obsolete C173455 analog motor controller.\n\nThe C450305 is however NOT A DROP-IN replacement\n\nIt is required to make changes in your controls system and possibly in the motor controller itself before installing the C450305 motor controller in your system.\n\nSo, before you install a new motor controller, take the following steps and pre-cautions into consideration:\n\n1. Make a backup of the settings in your controls system.\n\n2. Make sure that you have a RS485/422 adapter ready to make changes in the motor controller\n\n3. Make a backup of the motor controller settings\n\n4. Have the part number and serial numbers from your motor controllers (old and new) and FMV noted\n\n5. Check settings in the Maintenance Manual\n\n6. Check and note how are the comm cables RX- RX+ TX- TX+ are connected\n\n7. Check and note how the Signal ground is wired\n\n8. Check or take a photo of the rotary switch settings\n\n9. Check and note the communication settings in the controls system\n\n10. Have a drawing of the current loop & wiring setup ready\n\nIn many cases the motor controller will behave as programmed. Problems have been found with operators operating Speedtronic Mark VLM, MKVI and MKVIe controls systems.\n\nIn case you have one of these controls systems, or any other question with respect to installation of the C450305 motor controller, please contact us on meggitt@vbr-turbinepartners.com.\n\nGE released Service Bulletins\n\nLM2500-IND-0283 & LM6000-IND-0326\n\nGE Power & Water has approved all Meggitt bleed air valves for use on GE LM gas turbines\n\n“NEW BLEED AIR VALVE WITH IMPROVED RELIABILITY”\n\nThe latest service bulletin is a notice to LM operators worldwide to replace their existing Honeywell bleed air valve by\n\na Meggitt next generation valve. A number of improvements are the result of years of development.\n\nInadequate seals and spacers have been replaced. New thermal shielding of the LVDT and torque motor wiring will prevent chafing and feedback problems from happening. Larger and better bearings ensure correct positioning of the butterfly disk and scraper ring at all stages and prevent leakages.\n\nMeggitt recommended overhaul interval for bleed air valves: every 50.000 hours of operation\n\nMore information on the new Meggitt Bleed Air Valves found on this page\n\nDownload our latest newsletter\n\nFor more information on the upgrade or an inquiry, contact VBR Turbine Partners\n\nASK FOR ROTABLE EXCHANGE OPTIONS"
