        "text": "Aerospace and defense engineering conglomerate Meggitt PLC said it expects to hire 150 employees over the next five years as its Meggitt Sensing Systems unit moves into its new manufacturing facility in Irvine.\n\nThe division of UK-based Meggitt plans a grand opening today of its new office and industrial building at 14600 Myford Rd. near Jamboree Road and Walnut Avenue.\n\nIn recent weeks, the company has brought in 300 employees from old facilities in San Juan Capistrano and New Hampshire to its Irvine site – a consolidation of its facilities in North America.\n\nMeggitt Sensing Systems makes components for air and spacecraft that measure things such as vibration and pressure in demanding environments. Some instruments also are used for medical purposes.\n\nThe sensing systems division in 2012 produced 15 percent – about $300 million – of Meggitt’s overall revenue.\n\nFor grand opening ceremonies today, Irvine Mayor Steven Choi and other local government officials were invited, along with consul generals from the U.K. and Switzerland, where Meggitt Sensing Systems is headquartered.\n\nThe 190,000-square-foot building previously served as headquarters of an industrial printer and printing supply manufacturer Printronix Inc. before it was bought by the Irvine Co. last year.\n\nAnother Meggitt division, Meggitt Defense Systems, which manufactures military equipment, already operates at a separate Irvine facility with about 230 employees."
