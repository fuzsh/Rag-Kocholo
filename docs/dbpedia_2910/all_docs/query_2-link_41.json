        "text": "Every company wants to minimize risk, but the stakes are especially high for Meggitt. Meggitt provides aerospace, defense, and energy systems across the globe. They not only need to know who walks through their doors. They must also stay compliant with government and contractual obligations when sharing information with visitors.\n\nJonathan Priganc first joined Meggitt overseeing trade compliance business systems and ensuring system compliance with various regulatory frameworks. He noticed some significant opportunities for improvement, especially in Meggittâs visitor management process.\n\nâSince weâre a company of acquisitions, every site was different,â says Priganc. âThey each operated on their own terms, with resources and documentation siloed by location.â\n\nMeggitt has internal registration protocols of its own. Each location abides by specific regional government regulations around who enters a facility. Different facilities, and even different buildings in a location, may hold sensitive data and equipment. A lack of systematic security measures could be catastrophic.\n\nPriganc began the search for a secure, scalable visitor management system. Hereâs why he chose Envoy to safeguard each Meggitt location from the inside-out.\n\nStandardizing complex security protocols\n\nPrigancâs first priority was securing the manufacturing facilities containing export-controlled data. Envoy Visitors ensures that everyone entering a facility complies with trade regulations like International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and Export Administration Regulations (EAR).\n\nPriganc uses Envoyâs invitation emails and custom sign-in flows to capture visitor information. With this, he feels confident that only pre-approved visitors can access their facilities. For an extra layer of protection, Meggitt uses Envoyâs Visual Compliance integration to screen visitors against restricted party watchlists.\n\nFor these security measures to be effective, Priganc needed to standardize them across locations. He has a sign-in template in Envoy that he can clone to roll out the new process to new locations. Rather than starting from scratch each time, Priganc is able to edit the cloned templates to meet location-specific requirements: âThis saves me days of work.â\n\nFueling efficiency with global visibility\n\nSince the initial deployment, Priganc and the team have continued to implement Envoy at an increasing number of locations. Through the data captured, the organization has been able to have a better insight into various aspects of the visitor process. For example, the sites now have greater visibility into the busiest times at a facility and can staff a reception area accordingly.\n\nEnvoy also makes it easy to see if a location is not following protocols. This allows Meggitt to provide consistent, seamless experiences to visitors around the world. Since data is stored safely within Envoy, Meggitt reduces its risk of storing potentially sensitive data in multiple systems.\n\nâWe can collect all the data we need to meet our compliance requirements in one, centralized place. We trust that Envoy protects that data, stores it securely, and does so globally. Thatâs a big win.â"
