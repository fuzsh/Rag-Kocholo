        "text": "Sarah Parker-Walton\n\nAssistant Principal (SENCO)\n\nSarah started her career in public house and retail management in and around the county of Dorset. After starting a family, she then worked for the ambulance service managing improvements to the service along with marketing.\n\nAt the age of 29, Sarah changed career and trained as a secondary science teacher starting in special educational needs and challenging mainstream schools. Sarah then moved to Bedale as a secondary science teacher delivering biology, chemistry and physics whilst contributing to the PE department after studying a sport science degree. Being passionate about developing young people’s personal skills and social and emotional preparation for post 16, Sarah led pastorally as Head of Year and teaching and learning as Head of General Studies in mainstream.\n\n8 years ago, Sarah joined Forest Moor School as senior leadership and led changing the school culture to embrace relational practice and the understanding of supporting social and emotional development through current research. Sarah’s experience includes managing change in and out of education and extensive experience both pastorally and in teaching and learning. As SENCO Sarah’s passion is in understanding the needs of staff and pupils and empowering them to make progress both academically and equally socially and emotionally in preparation for life.\n\nAlec Scott\n\nVice Principal\n\nAlec started his path to teaching by studying for a degree in Physical Education and Sports Coaching at York St. John University. Upon the completion of this degree, Alec progressed onto completing a Primary PGCE with PE specialism and was subsequently hired as a NQT at a large Junior School in the East Riding of Yorkshire where he progressed onto a Year Group Leader and the Assessment and Pupil Premium Lead.\n\nIt was in this role that Alec started to gain an interest in the holistic development of children and he completed a MA in Education whereby his thesis focussed on the SEMH Assessment and Development of Children from Socio-economic Deprivation. Following the completion of his Masters in Education, Alec moved to a large inner-city primary school where he was the curriculum leader. Alec’s continued interest in Socio-economic deprivation and SEMH development, has meant that he started to complete his Ed.D with a focus on Children’s Identity and the Impact of the Curriculum.\n\nIn April 2020, Alec moved to Forest Moor in the role of a KS3 teacher. In November of 2021, Alec was appointed as the Assistant Principal for Behaviour, Safety and Welfare on a temporary basis. In April 2022, Alec was successfully appointed as the Assistant Principal for Teaching and Learning at Forest Moor.\n\nAlec was successfully appointed to the role of Vice Principal in April 2024.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI have over 25 years of experience of working in education. The majority of this time has been spent in mainstream primary schools in London, Norfolk, Essex and Bradford. The last four years have I have taught in an S.E.M.H. setting.\n\nWhy Forest Moor School?\n\nI wanted to work in an environment that helped pupils, who have a number of challenges to overcome, to progress in their education. I believe that my vast experience could be employed to enhance the life chances of our pupils, so that they can begin to fulfil their future potential and be able to take advantage of a greater range of opportunities.\n\nPassion for Education: I believe that it is a privilege to contribute to an individual’s intellectual and moral values, to foster personal growth, and prepare individuals for active participation in society. It is immensely satisfying to help provide our pupils with the knowledge, skills, and morals they need to live happy, fruitful lives.\n\nOutside Interests\n\nI enjoy watching sport, playing cricket and socialising with friends and family.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI began my proper working career as a Youth Worker with a focus on supporting vulnerable young people particularly those with Autism. I Have had a few roles relating to youth work for local authorities and charities. I qualified as a primary school teacher but quickly moved in to working in specialist provisions. I have worked for Wellspring Academy for over 5 years and started at Forest Moor in Easter 2021, moving from another of our SEMH schools in Seacroft, Leeds.\n\nWhy Forest Moor School?\n\nI enjoy working with young people and feel that the ethos at Forest Moor, around focusing on supporting young people’s social and emotional development just as much as their academic development, very much aligns with my own values. Working at Forest Moor provides many opportunities to help young people succeed and what’s great is that no two days are the same.\n\nPassion for Education\n\nI believe that all young people should get the opportunities and support they need to achieve in school and this is what we strive to offer at Forest Moor.\n\nOutside Interests\n\nOutside of school, I like to go away in the campervan with my family and our dog Islay (she can also be seen around school during the week.) I also have a passion for basketball which I play weekly for a local team.\n\nMy name is Dave Greenwood and I am a KS3 teacher.\n\nI have worked in education for nearly 20 years both as a TA and as a teacher. My decision to work in special education came from a family member who has additional needs so I knew that I wanted to help others with needs from an early age.\n\nI came to Forest Moor on supply over 2 years ago and immediately saw the strength and commitment of the staff team. The journey the school has been on is amazing and it is an honour to be part of it. The difference we make to the pupils’ lives is fantastic and I could not imagine a better staff team to deliver the schools ethos of unconditional positive regard.\n\nMy passion for education goes deeper than just academic learning. At Forest Moor we work on the entire aspect of a pupils well being and offer a bespoke curriculum that meets the pupils EHCP and SEMH needs. This enables us to give the pupils the greatest chance for success in the future.\n\nIn my free time I am an avid martial artist and love to read. I am a history teacher by trade so love anything historical.\n\nI am currently doing my second year of teaching at Forest Moor. I wanted to work in an SEMH school after spending time in one of our other sites during my teach training year. Having worked with children and adults with additional needs in the past, I knew that I wanted to continue my career helping others with needs.\n\nThe Forest Moor team has been so supportive along my teaching journey and we all work together to get the best outcomes for our young people. It has been a pleasure to see so many successes for our pupils over the past year at Forest Moor and the differences that we make to our pupil’s lives.\n\nThe constant unconditonal positive regard that we provide our children with is so valuable and this drives the positive relationships that we have with our children. I love being outside and animals.\n\nI currently bring my dog ,Dobby-Nigel, into school on a Wednesday and Friday as I have seen the impact that animals can have on the pupil’s wellbeing and have recently introduced chickens into our school to give our young people another space to enjoy.\n\nGraduating from the University with a degree in Psychology, my profound passion for this field led me to join Forest Moor in early 2022 as support staff. It was here that I discovered my deep affection for the school’s environment and its unwavering commitment to both students and staff.\n\nIn 2023, I transitioned into a teaching role at Forest Moor, a choice that felt like a natural fit from the very beginning of my journey here. The dedication displayed by our staff in supporting students and one another is nothing short of remarkable.\n\nEach day in this role presents unique challenges, all fueled by our collective desire to enhance the lives of our young people. The school’s strong emphasis on individualised student needs, facilitated by effective communication and comprehensive training, is a testament to our commitment.\n\nWitnessing the positive impact of our efforts on our students’ lives is immensely gratifying. Forest Moor not only educates but also continuously nurtures and supports my development, enabling me to evolve into the best teacher I can possibly be.\n\nI enjoy maintaining both my physical and mental well-being by regularly going to the gym. Additionally, I have a passion for exploring the scenic wonders of our country, especially when there’s an opportunity for a coffee break along the way.\n\n“I chose to work at Forest Moor as I had previously volunteered between year 1 and 2 of my primary education degree. I have always wanted to work in Special education, and I really enjoyed my time here as a volunteer. I came to work here when wishing to leave my previous school (a generic special needs school with a focus on ASC) and came across a job advert.\n\nSince working at Forest Moor, I have had several opportunities to develop my career, firstly I took charge of the PSHE curriculum, then I was able to take a lead of key stages, firstly KS3 and latterly KS2. This year I have been able to develop my subject knowledge and leadership of a whole school subject – Maths – as I have been appointed Head of Maths. This is a role which I am excited to undertake as I would like the opportunity to lead a core subject across the entire school.\n\nI plan to develop myself as a practitioner and eventually move into a SLT role. Forest Moor helps me with this by facilitating further CPD within coaching and supporting networking opportunities”\n\nShaun Payne originally started as a Teaching assistant and sports coach in mainstream for 3 years, then moved on to SEN autism specialist school for 6 years where I was a Teaching assistant both with a class and 1 to 1 at times too. I’ve worked with a range of different classes and Key stages. I have worked with students with a range of different needs. These include Autism, PDA, ADHD, ODD, High functioning etc. I always do my best to promote\n\nequal opportunities to help my students achieve their full potential in a safe and caring environment. I value, encourage and celebrate diversity that I feel is highly important in a modern world. I adapt my approach to help meet every learner’s needs. I specialise in Autism, PDA and ADHD achieving qualifications in these areas.\n\nMy biggest achievement I am proud of is the work I did with the learner with PDA. I was working with this learner for over a year. This learner made huge improvements in various aspects of his school life, including coming into school, changing of clothing, taking on roles around the school etc. The local authority was very happy with the way this learner has improved. From a very shy and anxious child who wouldn’t come into school he became an extremely happy and bubbly person, who walks into school with a huge smile on his face. It was a fantastic experience to work with a PDA student and to learn in depth about PDA as well as how to deal with difficult situations. I managed to set him up for a very successful future and in life. It was great seeing what I and this learner achieved throughout the time working together. It was a miracle as well as life changing.\n\nI joined Wellspring Academy Trust in 2022 as a General Teaching assistant within 2 months, I’ve been promoted twice as an ATA and Construction instructor. I have recently received a third promotion as a full time Instructor and Tutor for KS4. I have done a level 3 AET course and am looking at becoming a qualified teacher in the future. This is by far the best school and staff I have ever worked with.\n\nAbout Me\n\nI have worked across a range of Secondary schools within the Leeds and Bradford area teaching English, and Drama at KS3/4/5. I have undertaken various pastoral roles within these mainstream settings such as Head of Year and Director of KS4 overseeing key areas such as behaviour and attainment. I then moved into leading and managing the North West Leeds KS3/KS4 SEMH alternative provision for several years before taking my current role as subject leader at Forest Moor.\n\nWhy Forest Moor School?\n\nI know that this school is especially committed to promoting creative learning opportunities for children, and this is something that interests me personally. I wanted to become part of a highly committed team and add my own skills and experience to further strengthen the high-quality experience that this school offers its students.\n\nPassion for Education\n\nI always hope to set challenging standards for myself and do expect this of others as I feel strongly about extending and driving students’ talent and progress forward enriching their educational experience leading to better life chances. My aim would always be to raise English standards across Forest Moor School doing whatever it takes to ensure that each pupil achieves their full potential to secure the brightest of futures.\n\nOutside Interests\n\nI have a range of interests such as collecting vinyl records, fashion, and the arts. I regularly attend music festivals and gigs around Yorkshire. Planning to return to Australia next year (my favourite holiday place) for more sailing, diving and sunshine! “\n\nAbout Me\n\nAfter completing my Psychology degree at Birmingham University in 2021, I wanted to take some time for myself and headed off on a solo travelling trip around Europe. Without sounding too cliche, the trip gave me a whole new perspective and gave me the confidence I needed to pursue the career I have always wanted in education. On my return, I worked in an SEN holiday club, which gave me the connections I needed to come in contact with Forest Moor School.\n\nWhy Forest Moor School?\n\nWhen I heard about Forest Moor School’s aim to improve life opportunities for young people, I knew this was the place for me. Their focus on unconditional positive regard, unique ways of learning in and outside the classroom, and flexible consistency, drew me to be a part of this team.\n\nPassion for Education\n\nHaving a not so smooth sailing time at secondary school myself, I am passionate about giving young people a positive experience in education and allowing them to see the value in themselves as individuals. Having the opportunity to play a part in turning young people’s lives around for the better is a privilege. Additionally, having started as a teaching assistant and now a food tech instructor, I am gaining invaluable experience for my next steps in becoming a qualified teacher. Outside Interests: When I’m not socialising with work colleagues and other friends, I enjoy going to the gym for both my mental and physical health.\n\nAbout me\n\nI have worked at Forest Moor since it opened in 2012 and have worked in the educational sector for about 20 years teaching adults with learning disabilities, young offenders and delivering planned targeted interventions. My current role is a pastoral role where I support all pupils to develop their skills and resilience to access their learning and work with outside agencies to offer the best support possible.\n\nWhy Forest Moor\n\nI was drawn to work at Forest Moor as it was a new school opening with great opportunities for success. The extensive space allows us to work more fluidly when supporting children with differing learning needs.\n\nPassion for education\n\nThe core values of building trusting relationships and ensuring every child is supported to be their best is my main passion for working in education, ensuring that every pupil has a pathway for progression for their future.\n\nOutside Interests\n\nWhen I am not at work I like to spend time in the community with my friends and family.\n\nI came to Forest Moor after working with children with different special educational needs such as autism, ADHD, selective mutism etc whilst working with these childrens I realised that I had a passion for working with children with SEN needs and SEMH needs.\n\nI started at Forest Moor through an agency and they suggested that Forest Moor would be a good fit for me, I said I would rather go into an SEMH setting than SEN and they gave me FM.\n\nI worked at a nursery for two years prior to starting at Forest Moor, 1 year I was working and doing my college course at the same time.\n\nI have progressed to where I am now through various training and building my relationships with all the students.\n\nI have moved from working at a nursery and doing placement in primary schools to being a GTA at Forest Moor and being in a variety of classrooms, from then I have changed my position to care team.\n\nMy plans in the future is to go down a pastoral route and to explore safeguarding more. I believe Forest Moor can help me with this as they provide accurate training and also offer external support to get people when they want to be.\n\nUp until 2019 I had been in sales all of my career but there was always something missing. I made the choice to go back into education and started by studying Health Sciences at Harrogate College. I then went to study a Bachelors Degree in Sports Development and Mental Health at Leeds Beckett University with the idea that I could either become a coach or get involved in teaching and help support young adults with sport and mental health. Once I had graduated however, opportunities were very hard to find so I broadened my searches for employment. I was contacted by an agency representing Forest Moor School who gave me the chance to go there on a 12 week temporary basis. I was eager to do something to further my development and thought I could come here for 12 weeks while I found a coaching position elsewhere.\n\nHowever, things didn’t work out like that.\n\nInstead, I fell in love with the job and the staff at Forest Moor. Having had an extremely difficult childhood myself, I found that I could relate to and understand the young people at this school and that I could also help them in ways that others possibly couldn’t. My plans now have changed, and I now can only see my future lying here with Forest Moor. Having made the switch to becoming a permanent member of staff, and now with my imminent move to the care team, I feel that this is just the beginning of something that could last a long time. Instead of seeing myself elsewhere, I now hope to be able to develop myself further down along the pastoral route within Forest Moor with the ultimate aim to be in a position where I can most effectively care and help young people who cross my path so that they can have a better life than I had at their age.\n\nForest Moor has one of the most dedicated, committed and caring team of people I have ever found in any workplace. Not only is it a joy to work with such hard working colleagues, but also comforting and reassuring to know there are people just like me that struggle daily with normal things but that it is still possible to make a massive difference in the lives of others.”"
