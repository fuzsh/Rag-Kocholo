        "text": "Which are the 15 Best Places to Live in Dorset.\n\nDorset has it all, from deeply rooted history and incredible architecture to miles of sandy beaches and countless nature reserves.\n\nOn top of all this, it’s reported that the quality of life is very high here. Not only this, but Dorset has the highest life expectancy in the entirety of Britain.\n\nMoving to Dorset could be the best leap you’ve ever made. This being said, with so many bustling market towns and fresh coastal resorts to choose from, it can be difficult finding out where the best places to live in Dorset actually are.\n\nFor this reason, this article has been put together to help you decide where you will put down your roots for generations to come; as once you move here, you’ll never look back. Here are, in our view, the 15 best places to live in Dorset:\n\nFor Those Retiring\n\nMany who find themselves entering retirement decide they wish to live closer to the glimmering ocean, or maybe to be surrounded by rolling hills in Hardy Country.\n\nDorset ranked in 1st place in ‘Quality of Retirement’ by The Prudential in 2019 as well as 2014. With an abundance of picturesque towns and villages, your ideal home here in Dorset is just waiting to be discovered:\n\nCharminster\n\nThis quaint village is located in West Dorset, 2 miles north of Dorchester. Sitting at a population of just under 3000, this village offers plenty of adventures as well as a quiet village lifestyle.\n\nThe Ham Stone Tower located here was built in the 16th century, the Wolfeton house in the 15th century, but indications show that settlements as early as the 1st century have been unearthed here.\n\nTeeming with history, Charminster is often overlooked for larger towns and villages. There are properties to suit all price ranges here, from a 2-bedroom maisonette for £140,000 to a £2,000,000 8-bedroom detached Edwardian country house.\n\nClose enough to not be isolated, but far enough to maintain the old-style English village atmosphere; Charminster could be the place for you.\n\nShaftesbury\n\nWhen you first visit Shaftesbury, you’ll be amazed that you’ve never heard of this place before.\n\nGold Hill is a steep cobbled street that is locally famed for its picturesque overlook. It’s what sets this little market town apart from every other location in Dorset, with many describing it as one of the most romantic sights in England!\n\nLocated nearby to the A350, with easy access to the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as well as being a short drive from Blandford Forum and Salisbury, makes this treasure trove of a town the perfect place to retire.\n\nOn average, houses in Shaftesbury sell for £350,000, which isn’t too far above the average for the county. But you won’t only be getting an incredible home, you’ll also be getting access to the incredible nearby countryside and you’ll live in one of the most romantic villages in the entirety of England.\n\nAshmore\n\nAshmore will undoubtedly be the smallest village mentioned throughout this article. With a population of only 188 people, Ashmore is often one of those places overlooked and mainly visited by those who took a wrong turn down the road.\n\nWhich is a shame! What many don’t know is that this village is filled with unspoilt history, featuring gorgeous thatched houses which have been perfectly maintained.\n\nThroughout the past century or so, Ashmore has seen some genuine love and care with many buildings being rebuilt or restored to the same fashion that they were previously, creating an old-England atmosphere like no other place can create.\n\nOffering an escape from the bustling, crowded towns; Ashmore offers incredible views over Dorset, sitting at 700m above sea-level, as well the fresh air that Dorset has an abundance of. Retiring to Ashmore could be the perfect move for you.\n\nWeymouth\n\nMany people prefer to retire to a smaller area of the world, where there aren’t an endless list of events occurring. While this is true for most, some people like the lively atmospheres that larger towns create.\n\nWeymouth is a seaside town and is recognised as one of the most desirable locations for retirement in the whole of the UK.\n\nThe fresh coastal air and annual seafood festivals are enough to lure even the most unsure candidate to Weymouth. If that isn’t enough, Weymouth offers some of the best beach walks in the UK along the Jurassic Coast.\n\nOn your way back from your hikes, pop into The Nothe Tavern, said to have the best Sunday lunch in all of Weymouth.\n\nWith prices starting at £230,000 for a two-bedroom flat, residents in Weymouth can enjoy an excellent quality of life with plenty of amenities, activities and events to keep you busy throughout the years to come.\n\nFor Those With Family\n\nSome of the best places to live in Dorset are filled with families and top-quality schools. You can have peace of mind when moving to Dorset, with brilliant schools such as the Thomas Hardye School and Atlantic Academy Portland, and excellent opportunities for family days out:\n\nDorchester\n\nDorchester is arguably one of the best locations in Dorset, maybe even the UK, for raising a family. Not only are you not isolated from the outside world, but you also have a wide array of brilliant schools right on your doorstep.\n\nDorchester is a short distance from Weymouth, surrounded by the Dorset AONB, and it also contains two train stations, Dorchester South and West. These train stations connect Dorchester to Bath Bristol, London and Bournemouth (among other towns and villages).\n\nBack to the fantastic schools on offer, Ofsted has rated FIVE primary schools here as “outstanding”, with the previously mentioned Thomas Hardye School being located here, also receiving an “outstanding”.\n\nA day out with the family will never be boring here in Dorchester, with fantastic attractions like Weymouth SEA LIFE and the Tutankhamun Exhibition nearby, there are countless things to do here. If you prefer a bit of history, then go and visit the Maiden Castle, an Iron Age hill fort a short distance from Dorchester.\n\nBlandford Forum\n\nA traditional market town, only a 45-minute drive from Bournemouth and Poole; Blandford Forum offers a slightly different experience than elsewhere in Dorset.\n\nIn 1731, there was a devastating fire here. Two brothers, known as the Bastard Brothers (Bastard being their surname), helped rebuild the town, creating an eye-grabbing town in the Georgian architecture style.\n\nProperty prices here are just above the average for the county at £355,000; however, if you’re looking to bag one of the Georgian style homes here, you may be looking at a slightly larger figure.\n\nWhen it comes to schools, Blandford Forum has plenty of choice. The closest secondary school is Blandford School, which is a mixed-gender school for 11-18-year-olds. This school, in particular, was given an Ofsted rating of “good” with ‘the potential to become Outstanding’.\n\nAway from the noise, but close enough that a trip to most of the towns and villages in Dorset are under an hour away. Blandford Forum is a great location in Dorset and offers everything you could want in a town when growing up.\n\nFerndown\n\nFerndown is one of those locations in Dorset that truly belongs in Dorset, from the 700-acre pine forest to the bustling yet uncrowded town centre. Being the second-largest non-coastal town in Dorset is very attractive to many, and with the abundance of open space Ferndown has to offer, it’s obvious why.\n\nFerndown, being on an ancient heathland, has an expansive network of outdoor space. The Longham Lakes are often considered an excellent place for a walk, especially if you have a dog. With over 147 species of bird here, these lakes offer a fantastic day out for the family.\n\nMoving with children is never an easy task. Therefore, you’re most definitely looking for the best places to live in Dorset that will have great educational facilities for your children. Ferndown has three schools, one in each level of education (nursery, primary and secondary), all of which received a “good” from Ofsted.\n\nFor further education, Bournemouth University is just a short distance away, offering 100s of degrees in science and technology, media, management and more.\n\nOutside of town, the world is your oyster. Travel south to the Jurassic Coast or maybe head into Bournemouth’s town centre. If you’re feeling adventurous, then take the kids for a day out at GoApe and traverse the treetops, swinging through the trees.\n\nSherborne\n\nThis picture-perfect town is full of history, boutique shops and vibrant markets. Situated in north-west Dorset, Sherborne is home to some fantastic locations and incredible architecture.\n\nThe town wears a golden hue, luring those from afar to move into one of the beautiful period homes scattered throughout the area. The town also has a bustling nightlife, but not one large enough to disturb the early risers.\n\nSherborne has five weekly markets, enough for all your needs ranging from the farmers market to the weekly book fair.\n\nSherborne also has very high achieving schools in both the public and prep schools sector. Sherborne Primary School is known to be well above average in achieving in many subjects. The Gryphon School is an incredibly sought-after secondary school with an incredible and competitive sports scene.\n\nSherborne has great transport links directly to London Waterloo, the housing prices are competitive and the local area is rich with history, making Sherborne a fantastic place to raise your family.\n\nFor The Young Professional\n\nYou’ve just secured a job, and now you’re moving to Dorset, looking for the best places to live. While Dorset may not initially sound like a hub for young professionals, there are plenty of large towns here that have ample to offer:\n\nPoole\n\nPoole has seen tremendous developments occur over the past decades, from the renovation of quayside areas to the housing developments within Poole.\n\nKnown for having the second biggest natural harbour in the world, many visit Poole and spend countless hours at the surrounding beaches, the lighthouse art centre and the old town. There is so much to do here in Poole, making it one of the best places to live in Dorset for young professionals.\n\nPoole is home to plenty of pubs, restaurants and clubs, for those looking for a great start and end to the night. Make sure you visit The Clay Pipe Inn and the Drift Micro Bar to switch your night up a bit.\n\nIn addition to this, Poole is far from isolated. It’s got excellent transport links to the rest of Dorset, especially Bournemouth and Christchurch, both of which (like Poole itself) have a range of employment prospects and are very well known for their nights out and incredible towns.\n\nSurrounded by beaches, markets, an indoor shopping centre and opportunities for water sports year-round. Poole is a great choice for any young professional moving to Dorset.\n\nChristchurch\n\nSpeaking of Christchurch, not many people know that Christchurch has only been within Dorset’s borders since 1974.\n\nLocated east of Bournemouth, this location offers excellent access to London as well as the South East. The brilliant train network here means its 8 minutes to Bournemouth, 49 minutes to Southampton and just under two hours to London Waterloo.\n\nThis bustling town offers a thriving arts scene and plenty of outdoor activities to keep you entertained throughout the weekend. With the government Help to Buy ISA or Lifetime ISA, buying a new house has become that little bit easier. With one-bedroom flats going for as little as £100,000, get moving!\n\nKnown as the Garden City because of its many beautiful parks, gardens and tree-lined streets; living in Poole is as close as you can get to living in a bustling town but also in the countryside. If you wanted some more greenery, a short trip down the road takes you to the New Forest or Cranborne Chase AONB.\n\nBournemouth\n\nBournemouth is an obvious choice for any young professional looking to move to Dorset. Not only is the great nightlife nearby, with countless pubs and restaurants to choose from; there are many opportunities for work here as well.\n\nIf you’re in the engineering or aviation industry, then Bournemouth airport will likely be a brilliant place for you to find work, with companies ranging from Honeywell and Meggitt to Drilling Systems UK and Mildren Construction. You’ll find plenty of opportunities to choose from.\n\nIf you’re in the arts sector, then Bournemouth is home to a thriving arts scene, with its very own Arts University Bournemouth.\n\nIt’s well known that Bournemouth isn’t the cheapest place to live in Dorset, being the largest town in Dorset; but if you’ve got the money, then you can purchase a wonderful one or two-bedroom flat here. New developments, such as Gervis Road flats by Harlequin Homes, offer a fresh opportunity to get on the housing market early on.\n\nEverything is within a stone’s throw here in Bournemouth: Jurassic Coast; kayaking in Studland Bay; The Pavillion Theatre; and Bournemouth Pier which is close to home. With so much to do, Bournemouth is by far one of the best places to live in Dorset as a young professional.\n\nBridport\n\nWhile you may be a young professional, not everyone is looking for a busy town which feels like a city. Some prefer being in a quieter town, a bit closer to nature.\n\nWell, the surreal market town that is Bridport is an incredible location with plenty to do throughout the year without creating a sense of crowding.\n\nThis is yet another town with a thriving culture and arts scene, with the famous Bridport Arts Centre opening in 1973, hosting everything from gigs to exhibitions. Everything is easily accessible from Bridport, but this doesn’t mean you have to travel far to do something enjoyable and exciting.\n\nOn top of this, the average property price is lower than that for the county of Dorset! While this does in no way mean that all properties here are cheap, you’ll likely be able to find a bargain if you keep your eyes peeled.\n\nWith access to the Jurassic Coast, Lyme Regis, Dorchester and Devon, Bridport offers a fantastic location for those looking for something a little quieter with great links to the rest of Dorset, without leaving you bored or isolated.\n\nHere in Bridport, you’ll find a new adventure every day.\n\nThe Overall Best Places To Live In Dorset\n\nThe above towns and villages are perfect for certain types of people, or if you’re looking for something specific. If you want something with a bit of everything, then the following three towns are by far the best options for you, mixing the outdoors and busy shopping centres alike.\n\nIn these three towns/villages you’ll find everything to keep you busy, as well as providing you with plenty of access to the rest of the UK, including the best Dorset has to offer.\n\nLyme Regis\n\nA list compiled by the Sunday Times in 2019 named Lyme Regis as one of the top 10 Best Places To Live In The Southwest in 2019.\n\nLyme Regis has something for all. Its brilliant location is one of the main attraction points, but so are the renowned schools that are found here; as well as the brilliant nights out in the town centre.\n\nOften dubbed ‘The Pearl of Dorset’, Lyme Regis is like something out of a dream. With winding roads leading you to sweeping views over the ancient harbour and the market town attached, Lyme Regis is abundant in beauty.\n\nBeing a coastal town, the majority of houses for sales are flats; however, this doesn’t mean that all sales are. One problem with being one of the top places to live in Dorset is that the housing market here is very competitive and houses tend to get sold within a week or two of being put up for sale.\n\nLyme Regis attracts artists from all over, with the Woodroffe School being incredibly strong in visual arts as well as one of the most innovative schools in the country.\n\nMoving to Lyme Regis will open up the Jurassic Coast to you, allowing you to spend hours searching for fossils from an era long gone. You’ll find some incredible food here, especially in the famous Oyster and Fish House, which serves fresh seafood with spectacular coastal views. There is so much more to uncover here, making it one of the three best places to live in Dorset\n\nWeymouth\n\nAnother incredible town located on the Jurassic Coast, Weymouth is home to over 70,000 people as well as the best beach in the UK. Alongside this, Weymouth is surrounded by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, meaning a great day out for all the family is just a short drive away.\n\nA vast choice of primary schools are available to you, with the best in the area receiving a ‘Good’ rating from Ofsted. On top of this, if you live in the right location between Weymouth and Dorchester, you may be in the intake range for the famous Thomas Hardye School.\n\nWeymouth is a great location to start cycling. It is a beautiful way to take in everything that Weymouth has to offer, with 6 to 17-mile trails and plenty of different routes depending on your expertise.\n\nThis town is well-connected; offers incredible views of the coast; you’ll have a long list of bars and clubs when looking for a night out; has brilliant schools nearby, and the property market is relatively affordable, with a new two build apartment selling for £170,000.\n\nWeymouth is a mixture of history, nature and beauty all rolled into one town; so what are you waiting for?\n\nSouthbourne\n\nSouthbourne is on the outskirts of Bournemouth, and incredibly close to Christchurch. Its prime location offers access to both of these incredible towns as well as to the coast and it isn’t isolated, making it a perfect location for trips around the country.\n\nThis location is perfect for all retirees, young professionals and families alike. You’ll find the mix of people here refreshing, and it’s often said that this is a safe place to raise families and well located for a night out.\n\nSouthbourne has a unique mix of properties available, from luxury apartment flats and larger houses for families on Boscombe Overcliff Drive to retirement properties and two-bedroom apartments for under £150,000.\n\nTapas, sourdough pizzas, handmade burgers and rustic delis can be found in Southbourne’s artisanal food venues. Looking for a unique gift for a friend or loved one? You’ll most definitely find it here with the range of shops available to you.\n\nOn top of all this, Southbourne has ample of educational institutes; plenty of gyms; water sports at Hengistbury Head Outside and infinite coastal walking locations. Let’s not forget about the amazing countryside available to you and the history to go along with it, just a short journey from Southbourne.
