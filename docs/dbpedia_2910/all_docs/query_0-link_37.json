        "text": "The group has a Meggitt Avionics site at Titchfield Park in Fareham.\n\nMeggitt’s headquarters moved from Bournemouth Airport to Coventry in 2020.\n\nThe company, which employs 9,000 people worldwide, including 2,300 in the UK, said it would review the proposal of 900p-a-share bid from TransDigm and carefully consider the terms.\n\nBut the board of the Coventry-based firm said it would continue to recommend an offer made by Parker-Hannifin.\n\nMeggitt accepts £6.3bn takeover offer from US firm Parker-Hannifin\n\nMeggitt said: “The board of Meggitt believes Parker’s offer continues to represent an attractive proposition for Meggitt’s shareholders and for its broader stakeholders.”\n\nThe UK government has previously said it was “closely monitoring” the £6.3bn takeover plan by Parker-Hannifin and pointed out it has the power to intervene in deals that raised national security concerns.\n\nLast week, the government said: “Under the Enterprise Act 2002, the Business Secretary has powers to intervene in mergers and takeovers which raise national security concerns.\n\n“While commercial transactions remain primarily a matter for the parties involved, the government is closely monitoring the proposed acquisition of Meggitt by Parker-Hannifin.”\n\nHampshire construction firms 'could go out of business'\n\nMinisters are already monitoring a proposed takeover of another UK defence firm, Ultra Electronics, by rival Dorset-based Cobham, which is owned by US private equity house Advent.\n\nMeggitt builds parts for aerospace, defence and energy customers including Airbus and BAE Systems, and has contracts with the Ministry of Defence.\n\nParker-Hannifin has said it will honour the contracts with the UK government and would maintain Meggitt’s product engineering and manufacturing staff levels in the UK"
