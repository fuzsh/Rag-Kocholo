        "text": "EFC100 brochure\n\nHybrid created a marketing document to raise the profile of Meggitt’s EFC100 product which has been in production for over 50 years. Mission critical – it has successfully been relied on by the military since the 1970s on virtually every US helicopter, fighter, bomber and transport aircraft. However, Meggitt were now keen to spread EFC100’s wings into commercial aviation.\n\nThe booklet set out understanding EFC100 in seven easy lessons.\n\nWe produced a few hundred printed copies which were distributed at events and meetings as a leave behind for potential new clients."
