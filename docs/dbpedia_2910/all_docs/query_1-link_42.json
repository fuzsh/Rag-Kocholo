        "text": "AEL, or as it was know at the time Snipe International, was definitely acquired by Cobham, not Meggitt, in 1995. Logic - why would Meggitt renamed the company after a different company? Cobham plc was until 1994 FR Group and still operated the original Flight Refuelling Ltd. as a subsidiary. But Jane's UAV 2005 report Snipe MK.15 as a Meggitt Defence Systems product. MDS itself was until 1998 known as Target Technology Ltd., then it was bought by Meggitt Ltd. and renamed. I did not find on any Meggitt-related site any mention of any of the two Meggitts buying Flight Refuelling Targets or buying any production rights from it.\n\nBTW company infos:\n\nTarget Technology/Meggitt Defence Systems/QinetiQ Target Systems\n\nQINETIQ TARGET SYSTEMS LIMITED overview - Find and update company information - GOV.UK\n\nQINETIQ TARGET SYSTEMS LIMITED - Free company information from Companies House including registered office address, filing history, accounts, annual return, officers, charges, business activity\n\nAnd all my info about it (Jane's Aircraft 1984 confirms that it existed before 1984 as Piper-Target Systems but it's not mentioned in previous years):\n\nAero Electronics Ltd/AEL/Flight Refuelling Targets\n\nFLIGHT REFUELLING TARGETS LIMITED overview - Find and update company information - GOV.UK\n\nFLIGHT REFUELLING TARGETS LIMITED - Free company information from Companies House including registered office address, filing history, accounts, annual return, officers, charges, business activity\n\nIgnore the Henfield part, there was some economic trickery involved but there was a company called Aero Electronics Ltd based on the same adress at least since 1962, and 1978-1985 Jane's Aircraft confirms that it manufactured drones. That one got the Br.Avn sitre right, but it is mistaken about th 1995 part.\n\nFunnily enough, there was a third drone company in the 1990s, the venerable ML Aviation, which was in 1997 also bought by Cobham but kepts its name... Until 2020, when Cobham renamed it to Flight Refuelling Ltd! The original FR was a year before renamed as Cobham Mission Systems Wimborne (and then maybe sold away) so the name was free to use or something.\n\nMISSION SYSTEMS WIMBORNE LIMITED overview - Find and update company information - GOV.UK\n\nMISSION SYSTEMS WIMBORNE LIMITED - Free company information from Companies House including registered office address, filing history, accounts, annual return, officers, charges, business activity"
