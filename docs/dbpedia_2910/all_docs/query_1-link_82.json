        "text": "Works have completed at Project Holst – a £75 million industrial warehouse scheme located at Coventry’s renowned Prospero Ansty Park.\n\nAnsty Park is a major business park positioned next to the M6 and M69 junction, which is home to a number of high-profile companies including Rolls-Royce, Sainsbury’s, Cadent, aerospace manufacturer Meggitt and the UK's Manufacturing Technology Centre, the MTC.\n\nMcLaren Construction (Midlands and North) began the delivery of four industrial units and associated offices at Project Holst in January last year, on behalf of Manse Opus. All units are now finished and open to speculative tenants.\n\nThe commercial units, designed to meet a BREEAM Excellent rating, span a total of 856,109 sq. ft.\n\nProject Holst marks the third scheme at the park that McLaren Construction and Manse Opus have partnered together for, following more than three years of collaboration.\n\nOperations director of McLaren Construction Midlands and North, Shaun Colley, said: “We’re delighted to have partnered with Manse Opus again to provide further expansion to Prospero Ansty Park for this next phase, which is now complete.\n\n“Prospero Ansty Park is a fast-growing business and industrial hub for the West Midlands, for which we previously completed works for Apollo and Cadent. We have managed to overcome many challenges with this site – battling extreme weather. However, our skilled team of contractors managed to stick to the critical timelines of the programme and delivered an exceptional product.\n\n“Our focus for the scheme has been on providing energy efficiency and indoor environmental quality, which ensures energy consumption efficiencies whilst promoting a healthier and inviting workspace. The central high-specification commercial office space is ideally positioned to cater to clients in the industrial and logistics sector, bringing our client’s vision to life.”\n\nDavid Mitchell and Victoria Turnbull, Joint Managing Directors of Manse Opus, added: “We are proud of what we have achieved on site since our appointment in 2019. The transformation of this unused land to create the stunning buildings you see there today has been a great privilege and one we are really proud to have been able to achieve. We have contributed to safeguarding the legacy of a site which has such an impressive history.”"
