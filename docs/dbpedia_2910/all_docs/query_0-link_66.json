        "text": "Growth Deal funding up to £565,150\n\nDorset is home to a thriving and varied advanced engineering sector, which includes Aerospace, Defence, Composite and Marine technologies. Altogether, they employ around 15,400 people and contribute £800 million to Dorset’s economy. Some of the Dorset-based companies excelling in advanced engineering sectors include Cobham, Meggitt, BAE Systems, and Magellan Aerospace.\n\nDorset Growth Deal funding was used to upgrade facilities at Bournemouth and Poole College’s North Road campus for engineering and advanced manufacturing students. This was to: provide industry standard training, in response to requests from employers; support local business skills gaps, aimed at improving the performance of existing businesses; and to encourage the creation and growth of new ones.\n\nThe works, which significantly enhance the quality of the facilities and learning environment as well as reduce the building’s carbon footprint and increase its energy efficiency, included:\n\ncladding of external walls, replacements of windows (UPVC double glazed energy efficient units), roof repairs and new lighting\n\nclassroom renovations including upgrades to the:\n\nwelding bay facility with the addition of 16 new welding bays\n\nmotor vehicle practical teaching area including tyre changing facilities\n\nmotorcycle maintenance practical area\n\ninvestment in the lathe and milling areas, AutoCAD classrooms and 3D printing facilities\n\nBournemouth & Poole College’s advanced manufacturing and engineering facilities will lead to the creation of 30 direct jobs. In the 2016/17 academic year 370 engineering apprentices and 464 full time engineering students were trained in the new facilities.\n\nDiane Grannell, Principal of Bournemouth & Poole College said, “These new facilities will significantly improve our students’ learning. The upgrade means that we can offer a more modern working environment, allowing students to be fully prepared when moving into work. We are very thankful to Dorset LEP for supporting this investment.”"
