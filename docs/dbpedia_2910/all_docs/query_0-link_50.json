        "text": "An oil and gas technology company will lose a third of its staff due to what it said was \"deteriorating\" demand.\n\nHeatric, in Holton Heath, Dorset, announced 100 redundancies on Wednesday would affect manufacturing, administration and engineering staff.\n\nThe move has been blamed on a decline in demand over the past six months, a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe firm, which employs 310 people, began a consultation with staff on Monday.\n\nHeatric produces heat exchangers - devices which transfer heat between one or more fluids - for the oil and gas industry.\n\nGeneral manager Adrian Tattersall said: \"During the last six months... our core markets have continued to deteriorate and order intake has declined further.\"\n\nHe added despite best efforts, the company had \"no choice\" but to restructure and \"preserve our business for the long term\".\n\nGarry Suttle, leader of Purbeck District Council, in which Heatric is situated, said: \"We were aware that they were going to expand but because of the deteriorating gas and oil demand that has been put on hold.\"\n\nThe company said it would be offering voluntary redundancy packages and early retirement, but added enforced redundancies would be \"inevitable\".\n\nThe company is part of Meggitt PLC, which saw share prices plunge by 22% in October due to a slump in its energy operations.\n\nAs well as producing components for the oil and gas industry, the Meggitt group also builds parts for civil aviation."
