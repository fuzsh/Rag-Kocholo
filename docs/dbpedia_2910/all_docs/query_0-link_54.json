No reply to my letter sending details of work supposedly undertaken and reasons for not settling the £3. So many faults have arisen - Iam heartily sick of the poor results... Faulty connection again. The outside sign light has never worked properly since Meggitt's dealt with it. Outside light? Bathroom shaver point - dud. Scullery strip light? Dimmer switches v. poor.\" (2/6)",
