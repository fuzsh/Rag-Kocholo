        "text": "LONDON, 13 Jan. 2006. Defense and electronics group Meggitt PLC said three of its subsidiaries have won contracts on the second tranche of the Eurofighter Typhoon program worth 63.2 million pounds sterling.\n\nMeggitt Avionics has won a 34 million-pound deal to supply more than 1,000 air data transducers between now and 2012. It is the largest single order won by the division and follows its completion of more than 600 transducers for the first tranche of the project.\n\nDunlop Aerospace Braking Systems has received orders for Eurofighter's wheels, brakes, and braking systems estimated to be worth around 25 million pounds sterling.\n\nVibro-Meter UK, which designs and makes vibration monitoring systems for propulsion units for commercial aircraft, helicopters, military aerospace and industrial installations, received orders for engine temperature sensors and other products for the Eurofighter worth more than 4.2 million pounds sterling.\n\n\"We are delighted to secure these three contracts which further cement our position on Tranche II of the Eurofighter programme,\" said Meggitt chief executive Terry Twigger.\n\nThe first of the 620 Eurofighter Typhoons planned for the four partner nations was delivered in 2003 and more than 60 aircraft out of 148 in the first tranche of production have been delivered. Tranche two covers 236 aircraft.\n\nBased in Dorset, England, Meggitt PLC is an international aerospace, defence and electronics group with a consistent record of strong financial performance. Meggitt's goal is to increase its presence in long term growth markets through proprietary product development reinforced by strategic acquisitions and investment in people and facilities. Meggitt's well-balanced portfolio offsets variation in demand from the market niches within which it operates. For more information, see www.meggitt.com."
