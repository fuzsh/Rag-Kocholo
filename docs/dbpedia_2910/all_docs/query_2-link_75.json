        "text": "The business employs over 11,200 people in facilities across Asia, Europe and the Americas. They trace their history back 160 years to the mid-19th century and the pioneering of aviation instruments in hot air balloons, including the world’s first altimeter.\n\nOver the past four years, the business has secured increased contracts on a new generation of large civil aircraft. The value of the products that will be installed in each of these aircraft has increased between 50% and 250%. New products are being introduced at a faster rate than ever and given the demanding conditions the products exist within, R&D expenditure is at an all time high, totalling £158.7m in 2015, which represents 9.6% of turnover.\n\nThis is shown in the growth the company is going through, with new contracts being placed, and can be highlighted by the new contract with Pratt & Whitney’s PurePower engines to deliver thermal management sub-systems. The contract is worth around $1bn over the 40 year lifetime of the engine and aircraft programmes.\n\nThe Largest Advanced Manufacturing Development in a Decade\n\nManse Opus have delivered the first phase at Prospero Ansty for the new Meggitt ‘super-facility’ totalling 490,000 sq ft of accommodation for initially up to 1,000 people with the capability of doubling that figure.\n\nThis highly bespoke building delivers a state of the art headquarters and innovation centre at the heart of the UK’s manufacturing industry. The building allows Meggitt to consolidate the various elements of their specialist business into a single location and allows them to continue their business growth.\n\nThe building comprises a manufacturing hall in excess of 300,000 sq ft, principally for occupation by the various Meggitt business specialisms together with associated testing and logistics areas. Attached to the manufacturing hall is a two-storey state of the art office building providing up to 100,000 sq ft for occupation by various Meggitt divisions, including their new Head Office.\n\nFurther ancillary buildings on site are being provided for storage and other facilities of various materials.\n\nThe buildings are surrounded by lorry parking and turning areas, a 750 space car park and sympathetic landscaping, all combining to create a landmark building in a high quality business park environment.\n\nTestimonial from Meggitt’s Group Property Director, Jonathan Jones\n\n“We were lucky to engage with Manse Opus from the beginning of the project and we were given a single point of contact for a very complex and multifaceted building project.\n\nManse Opus had an expert team which gave us confidence that the necessary actions were taking place at the right time and this also built our trust in that team allowing our governance resource to consist of a fairly light touch. As you would expect from a complex project, with multiple stakeholders who might not always face in the same direction, there were often challenges on getting agreement and the Manse Opus team acted as an experienced intermediary during those tough conversations.\n\nManse Opus actively drove the project forward ensuring that the programme was robustly protected and bringing innovative solutions to the table where others might have hit an impasse.\n\nThe Manse Opus team’s sense of professional pride and energy was the single most contributing factor to the success of the project and even though the building is up and practical completion achieved they are still heavily involved in resolving some minor snagging issues. Experience shows that many developers would have taken the money and run at this point.\n\nI would not hesitate in appointing Manse Opus to lead such a project again in the future.”\n\n– Jonathan Jones, Group Property Director, Meggitt\n\nCadent, owners of the largest gas distribution business in the UK, is set to relocate a number of functions currently located in Hinckley, Coventry and Leicester to a brand-new purpose built building at Prospero Ansty from early 2022. The new building will improve the collaboration of teams across the current three sites and is being designed to facilitate a move to more flexible space to accommodate working arrangements\n\nThe site is being developed by Manse Opus and funded by the Lime Property Fund, managed by Aviva Investors. The new office building is let to Cadent Gas on a 25-year lease at an initial rent of approximately £2.12 million per annum subject to five yearly reviews linked to RPI with a floor and cap of 2% and 4% per annum.\n\nThe opportunity for Cadent to have a purpose-built office space, arose because of various leases expiring and the significant capital cost of renovating parts of the old site at Hinckley. This has allowed them to review and significantly improve their working environment through partnering with Manse Opus, who will create a bespoke c.90,000 sq.ft office building to occupy from early 2022.\n\nCadent have been very specific about the sustainable principles that need to be embedded within the design of the facility and wider development. The scheme is designed to meet BREEAM “Very Good” and fulfil the applicant’s aspirations to reduce carbon emissions. This will include: significant provision of photo voltaic panels both on the roof and incorporated into the brise soleil; rainwater harvesting; optimisation of natural lighting via a light well; significant provision of charging points; extensive landscaping and sustainable drainage systems. 80% off all fit-out materials are procured and manufactured from within a 100-mile radius and include an element of recycled content where possible.\n\nLocated 6 miles from Coventry city centre, Prospero Ansty offers a 200 acre Business Park which has the capability of accommodating 2,300,000 sq.ft of advanced manufacturing, research and office accommodation. The internationally recognised business park has proven popular with market leaders including several blue-chip companies.\n\nManse Opus is a collaboration between Edinburgh based Manse LLP and locally based Opus Land. The company was appointed by Rolls-Royce, who own and partly occupy the park, to lead development and regeneration of surplus land.\n\nThis deal will be one of the UK’s largest out of town office lettings and it is the second pre-let by Manse Opus having recently completed the new award-winning headquarters comprising a 495,000 sq ft building for Meggitt PLC, which was also funded by the Lime Property Fund. The success of Prospero Ansty to date is confirmation of the superior location and existing established infrastructure.\n\nRanjit Blythe, Chief of Staff at Cadent commented, “We are delighted to have found a location that allows us to remain broadly in our current geographical areas of Hinckley and Coventry which had been a specific feature of our search for new premises. Allowing our teams to work together more effectively in a modern and environmentally sustainable facility is important as we develop the Cadent brand.”\n\nRichard Smith, Managing Director of Manse Opus commented, “We are thrilled to be supporting Cadent in delivering their new purpose-built building at Prospero Ansty. The choice from Cadent to move their staff to Prospero is yet another affirmation of the site’s many strengths as it makes a name for itself as a location that market leaders gravitate towards. We are looking forward seeing the new Cadent building take shape over the coming eighteen months.”\n\nKris McPhail, Fund Manager at Aviva Investors, commented, “We are pleased to be involved in funding Cadent’s new office building at Prospero Ansty, particularly with the sustainable specifications being embedded within the building’s design. Not only will the use of local suppliers lower its carbon footprint during construction, the technology being installed will minimise energy and resource consumption through the life of the building. We believe this should deliver additional security to the long term cashflow this investment provides. These are exactly the type of investments we are actively targeting for the Lime Property Fund.”\n\nManse Opus were represented by JLL in the letting and investment sale. Avison Young acted on behalf of Cadent. Savills advised Aviva Investors.\n\nGateley Legal advised Manse Opus in documenting the transaction. Pinsent Masons acted for Aviva and CMS acted for Cadent."
