In 1902 The Pharmaceutical Journal: A Weekly Record of Pharmacy and Allied Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, reported the incorporation of the business and sale to W V S G Goodwin and F G Goodwin.\n\nThe Charles Massey Board members in the 1908 photo were, left to right, Tom Walton, William Gradwell Goodwin (Chairman), Harold J Cotes and William Cotes.\n\nWilliam Goodwin provided the capital, Tom Walton was recruited as the accountant & auditor and young Harold Cotes joined as Works Manager at Waterloo Works, Newcastle in 1904. Harold's father William Cotes joined in 1908.\n\nSir William V'Alters Summers Gradwell Goodwin (1862-1942) J P, was the Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, from 1913 to 1920s.\n\nThe Oil & Colour Trades Journal: Volume 57, 1920 - 'Mr W V S Gradwell Goodwin, Chairman of Charles Massey & Son has been knighted as one of the New Year's Honours', for services to his town, Newcastle-under-Lyme during the war.\n\nMore about this eminent Chairman came in 1925 from Whitaker's Peerage - Sir William V'alters Summers Gradwell Goodwin, Kt. Bach. (1920), JP and CC for Staffs, Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme 1913-19: b 1865 Res, Red Heath, Silverdale, Stoke-on-Trent; Westwood Manor, Wetley Rocks, Stoke-on-Trent.\n\nWilliam was the son of John Goodwin (1834-96) a Master Brewer from Braintree, Essex where young William was born in 1862. Sometime between 1871-81 the family moved to Newark and William became a managing partner in the brewing firm Messrs Caparn, Hankey & Co. The distinctive office range at the Castle Brewery, Newark was built for Caparn and Hanley in 1881. Later in 1885 the site was acquired by James Hole & Co.\n\nIn 1882 he established a new brewing business with his sons, Goodwin Bros at Balderton Gate, Newark. The operation was an outstanding success and was incorporated in 1891. The proceeds were invested in chemical manufacturing when brothers William & Fleming Gradwell Goodwin purchased Charles Massey & Son in 1902.\n\nJohn died in 1896 at the age of 63.\n\nWilliam Cotes (1855-1940) had been employed at Sheppy Adhesives Ltd in Queensborough, Kent where he had started up their glue business in 1887. William held the position of Glue Production Superintendent for many years and young Harold also joined the company for a short time before moving to Charles Massey & Son.\n\nInterestingly William Cotes was born in 1855, and married in 1875, in Kirkby, Nottinghamshire. He was working as a Coal Miner at the time but did he later get a job at the new Meggitt Factory built close by in 1873, just down the Low Moor Road to Hamilton Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield? When he moved from Kirkby to Market Harborough in 1880 he was only 24 and moved to a senior position at The Gallow Hill Glue Works as a Foreman. A job which required experience and skills in the bone business. Some six years later his expertise was in demand again and he took the job in Kent only to return to the Gallow Hill factory as a director of Masseys when Masseys took it over in 1908. It seemed William was a force in bones.\n\nIn 1910 Charles Massey & Son were advertising in Hardware Merchandising their 'Castle Brand Glue'.\n\nBy 1912, Kelleys described the company as a chemical works and in addition to Waterloo Works, there was a bone calcining mill at Sideway Mill, Longton, Stoke-on-Trent and offices at Glebe Buildings Stoke-on-Trent; 5 Milk Street, London EC and 36 Spring Gardens, Manchester. And Eilbecktal, Hamburg ... & they had also taken over a factory at Market Harborough - The Gallow Hill Bone Mill ...\n\nGallow Hill Bone Mills\n\nThe Gallow Hill Bone Mill was recorded on a 1886 map, north of Market Harborough on the Leicester & Northamptonshire Union Canal.\n\nIn 1980 in 'Yesterday's Town: Victorian Harborough', John Christopher Davies suggested -\n\n'The Gallow Hill Bone Mills were established by Robert Hubbard the son of a Harborough tallow chandler. There were several tallow chandlers in town but this trade, the making of candles from animal fat, had always been a smelly business. The bone mills were a development from this trade, but also smelly, so Robert Hubbard established his new works on Gallow Hill, more than a mile out of town; it was situated at the point where the road and canal met, so that he was able to take advantage of both for transport and water supply. In later years loads were also delivered from East Langton Station. The works attracted support from Harborough, and extended its range of products: when the place was burnt down by accident, its recovery was prompt, and although its title has been changed several times, it is still thriving'.\n\nIn 1872 the mill operator, Robert Hubbard, Artificial Manure Manufacturer was declared bankrupt. W & S Symington & Co took over and retained Hubbard as manager ... but it all ended in tears with a law suit in 1873.\n\nWilliam Symington, the new owner, had started business in Market Harborough by selling tea and groceries in 1827. The company website outlines the history of this celebrated company. By 1840 William was a wholesale grocer with a shop in Church Street. In those early years in 1855 William Symington patented a process for the preparation of pea flour. An advert appeared in 1862. Large quantities of it were supplied to the troops in the Crimea. Other patents followed and in about 1865 he was joined in the business by his son, Samuel. In 1889 William Symington died at the ripe old age of 89. The business had expanded rapidly and by the end of the century the first of the famous pea soup was marketed. In the 1900s the company widened its range to blancmange powder, table creams, granulated gravy improver, custard powder, jellies, fruit puddings and eight varieties of soups. Grandson, Howard Symington, joined the firm and in 1903 it was incorporated as William Symington & Co Ltd. In 1904 Symington supplied pea flour to Scott's first Antarctic Expedition. A splendid advert appeared in the Liverpool Daily Post in 1905. In 1909 Samuel Symington died aged 68, and Howard Symington (1876 - 1943) was left in sole charge. The firm was acquired by J. Lyons & Co in 1969'.\n\nIn 1895 The Gallow Hill Glue and Chemical Company Ltd was incorporated in 1896 to finance rebuilding after a fire. In 1897 The Gallow Hill Glue Company were advertising their manures and in 1900 they were selling the lease on their Leicester wharf and moving to their new head works at Gallow Hill. The company was up for sale in 1901 ... and eventually dissolved in 1908 when it was purchased by Charles Massey & Son.\n\n'Great Bowden, A History of the County of Leicestershire: Volume 5', Gartree Hundred (1964) -\n\n'North of Market Harborough, Great Bowden village lies on the south-east border of Leicestershire, about sixteen miles from Leicester. The glue factory at Gallow Hill on the western boundary of the parish was owned by Charles Massey & Son Ltd from 1908 until the firm's amalgamation with British Glues & Chemicals Ltd in 1920. The buildings lie beside the canal and on the line of the old turnpike road from Harborough to Leicester. The former Gallow Hill Inn, a brick building of the early 19th century, was used as a house and office by the company'.\n\nAn enthusiastic local historian of repute, Robert Hakewill has researched the Gallow Hill Wharf and provided detail of the early history of the site on the Leicester & Northamptonshire Union Canal and the Market Harborough to Leicester Turnpike. Also provided was a transcription of a report in The Market Harborough Advertiser which featured the diamond wedding of William Cotes and his wife Mary, of Knoll House, Leicester Road, Market Harborough. The report from 1935 described William's family, business career and his close association with Church and Council ...\n\nThe Times referenced the death of William Cotes in January 1940 and the death of Mary in November 1945.\n\nBob Hakewell also uncovered the splendid aerial photo of the Gallow Hill Works which was included in the book, 'Looking Back' published by The Harborough Mail in 2008. In 1898 The Market Harborough Advertiser published a short report on the installation of modern acetylene gas lighting at the bone works. Bob also transcribed a vivid description of the devastating fire of 1898 from The Advertiser and also an interesting article about the subsequent redevelopment of the works.\n\nIn 2010 the factory was still operating as part of the J G Pears group ... and still experiencing the old industry problems of smells and irate neighbours ... The Lutterworth Mail reported a fire at rendering plant on Monday 6 September 2010 -\n\n'A machine caught fire at a rendering plant on the outskirts of Harborough on Saturday. Fire crews from the town and several pumps from other stations were called out to J G Pears in Leicester Road at about 5.30pm. Sparks from a hammer unit were believed to be the cause of the blaze, which spread to a machine. Fire fighters used two jet reels and two breathing apparatus to put out the flames.\n\nThe factory has been embroiled in a long-running controversy over bad smells being emitted from the site. Fed-up people living nearby, on the A6 near the McDonald's roundabout, have complained to Harborough District Council about the smell which prompted the council to issue a warning letter to the company in 2008. JG Pears started operating at the Gallow Hill site in 2003 and it was previously the site of a glue factory.\n\nThe company receives animal fat and bones from butchers' shops and meat processing plants to be rendered so it separates into animal fat for use in soap and into meat and bone meal for pet food'.\n\nLongton Mill\n\nIn 1916 W V S Gradwell Goodwin purchased the Sideway Mill, Longton, as a bone grinding mill, although it appeared Masseys were operating the mill at least from 1912. The 1900 map of Staffordshire identified The Longton Mill, an ancient water mill, on the Longton Brook, west of Longton toward Hanford. The mill had been sold in 1860 and the catalogue gave a good flavour of the activities there, which included pottery materials. Flint, after kiln drying/calcining and grinding provided whiteness, hardness and inhibited the crazing of glazes and together with China Stone, feldspar, it was a valuable pottery material. Thomas & George Bakewell traded as The Longton Mills Company and they were grinding flint for the potteries in 1880. And by 1891 the company were also grinding bones. In 1894 George Bakewell retired and the partnership was dissolved. Clearly the Longton Mill was grinding bones long before Charles Massey took it over ...\n\nIn 1963 'Longton, A History of the County of Stafford' by William Page records the history of Sideway Mill -\n\n'Before 1212 the Lord of Longton, granted the Cockster-Longton Brook and the adjoining bank to the priory of Trentham âto the use of the mill upon the heathâ. Between 1277 and 1292 the priory was given the right to erect a mill anywhere within the manor of Longton and this mill may have been in place of the first. Nothing more is known of Longton mill until 1600 when a water mill was owned by John Hunt and then in 1774 it was bought by the Revered Obadiah Lane. The mill was worked by Obadiah Lane and Ambrose Smith as partners in flint-grinding. It was sold in 1778 to Sir John Edensor Heathcote. Later Richard Edensor Heathcote leased a flint mill and cottage in Longton to William K Harvey in 1847 on a 21 year lease. In 1867 John Edensor Heathcote leased the mill to James and Alfred Glover, who continued to use it to grind flint. In 1882 they surrendered the lease of the mill, by this date called Longton Old Mill, and it was immediately leased to Thomas and George Bakewell for ten years. By this date a drying kiln had been built there. The mill was leased in 1899 to Messrs J and E J Froggatt for five years. A further lease to the Froggatts for a period of seven years was made in 1904. The mill was sold in 1916 to W V S Gradwell Goodwin by J H Edwards Heathcote. By this date it was known as Sideway Mill (and occupied by Charles Massey & Son Ltd). Since 1920 the mill has been worked by British Glue and Chemicals Ltd as a bone mill. It is situated on the Longton Brook in the southwest of Longton at the junction of Poplar Lane and the bridle road from Longton to Hanford. There was formerly a large mill pool east of the mill which survived until at least 1898. The mill was still using water power until soon after the Second World War when the large water wheel, which was of the overshot type, was removed. Steam power also was used from at least 1930. The mill is now run by electricity'.\n\nMeggitts (1917) Ltd\n\nOriginally established in 1837, Samuel Meggitt (1812-??) was trading in 1839 at 36 Sycamore Street, in 1841 at 97 Duke Street, Sheffield, in 1856 at Effingham Road. Specialising in polished bone, horn and metal shirt buttons. By 1876 Samuel Meggitt & Sons, were at Sheffield Bone Mills, Effingham Road, Sheffield, and at Denaby, Mexborough, Rotherham, and at Hamilton Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire (see Trade Directories).\n\nSee - 'The Finance of Manufacturing Industry in the Sheffield Area. c. 1850-c. 1885' - Thesis submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Leicester by Lucy Newton. Department of Economic and Social History, University of Leicester, September 1993 -\n\n'In Sheffield producers of metals and metal goods as a group were the dominant employers. But the importance of trades concerned with horn, bone and related products might be less expected. The manufacture of horn and bone articles had developed as a result of the cutlery trades, horn being utilised for razor and knife handles and the waste products from this process went into button and comb making. Pearl, ivory and bone were also used to provide handles. The cutting and preparation of these materials led to the development of several even more specialist trades by the mid-nineteenth century: in the 1852 trade directory there are five separate trades concerning the cutting of horn, bone and ivory hafts and scales'.\n\nThe enterprising Meggitt family bone business was started by Samuel of Sheffield. His five sons entered the business. The eldest son William Thomas (1837-) started a business in Sutton-in-Ashfield, the second son Samuel (1849-) stayed in Sheffield, the youngest Arthur (1854-) started up in Denaby, Mexborough, Rotherham and the other two Joseph (1850-) & Harry (1853-) moved to Sutton-in-Ashfield where the Bone Manure business was a particular success.\n\nA trawl of the newspapers told an interesting story. An early report in 1850, when the company was still at Duke Street, concerned a con-trick as a couple of wide boys were trying it on. Perhaps it indicates that even in the early days Meggitts had earned a respectable reputation. Another report in the same year confirmed rogues and vagabonds were stealing bones. The name Roberts' was also indentified as Samuel Meggitts' partner? In 1857 the business advertised imported guano. Nitrate of Soda was an effective fertilizer, was commonly imported as guano from the coastal islands of Peru, Africa, Chile, and the West Indies. Guano was dried excrement of sea birds and bats; it contains about 6% phosphorus, 9% nitrogen, 2% potassium and moisture. Mixed with feathers and bones and it was an excellent fertilizer (Wikipedia).\n\nBy 1859 Meggitts were offering their customers alternative tillage for their fields ... ground bones. In 1860 the business was thriving and expert help was recruited to help with production.\n\nSamuel was a staunch Wesleyan and by 1862 as a successful business man he was fully immersed in Sheffield social life.\n\nIn 1866 embezzlement and in 1871 common theft suggested there was always something that was interrupting the smooth flow of business.\n\nThe 1871 offering was a better substitute for ground bones as the battle with rising prices raged. The 'substitute' was probably a superphosphate which was becoming popular around this time.\n\nThe 1871 Trade Directories included new Meggitt adverts. Reputation was everything when selling 'balanced' artificial manures, and Meggitts had a good reputation to defend. 1871 was also the first mention of factories at Sutton-in-Ashfield and Mexborough / Denaby. Business was looking good.\n\nIn 1873 Meggitts there was confirmation of a new expanded manufactory in Hamilton Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield. A bundle of papers from 1873-1898 survived from the Duke of Portland's estate relating to Samuel Meggitt & Sons Ltd. 73 items of paper & linen provide interesting bits of local history, as Samuel and his son William Thomas struggled with expansion of the bones & tillage business and the inevitable indictments concerning pollution of the water courses!\n\nIn 1873, of course, horses and carters were essential for raw material collection and product distribution, and this led to added problems and costs associated with stabling and welfare of the animals.\n\nAn advert confirming the three factories were in production appeared in The Sheffield Independent in 1875.\n\nBy 1876 Samuel Meggitt's experience and nous was further in demand this time by the Universal Permanent Building Society, in Sheffield. And a warehouse was purchased in Lincoln for local distribution of tillage.\n\nA company advert appeared in the Commercial Directory and Shippers Guide in 1879.\n\nIn 1881 a letter to the newspaper from the Denaby Main Collier Manager identified another of the problems the Meggitt business was facing ... excessive freight rates! The letter pinpoints the Meggitt factory at Denaby and clearly marked on the 1892 map was the Mexborough Bone Works directly across the rail road from The Denaby Main Colliery.\n\nGraham Oliver at The Mexborough & District Heritage Society suggested the bone mill was not operational until about 1879 -\n\n'The Denaby Pottery was founded about 1864 close to the southern bank of the river Don and like the Rock Pottery at Mexborough it was built on the site of a old quarry.\n\nThe pottery closed in about 1879, when the founder of the pottery and one of the partners, John Wardle, moved to Middlesbrough. The buildings were subsequently converted to a bone mill.\n\nDetails of the archaeological excavations are contained in 'Rediscovering Denaby Pottery' a report by Dr Richard A Gregory University of Manchester, February 2002'.\n\n1881 Kelly's directory of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire lists - Samuel Meggitt & Sons, Exchange Row, Mansfield; offices & works, Sutton-in-Ashfield; & at West Stockwith, Gainsborough.\n\nThe company's incorporation in 1893 was reported in The Chemical Trade Journal and also announced in The Sheffield Independent - the directors were -\n\nSamuel Meggitt (1849), Joseph B Meggitt (1850), Harry A Meggitt (1853), Arthur C Meggitt (1854), William M Meggitt (1860), George T Meggitt (1862). Inevitably some of the Meggitts weren't suited to the glue trade and went elsewhere, but Samuel (1812) would have been well pleased with this array of talent.\n\nIn 1896 a horrible accident was reported at the factory, health and safety were perpetual preoccupations.\n\nIn the same year the company was raising funds with a new issue. The prospectus summarised the company history & success -\n\n'Manufacturers of Fine Glues and Gelatines, Bone Crushers and Chemical Manure Manufacturers, Button Manufacturers, Cake and Seed Merchants and Agricultural Factors; Sutton-in-Ashfield and Effingham Road.\n\nEstablished in 1837 by the late Samuel Meggitt and registered as a Joint Stock Company in 1893.\n\nCurrent sales growth 73%. At the principle Sutton Factory an additional 6Â½ acres of land has been purchased. Capital for further extension of the business is now required'.\n\nBy 1900 it seemed the company was into fine glues & gelatines at Sutton-in-Ashfield and doing well.\n\nThe company issued new debentures in 1900 accompanied by enthusiastic business reports? The report indicated that in 1897 the glue & gelatine business of Messrs Bindley & son of Smethwick had been purchased and production transferred to Sutton. Perhaps ominously the proceeds were to be used to pay of debts and fund working capital ...\n\nIt all went horribly wrong. In 1902 Mr Joseph Bloom Meggitt went bust.\n\nThe old company was liquidated and two regenerated firms rose from the ashes. It appeared the Meggitt business had been split into two companies by the receiver in 1902 with different locations and specialisations, bone products at Sheffield and manures & glues at Sutton-in-Ashfield -\n\nSamuel Meggitt (Sheffield) Ltd - Â£5,000 registered capital. The Sheffield Telegraph reported the formation of a new small company specialising in buttons with Mr Samuel Meggitt as Managing Director. The World Paper Trade Review also noted Samuel Meggitt (Sheffield), Ltd had been registered to carry on the business of manufacturers and dealers in bone buttons, bone studs etc ... Samuel had escaped bankruptcy and emerged as head of a new company!\n\nSamuel Meggitt & Sons Ltd - Â£75,000 registered capital. The second company had an impressive prospectus. The Directors were James Neill, Steel Manufacturer; Thomas Townrow, Corn Miller; and Charles William Kayser, Manufacturer ... a trio of local business men, who sensed the inherent value of the Meggitt business and vowed to do better ... ? The Stock Exchange Year Book of 1908 reported Samuel Meggitt & Sons of Hamilton Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield was registered on 18th August 1903, in a reconstruction of a company of similar title, carrying on business as glue, grease and manure manufacturers.\n\nBy 1904 Joseph Bloom Meggitt had been discharged and no doubt retired gracefully to Wales. However a year earlier a far worse fate had overtaken Arthur Cockayne Meggitt ... the other Meggitt children ended up all over the world seeking new fame and fortune ... New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, China, India and Australia ...\n\nBut what happened to Samuel and the Effington Road business? It seemed this branch of the family fared better than the Mansfield crowd. Samuel Meggitt made an admirable living out of the original Sheffield business until 1951 when the company was voluntarily wound up!\n\nHector Marsh remembers his childhood in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire ... a piece of oral history about a small town in England 100 years ago. It was written in 1982 when he was 81. Included was an incident at the bone mill -\n\n'I remember the occasion when Meggitt's Bone Mill caught fire. It was a huge blaze. We were amongst a lot of people viewing the fire when we were forced a long way back by the Police. They said there was a big tank containing some sort of liquid which, if it became ignited, would cause a terrific explosion. We, of course, gave it a wide berth, and, fortunately, it didn't happen, but a lot of damage was done'.\n\nFactories are dangerous places and again in 1904 Meggitts had its share of tragic grief when young 21 year old Florrie Gregory lost her life ...\n\nMeggitt's Sheffield operation was also remembered during one of those memorable sessions of internet chat -\n\n'There are a couple of things on the 1905 map of Sheffield that jogged my memory. Salmon Pastures was virtually an island surrounded by the Don and the Royds Mill race. The building at the bottom of the map, identified as 'Bone Works', was owned by a company called Meggitts. My Father worked there after leaving school (1921-22) but left to learn a skilled trade elsewhere. They made buttons from the bones and two great uncles and my father's cousin worked there as bone cutters. I think Meggitts went out of business in the mid to late 1940s. At that time it was run by a Mr Clements who was also a well known local preacher'.\n\nIn 1907, L Lindley in 'History of Sutton-in-Ashfield' noted -\n\n'Messrs Samuel Meggitt and Sons, Ltd., manufacturers of fine glues and gelatine: Hamilton Road, Sutton-in-Ashfield; established 1837; number employed, 65 males, 65 females'.\n\nIn 1911 White's Directory listed Samuel Meggitt at The Bone Mills, Effingham Road, Sheffield.\n\nThe new owners at Sutton were not immune from difficulties and the plague of fire reappeared in 1912 ...\n\nIn 1917 S Meggitt & Sons Ltd were taken over by the controller of enemy businesses and a new company Meggitts (1917) Ltd was formed. The Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry recorded in 1918 - 'Samuel Meggitt & Sons, Ltd - In the Chancery Division on July 16, Mr Justice Younger heard the petition of the Board of Trade, under the Trading with the Enemy (amendment) Act 1916, for the winding up of Samuel Meggitt & Sons, Ltd. Mr J Austin Cartwell (for The Board of Trade) said the company was formed in 1903 to take over an earlier company in Nottingham, the business being that of chemical manure manufacturers. For a time the new company was successful, but in 1912 the business declined and in 1913 a German group, through a Belgian firm, obtained a controlling interest in it. The Board of Trade came to the conclusion that this was a company which fell within the terms of the Act of 1916, and ordered that the business should be wound up. This had now been done and the whole of the assets realised and the debits provided for. A new company, purely English, had been formed to take over the business under the title of Meggitts (1917) Ltd. His Lordship made the order'.\n\nIn 1917 The Oil & Colour Trades Journal: Volume 52 announced the new company - Meggitts (1917), Ltd - Reg No 148,186 - (r.c.) Â£100,000. (v) Â£1 ... (o) manure manufacturers and merchants, bone crushers and merchants, glue and grease manufacturers and merchants, etc, ... (d) R Duncalfe, Forge Mills, Bestwood Colliery, Nottingham; J E Grimditch, V H Poynter, E H Quibell, and G A Shankland. Dividends, Reports, Meetings, &c.\n\nThe new company was a pioneering forerunner of British Glues & Chemicals, the purpose was to counter German dominance of an important sector of the British chemical industry. D W F Hardie, in his review of the history of the chemical industry in 1966, explained the position -\n\n'The object was to present a united front against any German attempt to regain control of the glue & gelatine industry, which had been exercised pre-war through S Meggitt & Sons, which had been taken over in 1917 by the Controller of Enemy Businesses and sold to the group.'\n\nThe Directors of the new company were all significant players. Roger Duncalfe was from J & T Walker, up the road at Bestwood, and later became Chairman of BG&C. James Evans Grimditch was a butcher, founder of the Anglo American Cattle Products Company, a partner in The Weaver Refining Company and later a Director of Smithfield Animal Products Company. Ernest Hall Quibell was from Quibell Brothers in Newark and a future director of BG&C. George Archibald Shankland was from the old Meggitts company and destined to launch his own company G A Shankland Ltd a few years later. And Vernon Hamilton Poynter was a Director of John Knights of Silvertown, tallow renderers & soap makers and later in 1920 was also a Director of Smithfield Animal Products Company with James Grimditch.\n\nNotably William Lever held a stake in Knights from 1913 and held full control by 1920. Meggitts, Smithfield and Knights had important interconnections with BG&C apart from V H Poynter; Charles Wilson explained the situation at Knights -\n\n'Both supplies and sales centred on London. In the early days most of Knight's supplies came from London butchers - 'our butchers' - to whom on occasion the firm was willing to lend money. The trade was not elegant and local authorities relegated the carting of tallow, along with sewage, to the hours of darkness. No department of the business was more important than raw material buying: raw materials formed a large part of the cost of soap and largely determined its selling price. Soap makers were therefore in a mood to listen to any proposals for cooperation in the trade which would relieve their difficulties. In the scramble for supplies, the soap makers were less happily placed than the food manufacturers'.\n\nThe rationalisation of the industry was underway ...\n\nOn the 31 Dec 1919 the 6th Duke of Portland KG and his trustees Edward Horsman Bailey, Charles Ludovic Lindsay and Francis Bingham Mildmay sold two pieces of land on Hamilton Road in Sutton-in-Ashfield to Meggitts (1917) Limited, of Sutton-in-Ashfield, consideration, Â£550; mines and minerals reserved to the vendor and trustees. Plan attached shows the pieces of land lying on either side of Hamilton Road at its junction with Newark Road.\n\nIn 1920 a new company was announced in The Chemist & Druggist: Volume 92, 1920 - Smithfield Animal Products Company. Objective: to carry on, among other things, the business of manufacturers of and dealers in animal or poultry foods and medicines, manufacturing chemists, manufacturers of meat and other extracts, glue, gelatine, etc. The first directors are: J E Grimditch, A E Pitt, A Dalley, and V H Poynter. Head Office: Marshgate Lane, Stratford.\n\nIn 1920 The Institute of Chemistry, Journal & Proceedings noted the address of Edgar Stanley Downes, as c/o Messrs Meggitts (1917) Ltd, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts.\n\nAn interesting obituary appeared in the journal of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain & Ireland in 1933 -\n\n'Arthur John Shelton died at Minas de Rio Tinto, Spain, on 17th November, 1932, in his 55th year. Educated at the Mathematical School, Rochester, and at the Central Technical College, he obtained the diploma of Associate of the City of Guilds of London Institute in 1896 and continued in organic research for a year. In 1905 he held an appointment with Messrs Meggitt & Sons, Ltd, Glue Manufacturers, at Sutton-in-Ashfield'.\n\nIn 1944 the Journal of the Royal Institute of Chemistry reported -\n\n'Loxley Meggitt, who died in May, at Auckland, New Zealand, in his 71st year, was trained at University College, Nottingham, and became assistant, in turn, to F T Addyman, A H Allen and M J R Dunstan, Fellows, and after qualifying as an Associate of the Institute became technical and analytical chemist to Samuel Meggitt & Sons, Ltd, of Sutton-in-Ashfield, glue, gelatine and manure manufacturers.\n\nIn 1903 however he became manager of the works of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, Ltd, at Sydney, NSW, and in 1918 became manager of James Barnes, Ltd, of Alexandria, Sydney, NSW, manufacturers of linseed oil and cake, stearine, glycerine etc.\n\nIn 1920 he devoted his attention to fruit growing before retiring to New Zealand in 1932. He was elected an Associate of the Institute in 1895 and a Fellow in 1901'.\n\nA wonderful family story of life at Meggitts has been carefully researched by David Brown, who has discovered family treasures in an old tin box commemorating the Jubilee of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, 1863-1913.\n\nGreat grandfather Tom Brown and granddad Ted both worked for Meggitts at Sutton-in-Ashfield ... it seemed Tom knew the glue business inside out from hard experience in the bone factories and Tom served his time and became a engineer ... both moved around the Meggitts empire applying their skills and nous ... certainly Meggitts were enterprising employers of skilled operators and craftsmen and knew how to exploit their full potential ...\n\nQuibell Brothers Ltd\n\nThe Quibell family of Newark were of local renown.\n\nIn 1874 a new company appeared on the Newark scene. William Oliver Quibell (1833-1897) and Thomas Oliver Quibell (1844-1908) were in business as Chemists & Druggists, Cake & Tillage Merchants, Coal Merchants, Manufacturers of Chemical Manures and seed merchants at Castle Gate ...\n\nThe business was located bang next to the castle between Castle Gate and the Trent ... an old photo pinpointed the position of the factory adjacent to the castle itself.\n\nAn earlier company involving James Snow & John Harvey was dissolved in 1848 and John Harvey then went into partnership with his protÃ©gÃ© apprentice William Quibell, as Harvey & Quibell.\n\nAlthough the original Quibell business was at Castle Gate in 1883 there was a new factory off the Winthorpe Road just down the river as indicated on the 1886 map.\n\nThe 'Newark Advertiser' told the story in an obituary in 1897 -\n\n'William Oliver Quibell (1833-1897) was born at Gateford, near Worksop, in 1833 and was therefore nearing his 64th year. His family had been farmers for generations in the Newark area, but he was articled to Mr Harvey. Eight years later he became a partner in the firm, which was thenceforth known as Harvey & Quibell. The business was originally founded by the late Mr James Snow in 1814. On the death of Mr John Harvey the style was changed to Quibell Brothers, Mr Thomas O Quibell having joined some years previously. Two sons of Alderman Quibell have since entered the business. The deceased was a Wesleyan Methodist and had filled most of the offices open to a layman in that Church. For a number of years he was a lay reader and a class leader. He had been Circuit Steward and at the time of his death was district Treasurer of the Foreign Missionary Society. He was elected a representative to the conference held at Bradford in 1878, the first to which laymen were admitted. Three times since, he was one of the 18 laymen chosen by the Conference itself to be members of the Representative Session. To the last, he took the deepest interest in the work of the Church. The new Sunday Schools which the Wesleyans are going to build were constantly in his mind during the last part of his life, and he gladly contributed towards the cost. He was for years a prominent member of the School Board of the Board of Guardians, a member of the Town Council and an Alderman. In 1884 he was chosen Mayor. Appointed a JP for the Borough some years ago, he frequently attended the Bench, always administering Justice with impartiality and tempering it with mercy. Since his death, the Town Hall flag has been at half-mast, also those at the Ram Hotel and on other buildings in the town. Under a memorial window in Barnby Gate Methodist Church is the inscription - 'To the glory of God and in loving memory of William Oliver Quibell, Mayor of Newark 1884-5, this window is dedicated by his daughter Eleanor Mary Bainbridge.' He was a devout Christian and an earnest Wesleyan Methodist, who served his Church faithfully in every lay office'.\n\nOliver Quibell (1863-1945) was the eldest son of William Oliver Quibell and Eleanor Boyd Berrie who was born on 27th October 1863 and baptised on 30th November 1863 at Barnby Gate Wesleyan Church. On 9th November 1906 he was appointed a Borough Magistrate -\n\n'A prominent Liberal and nonconformist, a member of the Education Committee & the Free Library Committee, he has represented the East Ward for three years. He is a partner of Quibell Bros. and Vice President of the Newark Division Liberal Association. In November 1907, and again a year later he was elected Mayor. Kelly's 1912 Directory lists him as Councillor, East Ward (retires November 1914) and Magistrate'.\n\nBy the early 1900s Quibell's Barley Manure was a particular favourite.\n\n1905, March 8 - 'About ten minutes past six on Monday night a fire was found to have broken out at Messrs Quibell Bros' (Ltd) works, Newark, near the bottom lock. The attention of Mrs Barlow, wife of Mr J Barlow, foreman of the works, who lives close by, was attracted. Without delay she communicated with Mr Oliver Quibell, who was on the premises, and with all speed a hose, was attached to a hydrant. Information was also conveyed to the police station by means of the telephone, and the fire bell was rung and the brigade summoned. So well had Mr Quibell and his helpers worked that the brigade found the fire well under control and without much difficulty all danger of a conflagration was avoided'.\n\nThe North East Midland Photographic Record has some great pictures. One was of an original Quibell cart! The side of the cart read 'Quibell Brothers Ltd Newark', with the cart designated 'no. 5' on the underside. Was this a collection cart for supplies of raw bones or more interestingly a sheep dipping cart? Quibells manufactured sheep dips and The Pastorialist's Review published an account of a visit to the factory in 1908. The report mentioned the provision of an equipment service which consisted of a dipping bath which was carried on a horse drawn cart, the cart itself was a portion of the apparatus which acted as a drainer after the immersion of the sheep. All part of Quibell's product innovations.\n\nAt the time the Quibell business produced a range of agricultural interests apart from sheep dips ... animal feed merchants, bone crushers & chemical manure manufacturers.\n\nIn 1912 The British Journal of Nursing reported - 'The Ideal Homes Exhibition at Olympia, Stand 35a is that of Messrs Quibell Bros Ltd whose Disinfectant Fluid, 'Kerol' is attracting such widespread attention owing to its high efficiency and non-toxic properties. To judge from the interesting exhibits of this firm the Stand should be well worth a visit'.\n\nKerol disinfectant, was advertised as the safeguard of the Englishman's home, manufactured by Quibell Brothers Limited (later Kerol Ltd.). The disinfectant was promoted regularly and claimed to be effective against diphtheria, measles, cholera, scarlatina, typhoid, skin irritation (used in bath water), nits, as a gargle for sore throat and as a shampoo. One illustration showed a well-dressed elderly man in a top hat and bow tie smiling at the bottle of Kerol he is holding in his right hand, orange background behind him. The text is red out of a purple border around it with a white cross inside a circle at the top.\n\nAfter the formation of BG&C in 1920, a new company, Kerol Ltd, was formed in 1921 to take over the business of makers of sheep and cattle dips, disinfectants, toilet and medicinal preparations carried on by Quibell Bros, Ltd, together with the right to use the trade marks 'Kerol' 'Fumiform' 'Novol' and 'Quibell' and to enter into a deed of assignment and covenant with Quibell Brothers Ltd (vendors), O Quibell, W E B Quibell, E H Quibell and T H Lloyd.\n\nErnest Hall Quibell (1876-1926) died in Newark in 1926; a significant event which was reported in the Nottingham Evening Post ...\n\nLike all other factories handling potentially hazardous materials, Quibells had their share of problems, as The Times reported in 1927. However profitable companies with trained motivated staff were better able to cope and invest in Health & Safety procedures; well done William Lloyd and Frank Boot. At Quibells, safety was never seen as an alternative to profit but as a contributing factor.\n\nIn 1951 Quibells featured in a superb aerial photo ... The British Glues and Chemicals Ltd Quibell Bros Glue Factory (Croid Glues), Newark-on-Trent, 1951.\n\nIn 2002 John Sutton provided a splendid photo of the remains of Quibell's factory on the other side of the Trent from under Fiddlers Elbow Bridge from 1915. He recalls the factory began in the 1860s as a manufacturer of bone fertiliser, cattle cake and sheep dip, later branching out into glue and cosmetics as part of British Glues and Chemicals.\n\nIn Michael Vanns' book 'The Railways of Newark-on-Trent' (Oakwood Press), Sid Rising recalled working as a 15-year-old railwayman in 1943, 'I started taking the numbers of the wagons in the sidings of Quibell's factory which processed animal hide and skin into cosmetics. The wagons were loaded with rotting meat and bones which were accompanied by thousands of maggots and a pungent smell. Taking numbers consisted of walking on a carpet of maggots, stamping your feet to scare away any rats, tucking your hand lamp under your arm and holding your breath for quite a few minutes. This was quite an experience on a dark winter's morning and perhaps one of the main reasons the lady number takers did not work these hours'.\n\nMr Vivian F Suter was born in 1925 and joined Quibell Brothers as a lab assistant at Easter 1941, he was in charge as Works Manager when the Newark Factory was closed and demolished in 1976. He has recently been writing up his personal memories which are a fascinating insight into the factory at Newark ... here's Vivian receiving a certificate from Harry Thompson, Wigan & Newark Works Director ...\n\n'The Quibells of Newark' by Mr G Hemingway, 1980. This typescript publication has a section on The early Quibells of East Markham, Profiles on William Quibell of Newark (1805-1883) and some of his descendants. (It is currently available in the Newark Library, Nottinghamshire and is also in the Nottinghamshire Family History Society library collection).\n\nVivian also remembers a fellow chemist at BG&C, Walter Denwood ... a true gentleman!\n\nGrove Chemical Co Ltd\n\nIn 1906 The World's Paper Trade Review volume 45, reported a jubilee -\n\n'A BUSINESS JUBILEE - The Grove Chemical Company of Appley Bridge near Wigan celebrates this year its jubilee. The firm was founded at Church, near Accrington, by the late Mr John Haworth in 1856. Subsequently the business passed into the hands of Mr Haworth's two sons who are still at the head of affairs, although the concern was registered as a private limited liability company in 1893. It is satisfactory to find that the business has been one of continual progress, particularly marked since the removal to ...'\n\nIn 1856, the same year that John Haworth (1824-98) started his business at Church, John Everth (1784-1859) had a bone works at Appley Bridge and he employed a Mr Reuben Haworth as his agent. Reuben Haworth (1813-62) was a relative of John Haworth ... he was his elder brother!\n\nJohn Everth appeared to be quite successful with agents selling his manure locally in Burnley and further afield in Liverpool, Kendal, Lancaster and Kidderminster. The name Squire Scaresbrick was also reported to own the bone manures business at Appley Bridge.\n\nIn 1856 Reuben Haworth was named the proprietor of the Appley Bridge bone manure works ... but in 1857 John Everth was reported to be the proprietor of the Apply Bridge bone manure works. This was undoubtedly the same buiness. The business appeared to prosperous and a celebratory dinner was held in Poulton for the satisfied customers.\n\nThe same year the business was running out of raw materials and was on the look out for imported bones. In the same year he had some trouble in court. Prices were reduced in 1859? Just before John Everth died?\n\nThe 1851 census recorded John Everth with wife Sarah and a domestic servant at Finch Mill House, Shevington. John's occupation was concerned with a 'White Lead Works'. Interestingly a substitute for the 'white lead' pigment was bone white ... made from ground calcined bones ...\n\nJohn Everth died aged 75 at Shevington and was buried on the 15th of July 1859 at St Wilfrid, Standish.\n\nIn 1860 Charles Scarisbrick (1802-60) of Scarisbrick Hall, Scarisbrick, an extensive land & colliery owner and filthy rich, also died and the bone business at Appley Bridge was up for sale ... described as The Appley Bridge Works, situate close to the Apple Bridge Station and immediately adjoining the Leeds Liverpool Canal ... including White Lead Works and a Bone Manure & Bone Charcoal Manufactory ... this was surely the factory site that became The Crown Works ... this was John Everth's business that was purchased by the Haworths? This was this the date the Haworths moved to Appley Bridge?\n\nThe Haworth family of Oswaldtwistle were mesmerisingly numerous and complex, but for sure John Haworth (1825-98) was the father of brothers Herbert & Walter of Appley Bridge and in the 1861 census John was at Vine House as a Chemical Manufacture and in 1871 he was into cotton at Brookside Mill, see the 1892 map.\n\nAt some stage the business established in 1856 moved their Grove Chemical Works to Appley Bridge, Wigan where they produced animal glue, bone meal and tallow.\n\nThe 1881 edition of Worrall's Wigan & District Directory, indentifies The Appley Bridge Chemical & Manure Works.\n\nBy 1893 under the guidance of Herbert Haworth, senior partner, and his brother Walter, junior partner, The Gove Chemical Co and their Crown Works, at Appley Bridge established a formidable reputation. An article in The Worlds Paper Trade Review confirmed that -\n\n'At Appley Bridge glue and size making was well understood and efficiently carried out ...'\n\nIn 1895 The Chemist & Druggist reported the incorporation of the Haworth business. The subscribers were Mr & Mrs Herbert Haworth and Walter Haworth of Grove House, Apply Bridge, Mr & Mrs J B Cooper (sister & brother in law) and Mrs J Haworth of 29 Scarisbrick Street, Southport (mother). Old man & father John Haworth was to die in 1898.\n\nA snippet from 1898 in The Worlds Paper Trade Review revealed -\n\n'The Grove Chemical Co Ltd of Crown Glue Works, Appley Bridge, near Wigan, advise us of a change in their Manchester address. Their offices have been removed from 20 Cross Street to 71 Haworth's Buildings, Cross Street'.\n\nBy 1899 the same journal reported -\n\n'The Grove Chemical Co Ltd - The specialities of this firm, owing to their reliable quality, have obtained an excellent reputation amongst papermakers and others. The growth of the business, under the management of Messrs Haworth, have necessitated larger works, and new buildings have lately been erected in order to meet the growing demand for the firm's make of glue'.\n\nAlso in 1899 The Crown Works of The Grove Chemical Company at Appley Bridge were applying science to the manufacture of size and exploiting the latest technology to provide their customers at the paper mills with high quality products at low cost. The World's Paper Trade Review reported that competition for patented technology was fierce.\n\nIn 1902 The Grove Chemical Company were advertising for a firm to represent them and their gelatines in the south in Luton.\n\nIn 1907 Herbert Haworth joined the Manchester Chamber of Commerce; no doubt doing his bit to keep the wheels of trade well lubricated.\n\nThe 1908 map of Wigan marked the 'Crown Works'. The site was on the famous Leeds & Liverpool Canal which stretched over a distance of 127 miles, there were 91 locks as it crossed the Pennines before it linked into the Liverpool docks system.\n\nA fine aerial photo of the site from the 1940s came from on line Mario Maps at Your Lancashire.\n\nIn 1909 a 'Coming of Age' was celebrated at Appley Bridge. The dates were significant and pointed to 1856 for the founding of the original business in Oswaldtwistle and 1888 as the date of the Haworth investment in Appley Bridge.\n\nIn 1910 the company were advertising their glues in the trade journal Hardware Merchandising.\n\nRuss Mason's family had connections with the Apply Bridge Works, just about everyone in his family worked there, between them they accumulated 358 years of service. In the late 1960s Croda published a two page tribute to 'the Masons' as a centre spread in one of their pamphlets / house magazines, a copy was recently unearthed by Russ from some dusty archive ... what a treasure of family history ...\n\nJohn Mason (1839-) the old man of the Mason family at Appley Bridge was born near Evesham in 1839 and married a local girl Mary Gregg (1852-) in 1875. In 1877 the family moved up to Wigan in search of work. Initially John Mason found work in a brick yard in Parbold and the work proved good enough to attract Mary's brother Edward (1851-) who also found a job there. The 1881 census confirmed Edward joined the family as a lodger in the 'Cottage' in Parbold. They had a child Joseph (1876-), when living in Worcestershire; and further births followed in Lancashire; Emma (1877-), Florence (1879) and twins Herbert (1881-) & Samuel (1881-) had now been added to the family. By 1891 John and youngsters Joseph & Emma were all employed at the Appley Bridge Glue Works.\n\nA great great granddaughter of John Mason (1839-), Audrey Bradburn, has found a wonderful photo of the staff from the Crown Works, Appley Bridge from 1914-15. No one on the photo has yet been identified ... help!\n\nHere are some of the Mason memories from Herbert's grandson Russ -\n\nRuss' dad, Sydney, worked for 16 years at Appley Bridge until 1957. He took the photo of the factory in the 1930s from a glass plate found at the back of an old drawer in the plant office during a visit just before it was demolished around 1972. He also remembers Bill Rigby who worked in the boiler room at the 'Bone Works' until he retired around 1965. He worked with a fellow by the name of Len Edley who was tragically killed on the job. Bill had a brother Jack Rigby who worked in the stores department. There were 97 workers at the works in the fifties including several Rigbys. Up until 1920 Sydney thought that the factory was owned by the banks before it was bought by the group of BG&C investors.\n\nThe animal waste processed included some surprisingly exotic beasts including train loads of camels from Egypt! More specialised products were also produced like edible gelatine for the food industry and buttons for the Lancashire garment industry made from sawn bones.\n\nSteam raising from coal fired Scotch Marine Boilers was at the heart of the rendering process. The tall chimneys dominating the site were designed to disperse smoke and objectionables far and wide. But the stacks retained clinker & debris which had to be manually cleared via long suffering operators in bosun's chairs. Adding yet another twist to the mucky smelly working conditions ... today's Health & Safety inspectors would have had a field day!\n\nRuss' granddad, Little Bert, started working at the plant in 1900 and remained there for 48 years. Around 1920 he was offered a Directorship for an investment of Â£100. A lot of money in those days which he did not have, so he ended up working on the benzene 'ponds' which were used for cooling the glue pellets. These were large open vats that were a considerable hazard for both the workmen and equipment.\n\nOn the 23rd of August 1921 'The Times' reported that a fire at Appley Bridge caused damage estimated at Â£20,000.\n\nOf course industrial accidents were not confined to bone works. Russ remembers Charlie Haywood got killed in an industrial accident at the Lino Works just down the road from the 'Bone 'ole', the Appley Bridge nick name for BG&C factory. The 'Lino Works' was formed in 1898, the business of Thomas Witter and Co Ltd, manufacturers of floor cloth and linoleum. In 1924 the company was bought by Rylands & Sons of Manchester. In 1932, an agreement was made between Rylands and the S.A. des Papeteries de Genval, Belgium, manufacturers of felt base floor coverings. Each took an equal holding in Witter, and a paper mill and felt base factory were opened in addition to the existing linoleum works. In 1953, Rylands sold all but 5 per cent of its interest to the Belgian concern.\n\nIn 2013 Irwin Mitchell Solicitors issued a news release. They continued to pursue compensation claims associated with the industrial use of benzene in the 1960s.\n\nSuspected benzene cancer victim seeks justice.\n\nA former fitter who has been diagnosed with a blood cancer is appealing for former colleagues to come forward to help with an investigation into the dangerous chemicals he was exposed to at work. Michael Fernay, 65, from Shevington, Wigan was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a cancer of the blood cells, during March this year. He now needs a blood transfusion around every two weeks. He believes the illness was caused by exposure to benzene, a known carcinogen linked to blood cancers, whilst working as a fitter. Michael worked for British Glue & Chemicals at their Appley Bridge site in Wigan between 1964 to1973. It is during this employment Michael believes he came into contact with benzene, when he worked in what had previously been the benzene plant. He recalls being asked to remove pipe work on several occasions from the benzene plant for it to be used elsewhere in the factory. 'I remember the pipework I worked on being covered in benzene residue,' he said. 'Sometimes there was still benzene fluid in the pipes I was removing which spilt onto my overalls and hands. During my time working at the plant I donât remember ever being supplied with protective clothing or given warnings about coming into contact with benzene.' He is no longer able to work because of the high risk of contracting further illness and infection, placing a huge financial burden on the family. He is being represented by Katrina London of law firm Irwin Mitchell. 'Michaelâs exposure to the chemical benzene could be the cause of his painful and life limiting disease,' she said. 'Exposure to benzene was known to be dangerous when Michael was employed by British Glues and Chemicals and not providing Michael with the relevant protection is simply unacceptable. We would urge anyone who may have worked for British Glue & Chemicals during the mid-60s to the mid-70s at the Appleby site, to come forward with further information about the working conditions that Mr Fernay faced.' British Glue & Chemicals was acquired by Croda International in 1968.\n\nWilliamson & Corder Ltd\n\nThe Williamson & Corder factory at Low Walker, Newcastle-on-Tyne, in the North East was founded by Robert Williamson and Walter Corder in 1893.\n\nRobert Williamson was an eminent academic scientist who wrestled with the complex factory production of alizarin dyestuffs from coal tar. Alizarin - 1,2-dihydroxyanthraquinone - 'Turkey Red'- became the first natural dye to be synthetically duplicated in 1868 by the English dye chemist William Henry Perkin who independently discovered the same synthesis at the same time as the German BASF. Williamson was involved in the Perkin Dyeworks on the Grand Union Canal at Greenford and the technology of factory life must have suited him as had several production positions including a stint at Messrs Nelson, Dale and Co before settling into gelatine production in his own company with Walter Corder.\n\nWalter Corder served his apprenticeship as a chemist with his uncle and studied chemistry at the renowned Armstrong College in Newcastle.\n\nThese guys were scientists, intent on the application of science in factory production. No wonder British Glues & Chemicals welcomed their company into the 1920 amalgamation and appointed W S Corder as the first Chairman of the Board.\n\nEnterprise in the North East started in 1888 when Walter Corder invested in the new manufactory of Messrs Corder & Co, for converting fish refuse from the local Fish Quay into fine manure; similar to Peruvian Guano which was all the rage at the time. The factory was at Low Lights along Tanners Bank within the premises of the tannery of Messrs J R Proctor & son of Low Lights, and included extensive deodorising and disinfectant facilities to minimise nuisance. The Riverscape Project in 2001 outlined the significance of the Low Lights trading centre -\n\n'The mouth of Pow Dene is now North Shields Fish Quay and it has always been the first safe harbour on the north side of the river. Here two ancient light houses stand each side of the Fish Quay inlet marking the line of the channel into the Tyne, one stands close to sea level the other on a cliff above. The 'low lights' have long been an important landing and trading point. This would have started with salmon and coal, salt and grain. One of the first Tyne railways, the Chirton to North Shields waggon way was opened in 1769 along the side of the Dene. A little later the strategic location of the Low Lights with its command of the river mouth was recognised by the building of Clifford's Fort during the Napoleonic Wars. Northumberland Park is the upper section of the Dene which is separated from the River and North Shields by a large embankment which crosses the Dene to carry Tynemouth Road and the Newcastle to Tynemouth Railway. The lower part of the Dene is now known as Tanners Bank and the Low Lights. From about 1870 an extensive herring fishery had developed using Fish Quay as a base. The herrings were kippered at the quay - split open, gutted and salted, then smoked over oak chips or sawdust to produce kippers. A Newcastle man, John Woodger, claimed to have invented the process'.\n\nThe SiteLines Project recorded, The North Shields Chemical Works (Fish Guano) -\n\n'A fish guano works was established here by WS Corder in the 1880s on previously undeveloped ground north of the brewery (HER 5485) and west of the Pow Burn. In 1889 it was said that very little Peruvian guano was used in Tyneside, although fish remains mixed with other agents was used to some extent. The impression is that this was a small scale industry. The chemical works expanded in October 1888, with a blacksmith's shop, refuse room, medicinal oil room and deodorising room added to the west side of the complex (TWAS CB/Ty/15/32). In 1892 another square building was added (TWAS CB/Ty/15/36)'.\n\nLife at Low Lights was not easy either and despite the promised nuisance abating facilities, in 1899 Messrs Corder & Co were in trouble. And further extensive improvements were required in 1902 to satisfy the magistrates.\n\nIn 1893 the partnership with Robert Williamson at Low Walker was launched as a new venture; the fish processing continued separately at Low Lights. Williamson & Corder announced the 'new industry' in 'fine chemicals' in a letter to the Local Board. The factory was the old Tyne Boiler Works site by the Walker Ferry. The splendid photo of the 'Walker Bone Yard' was from Norman Dunn. Billy D & Norman Dunn, who's old Aunt used to work in the offices at the Bone Yard tell the story -\n\nFreddy Shepard and his brother expanded a road haulage business into a series of marine and related businesses; and property redevelopment of the former ship building facilities along the river. Shepard Offshore now occupy the site of the old Bone Yard. Freddy Shepard achieved fame as the owner of Newcastle United F C along with Sir John Hall.\n\nAbout 2001 the buildings were used as a timber yard, and the sawdust room was next to one of Shepard's offices, and any cars parked outside used to get covered in dust. The owner asked us to 'plug up ALL the gaps an stop the sawdust escaping', we did this and less than a week later pressure built up inside and blew the wall down; then EVERYTHING was covered in sawdust. There was a Garage at the back of the yard that housed, a Bentley, Ford Model T, Rolls Royce and a Daimler, all vintage cars, I believe belonging to Mr Freddy Shepard. Not long after the wall came down there was a fire and the yard buildings were pulled down. I often wonder if the cars made it or got destroyed in the fire!\n\nFactory life in 1896 was not easy, working conditions were dire and horrible accidents were an ever present prospect and sometimes a shattering reality, as the Shields Daily Gazette recorded.\n\nIn 1902 The World Paper Trade Review Volume 37 reported the incorporation of the company - 'Williamson & Corder Ltd were to acquire the business carried on at Walker-on-Tyne, Northumberland, as Williamson & Corder, and adopt an agreement with R Williamson & W S Corder, and to carry on the business of manufacturers of and dealers in gelatine, glue, grease, oil, alkalis, soaps, chemicals etc'.\n\nIn 1904 Walter Corder sold his business at Low Lights and the North Shields Fish Guano & Oil Co Ltd was incorporated under new management. The seven new subscribers were all fish merchants and curers, no doubt keen to ensure the waste from their businesses was profitably disposed of ... and, perhaps, as a 'service' to their main curing business they would have some clout with the authorities over the ongoing nuisance problem. Wishful thinking ...\n\nIn common with all their peers, the factory at Low Walker, Newcastle also earned its share of opprobrium.\n\nIn 1915 the Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions published Robert Williamson's obituary. He left a will identifying George Edward Shawcross as the secretary of Williamson & Corder Ltd. George Shawcross became a Director of BG&C in 1920.\n\nGeorge Edward Shawcross (1878-) was the son of a coal miner from Seghill, in 1891 he was living at Wallsend, and in 1901 was a Railway Clerk at 11 Meldon Terrace, Heaton, Newcastle. By 1911 George had married Nelly in 1906 and they were living at 50 Falmouth Road, Heaton with a son Edward Leslie (1907-) and daughter Mary Elizabeth (1909-). George was now Secretary to Chemical Manufacturer ... he was keeping the books at Low Walker. George Shawcross retired from the BG&C board in 1934.\n\nWilliamson & Corder were the only prospective subsidiary company of BG&C to advertise their wares in the 1919 British Chemical Manufacturers directory of members.\n\nIn 1920/9 the Gazette announced the voluntary liquidation of Williamson & Corder ... was that all about the BG&C amalgamation?\n\nThe chat on the internet reveals something of the working conditions at the Walter Corder's 'Fish Works' and Williamson & Corder's 'Bone Yard'. In 1900, when Edward Hindley was starting his Acton Bridge factory, the work was somewhat 'juicy' ... but where's there's muck there's brass! ... these businesses were to become chemical refining businesses with ready markets for many different and valuable products ... and the Fish Quay at North Shields is now a 'conservation area' ...\n\nRobert Williamson and Walter Corder had a passion for chemistry and were keen to keep close to the science of their trade. In 1941 Williamson & Corder Ltd continued the tradition of their founders and cooperated with local cancer research - see - 'The Citric Acid Content of Animal Tissues, with Reference to its Occurrence in Bone and Tumour' by Frank Dickens, from the Cancer Research Laboratory, North of England Council of the British Empire Cancer Campaign, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne (Received 1 September 1941) - 'I am greatly indebted to Mrs C M Burns for bone specimens and analyses; to Mr T W Smith of Messrs Williamson & Corder, Newcastle, for information about bone meal and for a gift of this material; to the Pathology Department, University of Durham, for the use of their photometer; and to the Physicians & Surgeons of this Hospital for clinical material'.\n\nJ & T Walker (1917) Ltd\n\n'A Place Like Papplewick' describes the history of the old mills on the River Leen and one of them, Forge Mill, had a remarkable pedigree -\n\n'Water powered mills have existed along the River Leen in the parishes of Papplewick and Linby since at least 1232. By 1615, iron refining was underway at Bulwell Forge, otherwise known as Forge Mill, which once stood in Papplewick parish. This mill consumed vast quantities of local timber which was turned into charcoal. There is evidence that the timber being taken for use at Bulwell Forge accounted for much of the destruction of Sherwood Forest during the 17th and 18th centuries. Iron continued to be worked here until at least 1773 and after that the Mills along the Leen began to proliferate for the processing of cotton.\n\nIn 1776 George Robinson arrived, he created a manufacturing empire, establishing six mills including Castle Mill, Grange Farm, Middle Mill and Forge Mill, driven by water power, and providing jobs for 800 people. Water shortages and a wrangle over water rights with landowner Lord Byron, the poet's great uncle, forced Robinson to find alternative means of powering the mills. In 1785, he installed a steam engine at Grange Farm invented by James Watt - the first to be used in a cotton mill anywhere in the world.\n\nHad the railways come to the area in time, the Leen Valley could have become the centre of the cotton industry but, through lack of infrastructure and various legal disputes, the Robinsons abandoned the trade and turned to banking. In July 1828, cotton spinning came to a halt due irreconcilable differences between the proprietors, a dispute that dragged through the courts until 1830. Thereafter, the mills lay empty and largely deserted. All but Castle Mill and Forge Mill were dismantled in the 1840's and the materials used to construct new farm buildings, examples of which remain at West View and Forest Farms'.\n\nInterestingly this was a story of what could have been. Way back the torrents that poured down the Pennines into the Leen were harnessed for power, and for sure there would have been corn to grind, wool to full and iron to forge ... part & parcel of the ubiquitous rural development which took place wherever there was water power ... and unsurprisingly iron forging on the Leen would have enjoyed an extra fillip from the plentiful supply of charcoal from Sherwood Forest.\n\nGeorge Robinson (1712-98) came from Kincardineshire and settled at Bulwell in 1737. Originally, Robertson, George adopted the English name of Robinson and rather late in the industrialisation day went to work to hit the Leen VAlley with the industrial revolution.\n\nRobinson initially used the soft water of the Leen to bleach linen and not to drive water wheels. Lance Day in The History of Technology 1996, described how Robinson, after accumulating some capital, was prepared in 1777 to risk investment in the cotton boom where water power was needed. The Papplewick Mills were built in 1777, and the Forge Mill in 1787. But unlike the more welcoming stance of the landowners at Baptist Mills copper in 1702, Derby silk in 1702 Gadlys lead in 1704 and Coalbrookdale in 1706, Robinson had endless wrangles with the Byrons and the Montagus over access to water rights for his sophisticated water supply system at the very same time as James Watt produced his energy breakthrough. Robinson seized the opportunity and installed his steam engine in 1785, this was the same year that Daniel Whittaker abandoned his plans to invest in a cotton mill at Acton Bridge in favour of the 16ft head of water in the Greenfield Valley. It seemed the search for useful water power was widespread, but entrepreneurs like the Robinsons were alive to James Watts alternative ... others were soon to follow ... and it was the un-enterprising landowners who lost out because squabbling over the spoils in a zero sum game was far less rewarding than pursuing the synergies of co-operation ... and it was Robinson who became a banker as comparative advantage started to ebb away from manufacturing and into financial services ... ?\n\nOn the Nottinghamshire History Website Andy Nicholson and Robert Mellors indentified Charles Allcock as a large employer of labour in the area. He resided in a house at the northern end of Bulwell village. Adjoining the house was a large corn mill, and Charles started milling at Forge Mill. In 1844 he was described as being a miller, bleacher, bone crusher and farmer. The Derby Mercury detailed some history of the mill in a report of fire in 1841. The Leicester Chronicle described Allcock as an extensive factor. He died in 1860, and in the local church a memorial window was constructed for him.\n\nIn 1866 J & T Walker occupied Forge Mill and carried on Allcock's bone crushing business, becoming part of British Glues & Chemicals in 1920.\n\nJohn Deverill Walker (1807-78) and Thomas Walker (1819-93) came from an old Bulwell family ...\n\nJohn Deverill Walker (1807-78) was Christened in Bulwell in 1807, the son of Matthew Walker (1779-) & Alice Deverill who were married at Bulwell in 1805. Mathew was born at Scarrington the son of Benjamin Walker and Ann.\n\nIn 1841 John Deverill was married to Sophia, and was a Grocer at Minerva Terrace, Sneinton. In 1851 a Bone Merchant at Canal Street, St Mary. In 1861 a Bone & Linseed Crusher at Park Row, St Nicholas. In 1871 a Seed Crusher & Tillage Merchant at Lenton Road, Standard Hill & The Castle.\n\nJ D Walker was a member of the local Board of Guardians in Basford, and in 1873 was the Chairman. He died in 1878 aged 70. He was highly esteemed for his business like ability and kindness. Thomas Walker was his youngest brother and carried on the business at his decease, until shortly before he died in 1893, aged 73. John Deverill died in 1878 aged 70.\n\nThomas Walker (1819-93) was baptised on September 9th 1819 at St Mary, Nottingham; the son of Matthew Walker & Alice Deverill who were married at Bulwell in 1805.\n\nIn the 1841 census, Thomas (1818-), a Grocer, was with his elder brother William (1813-) at Woolpack Lane, St Mary. They were still at Woolpack Lane in 1851; Alice was with them and now widowed & an Annuitant, William had gone into brewing and Thomas was now in business as a Bone Merchant.\n\nThe 1861 census confirmed Thomas had started his mill and was now a Bone and Linseed Crusher. He had also married Sarah Elizabeth and there was a brand new baby, Thomas Flecott (1861-) and two older sons, William (1853-) 8 years and John Deverill (1857-) 4 years old, and named after his grandmother. The census also recorded an important daughter Sarah Elizabeth Walker (1858-1950). The family lived at 21 Castle Gate, St Nicholas, Nottingham. In 1871 they had moved to Newcastle Terrace, Standard Hill & The Castle, Basford. John Deverill, a 14 year old, and Sarah E, aged 12, were still at home. William was away and there were sons, Thomas F (1861-), Matthew (1863-) and Samuel George (1867-). By 1881 Thomas was a widower, and a Seed Crusher & Manure Merchant. The family were with him at Cavendish Road, Nottingham Standard Road and the business was well established employing 45 men & 9 women. Son William was the Cashier and John Deverill a Merchants Clerk and Matthew was an Engineers Articled Apprentice.\n\nMost interestingly in 1881 the household had a 'visitor', Sarah Duncalfe (1858-1928) from Tettenhall, Staffordshire. It seemed daughter Sarah Elizabeth's prospective sister-in-law was with them. In 1882 Sarah Elizabeth Walker (1858-1950) was married in Nottingham to a Staffordshire farmer Alfred Richard Duncalfe (1854-1933) from Tettenhall. Alfred Richard Duncalfe (1854-1933) was, no doubt, a customer well satisfied with his abundant use of Walker manures! Alfred's father, Henry Duncalfe (1812-86) was from Shropshire, a prosperous Land Agent Farmer, who in 1881 had 500 acres and employed 9 men, 3 boys & 3 women. In 1884 Alfred & Sarah had a son, Roger Duncalfe (1884-), born in Tettenhall. By 1901 Roger, was living with his Architect uncle Samuel George in Nottingham, and Roger had joined the Walker business as a Tillage & Glue Merchant and by 1911 he was the Glue Works Manager. And when Meggitts (1917) was formed Roger was appointed a Director and his climb to fame & fortune was well underway.\n\nIn 1991 Thomas was now 71 but still an Artificial Manure Manufacturer. Three unmarried sons were with him - William & John Deverill both, Clerks Manure Manufacturer, and Samuel George who was an Architect Clerk. Their address was 22 Burns Street, St Mary, Nottingham.\n\nThomas died in 1893.\n\nIn 1901 John Deverill, Glue & Bane Manure Manufacturer, had married Edith (1870-) in 1893, and they were living at Private Road, Bulwell, Nottingham with son John Deverill (1900-) and daughters Edith (1894-) and Joyce (1897-). Resident with them was unmarried elder brother William, Glue & Bane Manure Manufacturer. Samuel George was now a Civil Engineer Architect and married to Sarah Annie ...\n\nIn 1911 the family were at Arnold Hill House, Plains Road; William was still with them a 58 year old bachelor.\n\nWilliam Walker (1853-) didn't marry, he was 58 in the 1911 census, a Glue & Bane Manure Manufacturer.\n\nJohn Deverill Walker (1857-1948) was a director of BG&C in 1920.\n\nJohn Wilson has provided some additional information on John Deverill Walker (1857-1948) who died in 1948, aged 91 -\n\n'The Walkers owned the Forge Mill, near Papplewick, and were manufacturers of fertilisers from crushed bones. Originally the family lived at Cavendish Road North, Nottingham, where the 1881 census notes John Deverill was living with his father Thomas, a widower, and other members of the family. John Deverill moved to Westlands, Clifton Road, Ruddington, Nottinghamshire in about 1931 or 1932. The 1936/37 electoral register gives the following people as living at Westlands - John Deverill Walker, Edith Nellie Walker, Ruby Walker and Joyce Walker. John and Edith also had a son, who was also called John Deverill. John Deverill Walker kept weather records for many years, both at Forge Mill and at Westlands. He submitted rainfall measurements to the Met Office for 75 years and was their longest serving rainfall recorder ever'.\n\nBusiness Development = Sneinton - Meadow Street Wharf - Forge Mill - London Road - Bestwood Colliery\n\n1814 The Bulwell Mill was for sale comprising corn mill and oil mill in the occupation of Mr John Jackson & Mr Samuel Walsh respectively.\n\nThe 1828 edition of Pigots National Directory included an entry for Bone Crushers in Mansfield; Gregory & Co ...\n\nIn 1830 The Stamford Mercury announced that Shelton & Harvey, Bone Crushers, had taken over the business of Gregory & Co at Meadow Wharf, Nottingham. Crushed bones were gaining sales momentum at the agricultural fairs around Lincoln, Sleaford, Grantham and Newark following Sir Hugh Davy's endorsement of bone dust as a manure in 1813. A previous partnership involving Robert Wilson, John Shelton and John Hall had been dissolved following bankruptcy in 1829. John Shelton had a new partner confirmed in Whites Gazetteer in 1832 and things went well for 20 years.\n\nThe brothers John Deverill and Thomas started out in business as Grocers at Sneinton which was confirmed in the 1841 census.\n\nIn 1850 a business partnership in Nottinghamshire was dissolved; 'Topott & Walker', John Deverill Walker and John Topott, millers, bakers and confectioners? In 1851 John Topott, a Baker, was living at Chapel Bar, Saint Mary, Nottingham with his wife, Harriet, and three sons & a daughter, with two apprentice bakers and servants ...\n\nIn 1851 the census described them as Bone Merchants but they had moved their business to St Mary when they bought a bone crushing business. This venture was reported as early as 1850 in The Nottinghamshire Guardian. The bone crushing business of John Shelton (previously Gregory & Co) at Meadow Street Wharf, Nottingham was now in the hands of Messrs J & T Walker who had moved from Sneinton ...\n\n'History of seed crushing in Great Britain' by Harold W Brace, 1960 described the developments differently -\n\n'Nottingham - J & T Walker erected a mill at Leen Side in about 1854, which was transferred to larger premises on the London road in 1874'.\n\nLeen Side was close to Meadow Street and Canal Street along the Nottingham Camal, and consistent with the original Shelton / Gregory & Co business site established in 1795. The 1851 census listed John Deverill Walker in Nottingham, St Mary's, Exchange District, on Canal Street. The Exchange' sub district ran from Canal Yard through Shepperds Wharf, to Trent Row then across Canal Street to Meadow Place then to John Deverill, next door to a 'Portrait Painter' and then a 'Tallow Chandler', before it continued through Crosby Place and Knotted Alley to Leen Side. The best bet for the original business site was opposite Meadow Street on the canal ... interestingly the Lace Factory next door, just across Trent Street, was owned by Hodgson, Gregory & Co ...\n\nIn the 1861 census the Exchange sub district ran up from the Commercial Hotel on Station Road to Canal Street then along via Walkers Yard to Canal Yard.\n\nWork at the new premises was not without risk an 1853 report in the Stamford Mercury confirmed factory work was a dangerous business especially for the intoxicated!\n\nIn 1855 the Post Office Directory records J & T Walker were processing bones in Canal Street, Nottingham.\n\nIn 1860 adjoining Leicester reported a theft at the Canal Street factory.\n\nIn 1864 The Nottinghamshire Guardian carried and advert identifying Mills at Canal Street, established in 1795, which publicised an analytical report on their linseed cake from Augustus Voelckers, M D, consultant chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society of England.\n\nWhiteâs Directory of Nottinghamshire for 1864 confirmed John and Thomas crushing bones at Canal street and the same Directory lists Charles and William Allcock, Corn Millers (and bone crushers) at Forge Mill in Hucknall Torkard.\n\nCharles Allcock died in 1860 and in 1866 The Nottinghamshire Guardian announced that the Walkers had succeeded Messrs Allcock and new milling machinery of the latest design had been installed at Forge Mills, Papplewick and manures were being endorsed by Dr Voelcker. Two operations were now involved The Bone and Oil Mills, Canal Street and Manure Works, The Forge Mills. Clearly marked on the 1882 town plans map of Nottingham was 'The Forge Mill Bone Manure Worksâ. The original 'Corn Mill' was on the Hucknall/Bestwood parish boundary, but the mill complex expanded across the railway. Some of the building survived on Mill Lane, but most of the site was developed for modern housing.\n\nAn advert in 1867 confirmed - Linseed & Bone Mills and Forge Mills. And again in 1867 - J & T Walker Canal Street and Forge Mills.\n\nBy 1868 the advert had changed. And an advert in the Stamford Mercury. And another in 1869. In 1873 more adverts.\n\nIn 1874, as H W Brace suggested in 1960, the original site on Canal Street was probably vacated for larger premises on London Road.\n\nIn 1877 an offer for lease of premises on Canal Street by Messrs Walker confirmed the move to new facilities on London Road.\n\nIn 1877 an advert confirmed J & T Walker were in the oil milling business at London Road. And again in 1878. again 1881. Things were going well ...\n\nThe London Road Mill was impressive; a single block of five storeys in height, facing on three sides respectively London Road, Island Street and the canal. The fourth side was occupied by a yard in which were a magazine for oil and a large number of oil puncheons.\n\nThen in 1883 a great fire destroyed the oil mill on London Road. The graphic report appeared in the Nottinghamshire Guardian ... a devastating event for J & T Walkers and Nottingham ...\n\nAlthough only partially covered by insurance with the London & Liverpool, the City of London & the Mutual Fire Insurance the mill was rebuilt 'to the most modern description' ... and advertising again in 1884.\n\nIn 1886 Thomas decided to retire and the London Road business was put up for sale ... but who was the younger partner who died? And was the business sold? Wright's 1888 Directory of Nottingham recorded the firm established on Island Street, London Road was still in business? 1887 advert. 1889 advert.\n\nPerhaps the seed crushing activities were sold but certainly the manure business at the Forge Mill complex was not sold. The Bestwood Colliery factory became part of BG&C in 1920 ... Roger Duncalfe was involved by 1901 and John Deverill Walker (1857-1948) was a director of BG&C. Clearly the Walker family remained in business.\n\nFrom The Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, 1889 -\n\n'Mr Robert Marshall, of Ley Fields, Kneesall, Newark, sent on March 25, 1889, a sample of raw bone meal for analysis. Five tons of this had been purchased, at Â£5-5s per ton delivered, net cash, from Messrs J & T Walker, of Nottingham, who were the manufacturers. The following is Dr Voelcker's 1889 report -\n\nMoisture 18.55%\n\nOrganic matter 32.11%\n\nPhosphate of lime 39.71%\n\nCarbonate of lime 8.78%\n\nInsoluble siliceous matter 0.85%\n\nContaining nitrogen 3.63%\n\nEqual to ammonia 4.41%\n\nIncluding common salt 4.32%\n\nThis is wet, low in quality and mixed with over 4% of salt.\n\nMessrs Walker admitted that bones had been in stock since the previous July or August, and that in order to keep down vermin and prevent heating they had added a small amount of salt. They offered to make a reduction of 10s per ton'.\n\nIn 1904 new developments were confirmed as J and T Walker at Bestwood Colliery were selling basic slag ... basic slag was a by-product of steelmaking using the Bessemer process. It was largely limestone or dolomite which had absorbed phosphate from the smelted iron ore. Because of the slowly released phosphate content, and because of its liming effect, it was valued as fertilizer in gardens and farms.\n\nThe Walkers were intent on expanding their manure business with a new lease in 1904 and a conveyance in 1909 of the Forge Mill and parts of Forge Meadow -\n\nRef. Pl E12/6/15/139/ 1-16 - In 1904 the lease of Bulwell Bone Mill to the Walker company was confirmed - 'Papers relating to a lease of Bulwell Bone Mill in Hucknall Torkard and Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, to William & John D Walker; 1904-1914'. First Party: The Most Noble William J A C J Duke of Portland K G. Second Party: William Walker and John Deverill Walker of Nottingham, bone crushers and glue manufacturers. Lease for 21 years from 25 March 1904, from (1) to (2) of the Bulwell Bone Mill, houses, outbuildings, and parts of Forge Meadow in the parishes of Hucknall Torkard and Papplewick, Nottinghamshire; also a right of way between specified roads, a right to use a railway siding connecting with the Midland Railway, a right to use a weighing machine near the railway siding, and a right to take water from the reservoir near the Bulwell Forge Mill.\n\nRef. E12/6/15/172 - In 1909 the conveyance of a Bone Mill and lands in Hucknall Torkard and Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, to William and John D Walker. First Party: The Most Noble William J A C J Duke of Portland K G. Second Party: Edward Horsman Bailey of 5 Berners Street, London, solicitor; and Charles Ludovic Lindsay of 97 Cadogan Gardens, London, formerly a Captain in Her late Majesty's Grenadier Guards. Third Party: William Walker and John Deverill Walker of Nottingham, glue manufacturers at Forge Mills, Papplewick, Nottinghamshire, under the name 'J and T Walker'. Conveyance from (1) to (3) of parts of a Bone Mill, houses, outbuildings, and parts of Forge Meadow in the parishes of Hucknall Torkard and Papplewick, Nottinghamshire; also a right of way between specified roads, a right to use a railway siding connecting with the Midland Railway, and a right to take water from the reservoir near the Bulwell Forge Mill.\n\nIn 1918 The Mining Journal, Volume 11, reported the formation of a new company -\n\n'J & T Walker (1917), Limited - To carry on the business of chemical manure manufacturers and merchants, and bone crushers and merchants, glue and grease manufacturers and merchants. Nominal capital, Â£40,000, in Â£1 shares'.\n\nThe formation of this company was intimately associated with the reorganisation at Meggitts by The Controller of Enemy Businesses (see above). The new Meggitts business would be a direct local competitor and significantly Roger Duncalfe of Forge Mills, Bestwood Colliery, Nottingham had been appointed a director at Meggitts. It was only 3 short years before the business logic behind the formation of British Glues & Chemicals in 1920 became the reality ...\n\nIn 1925 Improved Liquid Glues were recruiting staff at Forge Mills, Bestwood Colliery ...\n\nIn 1926 J & T Walker were hard at it rationalising their transport system at Bestwood ...\n\nIn 1927 The Official Guide to Nottingham (The Queen City of the Midlands) described the 'Bone Glue' Business -\n\n'The bone glue industry originated in Nottingham over a hundred years ago, and to-day is of extensive proportions, more than 500 tons of bones being brought into the district every week for conversion into glue, animal fats, and manures. In the earlier days the trade consisted merely of the rough grinding of bones so as to make them suitable for application to the land. Later on bones were boiled in open pans to extract fat and glue, and then, as science progressed, they were autoÂ­matically sorted over to extract iron and rubbish, all those except the marrow bones passing to grinding mills, and thence to the benzene extractors to have the fat taken out. This fat is sold in large quantities for the making of soap, glycerine, and stearine. The bones, on coming out of the extractors, are dry cleaned and polished, and afterwards go to the glue extractors. Amongst the many different qualities of glue manufactured are cake glues, powdered glues, liquid glues, size, etc, used in such trades as decorating, box making, joinery, cabinet making, match making, and sand paper and emery cloth manufacture, as well as in the paper and textile trades.\n\nThe bones, having had the glue extracted, are taken to another portion of the works to be dried and finely ground for manure, and are sold as artificial manures with a guaranteed analysis to agriculturists at home and abroad, some of the products being treated with acids and other materials. The marrow bones are dealt with separately, and are eventually sold for button making, tooth brush, and piano key manufacture'.\n\nIn 1943 a practical farmer from Nottingham wrote about how J & T Walker's products helped to improve his farm lands before the Great War -\n\n'Thirty Years Farming on the Clifton Park System - How to supply Humus, Texture, and Fertility by the Aid of Deep Rooting Grasses' by William Lamin, 'Before the last war, we had always plenty of bones and kainit to run at, as there was Messrs J & T Walker's bone works not far away. I may say we had a hundred and sixty tons of steam bone flour the year before the Great War. Slag will do the same; but always get as high a percentage as you can, for it takes no more putting on than a low grade, and don't forget the kainit for the light land. For our light land we always preferred the kainit and potash salts to sulphate of potash or muriate of potash, as we considered the salts did the land good.\n\nWe traded with J & T Walker until British Glues bought them and closed the works down. I may say that I was always a great believer in artificial manure, and would a great deal rather spend my money on artificial manures than on cake. In fact, when I was a butcher, I used to take the two farming papers every week Farm & Home, and Farm, Field & Fireside, and I would study every experiment in artificial manures that was printed in those papers, besides making many experiments on my own account in the field'.\n\nThe British Glues and Chemicals Ltd Works, Walker, 1951 ... see aerial photo.\n\nCompanies acquired by BG&C after 1920 -\n\nA listing of the major companies associated with BG&C was compiled by D W F Hardie in his review of the history of the chemical industry in 1966.\n\n1920 Lomas Gelatine Works Ltd - Prince Rock, Plymouth, incorporated in 1914, but registered in 1899 with a nominal capital of Â£5,180 in 450 Â£12 ordinary shares and 80 Â£1 deferred shares. Object, to adopt an agreement with Joseph P Brown and John Brown, of the Abbey Stores, Plymouth. Private company. Glue, gelatine and fertiliser manufacturers and merchants.\n\nColyn Thomas describes the Lomas operation in 1902 in his notes on Millwood.\n\nThe company was wound up and joined BG&C in 1920.\n\nThe Devon Karst Research Society has produced an interesting webpage on the Cattedown Bone Caves which includes a 1931 aerial photo of the Lamas Gelatine Works.\n\nIn 1927 an advert appeared in the Western News concerning the sale of surplus chemicals and plant ...\n\nIn 1935 Mr Edgar Roberts Brown (1882-1935), MD of Lomas Gelatine Works Ltd and a director of BG&C since 1920 died in Great Missenden; he left a substantial estate ... in 1927 Edgar Brown was a grocer in Plymouth ...\n\nIn 1947 the Mechanical World & Engineering Record reported that the factory was to be rebuilt by BG&C.\n\n1920 Improved Liquid Glues Co Ltd - founded in 1911 in Croydon, hence the later name Croids Ltd.\n\nThe history of Croids glues reflects constant enterprise and change ...\n\nIn 1932 the advantages of convenient quality value for money liquid glues were advertised in The Western Morning News ... and advertised in The Hull Daily Mail ... and advertised in the face of cheap Russian imports ... and advertised strength ... and happy new glue year in 1934 ... and saving water ... and by 1940 advertised in the Cornishman ... with a go to it plea ... in 1944 all the attributes in The Evening Telegraph ... and the glue is always ready ... and in short supply ? ... 1945 wartime effort ... and again the general manager in The Western Gazette ... and the production manager in Exeter ... and the works manager in Gloucester ... and the works foreman in Taunton ... and the charge hand in Devon ... and don't forget the problems at home ... Croid was obviously for everything everywhere!\n\n'Georgee' wrote on an internet chat forum on 4th July 2009 - 'when I was a boy in Newark, there was a factory down Tolney Lane called Croid Aero Glue they processed the bones into glue. You could also grind them to make the bone in blood fish and bone meal'.\n\nSee also Vivian Suter memories ...\n\n1921 O Murray & Co Ltd - established 1907, 69-70 Mark Lane, London EC3. Merchants, agents and importers of gelatines & glues plus essential oils, starches, dextrose, chlorates, casein plastics and other natural products. Trading as 'Murray's of Mark Lane'.\n\nFor example Murrays were agents for 'Dorcasine' a casein plastic made by Chas Horner Ltd of Halifax. Casein plastic was introduced in objects from 1910-1930 as an imitation of less exotic horn. A hard, tough, light coloured material. The plastic is based on milk protein and is a obtained from the powdered casein protein, with water as the usual plasticizer, hardened after moulding by the action of formaldehyde. It is used chiefly in thin sheets and rods for making buttons, buckles, knitting needles, pens and, being easily dyed, for costume jewelry and decorative novelties.\n\nIn 1948 The Economist reported, 'Murray's of Mark Lane' has continued to expand its varied interests and its profits have achieved another record. 'During the year we acquired all the shares of the old established business of Cockman Bros Ltd of Stratford, London'.\n\n1948 Cockman Bros & Co, Barbers Road, Stratford, tallow melter, 1905 ...\n\nCockmans was a member of a vigorous collection of London animal by products manufacturers who gravitated to the east of the River Lea around the 1850s.\n\nThe history of West Ham & the River Lea identified a hot bed of noxious animal by products processors in Essex, full of insights into the trading interests (and problems) of BG&C and The Weaver Refining Company - tallow, soap, manures, glues and gelatines ... a fascinating story propelled by three developments -\n\n1839 Eastern Counties Railway - Stratford Station & Great Eastern depot & works and access to the rail network\n\n1844 Metropolitan Building Act - restricted noxious industries from the metropolitan area, bounded by the River Lea\n\n1855 Victoria & Albert Docks - The Royal Docks and access to ocean transport\n\nOf particular interest in this migration were the fortunes of John Knight Ltd. This company was founded in Wapping in 1817 and became a major soapmaaking player, moving to The Royal Primrose Soap Works, Knights Road, Silvertown in 1880. Knights escaped the BG&C rationalisations and but 1920 became a subsidiary of Unilever as a supplier of raw materials and a manufacturer of the luxurious 'Knights Castile' toilet soap.\n\nKnight's Castile, John Knight and the River Lea might seem strange subjects for research but this trio nicely linked the threads running through our own work at Unilever and our study of great grandfather Edward Hindley who was 'in the business' and met the same opportunities & problems associated with rural rivers during the industrial revolution.\n\nOpportunities & problems which have distorted judgments & clouded reputations about health & poverty in the cities ... and led to two other fascinations ... the immense contributions of Cheshire cheese & the humble hogs of West Ham ... which together with beer drinking have fed endless hours of fun!\n\n1926 B Young & Co Ltd - established in 1806 the factory was in Grange Road, Bermondsey, they produced gelatine but later acquired the glue & size works in Spa Road from Procter & Bevington. Locally known as the 'glue factory' but because of the pungent smell emitted from the works, glue production ceased in 1900 and production switched to gelatine. Spa gelatine was the leading brand for wholesome recipies.\n\nThe works closed in 1981 and in 1982 the land was sold for redevelopment.\n\nFrom 1959 Chemical Manufacturers Directory: Chemical Manufacturers - Young B & Company Limited, 123 Grange Road, Bermondsey, London, SE1. Telephone Bermondsey 3561. Telegrams - Omnijel, Souphone, London - Pharmaceutical, photographic, edible and technical gelatines.\n\n1928 The Mitcham Poultry Food Company - established in 1923 by Mr F D McLorinan and went into voluntary liquidation in 1928. Mr Herbert Kidson was appointed as Liquidator. Messrs Kidsons, Taylor and Co of 45 Kingsway, London WC2 and 1 Booth Street, Manchester, were the auditors of British Glues & Chemicals at this time. It seems the Mitcham business was purchased by BG&C around 1928. Confirmed by an announcement in The Chemist & Druggist volume 109, 1928 -\n\n'... fertilizer manufacturers and merchants, bone crushers, workers and merchants, grease manufacturers and merchants, manufacturers and merchants of cattle & poultry foods of all kinds etc.\n\nThe subscribers were F D McLorinan and G W Cole. The first directors and managers shall be the British Glues and Chemicals, Ltd Solicitors, Kenneth Brown, Baker, Baker, Lennox House, Norfolk Street, WC2'.\n\nDespite the name the Mitcham Poultry Food Company was obviously a specialised animal by products company.\n\n1932 George Aspey & Son Ltd - formed 1918. New Station Oil Works, Neville Street, Leeds. However, a fire and associated Â£15,000 worth of damage was reported at George Aspey & Sons, in Leeds in 1894 ... or William Aspey ... ?\n\nIn 1919 Aspeys were advertising in the trade journals for a Foreman to supervise the erection of a new plant ...\n\n1933 The Standard Soap Company - Ashby de la Zouch - Soap making in Ashby de la Zouch was known prior to 1894, when a company called Harrison Frederick John & Co manufactured at Tamworth Road. Around 1900 soap operations moved to The Callis which had previously been a tannery. During the first world war, the site belonged to the Levers and later under various names such as George Aspey and C B Parsons making laundry soap powder. In 1924, the company operated as Ashby Soaps making soaps and soap powder and in 1928 it was renamed Standard Soap Company. In 1933, the site was taken over by British Glues & Chemicals which, during the second world war, manufactured bar soap and toilet soap, and part of the site was used by the Ministry of Defence.\n\nDuring the 1960's, the decision was taken to concentrate on contract manufacture of other companies products in the cosmetics and toiletries industry. This specialisation proved very successful and Standard Soap is now Europe's largest contract soap and toiletries manufacturer.\n\nIn 1968 the company was purchased by Croda International Ltd and then became the head office of their Soaps Division. In 1995 the company was purchased by Kuala Lumpur Kepong Berhad.\n\n1935 G C Russell Ltd - formed 1906, Mr C G Russell was a collector and processor of waste from the Smithfield Market in London.\n\n1947 Calfos Limited - formed in 1939 to make calcium phosphate food supplements. Calfos was the trade name for a prepared bone meal (calcium phosphate) used as a source of calcium and phosphate in foods. Prepared from bones and originally used as a supplement in both animal and human foods as a source of calcium and phosphate. It is no longer used in the UK because of the risk of transmitting BSE. But it was also used as a plant fertilizer, a slowly released source of phosphate.\n\nIn 1946 the spectacular benefits of Calfos had been recorded in 'The Prescriber' Volumes 40-42, 'Calfos.
