        "text": "Welcome to CAAT’s interactive map of UK companies involved in manufacturing components for the F35 combat aircraft.\n\n15% of every F35 that Israel is using to bombard Gaza is made by British industry. CAAT estimates the value of the components UK industry supplies for Israeli F35s to be worth at least £336m since 2016.\n\nSearch for your area, find your local arms dealer, and say NO to companies profiting from genocide on YOUR doorstep!\n\nFor more information on UK arms supplies to Israel, the Israeli arms industry, and Israel’s ongoing occupation and repression of the Palestinians, see our main Israel country page.\n\nExplore details of other export licences (apart from the F-35 components) issued by the current government for arms sales to Israel, since 2015, from our UK export licences browser.*\n\nFind more information about some of the companies listed on the map on our Companies Browser."
