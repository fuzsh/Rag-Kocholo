        "text": "Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership is one of those joining forces with the West of England Aerospace Forum to showcase the region’s aerospace sector and attract new investment.\n\nThe show is one of the world’s largest exhibitions and air displays, and aerospace and advanced engineering companies from the area will be exhibiting their products and services.\n\nOf the 15 international giants of aerospace, 14 have bases in the South West, while the region is also home to a strong network of world-class supply chain companies. The region’s industry is worth more than £7billion.\n\nGordon Page, chairman of Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership, said: “The Dorset Local Enterprise Partnership is very proud to be working with both Invest Bristol and Bath and the Heart of the South West LEP in highlighting the wealth of aerospace and advanced engineering and manufacturing companies that populate the South West region.\n\n“In Dorset, we are proud that companies such as Cobham and Meggitt are headquartered here and that we can continue to boast of the strong and growing advanced engineering supply chain which exists across Dorset.”\n\nThe Farnborough International Airshow offers companies – small, medium or large – an opportunity to showcase products and capabilities to an international audience with networking events and conferences organised across the aerospace, defence, security and space sectors.\n\n“Our aim is to attract further investment into the region so that cutting-edge technologies continue to be developed in our aerospace sector, jobs are created and the industry continues to set the agenda nationally and beyond,” said Prof Joe McGeehan, chairman of Invest Bristol and Bath.\n\nThe trade show runs alongside Farnborough Airshow, which takes place on July 19 and 20, and will feature air displays to celebrate 100 years of aviation history.\n\nThe UK has the world’s largest aerospace industry outside of the United States."
