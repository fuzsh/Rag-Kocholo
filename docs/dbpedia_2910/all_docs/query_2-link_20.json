We have a framework of policies, procedures and training in place covering data protection, confidentiality and security and regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the data we hold secure.\n\nWhen and how we share personal data and locations of processing\n\nWe will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so. When we share data with others, we put contractual arrangements in place to protect the data and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards.\n\nWe are an international company and use third parties located in other countries to help us run our business. As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the countries where we and our customers and suppliers are located. This includes to countries outside the European Union (“EU”) and to countries that do not have laws that provide specific protection for personal data.

We will only fulfil requests for personal data where we are permitted to do so in accordance with applicable law or regulation.\n\nChanges to this privacy statement\n\nWe recognise that transparency is an ongoing responsibility so we will keep this privacy statement under regular review.\n\nData controller and contact information\n\nThe data controller is Meggitt PLC (the company registered in England under registration no. 432989 and with its registration address at Pilot Way, Ansty Business Park, Coventry, CV7 9JU, UK) and such other Meggitt company that is a contracting party for the purposes of providing or receiving good and services.\n\nIf you have any questions about this privacy statement or how and why we process personal data, please contact us at:\n\nData Protection Officer\n\nMeggitt PLC\n\nPilot Way\n\nAnsty Business Park\n\nCoventry\n\nCV7 9JU\n\nUK\n\nEmail: <a href=”mailto:dpo@meggitt.com”>dpo@meggitt.com</a>\n\nIndividuals’ rights and how to exercise them\n\nIndividuals have certain rights over their personal data and data controllers are responsible for fulfilling these rights.
