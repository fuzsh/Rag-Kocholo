        "text": "The purpose built facility will serve as the Americas regional hub for aftermarket services and support.\n\nThe opening ceremony was led by chief executive, Tony Wood, with the support of Ray Bennett, Americas SVP general manager for Services & Support. The event was attended by employees as well as several dignitaries including Nicolette Brent, Her Majesty’s Consul General in Miami, Jamal Sowell, Florida Secretary of Commerce, Miami Dade County Commissioner Jose Pepe Diaz and Michael Finney, CEO of the Miami–Dade Beacon Council.\n\nThe facility has more than doubled in size to 48,000ft2, with plans to expand by a further 50% in 2020. The new site will include: service and support capabilities for fire extinguishing systems; safety restraints; oxygen sensor systems; heat transfer systems, mechanical, hydraulic, electronic and avionic system repairs.\n\nBoth civil and defence customers will benefit from the expansion and the Miami location currently serves all the major American airlines as well as key OEMs such as Collins Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, GE, Boeing, Airbus and Airbus Helicopters. The site also works closely with the US military providing a wide range of services to the US armed forces.\n\nChief executive Tony Wood said: “Today’s opening of our expanded, state-of-the-art Miami facility is another important milestone in our broader investment programme around the world as we continue to invest for growth. Our Miami facility will be a key US hub for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul.\n\n“This further enhances the consistent, world-class levels of support we provide to our customers globally and our ongoing investment reflects the increasing demand for our highly innovative and competitive products and services.”"
