        "text": "Meggitt expands Defense Thermal Systems group with re-location of turbo machinery resources and thermal components.\n\nInternational aerospace and defence engineering group Meggitt today announced that Meggitt Defense Systems of Irvine, California, has recently completed the relocation of the Meggitt Control Systems (MCS) Corona, California facility into their Irvine facility. This expands significantly Meggitt’s thermal systems and thermal components portfolio. The thermal systems product line now includes fans, pumps, and compressors in addition to their complete vapor cycle systems and liquid cooling systems.\n\nMeggitt Defense Systems Inc. (MDSI) thermal systems and components can be found on over 46 different military ground, air and naval platforms including the M1A2, P-8, AH-64, V-22, F-35, MA2A3, CH-47, DDG-51, AB LAV, etc. plus numerous proprietary and development unmanned and manned air and ground vehicles.\n\nDr. Roger Brum, President of MDSI, commented: “The relocation of the Meggitt Controls turbo machinery team and fan, pump, and compressor product lines into our very successful Thermal Management Systems business will ensure that we continue to provide our customers with more affordable cooling solutions in less time. This leverages a more vertically integrated business, all housed within one facility, for all military thermal systems and components”\n\nMeggitt has also significantly increased its investment into the new thermal component business with its proven Smart Controller Technology, and investments in Thermal Systems Modeling and Additive Manufacturing Technology.\n\nGerald C Janicki, Vice President of Thermal Systems, said: “The re-integration of these two groups, both of which have a long heritage and were formed from over a dozen individual thermal companies and organizations over the past 40 years, is already providing dividends to both existing and new customers”.\n\nENDS\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nGerry Janicki Tel: +1 949 465 7700\n\nEditor’s notes:\n\nAbout Meggitt Defense Systems\n\nMeggitt Defense Systems, Inc., a subsidiary of Meggitt PLC, specializes in the design, development and production of ammunition handling systems, radar and digital processing systems, and thermal management systems and components.
