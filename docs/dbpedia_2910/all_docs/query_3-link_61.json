        "text": "Taylor & Mathis completed this 205,645 SF light manufacturing and distribution facility for UK-based Meggitt Defense Systems in 2008. Located in the city of Suwanee, Gwinnett County, GA — just 0.4 miles from Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and 2.5 miles from I-85 – the rear-load building features concrete tilt-up construction, 26’ minimum clear height, 450 auto parking spaces, 130’ truck court depth and ESFR fire protection system. The tenant signed a 10-year lease; the project was sold to an institutional investor at completion."
