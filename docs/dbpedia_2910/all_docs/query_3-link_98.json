        "text": "GIBSONBURG - On Nov. 17, interim Sandusky County Sheriff Tim Wiersma and Capt. Steve Stotz read Capt. Mike Meggitt his Garrity rights — which protect public employees from being compelled to incriminate themselves during investigations by their employers — and they interviewed him about an incident that took place Sept. 1.\n\nMore than two months later, Meggitt admitted he lied to Stotz. While off duty and driving a marked sheriff's cruiser, Meggitt took photos with his phone of the home of Gibsonburg police Chief Paul Whitaker.\n\nStotz was administrator of the sheriff's office at the time.\n\nIt’s something that still doesn’t sit well with Whitaker, even as he looks forward to working with new Sheriff Chris Hilton, who took office Sunday.\n\n“I’m frustrated and disappointed,” Whitaker said recently. “Captain Meggitt lied to the acting sheriff. When questioned in a criminal investigation, on a criminal complaint, a complaint by a citizen of harassment. And he lied on that.”\n\nBecause the confession was made under Garrity rights, what Meggitt told Stotz and Wiersma can’t be used in court, Whitaker said.\n\nThe Gibsonburg police chief called Meggitt's photo-taking an act of intimidation, done as former Sheriff Kyle Overmyer — Meggitt's brother-in-law — was actively campaigning for re-election as sheriff while under indictment on dozens of theft and drug-related charges.\n\nAt the time, Whitaker was potentially a witness in Overmyer’s prosecution.\n\nFor his punishment, Meggitt received only a written reprimand, officially listed as a disciplinary verbal warning for failure of good behavior.\n\nIn response to a public records request by The News-Messenger, Wiersma released the report concerning the office’s investigation of Meggitt.\n\nWiersma said he spoke with outgoing Sandusky County Prosecutor Tom Stierwalt and Assistant County Prosecutor Norm Solze the week of Dec. 13 and had them read the three-page internal investigation report on Meggitt.\n\nThe former interim sheriff said he asked Stierwalt and Solze if Meggitt’s behavior was a “Brady disqualifier,” which would mean Meggitt’s admission to Wiersma and Stotz could be used in possible future legal proceedings.\n\nWiersma explained that if there were a Brady disqualifier and if the investigation went to court as a criminal case, it would have to be disclosed to attorneys that the officer lied in this instance.\n\nHe said Stierwalt and Solze both replied that it was not a Brady disqualifier, a position that Wiersma shared.\n\nAttempts to reach Stierwalt by phone at his office were unsuccessful.\n\nThe interim sheriff emphasized that, from his perspective, the incident involving Meggitt took place at a time of high stress at the sheriff’s office, with uncertainty about Overmyer’s case and people taking sides either for or against the former sheriff. Overmyer lost his bid for re-election, pleaded guilty Dec. 13 to 13 felonies and one misdemeanor, and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\n“There was a river of fire going through here,” is how Wiersma described the atmosphere in the sheriff's office, adding later, “I am so sorry he took the pictures. He is sorry he took the pictures. He did not mean to intimidate Whitaker.”\n\nThe News-Messenger sent questions to an email address for Meggitt that was provided by the sheriff’s office, but the captain did not respond.\n\nOn the night of Sept. 1, Whitaker was sitting in on a Gibsonburg village council meeting when he got an unexpected call.\n\nHis wife told him a marked SUV from the sheriff’s office was parked in front of their home and a deputy was possibly taking photos.\n\nWhitaker called Stotz about the incident at his home. In the report, Stotz said he would contact Meggitt and see what had taken place.\n\n“Nobody got back with me until Nov. 22,” Whitaker said, noting that Wiersma cornered him in a parking lot at Terra State Community College about 20 minutes after Overmyer pleaded guilty.\n\nWiersma told him that Meggitt had been read his Garrity rights and was given a verbal reprimand after changing his story and admitting he took photos of the Gibsonburg chief’s home, Whitaker said.\n\nWhitaker said he responded by asking Wiersma why the investigation was suddenly important to him and told the interim sheriff he couldn’t pursue anything legally or use anything the captain said in court once Meggitt had been read his Garrity rights.\n\n“The leadership at the sheriff’s office wasn’t concerned about this until Sheriff Overmyer was out of the picture,” Whitaker said.\n\ndacarson@gannett.com\n\n419-334-1046\n\nTwitter: @DanielCarson7"
