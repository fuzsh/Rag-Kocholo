Ware+Malcomb Architects asked Image 4 to collaborate on the design for the Brand elements. The presentation had to show the world-class capabilities and breadth of product offered by Meggitt, as well as present corporate values and insight to the Brand differentiators.\n\nThe centerpiece Brand element is a 36-foot high acrylic graphic assembly, suspended from ceiling to floor on spring-compression stressed aircraft cable. The design had to accommodate the recent CA earthquake codes, as well as a nearly 4” building expansion from dawn to late afternoon! Image 4’s engineer evaluated the vertical expansion and load of the assembly, and designed a simple and effective “inverted shock absorber” to support the installation.\n\nConference room wallcovering murals show aircraft that use Meggitt components, and large-scale technical line art presents a technical and engineering feel. Employee areas feature graphics presenting the corporate values, and product accomplishments. Wayfinding was developed for the factory-floor tour, and massive graphics accented the production floor."
