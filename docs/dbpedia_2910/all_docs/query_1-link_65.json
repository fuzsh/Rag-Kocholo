        "text": "I hope we’ll get to work together again before too long. D_ H_ school really was stupendous - honestly one of the very best events I’ve ever done. So, no, you’re not “another agency” but only because you’re more and better.\n\nI wanted to say a very heartfelt thank you for today. It was such a pleasure to meet you both, and I really appreciated how smoothly and professionally you ran everything. (L. F., award winning children’s writer)\n\nHow super were the talks today!? Lovely book selection! Bronnie is so lovely with the boys and we also felt that having a man enthusing about the books set a great example. That was a MUCH better quality of fair and I am sure the sales will go well. (Ms RC, teacher)\n\nThis experience has been fantastic primarily for the children, the school and also for me (professionally). Many thanks again for your kind words and support. We would really like to work with Bookwagon again and hope to do so in the not too distant future.(Mr EO, teacher, Ipswich)\n\nWe are very grateful for your continued support; we are incredibly lucky to have you as our #bookbuddy and now lots of other schools can benefit from your support and advice via CLPE (Miss AN, head teacher, North London)\n\nIt was a wonderful day and the children truly enjoyed the book sale at the heart of it. Your selection was perfect for our children and what really made the difference was your ability to engage with each child, discuss their interests and help them to choose a suitable book based on your extensive knowledge of the books you were selling. There was just the right amount of choice to suit everyone without being overwhelming and I received comments from parents and staff about the quality of books offered compared to previous sales which have always been based around current crazes and well known celebrity authors. (Ms M H, head teacher, Oxfordshire)\n\nI was at my last school for 4 years and we had ********* book fairs every term – and every term, I was disappointed by the narrow range of books. Yes, we got a slightly larger commission but I honestly struggled choosing books from their range! They would also only drop off a case of books and leave us to run it – it was so lovely to have you on hand to chat to the children and recommend them books, as well as the small (but appreciated!) touches such as having the books presented so nicely on the tables! (Ms S B, Oxfordshire, Teacher)\n\nYou guys are such a force for good and I am a passionate supporter of Indie booksellers, so I'm so happy this worked out well (I'd love to know how many books were sold if you have it to hand - it felt like quite a lot!). You guys were so fab and Dawn was such a lovely presence in the schools - I will absolutely be in touch next time I'm in your neck of the woods. I haven't charted out my visits for the summer term, but I'm sure there are several in the south) and thanks so much for being so fantastic! (Ms M E, award-winning children’s author, Dorset)\n\nHuge thanks for the books for today’s event. Once again I’m passing on such excellent feedback on your service. I think the comment was : ‘ Bronnie was as brilliant as you said she’d be’! Huge thanks to you. (Ms E C, award-winning children’s author)\n\nIt’s another Bookwagon day in our house. The kids were so excited to get their latest books in the post. If you need present ideas for your little ones, you should consider buying a subscription from Bookwagon. An independent online children bookshop that sells “forever books”. It was started by an amazing lady Bronnie Mayho. Bookwagon Limited. (Mrs T E, Hertfordshire)\n\nYesterday a parent came over to tell me how impressed she was by the book fair and that you did a fabulous job of selling the books to the children first... she spent £50! Another Mum had loads of positive comments too. Would you like to book a date to return next year around the same time? Ms JT, Teacher, Somerset\n\nJust a quick message to say the books arrived and have been a massive hit! O**** was so excited when he realised he could use the book to make actual experiments. Thank you so much! Ms EB, teacher, Buckinghamshire\n\nI have been meaning to drop you an email all week to say thank you for our recent book order. The books are beautiful and obviously well chosen by yourselves. I have even talked the head into a little revamp of the library so that we can display them properly! Ms GH, Teacher, Wiltshire\n\nThanks so much for your lovely message and for everything that you do with Book Wagon. Yourself and Bob are much cherished in our booky world and I personally really appreciate everything that you do. David Litchfield, author and illustrator\n\nWe decided to update our reading and writing texts and Bronnie and Bob had in-depth knowledge of such a wide range of texts that they were able to signpost and support teachers from across the school to choose texts that the children at our school would find stimulating and engaging. Not only do they know a plethora of texts, they have also read and reviewed each text so they were able to discuss characters, settings and themes. Updating our reading and writing texts was an effortless task when working with Bookwagon! Highly recommended. (Mr AH, London)"
