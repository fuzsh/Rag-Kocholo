WINDHOEK – Ohorongo Cement last week confirmed a donation of cement to the value of more than a N$1 million to the government. One truckload of cement would be donated to each of the 14 regions, not only as part of the silver jubilee independence celebrations, but also towards the general development of Namibia.

According to the Permanent Secretary in the Office of the Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Independence Committee, Nangula Mbako, the cement would be handed to the governor of each region. The governors will be tasked in-house to identify a project within the region that they would like to use the cement for.

“The timing of this huge donation is perfect and the government is grateful to Ohorongo Cement for their contribution towards the development of Namibia and its people, it is a lot of cement,” said Mbako.

“We want to make a difference and support our government to leave a lasting legacy for all Namibians,” said Hans-Wilhelm Schütte, Managing Director of Ohorongo Cement.

Besides the latest donation, the company has invested more than N$6.5 million as corporate social investment already since its inception, according to Schütte.
