        "text": "WINDHOEK\n\nThree disadvantaged nursing students received bursaries from Ohorongo Otavi Community Trust (OOCT), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MOHSS), to further pursue their studies.\n\nThe handover took place in Windhoek last month where the three students, one from Welwitchia University and two from the University of Namibia (Unam) received bursaries worth N$60 540 in total.\n\nOhorongo Cement recently approached the MOHSS for guidance regarding the allocation of bursaries within the healthcare fraternity. The decision to award the bursaries to the selected three nursing students, was proposed by deputy minister, Juliet Kavetuna, who made the selection based on merit, in a clear and transparent manner.\n\n“Instead of just supporting one student within healthcare, it made more sense to assist more than one student, especially in light of the fact that they are disadvantaged,” Kavetuna said.\n\nTo date, Ohorongo Cement has invested more than N$ 10 million towards various corporate social responsibility projects throughout Namibia.\n\nYouth Corner, courtesy of Ohorogo Cement, brings you an interview with one of the beneficiary students, Henry Dollar.\n\nWhat is the name you are most commonly known by?\n\nHere at the institution everyone calls me Henry, but where I come from, I’m known as Dollar.\n\nWhere did your interest in nursing start?\n\nIt started a long time ago, when I was about three years of age. Then I practiced nursing and medicine on a much lower level, by giving my relatives water mixed with sugar and salt. When they had wounds, I would crush some leaves and apply it to their wounds and sometimea it helped. They then started calling me, Doctor Nurse Dollar.\n\nIs this your first year of tertiary studies?\n\nYes, it is my first year at a tertiary institution.\n\nYou have been earmarked as underprivileged students, needing assistance with tuition fees. How does this bursary contribution from the Ohorongo Otavi Community Trust influence your life?\n\nI have no words to describe it fully, but I call this bursary a lifeline that saved me, while I was drowning. It is a bridge that will help me to realise my dreams, and in so doing my circumstances will turn around and it will indirectly change other people’s lives in the near future.\n\nIf you had to give advice to other young ones out there, what would it be?\n\nFirst and foremost I would tell them to put God first in their lives. Secondly, I would tell them to never give up on their dreams and passion. Even if it looks as if there is no way out, keep moving forward. God will make a way that you didn’t expect.\n\nThirdly, be committed to what you engage in. Hard work pays off and diligence will take you beyond your dreams. Remember that others have done it before you, so you can also do it too… have limited fun!"
