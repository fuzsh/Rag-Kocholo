        "text": "Ohorongo Cement is a Namibian company that operates in the cement and aggregates sector. The company is committed to decarbonisation and reducing its carbon footprint through various initiatives, including the use of renewable energy sources and corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs).\n\nOhorongo Cement was established in 2007 and is located in the Otavi region of Namibia. The company produces high-quality cement products that are used in various construction projects across the country. The company's commitment to sustainability is reflected in its operations, which are designed to minimise the impact on the environment.\n\nDecarbonisation is a key focus for Ohorongo Cement, and the company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint through various initiatives. One of the most significant initiatives is the use of renewable energy sources. Ohorongo Cement has installed a solar power plant on its premises, which generates electricity from the sun. The solar power plant has a capacity of 1.5 MW and is capable of meeting up to 20% of the company's energy needs.\n\nIn addition to the solar power plant, Ohorongo Cement has also invested in wind energy. The company has partnered with a local wind farm to purchase renewable energy through a corporate PPA. This partnership allows Ohorongo Cement to purchase clean energy at a fixed price, which helps to stabilise energy costs and reduce the company's reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nCorporate energy management is another important aspect of Ohorongo Cement's sustainability strategy. The company has implemented various measures to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. For example, the company has installed energy-efficient lighting and equipment, and has implemented a comprehensive energy management system.\n\nOhorongo Cement is also committed to reducing waste and promoting circular economy principles. The company has implemented a waste management system that includes recycling and reusing materials wherever possible. The company also uses alternative fuels, such as biomass and waste-derived fuels, to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nIn addition to its sustainability initiatives, Ohorongo Cement is also committed to social responsibility. The company has implemented various community development projects, including the construction of schools and clinics, and the provision of clean water and sanitation facilities. The company also supports local small and medium-sized enterprises through its procurement processes.\n\nOverall, Ohorongo Cement is a leading example of a company that is committed to sustainability and decarbonisation. The company's focus on renewable energy, corporate PPA, and corporate energy management demonstrates its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and promoting a more sustainable future. Ohorongo Cement's efforts to promote circular economy principles and support local communities further highlight its commitment to social responsibility."
