        "text": "August 17, 2017\n\nONDANGWA, Aug. 17 – Ohorongo Cement opened a new depot in Ondangwa today, in an attempt to address the need of cement in the northern part of the country.\n\nThe company invested N$4 million into this infrastructure for the distribution of several types of cement for CEMII 42.5N, CEMI 42.5R, CEMII 32.5N for the local market while CEMII 42.5N will also feature Portuguese labels available for export to neighboring Angola.\n\nThe company entered into a nine-year partnership agreement with TransNamib to enable Ohorongo Cement to deliver cement from its Sargberg Plant near Otavi to customers in the northern regions safely and efficiently. Utilizing the railway will also see fewer trucks on the road.\n\nOndangwa was chosen due to its location as it is central to the majority of customers. The establishment of the Ondangwa depot shortens the time and distance for the distribution of products for both the local and potentially, the export market in Angola. Its location enables a responsive distribution network and cementing strong business relationships with customers.\n\nManaging Director of Ohorongo Cement Hans-Wilhem Schütte said that 44% of their clients are in the northern area, and the new depot will make it an easy access station for everyone.\n\nThe depot is also aimed at supporting the SMEs that would like to go into cement sale in both urban and rural communities as they would be able to buy directly from the depot as well as do their own pick up.\n\n“The communities there would benefit in the long term environmentally, as constructing structures with cement is long lasting and there would be a lesser need to cut down trees to construct shelter,” said Schütte. – Maria Abraham\n\nPost Views: 913\n\nDerdy"
