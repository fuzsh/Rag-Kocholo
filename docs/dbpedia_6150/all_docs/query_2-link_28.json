        "text": "WINDHOEK – Ohorongo Cement inaugurated a 5MW PV Solar Plant in September in the Otjozondjupa Region which Minister of Mines and Energy, Tom Alweendo “a significant milestone in private sector participation”, and encouraged other investors and developers to follow the example set by the project. Alweendo said the solar project is an excellent example of how the private sector is making a significant contribution to energy security, economic growth and development and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe solar plant, which will supply the Ohorongo Cement factory with clean and affordable energy, was spearheaded by Ohorongo Cement and developed by SunEQ Four and the Hungileni Investment Group.\n\n“This project represents a classic win-win situation for all involved – the environmental impact from the PV plant is minimal, the plant will employ additional personnel to maintain it, the Ohorongo Cement Company gets clean energy at a competitive rate, the IPP, SunEQ Four and Hungileni Investment group secured an off-taker, and given that the plant is not connected to the grid, the impact of intermittency on the grid is avoided,” said Alweendo."
