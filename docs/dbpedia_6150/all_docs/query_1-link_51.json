A roof wetting celebration took place in February 2010, when the preheater tower reached its final height of 109 meters. The commissioning of the plant is scheduled for the end of the year 2010.\n\nThe German company Polysius AG, one of the leading engineering companies equipping the cement and minerals industries, is constructing the plant on a turnkey basis. When in full production, the plant output is estimated at 700 000 tonnes of cement per year. Ohorongo intends to satisfy local demand as well as to export the cement to neighbouring countries."
