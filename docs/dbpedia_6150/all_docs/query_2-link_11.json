        "text": "Dundee Precious Metals Tsumeb and Ohorongo Cement through the Ohorongo Otavi Community Trust partnered to donate 10 hospital beds and installation of oxygen supply points valued at N$300 000.00 to the Tsumeb District Private Hospital on Thursday, 22nd July 2021.\n\nThe hospital experienced a shortage of beds and oxygen supply points, which prompted the collaborated assistance from Dundee Precious Metals Tsumeb and Ohorongo Cement.\n\nThe Tsumeb District Private Hospital have their own oxygen generating plant, the support provided will also relieve the pressure on the Tsumeb State Hospital as the private hospital will now assist more patients with a stable supply of oxygen.\n\nThis donation comes in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections in hopes of reducing the burden on the Namibian medical system and saving the lives of as many people as possible. The private hospital is one of the key medical centers where patients from Otavi and Tsumeb areas as well as employees from both companies are treated.\n\nThe equipment was handed over by Hans Wilhelm Schütte, Managing Director Ohorongo Cement and Zebra Kasete, Vice President and Managing Director Dundee Precious Metals Tsumeb to André Neethling, Managing Director Tsumeb District Private Hospital.\n\nSpeaking at the handover occasion both Kasete and Schütte echoed the same sentiments stating that community and business leaders need to make sure health care workers have the facilities to do their level best to ensure patients have comfort while being cared for. Kasete further encouraged Namibians to get vaccinated to reduce pressure on health facilities and to help the country return to new normalcy like what we have witnessed in other countries hosting large sporting events.\n\nNeethling, thanked both companies for their swift response in support of the private hospital and highlighted the importance of making life easier for members of the community who need it the most.\n\n”We are grateful to Dundee Precious Metals Tsumeb and Ohorongo Cement for their support, strengthening our hand and giving us the opportunity to deliver proper service to the community in a dignified way. It makes a difference, and it will go a long way” said Neethling."
