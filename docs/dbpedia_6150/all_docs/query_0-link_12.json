        "text": "Namibia’s first ever cement plant has been in business for three years, helping to end Namibia’s reliance on imported cement and even mature into a cement net-exporting country.\n\nSituated near Otavi, some 435 km north of the capital Windhoek, the Ohorongo facility has certainly made good strides in its mission to become the cement supplier of choice for the construction industry. Opened in 2011, the facility set up by Schwenk Zement KG, a German family-run business with over 160 years’ experience, has been credited with operating the most technologically advanced plant of its kind in Africa. It was awarded several prizes including ‘Best Foreign Investment’ by the Namibian Government in 2011, and “Manufacturer of the Year Award for 2013” by the Namibia Manufacturers Association."
