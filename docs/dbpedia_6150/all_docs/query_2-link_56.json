The Ohorongo facility, the most modern cement plant in Africa, was inaugurated on Thursday by President Hifikepunye Pohamba.\n\nThe inauguration of the Ohorongo plant, which will have an annual production capacity of 700,000 tonnes, is expected to end Namibia's reliance on imported cement and will also supply demand in neighbouring Botswana, Zambia and Angola. The plant will comply with strict environmental and emission control standards as used by sister facilities in Germany.\n\nThe European Investment Bank, the European Union's long-term lending institution, provided over N$820 million for the N$2.5 billion project, in recognition of the Ohorongo plant's expected contribution to local employment and high environmental standards.\n\nSpeaking on the inauguration of the modern cement facility, the European Investment Bank vice-president responsible for Africa, Plutarchos Sakellaris said: \"The European Investment Bank congratulates Ohorongo Cement in completing construction of Namibia's only cement factory complying with strict emission and safety standards. We welcome the plant's commitment to improving living standards and employment around the facility and we activity in northern Namibia.\n\nOn his part, the European Union interim Charge d'Affaires, Dr. Joachim Knoth, noted: \"The inauguration of the Ohorongo Cement factory is as a pivotal investment towards the strengthening of the industrial sector in Namibia. The factory will support the goals set out in the country's long-term development strategy Vision 2030 for optimal utilization of the country's resources and diversification of its economy. I am convinced that Ohorongo will live up to our expectations and make an important contribution to the economy in the whole region--for generations to come.\"\n\nThe Ohorongo plant will have an annual production capacity of 700,000 tonnes and cover cement production from raw material preparation to cement dispatching. The European Investment Bank loan will also finance a grinding mill, access roads, railway track and housing facilities for the workforce.\n\nThe new cement plant will make a significant contribution to reducing poverty and towards sustainable economic development in northern Namibia. The Ohorongo plant will provide over 300 direct jobs and provide indirect employment for over 2,000 people in the Otavi area, a poor rural district. Ohorongo cement seek to use invader bush to supply 30% of the plants energy demand, further boosting local employment through harvesting and delivery activities."
