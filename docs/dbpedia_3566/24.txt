Humidity

We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in Sant'Antonio di Gallura is essentially constant during the winter, remaining around 0% throughout.

The lowest chance of a muggy day during the winter is 0% on December 16.

For reference, on August 8, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 37% of the time, while on November 30, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Data Sources

This report illustrates the typical weather in Sant'Antonio di Gallura, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point

There are 3 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Sant'Antonio di Gallura.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Sant'Antonio di Gallura according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.

The estimated value at Sant'Antonio di Gallura is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Sant'Antonio di Gallura and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

Olbia - Costa Smeralda Airport (LIEO, 38%, 13 mi, southeast, -1,073 ft elevation change)

Guardiavecchia (LIEG, 53%, 16 mi, north, -551 ft elevation change)

Alghero-Fertilia Airport (LIEA, 9%, 58 mi, southwest, -1,024 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Sant'Antonio di Gallura and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data

All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
