        "text": "ITALY PSI-1510. 20 LIGURIA DI LEVANTE BIANCO PADULETTI, AZ. AGR. GIACOMELLI 91/100\n\n60% vermentino, 30% trebbiano, 10% malvasia. A cuvee that well represents the varieties and region. Vermentino peach and honey to the fore, supported by appley trebbiano and a wisp of malvasia exotica. Vermentino fully out front on the palate. Acidity adequate for balance. Long finish. A pleasure to drink now. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1511. 20 COLLI DI LUNI VERMENTINO PIANACCE. AZ. AGR. GIACOMELLI 92+/100 *\n\nEst. 1993 in southern Liguria; clay soil; 24 hour cold maceration; bottled at 7 months. Some sulphur gauze masking varietal aroma. A good scent of pear eventually gets through. And becomes more evocative on the palate. Deliciously sweet and expressive vermentino flavor. Fine acid and texture. Once this airs, it's going to make a dynamite vermentino! Indeed it did. Two hours later, the group found it aromatic, rich, and long. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1512. 21 ROUGE DE VALLEE, SOC. COOP. LA KIUVA 92/100\n\nAt Arnad, Aosta Valley; 50 member cooperative est. late 1970s; 70% picotendro (local nebbiolo clone), 30% gros vien, neyret, cornalin and fumin at 1300-1700'. Well, if this isn't a cool vintage, high altitude take on nebbiolo and friends. Sweet cherry, at the same time racy. Way deep aroma. The flavors show both intensity and relief. Rangy set of varietal inputs. Balanced and lasting. Well textured. Better than the nice 2020 in my estimation. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1513. 18 VALLE D'AOSTE BADEBEC, LA CANTINA DI CUNEAZ NADIR 94/100\n\nHalf a hectare of vines up to 100 years old near Gressan. 90% petit rouge, plus fumin, vien de nus; fruit from the earlier ripening parcel is allowed to dry for two weeks; the 'cantina' is a room in the Cuneaz family home. Wow! Is that the definition of petit rouge? Singular combo of cranberry and red currant. Plus cherry and lilac highlights. So precise and magnified. Full flavors confirm aromas. Cranberry like tartness, red currant astringency carry aromatic associations over to textural ones. Singular indeed, as well as sensational. Long, chewy finish. 94/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $31.99 each PSI-1514. 19 VALLE DAOSTE CORNALIN, CHATEAU FEUILLET 92/100\n\nRare, indigenous variety; alluvial soil over granite bedrock. Heavy Bottle Award. Rare, indeed. I've never smelled aromatics quite like these. Dried and fresh fruits, wild herbs melange. Can't get enough of it. Great Aosta acidity soothed over with glycerol. Flavor, balance, intrigue. Long finish. Unique and entertaining. No issues that would preclude current enjoyment. 92/100. Attendees were 'challenged and intrigued' by the nose. Mentions of 'leathers, florals, pepper, seawood, hybrid grape variety.' List price: $35.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1515. 19 VALLE D'AOSTE PINOT NOIR, OTTIN\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1516. 21 VALLEE D'AOSTE GAMAY, GROSJEAN 91+/100\n\nVines densely planted; age 10-30 years. Unfined. That's quite a stocky gamay. Has a dried fruit Italianate leaning to it. Fruitier on the palate. Still, its marks are fullness and framework. Versatile dinner wine. Nothing like French gamay. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $25.99 each PSI-1517. 19 VALLEE D'AOSTE TORRETTE SUPERIEUR, OTTIN 92/100\n\n2018: 80% petit rouge, 10% cornalin, 10% fumin. Subtle red fruits and vinosity. Juicy cherry-berry fruit. No tannin. Good balance of richness and acidity. Everything flows along so well. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $31.99 each PSI-1518. 19 VALLE D'AOSTE PETITE ARVINE, OTTIN\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1519. 18 VALLEE D'AOSTE FUMIN, CAVE DES ONZE COMMUNES 92+/100\n\nDark and deep red-black color. Rich, large, and deep red fruit for this region. Class variety.Rich and tart blackberry scents. Dark, dry, tart and tannic. Large textured. Big in the mouth food wine. Long on flavor. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1520. 16 COLLINE NOVARESI NEBBIOLO PRATOGRANDE, MONSECCO 1++/100\n\nFrom vineyards outside Gattinara and Ghemme; aged 2 yrs in oak vats. Dry, and surprisingly woody. Depth and intricacy come with aeration. Hint of roses. I'm intrigued. Again, dry. Close and tannic. Gotta cellar this one. Its whole future is ahead of it. 91++/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1521. 19 COLLINE NOVARESI NEBBIOLO VALPLAZZA, ROVELLOTTI 93+/100\n\nProper medium ruddy color. Very suave in 2019; makes sense. Northern nebbiolo cut with good glycerol padding. Yes, well rounded. Really fills the palate and lingers. Such an harmonious whole. Defines its genre. I'll have buyers. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $28.99 each PSI-1522. 22 COLLINE NOVARESI NEBBIOLO, LE PIANE\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1523. 22 COLLINE NOVARESI LA MAGGIORINA, LE PIANE 91+/100\n\n40-100 yr old vines in Boca; nebbiolo (40%), croatina (40%), vespolina (5%) and 9 other local varieties including some whites. The varietal aroma set is forthcoming and clearly well conceived. And beginning to billow. Cooler than ideal service temperature accents the tannin and dampens the flavors at bit. Otherwise, it seems well enough assembled and in tune with this successful series. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1524. 20 PIEMONTE VISPAVOLA CASCINA COTTIGNANO, COLOMBERA & GARELLA 91+/100\n\nGood ripeness for the zone, as 2020 promises. I like the weight and flow and acid; appropriate to the area. Good acid, fine tannin. Well balanced and well poised. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $26.99 each PSI-1525. 16 PIEMONTE ROSSO MIMMO, LE PIANE\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1526. 19 NOVARESE ERBALUCE BIANKO, LE PIANE 93/100\n\nErbaluce; old vines in Boca, highest of the Novara hills denominazioni. Wow, that's got a surprising fruit density for varietal and altitude. Must be the old vines talking. Seckel pear and peel. Full, intense presence on the palate too. Fruit density accompanied by raspy fruit acidity makes for balance, entertainment, and meal-worthiness. Super long finish. Awesome, really. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1527. 12 BRAMATERRA, TENUTE SELLA 91+/100\n\nGood example of a northern Piemonte nebbiolo. Race and concentration together. Young and 2012 tight still. Yes, a firm laced expression of its vintage and its origin. Full potential. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $34.99 each PSI-1528. 18 COTES DELLA SESIA VESPOLINA, PREZIOSA 92+/100\n\nDates from the Napoleonic era; all vespolina; native yeasts; aged 8 months in oak tonneaux. Heavy Bottle Award. Mature in color and bouquet. Rich and right. Great acid here. Considerable tannin. Comes with the territory. Mouthfilling, well textured. This requests another year or two in bottle for top fulfillment. 92+/100. List price: $27.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1529. 17 COSTE DELLA SESIA ORBELLO, TENUTE SELLA 93/100\n\nFrom northern Piemonte. Boy, that's rich and gushing fruit. Wonderful. Very fruity and floral. Cherry, violet, rose. Burst of fruit and flowers. Bright northern nebbiolo with fine tannin and sweet cherry-berry fruit. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1530. 20 ERBALUCE DI CALUSO, AZ. AGR. CIECK 92/100\n\nEst. 1985; grape name a combo of 'dawn' and 'light', vines planted in early 70s and 80s; whole cluster pressed; aged 2 months on fine lees. Pretty full bodied and varietally expressive. Lots of 'stuff' here. Full, green fruited, spot on varietal character that extends through a lengthy finish. All it should be. Wants food. Very popular with the panel. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1531. 17 BAROLO ALASIA, CANTINE ARALDICA 91+/100\n\nAged three years in large oak casks. Always the relatively pale color of nebbiolo in a mixed red wine set. Really quite soft and inviting in the style of the 2017s. Cherry over tar emphasis. Well, drier and more tannic than the nose suggests. Good and old fashioned. Chewy. Palate suggests further cellaring. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1532. 15 BAROLO UNDICICOMUNI, ARNALDO RIVERA 93+/100\n\nWine Spectator 92/100. My notes: As usual, the very forgiving style of the vintage. 2015 open armed as Barolos go. Broad and powerful. Full tannin. Tight core. Very attractive. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $42.99 each PSI-1533. 17 BAROLO DI MONFORTE D'ALBA, DOMENICO CLERICO (93/100)\n\nParker 93: 'Here's an interesting change. The classic Barolo from Domenico Clerico is now labeled with its village name. The 2017 Barolo del Comune di Monforte d'Alba pours from the bottle with a bright garnet color and a medium-rich appearance. Fruit is sourced from the lower part of Pajana, the youngest vines in Ciabot Mentin and the lower part of Percristina. The wine reveals a classic profile of the Nebbiolo grape, revealing dark cherry, cassis, smoke, tar and licorice. It shows a lean and almost delicate fiber with polished and silky tannins. There were 400 magnums and 29,200 bottles released, and as a result, you get good value for this approachable price. Drink 2024-2035.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $49.99 each PSI-1534. 14 BAROLO MONTEFORTE D'ALBA, PODERE RUGGERI CORSINI 93+/100\n\nOh, this is a deep seated, traditional one. Cherry, tar, rose. Black stuff. Stubbornness of the vintage. Yeah, lots of extract and tannin. No concessions to modernity. Plenty of material. Plenty of potential. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $34.99 each PSI-1535. 17 BAROLO BUSSIA. PODERE RUGGERI CORSINI 92+/100 *\n\nVines planted 1965 mid slope on calcareous soil; aged in French barriques, 20% new. High quality cork. Medium dark red brown. 2017 medium bodied. Sequesters its aromas in a rightful manner. 2017 relative suavity up front meets a backlash of dry tannins. The fruit stamina is up to them, so I have confidence in the value of mid term cellaring. Certainly of interest at the current price. 92+/100. Well respected by attendees, who recognized the need for more bottle age.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $39.99 each PSI-1536. 18 BAROLO SURI, AZ. AGR. RIO FAVA 92+/100\n\nMedium, red brown nebbiolo color. Moderate intensity to the nose. More pliant than the hidebound traditional Barolos. Suggestions of cherry, tar, and rose. The palate has body, power, and grip. The tannins are moderate and fine grained. Well balanced flavor and feel. The finish is very long lasting. Good representative of vintage style. For mid term cellaring. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $42.99 each PSI-1537. 17 BAROLO CAMILLA,. BRUNA GRIMALDI (92/100)\n\nWine Spectator 92: 'This is vibrant and displays a beam of cherry and currant fruit flavors allied to savory elements of eucalyptus, iron, tobacco and white pepper. A solid grip of dusty tannins guards the finish. Best from 2025 through 2046. '\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $47.99 each PSI-1538. 17 BAROLO BRICCO AMBROGIO, BRUNA GRIMALDI (92/100)\n\nParker 92: 'With fruit from a one-hectare parcel in the village of Roddi with classic marl and fossil-rich soils, the Bruna Grimaldi 2017 Barolo Bricco Ambrogio is the most balanced of these new releases and the wine that ultimately shows the greatest depth and sharpness. It opens to dark and tonic layers of dried cherry and blackberry. Those fruit tones are followed by easy spice, smoke and tar. However, the Bricco Ambrogio is also best served in the context of a near or medium-term drinking window. Drink now-2035. $80.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $54.95 each PSI-1539. 18 BAROLO, MAURO MOLINO (92/100)\n\nParker 92: 'The 2018 Barolo is a lean and lively expression with wild cherry, licorice, rose water and crushed stone. Made from a blend of fruit from Annunziata and Berri in La Morra and Perno in Monforte d'Alba, this is a classic, lean-bodied Nebbiolo with an elegant close. Drink 2024-2035.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $54.95 each PSI-1540. 14 BAROLO, MONTE DEGLI ANGELI 92+/100\n\n4 generation family operation; aged 3 years in large cooperage. That's quite a sweet and large nose for the vintage. Of course, it is seven years old. It's traditionally styled, all the same. Credit the bottle age for its approachability. Suggestions of tar and roses. Medium bodied. Good, full acidity. Presence and length on the palate. Could be applied now in the right circumstance. Good cellar potential too. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $34.99 each PSI-1541. 17 BAROLO SERRALUNGA, LUIGI PIRA (92/100)\n\nParker 92: 'With fruit sourced from throughout this important Barolo subzone, the Luigi Pira 2017 Barolo del Comune di Serralunga d'Alba shows some ripeness with dried raspberry and sweet cherry. The wine delivers spice, smoke and tilled earth with some of the iron ore or rusty aromas that are so specific to this village in the Barolo appellation. To the palate, it delivers soft tannins and a mid-weight build with all the makings for another fine cut of steak. Drink 2023-2037. $45.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $42.99 each PSI-1542. 17 BAROLO, FRATELLI REVELLO (91/100)\n\nWine Spectator 91: 'Matches plum, menthol, hay and banana peel flavors to a rich texture and assertive tannins. Balanced yet compact and firm, with an abrupt finish for now. Best from 2024 through 2040. $45.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $39.99 each PSI-1543. 18 BAROLO, FRANCO SERRA 91+/100\n\nFour generation winery near Monferrato; owns 75 acres of vines; 3 week maceration, 4 week fermentation; 2 years in barrels, 20% new. Medium red brown nebbiolo color, advanced by 2 years in cooperage. A solid, standard Barolo here, neither old fashioned nor new fangled. Well poised. Good nebbiolo glycerol coats its innate tannins. Well balanced so will support more bottle age for tannin resolution and bouquet development. 91+/100. Aeration brought more forth. The group was generally even more enthusiastic than I.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $34.99 each PSI-1544. 16 BAROLO SERRALUNGA, MICHELE TALIANO 93+/100\n\nEst. 1930 at Roero. Red brown 7 year old nebbiolo color. Well, here's a 2016 that's finally sweetening up and sporting some bottle bouquet. Yes, becoming positively intricate. Nice. Tannins narrow the flavor and texture ranges still. But they're losing some grip. Finally, I'm beginning to see eye to eye with the majority of critics who rate this vintage so highly. They got to taste it early, before it shut down. Now, it's finally opening up. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $31.99 each PSI-1545. 18 BAROLO, TERRE DEL BAROLO 92+/100\n\n300-member co-op founded in 1958; aged 12 months in oak casks. Following the 'modern' claret, here's a traditional Barolo, its fruit tempered by age in seasoned cooperage. More fruit up front than usual for TdB thanks to the nature of the vintage. 2018 sweetens this up nicely, and great nebbiolo acidity supplies the foil. I would not hesitate to serve this with lamb or game this winter. It will thrive for at least a couple more years thereafter. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $34.99 each PSI-1546. 19 BAROLO ALBE, G. D. VAJRA 94+/100\n\nWine Enthusiast 94/100. My notes: Deep, sweet, racy, 19 yielding, totally harmonious. One could say 'modern'. That would be a compliment. Fully in tune with Vajra style and quality at a bargain price. Always is. Yeah, the ease and accessibility of the vintage, the harmony of Vajra. Spot on. All makes sense. 94+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $37.99 each PSI-1547. 19 BAROLO COSTE DI ROSE, AZ. AGR. G. D. VAJRA 96+/100\n\nAmple fruit, not stodgy in youth. The elegance of the site and the hand of the maker. And, to an extent, the forward nature of the vintage. Oh so silky. How often can I define a young Barolo with that word? The tannins are fine grained, pumice like. The fruit is evident and stylish. I don't have a lot of experience with Barolos from this site, yet I suspect this is a definitive rendition. 96+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $69.95 each PSI-1548. 20 BAROLO CASTIGLIONE, VIETTI (94/100)\n\n2018: Parker 94: 'Vietti has the enormous advantage of 10 MGA sites at its disposition for blending purposes (and for making single-vineyard wines). This allows them to select the fruit they want to best express any one vintage. The 2018 Barolo Castiglione draws upon those 10 sites (including the recent additions of Mosconi, Ginestra, Bricco Ravera and Briccolina) to make what is ultimately its best-selling wine This classic rendition is tonic and clean with varietal tones of wild berry, rose and rusty nail. Drink 2024-2038. $75.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $64.95 each PSI-1549. 15 BARBARESCO ALASIA, CANTINE ARALDICA 91+/100\n\nAged two years in large Slavonian oak casks. The usual old time restraints of this are loosened by 2015 ripeness and abundance. Plenty of fruit up front and still the tarry mass in the background. Not a modern nebbiolo despite the ripe vintage. Classic cherry, tar, and rose suggestions. Like a port, there's that 'grip of the gob', the core of fruit, tar, and tannin. Especially ample for Barbaresco. Destined for the cellar. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1550. 19 BARBARESCO, CASTELLO DI NEIVE (96/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 96: - EDITORS' CHOICE/TOP 100: 'This fragrant red opens with aromas of blue flower, resin, star anise and underbrush. Full-bodied and elegantly structured, the savory palate offers ripe raspberry, cranberry and baking spice alongside firm, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2027-2034. $45.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $42.99 each PSI-1551. 19 BARBARESCO, FONTANABIANCA (95/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 95 - EDITORS' CHOICE: Lovely aromas of violet, iris and perfumed berry lift out of the glass. Firmly structured and focused, the linear palate shows refinement and finesse, with taut, refined tannins framing juicy red cherry, strawberry compote and star anise. Fresh acidity keeps it vibrant and balanced. Best 2029-2039. $50.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $35.99 each PSI-1552. 18 BARBARESCO, MOCCAGATTA 92+/100\n\nThe right weight and the relatively forward nature of the vintage. Oh, yes, 2018 fruit succulence here and B'co correct weight. Fits the patterns. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $39.99 each PSI-1553. 17 BARBARESCO, CANTINA DEL PINO (93/100)\n\nParker 93: 'The Cantina del Pino 2017 Barbaresco reveals a beautifully light garnet color in the glass. The wine shows extra intensity in terms of its aromas with wild rose, lilac and cherry. That combination of floral and fruity doesn't completely define the bouquet because you also get a good dose of crushed mineral, smoke and spice. Like most of the wines I tasted from this vintage, this release shows extra power and tightness in terms of its tannins. Give it a little extra bottle time. Drink 2023-2035.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $44.99 each PSI-1554. 18 BARBARESCO SERRABOELLA, PAITIN (94/100)\n\nParker 94: 'This wine draws its fruit from across the Serraboella vineyard in Neive with vines of various ages. The 2018 Barbaresco Serraboella has a broad reach, thanks to its balanced aromas of wild berry, dried cherry, crushed roses and violets. The wine spreads cleanly over the palate, thanks to the extra volume offered by its earthy and delicately mineral flavors. Like other releases from Paitin, the standout feature here is the silky nature of the mouthfeel. Drink 2024-2038. $55.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $47.99 each PSI-1555. 15 BARBARESCO SERRABOELLA, PAITIN (94/100)\n\nWine Spectator 94: 'Hay, freshly cut grass and loam aromas segue to a core of cherry that pulls this together. The sweet fruit handles the burly tannins well, ending in a cascade of eucalyptus and tobacco notes. Best from 2023 through 2043. $48.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $42.99 each PSI-1556. 17 BARBARESCO ALBESANI, CANTINA DEL PINO (94/100)\n\nParker 94: 'Fruit from Albesani shows nice sharpness and a compact or complete profile that is typical of Nebbiolo. This site has fared well in this hot and dry vintage with intact aromas of wild berry, mineral and blue violets. The Cantina del Pino 2017 Barbaresco Albesani turns in a strong showing in terms of aromas but tapers out a bit in the palate. In this release of 3,000 bottles, the wine is driven largely by the textural and structural power of the vintage, and the fruit is a bit leaner on the finish right now. It will likely flesh out with time. Drink 2023-2038.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $54.95 each PSI-1557. 15 BARBARESCO GALLINA, CANTINA DEL PINO (95/100)\n\nParker 95+: 'Compared to the Ovello cru, the 2015 Barbaresco Gallina (with only 2,000 bottles made) offers a bit more power and intensity. This wine is solid and dense at its core, with clearly recognizable black fruit, spice and crushed stone. The warmth of the vintage has also left its mark with beautiful aromas that recall truffle or tilled earth. The wine hits the palate with firmness, bright acidity and freshness. In all, it shows terrific balance, intensity and length. $60.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $54.95 each PSI-1558. 17 BARBARESCO TORRE, PRODUTTORI DEL BARBARESCO (91/100)\n\nWine Spectator 91: 'A beam of cherry introduces this lithe red, shaded by tar, eucalyptus, white pepper and earth notes. This is dense, with the tannins leaving a firm impression on the finish. Best from 2024 through 2037.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $47.99 each PSI-1559. 19 BARBARESCO, FRANCO SERRA 93+/100\n\nFour generation winery near Monferrato; owns 75 acres of vines; 3 week maceration, 4 week fermentation; 2 years in barrels, 20% new. Paler and ruddier still. Oh, that is smooth and inviting already in this great, forward B'co vintage. Yeah, 'legere'. Offers little resistance, though it will gain a lot more bottle bouquet. Flavorful and long. 93+/100. Commentators considered it both age worthy and price worthy.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $28.99 each PSI-1560. 16 BARBARESCO, MAURO VEGLIO (93/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 93 - EDITORS' CHOICE: 'Red-berry, dog-rose and grilled herb aromas mingle together in the glass along with a whiff of eucalyptus. On the smooth full-bodied palate, notes of licorice and vanilla accent a core of ripe black cherry. Polished, enveloping tannins provide smooth support. Drink through 2028. $40.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $27.99 each PSI-1561. 17 BARBARESCO LA CASA IN COLLINA, VITE COLTE 91+/100\n\nCooperative of 180 growers cultivating 750 acres; 1 year in large barrels followed by 1 year in bottle before release. Constrained; proper. Overwhelmed by the former wine. Neat and discreet 2017 medium intense style. That's got all the right stuff for an ageworthy (mid term) 17 nebbiolo of Barbaresco weight. Well balanced. Cellar it awhile. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $25.99 each PSI-1562. 17 BARBARESCO LA CASA IN COLLINA, VITE COLTE magnum 91+/100\n\nCooperative of 180 growers cultivating 750 acres; 1 year in large barrels followed by 1 year in bottle before release. Constrained; proper. Overwhelmed by the former wine. Neat and discreet 2017 medium intense style. That's got all the right stuff for an ageworthy (mid term) 17 nebbiolo of Barbaresco weight. Well balanced. Cellar it awhile. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $94.95 each PSI-1563. 20 NEBBIOLO D'ALBA OCHETTI, RENATO RATTI 91+/100\n\n2017: Fresh cherry nebbiolo with light tar overtone. Medium body appropriate to the DOC, fine tannin, and varietal validity. Cellar it a bit longer. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $22.99 each PSI-1564. 19 NEBBIOLO D'ALBA INDIGENOUS, GIORGIO RIVETTI 91+/100\n\n13 year old vines at 1000' elevation in Roero; aged 10 months in seasoned French oak barrels. Sweet fruited and pretty open knit for its type. Forward vintage it seems. Firm backdrop all the same. Not a lot of the classic nebbiolo scents coming forth upon opening. Well, the palate is classically firm and tannic. The tannins are fine grained, not rustic. Good length. I'd be cellaring it a couple of years. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1565. 19 NEBBIOLO D'ALBA BRUMO, SAN SILVESTRO 91/100\n\n2018: The fruit forward nature of the vintage is flattering to this cuvee, which can be standoffish in youth. Yes, sweet cherry nebbiolo to the fore. Has form and foundation too. Ready to serve. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1566. 21 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, AZ. AGR. ELIO ALTARE 1++/100\n\nAt La Morra. That's a nice and pure Langhe nebbiolo. No pretensions of Barolo grandeur. Just fruity and gently flowing. Light tannic grip keeps it serious for food. Flavorful. Good acid in 2021. Hits my sweet spot. Apply now or later. Long finish. 91++/100. Agreeing it was still a little tannic, that didn't bother most commentators. Wine of the Night for one.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $26.99 each PSI-1567. 18 LANGHE NEBBIOLO ARCAPLA COSTA DI BUSSIA, TENUTA ARNULFO 92+/100\n\nEst. 1874 at Monforte d'Alba; all nebbiolo; aged in French oak barriques. Ah, fruit here. Of the stalwart, serious nebbiolo sort. Wild cherry emphasis. This has form, material, varietal contents. Upright nebbiolo made for cellaring. Tannins need time to melt away. 92+/100. Tasted 6/8/22.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $22.99 each PSI-1568. 19 LANGHE NEBBIOLO CAPISME E, DOMENICO CLERICO (92/100)\n\nParker 92: 'The Domenico Clerico 2019 Langhe Nebbiolo Capismee is named after the local slang for 'do you understand me.' That's a fun twist because ultimately the wine is articulate and clear in its message, thanks to its variety-pure aromas of dark fruit, crushed rose, tar, smoke and licorice. Of course, this release offers all that typicity with a flair for the informal and the accessible. That's all we need to understand. Drink now-2025.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1569. 19 LANGHE NEBBIOLO MARTINENGA, TENUTE CISA ASINARI DEI MARCHESI DI GRESY 91+/100\n\nEst 1797; Martinenga is one of Piemonte's largest monopole crus; from vines 15-40 years old; no barrel aging. This greets me with some relief after a pair of 2018 clarets. The elevation, the variety, the vintage: all support uplift. Plus this guy makes stylish wines. Classic tar and roses aromas. Tannin masks a lot of that appeal on the palate. Di Gresy is also known for well framed wines. Tannin resolution and bouquet development each call for cellaring. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $25.99 each PSI-1570. 21 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, MAURO MOLINO 91+/100\n\nEst. 1953 at La Morra. Medium red brown. Soft, mellow, advanced. Surprise. Ah, but what a back bite of tannin! And acid. And astringency. Two tales to tell. Intriguing cellar possibilities. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $27.99 each PSI-1571. 20 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, CANTINA DEL PINO 1++/100\n\nIn 1997 the winegrowing Vacca family left the Barbaresco cooperative to make their own wines; mainly from younger vines; unwooded. Medium dark, ruddy nebbiolo appearance. Still shy, but showing much more personality than it did a few months back. And greater softness. Dry and firm on the palate still. This is one serious Langhe Nebbiolo, nearing the build and potential of a Barbaresco. Glad I'm giving it another try. Cellar away some more. 91++/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $25.99 each PSI-1572. 22 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, PRODUTTORI DEL BARBARESCO 93+/100\n\nFrom vineyards in Barbaresco, Neive, and Treiso. Medium ruby. Strong and hefty, as the Produttori's nebbiolos are apt to be. Looks expensive..until you sniff it. More than just a baby Barbaresco. An adolescent, at least. Classic aromas and flavors of cherry, tar, and rose. Fine acidity and great suavity. Will probably cellar well, if one can resist putting it right to use with hearty fare. This is a much more satisfying experience than mass produced, cheap Barolos and B'cos that can be seen in the same price range. 93+/100. Widely admired. Cellaring suggested. 'Lots of real nebbiolo fruit plus lots of hard tannins.' 'Proper nebbiolo in there, both in flavor and acidity.' 'All the classic notes: cherry, rose, tar.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $31.99 each PSI-1573. 22 LANGHE NEBBIOLO ROSSO DI ROCCA, ALBINO ROCCA 92+/100\n\nEst. 1960. From a vineyard purchased in 2016, vines planted 1967-2002. Lighter color. Lighter on the approach too. In fact, heart on sleeve. Buoyant sweet cherry fruit. Cool and racy, with good acidity. Lightly chewy tannin. At the opposite end of the nebbiolo spectrum from Barolo. Lasting flavor and texture. 16.7+. Attendees appreciated its vivid varietal character. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1574. 21 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, FRANCO SERRA 91+/100\n\nFour generation winery near Monferrato; owns 75 acres of vines; 25 year old vines on calcareous soil at 1000'. Nebbiolo's medium dark, ruddy red color. Freshness and buoyancy in cool 2021. Upon opening, not a lot of varietal aroma formed yet. The flavors are coming on though. Tar, dried cherry, subtle suggestion of rose. I like the texture. Medium bodied and just lightly tannic compared to the Big Two nebbiolos. Good acidity. Has poise. 91+/100. With two hours' aeration, this came on like gangbusters. 'What a nose!! (times 2).' 'Palate too; terrific stuff.' 'Beguiling.' Very popular with the tasting panel.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1575. 20 LANGHE NEBBIOLO, G. D. VAJRA 92+/100\n\nFrom estate vineyards around the winery 10-25 years old; aged in seasoned cooperage. Proper medium red orange appearance. Oh, my. Bursting with cherry pie aroma tweaked by anise and dried orange peel. What I'm looking for in Langhe nebbiolo. Add rose to the flavor profile. Melted tannins already. Adequate acid vigor. Medium flavor intensity. More to come. Nose showier than palate at opening. The palate caught up over the next couple of hours. Universal praise from the commentators. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1576. 19 LANGHE NEBBIOLO PERBACCO, VIETTI 92+/100 *\n\nFrom several parcels in Barolo; formed from lots that don't make the cut for its Castiglione Barolo. A lovely, sweet, new wave nebbiolo, a consistent Vietti go to bottle. Cherry and pitch. Flavors confirm aromas. Suave and burnished texture. Good acid. No need to cellar, though a modicum of fine tannins will help it stay the course. Well liked by the group. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $28.99 each PSI-1577. 19 LANGHE NEBBIOLO BRICCO MAGNO, VILLADORIA 91+/100 *\n\nProper medium dark red orange nebbiolo at age four. Sweet, open, and welcome 2019 style relative to the norm for nebbiolo. Yeah, there a certain roundness here up front, yet a modicum of dry tannins in back. At the price, a good bet for the cellar. 91+/100. After aeration, the tannins seem to have melted away. Enjoyed by attendees for current drinking.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1578. 17 ROERO NEBBIOLO, MALVIRA 93/100\n\nEst. 1950. From the top of the Trinita cru, one of Roero's best, where clay-dominant soil makes for an especially full bodied nebbiolo. Aged 18 months in puncheons, half new, half once used. Well, this is my definition of Roero nebbiolo, distinctive from Alba and Langhe renditions. Bursting with 'griottes' (wild cherries) as well as tar and roses. Racy fruit acidity gives extra vigor. Ready to put to use. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1579. 22 LANGHE ROSSO, G. D. VAJRA 92/100\n\nNebbiolo, dolcetto, barbera, albarossa, freisa, pinot nero. Skillful assemblage, all harmonious. Airs of cedar and spice point to a whole greater than the sum of the parts. This is really engaging, as well as priceworthy. The palate is also enticingly fruity-spicy and doesn't point to any grape variety in particular, unless it's albarossa, with which I'm not very familiar. I've been pleased with this cuvee before but never so much as in this vintage. Bright acidity plus extract-giving texture. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1580. 21 BARBERA D'ALBA, AZ. AGR. ELIO ALTARE 92+/100\n\n10-30 year old vines on calcaire and sand; aged 5 months in seasoned French oak barriques. Lush and spicy, especially for Alba and 2021. This really is a singular barbera nose. Augmented by barrel time if not barrel extracts. Great 2021 acid. Full, fine grained tannin hems in the lushness on the palate. Watch it go and grow. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $24.99 each PSI-1581. 19 BARBERA D'ALBA, AZ. AGR. ELIO ALTARE 92+/100\n\nA visit to Burgundy in 1976 inspired Elio to move the family's wines toward elegance and finesse. Well, this just soars. It's brandied cherry, big time black peppercorn, tar, and nettle. Class act. Suave thanks to high alcohol and fine craftsmanship. 2019 medium bodied. Full flavored through the long finish. Elegant indeed. What he does. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $22.99 each PSI-1582. 21 BARBERA D'ALBA VIGNA CAMPO DEL GATTO COSTA DI BUSSIA, TENUTA ARNULFO 92+/100\n\nEst. 1874; one hectare vineyard on marl, planted in 1969; aged 30 months in foudres. As powerful as its alcohol statement (15%) suggests. Alba barbera dark, deep, peppery. Old vines; peels extract. 2021 freshness adds all the more interest. Wears its power well on the palate. No heat. Old vines meet cool vintage to form a unique expression of this steady favorite of mine. Another cellar candidate. 92+/100. Generally liked. 'Lots of juicy fruit. One of the better barberas I've had.' ' Very nice barbera. Great structure, fruit, tannins.' Orders taken.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $24.99 each PSI-1583. 18 BARBERA D'ALBA BRICCO DEL PILONE, AZ. AGR. PIERO BENEVELLI 92+/100\n\nEst. 1978; 25 year old vines; aged a year in seasoned cooperage. Alba barbera dark and deep. No longer resistant at age five. 2018 fruit purity plus a noteworthy degree of freshness and finesse, which might be attributed to its 'bricco' (brow of the hill) site. Great acidity of barbera. Earning some suavity with bottle age. Plenty more in store. A class act that was much more expensive at release. Better drinking and better price now. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1584. 17 BARBERA D'ALBA CONCHA TRE PILE, ALDO CONTERNO (93/100)\n\nParker 93: 'The 2017 Barbera d'Alba Conca Tre Pile is piled high with dark fruit intensity, soft tannins and a pinch of fresh acidity that breaks apart the wine's rich fruit flavors. The hot vintage has taken well to the Barbera grape, accentuating its volume, richness and generosity. The bouquet offers black fruit, dried plum, spice, truffle-infused earth and toasted hazelnut. Drink now-2025. $35.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $29.99 each PSI-1585. 18 BARBERA D'ALBA CONCHA TRE PILE, ALDO CONTERNO (93/100)\n\n2017: Parker 93: 'The 2017 Barbera d'Alba Conca Tre Pile is piled high with dark fruit intensity, soft tannins and a pinch of fresh acidity that breaks apart the wine's rich fruit flavors.

My notes: Est. 1953 at La Morra; 20% from marl in La Morra, 80% from sand in Roero. Nose rich and right but less forthcoming than at a Sept trade show (longer aeration then-). Great, splashy fruit acidity and barbera dark disposition. Expands greatly on the palate, while retaining a good measure of fine tannin. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1587. 19 BARBERA D'ALBA PAJENA. ENRICO SERAFINO 91/100\n\nFull, dark color. Alba power, body, extract, pepper. 2019 more open on the palate and less tannic than expected. Say, this is a proper Alba barbera and a good price, and the palate says you can take it to the table. No big time tannin issues. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1588. 21 BARBERA D'ALBA, FRANCO SERRA 91/100\n\nFour generation winery near Monferrato; owns 75 acres of vines. Nice violet glow. Even more uplifting than the joyous 2020. Black cherry, peppercorn. Flavors confirm. Good varietal glycerol and vintage bright acidity. Put it right to use. Just a little tannin in back, accentuated by the cellar service temperature after half an hour under refrigeration. 91/100. Well liked overall for its fresh approach, readiness, and value. One commentator notes: 'Fresh, plummy, huge mid-palate surprise of chocolate, sesame; berry jam finish.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1589. 18 BARBERA D'ASTI MONTEBRUNA, BRAIDA DI GIACOMO BOLOGNA (91/100)\n\nParker 91: 'With a beautifully saturated dark color and lots of generous cherry and blackberry, there's a lot packed into this bottle of Braida 2018 Barbera d'Asti Montebruna. The fruit is plump, succulent and packed tight. Montebruna is distinguished by its bright acidity and you get lots of that here too. This is always a terrific wine.

On the palate, the wine showcases giving characteristics of plum jam and blackberry compote, candied violets and clove while maintaining classic Barbera acidity.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $24.99 each PSI-1591. 18 BARBERA D'ASTI SUPERIORE BRICCO PARADISO, TENUTA IL FALCHETTO 92/100\n\nEst. 1940; single vineyard, one of nine owned by the Forno brothers.; aged a year in French barriques. Heady power. About the biggest Asti barbera I've nosed. Speaks for superiore. Mouthfilling, flavorful. Rounder and more yielding than the nose suggested. That's 2018 talking. Balanced and lasting. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1592. 20 BARBERA DASTI LERADICI, MAURO MOLINO (91/100)\n\nWine Spectator 91: 'A distinctive red, offering raspberry, blueberry and earth flavors, matched to a supple texture.

Both sweet and racy. Well balanced delivery. Bricco indeed. No need to postpone gratification. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1598. 20 BARBERA D'ASTI BATTAGLIONE, RENATO RATTI (91/100)\n\nParker 91: 'Part of the soldier's series in which each bottle shows the antique uniforms of various fractions of the Italian military, the Renato Ratti 2020 Barbera d'Asti Battaglione is a ripe, soft and full-bodied expression that exhibits the natural sweetness of Barbera with dark berry and cherry confit.

Deep red violet color.This is going to need further aeration. There's a lot of fruit concentration present, but it's not pushing forth much aroma at opening. Very pretty and pure dolcetto all the same. More fruit develops as it warms in the mouth. Shows the good flair of 2021, a good vintage for dolcetto. Extract and some fine tannin will carry it on. Not one of those too big for its boots dolcettos. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1607. 21 DOLCETTO D'ALBA, AZ. VIT.

Ruddy red color. An attractive warmth to the fruit. Runs deep and savory. Its own thing. Palate confirms fruit ripeness, suavity. Good acid to counter. No tannin, so could be served cool.

FRANCESCO BOSCHIS 92/100\n\n2021: Vines planted between 1985 and 2015 at 400 to 550 meters on the Pianezzo hillside. Distinctively Dogliani dolcetto, not Alba.

Plus body and texture. Handsome degree of generosity and fulfillment on the palate. Long finish. Bravo. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1616. 19 GRIGNOLINO D'ASTI ISOLAVILLA, TENUTA OLIM BAUDA 91+/100\n\n65 year old vines in sandy white marl. Appropriately light color. I've seen darker roses. Strawberry and cola aromas. Fresh, bright, spot on. Very tasty. Surprising amount of tannin in back probably precludes serving it chilled this summer. Great acidity. Many food options now, plus a few months for tannin resolution a good option. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1617. 20 GRIGNOLINO D'ASTI, AZ. AGR. LA MIRAJA 91/100\n\nProper light red orange. Fresh, sharp, penetrating, ideal. Then comes a fetching roundness. Yes, sharp acid assault followed by a smoother background. Cool it down for summer rosso pleasure. Antipasto wine. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1618. 19 PIEMONTE ROSSO, PAOLO SCAVINO (92/100)\n\nWine Spectator 92: 'Black currant, violet and rosemary settle nicely into the succulent texture of this red. Firm and elegant, yet shows intensity and fine length. Nebbiolo, Merlot, Barbera and Dolcetto. Drink now through 2024.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1619. 20 PIEMONTE PINOT NOIR COLLEZIONE DEL BARONE, MONTE DEGLI ANGELI 91/100\n\nThat's a good NW Italy pinot! Works at area and varietal. Yes again. Great acidity. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1620. PIEMONTE BRACHETTO BIRBET, MALVIRA 94/100\n\nSpecial clone of brachetto. Pleasingly sweet and proper. Sweet. Very light fizz. Lots of varietal concentration. A winner. 94/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1621. PIEMONTE BRACHETTO BIRBET, MICHELE TALIANO 92/100\n\n5.5%. Dry berry nose. Has spritz. Sweet berry taste. Right. Retains spritz second evening. Plummy. Yes. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1622. 21 PIEMONTE BRACHETTO, BORGO MARAGLIANO 92/100\n\nRight, lithe, fresh. Replete with red fruit cremes. Lifted. Full of ease and gaiety. All the right assets. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1623. 18 ITALIA BIGARO, ELIO PERRONE 93/100\n\nHalf each brachetto, moscato. Good, subtle muscat display complemented by brachetto pink fruit. Rich, round, pomaded. Cold cream aromatics and feel. Rose, peach, cherry creme. Spot on. Uber appeal. Doesn't get any better than this. 93/100.\n\n(End of Bin Sale-- 20% off this price)\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1624. 22 ITALIA ROSSO AMABILE SERENA, AZ. AGR. CASCINA PIAN D'OR 92/100\n\nHighly scented. Bergamot, barbershop, briar. Signs of brachetto, freisa, malvasia, moscato. This is superior to previous cuvees. Full flavor, sweetness, sprightliness, persistence. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1625. ITALIA ROSSO DULCIS, SAN SILVESTRO 92/100\n\nBrachetto and freisa. Back to a sweeter disposition on the nose. Yeah, fully back. Fruit sweetness, acid, richness. Low alcohol. Very, very successful. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1626. 21 MALVASIA DI CASTELNUOVO DON BOSCO LITTLE BOSCO, LOVISOLO 91/100\n\nBeautiful malvasia. The DOC, the fizz, the raspberry. Hint of almond, cherry pit. Pleasing flavor intensity in 16. Good balance. Attractive little fizz. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1627. 19 CASORZO MALVASIA NAUFRAGAR, AGRICOLA SULIN 95/100\n\n6%. Frizzante. Glows and entices. Maraschino and black cherries. Bursts with flavor. Total allure. Well balanced sweet-acid ratio. Even some light tannin etch. Exotic. 95/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1628. 21 ROERO ARNEIS LE TRE, MALABAILA DI CANALE 92/100\n\nPeach, kernel, and a certain nuttiness not usually found in arneis. It's positive, and surprising in 2021. Plenty of varietal glycerol. Flavorful. The acid is buffering. Altogether, a successful and special take. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1629. 22 ROERO ARNEIS, AZ. AGR. MALVIRA 91/100\n\nEst. 1950; 50 year old vines in calcareous clay and sand soils across 4 vineyards, including Rensio, first identified with arneis in 1478. Cold sample; nose shy. Warming in the mouth brings out more varietal character. I love the form, the framework; exceptional for the vintage. Good acid. The fruit filling is firm and food worthy. I suppose I like this best for its textural aspects. Good juice. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1630. 19 ROERO ARNEIS RENESIO, AZ. AGR. MALVIRA 93/100\n\nThis is bright, fresh, alert, crisp. It offers up a generous noseful of varietal character. And both feel and flavor are full too. Racy acidity. Impressive. Arneis and a half. Best vintage of this I've tasted. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1631. 20 ROERO ARNEIS SERRA LUPINI, ANGELO NEGRO 92/100\n\nEst. 1670; 20% cryomaceration; 4 months on lees, Mmm, stone fruit and lemon meringue. One expressive arneis. Medium bodied. Good acidity and overall balance. Tangy finale. Shows the way. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1632. 20 ROERO ARNEIS, VIETTI (90/100)\n\nParker 90: 'Vietti's cheerful and bright 2020 Roero Arneis reveals a punchy note of fresh lemon, waxy nectarine, dried hay and oregano. This is a lean-bodied expression that avoids the extra fruit weight or honey-like creaminess that comes naturally to this grape. In this wine, the sharper, more mineral-driven notes have been highlighted instead. $30.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $22.99 each PSI-1633. 21 LANGHE ARNEIS, ELVIO TINTERO 91/100\n\nArneis stone fruit and herb and florals range. And a nice, nippy 2021 statement. Unexpected yet pleasing soft core of fruit. The promised 2021 acidity persists. And the flavor range. Not as ample as the average Roero arneis. Fills the bill nonetheless--at a lower price. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1634. 23 ROERO ARNEIS, VIETTI 93+/100\n\nOne of the saviors of arneis, Vietti continues to get it right. Substantial oomph here as always and quite a bit of floral varietal character already, though I suspect more will come. Suave, burnished texture is just right. As is the acid ring in the back. Just a splendid example, in tune with the series and one of the prominent vintages. Well balanced to boot. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $24.99 each PSI-1635. 22 ROERO ARNEIS VILLATA, VITE COLTE 92/100\n\nThis is one forceful arneis. Not emphatically fruit driven. Just nostril filling and etching. Like the nose, enough aromatics. Still, its forte is texture and volume. Singular, and fairly priced. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1636. 21 LANGHE ARNEIS BRICCO CAPPELLINA, SOC. AGR. VOERZIO MARTINI 91+/100\n\nScion of Giovanni Voerzio at La Morra; vineyard planted 1982; sandy soil; 12 hour cryomaceration. This isn't very forthcoming upon opening. More revealing after aeration. Palate still tight and austere. Shows class and intrigue. And the price is right. Worth following. 91+/100. One attendee agreed and ordered a case.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1637. 19 LANGHE FAVORITA ONORATA, ANGELO NEGRO 91/100 *\n\nEst. 1670; vineyard in Roero; favorita = vermentino; cryomaceration; aged 3 months on lees. A nice, cooler climate, higher altitude take on vermentino versus the Sardinian and Tuscan versions. More related to a Cinqjue Terre version. I applaud its daintiness, its finesse. Undeniable varietal ID, including white flower highlights. Moderate acidity and medium body. Good now. Very popular with the group. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1638. 21 COLLI TORTONESI TIMORASSO PICCOLO DERTHONA, AZ. AGR. REPETTO 91/100\n\nEst. 2015; timorasso, like arneis, almost went extinct. A neat and discreet take in cool 2021 compared to the 2020. More mineral and less stone fruit. More richness and roundness comes out on the palate, more varietal give and flavor. Still, the acid is keen and keeps it refreshing and mealworthy. Ultimately, this well defines timorasso, and at a bargain price as these go. Nice soft landing at the end. 91/100. Intrigued and won attendee respect for its representation of this unique grape variety.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1639. 21 COLLI TORTONESI TIMORASSO PICCOLO DERTHONA, AZ. AGR.MANDIROLA\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $26.99 each PSI-1640. 20 COLLI TORTONESI TIMORASSO PICCOLO DERTHONA, LA SPINETTA 93/100\n\nEstate bottled; indigenous variety on the rise; 25 year old vineyard on marl; native yeasts; cryomaceration; lees aged; rhino label by Albrecht Durer. Age has stood this one well. Really well filled out varietal character. Dazzling, zesty, spicy, incisive nostril play. Equally engaging on the palate. Rangy in flavor, full bodied, great acidity as well as varietal padding. I'll have buyers for this. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $35.99 each PSI-1641. 19 GAVI, BENI DI BATASIOLO\n\n(End of Bin Sale-- 20% off this price)\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1642. 21 GAVI IL FORTE, PRODUTTORI DEL GAVI 91/100 *\n\n95 member cooperative founded 1951. Somewhat reticent upon opening. Suggests cortese ID. Oh, but it bursts open after warming in the mouth. Pear, lemon, sage. Fine balance, acid, and texture. Long finish. Prefer to the 2019. 91/100. The nose opened fully for the group 2 hours later. One attendee noted: 'my wine of the night.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1643. 22 GAVI MASERA, AZ. AGR. STEFANO MASSONE 92/100 *\n\nA vineyard in the warmer reaches of southeastern Gavi planted in 1978. Apple and sage classic aroma set. And it penetrates well too. Good acid, good texture. Little of the vintage's plumpness, softness. This vies with the 2021 for refreshment, balance, classicism, and flavor delivery. 92/100. Very popular with attendees; orders taken. 'Wow, lovely wine; huge nose and palate.' 'With time, floral elements and peach/apricot aromatics developing.' 'Lush, smooth, full, inviting; a joy.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1644. 21 GAVI DI GAVI, TENUTA OLIM BAUDA 92/100 *\n\nEst 1961; all cortese; from the core community of the DOCG. That's a good, edgy, snappy 2021 take. More vigor than the satisfying 2020. Cortese classic right down to the sage suggestion. Even richer, racier and more expansive than the bottle I tasted very cold and upon opening yesterday. Super. Full palate savor, flavor, feel, definition. Boy, this just swells up in the mouth too. Both race and padding. Well liked by attendees, one noting 'what I want in a Gavi'. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1645. 22 GAVI DEL COMUNE DI GAVI ROVERETO, AZ. AGR. ERNESTO PICOLLO 92/100\n\nEst. 1945 at Rovereto, the best sector of the DOCG; no malo. Boy, that's got Gavi down pat. Orchard fruits in subtle form and that dash of sage. Flavorful, perfectly harmonious, well poised. Adequate acidity gives a brisk, bright finish. At one of the lowest GdG prices on the market. 92/100. 'Flowers, herbs, apples, minerals.' Lots of 'great value' comments. Orders taken.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1646. 23 GAVI DI GAVI GRIFO DEL QUARTARO, ENRICO SERAFINO 91/100 *\n\n2020: Est. 1878; 10-25 year old vines in marl, clay, chalk; estate bottled. Accurate, if a little subdued at this stage. Maybe it will open up for the group. Medium bodied. Gathering a slightly grainy patina nearing age two. Let's see what aeration does. Well, it jump started this. It was reported super fruity and ripe, and even better the next day. The relative softness of 2020. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $22.99 each PSI-1647. 21 GAVI, FRANCO SERRA 92/100\n\nFrom 20 year old vines in calcareous soil at 1000 feet. Boy, that's a fresh, green scented one. Ho, hum, just another racy Euro 2021 white. Deep seated cortese fruit character. Great acid, plus cortese glycerol roundness. Very flavorful and lasting in both flavor and texture. A top vintage of this, and, a bargain. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1648. 20 GAVI DEL COMUNE DI GAVI, AZ. AGR. VILLA SPARINA 92/100\n\nOwned by the Moccagatta fmaily since the late 70s; 30 year old vines; unique bottle shape inspired by one found in the villa's ancient cellars; James Suckling 91/100. Oh, that's a good, rich, explicit Gavi nose of pear, pollen, and sage. Nothing shy about this baby. Full flavored too. Great acid. And light glycerol padding. Power beyond its statement. Lasting, flavorful, well textured finish. The group enjoyed it. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1649. 22 MOSCATO D'ASTI LA CALIERA, BORGO MARAGLIANO 95/100\n\nFresh, fragrant. Peach, apricot. Flowers. Creamy. Rose, cold cream. Padded with just the right sweetness. Beautiful. 95/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1650. 21 MOSCATO DASTI, TENUTA IL FALCHETTO\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1651. 21 MOSCATO D'ASTI DULCIS, CANTINA SAN SILVESTRO\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1652. 22 MOSCATO D'ASTI, AZ. AGR. PAOLO SARACCO (93/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 93: 'This Moscato d'Asti is vibrant and electric on the nose, with freshly cut peach, candied lemon zest, fresh mint and wildflowers all swirling out of the glass. It's sweet but not cloying and has loads of stone fruits on the palate. The balance of this wine is masterful with zippy acidity that keeps the wine lively at all times and each glass as refreshing as the first. $19.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1653. 22 MOSCATO D'ASTI SORI GRAMELLA, AZ. AGR. ELVIO TINTERO 92+/100\n\nVery, very bright, lifted, even soaring. Sweet and fresh. At a nice stage, yet a few more weeks in bottle will augment its aromatic profile. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1654. 22 MOSCATO D'ASTI, VAJRA 95/100\n\nDelicate and accurate. Really crisp. Young; just shipped. Sweet and perfumed. Rose and mum. Fabulous. 95/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1655. 20 LUGANA MUSA, AZ. AGR. BUGLIONI 92/100\n\nAll trebbiano di lugana; vine age: 5 years. Fresh, handsome, and a spot on expression of the variety's pear like quality. Nice and sweet ripe, cuddly fruit plus a racy streak of acidity. Long aftertaste. Ideal. Worth the premium price. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1656. 22 LUGANA, AZ. AGR. CA' LOJERA 91/100 *\n\nAll turbiana; 30 year old vines on white clay. Remarkably different aromatic profile from the Gavi that preceded it, though neither gets into the pungently aromatic field. Mineral dusting over seckel pear. Very intense and pure. The acidity is adequate, and the flavor is up to the aroma profile. Moderately long aftertaste. Will satisfy a wide audience. 91/100. Popular with attendees. 'Mineral driven, good acid cut.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1657. 20 LUGANA, SOC. AGR. CA' MAIOL 91/100\n\nTrebbiano di lugana; limestone soil, clay subsoil. Boy, this has a lot of nasal character too, complicated by two years' aging, which adds a nutty aspect. Never smelled a Lugana quite like this one. Juicy, full bodied and flavored. Pretty large scale stuff. No aperitif. Take it to the table with poultry in a cream sauce. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1658. 21 LUGANA, SOC. AGR. OTTELLA 92/100 *\n\nOf turbiana, relative of verdicchio; chalky clay soil. A lot of citrus and passion fruit. Rounder, less incisive than sauvignon blanc, though it elicits some of the same images. Certainly nothing to do with Marche verdicchio. Highly desirable, as always. The aromatic exuberance on the palate is thankfully toned down. The acid and textural spiel take over. Quite the quaffer in 2021. Less minerally than the 21 Creete. Well priced. Popular with attendees. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1659. 22 LUGANA LE CREETE, SOC. AGR. OTTELLA (91/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 91: 'Heady on the nose with citrus, tropical fruit and jasmine aromas. This dances on the palate with electric lemon, grapefruit and apricot notes finishing with crisp acidity. $25.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1660. 21 LUGANA LE CREETE, SOC. AGR. OTTELLA 93/100\n\nAlmost water white. Pungent and penetrating. Really pumps it out. In tune with the series. Equally flavorful. Passion fruit and ripe citrus. Buoyant and lasting. 93/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1661. 20 CUSTOZA SUPERIORE RIFLESSO, SOC. AGR. CORTE FORNELLO 92/100 *\n\nGarganega, chardonnay, tocai, fernanda (cortese), trebbiano; from stony moraine hillside soil above Lake Garda; aged 8 months, partly in barrels. Valid combo. The varieties are Custoza compatible, and the most aromatic, garganega, stands out. On the palate too. Good body. One of the best put together Custozas I've tasted. 92/100. Enjoyed by all attendees, who were surprised by it freshness, aromatic profile, amplitude, balance, and overall class.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1662. 22 CUSTOZA, AZ. AGR. GORGO 91/100\n\nEst 1975; garganega, bianca fernanda (local cortese relative), trebbiano toscano. Stands up for its rights as a respectably fragrant garganega, with body. A notable rep for its DOCG. Continues to fill out as it airs. Softer than the 2021, of course. Adequate acid for refreshment though. Flavors echo aromas. Satisfactory intensity. Good value for sure. Versatile at the table. 91/100. Very popular; orders taken. 'Delish; lovely summer stuff; nice flavor and balance.' 'Excellent; great acid and fruit.' 'Mineral/tonic tones.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1663. 21 CUSTOZA, AZ. AGR. MONTE DEL FRA 91/100\n\nGarganega, trebbiano toscano, cortese; southeast of Lake Garda. One of the 'largest' Custozas I've nosed. Extreme garganega gets into the bitter tropical flower aspects. Flavorful too. And quite full for 2021, though acidity is not lacking. Its own thing, really, and not likely to appeal to all. I applaud its uniqueness. 91/100. Yet it DID appeal to all. And following aeration, a wide spectrum of aromatic pleasures. Many orders taken.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1664. 22 VENEZIE PINOT GRIGIO, AZ. AGR. AI GALLI 90/100\n\nFull. Basic Accurate and generous. Yes, full. Grigio body and texture are its fortes. 90/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1665. 22 VENEZIE PINOT GRIGIO, CORTENOVA 92/100\n\nWow. This is right. A bit softer than the 2021, which makes sense. Full display of grigio apple and nut sensations. Yeah, rounder than the 21. So full of flavor and varietal character. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1666. 22 VENEZIE PINOT GRIGIO CANTINA RIFF, LAGEDER 90/100\n\nYes, the soft approach of 2022 and the briskness that marks this series. Great winemaking here. Good varietal apple-nut-citrus varietal set. Nice and crisp on the finish. 90/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1667. 22 VENEZIE PINOT GRIGIO, TI GA 91/100\n\nI appreciate the modest 12% strength. Very elegant perfume for pinot grigio. Nothing else like it. Yes, finely aromatic, attractively light-middle weight. Good acid for balance. Unique in its genre in terms of flavor, structure, persona. Total appeal. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $9.99 each PSI-1668. 20 VENEZIE PINOT GRIGIO, TIZIANO 91/100\n\nHonors Tiziano Vecellio, greatest painter of the 16th century Venetian school. Fresh, crisp, and grigio full. Just right. Soft, with down the middle acidity. Will please a wide audience. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1669. 19 DOLOMITI PINOT NOIR PRENDO, WILHEM WALCH 91+/100\n\nEst 1869 at Tramin; aged in large Slavonian oak casks A rather lean and tart take, which is the usual from these parts. Certainly not severe. There's plenty of varietal character and even an attractive measure of fruit sweetness after aeration. Reads high altitude pinot. More power, texture, body, and flavor ripeness and intensity than the nose suggests. Filling and lasting. I'm impressed. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1670. 15 TEROLDEGO ROTALIANO, LECHTHALER 91+/100\n\n13%. Full dark color, with rim reddening. A warm and savory 2015 ripe vintage nose, with high altitude lift as well. Even more freshness and buoyancy in the palate, while maintain those 2015 savors. Growth to go. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1671. 16 DOLOMITI TERRE DI SAN LEONARDO, SAN LEONARDO 92+/100\n\nEst. 1724; centuries old tenuta; site of the signing of the WWI armistice between Italy and Austria; now planted entirely to Bordeaux varieties; 50% cab sauv, 40% merlot; 10% carmenere; aged 2 years in new and seasoned French oak barrels. Linear style like a 2016 claret. Assuaged by a long sojourn in cooperage. High altitude cool aspect, Certainly no green fruit like in some NE Italy 'clarets'. Oh, the palate has real sweetness and suavity, grace and balance. Invites current use. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1672. 22 ALTO ADIGE LAGREIN, ELENA WALCH 92/100 *\n\nUndergoes malo in French and Slavonian oak barrels followed by aging in large cooperage. Saturated red violet color. Oh, boy, that's lagrein black cherry to the ultimate. Nose as saturated as the appearance. Full and flavorful. 2022 forward. Good acidity for the vintage spells balance. Lagrein doesn't get much bigger and more explicit than this. Still, it's not too big for its boots. Has that innate elegance of all Walch wines. 92/100. Well liked by attendees for its distinctive character.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1673. 17 ALTO ADIGE BISCHOFSLEITEN, CASTEL SALLEGG 91/100\n\nSingle vineyard schiava of Lago di Caldaro Scelto Classico Superiore; est. 1851; family owned. Fresh, neat, cool, bright. Ideal. 17 rich fruit too. Racy. Great texture and edge. No oak or fruit tannin so good cool. And good now. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $17.99 each PSI-1674. 21 ALTO ADIGE SCHIAVA, ELENA WALCH 91/100\n\n5th generation; Elena is a former architect; schiava aka trollinger, vernatsch. Appropriate medium carmine color. Exceptionally lean and racy in cool 2021. There's a certain tenderness to the palate. It's not as tart as the nose suggests. Europhile alert! 91/100. I nailed it. The Europhiles went head over heels for this.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1675. 21 ALTO ADIGE SCHIAVA, ABBAZIA DI NOVACELLA 92/100\n\nAka trollinger, vernatch; 2nd oldest winery in Italy; from the Cornaiano zone; unoaked. This is the real deal. You don't get much more fruit richness from schiava than this. Yeah, nose features black fruit, palate red. Racy schiava acidity for food. This is going to be really rangy at the table, adroitly taking on a wide variety of veal classics. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1676. 20 ALTO ADIGE EISACKTAL SAUVIGNON, CANTINA VALLE ISARCO 92/100\n\nEst. 1961; the region's youngest winegrowing cooperative; northernmost if Italy's vineyards; no malo. That's racy, citrus and tropics sauvignon with high altitude vigor. Totally fresh approaching age two. Focused and flavorful confirmation of the aromas. A little 2020 plumpness to the texture, yet the acidity won't be denied. The group's favorite of the three sauvignons tasted. Orders taken. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1677. 22 ALTO ADIGE SAUVIGNON WINKL, CANTINA TERLANO (92/100)\n\nWine Spectator 92: 'A mouthwatering white, with vivacious acidity buoying flavors of pineapple, pink grapefruit granita and hints of fresh tarragon, fleur de sel and almond blossoms.

Aromas of earth, green herbs, coffee, and chocolate begin a complex journey for a wine that certainly overdelivers, as jasmine and lilacs intersect with dark cherry and minerality cuts a path through bold notes of black olive and balsamic. An uprising of acidity makes the youthful profile even fresher.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1707. 18 VALPOLICELLA CLASSICO LUCCHINE, TEDESCHI 92/100\n\nLucchine = vineyard name; 25% Corvina, 25% Corvinone, 30% Rondinella, 10% Molinara, 10% Rossignola, Negrara, Dindarella. This Valpol doesn't back down. The black fruit aromas are strong and forthcoming as is the 2018 vintage's nature. While retaining the proper level of moderation. Plenty of richness, body, and flavor for a Valpol without dried fruit added. Yet these don't exceed my norms for classic, old time Valpolicella. With juicy acidity. Thoroughly satisfying, and versatile at the table. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1708. 15 VALPOLICELLA SUPERIORE MONTE TOMBOLE, AZ. AGR.

The sweet fruit of 2015 and the largesse of Erbice's take on Valpolicella. It's midway between classic Valpolicella and ripasso. The group was impressed. 91+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1709. 19 VALPOLICELLA CLASSICO SUPERIORE RIPASSO LA CENGIA, AZ. AGR. LORENZO BEGALI 92/100\n\nEst. 1986; vineyards near Lake Garda; 65% corvina, 30% rondinella, 5% molinara. Wow, that's a naturally sweet, lightly raisined ripasso. No quickie made appassimento. Very satisfying example. Palate confirms its ripasso lushness that is kept honest by its ample power, literal dryness, and good acidity. Well balanced. No tannin issues. Take it to the table with hearty fare. 92/100. Well respected by the commentators. 'Big and heavy, flavorful, and long.'

A tang of citrusy acidity keeps this fresh through to the chewy finish. Drink now through 2025. $28.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $27.99 each PSI-1713. 20 VALPOLICELLA CLASSICO SUPERIORE RIPASSO, CORTE ARMANO 92+/100\n\n70% corvina, 30% rondinella; in February following the harvest, pomace from the amarone fermentation is added; aged a year in large oak barrels thereafter.

This is real ripasso. Power, presence, and dried fruit impact. Dark as its name. Yes, balance of sweetness and force. The oak is an important player too. Big time, mouthfilling ripasso player with a lasting aftertaste. Writes the book on ripasso. For full fare, or the cellar. Popular with the group. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1715. 21 VALPOLICELLA CLASSICO SUPERIORE RIPASSO CAMPOLIETI, LUIGI RIGHETTI 91+/100\n\nEst. 1909; 70% corvina, 30% rondinella; in Feb. after the harvest, pomace from the amarone fermentation is added; aged a year in large oak barrels thereafter. With fruity concessions to modernity, there's a lot of classic ripasso expressed in the nose. A good dose of dried berries. Sweet on the palate, especially for a cool year. Less about raisin and more about sweet fruit to taste. Still, it's no quickie appassimento take. A very satisfying vintage of this. 91+/100. Attendees agreed. Positive oak aspects came with aeration, including pipe tobacco and cedar.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1716. 19 VALPOLICELLA RIPASSO SUPERIORE MONTI GARBI TENUTA SANT' ANTONIO, FAMIGLIA CASTAGNEDI 93+/100\n\n14%; corvina and corvinone 70%, rondinella 20%; croatina and oseleta 10%; 20 year old vines; aged a year in foudres, 30% new 70% once used. That's real ripasso, not some appassimento knockoff. And this is about the oakiest ripasso of all. Like it or not, it's not shy on the barrel input. I happen to like it. Yes, for my tastes the oak flavors, textures, and tannins add to (and counter) the dried fruit essences. Great adventure here, and potential. 93+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $23.99 each PSI-1717. 16 VALPOLICELLA SUPERIORE CAPITEL SAN ROCCO RIPASSO, TEDESCHI (90/100)\n\nParker 90+: 'The 2016 Valpolicella Superiore Ripasso Capitel San Rocco shows great dark fruit intensity, spread over a rich mid-weight style. I found the breezes of rosemary essence and eucalyptus oil to be very distinctive and nice. It's the perfect choice for roasted lamb with garlic and rosemary potatoes, and it's a great value too, thanks to the 100,000 bottles made. This wine was first produced in 1976, and the Tedeschi family was among the first to use the Ripasso method in Valpolicella in its commercial winemaking. Drink now-2023.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $25.99 each PSI-1718. 16 AMARONE, ANTICHE TERRE VENETE (91/100)\n\nWine Spectator 91: 'A rich red, with creamy tannins and juicy acidity, showing an expressive range of fig cake, sun-dried black cherry, coffee liqueur, dried thyme and smoke flavors. A balanced crowd-pleaser. Drink now through 2027.

Sweet, and full of dried fruit aromas. While a fully raisined, traditional amarone, this has a certain stylishness I associate with this cuvee. The tannin is coated by dried fruit sweetness, so it doesn't make harsh drinking at present. Still, there's a lot of bottle bouquet waiting to be earned. 92+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $57.95 each PSI-1720. 13 AMARONE RISERVA, SOC. AGR. MUSELLA magnum (92/100)\n\nWine & Spirits 92: 'This Amarone shows a bright core of sour-cherry flavor that expands to notes of apple skin, orange peel and gingery spice.

Well, that's a sweet and husky amarone experience. Tedeschi keeps a lot to tradition yet manages to stress ripe fruit over raisin and equilibrium over raw power. A real sweetie, with power and tannin to keep it on track. What a beautifully proportioned amarone presentation! 96+/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $59.95 each PSI-1724. 18 AMARONE DELLA VALPOLICELLA, CONSORZIO TUTELA 90/100\n\nGrapes dried 100-120 days; aged two years in barrels.

A relative light weight in the amarone field and priced accordingly. 90/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $31.99 each PSI-1725. 20 VENETO CHARDONNAY, ITALO CESCON 91/100\n\nThat's good, unwooded, cool climate chardonnay.

Surely one of the most forward and expressive vintages of this popular series. Varietal aromatics in spades, including pear, sage and linden. Equally as generous in flavor. Ideal sweet/acid balance. Lengthy aftertaste. Heart throb. I foresee case sales. 92/100. Attendees agreed with my analysis. Case orders taken.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1728. 21 SOAVE CLASSICO, REMO FARINA 91/100\n\nWell, this talks the Classico and the garganega talk. Full. Truly 'suave'.

Aroma not as intense as in some less productive vintages. The acid is up to snuff though, which can't be said about a lot of 2022s. And it fills the mouth in the end. Consistent winner. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1730. 22 SOAVE RONCA-MONTE CALVARINA I PRANDI, ENRICO MARCATO 91/100\n\nA cru on volcanic soil; 90% garganega, 10% trebbiano. Looks like a real cork, surprisingly long. Well, that has terroir character. Never smelled one quite like it. I understand the Soave DOCG will be balkanized. Maybe it's a good idea. There's a ring to this and more minerality than usual. Nice to see so many faces of Soave out there. There was only bland Soave Bolla when I started 60 years ago. The acid is adequate for the vintage. Flavor and balance satisfactory. Great price. 91/100. Very well liked for its unique minerality, and, its price!\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1731. 21 SOAVE, AZ. AGR. TAMELLINI 92/100 *\n\nAll garganega grown on south facing slopes. Well, that's certainly a wide spread of desirable garganega aromatics. Both racy 2021 acidity and delectable core stone fruits. Just as delicious on the palate for its flavor spectrum and the wonderful harmony of acidity and fruit ripeness. This is the definition of BALANCE. Lasting finish too, from the standpoints of both flavor and texture. 92/100.

Ideal, and ready to serve. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1733. 22 FRUILI BIANCO FRICO, SCARPETTA 91/100\n\nScarpetta is a brand developed by Bobby Stuckey, MS, and former French Laundry chef Lachlan Patterson, lovers of Friuli wines. This one, of 80% chardonnay and 20% friulano, really charmed me at a trade tasting earlier this month. Perfectly harmonious varietal concept. Full of personality. Its own thing. One glass invites another. Great value. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1734. 23 FRIULI SAUVIGNON VIA ALPINA, GIAMPAOLO VENICA 92+/100\n\nWow, this SIZZLES! What nostril tingle! More evidence why NE Italy's sauvignons are my favorites. A little softer and sweeter on the palate. Perhaps some baby fat. Adequate acid for balance. Well priced. 92+/100. Tasted 5/24.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1735. 22 FRIULI PINOT GRIGIO, BORGHI AD EST 91/100\n\nFull and satisfying grigio body. In the mouth, acid, body, balance. Good price. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1736. 23 FRIULI PINOT GRIGIO VIA ALPINA, GIAMPAOLO VENICA 91/100\n\n2022: Mainly from Colli Orientali. Friuli grigio body and light apple-wax-nut varietal character. Bursts open in the mouth. More body, more flavor, more grigio peels extracts. Fine acid, balance, texture. We've got ourselves a bargain here. 91/100. Attendee descriptors and compliments pretty much parallel mine. Continued to improve with aeration into the following day.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1737. 22 FRIULI PINOT GRIGIO, PRINCIPE DEI CONTI 91/100\n\nLarge and generous and spot on. Full in the mouth too. Just right for its genre and price. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1738. 21 FRIULI PINOT GRIGIO, PRINCIPE DEI CONTI 91/100\n\n2020: Grigio full and accurate. Good value. Confirmed. A grigio with satisfying varietal character and body. 91/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $11.99 each PSI-1739. 22 VENEZIA GIULIA SAUVIGNON BLANC, DI LENARDO 91/100\n\nEst. 1878; estate bottled. This has sauvignon gooseberry and grass aromatic, but subtly so, not in your face. It's always that way. I love it. Good acid to balance the 2022 relative plushness. Ultimately, totally harmonious and ready for the table, where it will prove more versatile than those gregarious NZ takes. 91/100. 'Gun flint' noted. Attendees appreciated its lack of aggressiveness. 'Very long and very easy to enjoy.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1740. 21 FRIULI GRAVE SAUVIGNON BLANC PRODIGO, BOTTER 92/100\n\nVineyards around Udine and Pordenone, close to the Adriatic. OMG! Even more pungent and penetrating than the 19 and 20. 2021 cut to the max. Gooseberry to the fore. Oft related but seldom dominating. Palate confirms. The cool vintage really brings out the gooseberry. One of the world's best sauvignon values. 92/100. Almost too much of a good thing, according to the commentators. I counter 'It hurts so good!'.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $12.99 each PSI-1741. 21 FRIULI GRAVE SAUVIGNON TRALCETTO, ITALO CESCON 92/100\n\nBrisk, cool, crackling Friuli sauvignon. Grapefruit and thyme. Grapefruit flavor. Great acidity. Long aftertaste. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $18.99 each PSI-1742. 22 COLLIO SAUVIGNON, GRADIS'CIUTTA 92/100\n\nClear sauvignon citrus and soft tropical fruits character. Perfectly bright and fresh still. Great flavor intensity, a little burnished with bottle age. Great acidity. Really quite full bodied. That's Collio. Lovely now. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $21.99 each PSI-1743. EMILIA LAMBRUSCO MONTELOCCO, VENTURINI BALDINI 92/100\n\nAll salamino. Dark color. Sweet and spot on. Tangy fizz and acidity. Black and purple berries. Equally bountiful berry flavors. Exactly what I'm looking for in a semi-sweet lambrusco. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $16.99 each PSI-1744. 21 LAMBRUSCO GRASPAROSSA CASTELVETRO BECCO ROSSO, PODERI FIORINI 92/100\n\nBright, dark, cheery red violet. Sweet raspberry and some peppery seeds. Spot on. Deliciously sweet, well foiled by 21 acidity. If the gas were still present, that would buffer the sweetness further. Exemplary, and..well priced. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $15.99 each PSI-1745. 20 LAMBRUSCO REGGIANO QUERCIOLI SECCO, MEDICI ERMETE 92/100\n\nFull color. Light frizzante sparkle. High aromatic intensity pushed forth by its mousse. Buoyant and rich raspberry aroma. Racy. Full fruit and flower. Brisk tartness. Yow! The real deal. 92/100.\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1746. 22 LAMBRUSCO DELL' EMILIA LE SOLCO, PALTRINIERI (93/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 93: 'The color of this wine is a stunning deep-red verging on purple. The aromas are full of ripe plums and black cherries. This juicy fruit is in balance with the more gamy, earthy and herbal notes that appear on the midpalate. Lush but balanced, it delivers a fresh pop of acidity on the finish to make the second glass as easy as the first.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $14.99 each PSI-1747. 20 LAMBRUSCO DI SORBARA LECLISSE, PALTRINIERI (95/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 95 - EDITORS' CHOICE: 'Radiant and bone-dry, this lovely, gently sparkling wine has delicate scents of red berry and white spring flower. Savory and vibrant, the elegant palate features crushed strawberry, pomegranate and hints of vanilla framed in an extremely refined perlage. Crisp acidity keeps it lively and focused.'\n\nHow Many bottles/singles: $19.99 each PSI-1748. 21 LAMBRUSCO DI SORBARA RADICE, PALTRINIERI (96/100)\n\nWine Enthusiast 96 - EDITORS' CHOICE: 'Sho"
