        "text": "General Information & Marina Services\n\nThe port is made up of a natural bay defended by two breakwaters: the S. Lucia Quay and the Sant'Antonio Quay, the former has docks and is provided with mooring bollards and rings. The San Nicola Breakwater, to the north, reduces the silting up to which the port is subject to, which can reach up to 50 cm a year. All the internal docks have quays: the wharf of the Santa Lucia Quay, 48 m. long, with an upper surface area of about 1,400 sq. m is equipped to haul small craft with a maximum displacement of 500 t. and does not provide for cargo storage. The adjacent stretch of the Santa Teresa dock, 215 m long, is equipped for hauling fishing craft; the Seminario dock and part of the La Conca dock, 109 m. long, are reserved to the fishing fleet; the Piazza Quercia and Piazza Tiepolo docks, 450 m long, are reserved to pleasure craft. In this area there are floating jetties, for a total of 618 m, which allow the mooring of pleasure craft with an outboard length of up to 25 m, for a total of 600 crafts. A part of the said jetties is reserved to members of the local Section of the L.N.I.; the others are managed directly by the Town Council (municipal Dock) and are accessible free. The Regulations of use and the tariff schedule are approved by the Town Council. All places for boats, permanently moored or in transit, benefit from drinking water, electric points, continuous assistance and supervision. Finally, on the Sant'Antonio Quay, 60 m. from the end, to the left entering, there is the lighthouse: 5 sec. white light; 20 m. from the end is a fixed red light; on the San Nicola breakwater on the head, north side entering: a fixed green light. Craft entering and leaving must keep 40 m. leeway from the said green light."
