        "text": "Italy, famed for its dramatic coastlines and world-class cuisines, you are sure to have an indulgent vacation when chartering in one of the most food orientated countries in the world! After all, holidays are about food too! Whether on a cliff face restaurant, or nosing around the food markets, Italy can be enjoyed from the water as it can on land.\n\nWinds\n\nThere are 5 types of regular winds that affect Italy throughout the year. Mistral, Tramontane, Scirocco, Libeccio, and the Bora. However, between these all, it is the Mistral wind that you have to be most aware of, along with the Tramontane which blows further west. These winds happen throughout the year. From cold northerly winds to warm, humid southerly that blow in the Sahara sand, Italy experiences it all.\n\nMistral\n\nThe Mistral and the Tramontane winds run almost parallel to each other, however, the Mistral travels down between the famous Rhone Valley, squeezing between the Alps and Massif Central where it gains speed and eventually hits the northwestern side of Corsica and Sardinia. The winds are strong and cold, normally these winds are in the region of a Force 7-9 and shockingly it has been known for wind gusts to reach a mind-blowing 155mph (185kph) although this is rare.\n\nThese winds should be at the forefront of all sailors/charterers when planning a charter in the Sardinian/Corsica region. The Mistral winds tend to be more prevalent in the winter and spring, however, the Mistral phenomena can occur at any time of the year. Areas like La Madelena on the northern tip of Sardinia are particularly exposed by the northwesterly winds. These winds tend to last more than one day and can sometimes last a week.\n\nTramontane\n\nThe winds are most noticeable on the west coast of Italy and Northern Corsica. The Tramontane winds funnel down the mountain rangers and increases in speed as it passes between the Pyrenees and the Massif Central. It is caused by a high pressure on the north of France that subsequently pushes air in a southeasterly direction across the Meditteranean. It is strongest before sunrise when it can reach speeds of 70 km/h (45 mph) - don't use it as an excuse to spend a few more minutes in bed! These winds do not tend to affect charters, but always good to bear in mind if you want to start early.\n\nScirocco\n\nScirocco (or Jugo winds) are characterized as a humid southeasterly or westerly that travels north from the coast of Africa...taking half the Sahara sands with it! This starts off as a dry warm wind and then condenses as it travels up towards the Mediterranean. Sirocco winds tend to occur throughout the year, in the rare event that these winds pick up to a gale it would predominantly be in the Springtime.\n\nTips\n\n- Check the forecast the evening before and the morning before you depart\n\n- Check for alternative anchorages on the eastern side of the islands if the Mistral picks up.\n\n- Be prepared to moor for a couple of days in one spot if the winds are forecasted for a prolonged amount of time\n\n- Have a backup itinerary\n\nItinerary\n\n- Ponza and the Amalfi Coast Motor yacht itinerary\n\n- Amalfi Catamaran sailing itinerary\n\n- Sardinia Motor yacht itinerary\n\n- Sardinia bareboat itinerary\n\nEnquire\n\nCroatia\n\nBora is a bitterly cold, dry north-easterly katabatic wind that can make the sunniest day seem like the middle of winter. The wind is most noticeable in the Velebit Channel and the Kvarner Bay. This wind can dramatically cool down the yacht, (especially in the forepeak cabins where there's not much insolation, worth remembering if you have hired a skipper for the low season!).\n\nThe Bora wind is particularly gusty, so be ready on the main if you feel a strong gust coming! Although the Bora winds can be felt throughout the year, it's during the winter months where it becomes more apparent. When the Boatbookinsg team chartered a BALI 4.5 starting from Kastela, at the beginning of October 2019, they experienced the Bora winds - so keep a close eye!\n\nJugo\n\nJugo is a southerly moist wind, that travels over the islands and onto the shore. Jugo can appear in all seasons, however, the North of the Adriatic is mostly affected by this wind in the springtime, and the southern Adriatic in the autumn time. Jugo has more of a presence as this wind tends to blow from the southeasterly direction hitting the southern parts of Croatia first.\n\nWhen Jugo is blowing, the pressure will drop, warmth and high humidity. Inevitably, clouds and rain will follow, along with thunderstorms. Unlike the Bura wind, Jugo is a uniformed, predictable wind (Bura is gusty) meaning it is actually quite pleasant to sail in....while the Jugo is 'young'. It can take up to three-four days before you can really feel the power of this wind.\n\nTips\n\n- Apri - June and September - October offer mild weather and calm seas.\n\n- July and August, perfect for swimming but very, very busy.\n\n- If chartering in high season, reserve your buoy/slip at least three days before!\n\n-\n\nItineraries\n\nCaribbean\n\nBest times to charter: December - the beginning of May.\n\nThe Caribbean, characterized by its laid back lifestyle and crystalline waters, the Caribbean offers memorable charters around the unique relaxed islands. The shallow waters, illuminated by the bright white sands create seas of colour so intensely turquoise that you just cannot help but jump in!\n\nClimate\n\nThe Caribbean temperatures are always fairly moderate between 29°C to 31°C with very little seasonal variation year-round which is great when booking your charter. The Caribbean rarely gets 'too hot' due to the northeasterly trade winds that happen year-round. With the winds interfering with the sun's rays, the Windward Islands weather will always feel milder than the Leewards. Due to the trade winds, the northeastern edges on most of the islands will feel cooler than on the southwestern corners.\n\nScroll down for Hurricane information\n\nBahamas\n\nBest times to charter: December - May.\n\nHome to some of the most incredible sandy cays and natural beauty this world had to offer. This is a sailor's paradise when it comes to sailing and exploring. Not only can you enjoy the geography, but also wildlife. Swimming with nurse sharks, spying on the aloof iguanas or feeding the swimming pigs, this area as an abundance of wildlife for you to observe.\n\nClimate\n\nGeographically speaking, the main differences between the Caribbean and the Bahamas is that the majority of the Bahamian islands are in the Atlantic sea while the Caribbean islands are, of course, in the Caribbean Sea. Climate is similar, but due to the geographic location of the Bahamas, the winters are milder compared to the Caribbean. Just like the Caribbean, the trade winds tend to keep the Bahamas fairly cool reaching 33°C but rarely falling under 18°C.\n\nTips\n\n- Do not charter in hurricane season\n\n- Be careful on your depth\n\n- Storms can come on as quickly as they can dissipate, check the forecast!\n\nEnquire\n\nHurricane season\n\nHurricane season\n\nHurricane season spikes from June to mid-October worldwide, but the seasonal change can be noticeable from May through to December. Hurricanes and tropical storms are created by warm water and humid air. The faster the water evaporates the more swell is created, which forms large tropical waves that can devastate sea-level or low lying land. Unfortunately due to the Geography of islands in the Bahamas, the Caribbean and some parts of Asia, flooding and hurricanes are susceptible to these particular areas.\n\nHurricanes need warm water to survive, which is why they normally disintegrate once they hit large landmasses. Due to the size of the islands in most hurricane-prone areas, they are not large enough to defuse a hurricane, depending on, of course, the size of the hurricane. Thankfully it is very rare for a hurricane to destroy an entire area, so even after a hurricane has hit, you can probably still visit elsewhere in the area.\n\nThe Bahamas and Caribbean Hurricane season\n\nHurricane season is at its strongest during the June > October time, understandably, at these times the islands are at their quietest. Here at Boatbookings, we would never recommend chartering during these months, it's simply not worth it. You might as well go, and have a relaxing stress free vacation, after all that is what sailing is all about! Our advice is to not be worried about chartering in hurricane/tropical storm-prone areas.\n\nIt is rare that your charter will be canceled, yacht bases always have an eye on the weather and normally move the whole fleet to a safe haven. The great thing is, the surrounding areas in the Caribbean and Bahamas are so stunningly beautiful you cannot be disappointed with a different starting location!\n\nHurricane Dorian, below, is the most recent Hurricane to make landfall. Dorian hovered over the Abacos, destroying almost everything beneath her. Due to her path, and the low and high pressures that stalled the hurricane, she thankfully didn't move south which would have completely battered Nassau and the Exumas. This is a prime example of a Category 5 hurricane destroying only one area - leaving the rest of the Bahamas and Caribbean untouched and still available for sailors and holiday markets to plan their vacations.\n\nAlthough hurricanes making landfall, or coming close to the islands to affect them is rare, many tourists and sailors alike are paranoid about being caught up in a hurricane or having a holiday canceled because of one. Famous hurricanes like Irma, Katrina, and Wilma are embedded in the minds of most people born in the early '90s, but what people forget is that these countries are able to bounce back, but only with the help of donations and above all, tourism.\n\nThe best form of Aid that everyone can give is booking their winter holiday in either the Caribbean or the Bahamas.\n\nAsia and the Pacific\n\nBest times to charter: December - May\n\nThere are three main seasons in Asia and southwest Asia, the cool season, hot season, and rainy season. Often translated to the hot season (December / May), the really hot season (May / August), and the really really hot and wet season (September and October)! Typically around Thailand/Phuket regions, the climate is considered a tropical monsoon climate, thus meaning it is warm all year around.\n\nMonsoon Winds\n\nThe Monsson Winds, often referred to as the South West Monsoon blows warm, equatorial weather and warm water from the south and deposits over most of Asia. The Southwest monsoon begins in May and June with the peak being in August and October.\n\nCountries close to the equator such as Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Philippines, and Singapore have an equatorial climate which means the seasons remain warm and wet, and rarely have variation between the months. The Monsoon winds hit some of the most loved attractions in Asia such as Phuket. In the Koh Chang region especially, dangerous rip currents happen during the rainy season.\n\nWhy are clouds important for sailors?\n\nClouds and understanding cloud formations are essential to sailors' knowledge. They can indicate oncoming weather, flukey winds or whether you're in for a peaceful lovely evening! There are four main cloud formations, but many variations that sailors need to watch out for!\n\n- Cumulus clouds - puffy, sometimes flat-based clouds.\n\n- Stratus clouds - low level horizontal 'blanket' looking clouds.\n\n- Cirrus clouds - thin wispy high altitude clouds.\n\n- Nimbus clouds - dark in colour and will bring rain.\n\nCirrus clouds (mares tails)\n\nCirrus clouds are high altitude clouds that lay between 16,500 ft and 45,000 ft. They are short, whispy looking clouds that derive from the Latin word for curly locks. Though these clouds aren't initially a potential threat, they can indicate a wet warm front. Take note of their speed and direction, if the clouds are traveling in an easterly direction fair weather is on its way. If not, you could be in for some rain and stuff winds until the front passes.\n\nCirrocumulus Clouds\n\nCirrocumulus clouds are also high altitude clouds, formed at a similar height as Mares tails. Cirrocumulus clouds often appear in fair, but cold weather. There is an old nautical proverb \"Mackeral Sky and Mares tails make tall ships carry low sails.\" Both Mares tails and Cirrocumulus can be the start of a warm front and thus bringing some unpredictable stormy weather. Best keep an eye on the speed and direction of these beautiful formations.\n\nCirrostratus"
