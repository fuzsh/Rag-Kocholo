        "text": "We present the results of a two year field survey on the herpetofauna of the Poggi di Prata area in Central Italy. A total of 2,653 records were made on nine Amphibian and sixteen Reptile species. Eleven species had not been recorded before. Bombina pachypus has not been observed since 2004 and represents a conservation concern. Among the main threats to the local herpetofauna, we consider the filling-in of the ponds, the abandonment of the traditional agricultural practices, road kills, killings of snakes by lay people, fish introductions and, possibly, climate change.\n\nThis paper represents an update of the list of Italian amphibians and reptiles published 15 years ago by Razzetti et al. (2006) and of the checklist published in 1993 by the late Benedetto Lanza. At present, the Italian herpetofauna includes 101 species (41 amphibians and 60 reptiles) and an amphibian taxon of hybrid origin. Seven species and one subspecies are allochthonous and became naturalized within the last century. Since the last published list, a new species has been described (Vipera walser), five taxa have been raised to species rank (Salamandrina perspicillata, Speleomantes sarrabusensis, Zootoca carniolica, Malpolon insignitus and Natrix helvetica) while three taxa have been downgraded to subspecies. All the relevant taxonomic changes based upon new research have been discussed, including tentative revisions and controversial taxa. Nine species reported or listed dubitatively in Lanza’s 1993 list are excluded here.\n\nThe data presented here come from surveys carried out thanks to a PIM (Initiative PIM-Initiative pour les Petites Îles de Méditerranée) mission on the satellite islands, islets and rocks of Elba and Pianosa islands, aimed at improving knowledge of the terrestrial natural heritage of the Tuscan Archipelago. A list of islands, islets and rocks with resident reptiles is provided.\n\nThe Monte Albo (Sardinia, Italy) is a biodiversity hotspot that hosts several species of amphibians and reptiles, some of which are endemic. In the present work, we provide an updated list of the herpetofauna of this important area thanks to surveys carried out 2012 – 2016. We observed 18 species, 17 had already been reported in literature but one of these was not detected during our surveys, while Testudo marginata and Natrix natrix cetti, are here reported for the first time for the Monte Albo.\n\nNatural history museums are irreplaceable tools to study and preserve the biological diversity around the globe and among the primary actors in the recognition of species and the logical repositories for their type specimens. In this paper we surveyed the consistency of the preserved specimens of amphibians and reptiles housed in the major Italian scientific collections, and verified the presence of threatened species according to the IUCN Red List, including the Extinct (EX), Extinct in the Wild (EW), Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), and Vulnerable (VU) categories. Altogether, we analyzed 39 Italian zoological collections. We confirmed the presence of one extinct reptile (Chioninia coctei) and five extinct or extinct in the wild amphibian species (Atelopus longirostris, Nectophrynoides asperginis, Pseudophilautus leucorhinus, P. nasutus, and P. variabilis). Seven CR amphibians, fourteen CR reptile species and the extinct skink C. coctei are shared by more than one insti..."
