Bari and its province developed thanks to the resources coming from the Adriatic sea, through trade and the relations to the Eastern Mediterranean, and from the hills characterising the karst territory thanks to agriculture and cattle breeding. The territory still maintains the signs of the activities of human beings and time: in the whole plateau, not exceeding 700 metres of altitude, kilometres of dry walls mark the boundaries of private estates interspersed with trulli, wonderful Romanesque cathedrals which have reached their highest development here, and the beautiful castles, in particular those of the time of Frederick II. Mention must be made of the National Park of Alta Murgia.\n\nThe chief town of the Region is between the provinces of Foggia and Brindisi. The plains stretch almost entirely along the coast and only briefly touch upon the Murgia Barese. The town is in the shape of a bird with open wings, whose head forms the nucleus of Bari Vecchia, the old town. Bari was annexed to the Roman Empire in the third century before Christ and over the ages was an Arab Emirate conquered by Longobards, Byzantines and Saracens. Once the base of the Roman Empire’s fleet for the Orient, the urban structure of the old town is arranged around the Catapan court. After the remains of Saint Nicholas were stolen and the homonymous Basilica was built, Bari became a major centre of Christianity and a convenient place the Crusades could leave from and return to from the Orient.\n\nRuled by Normans, Angevins, Aragon and the Spanish, the town first expanded outside of the old one in 1813 when work started on the new town.\n\nWhat to see in Bari\n\nImportant monuments in town include the Basilica of San Nicola, housing the remains of the patron saint, the Romanesque Basilica of San Gregorio, the Cathedral of San Sabino, and Bari’sNorman-Swabian Castle, built on the orders of Frederick II for purposes of defense. Places not to be missed in the old part of town are the Piazza Mercantile and the Colonna infame, once used as a pillory for insolvent debtors. More modern buildings also worth a visit are Teatro Petruzzelli, Teatro Margherita, Palazzo Fizzarotti, and the library of Santa Teresa dei Maschi. There are also many churches on the reefs and hypogeums cut out of the rock and subsoil.\n\nThese include the church on the reefs of Saint Candida, the temple of Saint George, and the hypogeum of Madio Diana, the “Jewish” hypogeum. Museums worth a visit: the Archaeology Museum, the Provincial Picture Gallery, the Civic History Museum, and the Botanical Gardens Institute. Important events include the festivities of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of the town, between the 7th and 9th of May, and the exhibitions at the Levante Fair in the building constructed in the 1930s.\n\nWorth visiting sites\n\nBasilica of St Nicholas\n\nCattedrale di San Sabino di Bari\n\nFestival of San Nicola\n\nNorman-Swabian Castle of Bari\n\nPiccinni Theater\n\nPlaster Museum of Norman-Swabian Castle\n\nProvince Picture Gallery\n\nSt. Nicholas Basilica Museum - Bari\n\nChiesa di San Domenico\n\nAfrica-Mozambique Ethnographic Museum\n\n* Port Authority Telephone\n\n0039 080 524 4488"
