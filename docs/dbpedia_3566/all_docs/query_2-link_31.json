        "text": "Dr. Konstantin Frank wines a star in New York\n\nAugust 19, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWhen it comes to the United States, California is the grape-volume superstar. Well over 90 percent of all wine grapes are grown in California with Washington State pulling less than 5 percent. Did you know that New York State is number three, not far off the pace set by Washington?\n\nOnly about 10 percent of New York wine grapes produced are from vinifera grapes, such as chardonnay, merlot and riesling. The two dominant growing areas are Finger Lakes and Long Island.\n\nThe temperatures of these areas are moderated by bodies of water that help make frigid winters survivable for grapes. The Finger lakes were formed by glaciers gouging large holes in the bedrock, and Long Island is a moraine where the glacier stopped moving and dumped a mass of soil, gravel and rocks.\n\nArguably, the Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery is the leader in this region. Specializing only in vinifera grapes, the Frank winery offers some of the best wine produced in the Finger Lakes.\n\nDr. Konstantin Frank Winery was founded in 1958 by Dr. Frank who had studied the cold climate impact on vinifera grapes in what is now Ukraine. He died in 1985 and currently his great granddaughter manages the New York winery.\n\nWe recently tasted a selection of impressive, well-priced white wines from the winery. Following are our thoughts:\n\nDr. Konstantin Frank Brut Method Champenoise Finger Lakes Sparkling Wine N/V ($30). A classic blend of all of the traditional champagne grapes, with roughly equal parts chardonnay and pinot noir and a dollop of pinot meunier. Made in the same manner as French champagne, this sparkling wine offers a classic yeasty nose with bold flavors of apple, baked bread and citrus. A terrific effort for a domestic sparkler.\n\nDr. Konstantin Frank Gruner Veltliner Finger Lakes 2023 ($19). This grape originally hales from Austria where it dominates white wine production. This New York take displays bright lively fresh herbs, citrus and a hint of apricot notes. Very refreshing.\n\nDr. Konstantin Frank Dry Riesling Finger Lakes 2023 ($19). Hint of petrol in nose and mouth with lively acidity and citrus and apricot notes. We also tasted a 2020 vintage of this wine. The 2020 was much more expressive than the 2023 with a more obvious petrol nose and a rich, mouth-filling fruitiness with apricot and a delightful underlying stoniness. The moral of this story is to buy the current vintage and sit on it for a least 3-4 years.\n\nLombardy\n\nLombardy is not frequently referenced in writings or discussions of fine wines. Located in Northern Italy hard to the Swiss border, it is flanked by Trentino Alto-Adige to the east and Piedmont to the west. It is better known as home to Milan and its stunningly beautiful lakes and mountains. Yet true to Italian culture, Lombardy produces some very good wines especially from cool-climate grapes, albeit not in large quantities.\n\nOne of Lombardy’s best known and respected wines is a sparkler, Franciacorta, and is produced in both white and rosé versions. The white version is allowed to have 85 percent chardonnay, 15 percent pinot nero (noir), and 5 percent pinot bianco (blanc). The rosé version is more flexible, with 4 permitted grape varieties that emphasize pinot noir and chardonnay. The sparkling wine is fashioned “method classico,” the same process that the French use to create champagne.\n\nWe recently tasted two samples of Franciacorta from the respected firm Berlucci. Both of these sparklers were very pleasant and worth the tariff.\n\nThe Berlucci Franciacorta Extra Brut Session “61” ($35-45) is very impressive and very champagne like. Crisp with apple citrus notes and a pleasant yeastiness. Very refreshing.\n\nThe Berlucci Franciacorta Rosé Session “61” ($45-55) is a little richer and full bodied than the white, and not as dry. The rosé is more of a red fruit experience with a bit of baked apple in the finish.\n\nGeorgia\n\nThe red saperavi grape is the rockstar of the country of Georgia. Saperavi is the most planted red grape in Georgia and tend to show up in their most prized wines. They are deep, rich and highly colored – a factor of red, pulpy juice (teinturier) unlike most red grapes that when crushed ooze white pulp and juice.\n\nWe recently tasted three red wines from Georgia featuring the saperavi grape. We were thoroughly impressed with their overall quality and relatively affordable prices. Following are our impressions:\n\nTeliani Valley Glekhuri Saperavi Qvevri Kakheti Georgia 2021 ($32). This is a single vineyard bottling. Their regular offering is pretty close in quality and comes in around $20. Fermented and aged in amphora-like qvevri, this wine presented big structure with soft tannins. Plum and cherry notes with a cranberry streak and a hint of minerality drove the sensory experience.\n\nShilda Rustaveli Khakheti Saperavi Qvevri Old Vines Georgia 2022 ($25). Another excellent saperavi aged in qvevri. Cherry berry notes with a slight hint of stones or minerals. Soft tannins.\n\nDugladze Saperavi Khakheti Mukuzani 2020 ($15-20). The grapes were sourced from Mukuzani, a special sub-region of Khakheti. Unlike the two previous saperavis, this example was aged in French oak barrels and displayed a slight oak note. Bright berry notes in a very pleasant and easy to drink format. Very deep and rich fruit, it was our favorite of the trio.\n\nWine picks\n\nDough Wines Central Coast Pinot Noir 2022 ($22). This is one of the best values in the expensive pinot noir category. Lots of youthful strawberry and black cherry flavors with a supple mouthfeel.\n\nCV Studium Red Blend Paso Robles 2020. ($70). Latin for “house of learning,” the Studium is a Bordeaux-like blend from vineyards in Paso Robles that has been offering grapes to other producers for decades. Continental Vineyards are now making a series of red wines under its own label, including this proprietary, fruit-forward blend with youthful plum and black cherry flavors.\n\nTrue Myth Edna Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($18). Ripe pear and tropical fruit notes with a hint of vanilla and prominent oak notes.\n\nFranciscan Estate California Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($13). Stone fruit and citrus make this a pleasing wine to sip or serve along a fresh vegetable or fruit tray.\n\nDonum’s great pinot noirs\n\nAugust 12, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nDan Fishman waxes pride in talking about the care that goes into making pinot noir from the occasionally maligned Sonoma County. As vice-president of vineyards and winery for Donum, he has the freedom to make special pinot noir that is laser-focused on a specific site that ranges from Carneros to the Russian River Valley with a litter Anderson Valley.\n\nThe pinot noirs we tasted from this elite producer are unquestionably extraordinary and different in their own ways, but the attention that goes into the vineyard and winemaking comes at a price.\n\n“Pinot noir doesn’t scale very well,” he said.\n\nUnlike cabernet sauvignon vineyards that can yield twice the volume of grapes without a reduction in quality, pinot noir vineyards do best when the yield is low. The grape is also more susceptible to mildew, which affects a lot of producers who do not pay attention to the quality of the soil. Better soil produces more healthy vines to fight off mildew.\n\nIn a recent Zoom tasting, Fishman separated commercial pinot noir made in large quantities from his small productions where quality to more important. Commerical producers will avoid expensive oak barrels and will randomly strip the vines of every grape. Flaws are covered by adding sugar. At Donum, Fishman is more selective in choosing evenly ripened grapes. He is cognizant of how a vineyard faces the sun and how the soil impacts the flavor profile. He is willing to graft different clones if something isn’t working. And, perhaps most importantly, he invests in organic farming with sheep roaming the vineyards and reduced irrigation. Vineyard yields are kept low to produce the best grapes whereas in commercial vineyards the yield is high to produce the optimal volume of juice.\n\nThis comes at prices of about $95, which puts his wine out of reach of many consumers. Alas, pricey pinot noir is regrettably common along the West Coast. Only when you understand what goes into the bottle do you gain a perspective on cost.\n\nFishman is quick to point out that Donum has gone through a transition that is just beginning to settle. The estate site was once owned by Buena Vista, but was purchased in 2011 by Mei and Allan Warburg. Some of their imaginative artworks from artists in 18 nations are nestled in the vineyards and have become a part of the tour.\n\nFishman arrived the next year and took over the vineyards in 2019. The original idea was to make one pinot noir from lots across the estate, but he concluded that’s not how pinot noir wants to be made. Today they have five ranches from which to make numerous site-specific pinot noirs and one chardonnay.\n\nHe converted the vineyards to organic when he took the reins and it wasn’t long before he started to witness the benefits. Instead of manipulating the product at the winery, he lets the vineyards do the work. This non-intervention approach puts the responsibility in the hands of the viticulturist.\n\n“There is energy on the palate, which is only possible from vines and soil,” he said. “You can’t add quality at the winery.”\n\nHis pinot noirs have elegance, balance and restraint – his goals, he said. Alcohol levels, for instance, came down and no longer compare with the fruity, alcoholic wines popular on the market. We were impressed with the three pinot noirs that showed off unique personalities, especially the earthy and mushroom character that typifies many Sonoma pinot noirs.\n\nAlthough 90 percent of the 13,000 cases made here each year are pinot noir, chardonnay accounts for the rest – and it’s delicious because of the same attention to quality.\n\nTake a gander at these extraordinary wines:\n\nDonum Carneros Estate Pinot Noir 2022 ($95). Made on this property since 2001, the estate pinot noir is Donum’s flagship wine. The vineyard was replanted and is impacted by the wind that traverses rolling hills. Fishman identifies a root-beer and earthy character that personifies this vineyard. Spice is nice in this aromatic sensation that characterized by layers of blackberry, dark cherry and raspberry notes.\n\nDonum Three Hills Pinot Noir 2022 ($95). Lighter in style because the grapes from three areas of Carneros are harvested later in the year, the wine is round and luxurious with supple tannins and more red fruit, mineral character – strawberries and cranberries. It was first introduced in 2018.\n\nDonum TFV Pinot Noir 2022 ($95). The Thomas Ferguson Vineyard was first planted in 1974 and purchased by Donum in 2016. Obviously, the vines have been replanted since then – this is only the second harvest. Less earthy, it has juicy cherry flavors.\n\nDonum Carneros Chardonnay 2022 ($75). We loved this complex and soothing chardonnay made from a single-vineyard estate. All of it undergoes barrel fermentation, but Fishman does not stir the lees or add to the natural malolactic fermentation. Sourced from a variety of clones in its 120-acre vineyard, there is elegance and bright fruit to make it a good pairing with seafood. Citrus aromas with stone-fruit flavors and a dollop of spice. Fishman says he plans to step up the chardonnay program.\n\nWine picks\n\nTextbook Sonoma County “The Pey Family” Chardonnay 2022 ($23). This is one of the best chardonnays for the money that we have tasted in a long time. Good balance between acidity and forward fruit with a good burst of citrus and tropical fruit at mid-palate.\n\nJ. Lohr F&G Vineyard Pinot Blanc 2023 ($35). This is a refreshing break from chardonnay and goes just as well with seafood. Bright lemon and melon flavors with a hint of pear. It is entirely fermented in barrel and aged for 8 months in French oak to give it a round texture.\n\nConde Valdemar Crianza Rioja 2019 ($20). We can’t write enough about this wine. Value priced, it is loaded with fruit-forward, red cherry and blackberry flavors with hints of spice and licorice. The blend is tempranillo (82 percent), mazuelo, graciano and maturana.\n\nLook beyond chardonnay for interesting white wines\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nIn the wide world of wonderful wine drinking, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc lead the parade by far. None of the grapes reviewed in this article even make the top 20 in the world. That’s the point of this review. There is a plethora of grapes grown around the world that are just begging to be sampled if only you could know where to look. And summer is the time to look.\n\nAbout 600 different white grape varietals are grown around the world, and most consumers have only tasted a handful of them. That leaves a whole bunch (no pun intended) for wine lovers to seek.\n\nWe’ve done some of the work for you in this column, but keep in mind there are still many other white grape varieties to explore than those mentioned here. And, the good news is that many of these sometimes-obscure grape varieties are available in the U.S., albeit mostly in fine wine stores. These wines are often inexpensive and can provide an interesting and satisfying tasting experience, especially in hot weather.\n\nFinding these wines can be a hit-or-miss proposition, so seeking out an experienced wine salesman at a fine wine store can expedite your search. Tell the salesperson what you are looking for or, better, inquire as to the availability of lesser-known wines in their store. Most experienced wine salespersons have a few obscurities that they would love to share. And, if you can’t find the particular producer we mention, consider other producers using the same grape variety.\n\nA recent tasting of five lesser-known white wines inspired us to share our impressions -- 4 of the 5 were Italian and one Spanish. For some reason, our experience indicates that the Italians vinify and export more grape varieties than any other country. Following are our tasting notes:\n\nProbably the most well-known of the white wines we tasted was the Riva Leone Gavi DOCG 2021 ($15). Hailing from the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy, where red wines such as barolo, barbaresco and barbera dominate attention. We enjoyed the bargain price as well as the citrus, mineral, apple and peach notes with abundant palate-quenching acidity. A real winner for fish and chicken dishes.\n\nAttems Trebes Ribolla Gialla Collio DOC 2020 ($35) is made from an indigenous white grape from Northeastern Italy that is gaining popularity. We perceived lemon and lime notes, a hint of straw and bright acidity as hallmarks of this delicious wine.\n\nNic Tartigalia Pecorino Colline Pescaresi IGT 2020 ($15-20) is indigenous to Abruzzo. This version is another winner and worth considering. Bright full bodied candied apple with caramel and subtle floral notes. A bold, pleasing wine.\n\nFerentano Cotarella Bianco Lazio IGP 2019 ($25-30) is an interesting white wine crafted from the roscetto grape outside of Rome. Just a hint of oak pairs with plum and tropical fruit notes blend in a rich package.\n\nAlvaredos-Hobbs Godello Ribeira Sacra D.O.2020 ($35) is the result of a partnership between Paul Hobbs of California fame and Antonio Lopez Fernandez. The Galicia region of Spain is home to many wines made from the albarino grape. Ripe plum and apple notes dominate with some oak. Very rich and smooth.\n\nVale do Bomfim Douro White 2022 ($15) from Portugal is representative of the value to be found in this often-forgotten wine region. There are so many great wines for the price coming from the northern region. The grapes in this white blend include viosinho, rabigato, gouveio and arinto. You never heard of them, right? It doesn’t matter, just enjoy it. Very subtle notes of peach and pineapple with a dash of minerality. Enjoyable just to sip on the patio.\n\nAlois Legeder Porer Pinot Grigio IGT 2021 ($30) comes partially from grapes that are immediately pressed after harvest to keep the freshness. Another portion of the grapes is macerated on its skins for 15 hours. A third portion is exposed to stems and skins for a year. The result is a beautifully textured wine with enough tannin and acidity to make it a perfect match with seafood.\n\nInama Carbonare Soave Classico DOC 2021 ($30) is a fantastic soave. Made from old-vine garganega vineyards located on the slopes of a dormant volcano, the wine has citrus, white peach and apple notes with fresh acidity and a rich, lingering finish.\n\nTenuta Whitaker Mozia Grillo Sicilia DOC 2022 ($25). We like grillo as an alternative to pinot grigio and even chardonnay. It has good acidity, pure fruit character with stone fruit and apple notes accented with minerality.\n\nPinot grigos\n\nMarco Felluga Mongris Collo Pinot Grigio DOC 022 ($21). With grapes grown in mineral-rich but poor soils in the Collio region of Italy, this pinot gris has bright and fresh floral aromas with apple and pear flavors.\n\nAlois Lageder Porer Vigneti delle Dolomiti Pinot Grigio IGT 2022 ($30). With a little more complexity and richness than most pinot grigios, this version from the Alto Adige region is very fresh with a note of minerality and apple flavors.\n\nRiff Delle Venezie Pinot Grigio DOC 2022 ($12). A great value, this pinot grigio has simple apple and pear notes. A great sipper on a warm afternoon.\n\nCK Mondavi California Pinot Grigio 2022 ($8). Classic peach and pear notes with a dash of spice dominate this reasonably priced wine.\n\nWine picks\n\nChateau Lassegue ($70). Father and son team Pierre and Nicolas Seillan have turned up the quality of this property since it was granted grand cru classe status in 2022. Merlot, cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon combine to deliver a full-bodied, generously flavored wine to pair with a good steak.\n\nPasso delle Mule Sicilia DOC 2022 ($29). This is another terrific value from Sicily. It has intense aromas with lively cherry, raspberry and plum flavors. We loved this wine.\n\nArgentiera Pollgio ai Ginepri 2022 ($34). This super-Tuscan wine from Bolgheri is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot, cabernet franc and petit verdot. Good, soft tannins with cherry and plum notes and full body.\n\nSauvignon blanc takes the heat off summer\n\nJuly 22, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nAs the temperatures rise, consumers often turn to sauvignon blanc for refreshment. Known for its crisp acidity, sauvignon blanc serves as a powerful foil to hot days on the boat or patio. While chardonnay is a delicious wine to pair with an elegant dinner in air-conditioned comfort, sauvignon blanc is better sipped alone or alongside a crudite platter.\n\nNot all sauvignon blanc tastes the same. Those from New Zealand are known for their fresh-mown grass and bell pepper characteristics. Consumers often find these versions pungent and overly acidic, but they are unquestionably refreshing. Sauvignon blancs from Bordeaux, on the other hand, are rounder because they are blended with a good dose of semillon. No matter where they are from, generally the flavors include grapefruit, stone fruit and lemon or lime.\n\nWhile these wines are often inexpensive, we have noticed several pricier sauvignons have entered the market. Although these are interesting wines, sauvignon blanc doesn’t have to be complex to be enjoyed. Many of these expensive wines are aged in oak to make them more complex.\n\nWe found several premium sauvignon blancs, listed below, that take the grape variety to a new level – for those who can afford it.\n\nOne example from Flora Springs puts an interesting twist on this reliable grape variety. This highly respected winery was recently purchased by Chateau Smith-Haut-Lafitte of Bordeaux, but the Komes family kept the Flora Springs, Trilogy and Soliloquy brands as well as more than 275 acres in Napa Valley.\n\nThe 2023 Soliloquy ($70), an unusual blend of sauvignon blanc, malvasia and chardonnay, isn’t your typical sauvignon blanc. But, wow, what a wine. It has more dimension with the additional grapes: the sauvignon blanc brings honeysuckle notes while the malvasia and chardonnay add green apple and citrus flavors.\n\nHere are some other sauvignon blancs we recently tasted:\n\nDomaine Curry Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($45). We like the pink grapefruit and tropical fruit flavors and mineral note in this delicious sauvignon blanc. Well worth the price.\n\nGamble Family Vineyards Gamble Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($55). This sauvignon blanc continues to amaze us year after year. It’s not for those of you who prefer the tart sauvignon blancs from New Zealand. With heavy use of a musque clone from the Loire, the wine has a rich mouthfeel. Add to that another clone from Loire and two clones originating from Bordeaux and you have a very different and satisfying sauvignon blanc from the producer’s estate vineyard – one that sells some of its grapes to the likes of Realm Cellars and Hourglass. It has generous honeysuckle and stone fruit aromas followed by peach, lychee and lemon meringue flavors.\n\nCloudy Bay Te Koko New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc 2021 ($65). Using grapes from old vines cultivated on the floor of the Wairau Valley, this delicious wine gets some oak fermentation to give the wine complexity and texture. We found pink grapefruit, white peach and citrus mingling with a definitive mineral note.\n\nFrancois Lurton Les Fumees Blanches Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($15). Sauvignon blanc is a good call for spring fare and this one is a good value. Crisp and zesty with citrus and pineapple notes.\n\nTaft Street Winery Russian River Valley Garagistes Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($30). The barrel aging in this version of sauvignon blanc gives it a round mouthfeel and some oak flavors. Otherwise, expect to find white peach, apricot flavors with a floral aroma.\n\nTextbook Russian River Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($21). Melon and floral aromas give way to simple citrus flavors with a dash of minerality.\n\nFranciscan Estate California Chardonnay 2022 ($13). Stone fruit and citrus make this a pleasing wine to sip or serve along a fresh vegetable or fruit tray.\n\nRombauer Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($28). Known first for its chardonnay, Rombauer’s sauvignon blanc is often overlooked. Tropical fruit, pineapple and lime notes\n\nStags’ Leap Winery Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($35). White peach and zesty lime with a floral nose and good acidity.\n\nDough Wines Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($19). While most of the wines from this producer hail from California, winemaker Heidi Bridenhagen tapped into some grapes from Wither Hills Winery in New Zealand for her new sauvignon blanc. It has distinct peach and mango notes with some grapefruit, grass and mineral.\n\nStags’ Leap Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($35). We enjoyed the floral and herbal aromas of this wine. The palate includes an array of citrus flavors, plus white peach, to make it an expressive sauvignon blanc.\n\nDecoy California Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($20). Always a great value, Duckhorn’s Decoy series delivers balanced and fruit-forward wines. Sourcing grapes from several regions, it produces a wine with refreshing acidity and varietal grapefruit and citrus notes.\n\nTapestry Wines’ Central Coast Sauvignon Blanc 2023 ($18). Peach, lime and balanced acidity make this a very quaffable sauvignon blanc to enjoy alone or share with summer fare.\n\nWine picks\n\nOur Daily Cab 2023 ($11). No sulfites and gluten free, this wine has a lot of stuffing for the price. Blue fruit aromas with ripe plum, blackberry flavors with a hint of dark chocolate.\n\nMaterra Cunat Family Vineyards Chardonnay 2021 ($36). From the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley, this well-balanced and creamy chardonnay is from a producer new to us. Lots of stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of almonds.\n\nRumor Cotes de Provence AOP Rose 2023 ($30). Floral with peach and citrus flavors, this rose is an exotic blend of grenache, cinsault, syrah, mourvedre and tibouren. It is certified organic and vegan.\n\nSapaio Volpolo Bolgheri DOC 2022 ($36). This blend of cabernet sauvignon, merlot and petit verdot from the Bolgheri region of central Italy is an easy-to-drink quaff that would do well with barbecued meats.\n\nGood rose comes from areas other than southern France\n\nJuly 15, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nRosé has been around for a long time, but for U.S. consumers it got off to a rocky start. For centuries, the French have been making exquisite and bone-dry rosé in southern France while American consumers were cutting their teeth – coating their teeth – on a sugary concoction that abused the name rosé. Even though many of these French producers make only rosé, their product wasn’t as available as Sutter Home’s infamous and prolific white zinfandel. It took years to undo the damage caused by those sweet concoctions and once that happened, sales of dry rosé took off. And, when they did, producers here and abroad added rosé to their vast portfolios just to stay in the game.\n\nSales accelerated through the covid pandemic when the phrase “rosé all day” took on a new life with people cooped up indoors. Now, however, it appears rosé sales – like all wine sales – have tapered off. It’s not as if consumers have grown tired of rosé in particular, it’s just that drinking massive quantities of this fun drink doesn’t have the same appeal for some folks.\n\nFor us, a glass of rosé is a favorite in warm weather. The color sets a fun tone to a party and its crisp acidity and chill offset the effects of warm afternoons on the boat, patio or beach. Furthermore, there are few wines as versatile as rosé with food. Because the fare turns lighter in the summer, you can pair it with a cold vegetable tray, cheese, grilled chicken, most seafood dishes and dips.\n\nIf you’re looking for something special from France, we recommend the 2023 Forever Young Cotes de Provence Rosé ($26). If the name doesn’t pull you in, the flavors will. This tasty wine, packaged in perhaps the most attractive rosé bottle on the market, leans on cinsault. Added to the blend is grenache and syrah to give the wine layers of bright red fruit and citrus, followed by a hint of minerality. Refreshing and lively on the palate.\n\nFrance has been making rosé the longest, but Spain has been making rosado for a long time with the local grapes of tempranillo, garnacha, mazuelo and graciano. Italian producers rely on aglianico, montepulciano, negromara and sangiovese.\n\nA few weeks ago we focused exclusively on rosés from Southern France. This week, we look at California and other regions.\n\nMost California producers follow the French in using grenache, syrah, mourvedre and cinsault, but we have tasted many rosés made from pinot noir and even cabernet sauvignon grapes.\n\nWhile the grapes vary, the vinification process is much the same. The grapes are pressed quickly and shortly to reduce contact between the juice of the skins. This keeps the color light, the acidity sharp, and the flavors fresh. The wines are usually simple, but producers such as those in Tavel add complexity by cold soaking the grapes for at least 12 hours.\n\nThere is a certain sameness to rosé because terroir doesn’t play as much of a role as it does in, say, the production of cabernet sauvignon. The idea is to keep the wine simple, inexpensive and quaffable.\n\nAs the temperatures soar, here’s a parade of tasty rosés to keep you cool:\n\nThree Sticks Castenada Sonoma Coast Rosé 2023 ($45). This may be the best rosé that we have tasted from the United States this year. Beautiful watermelon color lays the groundwork for a delightfully fresh and fruity quaff. Named after the producer’s tasting room – one of the few remaining Mexican-era residences in downtown Sonoma – the rosé comes in a whiskey-like bottle that is similar to relics discovered on the property. Strawberry compote, mano and citrus notes make for a broadly flavored rosé made from Rhone varietals.\n\nDecoy California Rosé 2022 ($20). This blend of syrah, carignan, vermentino and grenache makes for an interesting assembly of fresh summer fruit with a dash of lemon.\n\nAvaline Rosé ($24). Founded by Cameron Diaz and Katherine Power, this vegan-friendly wine draws grapes from southern France. Amongst the mix is grenache, cinsault, syrah and the unusual caladoc. It is simple and light with melon and citrus notes.\n\nCVNE Cune Rosado 2022 ($15). Made entirely from tempranillo grapes, this Spanish rosé has ripe and juicy strawberry flavors with a twist of orange and a touch of sweetness.\n\nHogwash California Rosé 2023 ($18). Effusive grapefruit aromas are followed by orange and stone fruit flavors.\n\nFrank Family Leslie Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023 ($50). Nothing from this venerable producer is average. Even this rosé seems to have more body and complexity than your average pink wine. Lots of red fruit character with a hint of citrus and balanced acidity. Very delicious.\n\nDutcher Crossing Winemakers’ Cellar Rosé of Grenache 2022 ($39). From Dry Creek Valley, this luxurious rosé has peach and apricot aromas followed by cherry and citrus flavors.\n\nPresqu’ile Santa Maria Valley Rosé 2023 ($32). Made from pinot noir grapes, this excellent rosé has big strawberry notes.\n\nLow alcohol wines\n\nWines with reduced alcohol levels are gaining attraction as consumers become more concerned about the health effects from alcohol consumption. We recently tasted Giesen wines from New Zealand and, although they don’t appeal to us, they have consumer appeal for those who want to continue drinking wine but in moderation.\n\nThe alcohol is reduced to 6 percent through a traditional spinning cone technology.\n\nGiesen Pure Light Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($15) has half as much alcohol and 45 percent fewer calories – only 62 calories per 5-oz. serving. It has bold tropical fruit notes.\n\nGiesen also makes a traditional sauvignon blanc at $17 with 12 percent alcohol (still less than most sauvignon blancs) and a non-alcohol version at $16.\n\nWine picks\n\nMacRostie Nightwing Vineyard Chardonnay 2022 ($58). This delightful and complex chardonnay from Petaluma Gap is its third vintage and from an area that appeals to winemaker Heidi Bridenhagen. It has a lot of spirit and is quite different than the many chardonnays we have tasted this year. Stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of pine.\n\nDanaus Red Wine Catalunya 2022 ($13). We enjoyed this quaffable blend of tempranillo, garnacha and cabernet sauvignon. Simple, soft on the palate with ripe cherry and plum notes. Quite a deal.\n\nLook to Rioja for values in red wine\n\nJuly 8, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWe’ve been sampling a lot of wines from the Rioja region of Northern Spain recently. We were shocked how many great values are coming from this region.\n\nRioja, one of the largest wine-producing regions in Spain, dates back to Roman times. Established as a DO in 1933, it was first to be recognized abroad. Yet even with today’s competition from emerging regions south of it, Rioja is better known in the U.S.\n\nIt is divided into three zones: Rioja Alta, Rioja Oriental and Rioja Alavese. Although many producers blend grapes from all regions, there is a more recent effort to create single-zone wines.\n\nRed wines – often a combination of tempranillo, garnacha, graciano and mazuelo – dominate exports, but we’ve recently tasted many interesting white wines from here, especially malvasia and verdejo. Producers are also blending traditional Bordeaux grapes, such as cabernet sauvignon and merlot. The heavy use of American oak adds layers of flavors – coconut, vanilla and spice.\n\nHow long red wine is aged in barrel is noted on the label – a unique marketing effort to imply quality. Crianza is aged one year in oak and one year in bottle. Riserva wines spend at least one year in oak – often more – and cannot be released until three years after bottling. Gran Reserva wines spend at least two years in barrel and another three years in bottle. There aren’t many regions that hold their wines this long and are still able to maintain a reasonable price.\n\nHere are a few we recently discovered:\n\nBodegas Olarra Cerro Ano Gran Reserva Rioja 2015 ($26). Wow, what a wine. Deep in color, it has cherry and citrus aromas with ripe berry flavors and hints of cocoa powder and coffee.\n\nBodegas Beronia Crianza Rioja 2019 ($15). We have seen this wine on many restaurant wine lists and it is a good value. Bright and simple red berry notes with a dash of tobacco and vanilla.\n\nBodegas Beronia Reserva Rioja 2018 ($25). For a few bucks more, you get more complexity and age in this nicely honed rioja. Graciano and mazuelo are added to the tempranillo to give it a broader, more full-bodied dimension. Ripe plum and dark berry flavor with a smooth finish with a dash of hazelnuts and chocolate.\n\nBodegas Beronia Tempranillo Elaboracion Especial Rioja 2021 ($22). You can find this terrific wine for under $20 if you look hard. And, it’s worth the effort. Juicy plum and dark fruit flavors with hints of vanilla and oak. Fermented in American oak, it has a breezy, easy-to-drink style.\n\nBodegas Fundadas La Rioja Alta Vina Ardanza Reserva 2016 ($42). Given the labor that goes into this tempranillo/garnacha blend, we’re surprised it’s this cheap. Good producers like this one rack the wine twice a year for three years, then age it in barrels for another three years. And, it still tastes young. Supple tannins, black cherry and raspberry notes with a dash of spice, vanilla and cedar. Decant this wine before serving.\n\nLa Mal-Dita Garnacha Rioja 2022 ($17). Based on old-vines grown on high-altitude vineyards, this grenache has ripe strawberry and cherry notes.\n\nRamon Bilbao Reserva Rioja 2016 ($32). The aging makes a difference is this forward and soft blend of tempranillo, graciano and mazuelo. Spicy and oak-infused flavors of vanilla toast mingle with blackberry and black pepper flavors.\n\nRamon Bilbao Rueda Verdejo 2022 ($19). You need to try verdejo, our new favorite white wine grape that is reasonably priced and loaded with bright, fresh fruit for summer sipping. White peach and citrus notes make it a tangy response to light fare.\n\nBodegas Valdemar Conde Valdemar Reserva Rioja 2015 ($30). Garnacha, graciano and maturana join tempranillo (79 percent) to make a wonderful quaff that has bright, youthful character. Strawberry notes with hints of spice and toffee.\n\nBodegas Montecillo Reserva Rioja 2015 ($20). A little manzuelo is added to the tempranillo of this full-bodied and voluptuous wine. Blackberry and plum aromas leap from the glass. There is a hint of licorice and coffee on the palate along with the classic, oak-inspired vanilla.\n\nCampillo el Sueno Rioja 2021 ($19). This pleasant and quaffable blend of chardonnay and viura has some nice citrus notes with a good dose of oak.\n\nOntanon Tempranillo Blanco 2022 ($18). This unusual wine has intense pineapple aromas and luscious stone fruit flavors.\n\nAn Italian meal\n\nIt’s not uncommon for an Italian wine producer to also make olive oil. C’mon, it’s Italy. But we happened to take pleasure in pasta and olive oil made by the Frescobaldi family.\n\nTirrena Past is cultivated from ancient grains grown in Tuscany’s fresh soil and mild climate. It is made entirely of Tuscan wheat. Laudemio Frescobaldi Extra Virgin Olive Oil dates back to the Middle Ages and is made from the best part of the harvest. Put it all together with a bottle of Tenuta Ammiraglia Masso Vivo 2022 ($22), a vermentino that would marry well with some seafood in that pasta.\n\nWine picks\n\nWaypoint Terra de Promissio Pinot Noir 2021 ($60). This Sonoma Coast pinot noir has fresh raspberry and blackberry notes with a dash of dried rosemary.\n\nTextbook Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($27). Reasonably priced, this solid cabernet sauvignon is a favorite of many restaurants we visit. For the price, you get a lot plump red fruit flavor with a hint of vanilla and plum. Textbook also makes a tasty reserve cabernet sauvignon from Napa Valley fruit ($46) that delivers more concentration and body.\n\nDomaine Bousquet: from France to Argentina on a dare\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWhen Anne Bousquet grew up helping her father make wine in southern France, the last thing she wanted to pursue as a profession was wine. It was hard work for a kid and she wasn’t old enough to enjoy the fruits of her labor. But life can throw you a lot of curves and today she and her husband are leading one of the top-producing wineries in the Uco Valley region of Argentina.\n\nHow she got from France to Argentina is loaded with curves.\n\nThe story begins as an exchange student in St. Cloud, MN, whose brutal winter was a cruel contrast to the weather in the picturesque village of Carcassonne, France. But among the exchange students from other countries was her future husband -- Labid Ameri from Spain. She was studying to be an economist and he was pursuing a career as a stock broker. Eventually, they landed well-paying jobs in Boston while Anne’s father, Jean, continued to make wine. But, after falling in love with Argentina while he was on vacation, Jean decided to sell everything when he was 50 years old and buy virgin land in the remote Gualtallary Valley. No one else was growing vines here in the mid-1990s, but all Jean’s intuition and training as a grape grower told him this was an ideal location for a vineyard. Unlike southern France where the abundant rain made it difficult to farm organically, the arid valley afforded him the opportunity to grow grapes without the use of pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilizer. It was Jean’s dream – but not yet Anne’s dream.\n\n“I thought he was crazy,” Anne said in a recent interview over lunch and a tasting of Domaine Bousquet’s vast portfolio of wines. “I mean, he’s living in southern France. Then Argentina? Crazy. But I was in denial. He can do anything he wants, I thought. I had my own thing going.”\n\nMany people said he was crazy, including Argentinians who thought it was too cold to grow grapes at an elevation of nearly 5,000 feet. There wasn’t even a source for water or electricity on this land. But Jean drilled his own well to supply nourishment for new wines.\n\nOn top of those obstacles, ants love the sandy soil and formed a conga line from the delicious vine leaves to their nests on adjoining properties. Anne is obsessed with them, but there are few sustainable weapons in her quiver to fight them.\n\nNaidu: from India to California on a vine\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWe are always inspired by people who leave established careers to pursue the art of making wine. On one hand, it seems reckless, but on the other hand it is a gutsy leap of faith that a better life awaits you. And sometimes it does.\n\nThe reasons always vary. We know of wealthy people who just wanted their friends to see their name on a label or they wanted a house that overlooked a vineyard. Lofty, ego-driven goals without a good business plan are doomed to fail. But, for those who give up a solid career to dedicate themselves to becoming involved in making a wine as well as making a profit persevere through hard work and diligence.\n\nSuch is the case with Raghni Naidu, who grew up in Punjab, India. Vineyards are very scarce in India, so it’s improbable that she would make this a business. However, she was influenced by her mother who had an adventurous spirit for culinary experiences from around the world.\n\n“My mother was passionate about global cuisine,” Naidu told us in a recent phone interview. “There were so many basic things that weren’t a part of the Indian diet. She traveled and brought back seeds for vegetables she grew and shared with family and friends.”\n\nWhen her brother pursued a hospitality degree in Australia, he brought home wines to share with the family and that’s where her interest in wine began. She moved with her husband to California in 2006 and the landscape quickly changed as those memories around the family dinner table flooded back. After some travel to southern France, Naidu turned her dreams to winemaking.\n\nIn 2018 she bought nearly 5 acres of an existing pinot noir vineyard close to Sebastopol, and began to fulfill her dream with hard work and a commitment to quality. Today, Naidu wines are in a three-star Michelin restaurant and are featured in many Indian restaurants.\n\nHer new venture wasn’t without challenge. The COVID-19 pandemic brought operations to a near standstill. Then came the Sonoma Glass Fire in 2020 when she dropped fruit instead of sacrificing quality. But she was determined.\n\n“I wanted to build a legacy for my children by making wines that are authentic and representing who I am,” she said.\n\nHer story as the only Indian-born female winemaker and owner has served as inspiration to other women, particularly among minorities who see her commitment as a path that can be followed.\n\nNaidu kept the original pinot noir vines, but looked to other grapes to expand her portfolio – viognier, cabernet franc, grenache blanc and chardonnay. She purchased grapes from other producers in Sonoma and Russian River Valley. She grew production from 75 cases in 2020 to 2,000 cases this year without reducing quality.\n\nShe admitted it was a “huge risk” to start Naidu in such a competitive environment but always remained confident of success. Like a vine struggles to get through hardpan and rock, a good producer can blossom into something great under duress.\n\n“Stress often brings out the best in people. There is likeness in life and struggle,” she said.\n\nHere are several of her wines we enjoyed:\n\nNaidu Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir 2021 ($75). Using the two original vineyard clones, the pinot noir is aged in French oak barrels for 15 months to give it some nice texture and complexity. Raspberry and cherry flavors abound with hints of dried rosemary and spice.\n\nNaidu Catie’s Corner Vineyard Russian River Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($50). This single-vineyard chardonnay gets limited malolatic fermentation to preserve the acidity and bright fruit character. Ripe melon notes highlight a food-friendly wine.\n\nNaidu Catie’s Corner Vineyard Russian River Valley Viognier 2022 ($50). Viognier is a challenge because it more about aromatics than flavor, but this version has both. Generous aromas of stone fruit followed by tropical fruit flavors and a dash of clove.\n\nNaidu Cassata Vineyard Sonoma Valley Cabernet Franc 2022 ($65). Cabernet franc also can be one-dimensional and commonly plays a supporting role in red blends. But in the right soil and climate, it can blossom into something special. We enjoyed the blackberry, blueberry and cassis notes.\n\nRhys\n\nWe recently tasted a series of pinot noirs and chardonnays from Rhys Vineyards, an extraordinary producer that is sourcing grapes throughout the Santa Cruz Mountains and Mendocino County under the direction of founder Kevin Harvey.\n\nWhat was remarkable in our tasting is that these wines don’t follow the over-extracted, over-oaked, over-ripe style that has been a roadmap for many California producers in the past. The chardonnays are crisp and balanced; the pinot noirs are subtle and beguiling, much like a burgundy.\n\nHarvey immersed himself in fine wine, viticulture, enology and geology before growing pinot noir in his backyard near the border of the Santa Cruz Mountains in 1995. Eventually, he expanded his vineyard and the rest is history, as they say. Instead of buying existing vineyards, he believed it was best to plant vineyards from scratch. He planted seven small estate vineyards.\n\nIn particular, we liked the Rhys Mt. Pajaro Vineyard Santa Cruz Mountain Chardonnay 2021 ($95). The vineyard is perched at 900 feet a few miles from Monterey Bay. The proximity to ocean breezes cools the grapes at night and lets them mature more evenly. We liked the citrus and lemon meringue notes in this balanced wine.\n\nThe 2021 pinot noir from this vineyard is equally stellar with young and fresh black cherry and raspberry fruit flavors.\n\nRhys also draws grapes from the Anderson Valley. Its’ Bearwallow Vineyard Pinot Noir ($105) is an extraordinary expression of this grape variety with aging potential. Full body with red fruit and earthy character.\n\nAlthough expensive, the chardonnay and pinot noirs from the Horseshoe Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains show intensity. The chardonnay has an intriguing honeysuckle component and a full body.\n\nWine picks\n\nJ. Lohr Syrah Estates South Ridge Syrah 2022 ($15). You can’t beat the price of this juicy and spicy wine with cherry notes.\n\nGoosecross A Rose for Lucy 2023 ($39). This enjoyable Carneros rose made from pinot noir has strawberry and raspberry notes with a bit of citrus and balanced acidity.\n\nTenuta Calimaia Vino Nobile di Montepulciano 2019 ($25). From Frescobaldi, this beautiful sangiovese is well worth every penny. Generous red fruit aromas with dried herbs are followed by cherry flavors with a hint of spice. Very young and lively on the palate, it is a great match to grilled foods.\n\nIt’s hot — break out those roses\n\nJune 10, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nIt has been years since rosé finally got a good grip on consumer wallets. Once the exclusive product of southern France and then the darling of the white zinfandel craze of the 1980s, rosé has finally earned a respectable place at the table.\n\nBut despite its durability on the market, it has become a victim of its own success. Today nearly every producer in every country makes rosé from just about every grape variety. So, if you can find rosés from Spanish tempranillo, California pinot noir, Italian corvina or Argentine malbec, what is the definition of rosé?\n\nWe first associate rosé with southern France, a region where rosé relies on a handful of grapes cultivated for generations of farmers whose sole goal is to make rosé. It is here where producers have been perfecting the summer quaff for centuries. Many of them, such as Domaine Ott, make nothing but rosé. While many producers use whatever grape varieties are in their vineyards, their products contribute to what some French producers derisively have called a “swimming pool” of rosé. France has its own swimming pool of plonk, but they aren’t as quick to admit it.\n\nEvery year we taste our way through dozens of rosés from every country, and the differences are often remarkable. In the typical rosé, the crushed grapes soak with their skins for only a few hours, which gives the wine its pink hue and simple flavors. Those that have a deeper red color have been left to soak for more than 24 hours. So, any red grape variety will work, but the French varieties give the wine its classic lively red fruit character.\n\nWe think the French have it right by choosing grenache, syrah, cinsault, mourvedre and rolle grapes. These are grapes that perform remarkably well in the heat of Provence and Bandol. These rosés – usually a blend of these grape varieties – have the right acidity, color and fresh fruit character. Many even have complexity but they come at a price. Put them alongside other rosés made from different grape varieties and they stand out.\n\nWe’ll write about the rosés from outside France in a future column. For today, feast your eyes on these exceptional rosés from southern France:\n\nDomaine Ott Chateau de Selle Rosé 2022 ($68). This exquisite and layered rose leans on grenache and cinsault with a little syrah and mourvedre thrown in to keep it interesting. It opens with citrus, vanilla and minerality. White peach and lemon flavors round off a beautiful, intense rosé. Two years ago we visited with Jean-Francois Ott at his Provence tasting room and saw his dedication to making the best rosé in the world.\n\nChateau de Fabregues Costieres de Nimes 2022 ($17). A blend of syrah and grenache, this rosé from southern France has lively acidity, medium body and understated raspberry, apple and white peach notes.\n\nLEOS Cuvee Augusta L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgue 2023 ($19). The Perrin family has teamed up with Nicolas Jaboulet – another great winemaking family – to produce this unique rosé that adds bourboulenc and vermentino to grenache. The result is a highly floral rosé with good concentration and lots of fresh strawberry fruit. This was one of our favorites of the year.\n\nChateau La Mascaronne Cotes de Provence Rosé 2022 ($30). Fresh strawberry and peach notes with a good dose of citrus quickly develop in this bright and tantalizing blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah and rolle grape varieties.\n\nM. Chapoutier Belleruche Cotes-du-Rhone Rosé 2023 ($18). One of our perennial favorites, this classic blend of grenache, syrah and cinsault is an expressive display of stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of anise.\n\nMinuty Prestige Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($25). Twenty-five years ago, producers Jean-Etienne and Francois Matton wanted to produce a signature wine to a wider audience with a reasonable price. We have enjoyed it for years. Strawberry and raspberry notes with a dash of stone fruit and citrus come from this blend of grenache, syrah, rolle and cinsault.\n\nChateau Minuty Rosé et OR 2023 ($35). Lots of fresh citrus and red fruit notes with a dash of mineral. The blend is grenache (80 percent), syrah, cinsault and tibouren.\n\nMathilde Chapoutier Selection ORSURO Cotes de Provence 2023 ($21). This Rhone Valley producer is really into rosés with three selections. This one is a blend of primarily grenache noir and syrah with a bit of cinsault, cabernet sauvignon, clairette and rolle to round out a broad palate of flavors.\n\nChateau d’Escalans Whispering Angel Rosé 2023 ($18). This fav of many consumers, Whispering Angel was an overnight success. It is found on restaurant wine lists and at wine warehouses for a lot less. From Provence, it is semi-dry which may be its reason for success. Smooth with grapefruit and citrus notes and a dash of clove.\n\nMiraval Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($23). The subject of an ugly divorce between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, this wine is successful despite the acrimony between the Hollywood couple. It is a classic blend of cinsault, grenache, syrah and rolle. We always have this one sitting in our refrig, begging for a plate of cheese. Raspberry and citrus notes with lively acidity and a dash of orange peel and minerality.\n\nEsprit Gassier Cotes de Provence Rosé 2023 ($20). Grenache, cinsault, syrah and rolle combine to make a delicately appointed rosé with peach notes.\n\nChateau La Coste Vin de Provence Rosé 2023 ($25). There is some nice complexity in this classic blend of grenache, syrah, cinsault and cabernet sauvignon. Red fruit with a dash of peach and citrus.\n\nFamille Perrin Cotes du Rhone Reserve 2022 ($15). The family behind Chateau Beaucastel has been making another tier of wines for a long time – just waiting to be discovered. This blend of cinsault, mourvedre, grenache and syrah has rasberry notes with crisp acidity.\n\nHecht & Bannier Provence 2023 ($14). Two friends formed this company in 2002 and have been making some terrific rosés since. This one from the Languedoc has strawberry notes and a great mouthfeel.\n\nWine picks\n\nClockwise Sauvignon Blanc Russian River Valley 2023 ($30). Steve MacRostie, who makes wine under his family name, and winemaker Heidi Bridenhagen, launched this brand a decade ago as a playground for new varieties and regions. This simple and aromatic sauvignon blanc is a great sipper on a summer afternoon. Citrus, grapefruit and freshly mown grass dominate. We look forward to what else they produce.\n\nLucia by Pisoni Soberanes Vineyard Chardonnay 2022 ($55). Jeff and Mark Pisoni have a series of chardonnays and pinot noirs that continue to impress us. This one has dense and effusive stone fruit and apple aromas with velvet pear flavors and a distinctive hint of minerality. We also like the pure and rounder estate cuvee chardonnay that sources its fruit from Soberanes and Pisoni vineyards.\n\nSome very special wines for dad\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nEach year we examine some of the best red wines from Napa Valley as suggestions for Father’s Day. We know these are very expensive, but we theorize that this is a very special occasion that calls for a very special wine. Perhaps you can split the cost with your siblings to make it more affordable. Just don’t expect him to share it with you – June 16 is his day.\n\nWe also offer some good alternatives if these prices are out of range. Here are our top 10 cabernet sauvignons for Father’s Day:\n\nChappellet Hideaway Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($175). Hideaway was formerly planted to chenin blanc, but in 2007 the producer planted six blocks of cabernet sauvignon on this secluded 13-acre plot. Ever since then, this mountain wine has been a homerun. Said winemaker Phillip Titus, “When grown the correct way in the right soils, mountain cabernet gives you more of almost everything – complexity, more power and more tannins.” This is an immense wine with concentrated black fruit notes and hints of herbs and pepper.\n\nFlora Springs Napa Valley Trilogy 2021 ($100). The family sold this historic St. Helena winery in 2019, but kept 20 acres of prime vineyards to make its own wine with a greater interest in reducing back production nearly in half. They also revitalized 20 acres in its prized Komes Ranch Vineyard in Ruthford, the primary source for this beautiful wine. This Trilogy -- a blend of cabernet sauvignon, petit verdot and malbec -- continues a label that is nearly 40 years old. It has concentrated black fruit flavors with hints of mint, coffee and cola.\n\nTurnbull Amoenus Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($145). Most of the vineyards used by this respectable Napa Valley producer are from the Oakville AVA, but the Amoenus Vineyard is on the rolling hills of Calistoga. Floral and spicy aromas hand off to a beautiful tapestry of ripe blackberry and cherry flavors that are enveloped by soft, fine tannins.\n\nBeringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 ($175). We have tasted enough of Beringer’s top marquee wine that are 10-15 years old to know that these wines can age – just like dad. Always big and concentrated, the 2020 has floral and blueberry aromas, classic dark cherry, plum and currant fruit flavors, hints of vanilla and spice, and plenty of tannins to complement that grilled steak.\n\nBeaulieu Vineyards Georges de Latour Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2020 ($160). BV’s private reserve was a collector’s prize as soon as it was first released in 1940. We have tasted different vintages of this wine since the 1980s and enjoyed every one of them, including some that have been decades old. It is dense, complex and full of that great Napa Valley fruit. Black cherry and plum notes dominate the palate experience.\n\nDouble Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($90). This is a colossal but approachable wine from the Schrader house. Aggressive black fruit and cassis aromas with plum and black cherry flavors, hints of tea, earth and vanilla.\n\nAcumen Mountainside Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($85). This Napa Valley producer has a stunning array of cabernet sauvignons ranging from this one to its dense and opulent PEAK Edcora Vineyard. Maybe it’s had to call the Mountainside a “bargain,” but it stands tall with anything else in this ranking. It is more expressive than the PEAK cousins, which have a classic style reminiscent of those old-style, age-worthy cabernets from the 1970s. The Mountainside has a fruit-forward personality with merlot and malbec to round off the tannins. Ripe plum mingles with chocolate and mocha on the palate. Floral, violet aromas add to the black cherry notes.\n\nEhlers Estate Jean Leducq Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($160). Named for French entrepeneurs and philantropists Jean and Sylvia Leducq, this top-shelf wine from St. Helena is an iron fist in a velvet glove. Made only in the best vintages, it will be drinking nicely well into the future, but can be enjoyed now. We tasted it alongside the more concentrated 1886 Cabernet Sauvignon ($120) from the same vintage. The 1886 date is when the winery was founded by Bernard Ehlers. It was purchased by the Leducq Charitable Trust in 1996.\n\nSullivan Coeur de Vigne Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($100). This tribute to Sullivan Rutherford Estate’s historic location is a colossal wine with classic Napa Valley character. A blend of cabernet sauvignon (80 percent), merlot and petit verdot, it utilizes the personality of each grape variety to achieve a well-structured, balanced wine with blackberry, black cherry and blueberry flavors. This wine can be enjoyed now, which means dad doesn’t have to get any older to enjoy it.\n\nPriest Ranch Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($60). Generous red cherry aromas, flavors of dark fruity, licorice and mocha.\n\nLess expensive alternative wines:\n\nHahn Family Wines California Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($16). Always a decent value, this expressive wine has cherry aromas and a hint of leather with ripe black fruit flavors.\n\nTrue Myth Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($24). This inexpensive cabernet sauvignon from California is a decent wine for everyday drinking. Easy, quaffable with smooth ripe red fruit.\n\nTenuta Luce Lucente 2021 ($29). One of our favorite wines year after year, this super-Tuscan blend combines merlot with the local sangiovese to present a delicious, round and ripe berry flavored wine that would go with ribs, burgers and other grilled meat.\n\nDomaine Bousquet Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($13). For the price, you get a lot of juicy and ripe red berry flavors and supple tannins to make this a decent match with grilled beef. This Argentine producer is making some the best values on the market today.\n\nQuerciabella Chianti Classico DOCG 2019 ($32). A very complete Tuscan red wine. Plum and dried cherry elements present in a smooth soft tannin wine. Good now but can age a few years.\n\nWine picks\n\nQuinta da Fonte Souto Branco White 2022 ($27). This wine from the Alentejo region of Portugal has Symington’s stamp of quality. Made mostly from arinto grapes, the wine benefits from being fermented and stirred on its lees. There is a soft texture and extracted fruit that may otherwise have been lost. Good complexity.\n\nJ. de Villebois Sancerre Rosé 2023 ($30). Lots of strawberry and raspberry notes in this semi-dry rosé from Sancerre.\n\nGarofoli Podium Anniversario Verdiccho dei Castlli di Jesi 2021 ($30). From Italy’s Marche region, this pleasant and quaffable verdiccho has elegant citrus notes.\n\nFire up that grill and enjoy a glass of wine\n\nMay 27, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nNothing excites the senses more than a Sunday afternoon behind the grill. Many people enjoy year-round grilling temperatures, but others are trapped indoors and too timid to brave the elements for a grilled steak. But with Memorial Day behind us, barbecue season is officially under way.\n\nA sizzling burger over fire puts us in a summer mood. It is the ideal time to invite friends and family over to the house for an outdoor meal. Serve a rosé or a prosecco as you fire up the grill and invite guests to help plate the meal.\n\nWhile stews and chili are the fare for winter meals, lighter fare such as fish and grilled vegetables make more sense in warmer months. The goal is to keep it simple and fresh.\n\nChoosing a wine to go with your entree shifts in warmer months just as much as the food. Cabernet sauvignon is good for beef and lamb, but most grilled foods call for lighter wines. A ketchup-based sauce on that pulled pork or ribs calls for something fruity – merlot, syrah, and especially zinfandel. Keep it simple if burgers are the choice: beaujolais, valpollicella, or chianti\n\nAn elegant dinner of duck, salmon or tuna allows you to explore a serious pinot noir. Although often pricey, pinot noir has the heft to complement many entrees with red-based sauces. Ketchup and tomatoes are usually a part of barbecue sauces, so lighter red wines do well.\n\nWhite fish opens the door to many choices, chardonnay being our favorite. Any sauce with citrus as a base calls for sauvignon blanc or pinot gris.\n\nWe like rosé with grilled chicken because it is so fruity and adaptable to many sauces. Sauvignon blanc works well here, too, but don’t forget the white wines from Portugal, Italy and Spain for adventure and variety. Try a vinho verde from Portugal, an albarino or verdejo from Spain, or soave or gavi from Italy. Any of these are great sipping wines but can join a plate of fresh vegetables or cheese.\n\nHere are 12 suggested wines – many good values -- to officially launch barbecue season:\n\nDomaine Bousquet Premium Organic Malbec 2022 ($13). Using fruit from the Uco Valley, this malbec has the right amount of juiciness to complement marbled beef and other grilled fare. Red berry aromas and soft tannins make it as easy drink. This producer makes some of the best value-driven wines. Great with beef.\n\nRombauer California Zinfandel 2021 ($38). The dash of petite sirah in this wine gives it more heft and color. Juicy and ripe blackberry notes with a dollop of clove and vanilla. Think ribs, burgers and pizza.\n\nDomaine Bousquet Cabernet Sauvignon 2022 ($13). For the price, you get a lot of juicy and ripe red berry flavors and supple tannins to make this a decent match with grilled beef. Tasted blind, this wine has gotten a lot of accolades in our circle.\n\nLyric Monterey County Pinot Noir 2022 ($20). We thought it was impossible to find a good pinot noir under $50, but this one proves us wrong. Bright red berry flavors, medium body and a smooth finish. It would do well alongside grilled veggies and simple entrees such as burgers, salmon and pork.\n\nOrin Swift Cellars Abstract 2022 ($45). This beautiful blend of grenache, syrah and petite syrah is an ideal match with almost any grilled meat or barbecue sauce.\n\nOrin Swift 8 Years in the Desert 2022 ($53). Ripe tannins and oodles of sweet blackberries and spice make this a delicious yet serious wine to pair with beef.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates South Ridge Syrah 2022 ($15). Ripe blackberry compote with notes of black cherries and spice, this syrah has a seductive mouthfeel. Perfect for pasta, meats, ribs and pizza.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates Seven Oaks Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($17). Another great value from J. Lohr, this wine has plum, black currant and cassis notes.\n\nQuinta do Vesuvio Comboio do Vesuvio DOC 2020 ($25). Some of the best values in wine today come from Portugal. The train on the label recognizes the track that runs alongside this vineyard. Its constant rumble obviously doesn’t disturb the vines. It is an almost equal share of touriga franca, touriga nacional and tinta roriz grapes. It is not aged in oak, which makes this fruit-forward quaff easy to drink alongside everyday fare. Youthful strawberry aromas with ripe plum and cherry flavors with a hint of clove and ripe tannins. This is a versatile wine that would do well with meats, pasta, tuna and just by itself.\n\nMarco Felluga Mongris Collo Pinot Grigio DOC 022 ($21). With grapes grown in mineral-rich but poor soils in the Collio region of Italy, this pinot gris has bright and fresh floral aromas with apple and pear flavors. Think fish, poultry and aperitif.\n\nBerona Crianza 2019 ($15). We have seen this wine on many restaurant lists and it is a good value. Bright and simple red berry notes with a dash of tobacco and vanilla.\n\nTenuta Whitaker Mozia Grillo Sicilia DOC 2022 ($25). We like grillo as an alternative to pinot grigio and even chardonnay. It has good acidity, pure fruit character with stone fruit and apple notes accented with minerality.\n\nWine picks\n\nInama Carmenere Piu IGT 2021 ($22). A blend of carmenere and merlot, this wine from the Veneto region of northeastern Italy has a broad range of red and dark fruit flavors, medium body. It is easy to drink alongside a nice steak.\n\nChappellet Signature Chenin Blanc 2023 ($75). We don’t think we have ever tasted a California chenin blanc this good. This site on Pritchard Hill has been producing chenin blanc before Donn and Molly Chappellet purchased the property the late 1960s and has become an institution as several winemakers have passed through here. Delicious is a word that doesn’t do it justice. Fermented in French oak barrels and stainless-steel tanks, it has a strong personality with effusive pear and apple aromas and melon, citrus flavors.\n\nPapapietro Perry Russian River Valley Pinot Noir 2021 ($61). This pinot noir from wind-swept Sonoma Coast exudes hedonistic pleasure. Raspberry and floral aromas are followed by vibrant black cherry and plum flavors.\n\nChoices to celebrate Chardonnay Day\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMay 26 is World Chardonnay Day, a good time to recognize the most prolific and most prestigious white grape in the world. Considered to have started in France, chardonnay is the grape variety that is the foundation of great burgundies and chablis. Yet, despite its popularity, it is the grape variety to fashionably hate.\n\nNot us.\n\nChardonnay is grown almost in every wine growing region in the world because, unlike pinot noir and riesling, it is a variety that adapts well to most soils and environments. Over the years, styles of chardonnay have come and gone, the most notable of which were the oaky versions from Australia and California. Today, chardonnays undergo various levels of malolatic fermentation, a process that converts malo acid to lactic acid in order to reduce acidity and increase creaminess. This method, used judiciously, has made chardonnay more appealing to consumers than the often tart, acidic sauvignon blanc.\n\nOak barrels in fermentation and aging also have influenced style. A wine with 24 months of oak will be more complex – and more expensive. Oak can add a melange of flavors, including toasted almonds, coconut, vanilla and even butterscotch.\n\nHere are a few California chardonnays we recently liked:\n\nDecoy Limited Sonoma Coast Chardonnay ($30). You get a lot of warm opulence in this chardonnay for the money. Peach and apricot flavors are topped off with an array of aromas starting with lime and ending with spice. Very viscous and enjoyable.\n\nMer Soleil Chardonnay Monterey County Santa Lucia Highlands 2021 ($30). Another winner from the uber-successful Wagner family of Caymus fame. Luscious tropical fruit notes of mango and pineapple with perfectly balanced toasty oak notes. A classic big boned California chardonnay.\n\nGoosecross Napa Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($46). This restrained, balanced and food-friendly chardonnay has everything you want in a chardonnay. Tropical fruit, pear and lemon aromas give way to peach and apple flavors.\n\nBeringer Private Reserve Napa Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($50). One of the best chardonnays we’ve tasted in this group, the Beringer PR is full bodied with luscious tropical fruit flavors and touches of toast, apple and spice. Very long on the finish.\n\nChateau Montelena Napa Valley Chardonnay 2021 ($75). We liked the great balance in this exquisite wine. The fruit is ripe but overly so. There is good acidity and minerality to balance the ripe melon and lemon curd flavors. Broad aromas of apple and stone fruit.\n\nRhys Horseshoe Vineyard Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay 2021 ($125). Excellence comes with a price and this is the case here. From the often-overlooked Santa Cruz corner of the world, this elegant wine gets full barrel fermentation for 12 months and an additional 6 months in stainless steel. The oak notes are fleeting and don’t overpower the rich honeysuckle and citrus flavors. This chardonnay will only intensify as it ages, much like the chardonnays from Burgundy, but it pairs well with food now.\n\nMacRostie Sonoma Coast Chardonnay 2022 ($28). This is a great value in this group of extraordinary chardonnays. Sourcing grapes from the Sangiacomo and Ricci vineyards in Carneros, the producer has crafted a wine with effusive citrus aromas, richness and layers of apple and tropical fruit flavors.\n\nJ. Lohr Estates Riverstone Chardonnay 2022 ($14). The producer is celebrating its 50th anniversary and has a brand new look for its popular chardonnay. A blossomed-theme label teases you into a bouquet of apple and spice followed by stone fruit flavors. One of the best values in chardonnay.\n\nTalley Vineyards San Luis Obispo Coast Chardonnay 2022 ($38). Brian Talley led the 2022 effort to make this region an AVA. Having the coolest temperature in California AVAs, the Pacific breezes make it ideal for both chardonnay and pinot noir. We enjoyed it for its unique flavor profile. Lots of apple notes.\n\nBaldacci Family Vineyards Carneros Chardonay 2022 ($55). Apple aromas and tropical fruit flavors with a dash of spice and a soft-mouthfeel. Delicious.\n\nCuvaison Chardonnay Kite Tail Chardonnay 2022 ($70). This luxurious chardonnay from Los Carneros is very impressive. Stone fruit and apple notes are cloaked in elegance and smoothness. A touch of mineral adds to a very expressive and delicious wine.\n\nBenziger Family Winery Chardonnay 2022 ($16). A pioneer in biodynamic farming, Benziger makes a reliable chardonnay for the value price. Ripe pear notes with a creamy finish.\n\nLandmark Damaris Reserve Chardonnay Sonoma Coast 2022 ($50). Landmark, founded by Damaris Deere Ford, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with this redesign label for its top chardonnay. Apricot aromas with pear and white peach flavors accented by spice and oak.\n\nCunat Family Vineyards Mattera Chardonnay 2021 ($36). From the Oak Knoll District of Napa Valley, this well-balanced and creamy chardonnay is from a producer new to us. Lots of stone fruit and citrus notes with a hint of almonds.\n\nWente Morning Fog Chardonnay 2022 ($18). Still one of the best bargains in chardonnay, this mass-produced Wente wine has persistent apple flavors, good acidity and is not over oaked.\n\nAlma Rosa El Jabali Chardonnay 2021 ($33). From the fabulous Sta. Rita Hills area, this wine taps into one of the best vineyards in Santa Barbara. Nice mineral notes.\n\nAustralian chardonnays\n\nPenfolds Bin 311 Chardonnay 2022 ($40). Penfolds uses several regions to source this austere and food-friendly chardonnay. The mineral notes come from Tasmanian grapes. Added are white peach and citrus notes and a dash of almonds.\n\nVasse Felix Margaret River Chardonnay 2021 ($48). We loved this opulent yet elegant chardonnay from one of the most interesting wine-growing regions in Australian. Stone fruit flavors abound under a cloak of minerality, melon and citrus.\n\nHandpicked Regional Selections Yarra Valley Chardonnay 2022 ($25). This chardonnay seemed to have unusual flavors that we found attractive but hard to describe. We definitely spotted peach with maybe a dash of apricot. Soft mouthfeel.\n\nWine picks\n\nBaldacci Proprietary Red Blend Napa Valley 2021 ($70). Merlot comprises 30 percent of this wine, but also in the blend is a good of cabernet sauvignon plus cabernet franc, malbec and petit verdot. The merlot gives the wine a soft landing on the palate. Lots of plum notes with a dash of spice.\n\nOur Daily Cab 2023 ($11). This inexpensive cabernet sauvignon from California is a decent wine for everyday drinking. Easy, quaffable with smooth ripe red fruit.\n\nTruth Myth Paso Robles Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($24). No sulfites and gluten free, this wine has a lot of stuffing for the price. Blue fruit aromas with ripe plum, blackberry flavors with a hint of dark chocolate.\n\nFew of the historic wineries are family owned\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nEver since we have been writing this column, we have witnessed a lot of turn over in winery owners. You want legendary wineries to stay in the families forever, but sadly that’s not always the case. In France and Italy, owners are several generations deep, but not in California where deep-pocketed entrepeneurs who fancy wine dangle big money in front of tired families.\n\nAlthough the majority of Napa Valley wineries are still family owned, many of the icons have changed hands multiple times as offsprings choose not to pursue the passions of previous generations. Whether these changes have led to a drop in quality or just a sense of remorse is up for debate. In our opinion, those classic cabernet sauvignons of the 1980s are not the same today, in part because trends have taken then in new directions and in part because the bottom line has become more important.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the “big four” wineries in Napa arguably were Beaulieu Vineyards, Inglenook, Charles Krug and Louis Martini. Only two of them – Charles Krug and Inglenook – are still family owned, although that is in spite of an acrimonious fight between brothers Robert and Peter Mondavi and a painful restoration of Inglenook by Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nThe lineage of the families of the other three is byzantine. Inglenook, made famous by Gustav Niebaum in 1897, endured several owners, including United Vintners, Heublein, Constellation and most recently The Wine Group. During many of those phases the product suffered despite having some of the best vineyards in Napa. In 1975, Francis Ford Coppola acquired the estate – but not the brand name until 2011.\n\nBeaulieu, founded in 1900, was in the family until Heublein bought it in 1969. Then came Nabisco, Grand Metropolitan and Diageo. Treasury Estates has owned it since 2016.\n\nLouis Martini founded in the 1930s was bought by Gallo by 2002.\n\nCorporate owners are business people who keep a close eye on the bottom line. Most of them increased production and changed the numbers of wines offered. In some cases, the vineyards that produced these classic wines aren’t used in current wines. Not always have these steps led to improved quality, although BV’s Georges de Latour remains a powerhouse.\n\nWe recently tasted a number of aged cabernet sauvignons from several iconic houses, including one of the four mentioned above. There were remarkable achievements, especially the 2014 Robert Mondavi Maestro.\n\nThe Mondavis sold their winery to Constellation in 2004, but this wine still has the patriarch’s signature. It was concentrated, dense and still showing tannin. “Maestro” recognizes the opening of Mondavi’s To Kaon Cellar in 2000 when Robert led an orchestra in celebration. He was a great leader in Napa Valley.\n\nAlso notable in our tasting was the 2008 Louis Martini Lot 1. Most of the fruit is from Mount Veeder and only 375 cases were made.\n\nWe sampled the 2007 Chateau Montelena estate cabernet sauvignon, but it seemed to be in a dumb stage. Given its pedigree, we have no doubt it will be spectacular. Bo Barrett still owns this winery, but there was a brief dalliance with Cos d’Estournel that fell through.\n\nThe 2007 Beringer Private Reserve, an epic wine that we thought had fallen in prestige over the years, was colossal. It held the classic character of the Napa giants: dense, fragrant, and long living.\n\nThose of you with old wines in your cellar from these great wineries shouldn’t fear that ownership chaos always results in a depreciation of quality. The answer is in the bottle.\n\nThree Sticks\n\nThree Sticks Wines in Sonoma County California was founded in 2002 by William S. Price III. It produces a line of estate chardonnay and pinot noirs that consistently score high marks with wine writers and the public at large.\n\nWe recently tasted its estate-bottled, single-vineyard wines. All of these vineyards are owned by Three Sticks and two of them are considered in the elite of Sonoma County. Caps Crown and Durell vineyards produce grapes for Three Sticks as well as some of the stars of Sonoma County for the likes of Kosta Brown, Kistler, Patz and Hall and others. In some cases, these wines sell for significantly more that their Three Sticks’ cousins.\n\nFollowing are our brief tasting impressions:\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Sonoma Mountain One Sky Vineyard 2017 ($50). Dark yellow color and presenting baked apple, butterscotch and vanilla notes.\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Sonoma Coast Gap’s Crown Vineyard 2021 ($75). A delightful mélange of apple, mineral, tropical fruit and butterscotch. Our favorite.\n\nThree Sticks Chardonnay Russian River Valley Alana Vineyard 2021 ($80). Not as open as the two previous chardonnays, it presented orange, apple notes and a creamy smooth mouthfeel.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast Durell Vineyard 2020. ($80). Our favorite of the pinot noirs. Ripe deep cherry and chocolate. A keeper that will age well.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Russian River Valley William James Vineyard 2021 ($85). A bit brighter than the others with strawberry and rhubarb jam elements.\n\nThree Sticks Pinot Noir Sonoma Coast Gap’s Crown Vineyard 2021 ($80). Blueberry and mocha dominate a very well-constructed pinot noir. A very close second to the Durell Vineyard sample.\n\nWine picks\n\nCK Mondavi and Family Buttery Chardonnay California 2022 ($8). Buttery, indeed. If you like this style, this inexpensive wine has rich, tropical fruit flavors.\n\nAntica Corte Valpolicella Ripasso Classico Superiore 2021 ($24). This silky wine is made entirely of corvina grapes fermented in the ripasso method. Red berry flavors and medium body.\n\nEsporao Reserva Red DOC Alentejo 2021 ($23). We love this wine from southern Portugal. It is a blend of cabernet sauvignon, aragonez, alicante bouschet and trincadeira grapes. Broad in flavors, it has jammy blueberry and plum flavors with hints of coffee and black pepper.\n\nWines to cheer up mom on her special day\n\nApril 29, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMother’s Day is approaching and if you’re a father, you better have something planned. Hopefully, it’s a day off – no chores or obligations and that includes dinner. If you’re taking mom out to a Sunday brunch, the challenge is less onerous than cooking a meal at home.\n\nRestaurants will have sparkling wine to offer mom, but it might be nice to buy her a bottle to share at home. In our circle, women love champagne and sparkling wine. The bubbles that dance off the tongue make her feel special and happy.\n\nNothing will make her feel happier than a bottle of French champagne. Our favorite is Champagne Billecart Salmon Rose ($90), a luxury cuvee of chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier.\n\nHere are some less expensive sparkling wines that would make mom feel special:\n\nJ Brut Rosé ($50). From the Russian River Valley, this delightful and consistent rosé is one of the best the region has to offer. Delicate raspberry and strawberry notes with a dash of orange.\n\nArgyle Vintage Brut 2019 ($30). You get a lot of quality in this simple but well-made sparkling wine from the Willamette Valley. Good acidity and a thread of mineral make it an exception wine to pair with appetizers or just to sip.\n\nOrin Swift You Go First ($60). Pinot noir, pinot meunier and chardonnay go into this enjoyable sparkling wine from Orin Swift. Apple and citrus notes dominate the palate.\n\nJosh Prosecco Rosé ($15). Josh is ubiquitous but this sparkling wine is different. The producer uses glera grapes – the same ones used to make Italian prosecco – but adds some pinot noir to the mix.\n\nAnd give some thought to rosé, a year-round favorite of many mothers. Here are a few we like:\n\nMathilde Chapoutier Cotes de Provence Aurisso Sainte-Victoire 2023 ($28). Mathilde is the daughter of the renowned Michel Chapoutier and traveled around France before settling on Provence for her new label. An eighth generation to make wine, Chapoutier rolls together a tapestry of grenache noir, syrah, cinsault and rolle to create a richer rosé that you usually find from Provence. Raspberries, strawberries and citrus abound with a nice touch of mineral.\n\nOne Stone Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023 ($18). Part of the Ancient Peaks family of wines, this very nice wine pays tribute to all of the women who moved mountains, one stone at a time. A portion of each bottle is donated to Dream Big Darlings, a non-profit that provides educational opportunities and mentorship programs for the next generation of female leaders in the wine and spirits industry. Crisp acidity and raspberry, melon and citrus notes.\n\nHogwash California Rosé 2023 ($18). A good value, this wine has fresh strawberry and grapefruit notes with a dash of mandarin orange. Hogwash also packages this wine in 250-ml cans that come two to a pack for only $11. These are great to throw in a cooler or just sip around the pool.\n\nMixed drinks with sparkling wine\n\nProsecco from northern Italy is a bit sweet, which appeals to a lot of consumer palates. For something different, try a drink that is commonly seen through Europe – the Aperol Spritz. Not only does the Aperol give the glass a beautiful strawberry color, but it adds a nice dose of citrus to make it a great quaff before dinner or at brunch. Here’s a recipe:\n\n3 oz. Prosecco\n\n2 oz. Aperol\n\n1 oz. Club soda\n\nGarnish with a slice of orange.\n\nDirections: put ice cubs in glass. Pour in the prosecco and add Aperol and soda.\n\nAvissi makes a good prosecco and offers this alternative recipe for a Sparkling Cosmo:\n\n1 1/2 oz. vodka\n\n½ oz. Triple Sec\n\n½ oz. Cranberry juice\n\n½ oz. Fresh squeezed lime juice\n\n2 oz. Prosecco\n\nDash of simple syrup or agave\n\nDirections: combine vodka, triple sec, cranberry juice, lime juice and ice in a cocktail shaker. Shake until very cold. Taste and if the mixture seems too tart, add more simple syrup or agave. Strained into a glass and top with prosecco. Garnish with orange twist.\n\nElement AL\n\nBogle Family Wines has a series of wines packaged in aluminum cans that are not only better for the environment but quite convenient. Glass production leaves a huge carbon footprint, so many environmentally forward producers are turning to aluminum and cardboard to package their wine.\n\nElement AL’s container is 80 percent lighter than glass for the same 750-ml amount of wine. It is recyclable.\n\nThe chardonnay we tasted from northern California vineyards was pleasant with stone fruit and pear notes. It sells for $17 a bottle and also comes in rose, pinot grigio and pinot noir.\n\nWine picks\n\nHardy Tintara Reserve Shiraz 2019 ($25). A classic old school ebullient Australian shiraz featuring bold berries, mocha and spice in the nose and mouth. Pair with any bold meat dishes.\n\nDow’s Late Bottled Vintage Port 2018 ($30). This is a real find for port lovers. Vintage port is usually bottled after 2 years in barrel. This Late Bottled Vintage port is held in barrel for 6 years, accelerating the aging process while retaining the unique characteristics of the excellent 2018 vintage. Berry and plum notes abide with a hint of licorice. Ready to drink and enjoy now while you wait 15-20 years for the vintage version to mature.\n\nChateau Ste Michelle Horse Heaven Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc 2021 ($14). We’ve seen this on sale for much less at many stores. It’s a great quaff with varietal grapefruit and citrus notes.\n\nTrivento Golden Reserve Malbec 2020 ($20). This is a stunning malbec for the price. From the Lujan de Cuyo, it has nice tannins to give it weight and longevity. But it also has a lot of forward and juicy strawberry, cherry and raspberry flavors. Delicious.\n\nThe great pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills\n\nApril 22, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWe have always admired the pinot noirs from Santa Barbara County. But, as we have gratefully learned, there’s more to this region than “Santa Barbara.” The more than 280 wineries here are broken into seven American Viticultural Areas. They have unique terroirs and weather to distinguish them from their neighbors.\n\nWe like all of these pinot noirs, but hold a special place in our heart for those from the relatively small Sta. Rita Hills, and AVA designated in 2001 and oddly abbreviated to resolve a protracted legal battle with the Santa Rita winery in Chile. Tucked inside the larger Santa Ynez Valley AVA, Sta. Rita Hills benefits from its proximity to the Pacific Ocean. But the mineral, limestone and marine sediment soil also provide unique flavors.\n\nFor Samra Morris, Sta. Rita Hills is the premiere location for pinot noir and chardonnay, but the area is also gaining an attraction for grenache and syrah.\n\nMorris is the winemaker at Alma Rosa, founded in 2005 by the legendary Richard Sanford and owned by Bob and Barb Zorich since 2014. The mountains here run east to west, unlike the rest of the region where they run north to south. That funnel from the Pacific brings thick morning fog and cool nights – ideal conditions to give a rest to sensitive grape varieties such as pinot noir.\n\nMorris was born and raised in Bosnia, but moved to California after her American husband was transferred from eastern Europe to Travis Air Force Base in northern California. Always wanting to be a winemaker after studying food and vinification sciences at the University of Sarajevo, she started in a tasting room in nearby Napa Valley before working at St. Supery and Michael Mondavi Family Estate. She took a job as assistant winemaker at Alma Rosa in 2019 and stepped into the head winemaker’s role just before harvest.\n\n“They decided if I can survive a war, I can survive this,” she laughed.\n\nHer wines are lovely and pure, which she attributes to the soil and climate. She likes the pinot noirs for their “rose petal nose, vibrant red fruit, raspberries, wild strawberries, orange peel and chalky tannins.”\n\nClones are very important to pinot noir. Morris favors the 943 clone, which produces small clusters she calls “super cute.” These concentrated clusters produce very intense flavors.\n\nThe Santa Barbara AVAs are terrific tourist destinations as well. We have traveled the winding roads many times, stopping at tasting rooms known and unknown. The town Los Olivos plays host to many tasting rooms and the iconic Fess Parker Winery and Inn. Other beautiful tasting rooms are at Alma Rosa, Foley Estates, Melville and Sanford.\n\nMorris calls 2021 a “perfect vintage.”\n\nHere are 10 pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills that we really liked. Alas, they are generally expensive from this AVA.\n\nAlma Rosa Caracol Pinot Noir 2021 ($90). With grapes taken from a knoll top planted in 2015, this vineyard blend of clones and rootstocks shows off a broad array of raspberry and strawberry flavors with a touch of orange peel and mineral. Good acidity and balanced tannin make it a perfect quaff.\n\nAlma Rosa Barrel Select Pinot Noir 2021 ($90). Using grapes from a vineyard 750 feet in elevation, this tightly structured wine has bing cherry, cranberry and spice notes with chalky tannins to make it a good complement to serious foods.\n\nFoley Estates Barrel Select Pinot Noir 2021 ($80). This is a serious pinot noir with big tannins and bold dark cherry and plum flavors. Hints of pepper, spice and oak make it a well-rounded wine for current drinking alongside a steak or it can be aged for a few years.\n\nMigration Peake Ranch Vineyard Pinot Noir 2022 ($75). Bing cherry, raspberry and violet aromas are followed by concentrated red berry flavors with a dose of spice. Very opulent in texture.\n\nKosta-Browne Pinot Noir 2022 ($78). This well-respected producer makes some of the best – and most expensive – pinot noirs in Sta. Rita Hills. But this blend of several vineyards is a good introduction. Blackberry, pomegranate and strawberry notes with a dollop of spice.\n\nSanford La Rinconada Pinot Noir 2020 ($85). This venerable producer makes some of the best pinot noir in all of California. They have depth, concentration and gout de terroir. Many of them far exceed the price of the La Rinconada. This wine has generous raspberry and fennel aromas to lead off a broad spectrum of red fruit and spice.\n\nFess Parker Pinot Noir 2022 ($35). This is the most reasonably priced pinot noir from this region you’ll probably find. It’s simple and approachable with blueberry, cranberry and strawberry notes. Medium-bodied.\n\nSea Smoke Southing Pinot Noir 2021 ($95). A lot of care and attention goes into this concentrated and juicy pinot noir. Classic cherry notes with bright strawberry aromas and a thin thread of minerality to keep it interesting.\n\nSandhi Sanford & Benedict Pinot Noir 2019 ($45). Another reasonably priced pinot noirs from Sta. Rita Hills, this is medium bodied, very delicious and approachable with juicy black cherry flavors.\n\nRockhound Radian Vineyard Pinot Noir 2022 ($90). Launched just last year, this producer is Reed and Megan Skupny, the second generation of Lang & Reed. From a very special vineyard, the pinot noir is a co-ferment of three Burgundian clones aged for 16 months in French oak. It is an exquisite wine with black cherry and plum flavors.\n\nConsumers drinking less wine, less alcohol\n\nApril 15, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nWhen we began writing this weekly wine column in the 1980s, France was the envy of the wine industry. Not only had their people been making wine longer than the United States, but they were making it better. And, the French coveted their wine like they coveted their cheese. Having a couple of glasses of wine at dinner was commonplace, partly because French tap water was so bad but mostly because wine was ensconced in French culture.\n\nHow times have changed. Americans – and winemakers from other European regions – are making great wine using the same grapes indigenous to France. Moreso, the shine has worn off wine consumption in France. It’s no longer de rigueur.\n\nNo longer is wine given to French kids in canteens as they go to school. Only one in 10 people in France drink a glass of wine every day – a far cry from the 1980s when half of France’s adult population drank wine daily.\n\nThere are many reasons the French are no longer wedded to this custom and the reasons aren’t much different than those cited by Americans.\n\nFirst, the medical community is reversing the conception that wine in moderation improves health. We now read that any consumption of alcohol increases health risks. French President Emmanuel Macron sought to reverse this image when he boasted on television that he drank two glasses of wine a day. He was being supportive of one of his country’s most important economic engines, but French doctors and health advocates were appalled.\n\nNow, 37 percent of the French do not drink wine. Sacre bleu!\n\nSecond, the cost of the best local wine has skyrocketed in France. With demand dropping at a time when production is increasing, producers are dumping grape juice in the streets or turning it into cleaning fluids as the government seeks to stabilize prices.\n\nAlso influencing the decline in wine consumption is a generational change that looks more favorably on craft beer and cocktails – if anything at all. The same is the case in the United States when younger people are no longer enamored with getting drunk.\n\nWine marketers are trying to uplift the industry with confidence that this market trend will change. They are focused on projecting the industry as being environmentally sensitive – and it is. More and more producers have adopted biodynamic and sustainable farming. We are starting to see packaging change as well from the carbon-sapping heavy glass bottles to cardboard and aluminum containers. Still, it’s an uphill struggle now to project wine as a safe, healthy and affordable daily quaff.\n\nWhich brings us to the point that it may not matter for too much longer. Scientists are suggesting that 70 percent of the world’s vineyards may be unsustainable at the end of this century if climate warming continues on its trajectory. Maybe milk will make a comeback.\n\nShopping for wine\n\nFriends and acquaintances often ask us for wine suggestions and we’re hard pressed to answer. We sample wine constantly, dump a lot and find a few to recommend. Unfortunately, we have no idea whether some of our favorite wines are available in their local stores. Most of the gems we discover are not mass produced. So, we tend to recommend labels – Wente for chardonnay, Decoy for almost anything, La Crema for pinot noir, Bogle and J. Lohr for red, Columbia Crest for cabernet sauvignon. These wines are widely available in grocery stores and liquor outlets.\n\nBut we also try to steer people to regions, such as Paso Robles in California, Portugal, Spain, southern France, Sicily and parts of Italy. Even so, wines from even these bargain regions are priced more than $25 a bottle.\n\nFinding a good wine in a sea of labels is a challenge that isn’t likely to change. But don’t despair; the journey is fun. Like champagne but can’t afford it? Try prosecco or a Spanish cava at a fraction of the cost. Mix it with Aperol if you aren’t satisfied with its taste. Like Prisoner and all of its spinoffs but can’t afford them? There are tons of zinfandels from Lodi that will slake your thirst for this jammy quaff. Don’t like to spend big money on prestigious wines but won’t settle for less quality? Drink less, but drink better.\n\nWine picks\n\nDouble Diamond Cabernet Sauvignon 2021 ($90). This is a colossal but approachable wine from Schrader. Aggressive black fruit and cassis aromas with plum and black cherry flavors, hints of tea, earth and vanilla.\n\nMount Langi Ghiran Billi Billi Shiraz 2021 ($16). From Victoria, the fruit for this shiraz produces lively and delicious black berry character with a hint of spice. Simple, yet delicious.\n\nDAOU PATRIMONY 2020 ($300). In our conversations with Daniel Daou, there was never a hesitation in declaring Paso Robles the best region to make wine from Bordeaux’s noble grape varieties. Napa Valley producers disagree, but the Daou brothers are unrelenting with this most expensive luxury wine from Paso Robles. It has continued to score 95-plus scores from critics and old bottles are fetching more than $500 – if you can find one. But let’s not call the 2020 a bargain. It is an excessive luxury few can afford. Using cabernet sauvignon grapes from a few special rows on an exclusive mountain vineyard, the full-bodied wine is aged in custom French barrels to achieve a special richness and complexity. The brothers recently sold the winery to Treasury Wine Estates for $1 billion but remain involved in the winemaking.\n\nM. Chapoutier Belleruche Cotes du Rhone Blanc 2021 ($15-18). Crafted from a blend of classic white Rhone varieties such as roussanne, viognier and grenache blanc. Mineral and peach notes dominate in a very nice easy to drink white wine.\n\nBodega Renacer Punta Final Reserva Cabernet Franc Organic Argentina 2021 ($20-25). This cabernet franc reminded us of a very well-made chinon from the Loire Valley. Ripe berry fruit with a hint of fresh herbs makes for a very interesting and quaffable package.\n\nWine production up, consumption down\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nBy TOM MARQUARDT and PATRICK DARR\n\nMore has been done to study wine drinkers in recent years as producers try hard to introduce the beverage to more consumers. Alas, consumption is down significantly in almost every country, particularly among young people who eschew all alcoholic beverages or who prefer spirits and beer in moderation. Boomers, like us, continue to hold our own because we were around when “60 Minutes” aired its impactful segment on red wine’s benefit to heart health.\n\nRecent studies have darkened the glow that surrounded the boom years in wine consumption, but results vary so much that it is impossible to conclude that wine consumed in moderation is either good or bad. But the projectory of sales year after year shows that the attraction to wine as a health benefit is long gone.\n\nOn top of this decline is a wine glut in Europe that has resulted in an effort to put less wine on the market in hopes of holding prices. In France the government is paying growers to rip up vines; elsewhere, wine or juice is being dumped. For savvy consumers, there are bargains to be found as competition heats up. We’ve read that prices are likely to drop dramatically for the 2023 vintage yet to be released.\n\nThe Wine Market Council did a recent study to assess consumer interest. It found that the glow has worn off the covid binge buying and a tight economy is discouraging discretionary buying. Dining out is more important than a $50 bottle of wine.\n\nOut of the nearly 4,500 U.S. consumers they surveyed, about 34 percent drink wine; 13 percent drink wine exclusively over other alcholic beverages.\n\nAlthough baby boomers command the consumption lead, high-income millennials (now 27 to 42 years old) are a very important target for producers. Wealth has a lot to do with consumption for all age groups – more than half of those surveyed who earn more than $100,000 annually drink wine, but only 15 percent of those earning less than $50,000 annually do so.\n\nScarcity drives prices\n\nWe were listening to a podcast on the power of persuasion the other day and was struck by one of the first elements in convincing someone to buy a product: the principle of scarcity.\n\nIf you have used Amazon before and noticed that an item has “only three left” or if a store salesman said “this is the last one left,” you know the persuasive power of scarcity. Numerous tests have shown that people are driven to buy something if they feel it may not be available if they wait overnight.\n\nIt’s a principle that works in the wine industry just as well.\n\nScreaming Eagle is the poster child, but there are hundreds of wine producers who drive up prices and sales by limiting production. In many cases, there is a waiting period just to lay your hands on a wine that can cost more than $300 a bottle. If they increased production, there would be no scarcity and thus no stampede to their door.\n\nThat was the case with iconic wines like Silver Oak, Caymus and even Dom Perignon whose productions were once small. When popularity encouraged owners – often new and larger owners – to ramp up production, popularity waned. Their collector status gave way to cult wines with smaller productions. We are always stunned to find new wines on the market that sell for well over $100 a bottle when they debut.\n\nWe got an offer from de Negoce, a reseller of wine launched by Cameron Hughes many years ago. The Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon was available from the producer for $195. Hughes was selling it for $27 — he gets the same wine from the producer with the understanding he won’t identify the source.\n\nHe wrote, “The winery bottled their portion and sold us the rest of the blend out of the tank so we have the exact same 100% Cabernet Sauvignon blend as the original bottling.”\n\nIn short, the original producer didn’t want to increase production and reduce the notion of scarcity.\n\nWith sales down, we question whether these cult producers will be able to maintain their lofty price points.\n\nBig Bottles\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law a bill that will allow the purchase of wine in glass containers up to 15 liters. This is surely good news for those of us who want to buy a couple of methuselahs (6 liters) or maybe a family size balthazar (12 liters).\n\nWe assume these large-format bottles were banned earlier out of fear that alcoholics will drop a straw in them and carry on their madness. It was nonesense and we’re happy to see the governor do away with the ban. However, we are puzzled by his comment made at the bill signing.\n\nHe said, “In Florida, we are always looking for ways to reduce regulation and improve our residents’ qualilty of life.”\n\nIt’s a bit of exaggeration to say that a grande-size bottle of wine will improve the quality of life in the Sunshine State.\n\nWine picks\n\nHanna Sauvignon Blanc 2022 ($20). This simple and quaffable wine from the Russian River Valley is a great value. Fresh citrus and pineapple notes.\n\nTenuta Sant’Antonio Monti Garbi Valpolicella Ripasso Superiore 2020 ($23). A great value, this wine is made in the traditional ripasso method with dried grape skins used with fresh grapes in the secondary fermentation. Bright red fruit, medium body and easy to drink. It is aged 12 months in barrel to add complexity. Delicious.\n\nTenuta Sant’Antonio “Antonio Castagnedi” Amaroni della Valpolicella DOCG 2018 ($50). T"
