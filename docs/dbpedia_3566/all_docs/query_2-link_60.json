All rights reserved.\n\nReproduction in whole or part without written permission is prohibited.\n\nThe Tasting Panel was founded by Meridith May and Anthony Dias Blue in 2007.\n\nIN MEMORIAM\n\nAnthony Dias Blue\n\nP:04\n\n4 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nOur magazine isnât called The Tasting Panel for nothing.\n\nThis issue contains not one, not two, but five different columns\n\ndevoted solely to wine and spirits reviewsâwhich donât end\n\nthere: Many features and brand spotlights also include tasting\n\nnotes. In fact, I took the (admittedly obsessive-compulsive) liberty\n\nof counting just how many reviews await you in the pages that\n\nfollow: a grand total of 213, every last one designed to help you\n\nmake informed purchasing decisions, whether youâre a retailer,\n\nan on-premise buyer, or an enthusiastic home consumer.\n\nIn editing them all, senior staff editor Kate Newton and I are\n\nregularly struck by just how different our authorsâ approaches\n\nand styles are. Lead spirits reviewer Virginie Boone is typically\n\nmatter-of-fact (âIt tastes of marmalade on toastâ). Consulting\n\neditor Bob Paulinski, MW, rarely fails to mention the color of a\n\nwine insofar as it provides clues to its character; he also pays\n\nclose attention to structural elements above all (âFull and ripe on\n\nthe palate, with nice intensity and breadth . . . and well-balanced,\n\nround, extended length on the finishâ). Editor-at-large Jonathan\n\nCristaldi tends to take an impressionistic tack (âRed berries,\n\nwild herbs, saline minerals, plum, and nectarine pitâ). And as\n\nfor publisher/editor-in-chief Meridith May, she favors complete\n\nsentences in a lively, even lyrical key (âThis youthful red has\n\ntime yet to show its true colors: Displaying an athletic, angular\n\nstructure, its muscles are still formingâ).\n\nSuch differences arenât just a matter of idiosyncratic phraseology; theyâre also indicative of the fact that the evaluation of the\n\norganoleptic properties of wine and spirits isnât an exact science\n\nbut rather a personalized art. As our VP of education Lars Leicht\n\nhalf-jokingly puts it, âOne sommâs âherbalâ is another sommâs\n\nâherbaceous.â Some find vinous virtue in a can of freshly opened\n\ntennis balls; others donât know their pyrazines from their anise.â\n\nWith that in mind, Leicht will be discussing his own methods of\n\nanalysis as one of four panelists in an upcoming seminar that our\n\nsister publication, The SOMM Journal, is hosting at The Culinary\n\nInstitute of America at Copiaâs Wine & Beverage Summit in May;\n\nfor more information on âTechniques on Tasting,â see page 14.\n\nAll that said, thereâs of course much more to this, and any,\n\nissue than reviews. Take a look at the facing page to step inside a\n\nhistoric Calistoga, California, train depot turned showcase for the\n\nBoisset Collectionâs latest line of luxury spirits. Visit a family who\n\npioneered the planting of Sauvignon Blanc in New Zealandâs now\n\nworld-famous Marlborough region on page 68. And go to page\n\n117 to meet some of the movers and shakers on Philadelphiaâs\n\nflourishing wine scene. After all, when it comes to covering our\n\nindustry, we aim to give you more than just a taste.\n\nletter from the managing editor\n\nPHOTO: JEREMY BALL\n\nA Question of Taste\n\nâOne sommâs âherbalâ is\n\nanother sommâs âherbaceous.â\n\nSome find vinous virtue in a\n\ncan of freshly opened tennis\n\nballs; others donât know their\n\npyrazines from their anise.â\n\nâSOMM Journal VP of education\n\nLars Leicht\n\nP:05\n\nupfront\n\nMARCH/APRIL 2024 ~ THE TASTING PANEL 5\n\nGold rush entrepreneur Sam Brannan was a visionary, a pioneer, and an iconoclast back in the mid-1800s. Brannan, who lived from 1819 to 1889, started San\n\nFranciscoâs first newspaper, The California Star; bought land; built mills and\n\na distillery; and opened a store at John Sutterâs Fort months before gold was\n\nfound. He is said to have wandered through the plaza of San Francisco holding\n\na glass flask filled with glittering specks of gold, proclaiming, âGold! Gold!\n\nGold from the American River!â\n\nIt didnât take long for three-quarters of the townsmen to bolt to seek their\n\nfortunes. Brannan then built his own fortune in the goods business, supplying\n\nminers with pans, picks, shovels, and other essentials; according to John Mack\n\nFaragherâs book, California, Brannan wrote relatives that âwithin the last year, I\n\nhave cleared over 100,000 dollars.â\n\nPHOTOS COURTESY OF BOISSET COLLECTION\n\nSpirits Steeped in\n\nby Virginie Boone\n\nSavoir- Faire\n\nWITH A HISTORY\n\nDATING BACK\n\nTO THE GOLD\n\nRUSH, CALISTOGA\n\nDEPOT DISTILLERY\n\nHEIGHTENS THE\n\nGRANDEUR OF\n\nNAPA VALLEY\n\nThe Calistoga Depot Distillery is a tasting\n\nand events venue in Calistoga, CA.\n\nP:06\n\n6 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nupfront\n\nBy the 1850s, Brannan was the\n\nnew state of Californiaâs richest\n\nman and the first gold-rush\n\nmillionaire. In Napa Valley, he\n\nbought 2,000 acres in and around\n\nwhat is now Calistoga, establishing the town as Sam Brannanâs\n\nHot Springs Resort for wealthy\n\nSan Franciscans. In 1864, he\n\nfounded the Napa Valley Railroad\n\nCompany, with tracks reaching\n\nCalistoga by 1868. (Service lasted\n\nuntil 1929.)\n\nSeeing others around him successfully growing grapes, Brannan\n\nalso bought 20,000 grapevine\n\ncuttings on a trip to Europe in\n\norder to produce brandy that\n\ncritics would call âequal to the\n\nfinest brandies in France.â By the\n\nmid-1860s, some 90,000 gallons\n\nwere being made annually at his\n\nwinery and distillery, likewise in\n\nCalistoga. There, the Calistoga\n\nDepot, the second-oldest train\n\ndepot in Californiaâbuilt, of\n\ncourse, by Brannanâremains a\n\nlegacy of his vision and pluck.\n\nItâs no surprise that vintner\n\nJean-Charles Boisset, an equally\n\nfervent visionary and an appreciator of California history, would\n\nfeel a spiritual connection to\n\nBrannanâs go-big-or-go-home\n\ngumption. A native of Burgundy,\n\nBoisset has spent the past couple\n\nof decades restoring historic Napa\n\nValley and Sonoma Countyâbased\n\nwineries like DeLoach, Buena\n\nVista, and Raymond to grandeur\n\nand creating a myriad of beverage\n\nbrands along the way. In 2017, he\n\nlaunched his first luxury spirits\n\nbrand, JCB Spirits, which includes\n\nstraight as well as caviar- and\n\ntruffle-infused vodkas, gin, and\n\nCognac; the vodka and gin are\n\nmade once a year in Burgundy\n\nfrom Pinot Noir and Chardonnay\n\ngrapes grown in the CÃ´te dâOr.\n\nFollowing his purchase of the\n\nlandmark Calistoga Depot in 2021,\n\nBoisset is now delving deliberately\n\nand thoroughly into the grand\n\nworld of California-made spirits\n\nThough not a working distillery, the Calistoga Depot Distillery does have a\n\nstill on display.\n\nTasting Notes\n\nThe Calistoga Star Barrel Aged Fine Brandy,\n\nUSA ($75) Sixty percent of this distillate of\n\nChardonnay, French Colombard, Grenache,\n\nMuscat, and Symphony grapes is column\n\ndistilled and aged in used, charred American\n\nwhite oak; the remaining 40% is alembic\n\ndistilled and aged in French oak wine casks. Itâs\n\nthen cellared for a minimum of seven and up to\n\n15 years. Rich in baking spice and plum, it has\n\nlovely notes of oak and caramel that finish with\n\norange zest. 85 proof. 95\n\nThe Calistoga Star Barrel Aged XO Fine\n\nBrandy, USA ($125) Made from a distillate\n\nof Barbera and Ugni Blanc grapes, this is a\n\ncombination of 40% column-distilled brandy\n\naged in used, charred American white oak and\n\n60% alembic-distilled brandy aged in French\n\noak wine casks thatâs cellared for a minimum\n\nof ten and up to 20 years. Opening with vanilla,\n\nnutmeg, and citrus, it is lush and luxurious\n\non the palate, flecked with dark roast coffee,\n\nnutmeg, and baked fig. 83 proof. 96\n\nThe First Millionaire American Barley Whisky,\n\nUSA ($75) Made from 100% malted barley and\n\naged four years in ex-wine casks from Napa\n\nValley, this opens with aromas of apple pie\n\ndusted in cinnamon and brown sugar, with\n\nsecondary notes of clove and toasted oak. 90\n\nproof. 93\n\nThe First Millionaire Sacramento Single Malt\n\nWhisky, USA ($125) From 100% malted barley\n\ngrown in Sacramento, this is aged in (100%\n\nnew) charred American white-oak wine casks.\n\nIt opens with strong aromas of butterscotch,\n\nbrioche, and roasted chestnut and finishes with\n\ndark chocolate and pecan pie. 93 proof. 95\n\nFame & Misfortune Cask Strength Rye Whiskey,\n\nUSA ($200) Produced in partnership with\n\nmaster distiller Ashby Marshall of SpiritWorks\n\nDistilling, this expression is made from 65%\n\norganic rye and 35% malted grains and aged for\n\nseven years in new charred American white-oak\n\ncasks; it has characteristics of black pepper,\n\nclove, and toasted oak and a lingering layer of\n\ncardamom and baking spice. 121 proof. 98\n\nFame & Misfortune Straight Rye Whiskey\n\nFinished in Angelica Casks, USA ($150) Made in\n\npartnership with master distiller Ashby Marshall\n\nof SpiritWorks Distilling, this contains 65%\n\norganic rye and 35% malted grains and aged for\n\nseven years in new charred American white oak\n\nbefore finishing for seven months in French oak\n\ncasks previously used for Angelica, a dessert\n\nwine made specifically for Buena Vista Winery. It\n\ntastes of marmalade on toast. 90 proof. 95\n\nP:07\n\nMARCH/APRIL 2024 ~ THE TASTING PANEL 7\n\nas he launches the Calistoga Depot\n\nDistillery Spirits Portfolio in partnership with master distillers and\n\nblenders. This selection of brands,\n\noverseen by regional directors of\n\nspirits sales Anthony Attanasio and\n\nGigi Summers as well as brand\n\nmanager Ginelle Cloar, will be\n\nserved and sold at the Depot and\n\ndistributed in limited quantities\n\nto restaurant and retail accounts\n\nnationwide, starting with focused\n\nlaunches in California and Texas.\n\nThe core of the portfolio consists\n\nof The Calistoga Star California\n\nbrandy; The First Millionaire\n\nwhiskys; Fame & Misfortune ryes,\n\nso named in honor of Brannanâs\n\ntroublesome paramour and a\n\ncolorful character in California history, Lola Montez; and Prosperous\n\n& Penniless bourbon, rye, and\n\nbarrel-finished gin, whose name\n\nis a nod to the fact that, for all his\n\nsuccess, Brannan died destitute,\n\nunable to afford his own funeral.\n\nBoissetâs background in wine\n\nis informing his vision of the\n\ndistillation and aging process for\n\nthese spirits. For instance, his\n\nbrandies are made with his wines,\n\nwhile French and American oak\n\nbarrels that once held his wines\n\nare employed for finishing each of\n\nthe brandsâ products, a signature\n\napproach intended to impart\n\nrichness, a lush mouthfeel, and\n\nrefined notes of vanilla and warm\n\nbaking spices.\n\nThe Calistoga Depot Distillery\n\nSpirits Portfolio is showcased\n\nin the high-ceilinged, grandly\n\nrefashioned space for which itâs\n\nnamed. Set on Lincoln Avenue,\n\nCalistogaâs main drag, the Depot\n\nnow serves as a venue for guided\n\ntastings, creative cocktails, and\n\nevents. (Though not actually a\n\ndistilleryâall the brands are\n\nproduced off-siteâit does boast\n\na still on display.) Meanwhile,\n\nseveral distinct areas have been\n\ncreated to enjoy Boissetâs wines,\n\nother spirits, and luxuriesâsome\n\nof them within actual 1800s-era rail\n\ncars. These include the JCB Parlor,\n\nserving sparkling wine and caviar;\n\nThe First Millionairesâ Saloon,\n\nfeaturing brown spirits and a\n\nperiod-specific poker table; and\n\nthe Casa Obsidiana car, honoring\n\nMexican heritage and cuisine as it\n\nhighlights a related Boisset project,\n\nCasa Obsidiana Tequila.\n\nWhile marking distinguished\n\nmoments in Sam Brannanâs storied\n\nlife, the Calistoga Depot Distillery\n\nSpirits Portfolio is imbued with\n\nBoissetâs own savoir-faire.\n\nFame & Misfortune Straight Rye Whiskey\n\nFinished in Port Casks, USA ($150) In partnership with master distiller Ashby Marshall of\n\nSpiritWorks Distilling, this combination of\n\n65% organic rye and 35% malted grains aged\n\nfor seven years in new charred American\n\nwhite oak and finished for seven months in\n\nBuena Vista Port casks. The Port influence is\n\nstrong, lending flavors of dark roast coffee,\n\ndark chocolate, baking spice, and fruitcake. 96\n\nproof. 94\n\nFame & Misfortune Straight Rye Whiskey\n\nFinished in Cream Sherry Casks, USA ($150)\n\nIn partnership with master distiller Ashby\n\nMarshall of SpiritWorks Distilling, this blend\n\nof 65% organic rye and 35% malted grains\n\naged for seven years in new charred American\n\nwhite oak, then finished for seven months\n\nin Buena Vista Cream Sherry casks. Creamy,\n\ncaramel-rich, and lush on the palate, it exudes\n\nmarzipan and blackberry pie. 93 proof. 96\n\nProsperous & Penniless Bourbon Whiskey,\n\nUSA ($250) Made by master distiller Crispin\n\nCain from 65% corn, 20% malted barley,\n\nand 15% malted rye, this sees six years in\n\nbourbon barrels from Missouri before itâs\n\nfinished in French oak casks that previously\n\nheld Cabernet Sauvignon from Buena Vista\n\nWinery. Vanilla and butterscotch rise to the\n\nfore, with subtler undertones of baking spice\n\nand blood orange becoming more prominent\n\nover time. 92.2 proof. 97\n\nProsperous & Penniless Rye Malt Whiskey,\n\nUSA ($300) Made by master distiller Crispin\n\nCain from 93% malted rye and 7% malted\n\nwheat, this is aged 24â30 months in new\n\nbourbon barrels; itâs then transferred to\n\nused Cognac barrels made of Limousin oak\n\nand finished in used Buena Vista Cabernet\n\nSauvignon barrels for an average of ten\n\nyears.

In a reveal thatâs perhaps\n\nunsurprising given the reputations\n\nand experience of the group, which is\n\nself-funded, he insists that something\n\nâdisruptiveâ is in the works. â[Thatâs]\n\na word thatâs thrown around a lot,â\n\nApplbaum offered. âItâs in the same\n\nvein as âinnovationâ or âcraftâ or âsmall\n\nbatch.ââ But it has special meaning\n\nfor Applbaum. âWhen we launch, we\n\nintend for consumers and trade to say,\n\nâI canât believe no one is doing this.â But\n\ndisrupti[on] is more than innovation;\n\nitâs not about simply coming up with a\n\ndifferent flavor. A blue and red car is\n\nnot an innovation of a white car.â When\n\npressed to divulge more information on\n\nthe launch, Applbaum pulled back but\n\nquickly explained, âIt wonât be hyperniche or a flash-in-the-pan concept but\n\nsomething [that will allow us] to build a\n\nlong-term trend.â\n\nAfter PatrÃ³n was sold, Applbaum\n\nand his fellow industry captains were\n\ndetermined to not only remain friends\n\nbut work together again. âIt wasnât\n\nabout just starting a new company,â\n\nhe said, âbut to find the right reason\n\nfor doing so. And after five or so years\n\n[since] the sale, we all still love the\n\n[spirits] category, and believe we are\n\ndevoted students of it as well.â With\n\nthe marketing, distribution, and sales\n\nmuscle behind Round 2 Spirits, they\n\nhave the ability to once again ignite the\n\nmarket, as John Paul DeJoria did when\n\nhe introduced PatrÃ³n in 1989. âWe donât\n\njust want to fill shelf space,â Applbaum\n\nremarked. âWe are introducing a bottle\n\nthat will create another occasion, an\n\nalternative way to think about the\n\ncategory. Itâs less about the competitive\n\nside of the business and more about a\n\nmeaningful splash.â\n\nEven when a product entering the\n\nmarketplace is tremendously received\n\nby consumers and trade, all too often\n\nits production is low or its creators\n\nare either not well-backed financially\n\nor just not experienced enough to\n\nkeep the wheels turning for sales and\n\ndistribution. Applbaum insists that\n\nRound 2âs brands are pursuing scale\n\nin large, established categories: âWe\n\nare producing something meaningfully\n\ninnovative; we are not going to exist in\n\na sea of sameness.â\n\nâA Meaningful Splashâ\n\nINTRODUCING ROUND 2 SPIRITS\n\nby Meridith May\n\nMeet the Round\n\n2 Team\n\nJohn Paul\n\nDeJoria, the selfmade billionaire\n\nfounder of PatrÃ³n\n\nTequila and Paul\n\nMitchell hair care.\n\nChairman and\n\nCEO Ed Brown,\n\nthe former\n\nCEO of PatrÃ³n\n\nSpirits who was\n\nresponsible for\n\nthe brandâs $5.1-billion acquisition in 2018 by Bacardi Limited.\n\nPresident and\n\nchief operating\n\nofficer Lee\n\nApplbaum,\n\nformer chief\n\nmarketing officer\n\nof PatrÃ³n Tequila and Grey\n\nGoose Vodka.\n\nChief commercial\n\nofficer Brad\n\nVassar, who\n\nserved as COO\n\nof Southern\n\nGlazerâs Wine &\n\nSpirits for 15 years.\n\nChief strategy\n\nofficer Dave\n\nWilson, formerly\n\npresident international and COO\n\nof PatrÃ³n Spirits.\n\nP:13\n\nJULIANE SCHMITT\n\n5th Generation Family Vintner,\n\nSchmitt SÃ¶hne Family Wines\n\nGERMAN\n\nWINEMAKING\n\nTRADITION\n\nOV E R 1 0 0 Y EA R S\n\nO F\n\nA\n\nWA R D - W I N N I N G\n\nW I N\n\nE\n\nS\n\n1919\n\nE ST.\n\nAMERICAâS #1IMPORTED\n\nRIESLING BRAND\n\nÂ©2024 Schmitt Sohne USA | schmittfamilywines.com | Enjoy Responsibly | All Rights Reserved | Source: IRI Total MULO + C, $8-$10.99 Imported Riesling, 52 weeks ending 11/5/23\n\nP:14\n\n14 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nindustry spotlight\n\nThe SOMM Journal Places a\n\nFocus on Tasting at the CIA\n\nWine & Beverage Summit\n\nThe five Sâs. The grid. The 100-point scale. Each has its benefits and devotees, but\n\ncan something as subjective as wine evaluation truly be standardized? To find\n\nout, our sister publication, The SOMM Journal, has assembled a panel of professionals with varying backgrounds and perspectives to discuss their approach\n\nto tasting, evaluating, and discussing wine in a panel titled âTechniques on\n\nTastingâ at 11:15 a.m. on Monday, May 6, at The Culinary Institute of America at\n\nCopiaâs Wine & Beverage Summit, set for May 5â7 in Napa, California. For more\n\ninformation, including how to register, visit ciabevpro.com.\n\nHereâs our panel:\n\nGabriele Gorelli became Italyâs first Master of Wine in 2001. He got an early start,\n\nhoning techniques as a young boy at his grandfatherâs winery in Montalcino.\n\nWhen he was sitting for the tasting portion of the exam, the first wine fittingly\n\nturned out to be a Brunello di Montalcino; he instantly recognized it but\n\ndoubted himself because it seemed too easy. âThat is when I realized that one\n\ntruly does have two brain systems,â he observed: one that works on instinct\n\nand another that makes you second guess. Learning to master the two is what\n\nearned him both the MW title on his second attempt and his current roles as\n\nworldwide faculty ambassador for Fondazione Banfi and brand ambassador\n\nfor Vinventions.\n\nJacob Gragg became an Advanced Sommelier in the Court of\n\nMaster Sommeliers at 24, making him one of the youngest to\n\nachieve this certification. He grew up working in the kitchens\n\nof family restaurants, surrounded by aromas and flavors that\n\nwould become sensory reference points. He was a sommelier\n\nat Aria in Atlanta and The Georgian Room at the Cloister in Sea\n\nIsland, Georgia, and is a certified specialist of both wines and\n\nspirits with the Society of Wine Educators. Founding president\n\nof the Southeastern Sommelier Society, he now serves as Caâ\n\ndel Bosco and portfolio fine wine specialist at Santa Margherita USA.\n\nBernard Sun has over two decades of sommelier experience, including ten years\n\nas corporate beverage director for the Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant\n\ngroup, for which he built and managed Michelin-starred and James Beard\n\nAwardâwinning wine lists from Shanghai to Paris; additionally, his work at top\n\nrestaurants in New York includes five years at Lespinasse, two years at Le Cirque\n\n2000, and five years as head sommelier at Montrachet. He has also made wine in\n\nNapa, Bergerac, and the Willamette Valley under his own label. Today, as luxury\n\naccounts manager for Kobrand, he supports a fine wine portfolio that includes\n\ntop names from Champagne, Burgundy, Alsace, and Tuscany.\n\nLars Leichtâs 38 years in the wine world have included roles in\n\nsales, marketing, and communications. He has guided scores\n\nof scribes, enophiles, and professionals through vineyards\n\nand wineries around the globe and keeps his own hand in\n\nthe fermenter as an amateur home winemaker. Founder\n\nand de facto âdeanâ of Cru Artisan College, he is now The\n\nSOMM Journalâs go-to moderator for webinars, seminars,\n\nand exceptional tastings.\n\nLeading Italian\n\nEnologist Ezio\n\nRivella Dies at 90\n\nEzio Rivella, one of Italyâs leading\n\nenology consultants and former managing director of the Castello Banfi\n\nestate and winery in Montalcino, died\n\nin Rome on January 17 at 90. A native\n\nof Castagnole delle Lanze in the\n\nprovince of Asti in Piemonte, he was a\n\nlongtime consultant to U.S. importer\n\nBanfi Vintners and is considered one\n\nof the fathers of contemporary Italian\n\nwinemaking.\n\nTogether with Banfi proprietors\n\nJohn and Harry Mariani, Rivella is\n\ncredited with raising Italian winemaking standards and bringing Brunello\n\ndi Montalcino to world renown.\n\nHe held many important positions,\n\nincluding stints as president of\n\nAssoenologi, an Italian association\n\nof enologists, from 1975 to 1986;\n\nAssociazione Enologi Enotecnici\n\nItaliani, the Italian wine techniciansâ\n\nassociation; Comitato Nazionale\n\nVini DOP, which oversees Italyâs\n\nwinemaking denominations under\n\nthe countryâs minister of agriculture,\n\nfrom 1993 to 1998; and the Consorzio\n\ndel Vino Brunello di Montalcino from\n\n2010 to 2012. He was also the first\n\nItalian to lead the Confederazione\n\nItaliana della Vite e del Vino and\n\nserved as vice president of the Office\n\nInternational de la Vigne et du Vin\n\nin Paris.

Every time I have a serious encounter with sakÃ©, I am humbled by its\n\nnuance; a defining yet little-known production technique; or a passionate\n\nprofessional who is equally enthralled with the beverage.\n\nThe highest-quality sakÃ©s are typically brewed during the winter months,\n\nso December was a fitting time for Morgan Harris, head sommelier at San\n\nFrancisco restaurant Angler, to curate a pairing menu that celebrated the\n\naffinity between seafood and sakÃ© in collaboration with the Japan Food\n\nProduct Overseas Promotion Center (JFOODO). Available through January,\n\nâSeafood Meets SakÃ©â included five courses, one of which featured handdived scallops with vermouth butter accompanied by 2021 Akishika Yama\n\nJunmai Genshu from Osaka.\n\nYama refers to Yamahai, a traditional brewing method that relies on\n\nnaturally occurring lactic acid to produce sakÃ© that isÂ characteristically\n\nearthy, with higher acidity and a dry finish. Junmai (pure rice) was used, and\n\nthe finished sake was undiluted (genshu), which resulted in a dry, full-bodied\n\nexpression with pronounced acidity and stone-fruit flavors.\n\nHarris places a particular emphasis on sourcing organic and biodynamic\n\n(junkan) products for the beverage list at Angler and found exactly what he\n\nwas looking for in the Akishika Brewery, which is located in the mountains\n\nbetween Kyoto and Osaka in Japanâs Kansai region. Here, sixth-generation\n\nbrewer Oka Hiroaki has pioneered new methods of composting and flooding\n\nthe fields to biodynamically farm 25 hectares of Yamadanishiki rice.\n\nThe Season of SakÃ©\n\nREFLECTIONS ON THE ART OF âLIQUID UMAMIâ\n\nPABU, an izakaya and sushi bar by Michael Mina and Ken Tominaga in San\n\nFranciscoâs Financial District, serves a bespoke sakÃ©, Kurozaemon Daiginjo\n\nfrom the Yamagata Prefecture, thatâs crafted by the restaurantâs own\n\nresident sakÃ© sommelier, Stuart Morris.\n\nWhen I met Morris during a memorable sakÃ©-paired dinner at PABU, I\n\nrecalled attending in 2014 the annual SakÃ© Sommelier examinations held\n\nby SSI International, a Tokyo-based trade-certification body established\n\nin 1991. SSI awards beginning (nihonsyu), intermediate (kikisake-shi), and\n\nadvanced (master or sakasho) certifications in sakÃ© expertise. Morris, who\n\nis fluent in Japanese and passed the kikisake-shi level in 2009, is a brewer in\n\nhis own right. During the winter months, he travels to Yamagata to make\n\nthe PABU Kurozaemon Daiginjo with Masanobu Shindo, the master brewer\n\nat the 150-year-old Shindo Shuzo brewery. âI first met Shindo-san when\n\nhe came to the restaurant for dinner and we began talking about sakÃ©. It\n\ntook some persistence, but he eventually agreed to let me make sakÃ© at his\n\nbrewery. Itâs a tremendous honor to work under his guidance and with his\n\nteam,â says Morris.\n\nDaiginjo means âbig ginjoâ and represents the highest polish for the rice\n\nused in sakÃ© production (50%). Kurozaemon, which has bright aromas and\n\nsoft, lifted notes of Granny Smith apple and fennel pollen, is just one of\n\nhundreds of premium and super-premium sakÃ©s Morris carries at PABU.\n\nBrewer and kikisake-shi Stuart Morris crafts a bespoke sakÃ© for PABU.\n\nAngler head sommelier Morgan Harris is\n\npassionate about single-estate sakÃ©s that\n\nare produced using organic and biodynamic\n\nmethods.\n\nPHOTO: ADAHLIA COLE AND COLIN PECK\n\nPHOTO COURTESY OF MINA GROUP\n\nP:18\n\nAfter my boyfriend and I ducked out\n\nof the heavy rain and were escorted\n\nto our seats at Amparo Fondita in\n\nDupont Circle, our server apologized\n\nfor the nasty weather responsible for\n\nkeeping guests away that night. As\n\nwe quickly discovered, though, the\n\nrestaurantâs menu of modern Mexican\n\ndrinks and dishes more than made up\n\nfor empty tables and limited access to\n\npeople-watching.\n\nAmparo, which is Spanish for âshelter,â is also the name of the mother and\n\ngrandmother of chef Christian IrabiÃ©n,\n\na Chihuahua native. As we sipped\n\nsmoky Mezcal Negronis with locally\n\nmade Capitoline RosÃ© Vermouth,\n\nIrabiÃ©n delivered a tower of oysters\n\non the half shell accompanied by a riff\n\non mignonette made with lime juice,\n\nMaggi sauce, serrano chiles, and shallots as well as gulf shrimp with cocktail\n\nsauce that mixed chile de Ã¡rbol, garlic,\n\nvinegar, lime, and Mexican oregano.\n\nWe were off to a fabulous start.\n\nWe moved on to a round of\n\nEspirituosos. The refreshing and\n\nfragrant concoction of gin, aloe\n\nvera, lemongrass, and hoja santa\n\nleavesâwhich lent a piquant note of\n\neucalyptusâpaired swimmingly with\n\na crispy, guacamole-slathered tostada\n\ntopped with rosettes of thinly sliced,\n\ncitrus-cured Arctic char; frizzled leeks;\n\nand salsa macha, a spicy and nutty\n\nsauce native to the Veracruz region.Â Â\n\nBut tacos are the star here. IrabiÃ©n\n\nstuffs heirloom Mexican corn tortillas\n\nwith everything from braised lamb to\n\nachiote pork shoulder; we opted for\n\nchapulines, which were flambÃ©ed with\n\nmezcal and served with tomatillo, chile\n\nde Ã¡rbol, and guacamole. The result\n\nwas so crunchy, nutty, and satisfying that it could have won over any\n\nentomophobe.Â\n\nTo accompany two more dishesâ\n\ngrilled, head-on jumbo prawns\n\nwith pickled peppers and grilled\n\npineapple and lamb barbacoa rubbed\n\nwith chocolate and dry chile moleâwe\n\nturned to the small wine list, where\n\nMexico is represented by a crisp and\n\npleasant Sauvignon Blanc from Valle\n\nde Guadalupe and a light-bodied\n\nSangiovese from Guanajuato. We\n\nlingered over our glasses to stave off\n\nthe inevitable exit into the cold,\n\nwet night.\n\nOn another evening that was fortunately crisp and clear, I caught up with\n\na travel-writer friend over drinks at a\n\nnew cocktail bar, Medina, from Rose\n\nPrevite, who also owns Maydan across\n\nthe alley as well as Compass Rose.\n\nNamed for the old walled sections of\n\nancient cities in North Africa, the cozy\n\nlounge transports guests to Tunis,\n\nMarrakech, and Fez via a tapestrytented ceiling; intricate, gilded hanging\n\nlanterns; and plush sofas.\n\nWhen I arrived, my thirsty companion\n\nwas already sipping the Caspian Sea: an\n\nherbal, fragrant, delicate creation that\n\nhas to be the best drink on the menu.\n\nMenorcan gin is stirred with grapefruit\n\nliqueur, thyme, rosemary, bay leaf, and\n\nvermouth and adorned with âcaviarâ\n\nmade from pomegranate juice and\n\nCampari, which burst in my mouth for\n\na tangy, bitter effect. (I caught up with\n\nhim by ordering the Hold the Tonic, a\n\nmildly carbonated take on a G&T with\n\nGreen Chartreuse, cucumber-basil\n\ncordial, lime-leaf bitters, and lemon.)\n\nBeyond tagines and shareable plates\n\nlike tomato-eggplant dip and roasted\n\nbeets with tahini, Martinis mixed tableside are a big draw here. When our\n\nserver arrived with a gold cart stocked\n\nwith booze, ice, and accoutrements,\n\nour first step was to select Moroccan\n\nolive oilâinfused gin or vodka and the\n\namount of vermouth; as purists, we\n\nopted for the former, stirred 3:1. We\n\ncouldnât choose just one garnish, so a\n\nCastelvetrano olive, a sumac-pickled\n\nonion, an applewood-smoked olive,\n\nand lemon zest were all fed onto a\n\nmetal pick and set upon our glasses.\n\nOur server told us that Medina is\n\nmeant for pre-dinner cocktails and\n\nnibbles before dining across the alley\n\nat Maydan. Be warned, though: Once\n\nyou settle into your seats here, you\n\nmay decide to cancel your dinner\n\nreservation.\n\nSpice Trade\n\nA MIDDLE EASTERNâINSPIRED COCKTAIL BAR AND A CONTEMPORARY MEXICAN\n\nRESTAURANT ARE TAKING D.C.

In the United States, the\n\norigins of creating a womenâs day date\n\nback to 1978, when various womenâs\n\ngroups and historians lobbied for a\n\nnational Womenâs History Week. Their\n\nwork paid off two years later, when\n\nPresident Carter issued a proclamation declaring the week of March 2â8,\n\n1980, as National Womenâs History\n\nWeek. After being petitioned in 1987,\n\nCongress and President Reagan\n\nin turn proclaimed the month of\n\nMarch as Womenâs History Month to\n\nhonor the achievements of American\n\nwomen.Â While I am proud to carry on\n\nthis legacy by celebrating and cheering\n\non the ladies working in the beverage\n\nalcohol space, we still have work to do\n\nto make this industry more inclusive\n\nfor womenâand in my career, I have\n\nfound that creating positive change is\n\nthe right thing to do.Â\n\nA 2023 Deloitte DEI Institute study\n\nnoted that âonly one in ten women\n\nworking in the beverage alcohol\n\nindustry believes there has been a significant positive change [in the attitude]\n\ntoward women overall in the last five\n\nyears.âÂ While there has been progress,\n\nwe need to continue to come together to\n\ninitiate change across the board, from\n\nthe on- and off-premise channels to the\n\nproduction sector. When you help those\n\naround you to feel a sense of belonging\n\nby including them in various ways and\n\nencouraging them to use their voices,\n\nyou inevitably cultivate a happier staff\n\nwho are more committed to their\n\ntasks and more prepared for both new\n\nresponsibilities and new opportunities.\n\nHaving healthy conversations on every\n\ntopic from work-life balance to salary\n\nnegotiation can help shape the future\n\nof women in our business.

Both its\n\ncocktail menu and its meticulously\n\ncurated spirits collection bridge the gap\n\nbetween past and present, providing a\n\nchronicle of bygone eras while cultivating an ethos of innovation and a passion for craft under general manager\n\nBrian Bounds and spirits librarian Ben\n\nRobinette. Explains Robinette, âThere\n\nis an aspect of physical and cultural\n\npreservation that we in our mission at\n\nKinfolk are keen to articulate. . . . The\n\ndissemination of knowledge is one of\n\nthe pillars on which we were founded.â\n\nIn 1854, German immigrant Henry\n\nHofheintz constructed a two-story\n\nbuilding from locally sourced limestone\n\nand pine, opening a store on the\n\nground floor and using the second as\n\na residence. Eventually, his daughter,\n\nCatherine, and son-in-law, Adolf\n\nReissig, expanded the structure, adding\n\na domino parlor and a saloon with a root\n\ncellar. Reissig made wine from Mustang\n\ngrapes grown on the property in this\n\ncellar, which also functioned as a speakeasy during Prohibition. âThis [space]\n\nis important [in] establishing a thread\n\nof caregiving and of beverages being\n\na prevalent force, [which is] markedly\n\nimportant to us [as] we close that loop\n\nnearly a century later,â says Robinette.\n\nLarry Perdido and Chuck Smith, two\n\nco-founders of Hopdoddy Burger Bar,\n\nopened Moonshine Grill, a restaurant\n\nspecializing in Southern comfort food,\n\nin the former saloon in 2003. They,\n\nalong with Moonshineâs director of\n\noperations, Joe Nguyen, envisioned\n\nKinfolk as an opportunity to build on\n\nthe restaurantâs remarkable selection of\n\nwhiskeys, taking a broader approach\n\nto the world of spirits. This vision\n\npaved the way for a dynamic cocktail\n\nprogram celebrating the flavors\n\nand traditions of diverse categories,\n\nincluding fortified wines. To date,\n\nKinfolk boasts an impressive collection\n\nof 861 unique bottles, Robinette says,\n\nadding, âWe do not treat the library as\n\nseparate from the cocktail operations;\n\nevery bottle is available for creative\n\ncomposition.â\n\nThe design of the cocktail menu,\n\ncrafted by former curator of spirits Tom\n\nKoerner, is inspired by a family tree,\n\nrepresenting three âgenerationsâ of\n\ndrinksâancestral, classic, and modernâin six âfamiliesâ: Fancy Drinks,\n\nSours, Bucks, Old Fashioneds, Daisies,\n\nand Fizzes. The ancestral section showcases the âmotherâ cocktails; the classic\n\nsection includes well-known variations;\n\nand the modern section features\n\ncontemporary creations. Some guests,\n\naccording to Bounds, âwant to discover\n\nthe entire family,â for instance by starting with an Old Fashioned, progressing\n\nto a classic descendant like the Sazerac,\n\nand ending with a new interpretation\n\nsuch as the San Miguel, featuring\n\nguestsâ choice of agave spirit, turbinado\n\nsyrup, celery and grapefruit bitters, and\n\ngrapefruit oil. Others, he adds, âjust put\n\n[their order] into our hands, which I\n\nusually highly recommend.â\n\nEither way, âit always yields a meaningful exchange and, [as] Ben likes\n\nto say, a cultural expansion,â Bounds\n\ncontinues. âItâs a conversation; every\n\n[customer] gets special attention and\n\nperhaps learns something new, and I\n\ncan confidently say many of our guests\n\nsay theyâve had the best cocktail theyâve\n\never tasted.â\n\nRooted in History\n\nKINFOLK LOUNGE & LIBRARY FINDS ITS NICHE\n\nIN AN AUSTIN, TX, LANDMARK\n\nKinfolkâs Brandy Crusta.\n\nGeneral manager Brian Bounds and spirits librarian Ben Robinette.\n\nPHOTO: MATT LANKES\n\nPHOTO: ANNIE RAY PHOTOGRAPHY\n\nP:24\n\n24 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nPHOTO: KYLENE WHITE\n\nIn my January/February 2024 column,\n\nI discussed best practices for establishing relationships with new accounts,\n\ndetailing how to get your foot in the\n\ndoor, the importance of focusing on\n\npartnerships rather than transactions,\n\nand methods for making a meaningful\n\nconnection with buyers.\n\nIf youâve successfully established\n\na new relationship with a buyer or\n\naccount, consider that to be both the\n\nfinish line of a sprint and the starting\n\nline of a marathon. Now that the buyer\n\nis receptive to you, itâs important to\n\nmaintain that relationship in a way\n\nthat benefits both your bottom line\n\nand theirs.\n\nFirst, letâs address the elephant in the\n\nroom. Buyers can be (and unfortunately\n\noften are) dismissive, disinterested, and\n\ndisconnected. Theyâre the product of\n\nan industry that for decades has put\n\nthem on pedestals and thrown copious amounts of money at them either\n\ndirectly or in the form of benefits like\n\ntrips, meals, bottles, events, and so\n\nforth. It can be downright disheartening\n\nto interact with ârock starâ somms who\n\nmight not realize or appreciate how\n\nmuch thankless work suppliers must\n\ndo in order to secure and safeguard a\n\nplacement. But donât be discouraged:\n\nWhether the buyer is cooperative or\n\nstandoffish, there are a few tried-andtrue tactics for creating and maintaining\n\nmeaningful long-term relationships.\n\nCommunication, Accuracy,\n\nand Follow-Through\n\nThese three elements form the critical\n\nfoundation on which a successful\n\nrelationship can be built. Ideally, all\n\nthree are always in place, but as long as\n\nat least two are intact, the relationship\n\nwill survive. For instance, communicating an order as received and ensuring\n\nit is delivered accurately requires no\n\nfurther follow-through. However, if\n\naccuracy was compromised and the\n\ncorrect wine failed to be delivered,\n\nthings can still work out provided communication and follow-through happen\n\nto correct the issue.\n\nBe Direct\n\nYouâd be amazed what you can accomplish by simply asking buyers what\n\nthey are looking for, if thereâs any way\n\nyou can make things easier for them,\n\nand if they are happy with the status\n\nquo or if thereâs room for a change. Be\n\nhonest about the fact that your job is\n\nbased on them supporting your brands\n\nand ask how you can best present your\n\nproducts or gain opportunities in their\n\nprograms. Demonstrating that they\n\ncan benefit from doing business with\n\nyouâespecially if you can save them\n\ntime (no buyer has enough), make them\n\nmore money (most buyers arenât good\n\nwith the financial side of things), or\n\nmake their guests happier (the ultimate\n\ngoal)âgains you both trust and\n\npreferred status. With that, you may\n\neven be able to ask for an occasional\n\nfavor: Many times in my career Iâve\n\nbought more product than I needed\n\nin a given period to help a preferred\n\npartner achieve a sales goal or quota. If\n\nsuch asks are few and far between and\n\ncan benefit the buyerâs program to boot\n\n(via quantity discounts, for example),\n\nthen everybody wins.\n\nProtect Continuity\n\nThere is nothing more frustrating than\n\ntrying to reorder a wine (especially a\n\nglass pour) only to find itâs out of stock\n\nor thereâs been a surprise vintage\n\nchange. Itâs imperative that you as the\n\nsupplier protect continuity of placements. This means planning ahead\n\nwith your buyers and letting them\n\nknow youâll secure the appropriate\n\nquantity of inventory if at all possible.\n\nThis is of course a two-way street, and\n\nthe buyer needs to be reasonable and\n\nhonest about run rates as well as to\n\nactually purchase the wines to which\n\nthey commit. When vintage changes are\n\nimminent, get out in front of that so the\n\nbuyer has plenty of time to prepare, edit,\n\nand reprint menus as needed. Thereâs\n\nnothing worse than being chastised by a\n\nguest who is complaining that the wine\n\nthey ordered is out of stock or a different vintage than was indicated in print.\n\nThe aforementioned is by no means\n\nan exhaustive list, but these tactics are\n\ncritical to maintaining relationships with\n\nyour buyers to the benefit of all parties.\n\nLearning the Language\n\nof Buyers, Part 2\n\nMAINTAINING RELATIONSHIPS FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT\n\nP:25\n\nCOPYRIGHT Â© 2024 SPIRIT OF GALLO.

At the moment it looks like Iâm\n\nrounding out at about 50 dessert wines, with most of them\n\nbeing heavily focused around Tuscanyâwe are a Tuscan\n\nsteakhouse. But thereâs certainly a nod to the reciotos and\n\nsome of the sweet wines from the north, [like] Picolit and\n\npassito-style Moscato. And in terms of grappa, Iâve been\n\nable to collect about 35 to 40 so far. Itâs been fun. I basically\n\njust ask every [sales rep], âHey, do they make a grappa too?\n\nSend one.â Itâs been really fun to taste through them and\n\nsee how theyâre different and nuanced.\n\nI think the easiest way to sell dessert wines and digestifs\n\nis to give them some context and tell a story around them.\n\nGuests donât really understand why they should have those\n\nthings, so Iâve made it a point to carry wines, Vin Santos,\n\nand grappas from the same producer. For example, a guest\n\ncan order Villa Calcinaiaâs really delicious white blend,\n\nComitale, to get their meal started. They can then move\n\ninto, say, [Calcinaiaâs] Chianti Classico Gran Selezione to\n\ngo with meats and heartier courses. And then youâre able\n\nto approach the table again and say, âListen, I understand\n\nthat youâre enjoying this wineryâs Chianti with dinner. They\n\nmake a really fabulous Vin Santo.â You can start to tell that\n\nstory: âWhatâs a Vin Santo?â You let them know that itâs a\n\nreally traditional style of making sweet wine in the region\n\nand that almost all producers make their own and [then]\n\nsay, âThis oneâs really special. l I think youâd enjoy it with\n\nyour dessert course.â And to take it even a step further, âI\n\nalso have the grappa that they make.â Just to be able to\n\ngive some context and approach tables with a story is, I\n\nthink, really important.\n\nOur spirits director, whom I work very closely with, is\n\nkind of doing the same thing. [For instance,] weâre taking\n\nthese grappas and weâre incorporating them into our\n\nhouse Martini. Itâs called The Tre, and it has three ingredients: Italian gin, grappa, and vermouth. Weâre really just\n\ntrying to home in on these really cool products that donât\n\nalways get the light shone on them.\n\n[But] you have to set the right tone from the beginning\n\nwith your team. You canât treat [postprandial drinks] as an\n\nafterthought; theyâre extremely important to the meal and\n\nto the experience. So education is key. You have to make\n\nsure that the [floor staff] understands whatâs in the glass.\n\nThey have to taste it as a team, and they have to get behind\n\nit and understand, [for instance,] how sometimes sweet\n\nwines can go with savory courses. . . . One of my favorite\n\ntricks [is] wagyu beef and ChÃ¢teau dâYquem, and Iâm trying\n\nto find that same kind of harmony here and thinking that,\n\nwith some of the antipasti and the prosciutto, you have a\n\nsalty-savory elementâso being able to introduce something to the team like a Vin Santo or a Madeira and show\n\nthem [how it would pair with an appetizer] could really\n\nenhance the experience.\n\nTAKING INVENTORY\n\nYOUR BUSINESS,\n\nYOUR VOICES\n\nWhat are your tips\n\nfor selling dessert\n\nwines and digestifs?\n\n26 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nPHOTO: ALLISON GALLESE\n\nP:27\n\nPOINTS\n\n2023 VINTAGE\n\nÂ©2024 TRANSCENDENT WINES, NAPA, CA | ENJOY RESPONSIBLY | ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nP:28\n\n28 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nThe Courage to Change\n\nIN CONVERSATION WITH MARY MAHER\n\nby Michelle Schromm, executive director, BÃ¢tonnage\n\nIn this limited series, we share stories\n\nfrom the women behind BÃ¢tonnage,\n\nan industry group focused on creating\n\npositive change for women in wine. For\n\nour third installment, we interviewed\n\nMary Maher, who leads the viticulture\n\nsection of BÃ¢tonnageâs mentorship program while working with the vineyard\n\nteams at Harlan Estate, Promontory, and\n\nSilverado Farming Company.Â\n\nTell us about your journey into the\n\nwine world.\n\nI didnât study wine; I didnât even know\n\nwine was a career path. I grew up in\n\nthe Sacramento Valley in the middle\n\nof rice fields and orchards. I went to\n\ncollege to focus on the sciences and\n\nended up drawn to classes related\n\nto plants and agriculture. Iâd always\n\nloved gardening; my mom was an avid\n\ngardener, so that piqued my interest.\n\nWhen I couldnât find a job after college,\n\nmy science background allowed me to\n\ntake a harvest intern position at J. Lohr\n\nVineyards & Wines, and I thought that\n\nwould kill time until I figured out my\n\nnext steps. . . . I was able to go out with\n\nMr. Lohr and walk the vineyards, and\n\nthe light came on: I thought, âWow, that\n\nthis could be my career path.â\n\nWhat do you love most about\n\nyour work?\n\nI love the connection with people and\n\nwith nature, the soil, and the outdoorsâ\n\nworking with the vineyard crews, all of\n\nus tuning into the seasons and having\n\nour work be in flow with nature. We\n\nwill have an incredibly busy spring and\n\nsummer and then of course at harvest,\n\nitâs all hands on deck. In winter, like\n\nright now, Napa Valley is quiet; itâs\n\nraining and peaceful. We are all in when\n\nnature requires us to be, but then thereâs\n\nthe time . . . when you naturally hibernate, like the vines. Having my body\n\nand soul in touch with those seasons\n\nthrough my work and focusing on that\n\nregenerative process of natureâitâs\n\nreally special and is what has kept me in\n\nthis field for so many years.\n\nYou are the lead for viticulture\n\nwithin the BÃ¢tonnage mentorship\n\nprogram. What does that mean to you?\n\nWith almost 40 years in the industry\n\nnow, Iâve done a lot of work in professional development for teams, so Iâve\n\nlearned how valuable mentorship is.\n\nThere are a lot of people looking in,\n\nwondering how to get their foot in the\n\ndoor or wanting to understand whether\n\na certain career path within the industry\n\nsuits them. And once theyâve joined a\n\ncompany, theyâre learning how to ask\n\nfor things from managers or ownersâfrom advocating for their salary to\n\nasking what a path to leadership looks\n\nlike. I have really loved that part of my\n\nwork at Harlan, elevating vineyard\n\ncrews and watching the development of\n\npeople within the company. And I really\n\nappreciate how BÃ¢tonnage offers this in\n\nthoughtful fashion to the community at\n\nlarge. The women behind the program\n\nand the organization are powerhouses\n\nand itâs really incredible to see the arc of\n\nsuccess weâve had in just a few years.\n\nI also feel I grow and learn from the\n\nmenteesâmaybe more than they doâ\n\nthrough their curiosity and questions\n\nthat help challenge me.\n\nWhat advice do you have for\n\nwomen pursuing a career in\n\nthe industry?\n\nAlways ask yourself: âWhat do I want?â\n\nSpend time throughout your life asking\n\nyourself this: âWhat is my vision for the\n\nnext one, two, or five years? Am I going\n\nin that direction, or am I off-pathâand if\n\nI am, how can I address that?â Iâve seen\n\na lot of women take a lot of different\n\npaths within the industry or switch\n\ngears during the process. Iâve been able\n\nto do that myself as well, from consulting to building a farming company to\n\nworking with vineyard development to\n\nmanaging vineyards and large teams.\n\nThings change over time, and there is\n\nthe possibility to adapt as the phases of\n\nyour life change and along with them\n\nyour vision. I think that is one of the\n\ngreat things about this industry.\n\nEstablished in 2018, BÃ¢tonnage is\n\ndedicated to supporting and empowering\n\nwomen through mentorship, community\n\nbuilding, networking, and job opportunities.

One\n\ntrailblazer helping to lead the charge\n\nis Maker, a canned wine brand\n\nfounded in 2019 by the dynamic trio\n\nof Sarah Hoffman, Kendra Kawala,\n\nand Zoe Victor. These powerhouse\n\nentrepreneurs, who crossed paths as\n\nstudents in Stanford Universityâs MBA\n\nprogram, are bringing diverse skill sets\n\nfrom sales, health care, and consumer\n\ntechnology to oversee an innovative\n\nlabel that embraces the collaborative\n\nnature of the wine industry.\n\nThe inspiration behind Maker was\n\nclear from the onset: âto shine a light\n\non diverse, independent producers.\n\nWe wanted the winemaker and their\n\nstory to be front and center,â explains\n\nHoffman. Together they embarked on\n\na journey to provide premium wine\n\nin cans thatâs produced by various\n\nwineries, some of them women- and\n\nminority-owned (including my label,\n\nTerah Wine Co.). Maker aims to set\n\nitself apart through its unique collaborative model: Driving consumer\n\nengagement through virtual tasting\n\nevents, recipes, wine clubs, and more\n\nvia its DTC e-commerce business, the\n\ncompany fosters a sense of community\n\nwhile promoting the exceptional wines\n\nresulting from its strong partnerships with winemakers. As the world\n\nconfronted the challenges of the\n\npandemic, Maker expanded its reach,\n\ndeveloping a wholesale business with\n\na core line of cans and partnering with\n\naward-winning veteran winemakers as\n\nwell as rising stars from brands such as\n\nCamins 2 Dreams, Ser, and Bodkin.\n\nEnvironmental responsibility is\n\nanother top priority for Makerâone\n\nits founders believe the rest of the\n\nindustry should share. Hoffman notes\n\nthat âcans are emerging as a more\n\neco-friendly alternativeâ that leads to\n\nreduced waste ending up in landfills\n\nand lower CO2\n\nemissions compared\n\nto glass bottles, âand weâve found that\n\nwinemakers are excited to explore cans\n\nwith usâ; some of the wines are also\n\nmade with organic fruit.\n\nA January 2024 Forbes article\n\nby Cheryl Robinson highlighted\n\nMakerâs remarkable growth; in 2023,\n\nthe company sold over 350,000 cans,\n\nequivalent to 9,722 cases of wine.\n\nLooking ahead, Hoffman envisions\n\nMaker further expanding its\n\npresence, bringing its cans\n\nto a range of locations such as arenas,\n\nhotels, ski resorts, and grocery stores.\n\nThe goal is to establish Maker as the\n\ntrusted brand for the next generation\n\nof wine lovers, offering high-quality,\n\nminimal-intervention wines crafted by\n\nindependent producers.\n\nHoffman notes that she sees Makerâs\n\nwinemaker-partners as mentors. Her\n\nadvice to other women entering the\n\nbeverage business is straightforwardâ\n\nâDo it!ââand she encourages newcomers to embrace new perspectives and\n\nideas, underscoring that collaboration\n\nis key to success.\n\nAs the company continues to gain\n\nrecognition for both its outstanding\n\nwines and its groundbreaking business\n\nmodel, itâs sure to serve as an inspiration\n\nto aspiring entrepreneurs, illustrating\n\nthe potential for positive change when\n\npassionate individuals challenge the status quo.

My itinerary\n\nincluded two wine conferences in\n\nVerona: one on the marketing of Pinot\n\nGrigio and the other, Wine2Wine,\n\nhosted by Vinitaly.\n\nThe Consorzio Vini Delle Venezie\n\nDOC symposium on Pinot Grigio Delle\n\nVenezie focused on elevating the perception of Pinot Grigio wines from the Delle\n\nVenezie DOC regions of the Veneto,\n\nFriuli, and Alto Adige. While Pinot\n\nGrigio is made all over the world, it is\n\nconsidered native to these areas, which\n\nproduce most of Italyâs bottlings of the\n\ngrape. That said, over the years, vast\n\namounts of cheap, mass-produced Pinot\n\nGrigio have flooded the market, clouding the view among savvy consumers\n\nthat the variety can produce a quality\n\nwine. The Delle Venezie Consorzio was\n\ncreated in 2017 to address this issue and\n\nimprove the image of Pinot Grigio from\n\nthe region by promoting Delle Venezie\n\nas the true home of Pinot Grigio and the\n\nconsorzioâs members as the sources of\n\npremium product.\n\nVinitaly executive\n\ndirector Stevie\n\nKim, second\n\nfrom left, with\n\nSicilian producers\n\nAntonio Rallo of\n\nDonnafugata,\n\nAlberto Tasca,\n\nand Alessio\n\nPlaneta at the\n\nWine2Wine\n\nconference.\n\nThe Wine2Wine conference, which celebrated its tenth\n\nedition in 2023, focused on the business of Italian wine\n\nwithin the context of the global market. The program\n\nincluded seminars and discussions on best practices for\n\napproaching such key markets for Italian wines as Asia,\n\nEurope (particularly Scandinavia), and, of course, the\n\nUnited States, Italyâs largest export market. Other topics\n\nranged from the growing use of AI in wine production to\n\neffective marketing and promotion (for instance, the use of\n\nsocial media and other digital platforms to increase wineâs\n\nvisibility to younger consumers).\n\nBoth conferences addressed growing concerns in the\n\nindustry over the worldwide drop in wine consumption\n\nand discussed possible ways to reverse the trend. A key\n\ntakeaway was that while bottle consumption is down,\n\nthe amount being spent per bottle has actually increased:\n\nConsumers are purchasing fewer but better wines, making\n\nfor only a slight dip, if any, in sales figures. This is a bit of\n\ngood news that bodes well for producers like those of the\n\nDelle Venezie consorzio who are trying to elevate their\n\nproduct above their competition.\n\nPHOTOS: DAVID RANSOM\n\nAt the Consorzio Vini Delle Venezie DOC symposium on Pinot\n\nGrigio Delle Venezie.\n\nP:33\n\nCelebrating 45 Years of\n\nNapa Valley Winemaking\n\nSince 1979, Sequoia Grove Winery has centered itself around the incredible people, places,\n\nand history of Napa Valley.

In rich,\n\nsandy loam and limestone soils, the vine rootsâthanks to these\n\naquifersâdig deep into the earth, reaching as far down as 30 or\n\n40 feet.\n\nWinds breeze through the vineyard from the Salinas Valley in\n\none direction and the Templeton Gap in the other, building on\n\nthat diurnal temperature swing for which Paso is reputed and\n\noffering a respite for the sun-drenched vines.\n\nIn the early 1970s, four actorsâJames Caan, Wayne Rogers,\n\nPeter Falk, and Jack Webbâwent on a fishing and shooting\n\nexpedition with their friend and local visionary Herman Schwartz.\n\nSchwartz convinced the quartet to start a vineyard, and together\n\nthey planted 500 acres, which at the time represented the biggest commercial planting of Merlot, Syrah, and Zinfandel in the\n\nregion. They named the site Continental Vineyard.\n\nToday, the property is planted to 20 different varieties and is\n\nrun by Justin Tooley, who is actively preparing for a new phase\n\nof growth in Paso Robles. Winemaker Ben Mayo is crafting some\n\nmagnificent wines; here are some of our recent faves.\n\n44 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nPublisherâs PICKS\n\nCV 2018 Reserve\n\nCabernet Sauvignon,\n\nPaso Robles ($80)\n\nViolets and creamy\n\nblueberry thread through\n\ndark chocolate, merging\n\nwith a crushed-velvet\n\ntexture. 96\n\nCV 2019 Reserve\n\nCabernet Sauvignon,\n\nPaso Robles ($80) Bold\n\nand broad, with muscular\n\nshoulders.

Nice, rounded texture, with\n\ngood length on the dry finish. Distinctive\n\npackaging. 90\n\nJOSEPH CASTAN WINES\n\nKim Crawford NV Prosecco Extra\n\nDry, Veneto, Italy ($15) Pale color,\n\nwith a steady bead of bubbles and a nice\n\nmousse. Fruity, fresh, bright, and lively,\n\nwith some citrus and tropical fruit notes.\n\nLight body yet good palate presence, with\n\nadequate acidity and a discernible level of\n\nsweetness that isnât cloying. 89\n\nCONSTELLATION BRANDS\n\nCannonball 2022\n\nChardonnay, California\n\n($16) A well-made,\n\nmedium-bodied wine with a\n\nyouthful, bright appearance\n\nand good intensity shown\n\nthrough notes of pear,\n\npineapple, citrus, and stone\n\nfruit. Smooth, polished\n\nstyle, with just a bit of oak\n\ninfluence to introduce\n\nsome added interest. Partial\n\nmalolactic and lees stirring\n\nadded a rounded, textural component. 89\n\nSHARE A SPLASH WINE CO.\n\nRuffino NV Moscato dâAsti, Italy\n\n($17) Exuberant, vibrant, and lightbodied, this is a textbook example of the\n\nvariety, with a pale color, good purity, and\n\nmoderate intensity. A light fizz (frizzante)\n\nand notes of peach, apricot, and orange\n\nblossom lift the palate, which is sweet\n\nwithout being cloying and leads to a clean,\n\nfruit-driven finish. 89\n\nCONSTELLATION BRANDS\n\nCavalys NV Gran Reserva Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Maipo Valley, Chile ($17)\n\nClassically styled and well balanced, with\n\ndeep, well-extracted color; fine aromatic\n\nintensity; a medium-full body; and good\n\npresence up front and on the midpalate. It\n\npossesses a dense core, adding firm tannins\n\nand notes of cassis, blackberry, and charred\n\noak plus a slight hint of bell-pepper pyrazine\n\nto a solid structure that benefits from some\n\naeration. Good length on the finish. 90\n\nMercer Brothers 2020\n\nCabernet Sauvignon,\n\nHorse Heaven Hills,\n\nColumbia Valley,\n\nWashington ($20) Solid\n\ndensity of color with a deep\n\ncore. Lovely aromatics give\n\nway to cassis, black fruit, and\n\nsavory notes of vanilla and\n\noak that show good intensity\n\nand weight on the palate\n\nwhile remaining balanced and\n\nharmonious. The character\n\nderived from 14 months of aging in a\n\ncombination of French and American oak is\n\nwell integrated and, as with many Columbia\n\nValley Cabernet Sauvignons, the tannins\n\nlend firmness and definition on the back\n\npalate. Outstanding value! 91\n\nBound 2022 Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Alexander\n\nValley ($20) Deep red/\n\npurple color with a slight fade\n\nat the rim of the glass. Notes\n\nof dark fruit, cassis, smoky\n\noak, and baking spice plus\n\na hint of bell pepper. Good\n\nintensity and range denote a\n\nsolid palate presence: weighty,\n\nround, and well structured,\n\nwith a moderately long\n\nfinish. Tannins are evident\n\nbut nicely integrated, giving the wine a\n\npleasant texture. Made from 95% Cabernet\n\nSauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc aged in\n\na combination of French and American oak,\n\nitâs a benchmark example of the Alexander\n\nValley that should develop well over the\n\nnext few years. 89\n\nPRECISION WINE CO.\n\nSpicerack Vineyards 2021 Syrah,\n\nSonoma County ($25) Thereâs plenty to\n\nlike about this wine, including its artisanal\n\nfeel and its expressive, well-defined, lifted\n\naromatics. Well-extracted color and a\n\ndeep core, with a slight fade at the edge of\n\nthe glass; some haziness indicates minimal\n\nfiltration. Dark fruit, dark roast coffee,\n\ncracked pepper, star anise, and cardamom\n\ncontribute weight. Quite an accessible style,\n\nwith no overt oak character; round and\n\nharmonious, with strong presence on the\n\nfront and middle of the palate. Balanced,\n\nsoft finish with ripe tannins. 97% Syrah and\n\n3% Viognier (co-fermented). 92\n\nPrecision 2022 Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Napa Valley\n\n($25) Made from 80%\n\nCabernet Sauvignon, 15%\n\nMerlot, and 5% Petit Verdot\n\naged ten months in (30%\n\nnew) French oak, this is a\n\nskillfully crafted textbook\n\nstyle from Napa Valley that\n\ndeveloped beautifully with\n\nan hour of aeration. Deep\n\ncolor and wonderfully pure\n\naromatics of black and red\n\nfruit, cloves, and smoky oak. Full and ripe on\n\nthe palate, with nice intensity and breadth;\n\na solid structure; and well-balanced, round,\n\nextended length on the finish. Supple, ripe\n\ntannins make a pleasant, tactile impression\n\non the back palate. 91\n\nPRECISION WINE CO.\n\nReviews From Master of Wine BOB PAULINSKI\n\nto the\n\nPOINT\n\nOne of about 400 Masters of Wine worldwide, Bob Paulinski has over 40 years of experience\n\nin the industry and has traveled extensively to wine-producing regions around the world.\n\nHis passion is for wines that show a sense of place.\n\nP:50\n\n50 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nMacRostie 2022\n\nChardonnay, Sonoma\n\nCoast, Sonoma County\n\n($28) A beautifully crafted\n\nand seamlessly smooth wine\n\nsourced from exceptional\n\nsites in both Carneros and\n\nthe Russian River Valley,\n\nincluding Sangiacomo, Ricci,\n\nDutton, and Martinelli. Pale\n\nstraw color, with refined,\n\npronounced aromatics of\n\npear, stone fruit, and vanilla.\n\nUltra-elegant and nuanced yet highly\n\nexpressive style; ample weight on the\n\npalate; and bright underlying acidity with\n\nwell-integrated, high-quality oak. Seventyseven percent of the wine was barrel\n\nfermented in (15% new) French oak,\n\nwhile the remainder was cool-fermented\n\nin stainless steel to lift the brightness of\n\nthe final blend. Aged on the lees for six\n\nmonths with occasional lees stirring to\n\nyield a broader textural component, it also\n\nunderwent partial malolactic. 93\n\nChÃ¢teau Saint-Jean dâAumiÃ¨res\n\n2020 lâAlchimiste, AOP Terrasses du\n\nLarzac, Languedoc, France ($30)\n\nMedium-deep core with a slight fade at the\n\nedge of the glass and moderate intensity\n\ndisplayed through notes of black fruit,\n\nsavory spice, cracked pepper, coffee, and\n\ntoasted coconut. Full-bodied, weighty, and\n\nrobust, with an appealing rustic character\n\nand moderate tannins that developed well\n\nwith an hour of aeration. A blend of 45%\n\nGrenache, 40% Syrah, and 15% Carignan. 89\n\nJOSEPH CASTAN WINES\n\nTruth & Valor 2021\n\nCabernet Sauvignon,\n\nPaso Robles ($30)\n\nRobust, full-bodied, and\n\nconcentrated, with a deep,\n\ndense core and pronounced\n\nlayers of ripe black fruit,\n\nsavory spice, and dark roast\n\ncoffee as well as good palate\n\nweight. Moderately long\n\nfinish with ripe tannins that\n\ndeveloped well with some\n\naeration. Aged 18 months in\n\na combination of (25% new) French and\n\nAmerican oak. 90\n\nAquilini 2022 Sauvignon\n\nBlanc, Red Mountain,\n\nColumbia Valley,\n\nWashington ($36) Pale\n\ncolor with a green tinge.\n\nOn the heels of superb\n\naromas, Marsh grapefruit,\n\nstone fruit, and light herbal\n\ntones establish a wonderful\n\npresence on the mediumbodied palate alongside a\n\nslight oak note. Nuanced,\n\nrefined, and elegant, with\n\nexcellent texture and ample acidity to\n\nmaintain freshness on the palate. Barrel\n\nfermented in (40% new) French oak and\n\naged six months sur lie. 92\n\nMacRostie 2022 Pinot\n\nNoir, Sonoma Coast,\n\nSonoma County ($38)\n\nPale, youthful appearance,\n\nwith wonderful aromatics\n\nand lifted notes of red\n\nberries, strawberry jam, and\n\nbaking spice. The palate is a\n\nbit savory yet possesses a\n\nfine purity; subtle and wellintegrated (30% new) French\n\noak adds complexity. Round,\n\nelegant, layered, and nuanced,\n\nwith bright acidity and a soft, extended\n\nfinish. Sourced from multiple premium\n\nsites, including the new Nightwing Estate\n\nVineyard in the Petaluma Gap AVA. 91\n\nTruth & Valor 2021\n\nReserve Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Santa\n\nMargarita Ranch, Paso\n\nRobles ($42) Deep, dense,\n\nand well extracted, with\n\ngood aromatic intensity and\n\nrange, this is a wine with\n\nconsiderable structure and\n\nbalance. Black fruit and dark\n\ncherry join notes of savory\n\nspice, dark roast coffee, and\n\ndark chocolate on the plush,\n\nweighty, round palate with ample volume.\n\nCharacter derived from 16 months of aging\n\nin (50% new) French oak is well integrated\n\nand follows through well to the back palate\n\nwith supple tannins. 92\n\nKB by Knights Bridge 2019 Red\n\nBlend, Knights Valley, Sonoma\n\nCounty ($50) Solid depth of color\n\nextends to the edge of the glass. Excellent\n\naromatics and expressive dark fruit meld\n\nwith notes of mocha, coffee, and smoky\n\noak on a weighty, round, seamlessly smooth\n\npalate, whose well-balanced presence\n\nleads to an extended finish with integrated\n\ntannins. 91\n\nKB by Knights Bridge 2019 Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Knights Valley, Sonoma\n\nCounty ($65) Deep core with a slight\n\nfade at the edge of the glass; solid aromas\n\nof dark fruit. Showing notes of cassis,\n\nespresso, and smoky oak, the palate is quite\n\ngenerous, with good intensity held up by\n\nfirm tannins. Extended French oak aging\n\nadds refinement and complexity. This is a\n\ngood cellar candidate for up to another\n\ndecade. 92\n\nThe Fifth Empire 2021 Cabernet\n\nSauvignon, Pritchard Hill, Napa\n\nValley ($100) This wine makes a strong\n\nstatement: With its deep, dense core and\n\npronounced aromatics, it shines with\n\nnotes of ripe dark fruit. Blackberry, cassis,\n\nboysenberry, black licorice, and dried herbs\n\nare robust and weighty on the palate,\n\njoined by well-integrated oak. Alcohol\n\nclocks in at 15.1%, yet the structure of the\n\nwine can support it well; the tannins are\n\nevident but soft, melding with an extended\n\nand plush finish. 93\n\nto the\n\nPOINT\n\nP:51\n\ncreamycreation.com\n\nVisit us at WSWA Access Live\n\nBooth #1025\n\nCream Vegan Oats SL!M RTDs\n\nand many more tailor-made options\n\nGet started: [email protected]\n\nP:52\n\nRegistration and Refreshments\n\nWelcome and Opening Remarks\n\nGENERAL SESSION I\n\nThe State of Wine Education\n\nGENERAL SESSION II\n\nAll Hands Think Tank:\n\nInnovating Wine Education\n\nSummit Meet and Mingle Reception\n\nBOOK SIGNING\n\nEvan Goldstein\n\nPerfect Pairings: A Master Sommelierâs\n\nPractical Advice for Partnering Wine\n\nSunday, May 5\n\n2 P.M.\n\n2:30 P.M.\n\n2:45 P.M\n\n4:15 P.M.\n\n5:30 P.M.\n\nBreakfast\n\nMorning Remarks\n\nGENERAL SESSION III\n\nDollars and Sense: Financial Fluency\n\nfor the Wine and Restaurant Business\n\nNetworking and Refreshment Break\n\nGENERAL SESSION IV\n\nTechniques on Tasting\n\nFamily-Style Lunch\n\nGENERAL SESSION V\n\nBuilding Skills for Managing Teams\n\nNetworking and Refreshment Break\n\nGENERAL SESSION VI\n\nBig Blind Tasting\n\nHAPPY HOUR RECEPTION\n\nWell-Being in the Beverage Industry\n\nBOOK SIGNING\n\nAndrea Robinson\n\nGreat Wine Made Simple:\n\nStraight Talk from a Master Sommelier\n\nMonday, May 6\n\n8:30 A.M.\n\n9 A.M.\n\n9:15 A.M.\n\n10:45 A.M.\n\n11:15 A.M.\n\n12:30 P.M.\n\n1:30 P.M.\n\n2:45 P.M.\n\n3 P.M.\n\n4:30 P.M.\n\n3 DAYS OF\n\nImmersive Tastings\n\nBusiness Workshops\n\nIndustry Networking\n\nMAY 5â7, 2024\n\nThe CIA at COPIA | NAPA, CA\n\nP:53\n\nBreakfast\n\nMorning Remarks\n\nGENERAL SESSION VII\n\nNegotiating for Yourself\n\nand Your Business\n\nNetworking and Refreshment Break\n\nGENERAL SESSION VIII\n\nHidden Gems: Innovative Career\n\nTracks for the Curious Professional\n\nBento Box Lunch and\n\nWalk-Around Wine Tasting\n\nGENERAL SESSION IX\n\nPouring Possibilities: The Expanding\n\nLandscape of Beverage\n\nNetworking and Refreshment Break\n\nGENERAL SESSION X â¢ SPEED NETWORKING\n\nConfidence Coaching and\n\nCommunity Connection\n\nFarewell Toast\n\nTuesday, May 7\n\n8:30 A.M.\n\n9 A.M.\n\n9:15 A.M.\n\n10:45 A.M.\n\n11 A.M.\n\n12:30 P.M.\n\n1:30 P.M.\n\n2:45 P.M.\n\n3 P.M.\n\n4:45 P.M.\n\nEVAN GOLDSTEIN, MS\n\nMaster Sommelier & President, Full Circle\n\nWine Solutions and Master the World\n\nMaster Sommelier, San Francisco Giants\n\nDESIREE HARRISON-BROWN\n\nFounder, Wino Noire\n\nEducator, Napa Valley Wine Academy\n\nMARY REZEK\n\nGlobal Executive Coach & Founder,\n\nMary Rezek\n\nSpeakers Include\n\nFor full list of speakers\n\nand to register, visit\n\nciabevpro.com\n\nSchedule subject to changes.\n\nTJ DOUGLAS\n\nCEO & Founder, Drink Progressively Group\n\nP:54\n\n54 THE TASTING PANEL ~ MARCH/APRIL 2024\n\nregional spotlight\n\nZio Tony Ranch,\n\nMartinelli Winery\n\nâIt is the quintessential Russian River Valley\n\nvineyard story.
