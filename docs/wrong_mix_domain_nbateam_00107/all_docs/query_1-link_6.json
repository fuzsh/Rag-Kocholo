        "text": "The Golden State Warriors have hired in-house to fill their vacant general manager post.\n\nThe team announced Friday that Mike Dunleavy Jr. has been promoted to GM, filling the open spot created when former GM Bob Myers stepped down in late May.\n\n“We think Mike is the perfect fit to lead our basketball operations department,” Warriors co-executive chairman & CEO Joe Lacob said Friday. “He has a wealth of basketball knowledge, stemming from his family upbringing, a 15-year NBA playing career and five seasons serving under Bob Myers in our front office.\n\n“He’s young and energetic, has established numerous relationships around the league and communicates well with players and coaches—all important traits in this business. Mike’s ready for this challenge and responsibility.”\n\nDunleavy has been a part of the Warriors’ front office for the past five seasons, serving as vice president of basketball operations for two seasons after spending two seasons as assistant GM. He was also a pro scout for the team in 2018-19.\n\nHis elevation to the role isn’t unexpected as he has been groomed for this position for several years, per the San Francisco Chronicle. Dunleavy has ties to the franchise as well, spending four-plus seasons (2002-07) with the Warriors during his 15-year NBA playing career.\n\nDunleavy has big shoes to fill and decisions to make with Myers leaving after the Warriors lost in the Western Conference semifinals to LeBron James and the Lakers following Golden State’s championship run last year.\n\nDraymond Green has a $27.6 million player option and has said he’d like to stay with the core of Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson to help the Warriors chase another championship.\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report."
