        "text": "Bob Myers is hoping the position he resigned from can go to an in in-house choice.\n\nAfter the former Warriors president announced his departure from the franchise on Tuesday, saying “it’s just time,” he gave the nod to a potential successor — Mike Dunleavy Jr. — at his press conference\n\nDunleavy currently serves as the vice president of basketball operations for Golden State. He is rounding out his second year in the position and fifth as a member of the Warriors front office.\n\n“He’s really good, he’d be a fantastic choice,” said Myers, who played a role in leading the Warriors to four NBA titles and twice won the NBA’s Executive of the Year award in 12 years with the franchise.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Dunleavy’s name has made it into the conversation, as he was brought up soon after the Warriors concluded their season losing to the Lakers in the second round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Dunleavy has seen significant growth in the past two years after taking on the vice president role and has been viewed as a “natural successor” to Myers’ previous position.\n\nThe 42-year-old Dunleavy, whose dad was a longtime NBA coach, played 15 seasons in the NBA after playing college basketball for Duke and Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nDunleavy played four seasons with the Warriors after he was drafted third overall by the team in 2002.\n\nWhen his playing career was over Dunleavy found himself coming back to where he got his start to be scout.\n\nSince then, he worked his way up. If Dunleavy does become the Warriors next team president, he will have a lot of issues to deal with right away.\n\nHe will have to deal with the question about the future of Draymond Green, who has a player option, as well as a possible contract extension for Klay Thompson.\n\nWarriors owner Joe Lacob didn’t give names when asked about who likely would fill Myers’ role, but he did explain that the team will look to promote a current employee rather than sourcing outside of their organization."
