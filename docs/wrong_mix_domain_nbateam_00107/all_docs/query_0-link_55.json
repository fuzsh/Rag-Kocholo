        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — The Warriors overcame a flat first half and turned out a 110-106 win over the Portland Trail Blazers on Wednesday night at Chase Center.\n\nAfter being down by as many as many as 11 to the bottom-feeding Trail Blazers, Golden State’s turning point came late in the third quarter. Portland’s young stars Anfernee Simons and Shaedon Sharpe were torching the Warriors, but Jonathan Kuminga’s entry into the game with just under five minutes left in the third countered Portland’s athleticism.\n\nIn just under 16 minutes, Kuminga had 13 points and was a team-best plus-13 with two steals — including a pivotal one on Portland’s inbound pass that led to a Steph Curry 3-pointer that extended their lead to four.\n\nCurry got off to a slow start — as did the Warriors, who shot 2-for-16 from 3 in the first half — but finished with a team-high 31 points shooting 5-of-13 from 3. Draymond Green had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Warriors head on a three-game road trip. First to Oklahoma City to play the Thunder on Friday, then will have an extended stay in Phoenix before playing the Suns on Tuesday, then the Los Angeles Clippers that Thursday."
