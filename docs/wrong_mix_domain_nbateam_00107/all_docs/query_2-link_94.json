The San Antonio Spurs rarely have a major starring role in the affair. Last season, the entire basketball world wanted to see how Victor Wembanyama would play in his first “NBA game.” This season, the Spurs rolled out the red carpet once again to honor a historic coach and introduce the youngsters to their new veterans.\n\nThe Summer Spurs looked much better after shaking off some rust in the California Classic last week. They defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in an 83-77 win. The biggest story might have been what happened off the court, with Gregg Popovich, Chris Paul and Harrison Barnes sitting courtside. Popovich attended to help the National Basketball Coaches Association give former Spurs assistant coach, Hank Egan, the Tex Winter Assistant Coach Lifetime Impact Award. Egan coached Popovich and gave him his first assistant coaching job at Air Force.\n\nPopovich did a rare broadcast interview with Mark Jones and Doris Burke of ESPN. He talked about the Spurs’ new veterans, and the young guys playing in the Summer League. He spoke about Paul and Barnes being able to help the young players learn necessary lessons in NBA life. He spoke highly of Sidy Cissoko’s potential and teased that Stephon Castle would likely play right away.\n\nHis praise for the Summer League players came on a night when they shined. Castle once again looked like one of the better rookies in the 2024 NBA Draft class with strong finishing at the rim and patience in the pick and roll. The first-round pick finished with a game-high 22 points and added in 5 rebounds, 4 assists and a steal. Cissoko looked spry just seven weeks after knee surgery. He was everywhere in the first half on the defensive end and ran the break well. He had 8 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists and 2 steals in the win.\n\nCastle continues to impress and Cissoko has come on strong. The rest of the Summer Spurs are starting to round into form as well. The team has improved from their blowout losses in Sacramento. That’s an encouraging sign for the Spurs coaching staff as they continue in Vegas. Their next contest with come against the Atlanta Hawks and number-one-pick, Zaccharie Risacher on Sunday, July 14th.\n\nObservations:\n\nSummer League coach, Kenny Trevino and the Spurs coaching staff have encouraged Castle to fire away. He’s responded by getting up 20+ shots in the last two games. Castle is pulling up from deep, in the mid-range and getting to the basket. These are good reps for Castle to get right now because he hasn’t consistently shown the ability to knock down those shots, yet. Summer League is the time to experiment and work on weaker aspects of your game. The results can be exciting. Castle hit a backpedaling catch and shoot three-pointer and a pull-up 3 over the outstretched arms of his former teammate, Donovan Clingan, as he went 2-6 from deep. There are still plenty of bad misses, but it’s encouraging to see that Castle is likely a bit further along as a shooter than some of the other young players the Spurs have drafted in previous years.\n\nWe’re beating a dead horse here, but Castle has looked strong operating out of the pick-and-roll. He plays with an impressive pace that’s not necessarily shifty or overly explosive, but he can catch defenders off-guard with his ball-handling ability, strength and change of speed. Castle’s passing ability stands out. He’s adept at dump-offs to bigs and cutters in the paint. He made eye-popping, one-handed skip passes to shooters in the corners. His decision-making still has a ways to go, as he tends to force the issue right now. Some of that could be related to the encouragement of the Spurs staff. Popovich says he is going to play early on in the season, and it’s not hard to see why.\n\nCissoko had his best game of the Summer League. Popovich talked about his frame and athleticism combined with his passing instincts being “the dream in the back of my head.” It’s clear that the Spurs value him as a prospect. Cissoko is a chaos agent on the floor, running around everywhere and making flashy plays with his savvy passing. When he runs in transition, good things typically happen. Cissoko fits in with the team San Antonio is building. One with versatile athletes who defend, dribble and pass. They’ll still need shooting, and that’s an area of the game where Cissoko needs a lot of work. He still needs to find a role in the half-court offense. Weaknesses aside, nights like this remind you of his upside.\n\nJamaree Bouyea looks more and more like an NBA rotation player. He was excellent defensively in the win on Saturday. The Spurs two-way player had 11 points, 6 assists, 4 steals and 4 blocks against Portland. He works his tail off and is really quick. He and Castle have a nice synergy, that almost emulates what a CP3 & Castle backcourt could look like, as they both handle the ball, can play off-ball and play tough defense.\n\nNathan Mensah has only gotten better as the Summer League has gone along. He had 12 and 10 with 2 steals on Saturday. Despite being undersized at 6-9, Mensah competed against the bigger Clingan all night and won the matchup. He has nice instincts as a rim protector that could be worth exploring in Austin this year.\n\nSpurs second-round pick, Harrison Ingram has shot the ball well in the Summer League. He hit a pair of threes on Saturday on his way to an 8-point, 5-rebound and 3-steal night. Ingram looks like a solid second-round pickup who could eventually play NBA minutes. His upside to be a versatile 3&D wing who can provide something off the dribble is enticing."
