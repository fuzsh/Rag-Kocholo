Dunleavy will fill the vacancy following the promotion of Kirk Lacob to executive vice president of basketball operations.\n\nDunleavy Jr. joined the Warriors last season as a scout after a 15-year career in the NBA.\n\nAlthough he jumped around over the course of his playing days Dunleavy Jr. spent his first four seasons in the NBA with the Warriors. It was there that he developed into a reliable rotation piece."
