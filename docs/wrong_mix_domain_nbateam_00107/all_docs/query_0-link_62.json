        "text": "SoCalHoops Recruiting News\n\nWill He Or Won't He? Mike Dunleavy, Jr.\n\nTo Announce Decision Today--(Nov. 16, 1998)\n\nMike Dunleavy, Jr., (6'-7\" Sr. SG/SF) from Portland Jesuit will reportedly hold a press conference today at 5:30 p.m. at which time he will announce whether he will choose UNC or Duke. Dunleavy is one of the top players on the west coast, was selected to the first team \"Fab 15\" by Frank Burlison and a ton of college coaches and scouts, and would be just a huge signing for either school. Dunleavy played this spring and summer for the Pump-N-Run traveling teams, and he has one of the smoothest shots and quickest releases of anyone in the senior class. According to most of the other internet recruiting sites, Mike's dad, Michael Dunleavy Sr., the coach of the Portland Trailblazers and former Laker coach, wanted his son to attend UNC, while most people believe that he wants to attend Duke.\n\nWhen we spoke to both of them this summer, and then spoke with Mike Jr., again this fall, the biggest concern was the depth and scope of the education he'd be getting, and Mike Sr., told us that he really didn't care where his son went as long as it was an academically oriented school. Of course, Mike was interested in Stanford, but we've heard that they've dropped from the race.\n\nIn any event, we'll all probably find out the real story in about one hour if the reports of the news conference are true. We phone the Dunleavy residence, and spoke with Mike's mom, and she said \"Mike and his dad will be home at 7:30; I really don't know what he's going to do. I think you should call back then.\"\n\nAs a side note, Clark Francis at Hoop Scoop is announcing that his sources say it's Duke. We don't know. Guess we'll all find out at about the same time."
