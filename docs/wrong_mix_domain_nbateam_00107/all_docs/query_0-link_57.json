        "text": "June 1\n\nSchonely moved to Portland to start working with his first task being to assemble a radio network, starting with Portland's KOIN as the flagship, and Blazer games were carried on six stations during the first year. Schonely was not as familiar with basketball as with other sports, and had to work hard to learn the game, attending every practice early on. Schonely called the play-by-play on 2,522 Blazers radio and television broadcasts, from Portland's very first preseason outing (September 24, 1970) to the team's appearance in the 1998 NBA Playoffs (April 30, 1998).\n\nJune 2\n\n1976\n\nThe @trailblazers announce Free Agent signing of #DaveTwardzik formerly of the #ABA#VirginiaSquires. Twardzik was originally a 2nd Rd. pick by the Blazers in the 1972 NBA draft from@ODU_MBB, but decided to stay close to home and play for the Squires. Twardzik played for 4 seasons and was an All-Star during the 1974/75 season. The Squires folded last month allowing Twardzik to sign with any team. Stu Inman, the Blazers Player Personal Director, called Twardzik \"a poised tough player\" and would be welcomed for his hustle at both ends of the floor\n\n2000\n\n​\n\nThe Blazers tie up the best-of-seven series after being down 3-1, forcing a Game 7 in Los Angeles.\n\nBy Bob Baum, The Associated Press\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. - In one week, the Portland Trail Blazers have gone from \"death's door\" to the threshold of one of the NBA's greatest comebacks. When it counted most, Portland finally beat the Los Angeles Lakers at home Friday night, sending the Western Conference finals to a deciding Game 7. Steve Smith scored 26 points and Bonzi Wells had a career-playoff high 20, 14 in the fourth quarter, as the Trail Blazers took the lead halfway through the first quarter and never gave it up in a 103-93 victory. Kobe Bryant scored 33 points for Los Angeles and played the entire game despite a sprained right foot, but it wasn't enough.\n\nJackson said he knew it would be difficult to beat Portland three consecutive times in the Rose Garden, and his players understand how tough this series is. \"They're not happy with their performance, that's for sure,\" Jackson said, \"but they understand this is a war. We lost a battle tonight, but the war's not over.\" O'Neal, averaging 29.2 points in the playoffs, had 17 points and 11 rebounds but was only 7-for-17 from the field and 3-for-10 at the line. \"I thought they played extremely well on Shaquille,\" Jackson said. \"A lot of his touches were crowded. It was tough for us to get spacing on the floor to get it in to him. But they were giving us other things. We had the types of shots we wanted.\"\n\n​\n\nThe intensity has built as the Blazers tightened the series. \"We've noticed as the games went on they started to turn away from playing the game and started to do other activities away from the game,\" Pippen said, \"taking cheap shots at guys to try to start altercations. I'm just telling my guys to stay focused, play hard and try to walk away from it. \"Rick Fox said to me, 'It's going to be on in L.A.' I'm looking forward to it.\" In the third quarter, O'Neal missed his first six shots and was called for a flagrant foul for flattening Pippen on a drive to the basket. After lying on the floor for several minutes, Pippen got to his feet and made one of two free throws to put Portland ahead 60-49 with 5:21 to play in the quarter. \"He hit me pretty hard,\" Pippen said. \"It was obvious what he was trying to do. He had no intention of going to the ball, so I'll see if he gets fined $10,000.\" Pippen was fined $10,000 for an elbow to the back of John Salley's head late in Game 4.\n\nPippen scored a series-low nine points and was just 1-for-6 from the field, but the Blazers had more than enough offense elsewhere with five players in double figures. Rasheed Wallace scored 18, Damon Stoudamire 14, 10 in the first half, and Arvydas Sabonis had 10 points and 11 rebounds. Glen Rice and Brian Shaw scored 12 apiece for Los Angeles. The Blazers clinched the victory by going 15-for-16 at the foul line in the fourth quarter. \"They were playing desperate ball,\" O'Neal said. \"But we knew it was going to be hard to come up here and win three games.\" O'Neal was 1-for-1 from the field and 2-for-2 at the line in the fourth quarter. Bryant was 4-for-6 on 3-pointers in the fourth quarter and 6-for-9 for the game.\n\nhttps://www.nba.com/blazers/video/2020/04/21/classic\n\n​\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbj81Z6NloI\n\n2012\n\n​Former Blazers center LeRoy Ellis passed away\n\n​https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbHwbF_SvVk\n\n​Blazers co-founder Harry Glickman, who had originally hired McCloskey in Portland, expressed fond memories in a statement released by the Blazers organization Friday. \"The world of sports lost one of its greatest competitors in the death of Jack McCloskey. He was our coach for two years and later became General Manager of the Detroit Pistons and led them to two World Championships. He was a great athlete, playing 60 minutes a game for the University of Pennsylvania. Later in life, he took up tennis and became one of the best in our country in his age bracket. We offer our condolences to his family.\"\n\nJune 3\n\n1977\n\n1992\n\nMichael Jordan dominated from the beginning, breaking the record for most points in a first half in the playoffs once held by Elgin Baylor (Michael had 35, Baylor had 33). This included six first-half threes (also a record). It was after the sixth three-pointer that Jordan turned towards the broadcast table and famously shrugged to indicate his surprise.\n\n​Jordan's shrug became a highlight reel mainstay. Portland held their final lead at 45–44 in the second quarter before Chicago went on a 22–6 run to grab a 66–51 halftime lead and take control. The Bulls finished with a 122–89 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlaL9OhZQoc\n\nThis wasn’t a Maximus Decimus Meridius “Are you not entertained?”moment. This was a humble “Yup, I can’t believe it, either” reaction to his atypical 3-point shooting ability. “Let me tell you, I surprised them as much as I surprised you and myself, the way I was shooting today,” said Jordan following Game 1, which is now known as “The Shrug Game.” “I had to ride the wave when I had it, and everyone picked up on it.”\n\nhttps://www.nba.com/bulls/news/bullsclassics_smith_111130.html\n\nJune 4\n\n1977\n\nAt 4:43am, a mere six hours after their 110-104 game 5 victory against the @sixers on June 3, the @trailblazers charter jet arrived @flypdx and were greeted by estimated 3,000 fans.\n\n2000\n\n​\n\nMoments after his team endured a devastating defeat that remains one of the most painful in Portland Trail Blazers history, coach Mike Dunleavy revealed an unexpected plan to move on. \"I'm going to go home, have a cold beer and sit back and relax,” he said. “There is no sense talking about would've, could've and should've.\"\n\nBut there would be no hushing the would’ve, could’ve and should’ve stemming from the events of June 4, 2000. Not after the Blazers were dismissed 89-84 by the hated Los Angeles Lakers in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, spoiling a golden opportunity to play for an NBA championship for the fourth time in franchise history.\n\nIt will always be remembered as a franchise-defining loss for the Blazers, a gargantuan 48-minute what-if condensed into a painful 12-minute fourth-quarter meltdown. The Blazers led by 13 points heading into the ill-fated final period, seemingly poised to silence Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant and Phil Jackson. But in the blink of an eye, the Blazers fumbled away a chance at history. They went 7 minutes, 30 seconds without scoring. They missed 13 shots in a row, six of them coming from their suddenly ice-cold All-Star, Rasheed Wallace. They were outscored 31-13. They watched feebly as Brian Shaw swished threes, Bryant tossed alley-oops to O’Neal and the Lakers completed the largest comeback ever in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.\n\nA replay of the game — and that Bryant-to-O’Neal alley-oop exclamation mark — still airs on televisions inside Staples Center two decades later on days the Blazers and Lakers play.\n\nThe Oregonian had an assortment of reporters in Los Angeles to cover that fateful night, offering an historical snapshot of the agony through game stories, columns, sidebars and even first-person player diaries.\n\n​\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of the monumental defeat, here’s a look back at the buildup, collapse and fallout, as told by those who covered the moment:\n\nBLAZERS ENTERED GAME 7 CONFIDENT\n\nThe Blazers boasted the NBA’s highest payroll during the 1999-2000 season, as general manager Bob Whitsitt used $74 million of owner Paul Allen’s riches to assemble the NBA’s deepest and most versatile roster, which included Damon Stoudamire, Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith, Arvydas Sabonis, Brian Grant, Bonzi Wells and Wallace.\n\nThey had won 59 regular-season games, second-most in franchise history, and owned all the momentum in the series. After falling behind 3-1, the Blazers stunned the Lakers by winning back-to-back elimination games, forcing a winner-take-all Game 7 in Los Angeles.\n\nAnd the Blazers did not lack confidence heading into the finale, as beat writer Steve Brandon detailed in a Game 7 preview story: \"We know they're a little bit of a fragile team,\" Pippen said. \"They don't have the experience. They don't truly believe in the triangle (offense) system. Once you catch guys like that, you tend to think things are working in your favor.\"\n\nMomentum is working overtime for the Blazers.\n\n\"Definitely,\" Wells said. \"We are ready to go to The Finals.\"\n\nThe Lakers? \"We still have a chance,\" forward Robert Horry said.\n\nThe Blazers, who won Games 5 and 6 to even the best-of-seven series 3-3, can become the seventh team in NBA history to overcome a 3-1 deficit and win a playoff series. The Lakers have not lost three games in a row this season. … The Blazers' comeback has made the teams even testier toward each other, and the series has become filled with complaints of cheap shots and illegal defenses and other violations.\n\n​\n\n\"We smell blood, and we want to kill these Lakers,\" Wells said. \"The Lakers better be ready and have their hard hats on because we are coming for them.\"\n\nEach team is 3-2 this season, regular season and playoffs, on the other's court. “I’m glad we’re on their court (for Game 7),” Grant said. “That will put our backs to the wall even more.”\n\n​\n\nStoudamire penned an ongoing first-person diary for The Oregonian throughout the postseason, dictating his words to reporter Kerry Eggers as the Blazers dispatched the Minnesota Timberwolves and Utah Jazz to reach the conference finals for the second consecutive season.\n\nOn the eve of the biggest game of his career, Stoudamire said he and the Blazers were “ready” and eerily discussed the importance of starting strong and making the Lakers “play from behind.\"\n\n​\n\nI feel good about our chances, about us going to the Staples Center and getting the job done. We should all feel that way right now. We have played well under the biggest pressure the last two games. We should have won at least one of the games we lost, and that bothered us for a while, but that is behind us now.\n\nThe absolute key is to jump on the Lakers early today. We are the type of team that thrives on getting a lead and making the opponent play from behind. In this series, we have been the aggressors at the beginning of the game. We have gotten off to big early leads in four of the games. The Lakers haven’t done it to us once.\n\n…\n\nWe are ready. Our players are ready. Our coaches are ready. Our organization is ready. I am pretty sure our fans are ready, too. It would only be fitting for us to beat the Lakers on their home court today for the right to represent the West in The Finals. Let’s get it on.\n\nBLAZERS LOSE GRIP ON CHAMPIONSHIP HOPES\n\nThe Blazers were practically unstoppable for three quarters in Game 7, building a a 16-point lead with a few seconds left before the fourth. But Shaw banked in an improbable three-pointer shortly before the final quarter, providing the Lakers a faint pulse heading into the most important 12 minutes of the season.\n\nThat pulse — and Shaw’s shot — proved to be a lifeline. From Brandon’s Game 7 game story: The Trail Blazers had the Los Angeles Lakers at death’s door. The fourth quarter was simply going to be when they administered the last rites. If ever a team was groggy and ready to be thrown across the threshold, it was Los Angeles. Quite a fall it was shaping up to be, too. The bigger they are and all that.\n\nUnbelievably, the Blazers lost their grip. The fingers on their shooting hands started to slip. Their swagger turned into a wobble. Then their grasp on the Lakers came loose. And with that, a likely NBA championship crawled out of the Blazers' clutches. Fashioning one of the most amazing escapes in NBA playoff history, the Lakers floored the Blazers down the stretch in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.\n\nLos Angeles rallied from a 16-point deficit in the final 12 minutes, four seconds to win 89-84 on Sunday at the Staples Center, claim the Western Conference title 4-3, and deny the Blazers a trip to the NBA Finals.\n\n\"I have never seen one quite like that,\" Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. \"My condolences to Portland and also my congratulations on a great season and a very well-fought series.\"\n\nThe Lakers will open The Finals at home on Wednesday against the Indiana Pacers. Los Angeles, which trailed 71-55 late in the third quarter, outscored the Blazers 31-13 in the fourth. \"We realize we sort of made cowards of ourselves in the fourth quarter,\" Blazers forward Scottie Pippen said. \"We played like we were fatigued, and they gained the momentum they needed.\"\n\nIt was one of the worst collapses in Blazers' history and the worst in a seventh game of the West finals. It had to be more painful than the 4-0 sweep by the San Antonio Spurs in last year's conference finals.\n\nIn the 1992 Finals, the Blazers blew a 15-point lead in the fourth quarter of Game 6 at Chicago, and the Bulls won to close out the series in six games.\n\n\"Very similar,\" Jackson said. \"However, I had much more confidence in that team. They had won a championship.\"\n\nThey also had Michael Jordan.\n\nALL-TIME MELTDOWN\n\nThe loss was so stinging and debilitating, those who covered it knew immediately the memory would linger forever. Chuck Culpepper, The Oregonian’s sports columnist, likened it to a horror film during his Game 7 column.\n\nHorror films vary in length from the feature to the short subject; sometimes they're only about half an hour long. The horror film starring the Blazers on Sunday strings from the 10:28 mark of the fourth quarter of a quiet Game 7 through a final minute featuring 18,997 people in yellow shirts making thunder at the Staples Center. It features a 7 1/2-minute swatch where the basket snarls and throws back every Blazers shot attempt. It will rerun in snippets for weeks, for months, for years to come. It's bizarre. It's inexplicable. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\nThis relentless, uncompromising scare begins with the viewer lulled into a false sense of safety. The Blazers look like an NBA championship team. The score is 75-60. The building is serene. The people are thinking of leaving. Minds easily can picture Reggie Miller's lanky frame at the Rose Garden on Wednesday night for the start of the NBA Finals.\n\nThe beast comes from the dead. In one final, macabre plot turn, it roars back not only from hopelessness but from disarray. It comes from nowhere like some unpredicted dark sky packing an awful storm. And the Blazers prove they are not a championship team. They yield a 25-4 run. They execute, they get decent shots, but still somehow they choke, missing the same shots they had been making earlier. They \"make cowards of ourselves,\" as Scottie Pippen put it. They turn out to be a good team with enough good heart to rebound from a 3-games-to-1 deficit, but they lack only the \"special\" chromosome.\n\nThey end up like the guy who hits the ball to the centerfield wall, comes streaming around third, coasting for home, then trips 10 feet from the prize. Reporter Jason Quick, a year before he took over as the Blazers’ beat writer for The Oregonian, called the meltdown one of sports all-time greats in his sidebar that night.\n\nA 13-point lead, with 12 minutes left. A trip to the NBA Finals at stake.\n\nThen, boom.\n\nIt hits. Thirteen consecutive misses. Zero points over 7 minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nThe lead, once huge, is gone. And so, too, was the Trail Blazers' season.\n\nThe largest comeback in a seventh game of a Western Conference finals belongs to the Los Angeles Lakers, but really, the new NBA record book should come with an asterisk. The Blazers, probably more so than the Lakers, were responsible for creating the record.\n\n​\n\nWhen sports historians talk about the all-time collapses, the Blazers will be mentioned right alongside Greg Norman and his finish in the 1996 Masters. They will be mentioned in the same breath as Bill Buckner's error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series that opened the door for the New York Mets' championship. Right there with the Buffalo Bills, who allowed the Tennessee Titans to return a kickoff for a winning touchdown in the final minute during the 2000 playoffs.\n\n​\n\nIt was that bad.\n\nNO WORDS TO DESCRIBE FEELING\n\nIn Stoudamire’s final playoff diary in The Oregonian, he admitted being tongue-tied and downtrodden. The kid who grew up a couple neighborhoods away from Memorial Coliseum had returned to Rip City to try to bring a championship to his hometown.\n\nTo come so close — and feel so far — from the chance to fulfill his dream left Stoudamire stunned and emotional. I don't think too many of you will be surprised when I say this is the toughest column I have had to write during the playoffs. By far. It hurts right now. I am kind of blown away. We all sat in that locker room after Sunday's game in disbelief. There wasn't much anyone could say.\n\nYou go through so much in a season. For us to work so hard and get this far, and have it end like it ended ... I am searching for the right words to describe the feeling. Maybe there aren't any.\n\nI am still stunned by what happened in the fourth quarter. It was like, where did the lead go? We got a little tired at the end of our third-quarter run, but our feeling was, we have them on the ropes, let's just sustain this and we will be fine.\n\nThe way this one went down reminded me of Game 6 of the Portland-Chicago NBA Finals in 1992, when the Blazers went into the fourth quarter with a 15-point lead. Then all the Bulls' bench players started knocking down threes, and they came back with the starters, and there was no stopping them.\n\nKudos to the Lakers. It was a hard-fought series. They have a nice team. There are no quitters on their side. I know a lot of Blazer fans will say we were the better team. You know how we felt about that. Well, we can sit here and talk about us being the better team, but it doesn’t make any difference. We are going home, and we don’t have practice today. The Lakers are playing for the championship, not us.\n\nTHE DAY AFTER\n\nIt turns out Dunleavy didn’t just go home and chug a cold one after the game, searching for solace in suds and relaxation. No, instead, he plopped down on his couch at home that night and rewatched his team choke, subconsciously searching for the would’ve, could’ve and should’ve he insisted did not exist.\n\nWhat Dunleavy discovered was perhaps as surprising as the loss itself.\n\nThere were no glaring Blazers mistakes, he said. No obvious black eyes. They missed shots. The Lakers, in the end, were simply better. As the meltdown unfolded in front of his eyes for a second time in hours, he said he couldn’t identify anything he or the Blazers should have done differently. At least that’s what Dunleavy told The Oregonian’s Jim Beseda for a story Beseda wrote the day after the unforgettable playoff collapse: Even after going over the videotape at home Sunday night, Dunleavy could not pinpoint a reason for the Trail Blazers’ resounding and even a bit embarrassing collapse in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals.\n\nIt was a Los Angeles Lakers’ comeback so monumental, Jack Nicholson might even have rejected a script with the scenario in it — because it was unbelievable. Dunleavy asked himself all the pertinent questions. How did the Blazers let a 15-point lead slip away with just over 10 minutes to play?\n\nHow much of it could be attributed to a Blazers' collapse, and how much to the Lakers playing the fourth quarter as if a hotel operator had walked into the huddle and hollered: \"THIS IS YOUR WAKEUP CALL!\"? Was there anything the Blazers could have done different strategically ... other than make a few shots?\n\n​And, yes, will the Blazers be remembered as a team that choked, or as one that came back from a 3-1 series deficit to make it a series and fell just short?\n\n\"I take great solace in how well our guys played,\" he said. \"The fact was, we didn't make mistakes to lose that game. As a coach or as a player, you can always live with games you lose when you just don't make shots, because you can't guarantee that part of it. “Yeah, every now and then you might say, ‘I’d rather have not taken that long shot. Maybe I would have liked them to go to the basket a little bit more.’ But it was minute. It really was. It just didn’t happen for us.”\n\n— Joe Freeman | [email protected] | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ySDRAoE3Nc\n\nhttps://ripcityproject.com/2020/04/18/portland-trail-blazers-2000-lakers-fixed/\n\nhttps://ripcityproject.com/2020/04/18/portland-trail-blazers-2000-lakers-fixed/2/\n\nhttps://ripcityproject.com/2020/04/18/portland-trail-blazers-2000-lakers-fixed/3/\n\nhttps://ripcityproject.com/2020/04/18/portland-trail-blazers-2000-lakers-fixed/4/\n\nhttps://ripcityproject.com/2020/04/18/portland-trail-blazers-2000-lakers-fixed/5/\n\nhttps://bleacherreport.com/articles/2894431-bryantto-shaq-the-truth-about-the-lob-that-launched-a-dynasty\n\n​https://omny.fm/shows/the-full-48/bill-oram-on-the-2000-lakers-blazers-western-confe\n\n​\n\nJune 5\n\n1977\n\n1978\n\nThe @trailblazers are eyeing @IndStAthletics junior-eligible #LarryBird with 1 of their 2 top-7 picks in the coming 1978 @NBA Draft.\n\n​Portland currently has the 3rd and 7th picks for the draft slated for June 9\n\n1981\n\n​\n\n​The Blazers traded Tom Owens to the Indiana Pacers for a 1984 1st round draft pick.\n\nA little under a month after the release of her debut single Vision of Love, future best selling recording artist Mariah Carey performed a heavily acclaimed rendition of \"America the Beautiful\".\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjZZJieZkqI\n\nJune 6\n\n1999\n\nJune 7\n\nThe summer of 1984 found the Portland Trail Blazers stuck in the dreaded no-man’s-land of NBA mediocrity. They had just finished their fourth straight season with a win total in the 40’s. They were always good enough to make the playoffs, not great enough to succeed there. The second round was their ceiling, the first their floor, and the story never seemed to change.\n\n​\n\nJust making the post-season was good enough for many franchises. The Blazers and their Head Coach Jack Ramsay came from different stock. They remembered the World Championship earned seven years before. They wanted more. Portland won that title on the back of a superstar surrounded by excellent supplementary players. Their current lineup of Mychal Thompson, Kenny Carr, Fat Lever, Calvin Natt, Darnell Valentine, Wayne Cooper, and Jim Paxson provided plenty of the latter. Ramsay wanted a central scorer to pull the group together, a jump start to get the team out of the quagmire and back on the road to glory.\n\nWith the team’s limitations on full display, most everybody expected the Blazers to do something that summer. Nobody could have predicted the trade they actually made to fulfill Ramsay’s wish, though. The collective gasp on June 7th was audible on either side of the Cascades as the Blazers traded what seemed like half the team for Denver Nuggets forward Kiki Vandeweghe.\n\nThe 25-year-old small forward sported an impressive resumé. He had just finished the season scoring 29.4 points per game for the Nuggets, earning his second straight All-Star nomination. He was practically a deity on offense, tossing lightning bolts from any and all ranges. Still, there were doubts. Doug Moe’s Nuggets ran like crazy, scored like a pinball machine, and didn’t give a rat’s behind about defense. Your great grandma could probably post 20 for them cherry picking from her rocking chair. Despite Vandeweghe’s numbers, Denver only won 38 games. The Blazers themselves had done better. Would he really help that much?\n\nAnd wow...the price Portland paid. Calvin Natt was a stalwart, a 20-point producer. Fat Lever was an up-and-comer, Wayne Cooper a regular rotation center. Plus the Blazers sent two (2) draft picks??? Could any player be worth that much? As it turned out, Kiki was. Natt would become an All-Star. Lever would too, morphing into a triple-double machine. Cooper would start 324 games for the Nuggets over five seasons. Denver selected center Blair Rasmussen with Portland’s first-rounder; he’d play six seasons for them. Add it all together and Denver got 1525 games, 19416 points, 10055 rebounds, 4804 assists, 1644 steals, 1443 blocks, and three All-Star berths out of that deal, and that’s not even counting the playoffs. The Blazers still came out of it smelling like a rose. Vandeweghe was that good.\n\nKiki’s stats were enough to make even the most jaded fan vomit with joy. Instead of telling you which shots he could make, it’d be easier to tell you which ones he couldn’t. That would be none of them. A perimeter-oriented, volume-shooting small forward who hits 50% for a season raises eyebrows. Kiki shot 52.6% from the field over his entire five-year run in Portland. That’s enough to lift the hair right off your head. He did it while scoring 23.5 points per game. He averaged 88% from the foul line as well, drawing over 6 free throws each contest.\n\n​\n\nThe numbers become more impressive when you consider the company Vandeweghe kept. This was not Denver’s lineup, where—apart from an occasional post toss to Dan Issel—Vandeweghe and Alex English were free to put up a thousand shots, ignoring teammates. In addition to Paxson and Thompson, Kiki suited up with Clyde Drexler, Jerome Kersey, Terry Porter, and occasionally Sam Bowie. The team was stacked.\n\nKiki didn’t detract from the ensemble. His chemistry with Drexler was legendary. They’d play strong side-weak side ball to perfection. Clyde would drive and draw defenders then dish to the open Vandeweghe, or Kiki would threaten a shot and turn all eyes his way, only to toss to Drexler with a now-open lane in full view ahead. Results were predictable, but never got old.\n\nKiki also introduced Portland to the three-pointer. The shot had been around since 1979, but in the mid-80’s it was still considered half-gimmick. For most, it was a situational shot, used in desperation comebacks, last-minute deficits, and last-second buzzer-beaters. Serious players didn’t shoot from that range; traditional coaches seldom favored it. The distance was too far, the success rate too low. Vandeweghe’s three-point attempt rate of 1.0 per game in 1986-87 looks ludicrously small by today’s standards, but his 48.1% success rate for the season would make anybody stand up and take notice. It was more of a surprise to see him miss one than make it. Home crowds began to yell as soon as he caught the ball at the arc, swelling to a roar that rested on a long “e” vowel sound. Nobody was quite sure whether the Blazers faithful were screaming “three” or “Keeee-ki” but it hardly mattered. It all got lost in the riotous screams as the ball went through the twine. Vandeweghe would end up averaging 40.8% beyond the arc over five seasons with the Blazers.\n\nVandeweghe posted at least one forty-point game in each of his seasons in Portland except 1985-86. He only got to 38 that season. In his defense, he did score 30 or more on 23 separate occasions that year. That was also the season he averaged 24.8 points per game on 54% shooting, a jaw-dropping stat line that left him among the franchise elite. In the history of the franchise, only Damian Lillard has exceeded Vandeweghe’s points per game production, and that only by half a point so far. Kiki was no shrinking violet in the playoffs either. In 21 postseason performances for the Blazers over four years he averaged 21.1 points on 51.5% shooting, connecting on 94% of his free throws. Dude missed six foul shots total in four years of post-season play. That’s cold.\n\nThe only two knocks on Vandeweghe: a lack of defense (the Blazers knew what they were getting there, though) and the fact that Portland didn’t fare much better after his arrival than before. Had Bowie been healthy the story might have been different. As it was, Ramsay’s big scorer didn’t end up saving his coach’s job. Only once did the Blazers win 50 with Kiki on board. That was 1987-88, the year he got injured and played only half a season with severely limited minutes. Health, defensive issues, and the advent of Jerome Kersey at small forward began to weigh against Vandeweghe as the decade neared its close. With their star scorer not playing much (thus no longer scoring), the Blazers pulled the trigger on a midseason deal in 1989 that shipped Vandeweghe to New York for a draft pick.\n\nVandeweghe would never score 20 again, limping his way through four more years before retiring in 1993. He later became a coach with the Dallas Mavericks and New Jersey Nets. He served as General Manager for the Nuggets and Nets. He is currently the NBA’s Executive Vice President for Basketball Operations. The muted end to Vandeweghe’s Portland run doesn’t overshadow the eye-searing stats he produced in his prime. You only have to watch about five seconds of the videos below to see how good he was. For the threes, for ALL the points, for justifying one of the biggest trades in franchise history, and for all the fun with Clyde, Kiki Vandeweghe earns the 17th spot on our Top 100 list of Trail Blazers players and influencers. What a run.\n\nhttps://prohoopshistory.substack.com/p/kikis-curse\n\nJune 8\n\n​Geoff Petrie defends against Tom Henderson\n\n1978\n\nJune 9\n\n1978\n\nWhile the Blazers didn't get the chance to draft Larry Bird, they did select center-forward Mychal Thompson with the first pick and guard Ron Brewer with their second pick, seventh overall to add to the team with the best record in the NBA. \"It came down to Brewer and Bird for us.\" said Stu Inman as the Blazers second choice approached but the decision was made when the Boston Celtics selected Bird at number six.\n\n1981\n\nJeff Lamp drafted\n\nJune 10\n\n1980\n\nJune 11\n\nJune 12\n\nHappy Birthday to former Blazer guard @SergioRodriguez. Originally drafted by Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA draft, he was traded to Portland for cash considerations as the @Suns were in a cost cutting made.\n\n​https://www.hispanosnba.com/noticias/2014/05/08/ex-nba-sergio-rodriguez-rudy-fernandez-cinco-ideal-euroliga\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Fryer would embark upon a lengthy career as an NBA referee, beginning in 1978. By the time he retired in 2007, he had officiated 1806 regular season, 145 playoff, and 11 NBA Finals games as well as the 1998 All-Star Game.\n\nFryer was also one of three former NBA players (Leon Wood and Haywoode Workman) who officiated in the league. Fryer played an instrumental role in the league using video replay when during a 2002 playoff game between the Charlotte Hornets and Orlando Magic, Fryer and his officiating crew disallowed a field goal made by the Hornets' Baron Davis. Davis received an inbound pass with 0.7 seconds remaining and successfully made the shot before the buzzer sounded. This incident led CommissionerDavid Stern to consider the use of instant replay in NBA games.\n\nImmediately players from both benches came onto the floor, the Blazers believing the game was now tied and the Pistons believing otherwise. Veteran referee Earl Strom, calling his final NBA game, huddled the officials amid the din and signalled that the shot was too late. Videotaped replays later confirmed the accuracy of the call. The Blazers were down, three games to one.\n\n1992\n\nThe Bulls jumped out to a 10–2 lead and never looked back, answering every Blazers comeback attempt with a run of their own. Chicago opened the second half on a 16–8 run to give the Bulls a 20-point lead. Portland didn't pull back within single digits until less than four minutes were left in the game, and ended up losing 119–106.\n\n​\n\nMichael Jordan, who briefly sat with a bad ankle, finished with 46 points on 14-of-23 from the field and 16-of-19 from the line. Scottie Pippen fell just short of a triple-double, with 24 points, 11 rebounds and nine assists. Clyde Drexler scored 30 points to lead six Portland players in double figures. However, Portland had 18 turnovers and shot just 43.8 percent from the field, compared to 54.8 percent for the Bulls.\n\nJune 13\n\n1988\n\nArvydas Sabonis is featured in the June 13th issue of Sports Illustrated with possibility of his going the Blazers after the 1988 Olympics.\n\nJune 14\n\nDrexler began to go at Jordan in the second quarter with some success and a dunk and Portland especially began crashing the boards and taking away the inside from the Bulls. The Trail Blazers went on a 10-0 run to take a 43-28 lead and it began to look more and more like another seventh game after the Bulls were pushed to the edge by the Knicks in the conference semifinals. The Bulls continued to hang in, though, trailing 50-44 at halftime. But Portland was clearly the aggressor.\n\nThe Bulls opened the second half badly with turnovers and fell behind by 17. B.J. Armstrong made a pair of baskets to keep the game from getting away, but the Trail Blazers still led 79-64 entering the fourth quarter and 42-14 on inside points. But it all would change in an instant.\n\nJohn Paxson stripped even the usually reliable Terry Porter and Jordan would finish it up with a driving score and post up to begin the wild celebration, the first home celebration after a title victory for a Chicago team in decades. Oh, what a night it would be in anticipation now of three.\n\nJune 15\n\n1989\n\nSteve Johnson was selected by the expansion team Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nJune 16\n\nIn all, Adelman's record was 616-532 in 1148 games over 14 seasons w/@trailblazers.\n\n​https://www.blazersedge.com/2020/4/28/21238864/trail-blazers-all-time-top-players-list-countdown-rick-adelman-32\n\n1971\n\n​\n\nThe Blazers Rookie camp, starring Sidney Wicks and 12 other rookies, opens on June 14 and concludes when the team play against Japan's National Team win June 16.

TheABA–NBA merger needs to be approved by legal counsel\n\n1986\n\n​\n\n​Entering the 1986 NBA, the Portland Trail Blazers had the 14th and 24th picks and hoped to have a gem fall to them. What they didn't expect was to find Walter Berry, the NCAA College Player-of-the-Year from St. John's University, at 14 and were delighted to chose him. With the 24th pick, the last in the first round, the Blazers selected Russian center Arvydas Sabonis. The Blazers also drafted Dražen Petrović in the 3rd round.\n\nThe Blazers are also close to trading former No. 1 pick Mychal Thompson to the San Antonio Spurs for former Oregon State University player Steve Johnson.\n\nIn other draft day news, the Blazers traded Steve Colter to the Chicago Bulls for the rights to Larry Krystowiak and second round picks in 1987 and 1992. Colter averaged 8 pts and 3.1 assists in two seasons with Portland.\n\nJune 18\n\n1985\n\nThe Blazers were looking to draft a local in A.C. Green, the Benson Tech and Oregon State graduate, but the Los Angeles Lakers changed their plans when Green was selected with the 23rd pick so the Blazers had to settle for Terry Porter with the 24th, and last pick, of the first round.\n\nJune 19\n\n1984\n\nHaving lost the coin flip for the first pick to the Houston Rockets, and after acquiring All-Star Forward Kiki Vandeweghe just 12 days ago, the Blazers felt the need for a center and chose Sam Bowie from the Univ. of Kentucky with the second pick. The Blazers were hoping to select John Stockton or Vern Fleming with the 19th pick but were stymied when the Utah Jazz selected selected Stockton at 16 and Indiana chose Fleming at 18, leaving the Blazers to select Bernard Thompson with the 19th pick.\n\nIn the second round, Portland selected Victor Fleming (26), Steve Colter (33), and Jerome Kersey (46). All but Fleming, who never played in the NBA, played at least one season with the Blazers. Thompson played his rookie season with Portland before being traded and Colter lasted two years before he was traded. Kersey played 11 seasons with Portland and is ranked in the Top-10 in 15 statistical categories, among them are points, games, minutes, rebounds, and steals.\n\nThe 1984 draft class is considered to be one of the best in NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Starshooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139 games in five years with the Blazers.\n\n1986\n\nThe @trailblazers trade @champagnennuts to @spurs for former @BeaverMBB @stevejohnsonfm.

Sources say that #BuckWilliams is headed to #Blazers Also potentially coming to @NBA would be Russian players #ŠarūnasMarčiulionis, #AlexanderVolkov & @ArvydasSabonis.\n\nThe solid news though is Geoff Petrie has been named as Harry Glickman's assistant and Brad Greenberg has been named as Bucky Buckwalter's assistant.\n\n2017\n\nThe @trailblazers trade up to select @zcollins_33 of @ZagMBB. Collins played 2+ seasons w/#Blazers before signing w/@spurs where he currently plays\n\nJune 23\n\n1982\n\nThe @trailblazers acquired power forward #KennyCarr from the @DetroitPistons for the 18th pick in the coming 1982 @NBA #Draft. The pick was originally acquired when the Blazers traded Ron Brewer to the Spurs for Mike Gale and a 1982 1st round pick.\n\nA 5-year forward from @NCState, Carr was a member of the 1976 US Gold-medal winning @Olympics Basketball team in Montreal; a team that featured future #NBA players #AdrianDantley, #ScottMay, #MitchKupchak, #PhilFord, #WalterDavis, #QuinnBuckner, #PhilHubbard, and #ErnieGrunfeld.\n\nCarr was the 6th overall pick in the 1977 #NBADraft by the @Lakers but struggled as a backup forward in LA. He was traded to @Cavs, where he averaged 14 points and 9 rebounds in 2 1/2 seasons. Traded to the #Pistons and with his playing time cut in half, he stats did as well. With the addition of Carr, the Blazers are looking forward to possibly one more veteran to join the front line. Former @celtics legend #DaveCowens is still considered a possibility as #Boston would prefer him to move to a west coast team.\n\n1994\n\n@RealPJCarlesimo is hired as the Blazers coach, succeeding Rick Adelman who was released on May 19. Carlesimo coaching record with Portland was 137-109 record before he was let go in 1997.\n\nJune 24\n\n1989\n\nThe Blazers traded Sam Bowie to New Jersey Nets for Buck Williams\n\n1992\n\nOn this day Portland hosts the 1992 NBA Draft, Magic drafted Shaq\n\nIt was on this date in 1992 that Shaquille O'neal was selected with the first overall pick in the NBA Draft.\n\nBut did you know that Shaquille O'Neal was drafted in Portland?\n\nNot by Portland. In Portland.\n\nFor those of you that don't recall, the 1992 NBA was held inside Portland's Veterans Memorial Coliseum. It was the first time since 1959 that that draft had been held outside of New York City.\n\nAt the time, the draft was thought to be one of the deepest in NBA history. While the class as a whole didn't like up to expectations, there were some incredible standouts.\n\nThe top two picks ended up being all-time greats with O'Neal going to the Orlando Magic and Alonzo Mourning going to the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nPortland rolled out the red carpet and 8,000+ fans filled the same arena that had hosted the Portland Trail Blazers vs Chicago Bulls NBA Finals just a few week prior.\n\nThose fans not only saw O'Neal and Mourning go one-two, but they saw NCAA star and can't miss prospect Christian Laettner go No.3 overall to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nWhile many of the players in the draft had solid careers, it failed to produce many stars. In fact, only four players (O'Neal - 15x, Mourning - 7x, Sprewell - 4x, Gugliotta - 1x, and Laettner - 1x) ever made an All-Star team.\n\nThe best players in the draft would end up being O'Neal, Mourning, and Sprewell, with O'Neal and Mourning both being elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nThe two would team together in Miami in 2006 to win the NBA Championship.\n\nWhile he may not be a Hall of Famer, No.11 pick Robert Horry has most of the hardware in this class. By the time his career was over, he had seven NBA titles: Two with the Rockets in '94 and '95, a threepeat with Shaq and the Lakers from '00-'02, and two with the Spurs in '05 and '07.\n\nHorry is tied with Jim Loscutoff and Frank Ramsey for the fourth-most championship by a single player. But it should be noted that he is the only player with seven or more rings that didn't play for the 1963 Boston Celtics.\n\nThe NBA Draft changed host cities throughout the 90s before settling back in NYC for the 2001 draft. Since 2001, only two drafts have been held outside of New York, and those were both across the river in New Jersey.\n\nIt's been nearly 20 years since the NBA Draft was held away from the East coast, and 28 years since it settled in Portland. Rip City wouldn't be upset if it returned in the future.\n\nIf it never does, the city will always have June 24th, 1992 and the night the legendary Shaq officially became part of the NBA. ​​​\n\n1993\n\nThe Blazers trade Kevin Duckworth to Washington Bullets for Harvey Grant\n\n1998\n\nThe @DetroitPistons had the 11th pick in the 1998 @NBA Draft and selected @BonziWells who they then traded to the @trailblazers for a future pick. Wells played 310 games with Portland and scored 4112 points in that time.\n\nJune 25\n\nJune 26\n\nJune 27\n\n1970\n\n​\n\nThe Blazers hold their 1st rookie game\n\n2001\n\nIt was a busy day today as the @trailblazers hired #MauriceCheeks to be the #Blazers 10th Head Coach. Cheeks had been an Ast. Coach w/\n\n@sixers for past 6 seasons\n\n​The @trailblazers select @MSU_Basketball freshman @MacBo50 w/the 19th pick in @NBADraft. Randolph accidentally announced that #MauriceCheeks was new #Blazers coach when he was asked who in organization he had talked to by answering \"Coach Cheeks\"\n\nJune 28\n\n1973\n\nThe NBA card of Governors has limited the NBA All-Star team rosters to 12 instead of 14. This action will no longer have every team have at least one player selected to play in the annual game.\n\n1982\n\nThe Blazers traded point guard Kelvin Ransey to Dallas for center Wayne Cooper. Ransey was the 4th pick in the 1980 NBA draft and played 2 years with the Blazers, averaging 15.6 points and 7 assists in 158 games. Ransey passed for 555 assists in both seasons, with 41 games with 10 or more assists. Ransey played 1 year in Dallas before being traded to the New Jersey Nets, where he played 3 seasons before retiring due to injuries.\n\nCooper, a 4-year veteran, has played 2 seasons with the Golden State Warriors before having single seasons with the Utah Jazz and the Dallas Mavericks before joining the Blazers. Cooper played 2 years with the Blazers before he was traded in 1984 to the Denver Nuggets where he played 5 years before coming back to Portland prior to the 1989/90 season. He played 3 years before retiring after the 1991/92 season. Overall, Cooper averaged 6.1 points and 5 rebounds in his 5 seasons with Portland.\n\n1983\n\nPortland selected Clyde Drexler\n\n2006\n\nHeadlining the additions are two players widely regarded as among the draft's marquee players: Aldridge, a 6-foot-11 power forward from Texas, and Roy, a 6-6 shooting guard from Washington who was the Pacific-10 Conference player of the year.Aldridge, a lanky and athletic 21-year-old, was taken with the second pick by Chicago; the Blazers traded Khryapa --one of their most versatile players from last season --to the Bulls with the fourth pick, which the Blazers had used on Louisiana State forward Tyrus Thomas.\"Portland is the team I wanted to play for,\" Aldridge said. \"I like Coach Nate (McMillan) and his vision. He's about hard work and holding his players accountable. I feel like I'm going to fit in.\"\n\n​\n\nRoy, a dynamic guard who was widely considered the best all-around player in the draft, was selected by Minnesota with the sixth pick, then traded to Portland for Villanova guard Randy Foye, whom the Blazers drafted at No. 7, and cash considerations.\"Portland felt like their dream draft would be getting me and LaMarcus, and I thought that was great,\" Roy said. \"To me, it didn't matter where I had to go first. I just said, 'Do whatever you can to get me.' \"\n\nIn the second round, the Blazers were again active. They held the first pick in the second round, No. 31, and selected guard-forward James White from Cincinnati. White was then traded to Indiana for the rights to Florida State forward Alexander Johnson and second-round picks, one in 2007 and one in 2008. In turn, Johnson was traded to Memphis for a second-round pick in 2008.By the end of the draft, the Blazers lowered their average roster age to 24 years and stockpiled four future picks. The Blazers also traded a 2008 second-round pick to Boston as part of the trade involving Telfair and Ratliff.\n\nToronto selected Italian forward Andrea Bargnani with the top pick after it unsuccessfully tried to trade the pick before the draft. Bargnani, a 7-footer who is valued for his outside shooting, is the first European player taken with the top pick.\n\nDickau was traded after the season to Golden State for Nick Van Exel before he moved on to Dallas, New Orleans, and finally Boston before coming back to Portland\n\n​\n\nhttps://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/may/17/former-gonzaga-star-dan-dickaus-ties-to-portland-t/\n\nJune 29\n\n1982\n\n​The Blazers select Fat Lever\n\n1994\n\nThe Blazers, with new coach P. J. Casrlesimo at the helm, selected Aaron McKie of Temple with their 1st round pick.\n\nJune 30"
