        "text": "The Golden State Warriors have a busy summer ahead. Mike Dunleavy Jr. must make decisions on Chris Paul’s future and Klay Thompson’s impending free agency. He’s also expected to be active in the trade market as the Warriors look to inject fresh talent into their roster as they bid to bounce back from a difficult season.\n\nHowever, Dunleavy believes that Golden State’s best path to legitimate improvement will come from within. During a pre-draft news conference on Monday (June 24,) Dunleavy noted how internal development will be key to Golden State’s chances of making an impact next season.\n\nGolden State has an impressive group of young talent, with Jonathan Kuminga headlining that contingent. Brandin Podziemski, Trayce Jackson-Davis and Moses Moody were all impressive last season, too. With that being said, internal development will undoubtedly be a core part of the Warriors growth heading into next season.\n\nNevertheless, there is still a clear-cut need for some fresh talent within the Warriors roster. As such, Warriors fans will likely be hoping Dunleavy can make a trade to help expedite the team’s improvements and put them back in contention for a championship next season. Otherwise another year of Steph Curry’s career could be wasted as the front office tries to navigate a re-tooling."
