        "text": "The Portland Trail Blazers have been a franchise since 1970. During that time they have had great players and it has resulted in 10 players having their numbers retired in Moda Center. Despite only one NBA championship in nearly 50 years of existence, there are many players who deserve a spot on the Portland Trail Blazers all-time team.\n\nAll-Time Portland Trail Blazers\n\nStarting Five\n\nPoint Guard – Damian Lillard\n\nDamian Lillard is on pace to be the greatest player in franchise history. Some would argue that he already is. That made this an easy choice for the all-time starting point guard for the Blazers.\n\nHe has stayed loyal to Portland regardless of what has happened. On top of that, he has been by far the best player during this era of Trail Blazers basketball and has been past the first round three times. Twice with teams that overachieved.\n\nLillard also sent the Oklahoma City Thunder into a complete rebuild.\n\nShooting Guard – Clyde Drexler\n\nA great argument could be made for Clyde Drexler being the greatest Blazer. He played parts of 12 seasons in Portland and during that time he filled up the stat sheet, averaging 20.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 2.0 steals per game.\n\nDrexler made eight All-Star games as a member of the Blazers and although he couldn’t lead them to a title, he did lead the franchise to two NBA Finals appearances before being traded to the Houston Rockets and finally getting his title.\n\nHe is also one of the top shooting guards in the history of the league.\n\nIf Drexler could’ve led Portland to a title, he’d undoubtedly be the top Blazer of all-time.\n\nSmall Forward – Scottie Pippen\n\nIncluding Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen on a list of all-time great Blazers could be considered controversial. He played the majority of his career with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nHowever, Pippen did play four seasons in Portland and he is one of the top two-way players in league history.\n\nHe didn’t play in Portland during the most productive years of his career. But Scottie Pippen was still effective while playing for the Blazers. And Portland almost made it to an NBA Finals in 1999-00 where he started all 82 games.\n\nPower Forward – LaMarcus Aldridge\n\nIt’s been four full seasons since LaMarcus Aldridge left Portland in free agency for the San Antonio Spurs. Even though Blazers fans experienced hard feelings when he left, Aldridge was great while playing for the franchise.\n\nAldridge made four All-Star Games in nine seasons in Portland.\n\nDuring those nine seasons, Aldridge scored 12,562 points and was efficient, shooting 48.5 percent his time in Portland.\n\nKnown for his patented shooting touch, Aldridge was arguably the best player on the 2013-14 team that was the first Portland team to make it past the first round of the playoffs since the 1999-00 conference finals season.\n\nCenter – Arvydas Sabonis\n\nArvydas Sabonis isn’t a Hall of Fame center just by looking at his NBA numbers. However, he didn’t come over to the NBA until he was 31-years old.\n\nDuring his NBA career, Sabonis only averaged 12 points per game, but he was very efficient and was one of the first centers to start shooting three-pointers.\n\nThere’s a reason Sabonis is in the Basketball Hall of Fame. If he would’ve come to the United States much earlier in his career he’d be viewed as one of the best centers in league history.\n\nSabonis also had one of the better stat lines ever produced on April 6, 2001, against the Golden State Warriors. Keep in mind that he was 36-years old while watching the highlights below.\n\nBench\n\nGuard – Terry Porter\n\nTerry Porter is one of the more beloved Blazers of all-time, but he’s not quite the player that Drexler was or Lillard currently is.\n\nPorter could shoot the ball well, scoring 14.9 points per game and shooting 38.5 percent from three while in Portland. He also filled up the stat sheet recording seven assists per game and grabbing 3.5 rebounds per game in his 10 seasons in Portland.\n\nEven though Porter is coming off the bench, he deserves his respect as the second-best point guard in franchise history.\n\nGuard – Geoff Petrie\n\nGeoff Petrie was the first great player in franchise history. He averaged over 24.0 points per game three times in only six seasons in Portland.\n\nHe put up good numbers and although he wasn’t on the 1977 championship team, he helped set up that run and the future success of the franchise.\n\nForward – Clifford Robinson\n\nIt’s a disgrace that Clifford Robinson only made one All-Star Game during his career. In eight seasons in Portland, Robinson scored 10,405 points and he was one of the first players that could be considered a stretch-four.\n\nDuring his time Robinson put up good numbers, but if he were to play in today’s NBA, he could put up better numbers because of his ability to shoot.\n\nRobinson could also play on the defensive side of the floor, making two All-Defensive teams. He also won a Sixth Man of the Year award. There’s not much Robinson didn’t do.\n\nForward – Bill Walton\n\nIf Bill Walton didn’t deal with chronic foot injuries during his career he’d be one of the best power forwards of all-time. Even with the foot injuries, he has to be on the Portland Trail Blazers all-time team.\n\nHe’s one of the more loveable Blazers of all-time. Even though his time to play in the league was limited, he is in the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nNot only is he a Hall of Famer but Walton was a key piece on the 1977 title-winning team.\n\nCenter – Maurice Lucas\n\nMaurice Lucas has a case to be the starting center on a Portland Trail Blazers all-time team. He only played five seasons in Portland, but Lucas was the best player in the 1976-77 season where the franchise won their only NBA title.\n\nDiscounting his final season in Portland because it was his final in the league after a long hiatus from playing in Portland, Lucas was nearly a 20 point-10 rebound per game player.\n\nLucas was a great player, one of the best in franchise history. That, combined with him being the best player during the franchises only title-winning season, gives him an automatic spot on the Portland all-time team."
