        "text": "The answer to one of the most pressing questions heading into next week’s NBA Draft came to light early Friday morning.\n\nMike Dunleavy Jr. has agreed to a deal to become the Warriors’ next general manager, the team announced.\n\nWarriors owner Joe Lacob didn’t have to go far to find the “perfect fit” to succeed Bob Myers, who announced last month that he’d be stepping away from the team after 12 years and four titles. Dunleavy, 42, appeared to be a logical replacement for Myers as the two have worked closely together over the last five years, with Dunleavy working his way up from scout to Myers’ right-hand man.\n\nDunleavy, the Warriors’ No. 3 overall draft pick in 2002 as a player, most recently served as the vice president of basketball operations, stepping in to cover some of Myers’ duties at times. Dunleavy represented the Warriors at general manager meetings and helped handle some of the team’s recent transactions.\n\nLacob lauded Dunleavy for his wealth of basketball knowledge and said he believes his new general manager is ready to step up to the plate.\n\n“He’s young and energetic, has established numerous relationships around the league and communicates well with players and coaches—all important traits in this business,” Lacob said in a written statement. “Mike’s ready for this challenge and responsibility.”\n\nSteve Kerr, who served three seasons as the Phoenix Suns’ general manager more than a decade ago, said it’s “critical” to have a tight-knit relationship between the GM and head coach. Kerr was extremely close with Myers, whom he still considers a close friend. But Kerr said the team’s familiarity with Dunleavy, who has been around for a few years now, provides a comfort level and trust amongst the coaching staff and players with the new man in charge.\n\n“Everybody’s excited,” Kerr said in a phone interview Friday morning. “I’m really excited to work with Mike. There’s a lot of trust, and over the last three years, we’ve had a lot of work together and that matters. So we have a foundation that’s built already, we trust each other and we’re going to work really well together.”\n\nThe Warriors are expected to host a news conference Monday to officially announce Dunleavy as the team’s next general manager in the lead-up to next Thursday’s draft.\n\nDunleavy and executive vice president of basketball operations Kirk Lacob appeared to have been running the show for the last month. Lacob is also expected to take on an elevated role since Myers served as both the team’s general manager and president of basketball operations.\n\nDunleavy and the Warriors’ front office have a key offseason ahead as they try to capitalize on Stephen Curry’s prime, despite having little flexibility to add pieces after the team suffered a second-round playoff exit one year after winning the title. And that’s where the challenge comes in: How will Dunleavy manage Golden State’s skyrocketing payroll and luxury tax bill and find ways to improve the roster at a time when the new collective-bargaining agreement clamping down on high-rolling teams?\n\nThere are several other items that will need to be sorted out, too. Draymond Green’s future is in limbo, and ESPN’s Marc Spears reported Friday that he is expected to opt out of his $27.6 player option. There’s belief within the Warriors’ organization, though, that he will return, likely on an extension. Klay Thompson is also entering the final season of his current deal and extension eligible.\n\nThe Warriors hold the No. 19 overall pick in Thursday’s draft, which they can’t trade until draft night because of a rule that requires teams to make a first-round selection at least every other year.\n\nMyers, who seemed to be preparing Dunleavy for this role over the last few years, gave his stamp of approval to Dunleavy during his exit interview.\n\n“Well, Mike’s great,” Myers said May 30. “He’s a good GM, if he wants it, it will be great… He knows more about basketball than I do. He grew up in it. He was born into it with his dad; he played in it.”\n\nDunleavy was drafted third overall in 2002 out of Duke, and faced pressure and, ultimately, significant frustration from the fanbase as another top draft pick who could not bring the team out of the NBA’s basement. Dunleavy spent his first four-plus seasons with Golden State and played a total of 15 seasons with six teams. Myers hired him as a scout in 2018 and he became the VP of basketball operations in 2021.\n\nDunleavy’s father, Mike Dunleavy Sr., was a longtime executive and coach with the Lakers, Trail Blazers and Clippers. He won Coach of the Year in 1999 with Portland."
