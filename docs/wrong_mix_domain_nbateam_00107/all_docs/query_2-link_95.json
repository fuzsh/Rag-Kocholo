        "text": "If you are wondering how to listen to the Olympics, iHeartRadio has you covered. iHeartRadio is the exclusive audio home of NBC's coverage of the 2024 Paris Olympics, so it is the only place to listen to the Olympics stream. The free iHeart app is where to go to listen to exclusive play-by-play action of Team USA. To celebrate, we are spotlighting some of the country's athletes that are vying for gold.\n\nBorn on March 14, 1988, in Akron, Ohio, Stephen Curry is an American professional basketball player who has led the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA) to championships in 2014–15, 2016–17, 2017–18, and 2021–22. He also led the team to the best regular-season record in league history (73–9) in 2015–16.\n\nCurry's father, Dell Curry, was a 16-year NBA veteran sharpshooter, and it was from him that the younger Curry learned the intricacies of the game. Despite his keen shooting and high \"basketball IQ,\" Curry did not receive scholarship offers from major college basketball programs due to his wiry frame and unremarkable 6-foot height. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina, where he quickly made his mark, averaging 21.5 points per game as a freshman to lead all first-year players in the country.\n\nCurry became a national sensation during his sophomore season, when he led 10th-seeded Davidson on an improbable run to the Elite Eight of the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s top-division basketball championship tournament. His junior season saw him lead the country with an average of 28.6 points per game, and he was named a consensus first-team All-American. He then entered the 2009 NBA draft, in which he was selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick.\n\nCurry made an immediate impact with the Warriors, becoming the team’s starting point guard and averaging 17.5 points per game in his first season. He led the league in three-pointers made (272) in 2012–13. The following season he repeated that feat (with 261) and earned his first All-Star selection. In 2014–15 he made a then-record 286 three-pointers while leading the Warriors to an NBA-best 67–15 record and was named the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP).\n\nIn 2015–16, Curry led his team to even greater heights, as Golden State bested the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls’ 72–10 regular-season record by one additional victory. He also topped the NBA with an average of 30.1 points per game and shattered his own league standard by making an astounding 402 three-point shots. Curry earned his second consecutive MVP award for his efforts and became the first person to be voted MVP unanimously.\n\nIn December 2021, Curry made yet another mark in the NBA history books by scoring his 2,974th career three-pointer, breaking the NBA record for all-time three-point field goals scored. As of the end of the 2022–23 season, Curry's three-point record stands at 3,390 regular-season three-pointers, a figure that exceeds 4,000 for his career when including his 690 playoff three-pointers. With an incredible 42.8 per cent success rate from beyond the arc, Curry is widely regarded as one of the greatest shooters and scorers in NBA history, making him an asset to Team USA."
