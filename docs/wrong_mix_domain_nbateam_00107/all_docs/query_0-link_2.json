        "text": "Mike Dunleavy had come a long way from Brooklyn. He was at the\n\nHarvard Club, in midtown Manhattan, all leather chairs and low\n\nvoices. He was there to tell NBA war stories to a couple dozen\n\nbusinessmen over lunch, fellow graduates of Nazareth Regional\n\nHigh in East Flatbush. Dunleavy played with Julius Erving and\n\nagainst Michael Jordan, and he coached Magic Johnson. He's an\n\ninsider's insider. But in the middle of his talk, Dunleavy\n\nstrayed from the pro game and made a passing comment about his\n\nson Mike Jr., then 17 years old. \"He's tall, he's good, he's\n\nbright,\" the coach said. \"You'll be seeing him.\" The men in the\n\nroom knew Dunleavy, knew he was not a braggart. They took note.\n\nThat was two years ago, when Dunleavy was in his first season as\n\ncoach of the Trail Blazers and his oldest son was a junior at\n\nJesuit High, a private school in Portland. Big Mike, 45, is\n\nstill coach of the Blazers, who at week's end had a 42-11\n\nrecord, the best in the NBA. As for the kid, he's grown into\n\nmore than an aside. Little Mike--who at 6'7\" has a good four\n\ninches on his father--is a freshman at Duke, playing guard and\n\nforward. He's the first player off the bench, and through Sunday\n\nhe was averaging 25.2 minutes, 9.5 points and 4.2 rebounds for\n\nthe second-ranked Blue Devils. Though tests last weekend\n\nrevealed that Mike Jr. has mononucleosis (he hopes to be back by\n\nthe start of the ACC tournament on March 9), Mike Sr. was\n\ncorrect. You'll be seeing him--if you haven't already.\n\nIt doesn't always work out this way. Being the kid of the coach\n\nis like being the son of the minister. You're expected to be\n\ndutiful and perfect and follow in Dad's footsteps. Often, the\n\nexpectations are too weighty and the son wanders off to find a\n\ncareer and an identity of his own. But in this case the son\n\nalways loved what his father loved, and he was good at it too.\n\nWherever Big Mike went, Little Mike went--to shootarounds, to\n\npractices, to games in college gyms and NBA arenas. Mike Jr. was\n\nforever on the floor or in the stands, watching, experimenting,\n\ndreaming. Mike Jr. will not be wandering off. \"Saw your boy\n\nmaking a Dr. J move last night,\" a Portland player recently told\n\nhis coach. \"Where'd he learn that?\"\n\nNot from the old man. When Dunleavy left South Carolina with a\n\ndegree in psychology and joined the Philadelphia 76ers as a\n\nsixth-round pick in 1976-77, his job was to take the charge,\n\nmake the smart pass and hole the open jumper. He did that with\n\nhigh competence if not highlight-reel flair for nine seasons,\n\naveraging 8.1 points per game for four teams. After two years as\n\na trader with a New York investment firm, he joined the\n\nMilwaukee Bucks as an assistant; in the stretch runs of 1988-89\n\nand '89-90 he even came out of retirement to help out in the\n\nbackcourt. In his first season as a head coach, 1990-91, his Los\n\nAngeles Lakers reached the Finals, in which they lost to the\n\nChicago Bulls. In those waning days of Showtime, Magic Johnson\n\nmade two new friends: the Dunleavys, big and little.\n\n\"Little Mike wasn't your regular gym rat,\" Johnson says. \"When\n\nthe kids got chased off the court [at practice], they'd all\n\nscamper, but Mike would sit in the stands and study the game.\n\nWhen I see him playing now, I see a freshman with the court\n\nsense of a senior or an NBA rookie. He'll play in the league, no\n\nquestion. He's got Larry Bird's shot, my passing game and his\n\nfather's smarts.\"\n\nDunleavy Jr. throws a Magical no-look pass and also hurls a\n\nJohnson-style baseline-to-baseline outlet bomb. He learned some\n\nother things from Johnson: that a shooter can rebound, that a\n\nbig man can dribble, that life is fickle. Little Mike was 11 on\n\nthat grim November day nine years ago when Johnson announced he\n\nwas HIV-positive. Big Mike had learned the awful news the night\n\nbefore the world did. Johnson's agent, Lon Rosen, had gone over\n\nto the Dunleavys' house to tell him. Mike's wife, Emily, and\n\ntheir three boys, Mike Jr., Baker and James, were asleep. \"When\n\nI told Mike, the only thing he worried about was Earvin,\" Rosen\n\nsays. \"What the loss of Earvin meant to his team--that was the\n\nfurthest thing from his mind. Then, much later, he says, 'What\n\nam I going to tell the kids? What am I going to tell Mike [Jr.]?'\"\n\nThe next day the father explained Johnson's plight as candidly\n\nand succinctly as he could. Magic was not so much Mike Jr.'s\n\nidol as his big buddy. Little Mike's first thought was that his\n\nbig buddy would be dead in three or four years. He was\n\nterrified. The entire Dunleavy household sagged. \"I remember Dad\n\ncoming back after the press conference,\" Mike Jr. says. \"He was\n\nwearing sunglasses in the house. He didn't want us to see his\n\neyes. I had never seen him weep before. I tried to act like\n\nnothing was happening. I never want people to worry about me.\"\n\nThe Dunleavys are a tight unit. The parents say that frequent\n\nmoves--Mike Jr. lived in a dozen houses before graduating from\n\nhigh school--have made the family members uncommonly reliant on\n\none another. During the family's two years in Los Angeles,\n\nLittle Mike and his brothers thought they were in heaven: The\n\nsun shone, the ocean glistened, their father was the coach of\n\nthe Lakers. At the end of the 1991-92 season, though, father\n\nDunleavy was handed a rare opportunity: an eight-year contract\n\nto be the coach and vice president of basketball operations back\n\nin Milwaukee, a city whose solid Midwestern values the Dunleavys\n\nknew well. The parents told the kids it was for the best, for\n\neverybody. Little Mike wasn't thrilled at the news. But he\n\ndidn't fuss. He never did.\n\nMike Jr. enrolled at the University School of Milwaukee, an\n\nacademically superior private school. All through middle school\n\nhe excelled at soccer, football, basketball, tennis, baseball,\n\nhis studies. He made friends. Everywhere he went, people were\n\nimpressed by his poise, his intelligence, his manners. He took\n\nneither his privilege nor his talents for granted. \"I'd see him\n\nat Bucks games,\" says Garry Howard, sports editor of the\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"He'd say, 'How are you, Mr.\n\nHoward?' And I was like, Whoa--from a coach's kid!\"\n\nAll the while, another dimension of the boy was developing. The\n\nkid's polish and manners masked a grittiness that his father had\n\ndeveloped on the playgrounds of Brooklyn, that his paternal\n\ngrandfather had brought over from Ireland. Little Mike knew\n\nearly on that he didn't want to be another suburban rich kid\n\nwith a pretty jumper but no heart, and he did all that he could\n\nto make sure of that. People who play tennis with Mike Jr. on\n\nNantucket--Emily Dunleavy's Texas family has been spending\n\nsummers on the island since World War I--say he is a bull\n\nterrier. Like his father, he has to win, no matter what he's\n\nplaying.\n\nAs a freshman at University, Dunleavy started on the varsity and\n\nbecame close with the team's sixth man, classmate Fred Bell, a\n\nscholarship kid from Milwaukee. Bell would sometimes spend the\n\nnight at the Dunleavys' house in River Hills, one of Milwaukee's\n\nmost affluent suburbs. On Saturdays when the Bucks were at home,\n\nFred, Mike Jr. and Mike Sr. would play one-on-one in the\n\ndriveway, winner keeps the court. Mike would hack, talk a little\n\ntrash, do whatever he had to do. Mike Sr., that is. \"It wouldn't\n\nget to fistfights,\" says Bell, now a freshman on the basketball\n\nteam at Lake Forest College, outside Chicago. \"But he played us\n\nlike he was playing Michael Jordan.\"\n\nThe father has never been a passive observer of his oldest son's\n\nathletic life. Mike Sr. was impressed with a University teacher,\n\nDave Liccione, who coached Little Mike's seventh-grade\n\nbasketball team. When Little Mike was a freshman, his father\n\nurged the school to make Liccione the varsity coach. Liccione\n\ngot the job, started Mike Jr. and improved the team's record by\n\nfive games. But when the season was over he was relieved of his\n\ncoaching duties. Two school officials declined to discuss the\n\nfiring, but Liccione knows what he was told. \"They said I was\n\ntoo intense,\" he says.\n\nMike Jr. was floored. He loved playing for Liccione, who told\n\nhim something his father never had--that he was talented enough\n\nto play for a Kentucky, a Duke, a big-time program. Mike and\n\nFred resolved to transfer to a public high school, Homestead.\n\nMike Jr. knew that the transfer would mean he'd have to sit out\n\nhis sophomore basketball season. But Liccione's firing had\n\nangered him. He had to leave. That's what he told his parents.\n\n\"I was proud of him,\" the father says. \"He thought the coach was\n\nbeing treated unfairly, so he took a stand. It was his decision.\n\nI respected it.\"\n\nIn the summer before he was a junior, after sitting out his\n\nsophomore year, Mike Jr.'s father took the coaching job in\n\nPortland, and the family was on the move again. No fussing from\n\nLittle Mike, of course. At Jesuit he blossomed. Named all-state\n\nas a junior, he averaged 23 points and 8 rebounds as a senior,\n\nleading his team to the Class 4A title and winning MVP honors in\n\nthe state tournament.\n\nPulitzer Prize winner David Halberstam, a friend of the\n\nDunleavys on Nantucket and the author of three books on\n\nbasketball, has observed the Mikes together over the years.\n\n\"It's very hard to be the son of a famous father and in the same\n\nprofession,\" Halberstam says. \"In this case the son of a famous\n\nfather has skills that may be even more natural than the\n\nfather's, and he goes naturally down the same course.\"\n\nAccording to Halberstam, Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski told the\n\nsenior Dunleavy that he wanted Mike Jr. more than any player\n\nsince Grant Hill. Coach K knew that the boy's playpen had been a\n\nbasketball court, that his early tutorials had come from NBA\n\npros. Junior's regal basketball education might have intimidated\n\nsome coaches, but Krzyzewski embraced it. \"His maturity has had\n\na lot to do with why we've been successful this year,\"\n\nKrzyzewski says. \"He understands what I say during practice,\n\nduring timeouts. He gets my dry sense of humor. Most freshmen\n\nare afraid to talk. He's not, because he knows what's going on.\"\n\nThis has been an odd basketball season for the Mike Dunleavys,\n\nbig and little. Except for rare occasions, they see each other\n\nonly on TV and talk to each only over the phone. Back in\n\nPortland, Emily runs a family press service, keeping her husband\n\nabreast of the basketball activities of Baker, 17, a junior on\n\nthe Jesuit varsity, and James, 12, a rec league player, when\n\nMike Sr. is on the road. He waits until he's back home to watch\n\nthe Duke games that he has taped.\n\nWhen Mike Jr. knocked down two overtime free throws to help seal\n\na Blue Devils victory over North Carolina recently, Mike Sr. was\n\non a plane, flying to yet another road game, thinking up new\n\nways to parcel out minutes among the highly paid Blazers and to\n\nkeep forward Rasheed Wallace out of foul trouble. Last week,\n\nwith Mike Jr. playing despite his illness, Duke clinched at\n\nleast a share of its fourth straight ACC title, while Mike Sr.'s\n\nteam stretched its winning streak to eight. Come May, his\n\nfreshman year done, Little Mike will fly west to Portland,\n\nhoping to join his father as the Blazers march to the NBA\n\nFinals. If the Blazers don't get that far, he'll still head to\n\nPortland. That's where his family is now. That makes it home.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY BILL FRAKES BE LIKE MIKE He may be the younger Dunleavy, but at 6'7\", Little Mike has four inches on his 45-year-old father.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: BOB DONNAN AIR BORN While Mike Jr.'s off to a flying start as Duke's sixth man, it was grit and savvy that kept Mike Sr.'s pro career afloat for nine years.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: ANDY HAYT [See caption above]"
