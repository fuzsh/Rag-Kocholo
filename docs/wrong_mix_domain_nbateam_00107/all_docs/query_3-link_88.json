        "text": "Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images\n\nAfter the Golden State Warriors play-in loss that kept them out of playoff contention, general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr. expressed his desire to keep Klay Thompson and Draymond Green around next season.\n\nThompson is entering free agency this offseason, but Dunleavy said he feels confident that the shooting guard will remain with Golden State.\n\n\"I think it's a mutual feeling,\" Dunleavy said on Thursday. \"The guy's been here a long time, he means so much to the organization. We really value him, so there's nothing that would make me think that he wants to go somewhere else or we don't want him back. For that reason, I'm hopeful we can make it happen, but it's a deal. Both sides have to be good with it, and we'll work through that.\"\n\nDunleavy expressed a similar sentiment about Green, who is under contract through at least 2025-26, saying that \"he can't imagine a scenario\" where Green isn't with the Warriors next season.\n\nBoth Thompson and Green have been integral to the Warriors' dynasty, but neither had the most memorable 2023-24 season.\n\nThompson averaged 17.9 points per game, which was his lowest mark since the 2012-12 season. In Golden State's play-in loss, he didn't score and went 0-of-10 from the field, raising questions about whether he can be valuable for the Warriors moving forward.\n\nGreen averaged 8.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and six assists per game this year, but was a liability to the team due to a pair of suspensions. He faced a five-game suspension in November and an indefinite suspension just six games after his return. He missed 16 games during his indefinite suspension, and the Warriors went 8-8 during that stretch.\n\nThompson will likely be the main focus this offseason as he enters free agency. He has already been linked to the Dallas Mavericks and Orlando Magic, and will likely get more interest over the next few months.\n\nThe Warriors need a change to become Finals contenders again, and that change could involve breaking up the trio of Thompson, Green and Steph Curry eventually. For now, Dunleavy plans to keep them together."
