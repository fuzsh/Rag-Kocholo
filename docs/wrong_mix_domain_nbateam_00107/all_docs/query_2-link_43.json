        "text": "CHALLENGE:\n\nA lack of diversity among leadership and program staff limits the experience and the value for everyone.\n\nHOW TRAIL BLAZERS APPROACHES THIS WORK:\n\nIn 2020, Trail Blazers made a commitment to being an actively anti-racist organization and we have spent the past year laying the groundwork needed to support this work and move us forward.\n\nWe started by lifting up DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), which was one of the four Strategic Lenses identified in our Jan 2020 Strategic Plan, as our primary lens and then adding “B” for Belonging. To guide our work and to hold us accountable to our goals, we convened a DEIB committee that comprises board members, staff, an alumna, a community partner, and is supported by expert consultants. To institutionalize DEIB as a core and essential part of Trail Blazers, we integrated DEIB into our Mission and Vision statements, ensuring that it will guide how we govern, lead, communicate, operate, and interact. Furthermore, as our Primary Strategic Lens, DEIB will serve as our primary guide as we continue to operationalize our Strategic Plan and monitor its effectiveness through 2025.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nVisit our dedicated DEIB page for details on our work in this area.\n\nCHALLENGE:\n\nYoung people need to get outside, being outdoors for the sake of being outdoors, including opportunities for fresh air, exercise, and improved mental health\n\nHOW TRAIL BLAZERS SUPPORTS FAMILIES:\n\nTrail Blazers’ nature-based programs fully integrate the outdoors into our design. We believe there is no such thing as bad weather, just inadequate clothes. Furthermore, diverse staff and leadership help campers see that people of all backgrounds belong and should feel comfortable outdoors. Across all programs, over 70% of participants demonstrated increased nature affinity.\n\nWHAT THE RESEARCH SAYS\n\nContinued participation in outdoor play and nature-based activities during the pandemic buffered adolescents against declines in their well-being, resulting in post COVID-19 well-being scores similar to pre COVID-19 scores.- NCBI\n\n“93% of [New York] Parents report that opportunities to experience the outdoors was important in selecting their child’s structured summer experience” –After School Alliance\n\n“Learning in nature is proven to support improved relationship skills and reduced stress, anger, and aggression”"
