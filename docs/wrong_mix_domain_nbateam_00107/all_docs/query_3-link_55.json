        "text": "The New York Knicks and head coach Tom Thibodeau have agreed to a three-year contract extension through the 2027-28 season.\n\nNew York went 50-32 last season to earn the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the semi-finals of the play-offs.\n\nThe Knicks were also ousted in the East semis in 2022-23 and reached the play-offs during Thibodeau’s first season in 2021-22, when he won his second NBA Coach of the Year award.\n\nPrior to 2021-22, New York’s previous post-season appearance came in 2013.\n\nThe Knicks have gone 175-143 over the last four seasons under Thibodeau, who earned his first NBA Coach of the Year award in 2011 as a rookie head coach with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe 66-year-old Thibodeau owns a 527-389 record in 12 seasons as a head coach with Chicago, the Minnesota Timberwolves and New York.\n\nHis teams have gone 38-47 in the post-season, and Thibodeau’s only appearance in the conference finals came in his rookie head coach season.\n\nWith a robust investment from Restaurants of Jamaica Limited, the 2024 Jamaican Basketball Association Star Search Basketball and Life Skills Camp soared to new heights, attracting increased participation from young basketball enthusiasts and drawing attention from international scouts. This initiative, designed to identify and nurture emerging basketball talent, brought together hundreds of Jamaica’s youth for a memorable week-long camp, culminating last Friday at the G.C Foster College in St. Catherine.\n\nKFC's significant contribution—JMD $2 million in cash and JMD$1 million in meal sponsorship—enabled young athletes to benefit from the expertise of seasoned coaches while exploring opportunities for scholarships to study and play overseas, potentially paving their way to professional basketball careers at the highest level.\n\nAmong the standout participants, Joel Ricketts of Wolmer’s Boys and Bri’an Barrow of Immaculate Conception High were honored with the camp’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. “It was an exciting experience,” Ricketts said. “I never expected to earn this award but I put my best foot forward and ensured I had fun at every step of the way.”\n\nInternational scouts, who regularly attend the camp to identify new talent, were equally impressed. Chief Scout Mark Cooke, based in the U.S., remarked, “The level of talent here is phenomenal. These young athletes have demonstrated exceptional skill and determination. It’s been a privilege to work with them and help them reach their potential.”\n\nKFC’s sponsorship has delivered immediate benefits to the camp participants and has also made a significant impact on the broader community. By supporting initiatives like the Star Search Basketball Programme, KFC is paving the way for young athletes to achieve their dreams and build brighter futures.\n\nAndrei Roper, Marketing Manager at Restaurants of Jamaica, expressed his enthusiasm for the camp’s success. \"We're grateful for another fantastic year of Star Search. This program is near and dear to our hearts at KFC as we are dedicated to developing Jamaica's youth and shaping them for greatness. We continue to see the amazing talent that Jamaica has to offer in basketball. We share the Jamaica Basketball Association's vision of creating well-rounded individuals who contribute both on and off the court.\"\n\nRoper also highlighted the camp’s dual focus on basketball and life skills. \"It's not just a basketball camp; it’s also a life skills camp. We are proud to provide campers with knowledge and resources that will benefit them during the camp, in the sport of basketball, and beyond,\" he added.\n\nThe Star Search camp has produced notable talent, including former Cleveland Cavaliers player Samardo Samuels and current Charlotte Hornets player Nick Richards. This legacy underscores the camp's role in shaping the future of Jamaican basketball.\n\nPaul George is \"all-in\" with the Philadelphia 76ers, who he believes have a great shot at winning the NBA championship.\n\nGeorge joined the Sixers after the Los Angeles Clippers did not offer him a full max contract.\n\nHowever, George holds no ill will towards the Clippers.\n\nThe 34-year-old said: \"Amazing time. No regret, they went out and gave me an opportunity to play at home, which, at that point in time was a ton of value for myself to be able to play in front of my family, my friends, and have a legitimate shot to chase a championship every season.\n\n\"Obviously, injuries kind of deterred us a little bit. But just to speak on that situation as a whole, there's no ill will.\n\n\"Again, forever grateful for the opportunity that they gave me to come back.\n\n\"We had a great mutual talk as it all played out, and I felt it was great closure on the situation. I'm happy for them, they're happy for me, and I'm a Sixer now. So that's behind me.\"\n\nAnd George feels everything is lining up perfectly for the Sixers.\n\n\"I thought everything just aligned perfectly,\" George said.\n\n\"Where they're at and where they're trying to go and where I'm trying to get to, as well.\n\n\"I think we got a real legitimate shot. I've always been a fan of Tyrese and Joel from afar, and Joel has secretly been one of my closest All-Star Game friends. And so, it kind of felt inevitable that at some point we would link up and be teammates.\n\n\"So, I'm all-in. My family's here all-in, and I'm excited, and looking forward to this next opportunity.\"\n\nGeorge feels one key asset he can bring is to help share the load with 76ers talisman Joel Embiid, who suffered an injury-hit season last term.\n\n\"I think just taking the pressure off Joel,\" George said.\n\n\"I think I can kind of help him get through a season healthy. And again, it's just not putting so much pressure on him.\n\n\"Regardless of how good you feel, I think pressure causes a lot of injuries as well, and you think you have to get overplayed, you have to touch every possession, that kind of just wears you down, especially for how physical he is.\n\n\"So that's the key. Everybody do their part, make sure we're working on our bodies, and that we don't just put that pressure on one individual to go out and win games for us.\""
