        "text": "Portland has real motivation\n\nBy Vicki Michaelis\n\nDenver Post Sports Writer\n\nMay 3 - At the morning shootaround, Denver Nuggets coach Mike D'Antoni tried to instill some confidence in his players for Sunday night's game against Portland, telling them they could beat the Trail Blazers in transition.\n\nRight now, though, it seems doubtful the Nuggets could beat the Blazers even in their dreams.\n\nThe Blazers, after all, have a whole lot to play for and a whole lot of depth. The Nuggets have very little to play for and even less depth.\n\n\"These guys want to get to the (NBA) Finals, and we just want to get to the end of the season. It is different,'' D'Antoni said.\n\nGiven that difference, the score of the Nuggets' 110-102 loss to Portland at McNichols Sports Arena probably was closer than it should have been.\n\nThe Blazers (35-13) had lost their last three road games and were quickly losing sight not only of finishing with the league's best regular-season record but also of clinching home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\n\nIn their only similarity to the Nuggets, the Blazers have been much better at home than on the road, where they haven't beaten any of the top teams in the Western Conference. Their previous three road losses have come at Utah, the Los Angeles Lakers and San Antonio.\n\nAnd, although the Blazers have earned their first Pacific Division title since 1992 and their remarkable 17th consecutive playoff berth, they need every edge they can get in the postseason. They have lost in the first round of the playoffs the last six years.\n\nSo, with their only remaining games against San Antonio and the Lakers, the Blazers needed a victory over the Nuggets (14-34) in the worst way.\n\nThe Nuggets gave it to them in a way that hasn't been uncommon for Denver this season: After battling back from an 18-point deficit to pull within seven at halftime, the Nuggets were outscored 31-18 in the third quarter.\n\nThe Nuggets were energized by the hot shooting of Cory Alexander and Chauncey Billups for a stretch in the fourth quarter, even pulling to within nine points with 4:21 remaining on a Danny Fortson layup. But the Blazers' own motivated play proved too much for Denver to overcome.\n\n\"Those guys came back hitting threes, dunking, I could go on and on,'' Fortson said.\n\nPortland coach Mike Dunleavy, either in a charitable mood or delaying for as long as possible having to explain why he decided not to start J.R. Rider (he called the decision \"situational'' but didn't give specifics), lauded the Nuggets' effort.\n\n\"I've got to say I'm impressed. They're playing hard, they're giving a good effort (even though) they're really short-handed. I think Mike has done an excellent job with the team,'' Dunleavy said.\n\nAlthough D'Antoni is sure to buy Dunleavy a drink at his next opportunity, he didn't give quite the same assessment of the Nuggets' play.\n\n\"To beat a team like this, you have to have 48 minutes of all-out effort, and we didn't do that, for whatever reason,'' D'Antoni said. \"And, you know what, it might not been enough anyway. But to have a chance we had to do that.''\n\nThe Nuggets, now 12-11 at home, have to win tonight's game against Sacramento or Wednesday's season-ender against Houston to finish with a winning home record. They seem to be trying to convince themselves that's motivation enough.\n\n\"That's about the only thing we can fight for right now,'' Nuggets forward Antonio McDyess said.\n\nAt least it's something."
