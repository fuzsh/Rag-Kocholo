These results show what the mobile signal for each network should be in the postcode you've searched for.

Mobile phone signal levels can be affected by a number of different things:

Your location - the further away you are from a mobile phone mast the weaker your signal will be, as the signal gets weaker this affects the signal quality which will reduce your data download speeds.

Your local environment - hills, buildings, being in a basement or underground will all affect your mobile signal.

Travelling - if you are in a car or train and moving fast you may find your signal will be affected as you move from strong signal areas to weak or no signal areas.

Your phone - some models of phones are just better at getting a signal than others, a phone with low battery can also affect the way your phone works depending on the model.

The Weather - believe it or not even the weather can interfere with your mobile signal, heavy rain and snow can degrade the signal temporarily.
