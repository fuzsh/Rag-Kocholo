        "text": "What did a good iron shot look like for you in 2021? What did a bad shot look like? We ask because we have a way of making both of those better. In fact, we have a way of helping you with whatever part of iron-play you struggle with...\n\nBall-striking\n\nYou might already know about the new Cleveland Launcher XL range, but how much do you know about the irons? Sometimes the biggest improvement you can make is simply striking the ball consistently, which is why the Launcher XL Halo irons have progressive soles for optimal turf interaction no matter which club you’re using.\n\nControl\n\nCleveland has deployed a clever piece of technology in both the Launcher XL and Launcher XL Halo irons; Action Mass CB. This is a counter-balancing weight placed in the end of the grip for balance through your swing and strike for more control over the shot.\n\nForgiving distance\n\nImagine being able to whack the ball with all your might and not fear the consequences. Both of the iron new Cleveland iron models have a MainFrame with Variable Face Technology that generates speed and, in turn, distance. However, a strategic weighting system ensures plenty of forgiveness along with the distance.\n\nAll this adds up to more accuracy than last year, whether that’s pin-seeking or just finding fairways & greens more regularly. We have no doubt you’ll see the results, and all you have to do is book yourself an iron fitting with us to really maximise your potential in 2022."
