        "text": "What’s the key lesson I’ve learned from focusing exclusively on India’s consumption story for the last decade? Slow is good. When I started my journey as an investor, only 3% of grocery retail was organised. Today, this number stands at about 7%. An average of less than half a percentage point every year, slow. But you know what? the leading players in this space grew their sales at a CAGR of 25%+. Slow pace of change off a low base can be exciting! The founder of one of my favourite businesses made this comment: The benefit of a “slow” changing market, is that it allows entrepreneurs to adapt and refine their business. As I think more about this comment, I realise this is probably why market shares keep changing so much in some categories / markets but hardly budge in others. A “Slow” pace of change in the market can be a sign of low likelihood of disruption? The best environment for compounders is perhaps where there is enough change to generate double digit returns, but not too fast to make businesses more vulnerable to disruption… As an investor who prioritises “sleep at night factor”, I love slow pace of change. It helps me truly think long term. I think it is easier to bet that Indian consumers will want to buy daily essentials at the lowest price than bet on who will win the chip wars. Of course, there is no one “best” way to make returns. This is just what suits my personality. Look forward to spending more time with my Partners Rebecca Lewis and Gordon Y. and the amazing India team Manya Mishra Vasudha Thirani Nikhil Kukreja, CFA in a few days trying to understand consumer journeys better in tier 2 and rural India! #india #consumer #investing\n\nCarnelian Bharat Amritkaal Chapter #4 Recognising the 'Mega Trends' that are to surface during the Amritkaal period is the first step. To get the most from this indefinite growth stage, it's crucial to identify the sectors likely to be directly influenced by these trends and shoot for the skies. While India's growth is a cumulative result of many ideal circumstances aligning perfectly, some sectors would benefit on a much larger scale. Here's a brief peak into the sectors that would share the spotlight in the coming years leading up to India taking its place as one of the fastest-growing economic powers. Stick around to learn more about what makes these sectors the ones to look out for.
