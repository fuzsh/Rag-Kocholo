        "text": "The Flicker Session by Niall HORAN at the Fillmore Miami Beach was amazing!! His album is awesome with some very beautiful song lyrics, which shows he has a beautiful heart. Singing, he sounded very much like his album, where some artists sing their music differently in person. I love that he was very engaging with the crowd which I think is a testament to his personality.\n\nAs a mom, I am very proud of his accomplishments and how he carries himself. He is sweet, extremely talented, funny, and just an all around nice young man. I bought the tickets for my daughter's 12th birthday. She was thrilled that we were so close. Even though we only waited in line for about 3 and a half hours, we got amazing seats!!! (It was general admission). I am definitely going to take her to the West Palm Beach show in September. I'm praying we will win a meet and greet because I really can't afford it.\n\nNiall, keep doing what you are doing in putting words to music that helps someone get through the day, or get through a rough time, or just put a smile on someone's face.\n\nLucy,\n\nMom to your 12 year old fan\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThe 3 Arena concert was amazing!\n\nStarting with Julia as the supporting act and she got the audience hyped up, enjoying the concert from the very first tone.\n\nThen Niall and his band came on stage with a good mix of his own tunes, some 1D tunes and covers.\n\nNiall Horan basically stands with his guitar singing most of the show but still manages to have the audience in the palm of his hand. The lightning, band and Nialls performance comes out flawless.\n\nHe talks to the audience, has a connection with the audience and through slow hands he shows that he has the music throughout his whole body.\n\nHis music is a mix of uptempo tunes and slow beautiful tunes. Some of the most remarkable being So long on the piano and Flicker where there is no cellphone up in the audience after his own request.\n\nNiall Horan really has shown his solo artist skills, and he has a confidence and skill on stage that I only can compare to the boss Bruce Springsteen.\n\nThe concert stood to the expectations and was totally worth going from Norway to see it!\n\nCan't wait for the next concert.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nNiall was amazing!I was in the Milan show.\n\nHe had an amazing opening act and i was really exited for her. maybe more for Julia Micheals tan for Niall.\n\ni'm not a fan but i started loving his music since the concert. I just bought the tickets for fun so i didn't expected that.\n\nThe concert started with On the Loose. The Italian fan girls were going wild. omg.\n\nwhen he began with This Town, something went wrong with the system but after some tries he could finish his song.\n\nafter Paper Houses it all went wrong so he left the stage so people with knowledge could solve the problem.\n\nafter like 15 minutes he came back. he started again with on the loose so i thought 'it is for the atmosphere' but the whole concert started again. so professional!\n\ni had really good seats so the view was good.\n\nHe sang all his songs live and you can't say that about some other musicians. it all sounds really good.\n\nI would deffenitly go back to one of his future concerts but closer to home =]\n\n(so sorry for some words i didn't wrote right. i'm from the netherlands)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nYesterday, September 12th, 2018, I met Niall freaking Horan. Before we met him though, we went to his soundcheck and did a Q&A session. I was third row and dead center. He walked on stage smiling and doing the “princess wave” and the whole time his radiant personality kept shining through and made my smile grow bigger and bigger. He interacted with the audience a lot during soundcheck which I appreciated a ton. After soundcheck we waited on a line for the meet and greet. When I met him my mind went comepletey blank and of course I said hi how are you but I couldn’t think of anything else. I looked him in the eyes and they were such a gorgeous blue omg. He was the sweetest person and when he laughed I couldn’t help but laugh and smile too. I wouldn’t trade this experience for the whole and I can’t belive this happened yesterday. I cried as soon as I finished meeting him and this morning while I was getting ready. I love you Niall Horan❤️\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nI cannot even think of how to describe this incredible experience in words. He sounds just as good live as he does on his album recordings. I enjoyed the layout of the concert with the wristbands to keep it organized and to prevent the floor from crowding. However, the bands should have been handed out at the front door. A group of about 12 girls, my friend and I included, did not get wristbands nor get our bags checked when we entered the building. We had to get someone to search for wristbands for us. Luckily we may it onto the floor, thanks to the security guard who let us in. Niall was amazing and sweet and welcoming. One of the best, intimate shows I have been to yet!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\noh my god where do i begin, this was the first time i saw him live like ever, cause i never got to see 1d but its okay becuase this was honestly the best concert ever !!! and i really hope i can see him live again next september when he comes back !! overall the concert was amazing and Gavin his opening act was so amazing!!! my dream came true literally i heard an artist sing without a mic it was just so perfect i wish i met niall though and got a picture with him but it unfortunately didnt happen but its all good bc i saw him live and i am just so happy\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nTo start off, it was my 16th birthday the day of the concert. It was the best way to spend my birthday and I would do it again if I could. He put on a great show, as did Maren. My favorite part was when he asked everybody if they could put their phones away for his song Flicker. It was really nice to just be there with no phone out distracting you. It was one of the best concerts I’ve been to, and I’ve been to quite a few. I wish I could relive that night. :)\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
