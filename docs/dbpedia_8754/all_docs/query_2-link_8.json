        "text": "This morning waking up, I had a thought of asking Jonathan Horan, Gabrielleâ€™s son and my most important 5Rhythms teacher, if he could tell me something more about my home rhythm as I am still not sure about my home rhythm myself. Always this question â€¦ how do I know?\n\nThen, while showering (the shower is my place to have brainwaves, insights, revelations) I had a deep deep experience of coming home. During our Teacher Refreshworkshop in Zagreb this month, we were asked in groups to come to the middle of the dance floor and dance our home rhythm, later the same for the shadow of our home rhythmâ€¦\n\nI am so used to my decision that this is staccato, while I also hear people find me flowingâ€¦ I have never been sure about my home rhythmâ€¦ anyway I danced staccato as my home rhythm. To my surprise I saw a colleague dancing flow as her home rhythm, while I expected staccato because of her always being so clear. This observation shook me already up a bit: a rhythm one uses as an instrument in life is different from a home rhythmâ€¦\n\nThis morning, under the shower there started a movie playing in me, showing all pictures of me during my life, all in one rhythmâ€¦ in one or two seconds hundreds of pictures in this one rhythmâ€¦ a deep experience â€¦ in the rhythm of lyrical â€¦\n\nTears came up, in me a deep sensation of landing, of coming homeâ€¦ release, relief, seeingâ€¦\n\nLyrical, the rhythm of which I thought would be the last option to be my home rhythm. Now this sounds already silly to me, but two hours ago this was still the caseâ€¦\n\nIn the picture I saw myself growing up with a flowing mum and an shadowy staccato dad, no space, no other possibiliy than holding my breath and taking all possible shapes to fit in on one hand and staying true to myself on the otherâ€¦ I was (am) creative, I create since I was born, but could never find it in one discipline, I shifted, shifted, shiftedâ€¦ classical ballet, beat ballet, jazz ballet, making cheese, candles, clothes, drawings, paintings, food (cooking, baking); finding my way with paper cuttings, knitting, frivolitÃ©, macrame, pitrites, papier-machÃ©, clay modelling, etc. â€¦\n\nI had five professions, followed countless courses, studies, wellâ€¦ I could write a book about it, but I think you got it by nowâ€¦ shapeshifting is so close to me that I never recognised itâ€¦ I do it all the time, in how I do my day, meet others, do my planning, built my life â€¦ though I actually never got it what was exactly meant with a shapeshifterâ€¦\n\nI always thought I was good at moving with, adapting, flowing. I am able to, but what I am really good at is taking another shapeâ€¦ I have a shape to survive when I am with my family, I take a shape when I am in big groups, I take a shape when I am in uncomfortable situations â€¦ and when I do this too long I get ill, because I loose my true self in thisâ€¦ I donâ€™t want a steady form, I donâ€™t want to conformâ€¦ My tendency to â€˜behaveâ€™ is looking for the â€˜rightâ€™ form to stay out of trouble â€¦ one of my shadows â€¦\n\nI totally dislike the shadow of lyrical, more than any other shadow. I thought because thereâ€™s so much going on in the world these days with all marketed â€˜spiritualâ€™ developments, guruâ€™s, fake ecstatic, addictions â€¦ as if this were not the case with shadows of other rhythmsâ€¦\n\nUntil now lyrical has been the most difficult rhythm for me to understand â€¦ too light (strict religious education)â€¦ this rhythm simply was not in my scopeâ€¦I do embody flow, I do embody staccatoâ€¦ my home rhythm is lyricalâ€¦ I canâ€™t tell you what a deep shift this is in meâ€¦. finally seeing myselfâ€¦it moves me to tearsâ€¦ coming homeâ€¦ this is a soul experience, a break throughâ€¦ I see myself from another perspective now.\n\nAs a child I had bronchitis, always, could not breathe, no airâ€¦ air, space, endless space has always been a theme in my life. The best place in the world is that endless beach on Terschelling, thatâ€™s where I feel fully at homeâ€¦ what I do with my paintings is creating as much space as possible in 2D. My installation work in Zagrebâ€¦ 5 papercuts as the basic and then I start shape shiftingâ€¦ I donâ€™t think about it, it just happensâ€¦ I can go on forever giving examplesâ€¦ also from what people gave me as feedback over the yearsâ€¦ I just wasnâ€™t able to listen, to let it in â€¦\n\nFrom this place I understand so much more from the workshop we did in Zagrebâ€¦which feels great, beyond my skin and fingersâ€¦ feel a bit ashamed at the same timeâ€¦ how could I have been so blind? â€¦ the familiar voices in my headâ€¦ I let them go for nowâ€¦\n\nNow the penny has droppedâ€¦ not only the pennyâ€¦ I got the whole jackpot â€¦ I have to laugh at myself. That I didnâ€™t see â€¦ now I doâ€¦ itâ€™s a huge permission, a liberation, a celebration â€¦\n\nSeeing, meeting myself from the perspective of lyrical is such a shiftâ€¦ and such a giftâ€¦ so trueâ€¦ from pop into butterflyâ€¦\n\nSo here I am, in my true colors, with a lot of dots in my writingâ€¦\n\nSoul Rebel ðŸ™‚"
