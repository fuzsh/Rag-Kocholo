Nus is keen that the service is reinstated and has been supporting Horam Parish Council in finding a permanent solution.\n\nIn the meantime, a Temporary Hosted Outreach will be reinstated from today and will be operating from Horam Centre, High Street, Horam, TN21 0EH, every Monday from 9:00am - 12:00pm."
