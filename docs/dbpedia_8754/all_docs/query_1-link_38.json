        "meta_description": "Dr. Horan loves Pediatric Orthopaedics! He feels he was destined to care of children and their injuries. While working on an engineering project in college in the early 1990's, he had the opportunity to work with a group of Pediatric Orthopaedists on a Motion Analysis project for children with cerebral palsy and found that this field was his calling. Although he had planned to be a Mechanical Engineer, he rerouted his education with his sights set on becoming a Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon. He graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Clemson University and followed that with a graduate Master of Science degree in Bioengineering and Biomechanics, also from Clemson. He then worked as a Product Development Engineer for Stryker Spine in Allendale, New Jersey where he developed a Posterior Cervical Fixation System, OASYS, which resulted in multiple US Patents and has been used regularly throughout the world in thousands of patients over the past 20+ years.  He next obtained his medical degree at Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. He completed his internship and residency in Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Kentucky in Lexington and completed a fellowship in Pediatric Orthopedics and Spinal Deformity at Columbia University in New York City. \nDr. Horan is board certified by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery and is a Fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), the Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) , the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) , the Southern Orthopaedic Association (SOA), and the South Carolina Orthopaedic Association (SCOA) and a candidate with the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS). Currently, he serves as a member of the Board of Counselors with the AAOS and travels to Capitol Hill to lobby for Orthopaedic Surgeons, reduced costs for patients, and timely access to medical care by reducing the hurdles to prior authorization. He serves on several committees with the above organizations including the Pediatric Orthopaedic Global Outreach Committee with POSNA and the SRS Nonoperative Treatment for Scoliosis Committee. He is a representative to the Board of Directors for the Southern Orthopaedic Association and is a member of the Board of Directors as well as the Orthopaedic Director for the nonprofit Medical Mission Ecuador Surgical Mission. \nHe serves as a clinical assistant professor with the University of South Carolina School of Medicine and teaches medical students and residents Pediatric Orthopaedic Surgery. His research interests included peer reviewed published works on Vitamin D deficiency in Pediatric Orthopaedics as well as textbook chapters, journal articles, and speaking presentations on Pediatric Orthopaedics. \n\nSince 2009, Dr. Horan has been a member of the Medical Mission Ecuador, traveling to Ambato Ecuador annually to provide free medical care and Orthopaedic Surgery to children in underserved areas. He now directs the Orthopaedic Surgery team for the mission and organizes the travel and planning for a 80 member team from the United States.
