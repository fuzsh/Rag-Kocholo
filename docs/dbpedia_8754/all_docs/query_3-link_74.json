The farm has also become an integral part of village life, hosting local events in its restored Cartlodge.\n\n‘We are part of a growing community as the village expands,’ explains Felicity. ‘Local events bring people together, giving a sense of belonging which again has all sorts of benefits to our lives at all stages.’\n\n‘The current lockdown has given us a glimpse of a quieter, less polluted world, with an extraordinarily quick ability to regenerate wildlife.’"
