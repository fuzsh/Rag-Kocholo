        "text": "If you’re in Horam and looking for a local optician, then come down to Focus Medical Eye Centre in Hailsham. There aren’t currently any opticians in Horam and with all the generation of new homes and more people then you have the option to come into Heathfield or down to Hailsham. We’re only a few minutes down the road with lots of free available car parking. Award-winning local opticians based in the High Street of Hailsham with qualified, optometrists, opticians, and ophthalmologists. We’d love it if you chose us for your optician’s appointments or any other eye-related needs.\n\nAward-Winning Local Opticians\n\nWhen you go to an optician, you will probably meet different people who carry out different roles in the practice. But did you know that there are different roles within the opticians? We’re not all the same! The optician simply refers to either the person conducting your eye examination or the person fitting and measuring your spectacles. There are plenty of other people who are here to care about your eyes.\n\nThe person who conducts your eye examination inside the consulting room is called the Optometrist. They will be trying to get the right prescription for your eyes. You might be familiar with these people who test you to see whether you can read the letters on the eye charts at the end of the room.\n\nOn the other hand, a Dispensing Optician is the lens expert who helps you to pick out your new spectacles outside the consulting room. This person is a professional in making sure you’re picking out the right glasses.\n\nRegistered Optometrists & Ophthalmologists\n\nOptometrists have completed a degree in Optometry, and spend a minimum of 4 years studying before qualifying. This training means they can examine and diagnose vision difficulties or diseases of the eye. As the primary providers of care; they can test and prescribe spectacles or contact lenses, and provide other medical treatments. Overseeing all of this is the General Optic Council who help maintain standards and codes of practice within the profession. Focus Medical Eye Centre are registered with this body to make sure we are following all regulations.\n\nSome Optometrists choose to specialise and undertake further training and qualifications. A prescribing Optometrist can prescribe medications for the treatment of various eye conditions and has effectively become an ‘eye GP’. Other specialists can include Paediatrics, including School Vision, Glaucoma and Medical Retina including Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\n\nMr Shahram Kashani is our lead Consultant Ophthalmologist for East Sussex NHS Trust. We’re very lucky to have Mr Kashani, and he’s a specialist in the diagnosis, management and treatment of retinal diseases. So if you need to see an Ophthalmologist – get in touch with us.\n\nPlease note: Anthony is a fully qualified Prescribing Optometrist in addition to being a Hospital Specialist Optometrist. Amanda is a fully qualified School Vision Children’s Specialist Practitioner in addition to her normal roles.\n\nContact Lenses and Spectacle Fittings\n\nThe dispensing optician is responsible for giving advice on the fitting and supplying the most appropriate spectacles for you. They are trained to take into account each patient’s visual, lifestyle and vocational needs. Sara is our fully qualified dispensing Optician and Practice Manager. She will help you find the right pair of spectacles or contact lenses for you.\n\nSara is able to fit and provide aftercare for contact lenses after undergoing further specialist training. Dispensing Opticians typically have undertaken at least 3 years of specialist training and will also be registered with the General Optical Council.\n\nLooking for a Local Optician in Horam?\n\nWe advertise in this area as quite a few people are looking for opticians in Horam.
