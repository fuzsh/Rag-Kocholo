        "text": "Niall Horan is bringing The Show Live On Tour 2024 to the TD Pavilion at the on June 11!\n\nOriginally from Mullingar, Ireland, Niall Horan has sold over 80 million records and toured the globe multiple times as part of the iconic One Direction. His full-length solo debut Flicker entered the Billboard 200 at No. 1 in October 2017 and contained the 3x RIAA Platinum single “Slow Hands” and the 2x RIAA Platinum “This Town.” The album hit the top 10 in 20 countries total. With combined global streams surpassing eight billion, Flicker has gone Platinum in five countries (including the U.S.) and Gold in additional seven countries. Heartbreak Weather followed in 2020 and topped the U.K.’s Official Albums chart and Billboard’s Top Album Sales tally.\n\nA deeply felt meditation on everything from mental health to the infinite complexity and uncertainty of love, The Show, Horan's upcoming album, is an endlessly spellbinding statement on following your heart to its absolute truth. As he gears up to share his most personal material yet in a truly extraordinary career, Horan is particularly eager to return to the stage.\n\n“There’s nothing better than watching the crowd sing back to you with all that emotion on their faces and knowing that they’re attaching the song to something meaningful in their own lives,” says Niall Horan. “To me, that’s always the greatest thing that can ever come from songwriting.”\n\nTickets are on sale now via Ticketmaster.com and the Mann's Ticket Office.\n\nBag Policy\n\nBags must be 12\"x6\"x12\" or smaller. For the safety of our patrons, all bags are subject to search."
