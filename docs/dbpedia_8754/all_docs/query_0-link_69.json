Due to the nature of the activity on the site, security measures are high. Parties viewing on an “ad hoc” basis are advised to exercise caution as the access roadway to the site is regularly used by HGVs. It is likely that internal viewings will be conducted on a “block” basis to minimise disturbance to the tenant and to respect the sensitive nature of the tenant’s operations."
