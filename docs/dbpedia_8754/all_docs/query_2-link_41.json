We have seen the shared results in our employees’ improved health, reduced renewals and in the reduced health care costs paid by the plan and our employees.”\n\n“HORAN provides us with data analytics around gaps in care, claims, emergency room utilization and also around our employee engagement before and after we implement different plan elements. They have also helped by connecting us with wellness vendors who help us track biometric screens and PCP visits.”\n\n“Every year during annual renewal time, our leadership is always asking ‘what’s something new we can offer employees this year?’ HORAN helps us by bringing creativity and best practices to the table.”\n\n“When we decided to go forward with HORAN, I felt like they really became our trusted partner. We love working with the HORAN team. I think there is a lot of synergy between our primary team at HORAN and our management team.”\n\n“Working with all of you is a pleasure. Your collective performance exceeds any that I received from in-house benefits administration groups in my many years of HR experience.”\n\n“Each year at this time, I reflect on how important our Horan team is to our effective benefits strategy and execution. I again want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for our two main points of contact and recognize that there are many others behind the scenes that support their efforts”"
