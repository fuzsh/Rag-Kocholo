        "text": "Hi, I'm Niall Horan and today I'm gonna teach you\n\nhow to be Irish.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWe use a lot of slang in Ireland\n\nand I'm gonna show you through some of the words we use.\n\nGiving it socks.\n\nGiving it socks means giving it everything you've got.\n\nGive it socks.\n\nYou know, if you were trying to gee someone up\n\nto make them do something, you would say, give it socks.\n\nYa bleedin'.\n\nThis is more of a Dublin slang word.\n\nYa bleedin' can be followed by anything.\n\nIt could be ya bleedin' gobshite.\n\nYa bleedin' eejit.\n\nAnything that's derogatory fits over here.\n\nOr it could be good, it could be like ya bleedin' legend.\n\nGombeen.\n\nGombeen is not something that I would use\n\nbut it's the kind of thing like my granny would.\n\nAnother word for, you know,\n\nyou probably wouldn't understand either.\n\nGobshite.\n\nBasically idiot.\n\nYa gombeen.\n\nAnother derogatory term.\n\nMost of our terms are derogatory.\n\nAnything we can do to put someone down.\n\nLashing.\n\nWhenever you see a word in Ireland that ends in I-N-G,\n\ntake the G off.\n\nWe don't pronounce Gs or THs, so this would be just lashin'.\n\nLashing means lashing rain, pissing it down.\n\nThat's a national word, lashing, 'cause it's always lashing.\n\nLeg it!\n\nLeg it means run as fast as you can.\n\nIf you're getting chased by someone,\n\nyou're absolutely legging it.\n\nThat's a good way of saying that he was running very fast.\n\nNext one, losing the rag.\n\nLosing the rag means like losing the plot.\n\nJust losing it.\n\nThe rag basically is having it\n\nand then losing the rag is just losing it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nNow, okay, first one.\n\nThese things are not great.\n\nThese are Oldfield emerald chocolate caramels.\n\nActually, I'm gonna taste them\n\nbecause I always thought they had dark chocolate\n\nand as you can see, they've got milk chocolate.\n\nWhen I was growing up, Oldfield made very bad sweets.\n\nJust kinda, you know that like the sweet\n\nthat literally your grandmother will have and no one else.\n\nOh, they're not bad.\n\nOkay, you're gonna need them.\n\nI didn't think you were gonna need them\n\nbut you will need them now.\n\nNext one, Ballymaloe relish.\n\nBallymaloe is a place in County Cork\n\nand they are famous for making this particular relish.\n\nIt's kind of like a more gourmet version of a ketchup.\n\nThese are things that I would only ever have\n\nwhen I'm in Ireland and I kind of like that\n\n'cause it's just so Irish to me.\n\nActually, there's a tea bag that I get on Amazon.\n\nBarry's Tea.\n\nIf you are going to Ireland, stop and get Barry's tea bags.\n\nSuch a nice tea, honestly.\n\nAs you guys would call it English breakfast tea,\n\nbut we just call it tea.\n\nNext one, Tayto.\n\nTayto is the national Irish, as we call them, crisps,\n\nyou call them chips.\n\nThis is just an Irish staple.\n\nI'm gonna try some here.\n\nThis is cheese and onion.\n\nWe're just so good at crisps.\n\nOh, Tayto sandwich.\n\nAnother great Irish delicacy.\n\nTwo slices of bread, some butter\n\nand a half a packet of Tayto in between them\n\nand it's absolutely magic.\n\nLast one, Jaffa Cakes.\n\nBasically this is a soft biscuit bottom\n\nwith like an orange filling and a dark chocolate top.\n\nAnd they're incredible.\n\nThey're so nice.\n\nI actually haven't had these in ages.\n\nOh.\n\nI won't be eating them,\n\nbut they're just another great Irish biscuit.\n\nWe do the confectionary side of things\n\nvery well in our lovely little country.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe most important thing you need to know about Ireland,\n\nGuinness.\n\nGuinness is our national drink.\n\nIt's a stout.\n\nThe Guinness Storehouse in Dublin is one of\n\nthe top tourist attractions on the planet.\n\nIt's a real thing of beauty this stuff,\n\nand I'm gonna show you how you pour it.\n\nFirst of all, the glass I'm not sure about.\n\nI'll have to have a chat off camera.\n\nYou don't pour a Guinness like you would pour\n\nany other beer.\n\nWe're gonna do a slow pour onto about there on the glass\n\nand as it fills to about two thirds of the way,\n\nwe're gonna start to straighten it out\n\nand this can is flat as a pancake.\n\nThen you leave it to sit for a second.\n\nYou'll see all the good stuff rushing down.\n\nLeave it to settle and then get back to it.\n\nLook at this piece of art.\n\nThey should put that in a national gallery.\n\nIt's just absolutely gorgeous.\n\nI just fall in love with it\n\nand it makes me feel proud to be Irish.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSome things you should avoid doing\n\nif you're a tourist in Ireland.\n\nDon't tell anybody about your Irish lineage,\n\nespecially if you're not asked about it.\n\nTry not to speak in an Irish accent\n\nif it's not your national accent.\n\nTry not and get offended over banter.\n\nIt's only banter.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nIf you are planning a road trip to Ireland,\n\nI'm gonna help you and tell you where you need to go.\n\nHere's Dublin.\n\nIt is the capital city of Ireland.\n\nIn Dublin, you will find beautiful coastline.\n\nHere we have Howth, Sandy Mount,\n\nand in the city center you will find a fine array\n\nof many good pints of Guinness in many different pubs.\n\nAnd we'll do a separate video for a list\n\nof all the great pubs I know in Dublin.\n\nThe first port to call from me when I go back to Ireland\n\nis try Guinness again.\n\nThe real good stuff is in Dublin and in Ireland.\n\nSo when I land, the first thing I do is head for a pint.\n\nNo matter what time of the day it is.\n\nIf you do go from Dublin and head west,\n\nyou'll find a fine town in the middle of the motorway\n\ncalled Mullingar, the birthplace of myself.\n\nHere we have a small market town of about 30,000 people\n\nwith 26 pubs in one mile.\n\nIn Mullingar, we have some great pubs\n\nwith some great live music.\n\nIf I was to go anywhere, I would go to The Crossed Keys,\n\nI would go to Dalys, I would go to Clark's Bar\n\non Patrick Street, which is the street I grew up on.\n\nApart from that, you can see there's a big mural\n\nof me on the wall.\n\nCan't miss it.\n\nI look like this on it.\n\nAnd then I would go and see Galway,\n\nShop Street in Galway is a great street\n\nand Salt Hill and Galway Bay, some fine restaurants\n\nand some fine bars and just beautiful Irish hospitality.\n\nAnd I would make my way along this coastline here\n\nwhich is otherwise known as the Wild Atlantic way.\n\nThis is a part of the world that every time I see it,\n\nit was just mind boggling to me how beautiful it is.\n\nAnd I would make my way out to Dingle.\n\nDingle is possibly the best place in Ireland.\n\nThe reason people go to Ireland is you want\n\nthe beautiful coastline from P.S. I Love You.\n\nThey want to get the Irish traditional music.\n\nThey want the great hospitality.\n\nAnd a lot of what makes Ireland incredible\n\nis happening all around these parts of the world.\n\nDown Tralee, into Killarney.\n\nGo to Reidy's Pub on Main Street, Killarney.\n\nGreat fun.\n\nAnd then start making your way along the south here\n\ninto Cork.\n\nThey would be the main parts of Ireland\n\nthat I would hit if I was to go.\n\nWe're very lucky to have the coastline that we do.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nWatch out for the sheep.\n\nThere's a lot of old country roads\n\nand mountainous driving where sheep\n\nare clinging onto the side of hills\n\nand tend to walk out in the middle of the road.\n\nSo just watch out for the sheep.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe GAA is the Gaelic Athletic Association.\n\nGaelic Football and hurling are the two main Irish sports.\n\nGaelic football is basically soccer\n\nwith the ball in your hand.\n\nHurling is basically lacrosse on steroids.\n\nIt's like what baseball is to Americans, you know,\n\nit's the standout one, gets the most viewers.\n\nIt's a big part of Irish culture.\n\nThe best place to go and see is probably here in Dublin.\n\nCroke Park is our national stadium.\n\nPlayoff Games and championship games\n\nare played at Croke Park in front of 90,000 people.\n\nWhere else is good?\n\nYeah, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipp, Clare.\n\nThey're the main good places to go and see.\n\nAnd I'm Niall Horan from the Irish Tourist Board.\n\nEnjoy your road trip around Ireland\n\nand tell 'em all I said hello when you see them.\n\n[gentle music]"
