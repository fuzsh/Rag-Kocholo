        "text": "It’s this same maturity, in tandem with his starting his career as a contestant on a talent competition show that has equipped him with the valuable insights he can share with aspiring artists as a coach on The Voice. Early in our conversation, he excitedly shared that he was looking forward to potentially winning, and as further proof of his capabilities, he did. Gina Miles, under his wing, impressed the masses with her vocals and took home the win of Season 23. His best advice for his team? Take it easy.\n\n“It’s such simple advice. I find on The Voice [the contestants] are so technically gifted, and with that comes taking it really seriously. At the end of the day, we’re on a reality TV show on a Monday night. I’m always trying to remind them to just take it easy and enjoy it for what it is. You get the platform to stand up there every night and sing songs that you love in front of a nation. It’s a really cool opportunity if you look at it that way. If you look at it [more seriously], it’s the scariest thing you’ve ever done. As I’ve gone on, I can see my artists are actually making friends and enjoying the process of it all. Because it can be over in two seconds. Take it in, and know that if you leave The Voice, it’s not the end of your career, you’re sixteen!”\n\nSimple, uncomplicated advice is often what’s needed but can sometimes only be realized with so many years under your belt, as we adjust and learn to surrender to the aforementioned ebbs and flows of life that The Show is all about. With this, comes the inevitable facing up of mistakes and lessons learned both professionally and personally that can eventually equip you with the knowledge to be a viable mentor.\n\n“You do learn. I listen to a shit song I’ve written and go ‘That was shit’ and what did I do there that I didn’t do in one of my favorites? You’ll learn like that. It’s a progression thing, across the board, musically and personally. And from what I’ve gathered, that doesn’t come to an end any time soon.”\n\nLeaning into the idea of the album’s concept, and in theory, if our life is a show, then surely you get to be in the writer’s room to imagine your desired season finales. In typical Niall nature, he tells me, “I’m one of those people that doesn’t look past my note. You gotta live it as you’re in it.” I guess it is true what he sings on “The Show”, it’s all fun and games until the party ends. And who else better to party with than Lewis Capaldi? The two UK-born artists have established a close relationship through their experiences in the music industry, developing a close bond that has secured Lewis a regular, main character spot on Niall’s “show”. “He’s well and truly in the show. It’s a good relationship to have. And I don’t go around the world looking for famous mates because that wouldn’t say too much about me,” Niall tells me, “I always found if you get on with someone [you] can usually judge [them] on ‘would I go for a pint with that person?’ and I’ve gone for plenty of pints with that man.”\n\nOn a more profound note, Niall expands on his humble ambitions, “Obviously, you’ve got to think about the future, [but] you can fry your own brain, planning your whole life out. And if you don’t hit any of those goals, you feel like you have failed. I’ve always tried to swim through it and see what happens. I’ve never felt more enjoyment of what I do than now, and hopefully, I can make music at this level and remain happy in my home life. And cross the bridge when it comes to it, I suppose.”\n\nClear in his direction, Niall is dedicated to making music and continuing to adapt his voice to his life experiences, for as long as he can. “I think we all go for longevity. Longevity and time [are] the most important things to me. If I could win some awards or get No.1 [on the charts] here and there, that would be good too. But, I would love length and longevity in my career.” Much of Niall’s legacy will rightfully be rooted in One Direction, “I wouldn’t be doing this now if it weren’t for 1D, I’ve got zero issues with that following me around forever,” he says, pointing to the obvious impact of that historic and iconic era.\n\nAs Niall Horan’s introspective journey thus far, culminates in The Show, his individual artistic vision is delivered with clear force, carrying in it his expansion and development. Despite the setbacks of 2020, his upcoming tour promises to be a triumphant return to his natural home, the stage, where he can once again captivate audiences with his magnetic presence. With longevity as his compass, Niall Horan is poised to solidify his place enchanting new fans—and recovered Directioners—for years to come."
