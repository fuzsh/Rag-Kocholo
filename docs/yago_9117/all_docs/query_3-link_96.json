        "text": "A total of 19 Catalan productions will feature in the 71st edition of the San Sebastián International Film Festival.\n\nThe festival takes place in the Basque city of Donosita-San Sebastián from September 22-30.\n\nIsabel Coixet's new film 'Un amor' will compete for the Golden Shell for best film, a first for the Catalan director.\n\nCoixet's film is an adaptation of Sara Mesa's novel of the same name, which portrays the arrival of a young woman in a small rural town and stars Goya winner Laia Costa, alongside Hovik Keuchkerian.\n\n'They Shot the Piano Player' is the new animated film by Fernando Trueba and Javier Mariscal starring Jeff Goldblum as a music journalist investigating the disappearance of Brazilian pianist Tenorio Jr. It will receive its Spanish premiere at the festival as part of the official selection but not in competition.\n\nThe opening film is the documentary 'No me llame Ternera' from Catalan director Jordi Évole. Produced by Producciones del Barrio, it features an exclusive interview with one of ETA's key figures: Josu Urrutikoetxea, better known as Josu Ternera.\n\nSome groups representing victims of terrorism have voiced their opposition to the film, which the festival describes as \"a hitherto unseen look at the inside of the terrorist outfit.\"\n\nThe non-competitive Made in Spain section contains nine Catalan productions alone, including 'While You're Still You', from director Clàudia Pinto.\n\nThe borders between fiction and reality disappear as it records the \"last conscious voyage\" of Catalan actor Carme Elías after she is diagnosed with Alzheimer's."
