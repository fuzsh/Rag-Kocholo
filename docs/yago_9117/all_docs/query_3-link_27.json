        "text": "When you make love to a woman, you get revenge for all the things that defeated you in life.\n\nI can count on one hand the movies that changed me. Saw Elegy my first year of grad school. Permanent influence on how I view beauty, friendship, intimacy, mortality. Had direct impact on real-life action. Read The Dying Animal by Philip Roth shortly after discovering this was an adaptation of his book. I still remember that walk to the university library to pick up a copy.\n\n“You tasted it. Isn't that enough? Of what do you ever get more than a taste? That's all we're given in life, that's all we're given of life. A taste. There is no more.”\n\nElegy is…\n\nSo I rewatched Elegy and finished Good Old Neon by DFW and the two started blurring together in the final brutal paragraphs, the David Wallace trying, David Wallace fully aware of cliches, David Wallace having emerged from years of literally indescribable war against himself with quite a bit of creative firepower. Etc. Beautiful people are invisible, Dennis Hopper tells Ben Kingsley. We don’t see the person beneath the seductive exterior, all we can think about is what it’d maybe (probably, ideally) feel like to be inside passion with them, the object of their passion, its recipient. Meredith Rand rolling her cigarette going on about the prettiness thing…\n\n“I mean starting to see yourself as a piece of meat, that the…\n\nElegy. 2008. Directed by Isabel Coixet.\n\nIsabel Coixet’s Elisa and Marcela (2019) was a wonderful yet sad LGBTQ story. Whereas, Elegy is a film that was not available to us last year as I searched Coixet’s filmography. Elegy would have been more enjoyable without Dennis Hopper and Charlie Rose. However, Penelope Cruz is why we came and why we stayed. Cruz is undeniably gorgeous and portrays a strong female who has an affair with her professor portrayed by Ben Kingsley (I, personally think Patrick Stuart would have been a much better male lead).\n\nElegy, in some scenes, is like a fine book of art with Penelope Cruz talking with Ben Kingsley while fine classical music plays. This is an existential…\n\nI am pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this since I have had a so-so experience with other Roth adaptations (I have never read his work, just seen the adaptations of them).\n\nThis deals with some themes that invariably I have come to enjoy a lot in movies, especially those dealing with regrets of time passed and introspection of a life lived by (hence the title!), and ruminations on romantic entanglements between men and women. I often come back to a great line from The Wire, which goes something like, Life is the shit that happens while you are waiting for moments that never come, and that kind of plays into this movie where an old man keeps thinking…\n\nAnybody who has read the Shane Drinion/Meredith Rand chapter of The Pale King has been exposed to the terrifying prospect of only knowing being loved for your beauty (or intellect, I suspect, in the case of author David Foster Wallace), whether you are, in fact, brilliant, or beautiful, or both. I argue Wallace evokes radical empathy like no other author and his ability to make you feel bad for the prettiest girl in the room (or the richest kid, or best tennis player) is his most notable skill in a basketful of pretty incredible ones.\n\nElegy raises, for me, a far more terrifying prospect: what if, beyond all reasonable expectation, someone actually loves you for you, including blind spots, misjudgments,…\n\nFrom the popular success of Goodbye, Columbus to the disaster of the shrill, unfunny Portnoy’s Complaint, the big-screen adaptations of Philip Roth’s fiction have had a spotty history. Isabel Coixet’s Elegy, adapted from Roth’s The Dying Animal, is a little-known but highly effective attempt to capture the novelist’s intentions.\n\nElegy tells the story of an unlikely relationship between David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley), an aging literature professor at an unnamed New York university, and Consuela Castillo (Penelope Cruz), a Cuban-American graduate student. An intellectual celebrity who appears on Charlie Rose and National Public Radio, David has been divorced twice and has had numerous short-term affairs with his students. An exception is his twenty-year relationship with Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson) that began while…\n\nBen Kingsley plays a suave but predatory professor that preys on younger women every after every semester.\n\nPenelope Cruz is his new intended target.\n\nYou may think you know where this story is going, but you'd be mostly wrong as...to reveal more would ruin surprises.\n\nBen Kingsley shines as a guy you should be able to see right through but gets away with his transgressions because he's so confident and entitled.\n\nPenelope Cruz carries most of the movie by...to reveal more would...you know.\n\nA good movie but could have been great. As the end credits roll you wonder why it never crosses the line to greatness. Mostly because almost every payoff feels too pat, every ending too clean, considering the…"
