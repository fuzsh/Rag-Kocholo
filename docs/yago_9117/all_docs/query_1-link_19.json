        "text": "a complicated snapshot of a young woman in crisis who refuses to become an object of pity, and who is driven by a single-minded desire to keep her family as happy as possible both during the brief time left to her and after.\n\nFull Review | Jun 21, 2020\n\nThrough a series of quietly expressed and telling scenes, director Isabel Coixet steers a sure path between sentimentality and mawkishness: imminent death in the movies has rarely generated such humanity, such humour or such strength.\n\nFull Review | Jan 11, 2018\n\nMy Life Without Me is not a gentle film. Insistent and unforgettable, it wounds on the inside, and the scars feel fresh for some time.\n\nFull Review | Sep 26, 2005\n\nWatching My Life Without Me is enervating. Coixet is so determined not to indulge the story's potential for sentiment that she overcompensates on the dreariness.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 10, 2004\n\nThis is a film for people who like to cry, and there's a contrived element that's inherent to the beautiful-death genre. Still, Polley is the film's saving grace...\n\nFull Review | Mar 30, 2004\n\nPlagued by phony poetic moments and self-conscious quirkiness (Maria de Medeiros appears as a braid-wearing hair stylist obsessed with Milli Vanilli...)\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jan 19, 2004\n\nIt takes considerable sleight of hand, and a certain temerity, to fashion an uplifting tale about death. Yet My Life Without Me pulls it off.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 11, 2003"
