Fighting damp, cold and considerable local apathy she struggles to establish herself but soon her fortunes change for the better. By exposing the narrow minded local townsfolk to the best literature of the day including Nabokov’s scandalising “Lolita” and Ray Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451”, she opens their eyes thereby causing a cultural awakening in a town which has not changed for centuries.\n\nHer activities bring her a kindred spirit and ally in the figure of Mr Brundish (Bill Nighy)who is himself sick of the town’s stale atmosphere. But this mini social revolution soon brings her fierce enemies: she invites the hostility of the town’s less prosperous shopkeepers and also crosses Mrs. Gamart (Patricia Clarkson), Hardborough’s vengeful, embittered alpha female who is herself a wannabe doyenne of the local arts scene. When Florence refuses to bend to Gamart’s will, they begin a struggle not just for the bookshop but for the very heart and soul of the town.\n\nFILMMAKERS\n\nWritten and directed by: Isabel Coixet (Learning to Drive, Elegy, My Life Without Me)\n\nBased on Booker Prize winning novelist Penelope Fitzgerald’s novel ‘The Bookshop’,\n\nitself Booker-nominated.\n\nProduced by Jaume Banacolocha, Joan Bas, Adolfo Blanco and Chris Curling.\n\nProduction Companies: Diagonal TV, A Contracorriente Films, Zephyr Films.\n\nCo-produced with Green Films and One Two Films\n\nWith the support and participation of ICAA, ICEC, TVE, Movistar+, Natixis Coficine and\n\nNorthern Ireland Screen."
