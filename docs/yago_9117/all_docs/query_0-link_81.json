Another Me is a supernatural thriller based on theeponymous novel by Cathy MacPhail (published by Bloomsbury) starring Sophie Turner (one of the protagonists in the acclaimed tv series “Game of Thrones”) as a teenager haunted by a secret past in search of inner peace.\n\nDallas Buyers Club is directed by the Canadian filmmaker and screenwriter Jean-Marc Vallée, whose previous films are C.R.A.Z.Y , The Young Victoria, and the critically-acclaimed Café de Flores. Inspired by a true story, the film tells of the intense struggle for survival waged by Ron Woodroof, played by American actor and screenwriter Matthew McConaughey (Contact, Amistad, Edtv, Killer Joe), winner of the Independent Spirit Award as Best Supporting Actor for his role in Magic Mike by Steven Soderbergh.\n\nSpike Jonze, director of the award-winning Being John Malkovich (1999), Adaptation and Where the Wild Things Are, creator and scriptwriter of the controversial television series “Jackass”, and director of ground-breaking music videos (among others for Beastie Boys, Arcade Fire, Bjork, Chemical Brothers, R.E.M., Daft Punk), returns to feature filmmaking with Her, the story of Theodore – played by Joaquin Phoenix (To Die For, Gladiator, Walk the Line, Two Lovers, The Master) – a lonely writer who begins an unlikely relationship with his new operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson (Lost in Translation, The Girl with the Pearl Earring, The Black Dahlia, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Under the Skin).\n\nA searing drama about family, fate, circumstance, and justice, Out of the Furnace is directed by Scott Cooper, winner of two Oscars® (including Best Actor to Jeff Bridges) and two Golden Globes in 2010 for Crazy Heart. Oscar®-winner Christian Bale (Empire of the Sun, Public Enemies, Batman Begins, The Dark Night, The Fighter), plays Russell Baze, a former inmate recently released from prison, who must decide whether to give up his own freedom or seek justice for his brother, played by Casey Affleck (the Ocean’s trilogy, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, The Killer Inside Me).\n\nAnother Me\n\nWritten and directed by Isabel Coixet\n\nWith Sophie Turner, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Claire Forlani, Gregg Sulkin, Rhys Ifans, Geraldine Chaplin, Leonor Watling\n\nU.K. Spain, 2013, 86’\n\nThe film will be distributed internationally by Fox International Productions.\n\nA psychological thriller about a teenage girl, Fay (Sophie Turner), whose once seemingly perfect life slowly begins to unravel when she suspects that she’s being stalked by a mysterious “double”, who is out to steal not just her identity, but her life.\n\nDallas Buyers Club\n\nDirected by Jean-Marc Vallée, written by Craig Borten & Melisa Wallack\n\nwith Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Jared Leto\n\nU.S., 2013, 117’\n\nThe film will be distributed internationally by Focus Features.\n\nIn 1985, the devil-may-care existence of Ron, an electrician and rodeo cowboy from Texas, is suddenly blindsided by an unexpected event; he is diagnosed as H.I.V.-positive and given thirty days to live. Despite what everyone says, Woodroof refuses to accept this “death sentence” and begins his struggle for survival. He soon discovers that there are no approved treatments in the United States, and so decides to cross the border into Mexico where he learns about alternative medical treatments, and begins to smuggle the new medications into the United States. Ron challenges the American scientific community and even his doctor Eva Saks (Jennifer Garner). An outsider to the gay community, the hero finds an unlikely ally in Rayon (Jared Leto), an H.I.V.-positive transsexual who shares Ron’s lust for life and entrepreneurial spirit. Seeking to avoid government sanctions against selling non-approved medicines, together they establish a “Buyers Club,” where AIDS patients pay monthly dues for access to the newly acquired supplies. Ron fights for dignity, for his new friends, and for the acceptance of their rights.\n\nHer\n\nWritten and directed by Spike Jonze\n\nwith Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, Scarlett Johansson\n\nU.S., 2013, 120’\n\nSet in Los Angeles, in the near future, Her follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a complex, soulful man who makes his living writing touching, personal letters for other people. Heartbroken after the end of a long relationship, he becomes intrigued with a new, advanced operating system, which promises to be an intuitive and unique entity in its own right. Upon initiating it, he is delighted to meet “Samantha,” a bright, female voice (Scarlett Johansson) who is insightful, sensitive and surprisingly funny. As her needs and desires grow, in tandem with his own, their friendship deepens into an eventual love for each other."
