        "text": "The concept of doubles seems to be a major preoccupation of many filmmakers at the moment. Richard Ayoade and Denis Villeneuve brought “The Double” and “Enemy” to TIFF, and now Rome will get their own flavor of twin attraction.\n\n“My Life Without Me” and “Elegy” director Isabel Coixet is bringing “Another Me,” to the Rome Film Festival. Featuring “Game Of Thrones” star Sophie Turner, aka Sansa Stark, she plays the teenage Fay whose once perfect life slowly begins to unravel when she suspects that she’s being stalked by a mysterious “double”, who is out to steal not just her identity, but her whole life.Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Claire Forlani, Gregg Sulkin, Rhys Ifans, Geraldine Chaplin and Leonar Watling co-star.\n\nEven with that film heading to Rome, Coixet isn’t stopping. She just wrapped “Learning To Drive” with Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley, and is lining up her next feature. Willem Dafoe, Juliette Binoche and Rinko Kikuchi will star in “Nobody Wants The Night.” Penned by Miguel Barros, the film will lens in Norway in early 2014, and follow two women, from two different worlds, and their struggle to survive in one of the most inhospitable places on Earth. Josephine (to be played by Binoche) is a proud yet naive woman in love with a man who prefers glory and ice to the comforts of an upper-class home. Allaka (to be played by Kikuchi), a young but wise Inuit woman, is in love with the same man with whom she’s expecting a child. Set against the backdrop of a relentless icy landscape, the film chronicles their long, tense wait for the same man they love in such distinct ways.\n\nSo lots to come from Coixet, who looks like’s poised to make a big impression over the next couple of years."
