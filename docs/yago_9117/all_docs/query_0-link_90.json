        "text": "Isabel Coixet was one of the big winners at this weekend’s Goya Awards, Spain’s counterpart to the Oscars. Per Screen Daily, Coixet took home prizes for best feature, best director, and best adapted screenplay for her latest film, “The Bookshop.” The Emily Mortimer-starrer centers on a woman in 1950s England who raises eyebrows when she decides to open a bookstore.\n\nPrior to the Goyas Coixet wrote about #MeToo for El Pais. Recounting her myriad experiences with industry sexism, she noted that no one questions male directors for making masculine films. “Whereas female directors have to defend and justify both actively and passively the right to tell stories about people who make their own beds, which for me is the real test of whether the director of a film is male or female, because in films written and directed by men, as in real life, none of the characters think to do it,” she observed.\n\nThe “Learning to Drive” director also called for women to protest gender inequality by wearing pajamas to the Goyas: “To go in pajamas and slippers with no make-up — it seems to me to be a lot more fun than putting on a black dress worth €10,000 from Dolce & Gabbana.” Alas, it was an idea that didn’t gain much traction. “Apart from three other nuts like me, I couldn’t convince anyone,” Coixet revealed. “So the Goya audience will miss the chance this year of seeing me in my Hello Kitty pajamas and unicorn slippers.”\n\nEven so, #MeToo’s presence was felt at the ceremony: audience members brought red fans that read #MasMujeres (more women).\n\nCoixet wasn’t the only female filmmaker to receive a Goya this year. Carla Simón was named best new director for “Summer 1993,” a drama about a young girl who loses her mother. Laura Ferrés’ “Los Desheredados” was named best documentary short. The doc is a portrait of Ferrés’ father as he copes with the demise of his business.\n\nCoixet previously won Goya Awards for writing (“My Life Without Me,” “The Secret Life of Words”), directing (“The Secret Life of Words”), and best documentary (“Escuchando al juez Garzón”).\n\n“The Bookshop” was released in Spain last November. No word on a North American release yet. Coixet’s upcoming projects include “Light on Broken Glass,” a musical about a veteran Broadway actress, and “Elisa y Marcela,” a narrative about Spain’s first same-sex marriage.\n\nAll of the female Goya winners are below. List adapted from Screen Daily."
