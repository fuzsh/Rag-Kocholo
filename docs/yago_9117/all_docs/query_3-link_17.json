        "text": "Gone Girl. Directed by David Fincher. (SPOILERS AHEAD FOR MOVIE AND NOVEL. This will all make sense to those of you have seen and read both.) After reading Gillian Flynn’s bestselling thriller-novel Gone Girl (a page-turner about a missing-person case and a marriage gone horribly wrong) late last year, I knew I had to hunker down and watch the film adaptation (which had just been released on DVD), especially since the Oscars were right around the corner. At the end of the day I was more surprised for what the Oscars didn’t get right with their nominations than what they did acknowledge, which was the film’s lone nod for Rosamund Pike’s performance as Amy Elliott Dunne. I’ve been a fan of Pike for years, so I know she’s capable of wonderful performances, but I can’t commit 100% to this particular role for her. The thing about reading the novel is that the way the story is structured – with all those diary entries – it makes for quite a stark contrast once you find out what Amy is really like. When you read those sympathetic diary notes, you imagine Amy to be the sympathetic character she wants you to believe she is. With this film adaptation, Fincher/Pike/Flynn don’t give us that luxury since Pike is ice-cold from the get-go. I can’t imagine anyone not knowing that something has to be off with Amy and that she would somehow be involved with what happened on the morning of July 5. This is not to say that Pike’s performance is bad, but I don’t feel affected by it in the same way that I was emotionally involved in the performance given by another nominee in the Best Actress field, Marion Cotillard (Two Days, One Night).\n\nBecause I knew which characters they played in the film, I pictured Ben Affleck and Neil Patrick Harris in their respective roles as Nick Dunne and Desi Collings while reading the novel. In the film I thought they both did really good work and “that scene” between Desi and Amy in the lake house was probably the best scene in the film, purely because the film dared to go even further and more horrific than what Gillian Flynn originally wrote in the novel. Other actors do well too, including Carrie Coon, Tyler Perry, Kim Dickens, Patrick Fugit, Lola Kirke, Scoot McNairy and Missi Pyle. I’d also add that I can’t believe that the film didn’t get Oscar nominations for the editing (Kirk Baxter) and the score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). The editing is particularly impressive; Gone Girl’s opening credits might be the fastest and most efficient that I’ve ever seen in a movie. There were also many notable moments in Jeff Cronenweth’s cinematography, like the observation of flashing paparazzi cameras as seen from the Dunne family cat’s perspective as it looks out the front door, although some of the gold-soaked scenes were a little too Steven Soderbergh-esque (in a bad ripoff way) for my taste.\n\nIn terms of aspects of the novel that were missing from the movie: I noticed a few omissions, like the interview done in the Bar, which was obviously cut for time. Things that I wish had been used in the movie, though: 1) Hilary Handy, 2) the fact that Nick’s first name is “Lance,” 3) more about Nick and Go’s father, 4) Desi’s mother [the fact that Desi lives with her, and also her resemblance to Amy], 5) the fact that Desi didn’t actually attempt suicide when he was going out with Amy – we see Nick confront Desi about this at the Collings home, to which Desi visibly reacts but says nothing, and we never hear Amy mention either in narration or dialogue that she was the architect behind that event [I can’t recall if the story was a complete lie or maybe Desi actually was found in her bed, but Amy had supplied the pills… but there was more to the story than what we hear in the film], 6) the ending as it is written in the novel, with the memorable final line that Nick says to Amy. Final verdict: Gone Girl is very entertaining. I just don’t think that any adaptation can adequately match the novel.\n\nLearning to Drive. Directed by Isabel Coixet. I saw Learning to Drive at a preview at the AMC Loews Lincoln Square 13 theater, a screening sponsored by the Museum of the Moving Image that featured a post-film Q&A with director Isabel Coixet and stars Patricia Clarkson, Ben Kingsley and Sarita Choudhury. I really enjoyed the experience; the film has a great leading role for Patricia Clarkson, the kind that she (and other actresses her age or older) rarely get unless they’re Meryl Streep. Clarkson does a beautiful job as Wendy, a book critic whose professor husband leaves her after cheating on her with one of his college students. Clarkson’s life is totally uprooted and she makes the first of several new decisions when fate brings her and driving instructor Darwan (Ben Kingsley, also excellent) together; Wendy, who has never driven before, takes on the challenge of overcoming her fears and learning how to take control both literally behind the wheel and metaphorically in the driver’s seat of her own life. Sarita Choudhury is also very good as Jasleen, Darwan’s new wife thanks to an arranged marriage. (It’s fun to see Samantha Bee too, playing one of Clarkson’s pals helping her with her divorce crisis, but the role isn’t particularly big.) All three main characters have to find ways to move forward in their lives and take charge of certain situations, which I think the actors, director Coixet and screenwriter Sarah Kernochan accomplish quite nicely. This kind of story has probably been done many, many times before, but Learning to Drive has some new takes on the narrative that give its middle-aged female protagonist (which is to say, the actress playing her) a marvelous showcase.\n\n99 Homes. Directed by Ramin Bahrani. Ah, it’s the most wonderful time of the year again: MoMA Contenders season! First up for 2015 was a screening of 99 Homes, which was extra exciting because at the last minute MoMA updated their website – literally an hour before the show – to say that there would be a post-screening Q&A with director Ramin Bahrani, so that was awesome. As for the film, it was excellent; I didn’t recall what kinds of reviews it got when it was first released to US theaters two months ago, so I decided not to check and to just experience the film as it happened. I thought it was a very fine piece of work, benefiting from a great screenplay, a terrific performance from Michael Shannon as a vicious real estate agent in charge of evicting Florida homeowners from foreclosed properties and an almost-as-good performance by Andrew Garfield as one such evicted (and rather desperate) man who is suckered into working for Shannon, first as a construction worker and later as a guy serving eviction notices to scared and angry families. Shannon and Garfield play their characters in a Faustian story line that morphs from social drama into tense thriller, witnessing escalations of threats and violence in various forms on both sides of homeowners’ doors. (It should be noted that Laura Dern and Tim Guinee are also good in their supporting, and less flashy, roles – Dern as Garfield’s mother, Guinee as a man fighting against being forced out of his home – but they are dependable actors who have never been anything less than good in film and on TV.) Bahrani’s screenplay is top-notch, easily one of the best that I’ve seen this year, so that helps make the film so successful; I’d also like to thank Bobby Bukowski for photographing perhaps my favorite shot of the year, when we see a juxtaposed image of Andrew Garfield and pool water, a visual metaphor for being “underwater” as it relates to mortgage terminology and over his head/drowning in other ways – what an amazing shot. I don’t know if 99 Homes will make it to the Oscars, but I can definitely see it being up for some Independent Spirit Awards. P.S. My favorite thing that Ramin Bahrani said during the Q&A: to paraphrase, describing the time he visited Michael Shannon at his home in Brooklyn, Shannon appearing golden-tanned with a wisp of blonde hair curling on his forehead, looking “like a god had come down to Red Hook. Why hadn’t I ever seen him look that handsome in a movie?” (Bahrani did indeed address this issue in 99 Homes.)\n\nThat Awkward Moment. Directed by Tom Gormican. That awkward moment… when you waste time watching this movie. (Seriously, why did I do that to myself? And why did you offer this as programming, HBO Signature?) Starring in a failed romantic comedy about a group of guys determined to have only flings and no serious relationships, Michael B. Jordan is the only one of the three main bros who appears to have a heart and a sense of right and wrong. Zac Efron’s hideous character starts out as a sociopath, treating every casual hook-up like she’s a disposable paper plate to be used for the night and immediately thrown away; Miles Teller’s character, despite being cute and goofy, is overwhelmed by his more weaselly qualities in the dating department. The film’s gratuitous display of assholery is saved only by Imogen Poots’ performance as the woman with whom Efron falls in love, thus redeeming him in the third act in true Hollywood fashion; Poots’ character is the only female character in the film with any kind of development in Gormican’s laughable script. Mackenzie Davis’s character, the young woman dating Teller, has the potential to be interesting (particularly in the scene when she sings and plays the piano) but the film never turns her quirky-funny-girl routine into something more sustainable. Addison Timlin also had some OK moments as one of Efron’s frequent hook-ups. I didn’t understand Josh Pais’s character at all, though; as a co-worker at the publishing firm where Efron and Teller work, Pais only pops up to display some awkwardness (gong!) by cracking unfunny jokes that scream “NERD!” and which make the actor seem extremely uncomfortable. Every now and then Brandon Trost’s cinematography helped things along, but it was always too brief a respite; for 95% of the film, every aspect from the acting to the uninspired dialogue to the predictably poppy soundtrack choices (with the exception of “Still Life” by the Horrors) combined to drag this dung heap down. The cruelest blow of all? The film wasn’t nominated for any Razzies. All that hard work for nothing!\n\nWelcome to Me. Directed by Shira Piven. This dark comedy has a very good lead performance by Kristen Wiig, who anchors the film with both a sense of absurdist comedy and a dedicated portrayal of mental and emotional instability. The film’s story is built on an intriguing concept: what would happen if a woman with borderline personality disorder won the lottery, used her money to buy a TV studio and, despite having little to no social skill, gave herself her own Oprah-like talk show to host? Wiig almost makes this folly believable, but most of the other performances in the film either fall short of Wiig’s mark or are not in the film long enough to register. (How, may I ask, can you cast an actress as good as Loretta Devine and put her in only one scene?) I really liked Linda Cardellini, Joan Cusack and Thomas Mann in the film, and Joyce Hiller Piven and Jack Wallace have some great little moments as Wiig’s parents, but other characters just… I don’t know, weren’t necessary or weren’t given dialogue that could amount to anything. I don’t see what the point of Jennifer Jason Leigh’s character was (a TV exec who has no authority and quits in disgust, how fascinating) and all Tim Robbins did was act like a sourpuss as Wiig’s psychiatrist. I support women directors 100%, so I would give Shira Piven (older sister of actor Jeremy Piven) another shot, but the ultimate shortcoming in this film is that the screenplay is so predictable. There are far too many moments of dead air – television pun intended. Wiig can do great things, and she almost achieves a kind of greatness here, but she needs better work happening around her to support her acting, or the whole thing goes to pieces. Additional note: If you’re one of those people who only wants to see Welcome to Me because you’re interested in Kristen Wiig’s full-frontal nude scene, you might as well look elsewhere on the Internet or crack open a skin magazine because Wiig’s scene is shown in the context of a mental breakdown. It’s not supposed to be sexy.\n\nDirector Isabel Coixet on the set of My Life Without Me in 2002.\n\nThis month Turner Classic Movies has been broadcasting a series of films from female directors as part of their “Trailblazing Women” series, airing on every Tuesday and Thursday in October. While four dozen groundbreaking women have been included in the schedule, which is hosted by actress/writer/producer Illeana Douglas, there are more women and films that I would have chosen if I had curated the program. Here are a few examples.\n\nThe Last Stage (1948), dir. Wanda Jakubowska – Given that TCM’s programming is an overview of more than 100 years of filmmaking and there is only so much that can be included from each country and era (although the focus is primarily on works by American women), of course there are many notable directors who have not been included in the series. It would have been great to see works by María Luisa Bemberg (Argentina), Susanne Bier (Denmark), Muriel Box (England), Jane Campion (New Zealand), Vera Chytilová (Czechoslovakia/Czech Republic), Claire Denis (France), Safi Faye (Senegal), Marleen Gorris (Netherlands), Ann Hui (Hong Kong), Tahmineh Milani (Iran), María Novaro (Mexico) and Margarethe von Trotta (Germany), just to name a few. If I had to pick one particularly important foreign film to include, I would have chosen The Last Stage (1948), directed by Wanda Jakubowska (1907-1998). Jakubowska used her experiences as a Polish-Jewish survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp as the source material for a drama about women struggling with life and death in that camp. Nowadays moviegoers probably take it for granted that World War II is a popular topic for filmmakers – often considered “Oscar bait” depending on the amount of melodrama in the performances – but the subject meant something very different to Jakubowska, who lived through one of the most harrowing traumas imaginable and told her story at a time when the subject was still fresh (and painful) in many people’s minds, among the first filmmakers to make a movie about survival inside a concentration camp. Additionally Jakubowska utilized the horrifying realism of filming on location at Auschwitz.\n\nIndecent Desires (1968), dir. Doris Wishman – The exploitation (or “sexploitation”) films of the 1960s and 70s don’t get much airtime on TCM, except maybe late on Saturday night during the “Underground” block of programming for films that are not mainstream and considered a little too weird for the channel’s typical consumers. As a result, women like Dorothy Davenport (an early entrant in this field in the 1920s and 30s), Roberta Findlay (maker of many sexploitation, porn and horror movies between the 1960s and 1980s), Stephanie Rothman (a protegée of Roger Corman, directing sex, gore and crime in The Student Nurses, The Velvet Vampire and Terminal Island) and Barbara Peeters, the first woman to direct a biker flick (Bury Me an Angel), have been left off the list for this month. My own personal choice would be Doris Wishman (1912-2002), a director who tested the limits of taste on every possible occasion. To most eyes her films are poorly made, edited together haphazardly and displaying bizarre uses of ADR (the post-production dubbing of voices to match the actors’ mouths) which meant that dialogue never came out of anyone’s lips correctly. For those interested in the seedy, creepy world of mid-to-late-60s New York as seen on a super-low budget, Wishman’s films (which she often wrote and produced and sometimes edited) are fascinatingly weird and unquestionably unique. Indecent Desires (1968) is one of my favorites because it has all the best things you can get in a Wishman B-movie: random nudity (like when lead actress Sharon Kent answers her phone after getting home from work); strange camera angles (here is another character exercising, again a woman in the buff); the antagonist’s (Michael Alaimo) realization that Kent, with whom he is obsessed, resembles a doll he has at home (hence this superimposition over Kent’s image when Alaimo sees her on the street); my favorite part, a bizarre dream sequence in which Alaimo imagines a rendezvous with Kent, which also involves him looking at her body from oddly-positioned perspectives. All of this was photographed by C. Davis Smith, a cinematographer who also worked on Wishman’s most famous film (largely in part of the eye-catching title), Bad Girls Go to Hell (1965). I don’t know if Wishman kept working with so many of the same actors and crew members because they believed in some genuine talent of hers or because they just needed the paychecks, but I’d like to think that Smith saw something compelling in Wishman’s visions (and visuals) of women’s bodies, desires (for sex, money, the purported normalcy of marriage/being a housewife) and fears over upsetting the rules of polite society.\n\nVariety (1983), dir. Bette Gordon – Set in the parts of Times Square where films by Doris Wishman and other sexploitation and porn films would have been shown, Variety is the first feature film by Bette Gordon (b. 1950). It boasts a script by Kathy Acker, a feminist writer who was never one to shy away from bold imagery and sexually explicit dialogue. The protagonist of Variety (played by Sandy McLeod) takes a job as the ticket-seller at a porn theater’s box office and she subsequently changes her understanding of her friendships and romantic relationships, exploring what it means for a woman to be both attracted to and repulsed by the films shown in the theater and the men (and it’s always only men) who are in the audience.\n\nOrlando (1992), dir. Sally Potter – Lead actress Tilda Swinton blurs the distinctions between male and female in this adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s 1928 novel of the same name, for which director Sally Potter (b. 1949) also wrote the screenplay. Orlando’s story spans four hundred years as the immortal character changes from a man to a woman, evolving as he (then she) learns the conventions and fashions associated with the female body as England’s social norms and fashions transform over the centuries. Sally Potter also co-composed the film’s score, music that is particularly effective in the scene in which Orlando escapes one era’s limitations against women by running through a maze that leads her into another century.\n\nEve’s Bayou (1997), dir. Kasi Lemmons – One night of screenings focuses on African-American women directors, pointing the spotlight on Kathleen Collins (Losing Ground), Julie Dash (Daughters of the Dust), Leslie Harris (Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.) and Ava DuVernay (Middle of Nowhere). A major oversight on TCM’s part is Eve’s Bayou (1997), the debut feature by actress-turned-director Kasi Lemmons (b. 1961). The film is set in Louisiana circa 1962, telling the stories of many women in the Batiste family as seen through the eyes of ten-year-old Eve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett). A Southern Gothic feel pervades the film, which was also written by Kasi Lemmons and has more women behind the camera in the crucial tasks of cinematography (Amy Vincent), editing (Terilyn A. Shropshire), costume design (Karyn Wagner), art direction (Adele Plauche) and set decoration (Joanne Schmidt).\n\nMy Life Without Me (2003), dir. Isabel Coixet – This drama did not get good reviews when it came out, likened to Love Story and other sappy, overwrought tales of women diagnosed with terminal cancer. Isabel Coixet’s (b. 1960) film offers a beautiful lead performance by Canadian actress Sarah Polley (herself a director too), explaining the fears of a woman dying in her early 20s, the anger over leaving her two young children without a mother and the frustrations of having never done as much as she wanted to in her small-town life. Adjectives like “selfish” and “egocentric” were thrown around by Roger Ebert and A.O. Scott in their reviews, when they described Polley’s character’s decisions not to tell her family and friends about her illness and to embark on an affair, just to see what it would be like to sleep with a man other than her husband; I see these choices as realistic given the character’s terrible situation and the knowledge that she has so little time left to do anything, so she has the right to decide what she wants to do with her body and her mind.\n\nMe and You and Everyone We Know (2005), dir. Miranda July – It would be exciting if TCM could show Miranda July’s (b. 1974) debut feature, a dark comedy about misfits that pushes the boundaries of American independent film into unusual and sometimes taboo places. It also offers the rare opportunity to see character actor John Hawkes play a romantic lead, a shoe salesman with whom July’s character falls in love. Their weird journey and the arcs of the supporting characters (including those of Hawkes’ two sons, the older of whom has disturbing encounters with two teenage girls and the younger of whom has online conversations with a pedophile) is unlike anything else that American women directors have been making.\n\nJoan Rivers: A Piece of Work (2010), dirs. Ricki Stern and Anne Sundberg – Joan Rivers was a certainly a trailblazer among women comedians, and this documentary by Ricki Stern and Anne Sundberg shows Rivers’ genius for telling jokes, her insecurities and the ups and downs of her relationship with her daughter Melissa after Rivers’ husband Edgar Rosenberg committed suicide in 1987. It is a revealing portrait of a pioneering comedienne. A little-remembered side note: Rivers herself was a director, making her one feature, Rabbit Test, in 1978.\n\nThe Kids Are All Right (2010), dir. Lisa Cholodenko – If the “Trailblazing Women” program included LGBT directors and stories, the dramedy The Kids Are All Right would be at the top of the list for me. Directed by openly gay filmmaker Lisa Cholodenko (b. 1964) and telling the story of a lesbian couple (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) whose teenage children (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson) find and meet their sperm-donor father (Mark Ruffalo), leading to trouble for all of the characters, the film probably wouldn’t be played on the channel due to all of the sexual content (TCM tends to shy away from too much of that). Even so, LGBT topics form an important canon in film history and there are so many women filmmakers who have tackled those issues, including Donna Deitch (Desert Hearts), Cheryl Dunye (The Watermelon Woman), Nisha Ganatra (Chutney Popcorn), Maryam Keshavarz (Circumstance), Maria Maggenti (The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love), Deepa Mehta (Fire), Kimberly Peirce (Boys Don’t Cry), Mariana Rondón (Bad Hair), Céline Sciamma (Tomboy) and Alice Wu (Saving Face).\n\nThe Babadook (2014), dir. Jennifer Kent – My favorite horror film of the last few years (it certainly has fans; The Exorcist director William Friedkin wrote on Twitter that “I’ve never seen a more terrifying film than The Babadook. It will scare the hell out of you as it did me.”) and a chilling look at a woman’s unraveling mind, The Babadook marks Australian actress Jennifer Kent’s directorial debut and provides an outstanding platform for Essie Davis, a longtime character actress who is now better known in the US thanks to her gutsy lead performance. The nightmarish dread of an unseen enemy casts a shadow (literally!) over Davis’s house, causing her psychological and physical torment and threatening the safety of her and her young son. It’s a daring, unforgettable film, challenging the viewers’ concepts of what it means to be a woman, a mother and a widow.\n\nA few months back I wrote a post on films directed by women that will be coming out in 2015. More films have been released since then, including The Riot Club (Lone Scherfig), Just Before I Go (Courteney Cox), Ride (Helen Hunt), Welcome to Me (Shira Piven) and Hot Pursuit (Anne Fletcher). Now there are also set release dates for two of the films I had briefly written about, the two Madame Bovary adaptations by Anne Fontaine and Sophie Barthes. To give you a sense of what’s coming up on the moviegoing schedule, here are sixteen films with release dates as soon as this Friday and as far off as November.\n\nMay 15: Every Secret Thing (dir. Amy Berg) – This crime drama about missing children, women detectives and women suspects has a screenplay by Nicole Holofcener (Enough Said) based on a novel by Laura Lippman. The film stars Diane Lane, Dakota Fanning, Elizabeth Banks (herself a new director with Pitch Perfect 2, coming out this Friday), Common, Nate Parker and Renée Elise Goldsberry.\n\nMay 15: Pitch Perfect 2 (dir. Elizabeth Banks) – Actress Banks makes her feature-length directorial debut with this sequel to the runaway musical hit from 2012. Banks has a supporting role in this new film but the main stars are Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Anna Camp, Adam DeVine, John Michael Higgins, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, Ben Platt, Alexis Knapp and Kelley Jakle, all of whom reprise their roles from the first installment as a cappella singers competing for dominance in nationwide and global contests. Newcomers to the franchise include Hailee Steinfeld, Katey Sagal, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen and Flula Borg. The screenplay is by Kay Cannon (who also wrote the script for the first Pitch Perfect film), based on the characters originally created by nonfiction writer Mickey Rapkin. Technically I wrote about Pitch Perfect 2 in the blog post that I linked to at the top of this page, but I figure a reminder can’t hurt since the film is coming out so soon.\n\nMay 22: Aloft (dir. Claudia Llosa) – Jennifer Connelly stars as a mother struggling to reconnect with the son she left twenty years earlier. The film also stars Cillian Murphy, Mélanie Laurent (who just directed a film, Breathe, which will probably be in U.S. theaters sometime this year), Peter McRobbie and Oona Chaplin (28-year-old daughter of Geraldine and granddaughter of Charlie). Aloft was nominated for the Golden Berlin Bear at last year’s Berlin International Film Festival and the director, Claudia Llosa (who also wrote the original screenplay), is most famous for her film The Milk of Sorrow (2009), which was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, representing Peru.\n\nMay 22: Sunshine Superman (dir. Marah Strauch) – Strauch’s documentary chronicles the life and career of skydiver/BASE jumper and aerial cinematographer Carl Boenish. Strauch also served as one of the film’s three editors.\n\nMay 29: Gemma Bovery (dir. Anne Fontaine) – The classic tale of Madame Bovary is updated to modern-day Normandy in this romantic dramedy adapted by director Anne Fontaine and Pascal Bonitzer from a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds. English actress Gemma Arterton stars in the title role, Niels Schneider and Jason Flemyng play two love interests and the rest of the cast is rounded out by Fabrice Luchini, Elsa Zylberstein, Pip Torrens, Edith Scob and Kacey Mottet Klein.\n\nJune 5: An Open Secret (dir. Amy Berg) – Just three weeks after her fiction film Every Secret Thing opens in theater, an Amy Berg-directed documentary will be released. This film tells the harrowing story of sex abuse perpetrated against teenage boys within the movie industry and how Hollywood hushed it all up. The film’s cinematography, Jenna Rosher, previously worked on Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s Jesus Camp (2006), Abby Epstein’s The Business of Being Born (2008) and Dori Berinstein’s Carol Channing: Larger Than Life (2012).\n\nJune 12: Madame Bovary (dir. Sophie Barthes) – This period-piece adaptation of Flaubert’s novel stars Mia Wasikowska in the title role as well as a supporting cast including Rhys Ifans, Paul Giamatti, Ezra Miller, Logan Marshall-Green, Laura Carmichael and Henry Lloyd-Hughes. The screenplay was written by director Sophie Barthes with Felipe Marino and the costumes were designed by Valérie Ranchoux with Christian Gasc.\n\nJune 12: The Wolfpack (dir. Crystal Moselle) – This documentary about a family living in near-seclusion in a New York City apartment caused quite a stir at Sundance, winning the festival’s Grand Jury Prize. The reason: “A subject matter this unusual may invite scrutiny yet the celebration of the power of imagination reflects the spirit of Sundance.” Moselle was not only the director but also the camera operator and one of the film’s producers.\n\nJune 19: Infinitely Polar Bear (dir. Maya Forbes) – Mark Ruffalo stars as a divorced father trying to win back his ex-wife, played by Zoe Saldana. Veteran actor Keir Dullea (David and Lisa, 2001: A Space Odyssey) also appears in the cast. Infinitely Polar Bear marks the directorial debut for writer-director Forbes, who has been writing and producing for film and television since the early 1990s.\n\nJune 26: Batkid Begins: The Wish Heard Around the World (dir. Dana Nachman) – The tale of five-year-old leukemia patient Miles Scott and his ambition to become “Batkid” inspired people nationwide and across the world. Miles’ story is told in this documentary co-produced by Nachman and Liza Meak and also executive- or assistant-produced by Teresa Fraley, Holly Jachowski and Kylie West, among others.\n\nJuly 24: Unexpected (dir. Kris Swanberg) – Swanberg directed and co-wrote (with Megan Mercier) this comedy about two surprise pregnancies. Nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, the cast includes Cobie Smulders, Anders Holm, Gail Bean and Elizabeth McGovern. The cinematography is by Dagmar Weaver-Madsen, who has won acclaim for her work on the film 10,000 KM, a romance by Spanish-American director Carlos Marques-Marcet which will be in U.S. theaters on July 10.\n\nAugust 7: The Diary of a Teenage Girl (dir. Marielle Heller) – Heller’s directorial debut, for which she adapted the screenplay from a novel by Phoebe Gloeckner, tells the story of fifteen-year-old Minnie (played by Bel Powley), a girl living in 1970s-era San Francisco and quite desperate to grow up. Kristen Wiig plays Powley’s mother, Alexander Skarsgård plays Wiig’s boyfriend (who also has relations with Powley) and Christopher Meloni plays Wiig’s ex-husband and Powley’s ex-stepdad. Diary was co-edited by Marie-Hélène Dozo (who has cut nearly all of the Dardenne brothers’ films since 1996) with Koen Timmerman, the costumes are by Carmen Grande, art direction is by Emily K. Rolph and set decoration is by Susan Alegria.\n\nAugust 21: Learning to Drive (dir. Isabel Coixet) – Spanish director Coixet has made many well-received romantic dramas in the last twenty years (Things I Never Told You, My Life Without Me, The Secret Life of Words, Elegy, etc.) but now she has made a romantic comedy. Written by New York-born Sarah Kernochan (who has been writing and directing for over forty years), the film stars Patricia Clarkson, Ben Kingsley, Sarita Choudhury, Jake Weber, Grace Gummer, Samantha Bee and John Hodgman. Legendary editor Thelma Schoonmaker co-edited the film with Keith Reamer.\n\nAugust 21: Sleeping with Other People (dir. Leslye Headland) – Three years after her directorial debut, Bachelorette (2012), Headland has written and directed another comedy, this time focusing on two sex addicts played by Alison Brie and Jason Sudeikis. Their bond, as well as their commitment not to have a relationship with each other, forms the basis for this update of the When Harry Met Sally… formula. Sleeping also stars Adam Scott, Natasha Lyonne, Amanda Peet, Jason Mantzoukas, Marc Blucas, Andrea Savage and Daniella Pineda.\n\nOctober 23: Suffragette (dir. Sarah Gavron) – A long-awaited biopic concerning major figures from the early days of the feminist movement in the UK, Carey Mulligan plays a young woman living in late 19th century/early 20th century England and fighting for the rights being denied to her and other women. Meryl Streep plays pivotal figure Emmeline Pankhurst, Helena Bonham Carter plays Edith New and other key characters are played by Brendan Gleeson, Ben Whishaw, Romola Garai, Anne-Marie Duff and Samuel West. Abi Morgan, who wrote Suffragette’s screenplay, also wrote or co-wrote screenplays for Sarah Gavron’s Brick Lane (2007), Steve McQueen’s Shame (2011), Phyllida Lloyd’s The Iron Lady (2011) and Ralph Fiennes’ The Invisible Woman (2013). Costume design is by Jane Petrie, production design is by Alice Normington and set decoration is by Barbara Herman-Skelding.\n\nNovember 13: By the Sea (dir.

It stars Jolie and husband Brad Pitt in a romantic drama set in France during the 1970s. The cast includes Mélanie Laurent, Melvil Poupaud, Niels Arestrup and Richard Bohringer. The film is being edited by Patricia Rommel, who edited Caroline Link’s Beyond Silence (1996) and Nowhere in Africa (2001), Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s The Lives of Others (2006), Michael Hoffman’s The Last Station (2009) and Angelina Jolie’s In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011)."
