Alan Fountain initially joined EAVE in 2000 and since that time actively served in several important capacities, from Head of Studies to our President. During his time with EAVE, he worked directly with over 1000 participants – from every corner of Europe as well as many from the rest of the world – doubtlessly changing their careers and profoundly affecting their professional lives.\n\nAn EAVE Producers Workshop scholarship has been set up in the name of, and especially to honour the memory of Alan Fountain. Donations are now being collected for the EAVE ALAN FOUNTAIN INTERNATIONAL SCHOLARSHIP FUND."
