        "text": "The Bookshop, which played in Berlin and was the winner of three Goya awards in Spain, was just acquired for U.S. distribution by Greenwich Entertainment. Written and directed by Spanish filmmaker Isabel Coixet (Learning to Drive) and based on a Man Booker Prize short-listed novel by Penelope Fitzgerald, the film stars Emily Mortimer (Mary Poppins Returns), Bill Nighy (The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel) and Patricia Clarkson (House of Cards). Greenwich Entertainment will release the title theatrically in the U.S. on August 24th.\n\nThe film Best Film, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay in Spain at the Goya Awards. The Bookshop recently opened in Spain where it grossed $3.5M in the market.\n\nThe Bookshop is set in a seaside village in England in the 1950’s where a widow (Mortimer) pursues her lifelong dream of opening a bookshop. As she introduces the townsfolk to the world’s best literature and stirs a cultural awakening, her efforts are ruthlessly opposed by a powerful local grand dame (Clarkson) causing a reclusive resident (Nighy) to join the fight to keep the bookshop open.\n\n“We’ve always admired Isabel’s work and her great leads so it’s a special treat to have the opportunity to handle the US release of this utterly charming and resonant ode to reading and bookshops,” says Greenwich’s co-managing director Ed Arentz.\n\nThe film was produced by Jaume Banacolocha, Joan Bas, Adolfo Blanco and Chris Curling. The filmmakers were repped in the deal by Celsius’s Thierry Wase-Bailey who negotiated with Greenwich’s Arentz."
