        "text": "My Life Without Me (102 mins, 15) Directed by Isabel Coixet; starring Sarah Polley, Amanda Plummer, Scott Speedman, Deborah Harry\n\nThere have been numerous movies about terminally sick folk confronting death and putting their lives in order. Most have been Hollywood tearjerkers featuring middle-class women (eg, Margaret Sullavan in No Sad Songs for Me, Susan Sarandon in Stepmom, Barbara Hershey in Beaches). The masterpiece of the genre, however, is Kurosawa's Living which centres on a male civil servant in Tokyo.\n\nThe latest contribution is Isabel Coixet's My Life Without Me, a Spanish-Canadian co-production set in the blue-collar world of British Columbia. It's co-produced (though you'd never guess it) by Pedro Almodóvar and his brother, Agustín. The heroine, Anne (Sarah Polley), is a happily married 23-year-old mother of two little girls, living in a trailer park and employed as a night-cleaner at a university. She met her handsome husband, a construction worker, in Vancouver when he lent her his T-shirt to wipe away her tears at the final Nirvana concert.\n\nWhen the doctor tells her that her rapidly metastasising cancer leaves her three months to live, she decides to tell nobody. She then makes a list of things to do and does them. They include recording a birthday tape for each of her daughter's birthdays until they're 18, finding a new wife for her husband, having a fling with a new lover, putting her troubled mother back in the social swim, and visiting her jailed father whom she hasn't seen for a decade.\n\nThe movie is contrived, unconvincing and curiously unmoving, though not badly acted."
