        "text": "It was 2003, in the thick of the London Film Festival. I was taking a breather in between screenings when a friend said he had a spare ticket for a film made by a filmmaker I’d never heard of. When I watched the film, My Life Without Me , I made sure that I noted the director’s name – Catalan filmmaker Isabel Coixet. When I recount the storyline – a young mother of two (Sarah Polley) living in a trailer in Vancouver finds out she has only months to live and decides to utilise her remaining time to the fullest extent – it may sound like sentimental humbug, but it isn’t. Coixet’s treatment is clear-eyed; almost matter of fact, but the subject matter will make anyone but the most hard-hearted lachrymose.\n\nIn The Secret Life Of Words (2005), Polley is a diffident factory worker who ends up caring for a burn victim on an oilrig off the Northern Ireland coast. It is when I watched Coixet’s adaptation of Philip Roth’s Elegy (2008) I belatedly realised that at the heart of her best work is always a strong woman in isolation, in the sense that there might be people around her who she interacts with, but in reality the characters have a steely calm core. On the face of it, in Elegy, Ben Kingsley has the showboating role of a professor and sexual predator, but it is Penelope Cruz as his serene student who is the beating heart of the film.\n\nMap Of The Sounds of Tokyo (2009) centres on the mysterious Rinko Kikuchi who is a fish market worker and a assassin. Endless Night (2015), features two isolated women, Juliette Binoche and Kikuchi, who are at a remote island at the North Pole. Ben Kingsley, now as a Sikh cab driver dispensing homilies, turns up again in Coixet’s Learning to Drive (2014), but it is Patricia Clarkson as a New York writer with a failing marriage who the film revolves around.\n\nIt was with delight therefore that I watched Coixet’s The Bookshop (2017), based on Penelope Fitzgerald’s novel, where Emily Mortimer plays a widow who arrives in a small town in England in 1959 and starts a bookshop. Her actions incense the local grandees and soon she’s neck deep in local politics, much against her will. Delightfully, her decision to send a copy of Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 to the town curmudgeon (Bill Nighy) endears her to him, while her decision to stock Vladimir Nabokov’s Lolita adds fuel to her detractors’ fire. As a portrait of small town anomie, the film is perfect. Again, in keeping with the filmmaker’s running theme, the luminous Mortimer is perfectly civil, polite to a fault even, but possesses what I like to call the Coixet core. We can only see so much, but only up to the distance Coixet allows, leaving the core impenetrable.\n\nAnd now the world awaits Elisa y Marcela , due next year, about the first same-sex marriage in Spain that took place in 1901."
