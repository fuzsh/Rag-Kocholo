#99. Isabel Coixet’s Panda Eyes

Gist: Based on Cathy MacPhail’s young adult novel, Another Me, Coixet’s adaptation, which the director states takes its inspiration from The Ring, concerns identity anxiety in a teenage girl, featuring “Game of Thrones” star Sophie Turner in her film debut. Coixet, best known for her melancholy dramas like My Life Without Me (2001) and Elegy (2008), appears to be trying something new with her latest, which also features Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Claire Forlani, and Geraldine Chaplin.
