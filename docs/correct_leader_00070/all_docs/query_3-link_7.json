        "text": "Hata Tsutomu (born August 24, 1935, Tokyo, Japan—died August 28, 2017, Tokyo) was a politician who was briefly prime minister of Japan in 1994.\n\nHata was the son of a prosperous landowner who sat in the Diet (parliament) as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the 1950s and ’60s. After graduating from Seijo University, Hata led bus tours until 1969, when he was chosen by the LDP to succeed his father as a member of the House of Representatives for a rural district in Nagano prefecture. He was reelected thereafter and eventually advanced to hold several cabinet posts before serving as minister of finance in the government of Miyazawa Kiichi in 1991–92."
