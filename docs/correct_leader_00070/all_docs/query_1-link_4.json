In the aftermath of the resignation, the Japan Socialist Party supported Hata's candidacy but left the coalition due to differences over defense policy with the more conservative JRP, reducing the government to minority status in the House of Representatives.[1] This led to the fall of the government in June, when the Socialists formed a coalition deal with their traditional rivals, the Liberal Democratic Party and Hata resigned in favor of Tomiichi Murayama rather than face a confidence vote and force new elections.[2] The Hata cabinet had the shortest tenure of any in postwar Japanese history at 63 days in office, two days less than the Ishibashi cabinet. The parties that made up the coalition would later merge to form the New Frontier Party in December 1994.[3]\n\n25 April 1994\n\nAbsolute majority (256/511) required House of Representatives Choice First Vote Votes YTsutomu Hata\n\n274 / 511\n\nYohei Kono\n\n207 / 511\n\nTetsuzo Fuwa\n\n15 / 511\n\nBlank Ballot\n\n6 / 511\n\nAbstentions (Including Speaker and Deputy)\n\n9 / 511\n\nSource Political Data: Japanese Politics 1994\n\nRenewal\n\nKomeito\n\nDemocratic Socialist\n\nJapan New\n\nLiberal Reform League\n\nIndependent\n\nR = Member of the House of Representatives\n\nC = Member of the House of Councillors\n\nCabinet of Tsutomu Hata from April 28 to June 30, 1994 Portfolio Minister Term of Office Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Justice Shigeto Nagano [ja] C April 28, 1994 - May 8, 1994 Hiroshi Nakai R May 8, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Foreign Affairs Koji Kakizawa R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Finance Hirohisa Fujii R August 9, 1993 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Education Ryōko Akamatsu - August 9, 1993 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Health and Welfare Keigo Ōuchi R August 9, 1993 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Mutsuki Kato R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of International Trade and Industry Ejiro Hata R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Transport Nobuaki Futami R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Katsuyuki Higasa R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Labour Kunio Hatoyama R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Construction Koji Morimoto R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Minister of Home Affairs\n\nDirector of the National Public Safety Commission\n\nMinister in charge of political reform Hajime Ishii R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Management and Coordination Agency Koshiro Ishida R August 9, 1993 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Japan Defense Agency Atsushi Kanda R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Economic Planning Agency Yoshio Terasawa C April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Science and Technology Agency Mikio Omi R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Environment Agency Toshiko Hamayotsu C April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the National Land Agency Megumu Sato R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994 Director of the Hokkaido Development Agency\n\nDirector of the Okinawa Development Agency Moriyoshi Sato R April 28, 1994 - June 30, 1994\n\nMay 8 - Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano resigned after claiming that the Nanjing Massacre had not occurred and was replaced with Hiroshi Nakai.[4]\n\nNon-LDP and non-JCP Coalition"
