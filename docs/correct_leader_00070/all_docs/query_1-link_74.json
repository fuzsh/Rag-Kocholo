        "text": "In the meantime the regular news bulletins on television are being filled with the usual pictures of various Japanese politicians, all neatly dressed in dark business suits and surrounded by numerous acolytes, marching in groups up and down endless Diet corridors before disappearing into numerous smoke-filled rooms.\n\n''This show is called When The Suits Come Marching In,'' one longtime observer of this ritual wryly notes.\n\n''The rooms really are 'smoke-filled','' observed another, referring to the fog created by tobacco rather than politics.\n\nIt is impossible to know what is actually happening inside those rooms: Japanese TV coverage usually ends with pictures of closed doors. The politicians are generally not given to revealing their innermost calculations on camera.\n\nBut it is possible to infer the broad trends at work amid the endless intrigues.\n\nThe first is that Mr Hata, together with his close ally, the principal political schemer behind the coalition, Ichiro Ozawa, is working hard to succeed himself.\n\nMr Hata's resignation was pre-emptive on three counts. By announcing it an hour before the Diet no-confidence vote, he avoided the vote being taken.\n\nBy resigning, Mr Hata also removed any compulsion the Japan Socialists still felt to vote against the ruling coalition merely out of consideration of preserving face.\n\nOn April 27, the Socialists, who had voted for Mr Hata as prime minister on April 25, withdrew their support as a result of parliamentary manoeuvres aimed at improving the unity of the non-socialist coalition members.\n\nAs Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa negotiated last week for a Socialist return to the coalition, Socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama refused to budge from the basic demand that Mr Hata resign first and restore the status quo before April 25.\n\nBut a third reason for the resignation was equally important: it left everyone guessing as to how many members of the former ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and of the Socialists might defect into Mr Ozawa's ever-open arms.\n\nBy placating the Socialists, the Hata-Ozawa team left open the possibility that the reform-minded coalition could be reconstituted. By leaving everyone guessing, the Hata-Ozawa team furthered their goal of seeking to destroy what is often called ''the 1955 system'' in Japanese politics.\n\nThat system was, of course, 38 years of uninterrupted ostensible rule by the LDP, and 38 years of uninterrupted ostensible opposition by the Socialists - plus 38 years of uninterrupted power-wielding and policy-making by Japanese bureaucrats.\n\nMr Hata and Mr Ozawa were once the luminaries of that system, which is why their enemies question their conversion to the need for something different.\n\nHowever, it seems clear that Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa came to regard the 1955 system as stultifying Japanese democracy. Mr Ozawa has taken the rare step for a Japanese politician and written a book about making Japan a more ''normal'' nation, in which politicians make policy and two basically centrist parties compete for power like the Democrats and Republicans in the United States.\n\nSo, in those smoke-filled rooms, Mr Ozawa is trying hard to use Mr Hata's resignation to complete the work which he started when the first coalition leader, former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa, resigned in April. Mr Ozawa's preferred option is to win over enough defectors to form a like-minded coalition which no longer needs the Socialists.\n\nBut the second trend at work in the current crisis is that the LDP, under their leader Yohei Kono, have no intention of going gently into the night as Mr Ozawa desires.\n\nMr Kono may have supported the 1994 Reform Bills which aimed at ending the 1955 system, but that does not mean that he will easily give up the chance of restoring LDP hegemony.\n\nTo do that, he must first get one more general election under the old electoral system of multi-member constituencies and their bias towards the rural vote. If Mr Kono can accomplish that, then the 1994 electoral reforms, stipulating single member seats and proportional representation, might have to wait four years at the least, or be forgotten altogether. THIS is no idle dream even if it may prove difficult to realise. The LDP is still the largest party in the Diet with 206 seats in the lower house.\n\nAnother election under the old system could give it the 50 extra seats needed for a majority. It is even possible that the LDP would then impose 1955 upon 1994, as it moves to establish hegemony over the single-member seats.\n\nLDP leader Mr Kono has already thrown his hat into the prime ministerial ring. At the same time, he is anxiously looking over his shoulder to see if all his supporters are still loyally following him.\n\nMr Kono knows, for example, that Mr Ozawa has recently met former prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, the previous leader of the LDP faction now led by former foreign minister Michio Watanabe, whom Mr Ozawa has also been courting.\n\nEager to take revenge on Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa, Mr Kono has even offered to support Socialist leader Mr Murayama for the prime ministership.\n\nIn the present context, that could be a foolish manoeuvre. The very thought of the left-inclined Mr Murayama representing Japan at the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries, or making policy regarding Korea, would appear nicely calculated to remind Mr Nakasone and Mr Watanabe about what Mr Ozawa has been saying to them.\n\nThe third trend at work is that for one brief and maybe final moment the Socialists are in the happy position of controlling crucial swing votes.\n\nBut the Socialists have to be very careful how they play their cards.\n\nIf they merely back the LDP, it will regain power, and one day jettison them. If they merely back the coalition, Mr Hata might become the leader of the 66th post-war Japanese cabinet.\n\nSome of the Socialists would still like to defend the 1955 system and their eternal opposition role. They would therefore join a Kono Cabinet which promised one more election under the old rules.\n\nOther Socialists are mindful of the need for change and realise that, whatever move the party makes, it could be its swan-song in Japanese politics.\n\nNot surprisingly, Mr Murayama may put himself forward for the prime ministership, supported by the leader of the small Sakigake (New Pioneer) party Masayoshi Takemura, who dislikes and distrusts Mr Ozawa.\n\nGiven these trends, the only certainty is that were Mr Nakasone to turn up as prime minister of Japan in Naples, the other G7 members would sigh with relief that Japan was at least represented by a recognisable heavyweight.\n\nThe more important conclusion is that, as Mr Ozawa and Mr Kono battle it out, the development of a viable Japanese two-party system is becoming visible through the haze."
