        "text": "(Clearwisdom.net) In the past several months, Dafa practitioners in Japan have been unceasingly appealing in front of the Japanese Parliament building. Our hope is that the Japanese government and people from all walks of life will help rescue Yoko Kaneko.\n\nMore and more members of the Japanese Parliament have begun to support our petition. We met some Parliament members, whom we were previously unable to see even when we went to their offices to visit them, and presented truth-clarifying materials to them. We were able to clarify the truth in a deeper and more refined way with them. After they understood the truth of the persecution, many Japanese Parliament members stated that they would support us in opposing the inhuman persecution. Some Members asked for more detailed information about Yoko Kaneko, and then signed the petition.\n\nOn October 3, former Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata passed by our appeal group, and saw our banner which read: \"Appeal to the Japanese government to urgently rescue Ms. Yoko Kaneko who is now being detained in China.\" A practitioner recognized him and then started to talk with him. The former Prime Minister accepted the truth-clarifying materials, and immediately signed his name on the petition. Three other government officials, who were with him, also added their names to the list."
