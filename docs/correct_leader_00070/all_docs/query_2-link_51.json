        "text": "When the heat is on, losing the suit and tie could be a way to reduce the energy consumption from air-conditioning. Photograph: Dan Chung\n\nTsutomu Hata was ahead of his time. In 1994, the then-Japanese prime minister appeared in public wearing what he described as an energy-saving suit. This wasn't some hi-tech Honda-designed outfit that allowed him to work for twice as long without the need for sleep or coffee, but rather a conventional office suit with the sleeves chopped off at the elbow.\n\nThe idea was to encourage Japanese office workers to dress down in the summer so that their companies could turn down the air conditioning, and hence save some energy. Hata's half-sleeve jacket look never quite caught on, but his wear-less-to-work concept has proven more durable.\n\nLast month, Japan's current prime minister, Yasuo Fukuda, joined in the fun by ditching his suit and tie in favour of a Kariyushi shirt - a lightweight short-sleeved shirt from Japan's Okinawa region. Unlike Hata's bold gesture, Fukuda's outfit change was fully expected and barely even commented on. For the last four years the Japanese government has been running an extremely successful campaign to get office workers to wear fewer clothes. The environment ministry estimates that around a third of the country's offices take part in the Cool Biz initiative, turning down their air conditioning units and saving millions of tonnes of C02 emissions in the process.\n\nHere in the UK, we may not have such a pressing need for campaigns to cope with the summer heat, but for those few days each year when the sun does finally show its face, it would be much greener if we too wore fewer clothes to work rather than cranking up the air conditioning. Of course, for it to work, everyone in the office will need to dress down, so there's no point just turning up to the office in your Bermuda shorts and expecting all the fans to be switched off.\n\nIf you are inspired to suggest the idea to your co-workers - and you may need to word the proposal carefully to avoid any embarrassing misunderstandings regarding your intentions - there is a precedent in this country. In July 2006, as we headed into a minor heatwave, the TUC launched its own Cool Work campaign, mirroring the Japanese approach. It asked employers to relax dress codes in the summer for the sake of the environment. Not only would staff be able to work more efficiently, it said, but companies would save money.\n\nOf course, for some people, dressing down opens up the can of fashionista worms that used to come out on school mufti days. Suddenly, instead of putting on the regulation suit or school uniform, you're forced into making a public statement about yourself. And for some of us, that's an unnerving proposition.\n\nIn Japan, this obstacle was pre-empted by getting fashion designers to design alternative Cool Biz work styles. They even have Cool Biz fashion shows [like this one in Hong Kong] and a Cool Biz manual, offering advice on matching belts and shoes.\n\nSo, what do you think? If it does get hot this summer, are shorts and T-shirts suitable office attire? Or would you need a copy of that Cool Biz manual first?"
