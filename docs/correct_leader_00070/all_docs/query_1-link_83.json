        "text": "@\n\n@On July forth, Philippine team left for Manila from Kansai Airport. Japanese team also left for Tokyo. All members exercised full expert for a month's performance in Japan, and now, our eyes are on the performance in Philippine, though at present we are at the peak of fatigue.\n\n@I believe everyone involved in the Japanese stages\\not only main casts and stuff but also local casts and supporters\\feels deep friendship between the Philippines and Japan. I cannot express how I am glad. I want to thank all of you for your strong supports.\n\n@We were honored to have the attendance of such celebrities including Akishino-no-miya prince and princess, representatives of the Japanese Diet such as the former Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Philippine Ambassador and the Chief Advisor of the Executive Committee and Ambassadress, and Ambassadors of other countries, among others. We received utmost praise by them all. As mentioned in the column on the first page of Tokyo Shinbun newspaper on June 30, I wish the teaching in the Bible and the theme of this opera \"all those who take swords shall be perished by the swards\" reached the hearts of the audience.\n\n@The former Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, the original author Otsuhiko Kaga and Philippine Ambassador attended the performance twice. According to their precious advices, we made small changes beginning the second performance at Tokyo Bunka-kalian on June 26 (changes include skipping intervals between Acts and removing all objets d'art other than large cross on the stage). We made additional modifications for the performance at Takaoka and thereafter as follows:\n\n@/Clarifies that the Act one is the reminiscence of Ukon (re-edit projector images).\n\n@/ Shortens whole performance a little (still on work with Composer Professor Malamba).\n\n@/ Inserts short explanations for better understanding.\n\n@/ Re-composes some parts\n\n@|Persuasion by Admiral Silva to Ukon in Act II: To give more strong impression.\n\n@|The scene in the heaven in Act II:\n\n@@To reduce overlap of songs to make scripts clearer and understandable.\n\n@We are moving onto the preparation for the performance in Philippine now. We will organize 25-members team from all over Japan and leave Narita on August 22 to join the Philippine team. There will be six stages in Philippine. After two-dayfs joint rehearsal in Manila, the performance is to be held in Davao on August 25, then in Cebu on August 27 by 40-members joint team (25 Japanese and 15 Philippines). With the participation of the Saint Tomas University chorus team and orchestra, the last four stages are scheduled at Philam Life Theater in Manila on August 29 through 31. We will return Japan on September 1 (the performance in Baguio is canceled). Please confirm Rajah Tours (03-3491-5133) for the accompanying tour to Manila.\n\n@My dream \"making the world peaceful and happy through opera\" has already involved many people not only in Japan but also in Europe, China, Philippine, and so on. I understand my responsibility and think that the reason why so many people corporate us is because many people share this dream as well. In an era that media seems to report only awful news, people might be able to do nothing other than entrust a few idolatrized famous people to realize their temporarily dream. It sounds sad to my ears. In this opera, there is a passage where Hideyoshi told Ukon, \"Life is just a dream. If so, I think the bigger is the better, don't I.\" I do not know what the bigger dream means, but I think that each of us can live with our own bigger dream. There are a lot of ordinary and still outshining people around us all over the world. It is ashamed if we do not realize this. Incidentally, some of our stuff seems to have recognized that Filipinos always praise other people, instead of accusing them. With praying the message of \"if only we open the heart, we can feel we are tenderly embraced in God' love\" to reach many people, we begin to prepare for the performance in Philippine scheduled in the end of August.\n\n@What I have in my mind after \"Ukon\"? Well, god only knows! I know you must not be content with this answerc Please remember my first original opera \"Forgotten boys\" participated in the Europe Music Festival and had the honor that the Roman Pope listened to it. Guess what I have in mind for the next move. One thing is crystal clear, howevercI cannot do anything without your corporation. I thank you and urge your further corporation!\n\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n\n@"
