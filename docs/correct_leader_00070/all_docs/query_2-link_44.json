DATE: THURSDAY, June 30, 1994 TAG: 9406300129 SECTION: NATIONAL/INTERNATIONAL PAGE: A1 EDITION: METRO SOURCE: Associated Press Note: below DATELINE: TOKYO LENGTH: Medium\n\nJAPAN PICKS SOCIALIST AS NEW PRIME MINISTER\n\nStruggling to end political chaos before a summit of global economic giants, Parliament chose as premier Wednesday a fisherman's son whose party has opposed U.S. bases in Japan, nuclear power and sanctions on North Korea.\n\nThe selection of Tomiichi Murayama, the first Socialist prime minister since 1948, arose from a once-unthinkable alliance of left-wing and conservative forces that was sure to keep his power in check.\n\nHe is Japan's fourth head of government in a year, and his term may prove just as brief.\n\nBut the choice, on a 261-214 vote in Parliament's lower house, was certain to raise questions about Japan's foreign policy commitments.\n\nThe deal cut off jockeying for power that has hampered Japan's efforts to boost the economy out of a long recession and resolve trade disputes with Washington. But major action seems unlikely, given the wide differences in the new coalition.\n\nTsutomu Hata had to resign as prime minister Saturday because his coalition lacked a majority in Parliament after the Socialists quit his alliance. Hata was in office two months.\n\n``This is my first time to speak from such a position,'' Murayama said after Wednesday's vote. ``My heart is throbbing.''\n\nAlthough he heads the new coalition, it will be dominated by the conservative Liberal Democrats, who ruled from 1955 until they lost their parliamentary edge in an election last summer following corruption scandals.\n\nMurayama's selection brings to power an unlikely alliance of Japan's most left-leaning and conservative political forces.\n\nHe said before Wednesday's vote that he planned to dissolve Parliament and call general elections.\n\nHe is unlikely to do so, however, until after the annual summit of the world's seven strongest industrial nations that begins July 8 in Naples, Italy.\n\nA Socialist-led government is bound to raise doubts about Japan's policies toward North Korea and its other foreign policy commitments.\n\nThe Socialists have maintained close ties with North Korea's hard-line communist leaders and they initially opposed international moves to impose sanctions on North Korea over its refusal to allow U.N. nuclear inspections.\n\nBut with the Liberal Democrats more numerous in the coalition, the Socialists are unlikely to bring significant changes to economic and foreign policies.\n\nby CNB"
