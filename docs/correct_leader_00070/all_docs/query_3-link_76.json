        "text": "Japan was not the aggressor in World War II and accounts of a notorious massacre by Japanese soldiers in Nanking, China, were a hoax, Japan's new justice minister said in an interview published Wednesday.\n\nThe remarks are likely to stir resentment abroad.\n\nWhile the views voiced by Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano to the newspaper Mainichi are espoused by a number of conservative Japanese, it is rare to hear them from a Cabinet minister.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry released a statement from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is traveling in Europe, saying he thought Nagano's comment about the \"Rape of Nanking\" was not appropriate.\n\nThe remarks prompted an angry reaction today from Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said past Japanese leaders already have acknowledged and apologized for their country's war actions.\n\n\"Now that nearly 50 years have passed since the end of the war . . . a Japanese Cabinet member went so far as to publicly distort the history, deny historical fact and defend the Japanese militarists' aggression. We are shocked and indignant,\" the statement said.\n\nThe number of Chinese killed in the Nanking remains a matter of speculation. China says 300,000 were killed when Japanese troops entered Nanking _ now called Nanjing _ in 1937.\n\nSome prominent Japanese claim the Chinese death toll is propaganda, but at least one former Japanese officer puts the figure at at least 150,000.\n\n\"I think the Nanking massacres and other (reports of wrongdoing) are hoaxes,\" Nagano told Mainichi. He said he based his view on a visit to the city shortly after Japan began its occupation there.\n\nNagano, 71, retired as chief of staff of Japan's army in 1980. He graduated from the former elite Japanese military academy and served in the Imperial Army in the war.\n\nIn the quoted remarks, Nagano said Japan's aim during the war was to free Asian nations from European colonialism. \"It is wrong to say the war was a war of aggression,\" he said. \"We thought seriously about the liberation of colonies, to liberate a (greater East Asia) co-prosperity sphere.\"\n\nThe comments are a clear departure from the conciliatory views of Japan's previous government, which left office last week. Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called World War II a war of aggression and said it was wrong."
