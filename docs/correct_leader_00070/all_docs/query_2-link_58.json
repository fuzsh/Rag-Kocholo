        "text": "Japan's ruling coalition struggled without success Saturday to unite behind a replacement for popular Prime Minister Hosokawa, whose abrupt announcement a day earlier that he was resigning left the country's political landscape in shambles.\n\nPoliticians present at the closed-door session said the eight coalition parties were able to agree only on the need to pick a leader in the next few days. More meetings were set for Sunday.Infighting has always been a problem for the 8-month-old alliance, and its inability to swiftly pick a new leader raised fears of an extended bout of political gridlock.\n\nForeign Minister Tsutomu Hata was seen as a strong candidate to replace Hosokawa, but he apparently has not managed to nail down the needed backing.\n\n\"We're not at the point of saying who would be good or not,\" said Tomiichi Murayama, secretary-general of the Socialists, the largest bloc in the coalition.\n\nAlso unanswered were questions about the fate of ambitious economic reforms Hosokawa was unable to push through, and how the political paralysis would affect international issues such as the North Korean nuclear threat and Japan's troubled trade relations with the United States.\n\nHosokawa, who is stepping down amid mounting pressure over possible past financial improprieties, gave no indication he was having second thoughts about giving up his post. He told reporters he had a good night's sleep.\n\nThe 56-year-old prime minister took office pledging to clean up Japan's dirty politics, and did manage to get a political-reform package approved during his brief tenure. But in the end he was felled by the same sort of money-for-favors scandal that has brought down four of the last five governments.\n\nDebate over the scandal had blocked parliamentary business for the past month, halting work on the budget for this fiscal year and other initiatives.\n\nHosokawa, who will stay in office until his successor is approved by Parliament, said he hoped the new government would pursue his efforts to make sweeping cutbacks in bureaucratic regulations that hinder foreign access to Japanese markets.\n\n\"Having achieved the goal of political reforms, we have since been entrusted with the task of economic reforms, and I am sure this is something that the new Cabinet will also pursue,\" he said today.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition Liberal Democrats, who governed for nearly four decades until they were toppled by Hosokawa's coalition, were trying to determine if the unexpected turn of events would give them a chance to again seize control."
