        "text": "Japan's justice minister stepped down Monday amid a political storm over his handling of Arnold Schwarzenegger's entry into the country without a passport.\n\nShozaburo Nakamura, 64, offered his resignation to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, apologizing for sparking strident protests by opposition lawmakers that paralyzed Parliament last week.\n\n\"I am sorry my words and actions hindered the workings of Parliament,\" Nakamura was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service.\n\nThe resignation was the second to hit Obuchi's government since he took office last summer. But the prime minister's rising popularity ratings indicated his government was not in danger of falling.\n\nUpper house lawmaker Takao Jinnouchi, 65, was sworn in late Monday as Nakamura's replacement.\n\n\"I deeply recognize the importance of my job during these harsh times for Japan and other nations and will try my best for our country's prosperity and development,\" Jinnouchi said in a statement.\n\nThe Schwarzenegger controversy centers on allegations that Nakamura, a fan of the former weightlifter, took home ministry documents that permitted the actor to enter Japan last October without a passport.\n\nThe documents should have been filed with the ministry, but critics say Nakamura kept them as a souvenir. Nakamura reportedly said an aide simply neglected to file the paperwork properly.\n\nNakamura gave Schwarzenegger permission to enter the country through an airport in Osaka, in western Japan, on Oct. 27, though he did not have his passport. The star said later it was stolen just before he left the United States.\n\nAsked at the time about helping the star of such films as \"Terminator,\" Nakamura was quoted by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper as telling a news conference: \"If I hadn't said yes, I would have been killed by my wife and daughter, who are his fans.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger, who has appeared in Japanese television commercials for instant noodles, beer and cable TV, was in Japan to attend an opening ceremony for a Universal Studios theme park.\n\nOpposition parties welcomed the minister's resignation and called on the Obuchi administration to take responsibility for the controversy.\n\nNakamura was \"unqualified\" to be justice minister, said Tsutomu Hata, a former prime minister and secretary general of the opposition Democratic Party.\n\n\"This calls into question the validity of Obuchi's power itself,\" Hata was quoted by Kyodo as saying.\n\nThe paperwork dispute added to Nakamura's declining popularity. In January, he was criticized after suggesting in a widely reported speech to members of his ministry that Japan should revise its U.S.-written constitution to allow it more military freedom.\n\nNakamura also reportedly criticized U.S. economic policy in the speech, comparing it to attacking an adversary with \"atomic bombs and missiles when another country looks to be winning.\"\n\nThe comment was seen as a possible irritant to already-tense U.S.-Japan trade relations.\n\nThe first official under Obuchi to resign was the head of Japan's Defense Agency, Fukushiro Nukaga, who stepped down in November amid a scandal over procurement contracts for military equipment.\n\nÂ©1999 CBS Worldwide Corp.
