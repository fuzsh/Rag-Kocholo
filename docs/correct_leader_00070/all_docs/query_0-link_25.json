Mr Hata, 58, who is currently Foreign Minister, is due to be voted into office by the Japanese Diet (parliament) on Monday.\n\nHe will succeed Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned two weeks ago over a financial scandal. It had looked as if the coalition would collapse before a compromise was reached, though commentators predict disagreements may continue."
