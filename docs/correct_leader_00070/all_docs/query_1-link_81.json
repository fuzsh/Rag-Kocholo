        "text": "FOR A FEW HOURS, IT LOOKED AS IF PRIME MINISTER Kiichi Miyazawa would weaken his political opponents in a shrewdly orchestrated maneuver. When Michio Watanabe, 69, announced he would resign from his post of Foreign Minister owing to poor health, Miyazawa offered the position to former Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata. Hata heads a rebellious faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and has hinted that he might create a new party. Miyazawa apparently thought he could distract Hata from his cause by luring the renegade into his Cabinet with a prestigious post. Hata, however, declined the offer, saying he wanted to “stay in the field to pursue political reform.” The post then went to a former Trade Minister, Kabun Muto, whose appointment is unlikely to change Japan’s foreign policy."
