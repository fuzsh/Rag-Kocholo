        "text": "A former imperial army officer who served a little more than a week as Japan's justice minister was dismissed Saturday, three days after he provoked protests throughout Asia by declaring that one of the biggest massacres of World War II, the Rape of Nanking, was a \"fabrication.\"\n\nPrime Minister Tsutomu Hata asked the justice minister, Shigeto Nagano, for his resignation as Japan tried to quell growing outrage over the remarks all over Asia. Hata appointed a new justice minister, Hiroshi Nakai, 51, late Saturday night. Nakai is a lawmaker from the Democratic Socialist Party.\n\n\"The bad effects caused in neighboring countries has reached a worrisome stage,\" Hata reportedly said, according to Japanese news accounts. \"We have to stop the further spread of this trouble.\"\n\nThe decision to dismiss Nagano came despite his effort Friday to withdraw his remarks.\n\nSome Japanese officials, trying to put the best face on the handling of a highly embarrassing incident, said Nagano's ouster showed that there was no longer any political tolerance for efforts to play down Japan's wartime responsibility.\n\nNagano said in the interview that the massacre in the eastern Chinese city in 1937 had never happened, and cited as evidence his arrival \"shortly afterward\" as a young imperial army officer.\n\nIt turned out that his first visit there was in August 1941. Most historians say the massacre, which began December 1937 and continued for six weeks, killed more than 150,000 civilians. The Chinese put the death toll at 300,000."
