DPJ Supreme Adviser Tsutomu Hata and Secretary General Yukio Hatoyama met with United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a hotel in Tokyo on July 1. Also in attendance were Tetsundo Iwakuni, Director-General of the DPJ's International Department, Tenzo Okumura, Head of the Executive Office and Yukihisa Fujita, Vice Director-General of the International Department.

At the start of the meeting, Supreme Adviser Hata welcomed Secretary-General Ban and asked him about his visit to the Koryu-ji temple in Kyoto earlier in his current visit to Japan. Secretary-General Ban said, "The name of Hata - no - Kawakatsu, who founded the Koryu-ji, reminded me of former Prime Minister Hata". He then referred to the long history of exchanges between Japan and South Korea.

Hatoyama paid tribute to Secretary-General Ban's initiatives to tackle worldwide water problems. He then pointed out that, on the issue of greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the DPJ had proposed a reduction of 25% by 2020 but that in contrast Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's Administration had not put forward any concrete figures. Hatoyama stressed that the government should do so before the upcoming G8 Hokkaido Toyako Summit. Secretary General Ban responded by saying that long-term goals must be supported by concrete intermediate goals, and that he hoped that the Japanese government would announce intermediate term emissions reduction targets. In addition, he expressed his expectations for Japan's political leadership at the G8 Summit, and stated that he would personally work to influence international leaders.
