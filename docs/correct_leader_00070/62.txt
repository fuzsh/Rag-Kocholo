Tsutomu Hata took the oath of office in front of Emperor Akihito today and formally took over as Japan's 51st prime minister.

Hata, elected by Parliament on Monday, appeared condemned to form a minority government unless he could succeed in last-ditch efforts to lure the angry Socialists back into the ruling coalition.

The Socialists walked out Tuesday, depriving Hata of his parliamentary majority and raising prospects of a period of weak government followed by early elections.

Two hours after his swearing-in, Hata was scheduled to meet Socialist leader Tomiichi Murayama in a final appeal for unity, but prospects for success looked slim.

Hata takes over from Morihiro Hosokawa, who resigned April 8 after just eight months in office because of political disputes and controversy over his personal finances.
