        "text": "Sometimes it is best to look for specific examples.\n\nWhen I see mention of ships heading to young colonies I go to genealogy sites to look for information. The Geni site has a list of British Ships to South Africa in the 1800's. The time frame you mention is a bit out of the main emmigrant wave in the late 1850s, but you can find a few examples from the 1840s. I located one which doesn't quite match your specifications, being out of Portsmouth instead of Liverpool, but I think the detail of information from the Geni page on the voyage of the Recorder from January to March 1846 might be useful for your research.\n\nThe link connects to a transcription, actual information from an actual journey which took place:\n\nJournal of the Ship Recorder Bound to the Cape of Good Hope with Emigrants\n\nThe following is a transcription of the Journal held at the National Archives, Kew (Ref CO48/262). The Journal written by Mr William Williamson, Surgeon Superintendent on board the Ship Recorder during its journey from Southampton, England to Algoa Bay, South Africa from December 1845 to May 1846. It gives an amazing insight into life onboard an Emigrant Ship during this period.\n\nNext a little concerning the ship and purpose of the voyage:\n\nEmigrants leaving for the Colonies From Portsmouth Harbour\n\n11 Dec 1845 Embarkation/ Inspection of berths etc Arrived on Board the Ship Recorder 630 ton register Captain SHARPE, chartered for the conveyance of Emigrants to the Cape of Good Hope, on Government bounty –\n\n(emphasis mine ) Note this ship is not a general trader, but a passenger ship. Her purpose is to transport colonists, emigrants to Britain's new Cape Colony.\n\nHere are some details are provided about the number of passengers:\n\nNumber of emigrants embarked on board the ship Recorder bound for the Cape of Good Hope.\n\nADULTS Married: 39 males, 39 females 78 total Single: 59 males, 13 females, 72 total Totals: 98 males, 52 females, 150 total\n\nCHILDREN Between 1 and 14: 29 males, 30 females, 59 total Under 1 year: 4 males, 6 females, 10 total Totals: 33 males, 35 females, 69 total\n\nTotal no. of Souls: 219 Or equal to 179 ½ statute adults\n\nI certify the above mentioned to be the number of Emigrants delivered into my charge on board the Ship Recorder and that there is not apparent among them any sickness of consequence, or any infectious disorder capable of proving dangerous to the passengers: Signed: Mr WILLIAMSON MD, Surgeon Superintendent Plymouth Sound, 9th January 1846\n\nSo 219 passengers are ready to be begin the trip as recorded on 9 Jan 1846. The journal then continues on a day by day basis, much to extensive to preproduce in answer form here. It details daily weather, discusses other ships encountered along the journey, occasionally recording Latitude and Longitude positions. Interesting to glance over, and some mundane details of crew and passenger issues are mentioned, providing some insight into the journey.\n\nThe ship arrives at Cape Town (Table Bay) on April 12th after a 3 month (93 day) voyage:\n\n12th Arrival in Table Bay By 6’o clock am sighted Table Mountain bearing S E by E. The wind lulling all sail was set again & by 8 o’clock we neared the Bay with the Lions Head and Rump arising in strong outtrue? Before us. By 12 noon we cast Anchor in Table Bay and at 2pm (our arrival having been telegraphed before we entered the Bay) we were boarded by the Harbour Master who enquired into the state of health of Emigrants & crew and entered into the usual arrangements. Reported to the Colonial Secretary the arrival of the ship with General Statement as to the state of health etc of the Emigrants.\n\nConcerning the number of stops, there were none. A synopsis of the journey at the end of the journal, emphasis mine:\n\nReturn of Emigrants embarked & disembarked\n\nSouthampton – Port 11th December 1845 – Date of Arrival 11th December 1845 – Date of Embarkation 16th December 1845 – Date of Sailing\n\nPlymouth – Port 4th January 1846 – Date of Arrival 4th January 1846 – Date of Embarkation of Emigrants 9th January 1846 – Date of Sailing\n\nNo ports paid into until vessel at Table Bay\n\nTable Bay – Port 12th April 1846 – Date of Arrival 29th April 1846 – Date of Sailing\n\nAlgoa Bay – Port May 1846 – Date of Arrival\n\nNumber of Emigrants Embarked – 150 adults, 19 children over 7, 50 children under 7, 219 in total\n\nDeath on passage – 1 child under 7 and in total\n\nBirth on passengers deck – 2 children under 7\n\nTotal of souls on board – 150 adults, 19 children over 7, 52 children under 7, 220 in total\n\nNo. Landed at Table Bay – 127 adults, 15 children over 7, 46 children under 7 No. Landed at Algoa Bay – 23 adults, 4 children over 7, 5 children under 7 Total number landed – 150 adults, 19 children over 7, 51 children under 7, 220 in total\n\nDeath on Board Susannah DUDLEY aged 1 year and 7 months daughter of William Dudley. Died of billiary disarrangement [the rest is illegible]??? 10th March 1846\n\nBirths: Mrs Geo PURCHASE of a female child 12th March 1846 Mrs Robt. Chas REID of female child 25th April 1846.\n\nI hereby certify the above to be a true return of the Emigrants placed into my hands on board the Ship Recorder.\n\nSigned William WILLIAMSON Surgeon Superintendent Algoa Bay May 1846\n\nThe ship Recorder was large enough (630t) to carry over 200 passengers and enough provisions to complete the journey in roughly 90 days without any stops. It is difficult to tell from one example if this should be considered 'typical', but one journal entry from April 3rd gives us a hint as to what was considered 'normal' (emphasis mine):\n\nToday makes 16 weeks since we sailed from Southampton at which time we naturally expected to have spent 3 or 4 weeks in South Africa by this date.\n\nIt would appear they expected the journey to last about 12 to 13 weeks.\n\nAfter putting some data points from the journal into Google Earth, the course followed appears something like this:"
