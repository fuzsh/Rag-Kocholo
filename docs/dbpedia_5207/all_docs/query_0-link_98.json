Source: Intellicast\n\nHurricane Season 101\n\nThe official Atlantic Basin Hurricane Season runs from June 1st to November 30th.\n\nA tropical cyclone is a warm-core, low pressure system without any “front” attached. It develops over tropical or subtropical waters, and has an organized circulation. Depending upon location, tropical cyclones have different names around the world. The Tropical Cyclones we track in the Atlantic basin are called Tropical Depressions, Tropical Storms and Hurricanes!\n\nAtlantic Basin Tropical Cyclones are classified as follows:\n\nTropical Depression: Organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with defined surface circulation and max sustained winds of 38 mph or less.\n\nTropical Storm: Organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds of 39-73 mph.\n\nHurricane: Intense tropical weather system of strong thunderstorms with a well-defined surface circulation. A Hurricane has max sustained winds of 74 mph or higher!\n\nThe difference between Tropical Storm and Hurricane Watches, Warnings, Advisories and Outlooks\n\nWarnings:Listen closely to instructions from local officials on TV, radio, cell phones or other computers for instructions from local officials.Evacuate immediately if told to do so.\n\nStorm Surge Warning: There is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area. This is generally within 36 hours. If you are under a storm surge warning, check for evacuation orders from your local officials.\n\nHurricane Warning: Hurricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or greater) are expected somewhere within the specified area. NHC issues a hurricane warning 36 hours in advance of tropical storm-force winds to give you time to complete your preparations. All preparations should be complete. Evacuate immediately if so ordered.\n\nTropical Storm Warning: Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are expected within your area within 36 hours.\n\nExtreme Wind Warning: Extreme sustained winds of a major hurricane (115 mph or greater), usually associated with the eyewall, are expected to begin within an hour. Take immediate shelter in the interior portion of a well-built structure.\n\nPlease note that hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings for winds on land as well as storm surge watches and warnings can be issued for storms that the NWS believes will become tropical cyclones but have not yet attained all of the characteristics of a tropical cyclone (i.e., a closed low-level circulation, sustained thunderstorm activity, etc.). In these cases, the forecast conditions on land warrant alerting the public. These storms are referred to as “potential tropical cyclones” by the NWS.\n\nHurricane, tropical storm, and storm surge watches and warnings can also be issued for storms that have lost some or all of their tropical cyclone characteristics, but continue to produce dangerous conditions. These storms are called “post-tropical cyclones” by the NWS.\n\nWatches: Listen closely to instructions from local officials on TV, radio, cell phones or other computers for instructions from local officials. Evacuate if told to do so.\n\nStorm Surge Watch: Storm here is a possibility of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours. If you are under a storm surge watch, check for evacuation orders from your local officials.\n\nHurricane Watch: Huriricane conditions (sustained winds of 74 mph or greater) are possible within your area. Because it may not be safe to prepare for a hurricane once winds reach tropical storm force, The NHC issues hurricane watches 48 hours before it anticipates tropical storm-force winds.\n\nTropical Storm Watch: Tropical storm conditions (sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph) are possible within the specified area within 48 hours.\n\nAdvisories:\n\nTropical Cyclone Public Advisory:The Tropical Cyclone Public Advisory contains a list of all current coastal watches and warnings associated with an ongoing or potential tropical cyclone, a post-tropical cyclone, or a subtropical cyclone. It also provides the cyclone position, maximum sustained winds, current motion, and a description of the hazards associated with the storm.\n\nTropical Cyclone Track Forecast Cone:This graphic shows areas under tropical storm and hurricane watches and warnings, the current position of the center of the storm, and its predicted track. Forecast uncertainty is conveyed on the graphic by a “cone” (white and stippled areas) drawn such that the center of the storm will remain within the cone about 60 to 70 percent of the time. Remember, the effects of a tropical cyclone can span hundreds of miles. Areas well outside of the cone often experience hazards such as tornadoes or inland flooding from heavy rain.\n\nOutlooks:\n\nTropical Weather Outlook:The Tropical Weather Outlook is a discussion of significant areas of disturbed weather and their potential for development during the next 5 days. The Outlook includes a categorical forecast of the probability of tropical cyclone formation during the first 48 hours and during the entire 5-day forecast period. You can also find graphical versions of the 2-day and 5-day Outlook here\n\nBe sure to read up on tons of more information on Hurricane knowledge, preparedness, statistics and history under the menu on the left hand side of the page!\n\nTrackTheTropics Resource Links\n\nCONUS Hurricane Strikes\n\n1950-2017\n\nTotal Hurricane Strikes 1900-2010 Total MAJOR Hurricane Strikes 1900-2010 Western Gulf Hurricane Strikes Western Gulf MAJOR Hurricane Strikes Eastern Gulf Hurricane Strikes Eastern Gulf MAJOR Hurricane Strikes SE Coast Hurricane Strikes SE Coast MAJOR Hurricane Strikes NE Coast Hurricane Strikes NE Coast MAJOR Hurricane Strikes\n\n2024 Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook\n\nPage Navigation: Atlantic Tropical Outlook / Tropical Discussion / Active Tropical Systems\n\nScheduled Recon Flight Plans / Marine Weather Discussion / Tropical Monthly Summary\n\n2 Day Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook\n\n7 Day Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook\n\nAtlantic Tropical Weather Outlook\n\nThu, 15 Aug 2024 05:18:16 +0000: Atlantic Tropical Weather Outlook - Atlantic Tropical Weather Outlook\n\n000\n\nABNT20 KNHC 150518\n\nTWOAT\n\nTropical Weather Outlook\n\nNWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL\n\n200 AM EDT Thu Aug 15 2024\n\nFor the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:\n\nActive Systems:\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane\n\nErnesto, located a couple of hundred miles northeast of the Turks\n\nand Caicos Islands.\n\nTropical cyclone formation is not expected during the next 7 days.\n\n$$\n\nForecaster Kelly\n\nTropical Weather Discussion\n\nThu, 15 Aug 2024 04:37:36 +0000: NHC Atlantic Tropical Weather Discussion - NHC Tropical Weather Discussion (Atlantic)\n\n000\n\nAXNT20 KNHC 150437\n\nTWDAT\n\nTropical Weather Discussion\n\nNWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL\n\n0605 UTC Thu Aug 15 2024\n\nTropical Weather Discussion for North America, Central America\n\nGulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, northern sections of South\n\nAmerica, and Atlantic Ocean to the African coast from the\n\nEquator to 31N. The following information is based on satellite\n\nimagery, weather observations, radar and meteorological analysis.\n\nBased on 0000 UTC surface analysis and satellite imagery through\n\n0430 UTC.\n\n...SPECIAL FEATURES...\n\n...Hurricane Ernesto...\n\nHurricane Ernesto is centered near 23.0N 68.9W at 15/0300 UTC or\n\n150 nm NE of Grand Turk Island, moving NNW at 14 kt. Estimated\n\nminimum central pressure is 982 mb. Maximum sustained wind speed\n\nis 70 kt with gusts to 85 kt. Scattered to numerous moderate to\n\nstrong convection prevails from 18N to 26N between 63W and 71W.\n\nSeas of 12 ft or greater are within 200 nm E semicircle, 120 nm\n\nSW quadrant, and 165 nm NW quadrant, with seas to 32 ft. Swells\n\ngenerated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the northern\n\nLeeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican\n\nRepublic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern\n\nBahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda and the rest of\n\nthe Bahamas on Thursday. Swells are expected to reach the east\n\ncoast of the United States Thursday night and continue into the\n\nweekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf\n\nand rip current conditions. Please consult products from your\n\nlocal weather office for more details.\n\nPlease read the latest HIGH SEAS FORECAST issued by the National\n\nHurricane Center at website -\n\nhttps://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/MIAHSFAT2.shtml and the latest\n\nErnesto NHC Forecast/Advisory and Public Advisory at\n\nwww.hurricanes.gov for more details.\n\n...Agadir Gale Warning...\n\nThe pressure gradient between a 1027 mb Azores high and low\n\npressure over the west Saharan Desert will support gale-force\n\nwinds in the METEO-FRANCE forecast area of Agadir from now until\n\n15/0300 UTC. For more information please visit:\n\nhttps://wwmiws.wmo.int/index.php/metareas/display/2.\n\n...TROPICAL WAVES...\n\nThe axis of an eastern Atlantic tropical wave is along 35W from\n\n04N to 18N, moving west at 5 to 10 kt. No significant convection\n\naccompanies this wave.\n\nA central Atlantic tropical wave is along 50W from 06N to 16N,\n\nmoving west at around 15 kt. No significant convection\n\naccompanies this wave.\n\n...MONSOON TROUGH/ITCZ...\n\nThe monsoon trough enters the Atlantic off the coast of Africa\n\nnear 19N16W and extends southwestward to 11N49W. Scattered\n\nmoderate convention is noted from 04N to 14N and E of 30W.\n\n...GULF OF MEXICO...\n\nScattered moderate convection is noted along a surface trough from\n\nthe Yucatan Peninsula into the Bay of Campeche south of 21N.\n\nTo the NE, a stationary front extends across Northern Florida from\n\n31N87W to 29N83W. Elsewhere, a weak pressure gradient is\n\nsupporting light to gentle winds over much of the basin with seas\n\n2 to 4 ft in the SW Gulf and seas 1 to 3 ft elsewhere.\n\nFor the forecast, the weak surface ridge will maintain gentle to\n\nmoderate winds and slight to moderate seas across most of the\n\nbasin into early next week. Otherwise, moderate to locally fresh\n\nwinds, and scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected along\n\nthe Yucatan Peninsula each evening through the period.\n\n...CARIBBEAN SEA...\n\nPlease see the Special Features section above for more\n\ninformation on Hurricane Ernesto.\n\nAssociated strong convection is currently affecting portions of\n\nHispaniola and the Mona Passage. Latest scatterometer data depicts\n\nfresh to strong SE winds over the E Caribbean east of 71W, while\n\nlight to gentle ne winds prevail elsewhere across the basin.\n\nModerate seas prevail E of 77W, and slight seas prevail W of 77W.\n\nFor the forecast, Hurricane Ernesto is forecast to continue to\n\nstrengthen as it moves in a northerly motion at around 11 kt over\n\nthe western Atlantic through the end of the week, passing very\n\nnear Bermuda on Sat morning. In its wake, high pressure will\n\ngradually build westward along 21N late Fri into early next week,\n\nbringing a return to a more typical trade wind flow across the\n\nbasin. A tropical wave near 50W is accompanied by scattered\n\nthunderstorms and gusty winds. The wave will move through the\n\nTropical N Atlantic waters and into the eastern Caribbean through\n\nFri while weakening.\n\n...ATLANTIC OCEAN...\n\nPlease see Special Features section above for more information\n\nabout Hurricane Ernesto.\n\nA broad wind surge has accompanied Ernesto for the past few days,\n\nwith fresh to strong winds north of the storm extending to 27N.\n\nThis has produced a large wave field moving in synch with Ernesto,\n\nwith seas of 8 to 12 ft, and higher near Ernesto, extending from\n\n19N to 26N between 63W and 72W.\n\nAway from Ernesto, a weak frontal boundary extends from near\n\nBermuda to north-central Florida. High pressure prevails across\n\nthe tropical and subtropical waters N of 23N, anchored by a 1021\n\nmb high centered near 27N54W. Light to gentle winds prevail across\n\nthe central and E Atlantic between 39W-60W. Moderate to fresh E\n\nto NE winds and slight seas prevail over much of the waters\n\nelsewhere E of 39W, except for strong to near gale NE winds and\n\nrough seas near the Canary Islands and near the coast of Morocco.\n\nS of 20N, Light to gentle winds and slight seas.\n\nFor the forecast west of 55W, Hurricane Ernesto is expected to\n\nturn toward the north-northwest then north tonight through Thu\n\nmorning as it continues to strengthen, reaching near 24.7N 69.1W\n\nThu morning, near 26.8N 68.6W Thu evening, near 28.6N 67.4W Fri\n\nmorning, then pass very near Bermuda Sat morning. The weak\n\nfrontal boundary over the W Atlantic will drift southward across\n\nthe northwestern part of the area, and stall to the NW of Ernesto\n\nby Fri, producing moderate to fresh NE winds behind it. Large\n\nswell from Ernesto will spread W of 75W late Thu night through Sat\n\nmorning.\n\n$$\n\nERA\n\nActive Tropical Systems\n\nThu, 15 Aug 2024 05:48:19 +0000: Hurricane Ernesto Public Advisory Number 14A - NHC Atlantic\n\nIssued at 200 AM AST Thu Aug 15 2024\n\n000 WTNT35 KNHC 150548 TCPAT5 BULLETIN Hurricane Ernesto Intermediate Advisory Number 14A NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL AL052024 200 AM AST Thu Aug 15 2024 ...SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT ERNESTO IS GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING...

SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT: A Hurricane Watch is in effect for... * Bermuda A Hurricane Watch means that hurricane conditions are possible within the watch area. A watch is typically issued 48 hours before the anticipated first occurrence of tropical-storm-force winds, conditions that make outside preparations difficult or dangerous. For storm information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your national meteorological service. DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- At 200 AM AST (0600 UTC), the center of Hurricane Ernesto was located near latitude 23.3 North, longitude 69.1 West. Ernesto is moving toward the north-northwest near 16 mph (26 km/h). A turn toward the north is expected later today, followed by a slower northward to northeastward motion on Friday and Saturday. On the forecast track, the center of Ernesto is expected to pass near Bermuda on Saturday. Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 85 mph (140 km/h) with higher gusts. Strengthening is forecast during the next couple of days, and Ernesto could become a major hurricane by Friday. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles (280 km). NOAA buoy 41046, located about 40 miles north of Ernesto, recently reported a wind gust to 57 mph (91 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997.9 mb (29.47 inches). The estimated minimum central pressure is 979 mb (28.91 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- Key messages for Ernesto can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT5 and WMO header WTNT45 KNHC and on the web at hurricanes.gov/text/MIATCDAT5.shtml. WIND: Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda Saturday, with tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon. RAINFALL: Ernesto is expected to produce total rain accumulations of 3 to 6 inches on Bermuda with isolated maximum amounts of 9 inches. This rainfall may result in considerable life-threatening flash flooding. SURF: Swells generated by Ernesto are affecting portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos Islands, and the southeastern Bahamas. These swells will spread toward Bermuda and the rest of the Bahamas later today. Swells are expected to reach the east coast of the United States tonight and continue into the weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather office.

A series of earlier SSMI/S 91 GHz passive microwave images showed the formation of a mid-level eye, and there have been recent hints of an eye trying to emerge in proxy-visible satellite images. Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters showed the central pressure has fallen to 982 mb, and the aircraft measured peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 76 kt in the northeast quadrant. Based on these data, the initial intensity is set at 70 kt. The wind field remains quite broad and asymmetric, with the strongest aircraft winds well to the northeast of the center. The next aircraft reconnaissance mission into Ernesto is scheduled for tomorrow morning. Ernesto is now moving north-northwestward at 330/14 kt. The hurricane will continue on a north-northwestward to northward motion during the next day or so while moving through a break in the subtropical ridge over the western Atlantic. The global models agree the upper trough that weakened the ridge will not capture Ernesto. As a result, Ernesto will move slower to the north-northeast and north while the hurricane approaches and moves near Bermuda Friday night and Saturday. Later this weekend, a second trough will move across the eastern U.S., and Ernesto should accelerate northeastward early next week within the deep-layer southwesterly flow ahead of this feature. The NHC track forecast is essentially an update of the previous one, as the track guidance remains in good overall agreement. It is still too soon to know exactly how close Ernesto's center will move to Bermuda this weekend, but warnings will likely be required for the island on Thursday. While there is still evidence of some drier air nearby Ernesto, the very warm ocean waters and weak to moderate shear should promote some strengthening during the next couple of days. This is supported by the bulk of the intensity guidance, and the regional hurricane models still favor Ernesto reaching major hurricane intensity on Friday. The latest NHC prediction remains on the high end of the guidance envelope, closest to the HFIP corrected consensus. Some gradual weakening is forecast thereafter as Ernesto moves into a drier, more sheared environment. There are some indications that positive interaction with the second upper trough could cause Ernesto's intensity to level off or even slightly increase during the 60-96 h time period while still over warm waters. By 120 h, the model fields suggest Ernesto will be on the verge of losing tropical characteristics while accelerating over cooler waters. Key Messages: 1. Hurricane conditions are possible on Bermuda on Saturday, with tropical storm conditions possible by Friday afternoon. Rainfall associated with Ernesto may begin to affect Bermuda late Thursday and result in flash flooding across Bermuda later this week and this weekend. 2. Even though Ernesto is forecast to remain well offshore the U.S. East Coast, swells generated by the storm are expected to reach the area late this week and into the weekend. Beach goers should be aware of a significant risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents, and stay out of the water if advised by lifeguards. Surf and rip currents are also possible on the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas during the next few days.

This will support moderate to fresh E to SE winds over the\n\nbasin through Tue. Winds will increase to fresh to strong late\n\nTue through Fri as low pressure deepens across the Southern\n\nPlains.\n\n...CARIBBEAN SEA AND TROPICAL N ATLANTIC FROM 07N TO 19N BETWEEN\n\n55W AND 64W...\n\nA ridge NE of the Caribbean Sea will shift eastward and weaken,\n\ndiminishing winds and seas modestly through Wed. Trade winds\n\nwill increase basin wide Wed night through Fri night as high\n\npressure builds across the western Atlantic.\n\n...SW N ATLANTIC INCLUDING THE BAHAMAS...\n\nA weakening frontal boundary from 25N65W to the central Bahamas\n\nwill drift SE and dissipate through late Tue. Its remnants will\n\ndrift N along 23N-24N. The pressure gradient between high\n\npressure off of Hatteras and the frontal boundary will support\n\nan area of fresh to strong easterly winds N of 23N and W of 68W\n\nwith seas to 11 ft E of the Bahamas late Tue through Fri.\n\n$$\n\n.WARNINGS...Any changes impacting coastal NWS offices will be\n\ncoordinated through AWIPS II Collaboration Chat, or by\n\ntelephone:\n\n.GULF OF MEXICO...\n\nNone.\n\n.CARIBBEAN SEA AND TROPICAL N ATLANTIC FROM 07N TO 19N BETWEEN\n\n55W AND 64W...\n\nNone.\n\n.SW N ATLANTIC INCLUDING THE BAHAMAS...\n\nNone.\n\n$$\n\n*For detailed zone descriptions, please visit:\n\nhttp://www.nhc.noaa.gov/abouttafbprod.shtml#OWF\n\nNote: gridded marine forecasts are available in the National\n\nDigital Forecast Database (NDFD) at:\n\nhttp://www.nhc.noaa.gov/marine/grids.php\n\nFor additional information, please visit:\n\nhttp://www.nhc.noaa.gov/marine\n\n$$\n\n.Forecaster GR.

Beryl became the earliest category 5 hurricane on\n\nrecord in the basin, and it made three landfalls--first on\n\nCarriacou Island in Grenada (Category 4), second on the Yucatan\n\nPeninsula of Mexico (Category 2), and third on the middle Texas\n\ncoastline (Category 1). Tropical Storm Chris also made landfall\n\nalong the Gulf coast of mainland Mexico. Despite the early-month\n\nactivity, there were no new named storms that formed over the basin\n\nduring the remainder of July.\n\nFor the season to date, the number of named storms (3) is near\n\naverage, although it is not common to have had a major hurricane\n\nat this point in the season. Based on a 30-year (1991-2020)\n\nclimatology, 2 or 3 named storms form by the end of July, with a\n\nhurricane occuring every 1 to 2 years, and a major hurricane\n\noccurring every 7 years. In terms of Accumulated Cyclone Energy\n\n(ACE), which measures the strength and duration of tropical storms\n\nand hurricanes, activity in the basin so far in 2024 is nearly 4\n\ntimes higher than the long-term (1991-2020) mean, mainly due to the\n\ncontribution from Major Hurricane Beryl.\n\nReports on individual cyclones, when completed, are available at the\n\nNational Hurricane Center website at\n\nwww.hurricanes.gov/data/tcr/index.php?season=2024&basin=atl\n\nSummary Table\n\nName Dates Max Wind (mph)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTS Alberto 17-20 Jun 50\n\nMH Beryl 28 Jun-9 Jul 165\n\nTS Chris 30 Jun-1 Jul 40\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Denotes a storm for which the post-storm analysis is complete.\n\n$$\n\nHurricane Specialist Unit"
