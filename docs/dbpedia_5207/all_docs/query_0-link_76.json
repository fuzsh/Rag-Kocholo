        "text": "There is always geonames though I have no idea how comprehensive their South Africa data is.\n\nAnother option might be the South African Statistics agency\n\nMapIT have South African Datasets including Towns/Cities (POI) - It is usually derived from TeleAtlas (Owned by TomTom) so likely to be costly.\n\nhttp://www.map-it.co.za/about/index.html\n\nFrom the Press Release: June 2011\n\n\"Given these trends, MapIT, Southern Africaâ€™s leading enabler of technological mapping solutions, is concentrating on supplying accurate, current, enriched data by adding Points of Interest (POI) to the data.\"\n\nI found OpenStreetMap to have GREAT amount of sets of data for ZA. Although some parts are more populated than others, compared to Google.\n\nYou can Export the data to XML file from OSM, and then extract the POI's - this is a lot of work, but its free.\n\nStatistics SA and various government departments work with SHP files. (hard to get your hands on) - try and find a reliable contact inside the .gov\n\nGood luck\n\nTry the office of the Surveyor General as well. They have a wealth of information, much of which they provide at no charge:\n\nhttp://www.ngi.gov.za/itisportalinternet/\n\nThere is also free spatial data available from DIVA-GIS:\n\nhttp://www.diva-gis.org/Data\n\nI've found the best and most reliable source for South African GIS data is from Planet GIS. Their complete data sets for South Africa can be found here, but the two most useful ones are:\n\nAdministrative boundaries: this covers the provincial, district, local municipality and ward boundaries.\n\nPlaces of South Africa: this covers fine detail down to the suburb level.\n\nThe downloads are comprised of SQLite databases. To make use of this data, you have 2 options:\n\nUse the PlanetGIS Explorer to browse the data\n\nView the SQLite databases directly\n\nIf you're on Linux, the easiest way to browse the SQLite databases is by using a tool such as SQLite Database Browser, which should already be available in your package management repository.\n\nSide Note: Official GIS data for South Africa should be sourced from the Municipal Demarcation Board, but actually finding any GIS data via their website is nigh impossible. Thankfully the data provided by PlanetGIS does originate from the Municipal Demarcation Board."
