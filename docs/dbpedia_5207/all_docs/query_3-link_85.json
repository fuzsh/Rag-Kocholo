        "text": "Iâve been asked to deliver this parcel to my cousin but he lives on an island and doesnât have an address to send things to, like you or me. Itâs not a problem though, because I know a good way to find out exactly where he lives.\n\nFirst, Iâm going to find out which half of the Earth heâs on.\n\nRunning around the middle of the planet is an imaginary line called the Equator. Well Iâm on the half thatâs above the Equator, which is called the Northern Hemisphere and he lives on the half thatâs below the Equator, which is the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nBut I also need to find out how far around the Earth he is, and how far down. To do that, Iâll use whatâs called latitude and longitude.Lines of latitude run around the Earth like imaginary hoops and have numbers to show how many degrees north or south they are from the Equator.\n\nLines of longitude run from the top of the Earth to the bottom, and divide up the Earth a bit like the segments of an orange.\n\nThe line going through London, called Greenwich Meridian, is the starting point at zero degrees.\n\nThe other lines show how many degrees east or west of this you are. If I want to see where a place is in the world, I just need to look at where the lines cross, and read the numbers.\n\nAh, there he is! Latitude is 32 degrees south, and longitude is 115 degrees east.\n\nSee if you can find out what your latitude and longitude are by using a globe. Go on! Itâs easy!"
