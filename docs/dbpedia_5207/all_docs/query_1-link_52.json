In East London, the chance of a wet day over the course of November is gradually increasing, starting the month at 33% and ending it at 35%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 37% on November 25, and its lowest chance is 6% on June 30.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during November in East London is essentially constant, remaining about 4.4 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 9.8 inches or falling below 0.9 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 4.5 inches on November 12.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of November in East London, the length of the day is increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 43 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 1 minute, 28 seconds, and weekly increase of 10 minutes, 19 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is November 1, with 13 hours, 27 minutes of daylight and the longest day is November 30, with 14 hours, 9 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in East London is 5:08 AM on November 1 and the earliest sunrise is 16 minutes earlier at 4:52 AM on November 30.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 6:35 PM on November 1 and the latest sunset is 26 minutes later at 7:01 PM on November 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in East London during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on December 21, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:56 AM and sets 14 hours, 20 minutes later, at 7:16 PM, while on June 20, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:10 AM and sets 9 hours, 58 minutes later, at 5:09 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in November in East London\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in November in East LondonNov11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMOctDecOct 28:50 PMOct 28:50 PMOct 171:27 PMOct 171:27 PMNov 12:48 PMNov 12:48 PMNov 1511:29 PMNov 1511:29 PMDec 18:22 AMDec 18:22 AMDec 1511:02 AMDec 1511:02 AMDec 3112:28 AMDec 3112:28 AM5:31 AM5:31 AM6:01 PM6:01 PM6:35 PM6:35 PM5:45 AM5:45 AM4:49 AM4:49 AM6:44 PM6:44 PM6:36 PM6:36 PM4:56 AM4:56 AM4:32 AM4:32 AM7:37 PM7:37 PM6:39 PM6:39 PM4:25 AM4:25 AM5:03 AM5:03 AM8:13 PM8:13 PM\n\nNov 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 0%4:49 AMESE6:44 PMWSW-11:43 AMN251,062 mi 2 1%5:19 AMESE7:43 PMWSW-12:28 PMN249,848 mi 3 4%5:53 AMESE8:44 PMWSW-1:16 PMN248,301 mi 4 8%6:34 AMESE9:44 PMSW-2:07 PMN246,435 mi 5 15%7:22 AMSE10:41 PMSW-3:01 PMN244,252 mi 6 23%8:18 AMSE11:33 PMWSW-3:57 PMN241,756 mi 7 33%9:20 AMESE--4:52 PMN238,976 mi 8 44%-12:19 AMWSW10:26 AMESE5:46 PMN235,980 mi 9 50%-12:59 AMWSW11:33 AMESE6:37 PMN232,893 mi 10 66%-1:34 AMWSW12:41 PMESE7:26 PMN229,899 mi 11 77%-2:05 AMW1:49 PME8:14 PMN227,236 mi 12 87%-2:35 AMW2:58 PME9:03 PMN225,175 mi 13 94%-3:06 AMW4:08 PME9:54 PMN223,977 mi 14 98%-3:38 AMWNW5:21 PMENE10:48 PMN223,844 mi 15 100%-4:14 AMWNW6:36 PMENE11:46 PMN224,871 mi 16 100%-4:56 AMWNW7:52 PMENE-- 17 98%-5:46 AMWNW9:03 PMNE12:48 AMN227,013 mi 18 94%-6:43 AMNW10:06 PMNE1:53 AMN230,077 mi 19 87%-7:47 AMNW11:00 PMENE2:57 AMN233,756 mi 20 79%-8:53 AMWNW11:43 PMENE3:57 AMN237,691 mi 21 69%-9:58 AMWNW-4:51 AMN241,533 mi 22 59%12:19 AMENE11:00 AMWNW-5:39 AMN244,989 mi 23 50%12:48 AMENE11:58 AMWNW-6:23 AMN247,845 mi 24 39%1:15 AME12:54 PMW-7:04 AMN249,966 mi 25 30%1:39 AME1:49 PMW-7:43 AMN251,293 mi 26 21%2:02 AME2:43 PMW-8:21 AMN251,833 mi 27 14%2:26 AME3:38 PMWSW-9:00 AMN251,647 mi 28 8%2:51 AMESE4:35 PMWSW-9:40 AMN250,839 mi 29 3%3:20 AMESE5:34 PMWSW-10:24 AMN249,533 mi 30 1%3:53 AMESE6:35 PMWSW-11:11 AMN247,860 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in East London is rapidly increasing during November, rising from 10% to 25% over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on February 15, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 61% of the time, while on June 17, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in November in East London\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in East London is gradually decreasing during November, decreasing from 13.9 miles per hour to 13.2 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on October 19, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 14.2 miles per hour, while on May 3, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in East London throughout November is predominantly from the east, with a peak proportion of 42% on November 30.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nEast London is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in East London is gradually increasing during November, rising by 2Â°F, from 70Â°F to 72Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in East London are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in November in East London\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in November in East LondonNov1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%OctDec100%Nov 16100%Nov 16coolcomfortablewarmcold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in East London are rapidly increasing during November, increasing by 501Â°F, from 1,563Â°F to 2,065Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in East London is gradually increasing during November, rising by 0.8 kWh, from 6.4 kWh to 7.2 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in November in East London\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of East London are -33.015 deg latitude, 27.912 deg longitude, and 157 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of East London contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 361 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 124 feet. Within 10 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,073 feet). Within 50 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (5,456 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of East London is covered by water (45%), artificial surfaces (39%), and shrubs (14%), within 10 miles by water (56%) and shrubs (20%), and within 50 miles by water (56%) and grassland (18%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in East London, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere is only a single weather station, East London Airport, in our network suitable to be used as a proxy for the historical temperature and dew point records of East London.\n\nAt a distance of 8 kilometers from East London, closer than our threshold of 150 kilometers, this station is deemed sufficiently nearby to be relied upon as our primary source for temperature and dew point records.\n\nThe station records are corrected for the elevation difference between the station and East London according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nPlease note that the station records themselves may additionally have been back-filled using other nearby stations or the MERRA-2 reanalysis.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
