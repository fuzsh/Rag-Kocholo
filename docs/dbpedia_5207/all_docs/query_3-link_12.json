Join now\n\nStand on the historic Prime Meridian of the World at the Royal Observatory Greenwich.\n\nSince 1884, all distances east and west have been measured from the Prime Meridian line in Greenwich.\n\nAstronomers at the Royal Observatory took thousands of measurements to define the Prime Meridian and establish zero degrees longitude. In an age before smartphones and satellites, their work transformed how we explored our world.\n\nCome to Greenwich and follow in their footsteps. Visit the Royal Observatory, walk along the line where east meets west, and discover the history of time and space.\n\nWhat's so special about the Prime Meridian line?\n\nSince the late 19th century, the Prime Meridian at Greenwich has divided the eastern and western hemispheres of the Earth - just as the equator divides the northern and southern hemispheres. When you stand across the line, you have one foot in the east and one in the west!\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian also helped to establish the world time zone system we still use today.\n\nWhat is a meridian?\n\nA meridian is an imaginary line running north to south that is used as a reference line for astronomical observations. Meridian lines also help to plot locations here on Earth by offering a way to determine longitude.\n\nWhy is the Prime Meridian in Greenwich?\n\nUntil the 1880s, countries used their own meridian lines for mapmaking and navigation. This meant there was no globally agreed way of measuring distances and plotting locations east and west.\n\nIn 1884, different nations gathered in Washington D.C. to choose one single meridian as a common reference. After weeks of discussion, delegates voted to make the Greenwich Meridian the world's Prime Meridian.\n\nGreenwich was chosen because its measurements were already used by most of the world's seafarers and mapmakers. Thanks to the work of generations of astronomers, the Royal Observatory became the home for global time and navigation.\n\nHow many countries does the Prime Meridian pass through?\n\nFrom pole to pole, the Prime Meridian covers a distance of 20,000 km.\n\nIn the northern hemisphere, the Prime Meridian passes through the UK, France and Spain in Europe, and Algeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, Togo and Ghana in Africa. The only land crossed by the Meridian in the southern hemisphere is Antarctica.\n\nIn Greenwich the Prime Meridian is marked by a metal line fixed into the Royal Observatory courtyard, and at night by a laser beam. Depending on the weather, the beam can be seen from more than 20 km away.\n\nWhat else can I do at the Royal Observatory?\n\nFrom John Harrison's revolutionary timekeepers to the Great Equatorial Telescope, the Royal Observatory is home to some of the UK's most prized scientific instruments. See them all on display as you walk round the historic buildings.\n\nThe Meridian Courtyard also offers some of the best views in London, high above the trees of Greenwich Park.\n\nFinally, did you know that astronomers still work at the Royal Observatory today? Join them on an inspiring journey into space at Londonâ€™s only planetarium.\n\nVisiting the Prime Meridian in Greenwich\n\nDo I need tickets to visit the Prime Meridian?\n\nThe Prime Meridian is included as part of your visit to the Royal Observatory Greenwich. We recommend booking tickets online in advance to guarantee entry and receive updates before your visit.\n\nBook now\n\nLearn more about planning a visit\n\nGetting to the Royal Observatory\n\nThe Observatory is located on a hill in the heart of Greenwich Park, close to Greenwich's historic town centre.\n\nGreenwich is a quick, easy journey from central London via train, DLR and bus. Alternatively there is a secure car park nearby at the National Maritime Museum which is open to visitors during weekends, bank holidays and school holidays. Spaces can be reserved in advance when booking tickets.\n\nCheck our travel pages for more information about getting to the Royal Observatory as well as other Royal Museums Greenwich sites.\n\nFind us on Google Maps\n\nWhere is the Prime Meridian in Greenwich?\n\nThe Prime Meridian stretches all round the world! But if you want to stand on the line marked out inside the Royal Observatory itself, head towards the Meridian Courtyard.\n\nThis is the historic heart of the Observatory, surrounded by the Meridian Observatory â€“ home to the telescopes that helped define zero degrees longitude â€“ and Flamsteed House, the oldest part of the Observatory.\n\nFollow the audio guide\n\nLearn more about the history of the Royal Observatory and its status as the home of Greenwich Mean Time with the dedicated audio guide, available to all visitors.\n\nListen to the tour online using your phone or via the Smartify museum app.\n\nDownload Smartify for Apple\n\nDownload for Android\n\nMake the most of your Royal Observatory visit\n\nFind more things to do at the Royal Observatory here.\n\nIf you want to see more of Greenwich's historic attractions, book a Greenwich Day pass.
