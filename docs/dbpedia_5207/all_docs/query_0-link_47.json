        "text": "Mozambique covers an area of over 800,000 sq.km, three times the size of Great Britain. .Situated to the south east of the African continent, it shares borders with six others commonwealth countries. Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia to the north; Zimbabwe to the west; and South Africa and Swaziland to the south.\n\nThe 2,750 Km long coastline boasts superb beaches fringed by lagoons, coral reefs and strings of small islands.\n\nA vast, low , grassland plateau, which rises from the coast towards the mountains in the north and west, covers nearly half the country’s land area. The population is concentrated along the coast and the fertile river valleys. The Zambezi is the largest of the country’s 25 rivers.\n\nMozambique, rich in mineral resources such as gold, emeralds ,copper ,iron ore and bauxite, is currently engaged in oil exploration.\n\nClimate\n\nTropical to sub-tropical with coastal temperatures high for much of the year while the interior is warm to mild, even in the cooler dry season from April to September.\n\nIn the south the hot ,humid rainy seasons from December to March, farther north this period lengthens by a few weeks. The coast of northern Mozambique is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones. It is usually sunny throughout the year.\n\nThe climate of Mozambique, influenced by the monsoons from the Indian Ocean and the hot current of the Mozambique Canal, is generally tropical and humid. The dry season, in the Centre/North lasts for about four to six months, whereas in the South, the dry tropical climate is between six and nine months. The rainy season is between October and April.\n\nIn the mountainous areas, the climate is typical of tropical conditions to be found at high altitudes. Average temperatures are around 20º in the South and 26 º in the North. Highest temperatures are normally registered during the rainy season.\n\nThis Mission is concurrently accredited to Ireland and also covers London-based multilateral organizations. The website is intended to be an indispensable tool for the High Commission in the quest to provide free information and knowledge about Mozambique and its people and Government, including various services offered to Mozambican and foreign nationals, as well as institutions in the United Kingdom and beyond."
