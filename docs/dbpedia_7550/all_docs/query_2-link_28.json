        "text": "Languages in Nicaragua\n\nNicaragua is home to seven languages. Although this Central American country was a colony of Spain for over 300 years, 6 other languages have asserted themselves and let them be counted as part of the overall Nicaraguan culture.\n\nSpanish, of course, would be the obvious tongue of most Nicaraguans as 300 years would be enough time for natives to assimilate the said language on a national scale.\n\nA lot of Nicaraguans can also speak English because a considerable part of Nicaragua was once a British Protectorate for also over 300 years.\n\nThere is also what people call, Nicaragua Creole English. Although this language has its basic structure borrowed from the English language, it is very much different from American or British English as this is already a hybrid of English with from whatever ethnic Nicaraguan language it was derived from.\n\nGarifuna, a language spoken in the Caribbean also found its way to the country. Garifuna can be readily heard on the parts of Nicaragua near the Caribbean. Amazingly, it is unique as most Garifuna language has specific terms to be used by men and women.\n\nAnother language with ethnic origins is the Rama language. It is said that this language is on the brink of its death as most of those who can talk Rama can also speak the Nicaragua Creole English and more or less becoming the less preferred language by those who can speak this old language.\n\nAnother language also in danger of becoming extinct is the Miskito (or Mosquito, Marquito or Misquito). Right now, about 200,000 people are known to still use the language.\n\nThree other languages which are the Matagalpa, Monimbo and Subtiaba were used to be spoken in parts of Nicaragua but now have been officially classified as extinct or dead language."
