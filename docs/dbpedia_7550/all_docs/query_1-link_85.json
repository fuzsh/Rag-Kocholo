        "text": "Geography\n\nNicaragua is a country in Central America, linking the Pacific Ocean with the Caribbean Sea. The land has a total area of 130,370 km² (50,336 mi²) and a total coastline of 910 km (565.4 mi). This land area is approximately 63% of the area of Minnesota. Nicaragua is thus the 17th biggest country in the Americas and in terms of area ranked 98th worldwide. More than half of all residents (60%) live within cities. Every seventh resident lives in Managua alone.\n\nNicaragua is comparatively low at an average elevation of 298 meters above sea level. The highest mountain peak (Pico Mogotón) is at 2,107 meters. The country has 32 islands in the open sea. There are direct national borders with the two neighboring countries Costa Rica and Honduras. The distance between New York City and the Capital Managua is about 3,400 km (2,113 mi)."
