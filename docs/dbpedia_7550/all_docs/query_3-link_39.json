        "text": "This guide provides access to an array of resources on language and identity in Puerto Rico, including digitized primary source materials in a wide variety of formats, books, periodicals, and online databases.\n\nHistorically Puerto Rico endured a long and complicated path as a colony of Spain and later, a territory of the United States. This complexity surfaces in its unique language, which any dictionary defines “as a structured system of communication.” Puerto Rican language is unique to the island’s history. In Puerto Rico, communication is not simply Spanish or English, despite qualities that evolve from these two languages. The islands’ first recorded inhabitants, the Taíno Indians, were the first to establish a system of communication. As Spanish settlers occupied the island and introduced new customs, ideologies, and language, the island underwent a drastic change. Despite concerted efforts to eradicate the native Taíno language during 400 years of Spanish rule, the Taíno language is still tangible in Puerto Rican Spanish; and it blends with other cultural systems of communications.\n\nThe African customs, ideologies and languages enslaved Africans brought over as a result of being transported as a workforce for the island, made an indelible mark on the already fused language of this Caribbean island. This blending of many African languages, prospective blending among indigenous languages, and fusion in European languages had already permanently influenced the vernacular spoken in Puerto Rico, when the Spanish-American War (1898) further complicated Puerto Rico’s history. The Spanish-American War (1898) brought a second wave of colonization to Puerto Rico. During this second wave, the United States took control of the island, which remains a territory of the nation until present day. Consequently, the political and sociolinguistic panorama of the island experienced another radical change through the 20th century. Initially, the U.S. established English as the official language throughout the island, making it the language of instruction. After heavy resistance from the Puerto Rican people, officials declared Spanish the language of instruction, with English as a required subject. In the present day, Spanish and English are both official languages in Puerto Rico. And yet, Puerto Rican language is unique as a result of successive waves of language changes and cultural influences that ensure a hybrid identity."
