We cannot issue more than 7% of visas to natives of any one independent country in a fiscal year, and we cannot issue more than 2% of visas to any one dependency of any independent country. The per-country limit does not indicate, however, that a country is entitled to the maximum number of visas each year, just that it cannot receive more than that number.
