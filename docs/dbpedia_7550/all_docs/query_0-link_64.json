        "text": "In the heart of Central America, Nicaragua truly deserves the descriptive nickname of “The Land of Lakes and Volcanoes.” Visitors to Nicaragua are able to enjoy the natural beauty of dozens of volcanoes, rivers, and lakes, as well as two oceans. The country has three regions which vary greatly in weather, geography, and population. These three areas are the Pacific Region, Central Region, and the Caribbean Region consisting of two sub-regions: the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCN), and the South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region (RACCS).Situated at the very center of the Americas, Nicaragua is an ideal place to visit for anyone looking for something uniquely different and adventurous.\n\nNicaragua, which means, “here united with the water,” is a sovereign state whose people love freedom and independence.\n\nThe western region of the country was colonized by Spain, where the east was once a British region with a culture similar to that of the Caribbean nations. Examples through history include the fight led by the “general of the people” Augusto C. Sandino against the intervention of the United States in 1927, and the Sandinista People’s Revolution against the Somoza dictatorship, which led the way to democracy and solidarity in Nicaragua. Today the country is a democracy, with elections and a government dedicated to social justice and peace.\n\nThe merging of different cultures within Nicaragua has caused the dawn of a creative, lively and blissful culture. Nicaraguans are appreciated for their natural warmth, hospitality and wisdom. The country is known as the land of poets, and Nicaraguan poet Rubén Darío is the father of Spanish-American literary movement, Modernism. The rhythmic marimbas and folkloric dances give vibrancy to our fiestas across the country and the beautiful work of our skilled artists spreads an understanding of our history and nature.\n\nCasa Xalteva\n\nCasa Xalteva is a local Spanish school and a non-profit organization founded in 1995 in Granada, Nicaragua. As a Spanish school, Casa Xalteva offers classes with local teachers and Spanish immersion to every student from around the world, as well as services that include accommodation with local families, excursions, cultural activities and volunteer opportunities with our children’s program and teenagers. Currently, Casa Xalteva serves 15 chavalos , all of whom receive learning materials, help with homework, vocational training, arts/ crafts and recreational activities and more. The most important things for us at Casa Xalteva is that everyone feels like family and that we cultivate the values ​​of love, respect, and friendship."
