        "text": "Depending on how you count, there are 22 Spanish speaking countries in the world. The five most populous countries where Spanish is the official language are Mexico, Colombia, Spain, Argentina, and Peru.\n\nThe 22 Spanish Speaking Countries of the World\n\n= CIA World Factbook, = National Geographic, = NationMaster, = Wikipedia, = Lonely Planet, = Wolfram Alpha, = If It Were My Home\n\nThe United States?\n\nShould the United States be considered a Spanish speaking country? While English is the most widely spoken, the U.S. has no official language. The number of Spanish speakers in the U.S. currently makes it the second largest Spanish speaking country in the world (after Mexico) and it is projected to become the largest by 2050. Spanish is widely spoken along the border states of the southern U.S. and in big cities such as Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, & New York. The state of California has the highest percentage of Spanish speakers (27%) and its constitution specifies that all official documents be printed in both Spanish and English.\n\nOther Countries\n\nIn addition to the 22 countries listed above you will also find Spanish widely spoken and understood in Andorra, a tiny country nestled between Spain and France.\n\nMany residents of the British territory of Gibraltar located at the southern tip of Spain speak Spanish as well as English because of its proximity to Spain.\n\nSpanish is also spoken in the sparsely populated Western Sahara, a disputed territory and former Spanish colony in North Africa.\n\nAlthough English is the official language of Belize (formerly British Honduras), its location in Central America makes Spanish an important language for its citizens.\n\nPortuguese is the official language of Brazil (the only such country in Latin America) but Spanish can be understood to some degree by many Brazilians living near its borders.\n\nBecause Spain ruled the Philippines for three centuries, the country retains many Hispanic characteristics. The official language, Filipino, has absorbed a great deal of Spanish."
