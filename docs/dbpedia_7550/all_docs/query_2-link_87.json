        "text": "This guide to Nicaraguan slang is part of our Spanish slang guides, a collection of basic slang for different Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nBefore traveling to either country, having a basic understanding of common phrases, quick hits, and old stand-by sayings will make communication much easier on the ground.\n\nEven though it is more common to see slang in spoken language it does appear in the written language in Spanish language countries on occasion, among younger generations. Nicaraguan Spanish is unique as it is derived of local customs and traditions — and the terminology that has evolved around them. The slang words you hear here won’t be the same as what you hear in Argentina, Panama, or other Spanish-speaking countries.\n\nWhen visiting Nicaragua, understand these common slang terms before you go to add a dose of humor to your conversations on the ground.\n\nDale pues\n\nAlright, Okay, let’s do it, or yes thank you. Used to confirm almost everything, among strangers as well as people who know each other well.\n\nFor example:\n\n¿Taxi? Dale pues. — Taxi? Yes, please!\n\nChele\n\nThis is how Nicaraguans refer to a guy or girl. It’s used in common conversation as well as being directed at foreigners.\n\nFor example:\n\nHey chele, ¿cómo estás? – Hey dude, how are you?\n\nBacanal\n\nIf there’s a big party in Nicaragua, it’s a ‘bacanal.’ Formal or informal, and referring to organized events and impromptu get-togethers that geta bit out of hand.\n\nFor example:\n\n¿Vas al bacanal? — Are you going to the party?\n\nCumiche\n\nBaby or youngest of the family.\n\nFor example:\n\nLa sopa es para el cumiche. — The soup is for the baby.\n\nChaval and chavala\n\nGuy and young lady, used generally with a bit more respect than ‘chele.’\n\nFor example:\n\nEse chaval. — That guy.\n\nAndo palmado\n\nI am broke.\n\nPerson 1:\n\n¿Vamos al cine?\n\nPerson 2:\n\nNo, ando palmado.\n\nFor example:\n\nShould we go to the cinema? No, I am broke.\n\nTapudo\n\nLiar or someone with a big mouth. It’s not a good thing to be known as a ‘tapudo’ in Nicaragua.\n\nFor example:\n\nNo seas tapudo. — Do not be a liar!\n\nJaña\n\nNovio o novia is tbe formal term, but this is how Nicaraguans refer to a girlfriend or boyfriend in casual conversation.\n\nFor example:\n\nTu jaña me dijo que era tu cumpleaños. — Your girlfriend told me it was your birthday.\n\nChunche\n\nThis is how Nicaraguans refer to pretty much anything that could simply be described as a “thing.” Maybe that’s a box, maybe it’s a cupholder, whatever it is, it’s a ‘chunche.’\n\nFor example:\n\nPásame el chunche ese. — Pass me that thing.\n\nDeacachimba\n\nCool or awesome! This word is used at quick bouts of excitement, or as a reaction to something the person liked.\n\nFor example:\n\nEncontré 100 riales en la calle. ¡Deacachimba! – I found 100 riales on the Street. Awesome!\n\nRiales\n\n‘Cordobas’ is the real name for Nicaraguan currency but locals call it riales.\n\nFor example:\n\nYo no tengo muchos riales. — I don’t have much money.\n\nCommunicating in Nicaragua\n\nExpand your Spanish vocabulary beyond slang terms before visiting Nicaragua, and have a better trip for the effort. Learn more about how to talk like a true local by starting with our Spanish Survival Crash Course.\n\nEach day for six days, we’ll send e-books and audio lessons directly to your inbox to help you get a basic foundation for the language, FREE!"
