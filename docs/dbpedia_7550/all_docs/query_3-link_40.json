        "text": "In the 17th century, Spanish explorers made military expeditions into what is now Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. Building on Native American trading paths, the Spanish created “royal roads,” called “camino reals.” Competing against British and French colonial expansion, they established military forts, trading posts and missions for the religious and social conversion of American Indians. These settlements and cultural exchange laid the foundation for art, architecture, language, music, food and traditions that define the region today. Visit El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail and San Antonio Missions National Historical Park in Texas and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro National Historic Trail in New Mexico to experience this rich history.\n\nNot far offshore of Assateague Island National Seashore in Virginia, two Spanish shipwrecks rest under the ocean waters. Testaments to the dangers of colonial era shipping, artifacts from the La Galga and the Juno shipwrecks are on display in the visitor center. According to popular legend, which Marguerite Henry famously retold in her classic children’s book Misty of Chincoteague, Assateague’s Chincoteague ponies are descendants of Spanish horses that came ashore after escaping the La Galga or another shipwreck.\n\nCésar E. Chávez National Monument in California preserves the office and burial place of one of the most important Hispanic leaders during the 20th century in the United States. César E. Chávez led farm workers and supporters in the establishment of the country's first permanent agricultural union -- the United Farm Workers of America. His leadership brought sustained international attention to the plight of farm workers, and secured them higher wages and safer working conditions. This had a major impact on labor rights and the recognition of Hispanic Americans to the economy and culture.\n\nSpanish culture remains prevalent throughout the Southwest. You can see it in the architecture, accents, food, music and religion. It’s been almost 400 years since Fray Francisco Fonte arrived in New Mexico and began establishing missions to convert native Pueblo people to Christianity. Franciscan friars met stiff resistance and when drought, epidemics and natural disasters began to decimate the population of the Salinas Valley, the Pueblo peoples felt they had insulted the spirits and returned to their old beliefs. This story comes alive at the extensive ruins preserved at Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument.\n\nThe British colony of Georgia was founded in part to act as a buffer zone between South Carolina and the Spanish territory of Florida. Fort Frederica was built on St. Simons Island as a military installation, but it also became a lively commercial center. Under founder James Oglethorpe, the settlement furthered a social agenda that advocated for penal reform and the abolition of slavery. It is best remembered as the site of the 1742 Battle of Bloody Marsh between the British and Spanish, which ensured English dominion over Georgia and limited Spanish influence to Florida. Today, Fort Frederica National Monument preserves the fort’s remains and helps tell the story of the cultures that shaped the area’s early history.\n\nAlaska might be the last place in America people think of when it comes to Spanish influence, but a series of Spanish expeditions along the West Coast in the 1700s left their mark on the Last Frontier. As part of a five-year scientific voyage, Alessandro Malaspina’s expedition took botanical and mineralogical findings, updated maps, searched for new trade routes and made contact with the Tlingit Alaskan Natives. While the Spanish eventually lost all claim to Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, the Spanish legacy is still evident in places like the Malaspina Glacier in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.\n\nAfter the United States annexed Mexico’s northern territories in 1848, many of the new American citizens moved north and east. One of these Hispanic Americans was Teofilo Trujillo, who settled with his wife in Colorado’s San Luis Valley west of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in 1865. The Trujillo homesteads are now a National Historic Landmark and part of the Sangre de Cristo National Heritage Area. The two ranches, where the Trujillo family had struggles and success, help reveal the settlement history and influences of Hispanic culture in the Southwest.\n\nOriginally built as a newspaper headquarters, the Freedom Tower in Miami, Florida, is considered the \"Ellis Island of the South” for its role as the Cuban Assistance Center from 1962 to 1974. A National Historic Landmark, the Freedom Tower is an important physical manifestation of this period of Cold War era politics and the Cuban exodus experience. The 17-story building, based on the design of a Spanish cathedral tower, served as a symbol of hope and freedom, and the firm belief that democracy should be available to all who fight against tyranny. The Cubans who passed through its halls became a vital part of the South Florida community.\n\nIn 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain’s 200 years of control and unlocked a great gateway to the West -- the Santa Fe Trail. From 1821 until 1880, trade between Mexico and the United States flourished and western migration expanded. People shared their products and culture along the trail at places like Bent’s Old Fort National Historic Site in Colorado and Pecos National Historical Park in New Mexico. Today, living historians recreate the sights, sounds and smells of the past with guided tours, demonstrations and special events.\n\nThis Spanish system of fortifications in San Juan, Puerto Rico is the oldest European construction in U.S. territory and one of the oldest in the New World. Expanded many times over 150 years, the walls eventually protected the entire city of San Juan against repeated attacks from the British and Dutch. Designated a World Heritage Site, San Juan National Historic Site preserves these massive fortifications and offers programs on the Spanish and Latino history of the island forts. These remarkable buildings are an important part of Puerto Rico’s history and provide a stunning backdrop to the vibrant culture of San Juan.\n\nValle de Oro National Wildlife Refuge is a natural oasis in the urban landscape of Albuquerque, New Mexico. Urban refuges like Valle de Oro offer unique environmental education and recreation opportunities in highly populated areas while promoting the mission of the refuge system to protect wildlife and their habitats. The refuge works closely with the neighboring Hispanic community to improve residents’ well-being and access to green space and inspire the next generation of public land stewards."
