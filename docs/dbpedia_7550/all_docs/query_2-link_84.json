        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nHuman languages are complex symbolic systems, found in all human societies. No other animal has a communication system that has the scope and complexity of human languages, and no other animal can acquire such a system as readily as humans can. Thus there must be something unique about being human that allows for the creation and transmission of language. Identifying this property has been a central goal of cognitive science. Two broad classes of answers have been proposed. The first possibility is that language is a direct consequence of our mental architecture, and thus the capacity to create language is present is every human mind. For instance, perhaps the language faculty itself is a part of our genetic endowment (e.g., Chomsky, 1968; 2000; Pinker, 1994) or perhaps language is a product of more general changes in our conceptual resources and computational abilities (e.g., Christiansen & Chater, 2008). On this view, language is a window into the mind, and its properties and organization reflect the structure of human cognition (Chomsky, 1975; Pinker, 2007). The second broad possibility is that language developed gradually over historical time, rather than phylogenetic time, through a process of “cumulative cultural evolution” (Tomasello, 2011; Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). From this perspective, language is a side effect of the human capacity for social learning and cultural transmission (e.g., Tomasello, 2008). Since direct evidence on the origins of language is difficult to come by, arguments for these two alternatives tend to rest heavily on the theorist's prior assumptions about what kinds of learning and evolutionary change are or are not plausible.\n\nRecently, however, a new tool has appeared for exploring this question. By studying emerging sign languages, such as Nicaraguan Sign Language (NSL), we can gain new insights into the time scale of language creation, which provide hard constraints on the role of historical processes and cognitive predispositions. This research program has painted a more nuanced picture of how historical and cognitive processes interact, suggesting that the answer varies depending on the phenomenon of interest (e.g., Flaherty & Senghas, 2011; Pyers et al., 2010; Senghas, 2003). We suggest that many features of language do not emerge in one step from a single human mind acting in isolation, nor do they require long periods of historical evolution. Instead these elements emerge over the span of a few generations, suggesting that convergence on these forms does not require prolonged historical evolution, but may require a community of users, a process of transmission, and in some domains, sequential age cohorts of child learners.\n\nNSL is a new language created by a deaf community in Managua, Nicaragua over the past four decades. Before the 1970s, there were few opportunities for deaf people to gather together and interact, and consequently Nicaragua had no standardized sign language. But in the mid-1970s and early 1980s, the government opened a new primary school for special education, followed by a vocational program for adolescents, and for the first time, deaf Nicaraguan children and adolescents were able to gather together in large numbers (Polich, 2005). Lessons were in spoken Spanish and instruction focused primarily on lip-reading and speaking Spanish, but met with limited success. The children, however, like deaf students everywhere, began communicating with each other through gestures, and a new sign language emerged (Kegl & Iwata, 1989) that continues to develop to this day. Each successive group of children who enters the community introduces linguistic complexity into the language that adults evidently do not acquire (Senghas, 1995; Senghas & Coppola, 2001). This situation gives rise to a distinctive pattern in the language community, where the older signers, the initial creators of the language, represent earlier stages of the language relative to younger signers (Senghas, Kita, & Özyürek, 2004). To capture the changes in the language over time, researchers initially compared the language of the first cohort of children who entered the community in the late 1970s and early 1980s, to a second cohort of children who entered the community in the late 1980s. Today, NSL has multiple co-existing age cohorts of users, from the creators of the language to the young children now learning and changing the language.\n\nPrevious work on NSL has found that different properties of the language have emerged over time and across these cohorts. Taken together, the findings suggest, first, that language is not solely an individual achievement—some properties emerge only over time within a social context—and second, that language, or at least these properties of language, are also not the product of slow process of cultural evolution—the time scale is one of decades rather than millennia (c.f. Tomasello, 1999).\n\nThe seeds of language are present in individuals, as evidenced by the creation of gestural communication systems by deaf children who are not exposed to a manual language they can acquire. These homesign systems possess some key properties of language, such as vocabulary, grammatical categories, and word order (e.g., Goldin-Meadow, 1979; Goldin-Meadow, Butcher, Mylander, & Dodge, 1994; Goldin-Meadow & Feldman, 1975; Goldin-Meadow & Mylander, 1983). The first cohort of NSL signers, drawing on their gestures and homesign (Coppola, 2002; Coppola & Newport, 2005), created an ordered system with a stable lexicon that enabled them to express abstract thoughts beyond their immediate surroundings (Richie, Yang, & Coppola, 2013; Senghas, 1995; Senghas & Coppola, 2001). Other early-emerging elements of the language used by the first cohort of signers include words for cardinal numbers, a distinction between the syntactic categories for nouns and verbs, and devices for indicating argument structure (Flaherty & Senghas, 2011; Flaherty & Goldin-Meadow, personal communication; Senghas, Coppola, Newport, & Supalla, 1997). With the appearance of the second cohort there emerged systematic ways of describing spatial relations (to the right of, to the left of), using spatial morphological marking to indicate the roles of the patient and recipient in an event, and language to express mental states (Pyers & Senghas, 2009; Pyers et al., 2010; Senghas, 2003).\n\nThis body of work, along with work in other domains (e.g., Goldin-Meadow, 2003), demonstrates that some features of language, those reflecting properties of individual minds (as seen in homesign systems) are immediately or very quickly available at the onset of the creation of a new language (e.g., Flaherty & Senghas, 2011; Senghas & Coppola, 2001; Richie, Yang, & Coppola, 2013), while other aspects, perhaps those requiring reiterated learning, take longer to emerge (e.g., Pyers et al., 2010; Senghas, 2003).1 NSL contains many features that have been observed in other languages that are thought to be universal, including a stable lexicon, the grammatical categories noun and verb, and words for abstract concepts. Additional features that are observed in mature sign languages, such as a grammatical use of space, have emerged within two generations. Accordingly, the language of each age cohort of signers differs from the language of the cohort that preceded it, indicating a role for social interaction and learning.\n\nThe present study explores a new domain– temporal language– to continue the exploration of which concepts and devices emerge rapidly, and which appear over a few generational transitions. This work provides evidence regarding aspects of grammar that may depend heavily on intergenerational processes. Time is a rich area of study because temporal language encodes basic features of experience that all animals must be able to represent, such as order and simultaneity, but it does so in a highly abstract way, allowing these concepts to be generalized across time scales and over a variety of events. Temporal relations are critical for social communication: they provide structure to a narrative, they anchor causal explanations, and they are central in providing useable instructions. Accordingly, every language needs means to express temporal relationships, though the specifics of how they do it varies.\n\nThere are several reasons to expect that the expression of time might emerge early in a language. Primitive representations of time, fundamental to learning and survival, are available to all living creatures (Gallistel, 1990; Carr & Wilkie, 1997; Wilkie, 1995). Making sense of the world requires segmenting a stream of perceptual input into events. All events, from hearing human speech to tracking an object in motion, are perceived over time. Engaging in spatial and causal reasoning requires an understanding of temporal structure (Nelson, 1996), and understanding the behavior of agents and objects requires temporal concepts such as before and after (e.g., understanding that the window was in pieces after the ball hit it). Unsurprisingly, the ability to perceive temporal relations has been detected in early infancy (e.g., Bahrick, 1988; Chang & Trehub, 1977; Demany, McKenzie, & Vurpillot, 1977; Gardner, Lewkowicz, Rose, & Karmel, 1986; Lewkowicz, 2000). Given the cognitive importance of time, the early development of temporal perception, and the critical role of time in communication, one might predict that temporal language would emerge early in the creation of a new language.\n\nHowever, there are also strong reasons to expect that the emergence of temporal language might depend on social and cultural processes that extend across generations. First, many temporal terms refer to time scales and relations that are quite different from the simple temporal relations that are needed for basic event perception and causal analysis. Language encodes abstract notions of time that cannot be directly mapped onto anything in our moment-to-moment experience, like yesterday, tomorrow, and forever. Furthermore, languages differ in how they describe time. This is true not only for temporal concepts that are clearly cultural constructs (e.g., September, Tuesday, hours, and millennia) but also for temporal concepts that are more likely to be universal (e.g., day, night, before, after). Languages vary in the linguistic forms used to convey temporal information including: bound inflectional and derivational morphemes (like tense/aspect markers), free grammatical morphemes (like conjunctions), syntactic constructions (like relative clauses), and lexical items (like temporal adverbs) (e.g., Berman & Slobin, 1994). For instance, in English we must consistently mark whether an event occurred in the past, present or future relative to the moment of speaking and a reference time in the discourse. In the sentence “John was going to eat the apple” the past tense marking in the verb was indicates that the event occurred in the past, prior the moment of speaking, while the future indicated in going to refers to a future relative to that reference time (in the past).2 Aspectual information—such as whether an event has an end point and whether that endpoint was reached—is coded indirectly through a combination of verbal inflection, particles, and verb arguments. For example, in the sentence John drank soda the action has no explicit beginning or end, while the sentence John drank a soda implies a single, completed event. In English, tense and aspect can be conflated, where, for instance, the –ed at the end of a verb like stopped conveys past tense and perfective aspect. Many other languages, including American Sign Language (ASL) and Chinese are tense-less but encode aspect more consistently and directly (Klima & Bellugi, 1979; Lin, 2006; Rathmann, 2005; Smith, 1994).\n\nTense and aspect are not the only means of providing information about temporal relations in language. For example, ASL, in addition to a rich verbal aspectual system, also makes use of pragmatic context, temporal adverbs (e.g., while, during), and modality-specific devices such as simultaneous constructions (e.g., Emmorey, 2002; Rathmann, 2005). Simultaneous constructions can reflect either perceptual structure or discourse structure. When used to reflect perceptual structure, simultaneous constructions convey information about the spatial or temporal relationship between referents or events (Perniss, 2007). In simultaneous constructions, the two hands typically represent two different events, or parts of an event. The temporal relationship between the two hands as they move, simultaneously or sequentially, encodes the temporal relation between the events. The use of simultaneous constructions has been observed in multiple sign languages, including ASL, Danish Sign Language, German Sign Language, Irish Sign Language, and Quebec Sign Language (Engberg-Pedersen, 1993, 1994; Leeson & Saeed, 2002; Liddell, 2003; Miller, 1994; Perniss, 2007).\n\nA second reason that one might not expect temporal language to emerge immediately in a new language comes from studies of children that suggest that there is a gap between the temporal concepts that are provided by prelinguistic cognition and the temporal concepts encoded by language. Although children begin using tense and aspect morphology around the age of 2, other aspects of temporal language, such as temporal adverbs, prepositions, and conventional time units, are mastered much later (Nelson, 1996; Shatz, Tare, Nguyen, & Young, 2010; Valian, 2006; Wagner, Swensen, & Naigles, 2009). Interestingly, many young children will use time words productively without fully grasping their meanings. For example, a child might say after naptime to refer to some time in the future or use yesterday to describe an event in the past. This pattern has been observed for both relational terms, like yesterday and after, and terms encoding temporal units, like hour or year (Harner, 1975; Nelson, 1996; Shatz, Tare, Nguyen, & Young, 2010). These errors suggest that children have parsed the time word, understand its usage, and have identified it as a temporal term, but have not yet figured out the exact concept to which it maps.\n\nThe use of temporal terms to organize discourse presents additional challenges that children do not master until after the age of 9 (Berman & Slobin, 1994). Young children initially give descriptions organized around individual events. By 5 years, they produce narratives that link events in the order that they occurred, and employ connectives like and then and after that (Berman & Slobin, 1994). The use of more complex devices, which describe overlapping events or allow events to be presented out of their original order, increases gradually during middle childhood (Berman & Slobin, 1994; Hickmann, 2003).\n\nThese two patterns, cross-linguistic variability and a prolonged developmental trajectory, suggest that there might be a cultural and historical component to the development of temporal language. Historical linguist Guy Deutscher has argued that there is evidence for precisely this kind of trajectory in written texts from ancient languages (Deutscher, 2000; 2005). In the oldest Hittite and Babylonian texts, events are nearly always described in the order in which they occurred. Deutscher argues that the languages lacked true subordination, and lacked the temporal conjunctions that would be needed to mark relations like before, after, or while, and for this reason the writers had to rely on temporal iconicity, placing events in their true order. This example serves as the empirical centerpiece of Deutscher's (2005) argument that language is largely a cultural invention. On the face of it, his analysis suggests that the cultural forces that shape languages operate on the time scale of millennia. All biological adaptations for language must have been in place at least 70,000 years ago, the latest plausible date for the spread of anatomically modern humans from Africa (Cann, Stoneking, & Wilson, 1987). Our records of written language go back less than 5,000 years. Thus, if we take this evidence at face value, there would seem to be a gap of more than 65,000 years (over 3,000 generations) between the evolution of language and the emergence of a rich system of temporal conjunctions.\n\nThe study of creoles further complicates the picture. Creoles are young languages that may have their origins in the pidgins that form between speakers of different languages with a need to communicate. Over generations of use, a native creole language emerges. The correct characterization of tense, mood, and aspect marking (TMA) in creoles is controversial (see Singler, 1990). Bickerton and others have proposed that the TMA systems of creoles follow a standard pattern, where tense, mood, and aspect are expressed by a limited set of preverbal elements, which are placed in a consistent order: tense, mood, aspect, and then the main verb (see Bickerton, 1974; 1981; 1984; Muysken, 1981; Singler, 1990). Bickerton (1981) used this observation to motivate his Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (LBH). Other linguists have disputed this analysis, noting that some creoles fail to show this pattern of TMA marking (see Bakker, 2008; Bakker, Post, & van der Voort, 1995; Singler, 1990). Gil (2012) observed that in a sample of 76 creoles, TMA marking is obligatory only in 6 (8%), while it is obligatory in 491 of 868 non-creole languages (57%). The scarcity of obligatory TMA marking in creoles is argued to reflect their status as young languages, the implication being that they have not had sufficient time to develop it (Gil, 2012). Relevant to the current study, an additional issue is the degree to which the TMA system in a creole may have changed over time, making it difficult to determine the early system of marking solely on the basis of the current system (Singler, 1990).\n\nThe developmental data and historical patterns suggest that it would be useful to distinguish the types of temporal language that emerge early in language creation from those that might emerge later. Language production entails an inherent temporal structure, where uttering a stream of speech or signs occurs over time. As such, there may not be any convergence required for a new language to express simple temporal relations such as sequences of events. A speaker or signer may indicate the temporal order of linearly-organized events simply by relying on the order of elements in the utterance, as in “Veni, vidi, vici,” or I came, I saw, I conquered (see Jakobson, 1960). On the other hand, to clearly express more complex temporal relations (e.g., “Before the man could go to the store, his daughter had to shovel the driveway because it had snowed the previous day”) a language must develop additional linguistic devices, such as tense markers, aspectual verbs, temporal connectives, and, in sign languages, simultaneous constructions. As such, a new language may be slower in converging on stable ways of expressing more complex temporal distinctions.\n\nIn the current study, we examined the emergence of temporal language in three sequential age cohorts of NSL users. The first cohort of signers, now in their forties, entered the community in its first decade, and the language began to emerge among them. The second cohort, now in their thirties, entered the community in its second decade, building on the language of the first. The third cohort, now in their twenties, represents the third decade in the history of NSL. By comparing the three cohorts, we can see how the expression of temporal relations has changed over the course of the early emergence of NSL. If a given temporal concept is readily available to individuals and can be quickly mapped to a linguistic device, we might expect to see that device emerge in the first cohort of Nicaraguan signers. Alternatively, if a temporal concept is challenging to grasp or if its particular linguistic form is difficult to converge on, we might expect to find differences across the groups with the relevant devices emerging only in the second or third cohort. Finally, if a given linguistic strategy requires a long period of historical evolution, it should be absent from the signing of all three groups.\n\nIn the present study, participants from each of the three cohorts described temporal events in a referential communication task. We looked at how successful signers were at imparting relevant information about time to a peer from within their cohort, and whether there were differences in the linguistic devices used by members of the three cohorts to describe two kinds of temporal stimuli: 1) temporal order events, which are sequences of actions that could in principle be effectively described using a linear order strategy and 2) temporal envelope events, in which the temporal relationship between the two events is something other than a simple sequence, such as simultaneity, co-termination, and containment.\n\n4. Experiment 3\n\nIn Experiment 1, we found that the signers from the later cohorts often used numbers to mark temporal order, unlike signers from the first cohort. This was surprising because prior work demonstrates that the first-cohort signers have number signs (Katseff & Senghas, 2004) which they can use reliably to encode the cardinal value of sets of objects in both comprehension and production tasks (Flaherty & Senghas, 2011). In addition, the concepts of space, time, and number are linkable by an underlying representation of magnitude that may support generalization across these dimensions. When processing spatial and temporal, or spatial and numerical information, temporal and numerical representations are affected by spatial information (Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008; Dehaene, Bossini, & Giraux, 1993). Evidence from adults’ performance on a dual-task experiment suggests that time and number are linked. Performing mental arithmetic interferes with judgments of duration, and making duration judgments interferes with mental arithmetic (Brown, 1997). Developmental work shows that neonates can relate number and duration to spatial length when the dimensions vary in the same direction, namely both increasing or decreasing (de Hevia et al., 2014).\n\nThus, given the relation between underlying representations of time and number, we might have expected that the signers from all three cohorts would be apt to use number signs in the temporal order task. However, the first-cohort signers seldom used numbers when describing these ordered events. While this strategy was not necessary for performing the task, since the distinctions could be conveyed by signing the events in veridical order, it was still useful. When numbers were provided, the ability to produce a veridical order was improved.\n\nThe results of Experiment 1 raise the possibility that cardinal and ordinal uses of numbers emerged at different times in the development of NSL. A cardinal number encodes the number of individuals in a set, picking out the set as a group. In contrast, an ordinal number encodes the position of an item in a spatial or temporal sequence, picking out a singleton from a set. All of the prior work on number in NSL and homesign (Coppola, Spaepen, Goldin-Meadow, 2013; Spaepen et al., 2011) has looked at cardinal numbers as applied to sets of physical objects. It is believed that ordinal numbers arose later in the historical evolution of spoken languages: ordinal numbers are often morphologically derived from cardinal numbers, but cardinals are never derived from ordinals. About 10% of languages with cardinal numbers lack ordinal forms, and fail to use cardinal numbers in ordinal contexts (Stolz & Veselinova, 2013). The development of NSL may provide the opportunity to observe this process in real time.\n\nOrdinal numbers also emerge relatively later in individual children's language development, though this could reflect several different properties of their use (Colomé & Noël, 2012). First, understanding ordinality may involve a violation of one principle underlying cardinality, where the order in which you count items does not affect the final value of the set (Wiese, 2007). Second, ordinality may be a more complex notion for children to grasp because a set only has one cardinal value, but multiple ordinal values. In other words, when a set of four objects, say horses, are lined up, the cardinal value of that set is four, but each horse has a different ordinal position: first, second, third, and fourth (or last). Finally, ordinal words, with the possible exception of first and last, are far less frequent than cardinal numbers (e.g., third is less frequent than three) in children's input (e.g., Colomé & Noël, 2012; Miller et al., 2000).\n\nThere are three possible reasons for the observed difference in the use of ordinal numbers across the cohorts. The first possibility is that the difference is an artifact of our task, which was not explicitly designed to probe ordinality. Perhaps the first-cohort signers do not use ordinal numbers when they are not clearly relevant, but can use them in a more transparent counting task. The second possibility is that the first cohort has difficulty using numbers to order transient events, but is able to use them to order physical objects. The final possibility is that first-cohort signers have difficulty using numbers to express any kind of ordinal relations, perhaps because a new language is slower to converge on explicit markers of ordinal relations than it is to converge on markers for cardinal values.\n\nIn Experiment 3, we used a task that required the use of ordinal markers to identify the position of an object in a line. If the cohort difference was due solely to task demands, or to an inability to use ordinal numbers for events, then we would expect first-cohort signers to perform similarly to the later cohorts in this task. However, if the cohort difference reflects a change in the devices available to mark ordinal relations of any kind, then we should expect it to persist in this task. As a control, we included trials designed to elicit use cardinal numbers to ensure that all participants were able to use numbers to mark the cardinality of a set.\n\n4.1 Method\n\n4.1.1 Participants\n\nParticipants in this study were 26 Nicaraguan signers, 9 first-cohort signers (mean age=41.44, range: 36-47), 9 second-cohort signers (mean age=30.33, range: 28-33), and 8 third-cohort signers (mean age=21.63, range: 20-24). All of the first-cohort and second-cohort signers and most of third-cohort signers (7 out of 8) had participated in Experiment 1 (one year earlier), and two of the first-cohort signers and two of the second-cohort signers participated in Experiment 2. All participants were exposed to NSL by 6 years of age.\n\n4.1.2 Materials and procedure\n\nWe adapted a task used by Colomé & Noël (2012) to test children's understanding of cardinal and ordinal numbers. Participants were shown a series of pictures (some with simple animations) and asked to describe what they saw. In our version of the task, each picture consisted of one to five items of the same kind arranged in a line. The objects were either animate (birds, bees) or inanimate (planes, cars), and had a clear front and back (defined by a face or the object's typical direction of motion). The objects all faced a single reference object (e.g., a tree) and thus this object defined the front of the line. The location of the reference object (far left or far right) was counterbalanced across items. During the practice trials, the experimenter took care to ensure that participants understood that the reference object defined the direction from which counting should begin (left to right or right to left). On the cardinal trials, participants either saw a set of stationary objects ( ) or an event in which a subset of objects moved in place (e.g., danced or bounced). On the ordinal trials, there were always at least three objects in the line, and one of the objects was singled out, either because it was brightly colored while the other objects were gray ( ), or because it performed some action (like moving towards the reference object) while the other objects were stationary.\n\nParticipants were asked to describe the pictures. However, if they did not spontaneously provide a cardinal number on cardinal trials or information about the ordinal position of the target object on ordinal trials, the experimenter would ask a follow-up question. For example, on a cardinal trial without any motion the experimenter would ask, “How many are there all together?” In contrast, on an ordinal color trial, the experimenter would point to the brightly colored object and ask questions like, “Where is the blue bird?” or “Which one is the blue bird?”\n\nThere were a total of 24 trials, 12 cardinal trials and 12 ordinal trials. Using two lists, List A and List B, trials were counterbalanced for whether the set of objects appeared in a cardinal or ordinal trial. The ordinal position of the target object (first, second, third, fourth, or fifth) was counterbalanced across items. A subset of trials were excluded from the analyses because they involved multiple objects engaged in an action, and it turned out to be unclear in the responses whether participants were indicating the cardinal value of objects that moved or the ordinal position of the objects that moved. After excluding those trials, there were 18 trials remaining in each list. In addition, the majority of participants were unable to see the motions the objects underwent in two trials in List B, and so those trials were excluded as well, yielding 34 trials for analysis.\n\n4.1.3 Coding\n\nSigned descriptions of the cardinal trials were coded for whether signers indicated the cardinal value of the set using a number sign, and whether they provided the correct cardinal value. Descriptions for the ordinal trials were coded for whether the signer indicated an ordinal position (in some manner), and whether the ordinal position indicated was the correct one for the target object. Given the affordances of the visual-manual modality, there are multiple ways in which a signer can encode ordinality. We coded the ordinal trials for the presence of four devices: the use of number signs referring to the ordinal position, the use of points-to-fingers, the use of points-to-space, and the use of classifiers.\n\nThe first device is straightforward: in signed languages, like spoken languages (Stolz & Veselinova, 2013; Veselinova, 1997), some ordinal numbers can be derived from cardinal numbers (e.g., Liddell, 1997; Zeshan, 2003). In NSL, we have detected no morphological marker that differentiates ordinal from cardinal numbers. Thus any number sign produced on an ordinal trial was taken to be an ordinal number, and was coded as correct if it corresponded to the position of the target item relative to the reference object.\n\nA response was coded as points-to-fingers when the signer used the fingers of one hand to represent the set of depicted items (which was always five or fewer), and then used the other hand to point to a finger representing the target object. Unless the signer gives an explicit indication of which finger represents the front (and thus the start of the count list), there are two possible interpretations of such a point. For instance, a point to the index finger when holding up four fingers could correspond either to the first position or the fourth position. We coded the signer's use of this device as correct if the signer's point picked out the correct item under either interpretation.\n\nPoints-to-space occurred when the participant established an ordered set of items in the signing space and then pointed to one of the established locations to indicate the target item. These responses were coded as correct when the space that was pointed to was the one that was associated with the target object.\n\nClassifier use also involves the establishment of a set of referents in the signing space, and the selection of one of these referents. In sign languages, classifiers express location, handling, and stative-descriptive information as well as motions of referents in the sign space. The placement and location of classifiers in the three-dimensional signing space in front of the signer provides information about the relationships between referents (see Emmorey, 2002 for a review). Due to the nature of our stimuli, which depicted animals and vehicles, the majority of the classifier handshapes we observed were entity/whole object, where the hand is used to represent the object as a whole. We coded use of this device as correct if the signer's use of a classifier picked out the correct target object.\n\n4.2 Results\n\nOur initial analyses focused on the proportion of trials in which the signers provided numerical information and the degree to which this information was accurate. Our secondary analyses looked at the specific devices that were employed. All of our analyses used logistic mixed-effects models with the same coding scheme employed in Experiments 1 and 2.\n\nOn the cardinal trials, the signers from all three cohorts consistently produced number signs that correctly conveyed the number of items in the set ( ). Thus, there were no significant differences between the cohorts in number use (second cohort: Z=0.00, p=1.00; third cohort: Z=0.00, p=1.00) or accuracy (second cohort: Z=0.509, p=.611; third cohort: Z=−1.099, p=.272).\n\nIn contrast, on many of the ordinal trials, the first-cohort signers did not provide information about ordinal position, resulting in differences across the cohorts ( ). Specifically, first-cohort signers, as represented by the intercept, were less likely than second-cohort signers to indicate ordinal position (second cohort: Z=2.107, p=.035) or to do so accurately (second cohort: Z=2.385, p=.017). The differences between the first cohort (the intercept) and the third cohort were not statistically significant for indicating ordinal position (third cohort: Z=1.703, p=.089) or for accuracy (third cohort: Z=1.286, p=.199). There was also no significant difference between the second cohort and the third cohort for indication of ordinal position (Z=0.431, p=.667) or accuracy (Z= 1.139, p=.255). We suspect that the results relative to the third cohort reflect the limited size of our sample and variability in the performance of the third-cohort participants, rather than any meaningful change in the language between the second and third cohort.\n\nOur final analysis focused on the four specific devices that were used to indicate the ordinal position of the target object, and the degree to which their use changed across the cohorts ( ). Separate mixed effects models were constructed for the presence of each type of device. There were no significant differences across the cohorts in the use of ordinal numbers, points-to-fingers, and classifiers ( ). However, there was a significant difference between the first cohort and the second cohort, and between the first cohort and the third cohort, in use of points-to-space to indicate the ordinal position of the target object.\n\nTable 7\n\nDevicePredictor b Wald's zp-valueOdds ratioNumber signsCohort 1−7.874−2.319Cohort 22.2190.573.5679.200Cohort 33.2960.872.38327.017Points-to-fingersCohort 1−.3169−0.386Cohort 2.82940.729.4662.292Cohort 3−.1552−0.135.8920.856ClassifiersCohort 1−2.4183−3.248Cohort 2−0.029−0.030.9760.971Cohort 31.24251.303.1933.464Points-to-spaceCohort 1−5.700−4.194Cohort 23.2312.128.033*25.300Cohort 34.4182.946.003*82.902\n\n4.3 Discussion\n\nThree clear findings emerged from Experiment 3. First, the signers from all three cohorts consistently and accurately used number signs to convey cardinal value, confirming that they have signs for numerals, and they are able to use them to count the members of sets (Flaherty & Senghas, 2011). Second, while second-cohort signers provided accurate information about the ordinal positions of objects in arrays, first-cohort signers often did not do so (85% vs. 57%). This pattern is consistent with what we observed in Experiment 1, where first-cohort signers were less likely to explicitly mark the order of events. The results from Experiment 3 demonstrate that the cohort difference persists in a task where explicit ordinal information is necessary (rather than redundant), and where it is objects, rather than events, that are being ordered. This difference, however, is quantitative rather than qualitative: first-cohort signers are able to provide order information, using a variety of linguistic devices, even if they are inconsistent in doing so. Third, we found that all three cohorts used a variety of different devices to mark ordinal relations, with no clear preference for one device, though ordinal position is most often encoded spatially rather than through ordinal number signs. Only the use of points to space increased reliably in the second (and third) cohort. Taken together, these findings suggest that the consistent marking of ordinal relations emerges gradually in a new language.\n\n5. General discussion\n\nThe emergence of a new sign language in Nicaragua offers us the opportunity to capture how a language is created, allowing us to address central questions in cognitive science: to what degree are the seeds of human language present in each individual human mind (Chomsky, 1968; 1975; 2000; Pinker, 1994); to what degree do these seeds require social context and transmission across individuals to become a natural language; and whether these social processes unfold over millennia as the cultural evolution hypothesis suggests (Deutscher, 2005; Tomasello, 1999; Tomasello, Kruger, & Ratner, 1993). By looking at the emergence of temporal language in three sequential age cohorts of NSL, we hoped to disentangle the respective contributions of human cognition and repeated social transmission within a community of users, at least in this particular linguistic domain. Temporal concepts range in complexity, from simple, such as order (one thing happening after another), to more complex (one thing starting after another, but ending before the other ends). Given the prevalence of time in our everyday experiences, there are reasons to expect temporal language to emerge early in language creation. At the same time, the abstractness and complexity of time may create conceptual hurdles for the learner (Snedeker, Geren & Shafto, 2012; Tillman & Barner, 2015) or make it more difficult for communities to quickly converge on effective linguistic devices.\n\nWe observed differences in how quickly effective ways to communicate about time emerge in NSL, depending on the kind of temporal relations entailed in an event. Signers from all three cohorts were well able to linguistically convey simple ordered events, but younger signers, those in the second and third age cohorts, outperformed older signers in describing events with more complex temporal relations.\n\n5.1 Cohort differences in the referential communication task\n\nThe difference that we identified between cohorts in conveying complex temporal relations did not stem from a failure to detect the relevant temporal contrasts. If it had, we would have observed a corresponding difference between cohorts in change detection, and we detected no such difference. We recognize that one limitation of the current study is our small sample size. Even so, there are good reasons to think that these abilities are robustly present in all cohorts. First, we tested the participants who had the poorest performance on the communication task, and were therefore the most likely to have a memory or perceptual deficit. Second, the perceptual distinctions used in this task are ones that are available to infants and non-human animals (Bahrick, 1988; Chang & Trehub, 1977; Demany, McKenzie, & Vurpillot, 1977; Gardner, Lewkowicz, Rose, & Karmel, 1986; Lewkowicz, 2000). Accordingly, the cohort differences appear to reflect systematic differences in how frequently and effectively signers use emergent linguistic devices to convey temporal contrasts.\n\nFurther evidence for this interpretation comes from a pilot study that we conducted on the ability of first-cohort signers to understand the linguistic descriptions that had been generated in Experiment 1. In this study we used a matching task, where participants saw a signed description from either a first-cohort signer or a second-cohort signer, and were asked to select between two movies that depicted the same base events but had contrasting temporal relations. The results from this preliminary work suggest that first-cohort signers perform better when shown descriptions produced by second-cohort signers, rather than by first-cohort signers, suggesting that they are able to make use of the richer linguistic descriptions provided by the younger signers. This, along with our finding here that there is no cohort difference in the ability to detect differences in temporal relations, suggests that the cohort differences in the referential communication task are due to differences in language production, not to differences in the comprehension or conceptual encoding of temporal relations. The implication is clear: While the cognitive understanding of temporality is evident in signers from all cohorts, it takes time, and at least two generation of signers, before the language converges on systematic and consistent ways of conveying this information.\n\n5.2 The development of devices for encoding temporal order in NSL\n\nWhen describing a sequence of events, first-cohort signers primarily rely on the order of signs to convey information about the order of the events. In contrast, second- and third cohort signers use ordinal numbers to mark the temporal order of the events. The drop in the use of lexical items to convey temporal order information as NSL passed from the second to the third cohort suggests that ordinal numbers may be emerging as the preferred device in the language for conveying the temporal order of arbitrary sequences.\n\nDespite these cohort differences in linguistic descriptions, there was no difference among the three cohorts in their performance on the referential communication task. First-cohort signers were able to rely on just the order of signs within the utterance to successfully comprehend descriptions of temporal order, raising the question of why an alternative device such as the use of ordinal numbers to mark temporal order would ever emerge. Consider for a moment our finding that the use of ordinal numbers was associated with a greater likelihood of signing the four events in the correct order. This finding suggests three possible explanations. The first possibility is perhaps the least interesting: it may be that both factors are affected by some third variable (such as the effort needed for verbal encoding or momentary changes in attention) but not closely related to one another. The second possibility is that correct ordering facilitates the use of ordinal numbers. Inaccurate ordering is information that is available to us in our analysis but is not, in any obvious way, available to the signer (who presumably is unaware of any inaccuracy until after the trial ends). Thus, the mechanism by which it could influence communication is murky, making this possibility seem unlikely. The third, and perhaps most sensible account is that ordinal numbers serve as memory placeholders, allowing for better recall of events and their order within a sequence. Thus, while ordinal numbers may not substantially improve addressees’ comprehension, at least in our task, they may help language producers in the retrieval and description of longer events.\n\n5.3 The development of devices for encoding of temporal overlap in NSL\n\nThe clearest difference in our data across the cohorts of NSL signers was in the ability to convey complex temporal relations between events (the temporal envelope distinctions). First-cohort signers, who were at chance in the referential communication task, primarily rely on lexical items such as stop, wait, and next. Signers from the second and third cohorts were above chance in the referential communication task, but exhibited different distributions of device use. While the frequency of the use of lexical items increased from the first to the second cohort, it dropped back down for the third cohort. In contrast, there was a gradual increase in the dual use of hands across the three cohorts, suggesting that NSL may be converging on this particular device for indicating temporal overlap between two events. The use of simultaneous constructions to convey temporal information has been observed in a number of other sign languages, including ASL, British Sign Language, Danish Sign Language, Irish Sign Language, and Quebec Sign Language (Emmorey, 2002; Engberg-Pedersen, 1993, 1994; Leeson & Saeed, 2002; Liddell, 2003; Miller, 1994; Morgan, 2002; Rathmann, 2005). Simultaneous constructions may prove to be a sign language universal, taking advantage of the capacity for simultaneity in the manual modality, in contrast to the strict linearization required by vocal production (e.g., Emmorey, 1995; Padden, 1988; Perniss, 2007). While there is little developmental data on native signing children's acquisition of simultaneous constructions, this particular device appears to require considerable linguistic skill, since the signer must represent two referents or two events, one with each hand, and encode their locative or temporal relation to each other.\n\nThe complexity of this device may explain why first-cohort signers have greater difficulty with the Envelope events than with the Order events. The use of simultaneous constructions to describe temporal information may present a challenge of articulation or cognitive load for signers, who must manage the multiple components of these constructions, producing signs for two different events, one on each hand, and controlling the onset and offset of the manual movements to encode the temporal relation. Note that our subset of signers in Experiment 2 did not have difficulty with comprehending or encoding these temporal relations, suggesting that the slower emergence of the dual use of the hands to convey temporal relations (relative to devices for ordering information) is due to the greater linguistic complexity of their expression.5 Simultaneous constructions may require certain high-level linguistic skills, such as a contrastive use of space and a violation of symmetry across the two hands, and such devices may be slow to emerge in a new language and consequently be absent in the language of the first cohort.\n\nOn the other hand, given the complexity of the simultaneous constructions, it is remarkable that they emerged over these mere three cohorts of language users. These constructions link two separate events into a single higher-level unit, and thus are distinctly more complex than the simple listing of events (parataxis) that Deutscher (2005) suggests characterized discourse prior to the cultural creation of connectives and subordination a few thousand years ago. This suggests three possibilities. First, rich linguistic encoding of temporal relations may not be as slow to develop as Deutscher's analysis would suggest, in either spoken or signed languages. Instead, the lack of connectives or subordination in early texts could reflect limitations in the historical record, the development of discourse conventions within the written modality, or cross-linguistic differences in the kinds of temporal devices that are preferred. A second possibility is that while spoken languages may be slow to converge on strategies for tightly linking two clauses, sign languages may develop them more rapidly because of the affordances of the modality, including the possibility of the simultaneous use of two articulators. Finally, it may be that the development of these linking strategies is linked to some other feature of life in a complex society, that would allow such structures to emerge in Semitic languages only after the advent of literacy, while enabling them to appear rapidly among urban users of NSL, who are immersed in large social networks and a literate culture, with frequent instances of displaced communication.\n\n5.4 Ordinal numbers in NSL\n\nExperiment 3 was designed to determine whether our finding of cohort differences in the use of ordinal numbers was due to the nature of our temporal task, to a difficulty in using number to order transient events (though not objects), or to a general difficulty in using numbers to express ordinal relations. We found that older signers are able to use devices other than number signs to convey ordinality in a different task, though they do so infrequently. Thus, the later emergence of numerals to mark the temporal order of events does not appear to be due to a lack of understanding of ordinal relations. We did not observe any systemic morphological distinctions between the number signs used for the cardinal trials and the number signs used for the ordinal trials, perhaps because the overall use of number signs was low across the cohorts on the ordinal trials, or perhaps because such a morphological distinction is not present in NSL. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the number signs on the ordinal trials had the semantic function of ordinals because these signs systematically provided veridical information about order, and false information about cardinality. While it is possible that these number signs refer to the cardinal value of the set up to the point of the third bird rather than the ordinal position, we believe this is unlikely for two reasons. First, on the cardinal trials, signers from all three cohorts consistently produced number signs that correctly conveyed the final value of the items in the set, suggesting that signers are accustomed to using cardinal numbers to enumerate the complete set. Second, in the ordinal trials, the target object was distinguished in some way (e.g., the third bird was blue, see ). Signers often produced modifiers (e.g., color adjectives) when providing information about the ordinal position of the target. As such, it seems unlikely that the number signs produced on the ordinal trials refers to a subset rather than the ordinal position given that only one object was distinguished in the relevant way way (the third bird is the only blue bird). Third, signers’ use of the other ordinal devices, such as the point-to-fingers, often contained cardinal and ordinal information, suggesting that they distinguish the two values. For instance, signers would hold up the number of fingers corresponding to the value of the set (four fingers) and then point to the third finger to indicate the ordinal position of a member of the set.\n\nIn the three age cohorts of signers studied here, we did not observe specifically ordinal linguistic devices, suggesting that the language is still converging on a systematic way for expressing ordinal relations. This slower emergence of ordinal words in NSL, relative to cardinal words, is in line with research showing that ordinal words are overall less frequent than cardinal words in spoken languages (Colomé & Noël, 2012, Miller et al., 2000). In some spoken languages, the same number words can be used for both functions, with no lexical or morphological distinction between them.\n\nAdditionally, the finding that ordinal numbers are slow to emerge in NSL is intriguing in light of developmental work indicating a later understanding of ordinality relative to cardinality in children (Colomé & Noël, 2012). Relative to the study of cardinals, limited work has been done on the acquisition of ordinal numbers (Fischer & Beckey, 1990; Miller et al., 2000; Meyer, Barbiers, & Weerman, 2015; Colomé & Noël. 2012; Trabandt, Thiel, Sanfelici, & Schulz, 2015). Some work suggests that children acquire small ordinal numbers before large ordinal numbers (Colomé & Noël, 2012; Trabandt, Thiel, Sanfelici, & Schulz, 2015), but it is not yet known whether ordinal numbers are acquired in a stepwise fashion, similar to cardinal numbers. There is some specific evidence that the pattern of ordinal number acquisition may be affected by language-specific factors such as whether or not the language uses regular or irregular ordinal morphology (Meyer, Barbiers, & Weerman, 2015).\n\nGiven that ordinals arise later in the history of spoken languages (and are often derived from cardinals), it is not surprising that we did not observe a systemic morphological distinction in the form of number signs used in cardinal and ordinal contexts in our experiment. Further work is needed to better understand whether this later development in the history of a language reflects a conceptual hurdle or the need to develop linguistic machinery for deriving ordinals from cardinals. We favor a linguistic account for this pattern: the fact that we saw a systemic semantic distinction between the numbers provided on the ordinal and cardinal trials suggests that signers can both quantify sets and determine the ordinal position of a member of a set. Taken together, these findings suggest that while some numerical devices are available earlier in the emergence of a new language than others, concepts that can be and are marked linguistically in languages, like cardinal and ordinal numbers, appear to be available even to users of a language in which they are not yet marked. Linguistic marking does not seem to be required to be able to conceptually distinguish between cardinals and ordinals.\n\n5.5 Limitations and future directions\n\nThe study of emerging sign languages, such as NSL, offers a rare opportunity to better understand how historical and cognitive processes interact to give rise to human language. As is the case with all natural experiments, there are uncontrolled factors in the populations we study. One such factor is that our participants do not live in cultural isolation. Most live with extended families, including spouses and children. Many hold jobs, take public transportation, frequent various public spaces such as shops, and are immersed in the local community.\n\nAs such, NSL is not an isolated language and its users are not isolated from the surrounding Nicaraguan culture. It is quite possible that temporal language might not have developed as quickly if they were more isolated. However, recognizing a positive effect of cultural contact is different from identifying a source of temporal marking in NSL. There are three points worth considering in regard to this issue.\n\nThe first is that prior work has shown that immersion in culture is not sufficient to drive the development of a language within a single child, as in the case of homesigners. While immersion in a rich culture, exposure to temporal concepts through schooling, and access (albeit limited) to spoken Spanish may hasten the developing of the marking of temporality (compared complete cultural and linguistic isolation), such exposure alone cannot account for the pattern of emergence of temporal language we observe in NSL. Access to a spoken or written language that marks tense or aspect is insufficient on its own to drive the creation of new resources in a language to mark temporality; signers must also be able to interpret temporal markers in others’ signing and converge on selected forms as a group.\n\nSecond, while many deaf Nicaraguans likely have had enough exposure to written Spanish to have noticed the marking of temporal information, this access is available to members of all three cohorts, and thus does not easily explain the pattern of emergence and convergence on the linguistic markers for those concepts over the second and third cohorts, documented here.6 Beyond a very general sense of temporal marking, knowledge of Spanish grammar does not transfer to the devices we have documented in NSL. Indeed, our data show that NSL did not even adopt the tense system of Spanish, but developed a quite different system of aspectual marking. It is similar to other, more mature sign languages in that it uses the three-dimensional signing space, but is not adopted wholesale from an existing sign language, as evidenced by differences between the systems, including some (apparently) intermediate stages in NSL.\n\nHowever, exposure to written Spanish could influence the development of NSL in a more subtle way. For instance, being surrounded by a mature language may hasten the emergence of systems for marking information, such as temporality, in a new language. In addition, the development of a rich system of temporal marking may depend on other developments in the language, such as a rich set of verbs and classifier constructions. Once those components are in place, the language may be better able to build a system of temporal marking. Language contact may have an effect at this early point, as the language is laying its foundations, even if it cannot explain the pattern of change that occurs across the cohorts (who have similar levels of exposure to Spanish).\n\nThus, while it is possible that signers who were not immersed in a rich culture would have taken longer to mark temporal information, these concerns cannot explain the specific pattern of emergence we capture here. The development of temporal marking in NSL reveals the development of new ways to mark temporal information, not an increasing infiltration of the concept of temporal contrast into the community. Nonetheless, future work should investigate the influence of other relevant factors on the emergence of a language, including the effects of contact with other languages, education, literacy, technological advances, and the size of the community of users.\n\n5.6 Conclusion\n\nIn sum, within our exploration of the emergence of temporal language, we found different patterns of development depending on the type of temporal information being expressed. The speed at which a language converges on preferred devices for conveying information may depend on the abstractness of the representations under consideration. While the capacity for representing temporal concepts appears to be present in the human mind, the linguistic devices to convey temporality do not emerge immediately, nor do they take hundreds of generations to construct. Instead, language creation and convergence may span just two successive age cohorts of child learners, as seen in the appropriation of linguistic forms from other domains, such as the use of ordinal numbers to mark the temporal sequence of a series of events, or even three successive age cohorts of learners, as with the expression of complex temporal relations between events.\n\nHow or why might linguistic structure, here a system for temporal marking, take a few generations to emerge? We have considered four possibilities. The first is that the emergence of a particular structure may be delayed by the need for convergence in the linguistic community. While the capacity to represent and communicate different concepts may be present even in individual signers, the community must always converge on selected forms, leading to a delay in the production of systematic and reliable forms across signers. Depending on the content of the underlying representations, convergence may be slower or faster, as observed in the differences in the emergence of devices for conveying information about temporal order information compared to information about temporal relations between events. Factors that might lead to easier convergence include high frequency of use, the number of alternative encodings present in the earliest phases of language creation, and the degree to which the meaning or function of a form can be readily inferred from context by those who encounter it for the first time.\n\nAnother possibility is that the critical or sensitive period of language learning has a bottleneck effect on language emergence. Once a child, or a group of children, mature and become adults, they may no longer able to effect change on the language (or acquire later changes in the language). A subsequent generation of children would therefore be necessary drive further development of the language. Language creation may be a product of multiple sensitive periods of learning, requiring at least several generations of children.\n\nA third possibility is that complex temporal devices may be able to emerge only after other features of the language have stabilized. The temporal devices we studied are used to relate two or more events to one another. Doing this presumably requires that the signers have efficient and stable ways of representing events and their components (verbs and their arguments). For example, while signers from all cohorts had signs for the actions represented in the events, instances of dual use of hands employed a classifier handshape to represent the agent of the action and a movement to represent the action. That is, this device contains multiple components. The dual use of hands may only be possible once certain other features of the language, such as classifier handshapes, have stabilized and are accessible and componential to some degree.\n\nA fourth possibility may be that temporal devices emerge over a couple of generations because their refinement depends on properties of the language acquisition processes. One constraint on a natural language is that it must be a system that can be transmitted and learned by a young child. As children acquire a language, they change the language (Senghas & Coppola, 2001). Through use, forms may emerge in the first or second cohort of signers that simply cannot be acquired by young children. Other forms may emerge only later because they result from child minds refining, mislearning, or reorganizing the input they are given (e.g., Hudson Kam & Newport, 2009; Singleton & Newport, 2004). If reiterative rounds of restructuring are required for a specific form, the process might take several generations.\n\nFor example, one might imagine that children may have a bias towards linguistic strategies in which the properties of an event are directly reflected in the form of the utterance. In spoken languages, claims like this have been argued to explain the subject-first preference in word order (e.g., Bever, 1970; Dowty, 1991; MacWhinney, 1977; Osgood, 1980). Perhaps the dual use of hands strategy of using one hand per event, and directly encoding the temporal relation between them, reflects children's bias for such analog mapping. Such an account would be predicted by those who propose that iconicity is central in children's acquisition of sign language (e.g., Thompson, Vinson, Woll, & Vigliocco, 2012). However, while iconicity is advantageous for adults and older children, very young children appear to be unable to easily leverage it in lexical acquisition (e.g., Magid & Pyers, under review), and there is no strong reason to believe that children would be more inclined to take advantage of iconicity at higher levels of linguistic structure. Indeed, the earliest temporal devices to emerge in NSL are not ones that exploit similarities between the linguistic form and the real world that it describes. While one might predict that signers would capitalize on iconicity wherever possible in the creation of a new language, particularly in the manual modality (e.g., Barsalou, 1999; McNeill, 1992; Taub, 2001; Werner & Kaplan, 1963/1984), this strategy does not appear to be automatically favored. Rather than mapping language form directly to the structure of the events in the world being represented, such as describing a series of events in the order that they occur, first cohort signers of NSL instead tend to make use of lexical items to convey temporal information.\n\nOne might also expect that, once a device has been developed for a function, it would be readily taken up by subsequent generations of learners. However, the second cohort signers, as children, did not consistently match the input provided by the previous cohort. As the language is passed down from one generation of learners to the next, it is altered, rather than being faithfully reproduced. Thus, while the seeds of later-emerging structures are present in the signing of the first cohort, the language was reorganized in the transmission to a new cohort of learners, and infrequent devices were used with increasing frequency and consistency. Language, then, is a product of individual minds interacting within a community of multiple successive age cohorts of learners. As language is passed down, it is continuously taken up and changed, and each generation leaves its mark."
