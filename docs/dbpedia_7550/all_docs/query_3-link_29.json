        "text": "What is the difference between Hispanic and Latino?\n\nHispanic and Latino are the two most used terms to describe Americans with Latin American and Caribbean ancestry. You may often see these terms used interchangeably, but different people understand and use these terms differently. The National Museum of the American Latino uses the term “Latino” to describe the diverse residents of the United States with cultural or ancestral ties to Latin America or the Caribbean. For many, the term \"Latino\" also creates room for acknowledging Black, Indigenous, Asian, and other heritages on equal terms with European ancestry. The term “Hispanic” is used to signal a connection to Spain or the Spanish language.\n\nWhen is Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is celebrated each year from September 15 to October 15. It began as a week-long celebration in 1968 under President Johnson and was expanded to a month by President Reagan 20 years later in 1988. The month-long celebration provides more time to properly recognize the significant contributions Hispanic/Latino Americans have made in the United States.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month does not cover one single month but instead begins in the middle of September and ends in the middle of October. The timeframe of this month is significant because many Central American countries celebrate their independence days within these dates, beginning on September 15 with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. By aligning with these independence dates, Hispanic Heritage Month honors the resilience and determination of the Hispanic community. Key Independence Days celebrated within Hispanic Heritage Month include:\n\nSeptember 15 - Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua\n\nSeptember 16 – Mexico\n\nSeptember 18 – Chile\n\nSeptember 21 - Belize\n\nLearn more about the unique Latin Independence Days traditions and celebrations.\n\nWhy is Hispanic Heritage Month so Important?\n\nLatinas and Latinos have always held significant roles throughout our country’s history, dating all the way back to the American Revolution. Hispanic Heritage Month is important because it provides an opportunity to celebrate the integral part the Hispanic/Latino community has had in growing and strengthening our democracy.\n\nRepresentation matters. Latinos and Latinas continue to shape our nation as business owners, activists, artists, public servants, and more. From serving in the U.S. military to being champions in the fight for civil rights, Latinas and Latinos remain strong leaders and changemakers.\n\nIt’s crucial to make sure that the contributions of the Latino community are showcased, and that Latinas and Latinos have a voice. According to 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, one in every four children in the United States is Hispanic/Latino. A recent study found that Latino history is largely left out in high school textbooks that are used across the United States, despite the increasing percentage of Latina and Latino students. This also comes at a time when the economic output of American Latinos would rank fifth in the world if the community were an independent country. As the country continues to increase in diversity, it’s necessary for all citizens to learn more about American Latino experiences to recognize and value the many contributions Latinas and Latinos have made.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month is an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the unique voices and experiences of Hispanic/Latino Americans and recognize their history, journeys, and achievements. Through these celebrations, we can all help to inspire younger generations and bring communities together.\n\nLearn more about why and how we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month also provides opportunities to showcase the cultural influences the Latino community has had on the United States. From entertainment and sports to business and science, Latinas and Latinos enrich our society.\n\nAs athletes, Latinas and Latinos have been game changers. For example, over the years, the Latino community has helped to shape America’s favorite pastime—baseball. As of opening day in 2023, about 30 percent of Major League Baseball players are Hispanic/Latino. With the accomplishments of past players like Roberto Clemente and present ones such as Francisco Lindor and Javier Báez leading the way, the sport will continue to evolve.\n\nLatinas have also shaped baseball history, serving as players, broadcasters, and team owners. In the 1990s, Linda Alvarado purchased the Colorado Rockies and made history as the first woman to ever win a bid to buy a team. This purchase also resulted in her becoming the first Hispanic MLB team owner. The contributions of Latinas like Alvarado and others, such as baseball player Margaret \"Marge\" Villa and sportscaster Jessica Mendoza, have forever transformed the game of baseball.\n\nExplore our online resources to learn more about American Latino experiences and how you can join the Hispanic Heritage Month celebration:\n\nLatino Culture: Learn about the diverse Latino culture and how it has contributed to the society and culture of the United States.\n\nLatin Independence Days: Learn about the different Independence Days across Latin America and how they are celebrated and honored each year.\n\nLatin Food: Explore Latino recipes and learn about special events that Latino dishes are a central part of.\n\nFamous Latinos: Learn about famous Latinos and Latinas who have helped to shape the history and culture of the United States.\n\nLatino Art: Discover Latino artists who have used their unique experiences to help shape American culture through creative forms.\n\nHispanic Heritage Month Educational Resources: Find all the Hispanic Heritage Month resources you need to teach yourself and others about Hispanic heritage and culture.\n\nHow can I celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month?\n\nDuring Hispanic Heritage Month, celebrate by taking the time to learn more about Latino identity and historical legacies that enrich communities and continue to shape our nation.\n\nCelebrate the Work of Key Figures in Latino History\n\nHispanic Heritage Month offers an opportunity to learn about and celebrate the diversity and resilience of American Latinas and Latinos.
