        "text": "For thousands of years before European colonization, the Americas were inhabited by Indigenous populations, such as the Pueblo, Aztecs, Taíno, and Mayans. Each civilization had distinct traditions, beliefs, and social structures. When Spain first began to colonize the Americas around the late 15th century, there were major consequences.\n\nSome of the Indigenous communities resisted Spain’s rule. However, due to the brutality of European colonization and new diseases like smallpox, measles, and influenza brought to the area, many groups were weakened and forced to live under colonial control.\n\nBeginning with early European colonization around the 1500s, Africans and their descendants were enslaved throughout the Americ​as. When possible, they fled to escape slavery, sometimes alongside Indigenous people. Together, they built new communities and customs, often fighting the many injustices of colonization.\n\nLearn more about early colonization and the resistance of different colonized peoples.\n\nOver many centuries, Spain’s colonial rule expanded across Central and South America, as well as what is now the Southern United States. The Spanish language and culture blended with African and Indigenous influences to shape new ways of life that created unique Latino cultures and experiences. The complex interactions between these distinct groups have defined the diverse history of the Latino ​￼​community.\n\nThe Mexican-American War and the Spanish-American War significantly impacted the United States Latino communities. Both wars greatly expanded the United States with new territories but resulted in great ​changes for the established Latino communities living in impacted ​areas.\n\nLearn more about how the Latino community expanded throughout the United States as a result of war.\n\nThe Mexican-American War began in 1846 over a boundary dispute between the border of Texas and Mexico. The war officially ended in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Through this treaty, the United States gained a significant amount of ​territory, including the present-day states of California, Nevada, Utah, and most of New Mexico and Arizona. The Mexicans living in those states at the time became citizens of the United States, yet many lost their land and representation to Anglo-Americans and Europeans moving to the ​area.\n\nAn additional expansion of the Latino community in the United States came as a result of the Spanish-American War. ​The war ended in​ 1898 when the United States and Spanish governments signed the Treaty of Paris. As a result, the United States gained several territories and islands, including Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines.\n\nLearn about the expansion of the United States beyond the continent."
