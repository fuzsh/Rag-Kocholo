        "text": "Enable High Contrast (508)\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnglish learners (ELs) are a growing part of the K–12 student population. Between the 2009–10 and 2014–15 school years, the percentage of EL students increased in more than half of the states, with increases of over 40 percent in five states.1 Under the Every Student Succeeds Act, states must annually assess the English language proficiency of ELs, provide reasonable accommodations for them on state assessments, and develop new accountability systems that include long-term goals and measures of progress for ELs. While Spanish was the most common language spoken by ELs at home in 2014–15, in some states there was more variation in the home language. The need to support less commonly spoken languages could also be different across school districts.\n\nInformation about the characteristics and location of ELs in the following story map may help inform decisions about the provision of instructional supports and services for these students. These figures represent the latest look at ELs across the country, primarily using publicly available data for the 2014–15 and 2009–10 school years. See figure notes for specific data sources.\n\nNote: Data included in this story may differ slightly from data in other published reports due to certain data decisions. More information.\n\nThe charts are interactive. Hover over or click on chart elements to learn more about specific data points and, where they appear, use buttons to filter or sort charts by select groups.\n\nHispanic or Latino students represented more than three times the share of ELs, compared to all students.\n\nMore than 75 percent of ELs in 2014–15 were Hispanic or Latino, but made up just 25 percent of all students. Asians also comprised a larger percentage of ELs than all students; about 5 percent of all students were Asian, but Asians accounted for 11 percent of ELs. White students made up the third-largest share of ELs at 6 percent.\n\nOverall, 10 percent of students were ELs. A similar percentage of students with disabilities were ELs (9.9 percent). In comparison, ELs represented 14 percent of all homeless children enrolled in public school, 15 percent of students served by either Public Title I Schoolwide Programs or Targeted Assistance School Programs , and 39 percent of eligible migrant children who resided in the state.\n\nThough ELs made up 10 percent of students with disabilities, 14 percent of all ELs were students with disabilities, compared to 13 percent of the overall student population.a The chart below shows the percentage of ELs with disabilities and the percentage of non-ELs with disabilities by disability category.\n\nAmong ELs with disabilities, nearly 50 percent had a specific learning disability, compared to nearly 38 percent of students with disabilities who are not ELs. Similarly, 21 percent of ELs with a disability, compared to 17 percent of non-ELs with a disability, were identified as having a speech or language impairment.\n\nEnglish Learners were heavily concentrated in districts and schools with their EL peers.\n\nThese graphs highlight the fact that English learners were not equally distributed across all districts. In 2014-15, almost half of all ELs were enrolled in the relatively few districts (7 percent) with a high proportion of ELs, while a total of 75 percent of districts enrolled either a low proportion of ELs or no ELs at all. The clustering of ELs in these districts does not appear to be attributed just to the size of the districts, as these same districts enrolled only 15 percent of the total student population overall.\n\nSimilar to the district data, we see that EL students were not equally distributed across all schools either. More than 60 percent of schools enrolled either a low proportion of ELs or no ELs at all. In 2014-15, only 15 percent of schools enrolled a high proportion of ELs. However, 61 percent of all English learners in the nation where enrolled in this 15 percent of schools. These same schools only enrolled 16 percent of the total student population, indicating a high concentration of English learners clustered in these schools.\n\nEnglish Learners Mapped\n\nWhile school districts across large sections of the country had low percentages of ELs in 2014–15, those with the highest concentrations of ELs clustered in the Southwest and in Alaska. (See tables below the map that identify the 10 districts with the highest concentration of ELs in terms of number of ELs and percentage of ELs.) In addition, nearly 60 percent of districts with ELs enrolled in a language instruction educational program (LIEP) in 2009–10 and 2014–15 experienced an increase in these students over time. However, there was no distinct geographic pattern among districts experiencing an increase.\n\nIn total, ELs in U.S. public schools speak over 400 different languages.a In 2014–15, more than three-quarters of all ELs spoke Spanish. The next most commonly spoken non-English languages were Arabic, Chinese, and Vietnamese. However, these languages were spoken much less commonly than Spanish, representing about 2 percent each.\n\nSpanish was the language most commonly spoken by ELs at home in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and in all but seven of those states, more than 50 percent of the ELs in the state spoke Spanish at home. The states in which Spanish was not the most common language were Alaska (Yupik languages), Hawaii (Iloko), Maine (Somali), Montana (German), and Vermont (Nepali). The number of unique languages spoken by ELs in each state varies from five in Mississippi to more than 225 in Pennsylvania.a\n\nOverall Notes\n\nData in this story represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nData sources are identified in figure notes and source notes. With the exception of some data analyses for districts and schools, these data are publicly available. For the district map showing the percentages of students who are ELs, a privacy protection algorithm was applied to EDFacts local education agency (LEA)-level EL enrollment data prior to their use in this story map.\n\nFor the languages analysis, the “other languages” category includes English. Language codes of “uncoded” and “undetermined” are always classified in the other languages category. The language code of “no linguistic content/not applicable” was classified to “missing” except for Georgia, where it was classified as “other languages” because the state provided explanatory information.\n\nMap Notes\n\nA district might have “null/missing data” indicated on the maps, or may not appear on the maps, if\n\nthe district has missing EL enrollment, LIEP enrollment, or total student membership;\n\nthe district has more than 100 percent of its students reported as ELs;\n\nthe district did not match with the National Center for Education Statistics’ district boundary file; or\n\nthe data were suppressed for privacy protection (fewer than six students enrolled).\n\nThe map showing the percentages of students who are ELs is based on EL enrollment counts from EDFacts and total student enrollment from the Common Core of Data (CCD). Because of data quality concerns, this map uses Rhode Island’s and Vermont’s school-level EL enrollment aggregated to the LEA-level.\n\nThe map showing the percentage change in the number of ELs enrolled in an English language instruction educational program (LIEP) uses publicly available data from the Common Core of Data (CCD). Note that not all ELs are enrolled in LIEP. Illinois and Mississippi have missing data for almost all districts. In addition, because Vermont reports LIEP enrollment only for supervisory unions and such enrollment cannot be attributed to districts, the map suggests Vermont has no ELs in LIEP. However, because of the way Vermont reports its data, the percentage change in LIEP cannot be calculated.\n\nOn the maps, the label “Elementary” includes all school districts that are financially responsible for providing education only to children in the elementary grades. Some elementary school districts share territory with one or more secondary school districts. The label “Independent Elementary” refers to those elementary school districts that are geographically independent of other school districts.\n\nThe label “Secondary” includes all school districts that are financially responsible for providing education only to children in grades above the elementary grades. This includes pseudo-secondary school districts created by the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe label “Unified” refers to districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists."
