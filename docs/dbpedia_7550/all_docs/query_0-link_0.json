        "text": "The following is a list of countries where Spanish is an official language, plus several countries where Spanish or any language closely related to it, is an important or significant language.\n\nOfficial or national language\n\n[edit]\n\nSpanish is the official language (either by law or de facto) in 20 sovereign states (including Equatorial Guinea, where it is official but not a native language), one dependent territory, and one partially recognized state, totaling around 442 million people.[1][2]\n\nPrimary or only official language\n\n[edit]\n\nIn these countries and territories, Spanish is the main or mostly used language of communication of the vast majority of the population; official documents are written chiefly or solely in that language; and it is taught in schools and utilized as the primary medium of instruction as part of the official curriculum.\n\nSovereign states\n\n[edit]\n\nSovereign state Status Population\n\n(2021)[3] Regulatory body More information Mexico De facto[4] 130,207,371 Academia Mexicana de la Lengua Mexican Spanish Colombia De jure[5] 50,355,650 Academia Colombiana de la Lengua Colombian Spanish Spain[a] De jure[6] 47,260,584 Real Academia Española Peninsular Spanish Argentina De facto[7] 45,864,941 Academia Argentina de Letras Rioplatense Spanish Peru De jure[8] 32,201,224 Academia Peruana de la Lengua Peruvian Spanish Venezuela De jure[9] 29,069,153 Academia Venezolana de la Lengua Venezuelan Spanish Chile De facto[10] 18,307,925 Academia Chilena de la Lengua Chilean Spanish Guatemala De jure[11] 17,422,821 Academia Guatemalteca de la Lengua Guatemalan Spanish Ecuador[b] De jure[12] 17,093,159 Academia Ecuatoriana de la Lengua Ecuadorian Spanish Bolivia[c] De jure[13] 11,758,869 Academia Boliviana de la Lengua Bolivian Spanish Cuba De jure[14] 11,032,343 Academia Cubana de la Lengua Cuban Spanish Dominican Republic De jure[15] 10,597,348 Academia Dominicana de la Lengua Dominican Spanish Honduras De jure[16] 9,346,277 Academia Hondureña de la Lengua Honduran Spanish Paraguay[d] De jure[17] 7,272,639 Academia Paraguaya de la Lengua Española Paraguayan Spanish El Salvador De jure[18] 6,528,135 Academia Salvadoreña de la Lengua Salvadoran Spanish Nicaragua De jure[19] 6,243,931 Academia Nicaragüense de la Lengua Nicaraguan Spanish Costa Rica De jure[20] 5,151,140 Academia Costarricense de la Lengua Costa Rican Spanish Panama De jure[21] 3,928,646 Academia Panameña de la Lengua Panamanian Spanish Uruguay De facto[22] 3,398,239 Academia Nacional de Letras Uruguayan Spanish Equatorial Guinea[e] De jure[23] 1,468,777 Academia Ecuatoguineana de la Lengua Española Equatoguinean Spanish Total 464,509,172 Association of Academies of the Spanish Language\n\nTerritory\n\n[edit]\n\nTerritory Status Population\n\n(2021)[24] Regulatory body More information Puerto Rico[f] De jure[25] 3,142,779 Academia Puertorriqueña de la Lengua Española Puerto Rican Spanish\n\nSecondary official language\n\n[edit]\n\nSpanish is a secondary language, co-official with Arabic as the primary language.\n\nPartially recognized state\n\n[edit]\n\nState Status More information Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic[g] De facto[26] Saharan Spanish\n\nNotes:\n\nSignificant language\n\n[edit]\n\nThough not an official language at the national level, Spanish is regularly spoken by significant populations throughout these countries. Public services, education, and information are widely available in Spanish, as are various forms of printed and broadcast media.\n\nTerritory Population\n\n(2022)[3] Total speakers Percentage\n\nSpanish-speaking Andorra 85,468 ~40,000 48.6% Belize 419,137 165,296 (year 2010)[27] 56.6% (year 2010)[27] Gibraltar 34,003 25,500 75% United States 339,665,118 ~60,000,000 19%\n\nAndorra\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Languages of Andorra\n\nSpanish is not the official language of Andorra but holds a special status in some fields, namely in education and business.[28] Public education in Spanish (following the Spanish public education system) is offered in the country. It is the second-most spoken language in the country, with nearly half of the population conversant in Spanish, rivaling the official Catalan in both native and total speaker numbers.[29] Spanish has also emerged as the lingua franca between various linguistic groups and in the commercial sector, which has triggered government efforts to promote the more general and universal use of Catalan.[30] In 2008, 30.8% of students were enrolled in the Spanish education system.[31]\n\nBelize\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Languages of Belize\n\nSpanish has no official recognition in the Central American nation of Belize, a Commonwealth of Nations member state where English is the official national language. However, the country shares land borders with Spanish-speaking Mexico and Guatemala and, per the 2010 Belizean census, Spanish is spoken by a sizable portion of the population; 30% claim Spanish as a mother tongue and about 50% of the population has a working knowledge of the language.[32] The Census Report 2010 reported that 56.6% of Belizeans spoke Spanish.[27]\n\nGibraltar\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Languages of Gibraltar\n\nSpanish is not official in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, which shares its only land border with Spain. Nevertheless, Spanish is compulsory for secondary school students and a mixture of Spanish and English called Llanito is colloquially spoken among most inhabitants. Recent trends since the 2000s have found, however, that Spanish proficiency and usage among younger generations is declining as members of these groups tend to use English exclusively.[33][34]\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nSpanish has been spoken in the United States for several centuries in the Southwest and Florida, which were all once part of New Spain. However, today only a minority of Spanish speakers in the U.S. trace their language back to those times; the overwhelming majority of speakers come from recent immigration. Only in northern New Mexico and southern Colorado there have been Spanish-speaking communities uninterruptedly since colonial times.[35]\n\nSpanish is the most studied foreign language in United States schools and is spoken as a native tongue by 41 million people, plus an additional 11 million fluent second-language speakers.[36] Though not official, Spanish has a special status in the American state of New Mexico.[37] With almost 60 million native speakers and second language speakers, the United States now has the second-largest Spanish-speaking population in the world after Mexico.[38] Spanish is increasingly used alongside English nationwide in business and politics. Media in Spanish has also become influential outside of native Hispanophone circles.[39][40] In the United States, the language is regulated by the North American Academy of the Spanish Language.\n\nOfficially recognized status\n\n[edit]\n\nPhilippines\n\n[edit]\n\nSpanish was the official language of the Philippines from the beginning of the Hispanic period in 1565 and through independence until a constitutional change in 1973. However, President Ferdinand Marcos had Spanish redesignated as an official language under Presidential Decree No. 156, dated 15 March 1973 and Spanish remained official until 1987, when it was re-designated as a voluntary and optional auxiliary language.[41] Additionally, the present Philippine Constitution, in its Article XIV,[42] stipulates that the Government shall provide the people of the Philippines with a Spanish-language translation of the Constitution.[43] The article was invoked and applied when, in 2015, Senator Loren Legarda introduced a Senate Bill requesting an act intended to provide translations of the Philippine Constitution into several specific languages, including Spanish.[44] The bill was accepted and approved.[45] Beyond the Constitution, the Philippine Department of Education issued DECS Order No. 33 in 1987, requiring schools to include Spanish and Arabic when offering foreign language courses, pointing out the relevance of both languages \"in the development of Philippine history and culture\".[46]\n\nOn 8 August 2007, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced that the Philippine government asked for help from the Spanish Government in her plan to reintroduce Spanish as a required subject in the Philippine school system.[47] By 2012, the language was a compulsory subject at only a very select number of secondary schools.[48] Despite government promotion of Spanish, only about 400,000 people, which accounts for under 0.5% of the population, can speak Spanish at least proficiently.[49][50]\n\nWhile Spanish is designated as an optional government language in the Philippines, its usage is very limited and not present in everyday life. Despite this, Tagalog and other native Philippine languages incorporate a large number of Spanish loanwords, as a result of 300 years of Spanish influence. In the country, Spanish is regulated by the Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language.\n\nOther legal status\n\n[edit]\n\nWestern Sahara\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Saharan Spanish\n\nSpanish is an official language, alongside Arabic, of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic,[51] a partially recognized state that claims Western Sahara. The territory, a former Spanish colony now mostly occupied by Morocco, is regarded as a non-self-governing territory by the United Nations. Although Spanish is not commonly spoken as a native language in Western Sahara, it is widely used as a secondary language in the region's SADR-controlled area, while the Moroccan government uses Arabic and French in administrating the Moroccan-occupied area.[52][53]\n\nCreole languages\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Spanish-based creole languages\n\nThere are several Spanish-based creole languages. Chavacano is spoken in Zamboanga City in the Philippines and is a regional language.[54] Papiamento is the official language in Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao; it has been classified as either a Spanish-based or a Portuguese-based creole.[55][56]\n\nChamorro is an Austronesian language with many Spanish loanwords; some scholars have considered it a creole, but the most authoritative sources deny this.[57]\n\nCountry Creole language Estimated\n\nspeakers[58] Year Status Aruba Papiamento ~100,000[59] — Official[60] Caribbean Netherlands Papiamento – – Official[61] Curaçao Papiamento 185,155[62] 1981 Official[63] Philippines Chavacano 689,000[62] 1992 Regional[54]\n\nJudeo-Spanish\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Judaeo-Spanish\n\nJudeo-Spanish (sometimes known as Ladino or other names) is a language derived from medieval Spanish; it is still spoken by some Sephardi Jews, mainly in Israel.[64]\n\nInternational organizations\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nHispanophone\n\nGeographical distribution of Spanish speakers\n\nSpanish-based creole languages"
