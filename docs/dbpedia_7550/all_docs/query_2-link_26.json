Spanish Nicaragua has hundreds of words from Nahuatl.\n\nIn the Atlantic region also spoken called \"Creole English\", as well as a number of indigenous languages spoken by some indigenous communities still exist in the area. In the Atlantic the use of English comes from the British presence in the past of this region and to the survival of ethnic groups of African origin. In this English is known as \"Creole English\" as it consists of the combination of English words of indigenous languages.\n\nThe language of Nicaragua has two important features:\n\nHis Spanish is the aspiration of the letter \"S\" as in many regions of Spain and Latin America.\n\nNicaraguans prefer that the name of the language of Nicaragua is used with the term \"Spanish\" and not \"Castilian\".\n\nthe \"vos\" is also used the use of the pronoun \"you\" is part of the standard language. As in Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Uruguay, Venezuela and the rest of Central America (except Belize and Panama).\n\nIn the language of the tuteo Nicaragua is a minority. The use of \"you\" does not exist, because all the population uses the \"vos\". The person who uses the \"you\" in Nicaragua is considered foreign or imitating another culture other than theirs.\n\nVoseo occurs in a common way for all the population uses the \"vos\" informally among friends, relatives, close people or the same age and \"you\" to the formal, used to address people with authority, adults, or older.\n\nVoseo was popularized in the language of Nicaragua after the triumph of the Sandinista Revolution speech to the country should be distinguished from the Somoza dynasty.\n\nThe variety of the language of Nicaragua is being studied by many linguists because forms and variants to pronounce words in all different corners of the country, always including the Caribbean regions."
