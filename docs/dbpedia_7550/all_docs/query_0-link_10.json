        "text": "Updated on December 15, 2023 by Lou Mac\n\nSpanish is spoken by millions of people all over the world.\n\nThis (along with many other reasons) makes it an excellent language to learn ‚Äì especially for travelling!\n\nBut exactly which countries speak Spanish?\n\nIn this post we‚Äôll look into each of the 21 Spanish-speaking countries and what makes them so special, plus give you some information about Spanish as a whole and how you can learn it yourself!\n\nSpanish Around the World\n\nSpanish is one of the most important languages in modern times: It‚Äôs the 2nd most-spoken native language in the world, and the 4th most-spoken language overall.\n\nIt‚Äôs an official language of the United Nations, and it‚Äôs also the official language in 21 countries and territories, making it an essential tool for the traveller.\n\nEven if you visit a country where Spanish isn‚Äôt the official language, it‚Äôll still come in handy ‚Äì with close to 600,000,000 Spanish speakers and Spanish learners around the globe, you can almost guarantee you‚Äôll bump into someone who knows Spanish wherever you go.\n\nSo if you‚Äôre struggling with study motivation, just think about all the awesome places and people you‚Äôll be exposed to once you learn it! This was a massive source of motivation for me, and it absolutely paid off.\n\n21 Spanish-Speaking Countries and Territories\n\nDue to colonisation from the late 15th century onwards, most of Latin America (and a small corner of Africa) now speaks Spanish.\n\nThat means you‚Äôve got a ton of beautiful destinations to practise your Spanish in!\n\nIn order from most to least populated, here are the 21 countries and territories that count Spanish as an official language:\n\nMexico\n\nColombia\n\nSpain\n\nArgentina\n\nPer√∫\n\nVenezuela\n\nChile\n\nEcuador\n\nGuatemala\n\nBolivia\n\nDominican Republic\n\nCuba\n\nHonduras\n\nNicaragua\n\nParaguay\n\nEl Salvador\n\nCosta Rica\n\nPanama\n\nUruguay\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nEquatorial Guinea\n\nNow for the fun part: Let‚Äôs have a look at the highlights of each Spanish speaking country, and why you should visit! (Note: Population statistics are as of November 2023, taken from worldometer.)\n\n1. Mexico\n\nFlag: üá≤üáΩ\n\nPopulation: 128,450,000\n\nCapital: Mexico City\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Mole, tacos al pastor, birria tacos\n\nOf all the Spanish-speaking countries in the world, Mexico is by far the most populated. It‚Äôs often associated with fiestas and delicious cuisine, but it‚Äôs so much more than that!\n\nMexico has a very rich history, and you can still find incredible Aztec and Mayan ruins like Chich√©n Itz√° (one of the New Seven Wonders of the World!) and Palenque throughout the country. It‚Äôs also home to bustling markets, festivals, diverse cities, jungles and world-famous beaches.\n\nAnd while I said Mexico is more than delicious cuisine, I still can‚Äôt leave it out of this description! In Mexico you‚Äôll find some of the best food in the world, so make sure you don‚Äôt miss out on street tacos, tamales, mezcal and the like.\n\nIf you‚Äôre travelling to Mexico and want to learn Spanish (which I recommend), you‚Äôre in luck: Mexican Spanish is one of the easier dialects to learn!\n\n2. Colombia\n\nFlag: üá®üá¥\n\nPopulation: 52,100,000\n\nCapital: Bogot√°\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Arepas, bandeja paisa, ajiaco\n\nColombia is another diverse South American gem. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with its scenery from the Amazon√≠a rainforest region, to the Ciudad Perdida (Lost City) trek, to Cocora Valley (with its famous wax palms) and the pristine beaches of Tayrona National Park.\n\nI said it‚Äôs diverse, and I was not exaggerating: It‚Äôs one of the world‚Äôs ‚Äúmegadiverse‚Äù countries, with more than 50,000 bird and plant species living there. How crazy is that!\n\nColombian food is definitely worth a try, and Colombian people themselves are known for being warm and welcoming. Colombian Spanish is another (quote unquote) ‚Äúeasy‚Äù Spanish dialect to learn, and it comes in many accents. My absolute favourite is the paisa accent, which you can listen to here. It hails from the city of Medell√≠n, which is usually a favourite for travellers (and is next on my list!).\n\n3. Spain\n\nFlag: üá™üá∏\n\nPopulation: 47,500,000\n\nCapital: Madrid\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Paella, churros, tortilla de patatas\n\nSpain is one of the most visited countries in the world, with over 100 million tourists visiting every year. And once you‚Äôve been there, it‚Äôs easy to see why!\n\nFirstly, Spanish food is just straight up amazing. Spain is famous for their paella, but they also have an incredible amount of other delicious dishes and tapas to tuck into. Their tapa culture is one of my favourite things about the place, and if you visit specific areas in the south of Spain, tapas are even free when you order a drink! (Not sure how they sustain that, but let‚Äôs not question it).\n\nThe weather is great, the architecture is spectacular, and there‚Äôs a ton of history to be uncovered. Spain has many UNESCO World Heritage Sites, such as the Alhambra (seriously impressive), the Old Town of Segovia and the Real Alc√°zar.\n\nAs far as the language goes, Spanish from Spain is relatively easy to understand ‚Äì at least it can be a lot easier than some Latin American dialects!\n\n4. Argentina\n\nFlag: üá¶üá∑\n\nPopulation: 45,780,000\n\nCapital: Buenos Aires\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Asado, empanadas, alfajores\n\nArgentina is a passionate South American country. It‚Äôs the 8th largest country in the world in terms of land mass, which makes it extremely diverse!\n\nThe beautiful and captivating capital of Buenos Aires is often referred to as the ‚ÄúParis of South America‚Äù (though I don‚Äôt think it needs to be compared to other cities, it‚Äôs just unique in its own right). The north west regions are often drier and desert-like, with dramatic rock formations like in Jujuy, and the northern border is home to the famous Iguaz√∫ Falls.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs not forget Patagonia! It‚Äôs world-famous, and absolutely lives up to the hype. It‚Äôs a massive region with so many things to explore, but some of my favourite places are the Siete Lagos, Mount Fitz Roy and the Perito Moreno glacier.\n\nOf course, if you eat meat, you cannot miss out on the Argentinean culinary scene. Their barbecue known as asado is second to none, their empanadas are bomb, and you have to join locals in sharing mate. There are so many other great foods to try, you‚Äôll just have to go yourself and see!\n\nArgentinian people themselves are great, they‚Äôre passionate about a lot of things and speak with a beautiful accent (one of my faves). They‚Äôre also often quite interested and curious about travellers, which made me feel very welcome when I was there!\n\n5. Per√∫\n\nFlag: üáµüá™\n\nPopulation: 34,350,000\n\nCapital: Lima\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Ceviche, lomo saltado, aj√≠ de gallina\n\nPeru, pe! This beautiful place captivates with its archaeological wonders and diverse landscapes.\n\nThe breathtaking mountain citadel of Machu Picchu, for example, still stands around 600 years later, and is a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient Incas. It‚Äôs a must-see for history enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.\n\nThere are countless amazing hikes throughout the country, and the food there is incredible! It‚Äôs a fusion of Spanish, African, and Asian influences, resulting in some unique and special (and very tasty) dishes.\n\nPeruvian people usually take pride in sharing their traditions and stories, and their Spanish is relatively neutral, so they shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to understand (unlike the people in neighbouring Chile).\n\n6. Venezuela\n\nFlag: üáªüá™\n\nPopulation: 28,840,000\n\nCapital: Caracas\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Pabell√≥n criollo, teque√±os, mandocas\n\nVenezuela is nestled on the northern coast of South America. Its tropical coastline borders the Caribbean Sea, while further inland you‚Äôll find the Andes and other stunning landscapes. This includes the iconic Angel Falls, the world‚Äôs highest waterfall at 979 metres (3,212 ft)!\n\nThe capital Caracas buzzes with energy, nature-lovers can explore the Gran Sabana region or hike Mount Roraima, and the beaches look like they‚Äôd cure all your problems if you swam in them.\n\nI‚Äôd love to go to Venezuela one day, but unfortunately travelling there isn‚Äôt currently recommended due to high levels of crime and political instability (though who knows how much of this is fear mongering). Some also consider it unethical to travel there currently, so that‚Äôs also something to keep in mind.\n\n7. Chile\n\nFlag: üá®üá±\n\nPopulation: 19,630,000\n\nCapital: Santiago de Chile\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Pastel de choclo, curanto, completos, empanadas chilenas\n\nClick here for more facts about Chile\n\nChi-chi-chi, le-le-le! I could write books on this long, skinny land of extremes. It stretches from the Atacama Desert (the driest non-polar desert in the world) in the north to the glaciers of Patagonia in the south, with just about every sort of landscape in between. Forests, lakes, mountains, volcanoes, you name it, Chile has it.\n\nYou could spend months exploring this country, as there is so much beauty to see in all four seasons! It‚Äôs also one of the safest countries in Latin America, which makes travel there even better. Aside from the obvious visit to Santiago and Valpara√≠so, I‚Äôd recommend that you don‚Äôt miss: Cocham√≥ Valley, the Carretera Austral, and Torres del Paine National Park (yes, I‚Äôve limited it to three places or else this post would become way too long).\n\nChilean cuisine is an interesting one ‚Äì it‚Äôs absolutely delicious, but as a traveller it‚Äôs really hard to experience because the best food is cooked at home! I‚Äôd recommend you befriend a Chilean and get yourself invited to their Mum‚Äôs place üòâ having a Chilean friend is also a great way of improving your Chilean Spanish, which is notoriously fast, full of slang and difficult to understand.\n\nChile is almost my most beloved country (second only to my home country), and a piece of my heart lives there.\n\n8. Ecuador\n\nFlag: üá™üá®\n\nPopulation: 18,190,000\n\nCapital: Quito\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Bol√≥n de verde, encocado de pescado, seco de pollo\n\nEcuador is a South American country that straddles the equator ‚Äì in fact, it literally means ‚Äúequator‚Äù in Spanish. It‚Äôs known for its biodiversity and the fascinating Gal√°pagos Islands (maybe you‚Äôve heard of those?). It‚Äôs on the expensive side to visit this famous volcanic archipelago, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs well worth it.\n\nInland you‚Äôve got Quito, Ecuador‚Äôs capital. It‚Äôs a UNESCO World Heritage site, and is a sight to behold surrounded by its volcanic peaks. Other unmissable places/activities include the popular Quilotoa Loop, the colonial city of Cuenca, the indigenous markets in Otavalo and Ba√±os de Agua Santa.\n\nFun fact: Ecuador was the first country to enshrine the rights of nature in its constitution!\n\n9. Guatemala\n\nFlag: üá¨üáπ\n\nPopulation: 18,100,000\n\nCapital: Guatemala City\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Pepi√°n de pollo, hilachas, kak‚Äôik\n\nGuatemala is located in the heart of Central America. There‚Äôs tonnes to see, from bustling markets (like in Chichicastenango) to mist-shrouded ruins (like Tikal, thought to be thousands of years old) to breathtaking volcanoes (such as the Pacaya volcano).\n\nIn fact, there are 37 volcanoes in Guatemala, 3 of which are constantly active. You can even hike up some of these (!). A friend of mine was there once when Volc√°n de Fuego (volcano of fire) erupted ‚Äì she could see it erupting in the distance, but said the locals didn‚Äôt seem too phased by it.\n\nAround half of the population is indigenous, which keeps alive the beautiful traditional textiles and lively festivals.\n\n10. Bolivia\n\nFlag: üáßüá¥\n\nPopulation: 12,380,000\n\nCapital: Sucre (constitutional capital) / La Paz (seat of government)\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Cu√±ap√©, salte√±as, sajta de pollo\n\nBolivia is one of only two landlocked countries in South America (the second being Paraguay). It‚Äôs a bit of a soft spot for Bolivians (and understandably so), who continue their fight for coastline after it was taken by Chile in the late 1800s.\n\nBut despite having no access to the ocean, Bolivia has a lot to offer. Sucre has a lovely colonial charm and La Paz takes the cake of highest capital in the world, at a dizzying (literally) 3,250-4,100 metres (10,650-13,250 feet) above sea level.\n\nYou‚Äôve probably seen the otherworldly salt flats of Uyuni, and the fun photos that people take there (my poor sister had to participate in one of these shoots with her tour group, despite being sick with gastro). But other highlights include the ruins of Tiwanaku, Lake Titicaca (the highest navigable lake) and the ‚ÄúDeath Road‚Äù (unfortunately named that for a reason), which now offers a thrilling biking experience.\n\n11. Dominican Republic\n\nFlag: üá©üá¥\n\nPopulation: 11,330,000\n\nCapital: Santo Domingo\n\nMust-Try Dishes: La bandera, mofongo, mang√∫\n\nThe Dominican Republic is renowned for its pristine beaches, vibrant music, and warm hospitality. It‚Äôs situated in the Caribbean Sea, and is home to the Caribbean‚Äôs highest peak: Pico Duarte, which rises up to 3,087 metres (10,125 feet).\n\nIt has one UNESCO World Heritage site, the Colonial City of Santo Domingo, which is the oldest continuously inhabited European-established settlement in the Americas! Not altogether unsurprisingly, it‚Äôs also the site of the first cathedral, hospital, customs house and university in the Americas.\n\nIf you‚Äôre more into beaches than history, then the stunning Punta Cana and Puerto Plata will be more up your alley.\n\nAlso, if you‚Äôre going there to practise your Spanish, I applaud you ‚Äì Dominican Spanish, along with other Caribbean dialects, are very challenging. If I‚Äôve piqued your curiosity, you can (attempt to) listen to it here!\n\n12. Cuba\n\nFlag: üá®üá∫\n\nPopulation: 11,190,000\n\nCapital: Havana\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Ropa vieja, vaca frita, boliche\n\nCuba almost seems like it was frozen in time, what with its colonial architecture and classic cars. The reason for all these funky vintage cars is that up until very recently the importation of American cars was banned, and they‚Äôve now become somewhat of a symbol for the island.\n\nCuban music is addictive and unique, and is often considered one of the most influential styles in the world. It goes hand in hand with Cuban salsa ‚Äì so Cuba would be a pretty special place to start taking salsa classes!\n\nWith its colourful streets, they say Havana is a must-visit, while the historic streets of Trinidad are also super interesting and a little bit more relaxed. Stunning white sand beaches are also found on the peninsula of Varadero and other areas.\n\nUnfortunately the authoritarian regime in Cuba doesn‚Äôt make life easy for its inhabitants.\n\n13. Honduras\n\nFlag: üá≠üá≥\n\nPopulation: 10,590,000\n\nCapital: Tegucigalpa\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Sopa de caracol, baleadas, pastelitos de perro\n\nLike a lot of Central American countries, Honduras offers a blend of Mayan ruins, tropical rainforests, and Caribbean beaches.\n\nSpecifically, the ruins of the ancient city of Cop√°n are worth seeing, along with the Pico Bonito National Park. The Bay Islands, north of the mainland in the Caribbean Sea, would be the perfect playground for those of you interested in diving. This area actually encompasses part of the Mesoamerican Reef ‚Äì the world‚Äôs second largest barrier reef, second only to the famous Great Barrier Reef in Australia.\n\nHonduras sometimes has a reputation for not being the safest of countries ‚Äì it‚Äôs not entirely untrue, though the country still receives plenty of travellers who enjoy their time there.\n\n14. Nicaragua\n\nFlag: üá≥üáÆ\n\nPopulation: 7,050,000\n\nCapital: Managua\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Gallo pinto, nacatamal, indio viejo\n\nNicaragua is a geological hotspot, and yet another Latin American country that‚Äôs located on the Pacific Ring of Fire.\n\nVolcano hiking (and volcano boarding!) is a major attraction here, despite a big handful of the volcanoes still being active. The volcanoes are awe-inspiring, but they aren‚Äôt the only thing that draws travellers to the country.\n\nLake Nicaragua and Lake Managua are the two largest lakes in Central America. Apparently, Lake Nicaragua is so large that Spanish colonists initially mistook it for the ocean. It‚Äôs even home to freshwater sharks ‚Äì apparently this is a unique phenomenon, but since I‚Äôm not a fan of sharks, I wasn‚Äôt overjoyed to hear this fact. They‚Äôre bull sharks too, which are aggressive and rather dangerous‚Ä¶\n\n15. Paraguay\n\nFlag: üáµüáæ\n\nPopulation: 6,860,000\n\nCapital: Asunci√≥n\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Pira caldo, chipa guazu, pastel mandi‚Äôo\n\nParaguay is our second landlocked South American country. It‚Äôs often overlooked by travellers, who pop between Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia without stopping by (guilty).\n\nBut I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs got a lot to offer. Part of the breathtaking Iguaz√∫ Falls is in Paraguay (so no, it‚Äôs not just Brazil and Argentina‚Äôs thing!) and the unique Guaran√≠ culture has a huge influence on the country. According to Britannica, ‚Äúmore Paraguayans speak and understand Guaran√≠ than Spanish.‚Äù\n\nThe Jesuit Missions, a UNESCO World Heritage site, offers a glimpse into Paraguay‚Äôs colonial past. Lastly, for a cultural experience, attend the lively √ëandut√≠ Festival celebrating traditional Paraguayan lacework.\n\n16. El Salvador\n\nFlag: üá∏üáª\n\nPopulation: 6,360,000\n\nCapital: San Salvador\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Pupusas, yuca frita, torta\n\nEl Salvador is the smallest country (by land size) in Central America ‚Äì but that doesn‚Äôt hold it back! To start off, it‚Äôs one of the most biodiverse places on Earth on a per unit of area basis, which is pretty cool.\n\nSecondly, it has a rich history. For example, you can visit the archaeological site of Joya de Cer√©n, a UNESCO World Heritage site known as the ‚ÄúPompeii of the Americas.‚Äù You might be able to tell from the name, but it‚Äôs called this because the pre-Hispanic farming community there met the same unfortunate end as those in Pompeii ‚Äì it was buried under a volcanic eruption in AD 600.\n\nIt‚Äôs also got interesting towns, such as San Salvador or those along the magical Ruta de las Flores. And of course, if you‚Äôre keen on the beach, the small town of El Tunco on the Pacific coast has both waves and great nightlife.\n\n17. Costa Rica\n\nFlag: üá®üá∑\n\nPopulation: 5,210,000\n\nCapital: San Jos√©\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Gallo pinto, casado, chifrijo\n\nCosta Rica is another haven of biodiversity. About 5% of all species on Earth live there, totalling a whopping 500,000 species! This is even more impressive considering that Costa Rica is a relatively small country (it ranks #129 on the list of large to small countries).\n\nIt‚Äôs also famed for its beaches and lush rainforests, like in the beautiful Manuel Antonio National Park. The Arenal Volcano National Park is another highlight, along with the dreamy Monteverde Cloud Forest.\n\nFor those after a bit more adrenaline, adventure activities abound in Costa Rica, from zip-lining through the jungle to surfing in Tamarindo.\n\nAnd let‚Äôs finish with a cool fact: Costa Rica is a global leader in environmental conservation, with over 25% of its land protected!\n\n18. Panam√°\n\nFlag: üáµüá¶\n\nPopulation: 4,470,000\n\nCapital: Panama City\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Sancocho, almoj√°banos, carne entomatada\n\nPanama, where the Pacific Ocean meets the Caribbean Sea, is renowned for its iconic canal and diverse landscapes.\n\nThe Panama Canal is an incredible feat of engineering. It extends 82 kilometres across Panama, and was built to dramatically decrease the travel time for ships between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean/Caribbean Sea. Previously they would have to pass the southern tip of South America, which was often a treacherous journey. It was completed in 1914, which I think makes it even more impressive!\n\nIf you want a beach getaway, you won‚Äôt be disappointed: The Bocas del Toro archipelago and San Blas Islands have some pretty incredible beaches and coral reefs. Then we have Panama City, a juxtaposition of skyscrapers and historic sites such as the Casco Viejo.\n\nPanama is also unique in that it‚Äôs the only place in the world where you can see the sun rise on the Pacific and set on the Atlantic!\n\n19. Uruguay\n\nFlag: üá∫üáæ\n\nPopulation: 3,420,000\n\nCapital: Montevideo\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Asado, chivito, revuelto gramajo\n\nUruguay is a cool little place (both in terms of land mass and population!). It has a laid-back charm to it, which is especially apparent if you‚Äôve just come across from Buenos Aires (which is a common route for travellers).\n\nColonia del Sacramento‚Äòs historic district is a must-see, and really makes you feel like you‚Äôve stepped onto a movie set! Montevideo has some cool colonial architecture, and some delicious food. I had the best barbecued chicken of my life there, which is very high praise since the meat I ate all over Argentina, Chile and Uruguay was incredible.\n\nThere are tonnes of great beach towns along the coast, from glamorous Punta del Este (which often sees celebrity guests) to the quirky La Pedrera (I don‚Äôt usually recommend hostels, but if you go there, you must stay at Viajero La Pedrera Hostel!). There‚Äôs also the super unique Cabo Polonio, a small settlement that has no electricity or running water, that you need a 4√ó4 to get to.\n\nLastly, Uruguay is a progressive country: It produces more than 97 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources, and has fully legalised marijuana.\n\n20. Puerto Rico\n\nFlag: üáµüá∑\n\nPopulation: 3,260,000\n\nCapital: San Juan\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Arroz con gandules, mofongo, caldo santo\n\nP.R! Puerto Rico is another super cool Caribbean island where you‚Äôll find rich history among tropical beauty. It‚Äôs also not technically a country: It‚Äôs an ‚Äúunincorporated territory‚Äù of the United States, which means it has a unique blend of both Spanish and American influences.\n\nThe cultural hub of San Juan, with its colourful colonial architecture, is a great place to start off any trip there. The El Yunque National Forest is supposed to be a sacred place in Puerto Rican culture, and is well worth the visit. For some sun and sand, check out Culebra‚Äôs Flamenco Beach, or the beautiful Vieques Island (which also offers bioluminescent bay tours!).\n\nAnd if you‚Äôre into Latin music (like me) you might be interested to know, if you didn‚Äôt already, that masses of famous musicians are from Puerto Rico. Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, Ozuna, Chayanne, Luis Fonsi, and Tego Calder√≥n (just to name a few) all call the island home.\n\n21. Equatorial Guinea\n\nFlag: üá¨üá∂\n\nPopulation: 1,710,000\n\nCapital: Malabo\n\nMust-Try Dishes: Succotash, bilolas, pambota\n\nOn our list of Spanish-speaking countries, this is our only one in Africa! Situated on the west coast of the continent, Equatorial Guinea is made up of several different cultures. These, along with the Spanish influence, makes for a unique and diverse cuisine (like those dishes mentioned above).\n\nThere are beautiful beaches on Bioko Island, where the capital is located, as well as rainforests in R√≠o Muni.\n\nThe Spanish here is typically quite different from other Spanish-speaking countries. The grammar can be a little different, as well as the pronunciation. For example, the d can sometimes sound like an r, and there is often no differentiation between the two r sounds (r and rr).\n\nCountries with Significant No. of Spanish Speakers\n\nThese next few are countries that, while not having Spanish as an official language, do have a large population of Spanish speakers. And so, they are honourable mentions on our list!\n\nUnited States\n\nPopulation: 339,996,000\n\nNumber of Spanish speakers: 42,000,000\n\nPercentage of Spanish-speakers: Around 12%\n\nAt 42,000,000 speakers, the United States actually has more Spanish speakers than most Spanish-speaking countries!\n\nBelize\n\nPopulation: 410,000\n\nNumber of Spanish speakers: 200,000\n\nPercentage of Spanish-speakers: Around 48%\n\nBelize is the only Central American country with English as its official language (though it has a large population of Spanish speakers). This is because it was once a British colony ‚Äì it was called ‚ÄúBritish Honduras‚Äù until 1973, and full independence was granted in 1981.\n\nAndorra\n\nPopulation: 80,000\n\nNumber of Spanish speakers: Approx. 32,000\n\nPercentage of Spanish-speakers: Around 40%\n\nThe official language in this tiny country is Catalan. However, being nestled in the Pyrenees between France and Spain, Spanish is very commonly spoken there.\n\nDialect Differences in Spanish Speaking Countries\n\nAs we‚Äôve seen already, Spanish differs from country to country. But exactly how much?\n\nSome people imagine it‚Äôs similar to the difference between English dialects, but I‚Äôm sure that Spanish is even more variable!\n\nThanks to influence from indigenous languages and other factors, Spanish dialects can differ in terms of everything from pronunciation and intonation to vocabulary and grammar. One of the biggest differences is between Latin American and European Spanish, however even within Latin America there is huge variety!\n\nCheck out these full posts on the topic to read more:\n\nHow You Can Learn Spanish\n\nIf you want to learn Spanish to travel to any of these countries (or just for general use), then the good news is that it‚Äôs relatively easy to learn in this day and age. The internet has provided us with a plethora of resources, from blog posts and YouTube videos to online teachers and language exchange partners. I taught myself Spanish this way, and you can, too!\n\nHere are some posts of mine that are a good place to start:\n\nBest ways to learn Spanish\n\nHow to learn Spanish fast\n\nEssential Spanish greetings\n\nMost common Spanish words\n\nHow to conjugate Spanish verbs\n\nComplete Spanish pronunciation guide\n\nHow to order food in Spanish\n\nHow to ask ‚Äúhow much‚Äù in Spanish\n\nAnd here are some more of my recommendations: If you prefer structured learning, you could try a course or app like Duolingo (yes, this can actually work!), LingQ or Rocket Languages. There are also tonnes of great podcasts, like Language Transfer and Notes in Spanish. Anki is my go-to for online flashcards, as well as Tandem and HelloTalk for having language exchanges.\n\nAs we‚Äôve seen, Spanish is spoken the world over. Its diverse dialects, whether spoken on the streets of Mexico or the beaches of Costa Rica, add depth and character to the already beautiful language.\n\nI seriously think that learning Spanish isn‚Äôt just acquiring a skill; it also opens a door to rich cultures and traditions."
