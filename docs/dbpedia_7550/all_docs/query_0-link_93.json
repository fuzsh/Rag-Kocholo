Frogh, Cartographer, International Mapping, as Technical Advisers.\n\nThe Court,\n\ncomposed as above,\n\nafter deliberation,\n\ndelivers the following Judgment:\n\nI. On 8 December 1999 the Republic of Nicaragua (hereinafter “Nicaragua”) filed in the Registry of the Court an Application dated the same day, instituting proceedings against the Republic of Honduras (hereinafter “Honduras”) in respect of a dispute relating to the delimitation of the maritime areas appertaining to each of those States in the Caribbean Sea.\n\nIn its Application, Nicaragua seeks to found the jurisdiction of the Court on the provisions of Article XXXI of the American Treaty on Pacific Settlement, officially designated, according to Article LX thereof, as the “Pact of Bogota” (hereinafter referred to as such), as well as on the declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the Court made by the Parties, as provided for in Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court.\n\n2. Pursuant to Article 40, paragraph 2, of the Statute, the Registrar immediately communicated a certified copy of the Application to the Government of Honduras; and pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article, all States entitled to appear before the Court were notified of the Application.\n\n3. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the Pact of Bogota the notifications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court. In accordance with the provisions of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court, the Registrar moreover addressed to the Organization of American States (hereinafter “OAS”) the notification provided for in Article 34, paragraph 3, of the Statute. The Registrar subsequently transmitted to this organization copies of the pleadings filed in the case and asked its Secretary-General to inform him whether or not it intended to present observations in writing within the meaning of Article 69, paragraph 3, of the Rules of Court. The OAS indicated that it did not intend to submit any such observations.\n\n4. Pursuant to the instructions of the Court under Article 43 of the Rules of Court, the Registrar addressed to States parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 (hereinafter “UNCLOS”) the notifications provided for in Article 63, paragraph 1, of the Statute. In addition, the Registrar addressed to the European Union, which is also party to that Convention, the notification provided for in Article 43, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, as adopted on 29 September 2005, and asked that organization whether or not it intended to furnish observations under that provision. In response, the Registrar was informed that the European Union did not intend to submit observations in the case.\n\n5. Since the Court included upon the Bench no judge of the nationality of either of the Parties, each Party proceeded to exercise its right conferred by Article 31, paragraph 3, of the Statute to choose a judge ad hoc to sit in the case. Nicaragua chose Mr. Giorgio Gaja and Honduras first chose Mr. Julio Gonzalez Campos, who resigned on 17 August 2006, and subsequently Mr. Santiago Torres Bernardez.\n\n6. By an Order dated 21 March 2000, the President of the Court fixed 21 March 2001 and 21 March 2002, respectively, as the time-limits for the filing of the Memorial of Nicaragua and the Counter-Memorial of Honduras ; those pleadings were duly filed within the time-limits so prescribed.\n\n7. At the time of filing of the Counter-Memorial, Honduras also filed two sets of additional documents which were not produced as annexes thereto, but were, according to Honduras, provided only for informational purposes. At a meeting held by the President of the Court with the Agents of the Parties on 5 June 2002 both Parties agreed on the procedure to be followed with regard to those additional documents. In particular, it was agreed that within three weeks following that meeting, Honduras would inform the Registry which of the additional documents it intended to produce as annexes to the said Counter- Memorial under Article 50 of the Rules of Court, and that by 13 September 2002 Honduras would file those annexes in the Registry. In accordance\n\nwith the agreed procedure, by a letter of 25 June 2002, the Co-Agent of Honduras provided the Registry with a list indicating which of the additional documents were to be produced as annexes. Those additional annexes to the Counter-Memorial of Honduras were duly filed within the time-limit agreed upon.\n\n8. By an Order of 13 June 2002, the Court authorized the submission of a Reply by Nicaragua and a Rejoinder by Honduras, and fixed 13 January 2003 and 13 August 2003 as the respective time-limits for the filing of those pleadings. The Reply of Nicaragua and the Rejoinder of Honduras were filed within the time-limits so prescribed.\n\n9. By letter of 22 May 2001, the Government of Colombia requested to be furnished with copies of the pleadings and documents annexed thereto. Having ascertained the views of the Parties pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Court decided to grant that request. The Registrar communicated that decision to the Government of Colombia and to the Parties by letters of 29 June 2001. By letter of 6 May 2003 the Government of Jamaica requested to be furnished with copies of the pleadings and documents annexed thereto. Having ascertained the views of the Parties pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Court decided to grant that request. The Registrar communicated that decision to the Government of Jamaica and to the Parties by letters of 30 May 2003.\n\nBy letter of 31 August 2004, the Government of El Salvador requested to be furnished with copies of the pleadings and annexed documents in the case. Having ascertained the views of the Parties pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Court decided that it was not appropriate to grant that request. The Registrar communicated that decision to the Government of El Salvador and to the Parties by letters dated 20 October 2004.\n\n10. By a joint letter of 9 February 2005, the Agent of Nicaragua and the Co-Agent of Honduras communicated to the Court a document signed at Tegucigalpa on 1 February 2005, whereby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Honduras made known to the Court the wishes of their respective Heads of State regarding the scheduling of the hearings in the case.\n\n11. By letter of 8 September 2006, the Government of El Salvador requested once again to be furnished with copies of the pleadings and annexed documents in the case. Having ascertained the views of the Parties pursuant to Article 53, paragraph 1, of the Rules of Court, the Court decided that it was not appropriate to grant that request. The Registrar communicated that decision to the Government of El Salvador and to the Parties by letters dated 16 November 2006.\n\n12. On 2 February 2007, the Agent of Nicaragua informed the Court that his Government wished to produce 12 new documents, namely 11 letters and one satellite image, in accordance with Article 56 of the Rules of Court. The Court, having ascertained the views of the Honduran Government, decided that as one of the documents formed part of the case file as an annex to the Reply of Nicaragua, it should not be regarded as a new document, and that the satellite image was “part of a publication readily available” pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article 56 of the Rules of Court, and as such could be referred to during the oral proceedings. The Court further decided not to authorize the production of the remaining documents. The Registrar informed the Parties accordingly by letters of 26 February 2007.\n\n13. On 15 February 2007, the Co-Agent of Honduras informed the Court that during the oral proceedings the Honduran Government intended to present a short video. On 5 March 2007, the Registrar informed the Parties that the Court had decided not to accede to Honduras’s request.\n\n14. In accordance with Article 53, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court, the Court decided, after ascertaining the views of the Parties, that copies of the pleadings and documents annexed would be made available to the public as from the opening of the oral proceedings.\n\n15. Public hearings were held between 5 March and 23 March 2007, at which the Court heard the oral arguments and replies of:\n\nFor Nicaragua: H.E. Mr. Carlos Jose Arguello Gomez. Mr. Alex Oude Elferink, Mr. Ian Brownlie, Mr. Antonio Remiro Brotons, Mr. Alain Pellet. For Honduras: H.E.

Colson, H.E. Mr. Roberto Flores Bermudez.\n\n16. At the hearings, questions were put by Members of the Court and replies given orally and in writing, in accordance with Article 61, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court. Honduras commented orally on the oral replies given by Nicaragua. Pursuant to Article 72 of the Rules of Court, each Party presented written observations on the written replies received from the other.\n\n*\n\n17. In its Application, the following requests were made by Nicaragua:\n\n“Accordingly, the Court is asked to determine the course of the single maritime boundary between the areas of territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone appertaining respectively to Nicaragua and Honduras, in accordance with equitable principles and relevant circumstances recognized by general international law as applicable to such a delimitation of a single maritime boundary.\n\nThis request for the determination of a single maritime boundary is subject to the power of the Court to establish different delimitations, for shelf rights and fisheries respectively, if, in the light of the evidence, this course should be necessary in order to achieve an equitable solution.\n\nWhilst the principal purpose of this Application is to obtain a declaration concerning the determination of the maritime boundary or boundaries, the Government of Nicaragua reserves the right to claim compensation for interference with fishing vessels of Nicaraguan nationality or vessels licensed by Nicaragua, found to the north of the parallel of latitude\n\n14° 59′ 08″ claimed by Honduras to be the course of the delimitation line. Nicaragua also reserves the right to claim compensation for any natural resources that may have been extracted or may be extracted in the future to the south of the line of delimitation that will be fixed by the Judgment of the Court.\n\nThe Government of Nicaragua, further, reserves the right to supplement or to amend the present Application as well as to request the Court to indicate provisional measures which might become necessary in order to preserve the rights of Nicaragua.”\n\n18. In the written proceedings, the following submissions were presented by the Parties :\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Nicaragua, in the Memorial:\n\n“Having regard to the considerations set forth in this Memorial and, in particular, the evidence relating to the relations of the Parties. May it please the Court to adjudge and declare that:\n\nThe bisector of the lines representing the coastal fronts of the two parties, as applied and described in paragraphs 22 and 29, Chapter VIII above, and illustrated on the graphic, constitutes the boundary for the purposes of the delimitation of the disputed areas of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone in the region of the Nicaraguan Rise.\n\nThe approximate median line, as described in paragraphs 27 and 29, Chapter X above, and illustrated on the graphic, constitutes the boundary for the purpose of the delimitation of the disputed areas of the territorial sea, extending to the outer limit of the territorial sea, but in the absence of a sector coterminous with the mouth of the River Coco and with the terminus of the land boundary”;\n\nin the Reply:\n\n“In accordance with Article 49, paragraph 4, of the Rules of Court, the Government of the Republic of Nicaragua confirms the Submissions previously made in the Memorial submitted to the Court on 21 March 2001.”\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Honduras, in the Counter-Memorial:\n\n“Having regard to the considerations set forth in this Counter-Memorial and, in particular, the evidence put to the Court by the Parties,\n\nMay it please the Court to adjudge and declare that :\n\n1. The boundary for the purpose of the delimitation of the disputed areas of the territorial sea, and extending to the outer limit of the territorial sea, is a straight and horizontal line drawn from the current mouth of the River Coco, as agreed between the Parties, to the 12-mile limit at a point where it intersects with the 15th parallel (14°59.8′); and\n\n2. The boundary for the purpose of the delimitation of the disputed areas of the continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone in the region is a line extending from the above-mentioned point at the 12-mile limit, eastwards along the 15th parallel (14° 59.8′) until it reaches the longitude at which the 1986 Honduras/Colombian maritime boundary begins (meridian 82); and further or in the alternative;\n\n3. In the event that the Court decides not to adopt the line indicated above for the delimitation of the continental shelf and Exclusive Economic Zone, then the Court should declare a line extending from the 12-mile limit, eastwards down to the 15th parallel (14° 59.8′) and give due effect to the islands under Honduran sovereignty which are located immediately to the north of the 15th parallel”;\n\nin the Rejoinder:\n\n“Having regard to the considerations set forth in the Honduran Counter-Memorial and this Rejoinder,\n\nMay it please the Court to adjudge and declare that :\n\n1. From the point decided by the Honduras/Nicaragua Mixed Commission in 1962 at 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 08.9′ W longitude to 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 05.8′ W longitude, the demarcation of the fluvial boundary line and the delimitation of the maritime boundary line which divide the jurisdictions of Honduras and Nicaragua shall be the subject of negotiation between the Parties to this case which shall take into account the changing geographical characteristics of the mouth of the River Coco; and\n\n2. East of 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 05.8′ W longitude, the single maritime boundary which divides the maritime jurisdictions of Honduras and Nicaragua follows 14° 59.8′ N latitude until the jurisdiction of a third State is reached.”\n\n19. At the oral proceedings, the following submissions were presented by the\n\nParties :\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Nicaragua, At the hearing of 20 March 2007:\n\n“Having regard to the considerations set forth in the Memorial, Reply and hearings and, in particular, the evidence relating to the relations of the Parties.\n\nMay it please the Court to adjudge and declare that :\n\nThe bisector of the lines representing the coastal fronts of the two Parties as described in the pleadings, drawn from a fixed point approximately 3 miles from the river mouth in the position 15° 02′ 00″ N and 83° 05′ 26″ W, constitutes the single maritime boundary for the purposes of the delimitation of the disputed areas of the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in the region of the Nicaraguan Rise.\n\nThe starting-point of the delimitation is the thalweg of the main mouth of the River Coco such as it may be at any given moment as determined by the Award of the King of Spain of 1906.\n\nWithout prejudice to the foregoing, the Court is requested to decide the question of sovereignty over the islands and cays within the area in dispute.”\n\nOn behalf of the Government of Honduras, At the hearing of 23 March 2007:\n\n“Having regard to the pleadings, written and oral, and to the evidence\n\nsubmitted by the Parties,\n\nMay it please the Court to adjudge and declare that:\n\n1. The islands Bobel Cay, South Cay, Savanna Cay and Port Royal Cay, together with all other islands, cays, rocks, banks and reefs claimed by Nicaragua which lie north of the 15th parallel are under the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras.\n\n2. The starting-point of the maritime boundary to be delimited by the Court shall be a point located at 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 05.8’W longitude. The boundary from the point determined by the Mixed Commission in 1962 at 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 08.9′ W longitude to the starting-point of the maritime boundary to be delimited by the Court shall be agreed between the Parties to this case on the basis of the Award of the King of Spain of 23 December 1906, which is binding upon the Parties, and taking into account the changing geographical characteristics of the mouth of the River Coco (also known as the River Segovia or Wanks).\n\n3. East of the point at 14° 59.8′ N latitude, 83° 05.8′ W longitude, the single maritime boundary which divides the respective territorial seas, exclusive economic zones and continental shelves of Honduras and Nicaragua follows 14° 59.8′ N latitude, as the existing maritime boundary, or an adjusted equidistance line, until the jurisdiction of a third State is reached.”\n\n* *\n\n2. Geography\n\n2.1. Configuration of the Nicaraguan and Honduran Coasts\n\n20. The area within which the delimitation sought in the present case is to be carried out lies in the basin of the Atlantic Ocean between 9° to 22° N and 89° to 60° W, commonly known as the Caribbean Sea (for the general geography of the area, see below, p. 670, sketch-map No. 1). The Caribbean Sea embraces an area of approximately 2,754,000 square kilo-metres (1,063,000 square miles) and is located between the landmasses of North and South America. The Caribbean Sea is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean partially enclosed to the north and east by the islands of the West Indies, and bounded to the south and west by South and Central America.\n\n21. The continental coasts of Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama bound the Caribbean Sea to the south and Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico bound it to the west. To the north and east it is bounded by the Greater Antilles islands of Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico and by the Lesser Antilles, consisting of the island arc that extends from the Virgin Islands in the north-east to the islands of Trinidad and Tobago, off the Venezuelan coast, in the south-east.\n\n22. The Caribbean Sea is divided into four main submarine basins that are separated from one another by submerged ridges and rises. These are the Yucatan, Cayman, Colombian and Venezuelan basins. The northern-most Yucatan Basin is separated from the Gulf of Mexico by the Yucatan Channel, which runs between the island of Cuba and the Yucatan Penin-sula of Mexico. The Cayman Basin, which is located further south, is partially separated from the Yucatan Basin by the Cayman Ridge that extends from the southern part of Cuba toward the Central American State of Guatemala and, midway, rises to the surface to form the Cayman Islands.\n\n23. Nicaragua and Honduras are located in the south-western part of the Caribbean Sea. To the south of Nicaragua lie Costa Rica and Panama and to the east Nicaragua faces the mainland coast of Colombia. To the north-west of Honduras lie Guatemala, Belize and Mexico and to the north Honduras faces Cuba and the Cayman Islands. Finally, Jamaica is situated to the north-east of Nicaragua and Honduras. The south-western tip of the island of Jamaica is about 340 nautical miles distant from the mouth of the River Coco where the land boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras terminates on the Caribbean coast.\n\n24. The Nicaraguan coastal front on the Caribbean Sea spans around 480 kilometres. The coast runs slightly west of south after Cape Gracias a Dios all the way to the Nicaraguan border with Costa Rica except for the eastward protrusion at Punta Gorda (14° 19′ N latitude).\n\n25. Honduras, for its part, has a Caribbean coastal front of approxi-mately 640 kilometres that runs generally in an east-west direction between the parallels 15° to 16° of north latitude. The Honduran segment of the Central American coast along the Caribbean continues its northward extension beyond Cape Gracias a Dios to Cape Falso (15° 14′ N latitude) where it begins to swing towards the west. At Cape Camaron (15° 59′ N latitude) the coast turns more sharply so that it runs almost due west all the way to the Honduran border with Guatemala.\n\n26. The two coastlines roughly form a right angle that juts out to sea. The convexity of the coast is compounded by the cape formed at the mouth of the River Coco, which generally runs east as it nears the coast and meets the sea at the eastern tip of Cape Gracias a Dios. Cape Gracias a Dios marks the point of convergence of both States’ coastlines. It abuts a concave coastline on its sides and has two points, one on each side of the margin of the River Coco separated by a few hundred metres.\n\n27. The continental margin off the east coast of Nicaragua and Hon-duras is generally termed the “Nicaraguan Rise”. It takes the form of a relatively flat triangular shaped platform, with depths around 20 metres. Approximately midway between the coast of those countries and the coast of Jamaica, the Nicaraguan Rise terminates by deepening abruptly to depths of over 1,500 metres. Before descending to these greater depths the Rise is broken into several large banks, such as Thunder Knoll Bank and Rosalind Bank (also known as Rosalinda Bank) that are separated from the main platform by deeper channels of over 200 metres. In the shallow area of the ridge close to the mainland of Nicaragua and Honduras there are numerous reefs, some of which reach above the water surface in the form of cays.\n\n28. Cays are small, low islands composed largely of sand derived from the physical breakdown of coral reefs by wave action and subsequent reworking by wind. Larger cays can accumulate enough sediment to allow for colonization and fixation by vegetation. The tropical shallow- water conditions of the western Caribbean are conducive for coral reef growth. Cays, and especially the smaller ones, are extremely vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes which occur frequently in the Caribbean.\n\n29. The insular features present on the continental shelf in front of Cape Gracias a Dios, to the north of the 15th parallel, include Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and South Cay, located between 30 and 40 nautical miles east of the mouth of the River Coco.\n\nIn this Judgment, the names of the maritime features which appear in both the English and the French text and sketch-maps are those most commonly used, whether Spanish or English.\n\n30. The area to the north-east of Cape Gracias a Dios also includes a number of important fishing banks located between 60 and 170 nautical miles from the mouth of the River Coco. Of particular importance are Middle Bank, Thunder Knoll Bank, Rosalind Bank and Gorda Bank.\n\n2.2. Geomorphology of the Mouth of the River Coco\n\n31. The land area abutting upon the maritime areas in dispute, which is known as the Miskito or Mosquito Coast, is one of deltas, sandbars, and lagoons. It is a coast where extensive and rapid morphological changes have occurred. As a result, the coast north and south of Cape Gracias a Dios is of a typical accumulative type: the shoreline is formed by long stretching sandy barrier islands or spits. Many of those islands and spits migrate constantly and slowly enclose lagoons which eventually will be filled with fine sediment and become dry land. A collection of coastal lagoons extends from Cape Camaron in Honduras to Bluefields, a town in the south of the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast. This chain of lagoons is separated from the sea by thin sand barriers. These lagoons are more in the nature of shallow pools formed by the rivers at their mouths than inroads from the sea. Continuous sediments are deposited in them and sand barriers obstruct their entrance. The most notable effect is the rapid\n\naccretion and inevitable advance of the coastal front due to the constant deposition of terrigenous sediments carried by the rivers to the sea. The strong erosion of the mountains in the interior, the abundant rain and the considerable flow on the rivers that drain the Caribbean slope of the region cause this deposition.\n\n32. The River Coco is the longest river of the Central American isthmus and bears one of the largest volumes of water. From a geomorpho- logical point of view the mouth of the River Coco is a typical delta which forms a protrusion of the coastline forming a cape: Cape Gracias a Dios. All deltas are by definition geographical accidents of an unstable nature and suffer changes in size and form in relatively short periods of time. The River Coco has been progressively projecting Cape Gracias a Dios towards the sea carrying with it huge quantities of alluvium. The sediments deposited by the River Coco are dispersed by a network of diverging and shifting river channels, a process which gives rise to a deltaic plain. The hierarchy of the river channels changes rapidly: the main channels may quickly become secondary channels and vice versa. The accumulated delta sediments are subsequently transported and redepos- ited along the Honduran coast by the Caribbean Current and along the Nicaraguan coast by the Colombia-Panama Gyre (a circular current running anticlockwise along the Nicaraguan coast). In sum, both the delta of the River Coco and even the coastline north and south of it show a very active morpho-dynamism. The result is that the river mouth is constantly changing its shape, and unstable islands and shoals form in the mouth where the river deposits much of its sediment.\n\n* *\n\n3. Historical Background\n\n33. Both Nicaragua and Honduras, which had been under the rule of Spain, became independent States in 1821. Thereafter, Nicaragua and Honduras, together with Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa Rica, formed the Federal Republic of Central America, also known as the United Provinces of Central America, which existed from 1823 to 1840. In 1838 Nicaragua and Honduras seceded from the Federation, each maintaining the territory it had before. The Federation disintegrated in the period between 1838 and 1840.\n\n34. On 25 July 1850, the Republic of Nicaragua and the Queen of Spain signed a treaty recognizing Nicaragua’s independence from Spain. According to the terms of this Treaty the Queen of Spain recognized as “free, sovereign and independent the Republic of Nicaragua with all its territories that now belong to it from sea to sea, or that will later belong to it” (Art. II). The Treaty also stated that the Queen of Spain relinquished\n\n“the sovereignty, rights and actions she holds over the American ter-ritory located between the Atlantic and the Pacific sea, with its adja-cent islands, known before by the name of the province of Nicaragua, now Republic of the same name, and over the remainder of the territories that have incorporated into said Republic” (Art. I).\n\nThe names of the adjacent islands pertaining to Nicaragua were not specified in the Treaty.\n\n35. On 15 March 1866, the Republic of Honduras and the Queen of Spain signed a treaty recognizing Honduras’s independence from Spain. According to the terms of this Treaty the Queen of Spain recognized the Republic of Honduras\n\n“as a free, sovereign and independent state, which comprises the entire territory that was the province of that name during the period of Spanish domination, this territory being bounded in the East, Southeast and South by the Republic of Nicaragua” (Art. I).\n\nThe Treaty also stated that the Queen renounced “the sovereignty, rights and claims that she has in respect of the territory of the said Republic”. The Treaty recognized Honduran territory as comprising “the adjacent islands that lie along its coasts in both oceans” without identifying these islands by name.\n\n36. Nicaragua and Honduras later attempted to delimit their boundary by signing the Ferrer-Medina Treaty in 1869 and the Ferrer-Uriarte Treaty in 1870, but neither treaty entered into force.\n\n37. On 7 October 1894 Nicaragua and Honduras successfully concluded a general boundary treaty known as the Gamez-Bonilla Treaty which entered into force on 26 December 1896 (I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 199-202). Article II of the Treaty, according to the principle of uti possidetis juris, provided that “each Republic is owner of the territory which at the date of independence constituted respectively, the provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua”. Article I of the Treaty further provided for the establishment of a Mixed Boundary Commission to demarcate the boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras:\n\n“The Governments of Honduras and Nicaragua shall appoint rep-resentatives who, duly authorized, shall organize a Mixed Boundary Commission, whose duty it shall be to settle in a friendly manner all pending doubts and differences, and to demarcate on the spot the dividing line which is to constitute the boundary between the two Republics.”\n\n38. The Commission, which met from 1900 to 1904, fixed the boundary from the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca to the Portillo de Teo- tecacinte, which is located approximately one third of the way across the land territory, but it was unable to determine the boundary from that point to the Atlantic coast. Pursuant to the terms of Article III of the\n\nGamez-Bonilla Treaty, Nicaragua and Honduras subsequently submitted their dispute over the remaining portion of the boundary to the King of Spain as sole arbitrator. King Alfonso XIII of Spain handed down an Arbitral Award on 23 December 1906, which drew a boundary from the mouth of the River Coco at Cape Gracias a Dios to Portillo de Teote- cacinte. The operative part of the Award stated that:\n\n“The extreme common boundary point on the coast of the Atlantic will be the mouth of the River Coco, Segovia or Wanks, where it flows out in the sea close to Cape Gracias a Dios, taking as the mouth of the river that of its principal arm between Hara and the Island of San Pio where said Cape is situated, leaving to Honduras the islets and shoals existing within said principal arm before reaching the harbour bar, and retaining for Nicaragua the southern shore of the said principal mouth with the said Island of San Pio, and also the bay and town of Cape Gracias a Dios and the arm or estuary called Gracias which flows to Gracias a Dios Bay, between the mainland and said Island of San Pio.\n\nStarting from the mouth of the Segovia or Coco, the frontier line will follow the vaguada or thalweg of this river upstream without interruption until it reaches the place of its confluence with the Poteca or Bodega, and thence said frontier line will depart from the River Segovia, continuing along the thalweg of the said Poteca or Bodega upstream until it joins the River Guineo or Namasli.\n\nFrom this junction the line will follow the direction which cor-responds to the demarcation of the Sitio de Teotecacinte in accord-ance with the demarcation made in 1720 to terminate at the Portillo de Teotecacinte in such a manner that said Sitio remains wholly within the jurisdiction of Nicaragua.” (Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 202-203.)\n\n39. Nicaragua subsequently challenged the validity and binding char-acter of the Arbitral Award in a Note dated 19 March 1912. After several failed attempts to settle this dispute and a number of boundary incidents in 1957, the Council of the OAS took up the issue that same year. Through the mediation of an ad hoc Committee established by the Council of the OAS, Nicaragua and Honduras agreed to submit their dispute to the International Court of Justice.\n\n40. In its Application instituting proceedings, filed on 1 July 1958, Honduras requested the Court to adjudge and declare that the failure by Nicaragua to give effect to the Arbitral Award “constituted] a breach of an international obligation” (ibid., p. 195) and that Nicaragua was under an obligation to give effect to the Award. Nicaragua, for its part, requested the Court to adjudge and declare that the decision rendered by the King of Spain did not “possess the character of a binding arbitral award”, that in any event it was “incapable of execution by reason of its omissions, contradictions and obscurities” and that Nicaragua and Honduras were “in respect of their frontier in the same legal situation as before 23 December 1906” (Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 198 and 199), the date of the Award.\n\n41. In its Judgment, having considered the arguments of the Parties and evidence in the case file, the Court first found that “the Parties [had] followed the procedure that had been agreed upon for submitting their respective cases” to an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the Gamez-Bonilla Treaty. Thus the designation of King Alfonso XIII as arbitrator entrusted with the task of ruling on the boundary dispute between the two Parties was valid. The Court then examined Nicaragua’s contention that the Gamez-Bonilla Treaty had lapsed before the King of Spain had agreed to act as arbitrator and found that “the Gamez-Bonilla Treaty was in force till 24 December 1906, and that the King’s acceptance on 17 October 1904 of his designation as arbitrator was well within the currency of the Treaty”.\n\n42. The Court further considered that,\n\n“having regard to the fact that the designation of the King of Spain as arbitrator was freely agreed to by Nicaragua, that no objection was taken by Nicaragua to the jurisdiction of the King of Spain as arbitrator either on the ground of irregularity in his designation as arbitrator or on the ground that the Gamez-Bonilla Treaty had lapsed even before the King of Spain had signified his acceptance of the office of arbitrator, and that Nicaragua fully participated in the arbitral proceedings before the King, it is no longer open to Nicaragua to rely on either of these contentions as furnishing a ground for the nullity of the Award” (ibid., p. 209).\n\n43. The Court then turned to Nicaragua’s allegation that the Award was “a nullity” on the grounds that it had been vitiated by (a) “excess of jurisdiction”, (b) “essential error” and (c) “lack or inadequacy of reasons in support of the conclusions arrived at by the Arbitrator”.\n\n44. The Court stated that Nicaragua “by express declaration and by conduct, recognized the Award as valid and it [was] no longer open to Nicaragua to go back upon that recognition and to challenge the validity of the Award”. Even in the absence of such recognition “the Award would, in the judgment of the Court, still have to be recognized as valid” for the following reasons.\n\nFirst, the Court was unable to uphold the claim that the King of Spain had gone beyond the authority conferred upon him. Second, the Court added that it had not been able to discover in the arguments of Nicaragua any precise indication of “essential error” which would have had the effect, as alleged by Nicaragua, “of rendering the Award a nullity”. In this regard, the Court observed that “[t]he instances of ‘essential error’ that Nicaragua [had] brought to the notice of the Court amount[ed] to no more than the evaluation of documents and of other evidence submitted\n\nto the arbitrator”. Third, the Court rejected the last ground of nullity raised by Nicaragua by concluding that\n\n“an examination of the Award show[ed] that it deal[t] in logical order and in some detail with all relevant considerations and that it contain[ed] ample reasoning and explanations in support of the con-clusions arrived at by the arbitrator” (Arbitral Award Made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 (Honduras v. Nicaragua), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1960, pp. 215 and 216).\n\n45. The Court finally dealt with the argument by Nicaragua that the Award was not capable of execution by reason of its “omissions, contra-dictions and obscurities”. In this regard, the Court noted that\n\n“In view of the clear directive in the operative clause [fixing the common boundary point on the coast of the Atlantic as the mouth of the river Segovia or Coco, where it flows out into the sea] and the explanations in support of it in the Award, the Court [did] not consider that the Award [was] incapable of execution by reason of any omissions, contradictions or obscurities.”\n\n46. In the operative part of its Judgment, the Court found that the Award made by the King of Spain on 23 December 1906 was valid and binding and that Nicaragua was under an obligation to give effect to it (ibid., p. 217).\n\n47. As Nicaragua and Honduras could not thereafter agree on how to implement the 1906 Arbitral Award, Nicaragua requested the intervention of the Inter-American Peace Committee. The Committee subsequently established a Mixed Commission which completed the demarcation of the boundary line with the placement of boundary markers in 1962. The Mixed Commission determined that the land boundary would begin at the mouth of the River Coco, at 14° 59.8′ N latitude and 83° 08.9′ W longitude.\n\n48. From 1963 to 1979, Honduras and Nicaragua generally enjoyed friendly relations. The first efforts at bilateral negotiations between the Parties on matters relating to the maritime boundary in the Caribbean were initiated at the request of Nicaragua, by means of a diplomatic Note dated 11 May 1977. In this communication addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras, the Ambassador of Nicaragua to Honduras noted that his “Government wish[ed] to initiate conversations leading to the determination of the definitive marine and sub-marine delimitation in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea zone”.\n\nBy a diplomatic Note of 20 May 1977 the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras replied that his “Government accept[ed] with pleasure the opening of negotiations” on the maritime delimitation. However these negotiations made no progress consequent upon the Sandinista revolution that toppled the Somoza Government in July 1979. In the period that followed until 1990 (when the new Nicaraguan Government of Vio- leta Chamorro was sworn into office), relations between Nicaragua and Honduras deteriorated.\n\n49. On 21 September 1979, Honduras sent a diplomatic Note to Nica-ragua stating that a Honduran fishing vessel had been attacked by Nica-ragua 8 miles north of the 15th parallel, which, according to the Hondu- ran Note, served “as the limit between Honduras and Nicaragua”. On 24 September 1979, Nicaragua sent a diplomatic Note in reply offering assurance that an urgent investigation would be carried out regarding the “capture [of a] Honduran motor fishing vessel . . . and crew by [a] Hon-duran fishing vessel . . ., being used by Nicaraguan regular forces”. The Nicaraguan Note made no mention of the assertion by Honduras that the 15th parallel served as the boundary line between the two countries.\n\n50. Nicaragua, on 19 December 1979, enacted the Continental Shelf and Adjacent Sea Act. The Preamble to that Act stated that prior to 1979,\n\n“foreign intervention [had] not permit[ted] the full exercise by the People of Nicaragua of [the nation’s] rights over the Continental Shelf and Adjacent Sea — rights which corresponded] to the Nica- raguan Nation by history, geography and International Law”.\n\nArticle 2 of the Act provided that “[t]he sovereignty and jurisdiction of Nicaragua extends over the sea adjacent to its seacoasts for 200 nautical miles”. The official map of the continental shelf of Nicaragua of 1980, and the official map of the Republic dated 1982, both included a box comprising Rosalind, Serranilla and adjacent areas up to parallel 17°.\n\n51. Honduras promulgated a new Constitution on 11 January 1982, which provided in Article 10 that, among others, the cays of Palo de Campeche and Media Luna and the banks of Salmedina, Provi- dencia, De Coral, Rosalind and Serranilla “and all others located in the Atlantic that historically, geographically and juridically belong to it” were Honduran. Article 11 of the 1982 Honduran Constitution further declared an exclusive economic zone of 200 nautical miles.\n\n52. On 23 March 1982, Honduras sent a diplomatic Note to Nicaragua with regard to an incident on 21 March 1982, involving the capture of four Honduran fishing vessels to the north of the 15th parallel by two Nicaraguan coastguard vessels, which had subsequently towed the Hon- duran fishing vessels to a Nicaraguan port, Puerto Cabezas, lying at approximately 14° N latitude. In the Note, Honduras affirmed that the 15th parallel had been traditionally recognized as the boundary line:\n\n“On Sunday the 21st of this month, two coastguard launches of the Sandinista Navy penetrated as far as Bobel and Media Luna Cays, 16 miles to the North of Parallel 15, which has been tradition-\n\nally recognised by both countries to be the dividing line in the Atlantic Ocean. In flagrant violation of our sovereignty in waters under Honduran jurisdiction, they proceeded to capture four Hon- duran fishing launches and their crews, all of Honduran nationality towing them toward Puerto Cabezas, in Nicaragua.”\n\n53. On 14 April 1982, Nicaragua sent a diplomatic Note in response to Honduras asserting that Nicaragua had never recognized any maritime boundary with Honduras in the Caribbean Sea:\n\n“Your Excellency refers in your Note that on Sunday, March 21st, two of our Coastguard ships ‘penetrated as far as Bobel and Media Luna Cays, 16 miles North of Parallel 15. This has been traditionally recognized by both countries to be the dividing line in the Atlantic.’ This affirmation, to the least, surprises us, since Nicaragua has not recognized any maritime frontier with Honduras in the Caribbean Sea, being undefined until today the maritime boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua in said sea. Nicaragua understands that in Honduras there is a criterion that aspires to establish said Parallel as the boundary line. At no time has Nicaragua recognized it as such since that would imply an attempt against the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of Nicaragua. According to the established rules of international law, territorial matters must be necessarily resolve[d] in treaties validly celebrated and in conformity with the internal dispositions of the contracting States, not having effected to date, any agreement in this regard. Therefore, Nicaragua rejects Your Excellency’s affirmation in the sense that it claims to establish Parallel 15 as the boundary line between our two countries in the Caribbean Sea.”\n\nIn the Note, Nicaragua further stated that it considered that negotiations on the delimitation in the Caribbean Sea “should be undertaken through mixed commissions” but that “[i]n the interest of avoiding frictions between [the] two countries” such discussions should be “postponed, in order to wait the adequate moment to proceed with negotiations”.\n\n54. By a diplomatic Note dated 3 May 1982, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Honduras continued the exchange by proposing that, pending a resolution of the problem, a temporary line or zone be created which would be without prejudice to the maritime rights that either State might claim in the future in the Caribbean Sea:\n\n“I agree with Your Excellency when you affirm that the maritime border between Honduras and Nicaragua has not been legally delim-ited. Despite this, it cannot be denied that there exists, or at least that there used to exist, a traditionally accepted line, which is that which corresponds to the Parallel which crosses Cape Gracias a Dios.\n\nThere is no other way of explaining why it is only since a few months ago that there have occurred, with worrying frequency, border inci-dents between our two countries.\n\nHowever, I coincide with Your Excellency that this is not the appropriate moment at which to open a discussion on maritime borders . . .\n\nFrom what both Your Excellency and my Government have expressed, it is clear that our two countries desire the maintenance of peace, and will abstain from introducing new points of controversy in the current circumstances. To this end, however, I consider it necessary to adopt some sort of criterion, albeit informal and transitional, in order to prevent incidents such as that which concerns us now. The temporary establishment of a line or zone might be considered which, without prejudice to the rights that the two States might claim in the future, could serve as a momentary indicator of their respective areas of jurisdiction. I am sure through the frank and cordial dialogue we have already started, we will be able to find a satisfactory solution for both Parties.”\n\n55. On 18 September 1982, Honduras sent a diplomatic Note to Nica-ragua protesting an attack alleged to have been initiated by Nicaragua on that day against a Honduran fishing boat near Bobel and Media Luna cays, north of the 15th parallel.\n\n56. By a diplomatic Note of 19 September 1982, Nicaragua rejected the Honduran proposal to create a temporary line or zone as set out in the Honduran Foreign Minister’s diplomatic Note of 3 May 1982 and further contested Honduras’s version of the facts concerning the attack on a fishing vessel alleged by Honduras in its Note of 18 September 1982. In particular, Nicaragua noted that\n\n“the Government of Nicaragua manifests its deep astonishment at certain affirmations stated by Your Excellency in your Note [of 18 September 1982], in relation to the jurisdictional zone in the Car-ibbean Sea. As we have pointed out in previous Notes, the maritime frontier between Honduras and Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea is not delimited nor do there exist traditional lines of jurisdiction between our two countries in that zone. This unquestionable reality was already accepted by the Republic of Honduras, in Note No. 254 DSM dated May 3 of the current year, that His Excellency, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of that country, Doctor Edgardo Paz Bar- nica, addressed to the Minister of Nicaragua, Miguel D’Escoto Brockmann, that one of its parts literally expresses: ‘I agree with Your Excellency when you affirm that the maritime frontier between Honduras and Nicaragua has not been legally delimited.'”\n\n57. On 27 June 1984, Honduras sent Nicaragua a diplomatic Note in which it protested in respect of the Nicaraguan official map of 1982 and\n\nrequested the map’s rectification. Honduras claimed that the map had wrongfully included the banks and cays of Rosalind and Serranilla which Honduras claimed pertained to it.\n\n58. Accusations and counter accusations over supposed incursions in the disputed maritime area continued throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, including during periods of bilateral negotiations. Numerous incidents involving the capture and/or attack by each State of fishing vessels belonging to the other State in the vicinity of the 15th parallel were recorded in a series of diplomatic exchanges.\n\n59. Honduras concluded a maritime boundary treaty with Colombia on 2 August 1986. On 8 September 1986, Nicaragua sent a diplomatic Note to Honduras stating that the said treaty “pretend[ed] to divide between Honduras and Colombia extensive zones that include insular territories, adjacent seas and continental shelf that historically, geographically and legally correspond to the sovereignty of Nicaragua”.\n\n60. In response, Honduras sent a diplomatic Note to Nicaragua dated 29 September 1986 stating that the treaty in question\n\n“constitutes the expression of the sovereign will of two States to establish their maritime boundary in areas over which Nicaragua does not exercise and has never exercised any jurisdiction whatsoever, given that it cannot provide .. . historical, geographical or legal grounds to support any claim that those areas belong to it”.\n\nHonduras further indicated in the same Note that it would be willing to enter into negotiations with the Nicaraguan Government with regard to the maritime delimitation.\n\n61. The Parties, through a Joint Declaration of the Foreign Ministers of Honduras and Nicaragua made on 5 September 1990, established a Mixed Commission for Maritime Affairs. According to this Joint Declaration, the purpose of the Commission was “the prevention and solution of maritime problems between both countries”. The Joint Declaration also stated that the Mixed Commission would “examine, as a priority, border issues in the maritime areas of the Gulf of Fonseca and the Atlantic coast, and the fisheries problems derived from the above”. The Mixed Commission met for the first time on 27 May 1991.\n\n62. In a further Joint Declaration of 29 November 1991, the Parties declared that it was “necessary to search for solutions consistent with the ideals for the integration of Central America”. Nicaragua contends that:\n\n“The general intent of this Joint Declaration was that Nicaragua and Honduras would not make agreements with non-Central American States that could prejudice either Party. The specific intention was that Honduras would not ratify the maritime delimitation Treaty she had concluded with Colombia in August 1986. Nicaragua for her part agreed to discontinue the case it had pending against Honduras in the [Central American] Court [of Justice].”\n\n63. The Mixed Commission for Maritime Affairs held its second meeting on 5 August 1992, and was scheduled to meet again on 7 July 1993, but that meeting was postponed. On 24 March 1995, Nicaragua proposed that the Parties seek to examine again the delimitation of maritime areas in the Caribbean Sea. The Mixed Commission for Maritime Affairs was merged on 20 April 1995 with the Commission of Boundary Cooperation to form a new Bi-national Commission, which held its first meeting on 20 April 1995 whereby it was agreed to create a sub-commission in charge of delimitation issues in the Caribbean Sea and demarcation of areas already delimited in the Gulf of Fonseca. The Sub-commission was actually established at the second meeting of the Bi-national Commission held on 15 to 16 June 1995. The Sub-commission however was unable to resolve the delimitation differences in the Caribbean Sea (its last meeting scheduled for 25 April 1997 was cancelled by mutual consent).\n\n64. On 19 April 1995 Honduras sent a diplomatic Note in protest at the capture of a Honduran fishing vessel by Nicaraguan coastguard vessels. On 5 May 1995, Nicaragua sent a diplomatic Note to Honduras in response, reiterating its claims “up to parallel 17 latitude North” that it had first advanced in a Note dated 12 December 1994. Continuing the exchange, Honduras maintained its position that the 15th parallel constituted the maritime boundary.\n\n65. By diplomatic Notes dated 18 and 27 December 1995 sent to the Nicaraguan Minister for Foreign Affairs, Honduras protested the capture of five Honduran fishing vessels and their crew on 17 December 1995 by Nicaraguan coastguards. By Notes dated 20 December 1995 and 6 January 1996, Nicaragua, referring to the seizure of only four Honduran vessels, informed the Honduran Minister for Foreign Affairs, inter alia, that it “[could] not permit the exploitation by third States of its natural resources in its legitimate national maritime areas”.\n\n66. Following these incidents, an ad hoc Commission was constituted as a result of a meeting held between the Presidents of Nicaragua and Honduras on 14 January 1996. The ad hoc Commission held a special meeting on 22 January 1996 in which both the Honduran and Nicara- guan delegations stated that the purpose was to enter into an interim agreement for a provisional common fishing zone in order to avoid the recurrence of the capture of fishing boats. The ad hoc Commission also\n\nmet on 31 January 1996. These meetings did not produce any results and were discontinued. Honduras’s proposal for a “common fishing zone . . . ‘three nautical miles to the North and three nautical miles to the South of Parallel 15° 00′ 00″ Latitude North and 82° 00’ 00″ Longitude West'” was rejected by Nicaragua. Nicaragua’s counter-proposal was for the creation of a common fishing zone between the 15th and 17th parallels, and was similarly rejected by Honduras.\n\n67. On 24 September 1997, the Parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding which allowed for the revival of bilateral negotiations on the boundary issues through the constitution of a new Mixed Commission “in order to explore possible solutions to the situations existing in the Gulf of Fonseca, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea”. Honduras states that the 1997 Mixed Commission was the last effort at bilateral negotiations between the Parties. According to Nicaragua, the\n\n“last phase of ‘negotiation’ took place on November 28, 1999, when the President of the Republic of Nicaragua was unexpectedly informed of the decision of the Honduran Government to ratify four days later the Treaty of August 2, 1986 on Maritime Delimitation with Colombia”.\n\nHonduras states that\n\n“the significance of [the 1986 Treaty between Colombia and Hondu-ras] lies in its recognition by Colombia that the maritime area to the north of the 15th parallel forms part of Honduras, and that the 82nd meridian is the appropriate terminus for the delimitation”.\n\nNicaragua claims that “[fjuture negotiations became impossible once Honduras took the step of ratifying the Treaty with Colombia”.\n\n68. Nicaragua in its pleadings informed the Court of the fact that on 29 November 1999, it filed an application instituting proceedings against Honduras as well as a request for the indication of provisional measures before the Central American Court of Justice. On 30 November 1999, the Central American Court of Justice entered the case on its docket. The present Court observes that the relevant documents in the public domain, available in Spanish on the website of the Central American Court of Justice (www.ccj.org.ni), reveal the following facts.\n\n69. In the Application, Nicaragua asked the Central American Court of Justice to declare that Honduras, by proceeding to the approval and ratification of the 1986 Treaty between Colombia and Honduras on maritime delimitation, was acting in violation of certain legal instruments of regional integration, including the Tegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American States (that Protocol entered into force on 23 July 1992). In its request for the indication of provisional measures, Nicaragua asked the Central American Court of Justice to order Honduras to abstain from approving and ratifying the 1986 Treaty, until the sovereign interests of Nicaragua in its maritime spaces, the patrimonial interests of Central America and the highest interests of the regional institutions had been “safeguarded”. By Order of 30 November 1999 the Central American Court of Justice ruled that Honduras suspend the procedure of ratification of the 1986 Treaty pending the determination of the merits in the case.\n\nHonduras and Colombia continued the ratification process and on 20 December 1999 exchanged instruments of ratification. On 7 January 2000, Nicaragua made a further request for the indication of provisional measures asking the Central American Court of Justice to declare the nullity of Honduras’s process of ratification of the 1986 Treaty. By Order of 17 January 2000, the Central American Court of Justice ruled that Honduras had not complied with its Order on provisional measures dated 30 November 1999 but considered that it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the request made by Nicaragua to declare the nullity of Hon- duras’s ratification process.\n\n70. In its judgment on the merits, on 27 November 2001 the Central American Court of Justice confirmed the existence of a “territorial pat-rimony of Central America”. The Central American Court of Justice further held that, by having ratified the 1986 Treaty between Colombia and Honduras on maritime delimitation, Honduras had infringed (“ha infringido”) a number of provisions of the Tegucigalpa Protocol to the Charter of the Organization of Central American States, which set out, inter alia, the fundamental objectives and principles of the Central American Integration System, including the concept of the “territorial patrimony of Central America”.\n\n71. Throughout the 1990s several diplomatic Notes were also exchanged with regard to the Parties’ publication of maps concerning the area in dispute. Among them was a Note of 7 April 1994 sent by the Honduran Minister for Foreign Affairs protesting Nicaragua’s circulation of an official map of Nicaragua, displaying an area denominated the “Nicaraguan Rise”. The map depicted certain banks and cays, including Serranilla, as pertaining to Nicaragua. On 14 April 1994, Nicaragua responded to Honduras’s protest at said map, stating that\n\n“[w]ithout prejudice of the rights that correspond to Nicaragua, [the Honduran Government] will have observed that the official map of the Republic of Nicaragua, clarifies most strictly and categorically, that the maritime frontiers in the Caribbean Sea have not been legally delimited”.\n\nIn 1994, Honduras published an official map of Honduras that included, among other features, Media Luna Cays, Alargado Reef, Rosalind Bank, and Serranilla Banks and Cays within the “Honduran insular possessions in the Caribbean Sea”. This publication elicited a diplomatic Note from Nicaragua dated 9 June 1995, in which it protested\n\nthe 1994 Honduran map and asserted that Nicaragua possessed insular and maritime rights in the area north of the 15th parallel.\n\n*\n\n4. Positions of the Parties: A General Overview 4.1. SUBJECT-MATTER OF THE DISPUTE\n\n72. In its Application and written pleadings Nicaragua asked the Court to determine the course of the single maritime boundary between the areas of territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone appertaining respectively to Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea. Nicaragua states that it has consistently maintained the position that its maritime boundary with Honduras in the Caribbean Sea has not been delimited. During the oral proceedings, Nicaragua also made a specific request that the Court pronounce on sovereignty over islands located in the disputed area to the north of the boundary line claimed by Honduras running along 14° 59.8′ North latitude (hereinafter, for the sake of simplicity, generally referred to as the “15th parallel”).\n\n*\n\n73. According to Honduras, there already exists in the Caribbean Sea a traditionally recognized boundary between the maritime spaces of Hon-duras and Nicaragua “which has its origins in the principle of uti possidetis juris and which is firmly rooted in the practice of both Honduras and Nicaragua and confirmed by the practice of third States”. Honduras agrees that the Court should “determine the location of a single maritime boundary” and asks the Court to trace it following the “traditional maritime boundary” along the 15th parallel “until the jurisdiction of a third State is reached”. During the oral proceedings Honduras also asked the Court to adjudge that\n\n“[t]he islands Bobel Cay, South Cay, Savanna Cay and Port Royal Cay, together with all other islands, cays, rocks, banks and reefs claimed by Nicaragua which lie north of the 15th parallel are under the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras” (for the maritime boundary line claimed respectively by each Party, see below, p. 686, sketch-map No. 2).\n\n* *\n\n4.2. Sovereignty over the Islands in the Area in Dispute\n\n*\n\n74. Nicaragua claims sovereignty over the islands and cays in the dis-puted area of the Caribbean Sea to the north of the 15th parallel, including Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and South Cay.\n\n75. Nicaragua states that none of these islands, cays and rocks were terra nullius in 1821, when Nicaragua and Honduras gained independence from the Kingdom of Spain. However, according to Nicaragua, upon independence these features were not assigned to either of the Republics. Nicaragua adds that despite extensive research into the matter it is impossible to establish the uti possidetis juris situation of 1821 in respect of the cays in dispute. Nicaragua therefore concludes that recourse must be had to “other titles” and in particular contends that, in view of the geographical proximity of the islands to the Nicaraguan coastline, it holds original title over them under the principle of adjacency.\n\n76. Nicaragua notes that as a matter of law effectivites cannot be substituted for original title. Therefore, in Nicaragua’s view, the meagre effectivites invoked by Honduras cannot displace Nicaraguan title over the islands. Furthermore, Nicaragua argues that most of the effectivites alleged by Honduras occurred after the critical date (a concept that the Court will expand upon further at paragraph 117 below), which Nicaragua gives as 1977, when Honduras accepted Nicaragua’s offer to hold negotiations on the maritime delimitation between the two countries in the Caribbean Sea. With regard to its own effectivites, Nicaragua argues that the exercise of its own sovereignty “over the maritime area in dispute including the cays, is attested to by the question of the turtle fisheries negotiations and agreements with Great Britain that began in the nineteenth century and were still ongoing in the 1960s”.\n\n77. Finally Nicaragua notes that its exercise of sovereignty and jurisdiction in the maritime area in question has been recognized by third States, and that the cartographic evidence, while not providing conclusive evidence, also supports its claim to sovereignty.\n\n*\n\n78. Honduras claims sovereignty over Bobel Cay, Savanna Cay, Port Royal Cay and South Cay, in addition to claiming title over other smaller islands and cays lying in the same area of the Caribbean Sea.\n\n79. Honduras’s primary argument is that it has an original title over the disputed islands derived from the doctrine of uti possidetis juris. Honduras concurs with Nicaragua in the belief that none of the islands and cays in dispute were terra nullius upon independence in 1821. However, according to Honduras at that date, Cape Gracias a Dios, lying along the 15th parallel, constituted the land and maritime boundary between the provinces of Honduras and Nicaragua. Thus on the basis of uti possidetis juris the islands formerly belonging to Spain north of the 15th parallel became the islands of the newly independent Republic of Honduras.\n\n80. Honduras contends that its original title to the islands north of the 15th parallel is confirmed by many effectivites. In this regard Honduras, in relation to the islands, refers to the application of Honduran public and administrative legislation and laws as well as of its criminal and civil laws, the regulation of fisheries activities and immigration, the regulation by Honduras of exploration and exploitation of oil and gas, the carrying out of military and naval patrols, search and rescue operations and the participation by Honduras in public works and scientific surveys.\n\n81. In the event that the Court finds that no State can make out a claim based on uti possidetis juris, Honduras argues that through its effectivites it has made out a superior claim compared to Nicaragua. In this regard Honduras contests Nicaragua’s claim that the most of these effectivites occurred after the critical date as claimed by Nicaragua. Honduras does not accept Nicaragua’s alleged critical date of 1977, but notes that in any event many of the acts of sovereignty over the disputed islands which it describes occurred before that date. Honduras argues that the critical date cannot be earlier than 21 March 2001, the date when Nicaragua filed its Memorial asserting for the first time that Nicaragua had title to the islands.\n\n82. Finally, Honduras adds that a number of third States have recognized Honduran sovereignty over the islands, and that the cartographic evidence, while not of itself dispositive, supports Honduras’s claim to sovereignty.\n\n* *\n\n4.3. Maritime Delimitation beyond the Territorial Sea 4.3.1. Nicaragua’s line: bisector method\n\n83. In its legal argument, Nicaragua begins with the delimitation of maritime areas beyond the territorial sea. In the circumstances of the case, Nicaragua proposes a method of delimitation consisting of “the bisector of the angle produced by constructing lines based upon the respective coastal frontages and producing extensions of these lines”. Such a bisector is calculated from the general direction of the Nicaraguan coast and the general direction of the Honduran coast. These coastal fronts generate a bisector which runs from the mouth of the River Coco as a line of constant bearing (azimuth 52° 45′ 21″) until intersecting with the boundary of a third State in the vicinity of Rosalind Bank.\n\n84. Nicaragua also states that “[b]ecause of the particular characteristics of the area in which the land boundary intersects with the coast, and for other reasons, the technical method of equidistance is not feasible” for the maritime delimitation between Nicaragua and Honduras. In particular Nicaragua refers to the fact that “the exact location where the land boundary ends is like the points of protruding needles” resulting in\n\na “pronounced turn in the direction of the coast precisely on the boundary line”. Nicaragua argues that as a result of this geographical feature\n\n“the only two points that would dominate any delimitation based on median line or equidistance calculations are the two margins of the River. This remains the same even at a distance of 200 nautical miles\n\nif only the mainland coast is used.”\n\n*\n\n85. Honduras asserts that Nicaragua’s proposed bisector method “is based on a flawed assessment of coastal fronts and delimitation methods”. The Atlantic coast of Nicaragua is relatively linear, runs “slightly west of south” all the way from Cape Gracias a Dios to Costa Rica and faces overall “slightly south of east”. Thus there is no justification based on the configuration of Nicaragua’s coast for the Nicaraguan bisector line running north-east. According to Honduras, Nicaragua’s angle is supposed to have been constructed by taking account of the coastal directions of the Parties. However as the two coasts are treated by Nicaragua as straight lines the angle created bears no relationship to the actual coasts.\n\n*\n\n4.3.2. Honduras’s line: “traditional boundary” along the parallel 14°59.8′ North latitude (“the 15th parallel”)\n\n86. Honduras asks the Court to confirm what it claims is a traditional maritime boundary running along the 15th parallel between Honduras and Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea and to continue that existing line until the jurisdiction of a third State is reached. According to Honduras this traditional line has its historical basis in the principle of uti possidetis juris. Honduras contends that upon independence in 1821 there was a maritime jurisdiction division aligned along the 15th parallel out to at least 6 nautical miles from Cape Gracias a Dios.\n\n87. Honduras further claims that the Parties’ conduct since independ-ence demonstrates the existence of a tacit agreement that the 15th parallel has long been treated as the line dividing their maritime spaces. Honduras states that conduct in relation to the disputed islands and the maritime boundary are closely connected. Many of the acts expressing sovereignty over the islands also constitute conduct recognizing the 15th parallel as the maritime boundary. In this regard Honduras places particular emphasis on oil concessions, fisheries licences and naval patrols which, it contends, provide ample proof of the acceptance by the Parties of the traditional boundary line offshore.\n\n88. Honduras states that it was only in 1979, with the change in gov-ernment in Nicaragua, that the “position and conduct of Nicaragua in relation to the establishment of the 15th parallel as the maritime boundary between the two States changed radically”. Thus the critical date for the start of the controversy, in terms of the dispute between the Parties over the delimitation of their respective maritime spaces, cannot be before 1979. Honduras furthermore notes that in any event many of its examples of conduct occurred prior to that date.\n\n89. Honduras also refers to the practice of the Parties as reflected in their diplomatic exchanges, their legislation and their cartography to demonstrate the mutually acknowledged existence of a traditional maritime boundary along the 15th parallel. In addition Honduras claims that the 15th parallel has been recognized as such a boundary by third States and international organizations.\n\n90. While contending that the 15th parallel is a traditional line based on uti possidetis juris and confirmed by the subsequent conduct of the Parties showing their common acceptance of this line, Honduras also seeks to show that its line is in any event equitable in character. It compares it with the equidistance line of delimitation “constructed using standard methods”, which, according to Honduras runs to the south of the 15th parallel. Honduras claims that Nicaragua would gain more maritime space with the “traditional line” than it would achieve by strict application of the equidistance line. Honduras further argues that the Honduran line does not cut-off the projection of the coastal front of Nicaragua and respects the principle of non-encroachment.\n\n91. Were its contentions as to the 15th parallel not to be accepted by the Court, Honduras asks alternatively that the Court trace an adjusted equidistance line, until the jurisdiction of a third State is reached. Honduras maintains that the construction of a provisional equidistance line is possible and that there is therefore no reason to depart from “the practice almost universally adopted in the modern jurisprudence, both of this Court and of other tribunals, that is to begin with a provisional equidis- tance line”.\n\n*\n\n92. Nicaragua contends that it has consistently held that the maritime spaces between the two States in the Caribbean Sea have not been delim-ited.\n\n93. Nicaragua asserts that there is “no uti possidetis juris of 1821 that attributes or delimits maritime areas” between the two States and that\n\nthere are no Honduran acts of sovereignty or effectivites to support the contention that a traditional line exists along the 15th parallel. In particular, Nicaragua maintains that\n\n“the concept of uti possidetis that was used to determine the bounda-ries of the administrative divisions of the colonial power that were considered to be frozen in place at the moment of independence had nothing to do with maritime matters”.\n\n94. Nicaragua further states that there “is no line dividing the maritime areas of Nicaragua and Honduras based on a tacit agreement or any form of acquiescence or recognition whatever resulting from long-established and consistent practice”.\n\n95. With regard to the maritime spaces Nicaragua focuses on three ele-ments representing alleged effectivites by Honduras — oil exploration concessions, fisheries activities and naval patrols. First, Nicaragua argues that the limits of oil concessions are not relevant to fixing a boundary between two States. Moreover,\n\n“none of the Honduran concessions states that its southern limit coincides with the maritime boundary with Nicaragua. Similarly, none of the Nicaraguan concessions defining a northern limit specifies that the limit coincides with the maritime boundary with Honduras.”\n\nSecond, according to Nicaragua neither the witness statements nor fishing licences produced by Honduras nor the FAO fisheries reports can be considered as a confirmation of the existence of a “traditional boundary” or as evidence of Nicaragua’s consent to such a boundary. Third, with regard to the naval patrols, Nicaragua notes that as a matter of law, naval or air patrols on the high seas cannot be equated to an effectivite. Nicaragua notes furthermore that many of these supposed effectivites took place after the critical date, which it gives as 1977.\n\n96. As to the diplomatic exchanges between the Parties, Nicaragua maintains that “the Honduran claim that the 15th Parallel is the boundary of maritime areas with Nicaragua was not made formally until 1982” and was immediately rejected by Nicaragua. Nicaragua argues that Honduras has not presented any evidence that in the period prior to 1977 the Parties acquiesced to the existence of a traditional maritime boundary or that there were Honduran claims to the areas in question. On the contrary, there have been countless occasions in the context of diplomatic exchanges when Nicaragua has reaffirmed that there is no maritime boundary in the Caribbean Sea that is based on tradition or on any tacit acceptance by Nicaragua.\n\n97. For the cartographic evidence, Nicaragua asserts that none of the maps published in Nicaragua and reproduced by Honduras indicate that a maritime boundary runs along the 15th parallel. With regard to the claim that Nicaragua failed to protest against certain official maps produced by Honduras, Nicaragua comments that the absence of protest in regard to these maps is irrelevant due to the fact that the maps have no evidentiary value.\n\n98. Nicaragua contends that, given the significant change in the direction of the coast, the boundary line which follows a parallel of latitude “is essentially inequitable” and “transgresses the primary equitable principle prohibiting the cutting-off of a state, in this case Nicaragua, from the continental shelf or exclusive economic zone lying in front of its coasts”. Moreover, there is “a glaring disproportion between the maritime spaces that Honduras attributes to herself and those she considers to be Nicaraguan, bounded by the parallel of 15° N”. Nicaragua concludes that the overall result is “grossly inequitable in terms of the law of maritime delimitation”.\n\n*\n\n4.4. Starting-point of the Maritime Boundary\n\n99. Nicaragua recalls that the terminus of the land boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras was established by the 1906 Arbitral Award at the mouth of the principal arm of the River Coco (see paragraph 38 above). In 1962 the Mixed Boundary Commission determined that the starting-point of the land boundary at the mouth of the River Coco was situated at 14° 59.8′ North latitude and 83° 08.9′ West longitude (see paragraph 47 above). Nicaragua further states that since 1962 the mouth of the River Coco has moved more than 1 mile north and east due to the accretion of sediments and the trend of marine streams. As a result, the point plotted by the Commission is today located approximately 1 mile landwards from the actual mouth of the River Coco. According to Nica-ragua the instability and fluctuations of the river mouth will continue in the “predictable future” and will lead to changes in the co-ordinates of the terminus of the land boundary. It thus proposes that the starting- point of the maritime boundary be set “at a prudent distance”, namely 3 nautical miles out at sea from the actual mouth of the River Coco on the bisector line.\n\n100. Nicaragua initially suggested that the Parties would have to nego-tiate “a line representing the boundary between the point of departure of the boundary at the mouth of the River Coco and the point of departure from which the Court will have determined the [maritime] boundary line”. While leaving that proposal open, Nicaragua, in its final submissions, asked the Court to confirm that: “The starting-point of the delimitation is the thalweg of the main mouth of the River Coco such as it may\n\nbe at any given moment as determined by the Award of the King of Spain of 1906.”\n\n*\n\n101. Honduras agrees that the terminal point of the land boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua fixed by the Mixed Commission in 1962, due to “the gradual movement eastwards of the actual mouth of the River Coco”, “now lies well inside what would now be described as the ‘mouth’ in geographical terms”. The instability of the mouth of the River Coco, “identified as the endpoint of the boundary” by the 1906 Award, according to Honduras, makes it undesirable to ask the Court “to determine either the location of the mouth of the river, or even the starting-point of the line immediately east of that point”. While initially suggesting that the Court should be requested to “begin the line only at the outer limit of territorial waters”, Honduras then, “seeking to minimise the point of difference with Nicaragua”, accepted a starting- point of the boundary “at 3 miles from the terminal point adopted in 1962, rather than 12 miles from the coast, as proposed in the Counter- Memorial”. However Honduras argues that the seaward fixed point should be measured from the point established by the 1962 Mixed Commission and located on the 15th parallel. The seaward fixed point should accordingly be established precisely 3 nautical miles due east from the 1962 point. Honduras also states that the Parties should negotiate an agreement covering the distance from the 1962 terminus point up to the 3-mile point seaward of the mouth of the River Coco.\n\n4.5. Delimitation of the Territorial Sea\n\n102. Nicaragua states that the delimitation of the territorial sea between States with adjacent coasts must be effected on the basis of the principles set out in Article 15 of UNCLOS. In the view of Nicaragua, in the present case however it is technically impossible to draw an equidis- tance line because it would have to be entirely drawn on the basis of the two outermost points of the mouth of the river, which are extremely unstable and continuously change position. Thus, according to Nicaragua, the bisector line should also be used for the delimitation of the territorial sea. Moreover, the bisector line in the territorial sea does not vary significantly from the “mean” equidistance line. Lastly, the segment of the line between the present terminus of the land boundary and the offshore point fixed 3 miles from the mouth of the River Coco, “allows for a harmonious, flexible and adjustable connection between the ‘single line of delimitation’ and [the endpoint of the land boundary]”.\n\n103. With regard to the boundary of the territorial sea, Honduras agrees with Nicaragua that there are “special circumstances” which, under Article 15 of UNCLOS “require a delimitation by a line other than a strict median line”. However, according to Honduras, while the configuration of the continental landmass may be one such “special circumstance”, of far greater significance “is the established practice of the Parties in treating the 15th parallel as their boundary from the mouth of the River Coco (14° 59.8′)”. Honduras also identifies as a factor of “the greatest significance … the gradual movement eastwards of the actual mouth of the River Coco”. Honduras therefore suggests that from the fixed seaward starting-point (3 miles due east from the point fixed by the Mixed Commission in 1962) the maritime boundary in the territorial sea (just as for the areas of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf) should follow in an eastward direction the 15th parallel.\n\n*\n\n5. Admissibility of the New Claim relating to Sovereignty over the Islands in the Area in Dispute\n\n104. The Court recalls that in its Application, Nicaragua requested the Court to determine\n\n“the course of the single maritime boundary between the areas of territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone apper-taining respectively to Nicaragua and Honduras, in accordance with equitable principles and relevant circumstances recognized by general international law as applicable to such a delimitation of a single maritime boundary”.\n\nThe Government of Nicaragua further reserved its “right to supplement or to amend” the Application.\n\n105. In its Memorial, Nicaragua, while not putting forward a claim of sovereignty as a formal submission,\n\n“reserve[d] [its] sovereign rights appurtenant to all the islets and rocks claimed by Nicaragua in the disputed area. The islets and rocks concerned include but are not confined to the following:\n\nHall Rock, South Cay, Arrecife Alargado, Bobel Cay, Port Royal Cay, Porpoise Cay, Savanna Cay, Savanna Reefs, Cayo Media Luna, Burn Cay, Logwood Cay, Cock Rock, Arrecifes de la Media Luna, and Cayo Serranilla”.\n\n106. During the first round of the oral proceedings the Agent of Nica-ragua declared that\n\n“so that there is no possible misunderstanding on this point — that\n\nis, whether the issue of sovereignty over these features [i.e. the islands in the disputed area] is in question — then as of this moment Nicaragua wishes to anticipate that in its final submissions at the end of these oral pleadings it will specifically request a decision on the question of sovereignty over these features”.\n\n107. In its final submissions at the end of the oral proceedings, Nica-ragua requested the Court, without prejudice to the line of the single maritime boundary “as described in the pleadings”, “to decide the question of sovereignty over the islands and cays within the area in dispute”.\n\n108. The Court notes that\n\n“[t]here is no doubt that it is for the Applicant, in its Application, to present to the Court the dispute with which it wishes to seise the Court and to set out the claims which it is submitting to it” (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 447, para. 29).\n\nArticle 40, paragraph 1, of the Statute of the Court requires moreover that the “subject of the dispute” be indicated in the Application; and Article 38, paragraph 2, of the Rules of Court requires “the precise nature of the claim” to be specified in the Application. In a number of instances in the past the Court has had occasion to refer to these provisions. It has characterized them as “essential from the point of view of legal security and the good administration of justice” and, on this basis, the Court held inadmissible certain new claims, formulated during the course of proceedings, which, if they had been entertained, would have transformed the subject of the dispute originally brought before it under the terms of the Application (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 267, para. 69; Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada), Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, p. 447, para. 29; see also Prince von Pless Administration, Order of 4 February 1933, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 52, p. 14, and Societe Commerciale de Belgique, Judgment, 1939, P.C.I.J., Series A/B, No. 78, p. 173).\n\n109. The Court observes that, from a formal point of view, the claim relating to sovereignty over the islands in the maritime area in dispute, as presented in the final submissions of Nicaragua, is a new claim in relation to the claims presented in the Application and in the written pleadings.\n\n110. However, the mere fact that a claim is new is not in itself decisive for the issue of admissibility. In order to determine whether a new claim introduced during the course of the proceedings is admissible the Court will need to consider whether,\n\n“although formally a new claim, the claim in question can be considered as included in the original claim in substance” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, pp. 265-266, para. 65).\n\nFor this purpose, to find that the new claim, as a matter of substance, has been included in the original claim, it is not sufficient that there should be links between them of a general nature. Moreover,\n\n“[a]n additional claim must have been implicit in the application (Temple of Preah Vihear, Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 36) or must arise ‘directly out of the question which is the subject- matter of that Application’ (Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 203, para. 72)” (Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v. Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1992, p. 266, para. 67).\n\n111. The Court will now consider whether Nicaragua’s new claim relating to sovereignty over the islands in the area in dispute is admissible in light of the above criteria.\n\n112. The maritime area in the Caribbean Sea to be delimited comprises a number of islands which may generate territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and a number of rocks which may generate territorial sea. Both Parties have agreed that none of the land features in the maritime area in dispute can be regarded as terra nullius, but each has asserted its own sovereignty over them. According to Nicaragua, by using a bisector as a method of delimitation, sovereignty over these features could be attributed to either Party depending on the position of the feature involved with respect to the bisector line.\n\n113. On a number of occasions, the Court has emphasized that\n\n“the land dominates the sea” (North Sea Continental Shelf (Federal Republic of Germany/Denmark; Federal Republic of Germany/Neth-erlands), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1969, p. 51, para. 96; Aegean Sea Continental Shelf (Greece v. Turkey), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1978, p. 36, para. 86; Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 97, para. 185).\n\nAccordingly, it is\n\n“the terrestrial territorial situation that must be taken as starting point for the determination of the maritime rights of a coastal State. In accordance with Article 121, paragraph 2, of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which reflects customary international law, islands, regardless of their size, in this respect enjoy the same status, and therefore generate the same maritime rights, as other land terri-tory.” (Maritime Delimitation and Territorial Questions between Qatar and Bahrain (Qatar v. Bahrain), Merits, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2001, p. 97, para. 185.)\n\n114. To draw a single maritime boundary line in an area of the Car-ibbean Sea where a number of islands and rocks are located the Court would have to consider what influence these maritime features might have on the course of that line. To plot that line the Court would first have to determine which State has sovereignty over the islands and rocks in the disputed area. The Court is bound to do so whether or not a formal claim has been made in this respect. Thus the claim relating to sovereignty is implicit in and arises directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of Nicaragua’s Application, namely the delimitation of the disputed areas of the territorial sea, continental shelf and exclusive economic zone.\n\n115. In the light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that the Nica- raguan claim relating to sovereignty over the islands in the maritime area in dispute is admissible as it is inherent in the original claim relating to the maritime delimitation between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Caribbean Sea.\n\n116. In addition, the Court notes that the Respondent has contested neither the jurisdiction of the Court to entertain the Nicaraguan new claim regarding the islands, nor its admissibility. Moreover, Honduras, for its part, observed that the new Nicaraguan claim made “the nature of the task facing the Court” clearer so that the Court “is asked to decide both on title to the islands and on the maritime delimitation”. Honduras further added that as the Court was faced with a dispute over land and maritime spaces, it “must resolve the question of sovereignty over the land before it turns to the maritime boundary” (emphasis in the original). In its final submissions Honduras asked the Court to adjudge and declare that:\n\n“The islands Bobel Cay, South Cay, Savanna Cay and Port Royal Cay, together with all other islands, cays, rocks, banks and reefs claimed by Nicaragua which lie north of the 15th parallel are under the sovereignty of the Republic of Honduras.”\n\nIt is for the Court therefore to rule on the claims of the two Parties with respect to the islands in dispute.\n\n*\n\n* *\n\n6. The Critical Date\n\n117. In the context of a maritime delimitation dispute or of a dispute related to sovereignty over land, the significance of a critical date lies in distinguishing between those acts performed a titre de souverain which are in principle relevant for the purpose of assessing and validating effectivites, and those acts occurring after such critical date, which are in general meaningless for that purpose, having been carried out by a State which, already having claims to assert in a legal dispute, could have taken those actions strictly with the aim of buttressing those claims. Thus a critical date will be the dividing line after which the Parties’ acts become irrelevant for the purposes of assessing the value of effectivites. As the Court explained in the Indonesia/Malaysia case,\n\n“it cannot take into consideration acts having taken place after the date on which the dispute between the Parties crystallized unless such acts are a normal continuation of prior acts and are not undertaken for the purpose of improving the legal position of the Party which relies on them” (Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002, p. 682, para. 135).\n\n*\n\n118. Honduras contends that there are two disputes, albeit related: one as to whether Nicaragua or Honduras has title to the disputed islands; and the other as to whether the 15th parallel represents the current maritime frontier between the Parties. Nicaragua perceives it as a single dispute.\n\n119. Honduras observes that in respect of the dispute concerning sov-ereignty over the maritime features in the disputed area there “may be more than one critical date”. Thus, “[t]o the extent that the issue of title turns on the application of uti possidetis”, the critical date would be 1821 — the date of independence of Honduras and Nicaragua from Spain. For the purposes of post-colonial effectivites, Honduras argues that the critical date “is obviously much later” and cannot be “earlier than the date of the filing of the Memorial — 21 March 2001 — since this was the first time that Nicaragua asserted that it had title to the islands”.\n\n120. With regard to the dispute over the maritime boundary, Honduras maintains that 1979, when the Sandinista Government came to power, constitutes the critical date, as up to that date “Nicaragua never showed the slightest interest in the cays and islands north of the 15th parallel”. According to Honduras, once in power in 1979 the new Government launched “a campaign of prolonged harassment against Honduran fishing vessels north of the 15th parallel”.\n\n121. For Nicaragua, the critical date is 1977, when the Parties initiated negotiations on maritime delimitation, following an exchange of letters by the two Governments. Nicaragua asserts that the dispute over the maritime boundary, by implication, encompasses the dispute over the islands within the relevant area and therefore the critical date for both disputes coincides.\n\n122. Honduras dismisses Nicaragua’s alleged critical date of 1977 for the purposes of the dispute over the islands, since the diplomatic corre-\n\nspondence exchanged by the two countries makes no mention of those maritime features. Honduras further argues that the 1977 exchange of let-ters, and Honduras’s acceptance of the invitation “to initiate conversations leading to a definitive marine and sub-marine delimitation between Nicaragua and Honduras in the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea zones” did not mark the “crystallization of any dispute as no conflicting claims were raised at that time”.\n\n*\n\n123. The Court considers that in cases where there exist two interrelated disputes, as in the present case, there is not necessarily a single critical date and that date may be different in the two disputes. For these reasons, the Court finds it necessary to distinguish two different critical dates which are to be applied to two different circumstances. One critical date concerns the attribution of sovereignty over the islands to one of the two contending States. The other critical date is related to the issue of delimitation of the disputed maritime area.\n\n124. Rule by the Spanish Crown ended in 1821. An issue before the Court is any applicability of the uti possidetis juris principle to title to the islands and also to the establishment of a maritime boundary. This issue will be addressed, by reference to the specific circumstances of the present case, in sections 7.2 and 8.1.1. In the absence of any title based on the uti possidetis juris principle, the Court will seek to establish an alternative title to the islands arising out of effectivites in the post-colonial era. It will also seek to ascertain whether there existed a tacit agreement as to the maritime boundary during the same period. For these purposes, it will be necessary to determine critical dates by reference to the moment at which the two disputes crystallized.\n\n125. It would be unfounded to set 1906 as the critical date on the basis that it was that year that the King of Spain delivered his Arbitral Award. It must be remembered that the Award dealt only with the land boundary between Nicaragua and Honduras. In contrast, the Court is called upon in the present case to delimit the maritime boundary between those two countries and to determine the sovereignty over the islands in dispute.\n\n126. The Court reiterates that maritime rights derive from the coastal State’s sovereignty over the land, a principle which can be summarized as “the land dominates the sea” (see paragraph 113 above). Following this approach, sovereignty over the islands needs to be determined prior to and independently from maritime delimitation.\n\n127. As regards title to the islands in question, at the time of filing its Application, Nicaragua did not make to the Court any claim of title to the islands north of the 15th parallel. It was only in its Memorial of 21 March 2001 that Nicaragua for the first time made reference to the islands, without providing any basis for a legal claim, stating only that, “[i]n the absence of the adoption of a bisector delimitation by the Court, Nicaragua reserves the sovereign rights appurtenant to all the islets and rocks claimed by Nicaragua in the disputed area”. Yet in the submissions contained in the Nicaraguan Memorial, there is no claim to the islands in dispute. The same is true in the case of the submissions in the Nicaraguan Reply. It is only in its final submissions, at the end of the oral proceedings, that Nicaragua asks the Court “to decide the question of sovereignty over the islands and cays within the area in dispute”.\n\n128. The question of the admissibility of this lat"
