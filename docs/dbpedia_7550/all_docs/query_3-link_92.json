        "text": "Know the Land\n\nWhat is a Land Acknowledgment?\n\nA Land Acknowledgement is a formal statement that recognizes and respects Indigenous Peoples as traditional stewards of this land and the enduring relationship that exists between Indigenous Peoples and their traditional territories. Hear what it means to members of the Native American and Indigenous Peoples Steering Group at Northwestern here.\n\nWhy do we recognize the land?\n\nTo recognize the land is an expression of gratitude and appreciation to those whose territory you reside on, and a way of honoring the Indigenous people who have been living and working on the land from time immemorial. It is important to understand the long standing history that has brought you to reside on the land, and to seek to understand your place within that history. Land acknowledgements do not exist in a past tense, or historical context: colonialism is a current ongoing process, and we need to build our mindfulness of our present participation. It is also worth noting that acknowledging the land is Indigenous protocol.\n\n– Laurier Students' Public Interest Research Group, Know the Land, http://www.lspirg.org/knowtheland\n\nOther Resources\n\nTerritory Acknowledgement\n\nNative Land Digital\n\nBeyond Territorial Acknowledgements\n\nChelsea Vowel\n\nAre you planning to do a land acknowledgement?\n\nDr. Debbie Reese\n\nWhat is xučyun (Huichin)?\n\nxučyun (Huichin) is the home territory that Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people, it extends from what we know today as the Berkeley hills to the Bay Shore, from West Oakland to El Cerrito. The territory is composed of what we know today as five Bay Area cities - all of Alameda, Berkeley, Emeryville, El Cerrito, and most of Oakland.\n\nOur campus extends to areas of xučyun that held a tuppentak (a traditional roundhouse), a place of celebration and ceremony, as well as a shellmound, traditional Ohlone burial sites. So as we view Berkeley as a special place, we were not the first to recognize, make our lives in, or celebrate the unique and exceptional place that we have the privilege to stand on.\n\nMuwekma Ohlone\n\nThe present-day Muwekma Ohlone Tribe is comprised of surviving American Indian lineages aboriginal to the San Francisco Bay region who trace their ancestry through the Missions Dolores, Santa Clara, and San Jose; and who were also members of the historic Federally Recognized Verona Band of Alameda County. The homeland of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe includes the following counties: San Francisco, San Mateo, most of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, and portions of Napa, Santa Cruz, Solano, and San Joaquin.\n\nThe tribal governement represents more than five hundred members who are descendants of the Verona Band. The Verona Band of Mission Indians was never terminated by the US government, they were simply dropped from the rolls, and Muwekma is seeking to become a federally recognized tribe today.\n\nClick here for the Muwekma website"
