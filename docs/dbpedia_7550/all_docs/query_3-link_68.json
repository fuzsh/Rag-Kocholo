        "text": "Where has Zika been found?\n\nZika geographic risk classifications (as of May 15, 2024)1-4\n\n1 Legend descriptions:\n\nCurrent or past Zika transmission: These countries have a potential risk of Zika transmission, but CDC may not have accurate information on the current level of risk. As a result, detection and reporting of new outbreaks may be delayed.\n\nKnown to have mosquito that spreads Zika, but no reported Zika cases: Because Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (the mosquitoes that most commonly spread Zika) are present in these countries, Zika has the potential to be present, along with other mosquito-borne infections. Detection and reporting of cases and outbreaks may be delayed.\n\nNot known to have mosquito that spreads Zika: No Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (the mosquitoes that most commonly spread Zika) have been reported in these countries. However, other Aedes species mosquitoes have been known to spread Zika, and these may be present.\n\n2Does not include countries or territories where only imported cases have been documented. Small island nations might not display on the map but data are included in the table above.\n\n3Current or past transmission is defined as having had locally acquired, mosquito-borne Zika cases. Some countries with temporally and geographically limited Zika virus transmission in the past may be classified as having no reported cases if they meet the following criteria: 1) had no confirmed locally acquired Zika virus disease cases for 12 months; 2) are located in a subtropic or temperate climate; and 3) have a comprehensive arboviral surveillance system, high capacity for diagnostic testing and consistent timely reporting of diagnostic results. Countries in this category are the United States and France (Note: only Aedes albopictus present in France)."
