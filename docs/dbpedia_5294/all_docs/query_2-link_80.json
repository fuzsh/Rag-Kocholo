        "text": "Photo by Hristo Shindov\n\nPowerviolence collective NAILS continue their campaign towards towards the band's fourth full length album set to land August 30th via Nuclear Blast Records.\n\nEvery Bridge Burning serves as NAILS' first studio album release in eight years and the first with the reconfigured line-up of drummer Carlos Cruz of Warbringer, bassist Andrew Solis of Despise You and Apparition and guitarist Shelby Lermo of Ulthar.\n\nLed by NAILS founder, frontman and architect Todd Jones, the latest from NAILS finds the band building on their brand of sonic brutality, complimented by the skillful supervision of celebrated producer Kurt Ballou at God Head Studios.\n\nIntroducing the project, NAILS shared the blistering first single earlier this summer with \"Imposing Will\" - a sub 90-second onslaught unloading metallic relentlessness, strengthened by the audacious vocals of Todd Jones out front.\n\nLast month the band dropped a second showing from the full length with a 3-minute firebomb in, \"Give Me the Painkiller\". A furious tailwhip of blackened thrash, the blistering second preview further asserted NAILS is not only back, but more bombastic than ever.\n\nFor the third preview from the album, NAILS flex the versatility of their musical assault with the groove-laden slobberknocker, \"Lacking The Ability To Process Empathy\". Showcasing varying styles of equally devastating heft, the latest single emphasizes the band's ability as songwriters and extreme music craftsmen.\n\n“This band was modeled after some of my favorite bands; the type of bands where, when they put out an album, you know what it’s going to sound like,” describes frontman Todd Jones, “it’s the delivery of the expectation.”\n\nAlong with the arrival of Every Bridge Burning, NAILS is also set to perform a stretch of live dates following the release of the album. In addition to dates with the likes of 200 Stab Wounds and Xibalba, NAILS will be featured at this year's New England Metal & Hardcore Festival along with a trek overseas with an appearance at Damnation Festival in Manchester, UK. The current list of dates can be found below."
