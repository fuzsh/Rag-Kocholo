        "text": "Nuclear Blast is an independent record label and mail order record distributor with subsidiaries in Germany, the United States and Brazil. The record label was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger in Germany. Originally releasing hardcore punk records, the label moved on to releasing albums by melodic death metal, grindcore, power metal and black metal bands, as well as tribute albums. Nuclear Blast is widely respected as the top label for the death metal scene, along with fellow non-RIAA label Century Media. The label's main office is in Donzdorf, Göppingen. Nuclear Blast America and Century Media work together as a strategic partnership between the two independent metal labels. They are distributed through Caroline/EMI.\n\nMusic[]\n\nAt their inception, Nuclear Blast focused on releasing hardcore records by bands like Agnostic Front, Attitude and Stark Raving Mad. They progressed toward metal in 1990, however, currently signing and distributing dozens of artists such as Dimmu Borgir and Hypocrisy. They have also released a series of compilation albums called \"Death Is Just the Beginning\".\n\nHistory[]\n\nNuclear Blast was formed in 1987 after founder Markus Staiger travelled throughout the United States for four weeks and saw a gig of his favorite band BL'AST!. The label was originally titled simply \"Blast\", but this was soon changed to Nuclear Blast. The label's first release was a vinyl compilation called Senseless Death (NB 001) featuring US Hardcore bands like Attitude, Sacred Denial, Impulse Manslaughter and others. The first edition of 1000 copies was sold out after one year.\n\nNuclear Blast started signing grindcore acts after Staiger discovered Las Vegas' Righteous Pigs. This followed with releases by Atrocity, Deathstars, Master and (Incubus) Opprobrium, which all sold over 30,000 copies. The grindcore explosion is considered a landmark in the label's history, gaining it worldwide attention which of course is just an opinion.\n\nIn the early nineties, black metal became highly popular in the European underground, and Nuclear Blast signed many bands. Many of them, such as Dimmu Borgir and Dissection, are still signed to Nuclear Blast. The black metal trend became increasingly popular, and by 1996, several Nuclear Blast-signed artists were entering European charts. By the end of 1997, Nuclear Blast had 20 employees and mailed out a 100 page catalogue quarterly to 50 countries.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, they expanded into a direction of power metal, promoting bands such as HammerFall and the German power metal innovators Helloween. During the 2000s, Nuclear Blast started promoting some Finnish bands, such as Stratovarius and Sonata Arctica, and the German band Blind Guardian, expanding their style further into different subgenres of metal.\n\nSwedish band Meshuggah became the first band in the history of Nuclear Blast Records to crack the Billboard 200, landing at #165 with their 2002 album, Nothing. Meshuggah also became the first Nuclear Blast band to be reviewed in Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nA[]\n\nAbomination\n\n100 Demons\n\nAccept\n\nAfter Forever\n\nAgathodaimon\n\nAgnostic Front\n\nAlkemyst\n\nAll Shall Perish\n\nAll Shall Heaven Shadow\n\nAm I Blood\n\nAmorphis\n\nAngelzoom\n\nAnnotations of an Autopsy (outside UK only)\n\nApocalyptica (United States only)\n\nArsis\n\nAudiobook\n\nAvantasia\n\nB[]\n\nBal-Sagoth\n\nBarcode\n\nBehemoth\n\nBelphegor\n\nBenediction\n\nBiohazard\n\nBlackguard (Europe only)\n\nBleed the Sky\n\nBleeding Through (Europe only)\n\nBlind Guardian\n\nBludgeon\n\nBrutality\n\nBefore the Dawn\n\nBullet\n\nC[]\n\nCallejon\n\nCandlemass\n\nCathedral\n\nChildren of Bodom\n\nChimaira (outside the U.S.)\n\nCipher System\n\nChrome Division\n\nClawfinger\n\nColdseed\n\nCommunic\n\nCondemned\n\nControl Denied\n\nCrack Up\n\nCradle of Filth\n\nCrematory\n\nCrystal Ball\n\nD[]\n\nDarkane\n\nDarkseed\n\nDavid Shankle Group\n\nDeath\n\nDeath Angel\n\nDeathstars\n\nDeathstrike\n\nDecapitated\n\nDecrepit Birth\n\nThe Defaced\n\nDefecation\n\nDemonoid\n\nThe Destiny Program\n\nDestruction\n\nDew-Scented\n\nDie Apokalyptischen Reiter\n\nDimmu Borgir\n\nDisbelief\n\nDisharmonic Orchestra\n\nDismal Euphony\n\nDismember\n\nDissection\n\nDivinity\n\nDreadful Shadows (U.S.A. only)\n\nE[]\n\nEchoes of Eternity\n\nEdguy\n\nEktomorf\n\nEluveitie\n\nEmperor\n\nEpica\n\nEquilibrium\n\nEver Eve\n\nEvidence One\n\nEx Deo\n\nExodus\n\nF[]\n\nFace Down\n\nFarmer Boys\n\nFilter\n\nFinal Breath\n\nFireball Ministry\n\nFailed Creation\n\nFleshgod Apocalypse\n\nG[]\n\nGardenian\n\nGodgory\n\nGolem\n\nGorefest\n\nGorgoroth\n\nGotthard\n\nGrave Digger\n\nGraveworm\n\nGraveyard\n\nH[]\n\nHackneyed\n\nHammerFall\n\nHardcore Superstar\n\nHellfueled\n\nHelloween\n\nHelltrain\n\nHollow\n\nHorde\n\nHypocrisy\n\nI[]\n\nI\n\nIlluminate\n\nImmortal\n\nImperanon\n\nImpulse Manslaughter\n\nIn Flames recently signed to Century Media\n\nImmolation\n\nIndica\n\nK[]\n\nKataklysm\n\nKeep of Kalessin\n\nKnorkator\n\nKolossus\n\nKorpiklaani\n\nThe Kovenant\n\nKreator\n\nL[]\n\nLacrimosa (United States only)\n\nLiquido\n\nLock Up\n\nLordi\n\nLost Souls\n\nM[]\n\nM.O.D\n\nMadball\n\nMadrigal\n\nMalevolent Creation\n\nMandragora Scream\n\nManowar\n\nMantic Ritual\n\nMaster\n\nMelechesh\n\nMendeed\n\nMeshuggah\n\nMisery Index\n\nMnemic\n\nMortification\n\nMunicipal Waste\n\nMy Early Mustang\n\nMystic Prophecy\n\nN[]\n\nNarnia\n\nNew Eden\n\nNightwish\n\nNile\n\nNokturnal Mortum\n\nNo Return\n\nO[]\n\nOmnium Gatherum\n\nOne Man Army and the Undead Quartet\n\nOpprobrium\n\nOrphanage\n\nP[]\n\nPain\n\nPegazus\n\nPrimal Fear\n\nPrime STH\n\nPro-Pain\n\nPsycroptic\n\nPungent Stench\n\nPyogenesis\n\nPornigager\n\nR[]\n\nRage\n\nRaise Hell\n\nRaunchy\n\nRe:Aktor\n\nReVamp\n\nRevenant\n\nRhapsody of Fire\n\nRide the Sky\n\nRighteous Pigs\n\nS[]\n\nS.O.D.\n\nSabaton\n\nSamael\n\nSatyricon\n\nSavatage (United States only)\n\nScar Symmetry\n\nSculpture\n\nSecret Sphere\n\nSepultura\n\nSinergy\n\nSinister\n\nSinner\n\nSirenia\n\nSkyclad\n\nSlapdash\n\nSlaughter\n\nSlipknot (Scandinavia only)\n\nSoilwork\n\nSonata Arctica\n\nSonic Syndicate\n\nSpeckmann Project\n\nStahlhammer\n\nStark Raving Mad\n\nSteel Prophet\n\nStormwitch\n\nStratovarius\n\nSubway To Sally\n\nSuccess Will Write Apocalypse Across the Sky\n\nSuch A Surge\n\nSuffocation\n\nSuicidal Tendencies\n\nSusperia\n\nSwashbuckle\n\nSylosis\n\nSymphony X\n\nT[]\n\nTapping the Vein\n\nTarot\n\nTasters\n\nTerror 2000\n\nTestament\n\nTexas in July (Europe only)\n\nTextures\n\nTheatre of Tragedy\n\nThe 69 Eyes\n\nThe Abyss\n\nThe Accüsed\n\nThe Black League\n\nThe Crinn\n\nTerrorwhore\n\nThe Destiny Program\n\nThe Duskfall\n\nTherion\n\nThreat Signal\n\nThe Jekki Kingmaetami Dingpaerimani\n\nThreshold\n\nThunderstone\n\nTiamat\n\nTidfall\n\nTimo Tolkki\n\nTo/Die/For\n\nV[]\n\nVoivod\n\nVader\n\nW[]"
