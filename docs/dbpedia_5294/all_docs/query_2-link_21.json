        "text": "Maybe not my favourite, but undoubtely the first one that always promoted progress in extreme music, and so much respect for that.\n\nSO MUCH RESPECT.\n\nSome history\n\nThe label was started by Matthew F. Jacobson in August, 1990 in his parents' basement in Aurora, Colorado. The first two releases on the label were 7-inch singles by the bands Velcro Overdose and Face of Decline, closely followed by three death metal bands that would become among the biggest on the label, Deceased, Suffocation, and Incantation.\n\nJacobson started Relapse Records on a release-by-release basis and wasn&#8217;t expecting any far-reaching extensive plan for the future, until one day he realized that there could be a future for the label beyond his own labor of love. He used his extensive list of contacts that he gained from his work at fanzine, Horrendlfled, to network not only the label but also the artists Matthew had signed.\n\nAfter this, Jacobson became acquainted with William Yurkiewicz Jr., who became his partner in the record label. Yurkiewicz had founded his own record label, which was soon to release albums from the bands General Surgery, Disrupt, Destroy, Misery, and Yurkiewicz's own band Exit-13. The two joined forces to create Relapse Records, aiming to release high-quality, professionally packaged extreme music.\n\nIn 1991, the label moved their headquarters to Millersville, Pennsylvania. In 1992, the label expanded its range with the creation of its subsidiary label called Release Entertainment, which specializes in experimental, ambient, industrial, and noise titles. With continued growth came a mail-order/wholesale operation that soon became the largest underground distribution center for all things metal in the United States. The mail-order service carried a wide array of extreme music recordings and merchandise, as well as publications from around the world.\n\nThroughout the years Relapse has continued to grow and sign on more influential artists from a broader range of genres. In 1996, Relapse unveiled the Resound Music Resource Guide. Resound gave fans direct access to the label's roster through interviews and reviews, as well as being part mail-order catalog.\n\nIn 1998, Relapse opened a promotions office in Berlin, as well as establishing a German Distribution deal. The second milestone came in 2003 when the first ever Relapse Contamination Festival was held January 18 and 19 at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and featured various Relapse artists. In 2000, the label relocated to Upper Darby, outside of Philadelphia and began plans to include a physical record store. In June 2001, the label opened their first record store off of South Street in Philadelphia, near several other notable underground record stores.\n\nIn 2010, Relapse announced that they had done a deal with intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif and Perseverance Holdings Ltd. to take over the Death catalog and brand internationally.\n\nOn August 5, 2011, Relapse announced a pay what you want partnership with Moshpit Tragedy Records, which will see one mp3 album from the Relapse catalog issued weekly through MoshpitTragedy.com.\n\nThe label specializes in various types of heavy metal. Recently, with the increasing popularity of extreme metal, Relapse Records has ostensibly become more mainstream, with bands on their roster frequently appearing on the front cover of the magazine Kerrang! and video plays on TV music channels, along with some albums charting on the Billboard 200. The word has also been spread by the sponsorship of such festivals as the Milwaukee Metalfest.\n\nIt would be hard however to label the company as dealing in one specific style or another, as there are artists of such a wide variety on their roster, ranging from stoner rock and hardcore bands through to grindcore and death metal all the way to retro thrash metal and doom.\n\nThe officially licensed reissues the label has also released also adds many other genres into their style.\n\nFormer artists\n\nAbscess\n\nAlabama Thunder.....\n\nAlchemist\n\nAmber Asylum\n\nAmorphis\n\nAnal ....\n\nAntigama\n\nBenumb\n\nBirds Of Prey\n\nBlood Duster\n\nBongzilla\n\nBuried Inside\n\nBurnt By The Sun\n\nBurst\n\nCandiru\n\nCar Bomb\n\nCircle Of Animals\n\nColdworker\n\nColiseum\n\nConverge\n\nConvulse\n\nDaylight Dies\n\nDead World\n\nDeceased\n\nDestroy\n\nDillinger Escape Plan\n\nDisembowelment\n\nDisrupt\n\nThe End\n\nExit-13\n\nFacedowninshit\n\nFlesh Parade\n\nGenocide Superstars\n\nGore Beyond Necropsy\n\nGoreaphobia\n\nGraves of Valor\n\nHalo\n\nHemdale\n\nHero Destroyed\n\nHigh on Fire\n\nHuman Remains\n\nIncantation\n\nJucifer\n\nKaraboudjan\n\nLeng Tch'e\n\nMalformed Earthborn\n\nMan Must Die\n\nMastodon\n\nMerzbow\n\nMindrot\n\nMisery Index\n\nMononstat 7\n\nMorgion\n\nMortician\n\nMythic\n\nNasum\n\nNebula\n\nNeurosis\n\nNightstick\n\nNile\n\nOrigin\n\nPan-thy-monium\n\nPeople\n\nPhobia\n\nPsycho Enhancer\n\nRegurgitate\n\nRelentless / Ruin\n\nRumpelstiltskin Grinder\n\nKarl Sanders\n\nSkinless\n\nSoilent Green\n\nSubarachnoid Space\n\nSuffocation\n\nToday Is The Day\n\nUnsane\n\nUphill Battle\n\nVidna Obmana\n\nCurrent artists\n\n16\n\nAbysmal Dawn\n\nAgenda of Swine\n\nAgoraphobic Nosebleed\n\nASG\n\nBaroness\n\nBlack Anvil\n\nBlack Tusk\n\nBloodiest\n\nBrian Posehn\n\nBroughton's Rules\n\nBrutal Truth\n\nCephalic Carnage\n\nChris Connelly\n\nChristian Mistress\n\nCitizen\n\nCoalesce\n\nCoffins\n\nCough\n\nThe County Medical Examiners\n\nCretin\n\nCripple Bastards\n\nCulted\n\nDekapitator\n\nDevourment\n\nDisfear\n\nDon Caballero\n\nDukatalon\n\nDying Fetus\n\nDysrhythmia\n\nExhumed\n\n.... the Facts\n\nGadget\n\nGeneral Surgery\n\nGenghis Tron\n\nHaemorrhage\n\nHail!Hornet\n\nThe High Confessions\n\nHooded Menace\n\nHorseback\n\nHowl\n\nScott Hull\n\nIndian\n\nInevitable End\n\nInter Arma\n\nInverloch\n\nKill The Client\n\nKingdom of Sorrow\n\nLiberteer\n\nLooking for Answer\n\nLord Dying\n\nMinsk\n\nMoore, Steve\n\nMose Giganticus\n\nMumakil\n\nMurder Construct\n\nNecrophagist\n\nNoisear\n\nNothing\n\nObscura\n\nPig Destroyer\n\nPrimate\n\nRabbits\n\nRed Fang\n\nRevocation\n\nRotten Sound\n\nRoyal Thunder\n\nRwake\n\nSpawn of Possession\n\nTitan\n\nTombs\n\nToxic Holocaust\n\nUlcerate\n\nUltramantis Black\n\nUnearthly Trance\n\nUnkind\n\nVoivod\n\nVverevvolf Grehv\n\nWeapon\n\nWeekend Nachos\n\nZeke\n\nZombi\n\nAffiliated artists\n\n(artists for whom the label have either reissued old releases of or for whom Relapse are the licensees for the North American market)\n\n27\n\nAbraxas\n\nAdrenalin O.D.\n\nAmazing Grace\n\nAnata\n\nAngel of Decay\n\nAtheist\n\nBastard Noise / Christian Renou\n\nBodies in the Gears of the Apparatus\n\nBreach\n\nBroken Bones\n\nBuzzoven\n\nCarnal Forge\n\nControl Denied\n\nCriminal Element\n\nCryptic Slaughter\n\nDarkane\n\nDead Horse\n\nDeath\n\nDeath Breath\n\nDespised Icon\n\nFinal Conflict\n\nFredrik Thordendal's Special Defects\n\nGod Macabre\n\nGodflesh\n\nGorerotted\n\nGruntsplatter\n\nHarvey Milk\n\nLost Soul\n\nLuddite Clone\n\nMammoth Grinder\n\nmassappeal\n\nMaximum RNR / The Spades\n\nNirvana 2002\n\nNapalm Death\n\nParasytic\n\nPentagram\n\nRapture\n\nRed Harvest\n\nRepulsion\n\nRune\n\nShape Of Despair\n\nSiege\n\nSubterranean Source\n\nSulaco\n\nSun Dial\n\nTroum\n\nWaldchengarten\n\nWarpig\n\nXysma\n\nYattering"
