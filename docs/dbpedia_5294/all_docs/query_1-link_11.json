        "text": "STRATOVARIUS Interview with Jens Johansson\n\nSeptember 2000\n\nInfernal Dominion: Well, first off I'd like to ask you about the new album Infinite.\n\nJens Johansson: Well, it's a record that was recorded last year. We finished it sometime in December, I guess, and well, I think it's a good record.\n\nID: I've heard it goes back to the Episode days a bit...\n\nJens: Yeah, a little bit. I guess you could say that, a little bit.\n\nID: By the way, you're one hell of a keyboardist...\n\nJens: Oh, thanks...\n\nID: I've heard that Infinite is a much more positive album than Destiny was.\n\nJens: I think so, yeah. I don't write much of the lyrics; the guitar player writes the majority of the lyrics, and I think he's happier now than when he wrote the last record.\n\nID: Now, you wrote a couple of songs on this one right?\n\nJens: Actually, I wrote like four...\n\nID: Only two made it though?\n\nJens: Only one made it, actually. I don't know what the bonus track is here in the States but...\n\nID: It's \"Glory Of The World,\" right?\n\nJens: Yeah, that's the one that made it on all of the records, I think. We only completed like three that I made.\n\nID: So, what does your song sound like?\n\nJens: You mean the one that made it on the record?\n\nID: Yeah.\n\nJens: It sounds like a typical Stratovarius song, believe it or not.\n\nID: It's a fast one?\n\nJens: Yeah...The ones I wrote that weren't typical Stratovarius songs, they were like \"Wow, this sounds weird!\" I make it a point to write something that's maybe a little bit different, but it didn't work out for me. [Laughs.]\n\nID: Whose idea was it to get Rhapsody on the tour?\n\nJens: Yeah, it's going to be an exciting tour, I think. I know a lot of people are looking forward to seeing the whole package, so I think it's great. Over there, there's very good people over there, kind of in the same spirit as me. It's not extremely technical stuff, but it's good writing.\n\nID: I think you're one of his influences actually.\n\nJens: Well, that's not a bad thing [laughs]. The guy from Sonata Arctica is really good, too. He's like a 19 year old kid or something. Have a new generation take over ya know.\n\nID: They're from Finland too, right?\n\nJens: Yes, they are.\n\nID: And you're from Sweden?\n\nJens: Yes.\n\nID: Where are you living right now?\n\nJens: New York.\n\nID: Are you going to write more in the future?\n\nJens: Yeah! Sure, I mean, I don't know when the next record is gonna come out...2002 or something.\n\nID: I know you're really into the fusion stuff, right?\n\nJens: Yeah, I've done a bit of that stuff before the Stratovarius record.\n\nID: What about Jari and Jorg, will they ever write songs for you guys?\n\nJens: It's hard to say! Ya know, people change, but as of right now none of those guys seem to be interested. So, you have to have some kind of interest. I think Jorg's talked about it like (mimics a dumb voice), \"Uhhh, yeah, I dunno, I'll just play the drums.\"\n\nID: Yeah, I'm a drummer, too. I know what that's like.\n\nJens: Yeah, I think it's hard to write songs when you don't play a toned instrument.\n\nID: Yeah, that's true. So, what's your favorite Stratovarius album?\n\nJens: My favorite record? I'd have to say this one, of course. It's the newest one, and I haven't worn it out yet! The other one, Episode, was like fresh for me. But all of them really, even Fourth Dimension was good.\n\nID: Are you guys ever going to re-record some of the old songs?\n\nJens: I don't think so. No, it's prohibited.\n\nID: Oh, Noise has them?\n\nJens: Yeah.\n\nID: So Nuclear Blast won't be able to rerelease any albums either?\n\nJens: Well, you know, never say never. I mean, they could buy the catalog or something, but usually the label will hold on to this stuff. Stranger things have happened. Times-Warner Atlantic buys both companies and it's all on the same label! Maybe there's going to be only one label in the universe in the future.\n\nID: [Laughs.]\n\nJens: Times-Warner Atlantic, maybe it's going to be like that!\n\nID: Your Visions of Europe live album is very impressive. It's definitely one of the best live albums I own!\n\nJens: Yeah, that was a lot of fun!\n\nID: Yes, I really like it! But anyway, I was wondering what's your favorite song to play live?\n\nJens: Ahhh, fuck, that's difficult. \"Eternity\" is one I like...\n\nID: Any surprises for the setlist this time around?\n\nJens: I don't really know. I mean, we have a lot of rehearsing to do and we'll try and work out whether it will be a greatest hits type of...or try and incorporate more from the new record.\n\nID: Speaking of greatest hits, who came up with the cover for the Chosen Ones?\n\nJens: Yeah, that's a long story, hehe. That record was after the contract with Noise...The old label.\n\nID: So, it was contractual obligations, kinda?\n\nJens: Mmm, not even obligations. I think bascially because they could, ya know, they wanted to get the last money they could out of us, but we got the final revenge because our drummer, Jorg...Noise said, \"We don't have a cover.\" Jorg said, \"We have a cover,\" and it's this horrible elk vomiting that some German guy made for a t-shirt, like a joke t-shirt, that we sold only in Finland because the Finns sometimes when they drink they turn into these characters. So Jorg says, \"I have this one thing, maybe we can use that.\" Noise is like, \"Ohh, okay! How much is it?\" Jorg says, \"Ahh ya know, I could probably get it for you cheap.\" It doesn't really look like a Stratovarius record at all.\n\nID: No, it doesn't.\n\nJens: It isn't really, because it's all old rehashed material basically.\n\nID: The fans picked the songs, didn't they?\n\nJens: Yeah...I think it was basically that they wanted a last bite of the apple and released it very close to our Infinite. I guess they basically wanted a little bit more money off of it, ya know.\n\nID: So, why did you guys choose Nuclear Blast?\n\nJens: Umm, it was a long, drawn out process. I mean, there were a lot of labels and I guess it was the best label.\n\nID: Yeah, it's a good label! Will they get you over to the States ever?\n\nJens: It's hard to say. I hope so, but with the economics of it it's a little bit difficult with our type of music ya know. You know, we'll see...\n\nID: Who are some of your personal influences?\n\nJens: Ahh, when I was a kid I got into Deep Purple and shit like that. Zappa, Rainbow I liked a lot. I dont know, there's a lot of stuff I like.\n\nID: How's Infinite doing so far compared to Destiny?\n\nJens: I think it's doing better! But you never know until the dust settles, I think. Bascially, we're home safe and we have much better royalty rates than on the last one because Nuclear Blast is a better label and everything. So it's looking pretty bright.\n\nID: Do you know anything about the symbolism on the cover for Infinite?\n\nJens: I think, again, it was Tolkki who came up with the idea for that and he told the artist Derek Riggs. I think it's the lefthand side is the physcial world and the righthand side is the side of the spiritual world and it all symbolizes souls jumping between two dominions or something like that.\n\nID: Any particular music you've been listening to lately?\n\nJens: Um, not really, actually. I mean, I've worked so much with music (lately), but I have been listening to this guy from Finland called Andy West, who plays bass for the Dixie Dregs.\n\nID: Oh, I saw them live with Dream Theater.\n\nJens: Oh, yeah, yeah okay. I mean you work with music all day and that's the last thing you want to do when you relax is put on more music. I mean, I usually listen to classical music. Apart from that, Meshuggah, I like actually. Very good band.\n\nID: So, what's your opinion on the Iron Maiden reformation?\n\nJens: I think it's good. They're coming out with a record in May or something I think. Hang on, I have to close the windows, some fucking morons are honking out there...\n\nID: What's the Finnish metal scene like, do ya know?\n\nJens: I would say it's quite alive, actually. They have a weird little community over there. It hasn't been like Stratovarius music, it's been like more heavy and stuff. They're coming out with the death stuff, loads of those bands, especially from the North of Finland. There's some really sick stuff up there, a little bit twisted. The lack of sun, it turns people into strange creatures. Sentenced, I don't know if you've heard of them...\n\nID: Yeah, I've heard them. Is your brother drumming for HammerFall now?\n\nJens: Yeah. They're going to go to Nashville in the beginning of May to record something...To record with this Michael Wagner guy. They're also on Nuclear Blast, so we're like labelmates. Also, with Meshuggah, that will be cool...\n\nID: Any other recordings that you'll be playing on soon?\n\nJens: Umm, I don't really know. It takes so long to do stuff and I don't know when it will come out. I've been working on stuff. I have a few things pending with my brother, more fusion type stuff like the Last Viking record that we last year. It's all about getting the material together and finding the time to do it. I've been a little bit burned out the last couple of months with the touring. I mean, we put out one record then it's the world tour now every year for the last three or four years, so I haven't spent too much time at home. The time that I did have off, I've done a bunch of other fucking stuff, like other recordings. I constantly promise people stuff that maybe I can't do. But, I mean, this Andy West guy, I think I put him off like six or seven months. It's been tough and I feel bad about it too like, \"Oh fuck...\" Ya know.\n\nID: Didn't you try out for Dream Theater once?\n\nJens: Yes, exactly yes! It was like back in, when Kevin left, like in '93 or '94.\n\nID: What happened with that?\n\nJens: I don't really know. It's hard to say...I think they felt that they had a bit more offers so they wanted to keep on looking, you know, for the perfect fit. They wanted to be really picky and, actually, I think the guy they have now, they tried out as well, and he didn't get the gig either so...Musical chairs, hehe.\n\nID: Does Timo encourage you guys to write?\n\nJens: He doesn't discourage or encourage I mean, he's Finnish so...\n\nID: [Laughs]\n\nJens: ...So he doesn't talk so much.\n\nID: So, does he go somewhere, write a bunch of songs and come out with them and just show them to you guys?\n\nJens: Yeah, like three days. Quite quick actually with that.\n\nID: Do you guys have any type of home video to be released soon?\n\nJens: There is some type of home video, yeah. The plan is to make it a mix of home video footage and the MTV videos that we've done. Nuclear Blast had to purchase the rights to the videos.\n\nID: Like \"Kiss Of Judas\" and \"SOS?\"\n\nJens: I think they're good videos actually.\n\nID: Yeah, I saw them online!\n\nJens: I think for the budget...We hooked up with a Finnish director. Like I said, it's kind of a community over there, everybody helps everybody...and it's very nice.\n\nID: Did you guys do a video for \"Hunting High And Low?\"\n\nJens: Yes, actually.\n\nID: Where did you guys shoot that at?\n\nJens: Over in Finland. I think it will be online as well, it looks very nice.\n\nID: Is it a live performance or is there a little story behind it?\n\nJens: It's somewhere between that, they intercut with the live performance. Well, live, not really live...\n\nID: Well, yeah. [Laughs]\n\nJens: Yeah, well, it's sort of like the other videos, it's sort of like \"SOS,\" if you saw that one.\n\nID: So, where did Timo find you and get you in the band?\n\nJens: I think it was like this...He called and they were looking for a replacement for the old guy. He called this guy in Japan, the editor for a magazine called Burn and somehow he had my number. He faxed me and I was like, \"Who the fuck is this?\" He replied and sent me a CD and I thought, 'This is very nice.' I think it was a demo, basically the demo of Episode, and I figured \"This sounds like very good songwriting,\" and it's a chance to go to Finland...\n\nID: What was working with Yngwie (Malmsteen) like?\n\nJens: Well, in retrospect, I think it was a lot of fun. Well, of course, you tend to remember the fond memories longer than the bad ones. I don't think it was negative though, I wouldn't trade it for anything really.\n\nID: A lot of people say that he's really arrogant...\n\nJens: Well, I guess he is a little bit, but I think he's mellowed out, too. I think he used to be awful to a lot of people, but he's mellowed out a bit.\n\nID: Well, he's got kids now, so that might help.\n\nJens: Yeah, I think he mellowed out a little bit before that even. You get older, you start thinking more maybe. I think also he doesn't drink as much as he used to, I think that's the source of many of the problems. He would do these interviews and he would come off as an asshole, but a lot of times he would be joking and he would be drunk as hell, and of course, if you're ironic or joking or something, it doesn't really make it in the print. He would say, \"Oh, I thought Randy Rhoades, he was a terrible guitarist!\" and he got so much shit for that and he wasn't even serious. It's a terrible thing to say, but he was drunk out of his skull and didn't know what he was saying. It was just a joke, ya know, and the guy was like, \"Okay\" and he writes it down and it ends up in black and white, in print, and it's there forever.\n\nID: Now, I know Jorg used to drum for Running Wild and lots of other bands. Did Timo force him to choose a band?\n\nJens: I think, yeah, he talked to him about it. I don't really know if he forced him, but maybe Jorg was maybe thinking of it himself, actually, because he didn't really have any off-time either. He was on the road as well, and the stuff I do is just recording basically, like projects, and he would go into long, drawn out sessions. He'd go on the road when he was out with Stratovarius...and it's really weird, but I think he was happy about it, too. Gave him an excuse not to do stuff, ya know...\n\nID: I don't know if you can answer this, but Timo was talking about working on some sort of half-hour song or something?\n\nJens: I don't know, really. Maybe for a solo record. He doesn't talk much these days, he just mumbles like mono...one syllable.\n\nID: [Laughs.] Did you write the lyrics to your song, too?\n\nJens: Yeah, I did. It's not terribly deep, but it's pretty much in line with the rest of the record though. Positive instead of negative stuff.\n\nID: I heard something about maybe Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween vocalist) doing something on Timo Tolkki's solo project or something?\n\nJens: Yeah, I think so on his solo recording, and I think I can probably confirm that. They have been talking a lot like over e-mail and on the phone and stuff like that, too. I think he'll probably end up only singing on a couple of tracks, but it will be really interesting.\n\nID: Is (Timo) Kotipelto (Stratovarius' vocalist) influenced by Kiske?\n\nJens: I don't know, maybe a little bit.\n\nID: I can hear it a little bit.\n\nJens: This Kiske guy, he's a strange guy...like why he left Helloween. He got into religious stuff like real heavy, like this Spinder guy, I don't know if you've heard about him, but he wrote a book and stuff, too. Right after the collaboration with Tolkki he was doing a lot of thinking over the last couple of years. It's pretty interesting, I think they were philosophising a lot over e-mail...\n\nID: What do you think when critics say you and Timo only play fast, shredding solos with no feeling and no emotion?\n\nJens: I'd say it's probably a valid complaint. You can't transform much emotion at these tempos. For me, the keyboard solos are very short; they're like eight seconds, and if you play too slow, you only get like two notes in there or something. I dont know, I save all that emotional bullshit for other records. I think, though, the last couple of records have been less shred and I think it's not me. It was Timo who was interested in the other way. I did so much shred when I was young that I'm quite sick of it at this point.\n\nID: I think on the slow songs he really shows his emotion with his guitar playing.\n\nJens: Yeah...\n\nID: Does Timo Tolkki write all of the lyrics, too?\n\nJens: I think to his own songs, yeah.\n\nID: Have you heard Nightwish from Finland?\n\nJens: Of course, yes. I have their cd which I bought at the airport. Yes, very good.\n\nID: Yeah, they're a great band.\n\nJens: Yeah I think with them and Sonata Arctica it's like a more melodic wave coming on from there, so...\n\nID: Yeah, I think melodic metal is making a comeback...even in the States. I dunno, there's a little bit. It's more than it used to be, that's for sure.\n\nJens: It's a very big place so it's hard to tour and we only sell like 5,000 copies I think.\n\nID: Well, I bought 'em.\n\nJens: Yeah. [Laughs.]\n\nID: I know a lot of people who would love to have you come over here, but I dunno. You guys are probably used to playing pretty big places, am I right?\n\nJens: Um, probably bigger than we'd play here, but that's not the matter so much. It's basically a question of economics. How much money we'd lose, you know...and it would be a lot I think, if we came here.\n\nID: Maybe you guys could do a package tour with Gamma Ray or something like that...\n\nJens: Yeah, exactly...I think they're still on Noise, though. You've got all this political stuff. You'd have to worry about who plays first.\n\nID: Then again, you could tour with HammerFall...\n\nJens: You know, that's true. They were already here, I think.\n\nID: Yeah, they were here; they toured with Death...Well, I guess we can wrap it up here. Is there anything else you'd like to say?\n\nJens: I guess that hopefully we'll come here, but who in the hell knows, really? It's still up in the air. I guess we'll see how the record does. of course, if the record does well it's easier to convince the suits...(They'll say) \"Oh, of course...100 grand to come here. No problem.\" They say, \"Okay, we'll sign the check and get you the airline tickets and the Winebego or whatever.\"\n\nID: [Laughs.] Well, I'd like to thank you very much for your time. I appreciate your music and you're a really great band. I'd love to have you come over to the States.\n\nJens: Well, depends on how the record is doing."
