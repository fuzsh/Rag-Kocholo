        "text": "Since its inception, Louisville's GATES TO HELL has fused the finest elements from both metal and hardcore, highlighting fast metal riffs with heavy hardcore and deathcore breakdowns written in a manner unexplored within the Kentucky music scene. The last year saw the band playing nearly 150 shows in 11 different countries supporting the likes of DYING FETUS, THE BLACK DAHLIA MURDER, THE ACACIA STRAIN, DESPISED ICON, SANGUISUGABOGG, BODYSNATCHER, KRUELTY, and DYING WISH on various tours across the US, Canada and Europe.\n\nContinuing this momentum with no sign of slowing down, the band is ushering in 2024 with a new home at Nuclear Blast Records, a pummeling new single, and heading on the road with labelmates MACHINE HEAD and FEAR FACTORY.\n\nGATES TO HELL's guitarist Seth Lewis states, “I was a kid who loved metal from a very young age and I was constantly buying CDs of my favorite bands. Over time, I saw how many of those bands' CDs had the Nuclear Blast logo on the back. It’s a very unreal feeling to be working with them now with Gates to Hell. Very excited for what the future holds.”\n\nNuclear Blast American Label Manager & A&R Tommy Jones comments, \"After a tip-off from my buddy Scott Lee, I first entered the Gates to Hell at the Milwaukee Metal Fest on May 28th, 2023. Straight from the rip seeing the band live, I was way into their style of Brutal Death Metal laced with hardcore energy. I could envision them being part of the new breed at Nuclear Blast. Fast forward after some hang sessions on the Jersey shore, and up at the New England Metal Fest, we officially sealed the deal in October on Friday the 13th. Fitting AF! I am stoked 'as hell' to welcome the Gates to the worldwide Nuclear Blast family! Let’s gooo!!”\n\nThe band's newest offering comes in the single, fittingly entitled 'Resurrected'. The song is a perfect example of their hybrid sound mixing modern death metal with the hardcore spirit. The song was engineered and mixed by Andy Nelson at Bricktop Studios while mastering was completed by Brad Boatwright at Audioseige Mastering.\n\n“Our new track ‘Resurrected’ just dropped through Nuclear Blast\" comments Seth Lewis. \"It’s my favorite Gates to Hell song released to date. After touring and practicing as much as we have the last couple of years, we’ve all really meshed together so much better as musicians. Trying to stick to our roots of the death metal/hardcore sound our music has always had, but being more collaborative and creative with some elements.”"
