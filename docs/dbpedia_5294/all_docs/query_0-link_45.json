        "text": "Score9/10GenrePower MetalCountrySwedenRuntime55:34Release Date7 June 2019Record LabelNuclear Blast\n\nAfter six years of hiatus, power metal cheeseballs Majestica (formerly ReinXeed) are back with their seventh album, Above the Sky. Aside from a drastic name change, Majestica’s sound has grown more mature, despite their lyrical content becoming more juvenile than ever. Of course, these are perfect qualities to have in a power metal album: bullshit, nonsensical lyrics over technically impressive music.\n\nOn the songwriting side of things we have vastly dynamic neoclassical arrangements full of countless keyboard layers. The formatting in many of the songs doesn’t always follow conventional guidelines, so, while the core of each track has the same light, energetic power, there’s plenty to keep the album from being monotonous. The musicianship is phenomenal, with bandleader Tommy Johansson (Sabaton) delivering fantastical performances on both the guitar and vocals.\n\nOn the lyrical side of things, there’s no shortage of entertainment; comedy is around every corner. The 80s-themed ‘Night Call Girl’ shines bright in this respect, delivering a graphic (and kind of creepy) ode to, well, a night call girl. However, no track in Above the Sky holds a candle to the ridiculousness that is ‘Father Time’.\n\nWhat. A. Shitshow. If you only listen to one track on this record, make sure it’s this one. Aside from the Christmas/New Year theme that holds the whole thing together, the song structure is, to say it modestly, super fucking wacky. We have some slow, pulled back portions, rampant power beats, and even the can-can. Yes, you read that right, the fucking can-can. The changes in ‘Father Time’ are so jarring that it easily takes a place as an instant holiday classic. What’s more, the lyrics are so ludicrously out-of-this-world that you won’t even know what to do with yourself. “Father Time with a rifle in his hand,”? Yes please.\n\nNeedless to say, Above the Sky scratches every power metal itch I have. Whether it’s the oozing cheese or sickeningly sweet, upbeat feel throughout, there’s not a doubt in my mind that this will be a top album of the year for every power metal fan.\n\nIf you want to be notified every time PowerThorn publishes a review or article, you can subscribe to the blog or go like the >>Facebook Page<<!\n\nFor all the same (but mostly memes), >>@PowerThorn<< on Instagram is exactly what you need.\n\nStay Metal \\m/\n\nSwedish power outfit Majestica (formerly ReinXeed) announced that they had a new album on the way about a month ago. Upon the announcement, they revealed the first single, ‘Rising Tide’, which is about as true as power metal gets.\n\nToday, the band dropped their second single, which does things a bit differently.\n\n‘Night Call Girl’ is an 80s tribute song from some of the bandmates’ favourite artists of the era, such as Gary Moore, Rick Springfield, Europe, and Journey. And, as is the way of these influences, this track is super fucking cheesy.\n\nMake sure to catch Majestica’s Above the Sky when it comes out 7 June!\n\nFollow Majestica on Facebook!\n\nIf you want to be notified every time PowerThorn publishes a review or article, you can subscribe to the blog or go like the >>Facebook Page<<!\n\nFor all the same (but mostly memes), >>@PowerThorn<< on Instagram is exactly what you need.\n\nStay Metal \\m/\n\nSymphonic power metal outfit Majestica (formerly ReinXeed) have made a couple big announcements today; they have released their first single, ‘Rising Tide’, of their upcoming album, as well as confirmed the title: Above the Sky.\n\nHere’s what Majestica has to say about the song:\n\n“‘Rising Tide’ is not only an epic power metal song in the vein of Edguy, Stratovarius, and Running Wild. It’s also very orchestral with a lot of Hans Zimmer influences. The lyrics are about some people hoping to find the fountain of youth, because they’re becoming old and wanna relive the good times of when they were younger. This song also represents the band as well as the direction and sound of the new record pretty well. Not only for the music but also that we show that we love doing what we do and can throw in some humour here and there.”\n\nAlong with these announcements, Majestica have also released the cover art (produced by Sabaton guitarist Chris Rörland) and tracklist, which you can find below.\n\nAfter six years of inactivity, ReinXeed (with Sabaton’s Tommy Johansson at the helm) have signed onto Nuclear Blast, changed their name, and announced a new record. 7 June marks their return.\n\nPreorder Above the Sky here.\n\nFollow Majestica on Facebook!\n\nIf you want to be notified every time PowerThorn publishes a review or article, you can subscribe to the blog or go like the >>Facebook Page<<!\n\nFor all the same (but mostly memes), >>@PowerThorn<< on Instagram is exactly what you need.\n\nStay Metal \\m/\n\nSwedish symphonic power metallers Majestica have signed onto Nuclear Blast Records and have also announced a new record, Above the Sky, set for release in Summer 2019.\n\nMajestica were formed under the former name ReinXeed by current Sabaton guitarist Tommy Johansson in 2000. They went through numerous lineup changes throughout their history, but their current lineup also includes of Alexander Ortiz (Guitar) and Christopher Davidsson (Bass). Tommy mans the guitars as well as the vocals, which he has shown off before in ReinXeed as well as being Twilight Force’s stand-in in Fall 2017.\n\nThe band had released six full length albums before Tommy joined Sabaton in 2016, which put ReinXeed on the backburner.\n\nTommy states:\n\n“It’s been many years since we last released an album, so we decided to ‘start over’ as a new band, Majestica, instead. It’s not only a majestic and epic name for a power metal band from Sweden, it’s also a tribute to the album Majestic that we released with ReinXeed in 2010. We came up with it and it sounded great, it felt perfect for this kind of music and just feels right.”\n\nTommy, on the band’s sound:\n\n“People can expect real power metal in the vein of Helloween, Stratovarius, and Gamma Ray, but also great symphonic parts with catchy melodies and choruses with a lot of choral arrangements, guitar solos, beautiful inflections and of course – high pitched vocals like Michael Kiske, Timo Kotipelto and Sebastian Bach.”\n\nWhile the band is currently a trio, they scored ex-Helloween drummer Uli Kusch to record the drums for their upcoming album.\n\nTommy on having Kusch’s:\n\n“It was a huge honour and his drums make this album sound more alive than any album I’ve ever recorded with any other band before. Since many songs are inspired by Helloween and Gamma Ray it just felt right to have his drumming and input on the songs.”\n\nWith a new name, a new label, and a new record coming, Majestica should be on the radar of every power metal fan.\n\nCheck out Majestica on Facebook!\n\nIf you want to be notified every time PowerThorn publishes a review or article, you can subscribe to the blog or go like the >>Facebook Page<<!\n\nFor all the same (but mostly memes), >>@PowerThorn<< on Instagram is exactly what you need.\n\nStay Metal \\m/"
