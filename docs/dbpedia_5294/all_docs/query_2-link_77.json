        "text": "Marilyn Manson appears to have signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records.\n\nEarlier today, the shock rocker and the long-running German record label shared a new teaser video along with the caption \"NB x MM\".\n\nThe news of a partnership with Nuclear Blast comes just weeks after rumors suggested that Manson had already completed work on a new album.\n\nMarilyn hasn't released new music since his 2020 \"We Are Chaos\" LP.\n\nManson's 30-date arena/amphitheater tour with FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH is slated to kick off on August 2 at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania.\n\nOver the past three years, Manson has been embroiled in a series of court battles and has been accused by several women — most notably \"Westworld\" star Evan Rachel Wood — of sexual, emotional and physical abuse.\n\nManson, who has denied all the allegations, has countersued a number of his alleged victims and judges have dismissed several of the abuse lawsuits against him.\n\nThe 55-year-old musician, whose real name is Brian Warner, has been off the road since the final August 18, 2019 date on the \"Twins of Evil: Hell Never Dies\" joint tour with Rob Zombie.\n\nIn 2022, Marilyn confirmed he was dropped by his record label, Loma Vista Recordings, and talent agency CAA after he was accused of sexual assault.\n\nManson has consistently denied sexually assaulting or abusing anyone, claiming that his \"intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners\"."
