If you think you can compete with our other artists (in terms of songwriting/ playing abilities) or if you've got something special and unique to offer, we're happy to get your demo.\n\nNevertheless, we are trying to listen to all demos we get. Please note that we get LOTS of them, so be patient if you don't get a message after one or two weeks."
