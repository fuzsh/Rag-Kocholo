        "text": "Friend, I was just as surprised as you when I learned that Turilli / Lione Rhapsody, the imaginatively named new group bringing together Luca Turilli and Fabio Lione, was trading in their bombastic, symphonic-leaning power metal in favor of an album of harmonium-led drone and burbling Krautrock.\n\nBut of course, I jest. Time is a flat circle, and the gelatinous hub and spoke model of the Rhapsody universe rotates ineluctably around power metal.\n\nRelease date: July 5, 2019. Label: Nuclear Blast.\n\nNevertheless, while Zero Gravity surely boasts exactly the sort of gloriously straight-faced excess one would expect from these Italian veterans, it differs from the members’ other recent offerings by virtue of its thoroughly modern sheen. Turilli’s and Leurquin’s rhythm guitars are a chunky, pummeling whiplash of sound, while Turilli’s keyboard work often drapes the songs in the futuristic tones of trance. (If you like, you could probably think about music like this as the functional opposite of jazz. I’m not sure why you would want to, but maybe your brain is a bit like mine: slightly, pleasantly deranged.) Some of the shorter, punchier tracks actually bear a little modern Dream Theater influence (cf. “Multidimensional”), and the electronic touches are surprisingly deft and used relatively sparingly – rather like Blind Guardian on Beyond the Red Mirror. Another surprise here is a couple songs that wear their Queen influence quite proudly, like “Decoding the Multiverse” around 4:00 and “I Am” around 4:20, whereas the chorus of “Fast Radio Burst” almost seems to keep dropping beats, which gives it an impatient, forward-driving energy. Point being, you might think you know what you’re getting, but you don’t quite.\n\nWhereas on older Rhapsody albums the symphonic / classical aspect leaned more on a sort of minstrel troupe model, on Zero Gravity, the non-metal extracurricular elements sound much more like the sort of big-budget, slick world pop you might hear in a PBS concert performance by someone like Yanni, Sarah Brightman, or Josh Groban. The title track is the best example, where about 3:30 in, the song breaks for some ethereal vocals, sitar, and other folk instrumentation not unlike what you might hear from Orphaned Land. Nearly the entirely of “Amata Immortelle,” not to mention, which is aimed rather directly at La Scala rather than La Wacken.\n\nTo listen to Turilli / Lione Rhapsody in the spirit it was likely intended is to allow oneself to be swept up in the sort of drama that feels bigger than music. Fabio Lione’s voice is as pure and acrobatic as ever, with each lyric lovingly fretted over with the dynamically overwrought intonation of a Shakespearean actor. And yet, although the players pursue virtuosity in their individual performances, as a whole, the work is meticulous, measured, and without visible seam.\n\nThe way we react to art nearly always says more about the audience than the author, and it is often counterproductive at best and disingenuous at worst to attempt to divine the motives of artists. Nevertheless, for all his otherwise stodginess, Immanuel Kant may have been on to something in his discussion of aesthetic judgment. He posited the notion that the proper way to render an aesthetic judgment was to propose the subjective universal validity of that judgment. Philosophically speaking, the notions of subjectivity and universality ought to be logical opposites: If something is subjective—based on the position and perspective of a specific subject—how can it be universal? And if something claims to be universally applicable, how can it be mediated through an individual-level subjectivity?\n\nMuch smarter nerds than me may like to parse ol’ Kant until the kows come home, but from this idea of his I take the following position: art proceeds from the hope (if not the expectation) that it can be universally appreciated. Even the ugliest, most ostensibly antisocial art you can imagine carries within it a kernel of presumed universality. If art did not retain the possibility of reaching everyone (even if it can never be certain to reach any particular one), I might hazard a claim that it wouldn’t be art. It might be self-reflection or self-indulgence or psychoanalysis or any other number of things, but art exists first as a calling out to the world. It cannot proceed but from an originary destruction of solipsism.\n\nBrazen though it may be, this discussion is about Turilli / Lione. This is a big-hearted, democratic album. If you don’t like it, or if its exuberance sours you, or if it strikes you as somehow dishonest in comparison to all the supposedly brave truth-telling of the caustic sounds you prefer to saturate yourself with, then this is all well and good but I will repeat that the way we reach to art nearly always says more about the audience than the author. Whether you interpret that as indictment or opportunity does, too.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that power metal is very much like coal or sadness or an ostrich: it simply exists. Have you ever seen an ostrich? Do you suppose that titanically real thing gives two shits what you think about it? The ostrich exists outside of any of your attempts to explain or dispute it. There seems to be a tendency among some people who otherwise consider themselves open-minded listeners to write off power metal. Power metal, you will be pleased to note, does not care. And if you think I chose an ostrich as metaphor because of its head-burying behavior, then buddy, you are wrong. Power metal is constitutionally incapable of embarrassment or mortification. Power metal is rubber and you are glue: that is, two things that have absolutely no causal impact on each other.\n\nOn Zero Gravity, there be no dragons, either in the sense of fantastical lyrics or boundary points indicating beyond which, who can say. No thing is outside the purview of this music. “Decoding the Multiverse” pulls a snaky, modern crunch riff into the arena with a tumbling piano fantasia and a powerfully building chorus out of the Avantasia playbook. A classic two-thirds ratio brings in a brilliant little vocal section that pirouettes like Night at the Opera Queen before opening out onto one of Turilli’s most fiery guitar and keyboard spotlight passages of the album.\n\nZero Gravity pulls in layers of choristers and string players to make its case, but the core is always the bewitching interplay between the forthrightly romantic melodies of Lione’s vocals and Turilli’s melodic leads, and the hairpin-tight modernism of the drums and electronic enhancements. Just before four minutes in the title track, Turilli unleashes a keening solo section that quite clearly presents the score to an imaginary film score. Actually, ‘imaginary’ is a term that forecloses the possibilities here. Not only is it possible that the band has quite fully considered each song the telling of an intensely visual narrative, but it’s also quite likely that in listening, you cannot help but summon entire technicolor universes in your mind’s eye.\n\nIf you’re asking yourself, “So, is this good or bad?” kindly go suck an egg. Go outside. Read a book. Climb a hill. Learn a skill. Zero Gravity is exactly what it is. It is 100% itself. Can you say the same? The album’s only demerit is “Demons and Angels (D.N.A.),” an absolutely abysmal song that grafts the most neoclassically pompous chorus of the album awkwardly atop a highly polished core. It’s not quite like the song exists in a universe totally separate from the rest of the album, but that the jarring contrast between the song’s different elements—something that actually works in favor of several other songs—is amplified to such a degree that it is impossible to enjoy the song. Quite literally, you are a monster if you enjoy this song. It is the Platonic ideal of Bad."
