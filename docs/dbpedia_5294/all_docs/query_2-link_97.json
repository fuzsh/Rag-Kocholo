        "text": "Desolation press quotes:\n\n“Denver’s Khemmis feature two PHDs in their ranks, and make doom that’s smart, forward-looking and expertly executed… Doom with brains? Take a trip to theKhemmis.” KERRANG (UK)\n\n“Denver doom merchants blend darkness with melody… Khemmis deliver a spin on the downtuned and distorted with an ear for a hook.” LOUDER THAN WAR (UK)\n\n“Doom metal with melodies so rich they’d make Maiden look twice? Khemmis are toying with one of metal’s most ancient formulas.” METAL HAMMER (UK)\n\n“This Denver quartet’s six-track follow-up to 2016’s Hunted is a thundering blend of NWOBHM riffs shot through with sternum-shuddering doom.” PLANET ROCK (UK)\n\n“Masters of epic, melodic and elegantly intricate doom metal anthems, the Colorado quartet have an accessible streak a mile wide, even at their most extreme… Khemmisare redefining progressive doom with a grandiose flourish.” PROG (UK)\n\n“Desolation not only matches Absolution and Hunted, it outstrips them both… inDesolation they have produced an album I fully expect to be listening to twenty years from now.” ZERO TOLERANCE (UK)\n\n“The record just sounds gorgeous with both its actual songs and the way in which they’re delivered to the ear, resulting in a wholly brilliant ride for metal fans new and old.”WHAT CULTURE (UK) ‘Best Metal Albums Of June 2018’\n\n“The Denver doom metal band’s third album is streamlined, expansive, and melodically sharp.”PITCHFORK (US)\n\n“Desolation is a big, slick, fun record, with endless hooks and songs that are bombastic, compelling, and straight-out fun.” BANDCAMP (US) ‘Album Of The Day’\n\n“With “Desolation“, KHEMMIS has now joined the heavy metal elite, and the band’s future is now brighter than ever.” POPMATTERS (US)\n\n“It’s immediately apparent from the opening of ‘Bloodletting’ that they’ve come prepared to exsanguinate all challengers. These are just beautifully crafted pieces that represent the very best of what can be done with the genre.”DECIBEL (US) ‘Top 40 Albums of 2018’ #9\n\n“Three albums in, doom metal quartet Khemmis have their internal engine working at maximum efficiency and power having spent the previous six years fine tuning and oiling their sound. The music on their latest full-length, Desolation, shows no sign of strain or effort… It’s a seamlessly constructed work that purrs and snarls, with the edges fleshed out by small interludes of respite and beauty.” CONSEQUENCE OF SOUND (US) ‘Top 25 Metal + Hard Rock Albums of 2018’ #12\n\n“Following two albums of crushing, teeth-grinding doom, Khemmis made for the big tent with Desolation: a heady display of heavy-metal showmanship, and the Denver band’s most accessible release yet… the foursome are masters of long-form songcraft, approaching each cut here as its own standalone, Sabbathian epic.”REVOLVER (US)\n\n“Melancholic melodies, penetrating solos, booming strings and wistful vocals. This soundcheck win might be surprising for KHEMMIS, but it’s more than deserved!” METAL HAMMER (DE) ‘Album Of The Month’\n\nVideos:\n\n“Isolation” Official Video: https://youtu.be/ xZd2liHm8P8\n\n“Bloodletting” Official Visualizer: https://youtu.be/ P073izSb9bQ\n\n“Flesh To Nothing” Guitar Play Through: https://youtu.be/ avbDazC6q7Y\n\nDesolation Trailers:\n\nPhil’s Non Metal Influences: https://youtu.be/ MStrj-UVl-U\n\nZach’s Non Metal Influences: https://youtu.be/ epX6xKjm_gE\n\nDan’s Non Metal Influences: https://youtu.be/ j_7eJIHjEh0\n\nPhil Pendergast Record Collection: Thin Lizzy: https://youtu.be/ UakD4wjfkGU\n\nPhil Pendergast Record Collection: Hip Hop and Rap: https://youtu.be/ sWzlIEPznvc\n\nPhil Pendergast Record Collection: Miles Davis: https://youtu.be/ KROZKu8mwmA\n\nPhil’s Record Collection: Hendrix, John Fahey & Sonny Boy Williamson: https://youtu.be/ ABq0BLvCg8c\n\nPhil Pendergast Record Collection: Judas Priest: https://youtu.be/ sTQGPQ_FPuQ"
