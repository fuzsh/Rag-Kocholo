        "text": "Tag: Nuclear Blast Records\n\nLIVE REVIEW: IMMOLATION, IMPERIAL TRIUMPHANT, and MORTIFERUM – Huntington, WV 02/19/22 @ The Loud\n\nHuntington, WV is a town that’s not always been conducive to a strong underground scene. Over the years it’s tried several times. There’s just always something that keeps it from fully developing. With that said, on occasion there are some choice tours and good shows that roll through. On Saturday, Feburary 19, 2022, Immolation came to town with Imperial Triumphant and Mortiferum on the second stop of the tour. Mortiferum was a nice surprise of the night. Hearing them via recording, they’re heavy enough and do possess a sound that is much more of what one might refer to as … Continue reading LIVE REVIEW: IMMOLATION, IMPERIAL TRIUMPHANT, and MORTIFERUM – Huntington, WV 02/19/22 @ The Loud\n\nISOLATION BREEDS POSITIVE CREATION: An Interview with Enforcer’s Olof Wikstrand\n\nBack in 2019, Sweden’s Enforcer released their fifth full-length studio LP Zenith to a waiting audience worldwide. They were coming off of what was arguably their most accomplished album to date with ‘From Beyond’. The tour for that album, albeit … Continue reading ISOLATION BREEDS POSITIVE CREATION: An Interview with Enforcer’s Olof Wikstrand\n\nDESTRUCTION: Four Decades On and At the Top of Their Game\n\nIn the 1980s, who in the hell really thought that the thrash metal style would still be alive and ripping in the year 2019? Most speed/thrash pioneers concur that in the earliest days they never really thought about the shelf-life … Continue reading DESTRUCTION: Four Decades On and At the Top of Their Game\n\nFEATURE REVIEW: ENFORCER – ‘Zenith’\n\nIt was starting to feel like it was taking forever for a new Enforcer album to follow up their 2015 benchmark release From Beyond. After four years they’ve returned with Zenith which proves to be a potential watershed moment, for … Continue reading FEATURE REVIEW: ENFORCER – ‘Zenith’\n\nFEATURE REVIEW: OVERKILL – ‘Live In Overhausen’\n\nThe event that is Overkill’s Live In Overhausen actually took place in 2016 while the band was on tour in Europe. Their decision to record the performance in Oberhausen, Germany had personal significance to the band and their early history, as they recorded their first live video in that part of the country, so it made good sense to do it there. Since Horrorscope was their biggest selling release ever and its anniversary was at hand, it seemed like a given to revisit that one for a special event. Upon further consideration they determined that a lot of bands have … Continue reading FEATURE REVIEW: OVERKILL – ‘Live In Overhausen’\n\nTwo Classic Albums, One Night in Germany\n\n“Artists are tortured, nobody understands them. I know that people can understand me, and I can understand them, too. I think being called an ‘artist’ means that you’re doing something that’s supposed to be open to interpretation. We’re talking about something that you’re listening to. Either you like it or you don’t like it, and if you do like it, then we understand each other. So I don’t like being thought of as an ‘artist’.” Continue reading Two Classic Albums, One Night in Germany"
