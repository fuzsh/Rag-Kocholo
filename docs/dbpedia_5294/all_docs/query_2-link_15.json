        "text": "Nuclear Blast was founded in 1987 by Markus Staiger and is currently home to such acts as Opeth, Machine Head, Decapitated, Slayer, Symphony X, Suffocation, Sabaton, Rob Zombie and a ton more. Now in an interesting development, Believe Digital has acquired the majority stake in the company for what Music Business Worldwide says is likely eight figures. This purchase allows Believe to become a distribution partner for Nuclear Blast.\n\nHere's what Thorsten Freese, Managing Director of Believe Digital Germany, had to say about the acquisition.\n\n“Nuclear Blast has the most prestigious roster of hard rock and metal artists in the world. These artists are served by a team of passionate and dedicated staff.\n\n“Because we share this passion and dedication, we are very excited to establish this alliance with Nuclear Blast and service the careers of their artists and develop new and exciting talents with their team.”\n\nAnd here's what Staiger had to say.\n\n“We have known for a long time that we needed to respond to the changes in the music industry. We are also aware that we need to move away from the idea of conventional collaborations in order to continue to be a world-class force, especially in the digital market.\n\n“We have found the ideal partner with Believe Digital to lead Nuclear Blast and its artists into the future.\"\n\nThere does not appear to be any personnel change at Nuclear Blast at this time."
