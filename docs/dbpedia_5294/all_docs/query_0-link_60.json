        "text": "Universal has a very short amount of patience. I waxed poetic a few threads ago about a band in my area getting dumped after only 6 weeks after their CD was released.\n\nWell...the label was Universal. Good luck...the band I'm referring to had to break up in order to avoid owing them several hundreds of thousands.\n\nAll in all I suspect the thread was more intended to announce to the world you'd been signed than to garner any real advice...sounds like their (and your) minds are already made up.\n\nAs far as the other bits of advice...all true...and a music lawyer is a must. If you don't have one, don't sign. If you don't have an agent...I still wouldn't sign. Getting signed by a major don't mean squat...actually nowadays even worse...especially with a label like Universal.\n\nTruth is. If you are amazing. They will back you. If you are average, you will be frustrated. but {censored} it. It is a major label. All of you need to get together with as much money as you can muster, and get an attorney who specializes in the music biz. They will be savvy enough to see what category you fall into.\n\nread this :\n\nthat's the link i was gonna post to help you figure out how you're gonna get {censored}ed, and, if you're smart, how to stop it from happening. there's a lot of {censored} on there that you can not buy if you choose not to.\n\nfor instance...i would not pay someone to come in and calibrate the *studio's* equipment. that is just thievery. there's other stuff, like catering, that you can do without.\n\nalso, if there's not a $50K buyout from a previous label, you can add that to the -$14K figure on the bottom line.\n\nbe smart, hire a lawyer before you sign a damn thing. if you've signed the intent contract, at worst, all you have to do is change the name of your \"corporation\" and keep the songs. re-marketing yourselves shouldn't be too hard.\n\nread this :\n\nthat's the link i was gonna post to help you figure out how you're gonna get {censored}ed, and, if you're smart, how to stop it from happening. there's a lot of {censored} on there that you can not buy if you choose not to.\n\nfor instance...i would not pay someone to come in and calibrate the *studio's* equipment. that is just thievery. there's other stuff, like catering, that you can do without.\n\nalso, if there's not a $50K buyout from a previous label, you can add that to the -$14K figure on the bottom line.\n\nbe smart, hire a lawyer before you sign a damn thing. if you've signed the intent contract, at worst, all you have to do is change the name of your \"corporation\" and keep the songs. re-marketing yourselves shouldn't be too hard.\n\nAnother thing you may want to try and add to the contract is what's known as the Keyman Clause, which basically states that if your A&R guy gets fired, you can leave the contract.\n\nafter reading through the WHOLE thread I know why:\n\n1) Timo Tolkki (Stratovarius) got into a psych. clinic shortly after the release of their first album with Sanctuary music (who when they signed the band offered them 1,500,000 eu I think)\n\n2) why the lady (A&R) resigned from the company a couple of years after!\n\nI was always thinking about all that {censored} with the music business and I am still not sure if I would love to do that or play in a band as a hobby..\n\nis it so bad with the major metal labels too?? nuclear blast, roadrunner, metal blade, century media (haven't heard good words about them) etc.etc.??\n\nthey are a business, and you have to watch your own ass. they arent looking out for yours, and if you dont they will have no regrets in screwing you without lube. take the necessary precautions and if they see youre too much to deal with (they cant screw you cuz youre too smart) then they wont bother probably (be too expensive for them).\n\nand you CAN produce quality recordings at home, and yes you CAN get good mastering software to take care of the compression and loudness aspects. me and my buddy did our whole album ourselves...recorded it, mixed, mastered, did the artwork, had it produced. some of it could be better, but with what we had i can easily say im proud of it and it sounds better than some of the crap ive heard out there today.\n\npromotion is hard though, and getting people to buy the album is even harder. were working on getting a band together, but thats hard to do as well. LOL im just happy to have a CD out, with my name on it, and we didnt have to go into debt to do it either\n\nbe carefull about getting strategically signed.\n\nsome labels will sign bands just to kind of \"get them out of the way\" if they feel that you might be compatition for another band on their label.\n\nthey may sign you, let you record the album, and then shelf it for years until the competeing bands hype has died down. and by then who knows how your album will do.\n\nyou don't hear about this happening much, but it does happen.\n\nI did some photos for a guy this happened to, they kept him hanging on and on.. Then eventually he said {censored} it I want out. They said sure.. go.. but you have a contract and this album you recorded that we didn't release.. This album you spent the last 10 years writing.. Its OURS.\n\nUnless you want to pay out the contract..\n\nEarlier in the thread it was mentioned the practice of signing an artist and shelving them just to \"get them out of the way\" in case if they were to be signed by another label and provide competition. I'm not totally sure, but I think this may have happened to Capt Janks, the phone prankster associated w Howard Stern - IIRC he was signed just to keep him from competing w the Jerky Boys (who made phone-prank records back in the 90's).\n\nI may be wrong, but the point is that the practice does happen!\n\nYa know, this is a good thread of musicians criticising the record companies - but is there anyplace where we could find the other sides POV?\n\nWould a record company person say something like: \"these so-called musicians learn a few chords and how to write some generic lyrics and they suddenly think that if some record company would only put their record out there, that people would magically open their wallets and buy it\". ???\n\nI'd like to hear the record companies POV.\n\nThe majors are essentially dodgy banks, basically loan sharks who are willing to lend money in the sub sub-prime market to a bunch of 18 yr olds without a pot to p*ss in, in the vague hope that 1 in 50 bands they sign will make it big for them and the others they can right off against tax liabilities.\n\nOne of the greatest things that technology and the internet has done is to make these w*nkers pointless. The days are gone when you had to spend $50,000 to record a 3 track demo in some disgusting tuberculosis ridden 16 track analogue studio just so some A&R bloke who wouldn't know his as*hole from a hole in the ground, can either tell you to f*ck off or sign you and do nothing with you for 3 years.\n\nHopefully the majors are starting to wake up to this...if they don't then they're all gone within 10 years.\n\nBtw good luck, hope it all works out and everyone's advice so far seems pretty sound...getting a decent lawyer is without doubt the best investment you'll make.\n\nAnother thing to do is MAKE SURE YOU DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO KEEP YOUR SR RIGHTS, even if it means taking a lower royalty rate. If I remember right that's what U2 did back when they got signed and look where that got them. Also, make sure to take note of the term and any options. They may want 5 albums from you, but what it really means is 1 album with 4 options, meaning they'll put out your first album, and then at their discretion they can require you to record another 4 and they may not even release any of them."
