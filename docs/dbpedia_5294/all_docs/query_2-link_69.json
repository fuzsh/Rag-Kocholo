        "text": "TEETH have signed a new deal with Nuclear Blast Records. The ferocious Canada-based metalcore outfit will be compiling four of their previously released tracks as an EP titled “575” on October 28th. That effort will be issued on a limited run of clear cassettes.\n\nSpeaking of their new label home, the band collectively stated:\n\n“TEETH has always been – and always will be – a passion project for us. A visceral creative outlet not to be marred by outside influence or external pressure to achieve anything but creating music that we enjoy. We promised ourselves that if the opportunity to work with a label ever arose, they’d have to share our artistic vision, and ultimately want to help TEETH connect with everyone who’d listen.\n\nWhen we began talking to Nuclear Blast at the beginning of the pandemic, it became immediately apparent they checked those boxes. Growing up listening to bands like Hatebreed, Ministry, and Slayer and eventually discovering artists like Nails, it felt like Nuclear Blast understood everything TEETH stands for, and aspires to be.\n\nSo, with that said, we’re excited to finally announce that we are now part of the Nuclear Blast family. We’re just getting started.”\n\nThe band’s vocalist Blake Prince added:\n\n“We are extremely thrilled to finally announce that we’ve signed a deal with Nuclear Blast Records. This has been something we’ve had to keep close to our chest throughout the pandemic and we’re eager to get to work. To be a part of this legendary roster is an honor and a perfect home for TEETH.\n\nIdeally, your label is a partner. Human beings with a strong passion for growing artistic culture and individuality, who believe in you and are working hard to help facilitate our vision. We feel confident that the cooperation with Nuclear Blast will help bring this band to the next level.”\n\nPre-orders for “575” are available here.\n\n“575” track listing:"
