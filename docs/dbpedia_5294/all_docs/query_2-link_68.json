        "text": "MASSACRE Sign Deal With Nuclear Blast Records\n\nApril 20th, 2021\n\nFlorida-based death metal band Massacre have signed an album contract with Nuclear Blast Records, confirming this development on April 20th, 2021.\n\nRegarding the deal, vocalist Kam Lee said: “I would first like to give my appreciation to Nuclear Blast for signing Massacre. It’s a long time dream of mine to be a part of the metal family under the Nuclear Blast flag and I am even more so grateful that it’s with my signature band. We have a lot of plans for the future of Massacre, and what a great place to be making such a proper return other than one of the best independent metal labels in the world.”\n\nBassist Michael Borders added: “It’s a privilege at this point in our careers to be associated with the big name in metal labels. We did our best to make this a proper Massacre release, an authentic sounding representation of a band we started over 30 years ago.”\n\nMeanwhile, Nuclear Blast’s U.S.A. general manager Gerardo Martinez stated: “For many of us at Nuclear Blast, Massacre is one of our favourite bands, and instrumental in the formative years of death metal and with their debut album alone. It paved the way to many artists to follow. It’s an honour to be working a brand new record with Kam Lee on vocals after nearly 30 years!”\n\nThe band’s as-yet-untitled fourth full-length studio album is slated for release in Autumn 2021.\n\nMassacre’s line-up is as follows:\n\nKam Lee (vocals, Akatharta / Nattravnen / ex-Bone Gnawer)\n\nMike Borders (bass)\n\nRogga Johansson (guitar, Paganizer / Rib Spreader / Revolting / Johansson & Speckmann / Dead Sun)\n\nJonny Pettersson (guitar, Ashcloud / Gods Forsaken / Wombbath / Nattravnen / Henry Kane)\n\nScott Fairfax (guitar, Memoriam / As The World Dies)\n\nBrynjar Helgeton (drums, Crypticus / Johansson & Speckmann / Just Before Dawn / Gods Forsaken)"
