This includes all Eluveitie albums, Toumas Holopainen - Lise and times of Scrooge, and probably some others (finding them as we speak, Epica seems fine, if their Spotofy collection is rather small, if it should include most of their albums, they're gone for me as well - I don't have them saved in my library, so I can't even see them enymore).\n\nCan anyone tell me what is going on?\n\nBTW, my country is Poland.\n\nEDIT: inb4 clear chache: tried Windows client, android and web player. All the same.\n\nThis might be a regions listening issue with the label? Also sometimes things come back in a few days so keep an eye out in case this is just licensing expiring and awaiting the renewals to come through. Although I do not have the time to do a look up of all that material or I might be able to narrow some of it down.\n\nAll music made available to the spotify service is up to the labels, artists, and/or their representatives. Please go and have a read over on this detailed post here\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Help-Other-Partner-Devices/Music-FAQs-You-want-to-read-this-first/t...\n\npoint 5 covers about the issue with missing music/artists. Thank you!\n\nSpotify adds all music available to them. Unfortunately, sometimes the artist/label don’t want certain tracks/album on\n\nspotify, which is why they can’t be found.\n\nYou can read more about missing music in the\n\nmusic FAQ.\n\nTake particular note of the fifth point.\n\n@OviiiOne\n\nSomeone not wanting certain tracks/albums on spotify is understandable when the decision is made before hand. It's not understandable when half of your playlist on premium account dissappears! I stopped my premium account few months ago and was intending to renew it starting January, but won't do that, because I lost my trust in this service\n\nI've been paying Spotify subscription also because of access to music from bands or albums that are now gone. I can't help to have a feeling that at least part of that money I paid to spotify is now wasted and I have to go and purchase all those missing albums from other services or shops. Could have done that in the first place!\n\nIt's ok when service as Spotify has a limited database with some bands or labels not participating in it at all. You see what you get before you pay any money. Removing already existing music is completely different and turns Spotify into really poor service. And is also sort of a cheat\n\nI just noticed this too. All my playlists, songs, etc are unplayable.\n\nJUST GREAT.\n\nThanks Spotify, you just lost a couple of customers I guess.\n\nTime to buy songs and copy them the old way again.\n\nI knew something is fishy about streaming.\n\nAnd I guess Google Music just got a new customer.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nUpdate: I have checked Deezer, Google Music as well.\n\nAll the Nuclear Blast records are \"not available in my location\".\n\nJust what the hell happened?\n\nWhy there are no news about this?\n\n(At least now I know that Google Music got a better app/interface.. and a higher price tag.\n\nBut besides the point, what the hell happened?)\n\nMy guess is - the local distributor in your country demanded the removal of this music from Spotify because they... can... And they did.\n\nThis is essentially \"promoting piracy\", since I don't see the point in paying for music that I've benn streaming for the past couple of years and paying for in \"instalments\". Once more, the industry proves it is not ready for the age of Internet.\n\nNot every album or song is available on Spotify.\n\nThe availability of songs on Spotify is up to the artist and their music label.\n\nSpotify has no control over what content is available.\n\nSometimes it is only available in certain countries, while access is blocked to others.\n\nYou can find out more information here\n\nMattSudaSpotify Star\n\nHelp others find this answer and click \"Accept as Solution\".\n\nIf you appreciate my answer, maybe give me a Like.\n\nNote: I'm not a Spotify employee.\n\nYou can check it out by using API...\n\nFor example: http://ws.spotify.com/search/1/track?q=wintersun to search for Wintersun - it will find multiple copies of that song/artist/album/whatever. Under territories tag, you can see permitted countries for this specific copy. It is interesting, that under one copy of song is CZ (country code of Czech Rep.), but I still can't see in in Spotify player...\n\nedit: I can see Eluveitie again.."
