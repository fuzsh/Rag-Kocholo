        "text": "Nuclear Blast Entertainment Forms – NYC & LA Offices Headed by Ex-Roadrunner VP Monte Conner\n\nNuclear Blast, the renowned German metal label, has announced a new U.S. partnership with former Roadrunner Records VP of A&R Monte Conner. The new venture is a record label called Nuclear Blast Entertainment (NBE), and will have offices in New York and Los Angeles.\n\nNBE will share most of its major operations with the existing U.S. branch of Nuclear Blast, which is based in L.A. The new offshoot will announces its first signings in the months to come. Nuclear Blast proper is home to a roster of some of the world’s top metal acts, including Meshuggah, Testament, Nightwish (Europe-only), Children Of Bodom, Anthrax (Europe-only), Dimmu Borgir, All Shall Perish, Epica, Exodus and Accept.\n\nConner became available after being among the dozens of casualties of a Roadrunner restructuring, which began in April following the completion of its sale to the Warner Music Group. The A&R exec is well known throughout the hard rock and metal scene, owing to a 25-year stint at Roadrunner Records where he signed artists including Slipknot, Sepultura, Machine Head, Trivium, Fear Factory, Stone Sour, Type O Negative, Soulfly, Coal Chamber, Life Of Agony, Biohazard, DevilDriver, Deicide, Rush and Gojira.\n\nPlease note: When you buy products through links on this page, we may earn an affiliate commission."
