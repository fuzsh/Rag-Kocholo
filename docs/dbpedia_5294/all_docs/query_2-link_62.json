        "text": "BEYOND THE BLACK have signed to Nuclear Blast Records!\n\nAfter hitting new heights through the release of 2020’s excellent Hørizøns, now, the German symphonic-meets-power metal band have taken the next step in their career by signing with metal label behemoth Nuclear Blast Records. The first call of action for the band following the signing with be their European and two UK show co-headline run with labelmates AMARANTHE in early 2022.\n\nSpeaking about the signing, the band says, “after an exciting and successful time with our former record label, we are ready to open a new chapter of BEYOND THE BLACK today. As a band we stand together stronger than ever and in Nuclear Blast we have found a powerful label partner with a great team who are going to join forces with us to bring BEYOND THE BLACK to a new level. Also, making the decision for the world’s biggest metal label feels somewhat like coming home!”\n\nMarcus Hammer, Managing Director of Nuclear Blast GMBH, states, “we’re thrilled to welcome BEYOND THE BlACK as a new member of the Nuclear Blast family. We’re talking about an exceptional artist with talent and passion that raises huge hopes into their meteoric rise only being the start of something bigger. We couldn’t be any happier to be an important partner for BTB from now on and support the band on their future path – we’re looking forward to a fantastic time and a promising future for both partners!”\n\nJens Prueter, Head of A&R Nuclear Blast Europe adds, “we are very proud to welcome BTB to Nuclear Blast Records. It’s amazing what they achieved so far: top 5 entries in the German charts, TV appearances, sold out shows and are regular guests at the biggest festivals. A success that also caused envy but not everyone is as talented as Jennifer Haben and her band, and not everyone has such a spirit of hard work. It’s a pleasure to follow their strong vision and it’s a great addition to the Nuclear Blast artist roster where they will be in good company with the likes of NIGHTWISH, EPICA, AMARANTHE or BATTLE BEAST. Special thanks to their manager Benjamin Küfner for making this happen. Let’s explore new horizons!”"
