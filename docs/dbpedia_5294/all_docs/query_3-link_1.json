        "text": "Frontiers Records is pleased to announce the worldwide DIGITAL ONLY release of REVOLUTION RENAISSANCE “Ep” on June 2nd 2010.\n\nWhen Timo Tolkki decided to leave Stratovarius, the finnish band that was able to bring back into the spotlight the style of Neoclassic Hard Rock and Metal in the late 90’s, the entire scene was took by storm by the release of Revolution Renaissance debut album “New Era” in June 2008.\n\nTimo wanted to start up a brand new band that he saw as a the logical progression of the Stratovarius legacy. To launch Revolution Renaissance he opted to call some special guest on vocals including Edguy and Avantasia singer Tobias Sammet and former Helloween singer Michael Kiske, along with Pasi Rantanen. The lineup on the album was completed by Mirka Rantanen on drums, Pasi Heikkilä on bass and Joonas Puolakka on keyboards.\n\nTolkki originally composed all the songs included on the debut album for Stratovarius, but after he left, he thought he needed to get the songs he wrote out anyway. This EP goes back to that tumultuous period in Tolkki’s life and presenting the album track “Heroes”, three songs in acoustic versions, one song in the version sung by Tobias Sammet as opposed to the original vocals appeared on the album from Pasi Rantanen and offers as a special gift three original Stratovarius demo versions of the songs that ended up on the Revolution Renaissance album.\n\nRevolution Renaissance “Ep” tracklisting includes:\n\nHeroes (album version); I Did It My Way (Acoustic Remix); Angel (Acoustic Remix); Keep The Flame (Acoustic Remix); We Are Magic (Tobias Sammet version); Last Night On Earth (Stratovarius original demo); Revolution Renaissance (Stratovarius original demo); Heroes (Stratovarius original demo).\n\nThe Ep can be purchased via i-Tunes, eMusic, Amazon, Spotify, Napster, Nokia and other fine digital shops."
