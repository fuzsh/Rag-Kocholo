        "text": "58\n\nLegendary death metal act, Massacre, has signed a record deal with Nuclear Blast Records!\n\nNearly four decades after their unholy conception, masters of Floridian death metal Massacre have found a diabolical union with Nuclear Blast Records, with plans to release their fourth studio album, and first in seven years, later this year.\n\nNuclear Blast’s U.S.A. general manager Gerardo Martinez, who signed Massacre, says: “For many of us at Nuclear Blast, Massacre is one of our favorite bands, and instrumental in the formative years of death metal and with their debut album alone. It paved the way to many artists to follow. It’s an honor to be working a brand new record with Kam Lee on vocals after nearly 30 years!”\n\nCommenting on the signing, vocalist Kam Lee states: “I would first like to give my appreciation to Nuclear Blast for signing Massacre. It’s a long time dream of mine to be a part of the metal family under the NB flag and I am even more so grateful that it’s with my signature band. We have a lot of plans for the future of Massacre, and what a great place to be making such a proper return other than one of the best independent metal labels in the world.”\n\nBassist Michael Borders adds: “It’s a privilege at this point in our careers to be associated with the big name in metal labels, we did our best to make this a proper Massacre release, an authentic sounding representation of a band we started over thirty years ago.”\n\nJoining Lee and Borders for the new album are guitarists Rogga Johansson (Paganizer), Jonny Pettersson (Gods Forsaken, Wpmbbath, Henry Kane) and Scott Fairfax (Memoriam, As The World Dies), along with drummer Brynjar Helgeton (Crypticus, The Grotesquery)."
