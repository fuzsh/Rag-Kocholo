Teletubbies, the toddler-sized creatures with antennas on their heads and names such as Dipsy and Laa-Laa, have been sold to DHX Media Ltd. as the Canadian company seeks to cash in on a burgeoning children’s market.

BBC Worldwide, the commercial arm of the British Broadcasting Corp., and Ragdoll Productions sold their joint venture that owns the rights to the Teletubbies and pre-school shows such as “In the Night Garden” and “The Adventures of Abney & Teal” for 17.4 million pounds ($27.7 million), the companies said in a statement today.
