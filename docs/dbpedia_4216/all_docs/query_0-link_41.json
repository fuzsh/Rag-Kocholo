Cassill revved up the sponsorship yesterday, racing in a nabi-branded car at season opener the Daytona 500. The sponsorship has a strong philanthropic element. For every Fuhu-sponsored race, Cassill will donate 5% of his race team’s prize money to benefit nabi Inspire, Fuhu’s charity that offers direct support to families living with Autism. Fuhu will match that donation with an additional 5% for a 10% total that could reach $350,000. Cassill \"is a talented driver that exhibits real potential to be a top 10 NASCAR driver; however, we chose to sponsor Landon’s number 40 car because of his impeccable character and dedication to co-invest in supporting and creating awareness for autism,\" said Fuhu CEO Jim Mitchell.\n\nEditor’s Note: Break out the champagne!
