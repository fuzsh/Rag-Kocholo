        "text": "DHX Media, or Decode Halifax Media is a Canadian media production, distribution, and broadcasting company. Formed in 2006 by the merger of Decode Entertainment and Halifax Film Company, the company is a prominent producer and international distributor of children's television programming; its library includes that of Cookie Jar Group (which, in turn, consisted of the libraries of Cinar, DIC Entertainment, and FilmFair), DHX Media UK (Talkback, Thames, Boundless, Hare&Tortoise, Euston Films and Newman Street), Epitome Pictures, Ragdoll Productions, Nerd Corps Entertainment, Studio B Productions and WildBrain, along with that of DHX's two predecessors, Decode Entertainment and Halifax Film Company themselves. DHX is the largest independent owner of children's television programming in the industry.\n\nIn 2014, DHX entered the specialty television industry with its acquisition of Family Channel and three other Disney-branded television networks from the former media company Astral Media.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe DHX name derives from the combination of the names Decode and Halifax from the 2006 merger between Decode Entertainment and Halifax Film Company. Studio B Productions was acquired by DHX Media on December 25, 2007. On March 25, 2008, DHX Media acquired Bulldog Interactive Fitness. On September 8, 2010, all related subsidiaries were rebranded under the label DHX Media. On September 14, 2010, DHX Media acquired WildBrain.\n\nOn August 20, 2012, it was announced that DHX Media would acquire Cookie Jar Group for $111 million, a deal which would make DHX the world's largest independent owner of children's television programming. The acquisition of Cookie Jar Group by DHX Media closed on October 22, 2012.\n\nOn November 28, 2013, DHX announced that it would acquire four children's oriented specialty television channels from the former Astral Media for $170 million, consisting of Family Channel, Disney Junior, Disney Junior (French), and Disney XD. The networks were being sold as a condition of Bell Media's 2013 acquisition of Astral Media; its purchase of the networks marks DHX's first foray into television broadcasting. The deal was approved by the CRTC on July 24, 2014, and closed on July 31, 2014.\n\nIn April 2014, DHX Media acquired Epitome Pictures, the producers of Degrassi, but Epitome did not own international distribution rights. In November 2014, DHX Media has acquired a library of children’s and family television series, feature films and television specials, including international distribution rights to Degrassi, Instant Star and The L.A. Complex series, from Echo Bridge Entertainment and its subsidiaries. The acquisition adds approximately 1,200 half hours to DHX’s existing library of more than 10,000 half hours, further cementing its position as owner of the world’s largest independent library of children’s and family shows. The international rights acquired for Degrassi, The L.A. Complex, and Instant Star, apply to approximately 600 half hours of content in DHX’s catalogue and consolidates all rights for these series under DHX ownership, following its acquisition of producer Epitome Pictures earlier this year. In total, the acquired slate consists of outright ownership of 117 titles, and distribution rights for an additional 34 titles. Other series in the deal include Lunar Jim and Beast Wars: Transformers, and Emily of New Moon.\n\nIn December 2014, DHX Media will acquired Nerd Corps Entertainment which will be finalized on December 24.\n\nSubsidiaries and divisions[]\n\nDecode Entertainment[]\n\nDecode Entertainment was established 1997 by Neil Court, Steven DeNure and John Delmage.

After the DHX rebranding on September 8, 2010, the studio is now credited as DHX Media/Vancouver in closing credits and uses DHX Media's generic production logo. The Studio is behind the 2007 remake of the 1960s animated series George of the Jungle, the PBS Kids series Martha Speaks, and more recently, Hasbro Studios' My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and Pound Puppies, as well as other shows that broadcast on YTV in Canada and various networks in the United States.\n\nWildBrain[]\n\nWildBrain (stylized as W!LDBRAIN) is an entertainment company that develops and produces television programming, motion pictures, commercial content and licensed merchandise.

It later relocated to Montreal and began producing children's television programming. The company became embroiled in scandal, and was bought out in 2004 by a consortium led by Nelvana co-founder Michael Hirsh, and its name was changed to Cookie Jar Entertainment (later amended to Cookie Jar Group). Cookie Jar was sold to DHX in 2012, and was renamed \"DHX Cookie Jar Inc.\" as a result. Cookie Jar held a library consisting of 6,000 half-hours of content; in addition to its own productions, it also included those of the British FilmFair and the American DIC Entertainment. Among its best-known properties are Caillou and Inspector Gadget.\n\nRagdoll Worldwide[]\n\nRagdoll Worldwide was a joint venture between Ragdoll Productions and BBC Worldwide that manages and exploits Ragdoll programming including Teletubbies, Brum, Rosie and Jim, Boohbah and In the Night Garden.
