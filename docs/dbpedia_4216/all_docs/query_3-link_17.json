And if you‚Äôre anything like us, you‚Äôve just finished off the final episodes on your 2023 watchlists and are already seeking out fresh content to fill your downtime in 2024.\n\nBut of course, thanks to the plethora of series and streaming services available, deciding which shows to watch and which to skip can be a strangely daunting task. For fans of Canadian television, the search can be even more challenging; Canadian shows ‚Äì despite their award-winning calibre ‚Äì often don‚Äôt receive the same level of hype as major American hits.\n\nLuckily for you, we‚Äôve curated a list of five Canadian TV shows that we can‚Äôt wait to watch in 2024. We highly recommend you add these to your watch list. Let‚Äôs dive in!\n\nTop 5 Canadian TV Shows 2025\n\nLaw & Order Criminal Intent: Toronto\n\nThe iconic ‚ÄúLaw & Order‚Äù franchise is finally expanding into Canada! Set to premiere on February 22 on CityTV, ‚ÄúLaw & Order: Toronto ‚Äì Criminal Intent‚Äù brings the beloved procedural drama format to the streets of Toronto, promising a fresh Canadian perspective on crime-solving.\n\nThe show features an all-Canadian cast and will lean heavily into Toronto‚Äôs cultural nuances, landmarks, and politics, with some stories pulling directly from the city‚Äôs real-life news headlines. The first trailer for the series even highlights a story about a mayor embroiled in a crack-smoking scandal ü§î. We won‚Äôt be skipping this one!\n\nPremiere: February 22nd\n\nWhere to watch: CityTV\n\nOne More Time\n\nPremiering on January 9th, the new CBC original ‚ÄúOne More Time‚Äù centers around D.J., a hearing-impaired manager of a used sporting goods store who is forced to deal with an offbeat team and clientele. According to CBC, the show is inspired by the real-life experiences of the show‚Äôs creator and star, D.J. Demers, reflecting what his life might have been like had he continued his teenage job at a similar store instead of pursuing other dreams‚Äã.\n\nFun fact: TFS Acting Instructor John Tench makes an appearance in Episode 3!\n\nPremiere: January 9th, 2024\n\nWhere to watch: CBC/CBC Gem\n\nLate Bloomer\n\nSet to premiere on Crave on January 19th, ‚ÄúLate Bloomer‚Äù is one of the most highly-anticipated comedy series coming out of Canada this year. The show stars comedian and YouTuber Jasmeet ‚ÄúJus Reign‚Äù Raina and is inspired by his real-life experiences as a first-generation Indo-Canadian grappling with sudden online popularity.\n\nExecutive-produced by Canadian comedian Russell Peters, and delving into the chaotic world of content creators and influencers, ‚ÄúLate Bloomer‚Äù guarantees a fresh blend of humour, relevance, and social commentary. Be sure to check it out!\n\nPremiere: January 19, 2024\n\nWhere to watch: Crave\n\nThe Great Canadian Pottery Throw Down\n\nPremiering on February 8th, ‚ÄúThe Great Canadian Pottery Throw Down‚Äù boasts a unique premise: a reality show that pits ten of Canada‚Äôs most talented potters against each other in a fierce pottery-making competition. Adding a touch of celebrity, Canadian actor Seth Rogen steps in as both the executive producer and a guest host, lending his star power and comedic presence to this niche reality offering.\n\nComplementing Rogen, Jennifer Robertson of Schitt‚Äôs Creek fame takes on the role of full-time host. With Robertson‚Äôs renowned wit at the helm, the series promises to be an engaging experience for both dedicated art aficionados and newcomers to the pottery scene. This launch is particularly well-timed, considering the exploding popularity of pottery.\n\nPremiere: February 8th, 2024\n\nWhere to watch: CBC/CBC Gem\n\nGeek Girl\n\nInspired by Holly Smale‚Äôs bestselling book series, ‚ÄúGeek Girl‚Äù is a new Netflix original about a neurodivergent girl named Harriet who ‚Äì despite her geeky ways ‚Äì finds herself thrust into the glamorous world of modelling. Much like the book series, ‚ÄúGeek Girl‚Äù is expected to resonate with a wide audience, particularly young viewers, as it deals with themes of growing up and self-acceptance.\n\nNetflix and Canadian media company Corus Entertainment have partnered to produce the series, commissioning a total of ten 30-minute episodes.\n\nPremiere: March, 2024\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n2024: A Banner Year for Canadian TV\n\nLooking at this list of brand-new original programming, it‚Äôs clear that Canadian television is set to have an exceptionally strong year in 2024.
