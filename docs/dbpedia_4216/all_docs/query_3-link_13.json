        "text": "Broadcasters sell air time to advertisers to earn revenue. TV broadcasters depend mainly on advertising revenue, with these exceptions:\n\nCBC gets most of its operating funds from Parliament\n\npublic educational television services get most of their funds from provincial governments\n\nspecialty services get about half their revenues from a part of the fee subscribers pay to their distributors\n\npay television and pay-per-view are financed entirely through subscription fees\n\nvideo on demand undertakings are permitted, by condition of licence, to advertise in programming only if it is acquired directly from an unrelated licensed Canadian broadcaster or from a related broadcaster that has also acquired the linear rights to the program\n\nBroadcasters donât have to air commercial messages, public service announcements or advocacy ads. But during an election campaign, broadcasters must follow the policies set out for federal, provincial and municipal elections.\n\nOn this page\n\nLimits to advertising time\n\nContent of advertisements\n\nTypes of ads\n\nQuestions and complaints\n\nLimits to advertising time\n\nThere are limits to the amount of time broadcasters can reserve for advertising. These limits are :\n\nDiscretionary services: must not broadcast local advertising (unless otherwise authorized)\n\nOn-demand services: may only carry advertising under special circumstances\n\nTelevision stations: no limits\n\nCommercial AM and FM radio stations: no limits\n\nCBC radio networks: prohibited from carrying advertising except for programs that are available to networks only on a sponsored basis\n\nThese time limits don’t include: the promotion of Canadian programs, public service announcements, political ads, product placements within a TV program and virtual ads (i.e. they don’t include advertisements superimposed over a program).\n\nAdvertising on community-based television and radio\n\nThere are also limits on the amount of time that community-based television and radio services can air commercials:\n\nCable community channels: don't carry commercial advertising, but can air sponsorships and contra advertising\n\nCommunity-based, low power TV and digital services: 12 minutes of local advertising per hour\n\nCampus radio stations: 504 minutes per week; up to 4 minutes per hour\n\nCommunity radio stations: no limits\n\nFor more information, consult the Policy framework for community-based media (Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2002-61). and the Campus radio policy (Public Notice CRTC 2000-12)\n\nContent of advertisements\n\nThe CRTC doesnât directly regulate advertising content, except advertising to children and alcohol ads.\n\nChildren's advertising\n\nChildren's advertising includes:\n\nany paid commercial message carried during childrenâs programming\n\nany commercial message thatâs directed to children (defined as those under 12 years of age), whether itâs during childrenâs programming or not\n\nBroadcasters must adhere to the Broadcast Code for Advertising to Children published by the Canadian Association of Broadcasters in cooperation with Advertising Standards Canada.\n\nIn Quebec, commercial advertising aimed at persons younger than 13 is generally prohibited. See the Office de la protection du consommateur.\n\nAd clearance\n\nAdvertising clearance is the process of previewing commercials to make sure they meet applicable standards. Advertising Standards Canada provides the service, but clearance is only mandatory for childrenâs advertising.\n\nAdvertising for specific products\n\nAlcohol\n\nBroadcasters can advertise alcoholic beverages, but must follow the New regulatory framework governing the broadcast of alcoholic beverages advertising (Public Notice CRTC 1996-108)\n\nThe CRTC also expects broadcasters that carry advertising for alcoholic beverages to report annually on how many alcohol-education messages they broadcast.\n\nDrugs, medications and condoms\n\nHealth Canada has standards for advertising these products.\n\nTobacco products\n\nRadio and TV broadcasters canât advertise tobacco products. Health Canada is responsible for Tobacco Control.\n\n900 numbers\n\nThese ads are aimed at adult audiences, so broadcasters limit the frequency and time of day these ads come on. The thinktv Clearance has guidelines for these commercials.\n\nThere are also Consumer safeguards to protect consumers from unforeseen charges.\n\nTypes of ads\n\nInfomercials\n\nA TV infomercial combines entertainment or information with the sale or promotion of goods or services in a program thatâs more than 12 minutes long. Broadcasters must clearly inform viewers that infomercials are paid commercial advertising.\n\nOn commercial radio stations, an advertisement thatâs more than 3 minutes long must be identified as a paid commercial, by clear and prominent announcements, before and after the segments. The announcement must be repeated when the program breaks, and before returning to the program.\n\nLocal promotions on US channels\n\nYou may see a promotion for a Canadian show on a US TV station. Both US and Canadian stations set aside some advertising time (1 to 2 minutes per hour) for “local availabilities.” Distributors use this time for their own purposes, and Canadian distributors air promotions for Canadian broadcasting services.\n\nVirtual ads during TV sports programs\n\nVirtual advertising places advertising within a TV program, not during a normal commercial break. Virtual ads are often used for large sports events.\n\nYou may see a computer graphic of an advertiserâs name in the scene, or you could see a computer-created \"virtual\" billboard for TV audiences in a place where a real billboard might appear.\n\nSponsorships and contra advertising\n\nA sponsorship is when a community program acknowledges that it has received direct financial assistance. Contra advertising is when a community program acknowledges that it has received free goods or services to use in connection with producing the program.\n\nQuestions and complaints\n\nIf you have a question or complaint about advertising, go to How to make a broadcasting complaint.\n\nFalse and misleading ads\n\nBroadcasters must meet the Canadian Association of Broadcastersâ Code of Ethics on advertising. If you think an ad is false or misleading, contact Advertising Standards Canada or the Competition Bureau at Industry Canada.\n\nRelated links\n\nBroadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2023-306 and Broadcasting Order CRTC 2023-307\n\nOTA television policy (Public Notice 2007-53)\n\nLocal Availabilities policy (Public Notice CRTC 2006-69)\n\nBroadcasting Distribution Regulations, sections 42 and 43\n\nSimultaneous Programming Service Deletion and Substitution Regulations\n\nLoud TV Commercials\n\nSuper Bowl TV commercials – why are the ads different?"
