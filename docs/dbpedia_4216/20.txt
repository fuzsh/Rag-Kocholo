Ragdoll Productions is a British television production company located in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, that produces children's programmes. It was founded in 1984 by Anne Wood, who had previously made similar programmes for Yorkshire Television and TV-am. Among its most famous productions are Teletubbies, Rosie and Jim, Brum, Boohbah, Tots TV, In the Night Garden, Pob's Programme, The Adventures of Abney & Teal, Junior Eurovision, and Twirlywoos.

Ragdoll Productions is owned by Ragdoll Ltd,[1] which in 2006 formed a joint venture with BBC Worldwide, Ragdoll Worldwide, to sell and license the company's programmes outside the United Kingdom. On 16 September 2013, Ragdoll Worldwide was sold to Canadian production company DHX Media for £17.4 million (or USD$24,457,135.58).[2] DHX Media owns the rights to all the Ragdoll programming and the shows are no longer connected to the company with the exception of Pob's Programme.Template:Citation needed Despite Ragdoll Worldwide being sold, Ragdoll Productions themselves remain as an independent company and still continue to make shows to this day.
