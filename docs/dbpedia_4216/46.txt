Halifax's DHX Media has acquired 12 British television series for kids, including 365 episodes of Teletubbies, through the purchase of Ragdoll Worldwide.

The Canadian children's programming company says it paid the equivalent of about $28.4 million in cash to buy Ragdoll Worldwide from BBC Worldwide and a group that includes Ragdoll's founder, Anne Wood.

Also included in the deal are 100 episodes of In the Night Garden, 52 episodes of Teletubbies Everywhere, The Adventures of Abney & Teal, Dipdap and Brum.

The Teletubbies franchise has been a worldwide hit, broadcast in more than 120 countries including Canada.

DHX Media says it expects the deal will add to its earnings per share starting in its 2014 financial year. Its other programming includes Caillou, Inspector Gadget, Johnny Test and Yo Gabba Gabba!.

DHX Media owns and handles the distribution rights for a large library of children's content.
