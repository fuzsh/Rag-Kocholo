Dries van der Lof was not only a Grand Prix driver, he raced in the 1952 Dutch GP, but he is also one of the founding fathers of historic racing in the Netherlands. By the mid-1970s he owned a stable of now priceless race cars. In order to have fun in local historic races, he and a couple of mates sought out a Ferrari 250 SWB each (they were cheap then!) and restored them, so they could compete on equal terms. The battles were legendary!

That Ferrari SWB is still in the van der Lof family and Driesâ€™ son Alexander entered it in SuperSixties at Zandvoort to share with his daughter (and former F3 racer) Shirley. The V12 sounded as good as ever, and the speed was quite impressive. Alexander finished sixth on Sunday.
