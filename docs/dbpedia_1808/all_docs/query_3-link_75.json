        "text": "Car Danny is sitting in is the Ascari car. Grant car was already painted cream. Ferrari had made a deal with Grant to provide Johnnie Parsons with Euro single seater rides later that year. As Ferrari was busy trying to qualify, they didn't have time to help any of the customers. The situation was so bad that they had to fly chief engineer Lampredi over with bigger carbs in his luggage.\n\nThis inattention led to a rift between Grant and the Ferrari people and the deal was undone. The Grant logo on the red car was probably early in the process and after the pissing match, came off. BTW, the Indy regulars tried to talk the Ferrari people into using mag wheels, but they wouldn't do it. They must have forgotten how Shaw broke a wire wheel while leading in a Maserati in 1941. It's a shame because Ascari could probably have been in the first 5 based on his fuel consumption which would have allowed at least one less pit stop.\n\nMauro was not serious about qualifying, but was there to show off his new toy to his buddies. He was a Pikes Peak specialist and was saving his car for that event.\n\nHoward Keck's crew had to choose between their new Kurtis roadster and the Ferrari. They chose the latter and would have won the race except for a failed steering box very near the end. Frank Coon, later of Travis & Coon, worked for Keck and went to Italy to pick up the Ferrari and learn how to work on it. The Kurtis was so much faster they had no choice. After Vuky failed, Troy Ruttman won the 52 race, but it was the last win for an upright dirt car. From then on it would be roadsters until Jim Clark won in 1965.\n\nI did a piece on these cars in Forza 24 (August 2000)\n\nI have uselessly tried to identify the towed Ferrari showed on one of the previous posts starting from the following assumptions:\n\n-the towing car is a Studebacker 1953/54\n\n-the last edition of mentioned Mexican Road race is the 1954 (quote from memaerobilia site \"This is Dad's new Studebaker coupe getting ready to tow an open wheel Ferrari (from The Bronx) \"down to Texas for Mexican road race\" I guess someone was going to pick it up in Texas and deliver it the rest of the way.\")\n\n-the ferrari should be one of the 375 indy entered on 1952 500 miles\n\n-the ascari'375 on November 1953 was officially in Italy and it was rebuild/modified and renamed 0388 (the towed car is completely different)\n\n-it was modified most probably by Raceway Bronx Garage NYC for the Mexican Road Race (carrera Panamerica) according pictures owner'description' even if there is no trace of such a ferrari either in 1953 or 1954 entry list\n\nDo anyone have more information/details?"
