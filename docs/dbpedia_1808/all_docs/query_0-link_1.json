        "text": "Originally posted by T54\n\nWell Gentlemen, since I am one of \"them\", I will explain to you how this works:\n\nA prefix like \"von\", \"de\" or \"di\" simply means.... \"from\" and does not warrant a capital except in the following circumstances.\n\nOriginally, such names only meant that you were not only \"from\" the place (city, town or castle) of your name, but...owned it, generally because the land was given to you by the local tyran (king or emperor or what-have-you) to reward you for your merits as you were knighted because you broke someone's head with a single blow of your favorite supercharged Durandal sword. Many members of the old nobility acquired such \"fiefs\" (I.E. property) and added the names of the newly conquered territories or said locations behind each other, plus the granted title. As an example, Bertrand, marquis de la Monneraye, comte de Saint-Remi, baron de Saint-Jacques etc. as they acquired such property, by force or by reward.\n\nThe revolution of the late 1790's abolished accumulated and often un-deserved nobility privileges, and the names were retained but no longer meant much for the ones with their previous land and fortunes confiscated by the new popular governments. In the 19th century, many snobs BOUGHT such names to look more grand than they really were, often purchasing such names from the destitute nobles themselves. And often, these nouveau-riche grand bourgeois CAPITALIZED the first letter, since as everyone knows, if a little is good, more of it is better.\n\nIn the USA, nobilite was abolished to a point where immigrants are still today being stripped of any retained titles even if purely symbolic as they apply for their citizenship. Silly as swearing that you are not a communist, but a clear establishment of basic equality as per the constitution.\n\nSo to conclude, the correct spelling of the prefix is ALWAYS correct in lower case, and it is indeed, Elio de Angelis, Richard von Frankenberg, Luca Cordero di Montezemolo and in the same line of thinking, le Mans and not Le Mans. But when you CALL such a person by name, you only call the NAME, not the prefix: \"Good morning Mister Montezemolo, good morning Mister Frankenberg.\"\n\nAnd this is the way it is supposed to be, so when you visit Charles March, future Duke of Richmond, make sure that you write your introduction to the Duke of Richmond and not the Duke Of Richmond, because that would be gauche.\n\nWould you ask someone to fetch something From the cellar?\n\nRegards,\n\nT54\n\nAKA P de L, Count de P, Viscount de M, de C and another couple of hundred localities long gone and for the better I am sure."
