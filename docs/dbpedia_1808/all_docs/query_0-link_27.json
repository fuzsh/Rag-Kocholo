        "text": "Kathryn Mohror is a computer scientist in the Parallel Systems Group in the Center for Applied Scientific Computing (CASC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). Kathryn serves as the Deputy Director for the Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) program at LLNL and as the ASCR Point of Contact for Computer Science at LLNL. Kathrynâ€™s research on high-end computing systems is currently focused on I/O for extreme scale systems. Her other research interests include scalable performance analysis and tuning, fault tolerance, and parallel programming paradigms. Kathryn has been working at LLNL since 2010 and is a 2022 fellow in the Oppenheimer Science and Energy Leadership Program and a 2019 recipient of the DOE Early Career Award.\n\nKathryn's current research focuses primarily I/O performance and portability for HPC. She leads both the Unify project, developing scalable file system support for in-system storage on HPC systems through UnifyFS, and the Scalable Checkpoint/Restart Library (SCR) project, an R&D100 Award-winning multilevel checkpointing library that has been shown to significantly reduce checkpointing overhead. Additionally, she leads the IOPP project, funded by ASCR ECRP, that is working towards fundamental understanding of the needs of current and emerging HPC I/O workloads and developing support based on that understanding.\n\nKathryn holds several leadership roles in the HPC community. She is a Co-Chair of the Administrative Steering Committee for PMIx, a portable interface for tools and applications to interact with system management software. She was the General Chair of the IEEE Cluster 2021 conference, serves as the IEEE Cluster Steering Committee Secretary, and serves on numerous other steering, organizing, and review committees for HPC conferences and workshops. She was the Lead for the NNSA Software Technologies Portfolio for the U.S. Exascale Computing Project (ECP) (2019-2023), Co-Chair for the PMIx Administrative Steering Committee (2018-2022), Lead for the Tools Working Group for the MPI Forum (2013-2019), and served as the Scientific Editor for LLNL's Science & Technology Review in 2018."
