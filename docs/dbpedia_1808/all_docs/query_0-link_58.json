        "text": "DeVorkin:\n\nI'd like to begin by asking you a little bit about your background, your family life. When and where were you born?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI was born on the 13th of June, Friday the 13th, in 1930, in Dubuque, Iowa. My parents and I lived there for something like six months, and then my father was transferred to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I grew up until I was 12. Then, because my father's parents had become fairly elderly, it was decided that it would be a good thing if we moved to the place where they lived, which is on a mountain top in central Arkansas. The mountain is called Petit Jean, and it's outside of the town of Morrilton, Arkansas, where my grandparents lived and my father had been raised.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was the occupation of your father up to this time, especially when you moved to Tulsa?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHe was a public accountant, working for a company, called Central State Power and Light Company. I guess I don't know the actual titles, but essentially, he was the company's top auditor. He had worked for them already for a few years before I was born, and was transferred from one office to another, ultimately to Tulsa. I believe Tulsa was the main office of that company. He continued to work for them until 1940, and then he had a medical problem with his tailbone, such that he couldn't sit in a chair any longer for the length of time he had to; and of course, that was right at the end of the Depression.\n\nThat job had been a very good one during the Depression; it was a well paid job. I remember he made $250 a month, which was probably quite a large amount of money by normal everyday standards in those days. At any rate, sometime about 1940, he quit that job and leased and operated a service station and parking lot in downtown Tulsa. From there, we went down to Petit Jean. He was actually in partnership with my grandfather in a ranching activity.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIn Tulsa, where you left when you were 12, did you have any contact with the service station? Did you work there at all?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, sure. I worked there on weekends, but obviously not during the week when school was on. During the summers I worked there as well. In fact, I was the guy that ran the parking lot, which consisted of collecting the money when people drove in.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you have any contact with fixing the cars or anything?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNot so much, although my dad is a mechanically-oriented sort of a fellow. He did do quite a little bit of auto repair as part of that activity, and the service station had a fairly complete mechanical shop in it. I guess a machine shop would be the right way to say it. Our garage at home was full of all sorts of machinery and so forth. My dad loved to do woodworking, lathe turning, wood turning and things like that.\n\nI remember, some years earlier I had had chicken pox, and we were quarantined. And so my dad couldn't go to work for two weeks or something, and so during that time he built a whole bunch of beautiful walnut furniture, and he handrubbed it with boiled linseed oil. That smell still is one of the smells from my childhood (laughs). So that was where I first learned to work with tools, and it was kind of a tradition in all my family. My grandfather, my father's father, was, I guess in those days they would be called a jack-leg mechanic, or a shade-tree mechanic.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was the first term?\n\nWestphal:\n\nJack-leg mechanic. Or shade-tree mechanic, maybe was the more common use.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo you had had contact with machines, the idea of building things.\n\nWestphal:\n\nMechanical things, yes.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou mentioned to me when you were in Washington that you had an early interest in astronomy as an amateur. Did this develop while you were in Tulsa?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, that developed actually after we moved to Arkansas. The school system was very grim, by my parents' perception, and properly so. So the first year that I was there, I went to the local school on Petit Jean, which was a classic one-room schoolhouse with, I don't know, 30 or 40 students. It was clear that, having come out of a fairly large city public school system, that it was just a total waste of time. So the next year, I commuted each day to Morrilton, a local town. That was a miserable business, because of the commuting enterprise. I had to leave home at five in the morning, and didn't get back until six in the evening.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you commute by school bus?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, it was more complicated. I rode my bicycle for three miles. I then rode with a lady who was a school teacher in that same school in Morrilton, in her car for another 10 or 12 miles off of this mountain, where we both then caught the school bus and rode the other 15 miles or so into school. So that was clearly not a viable way to be going to school. The next year, when I would have been in the 9th grade, the last grade of junior high school in that part of the world. I then moved to Little Rock, Arkansas during the school year, where I lived with a lady who was recently widowed, who was a friend of the family.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou were not with your parents at that time?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat's right, I roomed and boarded there. The deal was that she would furnish room and board, if I would do all the yard work and take care of the chickens; and she had two or three dogs and so forth, you know. So it was an extremely nice deal for me, and she didn't get hurt by that, I think. But you know, there was a certain amount of just being nice to me involved in all that. And so I was there then the last year of junior high school and the three years of high school. I can remember quite vividly how I first became interested in astronomy. I had kind of a broad general interest like, I suppose, everybody does.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid that come from your parents, or your school, or what?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh, I don't know. There always was in my family a curiosity about the world, and so that was just part of it. But it wasn't any isolated sort or specialized sort of curiosity about astronomy. But I remember I was a great fan of the library. The first time I was aware that a person's name in a newspaper meant anything specially was from the local librarian in this little town of Morrilton in the Carnegie Library — you know about Carnegie Libraries, obviously? The thing that really got me started in being interested in more technical or intellectual kinds of things was this Carnegie Library, along with probably millions of other Americans. That's got to be the best amount of money that ever was spent in this country — the money that Andrew Carnegie spent building those libraries all over the country, an incredibly important investment.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThe librarian, was she someone special?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, I don't remember a name or anything. I don't think she was anything all that special, but she somehow had noticed that I had taken out of the library over the course of a year or so every book there was about aviation. Why she picked on that, and discovered this by going through the records, I don't know. I suppose there weren't all that many books, maybe 20, so it wasn't all that big a deal. But somehow she told the local newspaper that I had read every book in the library on aviation. At any rate I was used to going to libraries and using libraries. And I remember that I was wandering about in the stacks of the public library in Little Rock, not the school library, and I came across a little book called, AMATEUR TELESCOPE MAKING,* which had been published by \"Scientific American\" in the early 30's.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIngalls was the editor.\n\nWestphal:\n\nIngalls was the editor; that's right. And I came across this book, and I sat down to read this thing in the library. In the beginning chapters there was a description of how a reflecting telescope worked. Well, that was a totally new idea to me. I remember, it took me a little while to understand how that would work, how the optics of that would work. It took some effort on my part. It was my beginning introduction to learning about optics, in fact; and that was probably in either the first or second year in Little Rock. It was probably in my first year in high school.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDo you recall whether it was Volume 1, 2 or 3?\n\nWestphal:\n\nIt was Volume 1, yes. And so, that was just utterly fascinating.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you check it out?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, I'm sure. Well, no, see I was in Little Rock, so there was nobody there but Mrs. Kanis, the lady I was staying with, who had no interest in anything like that at all. I'm sure it was the first year I was in the high school, and it was a good high school. That in fact was for many years the most famous high school in the world. That was THE Little Rock High School of the integration cases much later on. And so, it was an exceptionally good high school for that part of the world. It had a very high percentage of people that went to college and so forth. And so I was very, very lucky in that sense.\n\nAt that school, in the first year, I took a science class and guess what, there was a science teacher! He organized a science club, so of course, I had to be in the science club. And there, I ran into two or three other people who were interested in telescopes. So we were kind of at the same level. In fact, I was a great hero, because I had found this wonderful book that told all about how to do this.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo there was no one more advanced than you there.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThere was nobody at that particular spot in that place who knew any more about it than I did.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat about the science teacher himself. What was his name and his background? *Albert G. Ingalls, Ed. Amateur Telescope Making (3 volumes). Munn and Co. 1935 (many editions, 1926 on... .\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh gee, I couldn't tell you his name. I would certainly recognize it if I heard it. He was an elderly man by my standards, which meant he was probably 50 or more, at that time. I have no idea what his background was, but he was very, very good at turning kids on to science, all kinds of science, although he was not, I think, the biology teacher. As I remember it, there was more than one science teacher in the school. It was a fairly large school for those days. I don't remember, some hundreds of students, I'm sure, maybe even as many as a thousand.\n\nAt any rate, I think he taught primarily physics. Yes, I'm sure, now that I think about it, because there was also later, when I took chemistry, a separate chemistry teacher, who was a lady; and she was an extremely competent teacher. In fact, I had a number, looking back at it, of really very competent teachers. The math teacher was a lady, and she was extremely good. At any rate, that led to a project of the science club to build a telescope for the high school.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOh, was that something you pretty much instigated?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, this group of three or four of us did. I don't know that I was particularly the ring leader. And it turned out ultimately that two of us had a long enough attention span to pull this off (laugh). So somewhere we had read that it was wiser to start with a small telescope mirror to make your first one than with a big one. Of course, there was no money really anywhere in the system for that, and so we were begging and scrounging. The two of us decided that we would go to the nearest glass shop and see if we could lay hands upon some scrap of plate glass thick enough to make a mirror out of.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYour cohort, what was his name?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHis name was J.W. Tisdale.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNone of these people went on to become scientists or astronomers?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, I don't know. You lose track of people, and I have many times, I'm sure, like you, wondered what happened to this person and that one. I last knew of him in about 1961 or '62, at which time he was an electronics engineer, working, I believe, for Hewlett Packard, or somebody. He lived in Half-Moon Bay just south of San Francisco, and worked somewhere in what is now called Silicon Valley, and I've lost track of him since that time.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat did you finally end up with, with this telescope?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWe went to this glass shop and the guy took pity upon us, and cut out two or three 6-inch disks of glass of one-half inch thick or so, and just gave them to us, out of some scraps that he had from some window or door. It must have been a door, I suppose. And we went off and learned how to build telescopes. The very first one just worked like a charm, and we built, over the course of a year or so while we were learning how, several mirrors, of different focal lengths and so forth. I remember one of them had a very, very long focal length.\n\nThe tube of it was probably 12 feet long, because that was as long a piece of lumber that you could get in one piece. And the tube was four pieces of, I suppose, 1 x 8, or something like that, all nailed into a box, and the thing supported on some 2 x 4 yoke type mounting, all made out of wood, of course.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHow did you get the mirror silvered?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, I remember, ATM 1, of course, talked only about silvering, because that was written before the days of aluminizing. I believe that we finally convinced ourselves that that wasn't going to work well. It was too unsafe a process. You remember, it was a dangerous process; at least, the common one with Rochelle salts was. I seem to remember we did some threshing around, trying to find some other way. Ultimately, anyway, we were to the point where people around us were convinced that this could really happen. I remember, the first thing we did was that we used the thing on the moon without any mirror on it at all, any mirrored surface at all, and got incredible views of the moon, which impressed everybody. And as I remember, Tisdale's dad finally sprung for the money to get the thing aluminized, and we sent it off to a guy, whose son, I guess, is still in business. Leroy Clausing, he was called, in Skokie, Illinois, as I remember it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. He still advertises.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, his son; I think it is Leroy M. E. Clausing, now. But at any rate was the only place around that had ads, and of course, we saw that in \"Sky and Telescope,\" I'm sure. We, of course, had long since discovered that. We ultimately built an 8-inch telescope for the school, the mounting and everything, and put it on top of the bandstand, which was in a tower; and it was up on the roof of that. It turned into a monster, because just everybody in the school wanted to come and use it. We, the Science Club, ended up having to have somebody up there every night when it was clear, you know, and it was eating up all our time.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat year was this?\n\nWestphal:\n\nBy then, that was in 1947 and 1948. As I remember the telescope was finished in my senior year, which was 1947-48. graduated from that high school in May of '48. I think, one of the more impressive things was that about four or five miles away from that school, there was a night club. It was kind of on a hill, and it had a parking lot that was on this hill, of course, everybody was looking at everything in sight. And somebody looked over at that parking lot, and we could read the license plate numbers on the cars.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's pretty good.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat really impressed everybody. Well, if you do the arithmetic, it isn't as impressive as it sounds, but it was really impressive to everybody in sight that you could really do that. There was a lot of laughter about it; how we'll keep track of who was out there, and so forth, none of which, of course, actually ever happened.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHow was your interest in astronomy developing? Were you still looking for more telescopes to build; or were you interested in an astronomical problem?\n\nWestphal:\n\nIt was a two-prong thing, as that sort of business is. One is just amateur telescope making, which is not astronomy. I mean, that's optics, or telescope making, or whatever. All of us who were involved in it were really very much interested in that feature of it; but we were clearly interested in the astronomy. Tisdale and I both became members somewhere about that time of something called the ALPO.* It was a thing that was run —you may remember the guy's name that ran it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWalter Haas?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWalter Haas; that's exactly right. It was run by Walter Haas. Of course, it was a big deal for kids like us to be in some kind of a real formal organization. We flooded Haas with sketches of Jupiter, my god (laughs). I have no idea how many we sent; but you know, every night it was clear and Jupiter was there, we were sketching and sending. He sent out a little mimeographed thing. As I remember, a time or two one of our sketches got in that; and that was a big deal, too. So we were interested in the astronomy part of it, too, but strictly as amateurs, in that sense. None of us at that time imagined we would ever be astronomers, or be associated with astronomy in a professional sense. That was logical, of course, because astronomy jobs were really rare then. If you think they are bad now, they were hopeless then.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThere were no major observatories in your area? * On: Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers.\n\nWestphal:\n\nNowhere near. In fact, that 8-inch was the biggest telescope in the state at that time. That was also another big deal. It made a fair mount of commotion around town. In fact, we had public star parties, too. That was a big problem, because it was on top of this building, and you had to crawl up a rung ladder, a metal ladder on the side of the building, on the inside of the building, fortunately, to get up there. It wasn't made for anybody to be up there. Of course, it was a lousy place to put a telescope, because of all the shaking in the building, and if anybody would move, the image would just go out of sight. But it was great for the time. There was no clock drive or anything on the telescope. It was really a nice thing. A lot of people had a lot of enjoyment out of it. I continued to make telescope mirrors. It's been some years since I built the last one, but I finally built a 12-inch. It was the biggest one, I think, that I built.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWere you still in high school?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, no, by that time, I was out working in the oil industry.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIs there anything else you would like to cover in your early home life, something you feel we should talk about?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, of course, I don't know what your interests are in particular, but I don't think there was anything especially outstanding. It is clear to me now that a major influence on me, that had given me the interests that I have, really came from my dad, whose curiosity is just as bad as mine is. If you go some place, he's got to drive down every road there is. I sit here looking at the map of the big island of Hawaii, and there's something like 1800 miles of roads on that island. And the first time I took him over there, we went down every mile of it. (laugh). He was not happy until, over the course of two weeks, we had driven down every conceivable road we could get our vehicle onto. It was his curiosity about the world and what's going on and how things work, and so forth.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid he ever have a chance to look through your telescope?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes! Oh sure, that was always a big deal through the years.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid he help you with how to build the mounting?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI'm sure we discussed at great length how to do it. I don't remember any specific instances but I'm sure there was a lot of discussion. In fact, I'm sure that I rescued various pieces of hardware from the ranch to do that. I mean, there were all kinds of metal parts around.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDuring the summers, did you do any fix-it work on the ranch, any general maintenance?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWhen I say ranch I'm probably using a word that's a little deceptive. The main enterprise was to raise cattle, but it was not a ranch like you would think about in Texas or some place like that. It was also an activity involving a certain amount of row crops, and particularly in the earlier years, dairy activity. But it was all pretty much at a subsistence level. It was never a very economically successful activity. During the time when I was in junior high and high school, it was during the war, and my dad stayed on the farm and didn't work in the war plants. Money was really always a very serious problem; and so I was expected, essentially to furnish my own support while I was in high school, during the part of the year when I was there. Now, that wasn't as bad as it sounds, in that I had very little need for cash money. I rode my bicycle back and forth to school inside of Little Rock. It was only a couple or three miles down the street, so that was certainly no problem. And of course, all my food was taken care of, but there was always a problem about having enough clothes, etc.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhich you had to pay for?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, I'm sure my parents did that; but a lot of the clothes were hand-me-down clothes of one sort and the other, and clothes from various places.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you have brothers and sisters?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, I was an only child.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nLet me ask you further questions about that period. Did your father go to college?\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, he went to a college. My father's side of the family were Missouri Synod German Lutherans back through history. Missouri Synod is just one of the branches of the Lutheran Church. It's still called the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, I think. It's a very conservative, almost reactionary branch of the Lutheran Church these days. It was not so extreme in those days, perhaps, as it is now. But at any rate, he went to a college in Winfield, Kansas, called St. John's College, which was a church college. It was not a seminary. It was a vocationally-oriented college, as I understand it. That's where he got his training as an accountant. He learned his trade in that school, and he did graduate from it. Now, it was, as far as I know, a four-year college, but I guess I don't absolutely know that, as I think about it now. It could conceivably have been a two year thing. I'm not sure.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat of your mother’s education?\n\nWestphal:\n\nMy mother's education, as far as I know, was only in high school, and she then went to some sort of a business college, also in Winfield. And that's where they met each other. She was born and raised in a little town in North Central Oklahoma called Braman. It's just south of the Kansas border, and due north of Oklahoma City; the nearest town of any size is Blackwell.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat about the prospects of your going to college? Was there any question that you would go to college?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, there was a very serious question, because my parents certainly didn't have money enough to support that. So it was entirely up to me as to what I was to do. I was certainly encouraged, but they were not in any financial condition to support that. After I got out of high school, I went back to Tulsa. I was never really happy in those years with Arkansas. I remembered the good old days in Tulsa, you know. Primarily because our economic status had really gone down a lot when we moved into this farm/ranch activity. So I went back to Tulsa, and the only job I could lay hands on quickly was a filling station gas pumping job. That only because six years before, my dad had contacts in that business, and still knew, I guess, a bulk plant operator or something, and he found me a contact from which I got a job to pump gas.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nI'm slightly confused about times now. You left Tulsa when you were 12.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, and went back when I was 18.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOh, so it was like six years.\n\nWestphal:\n\nSix, that's right, yes.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo you graduated from high school ...\n\nWestphal:\n\n...when I was 18.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAnd then you didn't go specifically back to Tulsa for college.\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, no, I went back to go to work. I went back because I wanted to be in Tulsa, it was very simple minded in that sense. I could clearly have gotten a job some place in Arkansas, but I really didn't like Arkansas. It was good memories that dragged me back. It was a fairly strong thing, as I think back on it. I remember, there was a magazine put out by the city of Tulsa, and I had an aunt and uncle that still lived in Tulsa. My aunt would send me this magazine in Arkansas. It was a monthly magazine and I remember just going through those magazines and thinking of the good old days when I was a kid there. So I went back there and stayed with a friend of the family's, George and Lyle Kelly, some people that lived a couple of doors down the street from where I had been raised.\n\nI stayed with them while I was working at the filling station. While I was doing that, I was looking for a better job all the time. Now, my uncle worked for a company called the Seismograph Service Corporation, whose headquarters were in Tulsa, and he was a technically-oriented person, rather than a management person in that company. He was kind of the brains of the place, the technical brains of the place, in some sense; or at least, was perceived to be. As I look back now, he probably wasn't as sharp a guy as he seemed to be at the time.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was his name?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHis name was William Pugh, W.E. Pugh. So, of course, I had close contact with him while I was there. And so he was watching for a chance for me to get a job in that part of the world, somehow. I went back to Tulsa in June of 1948, and it was in December, finally, or the end of November, some five or six months later, before an opportunity came for me to get into that company. And it was clearly through his contact, at least, that that happened.\n\nSo I then was hired to work on a geophysical exploration crew in the Panhandle of Texas, in a town called Spearman in the northern Texas Panhandle. I went to work for them on the 1st of December, 1948. I immediately got in trouble. Nobody told me how I was supposed to get there; all they told me was they would pay my fare. That didn't mean anything special to me, so I decided, a neat way to get there was on the train. Well, how do you get there on a train? First, you go to Kansas City and then you get on the Super Chief and ride to some little town in Western Oklahoma.\n\nI don't remember the name of that town right this millisecond. And then I discovered that there was a little one-a-day Toonerville kind of trolley train that went from that town in Western Oklahoma, a 100 miles or so to Spearman, Texas. So that's what I did. Nobody told me not to, and I got on this train and away I went. Actually, I guess I didn't go to Kansas City; I went to Hutchison, Kansas, which was the junction point, and got on the Super Chief, which dumped me out in this little town about three o’clock in the morning, this little town in Western Oklahoma, on the first day in December.\n\nIt was as cold as bloody Jesus, and there had been a big snow storm. So I got off the train and went into the station. I would guess that there wasn't anybody there at that time in the morning, but whenever the stationmaster came, he said, \"well, I don't know if the train is going to go. There is so much snow, we've been trying to get across there for three days.\" But, he said, \"we're going to try it, and so you can ride along and see what happens.\" So off we went.\n\nIn a few miles we came to this humungous snowdrift. There was a cut through a little hill and it was completely level with snow. But in front of us was — and this was still in the steam engine days — a steamer with a snowplow on the front, and he was burrowing his way through this thing. I had never seen anything like it. It was awesome to watch him do this, you know. Back up a few hundred yards, you know, and just go as hard as he could go, charging into it.\n\nIt would compact the snow, and go another ten feet or something, and finally pushed it through. So off we went. The tracks were all fouled up and we fell off the tracks a couple of times. Everybody got out with jacking bars and jacked this little Toonerville Trolley thing back up. It was what they called a motor car, I guess. It was a diesel thing with half a dozen rows of seats in the back, and cargo in the front, just like a big streetcar, essentially.\n\nAnyway, I appeared there, and the company people were just livid, because it had cost an extra $10 or so over what it would have cost to go on the bus. \"What kind of a dunce are you that you would do something like that,\" and so forth. Well, at that point I clearly was not going to go to college that fall, because it was already December. So I worked on through that winter, and I was transferred from crew to crew, as the style goes in that business.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was your specific responsibility?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI started out being something called a jug hustler, a guy that emplaces the little geophones, the seismometers along the surface, and wires them up. You know, the dumbest job on it, at 35¢ an hour. We were not covered by minimum wage. It was 35¢ an hour to begin, and we worked 60 hours a week, straight time. No, it wasn't straight time. I forgot that. It was called a sliding scale, after 40 hours, the number went down.\n\nYour wages went down, and the joke was always that at 60 hours, that sliding scale slid right out from under you. Not only did you not get time and a half, but you got the inverse. It's strange, looking back, how that could have been the way they did it. But it was done that way. At any rate, I ultimately became the helper to the man that handled the explosives, which was the normal chain of advancement as you became more experienced. Finally, I ended up that year being the rodman for the surveyor. It was along in there that I decided I really wanted to go to college.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was it that caused you to think that?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI think, primarily the fact that I could see that, without going to college, I was going to end up doing some grungy thing all my life. At least, it looked that way from that perspective. And it was clear to me at that point that a college education was a very important thing, if you were going to do something besides hustling jugs.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWas there any pressure to join the armed forces for the Korean War?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, see, this was '48, '49, and so that problem hadn't yet occurred. The Korean War started like the first of June in '50, and so by then I was already in school. Anyway, I was madly saving up my money at that point, when I got that job. I said, I'm going to go to college. I needed $220, as I remember, for tuition for the year at the University of Tulsa. I wanted to go to the University of Tulsa, because I was interested in this geophysics thing that I was doing, and they had a geophysics option, in the physics department. Of course, I could stay, or at least, I thought I could stay, and it did turn out that I could stay with these same people I was staying with before. I could room with them so that my living expenses would be tolerable; so really, what I needed to do was accumulate enough money to pay my tuition.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou weren't getting any money from your family; but neither were you sending money home.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat's right. Anyway, at the end of that next summer — this would be the summer of '49 — I had told Seismograph Service Corporation early in the summer that it was clear to me I was going to have enough money and that I was going to do this. So at the end of the summer at the appropriate time, I went back and enrolled as a freshman, and started at the University of Tulsa.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNo interest on the part of the company to keep you on as sort of a work-study part-time situation?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo. Well, that's not really fair. What they said, as I remember, was that if I did well this year, \"then maybe next year we will give you a part-time job while you are going to school, if you want it, but not this year. We want to see how you are doing.\" It was in the days when companies were a lot less, what's the right word, enlightened, liberal, whatever word you want to call it, as to their own best interests, as I would see it, anyway. This company was probably very progressive in spite of all this, in comparison with many other companies at that time. So I did start going to school. I found the school work very easy.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThis was in physics?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, as a freshman, I think you didn't have an option. As I remember, you didn't pick your option until you were a sophomore. But it was certainly in the context of engineering. I was in the Engineering School, which had physics in it as well. I, of course, don't remember any longer now what kind of courses were given, but in the freshman year they were undoubtedly a canned set of courses, which probably almost everybody took.\n\nAt least, everybody in engineering school probably took the same thing. It went very easily, and so after the first two or three weeks, it was clear to me that I could have a part-time job while I was going to school, and still be able to cope with it. There was a certain pressure from the people I was staying with that I get off my duff and earn some money so that I could contribute to my expenses, which was certainly reasonable. Their next-door neighbors were people who had also been our next-door neighbors when we lived in Tulsa.\n\nIt was the house between the house I was staying in and our original house. The people who lived in that house were named Gabbard. He was a buyer for a wholesale grocery in Tulsa, the Nash-Finch Corporation, I think it was called. We were talking about this, and he said, \"I tell you what, I can get you a job as kind of a jack of all trades in our place, in which you could work at night. We run 24 hours a day. You could work on Saturday, if you wanted. I will pay you a minimum wage,\" which was probably 35¢ still then, some small amount, but it was a finite amount of money.\n\nSo I started doing that, and very soon, I was working more than 40 hours a week. But it was an ideal kind of job. He really did me a great favor, because I could work entirely on my own. In fact, my first job there, I will vividly remember forever, was to sort through by hand a box car load of apples which were boxed. They were gorgeous big Red Delicious apples, wrapped in tissue paper, each one. The problem was that about a third of them were bad.\n\nSo, what I did was take these apples out of the cooler, open the box carefully so it could be put back together, go through and feel each apple and throw the bad ones away, and repack them into the box, generating a full box of good apples, which were then immediately sold the next day, so that they didn't go bad again; because they were going bad fast. So for the first two or three months, why, I with my own hands went through however many apples are in a freight car load. I always thought it would be fun to calculate how many that was. It was a completely independent job. It didn't matter when I came or went. It was an ideal thing.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAnd school work wasn't demanding the first year.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThe school year wasn't demanding in that sense. As I look back at it, it was not a good thing, because it should have been more demanding and I should have put more effort into it then when it was easier. As we'll come to later, the fact is that I worked 40 hours a week or more during all of college. That was not a positive thing. It would have been better if I had been in an environment where I didn't really need to do that, and I would have clearly gotten a lot more out of my education than I did.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you continue on with this particular company?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, I worked with this company, this wholesale grocery thing, just that one school year. Then the next summer, and it was already arranged that way, I went back out in the field again. By then, I had understood enough about what was going on, and became interested in electronics in the meantime, by an accident.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was the accident?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI had a little radio that I had bought while I was in the field that year between high school and when I started to college; and when I came back to college, there was something wrong with it, so I was fiddling around with it. I didn't understand the first thing about electronics or radios. .\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo you had no previous experience in electricity.\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, and I had no real interest in electronics. While I was still in Petit Jean, I was clearly very interested in electrical things, and I remember getting some bell wire, and somewhere I got some old telephone batteries and an old car battery that wasn't dead in all the cells. I strung wires all over, got a doorbell buzzer some place, you know, all of the simple-minded stuff; but you learned how electricity worked, about circuits, resistance and all of that stuff. So I had that kind of interest in my background, but I had never done anything with a radio. In those days, it wasn't electronics. It was radio, vacuum tubes and so forth, that was the only thing.\n\nThere was no television. Electronics was radio in those days. Somehow, I happened to mention this to a neighbor that lived across the street, a man* I had known when I lived in Tulsa originally *Norman Rector as a kid, and he was interested in electronics a lot, I recognized. He was interested. in hi-fi audio — I don't think the word even existed at that point. Well, he showed me how to realign the IF stages of this little tube radio. The whole thing was just magic, and that got me interested in radio. So I started — well, there are so many little branches to this story.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you have courses in physics that included electronics?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNot then, no; and what I actually did was to get my hands on electronics to play with, I went to the city dump where a fellow that I knew ran the dump. We made a deal that every radio that came in, he would pile up in a heap, and I would come out once a week or once a month or something, and pick through those. I ended up with just piles of old radios that he gave me, and from those old pieces and parts, I learned and understood how things worked, and I read in the library, of course, all this time.\n\nThat is how I really got started with electronics. By then I knew enough about electronics that the next year when I went to the field, this would be the first summer after my freshman year, they assigned me as something called a Junior Observer. The Observer was the guy that ran these seismic field crews, and he was the technical expert in charge of collecting the data, with the electronics in the recording truck, and I was his junior. So that summer I was the Junior Observer, which meant I was learning all about that job.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's quite a change.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat was, of course, a lot nicer job than having to hustle the jugs up and down the line. That summer I spent in Illinois and Indiana on these field crews. That was the summer of 1950, and it was there, in fact, that I remember that the Korean War started, because I remember hearing it on the radio while we were out in the field, and all of us wondering if and when we were going to get sucked up by the Army. Well, since I was in college, I was exempt, but of course, everybody immediately had to register for the draft, but I had a deferment, as a student. I spent that summer doing that.\n\nThen when I went back that fall, the company put me to work in their electronics assembly activity. This was kind of an integrated company. It did all of its own electronics. So I was put on the bench assembling amplifiers and other kinds of electronics. That's what I did during that winter; it was a nice job, and it paid a lot more money. Of course, it was a lot more fun, because it was really technical kind of stuff.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou were working 40 hours a week still?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, and I did that by working afternoons, and Saturdays. They made a special deal for me to let me work on Saturdays. They went out of their way to do that. The following summer, I went again to the field, and I was then the Vacation Replacement Observer. I went from field crew to field crew for two or three weeks at each one while the regular observer went on vacation, and I ran the field crew. And so that summer, I was in, I don't know, at least 10 different places all over the country, in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and Alabama, and I don't remember where else.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWere you forming a pretty strong opinion that this was what you were going to do, this kind of thing, something in this line?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, yes, but I just fell into it. I didn't have the perception that I had the freedom to go just any ol' direction I wanted to go. I certainly never at that time imagined myself becoming a \"scientist\" or anything like that. I was going to be involved in applied science, in the words you would use today. I never had any thought of doing anything different than that. The University of Tulsa was not a place that generated Ph.D.'s, and there was not in that school at least, any sense that that was what you should do. Very, very few people did anything but get a bachelor's degree, and go to work in industry someplace. So there was very little incentive to do anything more than that, no tradition. And that mattered. That mattered a lot. If that tradition, or even that incentive, had been there, I'm sure a very large number of us would have gone into graduate work somewhere, but it just was not the style. Nobody talked about doing that.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nBut your professors had doctorates?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nA good fraction of them, at least.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, oh yes.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDo you remember any of your physics professors, because you were in the Physics Department?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI was in the Physics Department, but I was in something called the Geophysics Option. And yes, there was a guy by the name of William Agors who ended up being the professor for my last two years. He was a little more intellectually oriented, although he very quickly, I think the very next year after I graduated, went to work for a company doing airborne geophysical, airborne magnetic work. I think he ultimately became the president of it, for some years.\n\nI then alternated between working for the Seismograph Service Corporation in the field during the summer and during the winter, while I was in school, doing various other things in the lab. I ultimately became the Inspector, which meant I was the guy that inspected all of the parts coming in and all the finished hardware going out, and did all the tests on the hardware. What nowadays would be called the acceptance test, to make sure that it does what it is supposed to do. That was nice, again, because it was an independent activity.\n\nYou didn't depend on anybody else, and I could do the job at random times. That was considered to be kind of the top job in the construction part of the enterprise. I mean, that was the technical job, if you weren't going to be a supervisor. It was, because you had the real responsibility, your name was stamped on it, that the thing really worked. So you really had to check it out and understand what you were doing, and understand why it didn't work, or that it really didn't work in maybe some subtle way.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIt's interesting. You really were progressing, in positions, even in this time you were going to school; and you must have been aware of this, and others must have been aware of this, too.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, sure.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was your self-image at that time? You must have thought: golly, you must be pretty good at this stuff.\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, I was encouraged certainly, but I think my dad was the only one that recognized that I was moving into the system fairly rapidly, more rapidly than may have been normal. But it was not unusual for people to move in fairly rapidly, because it was a dynamic company. Little companies normally are, and especially in that business.\n\nThey have a lot of turnover in personnel, and so there is a lot of opportunity to proceed rapidly. Although they had a research section, and that's what I really wanted to be in, I was never allowed to go into that. I asked several times, as I remember, to be allowed to get into that part of it, but it was perceived that I didn't have the technical background to do that, and they were correct, of course. I didn't have the technical background to do that, since that group was a bunch of double E's, a bunch of electrical engineers. I knew most of them very well, and in fact, by then I was also a ham, an amateur radio type, and there were a number of those guys who were also. Being a ham was the means by which I learned really an awful lof of electronics of those days.\n\nI was always a ham who liked to build my own equipment. I did all my ham work on 6 meters, 50 megahertz. In the beginning, you couldn't buy any hardware commercially at all. In those days you could only buy the simplest kind of stuff off the shelf. I picked the 50 megahertz band on purpose, because it was fascinating to build the stuff and make it work. I wasn't so interested in gabbing with somebody with a radio as I was with making the stuff work.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nI understand. The progression, though, seems to be quite rapid; but I'm still very interested in how your general knowledge of physics and, especially, of astronomy, grew at this time, if at all.\n\nWestphal:\n\nNeither were growing very rapidly, physics in the sense of physics in a place like Caltech. What I was learning was geophysics, not real physics.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo you did take a core curriculum of physics.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, sure, but the core curriculum of physics at Tulsa University was still very much Newtonian physics of the old style.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNo laboratories where you did simple atomic physics experiments, Millikan oil drop, or anything like that?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNothing like that, old fashioned, simpleminded kind of physics of weights and pulleys, and all of that sort of stuff.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNo spectroscopy?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo spectroscopy. Now, on the side, while I was in high school, I had another buddy, not my telescope-making buddy, but he was my chemistry and physics and rocketry buddy.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOh, tell me about that.\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, I spent actually more time around him than I did the other guy. The reason was he lived closer to where I was than the other guy, so it was easier. But we both were very interested in chemistry, and the chemistry teacher whom we had in high school, this lady I mentioned before, was a real gem in turning you on, and getting you going. I remember the chemistry course was two semesters. I took the first semester, and in the second semester, while I was taking that, I became the chief lab assistant to the teacher, as well; and so I prepared all experiments. She really knew how to get you excited and going with that; and so I was really very interested in chemistry. This other guy, whose name was Fred Doyle, was also very interested, and in some book we discovered the Toppler pump, You know what a Toppler pump is? Well, it's a rudimentary vacuum pump, it was the first vacuum pump that was able to get a low enough vacuum to produce an electrical discharge through the residual gas. It is just a glass tube in which you drop drops of mercury. They act as little pistons as they trap the air between them and go to the bottom. You pick the mercury up at the bottom and pour it back in the top, with a funnel with a stopcock on it. Actually, ours was simpler minded than that. We had a rubber tube and a squeeze clamp, and we could adjust the rate at which it would fall. And of course, as long as the residual pressure was fairly high, we would end up with mercury forming these blobs; and we had to have about the right bore in the glass tube for this to work. If the bore was too big, the mercury would fall free, and if it was too small, it pumped too slow. So the bore needed to be 1/8 of an inch, or maybe a 16th of an inch, or something like that. But the thing that prevented us from getting an arbitrarily good vacuum was that as the vacuum improved, the mercury would no longer form a blob. It would just fall straight through. Anyway, we had a lot of fun doing that. In our playing with the pump, we discovered that with an old Model T Ford spark coil, which was the cheap way to lay hands on high voltage, we could light up the residual gas in a glass tube without having any wires through the glass, by just wrapping aluminum foil around the ends and clipping it on to the spark coil. Since the spikes in the spark coil were so high frequency, we essentially had an RF tube, see.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's right.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOne of the things the Science Club did one year was to go out to a neon sign company and see them making neon signs, which was a fascinating thing; so we recognized that the problem with neon signs is that they have metal electrodes inside. And over time — nowadays you could say they sputter — the electrodes sputter the metal onto the side of the tube and as they do, it traps the neon, or argon, or whatever is in the tube. The pressure goes down, so that it won't work any more, and the tube \"cleans up.\" The tube then has a lifetime of a year or two, before its pressure is too low for it to work well. Well, we recognized that problem, and just thinking back, we were beginning to think, how do you make things work better? We recognized that that problem wouldn't happen in our tube, because there was no metal inside. So we actually wrote out (I wish to hell I had the thing; it would be fun to see it) a patent application. We sent it off to some patent attorney who advertised in Popular Science, or some place like that. He wanted $35 to do a patent search, and so we scrounged around and got the $35. But in the meantime, we had sent this thing to him and he had looked at it and thought there was a problem with it. He thought we would never be able to get, with that simple-minded way, enough current through, the tube to light it up bright enough. Of course, we had no neon. All we had was air in the thing, and so we really didn't know how well it was going to work. Of course, neon was expensive as hell, like it is now, and we just didn't have any. As I think back now, of course, we really weren't thinking as well as we should have been, because we surely could have laid our hands on a neon tube and put the aluminum foil on the outside and ignored the electrodes at the end to see what would happen. Either we didn't think of that, or something. At any rate, that was enough of a discouragement, because in our guts we knew he was right, since we really couldn't get the air to light up real bright with this. Of course, we were putting some miniscule amount of power into it, thinking back now. And it turned out that in later years, such a thing was actually marketed, and it was used in that business. So the idea was there, if we had proceeded, we might have been successful. Well, we never would have found enough money to get the thing patented. But that was my first contact with patentability, and patenting things.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIt must have gotten you quite excited.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh, it was great fun, and I remember a lot of threshing around about it, getting people to witness it, and you know, those things. (laughs).\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhere do the rockets come in?\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, Doyle and I were also very deeply interested in rockets; and so we were building rockets from scratch. Of course, since we were interested in chemistry, we learned a lot about it, and we ran into, again in the library, a two-volume — I believe it was a two-volume, maybe it was three volumes — book, called: THE CHEMISTRY OF POWDER AND EXPLOSIVES, the author of which was I believe Davis. It was a laboratory procedures book. It told you how to manufacture in a chemistry laboratory any explosive that you were interested in, from nitroglycerin right on down. Such a book today, with worry about terrorists and so forth, would surely not be on a normal library list. One part of one of the volumes of it was on fireworks. That really got us interested, and of course, the kinds of things that you were interested in as a kid were things that went \"bang.\" There was a material described in there, called nitrogen tri-iodide, and how to manufacture it. It was very easy to make. I don't remember any more, but it was very easy for us to lay hands upon the chemicals to do this. As long as it is wet, with water, it's very well behaved, but when it dries out, it becomes so sensitive to touch, you wouldn't believe it. It precipitates out of solution when you make it. You normally collect it wet on a filter paper and so forth. We came upon a nifty thing, which (laughs) I still think is nifty. We recognized that we could collect this stuff wet on a piece of filter paper, and if we would put some sugar in the water solution when we made it, that would leave a residue of sugar-saturated water on this filter paper, along with the nitrogen iodide. We'd take it out and open the filter paper up flat, move the nitrogen iodide kind of uniformly over the surface and let the whole thing dry, which then left you with nitrogen iodide and sugar. We would then take it outside and hang it on a nail, or on a clothesline, as I remember. A fly would land on this to get the sugar, and \"ca pow ee!\" It was endlessly fascinating for us to watch the thing blow flies up.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat a trap for a fly.\n\nWestphal:\n\nAnd of course, the thing that we mainly did with it was leave it on little pieces of filter paper, and cut them up in little tiny pieces. And then we could take them and throw them on the floor some place, and as people would walk along, they would step on it, and it would go, \"bang, bang, bang.\" Not enough of an explosion to hurt anybody, but I guess if they had stepped on it with bare feet, it might have been a problem.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWell, it's not, if I recall. It depends on how saturated it is. It is not like a cap.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes. That's right. And essentially, each individual crystal, I'm sure, was going off as an independent thing. At any rate, that was how we got into rocketry. Then we built a lot of rockets, and for those days, fairly spectacular rockets, you know, things that would go 1,000 feet in the air.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou must have known about V-2s at that time.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes. We knew about anything like that which was going on; sure, all of that. And of course, that was the time in which everybody was interested in rockets.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you read science fiction?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, from the very beginning. I'm sure when I was in high school was the first time I had contact with it. I was a great science fiction fan.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAny specific authors?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI wasn't all that partial to authors. There was some discussion down at Marshall the other day about what was going to be the next thing the Russians were going to do on the moon. I said, well, maybe they're going to do what Bob Heinlein once proposed in a science fiction article called \"The Man Who Sold the Moon,\" as I remember. It said, one night everybody looked up and the face of the full moon had a Coca Cola sign on it. (laughs). And I remember at the time, everybody giggled and said, it isn't going to be Coca Cola. It's going to be Vodka Cola.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nRight.\n\nWestphal:\n\nI think that's probably the only one of those stories that I remember much about. But I was a great fan of S. F.; and I remember once while I was in college, I got into a tremendous argument with the English lit teacher over whether this stuff was literature or not. Of course, the teacher thought it was all garbage; and I, of course, thought it was the greatest literature in the world. And we were having this big fight in class over whether it was literature or wasn't.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's interesting. Getting back to college years then, you were working full time all the way through college. You mention that in hindsight, you feel that you suffered somewhat. Will you be more explicit.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes. The thing was that I could get through college with B's and a few A's with essentially no effort; and therefore, I could support working at this level. I needed to work because I really did need the money, and that money was not wasted on frivolity. I needed every damn penny of it, even then, year by year, the tuition was going up. Of course, my salary was going up some, too, because I had better jobs, as you pointed out, as I went along. But it was still a nip and tuck economic enterprise. Essentially, I was financing completely my own college activity in every way. Finally, the last year I was there in college — maybe the last two years, yes, the last two years — I had an apartment, because the people that I had been staying with properly had a gut full of supporting me. It was all friendly, but you know, they thought it was appropriate for me to finance my own enterprise. So I then had an apartment, a second story garage-type apartment, each of the last two years. So I really did need the money. I didn't have enough money to own a car, as an example, or anything like that, so there was no excess of money in the system. There's no doubt that I did not involve myself in the academic activities at the level that it would have been good for me to do; and therefore, I missed a lot of the most basic part of my education by that process, but that's the way it was. I don't cry over spilt milk, but there is no doubt about it that that was not a positive thing. My kid,* now, is going to Rice at the moment, and my perception of it is that he kind of thinks the way I did, that it was kind of neat. And so he's doing some of the same stuff; and I finally this year discouraged him very strongly from taking up a job offer he had from the company in Houston that builds the Space Shuttle simulator. His summer job for the last couple of years has been with a company in Tulsa that builds simulators for DC 10's, and other kinds of aircraft. He's kind of a software freak like most young kids are these days. That's gone very well, and he's made a very large amount of money at it, as a matter of fact; so the temptation to do that while he was going to college was great. I told him what I have just been telling you, essentially, that although I had no doubt he could make it work, I thought he would be missing something. So he didn't, and I think he's very happy with that. He got a job internally in the university, which is a completely appropriate kind of thing, doing data reduction for one of the OSO satellites.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nFor the OSO's?\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes. I don't know any details about who he is working with, or anything.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThey are still reducing 0S0 data?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI guess, forever, yes. He's in the space physics group, the group that Al Dessler was running. Dessler, you know, now has gone to Marshall. In fact, I saw him this past week.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat is his role going to be there?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHe's head of one of the Marshall labs. I don't know which one it is, and I don't understand the subtlety of it, but it's a science-oriented one. I don't know the details of that. I was quite surprised to hear he was going.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHe was at Rice a long time. He built up the space science curriculum there, and that sort of thing.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes. Bob O'Dell, who is project scientist on ST, is going to Rice.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes.\n\nWestphal:\n\nSo they are kind of trading places. It’s not the same job as at Marshall.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's right. So is O'Dell definitely going? * Andrew.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes. He's going, I guess, in the middle of September or sometime. At any rate, it was a mistake, but it was a mistake I didn't have any real choice about, so I guess you wouldn't call it a mistake. It was a missed opportunity.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nRight. Now, you were getting close to graduating, and I'd be interested to know what your plans for the future were at that time.\n\nWestphal:\n\nWell, the opportunity that was offered to me from the SSC was to go out and be an Assistant Party Chief. The party chief was the guy who actually ran the whole thing. He wasn't just a field boss. He was always the man who was the interpreter of the data itself, in contrast to the engineer in the field, whose responsibility was to collect the data, this guy called the observer. So the natural course of events would be that I should go out and become an assistant party chief, and then ultimately I'd become a party chief, which was the top of the heap.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo you had taken in a good amount of geology that was appropriate to petroleum geology.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, and I studied a lot of geology, because I loved it. In fact, I don't think there was any doubt that I would have ended up being a geologist, specifically a sedimentary petrologist, except for the fact that I am color blind, and I couldn't see glauconite, which is a bright green mineral and it's crucial to doing sedimentary petrology. I just simply couldn't see it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nWestphal:\n\nFor awhile I was really more interested in that than I was in geophysics, probably until my junior year, but it just wasn't going to happen, and that was the only particular part of geology that I was all that interested in. But I was deeply interested in geology. I remember how I got interested in that too. That was still in high school. I ran into a book, again in the library, which was called Petroleum Geology* or something, and I can't remember the name of the author or such, but it was a very cookbook kind of geology book, written probably in the late '20's or early '30's. It was an old book, even then; but it was just incredibly fascinating to me, in understanding how the earth worked, and Petit Jean Mountain, the mountain that my folks lived on, is erosional remnants of a big syncline. And you know, I immediately recognized that. It went on to explain why there were artesian wells, and why they *By Dorsey Hager were where they were. This whole new world of nifty things opened up that I could understand, and came out of that one book, which was written as a primer for petroleum geologists. By Dorsey Hager.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. Of course, the geosynclinal theory at that time was it.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat was it, and so yes, I had a lot of background in geology. Well, immediately when I came to Tulsa, from high school, I found that there was an astronomy club, and of course, I joined that instantaneously, since I had been building telescopes.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo through college you were still into astronomy?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, I was up to my ears in that. That was my main hobby.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOn top of the ham radio.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, sure. The ham radio thing really didn't happen until later when I had a good job and had enough money to be in ham radio. I actually got my ham radio license, I guess, the last year I was in college.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThat was about 1954.\n\nWestphal:\n\n1954, it must have been, yes. When I was about to get out of college, one of the fellows* that I knew in the astronomy club knew a man by the name of Lou Pakiser, who was a geophysicist for the U.S. Geological Survey. They had been boyhood buddies, or something. This guy, Pakiser, appeared in Tulsa to visit with his friend. I was invited over and we were talking, and he said, “gee, I've got a nifty job, just what you would like to do, I bet.\" He said, you know, the U.S. Geological Survey has this activity of going to foreign countries. (I had it in my head that I wanted to go to a foreign country. I don't know where that came from. I wanted to see the world; that's right). So, he said: \"I know just the job for you, and I can get it for you without a doubt.\" He said, \"we have a new project opening up in Cuba, where the U.S. Geological Survey is doing the exploration for nickel to support the International Nickel Corporation's business.\" You know, nowadays you would wonder what the hell is the U.S. Government doing supporting a Canadian company's private exploration. The answer was, well, the U.S. considers nickel to be a critical material, and so forth. So, I said, that would be neat; I would love to do that, it's magnetics and gravity. That's fun stuff. He said, great — this was like Christmastime, probably, before I was to be out in May. He said, \"I'll send you the forms and you apply for this *George Rose job.” It was clearly going to be pipelined. He did, and I sent all the forms in, and there was even a security investigation somehow, which I have wondered many times what that was about, why that had anything to do with anything; but some FBI-type appeared around. They never talked to me, of course, but they talked to the people around me somehow. It was all signed, sealed and delivered, and I was to go to Cuba. Well, actually, I was supposed to go to — it was not Reston, Virginia in those days — downtown Washington at that time, where the USGS main office was.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. They are in Reston now.\n\nWestphal:\n\nI was to go there to sign papers and whatever else I was supposed to do. There were plane reservations made and everything. Then one day I got this phone call from him, and he said, \"gee, Jim, they wiped me out.\" He said, \"There was a guy fresh back from the Korean War, and although you made 100 on your examination and were the top guy, he made 110, because he got 90 on the exam, and he got 20 free points. And there wasn't anything I could do.\" And the thing just dropped. That was it right there. So I had already notified the SSC that I was going to do this. However, they immediately offered me a job to learn to do radioactive well logging in preparation to go to Mexico, and I grabbed that in a second. So immediately when I was out of college, the end of May, I was farmed out to a company called Well Services, Incorporated, which originally had been a subsidiary of SSC. They did radioactive well logging. You are probably familiar with that busines, doing both gamma ray and neutron well logging. That technology had been invented by a man who is now quite famous, who was the Russian spy in the Manhattan Project. I can't think of his name. Yes, Klaus Fuchs had been involved in well logging and had been one of the inventors of that technology, of the idea; and then the engineering technology had been done by that company. At any rate, the vibrating reed electrometer, which was the only way you could measure 10-12 and 10-14 type currents, had been invented by this company. They had put it on ionization chambers for that purpose. So I was taught the field procedures of how to do that sort of stuff, by spending two months with this company, running from one oil well to another learning how. Then I was shipped off in early 1954. This must have been 1953 in December, again maybe; maybe I'm a year off. I expect it was '53 in December. I was sent to Mexico to replace a guy who was leaving, doing oil well logging work in a town called Posa Rica. It was a big oil field along the Gulf Coast halfway between Tampico and Vera Cruz, Mexico. That lasted about six months, and then PEMEX, the Mexican oil company that we were actually contractors to, gave all that work to Schlumberger. Schlumberger is famous, these days, for oil well logging. They were the people who invented electric logging. The two Schlumberger brothers were Frenchmen. The name is obviously a Germanlike name, but they were Frenchmen. They invented the concept of electrical logging back in the '20's or '30's, and it is \"the\" well service organization, providing all kinds of well services now, a big company. In recent weeks, it's been having all kinds of ups and downs in the stock market. It's the prime company watched for oil field service. Anyway, they took that job over and I was transferred to a SSC seismic crew in the isthmus region of Mexico in Chiopas, where I then was the party chief. Actually, I shared the responsibility. Because we were in a jungle, we worked three weeks and were off two. For two weeks I was the party chief, and then for three weeks the other guy was a party chief. We had a week overlap and each of us had two weeks in Mexico City.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAs a party chief, your responsibilities were really as a project manager.\n\nWestphal:\n\nI was a project manager, but also responsible for all the interpretation of data, the ultimate interpretation of data.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. So you were basically managing a crew.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat's right.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHad you had any training, or find any difficulties in this kind of a management operation?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh no, I had been around it, of course, all of those years by then, working for that company, so I knew what it was all about and how to go. Although it was somewhat different in Mexico, because you had a mixed group of locals as well as gringos that were down there, and that changed the nature of it. I was, and am, a great fan of Latin America. I just ate it up. It was just great. My only problem is that I find it very difficult to learn a foreign language and had a hell of a time learning Spanish. I never did learn Spanish, only enough to get along with, but it sure would have been a lot more fun and a lot more interesting if I had been able to learn the language easily. So I spent a year down there. In the middle of that time, I was drafted, was declared 1A and had to come back and take a medical exam. I failed the medical exam by a fluke. I had severely ingrown toenails, and at that time — maybe it's true yet — they couldn't induct you into the army, if you were not physically fit at that moment of induction to take basic training. So I was declared 4F on the basis of some ingrown toenails.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIngrown toenails. Did you know this?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, I didn't know that, hadn't the slightest idea. And I had that problem for many years, and had never gone to a doctor to get it fixed, because I anticipated it was going to cost more money than I could afford, and I could tolerate it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nBut didn't it hurt you?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, it was clear I couldn't have taken basic. I tolerated it somehow.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYet you were out in the field running around.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, that's right, but that's a lot different than taking basic training. But that was how it was. Otherwise, I would have been inducted in the Army in 1954, even though the Korean War was either over or about to be over at that point.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou weren't disappointed?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI was not disappointed with that. That did not break me up at all. So I went back to Mexico, but while I was up in the States taking that exam, I of course, went back to Tulsa and saw all my buddies. I guess everyone of them, in fact, were people who were associated with this astronomy club, along with other kinds of interests. And they had a new buddy who had joined the astronomy club. He was a guy named Jimmy Johnson, who was head of a new research group for the Sinclair Research Labs, which was a new research lab set up by Sinclair a couple of years before that, in response to some pressure from the financial world that said that Sinclair wasn't a real oil company if it didn't have a research lab. So they said, all right, we'll build a research lab. So you know, we'll send them $22 worth of books and that sort of thing. Anyway, he was head of a section of the research lab. Anyway, while I was there, this guy said, \"gee, I'd love to hire you. Why don't you get out of that damn mess down in Mexico in the jungle, wading through the soup half the time, and come up and join up with us?\"\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAny hesitation on your part?\n\nWestphal:\n\nI said, gee, that's great. Can you pay me enough money? He said, \"what do you make?\" I told him what it was, which was nothing even in those days. He said, \"Well, I'll double that. How about that for a pass?\" I said, \"Okay, you're on.\" (laughs). So I went back down to Mexico and gave them three months notice so that they had time to replace me without a panic. And just a year after I had gone down there, I came back and went to work for Sinclair. I think that must have been the first of December of 1954.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\n1954, okay. Let me change this tape.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat were your responsibilities at Sinclair in the beginning, and what was the research environment?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThe research environment was exploration research. And since they didn't know what it meant, but they had a million dollars a year to spend, it was one of those classic situations where the reason for its existence had nothing to do with the work it was doing. They were supposed to spend so many millions of dollars a year on research, so they said, \"Okay, here's a million dollars; go do research.\" The management of the corporation didn't have the slightest idea what should be done. They didn't want to have anything to do with this. They were doing it because they had been directed to do it. It was that simple minded. So essentially, we could do anything we wanted to; but they had already been there for a couple of years, so ...\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThese were mainly double E's like in SSC?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, they were mainly, in fact, Ph.D. geologists, geophysicists, and geochemists. They decided this was a great opportunity. There were all kind of post-doc level guys, except for Johnson, who I think, didn't have a Ph.D., but he was a geologist by training. And he had many years of experience in the oil business in geology and exploration geology. So they hired me because they recognized that I had a special skill in instruments and field work, and you know, in making that sort of thing happen. So I came into the company, not very visible, and not with any special job; the kind of a job to help out on whatever was being done. Of course, it was a dream kind of a job for somebody like me, and especially coming immediately from what had been a physically very grungy environment in South Mexico.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSocially kind of difficult, too.\n\nWestphal:\n\nSocially difficult, and of course, with that kind of increase in salary, I went out and bought a car; gee, the f irst car I ever had. I was really in hog heaven, and got myself a real apartment, and so forth. Very quickly, it was clear that I was the person in the system that had the broadest kind of engineering technical knowledge, how to do things, and what could be done. I grew in that job very quickly, lots of challenges and lots of opportunities, and lots of money. Nobody knew what to do with all the money. They had a substantial staff of technicians running around.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHow many did you have that reported to you?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNobody reported to me. I reported to somebody else, but these guys were around. It was a very unorganized situation; it was not a rigid organization in any sense. It was a very open kind of enterprise; and really, we all just kind of worked for Jimmy Johnson, and it didn't matter.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nHe was running it.\n\nWestphal:\n\nHe was running this piece of it. The whole research lab was a bigger thing, and it had a lot of people doing reservoir engineering. Reservoir engineering in that context normally meant: \"How do you get more oil out of the ground?\" But they had a bunch of people that were doing oil field engineering, or a better way to say it is, people who were worrying about how you made hardware, and how you improved the process of working in the oil field. So it was really a mechanical engineering kind of crew. Now, they worked for somebody else. And there was a vice-president of Sinclair that ran the place.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was Johnson's group responsible for?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHis group was the exploration geophysics research group.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nSo the same techniques that you were already familiar with.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, sure, and the idea was, let's find better ways to do it, and let's understand how it works. Let's develop better amplifiers and better instruments; better ways to analyze the data; better ways to display the data; and all kinds of things like that. It was really just anybody's imagination. You could just run wild. So very quickly over the course of probably the first year, I started to accumulate a group of guys that worked with me, not for me in a formal sense, but with me. We started tackling a bunch of these kinds of problems; how do you do a better job of this and that, and the other thing. One of the first things we recognized was that, boy, it sure would be nice to get rid of a bunch of the hand calculations that went on in that business in those days, and lay hands upon a computer. So we threshed around and laid hands on an IBM 604, which was a wired program machine. We started doing things like that. We had a lot of interest in gravity work. We thought, and we were right, that gravity exploration techniques had never really been done right, and with a computer you could do it a lot easier and faster; therefore, you could try things that just were not viable if you had to do all of the analysis by hand.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you have any prior experience or interest in computers, or someone in your group?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, none of us. We knew they existed and we could learn; and of course, it wasn't hard to learn in those days. It isn't hard to learn now. We went along with the 604 for about a year. Again, through this astronomy club, a guy appears out of the woodwork and joins the astronomy club. What does he do? Well, he's a computer programmer. His name was Gene Usdin, and it turns out that he and a couple of other fellows had started a little computer company, which was the first computer company in Tulsa.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThis was a hardware company, or software?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThis was a computing company. Their job was to do computing. They weren't building hardware; they were an application service company. So, of course, the main action in Tulsa then, and partly still now, was the oil industry. It was the only industry, certainly, then; so they were around looking for things to do in the oil biz. The first thing they latched onto was the reservoir engineering people. Their work involved lots of simple-minded calculations and lots of nomograms, the use of tables, and graphics. These guys just went through that like nothing, you know, and it was just trivial to do on even a 604. And all they had was a 604. That's what there was at that time. Since I ran into him in the astronomy club, we got acquainted, and pretty soon, we hired him as a consultant.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThe astronomy club sounds like a real focus.\n\nWestphal:\n\nIt was a real focus for all kinds of technical things around that town. The radio ham club was the same sort of thing as well. I think that was a natural thing. It was a kind of a technically-oriented social enterprise, and it was a gathering place for people. There was, of course, a geophysics society, locally, but it had fallen into the hands of a bunch of joiners and lawyers, who wanted to spend their time writing by-laws and having formal meetings and that sort of stuff. It was not a very effective thing in those days. It got very much better later on, with the influx of a lot of new Ph.D.'s in that business, for which we were mainly responsible, because we were hiring a lot of these guys.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nDid you have pressures f or producing things on various schedules to the Sinclair people? Did the vice-president who was running this division apply any pressure to look good?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo. It was totally unorganized. The parent company couldn't care less what we did. As I said before, our job was to be there and spend money. They didn't have the slightest interest in what we were doing, whether we got any results or not. They were fulfilling this requirement that the financial community had laid upon Sinclair, that Sinclair wasn't a real oil company if it didn't have a research lab. A research lab should spend so many millions of dollars a year, and it should have so many people. A certain percentage of them had to be Ph.D.'s; and that's all they cared about. As long as we did that, that was all there was to it. They could care less.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNo publishing?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo publishing, no nothing.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIs it still that way?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat company? Well, that company has since become part of ARCO, and actually, Sinclair owned Richfield Oil Company originally. And then Richfield, through some machinations of the financial world, took over Sinclair, and Atlantic took over Richfield Sinclair, and it became Atlantic Richfield, and Sinclair disappeared, but that was after I left there.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nCertainly, but the question is, was this, looking back at it, a very unusual situation in industrial R&D?\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, the fact that it was so late in coming. Standard of New Jersey, what is now called Exxon, had a big research lab in Tulsa that had been there for many years. And they were really doing research. They had the other problem. They were so formalized that the joke around was, which was not really a joke, that these guys spent five per cent of their time doing research and ninety-five per cent of their time writing reports about it. That lab was actually called Carter at that time, which was before Standard of New Jersey took over all the little companies and made them one.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWho was responsible for this laissez-faire attitude in Sinclair?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThe top management of Sinclair. They couldn't care less; just the appearance was all they cared about. Now people down in the system, of course, were utilizing that as an opportunity to do all kinds of nifty things. They didn't just waste the money, although there was waste. They really saw it as an opportunity to do a bunch of neat stuff, and that's what we were doing. The vice-president in charge of our place at that time was interested in oil shale. He had decided oil shale was where the future was.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nAt that time.\n\nWestphal:\n\nAt that time, and his only interest was oil shale; and he got a single block of oil shale that was 20 feet on a side, mined up in Colorado and shipped to Tulsa, and installed it in the back lot. That's a big piece of stuff, you know.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nA 20-foot cube?\n\nWestphal:\n\nA 20-foot cube. It was hauled on the railroad, and it took special routing to haul something 20 feet wide on the railroad.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. Why did he want it?\n\nWestphal:\n\nHe wanted to do experiments on it; and he had dreamed up something — this is a little later than the point where we are in the discussion at the moment — called flame-flooding. The oil industry does secondary recovery by flooding, first by flooding with water, and then with steam and carbon dioxide. He was going to flood the oil field with flame. His idea was that he was going to set the shale on fire down in the earth by pumping air into it, getting it on fire, and then he was going to pressurize it and have this fire burn. As it burned, of course, it would liquify the oil ahead of it and push the oil ahead of it. Conceptually it was a very pretty idea, and an idea that has surfaced several times in recent years. It has a fatal flaw, however, in oil shales, and that is that oil shales have a very low permeability. It has a lot of porosity, a lot of open space, but it isn't connected in a way that you can make stuff flow through it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nI understand that.\n\nWestphal:\n\nSo what would happen was that he would heat this thing up red hot, ultimately, in the center of this 20 foot cube of block. His idea was that he was going to pump in air to make this flame front expand and the oil was just going to run right out of the sides of the block onto the ground. In fact, he had even dug a pit so that the pit would catch the oil that he was going to make out of it. What happened was that he could melt the damn rock on the inside, and nothing would happen on the outside, because it was self-sealing. What little permeability was there would be sealed up by this oil, t his heavy tarlike stuff, and it is a poor thermal conductor, and so just nothing would happen. Anyway, he was only interested in that. He couldn't care less what we were doing. I was there from '55 to '61 when I came here; so I was there six years. Gradually, as things evolved, I ended up with a group in a formal sense, and our job was to look at nonconventional techniques of finding oil. Now that was all it was, and by then our budget had grown massively. Our little group consisted of six or eight guys, and we had a lot of support people scattered around. Our job was to spend a million dollars a year among us, looking at unconventional ways of finding oil. We did a lot of geochemistry of all sorts. We did a lot of gamma ray spectroscopy on surface materials. We did a lot of gravity work of various sorts, and that was what led ultimately, by accident, to my coming to Caltech, that particular gravity study. I'll come back to that later on. We did various sorts of seismic things. We did radio propagation through the near surface. We did aerial photography through colored filters, Landsat kind of stuff. We looked at people with oil in bottles on strings that wiggled this way when you were at one edge of the oil, and that way when you were at the other edge.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat?\n\nWestphal:\n\nYou know, we looked at anything that anybody said would find oil.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYou mean the divining rods?\n\nWestphal:\n\nDivining rods, yes. An infinite suite of these kinds of things. A guy in the back woods would put gold in a bottle to find gold. He put oil in the bottle to find oil. He puts silver in the bottle and it finds silver. You know, the bent twig, the whole bit.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nA lot of people?\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh, the world's full of those people, hundreds of them, and we purposely advertised that we were interested in looking at anything.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWho actually was responsible for dealing with all these people, you directly?\n\nWestphal:\n\nMe, my crew. I did a good bit of it, but I was running them through a little subgroup. And we advertised even in newspapers.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWere there any documents on this? Were they kept?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, and since then the company has disappeared, I expect the files don't exist either. But incredible stuff, the most incredible bunch of complicated things that were essentially oil in a bottle. They would bring in the most exotic bottles, and you know, they'd have radioactive stuff in it, or the'd have this or that, or they'd have vitamins in it, (laugh) anything, anything, anything. But we spent most of our effort, in fact, on a few things that were perceived to be almost scientific, which meant you almost understood how they might work. The whole idea of geochemical exploration really is based on the recognition that there are a few places in this world where oil comes right to the surface. These are oil seeps. Some famous places are along the California Coast here, where oil is seeping up in the ocean. Down off of Redondo Beach, right off the end of the LA Airport, there are three places where oil is bubbling up out of the bottom of the ocean. It is coming from oil fields. There is absolutely no doubt.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThe La Brea tar pits are evidence?\n\nWestphal:\n\nThe tar pits are precisely that sort of a thing. There is a place up above Santa Barbara, called Coal Oil Point, where the stuff coming out is so light that it's like kerosene. So the concept is a very simple-minded one, and that is that there ought to be microseeps, seeps that are so small you don't see any evidence with your eye. And so you ought to be able to find them fairly easily by simple-minded chemical techniques. It's conceptually a nice idea. You don't have any problem with the physics or chemistry of that in a conceptual sense; and so all kinds of simple-minded and sophisticated things were done. In fact, we had the first big firstclass organic gas mass spectrometer in the oil industry. It was a thing that was dreamed up by a man whose name escapes me at the moment at Penn State, and it's a special game of its own. We bought one of these from him. He set up a little company on the side, and we bought one of these things. Therein lies one of the funnier things that happened during that time; there are lots of funny stories, of course. But we bought this thing, and we spent many, many weeks after it came, getting it installed and calibrated. Finally, on a Thursday, everything was done, and it was turned on and it worked. And Friday afternoon we had this immense bloody party, celebrating finally getting this mass spectrometer to work. And so everybody had this big party, and went away, happy as hell, about one or two o'clock on Friday afternoon. Saturday at noontime, some guard discovered that the lights were all off in this lab, and it stunk to high heaven in there; and there was smoke in there and all kinds of things. So he called somebody, and ultimately they called up the guy who was running it, a fellow by the name of Rolyn P. Jacobson, and he goes tearing down there and discovers that the whole system has lost vacuum. Mercury has been evaporated all over the room out of the mercury diffusion pumps, and it was just a disaster. So he shuts the whole world down, and goes away crying the blues. Monday everybody comes in and starts cleaning the mess up. They finally get part of it cleaned up and get it decontaminated to a level that allowed us to stay in the room.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nYes. People were sensitive to mercury, of course.\n\nWestphal:\n\nOh yes, we had had a problem earlier with mercury. They had huge mercury diffusion pumps for some other enterprise in an old house that was on the grounds. This lab was a fairly big kind of garden, or a campuslike place with a number of isolated buildings, one of which had been the superintendent's house. It had been converted into a big lab, and so much mercury had been spilled in that thing that we finally had to destroy the building to get rid of the mercury. People were very sensitive to the mercury problem; unlike at Mt. Wilson.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nNow, wait a minute! What's that?\n\nWestphal:\n\n(laughs). Well, you know, both of the telescopes, the old telescopes at Mt. Wilson, the 60-inch and the 100-inch, have mercury floatation bearings. And they both leak like a sieve, particularly in past years. So both buildings are catastrophically contaminated with mercury. And there was a time back ten years ago or so, when that problem was so severe that Caltech decided that their students could no longer work there because of the health hazard. So it's been a running problem in which people didn't really want to face up to the fact that there was a mercury problem. In fact, there are people around who have a cursory look at it, who believe that George Ellery Hale's mental problem was almost surely, in fact, mercury poisoning. He was the father of those telescopes, and back from his days in Chicago, he was a great fan of mercury and loved to play with it and work with it. The symptoms that you read in the book about Hale* apparently are very similar to the normal symptoms of mercury poisoning, the kind of sporadic mental problems. You remember, he would be lucid for weeks or days, and then he would be in deep trouble, and would have to go back to this place on the East Coast, where he would spend time axing a stump. In the back of this place was a big stump, and he had an ax, and he would spend hours just hitting this thing with the ax. I don't know what it was all about. I don't know that anybody necessarily really knows, but actually somebody might, at this point, be able to establish that it really was mercury. It would be an interesting thing, if somebody really understands the symptoms, to do some work on it, it seems to me. * Explorer of the Universe (Helen Wright).\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nIt would be quite valuable to understand him better.\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat's right, and particularly if that happened to be the source of many of his problems. It would be, I think, a very important thing to understand that he went crazy, not for the obvious reasons, but because he was really poisoned by heavy metal.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWell, I'm sorry, so we go back.\n\nWestphal:\n\nIt's a diversion. The story was that once they got this thing cleaned up so people could work in there, then they started to go see where the leak was. And of course they assumed that some of the glass was broken somehow. They started pumping the thing down with just a fore pump, of course. And the damned thing wouldn't pump down, and they kept valving off parts and parts and parts, until finally it got to nothing but the fore pump. The fore pump itself wouldn't work. Somebody happened to notice that on top of this fore pump there was a label.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nA fore pump?\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, a mechanical fore pump, that you use on the high pressure side of a diffusion pump. It was a mechanical rotary pump. And it is normally called a fore pump. And so they looked, and here setting on top of this fore pump is a brand new Sinclair metal label that says, \"Sinclair Research Labs, Property No. such and such.\" And the guy gets to looking at it, and he discovers that the thing is put on with four little drive nails. And so it is discovered that somebody came in Friday afternoon, somebody from the property office, with an electric hand drill, and went \"zit, zit, zit,\" into the top of the fore pump, laid the thing down, and bang, bang, four nails into the top of this thing, and that was it.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOh boy, what a story. That's how things get messed up!\n\nWestphal:\n\nThat's how things happen, and how things get messed up, everybody doing his job, just galloping incompetency and complacence. At any rate, we had this group of six or eight guys, and we really did most of our work on three things. The gravity thing which everybody understood, and the physics of which was clear; and we were just trying to do a much better job than anybody had ever done before. The geochemistry thing where the physics and chemistry was fairly obvious, and where we were applying new technology, new ways, better ways, cleaner ways to make the measurements. The third activity that we spent most of our time on was a commercial process called Radoil. It was the invention and property of a man whose name I cannot any longer remember, who lived in Shreveport, Louisiana. He was independently wealthy. He had dreamed up this idea that radio waves propagate through the earth, and that they would interact with the edges of oil fields, where the oil interfaces with the water, and that it would defract radio waves, or it would do this, that or the other thing.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThe P and S waves would behave differently. Was he playing with that?\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, he wasn't into that. It was simpler than that. It was just the strength of the radio signals.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nOkay, these were not seismic waves.\n\nWestphal:\n\nNo, it was not that. The radio waves that he used were at 1728 kilohertz, or whatever the number was, something in there. I think that actually was the number. That just happened to be a frequency that the FCC had assigned the oil industry for communication purposes. So he took that frequency, because he didn't have to get a new license, although he was doing something that I suspect was, strictly speaking, against the rules. It was meant strictly for communication, but he used it for that purpose. In any case he was attacked by people who understood physics, who said, this whole thing does not work — Maxwell's equations say that it won't work like that — he would back farther and farther into a corner, making it more and more special until he finally, ultimately, got to the point where he said, \"Well, it's crucial to use that exact frequency.\" There is something special about that frequency, forgetting of course, that the frequency had been randomly assigned. But the fact was that the man sold this service. He had a little company and he sold this as a service to our industry. He sold this service to many oil companies at various times over many years. And every once in awhile, somebody would find some oil by that technique. In fact, since he was independently wealthy, he could play a game, which he did, in which he told companies that he would do the service for them for free for some percent of the oil that they found in the places where he told them to drill. The number 15% comes to mind, but there was some number, not a huge number, but a finite number. Then he published his success ratio. At one point when he was under great pressure, he showed the cancelled checks from the oil companies for the royalties that he got. He was making like a million bucks a year out of this royalty, some very large amount of money. So he was very convincing.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nThis wasn't proof that the technique was right?\n\nWestphal:\n\nFrom his viewpoint it was. He pointed out, and he was right about that, that the success ratio of finding oil by that technique was not substantially different from the success ratio of finding it by seismic techniques. The success ratio calculated as how many oil wells were producers in comparison with how many weren't by the two techniques. The fact was, and he was right, it was true, that his success ratio was about one in ten just like everybody else's was.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nWhat was the success ratio, though, at the time for people who used no techniques at all?\n\nWestphal:\n\nAbout one in ten (laugh) even as we pointed out. Of course, that made people very unhappy, who were in the business of selling seismic techniques, and spending millions and millions of dollars on such techniques. It was a little discouraging when you looked at it that way, that in spite of all of that effort, the technique that everybody agrees is real and scientific and well behaved, and all of that, wasn't really very much more successful than random drilling, as long as the random drilling wasn't dumb. I mean, you didn't include oil wells that were drilled in Hawaii. I mean, that's dumb.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nJapan for the same reason.\n\nWestphal:\n\nYes, or the middle of the Canadian Shield, or some place where there was clearly absolutely no possibility of there being oil. But if you talked about wells that were drilled in places that had a finite geological chance of finding oil, the odds were not all that significantly different. And they are not to this day.\n\nDeVorkin:\n\nBut you took on this technique to study it.\n\nWestphal:\n\nWe wanted to find out, trying to be unbiased, whether there was some truth in it. Now, we were quite sure that these radio waves did not penetrate the earth 5,000 or 10,000 feet. So what we did at the beginning was to demonstrate by actual measurement that a lot of the folk lore about it, if you want to call it that, was clearly nonsense; that physics really works, essentially. So one of the early things that we did was to measure the strength of radio waves, even from his \"special\" frequency, down in mines. Well, he had done a bunch of that, because people had asked; but it turned out that in every case the mines that he did it in had cables running into them from the elevator, or for power, whatever. So we went up in eastern Oklahoma, where there was a bunch of abandoned lead and zinc mines, and we went into one of these mines and went, I don't remember, half a mile or so away from the mine shaft, into an area that had no metal pipes or wires, or anything else in it, just an open shaft back in this lead and zinc mine. And then we went above that place and we injected radio waves with his classic antenna, the way you were supposed to do it. We showed that, in fact, there was attenuation of some arbitrarily large number, i.e.: we couldn't see any radio e"
