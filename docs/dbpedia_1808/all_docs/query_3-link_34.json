The clubs organize gatherings to drive and to exchange experiences. The Ferrari Club Nederland is a very active club with an exceptional amount of members. Forza Service has a supporting role and does so during on site events. From all the positive feedback from members we conclude that this is a welcome service.\n\nThe Ferrari Club Nederland started in 1983 when a group of well known Ferrari drivers came together at the Twentse Kabel Fabriek for the famous ?Racing round the Cables?. It was initiated by Dries van der Lof, a genuine car lover and Ferrari enthusiast.\n\nThe Ferrari Club Nederland organizes rallies, tour rides, circuit days, driver training, Gala?s and charity meetings. With approximately 8 events per year and 1000 member the club is one of the biggest of its kind. Worldwide Ferrari Clubs have a total of about 12.500 members."
