It has taken two years so far and will probably take longer to gather all the information needed but I have learned a lot. Thank you to TNF's posters, in particular Michael Muller, Allen Brown, Doug Nye and \"Austria.\"\n\nI have now reached 1950/51/52 and am trying to sort out the various tipo 375s. Can anyone please help with the individual histories? All comments welcome. So far, it appears that a total of seven F1 cars were built in 1950/51, two in 1950, they are known as GP50-1 and GP 50-2.\n\nThere were five more in 1951. I'm presuming, (dangerous, that..!) that they were numbered as GP51-1 through 5. Louis Rosier bought one, apparently numbered as GP51.02, and Francisco, \"Chico\" Landi bought another, apparently a 1950 car, GP50.02.\n\nIn 1952, five cars were modified with extended chassis, modified engines etc, to compete at Indianapolis, plus one to Vandervell for TWS #4. They were re-numbered. From what, does anyone know? Certainly, Indy Chassis number 4, Howard Keck's car, had been F1 chassis number 3. (New number 4 tag welded over original number 3 stampings).\n\nEngines: One 375 engine went into the Thinwall Special #4, after #2 and 3, which had been 1949 125-C-02. This was engine number 10. GP52/1 numbered engine went into \"Arno XII\", the Hydroplane.\n\nAnother subject but obtaining good photos is also a problem.\n\nEdited by Writer2, 30 March 2023 - 18:07.\n\nHello Roger and B Squared,\n\nThanks for your replies.Roger, as far as I am aware, chassis number 02C from 1948 was the first ThinWall Special, with 125-C-02 from 1949 being the next. Both were returned to the factory, 02C then being sold on to Giovanni Bracco, who raced it a few times in period. . 125-C-02, AFAIAA, was returned to the factory also and rebuilt and returned, to make it TWS number 3, with a 375 engine. It went back once more and was returned with, apparently, a lengthened Indianapolis type chassis and a twin-plug 375 engine, \"010\". From reading about F1 375 chassis number 3, which was modified to become an Indianapolis type chassis and re-stamped as number 4, it appears that these four \"Indy\" chassis were the 1951 F1 cars, with additional pieces used to lengthen them. I'm still looking into this but if this is the case, TWS number 4 was still 125-C-02.\n\nB Squared: Yes, that is the 1952 Indianapolis 375, the Grant Piston Ring Special. It did belong to Dick Merritt/Carl Bross when you photographed it. Apparently Indycar chassis number 2, according to a long ago article that I found from the 1970s, when Dick Merritt was helping Carl Bross assemble his collection of Ferraris.\n\nVanwall by Jenkinson and Posthumus seems pretty clear that Thin Wall #4 was a completely new car. The new edition has additional photographs and captions by Doug Nye, one of which says “Thin Wall Special Ferrari chassis 125-C-02 was replaced by this fresh long-wheelbase Ferrari 375 Indianapolis chassis, serial 010-375”.\n\nThe text says that Vandervell negotiated with Ferrari to buy a 2-litre 4-cylinder engine which he thought of fitting to the old Thin Wall chassis, that is #3. That idea went nowhere. An appendix in the original edition says that #3 was broken up in 1952. This was updated in the new version to say that #3 was saved from scrap by Tom Wheatcroft in the 1980s. In 2021 it was in the Ecclestone collection. #4 as in the Monbouan Arts and Cars Collection, Brittany, France.\n\nAdmittedly, the fact that two cars exist today does not mean that they did in 1952. Even if there was some paper shuffling so that #4 retained the identity of #3, quite possible given what we know of later Vanwalls, it seems to me that the differences between the two make it only sensible to see #4 as a new car.\n\nRoger,\n\nThank you so much for this, very helpful. Personally, from all that I have read, I don't think, (notice: \"think!\"), that there was a /8,/9 built. Numbers /6 and /7 were built in July/August 1951. At present, I think /10 was possibly /01 renumbered, it \"disappears\" from the records after May, 1951. Yes, Landi bought /2 and Rosier /5. I know that/3 was re-numbered as /4 to be an Indianapolis spec car for 1952. This leaves the other three Indycars as re-numbered 4, 6 and 7, which accounts for the seven cars. The Valentino Park cars can, I'm sure, can be worked out, particularly as Farina crashed his, which was supposed to go to Indianapolis as a \"spare\" works car for Ascari. I think /8,/9 would have been built too late for that race.\n\nIncidentally, Keith Bluemel wrote a very good article about F1 #3/Indycar #4 in \"Cavallino.\" That clearly shows that the Indycar lengthened chassis were the original chassis from 1950/51, with pieces welded on/in to give the longer wheelbase.\n\nEdited by Writer2, 04 April 2023 - 21:25.\n\nFangio drove 01F, the F2 car that the Automobile Club of Argentina had bought from Sterzi, via Enzo Ferrari. This took place during the week of 21-27 June 1949.\n\nThe F2 car that Sterzi raced at Lake Garda on 10 July 1949 appears to be a 125C and the only difference that I can see from it and the other 5 cars then extant is that, on the engine cover, there are only 4 louvres in the first row from the front, whereas I count 6 louvres on the other cars, with the exception of 08C, which had 5. So it's not 08C, it's not 01F, it's not 12C, all of which I've been able to look at photographs of. 02C was in England as the first Thinwall Special, 06C was at Rheims with Mario Tadini. 10C was at Rheims also. Bonetto was supposed to be at Garda for the race but he did not arrive, so I think it must have been this car, 04C. It did not race again for another 40 days.... Probably being repaired at the factory.\n\n1950-52 Tipo 375 F1s.\n\nHelp! I have been researching these 4.5 litre F1 Ferraris and what happened to them after their initial racing years. I am now fairly certain that Chassis number 1 became the last Thinwall Special, chassis and engine number 010. It stops being raced by the Scuderia aa #1 and then starts up as #010.\n\nWhat really concerns me is 1950 chassis number 2. This is the car that was apparently driven by Juan Froilan Gonzales, to win the British Grand Prix in 1951. William Boddy, the then Editor of \"Motor Sport\" recorded it as \"chassis Number 2.\" It was driven by Francisco \"Chico\" Landi at the 1951 Italian Grand Prix. By all the accounts that I read, he then bought it and sent it back to South America, where it languished for many years until being bought by Colin Crabbe in the mid-1970s and sent back to England. He sold the parts to Dries van der Loff of the Netherlands, who said that the car bore chassis number 5 (!). From what I read, the car has been restored as 125-C-04, which was PROBABLY driven by Ascari, on 30/7/1950 at the Swiss GP, with a Tipo 340 engine installed.\n\nThen we have chassis number 5. Today, this belongs to Bernie Ecclestone and also claims to be the British GP winner. It was restored by Ferrari Classische in 2019-2021. (See excerpts from my database below). Can anyone please help me with discovering the real histories here? I suspect the identities may have become mixed up whilst in South America.\n\nFinally, it is recorded that Gonzales British GP winning car had a single plug per cylinder car at that race, whilst the other team cars of Ascari and Villoresi had twin plug per cylinder engines. Why was this? Could it have been that Gonzales' car, being a 1950 build, had always kept the same type of engine, whereas the cars built in 1951 had the later, more powerful engine?\n\nTipo: 375 GP.\n\nChassis number: GP/50(2).\n\nFactory team.\n\nThe second Ferrari 375 F1 to be introduced at the 1950 Italian GP and this one was stamped as 'GP/50/2'. Almost certainly, Ascari's car at Monza and then used by him for the first two races of 1951. After this, it became the team's \"T\" (practice), car and it may have been driven by Froilan Gonzales to win the British GP. After this, the same car was driven by Ascari to claim victory at the German Grand Prix on the Nürburgring. It was last seen in 1951 when it was raced by Chico Landi at the Italian GP.\n\n1950:\n\n1950-09-03: Italian GP, Monza F1, GP50/2 Ferrari 375F1, #16 Alberto Ascari, engine, DNF.\n\n1950-10-29: GP de Penya Rhin, Pedralbes F1, GP/50/2, Ferrari 375F1, #2 Alberto Ascari, 1st.\n\n1951:\n\n1951-03-11: GP de Syracusa: A.

Indianapolis type lengthened chassis.\n\nAnd then?\n\nI admire your tenacity, but I'm convinced that this can't be done without meticulously studying as many period photographs as possible, and being prepared to disregard anything that's been written about these cars. I have often looked into this particular formicary over the past twenty, maybe thirty years without getting any wiser - clearly, there's something missing in all the erudite writings about the subject, and I think I know what it is: insight into the day-by-day dealings of the Scuderia as well as the Ferrari works. As no detailed factory or team records appear to have survived (IF they existed in the first place!), there's no way of knowing what went where, and which became which other by means of swapping engines, chassis parts, bodywork and, yes, tags! Keep in mind that each and every car is just a conglomerate of parts, which often interchange between 'entities' (and sometimes don't), which will make tracking those entities a challenge in even the best of circumstances. Unless you can establish a 'library' of preferably multiple 'birthmarks' for each chassis, and follow that through a substantial number of period photographs, all your efforts will amount to is clouding the picture with just another patchwork of guesses.\n\nHello Michael. Yes, I think you are quite right and I have looked at many photos over the last 25 years myself. I also think that you are right about knowing the \"inside\" details of how the Ferrari factory worked internally, particularly the race department.\n\nI am quite certain that the factory kept details of all of these cars and that that information is in their archives. Unfortunately for us authors, they don't want to let such information be seen....\n\nI believe that I have tracked the cars from 1948-1952 quite accurately , (except for the car that poor Villoresi had his accident in at Geneva, 30th July 1950). I do agree with Michael Muller, that car was repaired as GP3-50. There is also mystery over the 1950-1952 Tipo 375s although I can see that numbers 1,2 and 7 were sold privately outside the USA. Four went there, modified, as Indycars.\n\nRoger and several of the others have provided what is probably about as good a level of feedback as someone could ever expect.\n\nAs I have looked through this thread, I have wondered about your historiographical material.\n\nI sense that it is probably those items that Roger, Michael, and others have pored through as well.\n\nI also suspect that I have much of those materials sitting on my bookshelves or in my filing cabinets.\n\nPersonally, I have come to much the same conclusions as Michael: this is something that would stymie even the mission Impossible Force.\n\nI long ago came to the conclusion that much of this sort of information was, if not bogus in many respects, at least highly suspect.\n\nOne reason is the referring to a car as \"chassis 5\" or whatever rather as its number assigned by the racing shop.\n\nHelpful in some instances, but it also indicates an issue Michael (and others) raise regarding the paperwork for these cars.\n\nCarnets de Passage du Douane, Bills of Sale, and worksheets from this era are, alas, scarce.\n\nAlso, there is the issue of nomenclature that Nye (and perhaps Tanner, for that matter) and a few others note when it comes to referring to engines, for example.\n\nThe anglophone writers from whence much of all this is usually derived tended to simplify things for their audiences.\n\nOnce again, I refer to Michael and the idea that the Italian companies did not think like those in, say, the UK.\n\nThey were literally foreign in every sense of the word.\n\nNot to mention that is not until years later that anyone cared about any of this sort of thing.\n\nAll this said, good luck and I wish you well on this project. At the very least it should enlighten us on these cars and their era.\n\nDCapps: I gave up looking for bodywork differences when, some time ago, I released that the Ferrari factory were continuallyupdating/changing the bodywork on a lot of these F1/F2/FL cars in those early years especially. So I am still looking for information as to whether it was Tipo 375/2 or /5 that won the British GP in 1951. At this time I lean towards #2, as William Boddy, the editor of \"Motor Sport\", and a most particular man, said that it was numbered as number 2, and that used a single plug engine at Silverstone but that competes against Hans Tanner's evidence that, at Bremgarten earlier, Taruffi's car, 375/2, according to ORC, (Michael Ferner), that car had a 24 plug engine. Why go back to a less powerful engine for the British GP?\n\nMichael Ferner: I did not know that Ascari had driven a swing axle car in practice for the French GP in 1951. As far as I can see, all the swing axle cars had been sold by this time.\n\nI'm still trying to find the identity of \"125-C-03\" or whatever it was called, Villoresi's car at the F1 race at Geneva on 30th July 1951; this was the car that Villoresi had his bad crash in. It was a Lampredi engined, de Dion rear suspension car and Michael Muller probably has it right that this became GP3/50, which Serafini drove in the first few F2 races of 1951. Incidentally, I suspect that this car had a Tipo 340 engine as both Villoresi and Ascari lapped in identical times in qualifying, 1.48.7.\n\nAfter having looked at no end of Maserati 250Fs over the years, ANY inclination to ever go rivet-counting again is a non-starter.\n\nMichael is/was far more dedicated and devoted to this than I ever was, but he is correct about having to pay very close attention to the artifact as a whole -- including the context of any photos or documents -- to have any real idea as just Who-was-Who in the Ferrari jumble.\n\nI remember that the updates to the cars were one way to sense something was afoot at the factory.\n\nNot to put too fine a point to all this, but I realized early on that the Ferrari team's default setting on certain things was Creative Truths... known to today as Alternate Facts.\n\nMore than a few anglophone publications (I will not mention Hans Tanner by name, by the way...) got the Alternate Facts treatment and tended to take it as gospel. Just saying...\n\nHello Michael, having a swing axle car in practice in 1950 makes perfect sense, not 1951.\n\nThere was a very good cut away drawing by Harold Bubb, that appeared in the \"Motor Magazine on December 15th, 1951. I've looked at both the side view of the car and the view from above of the de Dion rear suspension. I am no engineer but I don't see anything that would require \"big bulges\" under the scuttle, only perhaps where the pairs of radius Armes come out from the chassis to the rear suspension. Is this what you are referring to, one above the other?\n\nDCapps: I take your point about creative truths/alternate facts, which is why, with the passage of time, it is so important to try to sort the wheat from the chaff. What really surprised me was finding out that at war's end, Ferrari had 160 plus people working for him and that, by 1950, there were over 250 staff. This was not a \"garagiste\" operation.....\n\n\"This was not a \"garagiste\" operation...\" Perhaps not, but simply more of a large scale Italian hot rod enterprise constantly seeking often creative ways to pay the overhead and keep the creditors at bay.\n\nThanks to the gullible folks that were willing fork over the money for products being cobbled together Ferrari was able to usually get by hand-to-mouth most of the time, but there was a reason Ferrari did not back away from the handout from FIAT... he really, really needed the money.\n\nKeep in mind that Ferrari did not have a foundry on-site until, what, 1955 to 1956?\n\nRemember also that so much of the operation was actually farmed/contracted out to little \"garagiste\" operations around the area at this time.\n\nThere are probably gazillions of bookshelves groaning with books about Ferrari and most of them it makes you very sad that so many trees died so that they could be produced.\n\nAt any rate, back to the 375/F1 cars: I think that cockpit photos were very helpful when I was crazy enough to consider this puzzle. Along with those of the firewall area, front and back.\n\n​I simply ran out of interest and had other far more interesting projects to research.\n\nBy the way, I also had some real reservations about much of the information I was dealing with and the hogwash I was often being fed.\n\nThere was a very good cut away drawing by Harold Bubb, that appeared in the \"Motor Magazine on December 15th, 1951. I've looked at both the side view of the car and the view from above of the de Dion rear suspension. I am no engineer but I don't see anything that would require \"big bulges\" under the scuttle, only perhaps where the pairs of radius Armes come out from the chassis to the rear suspension. Is this what you are referring to, one above the other?\n\nNo, nothing to do with the radius rods, I'm sure. To my surprise I found them also on the car Villoresi crashed at Geneve in 1950 (so, busting my own theory that they were a '51 feature). If you look at the pictures on this page, CPdB, View record [ID:890] (the-fastlane.co.uk), particularly the second from top with the clear side view, you can see the first one right next to the exhaust aperture, followed by only ten louvres (there were thirteen on the Silverstone and Nürburgring winner, I think, and also on the car Villoresi crashed at Bremgtarten CPdB, View record [ID:882] (the-fastlane.co.uk)) and then the second 'bulge'. Meanwhile, I have been thinking they had to do with the new gearbox introduced with the '51 cars, and maybe this was already on Villoresi's car in Geneve, but really I don't know.\n\nI'm getting sucked into this, which is not a good thing. I have too much on my plate to spend any more time on a subject I know I can't do justice.\n\nDCapps: Ferrari's foundry was installed at the factory in 1950. Your comments on the firewall/bulkhead are interesting, thank you. I shall take a look..\n\nRoger Clark: That 1958 \"Race of Two Worlds\" 375 was Ascari's 1952 Indianapolis car, Indycar 375/01. Following changes, it had been renumbered to 0388, whilst in Chinetti's hands. There is a very good post by Cabianca on this forum on 13th December, 2015 on this subject.\n\nMichael Werner: I have a good cutaway drawing of the \"new\" gearbox and its mounting points; they are all internal to the chassis so nothing to cover up with bodywork there. Thank you for that link. There are a couple more photos of Villoresi's crashed car at Geneva, on 30th July 1950 there that I had not seen before. That is the car that I should dearly like to identify what it had been before this iteration, if it was not new, which I don't know. It's commonly referred to as \"EX\" but was that a factory/team designation? It certainly had a lot of new features, de Dion rear axle, 340 engine, gearbox. More \"GP49\" than \"125-C\" type.\n\nTheory: If Taruffi's 1951 Bremgarten car was a new for 1951 car, (labelled by ORC as \"4\"), perhaps his previous \"Tipo 340-Pedralbes 1950\" car was kept back as a test car in 1951? Perhaps that had been the Villoresi car at Geneva? We have chassis numbers 1, 2 and 7 being sold at the end of the season, 1 became 010 Thinwall Special, (I reason this due to the dates of that \"Works\" car disappearing from ORC results and then reappearing as the \"Thinwall Special\"number 010, but could be wrong! 2, was sold to Landi after the 1951 Italian GP and 7 went to Rosier end of 1951. That leaves 3,4,5 and 6 as being modified and going to Indianapolis for 1952. We know, from Keith Blumel's piece in \"Cavallino\", (Sorry, there is no date on the pages that I have read), that this was originally, in 1951, chassis number 3. What the other three were numbered in Indycar form, I don't know and am not sure if it's important here.\n\nThe point here is a \"number 4\" Tipo 375 was used in the 1952 British GP support race and at Boreham, driven by Villoresi. In 1953, Ascari drove a 375 at Albi on 31st May. Could this have been the 125-C-04 that was left in Argentina, and not 375/4?\n\nAnd... Still trying to work out whether 375/50/2 or 375/51/5 won the 1951 British GP...\n\nEdited by Writer2, 21 January 2024 - 19:32."
