New Apex in Czech/Soviet Bloc Tensions a. Czech Leadership vs. Hard-Line Soviet Blocl After a period of relative calm in relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Bloc during May and June, tensions suddenly escalated to the porportions of a major crisis as evidenced by the Bloc summit meeting in Warsaw 14-15 July to discuss developments in Czechoslovakia. The im- portance attached to the meeting was underlined by the fact that it was attended by the highest level leaders of the Bloc, including Party boss Brezhnev, Premier Kosygin, and President Podgorny from the Soviet Union, and the Party Chiefs, Premiers (or Deputy Premiers), and others from the hard-line Bloc countries. The Czechs had apparently been urged by letters from the individual Bloc countries to attend the meeting, but they refused and proposed instead that bilateral meetings be held in Prague. In the meantime, Soviet troops ominously remained in Czechoslovakia long after conclusion of the Warsaw Pact military exercises, finding one pretext after another for delaying their departure. And though some movement out of the country seems underway, their complete departure is far from assured at this point. The Soviet Bloc, especially the Soviet Union, Poland, and East Germany as the most deeply concerned of the group, have made it a point to get on record for their own public, for Czechoslovakia, and for the rest of the world, that they regard certain developments in Czechoslo- vakia as constituting potential counterrevolution with connections to \"ag- gressive imperialist forces.\" This allegation is evoked not only to warn the Czech leaders and people of how gravely their allies view developments there, but provides the Bloc with the excuse to take whatever measures they view as necessary to restore Czechoslovakia to orthodox Communism, once more obeying Moscow's orders. As of this writing, western news sources claim that the Czechs have won their point of asking for bilateral talks with Bloc members, but have conceded the Bloc point that joint talks should follow. Rumania, Yugoslavia, and the Communist Parties of Italy and France have reacted strongly against pressure on Czechoslovakia and are acting, by official statements, propaganda, and talks with leaders, to persuade the Soviets to moderate their pressure. (Free World parties, especially, recognize that their prestige and the success of their policies within their own countries may be gravely jeopardized by Soviet actions in Czecho- slovakia.) The further course of the fast-breaking situation is a matter of speculation, but a selection of what could have been the key events that so rapidly escalated the uneasy truce of recent weeks into a major confrontation may be useful in understanding the fundamental issues sepa- rating the protagonists. 1The \"Soviet Bloc\" for present purposes will be considered to include the regimes of East Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, in addition to the Soviet Union, but to exclude Rumania and Czechoslovakia.

Steps to Crisis The main object of Bloc propaganda hostile to Czechoslovakia has been the free-swinging, uncensored Czech press and other news media, which are more liberal and more insistent on and impatient for implementing the prom- ises of democratization in the Czech Action Program than the Czech CP leadership is (or can be). The news media have not only subjected domestic political phenomena to critical scrutiny, but have also responded with asperity and speed to criticism of various kinds from the controlled press of East Germany, Poland, and the USSR. The Soviets seem to have been will- ing to adopt a \"wait-and-see\" attitude for a time (as during and after Kosygin's stay in Czechoslovakia for several days in May) and undoubtedly were satisfied with the repeated avowals by the Czechs that adherence to the Warsaw Pact was a key element in their Bloc relationships and that the Czechoslovak Communist Party (CzCP) would under no circumstances relinquish its leading role (and as an earnest of this intention, the Czechs took steps to eliminate the possibility of establishing independent political parties). However, at the end of June, two events were publicized in the Czech press: the results of a devastating public opinion poll exposing the lack of popular support of the CzCP (thus exploding another carefully nurtured Communist myth) was published in no less a newspaper than Rude Pravo, of- ficial organ of the CzCP, on 26 and 27 June 1968; and a \"2000-Word Mani- festo,\" signed by 70 prominent Czechoslovaks from many fields of endeavor (both Party and non-Party) and sent to the CzCP Presidium (Politburo) was published simultaneously in four Prague newspapers on 27 June, demanding a purge of anti-Dubcek conservative forces in the CzCP, vowing resistance to any outside interference, with weapons if necessary, and urging the forma- lation of free citizens' associations to become, in effect, pressure groups (if not political parties) to support and advance all liberalization mea- sures. The CzCP Presidium immediately disavowed the manifesto. The East Germans, Poles, and Bulgarians denounced the \"2000-Words\" first, but the definitive word came in prestigious Soviet media. Waiting until 10 July, Literaturnaya Gazeta denounced it in elaborately sarcastic language, termed it a call to counterrevolution, and went to the extraordinary length of denouncing a prominent Communist leader, Frantisek Kriegel, head of the National Front, for expressing solidarity with it. More important, Pravda. on 11 July, in an article under the name of I. Aleksandrov, made reference to the action of \"right-wing and actually counterrevolutionary forces\" in Czechoslovakia, \"evidently associated with imperialist reaction\" and omi- nously drew a parallel between the current situation in Czechoslovakia and that preceding Soviet military intervention in Hungary in 1956. Finally Sovetskaya Rossiya, an organ of the RSFSR Party Federation, linked these counterrevolutionary forces to western intelligence services. However the Soviets may actually have sized up the radical activity of the Czech press or individual liberals on the scene, they could hardly have been reassured by the reaction of the top Czech leadership to the \"2000-Words.\" Though all the highest official party and government organs Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 2 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 had denounced the document in more or less strong terms, Dubcek and Smrkovsky, as perhaps the two most prominent Czech leaders, publicly stated (long before the Soviets had taken a stand on it) that they personally viewed the 70 signers of the document as honorable and decent citizens, but condemned the text as \"irresponsible\" and a piece of \"political romanti- cism\" which in its extremeness would play into the hands of conservative party elements. (They were proved even more correct than they may have intended, as the subsequent events showed: Soviet reaction found expres- sion in the press articles referred to above and ultimately in the Warsaw summit meeting, letters to the Czech leadership, communiques, etc.) The poll, the \"2000-Words,\" the Dubcek/Smrkovsky reaction, plus Smrkovsky's statement that the \"conservatives\" (i.e., Novotny & Co.) now represented the greatest danger to the Czech experiment, coupled with pushing through an amendment to the press law officially abolishing censorship, apparently brought the Soviets to a parting of the ways with the Czech leadership, convincing them that the leadership was unable or unwilling to bring under control these actually, or potentially, subversive elements on the Czech scene. c. Long-term Considerations Viewed in the longer term, the Soviets surveying their position in the international Communist movement and faced with a constellation of in- dependent Communist regimes, (Yugoslavia, Communist China, Albania, Ru- mania) pursuing foreign policies independent of or contrary to Soviet re- quirements, each with its own way of running its internal affairs, finally became convinced that the Dubcek regime in turn is formulating yet another unique and independent Communist dictatorship, a dictatorship that wants to permit freedom of public expression as well as other innovations that taken together would make Czechoslovakia a new type of socialist state. If Czechoslovakia were to be permitted to develop unchallenged along its own unique lines, the popular pressure in East Germany and Poland to emu- late the free spirit manifesting itself in neighboring Czechoslovakia might become well nigh unbearable, and it would undoubtedly have untold repre- cussions in the Soviet Union itself. 2. Another Step toward the World Communist Conference Most other events normally of some interest on the international Com- munist scene were overshadowed by the drama of Czechoslovakia confronting the Soviet Bloc, but brief note may be taken of a few. It should be duly recorded that the Working Group of the World Communist Conference Prepara- tory Commission announced completion of its task of drafting an agenda for the full scale conference, to be held in Moscow on 25 November 1968. A brief, uninformative announcement dated 21 June, the text of which was shorter than the space needed to list the 38 participating parties (Rumania attended as an observer), offered no clue to the resolution of the funda- mental difference of opinion which persists among Communists the world over: what is the role of the CPSU among the world's Communist parties? According to some news reports, the Italian Communist Party, typifying Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 3 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 those many parties that want a loose form of international organization and ideology, seeks international unity \"around the CPSU\" rather than \"under the leadership of the CPSU\" (this latter formulation being one way to indicate Moscow's desire to force unity). The difference was suffi- ciently crucial to warrant Moscow's sending a top delegation (led by Andrei Kirilenko, Secretary of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee) to Rome in late June to discuss the matter with Italian CP leaders. The cur- rent trend in Czech/Soviet relations can only highlight this conflict in international Communism. One more preparatory meeting was scheduled for September, though the last official communique made no mention of such a meeting. 3. Cuba Rebuffs World Youth Festival The much-beleaguered and twice-aborted 9th World Youth Festival (WYF) has sustained another setback at its 11th hour. Cuba announced its boy- cott of this event on Radio Havana on 28 June. The Festival is to take place in Sofia, Bulgaria, 28 July-6 August 1968 after two false starts: one in Algeria in 1965 when the toppling of the Ben Bella regime forced its postponement, and the other in Ghana in 1966 when Nkrumahs fall from power necessitated further rescheduling and relocating. According to the 28 June Havana Radio broadcast, the Young Communist League of Cuba (YCL) had already cabled the festival organizers their de- cision not to attend this event and had stated that Cuban youth \"follow- ing the spirit, teachings and example of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, sup- port the principle of armed struggle\" implying that this strategy was rejected by the festival's organizers (the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) and the International Union of Students (IUS), both Soviet- dominated international fronts). The Cuban boycott constitutes an embarrassing and serious setback to the Soviet Union, the chief backer and guiding spirit of the festival, and its co-sponsoring fronts since widely distributed festival literature has announced that \"a special day of solidarity with Cuba\" would be part of the program of this event and since it implies Cuban-Soviet party differ- ences, which could in turn affect future Cuban party participation in Soviet-organized international events such as the Moscow World Communist Conference in November.

Then followed another bad time with events which threatened the nation's spiritual health and character. The majority of the nation hopefully accepted the program of socialism. Its direction got into the hands of the wrong people, hewever. It would not have mattered so much that ..hey did not have sufficient statesmanlike experience, practical knowledge, or philosophical education, if they had at least possessed more Commonsense and decency, It they had been able to listen to the opinion of others, and if they had allowed themselves to be gradually replaced by more capable peOple. The Communist Party, which after the war possessed the great trust of the people, gradually exchanged this trust for offices, until it had all offices and nothing else. We must put it this way, and those communists among us know it to be so and their disappointment over the results is as great as the disappointment of the others. The incorrect line of the leadership changed the party from a political party and an ideological alliance into a power organization which became very attractive also to egotists avid for rule, calculating cowards, and unprincipled people. Their influx into the party affected the nature and the conduct of the party. Its internal organization was not such that honest people could gain influence in it without shameful incidents, that such people could change it to bring it continuously into line with the modern world. Many communists fought this decline, but they did not succeed in preventing what happened. The situation in the Communist Party was the pattern and cause of a similar situation in the state. The party's linking with the state led to the party's becoming accustomed to remaining aloof from the executive power. There was no criticism of the activity of the state and economic organizations. Parliament forgot how to proceed, the government forgot how to rule, and the directors how to direct. Elections had no significance and the laws lost their weight. We could not confide in our representatives in any committee, and if we could trust them we could not ask them to do anything because they could change nothing. It was still worse that we could no trust even one another. Personal and collective honor declined. Honesty lead nowhere and it was useless to speak of any appreciation for ability. Therefore, most people lost interest in public affairs; they were concerned only with themselves and with money. These bad cenditions also brought the result that now one cannot even rely on the money, :Relations amang people were sPiled, joy work was lost; to sum up, the country reached a point where its spiritual health and character were threatened. .ee are all responsible for the present state of affairs. The greater responsibility rests with the communists among us. The main responsibility, however, rests with those who were component parts or instruments of uncontrolled power. It was the power of an opinionated group placed, with the help of the party apparatus, everywhere from Prague to each district and community. The apparatus decided what one might or might not do, and the apparatus directed the cooperatives for the cooperative members, the factories for the workers, and the national committees for the citizens. No organization actually belonged to its members, not even the communist organization. The main guilt of and the greatest deception peipetrated by these rulers was that they presented their arbitrariness as the will of the workers. If we wanted to believe this deception we would now have to blame the workers for the decline of . our economy, for the crimes against innocent people, for the introduction of cen- sorship which made it impossible for all this to be written about. The workers were to blame for the mistaken inveltments, for the losses in trade, for the shortage of apartments. Naturally, no sensible person believes in such guilt on the part of the workers. We all know and, in particular, each worker knows that in practice the workers didnet deaide anything. It was someone else who controlled the workers' Approved For Release 2095/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 CPYRGHT representatives' vote.

In effect, they took the place of the overt rown c.ass an. emselveS became the new authority. Per the sake of justice, we will say that some of them long ago realized this bad game of history. We know them now by the fact that they are redressing wrongs, correcting mistakes, returning decision-making power to the membership and the citizens, and limiting the authority and the numbers of the apparatus of officials. -hey are with us against the obsolete views in the party membership. But many lt,-Sicials arc still opposing changes and they still carry weight! They still imld instruments of power, especially in the districts and in the communities, where they may use these instruments secretly and unimpeachably. em the beginning of the current year we have been in the revival process of lemocratlzation. It began in the Communist Party. We must say this, and the eeople among us outside the party also know it who, until recently, expected no eood to come from us. We must edd,however, that this peocess could not begin elsewhere. After a full 20 years only the communists could live something like a political life; only communist criticism was in a position to basically assess things; only the opposition within the Communist Party had the privilege of being In contact with the enemy. The initiative and efforts of the democratic communists therefore is only an installment in the repayment of the debt the entire party Incurred with the people outside the party, whom it kept in a position in which they did not have equal rights. Therefore, no gratitude is due the Communist Party, although it should probably be acknowledged that it is honestly striving to use the last opportunity to save its own and the nation's honor. The revival process is not bringing any very new things. It is producing ideas and suggestions many of which are older than the errors of our socialism and othOIS* of which emerged under the surface of visible events. They shoUld have been expressed long ago however, they were suppressed. tet us not cherish the illuSiehthatIliSe ideas are now victorious through the force of truth. Their victory was decided 4.ither by the weakness of the old leadership which, obviously, first had to be weakened by a rule of 20 years in which no one hampered it. Obviously, all the wrong elements hidden in the foundations and the ideology of this system had to mature until .they gained their full form. Therefore, let us nOt overestimate the significance of the criticism from the ranks of writers and'students. The source of social change is the economy. The right word carries significance only if it is spoken under conditions which have already been duly prepared. Duly prepared conditions--in our country, unfortunately, We , must understand this term to mean our general poverty.and the complete disintegration' of the old system of rule in which politicians of a certain type calmly and peacefully compromised themselves at our expense. Thus, truth is not victorious; truth simply remains when everything else goo to waste! There is no cause for a national celebration of victory, there is Mere34: cause for new hope. We turn to you in this moment of hope, which, however, is still threatened. It took several months for many of us to believe that they could speak out, and Many still do not yet believe it. Nevertheless, we have spoken up, and so many things have been revealed that somehow we must complete our aim of humanizing this regime. Otherwise, the revenge of the old forces would be cruel. We turn mainly to those who have so far only waited. The time which is coming will be decisive for many years. The time Which is coming is summer, with its vacations and holidays, when, according to old habit, we will want to leave everything. We can be certain', however, that our dear adversaries will not indulge in summer recreation, that they will mobilise those who aresobliged to them, and that even now they are trying to arrange for Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 2 CPYRGH calm piristmas01441 1aar'sl .us t 21)pegonp ruaserfdoBro6P17 Mlegii1R120118413116,1A6064C4)0300 let 35-18)e h; un ei,STaAa-it and respond to it. Let us renounce the impossible demand that someone higher up must always give us the only possible interpretation of 'things and one simple conclusion. Each of us will have to be responsible for drawing his own conclusions. Commonly agreed-upon conclusions can be reached jonly by discussion, and this requires the freedom of expression which actually i is our only democratic achievement of the current year. ;In the coming days we will have to display our initiative and determination. Primarily we will oppose viewS, should they arise, that it is possible to conduct sonia sort of democratic revival without the ooMMunists or possibly against them. ;This would be both unjust and unreasonable. The communists have the developed organizations and we should support the progressive wing within them. They have experienced officials and, last but not least, they also have in their hands the decisive levers and buttons. Their action program has been submitted to the public; :it is a program for the initial adjustment of the greatest inequality and no one else has any similarly specific program. We must demand that local action :programs be submitted in each district and each community. Here, we shall have .suddenly taken very ordinary and long expected correct steps. The Czechoslovak . Communist Party is preparing for the congress which will elect a new Central :Committee. Let us demand that it be better than the current one. If the Communist :Party now says that in the future it wants to base its leading position on the citizens' confidence and not on force, let us believe this as long as we can :believe in the people whom it is now sending as delegates to the district and ;regional conferences. Years have recently been expressed that the process of democratization has stopped- 'This feeling is partly a. manifestation of fatigue caused by troubled times and it is partly due to the fact that the seasonior surprising revelations, resignations from high places, and intoxicating speeches of unprecedented verbal boldness is -past. However, the struggle of forces has merely become less evident to a certain .extent. The fight is now being waged over the content and implementation of laws, over the scope of practical steps (to be taken). In addition, we must give the new people, the ministers, prosecutors, chairmen, and secretaries time to 'work. They have the right to this time so that they can either make good or prove ;impossible. Apart from this, one cannot presently expect more of the central ;political organs, The practical quality of the future democracy depends on what becomes of the .enterprises and what will happen in them. In all our discussions it is the economicsts who control things. One must seek out good managers and see to it that they get good positions. It is true that, compared to the mature countries, we are badly paid, and some are even worse off. We can demand more money--it can be printed, but at the same time its value 'diminishes. Let us rather demand that directors and ctairmen explain to us the nature and extent of expenditures they want in order to produce, to whom they want to sell their products and at what price, the profit from this, what part of it is invested in the modernization of production, and what can be distributed.. Under apparently boring headlines, a very hard struggle is going on in the press' relating to democracy and the manager. As producers, the workers can intervene in this struggle through their choice of the people whom they elect to the ;enterprise management and enterprise councils. .As employees they will do what is best for themselves when they elect as their representatives in the trade.

Modest as this progress may be, it is nevertheless encouraging in view of the many and varied problems of development confronting the Latin American countries. Collapse of the Post-War Boom The great growth period which Latin America experienced in the years following World War II ended after 1957. Exchange balances were exhausted, and the threat of Communism, highlighted by Castro's revolution in Cuba, marked the beginning of a heavy exodus of capital. Unemployment, excessive inflation and the decline of export earnings brought the region to a criti- cal point between 1958 and 1960. A number of the dictatorships which had been sustained by the boom period were overthrown, and the liberal, demo- cratic governments which replaced them were faced with almost insurmountable problems, often with little understanding of the principles of economic development or realistic economic plans to build on. Although some prog- ress was made toward recovery and the control of inflation, and the Alli- ance for Progress was set in motion, the early 1960s brought a deteriora- tion in the situation and considerable pessimism was generated regarding Latin America's economic future. Incentives to Economic Cooperation Since World War II, new influences in the economic field have nudged Latin America into giving more serious consideration to economic coopera- tion. All of the countries of the area attempted, at first separately, to diversify and industrialize their economies which brought to light numer- ous disadvantages and inadequacies in terms of population, natural resources and skilled manpower. Out of obvious necessity, a leaning towards economic cooperation began to develop among Latin American neighbors. This tend- ency has received strong stimulus from the United Nations Economic Commis- sion for Latin America (ECLA) which has made extensive studies of the nature and problems of the individual economies of the Latin American countries, and conducted simultaneously a campaigh for closer relations among the Latin American nations with the ultimate aim of their formation into a single economic unit. The European Common Market has also influenced the move toward greater economic unity. It has served to demonstrate tat it is possible for sev- eral different nations with a tradition of conflicting interests ,to merge their economies. At the same time the European tommon Market has given preference to the produce of former European ailonies in Africa, and these products compete directly with some of the major Latin American exports. This has aroused fear among Latin American countries of being shut out Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 from the Western European markets and has thus served as an impetus for them to look to one another as potential markets. The United States has been another strong influence for economic co- operation. It has demonstrated its support by the original agreements establishing the Alliance for Progress in 1961 and by its participation in the Conference of Presidents in Punta del Este in April 1967. This conference was particularly noteworthy in that the idea of a cooperative, inter-dependent Latin America moved from the level of technical discus- sion to the level of political consideration, and from that conference emerged a new emphasis on self-help and cooperation as the ultimate, deter- mining factor in solving the economic and social problems of the region. Most recently, the July, 1968 meeting of the five Central American presidents at San Salvador to discuss means of strengthening the Central American Common Market (CACM) -- with President Johnson attending as an- other demonstration of United States support and encouragement -- hopefully served as an incentive to the leaders of these countries to renew their efforts to break through some of the many barriers that stand in the way of further cooperation and integration between their nations. Progress on the Sub-Regional Level: The Central American Common Market The aAcm comprises a much smaller area and involves a smaller volume of trade than the larger Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA); it made notable progress between 1960 and 1966. It started by establish- ing free trade for all products of the member countries except where exemp- tion was claimed on the basis of harm to producers or to government price- support programs. In this six-year period, the value of intra-regional trade increased more than five-fold and accounted for one-fifth of the total trade of member countries with all countries of the world. With the trend toward industrialization, trade in manufactured goods markedly in- creased. In 1967, however, there was about a 5% drop in extra-regional export earnings and the per capita GNP growth for the region was only .8 percent. Under the CACM, institutions have been set up to deal with over- all regional development, but the success of these, and of future plans for the area, will depend on the long-range success of the CACM itself. A Central American bank, clearing house and various financial councils are already in existence, and future plans include a full monetary union, with consideration being given to such joint projects as a road system, an electric power grid and a telecommunications net. The Andean Common Market An organizational meeting of another sub-regional group was held in June 1967, following the conference of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council at Vina del Mar, Chile. At the organizational meeting, delegates from Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela constituted themselves as the Mixed Commission to set up the Andean Common Market, a sub-regional trade association within the LAFTA structure.

The idea of such a group had been conceived the previous August in Bogota, at a meeting of the heads of state (or their representatives) of the countries concerned. The Mixed Commission has met several times since June 1967, and has appointed and supervised technical working groups involved with planning and drafting the charter of the group, as well as with studies and preliminary agree- ments on various aspects of Andean integration. Such controversial issues as the removal of trade barriers within this region, the establishment of a common external tariff -- such as the CACM now has on almost all items -- relations of the Andean group with LAFTA, etc. have also been discussed. Although the intial momentum of the group has slowed somewhat because of differences arising from national interests, in February of this year the Mixed Commission adopted the charter of an Andean Development Corporation. After it is ratified by the member governments and the group is in opera- tion, its headquarters will be located in Caracas. (Venezuela will con- tribute approximately 22% of the initial public capital of $25 million.) The group has also been negotiating an agreement that would foster the development of a new petrochemical industry within the sub-region. Other Multi-national Efforts at Cooperation Some of the Latin American nations have made other moves toward coop- erative development, although outside the framework of any formal struc- ture. At a meeting in May in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, the foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay drew up a cooperative economic plan for the development of the rich and fertile basin of the Rio de la Plata for flood control, hydroelectric and dredging projects on various tributaries of the Plata, and for modernization of port facilities in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The entire plan, originally conceived some twenty-five years ago, would require more thah thirty years to complete and would need extensive financing through various international agencies. The draft treaty institutionalizing the River Plata organization is to be submitted to the governments by mid-September 1968. The foreign ministers are then scheduled to meet by mid-November 1968 to sign the agreement. Shortly after the Santa Cruz meeting the foreign ministers of Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Paraguay met in Lima to expedite planning and work on a proposed 3,000-mile road stretching from Caracas through Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina to Buenos Aires. It would run mainly east of the Andes, the traditional barrier dividing the eastern and western regions of South America. President Belaunde of Peru has provided the major impetus for this road, and Peru, in spite of her economic problems, has made studies and started actual construction on her portion of the highway. At about the same time, the governments of Peru and Argentina announc- ed their agreement to promote closer cooperation on economic and other com- mon problems through the establishment of a special commission. The an- nouncement was made following a meeting of the Peruvian and Argentinian foreign ministers in Lima.

However, a very positive factor which favors continued forward mo- tion is the number of Latin American leaders who recognize the economic imperatives of her present situation. These men have been making honest efforts to build individually viable economies in her many states; the ultimate aim of many of these leaders is the eventual combining of selected segments of the individual economies into a successfully cooperating and infinitely stronger whole. 4 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 eatructural?Ormal.:_ En una reunidn celebrada en mayo en Santa Cruz, Bolivia, los Cancilleres de Argentina, Brasil, Bolivia, Paraguay y Uruguay redactaron un plan de cooperacidn econdmica para el desarrollo de la rica y fdrtil cuenca del Rfo de la Plata, obras de defensa contra inundaciones, hidroeldctricas y de dragado en varios tributarios del Plata y modernizacidn portuaria en Buenos Aires y Montevideo.

A half-dozen nations are talc- ing part. Their goal is a thriving new common mar- ket that will stretch 4,750 miles from the Caribbean at the north, down South America's long Pacific Coast to Chile's Cape Horn at the south. The common market court- tries call themselves the An- dean Group. They are sub- merging their rivalries and are starting their historic move toward unification partly because they are im- patient with the slow prog- ress of the bigger, seven- year old Latin Airgrle^rt Vree Trade Association and partly because they want to be able to stand up against relatively powerful Brazil Dnd Mexico when LAFTA Li- tany becomes A reality. In addition to Colombia And Chile, the Andean Group includes Venezuela to ihe east and Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia to the south. The six have a potential narket of 60 million people, ncluding Colombia's 20 mil- ion, and account for almost ne-fourth of Latin Ameri- lation of 250 million.

ARGENTINE-PERUVIAN JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED Lima--On 25 May the governments of Peru and Argentina agreed to create a special mixed commission to promote economic and commercial relations between the two countries and to discuss various problems of common interest. They also decided to cooperate more closely in international organizations such as the United Nations and the OAS in order to defend their legal bases, and to cooperate in the reorganization of the Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA). The two countries also agreed to defend the sovereignty of their 200-mile territorial waters limits, while Peru promised that all ational and official publications would use the name of Malvinas in referring to the islands over which Argentina claims ownership. These agreements appear in a joint Peruvian-Argentine communique signed by the foreign ministers of the two countries, Raul Ferrero and Nicanor Costa Mendez, following their discussions. The communique, consisting of 15 points, is accompanied by a note in which Argentina proposes the creation of the special Argentine-Peruvian commission. The points of the document are as follows: 1--The two foreign ministers agree that relations between the two countries reflect their fraternal and cordial friendship [words indistinct] under the ideals of San Martin. 2--Taking into consideration the cooperation of the they agree to intensify their efforts to defend the maintain permanent contact so that this cooperation 3--They reaffirm their adherence to the OAS charter the progress of the American organization. two countries in the United Nations, U.N. postulates for peace and to will increase.

The Argentine foreign minister received with great interest Peru's expression of its wish to increase its exports to Argentina, especially industrial products. . .0--To attain these .objectives, the foreign ministers signed a note creating a special Argentine-Peruvian coordinating commission. 9--They declare the commission's intention to study the possibility of establishing branches of both countries' state banks in Lima and Buenos Aires, and to consider a line of credit from the Argentine Central Bank for the purchase or capital goods [words indistinct] amended by Peruvian organizations. 10--They satisfactorily confirmed the common goal of the legal positions adopted by the two countries in regard to maritime sovereignty and the protection and defense of their marine wealth. They reaffirmed as a norm of their maritime policy the. principle of sovereignty over the continental shelf and the sea adjacent to their coasts up to a distance of 200 miles. 11--Within the framework of Latin American solidarity, they considered the situation of the Malvinas Islands, The Peruvian foreign Minister accepted with satisfaction the request of his Argentine colleague for that name to appear in all Peruvian national publications [several words indistinct] and also in material published by the OAS. 12--Agreeing that scientific and technological advances must necessarily be taken' advantage of to insure continued social and economic development, they agreed to draw up a pact on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. 13--To promote their cultural relations, they will create the mi.xed commission contem- plated in the Peruvian-Argentine cultural agreement as soon as possible to study, in conjunction with international organizations, the-validity of the diplomas [word indistinct] for the exercise of liberal professions. 14?Cons1dering that the friendship of nations should be strengthened by a knowledge of their true values, and taking into account the fact that tourism contributes to this, they agreed to promote tourism between the two countries. 15--Pinally, they resolved to continue consultations to satisfy their common interests, and pointed out that the visit of Dr Costa Mendez was a highly significant event in the fraternal friendship between the two countries. A special note proposed by Argentina emphasized the need to create a special Peruvian- -Argentine commission to promote economic relations between the two countries. This commission will also examine the development of commercial ties and analyze various peripheral problems of common interest in order to overcome them in a spirit of full cooperation. Since both parties had said this commission should begin work as soon as possible, they agreed, according to the note, to hold immediate consultations', to call a meeting of representatives of both governments to create the commission and prepare the rules that will govern its functioning..

Paraguay, and Peru or the continent- spanning jungle highway.. After thanking the foreign delegations for coming, Belaunde said that the meeting did not detract from continental goals, inasmuch as it was necessary to stir regional groups toward solving their problems. \"Belaude then explained the importance of the jungle highway, which will faoilitate the exploitation of tropical oil resources, the uniting of the South American ' watershed aith a view toward integration, and the surmounting of past disagreements among the countries of the area, since it will merge them in.a struggle to conquer a zone where the surplus Andean populations could be settled. The Peruvian Chief Executive'said that the highway is added to the integration projects and others being 4 carried out by the countries in the field of hydroelectric power, the uniting of river basins, and possibly the opening of an interoceanio canal in Colombia. 'Argentine Foreign Minister Costa Mendez replied in the; name of the visiting.countrieS. He said that the jungle highway will promote the economic development of the peoples from Venezuela to Argentina and permit them to know each other better.' Costa Mendez said that he was confident that resolutions of major importance would be adopted. The Argentine minister pointed to the need for these republics to make a sustained effort to attain their objectives, for the population explosion could thwart all population-absorbing programs. \"The four ministers will continue their work tomorrow, when the meeting ends, and issue a communique concerning links in the four republics' road systems and the economic development projects the highway will make possible. INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS :31 May 1968 FOUR FOREIGN MINISTERS SIGN ACT OF LIMA Lima--The foreign ministers of Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru at dawn today signed the Act of Lima, following two days of discussion of the need to strengthen efforts to link the communications systems of the four countries The act was signed by Argentine Foreign Minister Nicandor Costa Mendez, Bolivian Foreign Minister Tomas Guillermo Elio, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Raul Scpena Pastor, and Peruvian Premier Raul Ferrero Rebagliatti. The first point of the document stated that the jungle highway is the lf.nls between the eastern Andrean slope and the Plata Basin through its interconections with the national communications networks. The document recommended among other things that, in order to achieve the results and as long as it is considered necessary, Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) resources should be used. During the course of the meetings of the four foreign ministers, which lasted 2 days, the formation of a quadripartite' communications commission was approved to carry out financial and technical studies for the interconnection of the jungle highway through a coordinating committee. Approval was also given for financing the linking of Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina with the Plata Basin through the trans-Chaco route with IDB loans. Although the amount of the loans was not specified, unofficial figures estimated that at least 40 million dollars will be required from each country.

In this respect, Paraguayan Foreign Minister Sapena Pastor felt that to tie the issue of the Jungle highway to' the secondary roads would impede financing of the project: This point remained to be discussed and dealt with by the working committee set up at the meetingi which Will operate from its permanent headquarters in Lima.

Varias de las dictaduras que se habfan tantenido debido al apogeo economic? fueron depuestas y los gobiernos democrdticos liberales que las reemplazaron se abocaron a problemas casi insalvables, a menudo con poca comprension de los prin- cipios del desarrollo econOrico o planes econdmicos realistas sobre los cuales construir. No obstante haberse progresado algo en direccion a la recuperaciOn y el controlde la inflac56n y haberse puesto en movimiento la Alianza para el Progreso, el principio de la ddcada del 60 trajo un deterioro en la situaciOn y se produjo bastante pesimismo con respect? al futuro econ6mico de Amdrica Latina.

It is known that at the January and subsequent plenums of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, mistakes and shortcomings in leading the development of the. national economy and in the activities of party and government organs in regard to the violation of Leninist prinoiplos of socialist construction were subjected to oritioism. The Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee stressed the necessity of eliminating these mistakes and shortcomings in the interests of the consolidation and further development of the socialist society of the .Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. Measures designed to strengthen the economy, to develop socialist democracy, enhance the leading role of the Communist Party in the life of the society, and further develop the friendship between Czechoslovakia on one hand and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries on the other were adopted. The time that has elapsed since the January plenum of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee has shown that the solution of problems facing the party and the nation is impeded by difficulties caused primarily by the reactivization and increasing subversion of rightwing, antisocialist forces. Forces in Czechoslovakia hostile to socialism are striving to denigrate and discredit the working class and the leading force in society; to undermine the foundations of the -socialist state for the ultimate purpose of turninE Czechoslovakia back onto the road of the restoration of capitalism. The enemies are trying to undermine the friendship of Czechoslovakia with the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries. The May plenum of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee emphasized that in present circumstances the party considers it of the greatest importance not to 'tolerate any threat to the socialist character of power and social 'order on the part of antisocialist and openly anticommunist forces. The plenum demanded that the party's political leadership of the society be insured and all attempts to discredit the party as a whole, to spread nonconfidence in the party and deny its moral and political right to lead society and be the decisive political factor of socialist state power be refuted. The course of events in Czechoslovakia following the May plenum of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee shows that the plenum's warnings were fully justified. Rightwing antisocialist forces are continuing to increase malicious, intensive attacks against the Communist Party and the socialist system. Many of the undermining actions are, moreover, being made openlythrough the use of the Czechoslovak press, radio, and television. Thum recently a so-called open letter was published simultaneously in four Czechoslovak newspapers--LITERANI LIST?, PRACE, ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY, and MLADA FRONTA--by a group of persons, entitled \"2,000 Words\" and addressed to workers, peasants, employees, scientists, scientific workers, to all citizens. This document constitutes a kind of platform of those forces in Czechoslovakia and outside who, under cover of talk about liberalization, democratization, and such, are trying to cancel out the entire history of Czechoslovakia since 1948, and the socialist achievements of Czechoslovak workers, to discredit the Czechoslovak Communist Party, and its leading role, to undermine the Czechoslovak people's friendship with the peoples of fraternal socialist states, to prepare the way for counterrevolution. The authors of the document slander the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the 'socialist system, alleging that a mistaken line by the leadership has turned the party-.froma,_ political party and ideological union into a great-power organization, that parliament\" N.- is supposed to have lost its ability to debate problems, the government to rule, direct, or to manage; that allegedly not a single organization has belonged to its members, even the Communist Party, and that the Communist Party deserves no gratitude at all.

They promise to act by force of arms to promote that leadership to which , they will give their mandate, ne \"2,000 Words\" statement, in spite of its hypocritical phrases about the defense the interests of the Czechoslovak people, leaves no doubt about the real aims of its authors. They speak in the name of those rightwing, antisocialist forces in country which are waging an attack against the Czechoslovak Communist Party and the working class. Every day brings fresh facts confirming that these forces are by mewls concerned about the correation of any mistakes, about the further development, .e of Czechoslovakia along the road of socialism, but have embarked on the course of overthrowing the existing system, and restoring capitalist ways. They do not say this openly; most'freenently they conceal their real aims with phrases about demo- cratization and declare their dedication to socialism. But in fact they are seeking to undermine the very foundations of the socialist state. Such tealties are not new. They were used at one time by counterrevolutionary elements, in Hungary who attempted tn undermine the Hungarian people's socialist achieve- merits in 1956. Now, 20 years later, the tactics of those who would like to under- mine the foundations of socialism in Czechoslovakia have become even more sophistioate'd and perfidious, and the Czechoslovak working people, all those who cherish the aehievemenes of soeSalism, cannot but see the danger of the inciting Rnd provocative , eatiyaty urged by the document \"2,000 Words.\" . eeim Healthy forces in the party and the country regard this document as an neeneittack,..,e, against the socialist system, against the loading role of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, against Czeohoelovakia's friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist..:, eountrics.

The appeal has not found support and a social:basis in Slovakia. .1.: It was described as an attack and incitement against the republic since it demanded that new organs of power be set up and illegal levers of government be used. It calls for the taking over of power by such means and such people, whose interests and aims remain unknown. The publication of \"2000 Words\" has provoked many comments in the country. The majority of party organizations of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, communists who spoke at district conferences held recently, have condemned this counterrevolutionary platform. The response to it by the Government of the Czechoslovak Socialist 'Republic and of the National Front was negative. At the National Assembly session Deputy Kodaj justly said that the \"2000 Words\" was a call for counterrevolution. Sharp criticism is being leveled at the statement by public organizations, collectives, enterprises, and offices. At the time when party conferences and workers collectives, proceeding from the interests of strengthening socialism in the country and fraternal friendship of Approved For Release 2005/08/17 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000400030035-8 2 C FArRG H the Czechoslovak people with the peoples of the Soviet Union and other socialist countrietpprevetrFbreReleaEtea2M5g18/nla : sGtAREW7MAIMAPSALIMPAS1444akia , some organs of the press and information in Czechoslovakia have assumed a special position. The newspapers PRACE, ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY, MLADA FRONTA, and Prague radio and television are striving to influence public opinion to support the \"2000 Words\" statement. At the same time they attempt to create the impression that they are speaking on behalf of the people. 'Judging by what the Czechoslovak press says, certain reactionary-minded journalists and writers are coming out in support of this position. They are the very same people who on a number of occasions have urged putting an end to the leading role or the Czechoslovak COmmUnist Party.
