I went looking for a Dutch driver and found Adrian Paulen. I made a very basic profile for him but I thought this might be a good profile for our project to try to connect and improve.\n\nTwo other deceased race car drivers are Dries van der Lof and Jan Flinterman. They were both born in 1919 so I don't know if any records are open for them"
