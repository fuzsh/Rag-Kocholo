Well, using League Simulator, F1 except the drivers drive for their country instead of their team (can you tell I like this concept?) Don’t worry about this dying immediately either, I’ve already done up to 1973-4 (or about there) and plan to continue until present day.\n\nList of Champions (updated as I complete, not as I post here)\n\n1950: Louis Chiron (Monaco)\n\n1951: Louis Chiron, 3 (Monaco, 2)\n\n1952: Rudi Fischer (Switzerland)\n\n1953: Louis Chiron, 3 (Monaco, 3)\n\n1954: Maurice Trintignant (France)\n\n1955: Juan Manuel Fangio (Argentina)\n\n1956: Stirling Moss (England)\n\n1957: Toulo de Graffenried (Switzerland, 2)\n\n1958: Wolfgang von Trips (West Germany)\n\n1959: Wolfgang von Trips, 2 (West Germany,2)\n\n1960: Bruce McLaren (New Zealand)\n\n1961: Bruce McLaren, 2 (New Zealand, 2)\n\n1962: Graham Hill (England, 2)\n\n1963: Graham Hill, 2 (England, 3)\n\n1964: Graham Hill, 3 (England, 4)\n\n1965: Jim Clark (Scotland)\n\n1966: Graham Hill, 4 (England, 5)\n\n1967: Jim Clark, 2 (Scotland, 2)\n\n1968: Jackie Stewart (Scotland, 3)\n\n1969: Jo Siffert (Switzerland, 3)\n\n1970: Jochen Rindt (Austria)\n\n1971: Emerson Fittipaldi (Brazil)\n\n1972: Emerson Fittipaldi, 2 (Brazil, 2)\n\n1973: Jackie Stewart, 2 (Scotland, 4)\n\n1974: Ronnie Peterson (Sweden)\n\n1975: Emerson Fittipaldi, 3 (Brazil) 3)\n\nDrivers with multiple championships\n\nGraham Hill (4)\n\nLouis Chiron, Emerson Fittipaldi (3)\n\nJackie Stewart, Jim Clark, Bruce McLaren, Wolfgang von Trips (2)\n\nNations with multiple championships\n\nEngland (5)\n\nScotland (4)\n\nBrazil, Switzerland, Monaco (3)\n\nNew Zealand, West Germany (2)\n\nNations with multiple champions\n\nSwitzerland (Rudi Fischer, Toulo de Graffenried, Jo Siffert) (3)\n\nEngland (Stirling Moss, Graham Hill), Scotland (Jim Clark, Jackie Stewart) (2)\n\n1950 will be posted soon enough.\n\nPost by joshdoingthings on\n\n1950\n\n(I planned to put an image of a car from 1950 here but i couldn’t be bothered to figure which button that was. Pretend thats here)\n\nResults:\n\nLouis Chiron(Monaco)- 76pts, 1 win, 3 podiums\n\nHarry Schnell(USA)- 71pts, 1 win, 3 podiums\n\nPrince B.Bira(Thailand)- 66pts, 1 win, 3 podiums\n\nPeter Whitehead(England)- 56pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nGiuseppe Farina(Italy)- 51pts, 2 wins, 2 podiums\n\nDries van der Lof(Netherlands)- 49ers, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio(Argentina)- 48pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nToulo de Graffenried(Switzerland)- 45pts, 0 wins, 2 podiums\n\nJoe Kelly(Ireland)- 36pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nJohnny Claes(Belgium)- 23pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nTony Gaze(Australia)- 22pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nLouis Rosier(France)- 20pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPaul Pietsch(West Germany)- 16pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPorfirio Rubirosa(Dominican Republic)- 13pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nHere we see the first big issue of this: the reliability being atrocious. Sure, it was meant to be fairly bad, however I didn’t expect it to come into play as much as it did. Fangio gets absolutely shafted in this sim, I’ll say that much. You know you’re in some bizarro world when the top 3 at the end of the season are Louis Chiron, Harry Schnell and B.Bira (an actual prince!). I can’t say much as I didn’t keep track of the races, nor do I know much of anything about these drivers.\n\n1951\n\nDriver Changes\n\nFarina -> Ascari (Italy)\n\nRubirosa (Dominican Rep.) -> Paco Godia (Spain)\n\nResults\n\nLouis Chiron(Monaco)- 83pts, 2 wins, 3 podiums\n\nToulo de Graffenried(Switzerland)- 77pts, 1 win, 2 podium\n\nAlberto Ascari(Italy)- 63pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nLouis Rosier(France)- 55pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio(Argentina)- 53pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nHarry Schnell(USA)- 39pts, 0 wins, 2 podiums\n\nPeter Whitehead(England)- 39pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nTony Gaze(Australia)- 39pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nJoe Kelly(Ireland)- 29pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nPaul Pietsch(West Germany)- 28pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPaco Godia(Spain)- 26pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nJohnny Claes(Belgium)- 21pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nDries van der Lof(Netherlands)- 18pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPrince B.Bira(Thailand)- 10pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPrince Bira goes from third to last . Chiron wins again, probably in similar fashion to 1950. We also see Swiss drivers doing unnaturally well for the first time.\n\n1952\n\nDriver Changes\n\nGraffenried -> Rudi Fischer (Switzerland)\n\nFangio -> Jose Froilan Gonzalez (Argentina)\n\nWhitehead -> Mike Hawthorn (England)\n\n+ Eitel Cantoni (Uruguay)\n\n+ Chico Landi (Brazil)\n\nResults\n\nRudi Fischer(Switzerland)- 76pts, 2 wins, 3 podiums\n\nJose Froilan Gonzalez(Argentina)- 67pts, 1 win, 1 podium\n\nJohnny Claes(Belgium)- 62pts, 1 win, 3 podiums\n\nAlberto Ascari(Italy)- 61pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nLouis Chiron(Monaco)- 47pts, 0 wins, 3 podiums\n\nLouis Rosier(France)- 43pts, 1 win, 2 podiums\n\nTony Gaze(Australia)- 34pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nPrince B. Bira(Thailand)- 34pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nMike Hawthorn(England)- 32pts 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nDries van der Lof(Netherlands)- 30pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nJoe Kelly(Ireland)- 30pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nPaco Godia(Spain)- 25pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nPaul Pietsch(West Germany)- 24pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nEitel Cantoni(Uruguay)- 15pts, 0 wins, 1 podium\n\nChico Landi(Brazil)- 12pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nHarry Schnell(USA)- 3pts, 0 wins, 0 podiums\n\nThe top 2 drivers were rookies, all of Eitel Cantoni’s points came at one race where he finished third, and R.I.P Harry Schnell’s pace. Don’t worry, these summaries will be more insightful eventually."
