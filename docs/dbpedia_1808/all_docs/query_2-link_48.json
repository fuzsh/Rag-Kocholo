        "text": "The first Chilean made his debut in 1981: Eliseo Salazar competed in the San Marino GP in a March but was stopped on the 39th lap by a problem with the oil pressure. In the next championship, Colombia appeared for the first time with Roberto Guerrero at the GP USA West for Ensign: coming off the track after the first third of the race when he was in 11th position took him out of the race.\n\nFrom 1980 to 1999, a total of 161 drivers competed in Formula 1. However, other flags did not need to be brought out of mothballs because the countries remained the same as in the past. Brembo's presence intensified during these twenty years and it managed to win over the British garages which until then had been inclined to use home-produced braking components. ​"
