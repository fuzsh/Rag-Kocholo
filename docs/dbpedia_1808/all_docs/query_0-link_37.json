        "text": "This article examines the emphasis which, in certain contexts in the formation of actors and the practice of acting in the city of La Plata, Argentina, is placed on the centrality of the body in theatre.The purpose of this article is to examine how the centrality of body in theatre is highlighted in certain contexts of learning and practice of acting in the city of La Plata. In order to do this, the body is placed in a network of relationships through which corporality is confronted and, at the same time, articulated with other terms representing that other territory of the human realm in face of which the value of corporality is highlighted: those relationshipsestablished between body and text or body and word; those established between body and mind or body and thinking; and those that put the body in relation to a number of references we have gathered under the concept of subjectivity.\n\nOur speech will present the theoretical approach to the problems of body and technology in stage performance. The starting point will be status of the categories such as presence, ephemerality, immediacy of the (theatre) performance radically undermined in the texts of performance studies scholars such as Rebecca Schneider, Amelia Jones or Philip Auslander. Utilizing examples of performances from young Polish theatre: Krzysztof Garbaczewski (b.1983) and Radosław Rychcik (b.1981), we would like to juxtapose two of functioning models of body-technology relation on stage. The first one – represented by Garbaczewski – is based on understanding of the body as always mediated. It multiplies (undermines) body’s presence by use of audiovisual means. The second one – Rychcik’s case – is to push the theatrical presence of the body to absolute maximum. In this case audiovisual layer is used to build a strong opposition to the actor’s stage presence. The two examples will be used to propose new theoretical approach. We would like to show that such stage phenomena are not only the sign of the (technological) reality changing but also a very important, theoretical input in the understanding of the theatre as such. We will state that every single body on stage (no matter if consciously like in Garbaczewski’s case, or unconsciously like in the Rychcik’s case) is already mediated and the use of technological tools is a way to play with this specific character of theatre corporeality. This broader perspective will also incorporate elements of the political dimension of annexing media-mediated and media-manipulated corporeality, for it will follow the apparently transparent and natural dimension of such actions, whereby once again it will turn, as postulated by Jacques Rancière, aesthetic considerations into political considerations, which would be the speech final point.\n\nWe present the theoretical approach to the problems of body and technology in stage performance.

After its start we baptized our research subject Unpacking Performativity, for one of its goals was to unravel the way performativity works. I say work because the term is explicitly connected to action, to working in reality. Moreover, it is connected in a special way to the public. If we compare the concept of performativity with beauty or the sublime or with other common aesthetical concepts, performativity is a rather young invention. The first time that this neologism was used, was in the 1955 lectures by the well­ known philosopher of language, John Austin. He wanted to stress the effectiveness of language in reality; that is to say, to point at the effect some uses of language can have in reality. \" I pronounce you man and wife \" is not only a dictum but it is followed by or is spoken when two people are in fact coupled publicly. The words do what they say. The effectiveness on a specific behaviour of a public event and its denomination as performative were an answer to an upcoming interest in the renewal of the relationship between the audience and the work of art and the artist. In this paper I should like to inquire how this relationship was developed in different art disciplines and how they coped with this new performative attitude. I will focus on the theories of performing arts and the fine arts together for although they seem to talk about the same phenomenon they also seem to hardly talk to each other. In relation to these, probably, different discourses I should like to concentrate on their respective use of the body. This very agent seems to be important with regard to the performative. Performativity has intruded many more fields of art and knowledge than we imagine, for even gardens are analysed in performative terms. 1 This is no coincidence because it seems that we are getting increasingly interested in several aspects of the body and its relationships. But how is the body connected to performativity and how is it related to the public or the audience? When we follow the discourse in the field of the performing arts we come across a line of"
