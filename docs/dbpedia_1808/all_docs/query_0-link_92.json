        "text": "Hi Everyone!\n\nI need some advice/opinions about base layers.\n\nI am walking the Portuguese Coastal and Spiritual from mid September from Porto; arrive Santiago second week of October; unless Covid 19 and/or our government's \" you can go,you can't go\" traffic light system mucks it up!\n\nI have changed my original gear plan based on how i function and what is easiest for me. (got caught out by my Altus;took me to long to sort out because of it's size and me trying to orientate myself and it wasn't windy lost my temper got wet!)\n\nCan get the new stuff on PDQ, so i am going with it!\n\nI will now walk using my\n\nHagalof L.I.M jacket\n\nShorts (well two pairs zip offs but only one set of the zip off bottoms to add sun protection)\n\nRain Kilt(plus hands free umbrella for rain/sun)\n\nSo here is my question;in my gear i have a set of merino base layers long sleeve top and some bottoms.\n\nI think the top is a good idea,but not sure if i would need the \"bottoms\" for this time of year?\n\nOr will it be very cold by the time i am in Galicia in the beginning of October?\n\nI know you guys have been there and done it\n\nAll the best\n\nWoody\n\nOctober is so unpredictable.\n\nThe year I went, October had been unseasonably warm and dry and then November was quite cold and extremely wet (but these months are usually reversed for precipitation and November is not usually so chilly).\n\nI would definitely take the base layer. The coastal route can be very chilly and blustery in the mornings in particular. And it won't be light until nearer to 7:30 am so you may be finding it cooler right to about 10:30-11:00.\n\nI wore my merino running tights under my zip-off pants almost every day. At noon I would unzip the bottoms and keep the tights on under the shorts.\n\nOnly once did I take off the tights, put the full pants back on and continue on.\n\n@woody66, in late October and early November 2019 I walked from Barcelona to Pamplona in what was likely cooler weather than what you will encounter. Most days I was fine with either a short sleeve or long sleeve merino t_shirt. Sometimes both in the morning with me guessing as to which one would go on top for removal later in the day.\n\nThe last week was rather cool and wet (it was snowing on the Alto del Perdón). When raining I would remove the leggings of my convertable pants and walk in shorts. I did not think that this made me feel colder. In a wilderness area this could be disastrous but with a town always close by not so much.\n\nI should also add that I hardy ever wear shorts and even wear jeans in heat waves. Still, I felt fine with shorts in the rain as long as I was walking.\n\nIt is unpredictable, but if you covered all the options you would take the contents of your house with you.\n\nI wouldn’t take the merino baselayer tights, but neither would I take the kilt. I’d take breathable over trousers which provide for insulation, in extremis, over your full-length trousers.\n\nIMHO you’ll be in shorts throughout. Skin dries quicker than cloth and it’s not exactly an extreme environment.\n\nHands-free umbrella? Do like Yankee. Get wet, shake, walk, repeat. Sun is unlikely to be an issue.\n\nPersonally - and I’m a late spring and late Autumn walker - I have a dedicated pair of evening semi- smart trousers, a pair of thin gotetex over trousers and a pair of synthetic shorts. It’s enough. If I had to, I’d wear the lot at once.\n\nZipped-off trousers always look and feel like they’ve been zipped-off and don’t result in acceptable shorts, in my opinion.\n\nIm with you on the zip off shorts.\n\nI have walked twice September into October, and whilst we had the occasional cooler day, it wasn't really cold. Having said that I walked with my light puffa, a light fleece and a Tshirt and shorts, and slowly shed layers every day until I was just in the T-shirt by 10.30 each morning. I've never needed anything but shorts. But then I am a shorts person. A lot faster to dry than long pants, and I like my legs free.\n\nBoth times we had one really wet day - and I wore a poncho, and basically got wet. But like you say- you dry off again, and the warm shower that day was really welcome.\n\n@woody66, in late October and early November 2019 I walked from Barcelona to Pamplona in what was likely cooler weather than what you will encounter.

Still, I felt fine with shorts in the rain as long as I was walking.\n\nShorts. I wore them every day on the Camino I walked in April-May as well as the one in Sept-Oct. I wore lots of combinations up top according to changing temps and was always comfortable. I need tights to wear at night and always had them handy but didn’t ever need them.\n\nCan I comment on your Altrus poncho.\n\nI have had the same one for 5 caminos and the first two had a frustrating time until\n\nI figured it out and now it is so easy and although I swear in it i stay dry.\n\nIf it isn’t windy flip it over your back and place it like a cape snd then solely put one hand snd then the other. It is on!\n\nIt is actually even easier if it is windy. Face o to the wind hold it over your head and it will flap like a flag. Put one hand through the sleeve and the. The other. Reach back to one of the bottom ends of the poncho bring it forward then the other snd zip it up. You and your pack will be completely covered and protected. Believe me walking late in the year I have had some rain that has lasted days and some of those days had to put my poncho on 3 or 4 times a day.\n\nHi Everyone!\n\nI need some advice/opinions about base layers.\n\nI am walking the Portuguese Coastal and Spiritual from mid September from Porto; arrive Santiago second week of October; unless Covid 19 and/or our government's \" you can go,you can't go\" traffic light system mucks it up!\n\nI have changed my original gear plan based on how i function and what is easiest for me.

Long pants are more than enough.\n\nAt that time of year, I only take short sleeve lightweight merino, silk singlet and a very light fleece. Is the Hagalof a rain jacket? I prefer to just take a light poncho, as I hate being trapped in a rain jacket. I wonder about the umbrella. It is often windy on the coast...wouldn't it be a nuisance?"
