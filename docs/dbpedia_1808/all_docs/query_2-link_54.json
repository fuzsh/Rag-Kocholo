The car highlights the complete Dutch history at the top of motorsport. Portraits of Dries van der Lof, Jan Flinterman, Carel Godin de Beaufort, Ben Pon, Gijs van Lennep, Roelof Wunderink, Boy Hayje, Michael Bleekemolen, Jan Lammers, Huub Rothengatter, Jos Verstappen, Robert Doornbos and Christijan Albers have been painted on the car.\n\nOn the sidepots the faces of Jan Lammers and Gijs van Lennep stare at you. Jos Verstappen's portrait is most prominent on the car. (Photo: Frits van Eldik)\n\nPitbox Race Events hires simulators and F1 showcars out for commercial presentations and this car will be part of their fleet. Jos Verstappen's face is also on the nose of the car as he is the most successful Dutch F1 driver.\n\nJos puts his signature on the car (Photo: Pitbox Race Events)\n\nJohan Pluijster has worked 400 hours on this project. The artist offered Jos a paintbrush artwork he did; it a portrait of Jos when he was driving with Steward Ford back in 1998.\n\nArtist Johan Pluijster (left) and Jos with the paintbrush artwork (Photo: Pitbox Race Events)\n\nThorsten Hendriks"
