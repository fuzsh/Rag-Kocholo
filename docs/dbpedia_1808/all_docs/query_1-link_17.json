There was a lot to take in, a good number of very special cars together.\n\nPiet has done very well for himself over the years and built himself an impeccable reputation, together with some other specialists from that corner.\n\nI moved to South Africa 12 years ago, and have lost touch with most of the people from back then.\n\nHere's a pic I took in Zolder, Belgium. I remember being disgusted.\n\nAlso have pics of it in Apeldoorn last year (not realizing it was the same) and I am sure I will be able to dig up some pics of it while owned by Nico Koel (also not realizing it was the same).\n\nIs this the one he used in the Tour de Espa√±a, some years ago with a very loud sidepipe? In that case I have a small film of it as well, accelerating uphill at the start of one of the special stages near Busot.\n\nCopyright Benjamin van Bavel\n\nImage Unavailable, Please Login\n\nThis one was also shown in the MECC in Maastricht, no?\n\nI remember that Autotron-exhibit also very lively. Being 12 at the time, I mostly had eyes for the Testarossa and the 288 GTO. I regret that now, seeing the 275, the LM, the Daytona etc. etc."
