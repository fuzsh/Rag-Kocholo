The Supreme Court have proceeded on business with a degree of dignity which does honour to humane nature, Six are already convicted of High Treason, and a number of others of high crimes &c and there is not a dog that dare to move his Tongue - Perhaps your honor may remember that on my return from the Ohio I declaired in favour of [Majesty] for which your Honor gave me a gentle check altho I have the the highest opinion in your Honors judgement still I cannot give up the idea that Monarchy in our present situation is become absolutely necessary to save the States from sinking into the lowest abbiss of misery. I have delivered my sentiment in all companies at this [term], without reserve and was and am exceedingly pleased to find such a respectable [inserted: number] of my sentiments. I am clearly of opinion if matters were properly [inserted: arranged] it would be easily and soon effected, The old society of C_i must once more consult and offer the Salvation of a distracted Country. While I remain in the Country I shall be a strong advocate for what I have suggested, and should not leave the country through cowardice or any other cause than if I tarry much longer here old age and poverty will prevent me from planting my children in the finest country in the World - I wish you to take some pains that I might be so far discharged with respect to the two hundred dollars I drew on Mr Hutchions for in favour [struck: that] of Majr Platt that I might not be arrested on my way to the Promised Land, I wish Mrs Knox to accept my most respectful compliments I am with every sentiment of the Highest esteem your honor most Obedient humble servt Benj Tupper Honourable Maj Genl Knox"
