        "text": "Specimen handling and tissue fixation are essential steps to guarantee sample’s quality and reliable diagnosis. Milestone units achieve these objectives by employing vacuum transfer systems and eliminating formalin exposure, along with the added benefit of monitoring specimen conditions during transportation from the surgery suite to the laboratory.\n\nOur mission is to reduce patient anxiety by providing pathologists with technologies for same-day diagnostic results. Today, Milestone is proud to offer innovative solutions in different fields with the aim to help patients and create a better laboratory environment for the medical staff of both the Anatomical Pathology and Histology laboratories.\n\nFNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) biopsies are invasive procedures that require patient sedation during the insertion of endoscopes or large needles into the body cavity or the abdominal region. The solution provided by Milestone enables to rapidly collect and deliver images of the highest quality directly on-site, thereby reducing waiting times and enhancing patient management.\n\nThe ability to capture images and record visual/audio notes allows for a more comprehensive and time-saving documentation of autopsies, necropsies and forensic cases. Milestone’s unit follows this philosophy, creating a library of images automatically associated with the case ID number and providing clinicians with easy access to valuable additions for the autopsy report.\n\nThe frequent issue of irreproducibility in biomarker research and analysis often stems from variations in the collection, processing and storage methods. Milestone offers an innovative solution by standardizing the flash-freezing process for biospecimens. This approach includes the implementation of evidence-based freezing protocols and the provision of comprehensive documentation to maintain high quality assurance standards.\n\nMilestone solutions can be used as valuable teaching tools to educate students on various topics, including specimens processing, grossing, frozen sections and digital documentation. Pathologists can organize live demonstrations or access an extensive database of real cases, always maintaining the highest levels of safety and avoiding any unnecessary risks for students."
