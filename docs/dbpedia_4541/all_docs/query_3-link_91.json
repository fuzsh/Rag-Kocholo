        "text": "Susan B. Anthony Collection - Annotated Bibliography With Inscriptions.\n\nTranscribed and Edited by Rosemary Fry Plakas\n\nAmerican History Specialist, Rare Book and Special Collections Division\n\nIn 1903 woman suffrage pioneer Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) donated her personal library to the Library of Congress. During the winter holidays of 1902-03 Anthony prepared her books that lined shelves in the study of her Madison Street home in Rochester, New York, for shipment to Washington. In many of the volumes Anthony added thoughtful reflections about the author or the donor or what the book meant to her or to the movement. These personal annotations offer a rare opportunity for Anthony to share her remembrances of her contemporaries and the value she placed on the literature she collected.\n\nIn addition to the official reports of national suffrage conventions, addresses made at Congressional hearing, suffrage campaign literature, and files of reform periodicals, Anthony's library contains thirty-three extensive scrapbooks filled with newspaper clippings, programs, and other memorabilia that Anthony created between 1855 and 1900, which document the persistent progress of the suffrage movement and the gradual change in public attitudes. A number of volumes formerly owned by or presented to Anthony by family, friends, and admirers offer further insights into her personal relationships and contemporary reading habits. For an outstanding overview of Anthony's library that highlights some of Anthony's most interesting annotations, see Leonard N. Beck's “Library of Susan B. Anthony” in the Quarterly Journal of the Library of Congress, vol. 32, no. 4, October 1975, p. 324-335.\n\nThis bibliography is arranged by author and title in shelflist order, followed by transcribed inscriptions.
