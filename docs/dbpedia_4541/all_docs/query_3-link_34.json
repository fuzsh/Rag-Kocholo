Ecological Applications. 4:768-797.\n\nThe effects of human recreational activities on a rocky intertidal habitat on the coast of San Diego, California, USA were investigated. Organisms susceptible to collection for food, bait, or aquaria were identified and served as key species for the study of biota disturbance. This study examined three major aspects: (1) Distribution and activities of people along the shoreline were documented. (2) Distribution and density of echinoderms and molluscs inhabiting the cryptic underrock surface were sampled along an identified gradient of disturbance. (3) Densities of conspicuous organisms inhabiting the underrock surface at the most disturbed location detected in the spring of 1971 were compared with those detected in the spring of 1991.\n\nSurveys of human activity made during weekends with low tides exposing most of the intertidal zone (below 0 MLLW) during the daylight hours between December 1990 and August 1991 showed a definite pattern. People concentrated in an area with a 200 m radius centered on the primary accesses; areas farther from these points were less visited. The study site stood along a gradient of human disturbance, and the sampling of organisms along this indicated a gradient of biota disturbance as well. The density of all species was reduced in the more heavily visited intertidal area. The underrock community at the most heavily visited location changed substantially from spring 1971 to spring 1991. The density of most of the macroorganisms decreased between the two dates, with the exception of the density of small gastropods, which increased.\n\nEven if more long-term studies are needed for determining the actual status of communities under the influence of human disturbance, the combination of spatial and longterm studies shows the importance of setting better policy and establishing more effective reserves in order to enhance and maintain species diversity and density.\n\nCommunity structure; human disturbance; reserves; rocky intertidal\n\nAgardy, T. (2000). Information needs for marine protected areas: scientific and societal. Bulletin of Marine Science 66(3): 875-888.\n\nMarine protected areas are increasingly being used to protect biologically rich habitats, resolve user conflicts, and help restore overexploited stocks and degraded areas. The upsurge in the use of the tool has arisen in part because fisheries managers are now looking to reserves to complement conventional fisheries management techniques. In the United States, the legislative requirement to identify and protect essential fish habitat for managed fisheries species has contributed to the debate over and use of marine protected areas in all their various forms. Information needed to design and implement effective marine protected areas is usually drawn from the fields of fish population dynamics, oceanography, community ecology, and organismal biology, but because the placement, design, and management of marine protected areas are all related to the intended goals, the most crucial information is that about the specific objectives the protected area is designed to achieve. This information is ultimately societal, not scientific. After the specific objectives are elaborated, conservation biology and other sciences can be harnessed to help identify what needs to be protected and in what manner, leading to optimally effective marine protected areas.\n\nmpa, legislative requirement, fisheries management\n\nAgardy, T., P.

Unresolved issues and ideological clashes around marine protected areas. Aquatic Conserv: Mar. Freshw. Ecosyst.\n\nWhile conservationists, resource managers, scientists and coastal planners have recognized the broad applicability of marine protected areas (MPAs), they are often implemented without a firm understanding of the conservation science } both ecological and socio-economic } underlying marine protection. The rush to implement MPAs has set the stage for paradoxical differences of opinions in the marine conservation community.\n\nThe enthusiastic prescription of simplistic solutions to marine conservation problems risks polarization of interests and ultimately threatens bona fide progress in marine conservation. The blanket assignment and advocacy of empirically unsubstantiated rules of thumb in marine protection creates potentially dangerous targets for conservation science.\n\nClarity of definition, systematic testing of assumptions, and adaptive application of diverse MPA management approaches are needed so that the appropriate mix of various management tools can be utilized, depending upon specific goals and conditions. Scientists have a professional and ethical duty to map out those paths that are most likely to lead to improved resource management and understanding of the natural world, including the human element, whether or not they are convenient, politically correct or publicly magnetic.\n\nThe use of MPAs as a vehicle for promoting long-term conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity is in need of focus, and both philosophical and applied tune ups. A new paradigm arising out of integrated, multi-disciplinary science, management and education/outreach efforts must be adopted to help promote flexible, diverse and effective MPA management strategies. Given scientific uncertainties, MPAs should be designed so one can learn from their application and adjust their management strategies as needed, in the true spirit of adaptive management.\n\nIt is critical for the conservation community to examine why honest differences of opinion regarding MPAs have emerged, and recognize that inflexible attitudes and positions are potentially dangerous. We therefore discuss several questions } heretofore taken as implicit assumptions: (a) what are MPAs, (b) what purpose do MPAs serve, (c) are no-take MPAs the only legitimate MPAs, (d) should a single closed area target be set for all MPAs, and (e) how should policymakers and conservation communities deal with scientific uncertainty?\n\nAirame, S., J.E.

Ecological Applications 13(1) Supplement: S170-S184.\n\nUsing ecological criteria as a theoretical framework, we describe the steps involved in designing a network of marine reserves for conservation and fisheries management. Although we describe the case study of the Channel Islands, the approach to marine reserve design may be effective in other regions where traditional management alone does not sustain marine resources. A group of agencies, organizations, and individuals established clear goals for marine reserves in the Channel Islands, including conservation of ecosystem biodiversity, sustainable fisheries, economic viability, natural and cultural heritage, and education. Given the constraints of risk management, experimental design, monitoring, and enforcement, scientists recommended at least one, but no more than four, reserves in each biogeographic region. In general, the percentage of an area to be included in a reserve network depends on the goals. In the Channel Islands, after consideration of both conservation goals and the risk from human threats and natural catastrophes, scientists recommended reserving an area of 30-50% of all representative habitats in each biogeographic region. For most species of concern, except pinnipeds and seabirds, information about distributions, dispersal, and population growth was limited. As an alternative to species distribution information, suitable habitats for species of concern were used to locate potential reserve sites. We used a simulated annealing algorithm to identify potential reserve network scenarios that would represent all habitats within the smallest area possible. The analysis produced an array of potential reserve network scenarios that all met the established goals.\n\nAllison, G.W., S.D. Gaines, J. Lubencho, and H.P. Possingham. 2003. Ensuring Persistence of Marine Reserves: Catastrophes Require Adopting an Insurance Factor. Ecological Applications 13(1) Supplement: S8-S24.\n\nWhen viewed across long temporal and large spatial scales, severe disturbances in marine ecosystems are not uncommon. Events such as hurricanes, oil spills, disease outbreaks, hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms, and coral bleaching can cause massive mortality and dramatic habitat effects on local or even regional scales. Although designers of marine reserves might assume low risk from such events over the short term, catastrophes are quite probable over the long term and must be considered for successful implementation of reserves. A simple way to increase performance of a reserve network is to incorporate into the reserve design a mechanism for calculating how much additional area would be required to buffer the reserve against effects of catastrophes. In this paper, we develop a method to determine this ''insurance factor'': a multiplier to calculate the additional reserve area necessary to ensure that functional goals of reserves will be met within a given ''catastrophe regime.'' We document and analyze the characteristics of two relatively well-studied types of disturbances: oil spills and hurricanes.We examine historical data to characterize catastrophe regimes within which reserves must function and use these regimes to illustrate the application of the insurance factor. This tool can be applied to any reserve design for which goals are defined by a quantifiable measure, such as a fraction of shoreline, that is necessary to accomplish a particular function. In the absence of such quantitative measures, the concept of additional area as insurance against catastrophes may still be useful.\n\nAllison, G. W., J. Lubchenco and M. H. Carr. 1998. Marine Reserves are Necessary but not Sufficient for Marine Conservation. Ecological Applications. 8:S79-S92.\n\nThe intensity of human pressure on marine systems has led to a push for stronger marine conservation efforts. Recently, marine reserves have become one highly advocated form of marine conservation, and the number of newly designated reserves has increased dramatically. Reserves will be essential for conservation efforts because they can provide unique protection for critical areas, they can provide a spatial escape for intensely exploited species, and they can potentially act as buffers against some management miscalculations and unforeseen or unusual conditions. Reserve design and effectiveness can be dramatically improved by better use of existing scientific understanding. Reserves are insufficient protection alone, however, because they are not isolated from all critical impacts. Communities residing within marine reserves are strongly influenced by the highly variable conditions of the water masses that continuously flow through them. To a much greater degree than in terrestrial systems, the scales of fundamental processes, such as population replenishment, are often much larger than reserves can encompass. Further, they offer no protection from some important threats, such as contamination by chemicals. Therefore, without adequate protection of species and ecosystems outside reserves, effectiveness of reserves will be severely compromised. We outline conditions under which reserves are likely to be effective, provide some guidelines for increasing their conservation potential, and suggest some research priorities to fill critical information gaps. We strongly support vastly increasing the number and size of marine reserves; at the same time, strong conservation efforts outside reserves must complement this effort. To date, most reserve design and site selection have involved little scientific justification. They must begin to do so to increase the likelihood of attaining conservation objectives.\n\nBiodiversity; harvest refugia; marine parks; marine protected areas; open populations; population replenishment; Reserve design\n\nAnderson, C. N. K., C.-h. Hsieh, S. A. Sandin, R. Hewitt, A. Hollowed, J. Beddington, R. M. May, G. Sugihara. (2008). Why fishing magnifies fluctuations in fish abundance. Nature 452: 835-839.\n\nIt is now clear that fished populations can fluctuate more than unharvested stocks. However, it is not clear why. Here we distinguish among three major competing mechanisms for this phenomenon, by using the 50-year California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) larval fish record. First, variable fishing pressure directly increases variability in exploited populations. Second, commercial fishing can decrease the average body size and age of a stock, causing the truncated population to track environmental fluctuations directly. Third, age-truncated or juvenescent populations have increasingly unstable population dynamics because of changing demographic parameters such as intrinsic growth rates. We find no evidence for the first hypothesis, limited evidence for the second and strong evidence for the third. Therefore, in California Current fisheries, increased temporal variability in the population does not arise from variable exploitation, nor does it reflect direct environmental tracking. More fundamentally, it arises from increased instability in dynamics. This finding has implications for resource management as an empirical example of how selective harvesting can alter the basic dynamics of exploited populations, and lead to unstable booms and busts that can precede systematic declines in stock levels.\n\nfished populations, flucutations, systematic decline\n\nAngulo-Valdes, J. A. and B. G. Hatcher. (2009). A new typology of benefits derived from marine protected areas. Marine Policy.\n\nGlobal decline of marine resources has triggered a worldwide demand for changing the way ocean resources are managed. Ecosystem based management approaches have emerged using marine protected areas (MPA) as the main tool. Several classifications of marine protected areas benefits have been made, but all have focused only on the benefits to humans, neglecting many important benefits accrued to nature. This paper presents a new comprehensive classification of MPA benefits that will provide scientists and managers with an inclusive framework to accurately identify and account for all possible benefits derived from MPAs. The paper also analyses the methods available for valuing these benefits. A total of 99 benefits were identified within nine main categories: fishery, on-fishery, management, education/research, cultural, process, ecosystem, population and species benefits. These categories are arranged in two main divisions (direct and indirect benefits),which, at the same time, fall within the realms of benefits to humans and to nature.\n\nMPA benefit, eco-system, framework\n\nApostolaki, P., E.J.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 59: 405-415\n\nWe present a model of the effects of a marine reserve on spawning stock biomass (SSB) and short- and long-term yield for a size-structured species that exhibits seasonal movements. The model considers the effects of protecting nursery and (or) spawning grounds under a range of fishing mortalities and fish mobility rates. We consider two extremes of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and analyze the effects of a reserve when the fishery targets either mature or immature fish. We apply the model to the Mediterranean hake (Merluccius merluccius) and show that a marine reserve could be highly beneficial for this species. We demonstrate benefits from reserves not just for overexploited stocks of low-mobility species, but also (to a lesser extent) for underexploited stocks and high mobility species. Greatly increased resilience to overfishing is also found in the majority of cases. We show that a reserve provides benefits additional to those obtained from simple effort control. Benefits from reserves depend to a major extent on the amount of effort redistribution following reserve establishment and on fishing selectivity; hence, these factors should be key components of any evaluation of reserve effectiveness.\n\nArmstrong, C. W. and A. Skonhoft. 2006. Marine reserves: A bio-economic model with asymmetric density dependent migration. Ecological Economics. 57:466-476.\n\nA static bioeconomic model of a marine reserve allowing asymmetric density ependent migration between the reserve and the fishable area is introduced. This opens for habitat or ecosystem differences allowing different fish densities within and outside a reserve, not described in earlier studies. Four management scenarios are studied; (a) maximum harvest, (b) maximum current profit, (c) open access and (d) maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in the reserve. These are all analysed within the Induced Sustainable Yield Function (ISYF), giving the relationship between the fish abundance inside the reserve and the harvesting taking place outside. A numerical analysis shows that management focused on ensuring MSY within the reserve under the assumption of symmetric migration may be negative from an economic point of view, when the area outside the reserve is detrimental compared to the reserve. Furthermore, choice of management option may also have negative consequences for long run resource use if it is incorrectly assumed that density dependent migration is symmetric. The analysis also shows that the optimal area to close, either a more or a less attractive ecosystem for the resource in question, may differ depending on the management goal.\n\nBioeconomics; Marine reserves; Migration; Management\n\nBabcock, R.

(2010).Decadal trends in marine reserves reveal differential rates of change in direct and indirect effects. PNAS Early Edition: 1-6.\n\nDecadal-scale observations of marine reserves suggest that indirect effects on taxa that occur through cascading trophic interactions take longer to develop than direct effects on target species. Combining and analyzing a unique set of long-term time series of ecologic data in and out of fisheries closures from disparate regions, we found that the time to initial detection of direct effects on target species (±SE) was 5.13 ± 1.9 years, whereas initial detection of indirect effects on other taxa, which were often trait mediated, took significantly longer (13.1 ± 2.0 years). Most target species showed initial direct effects, but their trajectories over time were highly variable. Many target species continued to increase, some leveled off, and others decreased. Decreases were due to natural fluctuations, fishing impacts from outside reserves, or indirect effects from target species at higher trophic levels. The average duration of stable periods for direct effects was 6.2 ± 1.2 years, even in studies of more than 15 years. For indirect effects, stable periods averaged 9.1 ± 1.6 years, although this was not significantly different from direct effects. Populations of directly targeted species were more stable in reserves than in fished areas, suggesting increased ecologic resilience. This is an important benefit of marine reserves with respect to their function as a tool for conservation and restoration.\n\nfishing effects, interactions, time lag, trophic cascade, marine protected area\n\nBabcock, R.

ICES Journal of Marine Science. 62:469-476.\n\nAlthough much work has been done developing system-level indicators for ecosystembased fishery management (EBFM), few of those proposed include a spatial component. Even in single-species management, time and area closures have been applied without a clear understanding of what their effect might be on identifying overfishing thresholds and other reference points. For EBFM, spatial zoning of the marine environment, including no take marine reserves and areas where destructive fishing gears are prohibited, may become a prime management tool. Therefore, indicators of the effectiveness of spatial management will be required, along with an understanding of how indicators related to other objectives will be influenced. We review single-species models that have been used to model spatial zoning, including potential bias in assessment and current work on effort reallocation after area closure, as well as available ecosystem-based models and metrics and how they might account for spatial management. Metrics that can be derived from explicitly spatial approaches such as GIS-based ecosystem and fishery evaluations are also discussed.\n\nCPUE; ecosystems; fishery management; GIS; spatial modelling\n\nBabcock, R.

Marine Ecology Progress Series. 189:125-134.\n\nNo-take' marine reserves provide a valuable tool for managing marine resources as well as for providing relatively undisturbed habitat with which to assess modifications to ecosystems. We studied 2 marine reserves in northeastern New Zealand, the Leigh Marine Reserve (established 1975) and Tawharanui Marine Park (established 1982) in order to assess whether changes in protected predator populations had resulted in other indirect changes to grazers and consequently to algal abundance. Estimates of abundance of the most common demersal predatory fish Pagrus auratus indicated that adults of this species (i.e. large enough to prey upon urchins) were at least 5.75 and 8.70 times more abundant inside reserves than in adjacent unprotected areas. Overall, P auratus were also much larger inside reserves with mean total lengths of 316 mm compared with 186 mm in fished areas. The spiny lobster Jasus edwardsii displayed similar trends, and was approximately 1.6 to 3.7 times more abundant inside the reserves than outside. Lobsters within the reserves had a mean carapace length of 109.9 mm, compared with 93.5 mm outside the reserves. In one of the reserves, densities of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus had declined from 4.9 to 1.4 m-2 since 1978 in areas formerly dominated by it. Consequently, kelp forests were more extensive in 1998 than they were at the time of reserve creation. Urchin-dominated barrens occupied only 14 % of available reef substratum in reserves as opposed to 40\"4 in unprotected areas. These changes in community structure, which have persisted since at least 1994, demonstrate not only higher trophic complexity than anticipated in Australasian ecosystems but also increased primary and secondary productivity in marine reserves as a consequence of protection. Trends inside reserves indicate large-scale reduction of benthic primary production as an indirect result of fishing activity in unprotected areas.\n\nMarine reserves; Habitat change; Trophic structure - Fishing effects; Urchins; Kelp; Fish; Spiny lobsters\n\nBan, N.

Biodiversity and Conservation. 18:1829-1845.\n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) can be an effective tool for marine biodiversity conservation, yet decision-makers usually have limited and biased datasets with which to make decisions about where to locate MPAs. Using commonly available abiotic and biotic datasets, I asked how many datasets are necessary to achieve robust patterns of conservation importance. I applied a decision support tool for marine protected area design in two regions of British Columbia, Canada, and sequentially excluded the datasets with the most limited geographic distribution. I found that the reserve selection method was robust to some missing datasets. The removal of up to 15 of the most geographically limited datasets did not significantly change the geographic patterns of the importance of areas for conservation. Indeed, including abiotic datasets plus at least 12 biotic datasets resulted in a patial pattern similar to including all available biotic datasets. It was best to combine abiotic and biotic datasets in order to ensure habitats and species were represented. Patterns of clustering differed according to whether I used one set alone or both combined. Biotic datasets served as better surrogates for abiotic datasets than vice versa, and both represented more biodiversity features than randomly selected reserves. These results should provide encouragement to decision-makers engaged in MPA planning with limited spatial data.\n\nBiodiversity surrogates; Data limitations; Marine conservation; Marine reserves; Marxan; Selection algorithm; Systematic conservation planning\n\nBanks, S.

They also have an important role in the governance of oceans and the sustainable management of marine resources. The translation of marine reserve network theory into practice is a challenge for conservation practitioners. Barriers to implementing marine reserves include varying levels of political will and agency support and leadership, poorly coordinated marine conservation policy, inconsistencies with the use of legislation, polarised views and opposition from some stakeholders, and difficulties with defining and mapping conservation features. The future success of marine reserve network implementation will become increasingly dependent on: increasing political commitment and agency leadership; greater involvement and collaboration with stakeholders; and the provision of resources to define and map conservation features. Key elements of translating marine reserve theory into implementation of a network of marine reserves are discussed based on approaches used successfully in New Zealand and New South Wales (Australia).\n\nMarine conservation planning; Marine reserves; Reserve networks; Conservation policy\n\nBarrett, N.

Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 345:141-157.\n\nMost studies examining effects of marine protected areas (MPAs) on fish assemblages are potentially confounded, either because they are once off comparisons between fished and unfished locations, or because they are snapshot studies over a fixed period. Here we compare long-term changes within fully protected Tasmanian marine reserves with changes at external reference sites on an annual basis over the first ten years of protection. The results highlight the importance of long-term datasets for differentiating changes occurring over differing time scales. Notable results include a statistically significant increase in abundance of Latridopsis forsteri and large fish (N300 mm) when examined across all reserves relative to controls, and a 10-fold increase in the abundance of large fish and a doubling of per site species richness of large fish within the Tinderbox Marine Reserve relative to controls. Short-term resident species that recruit sporadically show very different patterns in reserves compared to those that recruit regularly and have long-term age-class storage. While several recent reviews have suggested size of MPAs and duration of protection has little influence on the extent of recovery, our results suggest this is not the case and that responses can be slow, complex and species-specific. The extent of localised fishing pressure appeared to have a substantial influence on the degree of change detected, potentially confounding meta-analyses of recovery rates in MPAs if overlooked as a relevant parameter.\n\nEffects of fishing; Long-term analysis; Marine reserve; Reserve size\n\nBarrett, N.

Fishing substantially influenced the population characteristics of many species, including altering the mean size and abundance of rock lobsters and the abundance of prey species such as urchins and abalone. Strong declines in abundances of purple urchins and abalone within the largest MPA at Maria Island indicate likely indirect effects related to protection of predators from fishing. The two smallest MPAs (ca. 1 km coastal span) generated few detectable changes. Our results affirm the importance of long-term monitoring and the value of MPAs, when sufficiently large, as reference areas for determining and understanding ecosystem effects of fishing in the absence of historical baseline data.\n\nAbalone; Effects of fishing; Marine protected area; Reserve size; Rock lobster; Sea urchins\n\nBaskett, M.

Biological Conservation. 137:163-179.\n\nThe primary goals of marine reserves include protecting biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Therefore, a multispecies approach to designing and monitoring reserve networks is necessary. To gain insight into how the interactions between species in marine communities may affect reserve design, we synthesize marine reserve community models and community models with habitat destruction and fragmentation, and we develop new extensions of existing models. This synthesis highlights the potential for species interactions to alter reserve design criteria; in particular, accounting for species interactions often leads to an increase in reserve size necessary to protect populations. Accounting for species interactions also indicates the need to base reserve design and monitoring on a variety of species, especially long-distance dispersers, inferior colonizers, and specialists. Finally, the new model extensions highlight how, given dispersal, source populations outside reserves as well as increases in fished populations after reserve establishment may negatively affect reserve populations of competitors or prey. Therefore, multispecies harvest dynamics outside reserves and before reserve establishment are critical to determining the appropriate reserve size, spacing, and expectations after establishment. These models highlight the importance of species interactions to reserve design and provide guidelines for how this complexity can begin to be incorporated into conservation planning.\n\nMarine protected areas; Habitat loss; Predation; Competition; Mutualism; Community models\n\nBecker, B.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 104:3267-3272.\n\nBased on the belief that marine larvae, which can spend days to months in the planktonic stage, could be transported considerable distances by ocean currents, it has long been assumed that populations of coastal species with a planktonic larval stage are demographically open and highly ‘‘connected.’’ Such assumptions about the connectivity of coastal populations govern approaches to managing marine resources and shape our fundamental understanding of population dynamics and evolution, yet are rarely tested directly due to the small size and high mortality of marine larvae in a physically complex environment. Here, we document a successful application of elemental fingerprinting as a tracking tool to determine sources of settled invertebrates and show that coastal mussel larvae, previously thought to be highly dispersed, can be retained within 20–30 km of their natal origin. We compare two closely related and co-occurring species, Mytilus californianus and Mytilus galloprovincialis, and determine that, despite expected similarities, they exhibit substantially different connectivity patterns. Our use of an in situ larval culturing technique overcomes the previous challenge of applying microchemical tracking methods to species with completely planktonic development. The exchange of larvae and resulting connectivities among marine populations have fundamental consequences for the evolution and ecology of species and for the management of coastal resources.\n\nElemental fingerprinting; in situ larval culturing; larval retention; larval transport; Mytilus\n\nBeldade, R., R.

Journal of Plankton Research 28(11): 1003-1013.\n\nIn this study, we compare the composition, abundance and structure of a temperate fish larval assemblage at different depth intervals (0–4, 4–8 and 8–12 m) in the extreme nearshore environment. We used a plankton net attached to an underwater scooter to sample in close proximity to the rocky substrate (<50 cm). A total of 868 larvae from 27 taxa in 13 families were caught. The majority of larvae belonged to benthic reef-associated species (Blenniidae, Gobiidae, Gobiesocidae and Tripterygiidae), the four most abundant comprising 76% of the total larvae caught. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) showed that there was a single multispecific larval patch near the substrate in the extreme nearshore up to 12 m depth. Nonetheless, distinct larval abundances were found in this relatively small depth range, with the majority of species being more abundant at the deepest interval, particularly Pomatoschistus pictus and Gobius xanthocephalus. Tripterygion delaisi was an exception being more abundant at the shallowest depth as young larvae. The density of pre-flexion larvae was not significantly different across depth intervals, but post-flexion larval density increased with depth. The full size range (from hatching to settlement) of P. pictus was present at the extreme nearshore. The innovative sampling technique used here revealed high densities of larvae close to the bottom, and depth was found to be an important factor influencing the distribution of several taxa and ontogenetic stages. The nearshore component of coastal fish larval assemblages near rocky substrates has been poorly studied, and our results suggest that the high densities of larvae found to aggregate in these environments must be taken into account when studying distribution and functional aspects of these assemblages.\n\nTemperate, fish larval assemblage, reef-associated species\n\nBell, J. 1983.

The known biology of several species indicated that feeding requirements may be responsible for depth preferences.\n\nSamples from reserve sites had signficantly higher densities of fish species sought after and/or vulnerable to local fishing methods, than those from non-reserve sites of similar depth.\n\nSize frequency distributions of vulnerable species at reserve sites generally had a larger modal size class than distributions from non-reserve sites.\n\nThe data suggest that reduced fishing pressure in the reserve has provided effective protection for species vulnerable to fishing.\n\nBellefleur, D., P. Lee, R. A. Ronconi. (2007).The impact of recreational boat traffic on Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus). Journal of Environmental Manangement: 1-8.\n\nThis study evaluated the impact of small boat traffic on reaction distances of Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus), in the marine waters of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, British Columbia, Canada. Observers on moving boats recorded the minimum distance the boat came to murrelets on the water, and any disturbance reaction (fly, dive, no reaction). Out of the 7500 interactions 11.7% flew, 30.8% dove and 58.1% exhibited no flushing reaction. Using a product-limit analysis, we developed curves for the proportion of Marbled Murrelets flushing (dive or flight) as a function of reaction distance. Overall, the majority of Marbled Murrelets waited until boats were within 40 m before reacting, with 25% of the population reacting at 29.2 m. A stepwise Cox regression indicated that age, boat speed, and boat density (loaded in that order), significantly affected flushing response. More juveniles flushed than adults (70.1 versus 51.7%), but at closer distances. Faster boats caused a greater proportion of birds to flush, and at further distances (25% of birds flushed at 40 m at speeds >29 kph versus 28 m at speeds <12 kph). A stepwise logistic regression on diving and flight responses indicated that birds tended to fly completely out of feeding areas at the approach of boats travelling >28.8 kph and later in the season (July and August). Other secondary variables included; boat density and time of day. Discussion focused on possible management actions such as the application of speed limits, set back distances, and exclusion of boat traffic to protect Marbled Murrelets.\n\nSpecies at Risk Act; SARA; Boat disturbance; Bird disturbance; Seabirds; Protected areas; Environmental management; Seabird ecology; Wildlife habituation; Human use impacts; Pacific Rim National Park Reserve; Set back distances; Buffer zone\n\nBellquist, L.

Fisheries Research. 91:325-335.\n\nThe fishery for California groundfishes is managed using broad species complexes, although some non-groundfish species are managed similarly due to the perception of shared behavioral characteristics. This study integrates acoustic telemetry and a GIS to quantify movement patterns of one such species, the ocean whitefish (Caulolatilus princeps) in a marine protected area. Seventeen ocean whitefish were tagged and actively tracked over multiple 24-h periods to measure fine-scale movement patterns. Home ranges based on 95% kernel utilization distributions averaged 20,439±28,492 (±S.D.)m2. Fish were active during the day, foraging over sand habitat at depths averaging 21±8m, but were inactive at night, taking refuge near rocky reefs at depths averaging 15±7m. Seventeen additional fish were tagged with coded acoustic transmitters and passively tracked using automated underwater acoustic receivers for up to 1 year. Approximately 75% of these fish exhibited long-term (1 year) fidelity to home ranges in the study area. Results suggest that MPAs can be an effective means of protecting populations of ocean whitefish and based on their habitat associations, ocean whitefish can be managed separately from other reef associated groundfishes.\n\nMovement patterns; Home range; Site fidelity; Habitat selection; Marine protected area; Acoustic telemetry; Ocean whitefish\n\nBenedetti-Cecchi, L., F.

Predicting the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance: large-scale effects of loss of canopy algae on rocky shores. Marine Ecology Progress Series. 214:137-150.\n\nAnthropogenic disturbances affect natural populations and assemblages by interacting with fundamental ecological processes. Field experiments simulating the effects of human activities at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales are useful to understand these interactions and eventually to predict their ecological consequences. In the Mediterranean, low-shore habitats of rocky coasts are often dominated by canopy algae Cystoseira spp., but these species are frequently replaced by assemblages of turf-forming algae and mussel beds. We propose that anthropogenic disturbance is the proximate cause of loss of Cystoseira in the Mediterranean, and that the disappearance of canopy algae causes an increase in cover of turf-forming species in disturbed habitats. Two hypotheses were investigated to test this proposition: (1) canopy algae will be dominant in relatively pristine habitats while turf-forming algae will be more abundant in urban areas, and (2) removal of canopy algae in unpolluted areas will result in the development of assemblages similar to those found in urban areas. We tested the first hypothesis by comparing patterns in abundance of Cystoseira and turf-forming algae at a number of locations in urban areas and in areas far from distinct sources of anthropogenic disturbance in the northwest Mediterranean. The second hypothesis was tested by conducting a largescale manipulative experiment, involving the experimental removal of Cystoseira and several spatial and temporal repetitions of the manipulation. Turf-forming algae were always dominant in urban areas where Cystoseira was nearly absent. In contrast, canopy algae often dominated rocky shores in relatively pristine areas of the northwest Mediterranean. The removal of Cystoseira generally caused an increase in the percentage cover of turf-forming algae and a decrease in the abundance of invertebrates. These changes were already evident 4 mo after manipulation and were consistent at the spatial and temporal scales examined in the study. Assemblages in cleared patches were qualitatively similar to those occurring where Cystoseira was naturally absent, but quantitative differences in the relative abundance of several taxa were still evident by the end of the study. These results support a cause effect relationship between anthropogenic disturbance and loss of Cystoseira in the northwest Mediterranean and allow for quantitative predictions of the indirect consequences of disturbing canopy algae for the whole understory assemblage. Management options aimed at conserving these plants should simultaneously preserve other components of the assemblage.\n\nAnthropogenic disturbance; Canopy algae; Cystoseira; Habitat formers; Indirect effects; Large-scale experiments; Prediction; Rocky shores; Turf-forming algae\n\nBennett, B.

Marine Ecology Progress Series. 75:173-181.\n\nThis study was designed to establish whether populations of fish species important in the catches of rock and surf anglers increased following the proclamation of the De Hoop Marine Reserve on the southern coast of South Africa Catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size frequency distributions of angling species were monitored approximately monthly by angling from the shore at 2 sites in the reserve. At one site sampling commenced 2 yr before the reserve was established and continued 4.5 yr thereafter, allowing comparisons of periods of exploitation and protection. The other site had a long history of minimal exploitation and data collected there 2.5 to 4.5 yr after complete protection was considered to represent an unexplolted condition. Ten species accounted for 99% of the catch. Following establishment of the reserve. CPUE increased for 6 of these (galjoen Coracinus capensis, dassie Diplodus sargus, wildeperd D. cervinus, white steenbras Lithognathus lithognathus, Cape stumpnose Rhabdosargus holubi and musselcracker Sparodon durbanensis) The catch rates of 2 species (C. capensis and D. sargus) improved 4 to 5 fold within 2 yr of protection and remained at these high levels, which were similar to the unexploited catch rates. Recoveries were slower amongst the other 4 species, their catch rates reaching 30 to 60% of the unexploited level after 2.5 to 4.5 yr of protection This study provides evidence of general stock recoveries of exploited fish species in a shallow marine habitat following protection within a marine reserve.\n\nBerkeley, S. A., C. Chapman and S.M. Sogard. 2004. Maternal Age as a Determinant of Larval Growth and Survival in a Marine Fish, Sebastes Melanops. Ecology. 85(5): 1258-1264.\n\nRelative body size has long been recognized as a factor influencing reproductive success in fishes, but maternal age has only recently been considered. We monitored growth and starvation resistance in larvae from 20 female black rockfish (Sebastes melanops), ranging in age from five to 17 years. Larvae from the oldest females in our experiments had growth rates more than three times as fast and survived starvation more than twice as long as larvae from the youngest females. Female age was a far better predictor of larval performance than female size. The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival. These results suggest that progeny from older females can survive under a broader range of environmental conditions compared to progeny from younger females. Age truncation commonly induced by fisheries may, therefore, have severe consequences for long-term sustainability of fish populations.\n\nBerkeley, S. A., M. A. Hixon, R. J. Larson and M. S. Love. 2004. Fisheries Sustainability via Protection of Age Structure and Spatial Distribution of Fish Populations. Fisheries 29(8): 23-32.\n\nNumerous groundfish stocks in both the Atlantic and Pacific are considered overfished, resulting in large-scale fishery closures. Fishing, in addition to simply removing biomass, also truncates the age and size structure of fish populations and often results in localized depletions. We summarize recent research suggesting that an old-growth age structure, combined with a broad spatial distribution of spawning and recruitment, is at least as important as spawning biomass in maintaining long-term sustainable population levels. In particular, there is evidence that older, larger female rockfishes produce larvae that withstand starvation longer and grow faster than the offspring of younger fish, that stocks may actually consist of several reproductively isolated units, and that recruitment may come from only a small and different fraction of the spawning population each year. None of these phenomena is accounted for in current management programs. We examine alternative management measures that address these specific issues and conclude that the best and perhaps only way to ensure old-growth age structure and complex spatial structure in populations of groundfish is through interconnected networks of marine reserves.\n\nBlamey, L. K. and G. Branch. 2009. Habitat diversity relative to wave action on rocky shores: implications for the selection of marine protected areas. Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems. 19:645-657.\n\nCurrent selection of marine protected areas in South Africa is based on objective criteria including biogeographic representation and habitat heterogeneity. This paper specifically examines rocky shores on the west coast of South Africa to determine whether they are divisible into discrete 'habitats' that need independent conservation.\n\nSeventeen rocky shores spanning the full spectrum of wave exposure were compared in terms of maximum wave forces, biomass, species richness and diversity among zones and sites. Three biotic assemblages were identified, characterizing sheltered, semi-exposed to exposed, and very exposed habitats. Differences among these were clear-cut low on the shore but disappeared at the top of the shore where wave action was attenuated and desiccation uniformly intense.\n\nThe recognition of three discrete biologically-defined habitats means that rocky shores cannot be regarded as a uniform habitat for conservation purposes. All three components need protection if the full spectrum of rockyshore communities is to be conserved.\n\nIt is argued that this approach allows habitats to be defined in an objective manner, and that once this has been done, habitat heterogeneity constitutes a better measure of conservation value of an area than a 'hotspot' approach based on species richness and endemism.\n\nintertidal biomass; limpets; mussels; marine protected areas; rocky shores; wave action\n\nBlanchette, C. A., B. R. Broitman and S. D. Gaines. 2006. Intertidal community structure and oceanographic patterns around Santa Cruz Island, CA, USA. Marine Biology. 149:689-701.\n\nRecent studies suggest that nearshore oceanographic conditions can have important effects on the structure of benthic communities. On Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA, USA there is a persistent difference in mean annual sea surface temperature (SST) around the island due to its location at the confluence of opposing cold and warm ocean current systems. Over the course of a 4-year study (1997–2001) seawater nutrient and chl-a concentrations, algal tissue C:N ratios, recruitment and growth of filter-feeders (barnacles and mussels), and intertidal community structure were measured at six intertidal sites around the island. There were strong associations between remotely sensed SST and patterns of community structure. Macrophyte abundance was highest at sites with persistently low SST, while recruitment, abundance, and growth of filter-feeding invertebrates were strongly, positively correlated with SST. The cold-water sites were associated with higher nutrient concentrations and lower algal C:N ratios, particularly in the winter months. Values of chl-a were generally low and variable among sites, and were not correlated with the predominant SST gradient. Recruitment of barnacles and mussels was positively correlated with adult abundance across all sites. While detailed experimental studies are needed to further evaluate the mechanisms underlying community dynamics, these results indicate that the confluence of cold- and warm-water masses around SCI may determine the contrasting patterns of intertidal community structure.\n\nBlyth-Skyrme, R.

Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 64:1284-1289.\n\nMarine protected areas are advocated as an essential management tool to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources by providing insurance against over-exploitation and through the provision of refuge for a large biomass of sexually mature adults. Using a unique fishing gear-restriction, voluntary management system as a large-scale experiment, we found that adult scallops (Pecten maximus) within areas protected from towed bottom-fishing gear had heavier adductor muscle tissue and gonads that were 19%-24% heavier than those of scallops in fished areas, while other body and age characteristics were similar in both areas. The scallops within the protected area also occurred at a much higher abundance than adjacent, chronically fished (× 12.83) and wider commercially exploited (× 2.18) areas. These results provide evidence that the use of towed bottom-fishing gear can further exacerbate the effects of overfishing through the suppression of the reproductive potential of individuals of similar body size. These findings underline the utility of using closed areas as tools for fisheries conservation of sedentary species of commercial importance.\n\nBlyth-Skyrme, R. E., M. J. Kaiser, J. G. Hiddink, G. Edwards-Jones and P. J. B. Hart. 2006. Conservation benefits of temperate marine protected areas: variation among fish species. Conservation Biology. 20:811-820.\n\nMarine protected areas, and other fishery management systems that impart partial or total protection from fishing, are increasingly advocated as an essential management tool to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources. Beneficial effects for fish species are well documented for tropical and reef systems, but the effects of marine protected areas remain largely untested in temperate waters. We compared trends in sport-fishing catches of nine fish species in an area influenced by a large (500-km2) towed-fishing-gear restriction zone and in adjacent areas under conventional fishery management controls. Over the period 1973-2002 the mean reported weight of above-average-sized (trophy) fish of species with early age at maturity and limited home range was greatest within the area influenced by the fishing-gear restriction zone. The reported weight of trophy fish of species that mature early also declined less and more slowly over time within the area influenced by the fishing-gear restriction zone. Importantly, the mean reported weight of trophy fish of species that mature late and those that undertake extensive spatial movements declined at the same rate in all areas. Hence these species are likely to require protected areas >500 km2 for effective protection. Our results also indicated that fish species with a localized distribution or high site fidelity may require additional protection from sport fishing to prevent declines in the number or size of fish within the local population.\n\nBobko, S.J. and S.A. Berkeley. 2004. Maturity, ovarian cycle, fecundity, and age-specific parturition of black rockfish (Sebastes melanops). Fisheries Bulletin 102:418-429.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, we collected female black rockfish (Sebastes melanops) off Oregon in order to describe their basic reproductive life history and determine age-specific fecundity and temporal patterns in parturition. Female black rockfish had a 50% probability of being mature at 394 mm fork length and 7.5 years-of-age. The proportion of mature fish age 10 or older significantly decreased each year of this study, from 0.511 in 1996 to 0.145 in 1998. Parturition occurred between mid-January and mid-March, and peaked in February. We observed a trend of older females extruding larvae earlier in the spawning season and of younger fish primarily responsible for larval production during the later part of the season. There were differences in absolute fecundity at age between female black rockfish with prefertilization oocytes and female black rockfish with fertilized eggs; fertilized-egg fecundity estimates were considered superior. The likelihood of yolked oocytes reaching the developing embryo stage increased with maternal age. Absolute fecundity estimates (based on fertilized eggs) ranged from 299,302 embryos for a 6-year-old female to 948,152 embryos for a 16-year-old female. Relative fecundity (based on fertilized eggs) increased with age from 374 eggs/g for fish age 6 to 549 eggs/g for fish age 16.\n\nBohnsack, J. A.. 2000. A comparison of the short-term impacts of no-take marine reserves and minimum size limits. Bulletin of Marine Science 66(3): 635-650.\n\nEstablishing no-take marine reserves (NTRs) displaces fishing effort to surrounding areas, creating concerns about short-term impacts on resources and fishers before long-term benefits can accrue. Models were developed to compare the effects of short-term displacement caused by of NTRs to effects of minimum size limits (MSLs), one of the most widely applied management measures in the southeastern U.S. Projected impacts on resource protection and fishers were assessed on the basis of the portion of a population either protected or legally available to fishing. In all cases, existing MSLs had greater impact on total numbers of fish landed (reduced by 38 to 70%) than on the weight of total landings (reduced by 14 to 26%). NTRs protected sedentary species in approximate proportion to the total habitat closed to fishing but provided less protection as species mobility increased. These differences in protection due to mobility were greater for reserves covering small percentages of total habitat. Predicted short-term displacement impacts on fishers were low for reserves covering small percentages of the total habitat, but they increased exponentially as the percentage of total habitat closed increased. Displacement impacts were predicted to be highest for fishers pursuing sedentary species and decreased for more mobile species. Detrimental impacts to surrounding habitat from displacement depended on initial fishery conditions, gear type, and the total proportion of habitat closed. Although more fishers are affected by the no-take rule, concerns about short-term displacement impacts appear to be exaggerated. Some opposition to establishing NTRs may result in part because the no-take provision is more difficult to circumvent than other regulations. When combined with traditional management tools, no-take reserves offer increased flexibility for supporting fisheries and protecting resources.\n\nBonacci, S., A. Iacocca, S. Fossi, L. Lancini, T.

Ambio 36(4): 308-215.\n\nThe main aims of the present study, conducted in the framework of the MONIQUA–Egadi Scientific Project, were twofold: first, to make the first step in the development and validation of an ecotoxicological approach for the assessment of marine pollution in coastal environments on the basis of a set of biomarker responses in new sentinel species; and second, to obtain preliminary information on environmental quality in an Italian marine protected area, the Egadi Islands (Sicily). Several cytochrome P450–dependent mixed-function oxidase activities were measured in the following sentinel species: rainbow wrasse Coris julis, gastropod limpet Patella caerulea, and sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. The results suggest that specimens from the Favignana Harbor may be exposed to P450 inducers, whereas most of the other sites seem to share similar environmental quality. The proposed approach has potential for assessment of environmental quality in marine protected areas.\n\nParacentrotus lividus, cytochrome, biomonitoring, marine protected area\n\nBotsford, L. W. 2001. Physical influences on recruitment to California Current invertebrate populations on multiple scales. ICES Journal of Marine Science. 58:1081-1091.\n\nStudies of recruitment to Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) and red sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) populations have focused on recruitment variability on interannual, 1000-km scales. These studies have identified correlations between recruitment and variables indicating ENSO conditions and wind-forced larval transport. On longer scales, our understanding of biologically important physical variability in the California Current has recently been enhanced by an appreciation of semi-basin, decadal changes. Intensification of the Aleutian low-pressure zone in the mid-1970s had a clear positive effect of biological productivity in the Gulf of Alaska, and less obvious negative effects on productivity in the California Current. On shorter scales, an increasing appreciation of the effect of dispersal patterns on population dynamics and the potential of spatially explicit management schemes provide the impetus for studying processes such as alongshore spatial variability in recruitment and the underlying daily variability in circulation over 100-km distances. In the 1980s, physical studies of coastal circulation in response to daily fluctuations in upwelling winds identified brief periods of northward, onshore flow interrupting the offshore, southward flows associated with active upwelling. In the 1990s, concurrent monitoring of biological and physical conditions revealed that these flows transport late-stage invertebrate larvae from a retention zone in the lee of a local promontory to settlement locations, producing specific spatial patterns of recruitment. Variability in recruitment of both crabs and sea urchins is thus driven by daily temporal variability in upwelling winds and 100-km spatial variability in coastal topography. Interannual recruitment variability appears to depend on ENSO-related biological productivity and larval transport in ways that vary among species, but are not completely understood. Observations are consistent with coastwide, interannual variability being driven by biological productivity (i.e. ENSO/non-ENSO conditions), while the upwelling relaxation mechanism sets the spatial scale, and decadal, semi-basin variability modulates the frequency of ENSO conditions.\n\nDungeness crab; ENSO; marine reserves; red sea urchin; regime shift; scales; settlement; upwelling relaxation\n\nBotsford, L.W., F. Micheli, and A. Hastings. 2003. Principles for the Design of Marine Reserves. Ecological Applications 13(1) Supplement: S25-S31\n\nThe theory underlying the design of marine reserves, whether the goal is to preserve biodiversity or to manage fisheries, is still in its infancy. For both of these goals, there is a need for general principles on which to base marine reserve design, and because of the paucity of empirical experience, these principles must be based on models. However, most of the theoretical studies to date have been specific to a single situation, with few attempts to deduce general principles. Here we attempt to distill existing results into general principles useful to designers of marine reserves. To answer the question of how fishery management using reserves compares to conventional management, we provide two principles: (1) the effect of reserves on yield per recruit is similar to increasing the age of first capture, and (2) the effect of reserves on yield is similar to reducing effort. Another two principles answer the question of how to design reserve configurations so that species with movement in various stages will be sustainable: (3) higher juvenile and adult movement lowers sustainability of reserves for biodiversity, but an intermediate level of adult movement is required for reserves for fishery management, and (4) longer larval dispersal distance requires larger reserves for sustainability. These principles provide general guidelines for design, and attention to them will allow more rapid progress in future modeling studies. Whether populations or communities will persist under any specific reserve design is uncertain, and we suggest ways of dealing with that uncertainty.\n\nBotsford, L.W., D. R. Brumbaugh, C. Grimes, J.

Connectivity, sustainability, and yield: bridging the gap between conventional fisheries management and marine protected areas. Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries. 19:69-95.\n\nA substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these consequences primarily in terms of the goals and currencies of greatest interest in fisheries and conservation of marine resources: sustainability and yield. Sustainability is the ability of the population and the associated fishery to persist into the long-term future. Yield is a benefit in the management of a fishery, and a decline in yield is a potential cost when setting aside an MPA solely for conservation. We begin by reviewing the ways in which conventional fisheries management seeks sustainability and high yield, and the uncertainties involved. We then describe the dynamics of sustainability in spatially distributed populations with MPAs as we add the three types of connectivity. Finally, we present synthetic conclusions that encapsulate our current understanding of connectivity and MPAs, and identify future challenges in this arena.\n\nConnectivity; Marine reserve; Metapopulation; Fisheries management; Dispersal; Home range\n\nBoudouresque, C. F. and M. Verlaque. (2005). Nature conservation, Marine Protected Areas, sustainable development and the flow of invasive species to the Mediterranean Sea. France, Port-Cros National Park: 29-54.\n\nThe Mediterranean flora and fauna seem particularly rich. One of the reasons for this wealth is their high rate of endemism. In addition, the Mediterranean harbours a large variety of communities. Some of them are unique, giving the Mediterranean its touch of originality. A number of these species and communities are threatened by human activities. Until recently, the legal protection of marine species mainly concerned mammals, turtles and birds. Since 1996, 55 species of Mediterranean marine macrophytes, invertebrates and fishes were registered in Appendices I and II of the Conventions of Bern and Barcelona. Of course, the protection of species is intimately linked to the protection of their habitats and resources: a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were set up. In addition to the setting up of conservatories for threatened species and habitats, the targets of MPAs are to establish no-take areas where fish density and sex-ratio make spawning possible (which subsequently export eggs, larvae and adults to surrounding non protected areas) and to manage the different uses of the sea (e.g. artisanal fishing, recreational fishing and tourism) in a rational way, so that they do not conflict with each other or with conservation aims. Furthermore, protected areas are no longer seen as \"islands\" of nature surrounded by incompatible resource uses but are part of a broader regional approach to land and sea management.\n\nMediterranean, introduced species, flora and fauna, marine protected area\n\nBroitman, B.

Recruitment of intertidal invertebrates and oceanographic variability at Santa Cruz Island, California, U.S.A.. 1-24.\n\nTo examine geographical variation in oceanographic forcing on larval delivery, we studied spatial and temporal variability in larval recruitment of mussels and barnacles in a key oceanographic region around Santa Cruz Island, California, U.S.A. Larval recruitment patterns differed among sites located on the eastern and western shores of the island associated with differences in oceanographic regimes. Western sites had low, but variable sea surface temperatures, while eastern sites were warmer (1°C-1.5°C higher) and less variable. Larval arrival was extremely low at western sites relative to eastern sites. Mussels and barnacles differed in the duration and seasonality of larval recruitment. Mussels recruited over a long period between winter and summer, while barnacle recruitment occurred in pulses in spring-summer. Mussel recruitment was not correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies, while barnacle recruitment was significantly and positively correlated to temperature anomalies with time lags ranging from 0 to 3 months across all sites. Oceanographic and larval recruitment patterns suggest that western sites are dominated by an energetic flux of cold, recently upwelled water depleted of larvae, while eastern sites receive high numbers of larvae associated with the influx of warmer surface water likely originating outside the Santa Barbara Channel.\n\nSanta Cruz Island, California, mussels, larval arrival, recruitment\n\nBroitman, B.

Spatial and temporal patterns of invertebrate recruitment along the west coast of the United States. Ecological Monographs. 78:403-421.\n\nPatterns of recruitment in marine ecosystems can reflect the distribution of adults, dispersal by ocean currents, or patterns of mortality after settlement. In turn, patterns of recruitment can play an important role in determining patterns of adult abundance and community dynamics. Here we examine the biogeographic structure of recruitment variability along the U.S. West Coast and examine its association with temperature variability. From 1997 to 2004 we monitored monthly recruitment rates of dominant intertidal invertebrates, mussels and barnacles, at 26 rocky shore sites on the West Coast of the United States, from northern Oregon to southern California, a span of 1750 km of coastline. We examined spatial variation in the dynamics of recruitment rates and their relationship to coastal oceanography using satellite-derived time series of monthly sea surface temperature (SST). Recruitment rates showed a biogeographic structure with large regions under similar dynamics delimited by abrupt transitions. The seasonal peak in recruitment rates for both mussels and barnacles changed from a late summer/early fall peak in Oregon to winter or early spring in northern California, and then back toward summer in southern California. Recruitment rates varied greatly in magnitude across the latitudinal range. The barnacle Balanus glandula and mussels (Mytilus spp.) showed a decline of two orders of magnitude south of Oregon. In contrast, recruitment rates of barnacles of the genus Chthamalus showed a variable pattern across the region examined. The spatial distribution of associations between raw SST and recruitment rates for all species showed positive associations, indicating recruitment during warm months, for all species in Oregon, northern California, and several sites in south-central California. By considerably extending the spatial and temporal scales beyond that of previous studies on larval recruitment rates in this system, our study has identified major biogeographic breaks around Cape Blanco and Point Conception despite considerable spatial and temporal variation within each region and among species. These large differences in recruitment rates across biogeographic scales highlight the need for a better understanding of larval responses to ocean circulation patterns in the conservation and management of coastal ecosystems.\n\nadvanced very-high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite; Balanus glandula; Chthamalus spp.; community structure; geographic variation; intertidal invertebrates; Mytilus spp.; recruitment; West Coast, USA\n\nBrown, C.

Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 64: 33-46.\n\nLarval fish settlement in estuarine nursery areas is the end result of numerous biological and physical processes. We used a numerical circulation model coupled to a particle transport model to examine the role that physics play in determining settlement patterns of red drum larvae (Sciaenops ocellatus) in nursery habitat along the Texas coast. We examined supply at various spatial scales (supply to inlet, bays, and individual settlement sites). Temporal patterns in larval settlement in Aransas Bay, Texas, are correlated with several indices of modeled particle supply (number of particles inside the bays, integrated particle input to Lydia Ann Channel, and cumulative number of competent particles in Lydia Ann Channel). High abundances of recently settled red drum in Aransas Bay result from a combination of high larval input, limited habitat for settlement, and proximity of habitat to the inlet. In contrast, larval settlement in Corpus Christi and Redfish Bays does not appear to be related to modeled measures of larval supply. Modeled particle supply at the bay-scale suggests that difference in the abundance of recently settled red drum between the bays may be related to larval supply normalized by the amount available settlement habitat within the bay.\n\nSciaenops ocellatus; red drum; fish larvae; larval transport; estuary; Texas; nursery habitat; modeling\n\nBrown, P. J. and R. B. Taylor. 1999. Effects of trampling by humans on animals inhabiting coralline algal turf in the rocky intertidal. Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 235:45-53.\n\nThis paper investigates the effects of trampling by humans on the fauna associated with articulated coralline algal turf. Patches of intertidal turf in a low-use area of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve (in north-eastern New Zealand) were experimentally trampled over 5 days at three levels that fell within those measured in a part of the reserve subject to heavy 5 visitor use. Two days after trampling ended there were ~ 2 * 105 individual macrofauna (.500 2 mm) per m in control plots, but densities declined with increasing trampling intensity in the treatment plots, and were reduced to 50% of control values at the highest trampling intensity. Densities of five of the eight commonest taxa were negatively correlated with trampling intensity, with polychaetes being particularly susceptible to low levels of trampling. Three months after trampling ended densities of all taxa had returned to control values, with the exception of polychaetes. Reductions in animal densities are tentatively attributed to the loss of turf and associated sand caused by trampling, rather than direct destruction of the organisms. Given the likely importance of these abundant and productive animals in the rocky reef ecosystem, and their vulnerability to low levels of trampling by humans, we conclude that the effective management of marine protected areas may necessitate total exclusion of humans in some cases.\n\nAlgae; Coralline turf; Epifauna; Human impact; Intertidal; New Zealand; Marine reserve; Trampling\n\nByers, J. E. 2005. Marine reserves enhance abundance but not competitive impacts of a harvested nonindigenous species. Ecology. 86:487-500.\n\nMarine reserves are being increasingly used to protect exploited marine species. However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves.\n\nI followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth. By growing quickly and residing near the surface, Venerupis apparently absorbs the brunt of harvest pressure while Protothaca maintains high biomass even outside of reserves.\n\napparent competition; clams; exotic species; fisheries; marine protected areas; mixed effects models; Nuttallia obscurata; Protothaca staminea; San Juan Islands; Washington (USA); spatially replicated experiments; Tapes japonica; Venerupis philippinarum\n\nCarr, M.H., J.E.

Ecological Applications 13(1) Supplement: S90-S107.\n\nConcepts and theory for the design and application of terrestrial reserves is based on our understanding of environmental, ecological, and evolutionary processes responsible for biological diversity and sustainability of terrestrial ecosystems and how humans have influenced these processes. How well this terrestrial-based theory can be applied toward the design and application of reserves in the coastal marine environment depends, in part, on the degree of similarity between these systems. Several marked differences in ecological and evolutionary processes exist between marine and terrestrial ecosystems as ramifications of fundamental differences in their physical environments (i.e., the relative prevalence of air and water) and contemporary patterns of human impacts. Most notably, the great extent and rate of dispersal of nutrients, materials, holoplanktonic organisms, and reproductive propagules of benthic organisms expand scales of connectivity among nearshore communities and ecosystems. Consequently, the ''openness'' of marine populations, communities, and ecosystems probably has marked influences on their spatial, genetic, and trophic structures and dynamics in ways experienced by only some terrestrial species. Such differences appear to be particularly significant for the kinds of organisms most exploited and targeted for protection in coastal marine ecosystems (fishes and macroinvertebrates). These and other differences imply some unique design criteria and application of reserves in the marine environment. In explaining the implications of these differences for marine reserve design and application, we identify many of the environmental and ecological processes and design criteria necessary for consideration in the development of the analytical approaches developed elsewhere in this Special Issue.\n\nCarson, H. S. andB. T. Hentschel. 2006. Estimating the dispersal potential of polychaete species in the Southern California Bight: implications for designing marine reserves. Marine Ecology Progress Series. 316:105-113.\n\nUsing known and inferred life-history information, we estimated the dispersal potential of 501 polychaete species sampled during a 1998 monitoring study in the Southern California Bight. We tested the hypothesis that species having life-history traits that suggest long-distance dispersal will be encountered more frequently throughout the region than will species having life histories that suggest limited dispersal. When all 501 species and all 200 sampling sites were analyzed, occurrence frequency (percentage of sites at which a species was collected) was not significantly related to dispersal potential. When data from 53 shelf sites in the Channel Islands were analyzed separately from collections at 147 mainland-shelf sites, there was a significant positive relationship between dispersal potential and occurrence frequency at the island sites but not at the mainland sites. Of the 501 species, 119 were collected only at island sites, 98 were found only at mainland sites, and 284 were found at both island and mainland sites. The majority of the 'island only' species had life-history traits indicating low dispersal potential. In contrast, only 13% of the 'mainland only' species were categorized as having low dispersal potential. The 'cosmopolitan' species had a broad range of dispersal potential. Models indicate that efforts to conserve biodiversity by establishing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) must consider species' dispersal. In the shelf communities of the Southern California Bight, networks of small reserves that are located in existing areas of high diversity should succeed in the Channel Islands, where the majority of polychaete species tend to have limited dispersal potential. On the mainland shelf, however, designing effective MPAs will be more challenging due to the prevalence of species that have a greater potential for long-distance dispersal to or from unprotected sites.\n\nDispersal; Larval ecology; Life history; Marine Protected Area; Marine reserve; Polychaete\n\nCastilla, J.

Trends in Ecology and Evolution. 14:280-283.\n\nThe ecological roles of humans in marine communities have been poorly studied. Humans have special characteristics, such as culture, and are perceived as complex ecological actors. Observations and experiments conducted in coastal (rocky intertidal and nearshore) 'no-take' areas or reserves in Chile and around the world have permitted a better understanding of the role played by humans as top predators and the resulting trophic-cascade effects along the food-webs. These studies have revealed an urgent need to incorporate humans into ecological studies and have helped to promote links between ecology and social sciences.\n\nCasu, D., G. Ceccherelli , M. Curini-Galletti and A. Castelli. 2006. Human exclusion from rocky shores in a mediterranean marine protected area (MPA): An opportunity to investigate the effects of trampling. Environmental Research. 62:15-32.\n\nThe effect of human trampling on the abundance of small invertebrates inhabiting rocky shallow bottoms was studied at Asinara Island MPA. To this aim we have conducted two experiments. The first was a quantitative study and tested the hypothesis that small invertebrates are more abundant at no-entry locations than at the location visited by tourists through time (before, during and after tourist season). The second was a manipulative experiment and tested the hypothesis that the abundance of small invertebrates is indirectly related to experimental trampling intensities. The effect due to tourist visitation was not highlighted on overall assemblages, suggesting that present seasonal tourist load at the MPA does not cause a significantly negative effect on the zoobenthic community studied. Although tourists exhibited trampling activity at the visited location, none of taxa examined showed a significant lower abundance during and strictly after the end of seasonal tourism peak in the visited location, rather than at control locations. However, results obtained with the second experiment suggested that the effects of different experimental trampling intensities on small invertebrates were variable among taxa. The experimental trampling caused immediate declines in the density of tanaids, nematodes, acari, bivalves, gammarids, echinoderms, isopods, and harpacticoids. For some of these taxa a recovery in abundance was observed within one month.\n\nAsinara island; Benthic invertebrates; Marine protected area; Mediterranean sea; Rocky shore; Trampling\n\nChittaro, P. M., I. C. Kaplan, A. Keller, and P. S. Levin. (2009). Trade-Offs between Species Conservation and the Size of Marine Protected Areas. Conservation Biology.\n\nMoving from single-species- to ecosystem-based management requires an understanding of how community-level attributes such as diversity change with area. We used survey data from bottom trawls to examine spatial patterns of species richness in U.S. Pacific coastal fishes. Specifically, we generated and compared species–area relationships (SARs) for species classified into several groups on the basis of maximum body size, trophic level, diet, maximum depth, geographic affinity, and taxonomic order. Because SARs among groups were not parallel and z values varied significantly for several groups, groups of species were underor overrepresented (depending on the size of the area) relative to their proportions in the entire community (i.e., entire U.S. Pacific coast). In this way, differences in SARs help demonstrate trade-offs between species representation and coastal area and suggest strategies (such as targeting the protection of habitats and locations where a particular species or groups of species are maximized) that may minimize the size of marine protected areas (MPAs) but protect diversity at the level of the community and functional group.\n\nbiodiversity conservation; marine protected areas; species–area relationships\n\nChristie, M.

Molecular Ecology 19: 1042-1057.\n\nIdentifying patterns of larval dispersal within marine metapopulations is vital for effective fisheries management, appropriate marine reserve design, and conservation efforts. We employed genetic markers (microsatellites) to determine dispersal patterns in bicolour damselfish (Pomacentridae: Stegastes partitus). Tissue samples of 751 fish were collected in 2004 and 2005 from 11 sites encompassing the Exuma Sound, Bahamas. Bayesian parentage analysis identified two parent–offspring pairs, which is remarkable given the large population sizes and 28 day pelagic larval duration of bicolour damselfish. The two parent–offspring pairs directly documented self-recruitment at the two northern-most sites, one of which is a long-established marine reserve. Principal coordinates analyses of pair-wise relatedness values further indicated that self-recruitment was common in all sampled populations. Nevertheless, measures of genetic differentiation (FST) and results from assignment methods suggested high levels of gene flow among populations. Comparisons of heterozygosity and relatedness among samples of adults and recruits indicated spatially and temporally independent sweepstakes events, whereby only a subset of adults successfully contribute to subsequent generations. These results indicate that self-recruitment and sweepstakes reproduction are the predominant, ecologically-relevant processes that shape patterns of larval dispersal in this system.\n\nbicolour damselfish, larval dispersal, multivariate statistics, parentage, population connectivity, relatedness\n\nClaessen, D., A. S. de Vos and A. M. de Roos. 2009. Bioenergetics, overcompensation, and the source-sink status of marine reserves. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 66:1059-1071.\n\nOne of the hypothesized functions of marine protected areas (MPAs) is to serve as sources of biomass, with biomass spilling over from the reserve into neighbouring, harvested areas. We argue that the net larval flow (from or to the marine reserve) depends on between-area differences in the population-level biomass production rate, whereas the direction of adult flow depends on differences in the biomass standing stock. Hence, an important question is whether population-level biomass production increases (overcompensation) or decreases (undercompensation) with increased per capita mortality. We show that in a consumer-resource context, the source-sink status of an MPA may depend on the details of the individual-level bioenergetics, as well as on the dispersal rates of larvae and adults. We compare two classic bioenergetic models (net-production vs. gross-production allocation). The net-production model predicts that population-level reproduction may increase with mortality (overcompensation), whereas gross-production allocation always results in undercompensation. We show that models often implicitly assume gross-production allocation, thus potentially overestimating the capacity of MPAs to source unprotected areas. We briefly discuss results of two other models (a simplified, logistic model and a size-structured model), suggesting that the relation between overcompensation and the larval sink status of MPAs is general.\n\nClaudet, J., C.

Ecology Letters. 11:481-489.\n\nMarine reserves are widely used throughout the world to prevent overfishing and conserve biodiversity, but uncertainties remain about their optimal design. The effects of marine reserves are heterogeneous. Despite theoretical findings, empirical studies have previously found no effect of size on the effectiveness of marine reserves in protecting commercial fish stocks. Using 58 datasets from 19 European marine reserves, we show that reserve size and age do matter: Increasing the size of the no-take zone increases the density of commercial fishes within the reserve compared with outside; whereas the size of the buffer zone has the opposite effect. Moreover, positive effects of marine reserve on commercial fish species and species richness are linked to the time elapsed since the establishment of the protection scheme. The reserve size-dependency of the response to protection has strong implications for the spatial management of coastal areas because marine reserves are used for spatial zoning.\n\nAsymmetrical analysis of variance; coastal marine ecosystems; commercial species; fish assemblages; heterogeneity; marine protected area; marine reserve age; marine reserve design; marine reserve network; marine reserve size; weighted meta-analysis\n\nCole, R. G., T. M. Ayling and R. G. Creese. 1990. Effects of marine reserve protection at Goat Island, northern New Zealand. New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research. 24:197-210.\n\nThe possible effects that marine reserve protection has had on densities of some reef fish and large invertebrates were investigated near Leigh (north-eastern New Zealand) by a series of sampling programmes between 1976 and 1988. Fish counts at intervals during the 6 years after the initial establishment of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve in 1975 suggested that red moki (Cheilodactylus spectabilis) had increased in abundance whereas five others had remained at approximately constant densities. A comparison of data between 1978 and 1988 also revealed few consistent differences in fish abundances. A detailed survey in 1988 between sites inside and outside the marine reserve showed no clear patterns for sea urchins (Evechinus chloroticus) and several fish; trends for increased abundances in the marine reserve of fish such as snapper Pagrus (=Chrysophrys) auratus, blue cod (Parapercis colias), and red moki; a very striking increase in numbers of rock lobsters (Jasus edwardsii) within the marine reserve; and an obvious trend for increased size of snapper in the marine reserve. Most of the trends, however, were not statistically significant, owing largely to the low power of the tests used. Although it is now generally accepted that the creation of marine reserves such as the one at Leigh results in increased abundances of certain organisms, our study highlights the difficulty of rigorously demonstrating this, especially for patchily distributed and mobile fish species.\n\nMarine reserve; fish; abundance; rock lobster, sea urchin\n\nColeman, F.C. , W.F.

Recreational landings in 2002 account for 4% of total marine fish landed in the USA. With large industrial fisheries excluded (e.g., menhaden and pollock), the recreational component rises to 10%. Among populations of concern, recreational landings in 2002 account for 23% of the total nationwide, rising to 38% in the South Atlantic and 64% in the Gulf of Mexico. Moreover, it affects many of the most valued overfished species, including red drum, bocaccio, and red snapper, all of which are taken primarily in the recreational fishery.\n\nCollins, M.R., T.I.J. Smith, W.E. Jenkins, M.R. Denson. 2002. Small Marine Reserves May Increase Escapement of Red Drum. Fisheries 27(2): 20-24.\n\nAn experimental stock enhancement program was conducted in Port Royal Sound estuary, South Carolina, in which cultured juvenile red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus, 2-3 cm TL, ~40 days old) were released into a system of shallow tidal creeks that flow into the Colleton River. All fish were immersed in oxytetracycline (OTC) prior to release to produce an identifiable, chemical mark on the otoliths. The release area was typical of primary nursery habitat in this region. For four years post-stocking, fish were collected throughout the sound using hook and line, spear, and trammel net. Otoliths were examined for OTC marks to determine which fish were of hatchery origin. It was found that while dispersal was substantial, many stocked fish stayed in the general area of release (1.8 x 3.2 km) until reaching the age of maturity (~age 3) when they left the estuary, and at all ages they were mixed with wild fish. This suggests that relatively small areas containing the appropriate suite of habitat types could be designated as marine reserves (no-take zones) in order to increase escapement of red drum, thus enhancing recruitment to the spawning stock. Establishing a system of these very small reserves in a number of estuaries would minimize interference with anglers while assisting recovery of red drum stocks, and perhaps enhancing stocks of other estuarine species as well.\n\nCompas, E., B.

Marine Policy. 31:691-697.\n\nGiven the public’s limited knowledge of marine environments, informing the public about marine protection presents a unique challenge. Studies have shown a well-informed public is more likely to support environmental issues and that newspapers, in particular, are considered a credible media source. This research investigates media representations of current South Australian efforts to establish a marine protected area (MPA). Articles from five newspapers between 1999 and 2006 were examined for content in the following areas: local marine ecology, the policy process of MPA establishment and stakeholder views. The research found that newspapers concentrated their reporting on opposing stakeholders, opinions and were largely ineffective in conveying the significance of the local marine ecology, the economic benefits of the MPA, and the delayed establishment process. These information gaps have left the public poorly informed, and therefore, there is unlikely to be significant pressure to overcome the continued delays in the establishment process.\n\nMarine protected areas; Media; Content analysis; South Australia\n\nCooke, S.

Ocean and Coastal Management. 49:342-354.\n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have become a common conservation and management tool for reducing exploitation from the commercial and recreational fisheries sectors. However, the recreational fisheries sector has the potential to be compatible with no-take MPAs when catchand- release angling is practiced because, in theory, no fish are actually harvested. This presumes that the effects of catch-and-release angling and related activities do not cause appreciable declines in fish populations as a result of direct mortality, sub-lethal effects, or indirect effects on fish habitats, or other problems contrary to the goal of a given MPA. Here, we explore the idea that recreational catch-and-release angling may be compatible with some no-take MPAs provided there are no substantive negative ecological consequences. We argue that it is not currently possible to answer definitively the question of whether recreational catch-and-release fisheries can be compatible with no-take MPAs. Mortality rates of released fish vary extensively (between zero and near 100%) and are influenced by a number of factors including environmental conditions, fishing gear, angler behavior, and species-specific characteristics. Nevertheless, research in the field of catch-and-release is begin"
