About a bighearted, hardheaded girl named Liza, and Ty and Fish and Wick and Marshall and Ernie and Tom and Dr. B. himself who care more than America does about whether he lives or dies.\n\nLife Is Funny by E.

Maya Angelou's first memoir, published in 1969 is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local \"powhitetrash.\" When she journeys at eight to her mother's side in St. Louis, she is attacked by a man many times her age. Years later, in San Francisco, she learns about love for herself-and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. The kindness of others, Maya's own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (\"I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare\") will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful-now in a beautiful keepsake edition-I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds as long as people read.\n\nAn Essay Concerning Human Understanding by John Locke\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection B1290 1979\n\nISBN: 9780198245957\n\nLocke's Essay (1690) withstood an onslaught by traditional theologians, for rejecting orthodox theology and the concept of innate ideas: as he suggested that God could make matter think. The Essay quickly became one of the most influential books of the eighteenth century, and its contributions to the philosophy of space and time, matter and power were quickly hailed as formative contributions to philosophy.\n\nAn Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation by Jeremy Bentham\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection B1574.B33 I5\n\nISBN: 0198205163\n\nAn Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, Jeremy Bentham's best-known work, is a classic text in modern philosophy and jurisprudence. First published in 1789, it contains the important statement of the foundations of utilitarian philosophy and a pioneering study of crime andpunishment, both of which remain at the heart of contemporary debates in moral and political philosophy, economics, and legal theory.\n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection B2778.E5 G89 1998\n\nISBN: 9780879755966\n\nMetaphysicians have for centuries attempted to clarify the nature of the world and how rational human beings construct their ideas of it. Materialists believed that the world (including its human component) consisted of objective matter, an irreducible substance to which qualities and characteristics could be attributed. Mindthoughts, ideas, and perceptionswas viewed as a more sophisticated material substance. Idealists, on the other hand, argued that the world acquired its reality from mind, which breathed metaphysical life into substances that had no independent existence of their own. These two camps seemed deadlocked until Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason endeavored to show that the most accurate theory of reality would be one that combined relevant aspects of each position, yet transcended both to arrive at a more fundamental metaphysical theory. Kant's synthesis sought to disclose how human reason goes about constructing its experience of the world, thus intertwining objective simuli with rational processes that arrive at an orderly view of nature.\n\nKant's Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason by James J. DiCenso\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection B2792 .D53 2012\n\nISBN: 1107009340\n\nReligion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason is a key element of the system of philosophy which Kant introduced with his Critique of Pure Reason, and a work of major importance in the history of Western religious thought. It represents a great philosopher's attempt to spell out the form and content of a type of religion that would be grounded in moral reason and would meet the needs of ethical life. It includes sharply critical and boldly constructive discussions on topics not often treated by philosophers, including such traditional theological concepts as original sin and the salvation or 'justification' of a sinner, and the idea of the proper role of a church.\n\nThe Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection BF637.S4 P43 1978\n\nISBN: 0671250671\n\nA psychiatrist suggests ways in which confronting and resolving problems, a painful process most people try to avoid, can lead to greater self-understanding and spiritual growth.\n\nFable of the Bees, Volume 2 by Bernard Mandeville\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection BJ1520 .M4 1988\n\nISBN: 0865970777\n\nIt used to be that everyone read the \"notorious\" Bernard Mandeville (1670-1733). He was a great satirist and came to have a profound impact on economics, ethics and social philosophy. \"The Fable of the Bees\" begins with a poem and continues with a number of essays and dialogues. It is all tied together by the startling and original idea that \"private vices\" (self-interest) lead to \"publick benefits\" (the development and operation of society).\n\nThe Autobiography of Malcolm X by Malcolm X\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection BP223.Z8L57943 1992\n\nISBN: 0345379756\n\nIn the searing pages of this classic autobiography, originally published in 1964, Malcolm X, the Muslim leader, firebrand, and anti-integrationist, tells the extraordinary story of his life and the growth of the Black Muslim movement. His fascinating perspective on the lies and limitations of the American Dream, and the inherent racism in a society that denies its nonwhite citizens the opportunity to dream, gives extraordinary insight into the most urgent issues of our own time. The Autobiography of Malcolm X stands as the definitive statement of a movement and a man whose work was never completed but whose message is timeless. It is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand America.\n\nIn the Beginning by Isaac Asimov\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection BS651.A75 1981\n\nISBN: 0517543362\n\nThe beginning of time. The origin of life. In our Western civilization, there are two influential accounts of beginnings. One is the biblical account, compiled more than two thousand years ago by Judean writers who based much of their thinking on the Babylonian astronomical lore of the day. The other is the account of modern science, which, in the last century, has slowly built up a coherent picture of how it all began. Both represent the best thinking of their times, and in this line-by-line annotation of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, Isaac Asimov carefully and evenhandedly compares the two accounts, pointing out where they are similar and where they are different. \"There is no version of primeval history, preceding the discoveries of modern science, that is as rational and as inspiriting as that of the Book of Genesis,\" Asimov says. However, human knowledge does increase, and if the biblical writers \"had written those early chapters of Genesis knowing what we know today, we can be certain that they would have written it completely differently.\" Isaac Asimov brings to this fascinating subject his wide-ranging knowledge of science and history--and his award-winning ability to explain the complex with accuracy, clarity, and wit.\n\nAnd No Birds Sang by Farley Mowat\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection D811.M683 1979\n\nISBN: 0316586951\n\nIn this first-person narrative, the author retells his combat experiences in Italy in a Canadian regiment during World War II.\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection DS135.N6 F73313 1989\n\nISBN: 0385240236\n\nDiscovered in the attic in which she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has since become a world classic -- a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit. In 1942, with Nazis occupying Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the \"Secret Annex\" of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death. In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, her account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.\n\nBloods, An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Wallace Terry\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection DS559.5.B56 1984\n\nISBN: 9780345311979\n\nThe national bestseller that tells the truth about the Vietnam War from the black soldiers' perspective.

In 2020, it found a new readership in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the centering of narratives interrogating race by Black writers. Bearing singular insight into the rage and frustration of colonized peoples, and the role of violence in spurring historical change, the book incisively attacks the twin perils of post-independence colonial politics: the disenfranchisement of the masses by the elites on the one hand, and intertribal and interfaith animosities on the other. A landmark text for revolutionaries and activists, The Wretched of the Earth is an eternal touchstone for civil rights, anti-colonialism, psychiatric studies, and Black consciousness movements around the world.\n\nThe Struggle Is My Life by Nelson Mandela; S.

In 1771, at the age of 65, he sat down to write his autobiography, \"having emerged from the poverty and obscurity in which I was born and bred to a state of affluence and some degree of reputation in the world, and having gone so far through life with a considerable share of felicity.\" The result is a classic of American literature. No area of human endeavor escaped Franklin's keen attentions.\n\nThe Glory and the Dream : A Narrative History of America, 1932-1972 by William Manchester\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection E806 .M34 1974\n\nISBN: 0316544965\n\nThis volume covers 50 years of American history from the Great Depression to Richard Nixon's second term.

Here was the testament of a born outsider: a Puerto Rican in English-speaking America; a dark-skinned morenito in a family that refused to acknowledge its African blood. Here was an unsparing document of Thomas's plunge into the deadly consolations of drugs, street fighting, and armed robbery--a descent that ended when the twenty-two-year-old Piri was sent to prison for shooting a cop. As he recounts the journey that took him from adolescence in El Barrio to a lock-up in Sing Sing to the freedom that comes of self-acceptance, faith, and inner confidence, Piri Thomas gives us a book that is as exultant as it is harrowing and whose every page bears the irrepressible rhythm of its author's voice.\n\nThe Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm by Jacob Grimm; Wilhelm Grimm\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection GR166 .G54313 2014\n\nISBN: 0691160597\n\nWhen Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm published their Children's and Household Tales in 1812, followed by a second volume in 1815, they had no idea that such stories as \"Rapunzel,\" \"Hansel and Gretel,\" and \"Cinderella\" would become the most celebrated in the world. Yet few people today are familiar with the majority of tales from the two early volumes, since in the next four decades the Grimms would publish six other editions, each extensively revised in content and style. For the very first time, The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm makes available in English all 156 stories from the 1812 and 1815 editions. These narrative gems, newly translated and brought together in one beautiful book, are accompanied by sumptuous new illustrations from award-winning artist Andrea Dezsö. From \"The Frog King\" to \"The Golden Key,\" wondrous worlds unfold--heroes and heroines are rewarded, weaker animals triumph over the strong, and simple bumpkins prove themselves not so simple after all. Esteemed fairy tale scholar Jack Zipes offers accessible translations that retain the spare description and engaging storytelling style of the originals. Indeed, this is what makes the tales from the 1812 and 1815 editions unique--they reflect diverse voices, rooted in oral traditions, that are absent from the Grimms' later, more embellished collections of tales. Zipes's introduction gives important historical context, and the book includes the Grimms' prefaces and notes. A delight to read, The Original Folk and Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm presents these peerless stories to a whole new generation of readers.\n\nSchoolgirls : Young Women, Self-esteem, and the Confidence Gap by Peggy Orenstein\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection HQ798.O74 1994\n\nISBN: 0385425759\n\nIn 1990, the American Association of University Women conducted a ground-breaking poll that highlighted how, as young girls reach adolescence, their self-esteem plummets. The conclusion of the study (an investigation that involved over three thousand girls and boys between the ages of nine and fifteen and cut across ethnic and regional lines) was alarming: there is a crisis in this country regarding the way we educate our daughters. In spite of the changes in women's roles in society - and in the lives of their own mothers - many American girls still fall into traditional patterns of low self-image and self-censorship. Girls begin first grade with the same levels of skill and ambition as boys, but, all too often, by the time they reach high school their doubts have crowded out their dreams. They emerge from adolescence with reduced expectations of life, and much less confidence in themselves and in their abilities than boys have. In SchoolGirls, journalist Peggy Orenstein presents the human side of the study's disturbing statistics, using an accessible, narrative approach to explore the influences of home, school, and society on adolescent female self-esteem and the difference between how boys and girls are raised to think about themselves. Through detailed and lively anecdotes - obtained during a year spent with eighth graders at two California schools, as well as interviews with their parents and teachers - Orenstein brings to life the AAUW's profoundly important findings. At Weston Middle School, we meet Lisa, who believes a girl's weight is more important than her intelligence; Suzy, who decides she is \"too cute to be a lawyer\"; and Evie, who proclaims herself to be a feminist yet tolerates sexual harassment by a popular boy. At Audubon Middle School, however, where the predominantly African-American and Latina girls struggle with pressures forced upon them by their gender, race, and low socioeconomic status, we meet LaRhonda and April, whose confidence in themselves outside the classroom clashes inside its walls with a hidden curriculum designed to \"subdue them into disengaged silence.\" Marta, a Latina almost unnoticed by her teachers and overprotected by her parents, considers undergoing a sexually abusive gang initiation rite in order to gain some measure of acceptance. An essential read for everyone concerned about gender equity, SchoolGirls shows how the media and our educational system are shortchanging our children. It is a book that can inspire us to change the way we treat girls and the way we educate girls: ultimately, this is a book with the potential to improve the status of women in this country.\n\nThe Glass Castle : A Memoir by Jeannette Walls\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection HV5132 .W35 2005\n\nISBN: 9780743247535\n\nJournalist Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary and their four children lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children's imagination, teaching them how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary painted and wrote and couldn't stand the responsibility of providing for her family. When the money ran out, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town Rex had tried to escape. As the dysfunction escalated, the children had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they found the resources and will to leave home. Yet Walls describes her parents with deep affection in this tale of unconditional love in a family that, despite its profound flaws, gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life\n\nIn Our Defense by C. Kennedy\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection KF4750.A43 1990\n\nISBN: 0380717204\n\nThe Bill of Rights defines and defends the freedoms we enjoy as Americans--from the right to bear arms to the right to a civil jury. Using the dramatic true stories of people whose lives have been deeply affected by such issues as the death penalty and the right to privacy, attorneys Ellen Alderman and Caroline Kennedy reveal how the majestic principles of the Bill of Rights have taken shape in the lives of ordinary people, as well as the historic and legal significance of each amendment. In doing so, they shed brilliant new light on this visionary document, which remains as vital and as controversial today as it was when a great nation was newly born.\n\nThe Sign of the Beaver by Elizabeth George Speare\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection LT1074.3 .L49 lexile 700-799\n\nISBN: 0440479002\n\nTwelve-year-old Matt is left on his own in the Maine wilderness while his father leaves to bring the rest of the family to their new settlement.

Hailed as a masterpiece by critics worldwide, The Last Temptation of Christ is a monumental reinterpretation of the Gospels that brilliantly fleshes out Christ's Passion. This literary rendering of the life of Jesus Christ has courted controversy since its publication by depicting a Christ far more human than the one seen in the Bible. He is a figure who is gloriously divine but earthy and human, a man like any other-subject to fear, doubt, and pain. In elegant, thoughtful prose Nikos Kazantzakis, one of the greats of modern literature, follows this Jesus as he struggles to live out God's will for him, powerfully suggesting that it was Christ's ultimate triumph over his flawed humanity, when he gave up the temptation to run from the cross and willingly laid down his life for mankind, that truly made him the venerable redeemer of men.\n\nThe Satyricon/Seneca, the Apocolocyntosis by Petronius; Seneca\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PA6558.E5 S8 1986\n\nISBN: 0140444890\n\nPerhaps the strangest--and most strikingly modern--work to survive from the ancient world, The Satyricon relates the hilarious mock epic adventures of the impotent Encolpius, and his struggle to regain virility. Here Petronius brilliantly brings to life the courtesans, legacy-hunters, pompous professors and dissolute priestesses of the age - and, above all, Trimalchio, the archetypal self-made millionaire whose pretentious vulgarity on an insanely grand scale makes him one of the great comic characters in literature. Seneca's The Apocolocyntosis, a malicious skit on 'the deification of Claudius the Clod', was designed by the author to ingratiate himself with Nero, who was Claudius' successor. Together, the two provide a powerful insight into a darkly fascinating period of Roman history. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.\n\nReforming Fictions by Carol Batker\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PA8201.A4 1974b\n\nISBN: 9780231118507\n\nRecovering a lost chapter of literary and political history, this fresh, multicultural reading of the work of women writers of the Progressive era situates their fiction in the context of their reform journalism and political activism. As Native, African, and Jewish American women gained access to education, developed women's clubs, and joined political organizations, they wrote to reform the nation, engaging themselves politically and creating a cross-cultural dialogue between journalism and fiction. Early in this century, writers such as Zitkala-Sa, Mourning Dove, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, and Anzia Yezierska developed their writing careers through affiliations with reform organizations. They worked for Pan-Indianism, racial uplift, immigrant aid, or social welfare. Carol Batker explores the impact of their journalism and political work on their fiction. She demonstrates points of contact among these women that suggest mutual influence and conversations across racial and ethnic lines--revealing important historical antecedents to contemporary debates about multiculturalism in America.\n\nThe Story of Zahra by Hanan Al-Shaykh\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PJ7862.H356 H5513 1994\n\nISBN: 0385471300\n\nZahra, a child of the Shia community in South Lebanon, is haunted by dark memories of deception and abuse by her parents. She flees her family and takes refuge with an uncle who is in political exile in West Africa. She finds no peace there however, and desperately enters into a loveless and doomed marriage. Dispirited and emotionally unstable, she returns to Beirut where civil war is raging. She enters a world in which explosions, shootings, and arbitrary death are commonplace. In a demented effort to stem the violence, she begins an affair with a sniper to divert him from his task. It is only then that she finds redemption, a strange fulfillment of her search for ecstasy, and a dream of how life could be, should the war ever end.\n\nThe Analects of Confucius by Confucius\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PL2478 .L3 2007\n\nISBN: 0231141653\n\nCompiled by disciples of Confucius in the centuries following his death in 479 B.C.E., The Analects of Confucius is a collection of aphorisms and historical anecdotes embodying the basic values of the Confucian tradition: learning, morality, ritual decorum, and filial piety. Reflecting the model eras of Chinese antiquity, the Analects offers valuable insights into successful governance and the ideal organization of society. Filled with humor and sarcasm, it reads like a casual conversation between teacher and student, emphasizing the role of the individual in the attainment of knowledge and the value of using historical events and people to illuminate moral and political concepts. Confucius's teachings focus on cultural and peaceful pursuits and the characteristics of benevolent and culturally distinguished government. He also discusses ancestor worship and other rites performed for the spirits of the dead. The single most influential philosophical work in all of Chinese history, The Analects of Confucius has shaped the thought and customs of China and neighboring countries for centuries. Burton Watson's concise translation uses the pinyin romanization system and keeps explanatory notes to a minimum, yet his intimate knowledge of the Confucian tradition and precise attention to linguistic detail capture the original text's elegance, cogency, and wit.\n\nParadise of the Blind by Duong Thu Huong\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PL4378.9.D759 N4813 1994\n\nISBN: 9780140236200\n\nNow, at last, comes the first Vietnamese novel ever translated and published in North America.

Paradise of the Blind is a rich, sensuous journey through a Vietnam never seen before. In images of astonishing grace and power, and through her unforgettable gallery of women, Duong Thu Huong dazzles the reader with her ability to evoke the colors, the foods, the smells, and the age-old rituals of her country. At the center of the novel is Hang, a young woman forced to grow up too fast in the slums of Hanoi and the turbulence of modern Vietnam. Duong Thu Huong brilliantly captures Hang's rebellion against her mother and the loneliness of her search for self. There is Hang's mother, who watches, powerless, as her life is shattered by a fanatical political campaign led by her own brother. And there is the mysterious Aunt Tam, who has accumulated wealth and bitterness in equal parts and seeks to pass on both to her niece, Hang. The intoxicating beauty of the Vietnamese countryside, the hunger, the pride, the endurance of ordinary Vietnamese people confronted with the hypocrisy and corruption that surround them - all are here in this moving and lyrical novel. With the publication of Paradise of the Blind comes the introduction of a world-class storyteller whose extraordinary sensitivity and courage have captivated a generation of Vietnamese readers.\n\nThe Cartoons That Shook the World by Jytte Klausen\n\nCall Number: Foley General Collection PN5289.A253 M675 2009\n\nISBN: 0300124724\n\nOn September 30, 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published twelve cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Five months later, thousands of Muslims inundated the newspaper with outpourings of anger and grief by phone, email, and fax; from Asia to Europe Muslims took to the streets in protest. This book is the first comprehensive investigation of the conflict that aroused impassioned debates around the world on freedom of expression, blasphemy, and the nature of modern Islam. Jytte Klausen interviewed politicians in the Middle East, Muslim leaders in Europe, the Danish editors and cartoonists, and the Danish imam who started the controversy. Following the winding trail of protests across the world, she deconstructs the arguments and motives that drove the escalation of the increasingly globalized conflict. She concludes that the Muslim reaction to the cartoons was not-as was commonly assumed-a spontaneous emotional reaction arising out of the clash of Western and Islamic civilizations. Rather it was orchestrated, first by those with vested interests in elections in Denmark and Egypt, and later by Islamic extremists seeking to destabilize governments in Pakistan, Lebanon, Libya, and Nigeria.
