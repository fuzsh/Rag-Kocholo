        "text": "NEWS\n\n1. Postmedia and SaltWire\n\nPostmedia has still not come to an agreement with SaltWire’s employee unions, reports Tim Bousquet this morning.\n\nLate Wednesday, KSV Consulting, which is the company appointed as court monitor to oversee the SaltWire insolvency process, submitted a Supplementary Report to the court, updating the Fourth Report filed last week.\n\nWhile the exact details of Postmedia’s deal to acquire SaltWire are sealed by the court until the deal is finalized, the Fourth Report provided the broad strokes of it. Of relevance this morning are employee issues — the future of the unions representing workers at the Bluewater Road printing facility in Bedford and reporters at SaltWire’s daily papers.\n\nThe Fourth Report spelled out which assets Postmedia would acquire, and crucially that the Bluewater Road printing would not be acquired. Seemingly related to that, the deal is conditioned on the Herald Press and Herald Composing unions associated with the printing facility agreeing to give up their successor rights, effectively ending their unionized jobs.\n\nClick or tap here to read Postmedia acquisition of SaltWire: still no settlement with unions.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n2. Destiny Rennie\n\n“The family of a 22-year-old Mi’kmaq woman who died from fungal meningitis is suing Nova Scotia Health (NSH) and four physicians, alleging negligence in her death,” reports Yvette d’Entremont.\n\n“Destiny Rennie’s life was cut short by fungal meningitis, a death that could have been prevented. She was dismissed as a drug user because she was Indigenous,” says an Aug. 7 media release from PATH Legal.\n\n“Her mother was ignored because she was Indigenous. Destiny died because of harmful stereotypes entrenched in the healthcare system. She died because she was Indigenous.”\n\nA Statement of Claim filed by PATH Legal on July 25 alleges that doctors “breached the duty of care owed to Rennie, failing to correctly test, diagnose, treat and attend to her illness in a timely manner.”\n\nThe province hasn’t yet filed a defence, and none of the claims have been proven in court.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Family suing doctors and Nova Scotia Health in death of young Mi’kmaq woman.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n3. Dartmouth Cove\n\nThere’s more legal action regarding Dartmouth Cove.\n\nAtlantic Road Construction and Paving Ltd. (ARCP), the company that wants to infill a water lot it owns in the cove, has threatened to block public access to the Harbourfront Trail in the area. From my story on Wednesday:\n\nThe move comes after Halifax Regional Council approved a motion to amend a bylaw preventing infilling in the cove.\n\nAt its meeting on Tuesday, council approved a motion from Coun. Sam Austin to start a process to make amendments to the Municipal Planning Strategy to prevent infilling at Dartmouth Cove. That motion passed with councillors Pam Lovelace and David Hendsbee voting against it.\n\nDuring debate on the motion, Austin mentioned correspondence that was sent to council from the Atlantic Road Construction and Paving Ltd. (ARCP), or 4197847 Nova Scotia Ltd, that said the company would cut off access to the Harbourfront Trail at Dartmouth Cove if the motion was passed.\n\n“Is that a real threat to us?” Austin asked.\n\nMunicipal solicitor John Traves said the only thing he could say publicly was that the company has “no right to cut off a public easement that is in favour of HRM” because council started the discussion on amendments.\n\nThe Examiner got a copy of the letter sent to Mayor Mike Savage and Austin, which confirms the threat is real.\n\nI called and emailed Bruce Wood, CFO with Atlantic Road Construction and Paving Ltd., for comment, but haven’t heard back.\n\nClick or tap here to read “Councillor says ‘We will not be bullied’ after company threatens to block Dartmouth Cove trail.”\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n4. Code of conduct for encampments\n\nHalifax is in the process of creating a code of conduct for people living at the city’s six designated encampments as concerns about safety from the people living in and around the sites persist, reports Anjuli Patil with CBC.\n\nThere have been issues at some homeless encampments since more people have started living outside amid an affordable housing crunch in the city. For example, a man died at an encampment site that used to be in front of Halifax city hall in December 2023. There have also been fires, and people living near the sites have complained about physical altercations, drug use and harassment.\n\nA staff recommendation on the code of conduct was supported by Halifax regional council at its June 4 meeting.\n\nThe report noted the challenge with any rules or guidelines is the need for enforcement measures when someone doesn’t adhere to the code.\n\nA spokesperson with HRM told Patil that work on the code is still in progress, and they wouldn’t share more details.\n\nPatil also interviewed two men, Arnold Mombourquette and Brandon LeBlanc, who said a man from the encampment on the University Avenue berms spit at them.\n\nJeff Karabanow, an associate professor with Dalhousie University’s school of social work who has worked with people living on the streets, told CBC a code of conduct could be helpful, but said people living on the streets are more likely to be the victims of crime, not the perpetrators.\n\n“A lot of folks living in these particular places [encampments] want them to be open to the public because they feel that’s a much safer space for them to survive,” he said.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\n5. New rules for short-term rentals\n\nOn Wednesday, the province announced new regulations around short-term rentals such as Airbnb.\n\nIn a press release about the regulations, Minister of Housing John Lohr said “these changes will help address the urgent need for housing now.”\n\nFrom the press release:\n\nRegulations under the Short-term Rentals Registration Act include new registration requirements, host categories, rates and penalties.\n\nUnder the new registration requirements:\n\nall tourist accommodations and short-term rentals will be required to provide supporting documentation such as proof of compliance with municipal bylaws and, where applicable, written consent from the property owner(s) or condo board, and proof of primary residence\n\nannual registration rates range from $50 to $2,000 per unit depending on the accommodation type and location; higher rates apply to short-term rentals in areas where the need for housing is greater\n\nunregistered or non-compliant short-term rental operators may be subject to fines up to $100,000.\n\nAnnual registration rates for traditional tourist accommodations, such as motels, hotels and inns, are not changing.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\nVIEWS\n\nLet’s stick the landing on what criticizing Simone Biles’ hair is really about\n\nI don’t really follow every step of the Olympics, but with each Olympic Games I often watch clips of figure skating and gymnastics online. That’s what I’ve been doing the past couple of weeks as athletes compete in Paris. I enjoy figure skating and gymnastics for the same reasons. Both sports are a combination of power, balance, beauty, rhythm, grace, and endurance.\n\nOf course, one gymnast getting a lot of attention at the games in Paris is Simone Biles, who won four gold and one silver medal. Those wins in Paris have made Biles the most successful American gymnast with 11 titles at the Olympics.\n\nWhen I watched those clips of Biles’ performances at the Olympics, I would try to figure out how in the world she jumps so high and how she does those moves. I haven’t figured it out, but I am enthralled by her routines. But what I also saw on those clips were the comments that not only was she not always sticking the landings, but that her hair was sticking up all over the place.\n\nI joked last week that the people criticizing Biles for not sticking the landings or for her hair sticking out couldn’t even stick the landings getting up off their sofas from where they’re most likely making those comments.\n\nBiles even addressed the hair comments herself in an Instagram post she shared while on a 45-minute bus ride in the City of Lights during a heat wave.\n\n“Don’t come for me about my hair,” she wrote. “IT WAS DONE but bus has NO AC & it’s like 9,000 degrees.”\n\nWomen are often criticized for their hair, but Black women especially face intense criticism and comments that their natural hair is not considered professional. You can make sport history, have gymnastic skills named in your honour, and inspire girls and women everywhere, yet if you have hair out of place, you’re not a pro.\n\nThere’s another gymnast whose routines I have enjoyed watching since one went viral in 2019. That’s Katelyn Ohashi, who is known for her fun choreographed routine and her flips and landings, which include landing on the mat while doing the splits. That year, she got a perfect score of 10 for this routine.\n\nOhashi is not only amazing, but was having so much fun. That joy spread to the entire stadium.\n\nOhashi was subjected to cruel body shaming, so much so that she left the sport for a while.\n\nWhat I really love about the above video of Ohashi’s routine is watching her teammates and coaches on the sidelines, screaming in support and following along with the skills in her routine. When we talk about supporting women, this is what I mean; not criticizing them for their bodies or hair that is out of place.\n\nThe same comments for the men don’t seem to apply. Take Ethan Katzberg of British Columbia, who won gold in the men’s hammer throw final. Katzberg has long curly hair that is thinning at the hairline. He has a full moustache, but I haven’t seen any disparaging comments about his appearance, only online jokes comparing his look to legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Burton Cummings.\n\nEven Cummings got in on the joke on X, formerly Twitter, responding to a tweet that said, “and I would like to congratulate Burton Cummings for his gold medal win in the hammer throw. Guy can sing, throw hammers, what else can he do?”\n\n“Can honestly say it was like I wasn’t even there. Don’t even recall breaking a sweat,” Cummings replied.\n\nKatzberg sure knows how to throw a hammer, but no one is messing with his hair.\n\nBut none of these comments are really about Biles’ hair at all or any woman’s appearance, really. Commenting on a woman’s appearance is always about something else, notably putting her in her place, especially when a woman is good at what she does.\n\nWomen have always been pushed to extremes to maintain their appearance and criticized when their look doesn’t meet society’s standards of beauty. Those standards are based on white beauty and are unattainable, at least not without a lot of money. There are entire industries devoted to this. People love knocking a woman down, and they will go for her looks first. It’s all very Mean Girls. You know the line from the 2004 movie, “she’s not even that good looking if you really look at her.”\n\nBut Biles is not having any of it. Here’s what she had to say about inspiring young women:\n\nIt’s important to teach our female youth that it’s OK to say, ‘Yes, I am good at this,’ and you don’t hold back. You only see the men doing it. And they’re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it. But I feel like it’s good (to do) because once you realize you’re confident and good at it, then you’re even better at what you do.”\n\nThis is a good lesson for all women.\n\nSome people have said Biles’ hair is about the rules of gymnastics, that judges look for perfection in hair and the gymnasts’ outfits. Maybe they can just change the rules, especially since Biles herself has done such difficult routines that she alone has changed the sport itself. In the U.S., 20 states have adopted the Crown Act, which stands for creating a respectful and open world for natural hair. That legislation protects Black women and women of colour from race-based hair bias, prohibiting discrimination based on hair texture and style.\n\nSo, why can’t rules around hair and style be changed in sports? Also, do those same rules about appearance apply to the men?\n\nOn Sunday, Rebeca Andrade won gold on her floor routine. That win makes her the most decorated Olympian in the history of her home country of Brazil.\n\nBiles won silver and Jordan Chiles, Biles’ teammate, won bronze. On the podium, with Andrade standing in the centre, gold medal around her neck and her arms in the air in celebration, Biles and Chiles, who stood on either side of Andrade, bowed to her win. This wasn’t only sportsmanship, but women supporting the success of women, just like Ohashi’s teammates and coaches did when she got that perfect 10 in 2019.\n\nIn Paris, Biles performed her floor routine to “…Ready for It?” from Taylor Swift’s 2017 album Reputation. “Baby, let the games begin,” goes the chorus of the tune, which seemed an appropriate choice for Biles’ Olympic routine. Biles proved she was ready for it and so were her supporters.\n\nOf course, like Biles, Swift faces endless criticism, including for her appearance and her hair. I hope she and Biles — and the rest of us women — can all just shake it off because the haters are always gonna hate, hate, hate.\n\n(Send this item as a separate article: right click and copy this link)\n\nNOTICED\n\nYesterday, anti-poverty activist Kendall Worth sent me this link to his blog, Journalism for What Matters. Like other reporters, Worth can’t post links to his blog on Facebook, so he sent it to me for a read.\n\nWorth’s latest blog is about why the province’s Disability Support Program (DSP) needs major reforms. Worth writes:\n\nThe DSP is not only inadequate in terms of funding but it is also hugely confusing to prospective clients such as persons with disabilities, Income Assistance recipients and their individual and organizational advocates.\n\nWorth interviewed four people who receive income assistance about their experiences with DSP — he also included a list of its programs and services.\n\nWorth doesn’t name the people he interviewed, but he shared some of what he learned:\n\nFirst of all, just learning about these different programs is a challenge. All four IA recipients told me that they have never been offered any of the above programs and their case workers seem reluctant to explain the features and availability of these programs, even when clients ask directly and express interest.\n\nQualifying for these programs is an even bigger challenge. DSP clients tell me that it feels like their regular caseworkers and DSP staff make applying to these programs difficult and as a result very few individuals actually do access these services. (I am not able to name these clients as they have asked not to be named.)\n\nIt is frustrating to note that other persons with disabilities I have spoken with have told me that they are actually relieved NOT to be part of DSP, because the terms and conditions of that Program are so problematic. They say that they will only apply to access DSP services once major changes are made to DSP rules and processes by the Government.\n\nWorth offers a good look at DSP as well as the problems and restrictions around sheltered workshops and the Independent Living Support Program.\n\nYou can follow Worth’s blog here.\n\n(Send this item: right click and copy this link)\n\nGovernment\n\nNo meetings\n\nOn campus\n\nDalhousie\n\nToday\n\nPhD Thesis Defence: Psychology and Neuroscience (Thursday, 1:30pm, Room 3107, Mona Campbell Building and online) — Mary Elizabeth O’Leary will defend “Probiotics, Pregnancy and The Postpartum Period: Effects of Diet and Probiotic Treatment on Maternal and Offspring Health Outcomes in a Long-Evans Rat Model”\n\nTomorrow\n\nPhD Thesis Defence: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Friday, 10am, Room 3107, Mona Campbell Building and online) — Tam Pham will defend “From Intrinsically Disordered Peptides And Proteins To Globular Proteins To Supramolecular Complexes: Development Of New 19F-NMR Methodologies For Increased Versatility In Characterization Of Polypeptide Biophysics, Membrane Binding, And Intermolecular In”\n\nPhD Thesis Defence: Interdisciplinary PhD Program (Friday, 1:30pm, Room 3107, Mona Campbell Building and online) — Kate Thompson will defend “The application of ecosystem services concepts in Canadian urban planning”\n\nMolecular crowding effects on proteins: finding the right happy medium between top-down and bottom-up approaches (Friday, 2:30pm, Room 3H, Tupper Building and Room 221, DMNB) — Valerie Booth from Memorial University will talk\n\nEtuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) (Friday, 7pm, Dalhousie Art Gallery) — Elder Dr. Albert Marshall will discuss why and how we should approach topics through the lens of Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing), a guiding principle in recognizing the benefits of multiple perspectives and learning to see with one eye from the strengths of Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing, and the other eye with the strengths of Western knowledges, learning to use both these eyes together, for the benefit of all; reception to follow; more info here and here\n\nIn the harbour\n\nHalifax\n\n05:00: Contship Art, container ship, arrives at Fairview Cove from New York\n\n09:00: HDMS Lauge Koch, Danish navy patrol ship, arrives at Dockyard from sea\n\n10:00: John Paul de Joria, research/survey vessel, arrives at Dartmouth Cove from Ilulissat, Greenland\n\n12:00: Albanyborg, cargo ship, sails from anchorage for sea\n\n12:00: Nolhan Ava, ro-ro cargo, arrives at Pier 41 from Saint-Pierre\n\n12:00: Vivienne Sheri D, container ship, arrives at Pier 42 from Portland\n\n16:30: Oceanex Sanderling, ro-ro container, moves from Autoport to anchorage\n\n17:00: Palmgracht, cargo ship, arrives at Pier 9 from Aviles, Spain\n\n19:00: Vivienne Sheri D sails for Reykjavik\n\n23:30: Contship Art sails for sea\n\n02:00 (Friday): Plantijngracht, cargo ship, arrives at Outer Harbour for pilot pickup, continues on to Sheet Harbour\n\nCape Breton\n\n03:00: Catalan Sea, oil tanker, arrives at EverWind from Tees, England\n\n06:30: AlgoScotia, oil tanker, arrives at Sydney anchorage from Corner Brook\n\n14:00: Arctic Lift, barge, with Western Tugger, tug, arrives at Aulds Cove quarry from Georgetown, PEI\n\nFootnotes\n\n“Progress over perfection,” is what my horseback riding coach says to me when I get stuck on a particular technical aspect of riding like keeping my right heel down.
