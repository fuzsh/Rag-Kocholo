        "text": "First, some blog business. I realized yesterday that WordPress had added “tags,” in addition to “categories,” so I went back through all the relevant posts last night and added tags that essentially relate to genres (thriller, horror, etc.). You should be able to click on those on the right side of the screen (scroll the page down until you get to the bottom of the linky content on the right) if you want to look at all the horror movies/TV, all the Westerns, etc.\n\nThese are different from the “Categories” links, which I’m mostly using to classify posts by ex-Boyfriend or general topic (movie review, TV show, e.g.). If you’re a librarian, you can think of categories as being equivalent to subject headings, and tags as being equal to descriptors (if only because I’m not going to be that careful about controlling the vocabulary in the “tags” section). If you’re not a librarian, you should just count your lucky stars I haven’t started classifying each post using the Dewey Decimal System. Nerd alert!\n\nAs most of you old-hat bloggers already know, the bigger the font size in the “tag cloud” display, the more posts that have been tagged with that term. So, the word “thriller” is huge because I’ve watched a lot of thrillers lately, while “crap” is still reasonably small. Based on my usual movie watching tendencies, however, I suspect “crap” will quickly expand in size over the coming weeks.\n\nOkay, now onto the (extremely long!) post. I’ve already done a run-through of all the NEW shows this year (though I’ll give you another update on some of those soon as well, since my feelings on a few have changed recently). But, I didn’t want to neglect some of the “old” shows, especially since there are a few I think are having their best seasons so far.\n\nI’m breaking “old” shows (or “returning series,” in gentler terms) down into three categories: Aging Gracefully, Dying a Much-Too-Slow Death, and Just Plain Getting Old. I’ll start with the Aging Gracefully ones, and do separate posts for the other two categories over the next few days.\n\nAging Gracefully\n\nBones — Fox, Tuesdays, 8pm — Last season, I enjoyed this show but wasn’t always in a huge hurry to watch it. I did love the guest spot from Stephen Fry as Booth’s psychoanalyist, but I’ve found some of the other characters on the show a bit hard to stomach since day one. Okay, okay, I’ll just come right out and say it: I HATE ANGELA. Everything about her annoys the bejesus out of me, especially her extreme overuse of the word “sweetie.” I realize this makes me a terrible person, since she’s supposed to be the nicest, most caring person in the lab. Nevertheless, I long for the day Tempe will be called in to identify her skull using dental records.\n\nI can’t believe I just wrote that sentence.\n\nSince I’m confessing, I might as well also mention that I found the early version of Tempe annoying with her unbelievable lack of pop culture knowledge — “I don’t know what that means” was one of her most oft-spoken lines, and more than once, I found myself yelling in response, “NOBODY doesn’t know what that means! Gah!”\n\nAlso, of course, I’m a huge fan of the Kathy Reichs mystery series this show is based on, and the Tempe in the books is absolutely nothing like the Tempe on the show. This took some getting used to for me. I’ve enjoyed Bones consistently since the beginning, but it wasn’t really until last season that I started to get a little more enthusiastic about it. So far this year, though, I’ve so thoroughly enjoyed every episode I find myself actually tuning in for it live Tuesday nights (something I never usually do, especially now that I have a DVR).\n\nI’m really enjoying the relationship between Booth and Tempe — they’ve got great chemistry — and Tempe’s quirks have started to become less grating and more endearing for me with time. Booth’s sarcastic sense of humor kinda makes me swoon, and I also love the geeks back at the lab, especially when they start arguing about Einstein and/or superheroes. All in all, this is an extremely charming show, with solid plots, entertaining characters, and an all around “fun” vibe (my mom just cringed at my use of the word “fun” as an adjective, by the way. Hi, Mom!). A keeper, and one I look forward to more and more with each passing week.\n\nNCIS — Tuesdays, CBS, 8pm — This series has had its ups and downs over the years, and I still haven’t stopped hating Lauren Holly in her role as the NCIS director. Yet, there are many other things I adore about this show, and, so far, I’ve been enjoying this season more than ever before. This is a solid, consistent crime series that does a great job of giving us some insight into the characters’ personal lives, without making it feel unnecessary and clumsy (by comparison, think of the very badly-done personal stories peppering CSI periodically — Gil’s hearing loss, his relationship with Sara, all gak-inducing and distracting). I love Abby, the forensics girl, as well as McGee (and not just because he shares the nickname “McGeek” with me). DiNozzo’s penchant for movie quotes has endeared him to me for life, and, of course, Mark Harmon — ’nuff said. The only thing they should stop doing, in my opinion, is having Ziva continue to get American slang wrong — she’s been here too long now to keep confusing the colloquialisms. Aside from that, though, I’m still having a lot of fun watching this one.\n\nSupernatural — Thursdays, CW, 9pm — Oh man, this show is just A BLAST. I thought last year was the best for the series so far (that episode about the trickster was 100% pure comedy gold), but instead, the show is getting smarter, funnier, and more creative with every passing week. I especially predict a LOT of fun now that Dean thinks he’s only got a year to live, as well. Aside from the mandatory artery-clogging burger-eating and the oodles of premarital sex he’s been seeking since receiving the news of his imminent demise (it’s a long story), I think we’ll see a lot more action as he starts to take increasing “death be damned” types of risks when going after Big Bads. That was a great plot development, though I do think they’ll have to be careful not to let Sam sink down too far into moodiness, as he is often wont to do. Because when Sam starts moping around acting all maudlin, I begin feeling twitchy, and with him thinking Dean is doomed, I’m a little concerned the mood of the show might start to crash at times.\n\nNo crashing. Crashing = bad.\n\nBecause, oh man, that banter. When it’s flowing, it is some of the best witty dialogue ever to grace the small screen. The writers of this show not only know a ton about supernatural stories and myths, but they know brotherhood and sibling relations like the backs of their hands. In fact, I’d argue that now Veronica Mars is gone, this is the only show left that really does banter. And man, does it ever do banter well. If you’ve never seen the series, I’d advocate for starting with Season One on DVD, because backstory is sort of important. But you could also be jumping into the current episodes while you’re making up for lost time (also, I describe the series in more detail in the Boyfriend write-ups for Jared Padalecki, Jensen Ackles, and their dead father, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan — so check those out for more information too). If you like spooky plots, brilliant writing, and two extraordinarily good-looking young men and you are NOT watching Supernatural. . . Dude . . . Seriously. Get on the ball.\n\nMen in Trees — Fridays, ABC, 9pm — Technically, we’re still finishing up season one of this series, so I can’t really start this paragraph off by saying I’m enjoying season two even more than season one. (Last year, ABC cut the first season short so it could kickstart a few late-bloomers in its timeslot, and though that meant a torturous spring for us fans, the nice thing is that it means an extra-long season this year.) But, nevertheless, things have begun to improve radically for all the characters in Elmo, especially now that Lynn has hit the road and a few other plotlines are back on track. It can only get more fun from here, my friends. I feel confident of that. The bad news is I just can’t shake this sinking feeling that nobody else is watching this one and that, because of that, it’s simply not going to survive its second year. I will be more traumatized by its cancellation than I was by the cancellations of Eyes and Wonderfalls, and if you remember me back then, you know I was moping for WEEKS over those two. So, if you aren’t watching this show, I’m begging you to tune in so we can keep the numbers up. Even if you hate the concept (or, more relevantly, even if you hate Anne Heche, an emotion I fully understand), there’s just sooooo much to love about the boys, not to mention the lovely setting. James Tupper as the scruffy outdoorsman Jack! Abraham Benrubi as the bear-like barkeep with a heart of gold! Derek Richardson as the geeky boy toy! There’s plenty for everyone. The only thing so far this year I haven’t enjoyed much is the guest spot from Callum Keith Rennie, and that’s just because he suddenly looks old enough to be my grandfather. A fact I found sort of disturbing, especially since my grandfather is old enough to be DEAD.\n\nCSI: NY — Wednesdays, CBS, 10pm — I watched about the first six episodes of season one of this CSI spin-off when it first started and got so sleepy from all the drearily (un)lit sets that I gave up on it. Besides, nothing irritates me more in movies or on television than a morgue that is badly lit — I refuse to believe medical examiners ever do autopsies in dark rooms, even when they want a cool air of mysterious ambiance. I caught a few reruns last year, and was still sort of “meh” on the series, I’ll confess. But this year, I decided to give it a more serious try after having a few conversations about it with friends and family who are fans, and I’ve been nothing but impressed ever since. They’ve finally shaken off some of the extra-silly darkness (both in the settings and in the characters’ psyches), and the mystery plots themselves have been intriguing instead of old news. I really enjoyed the “Second Life” storyline from two weeks ago, which looks like it’ll stick around for a bit this season, and even the Halloween one, a bit cheesy as it was (set in Amityville, no less), was still pretty fun. All in all, this show seems to be getting better with age. A quality I both admire AND share, if I do say so myself.\n\nNumb3rs — Fridays, CBS, 10pm — I got bored with this show last year when they got rid of Peter MacNicol so he could do 24. I was surprised, really, by how huge a gap that left in the series for me. But I was sucked back in last spring by the season finale with the whole double-triple-cross thing with Colby. I got a bit more caught up with reruns over the summer, and was eager to tune back in when the show started up again this fall. So far, despite the fact I still don’t understand why all the geniuses have stopped shaving, I’ve been really enjoying this year’s round of episodes. I keep waiting for them to run out of ways they can work math into the mysteries, but so far, they’ve managed to continue doing it and in ways I frequently find fascinating and surprising (plus, I just like saying the words “Fibonacci numbers,” not to mention thinking about how cool they are). Geeks are fun; math geeks, doubly so. And I’ve been watching reruns of Northern Exposure lately in spare moments too, which is only making seeing Rob Morrow all grown up on Friday nights that much more entertaining. I can’t believe I haven’t made either of these two guys a Boyfriend of the Week yet. What am I, totally BLIND? Expect to see write-ups on both of them in 2008.\n\nTune in later this weekend for part two of this series, which will focus on TV shows that should be dead and yet continue to refuse to go gently into that good night. So to speak.\n\nOkay, everybody, I’ve given almost every new show at least two episodes now to hook me or lose me, and I have the final tally for Fall TV hits and misses. You know, in case you’re interested in MY stupid opinions on things like this (fools!).\n\nThe UTTERLY AWESOME (which means enjoy it while it lasts because some idiot will surely cancel it soon):\n\nPushing Daisies — ABC Wednesdays, 9pm. I think this series is absolutely brilliant. In fact, I’m loving it so much I’m actually watching it LIVE instead of just recording it and catching it later. I never do that, people! Never ever ever! But, put simply, this show has everything I love — it’s clever, funny, gorgeous (I keep describing its visuals to people as “Tim Burton-y” and getting lots of nods of agreement), and completely kooky. And, not to jinx it or anything, but it looks like it might even make it, as it won its timeslot the first week, and last week only lost out to Deal Or No Deal. Unfortunately, my Mom says she read last week that they’ve cut the budget (apparently, each episode has been costing them a fortune to put together), and also that the director has been (demoted?) to producer instead. That might be bad — hard to say for sure. Nevertheless, I have hope we might truly have a keeper on our hands. I’m keeping my fingers crossed, and my TV tuned to ABC on Wednesday nights at 8. (By the way, if you missed it and are now totally intrigued, you can watch all the episodes that have aired so far for free at ABC.com — go ahead, we’ll wait. . .)\n\nThe GOOD (BUT NOT NECESSARILY GREAT):\n\nK-Ville — FOX Mondays, 10pm. I still have some issues with the plots on this series, which often have elements that don’t make much sense. Nevertheless, I’m REALLY enjoying Cole Hauser and Anthony Anderson, and they have good chemistry. I also like the setting (New Orleans) and the guy who plays their boss.\n\nLife — CBS Wednesdays, 10pm. Yes, I hated the pilot (in fact, I never did manage to sit through the whole thing), but it’s time to confess that I enjoyed both of the episodes that followed. Damian Lewis is evening his character out a bit and dropping some of his annoying tics, and there are a few things about the series I find kind of interesting (I like the documentary-esque style of filming at times, and also am pretty engrossed in the mystery of who framed him to begin with as well). It may end up feeling too much like every other crime series out there after a while, but for now, I’m finding it pretty entertaining and unique (and yes, please feel free to say “I TOLD YOU SO” in the comments, you guys, because you were all right about this one and I was wrong, wrong, wrong!)\n\nThe BAD BUT STILL HIGHLY WATCHABLE:\n\nBionic Woman — NBC Wednesdays, 9pm. The heading of this category kind of says it all in regards to this one: bad but still watchable. I like the characters pretty well so far, and I still think it’s got a lot of potential (though it still needs to stop taking itself quite so seriously, in my opinion). Needs work, but so far I’m really enjoying it (and especially Katee Sackhoff IN it, mrrrrrrowl!).\n\nChuck — NBC Mondays, 8pm. I wasn’t sure I was going to stick with this one after the pilot, but I recorded the second episode and when I finally got around to watching it, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. It’s kind of dorky and not all that brilliantly written, but I’m like the main character, and who can resist Adam Baldwin as an all-too-serious government agent (a hilarious reversal of character to those of us who primarily know the guy as Jayne from Firefly)? Kinda fun. Might not make it, but should be entertaining while it lasts.\n\nMoonlight — CBS Fridays, 9pm. Wow, yes, it’s REALLY BAD. And, even worse, though I think the lead guy is good looking and has a very lovely smoky voice, there’s something about the clingy shirts he sometimes wears that makes me think “man boobs” every time I see him. That can’t be good. Nevertheless, this show is the sort of bad that really enjoy — it’s good-bad. And also, of course, KEVIN WEISMAN! As a geek! I’m in heaven.\n\nReaper — CW Tuesdays at 9pm. I’m still watching this series and still laughing every week, but I’m ready to admit it needs some serious work if it’s going to survive. The mystery plots need to be more of a focus each week instead of just the geek jokes, and that means they need to be a heck of a lot more intriguing. Bring in a few new writers and it might have a chance. Otherwise, I think it’s going straight to TV hell. . . in a toaster.\n\nWomen’s Murder Club — ABC Fridays, 9pm. This one just started last night so I’ve only seen the one episode, but while I fully expected to find it awful — why is it that on TV, all professional women must spend half their time whining about their crappy romantic lives? — I ended up kind of enjoying it. Yes, it’s BAD. In fact, it’s the exact level of badness one would expect from a series based on a novel by James Patterson (not exactly William Faulkner, that guy). Yet, Patterson novels sell like hotcakes despite their lack of brilliance for the same reason this show might have a shot — they’re cheesy fun. Hopefully this’ll be a good match with Men in Trees (welcome back, James Tupper!) which also returned last night. And by the way, I hope you all tuned in to that one for sure, because I LOVE MEN IN TREES and if it gets canceled, I’m holding all of YOU directly responsible!\n\nThe Erased from My DVR Timer Because I Couldn’t Stay Awake:\n\nJourneyman — NBC Mondays, 10pm. I’ve now seen three episodes, and found all three promising but ultimately boring and predictable as hell. Deleted it from the timer after I dozed off twenty minutes into the third ep. Life’s too short, especially since I figure if it does end up being a smash success (seems doubtful, but you never know), I can always catch it on DVD this summer.\n\nDirty Sexy Money — ABC Wednesdays, 10pm. I watched the first episode of this and thought it was okay but not really interesting enough to be worth sticking around for (shows like this aren’t typically my thing, though, and I can see why others might be enjoying it). Again, if it ends up being a huge success, there’s always DVD.\n\nAliens in America — CW Mondays, 8pm. I don’t usually watch sit-coms, but I’d read so many positive reviews about this one I decided to tune in. Watched the pilot and was kinda “meh” about it. A week later, I didn’t even last through the whole episode, and the thing’s only half an hour long. I just really don’t get it — it’s not that funny, it’s not that sweet, and the characters aren’t that adorable or charming. What are the critics seeing in this one?\n\nThe Erased from My DVR Timer Because It Pains Me to See the Great Tim Daly In Such Crap:\n\nPrivate Practice — ABC Wednesdays, 9pm. I cannot believe — CANNOT BELIEVE — this show is doing as well as it’s doing. I cannot believe — CANNOT BELIEVE — that this show is doing way, way better than Tim’s series from a few years ago, the utterly awesome private investigation show Eyes, which was canceled after only about six episodes even though it was one of the smartest and funniest shows ever to grace the small screen. This show is COMPLETE CRAP, people. There is absolutely nothing good about it whatsoever. Not ONE THING. Why are you wasting your time with this stupid, stupid show about stupid, stupid women and the stupid, stupid men who hang around them? This show is doing better than Pushing Daisies! That kind of makes me want to throw up. And then move to Canada. If you are a fan of this show, please do not tell me so in the comments, because you will only send me spiraling into despair. Tim! Please please get a better agent! I’m begging you!! Take Taye Diggs and run, man! RUN!\n\nNon-New Shows I Also Feel Like Talking About:\n\nBy the way, is it just me or does Heroes kinda suck this year? Discuss."
