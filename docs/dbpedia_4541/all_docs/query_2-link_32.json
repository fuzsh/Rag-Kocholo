        "text": "1.Â The two Loyalists were apparently Benjamin Mulberry Holmes of Boston, who owned several whaling vessels, and John Coffin, a prominent distiller in Boston before the war. Tupper succeeded in capturing a brig and a schooner at Marthaâs Vineyard. On 26 Oct. Joseph Reed wrote to him: âThe General thanks you for your Care & Diligence in the Enterprizeâthe Success of which we are just now informed ofâYou will endeavour to get the Vessels to Plymouth as soon as possibleâwhere you will find Mr Watson who is Agent for the Continent & will advance you what Moneys may be necessary for the Satisfaction of those who have assisted youâThe General will notice you himself as it would be indelicate to leave that to yourselfâYou will then put those Vessels and the Cargoes in the Hands of Mr Watson who will take Care of them âtill farther Orders. We Apprehend that with Care and a Good Pilot you may get safe to Plymouthâ (DLC:GW). Reed also wrote to William Watson on the same date, directing him to receive the vessels and to dispose of any perishable articles in their cargoes as promptly and advantageously as possible. âIf Major Tupper could immediately man the Brig from Plymouth & be equipped without Loss of Time in sending backwards & forwards here for Ammunition,â Reed told Watson, âthe General would not object to his going out on a Cruize with her for a Month or 6 Weeksâbut if it cannot be done in a few Days the Season is too farr advanced for this Purposeâ (ibid.). See also Watson to GW, 30 Oct. 1775."
