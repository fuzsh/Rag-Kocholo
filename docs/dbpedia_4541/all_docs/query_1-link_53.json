        "text": "\"Raw, direct, and powerful...This work is vitally important.\"—Ken Stern, former CEO of National Public Radio\n\nAs a captain in the Army National Guard, Benjamin Tupper spent a year in Afghanistan. Separated from most of his unit, Ben, along with his partner Corporal Radoslaw “Ski” Polanski, served in an Embedded Training Team, teaching, training, and leading into combat the green Afghan troops. But what they experienced went well beyond the assigned mission, and the war proved to be a mix of drudgery, absurdity, and ever-present dangers.\n\nWriting and recording from a remote outpost, Tupper began to share his stories with Americans back home. His boots-on-the-ground dispatches were broadcast on NPR’s Morning Edition and published on Slate.com’s military blog, The Sandbox.\n\nIn Greetings from Afghanistan: Send More Ammo, Benjamin Tupper’s chronicling of life under fire pulls the reader into the realities of war with poignancy, humor, and vivid reality, offering a unique and compelling firsthand view of the Afghan people, their culture, and a battle for survival that began long before the Americans arrived.\n\nThis book title, Greetings From Afghanistan, Send More Ammo (Dispatches from Taliban Country), ISBN: 9780451233257, by Benjamin Tupper, published by Penguin Publishing Group (June 7, 2011) is available in paperback.
