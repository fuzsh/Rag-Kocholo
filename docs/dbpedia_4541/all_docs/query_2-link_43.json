        "text": "Caesar Jones was the ‘Negro servant’ of 2nd Lt. Timothy Jones of Bedford (MA). He was ‘freed before the Revolution and served in the war, doing duty in every campaign from the 19th of April to the end of the conflict.’I Lt. Jones, in Capt. Jonathan Wilson’s Bedford Minute Man company, became second in command after his Captain was killed on Battle Road. Caesar, if present, would have been a volunteer attached to this company (his name is not listed in the official military records for 1775). A town history gives more detail:\n\nFamily tradition has proved that Caesar, a freed slave, went to Concord with his master on the morning of April 19 and stayed with him until he returned home. Although a freed man, Caesar was not a free man, and he entered the service after the battles at Concord with the approval of his master. His name appears on the Bedford treasurer’s lists for the years of the war for receipt of grain and money as “bounty,” or extra pay allowed by the Town of Bedford for enlistment.II\n\nNo known military records list him from 1775 to 1781. On 1 May 1782, he did indeed enlist ‘to serve in the Continental Army for the term of three years,’ as a Private in Col. Benjamin Tupper’s 10th regiment. Probably due to the disbandment of the armed forces after the War, he only served a term of eight months. He received a bounty from Bedford on 11 May 1782 for his enlistment.III Town records show this bounty to be sixty pounds.IV He signed by an “X” mark with the note ‘A free negro’ appended.V\n\nHe is buried in the northeast corner of the Old Burial Grounds on Springs Road in Bedford. A stone monument marks the spot:\n\nCAMBRIDGE MOORE\n\nCAESAR PRESCOTT\n\nCAESAR JONES\n\nNEGRO SLAVES\n\nSOLDIERS\n\nIN THE REVOLUTION\n\n1775 1783\n\nFootnotes:\n\nBrown, Louise K. Bedford [MA] a Revolutionary town (1975), 231. There is some disagreement on these points. Brown, Abram English. History of the Town of Bedford, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, … to ...1891 … (1891), 31 states that there ‘is no evidence that any of the slaves of this town were permitted to accompany their masters to Concord on April 19, 1775.’ Therefore the proof level has been set at “?” [service not proven but probable] rather than “+” [service accepted by reason of a secondary source].\n\nIbid, 296.\n\nSecretary of Commonwealth.
