Empirical evidence for impact of rodent-targeted approaches on outcomes associated with rodents, ticks, human tick encounters, and tick-borne disease\n\nField evaluations of rodent-targeted approaches commonly include outcome measures related to tick infestation of rodents, pathogen infection of rodents, abundance of questing ticks representing species potentially impacted by the intervention, and pathogen infection prevalence in the questing ticks (see Sections 3.1 to 3.7). Only two studies of rodent-targeted interventions published to date have additionally included data for human tick encounters and human tick-borne disease (Hinckley et al., 2021; Keesing et al., 2022); both studies examined self-application of topical acaricide by rodents (see Section 3.2)."
