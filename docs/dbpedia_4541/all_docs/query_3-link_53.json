        "text": "On A Pilgrim in Narnia we have been playing with lists of the key books to read–what we might call a “canon.” We’ve thought about the key books of Western literature (here and here), thought about the problems of this discussion, and made some suggestions at developing our own Fantasy and SF canon. I thought today and next week we would turn to C.S. Lewis.\n\nLewis is one of the most widely read people I have ever encountered in history. He devoured books, which were his lifelong love and the foundation of his work as a scholar and writer. His own books are layered with hundreds of the great books of history hidden within the images, words, and stories. Even Narnia–especially Narnia, perhaps–is soaked through with echoes from mythology, children’s fiction, the poets, Arthurian tales, and the Bible. Not just these books, but their fictional worlds too. Even the world of Sherlock Holmes is connected with our early Narnian heroes.\n\nSo what books must we read in order to experience the rich layers within even an accessible author like C.S. Lewis? The list is massive. Every time I read an old book or pick up a Medieval or Romantic poet, I find something new in Lewis’ fiction. We are going to lose if we try to reproduce Lewis’ reading list. It is largely unknown to us, I suppose. But, more than that, he began reading the great works as a child, and read too often and too quickly for most of us to ever catch up.\n\nWhat I did, instead, was to conduct an experiment on An Experiment in Criticism.\n\nAn Experiment in Criticism is a fun little book. Lewis tries to answer the question great critics struggle with all the time (and we are thinking about here): what makes a great book? Lewis turns the question on its head by asking, “What makes a good reader?” I won’t tell you the answer to his question just yet (stay tuned), but in answering he considers in the 150 short pages of An Experiment in Criticism a vast swath of literature.\n\nSo I asked this question: What works of history would I have to read to know all the obvious references in this short book on literary criticism?\n\nNaturally, we would turn to the index and bibliography. There is none. And there are very few footnotes. This is a senior scholar (Chair at Cambridge) writing an essay for his colleagues and students at the end of his life. It is an important essay, predicting the arrival of Reader Response Criticism and Deconstructionism, and answering those movements at the same time. The American and English critics of the period all read it. Still, it is a very short essay.\n\nSo what I did was go through the book carefully and pull out every overt literary reference. I counted references to 86 individual books and poems. There were also a few dozen nods to poets, mythologies, religions, critics, literary and art movements, and narrative epochs.\n\nThat’s a lot of references for a few short pages.\n\nIn the end, I think this list of references makes for a great list of canonical authors. True, most of the critics reading Lewis’ Experiment in the 1960s won’t have read all these books and poems, but they will have read many of them and have a passing knowledge of the rest. It is light on the novelists, and he doesn’t deal much with poetry. It has more fantasy than another author might entertain, as you might imagine from one of the 20th century’s great fantasists. But I think it makes a great reading list.\n\nSo I share it with you. You can read An Experiment in Criticism any time you want, but here is the list you would need to get every reference Lewis made. I also included a list of authors Lewis mentions by name, expecting the reader to know their works. In an even more significant way, this is the list of Western canonical authors. Accidental and incomplete, it is a great way to dive in to a reading of our culture’s foundational books.\n\nThen, as you write your own poems, blogs, syllabi, and books, you can create a canon for the next generation.\n\nA Canon List from An Experiment in Criticism\n\nHomer\n\nIliad (c. 8th BCE)\n\nOdyssey (c. 8th BCE)\n\nUnknown, Book of Jonah (8th-4th BCE)\n\nPindar\n\nOlympian Odes (early 5th BCE)\n\nPythian Odes (early 5th BCE)\n\nFragments (early 5th BCE)\n\nAeschylus, The Eumenides (5th BCE)\n\nSophocles, Oedipus Rex (c. 429 BCE)\n\nAristotle, Poetics (335 BCE)\n\nVirgil\n\nThe Georgics (29 BCE)\n\nThe Aeneid (29-19 BCE)\n\nLucian, Vera Historia (2nd)\n\nApuleius, Metamorphoses/The Golden Ass (late 2nd)\n\nUnknown, Beowulf (8th-11th)\n\nUnknown, The Song of Roland (11th-12th)\n\nLaȝamon, Brut (c. 1190-1215)\n\nUnknown, Huon of Bordeaux (c. 1216-1268)\n\nSnorri Sturluson, The Prose Edda (early 13th)\n\nDante, Divine Comedy (1308-20)\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer\n\nThe Canterbury Tales (late 14th)\n\nTroilus and Criseyde (1380s)\n\nUnknown, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (late 14th)\n\nSir Thomas Malory, Le Morte Darthur (1485)\n\nLudovico Ariosto, Orlando Furioso (c. 1516)\n\nArthur Brooke, The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet (1562)\n\nSir Philip Sidney, Arcadia (late 16th)\n\nEdmund Spenser, The Faerie Queene (1590s)\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nRomeo & Juliet (1591-5)\n\nTwelfth Night (1601-2)\n\nThe Winter’s Tale (1611)\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream (1590-7)\n\nHenry V (c. 1599)\n\nJohn Donne, “The Apparition” (early 17th)\n\nMichael Drayton, “The Shepherds Sirena” (1627)\n\nThomas Browne, Urn Burial (1658)\n\nJean Racine\n\nAndromaque (1667)\n\nPhèdre (c. 1677)\n\nJohn Milton\n\nParadise Lost (1667-74)\n\nSamson Agonistes (1671)\n\nAlexander Pope, The Rape of the Lock (1712-4)\n\nJonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels (1726, 1735)\n\nVoltaire\n\n“Micromégas” (1752)\n\nCandide (1759)\n\nSamuel Johnson, The History of Rasselas, Prince of Abissinia (1759)\n\nWilliam Beckford, Vathek, an Arabian Tale (1782)\n\nJames Boswell, Life of Johnson (1791)\n\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798)\n\nWilliam Wordsworth\n\n“Michael” (1800)\n\nThe Excursion (1814)\n\nJane Austen, Pride & Prejudice (1813)\n\nWalter Scott, Guy Mannering (1815)\n\nBenjamin Constant, Adolphe (1816)\n\nJohn Keats, “Ode on a Grecian Urn” (1819)\n\nJames Hogg, The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner (1824)\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley, The Witch of Atlas (1824)\n\nElias Lönnrot, The Kalevala (1835-49)\n\nAlexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo (1844)\n\nCharles Dickens\n\nThe Pickwick Papers (1836)\n\nGreat Expectations (1861)\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, Vanity Fair (1848)\n\nEdward Fitzgerald, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (1859-89)\n\nAnthony Trollope, Barchester Towers (1857)\n\nLeo Tolstoy, War and Peace (1869)\n\nGeorge Eliot, Middlemarch, A Study of Provincial Life (1871-2)\n\nSamuel Butler, Erewhon (1872)\n\nLewis Carroll, “The Hunting of the Snark” (1874-6)\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov (1880)\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson\n\nTreasure Island (1883)\n\nStrange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886)\n\nEdwin Abbott, Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions (1884)\n\nJohn Ruskin, Praeterita (1885)\n\nHenry James, The Turn of the Screw (1898)\n\nH.G.
