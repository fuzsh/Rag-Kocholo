        "text": "MEMORANDUM:\n\nPlaintiffs commenced this action seeking a declaration that General Ordinance 39 of 2007 of the Cityof Syracuse (Ordinance 39) is invalid because defendant Planning Commission of City of Syracuse (Planning Commission) failed to issue a negative declaration pursuant to article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law (State Environmental Quality Review Act [SEQRA] ) with respect to the environmental impact of Ordinance 39 upon the University District in defendant City of Syracuse. Ordinance 39 requires, inter alia, that owner-occupied properties that are sold to an absentee owner must have a certificate of suitability. Pursuant to Ordinance 39, the certificate of suitability will not be issued to an absentee owner if the property does not meet off-street parking regulations. Those regulations are based on the one-to-one ratio of parking spaces to \"potential bedrooms\" and on lot sizes. Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment in part and declared Ordinance 39 invalid based on the failure of defendants to comply with SEQRA. We affirm."
