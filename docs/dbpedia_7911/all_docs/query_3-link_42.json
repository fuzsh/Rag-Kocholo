        "text": "A collection of some of the best stories ever written, whether in verse or in prose. Not to Speak of the Dog is an anthology that shows the many different ways in which poets tell stories. It includes both English and foreign poems, and poets from the past are placed side by side with our contemporaries, as having a shared interest in the business of presenting tales with the greatest impact and memorability, whether their treatment of them be tragic or anecdotal, serious or amusing, dramatic or mysterious. Not to Speak of the Dog continues a concern with the constraints and liberties of the poem, which Christopher Reid investigated in his previous anthology Sounds Good: 101 Poems to be Heard."
