        "text": "Syracuse, N.Y. (NCC News) — While the best in the world are competing for Olympic medals, young Syracuse skateboarders are getting their chance to envision their future Olympic careers.\n\nSkateboarding made a return to the Paris Olympics this summer for the second time in history. Jascen Kutnik, an instructor at Black Mamba Skate Park, says that skateboarding being in the Olympics has given new meaning to the sport.\n\n“It’s changed people’s perception on skateboarding a lot,” Kutnik said. “Because it’s make, like contest skating, a lot more serious. Because big companies like Nike and Adidas are more willing to put money into skateboarding. Because there is that, final goal.”\n\nOne skater, nine-year-old Miles Carlson, says skateboarding has taught him more than just cool tricks, but determination and compassion for others.\n\n“When you skateboard, you gotta like, think for yourself,” Carlson said. “And when someone’s still learning, you gotta help them and stuff, and you gotta be kind when they fall and stuff.”\n\nNine-year-old Sevolod “Sev” Erickson says his eyes have been locked on the TV screen, picturing himself in the games.\n\n“It’s really cool,” Erickson said. “Because I keep thinking like, if I can, if I get better and keep doing the tricks, then I can do that someday.”\n\nThe men’s park finals are August 7 at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The women’s park finals ended with Australia’s Arisa Trew took gold and Tokyo gold medalist Sky Brown (Great Britian) won bronze."
