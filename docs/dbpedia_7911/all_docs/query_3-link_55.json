The archives will remain available here; for new stories, head over to Vox.com, where our staff is covering consumer culture for The Goods by Vox. You can also see what we’re up to by signing up here.\n\nWelcome to Racked SF's search for San Francisco's hottest trainer. Over the coming weeks, we'll profile sixteen smoking hot candidates who work at local gyms and studios. Then, once you've gotten to know everyone, we'll host a March Madness-style showdown in which you get to vote for your favorite. Let the games begin!\n\nChris Reid is one tall drink of water. And at 6'9\" he's also the tallest contestant for this year's Racked SF Hottest Trainer competition. The Barry's Bootcamp trainer is a former Division 1 basketball player who now uses that competitive spirit to train others—and to keep that body looking tight, of course. He's just the guy you want on your team because he'll encourage you to work your hardest and cheer you on to your goals, all with a handsome smile and a nice, hearty laugh. And as if that's not enough, a quick glance at his rippling muscles will get you through those last sets of sprints and squats, no problem.\n\nIn one line, tell us about yourself.\n\nAfter college basketball, I transitioned to earning my personal training certification which led me to Crunch Fitness—and if it wasn't for Crunch I wouldn't have found Barry's.\n\nWhy did you become a trainer?\n\nI was always fixated on being in peak shape and keeping my performance at a Division 1 level. It's a mindset that I've always had—that of a competitor. When I finished college, I was lost and slowly went down another path and I wasn't happy. It took me hiring a personal trainer to change my life around and to make me feel content and happy. Carlos, my trainer, inspired me to take on this field and I found a passion, a strength, a sort of power—relating with people on this very personal side and trying to use that to change lives. So Carlos inspired me to be where I am now.\n\nWhat advice would you offer to someone who is just starting in your class?\n\nBe patient, don't get frustrated, communicate, and have fun and be enthusiastic.\n\nTell us one fun fact about yourself.\n\nI'm fluent in American Sign Language. And I come from a big, loud, obnoxious, entertaining Greek family. If you've ever seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding, that is my Greek family in a nutshell.\n\nIf you weren't a trainer what would you be?"
