        "text": "Are poets funny? It’s hard enough to know whether poets are allowed to be funny through their work. But funny in their lives? Aren’t they supposed to be tragic figures who feel the intensity of the world’s pain, to the point of unamusing mania?\n\nA meeting with Christopher Reid makes these questions trickier. When we meet, he looks up at me over his spectacles and I remember that this is a man who has edited Faber’s poetry list, and so been a formidable tastemaker; and then I worry that I’m wasting his time as we pad around the South Bank looking for a quietish place to talk. He is also a poet who is now best known for A Scattering, which was the Costa Book of the Year in 2009: it is a sequence of poems that commemorates Reid’s late wife, Lucinda Gane, who died of cancer in 2005.\n\nAnd yet we’re here to talk about Six Bad Poets, which he calls a jeu d’esprit. It’s fun to read, and fun to talk about: if David Lodge were a poet, you’d hope he would come up with this. The book is a novella-length poem about six self-regarding, opportunistic poets shuffling between Soho and Hampstead while making each other’s lives difficult. The structure calls for fiendish cleverness on the part of the poet, but Reid has relished the challenge. “I knew it would be hard work, and that was the fun of it. I set myself a very unlikely to succeed project and then simply went at it with maximum intensity.”\n\nIt’s the opposite experience for the reader, though. Almost everyone reads it in a single sitting, and the plot whooshes you along. Talking about the characters with Reid feels like gossip, and even though you can imagine his cast crawling into The Pillars of Hercules after a boozy book launch, none of them is recognisably based on a real poet.\n\nThe idea of linking them in a narrative had occurred to Reid 15 years ago: “I only had the six characters, and they were all pretty well fully formed in my head, so it was simply a matter of aiming them at each other and seeing what happened when they coincided and collided.”\n\nThroughout our conversation, he looks wryly at the Dictaphone and cautions me against spoilers. It’s when we talk about the structure, and the ending (which I won’t reveal) that more serious considerations emerge. The form of Six Bad Poets is so tight the denouement has to come on cue. “I absolutely knew that once I’d done six sections in six chapters, it had to come to an end. It was a matter of applying the brakes in a particular kind of way.”\n\nBut when he reflects on the way A Scattering came together, it’s a different matter. “When I wrote the first section, which I wrote when Lucinda was still alive, I had no idea of what was going to follow. I just wrote that to tell her what I felt about her predicament.\n\n“And then she died, and then it became obvious I had to write more… I’d seen a remarkable thing – her bravery in the face of death, and that was something that needed celebrating.” The harmony of the collection’s close came as if by chance: the last word is “blessing” and the first is “Blessed”.\n\nIn fact, Six Bad Poets is an exception in Reid’s work, and he has no plans to make a habit of tying up loose ends. “Since A Scattering, in everything I’ve written – and it’ll happen again – the subject of when you get close to it, a loved one’s death is bound to be endless, because it’s never resolved,” he says.\n\nBut the matter still isn’t as simple as saying, there’s a funny Christopher Reid who satirises literati and another one who is unlikely to crack a smile. I ask him about a remarkable narrative poem that came between A Scattering and Six Bad Poets. It’s called “Professor Winterthorn’s Journey”, in which a scholar crashes a conference convened to discuss Nonsense, and recalls his late wife with a mixture of mourning and remorse.\n\nAt first he answers with a joshing, “poor old Professor Winterthorn”, and I feel lame for having taken the character too seriously, or autobiographically. But Reid is clear about how unclear this is: “What I wanted to do was to allow that kind of pathos or even tragic depth to an essentially comic character. I don’t see why clowns shouldn’t be allowed their grief as well.”\n\nReid is a funny poet. He makes fun of his characters; he gives them good jokes, too. And he has a keen sense of when to take himself seriously, and when not. He is really funny about his adventures as a creative writing professor, although I’m left thinking that it was probably not such fun at the time. He looks back on his time as Faber’s poetry editor with a feeling of satisfaction, but is as sure that his decision to leave while he was still doing good work was wise: “I’ve never regretted it. It seemed like the right thing to do just then. I never wanted to be the grumpy old fart shuffling about the office with people saying, 'What does he do exactly?’”\n\nIt was a move prompted by a fax from Ted Hughes (whose letters Reid edited) 10 days before he died. It quoted Goethe: “Unless you give yourself wholeheartedly to a project, nothing will come of it. The moment you do give yourself wholeheartedly to a project, Providence will step in and help you.” So it’s reassuring to know that when he gave himself to Six Bad Poets, it was with “maximum intensity”, and that such a serious effort was in the name of great fun."
