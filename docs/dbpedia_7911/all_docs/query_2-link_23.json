At the time of his first surgery, Chris was legally blind. Dr. Dougherty used ICL (Implantable Contact Lens) surgery to implant a lens to correct his vision. Through our continued relationship with Chris, Dr. Dougherty was his first call when he began to experience vision issues because of Cataracts.\n\nDr. Dougherty was able to restore Chris’s vision with the latest and greatest technology and techniques.\n\nThis week Chris visited Dougherty Laser Vision to have laser assisted cataract surgery. Dr. Dougherty recommended that Chris utilize some of the latest and safest technology for cataract surgery patients. Dr. Dougherty performed Laser Assisted Dropless Cataract Surgery and implanted a top of the line accommodating Softec HD lens. Just as in 2008, Dr. Dougherty was able to restore Chris’s vision with the latest and greatest technology and techniques.\n\nClick to learn more about Laser Cataract Surgery.\n\nWatch Chris’s first procedure with us in 2008"
