        "text": "Recently, I was fortunate to lead a #branding exercise at #NASA, a rare treat that I'm excited to finally share. As one of the leads on the advanced pressure garment team at Johnson Space Center, I saw an opportunity to create a brand identity for our team which we could use both internal to NASA, as well as externally - in presentations, at conferences, or in tandem with public outreach (side note: did you know that one of NASA's stated missions is to \"inspire the world\"?) There is a long tradition of patch designs at NASA, owning to the rich history of patches and insignia in the United States military before it. While I wanted our team's brand identity to be firmly rooted in that tradition, I also wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to adopt a slightly less serious tone, given that we are a relatively small team. I also know that a space suit can be a very potent outreach mechanism - able to easily connect with people due to its relatability, while also evoking a sense of enhancing human performance. But specifically, I wanted the suit to have a sense of motion and visceral impact with the surface, further emphasizing our team's connection with advancing human exploration of space. I had an idea, and a vision for what it might look like, but I'm not a branding expert and I'm definitely not an artist. After some initial concepts, I consulted with Caleb Heisey at Good Bones Studio. They were instrumental in bringing my immature idea to fruition, and I couldn't be happier with the final result! Here's where we landed! ðŸ‘¨ðŸš€ An astronaut is bounding from Earth, impacting the moon as a jumping point to Mars. ðŸ‘¨ðŸš€ We adopted a comic book/superhero aesthetic and created a sense of motion using the boot's impact on the Lunar surface, and the exaggerated glove breaking the border. ðŸ‘¨ðŸš€ The colorway is distinctly American with nods to previous suit insignias, like the EVA patch - a design I truly appreciate that has survived the test of time. And, we leveraged imagery like the NASA meatball and the American flag to further connect our team with the greater NASA mission. It was an amazing experience, and while I appreciated the opportunity to do something new and interesting that benefited my team, it was also a reminder that space is truly for everyone. The talented artists and storytellers that help us connect with the public are instrumental in sharing our vision and inspiration with the world. A huge shout out to everyone who helped make this idea a reality! Good Bones Studio has featured us as a design case, as well! Check it out! âž¡ https://lnkd.in/gHsJwZ97 â¬…"
