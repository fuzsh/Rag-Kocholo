        "text": "9 days ago I held my mom's hand as she passed away at the age of 68. After years of battling over 16 chronic illnesses — the pain and the suffering became too much to handle and she opted to take the final control back and use MAID (medically assisted death). The whole process of MAID is a rollercoaster — you don't want your loved one to suffer and endure the pain they're facing, but the only way for them to be let go from it all, is for them to leave you forever. Below the sadness and heartbreak, I also carry an abundance of gratitude and love. I'm grateful that we were able to have my moms celebration of life WITH her — 100+ friends and family came out to share memories, laughs and of course, a few tears. The people who she touched, got to say their goodbyes and give that final hug. I'm grateful that we knew her final day and I got to spend time with her and ask every question I wanted to know, watch home videos from when I was a kid and have all the family around to give her so, so much love as she transitioned to the afterlife. I'm so incredibly grateful to our team at Stretch — you gave the time and space needed to share these final days during this incredibly hard time in our family. I'm grateful for the learnings that came over these last weeks as I spoke with mom - At the end of the day, the house, the car, the materialistic shit — doesn't matter. - EXPERIENCES with PEOPLE are what mattered — take the trips and make the memories. - Live in the moment — we all think/hope/want to live until we're long and old, but that isn't the case. The only thing we need to live for... is today. - Tap into your inner child — one of my moms core values was to always have fun, to laugh (even at herself), and to play. This gave her enjoyment every single day. - Work is just work — at the end of the day, we don't talk about how many hours we worked, the targets/KPIs met or missed, the positions you busted your ass for working up the corporate ladder. But what we do remember is how certain colleagues and co-workers became friends and how they made you feel. During her last few weeks, I asked my mom if I could document her journey to medically assisted death — and she agreed. Looking back, I think it was a way for me to look at the situation through a different lens (no pun intended) and to try and make sense of a situation that I've never been through with death (and with not a lot of information available, due to the newness of this in Canada). Mom gave me permission to share this story — to help others that are suffering and to give insight into the whole process of making this decision. If anyone knows of where there might be film grants, or if there's anyone else who would like to work on a film like this — please reach out. I love you and miss you mom, -- Chris"
