        "text": "TOP RATED BOOKS OF 2020\n\nThe top rated books list is a mixture of different genres, including books written in Chinese and translated books. They are the books that got the highest ratings from the community but were not necessarily published in 2020. In fact, some of these books were published quite a long time ago. This is the most interesting list on the report, in my opinion, so let's dive more into it.\n\nThere're still many sub-lists on the reading report about individual genres, you can find the full list here.\n\nLooking at popular books in the communities speaking different languages is very interesting to me, especially looking at the books translated into Chinese, some of them not even have an English translation yet. That means there're differences or time lags on picking which books to translate into different languages. Also, it depends on how wide the audiences of certain languages are, and it is related to how many people are learning the languages in China. This leads to a deeper question of language educations in China, especially in the higher education institutes. Not many people are studying other languages besides English, and Japanese and Korean study is getting popular in recent years, but for other languages, how we have people who studied them to search for good books to translate? The question is getting larger and larger, and the answer will be complicated.\n\nNonetheless, it's a great privilege for us to have so many resources in both the Chinese and English reading community, so we have to seize the opportunities!\n\nHappy reading =)"
