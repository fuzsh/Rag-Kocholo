As for my hobbies, I would like to listen to crosstalk in my free time, and I also ski during holidays. When working, I am relatively calm and responsible. In my spare time, I can also integrate well with my classmates and play various jokes with them. And have certain leadership and Organizational communication ability. I am quite optimistic and always approach difficulties or setbacks with a positive attitude. I hope to get along well with my classmates and learn biology together in the upcoming igem competition days.\n\nZhang Boxuan\n\nHi guys, my name is Zhang Boxuan and you can call me Jim Zhang in English. I'm presently in grade 10th and going to be an senior next year. I was seeking for a chance to experience an academical experiment during my high school life and attending the wet team of Igem competition gave me a chance. While in school, my main subject was physics and chemistry for the last two years, which gave me a hard time of understanding the subject we are concentrating on. In order to play a better role in the team, I learnt biology by myself which highly improved the diversity of my science knowledge. The experiments we did also gave me an extraordinary experience to my high school life. Furthermore, while doing experiments, I also tried to play the role as a leader in my team, which gave me a valuable experience of leading a scientific team and the confidence to be a leader in a team. I believe that the processes we are making are excellent and the product we are producing would also work well in the market. The team P-DENV would pass all the hardship and difficulties then achieve success.\n\nWang Jingxi\n\nHi, my name is Wang Jingxi and my English name is Alexis. I am a 10th grader from Emma Willard School in Troy, NY. I have a golden retriever. He is almost 7 years old. My family and I love to take him out to hike and hang out with his friends. I like to swim, play tennis, and paint when I am free. Since I am a curious person who wants to explore different fields and navigate myself to prepare for my college life, I like to attend amazing competitions like IGEM. I always ended up learning so much more than what I expected. More importantly, each time I get to meet awesome people of similar age as me and improve with them together.\n\nLi Guanxi\n\nMy name is Li Guanxi. I did the foundation programme of IB courses at UWCCSC in the first year of my high school life where I really met my dreams and ambitions. Through the values the school taught to us students, I indeed want to create a Utopia with no exploitation and oppression. All of these I considered to start with “Who am I?” and “How the current world consists of?”. Those questions have been deeply covered in my inner heart and become a catalyst for me to study Chemistry and Physics. In addition, I do care about equality and balance among all nature habits which could achieve my aims. I attend clubs,“THEM”which offers stray animals a better place to live in around the campus and also improves the condition of local animal shelters, also a club of gardening which can provide me an opportunity to get closely to natural life. While I put a lot of attentions on Theology that provides me insights into another way that I can access to the truth of the world.\n\nJia Yuxiang\n\n\"Hello, everyone!

When I'm not buried in my psychology books, you can usually find me engaging in sports. I'm a passionate swimmer and volleyball player, having been a member of my school's volleyball team for three years. I thoroughly enjoy the teamwork and camaraderie that comes with playing as a part of a team and the sense of achievement that stems from working hard and seeing the results on the field. I believe that these experiences have not only made me a better athlete but also a more effective team player in academic settings. Traveling is another passion of mine. I love exploring new destinations, immersing myself in different cultures, and absorbing all the knowledge that comes with such experiences. I view traveling as a journey of learning and self-discovery, much like how I view the iGEM competition. Participation in the iGEM competition has been a significant part of my journey. Acting as a leader for our team, I've had the chance to apply the knowledge I've gained in my academic studies, as well as the teamwork skills I've honed on the volleyball court.

I am 17-year-old. If I were to summarize myself in one word, that would be a surfing-lover. Crawling on the surfboard and waiting for the wave.

Surfing is a sport that sums up all kinds of sensations- excitement, peacefulness, a sense of domination and even anxiety. It enriches me as a person, allowing me to experience life in the most nuanced way, and at the same time provides me opportunities to learn and mature just like this year's IGEM competition.

I have already learned about igem courses in the early stages. In the wet team here, what I am doing is researching the problem of plasmid and DNA recombination, which really interests me. After all, I have not been exposed to similar knowledge content in my previous study and life, and this learning method has shone brightly in my eyes, At the beginning of this experiment, unfamiliar classmates and serious experimental venues made me feel nervous. After all, I had never been exposed to such things before. However, as time passed, the tension gradually dissipated, replaced by the joy of learning knowledge. I believe that in the wet team, I will do well. Even if there are shortcomings and not perfect, I believe everything can be corrected, making me a better myself.\n\nGao Zihan\n\nHi everyone, my name is Gao Zihan. My English name is Jenn.
