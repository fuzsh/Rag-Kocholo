        "text": "I am taking a break from looking back at the best of 2021 to alert you to some great titles coming in 2022 with the three reviews I have in the December 1, 2021 issue and 2 get stars!\n\nSee below for my draft reviews with more appeal information, extra readalikes, and of course, my 3 words! Let's begin...\n\nThe Violence by Delilah S. Dawson\n\nFeb. 2022. 512p. Random, $28 (9780593156629).\n\nFirst published December 1, 2021 (Booklist).\n\nIt's 2025 and America is still healing from the Covid pandemic as a more terrifying virus emerges--The Violence. The infected’s gaze goes as blank as a zombie as they violently kill the closest living thing, and then, just as suddenly, snap out of it. Our guides through this dystopian-horror landscape are three generations of women who have lived with violence and trauma their entire lives: the “perfect” housewife Chelsea, her teenage daughter Ella, and her mother Patricia. With a visceral hook, a fast pace, and a story that provides plenty of action while allowing the characters to propel the plot, Dawson delivers both a realistically, messy portrayal of everyday violence and a highly unsettling, utterly entertaining tome. While Dawson includes an author’s note at the start, making it clear that this is a novel by a survivor for survivors, do not pigeon-hole this engrossing and thought-provoking, story because like the very best science fiction, she applies a slightly askew lens, challenging readers to take a critical look at our current world while simultaneously demanding we all do better. Enthusiastically suggest to readers who enjoyed the table-turning feminism of Alderman’s The Power, the band of survivors theme in St. John Mandel’s Station Eleven, and the emotional journey of LaValle’s The Changeling.\n\nYA Statement: Ella is a compelling and realistically portrayed teen progratognist who speaks honestly and openly about her life, the challenges of coming of age during a pandemic, and the everyday violence inflicted upon her existence. Older teens, especially those who identify as women, will find a lot to enjoy here.\n\nFurther Appeal: This was an honest, gripping, and fascinating portrayal of violence and trauma. No easy explanations or predictably happy endings. This novel uses a near future, speculative pandemic to explore serious issues.\n\nWhat could have been a gimmick-- a virus of violence-- became simply the frame to have a frank and appropriately messy discussion of the choices women make to get by. It takes you just enough outside the box of reality that you can really think and be ready to have an uncomfortable discussion of trauma and domestic violence.\n\nA Psychological - Horror hybrid. And even more brilliantly, it is unsettling because it is also a highly entertaining read. Uncomfortably unsettling. You are \"enjoying\" the reading experience and yet should you?\n\nCharacter driven-- there is action but it is the characters and their journeys thaty drive the story and propels it forward.\n\nThe twist on zombie tropes is fascinating to break down. I had no time in the review above to do more than hint at that appeal, but this is a post-zombie, zombie story. The infected become a zombie for a few moments, wreck havoc, kill, and then snap out of it as if nothing happened. The themes of both living with the consequences of your violent behavior and the need to protect infected loved ones takes on new meaning. I hope zombie fans find this one. It will appeal to them more than they think.\n\nMy only complaint is that Chelsea's husband [David] got 1 chapter. for POV Not necessary, in my opinion. I understand why an editor wanted it there, to show how he knew where a character was, but everyone else figured it out. That is the only flaw here.\n\nSomeone on Goodreads mentioned torture in this book as a limiter-- there is none.\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: band of survivors, high unease, thought provoking\n\nReadalikes: If you could turn the three listed in the above review into one book, The Violence is what you get.\n\nAs I mentioned, zombie readers, especially those who read for the band of survivors, will like this one.\n\nAlso, The Last House on Needless Street by Ward is a completely different reading experience, but the trauma drives both stories and controls the action. Also the character driven plot that is still a pager turner is similar.\n\nFinally, Stephen Graham Jones emailed me out of the blue to tell me I HAD to read this book. Clearly he loved this book. If you like his writing, you will like this one too.\n\nThe Valancourt Book of World Horror Stories Volume 2\n\nEdited by James D. Jenkins & Ryan Cagle\n\nFeb. 2022. 328p. Valancourt, paper, $18.99 (9781954321076).\n\nFirst published December 1, 2021 (Booklist).\n\nBuilding off of the enthusiastic reader and critical success of their first volume, editors Jenkins and Cagle gave themselves an even bigger challenge-- to find more of the world’s best Horror authors but without repeating any countries that were represented in the previous book. The editors also refused to rely on authors whose work was already translated into English, rather they went directly to the source in the author’s home country and language, working diligently to commission quality translations, bringing many of these award-winning and popular authors to an English language audience for the first time. Standout tales in this superior anthology include Chinese author Zhang Yueran’s terrifying but also disquietingly beautiful exploration of body horror, Indrek Hargla, a well known Estonian crime writer's first Horror tale translated into English, and a stunning, intensely unsettling, and uncomfortably topical tale by Poland’s Wojciech Gunia. The extra context prefacing each story, introducing the author, their place in the literary landscape of their country, and the state of Horror there, elevates the entire collection and makes it a not to miss addition. Clearly Horror is thriving across the globe, and there is no longer an excuse to not carry these authors in your collections. Pair this with Jenkins and Cagle’s first volume or Eric Guignard’s A World of Horror.\n\nFurther Appeal: Even better than the first volume and I loved that one [review here]. As the introduction to this second volume states, first volume garnered multiple, major awards nominations, sold out its first run, and has been added to University curriculums.\n\nI wish I could have highlighted every story, but alas, I get around 200 words.\n\nMy favorite was \"The War\" by Wojeiech Gunia from Poland. This story was stunning, intensely unsettling, and uncomfortably topical. I read it twice even though I had more than half the book still to go.\n\nAlso Chinese author Zhang Yueran's lyrical and terrifying, gross and beautiful-- \"Whalebone Spirit.\" It is a perfect read for fans of The Memory Police by Ogawa or Tender is the Flesh by Bazterrica. Like those readalikes I am still thinking about this story.\n\nHaitian author Gary Victor is one I could not fit in my review. \"Lucky Night\" was based on well known Hatian folklore that would be tangential to our \"selling your soul to the devil.\" It was also very political which I loved.\n\nThe most heartbreaking thing about this book is not only that these amazing voices have been silenced because they have not been translated into English before this but also that many of them [it is revealed] had commissioned, at their own cost, English translations of their work in the hopes that someday someone would ask for them. Kudos to Jenkins and Cagle for diligently seeking them out and commissioning quality translations where necessary.\n\nThree Words That Describe This Book: full range of scares, engrossing, translation"
