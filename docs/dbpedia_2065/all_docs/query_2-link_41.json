Congratulations Yueran!\n\nHe plans to study fiscal sociology and comparative- historical sociology. Yueran broke a record in our department history for receiving admissions from all eight top sociology Ph.D programs that he has applied, including Princeton, Chicago, Michigan, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, Berkeley and Northwestern. Yueran has joint an elite group in this yearâ€™s cohort in the country among 12 applicants who received most admission offers. In this group, Yueran also broke the record in several ways: he is the only international student coming from outside of North America, the only non-native English speaker, and the only student who plans to do comparative-historical research."
