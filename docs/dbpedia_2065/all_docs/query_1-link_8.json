Bart Dessein (UGent) gives us a lively insight on Chinese contemporary literature from the 80s till today.\n\nInterview with Zhang Yueran by Veerle de Vos\n\nZhang Yueran talks about her literary work and life as a writer in Beijing with Veerle de Vos. Her novel 虫 Cocoon has recently (2023) been translated into Dutch by Annelous Stiggelbout and published by Prometheus as De spijker and was very well received in Belgium & The Netherlands.\n\nZhang Yueran in Conversation with Hind Eljadid\n\nThe conversation is led by Veerle de Vos and they will talk about their work and life, as women and mothers. They will also talk about what literature means to both writers: is it a necessity? Is there a need to be socially critical? Is there common ground between the writers? Memories and past events determine the future of characters in Zhangs De spijker, but also in Hind Eljadid's Kruimeldief.\n\nNetworking reception & book signing\n\nBuy tickets!"
