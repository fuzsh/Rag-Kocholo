        "text": "This chapter focuses on a group of Chinese Internet actors who have not been the subject of much scholarly attention to date: producers of the Chinese Internet. It examines the role that Chinese Internet industry workers play in relation to potential transformation of both online and offline China, examining how they negotiate the gaze of the allegedly authoritarian state, and how they use the Internet to create meaningful, expressive and resistant spaces. The chapter outlines the difficult working conditions of workers, illuminating the conditions in which acts of worker agency take place, and the difficulties that workers face in their efforts to create alternative online spaces. The paper then discusses the various ways in which workers mobilise their agency, examining how workers respond to interference from the state and the corporation, the various forms of agency, negotiation and resistance that can be traced in the work experiences and how these contribute to creating a new online space which gives voice to diverse classes in China. As well as suggesting that a focus on workers in Internet industries contributes a valuable perspective to exploring the shaping of the new, socio-cultural space of online China, the paper also contributes to debates about worker agency. We argue that the tradition of organising resistance into two categories, collective/organised or individual/routine level is limited, and that a third category of resistance can be identified, at the level of the individual firm or company. Thus we add to existing understandings of types of worker resistance. We also identify other forms of agency, which might be characterised as negotiation or hope, which, in different ways, open up possibilities for online China.\n\nThe study of the Chinese Internet plays a fundamental part in an on-going global discussion on the role of the new media as tools of political change. It is undeniable that the development of the Internet in China is terrific both in terms of infrastructure investment and citizen involvement. Yet, even though this process has already been studied extensively and with varying perspective, several issues regarding its impact on Chinese society remain open. This paper will specifically delve into the conflicting nature of the Internet in China's political context. It will argue that in China, the Internet can favour political change as much as it can assist the authorities in their struggle to maintain the status quo. The argument will be structured in two parts: first, we will outline the “cyber-utopian” discourse in the Chinese context, underlining how the Internet has been perceived as a powerful instrument for political change since the Nineties; second, we will describe the various strategies employed by the Chinese authorities in order to control the Internet, specifically through modes of censorship, manipulation of information and judicial intimidation.\n\nWith the arrest of yet another activist, the airing of yet another public confession, the closure of yet another NGO working for the weak and disenfranchised, and the passing of yet another repressive law, the world has come to view Chinese civil society as if it were on its deathbed. But maybe what is dying is just a dream of civil society with little basis in reality. While we mourn the death of an ideal, it is imperative that we overcome our sorrow to look at the momentous changes that are currently taking place in the realm of Chinese civil society. In this issue, we offer a series of perspectives on these developments.\n\nLabour activism has undergone significant transformation in China over the last decade. Between the mid-2000s and mid-2010s, an increase in labour protests seemed to herald a growing and more self-confident labour movement. A series of high-profile collective actions that took place in the early 2010s brought forward a time of renewed optimism, during which the public debate on Chinese labour came to be dominated by the idea of China’s workers ‘awakening’ and taking their fate into their own hands. Far from the optimism of those years, today the effects of economic slowdown and the tightening of civil society have thrown China’s workers into a state of uncertainty and disorientation, and the Chinese labour movement has once again found itself at an impasse. This issue of Made in China takes a look at the current conjuncture.\n\nIn this issue, we present three distinct perspectives on how the party-state manages and controls Chinese society. First, we consider the role of labour law in China as a vehicle for reinforcing capitalist hegemony. We then look into the limitations of the welfare system in relation to migrant labour. Finally, we challenge some widely-held assumptions about the political nature of land-related social movements in the Chinese countryside. The issue also includes a forum on how precarisation has impacted the Chinese workforce and an article that reflects on the role of poetry as a form of resistance.\n\nIn the last few years, the Chinese labour movement has witnessed significant developments, not only with the occurrence of some of the largest strikes in decades but also the emergence of grave challenges for workers and activists. Made in China is a quarterly newsletter on Chinese labour, civil society, and rights that springs from the belief that this calls for more serious analysis from both scholars and practitioners, as well for a critical engagement with a broader international audience interested in forging international solidarity.
