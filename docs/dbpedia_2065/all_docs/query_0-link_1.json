        "text": "The Cultural Revolution cast a long shadow over Chinese history and a lot of writers have dealt with it in their novels. Zhang Yueran was born later, of course, and therefore didn’t live through this violent era herself, but she and her generation still feel its weight and in Cocoon, a novel that Ian MacEwan has called ‘a beautiful and formidable achievement on the grandest scale’, she illustrates it masterfully.\n\nA young woman in her thirties, Li Jiaqi returns to her native village to care for her ailing grandfather. While there, she seeks out her childhood friend Chen Gong, eighteen years after their last meeting. She is determined to have a long talk, to face the secrets that bind their families together and lay them to rest.\n\nThe two friends recount how their lives have evolved since they were 11, and inevitably their stories are tied to those of their parents and grandparents, exposing the traumas from a past they didn’t experience themselves but which continues to haunt the younger generation as well.\n\nZhang Yueran ingeniously builds up her story and ensures that the reader, along with the main characters, gradually discovers why they drifted apart, the impact the past has had on their lives and the depth of the wounds they have been carrying with them for generations. At the same time, it becomes clear that the story of these two friends mirrors the experience of countless others.\n\nJournalist and China expert Catherine Vuylsteke will talk to Zhang Yueran about the themes she covers in her books. A unique opportunity to meet an internationally respected and acclaimed author from a country we still know too little about."
