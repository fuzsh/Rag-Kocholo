The story we have chosen is 'Binary', translated by our Bai Meigui translation competition judge Jeremy Tiang (who's also translated Zhang's collection Ten Loves, from which 'Binary' is taken, and the novel The Promise Bird).

This story was the fourth in the Read Paper Republic series of weekly Chinese stories in translation. Go to their website to find out more, and read all the stories, and you can also take a look at our July book club for an insight into the project. We also recommend having a look at Jeremy's very interesting translator's note to the story on Read Paper Republic.
