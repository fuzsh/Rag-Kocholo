        "text": "PhD dissertation. The aim of the study is to approach the interplay between socio-political development and the household as a social institution in south Norway in the period c. AD 350–900 through the perspective of cooking technology. Seemingly corresponding with the Early to Late Iron Age transition in the mid-6th century, culinary equipment in iron and soapstone succeeds a long-term focus on ceramics. This transitional period is a central research focus in the study. The transition is pursued from a ground-up and long-term perspective on crafts and culinary practice anchored in detailed analyses of materials and artefacts. Assemblage thinking and the Communities of Practice framework provide valuable perspectives on the emergent qualities of entities, whether it be artefact types or social units. The study establishes a relative chronology for the temporal selection of materials and artefact types, and demonstrates a sliding scale within the operational sequences of a meal: from an emphasis on serving in the Early Iron Age to cooking in the Late Iron Age. Macroscopic analyses and contextual studies of the artefact assemblage contribute to bridge the gap between ceramic, iron and soapstone technology and provide the basis for a new interpretive framework for iron and soapstone cooking equipment. When cooking equipment in iron turned up in the 7th and 8th centuries, it underlined the forging of new identities and connections with north-western Europe and especially central Sweden and the simultaneous development of local particularities. These developments are essential for the emergence of a soapstone industry in the Viking Age. The study further demonstrates that a collective cooking practice became increasingly private events during the Migration Period (c.AD 400-550). Changing the location for cooking, from large cooking-pit sites to private settlement sites, opened up for reorientation and discursive practice in the Merovingian Period as the meal changed character when food surfaced as a resource for leadership and underpinned the house with the hall as a social institution.\n\nThis thesis examines how elite milieus organised their centres c. 200–550 AD in the counties of Hordaland and Rogaland, western Norway. Here, the archaeological material has many indications of elite organisation, which have been widely debated throughout the history of research. Building on insights from previous research, a general model of centre organisation was sketched. In the model, elite milieus, central functions and centre indicators were seen as interrelated components of the centre. Methodologically, centre organisation was approached through centre indicators – status objects and grand buildings – interpreted as being closely related to interaction between elite milieus and to the central functions gathered at centres. Previous work by Myhre and Ringstad identified where the centres in western Norway were located. After critically analysing the methods in their studies, their results were validated. Twelve of the identified centres in the study area were selected for detailed analysis of the local distribution of centre indicators. By using the general model of centre organisation and applying interpretations of the various centre indicators, the contexts for each of the centre localities were individually examined. The data set of all locations was then used to show general trends and variations in the organisation of the western Norwegian centres. The presence of sociopolitical, military, judicial and ritual central functions was identified at the examined centres. These functions were closely associated with the halls, retinues, thing sites and religion mentioned in contemporary or later written sources. Alliance networks between elite milieus at the centres have also been identified, best illustrated by alliances led by the Avaldsnes milieu in the late Roman period and by the Hauge-Tu milieu at Tinghaug in the Migration period. This thesis contributes to a better understanding of how societies were organised in the late Roman and Migration periods, and renews our view of elite milieus and centres. It actualises a large number of western Norwegian centres, connecting these localities to the extensive research discourse on Scandinavian centres. Although the western Norwegian centres have special regional characteristics, sites like Avaldsnes, Hove, Etne, Hafrsfjord and Tinghaug clearly resemble contemporary centres in Scandinavia.\n\nThe present paper deals with a minority of burials in Roman (B-C) and Migration period (D) Norway, namely the ones containing weapons. Its aim is two-folded: 1) to present an overview of this material to non-Norwegian colleagues, and 2) to discuss the significance of the weapon burial rite in its Scandinavian and North European context. Regarding the first, I intend to focus on the chronology, regional distribution and typology of burials with weapons. As for the latter, the emphasis will be on weapon graves as evidence both of the militarisation of barbarian society in general and more specific of warlike relations between the Roman Empire and the northern Germans, particularly the question of Scandinavian auxiliaries in the Roman army."
