It’s a fair question, but there’s a reasonable answer. I have been conducting archaeological research on the last hunters and the first farmers in Scandinavia since 1978, excavating at a number of different places in eastern Denmark. I have spent eight full years in Denmark since 2001 with my Danish wife and daughter. I now live much of the year in Copenhagen. I have traveled substantially in the larger region, visiting archaeological sites and touring different areas. The impressions left by these visits have been powerful, fostering a huge appreciation for the people of the past and their accomplishments. I am writing this book to share some of that Scandinavian prehistory, along with some impressions of the places and objects that have survived. The archaeology of northern Europe provides a perspective on the human experience, of change and development in human society—from the initial colonists some 13,000 years ago through the arrival of the first farmers 6,000 years ago, the upheavals that accompanied the spread of bronze and iron, and the extraordinary diaspora of the Vikings shortly before AD 1000. The prehistory of Scandinavia has witnessed humans adapting to changes in the environment, both natural and cultural, that have fostered what is today a region of innovative technological, social, and political development. For various reasons, many people—including a lot of archaeologists—are unaware of how extraordinary the past of Scandinavia really is. Much of the archaeological literature within Scandinavia is published in the native languages and frequently does not reach a wider audience. The region is often considered to be outside the mainstream of archaeological research, which tends to focus on the earliest, or the monumental, or the first civilizations of the Old and New Worlds. But in fact, the archaeology of Scandinavia is extremely useful for understanding our human past. The occupants of Scandinavia’s prehistory left traces of their presence in many different ways, from the rock art of the Stone Age to the giant stone tombs of the first farmers, the earthen burial mounds that dot the skyline from the Bronze and Iron Ages, and the massive fortifications of the Viking period. It is hard to travel in Scandinavia without seeing the evidence of that past. Moreover, archaeologists have been working here for 200 years to expose the remains, catalog the finds, display the evidence, and inform the public. Archaeology is a popular topic in museums, schools, magazines, on television, the Internet, and other outlets. There are some 80 local museums in Denmark alone that provide access to the remnants of the past.\n\nxv\n\nx vi P reface\n\nThe book will cover a period from approximately 13,000 BC to AD 1050 in a few hundred pages. I have chosen to divide this volume into chapters that follow the basic chronology of Scandinavian prehistory from the oldest Stone Age to the Viking period. I will introduce each of these periods at the beginning of the appropriate chapter and provide an overview of the context and events of the time. Any archaeological story has to contain a good bit of detail on the position of these places and things in time and space. My goal is to keep discussion of those sometimes dry facts brief and to spend more ink on the actual archaeological evidence. I have had to be selective in the choice of places and things to discuss. I have chosen to focus on what I regard as the most informative and the most spectacular. At the same time, of course, I have had to leave out a great deal. I hope you will enjoy my choices. I took my first academic job at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1974 as an assistant professor of European archaeology. I began doing fieldwork in Denmark in 1978. Some 25 years ago, I married a Danish archaeologist. It is a good arrangement. We have a Danish-American daughter in Copenhagen. Since my retirement in 2009, we live primarily in Denmark. Over the years, I have had a chance to become acquainted with Scandinavian society and to appreciate some of the similarities and differences with my own upbringing in the United States. Scandinavians are in general liberal on most issues, cosmopolitan in taste, demanding in design, frugal, family-focused, socially—rather than individually—oriented, a fascinating combination of old-fashioned morality and postmodern perspectives. Of course there are national rivalries. Danes tell jokes about the Swedes, Swedes tell jokes about the Norwegians, and Norwegians think the others laugh at them. Everyone feels superior. It is as it should be. There are several very good books (a few in English) on the archaeology of Scandinavia or parts thereof—Haakon Shetelig’s 1978 Scandinavian Archaeology, Jørgen Jensen’s 1999 The Prehistory of Denmark and an English translation of his magnificent Danmarks Oldtid (2004) published in 2013, Göran Burenhult (1999) on Arkeologi i Norden, and Anders Hagen’s 1967 Norway. These volumes are, however, largely out of date. A great deal of archaeology has been carried out in the last 25 years in Scandinavia in response to development and new heritage laws. Our knowledge and understanding of almost every period has changed substantially. There are also a number of new methods in place and technologies in action that offer new information about the past. In part, then, I hope to provide an updated view of the prehistory of this fascinating area. I also hope that the perspective of an informed and enthusiastic outsider might offer some new insight and appreciation. The archaeology of Scandinavia is simply remarkable—rich, varied, and in many cases spectacular. I must also admit to bias in my perspective. My own focus has been on Denmark for the last 35 years, and that emphasis comes through in this volume. There are more sites and finds described from Denmark than from elsewhere in Scandinavia. At the same time, I think that many of my Swedish and Norwegian colleagues might even admit that for such a small country, Denmark is blessed with an extraordinarily rich past. There is a reason that the archaeological chronologies and perspectives on the Scandinavia peninsula tend to have a Danish flavor.\n\nP reface x vii\n\nScandinavia technically is Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Finland and Iceland are sometimes added to this group, but will not play a role in this volume. Northernmost Germany and southern Scandinavia, however, share many commonalities in their geography and prehistory, and part of our story includes the areas of Germany that border on the Baltic and North Seas. This book, then, focuses on the archaeology of Scandinavia and more specifically on the prehistory of the region. Prehistory, as defined by archaeologists, is the period of the human past before written records. This volume will just touch on the edges of early history and the first historical documents about Scandinavia in the later Iron Age and Viking period. Scandinavia was basically unoccupied for most of the human past—too remote, too far north, too cold. The region was repeatedly covered by huge sheets of ice over the last two or three million years of the earth’s history. Around 16,000 years ago, this ice began to melt. Within a few millennia, the first people pioneered this new land at the edge of the melting ice, hunting reindeer and leaving few traces. By 6,000 years ago, the first farmers appeared and village life began to rearrange the landscape. By 1,000 years ago, the Vikings had appeared and expanded across much of northwestern Europe and the North Atlantic and conquered large parts of England, Scotland, and northwestern France. There are myriad ways that the large and complex body of information on this early prehistory of Scandinavia could be presented. I will begin the story with a basic introduction to the geography and history of the region and a framework for understanding the past of Scandinavia in time and space. I have chosen to take a rather straightforward route through time in the subsequent chapters, beginning with the first inhabitants, and thereafter tracing the rise of sedentary foragers, the introduction of agriculture and the emergence of village farming communities, and the arrival of bronze and then iron, each associated with substantial changes in human interaction, the structure of society, and the natural environment. The era of the Vikings at the close of the Iron Age marks the end of our story. The Middle Ages follow, with historical archives, the Christian religion, and a way of life that changed little until well into the Industrial Era. Each of the chapters on the archaeology, with one exception, is introduced with a story or anecdote about a particularly characteristic site or aspect of the period. In c­ hapter 5 I take the liberty of expressing some outrage at commercial trade in antiquities. Each of these chapters has an introduction to the important characteristics of the period. The chapters concentrate on the major archaeological places and things that hallmark these “ages” and inform us about life in the past. Focus is on the significant changes in human behavior and society that took place on this long journey through time. These chapters conclude with a summary of those changes and their consequences, along with a discussion of some of the lessons learned and questions that remain from these slices of the past. Along the way, the achievements in design, construction, interaction, belief systems, and survival should hold your attention. It is a remarkable story. While the focus of this volume is on Scandinavia, what has been learned there has implications across a much broader set of archaeological questions: how do humans colonize new regions, how do hunter-gatherers adapt to difficult environments, how do humans cope with dramatic changes in climate and environment,\n\nx viii P reface\n\nhow important was the sea for hunter-gatherers, why did foragers become farmers, what were the consequences of farming, how did hierarchical social relationships develop, how did early states operate? Insight on these questions in Scandinavia sheds light elsewhere in the prehistoric world. Through these chapters, through these time periods, there are changes in the evidence available. Earlier periods are less visible archaeologically and more difficult to understand. The discussion is more impressionistic and generalized, and details are difficult to fill in. There are fewer sites described, and the themes are rather generic—diet, settlement, art. In more recent periods, more objects have survived, the information is better and more nuanced, interpretation is multifold, and important sites are both numerous and spectacular. The themes of life and society are more specific, with greater resolution. Important individuals can be identified. Politics, inequality, foreign relations come into focus. Large and powerful political entities leave lasting evidence of their existence, as does the human modification of the landscape. A short note on language. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are more or less mutually intelligible members of the North Germanic language family. The written versions of the languages vary some, as does pronunciation. All three alphabets have 29 letters. Danish and Norwegian use æ, ø, and å as additional vowels, and these letters are listed at the end in alphabetized lists (although not in this volume). Swedish uses å, ä, and ö, in that order, at the end of the alphabet. Norwegian actually has two official written forms, Bokmål and Nynorsk. The vast majority of Norwegians use Bokmål. There is also the ancient Runic writing system that came into occasional use in Scandinavia after AD 150, prior to the adoption of the Latin alphabet that arrived with Christianity after AD 1000. More on this in the chapter on the Iron Age. The Scandinavian spellings are used throughout this volume for the names of people, places, and things, with a few exceptions like familiar country and city names. The chronology of events in the prehistory of Scandinavia is based largely on radiocarbon dating. Calendar years BC, calculated from radiocarbon years, will be used throughout this book. I find the presentation of a range of years for a single date (the current convention in archaeology) to be rather confusing and will instead provide a single average calendar date from the middle of the range where appropriate. Archaeology is a very visual field—things, places, landscapes, maps, photographs, drawings, and graphs are a major part of the archives of fieldwork and follow-up investigations. The illustrations in this book are intended to convey this aspect of archaeology and to provide the reader with a sense of the nature, complexity, and beauty of the remains of the past. This volume is heavily illustrated for that reason. A picture is worth much more than a thousand words and leaves a deeper impression than a lengthy narrative. I think these illustrations are a very important part of the book’s message, and I hope you will enjoy them. There are several artist’s reconstructions of archaeological scenes in the volume, identified as such. These are intended to be thought-provoking and are not always accurate representations of the past. I have tried to write in a style that would flow and hold the interest of the reader. For most of my life I have written in an academic mode that tends to be\n\nP reface xix\n\nrather formalized and stilted, requiring extensive documentation of argument and evidence. It is also rather dry and boring. In this book I have tried to write with some flow and less interruption, but I cannot completely avoid the demands of academe. This is perhaps most visible in citation—parenthetical authors’ names and years of publication that refer the reader to a list of publications in the bibliography. I have tried to limit the number of citations to the more essential, while at the same time providing a bibliography for each chapter that includes a number of references not necessarily cited in the text, but useful for learning more about the subjects that have been discussed. Almost any project such as this is the product of friends, colleagues, specialists, museums, libraries, and universities, as well as professional editors and publishers. This volume has been a number of years in concept, research, and development and is the result of the efforts of many people and institutions. There are a great many people to thank for their help. I have tried to list all of these individuals below and regret any names I may have omitted. Per Poulsen, excavator extraordinaire at the National Museum of Denmark, has been a good friend for many years.

Douglas Price Akademiet, Copenhagen\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nPLACE, TIME, AND ARCHAEOLOGY\n\nA\n\nlthough occupied only briefly in the long span of world prehistory, Scandinavia is an extraordinary laboratory for the investigation of past human societies. The area was essentially unoccupied until the end of the last Ice Age, when the melting of huge ice sheets left behind a fresh, barren land. That surface was gradually infiltrated by vegetation, then entered by animals, and eventually occupied by people sometime after 13,000 BC. The first human arrivals were hunters of large game, primarily reindeer. As the climate warmed and the environment improved, these groups shifted to a more varied diet that included both plants and animals. As sea levels rose with the warming temperatures and melting ice, these hunter-gatherer folk turned to marine resources for a larger part of their diet. Co-residential human groups became larger and more sedentary. Cemeteries became part of the landscape. By 4000 BC, the first domesticated plants and animals came into northern Europe as cultivation and herding were added to subsistence activities. The arrival of agriculture brought monumental changes. A variety of new social, economic, and religious practices were adopted along with new foods. Farms expanded at the expense of the forest, and a human landscape of houses, fields, trails, tombs, and earthworks became visible across the landscape. By 2000 BC, the fundamental components of farming in northern Europe had been established, destined to continue well into the Industrial Age. Copper was introduced in northern Europe with the arrival of the first farmers; bronze, requiring higher temperatures for smelting, came into use after 3000 BC. Bronze was used primarily for weapons and jewelry. Along with these new metals, the Bronze Age brought pan-continental trade, greater social inequality, and more warfare as wealth increased in the hands of fewer individuals. The social, economic, and political trends that began in the Late Neolithic and Bronze Age continued into the Iron Age, after 500 BC, at a greater pace and larger scale. Ores were widely available in Scandinavia, and iron quickly became the preferred material for many kinds of tools and equipment in addition to weapons. During the first millennium AD, Iron Age societies grew in size and influence, with larger and more powerful political entities emerging across the region. Settlements grew in size. Although the Roman legions never entered Scandinavia, the impact of Rome on northern Europe was substantial. The first towns appeared. By AD 750, Scandinavian marauders appeared along the east coast of Britain, beginning a period of expansion and colonization outside the homeland that\n\n1\n\n2 A ncient S candina v ia\n\ndefined the extraordinary events of the Viking Age. Christianity, historical documents, and the Middle Ages came to Scandinavia around AD 1050, essentially ending the prehistoric period and the coverage of this volume.\n\nORGA N I Z ATI O N O F T H E B O O K This book is about the prehistory of Scandinavia, from the first inhabitants to their Viking descendants. Scandinavia in this study includes the modern countries of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway (Figure 1.1). The Scandinavian Peninsula per se includes only Sweden and Norway. This first chapter is intended to provide some frameworks for understanding the prehistory of Scandinavia, concentrating on place, time, and archaeology. The subsequent chapters are organized by the major archeological divisions of the time between the arrival of the first inhabitants, sometime after 13,000 BC, and the end of the Viking period, ca. AD 1050. Chapter 2 concerns the end of the Pleistocene—the Paleolithic—and the arrival of the reindeer hunters following the melting of the continental ice sheet across Northern Europe. Chapter 3 focuses on the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, and the emergence of sedentary foragers along the coasts of Scandinavia. Because the Neolithic (New Stone Age) is such an important time in Scandinavia, there are two chapters for this period; c­ hapter 4 concerns the early Neolithic and the introduction of agriculture, while c­ hapter 5 follows the story of the consequences of the shift to farming in the Middle and Late Neolithic. The sixth chapter, on the Bronze Age, deals with the introduction of this new metal and the major changes in mobility, trade, and social organization that took place at that time. The seventh chapter focuses on the Iron Age and developments between 500 BC and AD 750, including the impact of the Roman Empire. Larger and more power political units characterize most of southern Scandinavia in the Iron Age, and major centers emerge as the focal points of economic and ideological power. The Vikings, at home and abroad, are the topic of ­chapter 8, which documents the rise of powerful states in the region and their impact on other societies across large parts of Europe. A final chapter contains a brief review of the prehistory of Scandinavia and considers some of the lessons of that past in the larger context of human society. It is also important to state here at the outset that most of the book deals with southern Scandinavia (Figure 1.1). North of the limits of cultivation, there are simply fewer changes taking place, smaller numbers of sites, and less spectacular archaeological remains. Most of the major developments that took place in Scandinavia happened in the south. It is also important to remember that our knowledge of the past increases as we come closer to the present. Preservation is better, and there were more people, more sites, and more materials surviving to the present. We know much more about the later Iron Age and Viking periods, for example. Each of the following chapters (save the last) begins with a story, an anecdote from the past, a distinctly characteristic find or place that tells us about that time. The focus of the chapters changes through time. The Paleolithic chapter emphasizes the various archaeological cultures that have been identified in Scandinavia in this earliest period of human presence. The chapter on the Mesolithic highlights\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 3\n\nthe regional differences that emerge across the region in the period following the close of the ice ages. There was relatively little human modification of the landscape until the Neolithic, when large stone tombs were erected across most of southern Scandinavia. The Bronze Age was dominated by the acquisition of power and wealth, displayed in tombs and hoards. Politics became a part of social interaction. Landscape changes in the Iron Age and Viking periods were pronounced as farms and fields filled the countryside; villages and eventually towns became a new form of community. Major earthworks were raised in many parts of southern Scandinavia. Warfare and conflict are documented in many ways, including fortifications and weapons offerings. The Viking achievements involved the formation of a state, conquest of parts of Britain, Ireland, and France, the colonization of much of the North Atlantic, and the integration of northern Europe with the rest of the continent. Beginning with the Neolithic, there is substantially more evidence regarding human behavior and activity and more to be said about the themes of past life, such as raw materials and equipment, households and homes, death and burial, beliefs and rites, trade and interaction, and conflict. These themes have varying significance and detail in the different ages. More archaeological sites are described in the later chapters, as more evidence is available. Because not all of the archaeology of the past fits into a structure focused on sites, there is also a section at the end of each chapter which features some of the spectacular artifacts or objects from the period, items that often fall into the category of treasures. A summary of each chapter includes some thoughts on the changes that took place and the consequences of those changes for life in Scandinavia. But for now, I turn to the geography of Scandinavia and the frameworks of time used to characterize the past in this region. This first glimpse provides a general overview of the place in which prehistoric human populations lived. More specific details of the dramatic changes in the environment that took place during and following the close of the Pleistocene are provided in subsequent sections, after a consideration of the periods of archaeological time that have been defined.\n\nSCANDINAV I A TODAY Take a seat at the North Pole, high enough above the earth to look across Europe. The view is dazzling (Figure 1.2). The first third of the continent below you is Scandinavia, incorporating some 814,700 km2 (315,500 square miles, roughly twice the size of the state of California). Note the northern situation. From deep inside the Arctic Circle, it is more than 2,000 km (1,250 miles) south to the border of Germany. It is further from the northern tip of Norway to Copenhagen than it is from Copenhagen to the boot heel of Italy. Surprisingly, the far northeastern corner of Norway lies east of Istanbul.\n\nFigure 1.1. Satellite view of Scandinavia. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and northern Germany surrounded by the Arctic Ocean, North Sea, the Kattegat, and the Baltic. Intriguingly, the snow line in this photo closely matches the limits of cultivation.\n\n4 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nFigure 1.2. Europe viewed from the north. Scandinavia comprises almost one-quarter of the continent.\n\nS\n\nNote the dominant features of this landscape—the seas, the mountains, and the lowlands. The landscape varies from the many mountains of Norway to the rolling forested highlands and rivers of central and northern Sweden and to the lightly undulating moraine landscape of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. The Fennoscandian Shield makes up the mountains and bedrock of the northern 80% of Scandinavia. These ancient deposits date from early in the history of the earth and are heavily eroded. Later tectonic activity during the Paleozoic raised the Caledonian-era mountains of Norway, creating the high relief that characterizes this area today. The bedrock of southern Sweden and Denmark, on the other hand, is much younger, of Mesozoic and Tertiary age, and deeply buried beneath the Pleistocene sediments of several glaciations. Bedrock is almost nowhere exposed across southern Scandinavia, with the exception of a few chalk outcrops and the island of Bornholm in the western Baltic. The differences between the northern three-quarters of Scandinavia and the south are seen in many different ways: in wilderness versus cultivation, in the availability of raw materials, in the preservation of prehistoric organic materials, and in the distribution of archaeologically known groups of people. Today the limits of cultivation mark the boundary between these two very different parts of Scandinavia, defined by a wandering line running from approximately Bergen on the west coast of Norway north of Oslo in the east of the country and including approximately the southern third of Sweden, defined by a border north of Uppsala and Stockholm (Figure 1.1). This boundary extends in a narrow, patchy band up the west coast of Norway because of the warming effects of the Gulf Stream. Some cultivation along the coast is even possible above the Arctic\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 5\n\nCircle. A wilderness of forest and tundra lies north and east of the limits of farming. This region has lain virtually unchanged over the last several thousand years. Southern Scandinavia, to the south of that boundary, is heavily agricultural, with fields of wheat, barley, rape, corn, and sugar beets. The landscape is one of the more domesticated on earth—the opposite of wilderness—manifesting the ordered and serene beauty of a land intensively farmed, pruned, and cultivated for 6,000 years. There are several major aspects of the geography of the region that have been important in the development of human society (Figure 1.3).

These waters have been a preeminent factor influencing the character of the land and the people. The seas are also a major route of communication and transport for the inhabitants and a major part of the Scandinavian outlook. Boats have been in use in this area since the first inhabitants arrived and continue to be of major importance. Scandinavians often win medals in Olympic sailing championships. There are more boats per capita in Scandinavia than elsewhere on earth, a statistic that serves to highlight the importance of the sea in the life of the inhabitants. To understand the landscape of Scandinavia, you must see it from the water. The glaciers left southern Scandinavia without mountains, but rich in a maritime environment. The area is epitomized by coastlines. Most of the population lives on or near the coast, both today and in the past. The sea is a constant in human life. No spot in Denmark is more than 75 km (less than 50 miles) from the sea. The seas also provide important routes of transportation and communication throughout Scandinavia and must be considered in any overview of the subject. There are probably more ferries in Scandinavia than in any other comparable region on earth. The west coast of Sweden and the south coast of Norway are a boater’s paradise, with hundreds of rocky islands and inlets. There are important islands in the Baltic, often at strategic locations along the seaways. Bornholm is a Danish island, situated between the south coast of Sweden and the north coast of Poland. Öland, just off the southwest coast, and Gotland, in the middle of the Baltic 100 km (62 miles) from the mainland, are the two largest islands of the thousands that dot Swedish waters. The Åland Islands of Finland extend toward Sweden as an archipelago across the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia. There are thousands of islands in Scandinavia, many of them uninhabited. Europe lies far to the north on the globe compared to the United States. In fact, a line drawn straight east from New York City crosses the coast of Portugal and runs near Madrid, Rome, and Istanbul. The northern parts of Norway and Sweden lie inside the Arctic Circle. Scandinavia, if moved directly west, would fit nicely inside Hudson Bay in northern Canada. It is the Gulf Stream that makes much of Scandinavia inhabitable, bringing warm waters from the south to ameliorate the climate of Denmark, southern Sweden, and the northern and western Norwegian coast. The climate in Scandinavia today varies from north to south and from west to east. Temperatures and precipitation decline to the north and east. A mild, maritime climate, fashioned by the Gulf Stream, is found to the west and south. Average temperatures in Denmark vary from ca. 0°C (32°F) in the winter to 17°C (62.5°F) in the summer. Average annual precipitation is around 700 mm (27.5″). The interior parts of Norway and Sweden experience a continental climate, with more extreme annual temperatures between −5°C (23°F) and 16°C (61°F) and annual precipitation of ca. 550 mm in Uppsala, for example. To the north, away from the coast, subarctic conditions prevail, with seasonal temperatures averaging between −10°C (14°F) and 12°C (54°F) in places like Tårnaby in inland, northern Sweden, where the annual precipitation is ca. 625 mm (24.5″). Tundra conditions are present in the highlands of the Scandinavia Mountains and in the far north. These mountains also create\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 7\n\na rain shadow to the east, so that northern Sweden and northernmost Norway receive little precipitation. The daily weather in much of Scandinavia is rather unpredictable and cool, with frequent showers in many areas. The rain is usually light, but lasting. Once upon a time, an offbeat candidate was elected to the Danish parliament because he promised better weather. It is always a good idea to travel with a couple of layers of clothing. Southern Scandinavia in the winter is cool and damp, with temperatures around freezing and little or no snow in most years. Long nights and heavy cloud mean short, dark days that lead to melancholy. Summer is often cool, but the long days and light nights offer a reprieve from the less pleasant winter months. In northern Scandinavia, above the Arctic Circle the sun doesn’t set in June. In the south you can read outdoors after 10 PM in midsummer. Geographically, southern Scandinavia forms a distinctive part of the region. This area includes Denmark, southernmost Sweden, the Oslo Fjord area, and the northernmost part of Germany, which belonged to Denmark until the nineteenth century. Southern Scandinavia is different from the north, both today and in the past. This is the lowland zone. Rising from the sandy stretches of the North European Plain, the peninsula of Jylland extends as an entry point from the continent toward the rest of Scandinavia. Denmark and southern Sweden were leveled by the glacial ice, leaving a flat, hummocky topography with narrow, small rivers and numerous bogs and lakes inland. The highest elevation in Denmark is 171 m (560′). The streams draining this area flow quietly into the Baltic and Skagerrak. The name for Sweden in Swedish is Sverige, which literally means the kingdom of the Swedes, the term for some of the people who lived there. Denmark is called Danmark at home and refers to the flat land where the Dani people lived. (There is some question whether Dan refers to the people or a specific individual.) Norway, or Norge, simply refers to the north and the people who live there. The countries of Scandinavia today have distinct regions. Denmark is made up of the peninsula of Jylland and more than 400 islands, mostly in the eastern half of the country. Bridges, causeways, and ferries connect many of these islands to the rest of the country. The two largest and most populous are Fyn and Sjælland. More than half the population of 5.5 million lives on these islands. The capital, Copenhagen, lies on the eastern edge of the eastern island of Sjælland. Götaland is one of the three former “lands” of Sweden and basically defines the southern part of the country (Figure 1.4), including the islands of Öland and Gotland in the Baltic. Middle Sweden is defined largely by the old “land” of Svealand, a broad band which crosses the country east to west 150–200 km to the north of the boundary of Götaland. The capital, Stockholm, lies in the southeast corner of Svealand. Northern Sweden (Norrland) comprises about 60% of the country and is largely mountains and forest. Ninety percent of Sweden’s 9.5 million people live in Svealand and Götaland. Sweden today is divided into named provinces that serve as administrative districts, and their location is useful in understanding the archaeology of the country. Figure 1.4 shows these provinces. The focus in this book is on the central and southern areas, with occasional mention of the northern zone. Norway can be divided into five major regions. The outline of the country resembles a spoon. The handle of the spoon includes Middle Norway (or Trøndelag) and Northern Norway. One province of particular importance in our discussions is\n\n8 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nFinnmark, the northern end of the spoon and Norway’s largest province. The bowl of the spoon contains Western Norway, Southern Norway, and Eastern Norway. The capital, Oslo, lies in the southeastern corner of Eastern Norway at the head of a deep fjord. Most of the almost five million Lappland people in Norway live along the coasts, with the vast majority in the southern Norrbotten third of the country. The word Scandinavia probably derives from the Latin term Skåne (Helle 2003). This word was used in the early centuries Västerbotten AD to identify the southwestern corner of Sweden, today’s province of Skåne, and the Jämtland lands further north that were believed to Ångermanland be part of a large island. The Scandinavian countries share similar social and political agendas today. These social democracies Medelpad Härjedalen have managed to create a governmental Hälsingland system with free education, healthcare, and welfare.

A massive social safety net protects the needy, but may also limit options for some. There is a large group of individuals, including young people, who opt for a government-supported life on the dole. There is also a certain fatalism, a sense that the future is already determined, that no matter what\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 9\n\nyour efforts you can only achieve so much in life. The American dream that hard work will take you far does not seem to resonate in Scandinavia. Another important issue involves the anti-immigrant sentiments that have grown in recent years. More thoughts on some of these matters in the final chapter.\n\nHISTORY IN V E RY B RI EF It is also important to know a bit of the history of Scandinavia to understand the region. The countries of Scandinavia first appeared as larger political entities in the tenth century AD. Harald Bluetooth was celebrated as king of Denmark, Norway, and the southern third of Sweden at Jelling, Denmark, in AD 970. Sovereignty shifted between Denmark and Norway several times until the end of the fourteenth century, when Queen Margaret I established the Kalmar Union of Denmark, Norway, the Faeroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, and parts of Finland and Sweden. In 1520, Christian II of Denmark completed the conquest of Sweden and had himself crowned as ruler. Shortly thereafter, in 1523, Sweden and Finland, led by Gustav Vasa, revolted from the Kalmar Union, breaking ties with Denmark and forming a separate political entity ruled from Stockholm. By 1645, there were two kingdoms in Scandinavia. To the west lay Denmark, including Norway, Iceland, and Schleswig-Holstein. The frontier of Denmark extended to the Elbe River in Germany. To the east, both Sweden and Finland were ruled by the Swedish crown. Following another war and defeat, Denmark ceded Skåne to Sweden at the peace of Roskilde in 1659. In 1814, following the Napoleonic Wars, Denmark was forced to give Norway to Sweden and Helgoland (a small group of islands in the North Sea, ca. 60 km northwest of the mouth of the Elbe) to England. Sweden lost Finland to the Russian tsar. In 1864, Schleswig-Holstein was taken from Denmark after another war with Prussia. Norway was granted autonomy and a constitution on May 17, 1814, but remained in union with Sweden until it became peacefully independent in 1905. Iceland received its independence from Denmark in 1945, and Greenland obtained home rule from the Danes in 1979. This long shared history has resulted in a distinctive homogeneity across Scandinavia, reflected in the term Norden (the North), which refers to the commonality of society, language, expectations, and behavior. Norden includes Finland, Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands. The opening of a bridge across the Øresund connecting Copenhagen and the Swedish province of Skåne in 2000 provided the first fixed link between Sweden and the continent of Europe (through the Great Belt Bridge between Sjælland and Fynen in Denmark). Southern Sweden shares more similarities with Denmark than with the rest of Sweden because of proximity and common history.\n\nSCANDINAV I A I N PRE H I S TORY The prehistory of Scandinavia began more than 13,000 years ago at the end of a long series of ice ages. The region underwent dramatic changes as the climate\n\n10 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nwarmed, sometimes erratically—the seas rose, and plants and animals invaded this new ground. To understand the past of this region, it is essential to have some sense of these changes and their impact on the human inhabitants. This section will cover various aspects of the past in Scandinavia, including the issue of time, how geologists and archaeologists have created frameworks for dividing the past into smaller, more comprehensible units. In addition, there is an introduction to the changes in the land and sea that have taken place over the last 15,000 years or so. As global warming continued in the early part of the postglacial period, a sequence of species of flora and fauna entered the area and established themselves on the landscape. This changing environment of geology, geography, plants and animals, and natural resources provided the context for human adaptation and activity in the prehistory of Scandinavia.\n\nTime: Chronology and Culture\n\nFigure 1.5. Average summer and winter temperatures (°C) in northwestern Europe for the last 12,000 years (Davis et al. 2003).

It is almost impossible for us today to look back even a hundred years and understand the conditions of life. Archaeology is trying to look back thousands of years. It is a demanding task. Because time is so vast and mostly incomprehensible, it is usually divided into more manageable units—minutes, hours, days, months, years are one way to divide time. Time is understood in different ways by different people. The Maya of Middle America had a calendrical system more accurate than the one we use today. Geologists tend to view time as a series of major natural events, and they subdivide the 4.6 billion years of the earth’s existence into units that reflect changes in climate and environment. Archaeologists, on the other hand, tend to think of time in terms of changes in technology and the artifacts that people made—the use of stone, bronze, and iron, for example. Each of these views is useful and important for understanding the past. Climate plays a major role in the geological divisions of the last 15,000 years. The period of concern here involves the two most recent geological epochs in the earth’s history, the Pleistocene and the Holocene. The Pleistocene began almost three million years ago, but it is only the very end of this epoch that witnessed the arrival of humans in Scandinavia. The boundary between the Pleistocene and the Holocene is based on changes in temperature and the melting of glacial ice; geologists have conventionally drawn this boundSummer ary at 9750 BC (International Commission on Stratigraphy 2009). Since the end of the Pleistocene, the earth’s climate has seen gradually warming summer temperatures. Figure 1.5 shows average summer and winter temperatures in northwestern Europe for the last 12,000 years (Davis et al. 2003). Summer temperatures have increased significantly during this period and especially Winter in the last 1,000 years. 6000 4000 2000 0 2000 There are a series of subdivisions at the Years AD/BC end of the Pleistocene and through the\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 11\n\nHolocene that are important for understanding environmental changes in the region. Figure 1.6 is a general chronological framework for the geological and archaeological periods used in this volume. In this chart, time is shown in years BC and AD in the left column. All of the dates used in this volume are given in calendar years BC, usually based on the calibration of radiocarbon measurements. Tree ring dates are also available from some later periods of prehistory. The two major geological epochs of the late Pleistocene and Holocene appear in the next column in Figure 1.6. Subdivisions or periods of the late Pleistocene\n\nFigure 1.6. A simplified chronological chart of geological epochs, climatic phases, and archaeological cultures in southern Scandinavia.

These climatic phases were originally based on environmental studies in Scandinavia that identified changes in vegetation that were assumed to correlate with changes in climate. These phases are known as the Blytt-Sernander sequence, first defined in 1876 (Blytt 1876, Sernander 1908). The Bølling, Older Dryas, Allerød, and Younger Dryas phases were thought to represent a series of warmer and colder episodes at the end of the Pleistocene. Today it is clear that warming was largely continuous until the cold snap of Younger Dryas, which may have resulted from the sudden outpouring of cold meltwaters from the glaciers of North America into the North Atlantic (Broeckner 1989, Condrona and Winsor 2012). Climate during the first part of the Younger Dryas was cold, dry, and windy, with periodic permafrost on the European Plain (Isarin and Bohncke 1999). The coasts of western Sweden and southwest Norway had a subarctic environment with fauna that included seals and polar bears (Berglund 1991). The latter part of the Younger Dryas was generally warmer, and the ice began to melt once more. The end of the Younger Dryas appears to have been very rapid, marking the end of the Pleistocene, with a 7°C increase in annual temperature over a period of roughly 10 years. The major archaeological cultures of southern Scandinavia are shown on the right in Figure 1.6. The Stone Age has three phases, old, middle, and new—the Paleolithic, the Mesolithic and the Neolithic, marked vertically on the chronological chart. By convention, in Scandinavia the older Stone Age refers to both the Paleolithic and Mesolithic, while the younger Stone Age is synonymous with the Neolithic. The older Stone Age is sometimes referred to as the Hunter Stone Age, and the Neolithic as the Farmer Stone Age. In actual years, the Stone Age in Scandinavia lasts from approximately 13,000 to 1700 BC. The Bronze Age is a relatively brief period between the Stone and Iron Ages and dates between 1700 and 500 BC. The Iron Age begins at 500 BC and continues until the emergence of the Vikings ca. AD 750. This archaeological framework is centered on southern Scandinavia. Northern Scandinavia has a somewhat different chronology, because certain changes came more slowly or did not appear at all. For example, agriculture was not possible outside the limits of cultivation, so that a true Neolithic never arrived in most of the north. More details on these events and on the terminology will be provided in subsequent chapters. The chronology of past human activity in northern Europe is known in some depth, based on distinctive changes in artifact styles, radiocarbon dating, pollen analysis, and changes in sea level. In the last 20 years, hundreds of radiocarbon dates have been obtained using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) methods, providing much higher resolution and reliability for these chronologies (e.g., Sjögren and Persson 1996, Persson 1999, Hinz et al. 2012). In addition, corrections for variation in the amount of 14C (carbon-14) in the atmosphere and for marine and freshwater reservoirs have greatly improved the dating process (e.g., Turney et al. 2006). The statistical remodeling of large numbers of dates is also providing higher resolution results (e.g., Whittle et al. 2011). It is important to understand the concept of “archaeological cultures” in a discussion of the prehistory of Scandinavia. Archaeologists don’t directly study people or society. Their evidence is dead, lost, or discarded, and often broken. They study\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 13\n\nthe remains of the activities that have survived to the present from individuals and groups in the past. Those remains found together at archaeological sites constitute a set of artifacts (an assemblage), features, burials, and sometimes architecture that are typical of a particular time, place, and people. Archaeologists use the term archaeological culture for a series of similar assemblages from the same time period and region. The size of the region and the length of time involved vary greatly and tend to be larger the older things are. Archaeologists assume that a cluster of related assemblages in a definable geographic region represents a group of people with shared needs, goals, and beliefs—in other words, a society. In the archaeology of Scandinavia, terms like Ahrensburgian Culture, Ertebølle Culture, Funnel Beaker Culture, and many others are used to describe these distinctive groups of similar material remains. Archaeological cultures are a kind of pseudonym for groups of people, even if the precise size, nature, and structure of such groups remain obscure. It is also important to understand that the archaeology of the various periods of Scandinavia’s past differs considerably. The objects and constructions that were made and what has survived until today vary over time. The kinds of evidence available, and the kinds of things that can be learned from that evidence, change. Through time, the archaeological record grows richer. There are more kinds of artifacts, treasures, features, and structures in the later periods, providing a more detailed and nuanced picture of life and death in the past. The further back we go in prehistory, the more the mists of time cloud the details and allow only broad generalizations about those early ancestors. The Stone Age is just that—stone artifacts dominate the archaeology of this period. The peoples of the Paleolithic were hunters of reindeer and seals who moved around the landscape and colonized the coasts of western Scandinavia. The Paleolithic is almost invisible—a few widely scattered, often deeply buried, stone tools and even less often seen bones and antler. Mesolithic groups lived in small groups along the coasts, utilizing the resources of the sea. Masses of flint artifacts, bones and shells, pits, a few huts and graves are known from this period. The only changes in the landscape during the Mesolithic still visible today are the large piles of oyster and mussel shells and, in the north of Scandinavia, occasional house foundations and rock art. Pottery was added to the mix late in the Mesolithic and became much more common in the Neolithic. Neolithic farmers established farmsteads inland, created pastures and fields for their animals and crops, and buried their dead in monumental stone tombs. Groups of people from the past—households and societies—became more visible as we move toward the present. Stone takes on new roles as polished axes and querns. A few objects of copper began to appear in the early Neolithic, and metal was not uncommon later in the period. More houses and monumental tombs characterized the landscape of the early farmers as well, with tens and sometimes hundreds of bodies in the tombs. Some of these large stone tombs are still in place on the landscape of southern Scandinavia. The Bronze Age is best known for the metal, of course. Bronze Age chiefs were buried in rich mounds with treasures from across Europe. Large timber halls housed these leaders, while scattered small farms held the majority of the populace. Individuals become apparent in these large tombs, and families can sometimes be identified. Pottery and stone continue to be important, but have been given less\n\n14 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nattention by archaeologists. Metal objects are found in large, visible earthen burial mounds, as well as in hoards and offerings hidden in the ground and wetlands. Connections across Europe are witnessed in foreign artifacts and materials that appear in these tombs and hoards. Ancient field systems from this period can be seen today in a few places. Art was carved into smooth rock surfaces across middle and northern Scandinavia. Farming settlements with some rich farms and smaller scattered farmsteads are known, but it is the elite, with their large residences and burial places, who were most visible in this period. The Iron Age brings a new metal, and flint becomes less common on archaeological sites. Large, rich farms and small villages have been excavated. True villages emerge in the Iron Age, along with more powerful political leaders who direct economic, military, and religious activities. Distinct groups or classes can be noted in society—warriors, craftspeople, artists, perhaps shamans, or priests. More changes in the landscape are visible—walls, roads, fortresses, canals, bridges—as well as more large burial mounds and ship graves. The Viking period is the most recent and best known of Scandinavia’s deep preand protohistory. The Vikings are highly visible, recorded in history, a fascinating story of the expansion of people from Scandinavia conquering distant places, colonizing new lands, and exploring much of the European continent. A few buildings, documents, and artifacts of wood, cloth, glass, and other fragile materials still survive from this period. Christianity brings medieval times to Scandinavia, and the rest is history. In the Viking period, towns, magnate estates, and common farms have been found in the archaeological record. A runic form of writing was introduced in the Iron Age, and inscribed rune stones appeared as standing monuments, perhaps the equivalent of legal documents. Scandinavia started to become a dynamic part of European society. With all the discussion of the landscape above, it is important to remember that the sea played a fundamental role in Scandinavia, as both a source of food and a route of movement and communication. Dugout canoes are known from the Mesolithic and Neolithic. In the Bronze and Iron Ages, more sophisticated boats were constructed. Viking ships are famous for their innovative design and seaworthiness. This issue of increasing visibility and detail through time will be apparent in the chapters of this book as we move from the Paleolithic to the Viking period. In the older parts of the past, we have limited information on artifacts, diet, and certain activities. In more recent periods, there is elaborate and well-preserved evidence of individual lives—the bog people, for example—and sophisticated technology, such as the ships of the Iron Age and Viking period. The focus of our story changes through time from cultures to communities to individuals as the details of the economic, social, and ideological aspects of their lives become more visible.\n\nPast Environments: Ice, Land, Sea The effects and consequences of Pleistocene glaciers dominate the land- and seascapes of postglacial northern Europe. This story begins around 110,000 years ago with the onset of the last major cold stage of the Pleistocene, known as the\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 15\n\nLGM, about 20 ka\n\nWeichselian Glaciation. As temperatures dropped, a mass of snow and ice centered on the Gulf of Bothnia began to form, eventually rising more than 2 km (1.2 miles) in height. Its weight caused the frozen mass to spread at the edges. In such a manner, a huge glacier of almost unimaginable proportions expanded horizontally as more snow and ice accumulated. This ice sheet moved across the landscape as much as 150 m (almost 500′) or more per year. In a period of several hundred years, the front of this continental ice sheet moved more than 1,000 km (620 miles) across Norway and Sweden, and by the late Weichselian it covered more than half of Denmark. The ice extended across the Baltic basin and crossed the northern coasts of Germany and Poland. To the east, it covered Finland and much of northwestern Russia. The Late Glacial Maximum (LGM) is the name given to the coldest part of the Weichselian glacial stage, around 20,000 years ago (Figure 1.7). Annual temperatures were 8°–10°C (14°–18°F) colder than today, and the ice sheets reached their furthest extent. Only the western parts of Jylland and the west Norwegian coast were ice-free in Scandinavia. A large part of what is today the North Sea was ice-covered, connecting Jylland with Britain. The weight of this continental ice sheet pushed down the landmass of northern Europe, often to great depths. As an example, the Greenland ice sheet today is more than 3 km (1.9 miles) thick, and the land surface under that ice resembles a very deep bowl, higher at the edges where the ice is thinner. This land under the ice in the interior of Greenland is almost 300 m (almost 1,000′) below present sea level, the lowest spot on earth today. The mass of ice in Scandinavia during the LGM depressed parts of the land surface as much as 600 m (almost 2,000′). The ice began to melt in northern Germany and Denmark after 16,000 years ago. The melting of the ice was rapid, if not constant, during the Late Glacial. Denmark was free of glacial ice by 12,000 BC. Skåne was the first part of Sweden where the ice disappeared by about 11,500 BC, and then the ice mass disappeared across middle Sweden until 9000 BC at a rate of 50 km (approximately 30 miles)\n\nFigure 1.7. The extent of the Late Glacial Maximum ca. 20,000 years ago (Mangerud et al. 2004).\n\n16 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nper century (Björk and Digerfeldt 1982, Larsson 1991). The 59° parallel marks the approximate edge of the ice at the end of the Pleistocene. The melting of the ice in the Preboreal and Boreal was very rapid, with the edge of the ice sheet retreating on the order of 500 m/year (1,640′) in northern Sweden and 300 m/year (almost 1,000′) in southwestern Norway (e.g., Andersen 1980, Nygaard 1989). Most of Sweden and Norway were ice-free after 8,000 years ago. Even today, however, the ice is not completely gone, as the numerous small mountain glaciers in the highlands of Norway attest. Since warming, melting, and the disappearance of the ice sheet, the surface of the land in northern Europe has been rebounding from the removal of that enormous weight. In some areas, particularly in Norway and Sweden, rebound has gone on at a very rapid rate, with significant consequences for archaeology. Mesolithic rock carvings made along the coast of the Oslo fjord some 6,000 years ago are found today more than 150 m (almost 500′) above sea level. Quarries and scatters of quartz artifacts from coastal Mesolithic sites in the Stockholm region are now found at elevations above 70 m (230′). This rebounding process continues. The mass of glacial ice around the globe incorporated a substantial portion of the earth’s water, captured from the oceans. During the time of maximum cold and huge continental ice sheets, sea level was reduced as much as 120 m (almost 400′) or more, completely changing the outlines of the continents and often creating connections between former islands and separate land masses. The coastline of northern Europe was dramatically changed during times of lower sea level. This shrinkage of the sea left large areas of the sea floor around Scandinavia as dry land. Today, the North Sea Basin and the English Channel are relatively shallow, often with water depths of 50 m (165′) or less. Doggerland is the name given to the large piece of the North Sea floor that was dry land. During the LGM, with sea levels much lower than at present, this area would have been part of the European continent, connecting Britain to Belgium, the Netherlands, northern Germany, and Denmark (Figure 2.1). A variety of artifacts from the Late Paleolithic and Mesolithic, left by the early inhabitants on the bottom of the North Sea and Baltic in this now submerged region, have been found in the dredge nets of fishermen (Long et al. 1986, Vang Petersen and Johansen 1996, Verhart 2004). The human presence on Doggerland during the Late Paleolithic was dramatically documented when a fishing vessel dredged up a barbed point made of antler from deep water in the North Sea in the 1930s. This artifact has been radiocarbon-dated to approximately 11,700 BC (Bonsall and Smith 1989). The total area, about the size of the state of California, was submerged by rising seawaters as the late Pleistocene temperatures warmed and sea levels rose. As the ice sheets began to melt, sea level rose through the early Holocene, and Doggerland was gradually submerged beneath the waters of the North Sea. Around 6150 BC, a huge underwater landslide off the coast of Norway triggered a massive tsunami, or tidal wave. This tsunami, with waves estimated to have been 3–10 m (10′–35′) high, would have impacted coastlines throughout the North Sea region and drowned the remaining parts of Doggerland (Gaffney and Smith 2009, Weninger et al. 2008).\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 17 Calendar Years X1000\n\nSea Level (m)\n\n0\n\n10\n\n8\n\n4\n\n6\n\n2\n\nBC/AD\n\n2\n\n−20\n\n−40\n\nBaltic Ice Lake Late glacial Interstadial\n\nAncylus Lake Yoldia Sea Mastogloia Sea Younger Pre- Boreal Dryas boreal\n\nLittorina Sea Atlantic\n\nLimnea Sea Subboreal\n\nA major consequence of increasing temperatures and the melting of the continental ice sheets at the end of the Pleistocene was the return of water to the oceans. This process appears to have accelerated during the early Atlantic episode (Björck 1995). The maximum rate of sea level rise during the Holocene has been estimated as almost 3 cm (more than one inch) per year between 6500 and 6000 BC, i.e., 3 m (10′) per century (Niekus 2006). Rising waters encroached on the lowlands of southern Scandinavia, changing the shape and juxtaposition of these areas. Many of the settlements from the earlier part of the Mesolithic must have been inundated. This situation was reversed in the northern two-thirds of Scandinavia, where land rebound outpaced the rising sea level. Early Holocene sites are found at high elevations in that region today. In one sense there was a very drawn-out race between the rebounding surface of the land and the refilling seas, rising higher and higher against the land. The changes in the Baltic basin (Figure 1.8) neatly document this race (Björck et al. 1998). Initially, melt water from the retreating ice sheet filled the southern Baltic basin with a freshwater lake, dammed by higher ground in the Øresund and the remains of the ice sheet located between Stockholm and Lake Vänern in central Sweden. Rising water in this Baltic Ice Lake began to spill over the Øresund at 10,700 BC and possibly eroded this outlet down to bedrock. However, continuing uplift of the Øresund, due to the removal of the weight of the ice, raised the level of the Baltic Ice Lake to 10 m (35′) above sea level. When the ice sheet receded further north, the Baltic Ice Lake drained to sea level around 9300 BC through an active drainage channel across the Middle Swedish lowlands connecting the west coast and the Baltic (Bergsten and Nordberg 1992). This drainage, lowering the water in the Baltic basin by 25 m, may have been catastrophic in nature (Berglund et al. 2005). The Baltic basin became brackish through this connection to the North Sea. This stage of the Baltic is known as the Yoldia Sea, which lasted for about 900 years.\n\nBaltic Sea Subatlantic\n\nFigure 1.8. Changes in sea level in the southern Baltic Sea for the last 13,000 years (after Uscinowicz 2006). The names in white are stages of the Baltic, which shifted between fresh and salt water in this period. The climatic phases at the bottom of the graph are the conventional divisions of the late Pleistocene and Holocene in northern Europe.\n\n18 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nThe continued rise of the land surface eventually raised the outlet in central Sweden above sea level. Closure of the outlet meant the accumulation of fresh water in the Baltic basin, and the Ancylus Lake gradually filled the basin. After 6500 BC, the rising waters of the North Sea and Kattegat opened a new outlet through the Øresund and Great Belt as southern Sweden separated from Denmark. The brackish waters that formed at that time have been designated the Littorina Sea, which eventually became the present-day Baltic. Postglacial seas reached the present beaches of southern Scandinavia by approximately 4000 BC, a time marked by a series of transgressions and regressions of the sea, in some instances several meters higher than today. Over time, the coasts of Scandinavia had become a place of peninsulas, archipelagos, and islands. Although climate has been generally warm and stable through the Holocene, there have been several cooler episodes. One of the most prominent of these is a short-lived cool, dry, and windy event around 6000 BC, known as the “8.2 ka event” (Alley et al. 1997, Seppa et al. 2009). A more recent episode in the Baltic and North Sea was a cooling event known as the Little Ice Age that lasted from approximately AD 1350 to 1850. The Little Ice Age had a major impact on the Vikings in the North Atlantic and likely hastened the abandonment of the Greenland settlements. More on this story in a later chapter.\n\nPast Environments: Vegetation\n\nFigure 1.9. The barren land remaining after the ice has left. This recent photo is from Greenland.\n\nVegetation is a major component of landscape. Fourteen thousand years ago, the landscape of southern Scandinavia was largely denuded, freshly exposed by the ­melting of glacial ice (Figure 1.9). The ice masses of the Pleistocene acted as enormous bulldozers, grinding down the earth’s surface as they advanced and leaving behind huge blankets of homogenized earth and rock as they disappeared. The undulating layers of sand, gravel, and till that were left are the present topography of southern Scandinavia. To the north, the melting ice exposed the Precambrian shield, patchily covering it in some places with deposits of moraine and gravel. Detailed records of the succession of plants spreading into this new, empty landscape have survived as deposits of pollen in lake and marine sediments (e.g., Iversen 1944, Odgaard 1989). One example of such a pollen record from the Roskilde Fjord in Denmark is shown in Figure 1.10 (Schrøder et al. 2004). The succession of vegetation in southern Scandinavia is well documented in this diagram. The fresh surface was colonized initially by steppe tundra, with a variety of herbaceous vegetation—sedges and grasses, with some dwarf birch. The first arboreal species to migrate into this region were juniper and birch along with aspen, prior to the Younger Dryas. Continued warming was responsible for the expansion of open birch forest with juniper, aspen, and willow across much of the\n\n500 600\n\nch\n\nr\n\nee B\n\nld e\n\nsh\n\nA\n\nA\n\nak O\n\nLi m e\n\nel\n\nEl m\n\naz H\n\nen\n\nPi ne\n\nsp A\n\nirc h\n\nr B\n\nip e Ju n\n\nB C /A D Su nr M o u g se G wor ra t ss W ill ow\n\nge A\n\nD\n\nep\n\nth\n\nin\n\ncm\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 19\n\n−2000 −1000\n\nPERIOD SUBATLANTIC\n\n0 1000\n\n700\n\n2000\n\nSUBBOREAL\n\n3000 800 900 1000 1100\n\n4000\n\nFULL ATLANTIC\n\n5000 6000\n\nE.

The cold snap of the Younger Dryas forced many of those species either to refuges within southern Scandinavia or further south in Central Europe. The Preboreal and Boreal were dominated by birch and pine, which disappeared rapidly at the end of this period. Both summers and winters were likely warmer than today and the climate more maritime (Berglund 2003). Average July temperatures in this early part of the Holocene reached ca. 15°C (59°F), and the warming continued. Elm, oak, alder, lime, hazel, and ash were in place by the beginning of the Atlantic phase. A dense, mixed deciduous forest dominated in this phase as the arctic tree line moved north. One of the striking patterns observed in the pollen diagram in Figure 1.9 is the precipitous decrease in elm pollen at the transition from the Atlantic to the Subboreal phase around 4000 BC. Declines in the numbers of lime trees are also apparent at that time. The cause of this “elm decline” has been the subject of debate since its recognition more than 75 years ago, with either climate change or human interference viewed as the likely culprit. The elm decline was close in time to the arrival of agriculture in southern Scandinavia. Human interference with elm was a popular explanation for many years. Suggestions included tree felling for field clearance and the clipping of elm branches to use for animal fodder, resulting in an absence of pollen. A study by Peglar and Birks (1993) may have resolved this issue. Studies of pollen in deep lake sediments with annual layers in England and Sweden demonstrate that the elm decline actually took place within a very short time, perhaps a decade or two. It is difficult to imagine that human interference could cause the decline of elm over most of northern Europe within a period of 10 to 20 years. Finally, discovery of beetle tunnels in elm wood have confirmed that bark beetles were present at the time of the elm decline. These insects carry the fungus that is responsible for Dutch elm disease. In all probability, the rapid disappearance of elm trees across northern Europe was caused not by climate or humans but by disease.\n\n20\n\n20 40\n\nFigure 1.10. A diagram of the percentages of pollen by species found in deep layers of sediments in the Roskilde Fjord, Denmark (Schrøder et al. 2004). The boundary between the Late Glacial and Preboreal was not clear in this sample and is not shown on the diagram.\n\n20 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nForest composition during the Atlantic and Subboreal climatic episodes was generally similar, with some differences caused by human activity and the decline in elm and lime. Oak and hazel were more abundant in poorer soils and lower areas where the forest was more open (Aaby 1988). Alder was frequent in wet areas with rich soils. Beech became a forest species during the Subboreal phase. More continental conditions prevailed in the Subboreal, with somewhat colder winters and warmer summers. The forest was substantially reduced by human activity during the Subboreal. The cutting of trees for the expansion of field systems and the grazing of herds of domestic animals reduced the extent of the forest and created larger and larger openings for fields and pasture. The story of vegetation succession outlined above applies only to the southern half of Scandinavia. The northerly regions above the limits of cultivation experienced a very different vegetation history. There are two boundaries of particular interest in this region, the limit of cultivation and the tree line. Both boundaries moved substantially following the close of the Pleistocene. The glacial ice retreated across northern Scandinavia and was largely gone after 7000 BC. At Abisko, near the Norwegian border in northern Sweden, pollen studies near the modern tree limit provided a record of vegetation changes in this area (Berglund et al. 1996, Sonesson 1974). Since deglaciation, the vegetation has been dominated by subalpine birch woodland tundra. More temperate conditions prevailed between 3500 and 1500 BC and witnessed a pine-birch forest in the area, with tree growth 100 m (330′) or more higher than present. Cooling conditions after 1500 BC led to an expansion of a nearby glacier and a significant drop in elevation of the tree line.\n\nPast Environments: Animals Animals followed the spread of vegetation across the fresh landscape of Scandinavia after the melting of the ice mass. A pattern of succession is seen in changes from arctic and subarctic species to more temperate climate animals in the environments of northern Europe from the Pleistocene to the Holocene. These changes in mammal species over time are shown in Figure 1.11 (Aaris-Sørensen 2009). The succession of fauna during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene is of critical importance for human hunters of that time. Reindeer arrived in southern Scandinavia, followed immediately by wolves. Seasonal data from the antler indicate that reindeer were resident throughout the year (Larsson 1991). Other large ungulates came quickly, notably the European elk, wild horse, bison, aurochs, giant Irish deer, polar bear, and beaver. Mammoth became extinct in this area and across Europe before the end of the Pleistocene. Continued warming during the Preboreal saw the disappearance of bison and giant deer. The distribution of reindeer and other arctic species was limited to high elevations and latitudes in Scandinavia. New species to the region document the temperate, forested conditions that began to prevail at this time, including wild boar, red deer, roe deer, wild cat, and marten (Bratlund 1996). In essence, large migratory herds of cold-adapted species were replaced by the more territorial and sedentary game animals that are still found across much of Europe today. Faunal evidence indicates that aurochs (wild cattle) and elk (European moose) were predominant during the Preboreal and that red deer (North American elk), wild pig, and roe deer had become the terrestrial animals of major economic importance by\n\n12000 HOLOCENE\n\n4000\n\nAtlantic Cow Pig Sheep/Goat\n\nSubboreal Horse\n\n2000\n\n6000\n\nBoreal\n\nPreboreal\n\nYounger Dryas\n\nEpoch\n\nRngifer tarandus Canis lupus Alces alces Ursus arctos Castor fiber Bos primigenus Bison bonasus Equus ferus Martes martes Felis silvestris Capreolus capreolus Sus scrofa Cervus elaphus Bos domesticus Sus domesticus Ovid lupus Equus ferus caballus\n\nFigure 1.11.

The latter three species were ubiquitous throughout much of Europe in the early Holocene. There are important changes in the distribution of certain species during the Holocene. Bears, elk, and aurochs disappeared from the islands of southern Scandinavia, due to a combination of overhunting and limited carrying capacity on the islands. Aurochs were likely also absent in Sweden by this time. These species remained in Jylland and the rest of continental northern Europe. Red deer on the islands became noticeably smaller in size during the Holocene, likely a consequence of limited food resources on small islands (Foster 1964). The temperate species such as red deer, roe deer, and wild boar are found almost exclusively in the southern half of Scandinavia. European elk continue into central Scandinavia, and reindeer are the primary large-game species in the far north. A variety of small fur-bearing species have also been found at archaeological sites, including marten, otter, squirrel, wildcat, and others. Approximately 55 species of fowl, both aquatic and terrestrial varieties, are known from Holocene sites in northern Europe. The dog was domesticated and present in Scandinavia by the end of the Pleistocene. The introduction of agriculture brought additional species of animals in the form of domestic cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. Domesticated horses appeared by the beginning of the Bronze Age. Following the end of the Pleistocene, the warming waters of the oceans were full of food. Mollusks, crustaceans, fish, and sea mammals were all important resources for coastal-dwelling hunter-gatherers. Although water temperatures in the early postglacial may not have supported a variety of shellfish, their numbers and range expanded greatly through this period. Seals, porpoises, and whales are all found among the fauna at archaeological sites. Many species of fish from a wide range of habitats were taken with a variety of equipment. It is important to remember that the melting of the ice and the expansion of flora and fauna are time-transgressive phenomena. This is perhaps best visualized by a series of bands stretching from north to south, from the ice sheet and its front, across a zone of fresh, raw sediments and rocks to a more distant zone of pioneer herbs and shrubs, and further south zones of birch and pine woodlands. The expansion of these zones to the north took thousands of years and was dependent on changing climatic conditions. During the Younger Dryas, southernmost Sweden and eastern Denmark were tundra, while to the south and west birch woodlands covered western Denmark and pine forests likely extended across central Germany. These contemporary, yet different, environments invoked distinctive human responses.\n\nPast Environments: Resources Although prehistoric Scandinavia was not imbued with a wealth of natural resources, there are several materials that were critically important for tools and trade. These materials provide a part of the spectacular archaeology of the region. The most important of these was flint (Vang Petersen 2008). The chalk bedrock across northern and eastern Denmark and southern Sweden contains large deposits of this raw material, highly valued for the production of stone tools (Figure 1.12). Flint nodules were also scattered from their original sources by the glaciers and\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 23 0\n\n100 km\n\nFigure 1.12. Sources of in situ flint in southern Scandinavia.\n\noccur in some quantity on much of the ground surface and many of the beaches of southern Scandinavia. Stone Age sites in southern Scandinavia are dense with flint artifacts and waste material from the production of stone tools. These flint deposits are particularly important for the production of large polished flint axes, which began to appear in the Neolithic period (e.g., Knarrström 2001). These beautiful axes—once thought to be the tips of thunderbolts thrown by the gods—are found in the tens of thousands across the landscape of southern Scandinavia. Virtually every modern farm has a collection of these polished flint axes—a pertinent and immediate reminder of the past. This flint was also traded long distances across Scandinavia and shows up in huge quantities in central Sweden, on the island of Bornholm, in Norway, and in other places without natural flint sources. Outside southern Scandinavia, good materials for flaked stone tools are rare, and a variety of less desirable materials such as quartz, quartzite, and slate were put to use. The assemblages of fine blades and large flint tools that characterize the Stone Age of southern Scandinavia take on an entirely different appearance when translated into other materials. Other stone, however, such as diabase for ground stone axes and slate for ground stone artifacts, is more common in assemblages in the northern parts of Scandinavia. Sources of soapstone for carved containers and other stones for grinding grain and sharpening tools were important at various times in the prehistory of Scandinavia. Amber, another valuable resource, washes up along the beaches of northern Europe, eroding from deposits on the floor of the Baltic and North Sea. Amber is found in many places along the coasts of southern Scandinavia, but abundantly on\n\n24 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nthe North Sea coast of Jylland. This petrified resin is a beautiful dark yellow, almost golden, in color sparkling with trapped air chambers and debris. The material sometimes floats, holds charges of static electricity, and is the essence of magic. Amber was used throughout most of prehistory. Large decorated pendants and small animal figurines of amber are known from the Mesolithic; thousands of large amber beads and ornaments have been found cached or buried in the Neolithic. Literally tons of amber were exported to the Aegean region in the Bronze Age, funding Bronze Age society in Scandinavia. High-quality animal fur—beaver, marten, wildcat, and other species—may have been another exportable product of the region. Iron ore in the form of what is called bog iron is found across much of the region and provided an important raw material in the Iron Age. Other metal resources in Scandinavia are limited or nonexistent for much of prehistory.\n\nA RCHA EOLO GY I N SC AN DI NAV I A The past of Scandinavia is one of the richest and most detailed in the world for several reasons—a long history of research, extraordinary preservation, exceptional raw materials, and an abiding contemporary interest in the past. The depth of information that is available makes it possible to answer questions that cannot yet be asked in many other places. The visibility of archaeology on the landscape of Scandinavia has played a major role in national identity, in public interest, and as a focus for study in this area for many years. The stark standing stones of the megalithic tombs of the Neolithic are scattered throughout the region, and the distinctive earthen barrows of the Bronze and Iron Age dot the skyline—constant reminders of the ancient past and magnets for the curious. These features certainly piqued the interest of dilettantes in the eighteenth century as collecting antiquities began as a kind of hobby among the elite. The king of Denmark participated in excavations into these barrows in the middle of the nineteenth century. This fascination with the past has continued to grow in Scandinavia and has led to strong public support for archaeology along with a well-informed cadre of amateurs who contribute significantly to knowledge and regularly report new finds to the authorities. The preservation of archaeological materials in northern Europe is sometimes extraordinary, providing an added dimension to the archaeological record. This organic component of the past records many of the more exciting and unusual aspects of human technology and behavior and vividly enriches our perspective. Several factors are responsible for the excellent conditions of preservation that are sometimes encountered. The chalky soils of much of southern Scandinavia are neutral or basic rather than acidic, so that organic materials remain intact for longer periods. Human actions in the past also improved conditions for exceptional preservation, particularly the burial of objects in large earthen mounds and the deposition of artifacts and other objects in bogs and wetlands. The remarkable bog bodies of northern Germany and southern Scandinavia are testimony to the preservative powers of the wetlands. The peat deposits in the bogs have provided fuel\n\nP lace , T ime , and A rchaeology 25\n\nfor heating for centuries. Peat-cutting activities to quarry this fuel have exposed countless bog deposits from the past. Some appreciation of the history of extraordinary research that has taken place is essential for an understanding of Scandinavian prehistory. The term prehistoric was in fact originally coined in Denmark (forhistorisk) in 1834 and published by Christian Molbech (Rowley-Conwy 2006). Scandinavia also played an important role in changing archaeology from the collection of curiosities to a science of culture history (Graslund 1987). The early assembling of antiquities under royal auspices led to the beginnings of museums and the emergence of descriptive systems, bringing classifications and order. An essential figure in the history of Scandinavian archaeology is Ole Worm. Born in Aarhus in 1588, he became the king’s physician and professor of pedagogy at the University of Copenhagen. Worm had a great curiosity about all things, including antiquity. He compiled a six-volume work on the ancient monuments of Denmark, published in 1644. Most importantly, he was a collector who assembled prehistoric artifacts and other objects of natural historical interest from Denmark’s past in his Museum Wormianum (Figure 1.13). This collection was the precursor of the National Museum of Denmark, founded in 1849. Archaeology began in earnest in Scandinavia at the beginning of the nineteenth century following land reforms and major agricultural expansion that led to the destruction of many monuments and the discovery of large numbers of antiquities. In Denmark, for example, archaeology originated under the auspices of the king.\n\nFigure 1.13. Museum Wormianum in Copenhagen ca. AD 1650.\n\n26 A ncient S candina v ia\n\nA Royal Antiquities Commission was established in 1807 to determine the state of the remaining monuments and what could be saved from further destruction. Archaeology was thus established as an independent discipline focused on prehistoric artifacts and monuments (Jensen 1982). In 1816, that same commission appointed Christian Thomsen, a 28-year-old businessman, to organize and display some of the materials that had been recovered. Thomsen thus became the first archaeologist in Denmark. He devised an intuitive, yet effective, system for displaying the artifacts by material of manufacture—stone, bronze, or iron—thus defining the three major ages of European prehistory still in use today (Rowley-Conwy 2007). Thomsen’s book on the three-age system was originally published in 1836 and was translated into English to spread the word in 1848. In 1849, Thomsen "
