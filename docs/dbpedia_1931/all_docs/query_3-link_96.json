        "text": "What's happening on Day 13 at Paris 2024?\n\nThere are a total of 27 gold medal events on Day 13, Thursday 8 August. Here are our top picks of the day:\n\nTeam sports reach exciting end, world record watch\n\nThe men's basketball competition reaches the semi-final stage (5:30pm, 9pm), while the men's football bronze medallists will be decided (5pm) and the men's hockey tournament concludes (2pm, 7pm).\n\nWill the world record fall in men's speed climbing as that competition comes to an end (12:28pm)? Samuel Watson's already lowered his own mark of 4.79s down to 4.75s. But Watson himself posted a training video of him completing the 15m-high wall even quicker than that leading up to the Games. That time could certainly fall again.\n\nAthletics: Lyles, McLaughlin-Levrone, Chopra in action\n\nNoah Lyles will aim to complete the second leg of a potential treble on 8 August as the men's 200m final (8:30pm) takes place. The U.S. national record holder has made no secret of the fact he wants to take down Usain Bolt's world record, and his personal best is just 0.12 seconds away from Bolt's mark.\n\nMeanwhile, India will be targeting a second athletics Olympic gold medal as defending champion Neeraj Chopra goes in the men's javelin throw final (8:25pm). In Tokyo, Chopra became India's first individual Olympic champion since 2008 and the first in track and field. However, competition will be fierce as ever from the likes of Jakub Vadlejch, while Germany will have Julian Weber.\n\nAnd then there's Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone, the woman seemingly no one can beat. Having set a new world record (pending ratification) of 50.65 at the U.S. Trials, and with no-one else close, she is the runaway favourite in the women's 400m hurdles final (9:25pm), but don't count out Femke Bol, the only other woman to have run under 51 seconds.\n\nSailing: Singapore could win historic medal\n\nThe small Southeast Asian island state of Singapore has only had one Olympic champion in history, when Joseph Schooling won swimming gold at Rio 2016. That could change on Day 13 at the Marseille Marina, as sailing gets set to crown its first kiteboarding champions in this new event (from 3:40pm if conditions allow).\n\nThat's thanks to Max Maeder, the 17-year-old who is already two-time reigning world champion despite his young age, in addition to silver in 2022 and three Youth World Championships titles. He also won gold at the Asian Games last year to add to a growing list of achievements.\n\nMedal events\n\nAthletics (track and field)\n\n20:00: W long jump final; 20:25: M javelin throw final; 20:30: M 200m final; 21:25: W 400m hurdles final; 21:45: M 110m hurdles final\n\nBoxing\n\n21:30–22:01: M 57kg semi-finals; 22:02–22:33: W 75kg semi-finals (losing semi-finalists win bronze); 22:34–22:50: M 51kg final; 22:51–23:06: W 54kg final\n\nCanoe sprint\n\n13:30–13:40: M C-2 500m final A; 13:40–13:50: W K-4 500m final A; 13:50–14:00: M K-4 500m final A\n\nCycling (track)\n\n19:11–19:17: W keirin final; 19:27–20:00: M omnium points race\n\nDiving\n\n15:00–16:40: M 3m springboard final\n\nFootball\n\n17:00–20:00: M bronze medal match\n\nHockey\n\n14:00–15:45: M bronze medal match; 19:00–20:45: M gold medal match\n\nMarathon swimming\n\n07:30–10:00: W 10km open water\n\nSubject to water quality conditions.\n\nSailing\n\n11:43–12:10: Mixed two-person dinghy medal race; 12:18–12:38: Mixed multihull medal race; 15:40–16:10: M kiteboarding final; 16:37–17:07: W kiteboarding final\n\nSport climbing\n\n12:54–13:00: M speed finals\n\nTaekwondo\n\n20:19–21:33: M -68kg medal contests; 20:35–21:52: W -57kg medal contests\n\nWeightlifting\n\n15:00–17:08: W 59kg; 19:30–21:38: M 73kg\n\nWrestling\n\n19:30–20:05: M Greco-Roman 67kg medal finals; 20:05–20:40: M Greco-Roman 87kg medal finals; 20:50–21:25: W freestyle 53kg final\n\nFull daily schedule here.\n\nSailing: Low winds wreak havoc on races, medals to be awarded on Thursday\n\nWe had four medal races scheduled in Marseille today in the sailing competitions, but in the end only two – the women's and men's dinghy medal races, themselves already postponed from Tuesday – could be completed before low winds ended hopes of any further sailing for the day.\n\nThe same lack of winds also forced the cancellation of the remaining opening series races in the men's kite and women's kite events, with just seven and six races in the opening series completed (just enough to hold a medal series under the rules).\n\nIt means four medals are due to be awarded tomorrow in sailing, with Friday the last potential reserve day – otherwise the opening series standings will decide medals.\n\nHere are how things stand:\n\nMixed multihull, overall net points ahead of medal race\n\nTita/Banti (ITA), 27\n\nMajdalani/Bosco (ARG), 41\n\nGimson/Burnet (GBR), 47\n\nWilkinson/Dawson (NZL), 47\n\nOnly these four teams remain in the medal hunt, with none of the top three teams being able to finish on more than 69 points after the medal race and the fifth-place team currently sitting on 70 points. The medal race will be scored using the low-points system, with points doubled for each finishing position (2 points for finishing first, 4 for second, etc).\n\nMixed dinghy, overall net points ahead of medal race\n\nVadlau/Mähr (AUT), 24\n\nXammar Hernández/Brugman Cabot (ESP), 31\n\nOkada/Yoshioka (JPN), 35\n\nDahlberg/Karlsson (SWE), 39\n\nCosta/João (POR), 49\n\nMermod/Siegenthaler (SUI), 52\n\nLecointre/Mion (FRA), 54\n\nOnly these seven teams remain in the medal hunt, with none of the top three teams being able to finish on more than 57 points after the medal race and the eighth-place team currently sitting on 57 points (and will score at least 2 points in the medal race). The medal race will be scored using the low-points system, with points doubled for each finishing position (2 points for finishing first, 4 for second, etc).\n\nMen's kite, standings after opening series and qualification information\n\nToni Vodisek (SVK), qualified for final with 2 automatic wins\n\nMax Maeder (SGP), qualified for final with 1 automatic win\n\nRiccardo Pianosi (ITA), qualified for semi-final A with 2 automatic wins\n\nValentin Bontus (AUT), qualified for semi-final B with 2 automatic wins\n\nJannis Maus (GER), qualified for semi-final B with 1 automatic win\n\nAxel Mazella (FRA), qualified for semi-final A with 1 automatic win\n\nBruno Lobo (BRA), semi-final A\n\nConnor Bainbridge (GBR), semi-final B\n\nMarkus Edegran (USA), semi-final B\n\nHuang Qibin (CHN), semi-final A\n\nEach semi-final will be run over multiple races until a sailor reaches three wins (including automatic wins), and that sailor will qualify for the final. The final will be run over multiple races until a sailor reaches three wins (including automatic wins), with the remaining boats ranked based on the number of wins during the final.\n\nWomen's kite, standings after opening series and qualification information\n\nLauriane Nolot (FRA), qualified for final with 2 automatic wins\n\nEleanor Aldridge (GBR), qualified for final with 1 automatic win\n\nDaniela Moroz (USA), qualified for semi-final A with 2 automatic wins\n\nAnnelous Lammerts (NED), qualified for semi-final B with 2 automatic wins\n\nLeonie Meyer (GER), qualified for semi-final B with 1 automatic win\n\nElena Lengwiler (SUI), qualified for semi-final A with 1 automatic win\n\nBreiana Whitehead (AUS), semi-final A\n\nMaggie Pescetto (ITA), semi-final B\n\nJulia Damasiewicz (POL), semi-final B\n\nGal Zukerman (ISR), semi-final A\n\nEach semi-final will be run over multiple races until a sailor reaches three wins (including automatic wins), and that sailor will qualify for the final. The final will be run over multiple races until a sailor reaches three wins (including automatic wins), with the remaining boats ranked based on the number of wins during the final.\n\nAthletics: Soufiane El Bakkali wins steeplechase gold again\n\nThe last final in the Stade de France tonight is the men's 3000m steeplechase.\n\nAfter 1000m, it's an Ethiopian one-two-three with Samuel Firewu at the front.\n\nDefending champion Soufiane El Bakkali of Morocco is also towards the front, as is world record holder Lamecha Girma.\n\nGetnet Wale has moved into the lead at 1800m, while Kenya's Simon Kiprop Koech is just reminding the field he's there.\n\nAnd it's Koech who has moved to the front of the pack with two laps to go. Still anyone's race as the field remains close together.\n\nThey're through the penultimate water jump and now Mohamed Tindouft of Morocco is in the lead as they come up to the bell. Actually, Firewu just passed him before the bell.\n\nWe have an attack at the front from USA's Kenneth Rooks and his lead is growing!\n\nCan the field respond? We have a fall on the back straight obstacle and it's Girma!\n\nBut here comes El Bakkali! He overtakes Rooks off the final bemd!\n\nIt's a three-way race to the line but Soufiane El Bakkali retains his Olympic title!\n\n8:06.05.\n\nRooks wins silver in a new personal best and Abraham Kibiwot bronze.\n\nAthletics: Roje Stona produces shock win in men's discus with Olympic record\n\nWe're into the final round of throws in the men's discus throw final, with a surprise leader: Jamaica's Roje Stona, at 70.00m, which broke Mykolas Alekna's briefly held Olympic record.\n\nThe world record holder Alekna has some work to do here.\n\nDefending champion Daniel Ståhl of Sweden fouls his final throw and his reign will end with him placing seventh.\n\nThe 2022 world champ, Slovenia's Kristjan Ceh, sits in fourth heading into this last round of throws. But that is well short and will mean he leaves Paris without a medal.\n\nThe podium is set. But who will end where?\n\nMatthew Denny of Australia doesn't come close to the 70m mark and that will mean he leaves with bronze.\n\nNow then. Can Alekna do anything? He is the world record holder. Will he keep the Olympic record in the family?\n\nNo, it's not enough! This is a surprise – Jamaica's Roje Stona will win gold!\n\nWhat can he do with this final throw? He pumps up the crowd. Won't improve on his 70.00m – but he leaves as champion and the new Olympic record holder!"
