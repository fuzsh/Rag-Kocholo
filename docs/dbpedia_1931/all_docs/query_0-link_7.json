        "text": "Today Swedish archaeology and cultural heritage management are embraced by the xenophobic party Sweden Democrats. This is a problematic situation, and once again it is therefore time to discuss the rela­ tionship between archaeology, cultural heritage and politics – not as a consequence of theoretical considera­ tions and standpoints, but against the background of the harsh political reality. The overall aim of this pa­ per is to contribute to the discussion concerning which strategy, or strategies, Swedish archaeology and cul­ tural heritage management should adopt as a response to the present political situation and as a defence of a solidaristic and multicultural Swedish society.\n\nNarratives of archaeology and cultural heritage have no relevance for the people who lived in the past; they are only significant in the context in which they are expressed. Hence the meaning of these narratives must be in the present. The question is then, why the narratives of archaeology and heritage are significant at all? One possible answer is that they are important for our sense of Being. Through these narratives, archaeological remains and cultural heritage become a part of our own Existence, of our Being-in-the-world. We not only are living in history but also live with it, and one of the purposes of history is to give perspectives on our Being and Existence in the world. Such perspectives easily let us understand cultural heritage and archaeological remains as belonging to our society and us. In this essay, we discuss and analyse Swedish archaeology and heritage management from the perspective of our present Being-in-the-world. We begin with a brief historical overview demonstrating how Swedish archaeology and heritage management have for centuries been consistently involved in the construction of a nationalistic and essentially ethnic identity, creating a confident standpoint from which the Swedes can judge their surroundings. Thus the existential possibility that always lies within the narratives of archaeology and heritage becomes a political and ontological tool, an instrument easily used to protect the Swedish existence against perceived threats, from the eerie inside the nation itself, from the Other that defines the Us and the Ours. This potentially problematic situation is discussed in relation to the Field, the Law, and with the example of a recently produced Handbook of Contract Archaeology.\n\nThis paper aims to discuss subalterns in different social environments in Sweden. The potential of archaeological studies of landless subalterns in rural and urban areas are shown though a number of case studies. It is argued that archaeology can show the multivocality of the lives of the subalterns, in the same way as it shows how the subalterns organized their daily life. This is done through the use of the concepts of matterscape, powerscape, and mindscape. The subalterns used the physical landscape (matterscape) according to prevailing norms and power structures (powerscape), thus creating a perceptive understanding of their daily landscape (mindscape).\n\nInternational congresses of archaeology ceased abruptly after the outbreak of the First World War. The first Nordic Meeting of Archaeologists was held in 1916 in Kristiania (Norway). The first five meetings are analysed in this study. From the very beginning, these meetings were highly significant both for introducing new finds and for bringing interpretations under discussion. Also methodological questions, especially those relating to scientific methods, were included in the programmes. On the other hand, archaeological theory was not dealt with, nor was there any unanimity on theoretical questions. Diffusionist explanation models dominated the presentations, but a considerable plurality of views was allowed. Ideological connotations can be observed in several papers and excursions, but ethnic questions were relatively marginal. The various attempts to discover a common Nordic idea at the meetings did not lead to significant results. On a practical level, the meetings proved to be important from the beginning."
