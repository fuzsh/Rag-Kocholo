Foundations\n\nPolitics and Resentment: Examining Antisemitism and Counter-Cosmopolitanism in the European Union and Beyond Lars Rensmann and Julius H. Schoeps I. An Unlikely Resurgence of a ‘European Phenomenon’? In the course of history, antisemitism has been an integral part of European modernity. It certainly marked the “short twentieth century,” an “age of extremes” (Hobsbawm 1994). Post-War Europe after 1945, then, emerged against the background of the catastrophe of the Holocaust and the genocidal antisemitism that motivated it. However, by and large post-War European governments and citizens recognized—and at times were forced to accept—the need for a substantial break with the past. This affected first and foremost the democratization of political institutions. Yet, it also entailed facing the legacy of ethnic nationalism’s and antisemitism’s road to destruction and persecution. In particular, Europe’s post-national integration into the European Union evolved—among other things—as a moral and political counter-model to the antisemitic, totalitarian and ethnicnationalist legacy that shaped the first half of the European 20th century. Although coming to terms with the colonial and totalitarian past continues to be a difficult matter for European nations and publics, many significant lessons have been drawn from the continent’s moral and political downfall, and from the crises and mass atrocities that were part and parcel of European political modernity. To be sure, European societies continue to be shaped by ongoing public controversies about their difficult legacies of the 19th and 20th century: namely the continent’s colonial history, two world wars, Stalinism and Nazism, the rise of “totalitarian antisemitism” and in particular the atrocities of the Holocaust (Horkheimer & Adorno 1985). These debates continue to signify a “constant seesaw between learning and forgetting,” as Saul Friedlander (1993) once put it. They also document considerably varying, sometimes only half-hearted efforts by different governments, parties, and elites to address a nation’s\n\n4\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\ndifficult legacy (Art 2005; Barkan 2004). Indeed, especially the Nazi terror of Auschwitz and Treblinka is not just an “unmastered” but also an unmasterable past (Lowenthal 1987a). Working through this past is by no means an easy task. The process of collective learning in order to overcome century-old legacies of resentments and particularistic enmities is an ongoing, open-ended process. Deep-seated prejudices can dissipate with time. They do not disappear overnight. Political systems can change from one day to the next; political cultures need much time to substantially transform. Significant cross-national variations notwithstanding, however, overall antisemitism and racism had been in decline in post-War Europe and, in particular, since Europe’s politico-cultural cosmopolitanization in the wake of the second globalization (Markovits & Rensmann 2010). By now, such group resentments have become generally discredited among the publics of democratic member states of the European Union, though they are still virulent in significant parts of the electorate. By and large European nations, and first and foremost the EU itself, have turned into political agents of inclusive cosmopolitan agendas (Beck & Grande 2007; Checkel & Katzenstein 2009) that are engaged in struggles against ethnic, social, cultural, or religious discrimination. The shifting memory regimes in relation to Europe’s Holocaust legacy and national remembrance have played a significant role in this process (Fogu, Kantsteiner & Lebow 2006). Furthermore, while latent forms of antisemitism never fully dissipated among considerable segments of citizens and voters, comparative time series survey data from Western Europe demonstrate that post-war European societies also witnessed an overall intergenerational change. Over five decades until the 1990s, there has been a notable, though not necessarily linear decline of antisemitic and racist attitudes in subsequent generational cohorts (cf. Bergmann 2008). These empirical findings are as much a reflection of Europe’s aforementioned institutional democratization as they express cultural modernization and liberalization processes in European societies.1 The European and World Value Surveys indicate that contemporary Europe is shaped by cultural change towards post-materialism, tolerance, self-expression values and In various respects this process has been belated in Western countries like Spain, Portugal and Greece, which remained military dictatorships until the beginning of the post-industrial age. This also applies to the post-Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 1\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n5\n\ninclusive cosmopolitan preferences generally at odds with old antiJewish and racist hatred. They are part of a “broader shift towards self-expression values that is reshaping orientations toward authority, politics, gender roles, and sexual norms among the publics of postindustrial societies [. . .]—the rise of humanistic norms that emphasize human emancipation and self-expression” (Inglehart & Welzel 2005: 126). The latter are in turn reliable predictors of political democratization; those values generate demands for institutional democratization bringing stronger entitlements to liberty, autonomy, and liberal democracy. Inglehart and Welzel also suggest that post-material cultural change toward self-expression values favoring autonomous human choice over authoritarianism and conventional prejudice is conditioned by low levels of existential security (Inglehart & Welzel 2005: 287). From an neo-institutionalist and from a discourse-theoretical perspective, however, such value change may also be caused by increasingly democratized institutions and rights entitlements, on the one hand; interacting processes of democratic public will-formation leading to changed normative self-understandings of postmodern societies, on the other (Habermas 1996; Rensmann 2004a; 2004b). Be that as it may, in spite of recurring exceptions to the rule, by the 1990s overt racial antisemitism and racism had become more and more illegitimate. They were discredited in post-War West European political cultures. According to European self-understandings, public manifestation of open racism and antisemitism usually experienced negative sanctions or scandalizing (Bergmann 1997). This is a mechanism that right-wing extremists, whose objective is to overcome liberal democracy, often portray as an infringement on freedom of speech and democracy. Nonetheless, these—nationally varying—discursive boundaries that were established in post-War Europe’s democratic publics have had significant impact. They have re-shaped societal selfunderstandings, cultural values, and their public display (Rensmann 2004a). Consequently, public antisemitic and racist agents could only survive on the radical fringes of European societies. Since 1945, antisemitic agitators had little public space to disseminate their views. They were socially and politically marginalized. In spite of several attempted attacks on Jewish synagogues and community centers by left-wing radicals in the name of ‘anti-Zionism’ (Kraushaar 2005) or antisemitic hate crimes by neo-Nazis, radical antisemitism remained predominantly limited to graffiti and isolated incidents of demagogic political speech, or it was pressed into semi-public spheres and camouflaged in\n\n6\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\ncoded forms of crypto-antisemitism. In the context of the consolidation of democratic political and party systems, extreme right parties became largely politically irrelevant and had little to no electoral success until the mid-1980s; the Movimento Sociale Italiano in post-War Italy being one of few exceptions (cf. Ignazi 2003). In many respects, all of these developments made a significant resurgence of open antisemitism, ethnic nationalism and racism unlikely to occur in the European context. Or so it seemed. II. Signs of Trouble: New Actors, Issues, and Mobilizations in Transnational Spaces If the quasi-linear narrative of post-War democratization and working through the past—to a varying degree and with diverging speed in different European countries—gave us the full picture, why is there a need to address antisemitism as a pressing concern in contemporary European societies? All the progress within the horizon of the EU’s liberal democracies and the Union’s post-national politico-cultural integration notwithstanding, we witness more than one indicator that points to the ongoing resilience of resentful societal undercurrents, if not to a partial reversal of the presumed collective learning process. As Robert Wistrich points out, the specter of “apocalyptic anti-Semitism” has returned to haunt Europe, “while often assuming radically new forms” (Haaretz, November 3, 2009). This affects individual attitudes as well as public manifestations in national and transnational spaces. To be sure, the political consensus that blatant expressions of antisemitism (and open racism, for that matter) are unacceptable still holds among most established democratic parties and other crucial public agents (Bergmann & Heitmeyer 2005: 84). Additionally, there is little evidence that democratic and cosmopolitan value change is in ‘reverse gear’ (Norris & Inglehart 2009). However, just as organized right-wing extremism and radical right parties experienced an unexpected comeback since the 1980s, in recent years antisemitic manifestations appear to have resurfaced across the European continent, and far beyond the borders of the European Union. Stretching from violent extremism to public invectives and political mobilizations, they are often facilitated by extreme right parties and fringe antisemitic organizations, including Islamist groups. But recent research also shows that antisemitism is by no means limited to these groups. It reaches into, and resurfaces,\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n7\n\nin the political center. In light of new—in various collective self-understandings perfectly “moral”—anti-Jewish hostilities, a much more fractured and contested picture emerges today; one that is signifying an ongoing and new challenge. The Rise of the European Extreme Right Right-wing extremism initially re-entered the political space to a large extent in the form of “anti-immigrant parties” (van der Brug, Fennema & Tillie 2000) in Western Europe more than twenty years ago. They were accompanied by racist sub-cultural movements, which in some places led to a trade-off between electorally successful parties and racist subcultures but often had mutually reinforcing effects (Pedahzur & Weinber 2001). Since then, several parties and movements collapsed and dissipated, or their relevance declined. In some cases predecessor parties were replaced by new competitors. Yet, other actors consolidated their political force as ‘new’ extreme right parties, defined here as post-industrial authoritarian and xenophobic antisystem parties that oppose liberal democracy and civil/human rights but which have ‘modernized’ their ideology and distanced themselves from old fascist identity politics (Ignazi 2003; Mudde 2003). In many cases, such new extreme right parties succeeded in expanding their electoral outreach beyond the small traditional fascist constituencies in post-War Europe. All in all, compared to previous periods in postWar Europe, the extreme right reemerged as political players more or less across Eastern and Western Europe: Modernized radical right and right-wing populist parties that re-mobilize ethnic nationalism and exclusionism have celebrated varying, yet in several cases repeated success in regional, national, and European elections (Kitschelt 2007; Norris 2005; Mudde 2007). Effectively exploiting particularly favorable demand and supply side conditions, some new extreme or “populist” variants even entered national governments as junior partners (Frölich-Steffen & Rensmann 2007). In some cases they are nurtured by racist sub- und youth cultures, i.e. local networks of “uncivil society” (Pedahzur & Weinberg 2001). Among other things, they have led to high levels of violence against ethnic minorities, immigrants, Jews, and asylum-seekers (Mudde 2005). In other cases they have found the favorable environment of an intellectual neo-nationalist New Right that facilitates cultural racism, opposition to the liberal post-materialist and post-national values represented by the New Left, and—in\n\n8\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\ncountries like France and Germany—subtle anti-Jewish sentiments and Holocaust revisionism (Minkenberg 1992). In the recent 2009 European elections many extreme right parties once again succeeded in increasing their turn-out at the ballot box: The new anti-Islam party, led by Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, received 15% of the Dutch vote, the anti-immigrant Danish People’s Party doubled its support, and even the revamped extreme right British National Party (BNP) celebrated large gains and entered the European Parliament, moving from the fringes to becoming the first fascist party in British history to win seats in a national vote. Never before did the BNP gain a seat in the European or the British Parliament.2 We have thus witnessed another breakthrough in a history of many extreme right successes since the French Front National entered the European Parliament in 1984 (Ignazi 2003; Rensmann 2003). A Revival of Antisemitism? Indicators of Change and New Conflicts While the revival of extreme right parties has received broad attention by political science research, turning the radical right into arguably the best studied European party family (Mudde 2007),3 the diagnosed recent rise of antisemitism within and beyond the confines of extreme right mobilizations has so far hardly come under scholarly scrutiny. This void is especially apparent for comprehensive comparative European studies that include quantitative and qualitative approaches aiming at methodologically robust explanatory frameworks. Apparently breaking with the post-War evolution of anti-antisemitic public norms in Europe, however, the indicators of a new wave of renewed and revived anti-Jewish resentments are many.4 They can be found on various levels and in different contexts.\n\n2 This previous lack of success is, of course, also due to internal party factors (the BNP only recently tried to overcome its overtly militant roots) and due to the electoral system: the Single Member District Plurality (SMDP) electoral system in Britain is unfavorable for small parties (Norris 2005; Goodwin 2007) but the European elections have introduced proportional representation in the UK. 3 The isolation of factors and explanatory variables as well as persuasive theorizing on the interaction of supply and demand side conditions are still in many ways controversial and contested (Kitschelt 2007; Rensmann & Miller 2010). 4 Antisemitic resentment, not racism or hostility against immigrants and Muslims, is the primary subject of this volume. Yet while racist resentment is not the special focus of this volume, it will be addressed at various junctures. In fact, one of the general\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n9\n\n(1) Since 2000, comparative surveys point to a rise of antisemitism. Reversing the long-time downward trend evident in pre-2000 time series data, this entails younger generational cohorts in several countries (Bergmann 2008). Contrary to the preceding long-term decline, cross-national surveys show a stable plateau of anti-Jewish attitudes in most European member states over the last decade and a new willingness to display such resentment in polls. While traditional forms of antisemitism have continued to decline in some countries (though at a slower pace), there is a consolidation of antisemitic resentment across Europe and a dramatic rise in some EU member states (ADL 2009). (2) In addition, public manifestations of anti-Jewish slander, hate crimes, and violent attacks directed against Jews, synagogues, and Jewish centers have also dramatically increased in the 2000s. Although data collection by law enforcement and public agencies is of varying quality because they employ unstandardized, in some cases vastly different statistical criteria, comparative data do indicate that such antisemitic incidents have substantially increased in Europe since the turn of the century. In some countries the rise has been quite steep. In January 2009 alone hundreds of Jewish cemeteries were vandalized (or, in the case of the Malmo cemetery, firebombed); Jewish centers and synagogues were attacked in different locations such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Paris, Charleroi, Brussels, London and Helsingborg. In Toulouse, for example, a car filled with Molotov cocktails rammed into the front gate of a synagogue, while in Amstelveen shots were fired at a clinic run by the Jewish community (European Agency for Fundamental Rights 2009: 26ff; EFA 2009: 4ff ). According to the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, data since 2000 reveal fluctuations and national variations. They also point to a substantial rise of antisemitic crimes in several countries, in particular in 2009. In the wellstudied case of France, for instance, there has been a mean increase\n\nhypotheses of this book is the claim that there is a high correlation between antisemitism and racism, though both need to be distinguished as different forms of resentment. Any new mobilization of antisemitic and counter-cosmopolitan resentment tends to entail the resurgence of racist mobilizations against immigrants and other ethnic minorities (Rensmann & Miller 2010). There are several indicators for an increasing relevance of racist exclusion in various European contexts. For instance, a recent study on “Ethnic Profiling in Paris” shows that those who appeared to be of Arab origin were at least 7.5 times more likely than whites to be stopped by police forces, and that those perceived to be black were six times more likely to be stopped—although racial and ethnic profiling by the police is illegal in France (Erlanger 2009).\n\n10\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nof antisemitic hate crimes by 48% between 2001 and 2006. While racist violence also remains at a high level, since 2000 more French Jews than French immigrants have been injured as a result of violent incidents. In 2004, France saw the largest number of antisemitic incidents in recent memory, and antisemitic “actions and threats” have remained at a historically high level since then (Commission Nationale Consultative des Droits de l’Homme 2006). As Robert C. Lieberman points out, this is “hardly a picture of a society in which antisemitism is an insignificant matter.” (Lieberman 2009a: 249) In Germany, the largest member state of the EU, anti-Jewish hate crimes also remain on an extraordinarily high level. It reached a peak of 1,682 in 2005 (European Agency for Fundamental Rights 2009: 22). Those data reflect the ongoing need to have high alert security surrounding virtually every synagogue and Jewish institution in Europe. Furthermore, during the escalating military conflicts in South Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in early 2009 banners and slogans demanding “Jews out” or “Death to the Jews” have become more popular and tolerated on anti-Israel demonstrations across Europe (EFA 2009: 8). According to the European Jewish Congress, European governments and police have “ample evidence that some anti-Israel demonstrations have descended into openly antisemitic tirades” (EFA 2009: 8). At any rate, the list of those incidents and public manifestations, some of them violent, that can be classified as antisemitic has become more extensive in recent years, with annual and cross-national variations and with peaks after specific events such as the escalations of the Middle East conflict or the financial crisis, which have been widely covered by the media. (3) There appear to be some revived anti-Jewish political mobilizations that incorporate new salient issues in the public sphere such as globalization, the global financial crisis, or the Middle East conflict. At times such mobilizations come from nominally different poles of the political spectrum or otherwise different political persuasions. More often than not antisemitism is on display or promoted by some reputable agents in civil society. In 2009, for example, the well respected left-wing trade union Flaica-Uniti-Cub called for a boycott of “all Jewish-owned or Jewish-run stores” in “solidarity with the Palestinians,” the “Jews of today,” and asked its members to draw lists of Jewish shops that should be targeted (Owen 2009). Two years before the extreme right and notoriously antisemitic Italian party-organization Forza Nuova (FN) had attacked the Israeli embassy with tomatoes.\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n11\n\nThey were supposed to symbolize the blood of Palestinians. FN took action under the banner “Hezbollah—until victory” (Corriere della Sera 2006). Other European right-wing agitators have adopted the term “Zionist Occupied Government,” invented by American neoNazis, to portray national governments and the United Nations as controlled by “war-mongering” Jews or “Zionists.” Accusing them of running a ‘secret world government,’ extreme right groups charge “the Zionists” with manipulating national governments and orchestrating the UN and America in order to advance their alleged cause: world domination. In Germany, the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), which can be classified as an extreme right party with significant links to the militant neo-Nazi spectrum, now mobilizes for “peace demonstrations.” The militarist party calls, ironically, for an “end to war.” It fights against “Zionist occupation,” “warmongering imperialism,” and “Israel’s terror” or “apartheid regime” (cf. www.npd.de). Antisemitism, at times in modernized and populist forms, therefore, seems to recapture its formerly prominent place in the arsenal of (new) extreme right rhetoric, ideology and campaigns, along with neo-racism and anti-immigrant agitation. But often such resentments also transcend the confines of the extreme right. This also applies to hostility against immigrants and, in particular, prejudices against Muslims. (4) A revival of anti-Jewish conspiracy myths, antisemitic cartoons, and free-floating hate speech also appears to benefit from the possibilities offered by the Internet and other new media technologies, where people can articulate resentments anonymously and in an unfiltered fashion. These new media are of increasing relevance in shaping the public spheres of our European post-industrial information societies. And there is a notable increase and flourishing of hate speech against Jews over the last decade that finds an outlet in these new media. Some hate sites openly call for a “new final solution of the Jewish question.” Others deny the Holocaust altogether. Many, however, display other forms of blatant anti-Jewish hatred and racism. For instance, an entire series of antisemitic cartoons showing Jews as cockroaches and insects and making a mockery of the Holocaust—cartoons that were distributed by the Iranian government after an official “Holocaust cartoon competition”—soon found entry into various extreme right and also left-wing websites. They have managed thereby to escape the legal prosecution under laws against instigation of racist hatred that are enforced in several European countries and reflect EU policy.\n\n12\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\n(5) Finally, there are indicators of a rising readiness to publicly articulate anti-Jewish resentments, both in blatant and coded forms, within the democratic public space. This is presumably linked to a change in public and political reactions. While antisemitic conspiracy myths appear to experience a European-wide renaissance through various new media, new research also suggests that antisemitic stereotypes are more often articulated in broader national and transnational publics. In some countries, researchers diagnose an “erosion of communication latency” with regard to antisemitism (Bergmann & Heitmeyer 2005). They claim that formerly latent or semi-public resentments have entered the democratic public. Due to more lax public and political responses, such resentments are reiterated with more confidence. Some national studies also suggest that the boundaries of what is viewed as antisemitic or acceptable in the public sphere are changing and eroding, and with it the latency of antisemitism (Salzborn 2008; Rensmann 2004a).5 For example, a wide-ranging report by the British Parliament diagnoses a broadened “antisemitic discourse”: “a widespread change in mood and tone when Jews are discussed, whether in print or broadcast, at universities, or in public or social settings. We are concerned that anti-Jewish themes and remarks are gaining acceptability in some quarters in public and private discourse in Britain and there is a danger that this trend will become more and more mainstream.” The report also concludes that “it is clear that violence, desecration of property, and intimidation directed towards Jews is on the rise since 2000.” (All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism 2006, Summary) This “regained acceptability” along with a rationalizing tolerance displayed by considerable parts of European elites, media, and the “chattering classes” when it comes to various contemporary forms of anti-Jewish hostility may well be the most telling indicator that times\n\n5 As Samuel Salzborn argues, it is long customary in German research “to distinguish four sub-dimensions of Judeophobia: 1) religiously-based Christian prejudice against Jews; 2) a biologically construed racial antisemitism; 3) so-called secondary antisemitism (see below), and 4) anti-Zionist antisemitism. [. . .] The public articulation of attitudes that could be classified as religious or racial antisemitism has slowly but continuously declined in the course of postwar German history—which, of course, says nothing about how widespread such opinions really are. Quantitative studies reveal, however, a relatively high incidence of secondary and anti-Zionist antisemitism in political and social discourse.” (Salzborn 2008: 156)\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n13\n\nhave changed for Jews; not only but also in democratic, increasingly cosmopolitan Europe.6 All these observations require more systematic data and research. But in spite of considerable national variations, it appears that it is fair to diagnose resurgent anti-Semitism across the continent. This problem is neither limited to certain national communities, nor does it stop at the European Union’s borders. In fact, antisemitism is no longer exclusively a ‘European problem’, either. It also needs to be viewed in its global context—especially in the age of the second, post-industrial globalization. Although political cultures matter and are often resilient, there is no longer any genuinely ‘national’ or ‘European antisemitism’ in the contemporary world, though antisemitism’s origins may vary. Ethnic national identity constructs or specifically European issues— such as post-colonial and post-Holocaust guilt and the unconscious desire to externalize both—may still play a distinct role as motivational factors. Be that as it may, the Holocaust, the unprecedented atrocities against the European Jews committed by German Nazis and their collaborators, has changed the very essence and meaning of antisemitism. The genocidal judeophobia that motivated the extermination of the European Jews will continue to signify a particular, and particularly important, legacy in post-Holocaust Europe and beyond. The memory of Auschwitz is not a ‘screen’ that shields us from understanding contemporary political realities and genocidal threats; rather, reflecting on this history of the breakdown of civilization is essential if we are to understand the present and draw lessons for the future (Arendt 1963). We also follow Theodor Adorno’s dictum that Auschwitz has forced a new categorical imperative upon humankind, namely to “arrange their thoughts and actions so that Auschwitz will not repeat itself, so that nothing similar will happen.” (Adorno 1966) Hannah Arendt was among the first who recognized the era of the Holocaust as the beginning of a new “global condition,” and of an age of statelessness and genocidal politics. The atrocities and the new global condition force us to take humanity as a political reference\n\n6 This includes the all too often downplayed and rationalized radical antisemitism and mass hate (Kressel 2002) advocated by radical Islamists as well as the president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who has called for the destruction of the Jewish state of Israel and denied the Holocaust on more than one occasion, thereby turning overt antisemitism into a key element of domestic and foreign governmental policy.\n\n14\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\npoint, with dramatic consequences for human rights and international law (Arendt 1951; Benhabib 2006; Rensmann 2009; Simmons 2009). More specifically, the Nazi crimes—committed against the Jews and against humanity (Arendt 1963)—are also of key significance if we look at anti-Jewish resentments in contemporary society. Such resentments can only be adequately analyzed against the backdrop of their genocidal past. To be sure, since 1945 racial antisemitism, which culminated in Nazism’s murderous totalitarian ideology and the annihilation of the European Jews, is by and large still profoundly discredited in European democracies (more so than in most other countries in the world); so is any blatantly antisemitic conspiracy myth that serves as an all-encompassing world explanation. As a socially delegitimized resentment (Marin 2000: 112–113), antisemitic ideology had for sometime been banned from public communication and pushed into a “communicative latency” (Bergmann 1997). Nonetheless, there is also new evidence of a resurgence of both overt and subtle antisemitism as an attitudinal pattern and as a political ideology, indicating that anti-Jewish resentments in Europe are by no means just a matter of historical inquiry. III. Theoretical Models in Contested Terrain: Theorizing Contexts, Classifications, and Dimensions of Antisemitic Resentment and Counter-Cosmopolitanism Until recently, antisemitism in Europe has been almost exclusively the focus of historical research, and of occasional single-case national studies and opinion surveys. Though social and political science research has begun to focus on the subject and produced some important scholarly contributions as of late (u. a. Endelman 2005; Heitmeyer & Zick 2010; Markovits 2007; Taguieff 2004; Wistrich 2005), theoretically guided comprehensive comparative work on contemporary antisemitism is still largely lacking. This also applies to the broader context of counter-cosmopolitanism, which we will theoretically unfold in this essay. There are two plausible reasons why such research has been marginal. First of all, contemporary political science research and models still tend to neglect questions of political ideology. This also applies to party research, even in case of the extreme right, although there are notable exceptions to the rule (e.g. Mudde 2003; Ignazi 2003).\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n15\n\nNeither do the conventional focus on demand-side theories (e.g. ideal policy preferences and voting behavior) or supply-side approaches (party competition and agency in electoral market-places) sufficiently address the broader public environment of politics, i.e. the question of public will-formation through public discourse and political culture beyond the confines of electoral politics or governmental policy. In these research frameworks politically relevant topics such as antisemitism and nationalist opposition to cosmopolitanism tend to be set aside. More importantly, antisemitism—just like Israel—is a subject that regularly causes much controversy, especially against the background of its European legacy. The subject of antisemitism tends to evoke strong emotional and opinionated public reactions, thereby creating a difficult terrain for sober research. This reinforces a remarkable gap between the widespread public attention on issues of antisemitism and the exclusion of minorities, on the one hand, and the relatively small amount of scholarly inquiries, on the other. Recent public discussions have become very heated and are often polarized across the European publics. Some of these controversies have been framed as new “antisemitism debates.” Political editors and op-eds may help to re-generate an already politically and, in fact, legally charged climate. This creates a difficult environment for any research—which is always embedded in societal contexts. While many Jews are affected by antisemitism and feel threatened as a minority by violent manifestations of hostility that many government authorities increasingly recognize, some parties and public agencies argue antisemitism is an historical phenomenon that is irrelevant today or limited to neo-Nazi fringe groups. Public Controversies and Contexts: Europe, Antisemitism, and the Middle East The controversy about antisemitism and its salience is often linked to ongoing public disputes on Jewish identity, Israel, anti-Zionism and the Middle East. They have only increased in intensity over the years. The controversies about Jews and Israel and the heated argument about the extent, use and character of antisemitism by no means stop before the gates of the scholarly community. A few authors claim that warnings about the rise of antisemitism in Europe, especially on the left, are greatly exaggerated and largely unjustified (Beller 2007b). While some scholars detect an alarming new antisemitism mobilized by extreme right, radical left and Islamist agents that express Jewhatred by singling out and demonizing Israel as a ‘collective Jew,’\n\n16\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nothers claim that anti-Jewish resentment is marginal, a matter of the past, and has been quite thoroughly replaced by Islamophobia (Bunzl 2007).7 In fact, Martin Bunzl maintains that even most European extreme right parties and groups have become “pro-Jewish” and “proIsrael.” But so far evidence supporting this claim is scarce. Moreover, some international relations scholars argue that there is a powerful “Israel lobby” which operates, for instance, as a de facto foreign government in the United States, which—using the alleged power of its money and its control of the media—deliberately equates anti-Israel sentiments with antisemitism, and which uses inflationary antisemitism charges as their ultimate weapon, so that “anyone who criticizes Israeli actions [. . .] stands a good chance of being labeled an antisemite.” (Mearsheimer & Walt 2007, 188; for a critique Fine 2006; Lieberman 2009) They therefore suggest that antisemitism is currently primarily used as a (wide-spread) method to silence criticism of Israel. Authors and publicists who feel that criticism of Israel or Jews is severely restricted and harshly sanctioned in the democratic public also regularly charge critics of antisemitism with being part of a global “network” of a “pro-Israel lobby” or “Zionist lobby.” This “lobby,” which presumably suppresses popular opinion or censors political speech, is therefore accused by such critics for exploiting antisemitism and the Holocaust for political and material purposes, most notably in order to disguise an alleged anti-Palestinian genocide (Finkelstein 2005). Consequently, such critics view “antisemitism” exclusively as a “political weapon” (Cockburn & St. Clair 2003; see also Kovel 2007). The claim that any mentioning of antisemitism as a contemporary problem is part of pro-Israel propaganda apparently also strongly resonates in various European publics. To be sure, the charge of antisemitism (or racism for that matter) is one that should never be made lightly. Yet, claiming that there is a 7 The term “islamophobia” is contested in contemporary scholarly and public debates. It is supposed to point to existing cultural and racist prejudices against Muslim minorities and their religious practices. Yet critics point out that it is also used by Islamists and their supporters to immunize and delegitimize any criticism of radical Islamism, including expressions of homophobia, religious oppression, misogyny, and antisemitism within Islamist ideology and practice. However, it is important to distinguish between reflective criticism of Islamists and of Islam as a political ideology, which is often raised by citizens with a Muslim background as part of struggles within Muslim communities, on the one hand, and generalized hatred of Muslims and Islam on the other, which is racist in nature. This distinction is frequently ignored in public debates and even by scholars on the subject. See also fn. 24.\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n17\n\ngeneral misuse of ‘antisemitism’ is as deeply problematic, if not outright dubious as the analogous claim that “racism” is only a “political weapon” of powerful groups to suppress “the white people.” Both claims also have a long tradition, and are typical of, extreme rightist—and recently New Right—discourses that feed the fantasy that ordinary citizens are persecuted by powerful, hegemonic anti-racists and anti-antisemites (cf. for instance Koch 2006). Such discourse often goes hand in hand with ethnic stereotyping. As Robert Fine (2007) points out, today here is a troubling “tendency to downplay anti-Semitism itself (for example, by arguing that the physical protection of synagogues is unnecessary) and to discredit those who are concerned about anti-Semitism—especially on the grounds that they are not really concerned about anti-Semitism but only about silencing and restricting criticism of Israel.” Often Jews and other critics are also defamed as “oversensitive,” and threats or violence against them are trivialized—contrary to the perception that the threshold for the scandalization of public antisemitism is very low. Moreover, it is important to note that researchers who point out public manifestations of antisemitism and decipher new antisemitic forms of antiZionism and conspiracy theories are themselves exposed to speech restrictions that are induced by massive intimidations through public smear campaigns, and at times by violent threats. By now antisemitism researchers are frequently also confronted with, if not silenced by, libel suits—or the threat thereof—across Europe.8 Plus, the image of an all-powerful, conspirational, string-pulling, global “Zionist lobby” controlling media and politics is itself strikingly similar to traditional resentments against “world Jewry,” “hidden Jewish power” and “Jewish conspiracies.” Most importantly, it is quite difficult to substantiate the claim that criticism of Israel and Zionism is “taboo” or censored in any European public realm. Content analyses rather indicate that in spite of its small size and population Israel is arguably among the most criticized countries in the world. This includes the Western and the European public.9 8 For instance, most recently the Center for Antisemitism Research at the Technical University of Berlin was successfully sued by a conspiracy theorist (Wisnewski 2009). 9 Political attention on events in the Middles East in general and criticism of Israel in particular certainly exceed public criticism of the governments of Sudan or Sri Lanka, where recent massacres in each case cost more lives than there are casualties in the entire history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as violent as the latter has been.\n\n18\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nBe that as it may, there can be little doubt that any public and scientific conversation dealing with antisemitism today takes place in the context of a highly polarized, contested political territory. In fact, antisemitism research has become a minefield. The argument is often heated. It is shaped by serious and at times hefty political charges, on the one hand, and on the other hand ignorance towards, or the outright denial and lack of reflection/recognition of, the very existence of present-day anti-Jewish resentments or violence. Critical political science research has to face the challenge of a controversial and highly charged political environment. The adequate response to this challenge is critical scholarly inquiry in comparative perspective. Such research, to be sure, should be driven by two goals: (i) to rigorously understand and explain the phenomenon but also (ii) to be publicly relevant in the sense of the “normative turn” (Gerring & Yesnowitz 2006) of political science: in our context this entails the goal of combatting and overcoming antisemitism. What is Antisemitism? Seeking Dependent Variables, Defining the Subject(s) Even within the special field of academic research on antisemitism the subject remains highly contested—as is the very idea of cosmopolitanism, for that matter (cf. Vertovec & Cohen 2002). For a start, it is often controversial what is taken as the dependent variable of inquiry, i.e. what it is that should be explained. The subject can be characterized in a number of different ways. These different conceptions have significant consequences for research designs and findings. “Narrow” definitions recognize antisemitism only in manifest phenomena of racial antisemitism, where Jews are openly defamed or attacked as Jews (Klug 2003); in which they are identified as a collective “race” and blamed for a global conspiracy (as exemplified in the infamous, antisemitic forgery “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion”); where Jews are portrayed as vermin; or in cases where antisemites identify themselves as such. The very existence (let alone significance) of latent antisemitism is dismissed (for a critique, Salzborn 2008). However, under liberaldemocratic conditions, even neo-Nazis usually do not identify themselves as antisemites. They also often avoid blatant public hate speech against Jews and other minorities. Instead, they use coded language.10\n\n10 Today, to be sure, it is common that even extreme rightists who outright attack “Jewish dominance” or other conspiracy theorists who feel persecuted by ominous\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n19\n\nSupported by EU-sponsored anti-discrimination legislation, the threat of legal prosecution for racial incitement puts limits on hate speech in many European countries. Openly antisemitic or racist propaganda in the tradition of Nazi demagogues (as embodied in cartoons portraying Jews as cockroaches) is usually subject to criminal prosecution and effective law enforcement in various European member states.11 Too narrow definitions tend to overlook most current and often coded manifestations of Jew-hatred by classifying only neo-Nazi hate speech as such because those instances fall outside of the scope of the initial definition (and thus they suppose a priori that antisemitism has all but completely vanished). All too broad definitions of antisemitism, however, risk conceptual diffusion of the dependent variable’s boundaries. Definitions with a very broad scope tend to ignore discursive ambiguities and ‘grey zones.’ They also tend to distract from the fact that antisemitism is a collective resentment directed against Jews. That does not mean that Jews could not harbor antisemitic resentments. Antisemitism is not a natural but a socio-cultural phenomenon. This implies that Jews—the primary objects of this hatred—are not automatically free from such collective resentments. In fact, it is a common mechanism of anti-Jewish propaganda to use antisemitic Jews as “token witnesses.” Definitions that are too broad, however, might blur the boundaries and see antisemitism as omnipresent, for instance in any criticism of Israeli policies or the critique of capitalism. Neither are accusations against Israel or speculations about the alleged ‘secret machinations’ of finance capital automatically free of antisemitism, as some suggest; nor is the critique of (finance) capitalism or Israeli policies automatically evidence of antisemitism and resentment against Jews. What, then, is antisemitism? What defines its ‘space’—where does it start and where does it end, and are there ambivalent ‘grey zones’ and borderline cases? What are\n\nJewish “global networks” or “Zionist lobbies” fiercely reject to be called “antisemites” because the term has long become a politically discrediting label, equipped with the aura of illegitimacy—especially in post-1945 Europe. However, most recently “antisemitism charges” have also turned into a badge of honor among conspiracy theorists and right-wing extremists. 11 Via the Internet, such hate speech and cartoons continue to be easily accessible and avoid law enforcement. For instance, such cartoons are published on anti-Israel hate sites such as www.no2israel.de—which claims to be left-wing—or Iranian websites. The former website also displays moral outrage over the “behavior of Jewry” and “Jewish power” as well as “Jew-dominated key positions in media.” Retrieved February 17, 2008.\n\n20\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nthe identifiable dimensions, forms and functions of contemporary antisemitism (and, for that matter, counter-cosmopolitanism)? How can we provide robust, theoretically sound dependent and independent variables for empirical studies on antisemitism that illuminate causes and effects while avoiding to simply sample against the dependent variable (i.e. illuminate that antisemitism, the subject of research, exists)? In light of the lack of clarity in much of the public and academic debate, we will suggest some basic definitions and conceptualizations that guide our research. They take both the history and the changing nature of hostility against Jews into account. We will also provide criteria to classify antisemitism and distinguish between antisemitic and non-antisemitic phenomena; the boundaries between the two are too often blurred in public and even academic discussions. In so doing, we will lay the conceptual foundations and the framework of this volume. We will hereby expand the debate on antisemitism by recognizing the specificity of this increasingly transnational, ‘global resentment,’ which in several ways differs from other resentments, and its simultaneous interrelatedness with other resentments and the context of what we conceive as counter-cosmopolitanism. Since the publications by the anti-Jewish ideologue Wilhelm Marr the term antisemitism points to the collective discrimination against and hatred of Jews (it has nothing to do with any actual ‘semitic’ ‘race,’ ‘ethnicity,’ or language origin; cf. Lewis 1999). Similar to other conceptualizations such as ‘anti-Jewish hostility’ or the more psychologically biased but equally useful notion of ‘judeophobia,’ antisemitism is the generic term for group prejudices, stereotypes, and Manichean friend-enemy distinctions through which Jews are collectively devalued as inferior or as “enemies of the nation” (Benz 2004; Rensmann 2004a). According to Helen Fein, antisemitism is a matrix of hostile perceptions, narratives and imaginations about Jews as a collective entity, expressed through attitudes, statements, myths, political ideologies, folklore, images and acts (which include social or legal discrimination, political mobilizations against Jews, as well as individual, collective or state-sponsored violence). It may lead to the exclusion, displacement, persecution, or murder of Jews (Fein 1987). Antisemitism has hereby a special historical record. The term points to a specific history of discrimination reaching back to the pre-Roman and early Christian periods. In the context of this history, multiple antiJewish stereotypes and images have been constructed, re-constructed, and transmitted (Schoeps 1998). They entail centuries old resentments\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n21\n\nabout ‘the Jews’ as Christ-killers (Laqueur 2006; Wistrich 2010), ritual murderers and blood libel, conspiring and cosmopolitan wanderers, personified laziness and physical weakness, a decadent group that subverts public norms, cheating salesmen etc. Today, it is unthinkable to understand antisemitism without thinking of its genocidal expression in the Holocaust. Modern antisemitism is, moreover, a specifically modern construction. It identifies Jews as cosmopolitan enemies of the (European) nationstate and, moreover, literally as the embodiment of all problems and ambiguities of the ‘modern condition’ and modern crises. Antisemitism as a projective worldview can be theorized as an anti-modern reaction that is simultaneously part and parcel of modernity. Antisemitism thereby provides a historically, culturally and politically situated form of a modern world explanation that combines various heterogeneous resentments. In fact, it is one of antisemitism’s specific features that it is a special matrix of resentment that cannot be reduced to a fixed set of semantically unambiguous meanings and stereotypes. We argue that there is no immanently coherent logic in the antisemitic perception of the world: In antisemitic discourses, Jews appear physically weak yet unbelievably powerful, as enemies of civilization yet also too far ahead of the very same civilization (Adorno & Horkheimer 1969).12 They embody regression, decay and decline as well as modern progress (Schoeps 1998). Jews are associated with “raw” instincts, unbridled desires, and low creatures (insects or swine), yet they are also seen as too intellectual, displaying an overpowering intelligence and a sneaky talent to maneuver and manipulate the entire modern world. Poor or wealthy, weak or strong, exclusive or anti-nationalist, moderate or radical, communist or capitalist, pariah or parvenu: seen through the antisemitic lens, Jews are damned whatever they are or do. This insight into the nature of antisemitism points back to the early reflection of Jean-Paul Sartre that antisemitism is not an idea or reflection of the real world but “first of all a passion”: “Far from experience producing his idea of 12 Some researchers still suggest that there is a strictly limited and ‘logical’ set of anti-Jewish stereotypes. For instance, in spite of new empirical findings showing how Jews are blamed for the loss of jobs in various public discourses, Jan Weyand claims that there is no historical or contemporary evidence of antisemitic statements that attribute the rise of unemployment to Jews because—Weyand insists—this stereotype is not part of antisemitism’s historic arsenal (Weyand 2006). Such narrow conceptions fail to understand past and contemporary antisemitism, and its effects. And they gloss over empirical findings.\n\n22\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nthe Jew, it was the latter that explained his experience. If the Jew did not exist, the anti-Semite would invent him.” (Sartre 1948: 10 & 12) In order to conceptualize modern antisemitism it is therefore, on the one hand, necessary to (i) recognize its general dimension. It is a form of collective discrimination directed against Jews, a matrix of resentments against Jewish minorities that is similar to other prejudices against ethnic or cultural minorities or excluded ‘others;’ thus, on the one hand, antisemitism can be defined as a form of racism analogous to other forms of discrimination and exclusionism. It is an “ensemble of resentments, clichés, (re)constructed collective images, binary cultural codes, and categorical attributions as well as discriminating practices against Jews, which can intensify to a full-fledged or partial political ideology and an all-encompassing world-view.” (Rensmann 2004a: 20) We argue that—like other forms of racism—antisemitism is an essentialist and projective matrix that is unrelated to actual behavior of Jews (or other minorities). Yet, on the other hand, it is also important (ii) to conceive anti­ semitism’s specific dimension. There are distinct features that differ from any other racist resentment. They point to distinct traditions and functions in the modern social world. Modern antisemitism is not just a prejudice; it is distinct in that it also serves as a world explanation. Immunizing itself against empirical facts, it is anchored in a quite flexible conspiracy theory that ‘explains’ the origins of all social conflicts, social change, and complexities in the modern capitalist world by projecting them onto Jews. Therefore, there is a significant difference between prejudice and institutionalized racism, which justifies and rationalizes exclusion of ethnic minorities or (post)colonial exploitation, on the one hand, and the anti-modern ideology of antisemitism, on the other, which is not just a form of ethnic stereotyping but attributes secret world domination to ‘the Jews’. Antisemitism views Jews as anti-national, “parasitic,” wandering, “rootless cosmopolitans” and all-powerful but secret “string-pullers” behind the workings of modern society (and today, global society). Thus antisemitism imagines a closed community and hidden conspiracy manipulating the world and pursuing world domination—a ‘fact’ that only the antisemite is capable of exposing. The most striking manifest and lasting expression of this image are the forged Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a piece of propaganda from 1903 that presents the Jews as “a ubiquitous secret society, alien and evil, supernaturally powerful . . . [and] intent upon dominating the world” (Bronner 2000: 71–72).\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n23\n\nAs mentioned before, modern antisemitic beliefs construct Jews as lazy, decadent, and ruthless, among other things. In the antisemitic perception they are imagined as greedy agents of finance capitalism, globalism, and cosmopolitanism who subvert the cohesion and values of national communities. A modern antisemitic world-view suggests that the ‘war-mongering Jews’ manufacture public opinion by controlling modern media. And another related, typically antisemitic, stereotype suggests that ‘they’ drive nations and the world into war. Modern antisemitism, hence, is another but a far cry from being just another form of racism that rationalizes ethnic exclusion and oppression; the former is part of a distinct, anti-modern societal movement of the modern world (Longerich 2010). Historically, it marched in step and gained in popularity with the political, social and cultural rise of modern enlightenment, modern capitalist society, and civil-republican rule of law. The rise of modern bourgeois society entitled Jews with rights and increasingly included Jews in its social fabric, with which they where henceforth identified. Thus, different from other forms of racism, it is modern antisemitism’s specific quality to explain the modern world—with all its crises, problems, complex and contradictory developments—by blaming the Jews and their allegedly ‘evil character.’ It is, again, an ideology/movement that explains the world by attributing all the negative aspects of contemporary modern society— including economic crises, transformations, capitalism, and war—to a small minority (of the global community and within the nations) or, more recently, also to the Jewish nation-state of Israel. In the words of some extreme right anti-Jewish publicists, there is a lingering “Israelization of the world.” Unlike other forms of racism against ethnic minorities or ‘others,’ only antisemitism provides for an all-encompassing, personified and objectified anti-modernity. Such objectification does not just devaluate Jews; it also ‘elevates’ them in a stereotypical fashion by attributing enormous ‘secret power’ to them. The underlying structure of modern antisemitism, then, is an encompassing conspiracy theory that ascribes the most heterogeneous societal and political phenomena to Jewish behavior and ‘string-pulling.’ Through this reified personification of social processes, Jews are constructed not just as a generalized other but also as the specific other of the modern world, they embody an endless multiplicity of socio-cultural phenomena as well as, in particular, political modernity’s actual and perceived problems and the cosmopolitan erosion of traditional identities. Conspiracy myths are thereby a central ingredient of antisemitic thought. Serving as the\n\n24\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nprimary historical target of conspiracy thinking, there is often a close link between conspiracy myths and the anti-Jewish imagination. In contemporary antisemitic manifestations, too, “the Jews,” “the Rothschilds” or “the Zionists” are often portrayed as secret string-pullers behind immigration, diversity, cultural multiplicity, socio-cultural change, military conflicts, the American and other “imperialist” governments, the global economic crisis, or the presumed decline of national communities and national sovereignty. In a typical fashion, for instance, the American Holocaust denier and violent neo-Nazi James von Brunn claimed: “Obama is created by the Jews” (cf. CNN 2009). It is thereby an integral part of antisemitic ideologies and perceptions to view ‘the Jews’ as “aggressors;” the antisemites, in turn, claim that they are only defending themselves against ‘the Jews’ and their all-powerful “global Zionist network” and that they are a “persecuted minority.” They are, in Adorno’s words, potential persecutors “who pretend to be the persecuted” (Adorno 1964). Criteria and Boundaries: Antisemitism, Racism, and Anti-Zionism We can speak of antisemitism when Jews are directly discriminated against, and thus essentialized. But anti-Jewish stereotypes directed against Jews can be articulated in various, possibly subtle ways. In contested discursive spaces, boundaries of such classifications are not easy to determine; neither are their cultural, political and legal contexts and implications. The working definition suggested by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) [now EU Agency for Fundamental Rights] offers some useful reference points in order to develop a set of robust criteria to classify antisemitism. It runs counter to the polarized political debate on “inflationary” antisemitism charges, on one hand, and the denial of antisemitic phenomena altogether, on the other. But it explicitly includes new forms of anti-Jewish hostility and exclusion, such as forms of anti-Israel hatred in which Israel functions as a “collective Jew,” and collective discrimination of Israelis as rights-bearers, as exemplified in boycotts not just of Israel but of all Israeli citizens.13 According to the EUMC, “antisemitism\n\n13 The Council of Europe’s European Court of Human Rights, which is independent of the EU, declared not just boycotts against Israeli citizens but also against Israeli products as an illegal form of discrimination. It confirmed the ruling against a French\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n25\n\nis a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed towards Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” (EUMC 2005) In addition, the EUMC argues, such manifestations could also target Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity or “collective Jew” (Klug 2003). Antisemitism, the EUMC adds, frequently “charges Jews with conspiring to harm humanity, and it is often used to blame Jews for ‘why things go wrong’.” Beyond Nazi racial theories, the EUMC suggests criteria that point to various forms of stereotypes and anti-Jewish violence. They include: (a) Justifying the killing or harming of Jews in the name of a radical ideology; (b) Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective—such as the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions; (c) Denying the Holocaust; (d) Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust; (e) Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor; (f ) Applying double standards by requiring of Jews or Israel a behavior not expected by any other group or democratic nation and drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis (EUMC 2005). Thus, we can speak of antisemitism if, for instance, there are calls to or justifications of violence against Jews; if ‘the Jews’ (or the Jewish Israelis, for that matter) themselves are, as a collective, blamed for antisemitism or seen as the cause of antisemitism; if there are dehumanizing, demonizing and stereotypical claims about Jews or the collective power of ‘the Jews’—for example by suggesting that they control the media, the UN, world politics, and national governments; if the Holocaust is denied or downplayed, or if it is claimed that ‘the Jews’ or Israel have invented or exaggerated the Holocaust and they are, in turn, equated with Nazism (“Zionazis”), or if classical antisemitic symbols and images are used to characterize Jews (e.g. ritual murder, Jews as insects etc.). These criteria address a “family resemblance between these old antisemitic images and the singling out of\n\nmayor, stating that he was convicted “for inciting the commission of a discriminatory, and therefore punishable, act.” (European Court of Human Rights 2009).\n\n26\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nIsrael as uniquely evil among nations, or holding either all Israeli Jews or all world Jews collectively responsible for actions of the state of Israel, or the association of the practices of Israeli military occupation with the Nazi extermination of Jews.” (Fine 2007) As we will discuss below, one problem with these criteria and definitions is that they tend to be fixed and rigid; they seek to demarcate clear lines, and they are helpful tools for that, yet they fail to grasp the “grey zones” (Rensmann 2005; recently Milbradt 2010). The deliberate use of allusions, ambiguity and vagueness requires contextual interpretations that seek to understand anti-Jewish codes (Volkov 2006) and such “grey zones,” as well as the role they play for post-Holocaust antisemitism and climates of anti-Jewish hostility within liberal democracies in which overt hate speech is largely taboo. Be that as it may, especially the last two criteria of the EUMC definition—(e) and (f )—have drawn much controversy. As mentioned before, already conflictive political constellations have further escalated in the public discourse on “anti-Zionism” and the boundaries between criticism and anti-Jewish resentment in the perception of the Middle East conflict. Criticism of Israel and of Israeli policies similar to those leveled against any other country, to be sure, should not be regarded as antisemitic. This is a point also stressed by the EUMC. On the one hand, it is possible (as well as already practiced) to criticize Israel’s governmental policies without resorting to anti-Jewish resentments—and without being accused of antisemitism. On the other hand, it is a misleading claim that “criticism of Israel cannot be construed as antisemitic,” as the former London mayor Ken Livingston has asserted in the past (Hirsh 2007; cf. Herf 2006). Yet, for some publicists, most extreme right-wing groups, and a relevant Stalinist “anti-imperialist” section of the radical left in Europe—and beyond the continent’s shores— antisemitism today is relevant only insofar as it is seen as “a spurious charge that ‘the Zionists’ or the ‘pro-Israel lobby’ would throw at ‘critics of Israel’.” (Hirsh 2007: 73) Be that as it may, there is a broad scholarly consensus that forms of anti-Jewish hostility which utilize the nebulous concept of “the Zionists” and instrumentalize the Middle East conflict, is of increasing importance as of late (e.g. Bergmann & Welzel 2003; Cohen 2007; Haury 2000; Herf 2006; Hirsh 2007; Kloke 2007; Markovits 2007; Postone 2009). Hereby the ubiquitous pejorative use of ‘the Zionists’ does not immunize against antisemitism. In fact, the substitution of the word ‘Zionists’ for ‘Jews’ may sometimes make little substantial difference (Fine 2007). It all too often functions\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n27\n\nas stand-in for ‘the Jews’ if it is linked to other anti-Jewish resentments and if people are attacked who do not politically identify themselves as such. At issue is not, as Moishe Postone (2009) points out, “whether or not Israeli policies can be criticized. Israeli policies should be criticized, especially those aimed at undermining any possibility of a viable Palestinian state.” But an analysis of any conflict situation “ought to be intersubjective and not look to blame one side or the other independently of the context in which they operate.” (Fine 2007) A generalized ‘fight against the Zionists’, which goes beyond a critique of Israeli policies or discrimination of minorities in Israel but rejects the existence of the Jewish state (and only of the Jewish state), has little to do with conflict resolution, concern for human rights, and solidarity with the Palestinians in their plight; it can function “as a ticket for traditional hostility against Jews, while its ultimate rationale is the annihilation of Israel.” (Weiß 2005) Postone (2009) insists that also “ ‘leftist’ anti-Zionism has converged with radical Arab nationalism and radical Islamism [. . .] for whom the eliminationist impulse towards Jews in Israel is justified as being directed against ‘European’ colonizers.” Needless to say, antisemitism does nothing for Palestinians (Fine 2007). Israel is hereby often demonized as a ‘collective Jew’ among the world’s nations; for instance if the country is characterized as “grasping for global power, and by exhibiting Old Testament like vengefulness,” or if Israel is singled out as the country that “bamboozles the world, as cunning Jews are wont to do, extorts money from hapless victims, exhibits capitalist greed and [. . .] indulges in constant brutality of the weak.” (Markovits 2007: 164f ) It is antisemitic, for instance, if the critique of ‘Zionism’ attributes to Israel and ‘the Zionists’ a unique malevolence and global conspirational power, and to seek their elimination as the solution to the Middle East crises (Postone 2009). And even if we did not classify some of the most egregious examples of charges against Israel, its citizens and their right to exist as antisemitic (“child-killers”), such charges are offensive and antisemitic in effect. Moreover, images and cartoons that portray Israelis as children-eating, blood-drinking monsters—resuscitating old Christian anti-Jewish propaganda according to which Jews ritually murder children for Pesach and drink their blood or use it for making bread—are also antisemitic, though they pretend to be “criticism of Israel;” and even legal agencies in Germany, which has particularly strict hate speech laws, do not\n\n28\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nclassify them as such (for example, such ‘cartoons’ are displayed on a so-called “wailing wall” installed by political activists on Cathedral Square in Cologne). To be sure, ‘anti-Zionism’ does not have to be antisemitic in historical perspective (Herf 2006). Zionism itself was a minority movement among Jews prior to the Holocaust (Davidson 2001), though it is worthy to remember that we no longer live in a pre-Holocaust but in a post-Holocaust world—a world that had proven during the Shoah and thereafter how little it cared for stateless Jews. At any rate, conflating and confusing “politically active Zionists” or Israeli government officials with Jews in general is—just like the idea that there is an “Israeli occupation of America” (or of the European Union, for that matter) because there are some outspoken Jewish supporters of Israel in both polities—a form of pars pro toto antisemitic generalization and stereotyping, as Lawrence Davidson (2010) points out.14 It can be antisemitic to attack Jews as ‘Zionists’ if there is no detectable political context, or conversely to speak generally of ‘the Jews’ when Israel’s government is criticized. Not all Jews support Israel, or are “Zionists,” and there are several Jewish organizations that oppose Zionism without being antisemitic (while it is important to remember that just as blacks can be racist, Jews can be anti-Semitic). Nonetheless, today there is often considerable overlap between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, and the former has long lost its unambiguous political innocence: recent research has found a strong and robust association between antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment in ten Western European countries (Kaplan & Small 2006; Lieberman 2009; see also Cohen, Harber, Jussim & Bhasin 2009).15 Anti-Zionism, conceived 14 To be sure, Davidson calls into question Israel’s—and seemingly only this nationstate’s—legitimacy to exist; and he boldly claims: “what the Zionists do is actually a generator of anti-Semitism.” He is thereby following dated ethnic conflict theories about actual group behavior as the main cause of anti-Jewish or racial resentment. He also equates blatant antisemites and Holocaust deniers with defenders of Israel and “the Zionist Holocaust gambit,” as “if you will, two sides of the same coin.” Both take part, he argues, “in the mass confusion of name calling and wild accusations that have resulted,” while “it has become increasingly difficult for the audiences to whom both groups are pitching their propaganda to make any distinctions based on the actual positions taken by various constituencies.” 15 After controlling other factors, Kaplan and Small (2006) show in an empirical study of respondents in ten European countries that antisemitic resentment consistently increases with the intensity of the hostility against Israel. Respondents with strong anti-Israel attitudes are six times as likely to be antisemitic compared to respondents who do not support anti-Israel statements. Antisemitism therefore highly correlates\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n29\n\nhere as the fundamental rejection of a Jewish state and specifically the Jewish right to political self-determination, today often serves as a modernized medium to express antisemitism,16 though anti-Zionism with “anti-Zionism.” “Based on this analysis, when an individual’s criticism of Israel becomes sufficiently severe, it does become reasonable to ask whether such criticism is a mask for underlying anti-Semitism” (Kaplan & Small 2006: 560). In Germany, 28.9% somewhat agree with the statement: “If one considers Israel’s policies, I can understand if one is against Jews,” while 15.5% fully agree with the statement. An experimental study by Geissler (2002) provides findings similar to Kaplan and Small. From the point of analytic philosophy, Harrison (2006) argues that anti-Israel opinion may disseminate, however inadvertently, a range of traditional antisemitic claims and motifs. According to Harrison, such opinion restricts anti-racism to particular groups instead of defending Palestinian rights without demonizing Jews. Be that as it may: While there may be ‘anti-Zionists’ who are not antisemites, just as there are foes of affirmative action who are not racists, “the crucial question is prejudicial overlap.” (Cohen 2007). 16 Israeli policies, such as potential human rights violations, are and should be subject to public scrutiny and criticism. Yet such criticism should follow the same or similar standards that apply to other democratic and non-democratic governments. In the global age, all governments and nation-states should not just be exposed to national but also to global public scrutiny. However, “anti-Zionism” as an ideological system that specifically singles out Israel and denies Jewish political self-determination, tends to violate this universal principle by stigmatizing the Jewish state alone, while simultaneously defending, denying or downplaying human rights violations by repressive regimes in the region and elsewhere, including violent acts against Palestinians committed by Hamas or others. One of many cases in point is the fact that most radically “anti-Zionist” groups remained silent across the board when it became public that Jordan had stripped 3,000 Palestinians of their citizenship rights over the last years, thereby creating a new mass of stateless people (cf. Gavlek 2010). There are four sufficiently tested indicators to effectively distinguish criticism of Israel from antisemitic hatred of Israel, where Israel is viewed as a “collective Jew;” to be sure, diffuse ‘grey zones’ that blur these boundaries remain. Attacks on Israel can be regarded as antisemitic if they match one of the following conditions: a) the demonization of Israel is viewed as reincarnation of Nazism, or the atrocities of the Holocaust are equated with actual or perceived human rights violations in Israel, suggesting that the Jewish state produces a “new Holocaust” and “racist apartheid state” (Hirsh 2007: 40); b) traditional antiJewish stereotypes are employed when Israel is discussed, e.g. the image of the ruthless, war-mongering or vengeful Jew/Israeli, or the identification of Israelis with “Christ-killers,” “baby-killers,” or ritual murderers; c) the complete delegitimation of Israel’s right of existence, i.e. the denial of a Jewish right of self-determination in the only Jewish state in the world; d) the singling out of the Jewish state and the obvious use of double standards, for instance by seeing Israel as a fundamentally war-mongering collective and by attacking its “ethnic nationalism” while glorifying the ethnic nationalism of other groups (in the region), and while human rights violations, dictatorships, and antisemitism are downplayed or portrayed as “peaceful” or if blatant antisemitism and antisemitic violence against Jews are portrayed as justified “reactions to Israel’s state terrorism,” thereby suggesting that actual Jewish or Israeli behavior causes antisemitism. In such variants of anti-Israel resentment and Holocaust relativization, a projective and distorted picture of Israel is painted in which Israel embodies the stereotypical image of an evil, monolithic, generalized Jew. As Hirsh points out, those perceptions of “Zionism” that insinuate “Zionism” would refer to a\n\n30\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\nas a coded form of antisemitism is not new but can be traced back to Stalinism. Experimental studies show that radical anti-Zionism also strongly correlates with racism, including resentments against Muslims, Arabs, and Palestinians (Geissler 2002). Therefore it does not imply genuine support of or interest in the Palestinians. In general, the regional Israeli-Palestinian conflict often appears to serve as a projective matrix for problems and conflicts of contemporary European immigration societies. Yet, publicized events and conflict escalations in the Middle East can be used to stir or enhance anti-Jewish acts, though they evidently do not cause antisemitic thought.17 Zones of Acquiescence: Manifest and Latent Resentments in Liberal Democracies In addition, we differentiate between manifest and latent forms of antisemitism. Sophisticated research designs recognize that antisemitism does not start with neo-Nazis and actors who openly declare to be antisemites. There is a broad consensus among researchers that antisemitism neither starts with full-fledged ideologies of racial antisemitism, nor with manifest hate crimes. We often encounter more latent and subtle forms in public communication and in attitudes towards Jews. While manifest forms make open generalizations about “the Jews” or overtly attack Jews as Jews, latent communication mobilizes anti-Jewish stereotypes by means of innuendo, allusive speech, and codes. Demagogues often utilize and play with ambivalences, and then deny the charge of antisemitism or racism (Lowenthal 1987b). They deliberatively articulate the “rumors about the Jews” (Adorno 1955) by employing innuendo, which leaves much room for interpretation; the listeners know to what and whom it is referred to. As mentioned before, liberal-democratic societies put restrictions on overt expressions of antisemitism, by legal means and/or by the\n\nhomogenous ideology, group and entity across time and political division are problematic (Hirsh 2007: 7). 17 Contrary to claims by some scholars and publicists, Jewish or Israeli behavior cannot cause (or justify) antisemitism, which is a matrix of distorted perceptions, just as the behavior of—let’s say an African—dictator cannot cause (or justify) racism against blacks. In fact, it is itself an antisemitic or racist concept to seek the causes of group and minority discrimination in the actual behavior of groups or minorities. Prejudice does not derive from actual behavior of members of a group. However, events in the Middle East or Africa can be used in antisemitic or racist discourses and be utilized to facilitate existing stereotypes.\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n31\n\n­ iscursive public scope or “zone of acquiescence” (Norris 2005: 20) d that defines the boundaries of democratic legitimacy of public statements and actors. In many ways, today we can speak of an “antisemitism without antisemites” (Marin 2000) simply because even neo-Nazis deny that they are antisemites—a charge which discredits political outreach and social recognition in Europe and beyond. In reaction to these boundaries, even apparent forms of hate speech often adapt to democratic conditions and become more coded. For example, in some cases old anti-Jewish stereotypes are simply replaced by less suspicious code words; such as substituting “the Jews” by “the globalists,” “the mondialists,” “the Zionists,” “the American East Coast” or, in a Stalinist and nationalist tradition, the “cosmopolites” (Cohen 2007). None of these terms automatically imply antisemitism. Yet, in certain contexts these words can function as proxies for overt tirades about “the Jews” (Cohen 2007; Haury 2002; Kloke 2007; Iganski/ Kosmin 2006). For instance, “the “American East Coast” has been used as a code for the alleged “power of the Jews,” and the term “the Jewish lobby” might not just refer to actual Jewish lobbyists, interests, and lawmakers in Brussels or Washington. It may also deliberately mobilize fantasies about an allegedly ‘powerful global Jewish network’ or world-dominating conspiracy behind major conflicts, wars, international institutions and governments. In such cases, among the most reliable criteria to evaluate if Jews are essentialized in an antisemitic fashion—or if we are faced, to the contrary, with a rational argument about specific political actors and actions—is the simultaneous existence or absence of traditional anti-Jewish stereotypes. Yet, interpretative ambiguities will remain; any classification reflects a conceptual continuum, and researcher needs to make transparent decisions where to draw the line when examining the heterogeneous, “changing faces” of antisemitism (Laqueur 2006). The Concept of Modernized Antisemitism Research designs also need to take into account that the ‘antisemitic imagination’ may discursively respond to changing terms, political issues and conflicts. We do not believe that there is any ‘eternal antisemitism.’ Anti-Jewish resentment is subject to changes over time. This refers to its forms, its functions, and its relevance. We therefore conceptualize new and coded forms of anti-Jewish resentment as modernized antisemitism (Rensmann 2004a). We prefer this term instead of the\n\n32\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\ncontested concept of ‘new antisemitism.’ The latter refers to new phenomena in which we may find disguised forms of antisemitism—such as the subtle identification of Jews as the string-pullers of multi-national capital or ‘globalism.’ It is suggested that these elements ideologically unite the extreme right, some parts of the radical left, and radical Islamists (Taguieff 2004; Iganski & Kosmin 2006). While such ideological convergences point to certain changing political constellations (see below), some scholars claim that the term ‘new antisemitism’ overemphasizes the novel character of re-articulated old resentments and falsely suggests a new quality. Others have argued that the “new” label is effectively erroneous as it fuses supposedly leftist and “Muslim” antisemitism into one entity when they are not necessarily always linked (Peace 2009). Our concept of modernized antisemitism, however, addresses the link between contemporary and past articulations of anti-Jewish resentment in Europe and beyond while simultaneously accounting for variations; the matrix of antisemitism and its imagery are not new. We also prefer the term “modernized antisemitism” because it illuminates the connection rather than the distinctions between manifest and latent forms that take shape in reaction to liberal-democratic and cosmopolitan conditions. Analogous to the well-established theory of neo-racism and “cultural racism,” which has developed critical tools to decipher new forms of “racism without races” (Balibar & Wallerstein 1990; Taguieff 2000), research needs to respond to changing forms and coded articulations of anti-Jewish hostility, and thus develop critical methods accordingly. Similar to coded or ‘cultural racism,’ it is part of the modernization of antisemitism to ‘culturalize’ racist antisemitism and employ subtle forms of collective exclusion without openly blaming ‘the Jews’ or ‘the Jewish race.’ By developing critical methods over years, racism research is far more advanced in understanding and illuminating various forms of ethnic minority exclusion under the veil of democratic and universalistic public discourse. Antisemitism research is largely lagging behind in this area. While it is important to avoid inflationary applications of ‘racism’ and ‘antisemitism,’ research on anti-Jewish phenomena also needs to further develop experimental methods to identify subtle stereotypes, their functions, and explain causal mechanisms. The authors of this volume seek to break new ground in this direction. No matter how much trouble this may cause for standardized long-term time series, it is important\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n33\n\nto recall that neither antisemitic forms nor manifestations, functions or criteria for their analysis are fixed; they are socially embedded and changing. They are context-dependent and need to be continuously re-constructed in the research process. Consequently, more sophisticated research tools also need to take “socially desirable” behavior and norms into account when designing and conducting surveys, as well as discourse or content analyses. This also applies to the secondary analysis of survey data and to the interpretation of public communication. For instance, it appears insufficient to us to simply ask in a survey if the respondent agrees to the statement that “more than others, Jews work with dirty tricks to achieve their goals” (Brähler & Decker 2008: 21). Even in anonymous surveys respondents are less likely to agree if the question points to publicly discredited antisemitic stereotypes in such a blatant and immediately recognizable way. It can be expected that few respondents will agree, and then antisemitism automatically appears rather irrelevant. Although some research suggests that public manifestations of anti-Jewish hatred have generally become more aggressive, outspoken, and open, we still need to refine our methods and measures to understand latent and less blatant resentments in the European electorate and in public spheres. Further, we need to understand the interplay of demand side and supply side factors. Utilizing the notion of “new politics of resentment,” a concept introduced by Hans-Georg Betz’ landmark work on radical-right populist parties in the 1990s (Betz 1993), we locate new mobilizations of resentment in the broader context of ‘anti-modern’ counter-cosmopolitan discontent. Yet, we also stress that antisemitism is a specific phenomenon and ‘undercurrent’ that plays particular roles in (post)modern societies and their cultural legacies. The Concept of Counter-Cosmopolitanism While the authors in this book explore multi-faceted models to explain the conditions of the presumed resurgence of antisemitism, we situate antisemitism also in the broader context of what Kwame Anthony Appiah (2007) has aptly called counter-cosmopolitanism. We conceive counter-cosmopolitanism as the generalized particularistic rejection of cosmopolitan inclusiveness, recognition of plurality, cultural diversity, obligations to strangers, or loyalties to humankind. Counter-\n\n34\n\nlars rensmann and julius h. schoeps\n\ncosmopolitan orientations claim national, religious, or cultural superiority over non-nationalized or non-religious rights entitlements or indivisible human rights based on universal equality, freedom, and solidarity. Counter-cosmopolitanism, to be sure, does not necessarily imply narrow nationalisms or regionalisms. Counter-cosmopolitan Islamist fundamentalists, in fact, employ their own version of global outreach, global justice, and “globalism” (Steger 2008). Distinct from the critique of actual globalization or of global injustices based on universal human rights, which are driven by inclusive cosmopolitan norms and claims, however, counter-cosmopolitanism points to the fundamental opposition to any socio-cultural modernization and cosmopolitan diversity. It rejects the universality of human rights. The latter are modern, non-traditionalist norms and patterns that traditionally have been embodied by Jews. In the historical European imagination they were perceived as the cosmopolitan ‘pariahs of nations.’ We do not argue that resurgent antisemitism can be reduced to or fully explained by counter-cosmopolitanism. But it can also be conceptualized as a radical form of counter-cosmopolitanism with which, we argue, it consistently marches in step in postmodern times. Hatred towards cosmopolitan cultural change, diversity, and modernity, especially relevant in times of rapid transformations, can be viewed as a factor contributing to antisemitic personifications of this very process. While both antisemitism and counter-cosmopolitan discontent should not be equated, it is our hypothesis that there are also aspects of historical and contemporary convergence and overlap. We argue that antisemitism is a specific, distinct phenomenon that differs from other racisms in its forms and functions. Yet, it should also be situated in and explained by the broader context of counter-cosmopolitanism, which experiences a rise in reaction to the multi-faceted globalization of societies. Accordingly, both antisemitism and counter-cosmopolitanism can be understood as anti-modern formations that are part of modernity. They do not originate, or are directly caused by, post-industrial globalization and concurring cosmopolitan transformations of society but constitute cultural perceptions thereof. Modern antisemitism attributes to ‘the Jews’ or ‘the Zionists’ the perceived evils of contemporary cosmopolitanization, and cosmopolitan modernity: they are, and have traditionally been perceived, as the embodiment of cosmopolitan universalists who, behind the goal of the\n\npolitics and resentment\n\n35\n\n‘destruction’ of national, ethnic and religious communities, advance their own particularistic cause:18 they are seen as global ‘string-pullers’ 18 The counter-argument that “Zionism” is always attacked solely for the reason that it is an “ethnonationalist ideology and, as such, contradicts the universalistic logic of the socialist and liberal left” (Beller 2007b) is rather simplistic. It is not persuasive for several reasons. First, this does not explain why ‘Zionism’ and Israel have become such major targets of the extreme right, for which ethnic nationalism and nativism are core ideologies (Mudde 2003; 2007). If opposition to ‘Zionism’ documents a universalistic logic, why does the decidedly anti-universalistic extreme right view Israel and ‘the Zionists’ as main enemies and continuously target them in mobilizations and campaigns? Rather, as Fine (2007) argues, only a self-reflective, critical eye on antisemitism within the left that is reflective towards its own premises “opens the space for criticism to be based on universal grounds rather than on some racist, nationalist or other particularistic premise.” Second, throughout its history, many parts of the socialist and liberal left have also supported and endorsed “national liberation” struggles, collective particularism and territorial sovereignty based on national identity including, most significantly, Palestinian national liberation struggles and other forms of ethnic or religious political self-determination. Until this day, many Stalinist groups and Communist parties have outright rejected post-nationalism and cosmopolitanism as mere ‘capitalist ideologies’. While there is a relevant cosmopolitan left today, there are also left-wing nationalists and counter-cosmopolitans who strongly defend nationalism and national labor protectionism against more inclusive political organizations, human rights claims, or cosmopolitan solidarity. However, such “left-wing” support of ethnic nationalism and cultural essentialism often overlooks the diversity and multiplicity of conflicts and interests in Israeli and Palestinian societies. Third, Beller overlooks the striking fact that in many cases (the Jewish state of ) Israel seems to be the only case where a rigidly “universalistic logic” is applied that is not sensitive to the negotiation of cultural difference, while, for instance, post-national, post-ethnic and post-religious claims to reorganize political communities are not raised in relation to any of the neighboring countries in the region. Subjecting Jews, and only Jews, to universalistic demands and aspirations while supporting cultural and religious particularism elsewhere may risk to turn the “universalistic logic” into its opposite: a particularistic logic that applies human and collective rights selectively. Human rights claims now tend to be invoked by both extreme right and radical left anti-Zionists when it comes the Middle East conflict. Simultaneously, the latter’s allegedly universalistic bases of their fundamental opposition to Israel’s existence are often difficult to identify. Universalism does not distinguish between victims of human rights violations, which are indivisible, no matter if they are committed by Israel, Hamas, or in Darfur; it also does not distinguish between good essentialisms and bad ones. Fourth, Beller ignores that in those cases when “the Zionists” are publicly attacked, it is often not (only) about the state of Israel but about the rejection of any transnational or cosmopolitan agency: “the Zionists” tend to be identified as operating through global lobbies and networks, international institutions, global media and international banks. Fifth, the very classification of “Zionism” as an “ethnonationalist ideology” displays a rather monolithic and indeed oversimplified view of the various political movements an"
