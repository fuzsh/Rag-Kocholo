        "text": "The period before leagues begin in late summer is used by Europe’s mega-clubs to tour the world looking for new fans and sponsors at the expense of the environment. New research for Play the Game reveals the extent of this extensive travelling and its significant carbon footprint.\n\nOf the 12 clubs that proposed to form a European Super League, 10 will leave Europe for preseason games and fly hundreds of thousands of kilometres to North America and Asia to play money-spinning friendlies that earn them sizeable sums and cost fans a fortune.\n\nTable 1: Travelling this summer by Europe's biggest club for friendlies\n\nClub\n\nCountries visited\n\nOverseas games\n\nAC Milan\n\nAustria, Italy, USA\n\n5\n\nArsenal\n\nUSA\n\n3\n\nAtletico Madrid\n\nHong Kong, Sweden\n\n2\n\nBarcelona\n\nUSA\n\n3\n\nChelsea\n\nUSA\n\n4\n\nInter Milan\n\nUK\n\n1\n\nJuventus\n\nGermany, Sweden\n\n2\n\nLiverpool\n\nUSA\n\n3\n\nManchester City\n\nUSA\n\n4\n\nManchester United\n\nNorway, USA\n\n4\n\nReal Madrid\n\nUSA\n\n3\n\nTottenham\n\nJapan, South Korea\n\n3\n\nIn 2018, the Relevant Sports Group paid clubs which took part in the International Champions Cup as much 3.25 million US dollars per match according to Der Spiegel which bases the number on information from Football Leaks. Summer tours can now earn clubs 10 million US dollars or more.\n\nSince then, the value of overseas TV rights for most major European leagues has stalled in Europe and clubs are looking further afield to drive growth through playing friendlies that can cost overseas fans eye-watering sums.\n\nThis summer, half of the potential ESL clubs are playing in the Soccer Champions Tour in the USA, where a backstage tour pass can cost up to 3,540 US dollars and Meet and Greet tickets can cost up to 5,000 GBP – for a non-competitive game featuring multiple substitutions.\n\nFlights to the US generate a huge carbon footprint that conflicts with the attempts by the clubs to present an environmentally sustainable image. Calculations by the BBC suggest that preseason travelling to the US this summer by both Chelsea and Manchester United will each generate around 200 tonnes of CO2, which is the equivalent of 500,000 miles driven by an average petrol car. This is based on travelling parties of 30 people in business class.\n\nMatch agents told Play the Game that big clubs can take more than 80 people on some tours, which can include journalists.\n\nGap in elite football between what clubs say and do\n\nEnglish club Tottenham Hotspur is a signatory of the UN Sports for Climate Action Framework and recently achieved ISO 20121, which is an important international standard for sustainable event management. Yet, the club travelled further than any other member of the putative ESL this summer with visits to Japan and South Korea.\n\nThis contradiction of clubs travelling around the world in preseason has drawn criticism from environmental campaign groups, such as the Cool Down Sport for Climate Action Network.\n\n“There is a growing gap in elite football between what clubs say they are going to do to tackle the climate crisis and their actions. When it comes to preseason friendlies, this gap is a chasm,” said the Network’s Freddie Daley, who is an academic at the University of Sussex.\n\n“European giants flying vast distances by plane to play preseason friendlies, in shirts emblazoned with the logos of high-carbon companies, puts pressure on both players and the planet. In a carbon-constrained world, where extreme heat and floods are already pulling apart football’s infrastructures, the unerring drive for expansion must be reassessed.\"\n\n“Within football and beyond it, actions speak louder than words. If elite clubs are serious about protecting their players, fans and the future of football, they need to say less and do more.”\n\nSpurs told Play the Game that it aims to travel as sustainably as possible, saying:\n\n“This includes minimising air travel, with team officials and delegates travelling on the team plane. During the season, the team will travel by coach for all distances under 2.5 hours, whereby player physical optimisation and performance is not compromised as a result.”\n\nThe club said it measures travel emissions to try and reduce emissions and works with Destination Sport Travel to offset emissions “where possible” by buying carbon credits verified by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Play the Game asked Spurs how many people travelled with the club for overseas friendlies but did not get a reply.\n\nA long history of preseason pollution\n\nThe carbon footprint being blazed across the planet by the proposed ESL clubs is not new. Research for Play the Game identified 653 preseason games played by the 12 ESL clubs between 2014 and 2023. 412 team involvements (63 per cent) were played overseas.\n\nMost of this preseason travelling over the past decade has been outside of Europe, which creates a significantly larger footprint as it involves air travel. Out of 412 overseas games, 262 were played in Asia or North America, which is 40 per cent of all preseason games.\n\nMost games in North America took place in the US where Real Madrid and Manchester United each played 24 games. That represents 56 and 45 per cent of each club’s respective preseason matches, as the two sides took part in money-spinning games aimed at growing their commercial revenue.\n\nThe organisers of the proposed ESL told Play the Game that they did not have any policies about offsetting their potential member clubs’ extensive travel in preseason.\n\nWhen these clubs did play games at home, their opponents often travelled from overseas. Just 26 per cent of the preseason games played by ESL clubs over the last decade were at home and against clubs from their own country. Manchester City and Barcelona have played just seven and eight games respectively at home against British and Spanish clubs in the last decade.\n\nIn half of the last 10 preseasons, Real Madrid have not even played a game in Spain and only once in that decade has the club played another Spanish team. In 2020, COVID-19 decimated preseason arrangements and Real’s sole preseason match was against Madrid neighbours Getafe.\n\nPreseason environmental damage\n\nMany clubs play games in other clubs in Europe as part of training camps, whereas games further afield are invariably part of commercial arrangements aimed at increasing commercial revenue and engaging with overseas fans.\n\nThis has produced a plethora of preseason competitions that have little meaning outside of corporate boxes. Who remembers the Casinò Lugano Cup, the Chevrolet Cup or the Coupang Play Series? Yet these competitions have attracted some of Europe’s biggest clubs.\n\n“Teams that take off around the world on big-polluting preseason tours are threatening the safety of the players and communities they ultimately rely on,” Peter Crisp from the campaign group Fossil Free Football told Play the Game.\n\n“They are disregarding both the grave welfare concerns of overstretched players and the threat that is already posed by fossil-fuelled extreme weather.\"\n\n“The dangerous ‘business as usual’ mentality and endless push for more matches must give way to governance that is realistic about the obvious physical limits of players and the planet. It is time for top clubs to show real leadership by cutting their pollution to safeguard the future of football,” said Crisp.\n\nManchester City has the most extensive preseason carbon footprint\n\nManchester City has not been short of titles over the past decade and the club has a new one as the side with the most extensive carbon footprint generated from preseason travel.\n\nResearch for Play the Game found that more than three quarters of preseason games played by Manchester City between 2014 and last summer were played outside of Europe.\n\nOverall, this research found 19 leading European clubs – some potential ESL members, others not – that had played 10 or more preseason games outside of the continent in the past decade. Only 30 per cent of preseason games played by these clubs were at home against clubs from their own country.\n\nAmong the 19 clubs travelling the most, 56 per cent of their overseas games were in neutral venues, like the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia. These showpiece games in neutral venues create an even bigger carbon footprint, as both clubs taking part have travelled from another country.\n\nLast summer, for example, Spurs and Premier League rivals West Ham both flew more than 14,000 kilometres to Perth in Australia to play a friendly, while Manchester City played Atletico Madrid in the Coupang Play Series in the South Korean capital of Seoul, which is nearly 9,000 kilometres from the club’s home base.\n\nTable 2: Europe's biggest travelling clubs in pre-season\n\nClub Total friendlies Overseas matches Total outside Europe % of all preseason games Manchester City 36 30 25 69 Manchester United 53 40 33 62 Real Madrid 43 38 26 60 Arsenal 51 33 23 45 Barcelona 47 29 20 43 Juventus 54 29 22 41 Paris Saint Germain 53 35 21 40 Chelsea 50 37 19 38 Tottenham Hotspur 45 29 17 38 Bayern Munich 64 24 23 36 Liverpool 70 46 25 36 Atletico Madrid 55 32 17 31 Inter Milan 80 35 19 24 Sevilla 67 46 15 22 AC Milan 72 38 16 22 Roma 69 38 15 22 Borussia Dortmund 65 27 14 22 Crystal Palace 58 19 12 21 Newcastle Utd 60 24 10 17\n\nPremier League the worst offender among leagues\n\nNot surprisingly, as the world’s richest club football competition, the English Premier League is the worst offender for extensive preseason travel.\n\nThere have been a dozen trips by Premier League clubs to Australia and New Zealand in preseason over the last decade and 230 games played outside of Europe, which is over 20 per cent of all games contested. One or more Premier League clubs travelled to Australia or New Zealand every preseason from 2014 to 2019.\n\nSince long-haul preseason travel resumed in 2022, four clubs have been to Australia in preseason. Tottenham Hotspur even went again at the end of the 2023/24 Premier League season as did Newcastle. Both clubs used private jets.\n\nTable 3: Europe's Big 5 Leagues in Pre-season\n\nLeague Total friendlies % overseas % in neutral locations % all games outside Europe Premier League 1.125 45,8 22,3 20,4 La Liga 1.339 39,4 10,7 8,4 Serie A 1.218 33,2 14,3 6,9 Bundesliga 1.244 31,5 16,0 4,4 Ligue 1 1.107 31,2 7,5 3,0\n\nFrench clubs play closer to home\n\nPreseason activities by leading French clubs are likely to have the smallest environmental impact. The research found that 31 per cent of preseason games by Ligue 1 clubs are played outside France and just 3 per cent outside Europe, which is the lowest ratio amongst Europe’s Big Five leagues. French clubs often play warm-up games at smaller stadia inside France before starting league matches.\n\nAlthough 39 per cent of preseason games played by Bundesliga clubs were outside Germany, many clubs play games in neighbouring Austria, where travel is often by coach rather than plane. Across the last decade, at least a dozen or more of the 18 Bundesliga clubs went to Austria every season. The exception was 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts data on travel\n\nThe data underlying this research includes the year 2020 where the impact of COVID-19 drastically reduced international travel including travel by football clubs.\n\nIn 2020, no La Liga clubs played any preseason games outside of Spain, while Liverpool’s two games in Austria were the only matches played by Premier League clubs outside of Britain. Single matches in Switzerland and Slovenia by Verona and Inter Milan were the only foreign trips by Serie A teams.\n\nThe disruptions caused by COVID-19 to preseason preparations continued for more than one season, partly due to healthcare restrictions, but also because the disruptions meant that league fixtures took longer to complete or start.\n\nThis makes the overall travelling by these clubs look less extensive than it would have been, as long-haul trips - such as West Ham’s trip to Australia in 2020 - were cancelled due to COVID-19.\n\nIn reality, the amount of games played outside of Europe is probably 10-20 per cent below what clubs would have played if COVID-19 had not occurred.\n\nHardly any preseason matches are played in Africa\n\nIn the summer of 1992, prior to the launch of the Premier League, 75 (44 per cent) of the 172 preseason games were played overseas, but only Crystal Palace and Sheffield Wednesday ventured outside of Europe – both to South Africa.\n\nBut while European football’s fanbase has exploded across Africa in recent decades, European teams have all but ignored its neighbour to the south.\n\nAfrica is a relatively short distance. Countries in North Africa such as Tunisia and Morocco, co-host of the 2030 FIFA World Cup with Spain and Portugal, can even be reached by boat from France, Italy and Spain. However, over the last decade just nine of more than 6,000 preseason team involvements by clubs from Europe’s Big Five leagues have been in Africa.\n\nIt makes a lie of the clubs’ mantra that preseason tours are about connecting with supporters around the world. The real motivation is collecting foreign currency.\n\nPremier League response\n\nAs the competition with the largest number of major clubs travelling long-haul in preseason, Play the Game asked the English Premier League if it provided advice to its clubs on how to reduce their carbon footprint or offset emissions caused by extensive preseason travel.\n\nThe Premier League would not comment directly, but said there is no central mandate on travel, which is left to individual clubs to plan.\n\nThe Premier League pointed out that during the first quarter of 2022, its clubs took 59 domestic flights, which was just 0.079% of all UK domestic flights, but this travelling was to fulfil competitive matches rather than money-spinning friendlies. When Play the Game asked again for a comment on the clubs’ extensive preseason travel, the Premier League said: “We don’t have any further comment.”\n\nIn February 2024, Premier League clubs signed up to an Environmental Sustainability Commitment, which included four operational measures. These included appointing a senior club employee to develop sustainability advice, developing a ‘robust’ environmental sustainability policy by the end of the 2024/25 season and supporting a common framework for action via the Premier League Sustainability Working Group (PLSWG).\n\nClubs also agreed to work towards a standardised football-wide approach to measuring emissions. No date was set on this commitment but clubs did agree to produce a greenhouse gas emissions dataset (scope 1, 2 and 3) by the end of the 2025/26 season. Scope 3 would be likely to cover the environmental impact of preseason travel.\n\nBack on the road\n\nWith health restrictions now gone, the Premier League’s clubs are back travelling én masse. Ten of the competition’s 20 clubs will go to North America, while another three teams will fly to Japan and South Korea, all with sizable parties of players, officials and backroom staff, travelling thousands of miles on jet planes.\n\nAs European football’s biggest clubs continue their relentless search for more fans, more sponsors and more money, the environment is paying the price."
