Sweden completed their Group B campaign at the Arena Nord in Frederikshavn unbeaten, overcoming Slovakia 19-2, Switzerland 9-6 and Germany 13-1.

At the semi-final stage they faced Finland, edging past their opponents 12-10.

They faced Switzerland in a repeat of a match-up from the group stage and had to survive a late Swiss fight back before being crowned champions.

In the third-place match Finland ran out narrow 7-6 victors against the Czech Republic.

The tournament attracted a record number of spectators throughout the event, with 18,316 watching across all the matches, surpassing the 16,477 who attended the edition in Hamburg in Germany in 2013.

"Congratulations to the new world champions Sweden, congratulations to the Danish national team, and congratulations to floorball," said Floorball Denmark President Steen Houman.

"A huge thanks to everyone who supported as spectators or all our volunteers.

"The Menâ€™s U19 World Floorball Championships will give our organisation valuable experience to fulfil our ambition for Floorball Denmark to host international senior championships.

"Without our trusted partners Sport Event Denmark, Arena Nord and Frederikshavn Municipality we would not have been able to stage the event."
