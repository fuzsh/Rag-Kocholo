        "text": "Progeny of King Christian IX\n\nKing Christian IX of Denmark (April 8, 1818 – January 29, 1906) ruled Denmark from 1863 to 1906. Known as the \"father-in-law of Europe\",[1] he and his queen consort, Louise of Hesse-Kassel (September 7, 1817 – September 29, 1898), became the ancestors of many members of European royalty. Some of these descendants would later rule as monarchs over several European countries, including Greece, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The families of Christian and Louise, their children, and their grandchildren are described below.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nKing Christian IX\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the first 13 years of his life, Christian lived in Germany.[1] Following the death of his father, Friedrich Wilhelm, in 1831, Christian trained as an officer in Copenhagen. He fought on behalf of the Danish Unitary State in the First Schleswig War.[2]\n\nIn 1852, Christian became the heir presumptive to the Danish throne. Following the death of King Frederick VII 11 years later, Christian became King of Denmark.[1] Due to Christian's German background, he was unpopular among his subjects during the start of his reign.[2] He nearly abdicated in 1864 after Denmark's loss in the Second Schleswig War. However, Christian's popularity recovered as his children married into several European royal families.[1]\n\nQueen Louise\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel, Louise became Queen of Denmark in 1863. Because her mother was a sister of King Christian VIII, Louise's marriage to Christian IX was an important factor in his rise to the Danish throne. Moreover, Louise was instrumental in marrying her children across European royalty, which helped increase her husband's popularity among the Danish people.[3]\n\nAs Queen of Denmark, Louise exemplified the female ideas of her time. Despite remaining in the shadow of Christian, she showed artistic and social talent. Through her charity work, Louise founded the Diakonissestiftelsen in Copenhagen.[3]\n\nMarriage\n\n[edit]\n\nChristian and Louise were married in 1842.[2][3][4]\n\nFamily of Christian IX, King of Denmark Portrait Descendants Christian IX, King of Denmark r. 1863–1906[5] April 8, 1818[6] January 29, 1906[5] 6 children,[3] including:\n\nFrederick VIII, King of Denmark[3]\n\nAlexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom[3]\n\nGeorge I, King of the Hellenes[3]\n\nMaria Feodorovna, Empress of Russia[3]\n\nPrincess Louise of Hesse-Kassel September 7, 1817[4] September 29, 1898[4]\n\nChildren\n\n[edit]\n\nKing Christian IX, together with Queen Louise, had six children: Frederick, Alexandra, George, Dagmar, Thyra, and Valdemar.[3] Because of the strained finances and limited fortunes that Christian and Louise had before 1852, they were actively involved in the education of Dagmar and her siblings during that time.[7] Later, from 1875 to 1900, Christian and Louise would annually welcome their children and grandchildren across six different European royal houses at Fredensborg Palace in Denmark.[8]\n\nWithin Christian and Louise's family, Thyra was called the \"gentle and good daughter\" by her father. In addition, Alexandra and Dagmar were respectively seen as the \"pretty\" and \"clever\" girls.[9] In contrast, Christian rejected Frederick, then Crown Prince of Denmark, because of their contrasting conservative and reformist mindsets, respectively.[10] Furthermore, Christian had reservations about George becoming King of the Hellenes after the Greeks elected the latter to be their monarch, seeing the country's throne as a doubtful proposition. Nevertheless, George successfully persuaded his father and assumed the Greek throne in 1863.[11] This influenced Valdemar's decision to decline an offer for the Bulgarian throne in 1878. He did not want to risk going to war with his brother George, given the relations between Bulgaria and Greece at the time.[12]\n\nFamily tree of King Christian IX and Queen Louise[13]\n\nChristian IX of DenmarkLouise of Hesse-Kassel Frederick VIII of Denmark2 other children Edward VIIAlexandra of DenmarkGeorge I of GreeceOlga Constantinovna of RussiaMaria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)Alexander III of Russia\n\nChildren of Christian IX, King of Denmark\n\nPortrait\n\nFrederick VIII, King of Denmark r. 1906[10]–1912[14] June 3, 1843[15] May 14, 1912[10] Married 1869, Princess Louise of Sweden[10] (1851–1926)[16]\n\n8 children (including Christian X, King of Denmark and Haakon VII, King of Norway)[10]\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Denmark December 1, 1844[17] November 20, 1925[17] Married 1863, Edward VII, King of the United Kingdom[17] (1841–1910; r. 1901–1910)[18]\n\n6 children (including George V, King of the United Kingdom and Maud, Queen of Norway)[17]\n\nGeorge I, King of the Hellenes r. 1863–1913[19] December 24, 1845[11] March 18, 1913[11] Married 1867, Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia[19] (1851–1926)[20]\n\n8 children (including Constantine I, King of the Hellenes)[20]\n\nPrincess Dagmar of Denmark November 26, 1847[7] October 13, 1928[7] Married 1866, Alexander III, Emperor of Russia[21] (1845–1894;[21] r. 1881–1894[7])\n\n6 children (including Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia)[7]\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark September 29, 1853[22] February 26, 1933[23] Married[9] 1878, Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover[9] (1845–1923)[22]\n\n6 children[9] (including Alexandra, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick)[22][a]\n\nPrince Valdemar of Denmark October 27, 1858[11] January 14, 1939[11] Married 1885, Princess Marie of Orléans[12] (1865–1909)[25]\n\n5 children[12]\n\nGrandchildren\n\n[edit]\n\nChristian IX and Louise had forty grandchildren via eight children of Frederick VIII,[10] six children of Alexandra,[17] seven children of George I,[19][b] six children of Dagmar,[7] six children of Thyra,[9][a] and five children of Valdemar.[12]\n\nChildren of Frederick VIII and Louise\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the age of 17, Princess Louise of Sweden became engaged to King Frederick VIII of Denmark, then called Frederick, Crown Prince of Denmark, at Bäckaskog Castle in Sweden. Frederick and Louise would later marry in 1869 in Stockholm.[16] This marriage took place in the context of a desire for a Scandinavian union in both Denmark and Sweden.[27]\n\nTogether, Frederick and Louise had eight children.[10][16] Two of these children, Christian and Haakon, became King of Denmark and King of Norway, respectively.[10][27] Frederick and Louise's family came to be defined by Louise's piety. Moreover, Louise oversaw the strictly disciplined education of her children.[27]\n\nOver time, Frederick and Louise's marriage became a reasonably happy one.[27] However, because of Frederick's estrangement from his father,[10][27] he and his wife kept their distance from his relatives. In addition, Louise had difficult relationships with her in-laws in the Danish royal family.[27]\n\nChildren of Frederick VIII, King of Denmark Portrait Christian X, King of Denmark r. 1912–1947[14] September 26, 1870[14] April 20, 1947[14] Married 1898, Duchess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1879–1952) and had 2 children:[14]\n\nFrederik IX, King of Denmark[14] (1899–1972;[28] r. 1947–1972[29])\n\nFather of Margrethe II, Queen of Denmark and Anne-Marie, Queen of the Hellenes[29]\n\nKnud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark[14] (1900–1976)[30]\n\nHaakon VII, King of Norway r. 1905–1957[31] August 3, 1872[31] September 21, 1957[31] Married 1896, Princess Maud of Wales (1869–1938) and had 1 child:[31]\n\nOlav V, King of Norway (1903[31]–1991; r. 1957–1991)[32]\n\nFather of Harald V, King of Norway[32]\n\nPrincess Louise of Denmark February 17, 1875[11] April 4, 1906[11] Married 1896, Prince Frederick of Schaumburg-Lippe (1868–1945) and had 3 children:[11]\n\nPrincess Marie Louise of Schaumburg-Lippe (1897–1938)[11]\n\nPrince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe (1898–1974)[11]\n\nPrincess Stephanie of Schaumburg-Lippe (1899–1925)[11]\n\nPrince Harald of Denmark October 8, 1876[11] March 30, 1949[11] Married 1909, Princess Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1888–1962) and had 5 children:[11]\n\nPrincess Feodora of Denmark (1910–1975)[11]\n\nPrincess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark (1912–1995)[33]\n\nPrincess Alexandrine-Louise of Denmark (1914–1962)[11]\n\nPrince Gorm of Denmark (1919[11]–1992)[34]\n\nPrince Oluf of Denmark (1923[11]–1990)[34]\n\nPrincess Ingeborg of Denmark August 2, 1878[11] March 12, 1958[11] Married 1897, Prince Carl, Duke of Västergötland (1861–1951) and had 4 children:[35]\n\nPrincess Margaretha of Sweden[35] (1899–1977)[36]\n\nMärtha, Crown Princess of Norway[35] (1901–1954)[37]\n\nMother of Harald V, King of Norway[37]\n\nAstrid, Queen of the Belgians[35] (1905–1935)[38]\n\nMother of Joséphine-Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg,[39] Baudouin, King of the Belgians,[40] and Albert II, King of the Belgians[41]\n\nPrince Carl, Duke of Östergötland[35] (1911–2003)[42]\n\nPrincess Thyra of Denmark March 14, 1880[11] November 2, 1945[11] Died unmarried[11] Prince Gustav of Denmark March 4, 1887[11] October 5, 1944[11] Died unmarried[11] Princess Dagmar of Denmark May 23, 1890[11] October 11, 1961[11] Married 1922,[34] Jørgen Castenskjold[11] (1893[11]–1978[34]) and had 4 children,[11] including\n\nChristian Ludwig Castenskjold (1926[34]–2024[43])\n\nJørgen Castenskjold (1929–1964)[34]\n\nChildren of Alexandra and Edward VII\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1861, Princess Alexandra met King Edward VII of the United Kingdom, then called Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, at the Speyer Cathedral in Germany. Edward was the eldest son of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.[18] Edward later proposed to Alexandra in 1862, and they married in 1863 at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom.[18][17]\n\nAlthough Alexandra and Edward got along fairly well,[44] Edward engaged in several affairs during their marriage.[17] However, for the most part, Alexandra did not pay attention to her husband's romantic liaisons.[44]\n\nTogether, Alexandra and Edward had six children.[17] One of these children, Alexander John, died in infancy.[45] Furthermore, Alexandra and Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, died in 1892 after contracting an illness during a flu pandemic. Albert Victor's death devastated Alexandra.[17]\n\nThe three daughters of Edward and Alexandra, Louise, Victoria, and Maud, were known for being active during their youth. As the daughters aged, they became more withdrawn. Alexandra did not want Louise, Victoria, and Maud to marry because her daughters had two brothers who could potentially follow Edward to the British throne. However, both Louise and Maud eventually married.[45]\n\nPortrait of Queen Alexandra and King Edward VII's family\n\nFamily tree of King Edward VII, Queen Alexandra, and their royal descendants[13][46][47]\n\nEdward VIIAlexandra of Denmark Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and AvondaleMary of TeckGeorge V2 other children[c]Haakon VII of NorwayMaud of Wales Edward VIIIGeorge VI4 other childrenOlav V of Norway Elizabeth IIHarald V of Norway Charles IIIHaakon, Crown Prince of Norway William, Prince of WalesPrincess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway Prince George of Wales\n\nChildren of Alexandra, Queen of the United Kingdom Portrait Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale January 8, 1864[11] January 14, 1892[11] Died unmarried[11] George V, King of the United Kingdom r. 1910–1936[49] June 3, 1865[49] January 20, 1936[49] Married 1893, Princess Victoria Mary of Teck[49] (1867–1953)[50] and had 6 children:[49]\n\nEdward VIII, King of the United Kingdom[49] (1894–1972;[51] r. 1936[52])\n\nGeorge VI, King of the United Kingdom[49] (1895–1952;[50] r. 1936–1952[53])\n\nFather of Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom[54]\n\nMary, Princess Royal[49] (1897–1965)[51]\n\nPrince Henry, Duke of Gloucester[49] (1900–1974)[51]\n\nPrince George, Duke of Kent[49] (1902–1942)[50]\n\nPrince John of the United Kingdom[49] (1905–1919)[50]\n\nLouise, Princess Royal February 20, 1867[45] January 4, 1931[45] Married 1889, Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife[45] (1849[11]–1912[55]) and had 3 children:[45]\n\nAlistair Duff, Marquess of Macduff (1890–1890)[45]\n\nPrincess Alexandra, 2nd Duchess of Fife[45] (1891[45]–1959[11])\n\nPrincess Maud of the United Kingdom[45] (1893[45]–1945[56])\n\nPrincess Victoria of the United Kingdom July 6, 1868[11] December 3, 1935[57] Died unmarried[11] Princess Maud of Wales November 26, 1869[58] November 20, 1938[58] Married 1896, Haakon VII, King of Norway (1872–1957; r. 1905–1957) and had 1 child:[31]\n\nOlav V, King of Norway (1903[31]–1991; r. 1957–1991)[32]\n\nFather of Harald V, King of Norway[32]\n\nPrince Alexander John of Wales April 6, 1871[59] April 7, 1871[59]\n\nChildren of George I and Olga\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1863, the Kingdom of Greece was without a monarch.

Following the marriage of Dagmar's sister Alexandra, Queen Louise dedicated her enthusiasm to making this desire a reality. Eventually, in 1864, Dagmar became engaged to Nicholas Alexandrovich, the then-heir to the Russian throne. However, Nicholas died one year later.[7]\n\nWhile on his deathbed, Nicholas insisted that his brother, Emperor Alexander III of Russia (then called Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia), marry Dagmar.[21] Dagmar gradually developed a romantic attraction toward Alexander.[7] They married in October 1866,[7] and Dagmar took the name Maria Feodorovna after converting to Russian Orthodoxy.[7][21]\n\nMaria and Alexander would go on to have six children together, one of whom, Alexander, did not survive past infancy.[7] Maria adored and spoiled her surviving children, especially Nicholas.[7] Likewise, Alexander adored his daughters.[21]\n\nOf the five children of Maria and Alexander who survived past infancy, George died of tuberculosis. Moreover, Nicholas, Michael, and the former's five children were killed during the Russian Revolution.[7]\n\nPortrait of Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria's family\n\nFamily tree of Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria[13][d]\n\nAlexander III of RussiaMaria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) Nicholas IIAlexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of RussiaGrand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of RussiaGrand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of RussiaGrand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of RussiaGrand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of RussiaGrand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of RussiaGrand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of RussiaAlexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia\n\nChildren of Maria Feodorovna, Empress of Russia Portrait Nicholas II, Emperor of Russia r. 1894–1917[89] May 18, 1868[89] July 17, 1918[89] Married 1894, Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine[89] (1872[90]–1918[89]) and had 5 children:[89]\n\nGrand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia (1895–1918)[89]\n\nGrand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia (1897[11]–1918[89])\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia (1899[11]–1918[89])\n\nGrand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (1901[11]–1918[89])\n\nAlexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia (1904–1918)[89]\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia June 7, 1869[11] May 2, 1870[11] Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia May 9, 1871[11] August 9, 1899[11] Died unmarried[11] Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia April 6, 1875[91] April 20, 1960[91] Married 1894, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia[92] (1866–1933) and had 7 children:[92][91]\n\nPrincess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia (1895–1970)[93]\n\nPrince Andrei Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1897–1981)[94]\n\nPrince Feodor Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1898–1968)[11]\n\nPrince Nikita Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1900–1974)[94]\n\nPrince Dmitri Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1901–1980)[94]\n\nPrince Rostislav Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1902–1977)[94]\n\nPrince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia[92] (1907–1989[95])[94]\n\nGrand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia December 4, 1878[11] Between July 18 and 28, 1918[11] Married 1911, Natalia Brasova (1880–1952) and had 1 child:[96]\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich, Count Brasov (1910[97]–1931)[96]\n\nGrand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia June 13, 1882[98] November 24, 1960[98] Married 1901 (1),[11] Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg[98] (1868–1924)[11][e] and had no children[11] Married 1916 (2), Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky (1881–1958) and had 2 children:[98]\n\nTikhon Nikolaevich (1917–1993)[98]\n\nGuri Nikolaevich (1919–1984)[98]\n\nChildren of Thyra and Ernest Augustus\n\n[edit]\n\nFinding a suitable husband for Princess Thyra of Denmark was an undertaking for her mother, Queen Louise.
