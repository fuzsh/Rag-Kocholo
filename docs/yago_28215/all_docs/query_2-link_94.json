Though descended from several monarchs through his mother, including George II of Great Britain and Frederik V of Denmark, he had no strong claim to any European throne. He grew up in Denmark and was educated in the Military Academy of Copenhagen.\n\nAs a young man, he unsuccessfully sought the hand of Queen Victoria in marriage. In 1842 he married Luise of Hesse-Kassel, a niece of Christian VIII and had six children with her."
