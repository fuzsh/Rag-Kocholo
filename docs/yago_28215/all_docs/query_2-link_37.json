        "text": "May 21, 2015\n\n(This is actually a trade paperback edition, but the database won't let me make one. Sigh. So it goes)\n\nA very readable, if somewhat erratic look at the Danish Royal family, and who begat who, who married who, and who started the wars. Published back in the 1970's, it is dated in spots, but very readable, and considering how little tends to be written about the Danes, full of little insights and new stories. I give it four out of five starts and a recommendation.\n\nFor the longer review, please go here:\n\nhttp://www.personapaper.com/article/2...\n\nMay 3, 2021\n\nFascinating history\n\nI found this an enjoyable book to read as it draws together a lot of lines in the history of Europe’s monarchies. Inevitably the greater part is devoted to Alexandra and Dagmar and the closeness of their relationship. It’s easy to read and whilst it is a history of a royal family, it covers the wider picture of Europe before World War One.\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nGood but (sort of) Recycled\n\nIt's certainly worth it if you're interested in late nineteenth/early twentieth century royal families. That such a relatively unimportant (in terms of political importance) country and family had such a far-flung impact on so many other countries is truly unexpected. And they certainly did. My one caveat is that, if you've read other books by Theo Aronson, many of the anecdotes are repeated but I guess that unavoidable.\n\nMay 17, 2019\n\nWow, I have to say what a great book for those who enjoy reading royal biographies and the connections from one royal family to another. The book is about King Christian IX of Denmark and how 5 of his 6 kids were able to eventually sit on the various thrones of Europe and countless more grandchildren and great-grandchildren have done the same.\n\nAt the time, Denmark was a rather small country, not very powerful or wealthy by any means. So then the next question is \"how?\", how did King Christian IX to become one of the most respected and consequential monarchs in Europe? Is it because he was exceedingly cunning and shrewd and pulled the right levers? The short answer is no and that he is actually one very lucky person. Take for example, his own ascension in 1863. He was not expected to inherit the Denmark throne except his uncle, the king at the time, did not have any children. Christian was chosen because he was the least offensive person (to the other European powers) that could take the throne and he was almost a \"second option\". His children were able to marry into some of Europe's most powerful royal families including the UK because they were basically attractive, kind and of royal blood.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful book and it even prompted me to purchase a number of the author's prior books. Now, that's a good compliment (along with recommending his work to other people).\n\nFebruary 8, 2019\n\nThis was a truly fascinating read. I’d long heard of King Christian IX of Denmark, known as the ‘Grandfather of Europe’. The book gives an amazing insight into the characteristics of the family and the lives of his children and grand-children as they married into and grew up in various European royal families. What really struck me was Aronson’s description of the characteristics of the Danish Royal Family. They come across as a ‘normal’, ‘down-to-earth family, who for the large part didn’t consider themselves to be any better than others. I’m very happy I bought this book. It’s well written, not heavy at all and the narrative makes it very easy to read.\n\nJuly 18, 2019\n\nI never knew how important the Denmark Royal Family was to the rest of the world --- the marriages, etc involved them in all of Europe and Scandinavia. The authors writes in a delightful style so you feel you know the personalities. The little 'inside' drama fitting in the actual history of the years, gave me a much better understanding of history. Mainly pre-WWI, but the latter part does indicate how the countries were during the war.\n\nApril 13, 2019\n\nA well researched and easy to read - found myself absorbed in the story of the illustrious royal family. The connection between various international affaires, which tied loose ends of the European history of the end of 19th and beginning of 20th century with precision and logic, was particularly fascinating.\n\nJune 25, 2019\n\nI found this book informative, well-organized, and pleasant to read. It's not easy to keep all the members of a large family straight. I never felt confused by all the people involve. It's true that it has not been brought up to the present day. I'm not sure that's necessary.\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\nIn anticipation of Queen Margrethe’s abdication I decided to read Theo Aronson’s “A Family of Kings” which focuses on the descendants of King Christian IX of Denmark preceding and following the First World War and the Royal Courts they happened to find themselves in.\n\nMay 24, 2018\n\nNot bad. Not brilliant either.\n\nIt desperately needs some updates, it still mentions ex-King Juan Carlos of Spain as a pretendant to the throne and Baldouin as the current Belgian King.\n\nDecember 22, 2021\n\nGreat book\n\nwell put together recommend it thoroughly. Well researched and written like an adventure, I have read a number of Theos books and they don't disappoint\n\nJuly 23, 2023\n\nDrivel. Unsophisticated. Insipid. The intelligence to which the author claims the characters lack is merely the dearth of his own.\n\nMay 29, 2014\n\nIf Queen Victoria is the Grandmother of all Europe, then Christian IX of Denmark is the grandfather. His descendants covered as many thrones as did Victoria's but his name is less known. One of his sons was the King of Greece, one of his daughters married Alexander III of Russia and was the mother of the tragic Nicholas II, his eldest daughter became the Queen of England after Victoria's death, his grandson and granddaughter (cousins) became the first King and Queen of Norway after its breakaway from Sweden, another daughter married the \"King\" of Hanover (whose \"kingship\" had been stripped from him when Prussia took over Hanover), and of course, his own heir.\n\nChristian was a very unimposing man who never assumed he would be king or that his progeny would spread over so much of Europe. This story is not really about him but about the distribution of his children and their children.\n\nAronson has a marvelous style and it is difficult to put the book down. After reading the story of Queen Victoria's children, this book puts the rest of Europe into place. Suddenly, all the dots are connected.\n\nFebruary 6, 2016\n\nAn interesting, well written history of the large and influential family raised by King Christian IX of Denmark (1863-1906) and his remarkable, brilliant wife, Queen Louise. This is a relatively easy and enjoyable historical study based upon already published sources. The author writes well and the book is a non-scholarly study that breaks little, if any new ground. The most serious deficiency of this book is its lack of an index. Historical studies dealing with hundreds of historical figures and dozens of monarchs over a century of European history require indexes to enable readers to go back and revisit information on this or that war, ruler, palace, treaty, etc. over the years. Most decent history books are not just read and put on a shelf, but pulled out again and again to reclaim nuggets of insight. Without an index of any kind, that entire aspect of use is next to impossible. --- Another deficiency is the poor quality of illustrations.\n\nMay 23, 2015\n\nI enjoy reading Aronson's work, but he also annoys me. There's lots of contradictions in his work (describing someone as both shrewd and unintellectual/unintelligent comes to mind). There's also a lot of fawning over certain personages who I find keen targets for dislike.\n\nThat said, it's hard not to be drawn in by the gossip and the affection for the cast of characters, and this did help me sort out some of the minor royal personages in late Victorian/Edwardian England and how their relationships help contribute to the mess that was WWI. I've usually seen things from the \"Queen Victoria as the Grandmama of Europe\" side, so seeing how the Danish family ties played into things was a fresh twist.\n\nWhile I like Aronson's breeziness, I don't really take much he says seriously since he's very much a Royal apologist.\n\nAugust 24, 2016\n\nAs generally agreed, this book is very readable and delightful. The author certainly values the virtues that made King Christian IX's descendants so successful and popular, though he also makes it clear that those are mainly family-oriented. The descendants of the King could make admirable sovereigns in good times but not so ready for turbulence and could not always appreciate the reality and the changing mood of their subjects. Though this is a biography instead of a history book, as the author emphasized, it nevertheless shed light on the international affairs at that time, following the footsteps of many kings and queens.\n\nFebruary 9, 2016\n\nMuch like Queen Victoria, whose off springs married into the royal families of Europe, King Christian IX did the same. He produced queens, empresses, kings and starting from mid 1800's through the the first world war who ruled on two continents. His decendantsseven continue rule as monarchs even into the 21st century in many European countries though no longer autocrats.\n\nI found this an book easy read and would recommend it as a good book to get an overview, however slight of history of European royalty\n\nJanuary 14, 2016\n\nAnother great one!\n\nVery engaging. The use of royal nicknames makes it so much easier to follow. Easier, but by no means easy. I find having a genealogy table handy helps immensely. If you are reading on a kindle a separate source of tables helps. It can be distracting leaving a page to double check a name or relationship. I will continue to read other books by Mr Aronson. I would highly recommend. Gbash\n\nSeptember 11, 2015\n\nA very interesting account of the King of Denmark and his descendants who became monarchs of many of the European nations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Worth reading for those with an interest in European history.\n\nJune 13, 2015\n\nA part of royal history I know so little about so good to read. A bit light on detail but overall worth the read.\n\nOctober 10, 2015\n\nI wish I'd had Aronson as a history professor. Really enjoyed this book!\n\nNovember 18, 2015\n\nI really liked this book. It was a lot better than Grandmama of Europe. It was very informative though some of the information was dated (like about ex-King Juan Carlos not being king yet).\n\nFebruary 2, 2017\n\nTerrific! Wonderful history of the people, with lots of anecdotes. Loved it."
