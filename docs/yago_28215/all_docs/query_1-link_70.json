        "text": "Proposed marriage between crown prince(later king XIV) Eric Vasa and Queen Elizabeth. According to mostly biased Swedish sources he was one of the first suitors and is regarded to have been in front of the line of suitors.\n\nIf the marriage had gone through then England and Sweden would be in a personal union. Unfortunally it will also mean that Eric will fall into his madness as the king of two countries and that Elizabeth have to deal with the uprising in Sweden by Erics sibblings.\n\nIf this works out it will change the events of Europe a great deal. England will now have to orient some towards the north and Sweden will be part of the colonization in North America. Denmark will feel threatened and seek alliance with France\n\nIf I may both engage in ASBs and Napoleonic favoritism:\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte: Marries Desiree Clary (1795) (who gives him multiple children). To give himself legitimacy, he divorces her and marries María Isabella of Spain (April 1801). (Desiree Clary later marries Mathurin-Léonard Duphot on the 31st of December, 1797)\n\nLucien Napoleon marries Maria Luisa of Spain (IOTL, Napoleon insisted upon the match, and it became a big point of contention between the brothers)\n\nPrince Napoléon Bonaparte (Jérôme) and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge\n\nNapoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte + Catherine Pavlovna of Russia (1808) - Their son (we know him as Napoleon II IOTL) marries Princess Sophie of Bavaria (Yes, the father is named after the son ITTL, truly something worthy of Inception)\n\nSecond son of Napoleon and Anna Pavlona of Russia\n\nThird son of Napoleon marries Marie Louise of Austria (Yes, ITTL, one of Napoleon's sons marries what IOTL was his mother. That's how big the age gap was, which is pretty gross IMO)\n\nFourth son of Napoleon and Princess Caroline Augusta of Bavaria (ITTL, Napoleon has a son for every potential/speculated marriage match he was offered)\n\nFernando de Asturias (Fernand VII) + Charlotte Bonaparte (First daughter of Lucien Bonaparte)\n\nFerdinand III of Tuscany + Charlotte Bonaparte (First daughter of Lucien Bonaparte) (ITTL, they're identical tins/cloned/whatever)\n\nNapoleon III + Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (Niece of Queen Victoria + Mother-in-law of Wilhelm II)\n\nNapoleon III (brother/clone) + Princess Carola of Vasa\n\nNapoleon II (brother/clone) + Eugénie de Montijo\n\nFor non-Napoleonic marriages\n\nConstantine IV and Rotrude (Daughter of Charlemagne)\n\nCharlemagne and Irene\n\nCharles II of Spain and Infanta Isabel Luisa of Portugal\n\nWilliam Seymour and Lady Arbella Stuart\n\nQueen Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley (1559) (He avoids the rumors ITTL, and Elizabeth is happy, and as such perhaps Lady Katherine Grey would be allowed to succeed to the throne as was intended by Henry VIII in his will [assuming Elizabeth still doesn't have kids])\n\nIvan Ivanovich (son of Ivan the Terrible) and Virginia Eriksdotter (daughter of Eric XIV of Sweden)\n\nFrederick the Great and Maria Theresa of Austria\n\nPrince Frederick of Prussia (1794–1863) and Princess Charlotte of Wales\n\nMiguel I of Portugal + Maria II of Portugal (Marriage by proxy since she was 7 years old when this was proposed in 1826) (Combined with the following match, it could cement an Iberic Union for at least a few decades)\n\nPedro V of Portugal/Prince Leopold/Infante Enrique + Isabella II of Spain (Either one is cool, though Pedro V is the coolest option due to the potential for another Iberic Union)\n\nArchduke Maximilian and Princess Maria Amélia of Brazil (Maybe they have kids, and it would give him more legitimacy as Emperor of Mexico since his bride would be Latin-American)\n\nArchduke Ludwig Viktor of Austria and Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (Perhaps it could help Brazil keep its monarchy and avoid the subsequent instability)\n\nPrince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale and Princess Margaret of Prussia (Always nice to see friendlier Anglo-German relations)\n\nArchduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and Princess Hélène of Orléans (Always interesting to see an Franco-Austrian alliance)"
