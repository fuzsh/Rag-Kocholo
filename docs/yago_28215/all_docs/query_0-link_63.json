        "meta_description": "Cabinet portrait of King Christian IX of Denmark by Niels Christian Hasen (Næstved, 16 December 1834 - Frederiksberg, 25 October 1922) and Frantz Clemens Stephan Weller (Neustadt, 17 May 1838 – Copenhagen, 17 July 1900).\n\tAtelier address: Bredgade 28, Copenhagen.\n\tActivity: from 01 December 1867 to July 1900.\n\tDate: end of 19th Century.\n\t\n\t\n\tMore about King Christian IX:\n\tChristian was born on 08 April 1818 at Gottorf Castle near the town of Schleswig as Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, the fourth son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, and Princess Louise Caroline of Hesse. He was named after Prince Christian of Denmark, the later King Christian VIII, who was also his godfather.\n\tInitially, Christian lived with his parents and many siblings at Gottorf Castle, where the family stayed with Duke Friedrich Wilhelm's parents-in-law. However, on 06 June 1825, Duke Friedrich Wilhelm was appointed Duke of Glücksburg by his brother-in-law Frederick VI of Denmark, as the elder Glücksburg line had become extinct in 1779. Subsequently, the family moved to Glücksburg Castle, where Christian was raised with his siblings under their father's supervision. Following the early death of the father in 1831, Christian grew up in Denmark and was educated in the Military Academy of Copenhagen.\n\tAs a young man, Christian unsuccessfully sought the hand of his third cousin, Queen Victoria, in marriage. At the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen on 26 May 1842, he married his second cousin, Louise of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), a niece of Christian VIII.\n\tIn 1853, with the approval of the great powers of Europe, Christian was chosen by King Frederick VII to be heir presumptive after the extinction of the most senior line to the Danish throne, as Frederick VII seemed incapable of fathering children. A justification for this choice was his marriage to Louise of Hesse-Kassel, who—as a niece of Christian VIII of Denmark—was a closer heir-presumptive to the throne than her husband.\n\tUpon the death of Frederick VII on 15 November 1863, Christian succeeded to the throne as Christian IX. Denmark was immediately plunged into a crisis over the possession and status of Schleswig and Holstein, two provinces to Denmark's south. This resulted in the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and a Prussian/Austrian alliance in 1864. The Peace Conference broke up without having arrived at any conclusion; the outcome of the war was unfavourable to Denmark and led to the incorporation of Schleswig into Prussia in 1865. Holstein was likewise incorporated into Austria in 1865, then Prussia in 1866, following further conflict between Austria and Prussia.\n\tThe defeat of 1864 cast a shadow over Christian IX's rule for many years and his attitude to the Danish case—probably without reason—was claimed to be half-hearted. This unpopularity was worsened as he sought unsuccessfully to prevent the spread of democracy throughout Denmark by supporting the authoritarian and conservative prime minister Estrup, whose rule 1875–94 was by many seen as a semi-dictatorship. However, he signed a treaty in 1874 which allowed Iceland, then a Danish possession, to have its own constitution, albeit one that still had Denmark ruling Iceland. In 1901, he reluctantly asked Johan Henrik Deuntzer to form a government and this resulted in the formation of the Cabinet of Deuntzer. The cabinet consisted of members of the Venstre Reform Party and was the first Danish government not to include the conservative party Højre, even though Højre never had a majority of the seats in the Folketing. This was the beginning of the Danish tradition of parliamentarism and clearly bettered his reputation for his last years.\n\tQueen Louise died on 29 September 1898 at Bernstorff Palace near Copenhagen. Christian himself died peacefully of old age at 87 at the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen after a reign of 42 years and 75 days. After lying in state at the chapel at Christiansborg Palace, he was interred beside Queen Louise in Christian IX's Chapel in Roskilde Cathedral, the traditional burial site for Danish monarchs since the 15th century.\n\tHe was succeeded as king by his eldest son, Frederick, who ascended the throne as King Frederick VIII.\n\t\n\tMore about Hansen and Weller’s Atelier:\n\tNiels Christian Hansen (a portrait painter), his brother Georg Emil Hansen and the lieutenant-turned-businessman Albert Schou founded the studio on 01 December 1867. It was originally called \"Hansen & Schou\". In 1869, Clemens Weller, a native of Germany, joined the firm. He was originally a bookbinder but had learned photography from Georg Hansen. At that point, the company became known as \"Hansen, Schou and Weller\".\n\tOn 14 April 1869, the firm received a Royal warrant of appointment. In 1872 they participated in the Nordic Industrial and Art Exhibition in Copenhagen and they won a bronze medal in Vienna in 1875.\n\tIn 1885 the company got a fashionable location in the pavilions of Schimmelmann's Palace at Bredgade 28.\n\tAfter Schou (1887) and Niels Christian Hansen (1889) resignation Weller became the sole owner of the business. However, he decided not to change the atelier’s name, keeping the firm “Hansen & Weller”. \n\tWeller continued to be one of the most famous and prolific photographers in Denmark (he left approximately 360,000 carefully preserved photographic plates) and his atelier became very popular among celebrities and aristocrats.\n\tOn 17 July 1900, Weller died at the age of 62 and the atelier was closed the same year.",
