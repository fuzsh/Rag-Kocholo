        "text": "celebration of the event the kingdom made\n\nmerry, and the ancient city of Copenhagen\n\nbecame the rendezvous of representatives of\n\nall the European - Governments and\n\nDynasties, who came to present their con-\n\ngatulations, or to participate, as near\n\nrelations of the venerable couple, in the\n\nfestivities of their home and their people.\n\nThe comprehensiveness of the relationships\n\nof tho Dauish'Royal Family, and tho splondid\n\nalliances they havo contracted, rendered\n\nevory domestio event in tho Court of Copen\n\nhagen a sort of field day for tho Royalties of\n\nEurope, and tho account of tho present\n\ngathering read like a compendium of. tho\n\n\"Almanach do Gotha.\" As early as 0\n\no'clook on Thursday morning tho bollB of all\n\nthe churches of tho capital peeled out a\n\ngreeting to tho Royal couple and a call to\n\nthe people, Sinco daybreak workmen bad\n\nbeen busy finishing tho decorations in tho\n\nstreets, and when the public got out of\n\ndoors thoy fouud tho result oharmiug. Tho\n\nthoroughfares were full of bright color.\n\nFlags of Denmark, England, Russia,\n\nGroece and France were displayod every\n\nwhere, together with evergreens, trophies,\n\nand busts of tho King and Queen wreathed\n\nwith laurels. Shortly after 9 o'clock tho\n\npopular celebrations began with a sorenado\n\nby about 1200 trained chorieters assembled\n\nbefore the Royal palace. This concert,\n\nwhich was listened to by the Royal Family\n\nfrom a balcony of tho palace, wns extremely\n\nbeautiful, and elicited hearty applauso. Thq\n\nKing, with somo emotion, thanked tho\n\nsingers for their offering of a song. At 10\n\no'clock the Royal Family loft tho palace-\n\nin carriagOB to attend a solemn thanks-\n\nliving service in the church of Christians\n\nsorg Chateau. The rest of tho day was spent\n\niu festivities.\n\nchristian ix.\n\nhas not been the occupant of a throne for an\n\nexceptionally long period. Among his con\n\ntemporaries several uro his seniors in this\n\nrespect, notably Queen Victoria and the\n\nEmperor Francis Joseph of Austria. But\n\nthe 29 years during which he bad wioldcd\n\nthe ancient sceptro of tho Danes, the Wends\n\nand the Goths havo been more than usually\n\neventful. From the political point of viow\n\nthe chief intorcBt of the festivitios lies in\n\nthe contrast it affords of tho security of tho\n\nDanish throno at the prosent moment\n\nwith the dangers which threatened it so\n\nmenacingiy'a third of a century ago. On\n\nNovember 15, 1863, when Prince Christian of\n\nSchlcswig-Holstein-Soudcrburg-Gluckoburg\n\nsucceeded to tho crown of Frederick VII.,\n\nthe last King of the Oldenburg Dynasty,\n\nfew people imagined that 29 years later he\n\nwould still bo in possession of his Royal\n\ndignity, onjoying tho confidence of his sub\n\njects and the respect of Europe. At the\n\nmoment that ha ascended tho throne in vir\n\ntue of that singular treaty of London,\n\nof which Lord Palmcrston said sarcastically\n\nthat only tlueo persons understood its na\n\nture aud its object — Cod, a German pro\n\nfessor, and himself — ho was confronted\n\nby tho Austro- Prussian coalition, intent on\n\nsnatching from him the Duchies of Schlos-\n\nwig and Hulstcin. Europe looked on the\n\nunequal struggio witli indifference, and the\n\nheroic resistance of the DaneB only ended in\n\nfailure and humiliations. For years the hit\n\nterncss of this national abasement haunted\n\nthe Court aud politics of Copenhagen,\n\ngiving rise evontually to a struggle between\n\ntho Crown and tho Parliament, which kept\n\ntho country on what was apparently the\n\nverge of revolution. In the end, however,\n\ntho high personal character of the King\n\ntriumphed, and although many patriotic\n\nDanes still . believe that their ruler was\n\nill-advised in resisting tho Parliamentary\n\nmajority, they have now acquiesced in\n\nhis policy. This has bean the curlier for them\n\nbecause tho Royal Family has always been\n\ngenuinely popular, and Denmark is proud\n\nthat tho genius of her princes and the\n\nbeauty and virtue of her princcssos havo\n\nmade ono foreign kingdom and two mighty\n\nempires, iu a sense, tributary to herself.\n\nHer King and Queen occupy a certain\n\npatriarchal dignity among the Royal liousos\n\nof tho world which has gone far towards\n\neradicating the bitter memories of 1804.\n\nqueen louise.\n\nIn bis domestic life the King has been\n\nsingularly fortunate. Queen Louiso is\n\none of tho most amiable of women.\n\nThough 15 months the senior of her\n\nhusbund, Bho has preserved a remarkable\n\nappeurance of youthfulncss, and but for the\n\nsilver in her hair might pass for one of her\n\nown daughters. Her bright disposition and\n\nher quick intelligence have irradiated her\n\nmodest homo, whilo her gracious and kindly\n\nmanner have won the hearts of the wholo\n\nDanish people. \"That the Danish Royal\n\nFamily is so united,\" writes ono of hor\n\nbiographers, \" that the Danish Court is tho\n\nstock instunco of the power of domestic\n\nvirtue in politics ; that few Royal Houses\n\nhave made for their children alliances so\n\nbrilliant, thrown out so many shoots all\n\nover Europe, is due to tho Queen's\n\ngoodness, onorgy and wisdom.\" That her\n\ndaughters, too, aro such models among\n\nwomen is duo to her careful training. From\n\nher enrliest youth sho haB led a modest and\n\nbusy lifo. An early riser und a busy house\n\nwife, hor days havo been passed in surround\n\ning her husband and children with tho\n\nelements ot happiness. Sho has especially\n\nlabored to teach her sons and daughters the\n\nvirtuos of simplicity and self-reliance. Many\n\nare tho tales which are told of how tho\n\nprince3Bos, one of whom is now un Empress\n\nand the other a Princess of Wales, used to\n\nmake their own dresses and help their\n\nmother in hor household duties. Her hus\n\nband and her children are not moro cntiroiy\n\ndevotod to her than her sons-in-law, who\n\nyear after year olcct to pass their summer\n\nholiday in her happy homo at Fredensborg.\n\na numerous family.\n\n_ King Christian and Quean Louiso have\n\nsix children, three sons aud three daughters.\n\nTho eldest sou— Prince Frederick William —\n\nis married to a princess of Sweden und\n\nNorway, by whom ho has eight children ;\n\nthe second son is King George I. of Greece,\n\nwho by his wife, a Grand Duchess of Russia,\n\nhas seven children, tho eldest of whom is\n\nmarriod and has ono son; tho third son,\n\nPrince YV&ldemar, is the husband of Prin\n\ncess Marie of Orleans, and the father of\n\nthreo boys. Of the three daughters, the\n\neldest is tho Princess of Wales, tho second\n\nis the Czarina of Russia and the third ib the\n\nDuchess of Cumberland. Altogether the\n\nfamily circle consists of six children, 33\n\ngrandchildren and two great-grandchildren,\n\nThis is, of course, exciuaivo of sons aud\n\ndaughters-in-law."
