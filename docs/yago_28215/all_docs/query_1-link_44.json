        "text": "Thyra of Denmark (September 29, 1853 – February 26, 1933) was the youngest daughter of Christian IX of Denmark and Luise of Hesse-Kassel..\n\nThyra was the younger sister of Frederik VIII of Denmark, Alexandra, Queen consort of the United Kingdom, George I of Greece and Dagmar, Empress consort of Russia.\n\nShe was married to Ernst August of Hanover, 3rd Duke of Cumberland.\n\nSorry, I hope this gives an insight but I don’t have time to post more info now, post more later!\n\nMarengo said:\n\ndidn t she become pregnant before her marriage from a danish captain/colonel/? The child was adopted I believe...\n\nThyra (if that's who you're referring to!) married Prince Ernst August of Hanover on 22nd December, 1878.\n\nThey had 6 children:\n\nMarie Louise of Hanover (born: 1879, died; 1948)\n\nGeorge William of Hanover (born: 1880, died: 1912)\n\nAlexandra of Hanover (born: 1882, died: 1963)\n\nOlga of Hanover (born: 1884, died: 1958)\n\nChristian of Hanover (born: 1885, died: 1901)\n\nDuke Ernest Augustus Hanover of Brunswick (born: 1887, died: 1953)\n\nI just started reading about Thyra, so you may be right, I don't know.\n\nMarengo said:\n\ndidn t she become pregnant before her marriage from a danish captain/colonel/? The child was adopted I believe...\n\nYes princess Thyra became pregnant with the royal guardsman and when he heard that he killed himself. She gave birth to her daughter in Greece and the daughter was adopted by a danish coupe. very tragic and when Thary was expecting her first child with Ernst August she constantly heard a child crying. that only happened till she gave birth to Marie Louise.\n\nSome about Thyra http://www.geocities.com/jesusib/Thyra.html\n\nThis soldier was Vilhelm Frimann Marcher (1841-1872).\n\nThe daughter was Maria Katharina (Jensen) Jorgensen (8 November, 1841-1964).\n\nMaria was adopted by Rasmus and Anne Marie Jorgensen from Odense shortly after birth and renamed Kate. She was married in 1902 with Frode Ployen-Holstein.\n\nOn Henri Van Oene's site is write that Maria was born in Schlos Glucksburg.\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/henrivanoene/gendenmark.html\n\nhttp://geneweb.inria.fr/roglo?lang=en;i=104246\n\nmagnik said:\n\nThis soldier was Vilhelm Frimann Marcher (1841-1872).\n\nThe daughter was Maria Katharina (Jensen) Jorgensen (8 November, 1841-1964).\n\nMaria was adopted by Rasmus and Anne Marie Jorgensen from Odense shortly after birth and renamed Kate. She was married in 1902 with Frode Ployen-Holstein.\n\nOn Henri Van Oene's site is write that Maria was born in Schlos Glucksburg.\n\nThe daughter was born in Greece and adopted to a danish coulple. What later happened noone know. There have been many gues about it but again noone knows what happened to the little girl.\n\nbetina said:\n\nThe daughter was born in Greece and adopted to a danish coulple. What later happened noone know.\n\nI know that she was born in Greece (it was mention on this programme - Monarcies or smth like that), but I only add what is wrote on Henri's page - be honest I don't know why it is wrote that she was born in Denmark...\n\nthanks for the link. wow we just think we have scandals now! can u imagine in that day and time how awful it must have been for her. i'm glad she ended up with a happy ending.\n\nbbb said:\n\nthanks for the link. wow we just think we have scandals now! can u imagine in that day and time how awful it must have been for her. i'm glad she ended up with a happy ending.\n\nAwful?! As for a mother it must be terrible and tragic to give back her new born child.\n\nAs betina wrote: when Thyra was expecting her first child with Ernst August she constantly heard a child crying. That only happened till she gave birth to Marie Louise.\n\nKelly said:\n\nSo where is this part of the danish family? Does the current royal family have any if at all connection to that side? Very interesting.\n\nThyra's great grandson, Ernst August of Hannover, attended Frederik and Mary's wedding, along with his spouse, Caroline of Monaco.\n\nAnother great grandson, Constantine of Greece, married Margrethe's sister Anne-Marie.\n\nSo, yes... there are connections.\n\nNo, she didn't have offspring\n\nKate Jorgensen* married Frode Ployen-Holstein in 1902 but the marriage was childless.\n\nPlease note that it has never been verified that the above mentioned lady\n\nwas Thyra's daughter. So noone knows for sure! Royal historians are familiar with the name but also add, that several adopted ladies born around 1872 claimed to be Thyra's child.\n\nviv\n\nPrince Valdemar\n\n\"Thyra was the younger sister of Frederik VIII of Denmark, Alexandra, Queen consort of the United Kingdom, George I of Greece and Dagmar, Empress consort of Russia.\"\n\nThyra had a younger brother; Prince Valdemar of Denmark. He was actually offered the Bulgarian Throne but he declined because Bulgaria and Greece were at the brink of war and since his brother was already King of Greece it was probably a wise decision. He was also mentioned in connection to the vacant throne of Norway, which was however offered to his nephew Prince Carl (son of Frederik VIII of Denmark)\n\nIn 1885 Prince Valdemar married Marie of Orléans. She was catholic so the married was made possible by special permission by His Holiness the Pope and it was agreed that their sons should be raised protestant and their daughters catholic. The couple had 5 children:\n\nAage, Count of Rosenborg\n\nPrince Axel\n\nErik, Count of Rosenborg\n\nViggo, Count of Rosenborg\n\nMargrethe, Princesse of Bourbon-Parma (she married René of Bourbon-Parma. Thet had one daughter; Anne, Queen of Romania)\n\nMore precisely, the rumors were about a possible marriage between Thyra and Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, or Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught.\n\nPrince Alfred of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur of Connaught were their namesake sons, and besides were far too young for marrying Princess Thyra.\n\nAnother candidate for marrying Thyra was King Willem III of the Netherlands, but he was rejected because he was too old (he was 36 years older than the Princess)."
