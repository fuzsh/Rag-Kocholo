        "text": "Queen Margrethe of Denmark’s shock abdication announcement has some speculating that the decision was driven to save the marriage of her son Crown Prince Frederik to Crown Princess Mary.\n\nQueen of Denmark, 83, revealed in her New Year's Eve speech that she is stepping down as sovereign on Jan. 14 — an unexpected move that may have been made to bolster Frederik and Mary’s bond. In November 2023, reports swirled that the Crown Prince, 55, was having an affair with Mexican-born socialite Geneveva Casanova after they were photographed together during his private trip to Madrid. Casanova denied allegations of a romantic relationship with Frederik and the Crown Prince couple continued to display a united front while hosting King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain.\n\n“It’s possible that the Queen took this action because she would have been terrified of the marriage breaking up and the royal family losing Mary. It would have caused major problems. The Queen has always seen Mary as a tremendous asset,” longtime author and royal commentator Phil Dampier told The Telegraph of Queen Margrethe’s abdication announcement. The outlet noted that Queen Margrethe will become the first Danish monarch to step down in over 500 years and that she previously hinted she intended to reign for life, like her third cousin Queen Elizabeth, who reigned over 70 years until her death in Sept. 2022.\n\n“It just seems an extraordinary coincidence that she should make this unexpected announcement just a couple of months after stories emerged of the Crown Prince supposedly having an affair,” continued Dampier, who has covered the Danish royal family for over 20 years. “In two weeks’ time, the Prince and Princess will be pitched together as King and Queen and they will have to get on with it. The Queen may be thinking that they will patch up their differences and it will save their marriage.”\n\nQueen Margrethe, Prince Frederik and Princess Mary, 51, seemed to be in good spirits when they stepped out on Monday night for the New Year’s banquet at Amalienborg Castle in Copenhagen. Queen Margrethe gave a wave as she entered the palace, while Frederik and Mary, who have four children, smiled as they arrived together — their first public appearance since the Queen’s abdication announcement.\n\nIn early December, Mary traveled without her husband to her native Australia to visit her family ahead of Christmas. She was joined by her two youngest children. According to the palace, Frederik had plans to join her the following week.\n\nOn Dec. 31, the longest-reigning monarch in Danish history announced that she would abdicate on Jan. 14, 2024 — the 52nd anniversary of her accession. Margrethe acceded to the throne at age 31 in 1972 following the sudden death of her father King Frederik IX, and referred to both her record reign and back surgery last winter in prefacing the news.\n\n“In two weeks time I have been Queen of Denmark for 52 years. Such an amount will leave its mark on anybody – also on me! The time takes its toll, and the number of ‘ailments’ increases. One cannot undertake as much as one managed in the past,” Queen Margrethe began her traditional New Year Address, per an English translation.\n\n“In February this year I underwent extensive back surgery. Everything went well, thanks to the competent health personnel, who took care of me. Inevitably, the operation gave cause to thoughts about the future – whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation,” she continued. “I have decided that now is the right time. On 14th January, 2024 – 52 years after I succeeded my beloved father – I will step down as Queen of Denmark. I will hand over the throne to my son Crown Prince Frederik.”\n\nThe Telegraph described the news as “highly unusual,” and historian Lars Hovbakke Sorensen pointed out that the last Danish abdication was in 1523. Sorenson said that Queen Margrethe may have been influenced by Prince Christian coming of age and turning 18 in October. Frederik and Mary’s eldest son, who will become the Crown Prince when his father accedes as King, marked the banner birthday with a balcony appearance, glam royal gala and induction into the Order of the Elephant, Denmark’s highest honor of chivalry, followed by formal declaration to the constitution in November.\n\nThe same month, reports surfaced about the state of Christian’s parents' marriage. According to Hola!, Spanish outlets published photos of Crown Prince Frederik with Casanova, a philanthropist, model and TV personality, during a trip to Madrid. The outlet reported that the two toured a Picasso exhibit at the Thyssen-Bornemisza National Museum, walked through a park and had dinner together in the heart of the city. The outing reportedly came to be because a mutual friend who was originally set to accompany Frederik around Madrid got sick, and asked Casanova, who is an expert in Picasso art, to go in his stead.\n\nDenying the buzz, Casanova told Hola!, \"I flatly deny the statements that suggest a romantic relationship between Prince Frederick and me. Any statement of this type is not only completely untrue but also distorts the facts in a malicious manner. This is already in the hands of my lawyers, who will take care of the pertinent steps to protect my right to honor, truth and privacy.\"\n\nDanish news site Dagens.com states that Prince Frederik’s trip to Spain fell while his wife was in New York for United Nations Day. While Princess Mary’s N.Y.C. stay from Oct. 23 to 24 was announced by the Danish Royal House, Prince Frederik’s trip to Spain was not.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The couple dated long-distance before getting engaged and married at Copenhagen Cathedral in 2004, and they went on to welcome four children: Prince Christian, Princess Isabella, 16, and 12-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine.\n\nAs full-time working royals, the couple support Queen Margrethe and the crown through royal engagements and many patronages.\n\nIn closing her New Year’s Address, Queen Margrethe thanked Parliament and the public for supporting her through the years and stressed that she hopes her eldest son and his wife are welcomed into their elevated royal roles."
