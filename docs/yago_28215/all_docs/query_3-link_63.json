        "text": "Queen Louise Josephine, 1906\n\nThe next Queen of Denmark was Queen Louise Josephine, nee Princess Lovisa of Sweden. She was married to King Frederik VIII of Denmark. She was given the insignia of the Order of the Elephant in 1906, on the 31st of October. F-VIII had succeeded his father on 29th January 1906.\n\nHer shield is directly to the right and just below Queen Louise W's, which you can see in the second image of the post above.\n\n... and doesn't heraldry tell a story. Here you can see that even though the Queen was given the insignia in 1906 (at which stage her son Carl was the new King of Norway reigning as Haakon 7th post the division of the Swedish/Norwegian Union) her arms show the fact that when she married into the Danish Royal family she was a Princess of the union countries.\n\nI love the effect with the three crowns sitting side by side above the marshalled arms.\n\nAttachments\n\nDSC00663-QLouiseJ-1906-10-31a.jpg\n\nThe Three Princesses, 1947???\n\nThe three daughters of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid all have their shields as up in the chapel as princesses of denmark.\n\nAll three shields have the same date... 22nd of April 1947. This is the date of their father's succession as king. (Not to mention a month before the dat on their mother's shield, which seems a little strange to me.)\n\nPrincess Margrethe's shield also says... \"Regni Heres\" after the usual \"Principissa Daniae\". (Which I take as a literal meaning \"kingdom heir\" in latin.) However in 1947 Margarethe was not the throne follower. Indeed there was no female succession until in 1953, when the Act of Succession was changed, allowing females to become Queen Regnants. The crown on top of her shield is also the heraldic crown of the heir to the throne. So I assume that this shield - and maybe all three - were not painted unil after this date.\n\nI would be grateful if anyone can shed any further light onto this for us.\n\nNote that Princess Margrethe's shield is in the bay behind the organ at the back of the chiurch. It is at the top right, just diagonally above the shield of her father as crown prince See attached image. The two other princesses and their mother are on the wall around the corner to the right.\n\nAttachments\n\nDSC00677-PssMargrethe-QMII-1947-4-20a.jpg\n\nDSC00682-PssBenedikte-1947-4-20a.jpg\n\nDSC00684-PssAnneMarie-1947-4-20a.jpg\n\nDSC00677-royals right.jpg\n\nPrincess Viggo, Countess of Rosenborg, 1961\n\nEleanor Margaret Green was born in New York City, New York, USA on November 5th, 1895.\n\nShe married in New York City, on June 10th, 1924 HRH Prince Viggo Christian Adolf Georg of Denmark. As the marriage was not given the consent of the King and the Danish Government. Prince Viggo renounced his rights of succession along with the title of Prince of Denmark and the qualification of Royal Highness and assumed the style of HH Prince Viggo, Count af Rosenborg (the traditional title given to a Danish prince who marries without consent and who loses his title). By Convention his wife took his title and status and was known as HH Princess Viggo, Grevinde af Rosenborg\n\nThe \"demotion\" from HRH to HH was interesting as he was born HH Prince Viggo Christian Adolf Georg of Denmark. As grandchildren of the sovereign this was the usual title. (It is only the children of the monarch -and the son's wives - that are HRH. However on February 5, 1904 the children of HRH Prince Valdemar of Denmark were all raised to the rank of HRH).\n\nIt appears that Danish royals go down one rung when they marry without consent. HRH's of Denmark become HH's of Rosenborg and HH's of Denmark become HE's of Rosenborg.\n\nIt is interesting that as a HH of Rosenborg, Princess Viggo was awarded the Elephant in 1961. This is the only example of a Countess of Rosenborg receiving the Elephant. However not all have been HH?s, most HE?s. While not a princess of Denmark by marriage, her role in the royal family must have been popular for her to be given this award.\n\nHer shield is located next to the right of Princess Margaretha?s and Princess Elisabeth?s in the back left corner of the chapel. It shows her marital arms. On the right we see what must be the arms attributed to the Green family - three golden stags on a blue shield. On the left we see those of Prince Viggo after his marriage - \"Rosenborg\"\n\nViggo and two of his brothers Aafe and Erik married without the King?s consent, all being styled \"HH Prince NN, Count of Rosenborg\". The three of them were granted the same arms: A golden shield with a blue crowned lion over three red hearts. (This represents a third of the Danish royal arms - three blue lions surrounded by nine red hearts). Their children as Counts of Rosenborg were entitled to a different coat of arm quartering the arms above with an image of Rosenborg Castle. This image is also attached for those that are interested.\n\nOne final note, the lion in Prince Viggo's arms is shown as facing right, when it should be facing left. It is paying deferrence to the arms of his wife, by facing hers.\n\nPrincess Viggo died in Copenhagen on July 3rd, 1966. Prince Viggo died on January 4th, 1970. The Prince's arms - as a HRH of Denmark - as on the wall directly opposite those of his wife.\n\nAttachments\n\nDSC00661PssViggo-1961-3-11a.jpg\n\nRosenborg.jpg\n\nQueen Margrethe, Master of the Royal Orders, 1972.\n\nIn 1972, Crown Princess Margrethe succeeded her father as the Danisk monarch, reigning as Margrethe 2.\n\nAs such she became the \"grand master\" of the royal orders.\n\nA special large shield (roughly four times the size of other shields in the chapel) of the arms of the monarch surrounded by both the Elephant and the Dannebrog, hangs in pride of place at the orders chapel - on the main back wall, to the left of the organ. (The shield just shows the crowned arms of the sovereign surrounded by the ribbons and collars of the two orders. It does not state the monarchs name, when they recevied the order/s or became master.)\n\nBelow it hang the arms of the Prince Consort, their two children and Prince Joachim's wife Princess Alexandra. (See attched photos).\n\nThe Royal arms of the Monarch changed with the Queen's succession. She simplified the arms.\n\nYou can read about the royal arms at the royal Family website...\n\nhttp://kongehuset.dk/artikel.php?dogtag=k_en_his_arm\n\nYou can also find discussion about the changes ot the royal arms here...\n\nhttp://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/denmark.htm#kongevaben\n\nAttachments\n\nElephant-QMII-001a.jpg\n\nDSC00646-royal-arms.jpg\n\nPrincess Anne, 1974\n\nAnne Ferelith Bowes-Lyon was the daughter of Hon. John Herbert Bowes-Lyon (of the Earls of Strathmore and Kinghorne) and Hon. Fenella Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis (of the Baron's Clinton).\n\nShe was born on 4 December 1917 at Washington DC, USA. She married Major Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (son of Thomas Edward Anson, 4th Earl of Lichfield and Evelyn Maud Keppel) on 28 April 1938. She and Major Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson were divorced in 1948.\n\nShe married HH Georg, Prince of Denmark, son of HRH Axel, Prince of Denmark and HRH Margareta, Princess of Sweden, on 16 September 1950 at Glamis Castle, Glamis, Angus, Scotland.\n\nPrincess Anne of Denmark was awarded the Order of the Elephant by Queen Margrethe 2 on the 16th of April 1974.\n\nPrincess Anne's shield is displayed directly below that of Princess Viggo - see pictures in posts above - on the bottom right of the grouping of royal arms. The shield of her husband HH Prince Georg is displayed directly opposite, on the bottom right hand side of the opposing wall of the alcove.\n\nThe shield shows her marital arm, with Denmark being marshalled with the her family arms: those famous Bows and Lions of the Bowes-Lyon family. I will point out the royal augmentation to the arms from 1937. As a tribute to the family providing a Queen for the United Kingdom, the Earl's family arms deceived the following addition... An inescutcheon, en surtout azure, thereon a rose argent, ensigned with an Imperial crown proper, within a double tressure flory counterflory of the second, the said inescutcheon ensigned with an Earl's coronet proper. (The crowned white rose of York symbolising the King and Queen's previous title.)\n\nPrincess Anne died on 26 September 1980 at age 62 at London, England, UK.\n\nAttachments\n\nDSC00659-AnneBowesLyon-1974-4-16a.jpg"
