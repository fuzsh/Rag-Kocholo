        "text": "2nd – 5th April 1903\n\nIn April 1903 two significant events took place in Denmark. On the 8th the country’s King for many years, Christian IX, celebrated his 85th birthday. As many know he was said to be the father-in-law of Europe, his descendants destined to sit on many of Europe’s thrones. By this time his eldest daughter, Alexandra, was consort of the King the United Kingdom. His youngest son, Wilhelm, was sitting on the Greek throne, while another of his daughters, Dagmar, had already been widowed from her husband Alexander III, Emperor of All Russia. And only a few years later one of his grandsons, Prince Carl, would accept the throne of Norway as Haakon VII. To celebrate the old King many of his Royal children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren gathered in Copenhagen.\n\nBut even before this big day another important occasion had taken place. On April 2nd the German Emperor Wilhelm II arrived at the Danish capital to pay a four day visit to the neighbouring Kingdom. The relationship between the two entities had not always been on the best of terms, to put it mildly. It had come to a definite low under the Second Schleswig War in 1864 when Denmark was attacked by German forces and was in the end forced to cede a large part of the country to victors. Emperor Wilhelm II’s visit was seen as a way to improve the relationship between the two states.\n\nDay one\n\nThe welcome\n\nThe State Banquet\n\nDay two\n\nMorning program\n\nAfternoon program\n\nThe Crown Prince’s Soire\n\nDay three\n\nMorning program\n\nAfternoon program\n\nThe Gala Concert\n\nDay four\n\nMorning program – Church Service\n\nAfternoon program – Frederiksborg visit\n\nPalace Banquet\n\nDay one and the welcome\n\nHis Imperial Majesty sailed from Germany onboard the Imperial Yacht SMY “Hohenzollern” escorted by another two vessels from the Imperial Navy: SMS “Nymphe” and SMS “Sleipner”. Prince Albert of Glücksburg, a nephew of King Christian IX, was travelling together with the Emperor. Sailing into the harbour of Copenhagen the elegant white Imperial Yacht was flying the German Imperial Standard from the main mast and the Danish naval ensign from the mizzen-mast (the mast at the rear of the ship). Gun salutes were heard both from the ships of the Danish Navy present in the harbour and from land. When the German Emperor’s yacht had moored next to the Danish Royal Yacht, “Dannebrog” a small boat left the pier. Onboard were representatives from the German Legation headed by the German Minister to Denmark. They were the first to present their respects to the Emperor before His Imperial Majesty stepped onto Danish soil again. Then another barge set out towards the Imperial Yacht. It was the motorized Admiralty’s barge. In addition to the small crew it contained the Danish King, the Crown Prince and Prince Christian of Denmark. As the Danish Royal Party boarded the Imperial Yacht the Danish Royal Standard was hoisted, taking its place next to the Imperial Standard. Cannons from the German ships returned the gun salute. The Emperor greeted them enthusiastically and King Christian welcomed him to Denmark. They then greeted the King’s nephew, His Highness Prince Albert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, who had accompanied the Emperor during the voyage from Germany. The meeting only lasted for about five minutes before the Danish King ascended down the gangway again followed by the Emperor, the Danish Crown Prince, Prince Christian and Prince Albert. The Danish Royal Party boarded the motorized Admiralty’s barge while the Emperor boarded his own barge which had been lowered from the Imperial Yacht. It was reported in the press that the Emperor preferred to be rowed instead of being brought to land onboard the motorized barge. As soon as the Danish King abandoned the Imperial Yacht the Danish Royal Standard was lowered. Likewise the Imperial Standard was lowered when the Emperor abandoned the ship and it was now instead flying from the Imperial barge. The Danish Flag was then taken from the mizzen-mast and hoisted to the top of the main mast. From the mizzen-mast the German flag was now hoisted. A peculiar “dance” of flags, but by following this protocol it left no doubt about where the Royal personages were at any time, not even from a distance.\n\nWhen the Emperor arrived at the pier of the Toldboden, the area of the Copenhagen Custom House, he was received by the Danish King and Crown Prince who had arrived just a few minutes earlier. Here he first greeted the remaining members of the Danish Royal Family present: Their Royal Highnesses Prince Waldemar, Prince Carl and Prince Harald. Present was also His Highness Prince Hans of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a brother of King Christian.\n\nHis Imperial Majesty wore the uniform of a Grand Admiral in the Imperial Navy. Fixed to his uniform were the Stars of the Danish Order of the Elephant and the Prussian Order of the Black Eagle. His Majesty the King of Denmark honoured his Imperial guest by wearing the uniform of the Prussian Uhlan Cavalry, also with the Stars of the Order of the Black Eagle and the Elephant. He also wore a large badge in a Neck-tie – a large Star – but it is not possible to make a positive identification of this order. It could either be a German one – the Order of the Red Eagle in that case – (more likely due to the couture of the shape) or the Danish Order of the Dannebrog.\n\nHis Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederick also donned a German uniform, that of a Hussar. Like his father and the Emperor one could see the Stars of the Order of the Black Eagle and the Order of the Elephant shine on his uniform. Of his three sons only the eldest, Prince Christian (the later King Christian X) wore German uniform, also a Hussar uniform. Prince Carl was dressed in a uniform of the Danish Navy. As he would only receive the German Order of the Black Eagle during the exchange of gifts at the Palace he for now only wore the Star of the Danish Order of the Elephant. The same was the case for Prince Harald, who was dressed in a Danish Hussar uniform.\n\nPrince Valdemar wore his naval uniform and though it is not possible to establish at this moment what orders he wore, it is very likely that he wore both the Star of the Danish Order of the Elephant and the German Order of the Black Eagle – which he had received during a previous visit of the Emperor to Denmark in 1888.\n\nThe King then followed the Emperor to the line of representatives from the official Denmark and dignitaries and introduced them to His Imperial Majesty. They were all in their splendid uniforms. A smiling and charming Emperor greeted them all graciously. Once the introductions were done the King and Emperor inspected the Guard of Honour made up of the Lifeguards while the band played “Heil dir im Siegeskranz”. Many onlookers had gathered around the square and as the Emperor and the King got into the awaiting carriage one could hear great cheers from the crowd. The Emperor was first in getting into the carriage from where he politely helped the old King getting in.\n\nAt Amalienborg Palace more members of the extended Royal Family were expecting the arrival of the procession. Most of those attending the 85th birthday celebrations of King Christian IX had already arrived. So both Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom and Ireland and Her Imperial Majesty Empress Marie (Dagmar) of Russia were present to greet the German Emperor. Her Royal Highness Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, Duchess of Västergotland had also arrived and joined in the welcoming of Wilhelm II. So did the ladies of the Danish Royal Family with the Crown Princess at its head. It should be fair to say that the German Emperor was not the favourite relative of any of them, but nevertheless the greetings were cordial. During his stay Wilhelm II was residing in the Christian VII’s Palace in the Amalienborg Palace complex.\n\nFirst day State Banquet\n\nIn the evening King Christian IX hosted a glittering banquet for his August guest in the Great Hall of Christian VII’s Palace. The hall had been splendidly decorated and the grand table was a revelation. Plates were of silver and Danish porcelain with a Saxony pattern as well as the famous Flora Danica pattern. Places in the middle of the grand table was the silver\n\nThe banquet started at 19:30. His Majesty went personally to the guest apartment to fetch the Emperor. Invitations had gone out to the Government as well as the Presidents of the Parliament, representatives of the foreign Legations, the Chancellor of the University and Court officials among others. A list of the attendees can be found further down (though probably not complete).\n\nThe Royal procession was headed by the Emperor escorting Queen Alexandra. King Christian followed closely behind with his daughter the Dowager Empress of Russia at his side. Princess Marie of Denmark then followed at the side of the Crown Prince. The Crown Princess was escorted by Prince Valdemar and Prince Christian came next with Princess Ingeborg. Next couple was Prince Carl with Princess Alexandrine and behind them Prince Harald with Miss Knollys (lady-in-waiting to the Queen of the United Kingdom and Ireland), Prince Albert of Glücksburg with Princess Thyra and finally Prince Hans of Glücksburg with Miss Ozeroff (lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Empress of Russia).\n\nDress and jewels\n\nWhile His Majesty still wore the German Uhlan uniform the Emperor had changed into his German Dragoon Guard uniform.\n\nThe Royal ladies were a glittering spectacle, dressed in their exquisite gowns and wearing blazing jewels:\n\nMorning Program of the second day\n\nMore glitter would follow the next day, when Crown Prince Frederick hosted a soiree for the Imperial guest. But previous to that the Emperor had a full program ahead of him. In the morning he, the Crown Prince and Prince Valdemar drove out from Amalienborg to the National Museum housed in what is called the Prince’s Mansion, a rococo building from 1684. It receives its name as it was at some point used as the residence of the Danish Crown Princes. Here the Royal Party was shown pieces from the museum’s collection of important prehistoric objects like the copies of the Golden Horns of Gallehus (sadly the originals were stolen and melted down for their gold in 1802). Another object shown was the Dejbjerg wagon.\n\nThe group then went on to the Thorvaldsen Museum situated close to Christiansborg Palace. This museum was erected in memory of the Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. He was an internationally renowned Danish sculptor working in the neo-classical style – which would fit the Emperor’s tastes in art. In fact he owned himself copies of the low reliefs displayed at the museum.\n\nNext the Royal group drove to the Royal Copenhagen – or Royal Porcelain Factory as it is officially named – to do some shopping. The Emperor must have liked what he saw because he bought a selection of vases, plates and decorative figurines. It had also been the intention to pay a visit to the court jeweller Michelsen’s shop, but as the Emperor had spent more time in the museums and the porcelain shop than scheduled they had ran out of time. Instead the Emperor asked to have a selection of his goods brought to the Palace for him to have a look at them there at his own convenience.\n\nHe returned to Amalienborg and a curious crowd had gathered outside hoping to get a glimpse of the Emperor. A military band played in the court yard and even they expected the Emperor to come to the window. However, both the crowd and the band were in for a disappointment as His Imperial Majesty remained hidden from view inside his apartment.\n\nThe afternoon of the second day\n\nAt one o’clock it was time for lunch at the German Legation. As the legation’s building was relatively small there was not room for more than 30 guests. The Emperor had requested that among those 30 there should be representatives from the arts as well as science, trade and sailing. He was duly presented with a list of suitable candidates from which a very few had been selected by the Emperor himself.\n\nThe German Minister’s offices had been converted into temporary reception rooms and the dining room on the first floor elegantly decorated. Lilacs and laburnum arranged on the table had been brought all the way from Italy and combined with garlands of evergreen. After having received all the guests the Emperor headed the procession into the dining room with the wife of the Minister by his side. At the table he had the Minister himself on his left side.\n\nLunch lasted a couple of hours before the Emperor again was on the move. In the company of the Crown Prince and Prince Valdemar he took the train to Klampenborg, a northern suburb of Copenhagen. Here they were taken around the renowned Jægersborg Deer Park in horse-drawn carriages.\n\nIn the afternoon he was also able to pay a visit to the Royal Danish Yacht Club. This visit had not been in the original program and preparations had to be made hastily when it was decided that the Emperor would like to inspect the premises of the club. One could say that it was lucky that he was already in the company of both the honorary president (the Danish Crown Prince) and the honorary chairman (Prince Valdemar) of the club. Present to receive the Emperor and his company were the club’s chairman Captain Tuxen who had also been present at the lunch at the German Legation.\n\nThe Crown Prince’s Soiree\n\nThe day ended with a soiree hosted by the Crown Prince at Amalienborg. It was again time for regal glitter and elegance as beautifully dressed ladies joined the gentlemen dressed in either splendid uniforms or white tie wearing their grandest orders. A truely colourful spectacle. Many onlookers had gathered in the square in the hope of catching a glimpse of the many guests arriving. About 300 invitations had been sent out and in the time up to nine o’clock there was a constant coming and going of carriages bringing the privileged ones to the entrance of the Crown Prince’s Palace. Then some minutes after nine a fanfare was heard signalling that His Majesty was on his way. He was brought over from Christian VII’s Palace in a carriage together with his guest.\n\nDuring the soiree music was played while a standing buffet was served and the people moved around in the different rooms to mingle. A seating area had been arranged for the Royal Party only. Again the Royal Ladies had outdone themselves and they wore the most exquisite gowns and jewels:\n\nThose ladies in the possession of the Russian Order of St. Catherine wore its red Sash.\n\nMorning Program on the third day\n\nOn the first day of the visit King Christian had offered the Emperor to become an honorary Admiral in the Royal Danish Navy, something which Wilhelm had accepted with pleasure. So in this new capacity the Emperor received a delegation from the Danish Navy headed by Vice Admiral Uldall on the morning of his third day in Denmark. He again expressed great pleasure at having been awarded this honour. Normally an appointment to such an honorary rank would have been planned and announced well in advance of the visit. But in this case the appointment had come as a great surprise to most, the Emperor included. One of the reasons why this usually was arranged previous to the start of the visit was so that a proper uniform could be made beforehand and could thus be worn by the honoured person during the visit. As such preparation had not been possible to be made in this case a new uniform was tailored as quickly as possible so that the Emperor would still be able to wear it at some point before ending the stay in Denmark.\n\nAfter having received the delegation from the Navy the Emperor together with the Crown Prince, Prince Valdemar and Prince Albert of Glücksburg to Roskilde by train. They were met at Roskilde Railway Station by an enthusiastic crowd. The crowd had patiently waited in the rain in order to get a look at the Royal visitors and welcomed them with cheers as the Emperor and his followers got into the carriages that would take them to the cathedral. Here, while the organist played softly, the Emperor entered Christian V’s chapel. Queen Louise, King Christian’s beloved wife had died in 1898 and her coffin had been placed in this chapel. With great solemnity he placed a considerable wreath of palm leaves, orchids, roses and violets on the Queen’s coffin. Having completed this private ceremony the Emperor was given a short tour of the cathedral before it was time to head back to Copenhagen.\n\nThe construction of the current City Hall of Copenhagen had begun in 1892. And it would not be complete until 1905. But Emperor Wilhelm was eager to see the progress and expressed a wish to see the building site. It had not been in the original programme but the necessary arrangements were made in order for the visit to take place. The Mayor had only received the call from Captain Qvist in the morning that very same day conveying him the wish of the Emperor. Due to the short time the Emperor also expressed his wish that no official reception take place and that he would be more than pleased to just have the Mayor and the architect show him around the site. Some effort was still made to make the reception a bit more formal and some uniformed city hall personnel were present at the entrance when the Emperor arrived. With him were also Crown Prince Frederick, Prince Valdemar and Prince Albert of Glücksburg. After having been shown around and just before leaving the Emperor signed his name in the guest book, as did the Crown Prince and Prince Albert. Prince Valdemar was also asked to sign it but he said that he would surely return to the City Hall shortly and would have the opportunity to sign the guest book then.\n\nIn the afternoon\n\nIn the afternoon the Emperor and his entourage paid a visit to Rosenborg Castle. Here they were met at the entrance by the Museum Director Dr. phil. Rollerup, and curators Dr. phil. Brock and Behring-Liisberg. The tour of the museum commenced immediately after the reception and to the Emperor’s regret it had to be made quicker than desired due to delay in his schedule. His Imperial Majesty showed a great interest and kept asking his guides questions during the entire tour. Naturally he was especially fascinated by the Brandenburg pieces in the collection, like the portraits of Queen Dorothea and Princess Sophia Dorothea, a daughter of Elector George of Brandenburg. It also included porcelain dating back to 1585, which had been gifted by King Christian III’s granddaughter Markgravine Sophie of Brandenburg, and a gun that had belonged to King Frederick I of Prussia. In addition the Emperor was shown a vase from 1714 depicting the arms of Denmark, Russia, Poland and Prussia – all countries that had joined an alliance against the Swedish King Charles XII. This object had been brought out from its normal place especially for this visit.\n\nConcluded the tour of the museum the Emperor was driven back to Amalienborg Palace where he would receive some German gentlemen who had wished to have an audience with him before attending the dinner hosted by King Christian IX.\n\nBanquet and Gala Concert\n\nAfter His Majesty’s dinner the Royal party ended the day with a gala concert at the Odd Fellow Mansion. Entry fees were charged as the concert was in aid of raising funds for a monument over the Danish composer Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann who had died in 1900. The concert was scheduled to start at eight o’clock and the Royal Party was expected to attend. So when there had been no signs of them by eight was decided to delay the concert in the hope that the Royal Personages were on their way and would present themselves shortly. Seats close to the stage had been prepared for them and all was ready. But when the Royal Audience had still not showed up by eight thirty the decision was made to begin without them. Only when the Ossian Overture by Neils Gade had finished did the Royal Party arrive.\n\nThe audience stood up as the Royal Party moved up the middle aisle towards the seats that had been prepared for them. His Majesty the King was seated closest to the stage and the orchestra. Next to him sat the Emperor, then Queen Alexandra, Crown Prince Frederick and Empress Marie Feodorovna. Behind them came Prince Valdemar, Lieutenant General Hedemann and Count zu Eulenburg, the High Marshal of the German court. Next to the Dowager Empress sat on the first row the Danish Crown Princess who had Prince Albert of Glücksburg on her other side. Princess Marie followed next and then Princess Ingeborg, Princess Thyra and Prince Carl. Behind this group were Prince Harald and members of their entourage.\n\nAgain the Royal Ladies made a wonderful impression.\n\nDay 4 – Morning program\n\nOriginally the plan had been for the Emperor to stay three days in Copenhagen. But after the continued insistence of the Danish King the stay was prolonged for another day. Or at least that was the official version of it. In any case, the Emperor did stay for a fourth day. And that provided the newspapers with more to write about and no doubt the readers were welcoming the chance of reading about yet another glittering occasion at the Danish court.\n\nBut the day started with a visit to church. It was a wet and cold Sunday, but a Sunday none the less. It had not been publicly stated where the Emperor wished to attend church, but a crowd had still managed to gathered in front of Frederik Chruch, also called the Marble Church, where it was that the Royal Party attended the Sunday Service. His Imperial Majesty drove to church in the company of his host His Majesty King Christian IX and Her Majesty Queen Alexandra and Her Majesty the Dowager Empress Marie. Also attending the service were Crown Prince Frederick, Prince Christian, Princess Alexandrine, Princess Ingeborg and Princess Thyra.\n\nAfter the service the Royal Party drove back to Amalienborg Palace, still with the rain pouring down. Again curious members of the public had gathered at the Palace square in the hope of today being able to see the Emperor at the window of his apartment. A military band had lined up playing some marches and the German National anthem, “Heil dir im Siegerkranz”. But the Emperor remained out of site. At one o’clock lunch was taken before the Emperor and his entourage travelled out to Hillerød, also known as Frederiksborg. Like for the visit to the City Hall this visit had not been included in the original official program. In fact it was not expected that the Emperor would pay the town a visit during this stay as he had already visited the town during his previous stay in Denmark. He had then visited the museum at Frederiksborg Castle and also the great park there. But even so, though the authorities at Hillerød had not been warned about the visit, they had in fact taken some precautions. For instance they had installed a gift made by the Emperor to King Christian in the form of a copy of King Frederick I’s marble sarcophagus. The original is found in Schleswig cathedral.\n\nAfternoon – day four\n\nThe special train from Copenhagen to Hillerød with the Emperor onboard arrived at Hillerød at 15:20. He was in the company of the Crown Prince, Prince Valdemar and Prince Albert of Glücksburg. As the rain had stopped the Royal Party drove in open carriages to Frederiksborg Castle where the Museum of National History is housed. The Royal Visitors were given an extensive tour, which included a view of the Emperor’s gift. He expressed his approval of the installation of the sarcophagus copy and showed great interest in the rest of the museum.\n\nThe tour lasted for about an hour, during which time it has started to snow. So when they drove back to the railway station they did so in closed carriages.\n\nPalace Banquet\n\nBack at Amalienborg Palace the Emperor and those who had accompanied him managed to get some rest before it was time to dress for the last glittering event to take place during this visit. The Danish King again hosted a glittering banquet at the Amlienborg Palace complex. The decoration was again exquisite. As Easter was just around the corner the florists had made the floral arrangements with that in mind and there was an abundance of narcissus and violets on the table. As it was the “silent week” before Easter no music was played during the banquet.\n\nThe Emperor was finally able to dress in his newly completed uniform of an Admiral in the Danish Navy, while the King and Crown Prince were still wearing German uniforms in honour of the guest.\n\nAs for the previous banquets the Royal Procession into the Dining Room was headed by the Guest of Honour. The Emperor looked very smart in his new uniform and donning the pale blue Sash of the Order of the Elephant. He walked with the Queen of the United Kingdom at his side. Behind them came the Danish King leading his daughter the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna. The honour of escorting the Danish Crown Princess had fallen on Prince Valdemar while Prince Valdemar’s wife Princess Marie was escorted by the Danish Crown Prince. Prince Christian followed next with Princess Ingeborg at his right hand side while Prince Carl walked beside Princess Alexandrine. The ladies were again ablaze with jewels and sequins:"
