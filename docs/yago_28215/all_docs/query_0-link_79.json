While a mere boy her eldest son, the Crown Prince, was caught one day trying to bamboozle one of the sentries of the Royal Guard, of whom the little Prince demanded that he should present arms for him.\n\nAccording to court etiquette, a royal child is entitled to a “shoulder arms” salute until his confirmation, when “present arms” is the salute to be given by all sentries. The boy Prince demanded the latter salute, but the sentry stuck to his orders and refused to obey the request.\n\nThe Queen obliged the Prince to go down and ask the soldier’s pardon “for unbefitting attitude and rudeness,” and having done this properly, he was locked into his room for two consecutive days. —Boston Transcript, 1898"
