        "text": "You might have noticed that a trend has been happening in the music industry in the past years, namely artists making the news for selling their music catalogs for huge lumps of money. It used to be that only legendary icons who had long retired from the music business had their music catalog sold to other entities - or so we thought.Â\n\nWe didnât give the phenomenon much thought at all until these types of sales started happening more and more, and even young artists like Justin Bieber or Katy Perry parted ways with their music catalogs. But these deals seem to be very popular among established artists nowadays, and a good way to make huge profits by just signing a dotted line.Â\n\nSo, we thought weâd have a look at the biggest music catalog sales of all time, to see which artists made the best out of their opportunities. Selling your music catalog can be a smart move, and it can land you quite a pretty penny. The important thing is to make sure the timing is right - more often than not, your chances of a good deal are higher when youâre at the height of your career. Once an artist drops in popularity and their music is no longer in demand, a catalog deal might not be as profitable as it could have been in the past. So, if you want to make big bucks from selling your music catalog, like the artists below managed to do, youâll need to pick the right moment and take the opportunity when it comes.Â\n\nQueen | $1.27 Billion\n\nTalks of the deal between Sony and Queen to acquire the iconic bandâs entire catalog had been rumored for years now, but the deal was confirmed to be happening by Variety in June of 2024, for a whopping $1.27 billion. The deal took a lot of maneuvering and creativity, due to complications regarding the bandâs international rights: Queenâs recorded music rights in the U.S. and Canada were sold to Disney at some point in the 2000âs for an undisclosed amount, and those rights will be staying with Disney in perpetuity. The band memberâs royalties, however, are going straight to Sony.Â\n\nBruce Springsteen | $500 Million\n\nBruce Springsteen isnât known around the world as âThe Bossâ for no reason. Heâs one of the most prolific, and most successful, singer-songwriters in American history, and the numbers serve to validate that assumption. The Boss sold his music catalog in late 2021 for a whopping $500 million, to Sony Entertainment Music. The deal gave Sony complete rights over iconic works such as âBorn in the USA,â âThe River,â or âBorn to Run.â The agreement included both Springsteenâs recordings and his songwriting rights, and it was by far the priciest music catalog deal in history at the time.Â\n\nBob Dylan | $500 Million\n\nComing in close is another music industry heavyweight, the legendary Bob Dylan. Besides winning both an Academy Award and a Nobel Prize, Dylan also landed one of the priciest music catalog deals in history. He sold his songwriting catalog in late 2020 for around $300 million to Universal Music Publishing Group. The company thus gained the rights to unforgettable works such as âLike a Rolling Stoneâ or âBlowinâ in the Wind.â Just one year later in 2021, Dylan also sold the rights to his recorded works, aka the master rights, to Sony Music Entertainment, for a reported $200 million.Â\n\nPhil Collins & Genesis | $300 Million\n\nWho can forget Peter Gabrielâs unique haircut back in the early days of Genesis, or the groovy, Phil Collins-led hit âInvisible Touch?â Another unforgettable moment in the bandâs history happened in 2022, when Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, the remaining members of Genesis, sold their publishing rights to Concord Music Group for $300 million. The deal also included the solo works of Collins, Banks, and Rutherford, but not those of Peter Gabriel and other former band members.Â\n\nSting | $300 Million\n\nThe list continues with another British music legend, Sting, who parted ways with his entire songwriting catalog in 2022 for a handsome $300 million. The deal included the artistâs solo works, as well as the rights for music created during his stint as frontman of the iconic group The Police. Hit singles like âRoxanne,â âEvery Breath You Take,â âAn Englishman in New York,â or âFields of Goldâ are now owned by Universal Music Group. The catalog spans more than 600 songs from the Sting and The Police repertoire.Â\n\nTina Turner | $300 Million\n\nThe deal signed between Turner and BMG in 2021 was reported to be worth over $300 million, signing away the artistâs back catalog of the last six decades, including her share of solo recordings and publishing rights, as well as the rights to her likeness and name. The singer of âWhatâs Love Got To Do With Itâ remained signed under Warner Records until her death in 2023 at 83 years old, working closely with the company to âmaintain and develop her musical treasure trove and safeguard her inspirational legacy.âÂ\n\nKISS | $300 Million\n\nThe hard rock band formed in 1970's NYC sold its entire music catalog, brand name and IP in 2024 to Pophouse Entertainment Group. The deal is estimated to be well over $300 million, and is just the latest in a series of collaborations between the famous rock group and the Swedish entertainment company co-founded by ABBA singer BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus.Â\n\nDavid Bowie | $250 Million\n\nThe unique talent of David Bowie sadly left us in January 2016, but his iconic works will never be forgotten. In late 2021, Warner Chappell Music bought the publishing rights to Bowieâs works for a reported $250 million. The deal included publishing rights for hit singles like âHeroes,â âSpace Oddity,â âLetâs Dance,â âZiggy Stardust,â and âUnder Pressure.â Besides the rights for all the 26 studio albums released by Bowie during his career, the deal also included rights for his earlier work. This includes the rights to the two albums released during Bowieâs time with the band Tin Machine, and all of his soundtrack works.Â\n\nKaty Perry | $225 Million\n\nThe impressive deal was struck between Perry and Litmus Music in 2023, with multiple sources reporting on the $225 million price tag. The deal includes the artistâs five-album back catalog, from the period of 2008 to 2020, though the masters of the albums themselves are still owned by Universal Music Group.Â\n\nDr. Dre | $200+ Million\n\nOriginally pitched at $250 million, Dr. Dre sold his music catalog â including two of his solo albums and shares of N.W.A royalties, producer royalties, and shares of his work which he doesnât own publishing rights to â for well over $200 million in 2023, in two separate deals with Shamrock Holdings and Universal Music Group.Â\n\nJustin Bieber | $200+ Million\n\nSold to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023 for over $200 million, the deal includes all music recorded by Bieber up until 2022, including the artistâs publishing copyright and performance rights, master recordings and neighboring rights, making the acquisition a historic one. As Hipgnosis states: âThis acquisition ranks among the biggest deals ever made for an artist under the age of 70.â\n\nNeil Young | $150 Million\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter sold a 50% stake of his music catalog spanning almost 50 albums, including worldwide copyright and income interest, to Hipgnosis in 2021. The deal, which is estimated to be worth around $150 million, gives Hipgnosis the rights to half of the income generated by the use of Neil Youngâs music in TV, film, and advertisements.Â\n\nMÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e | $150 Million\n\nAfter a long period of negotiation, BMG purchased the rights for heavy metal juggernaut MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼eâs entire recorded music catalog in 2021. Though sources appear to be unsure over the actual amount awarded for the bandâs catalog, a reason for this could be that part of the money was paid right away, with the other half delivered after the band finished its 2022 North America summer tour, which would (in theory) have driven up the groupâs streaming stats, raising the catalogâs revenue.Â\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers | $140+ Million\n\nThe beloved California native band sold their entire catalog to Hipgnosis in 2021, including all 11 albums released in their 40-year-long career. Details of the deal havenât been officially shared, but it seems the band has kept the rights to their masters, but sold all publishing rights to the music IP investment company for upwards of $140 million.Â Â\n\nFleetwood Mac | $100+ Million\n\nAll of Fleetwood Macâs members have sold big percentages of their music catalogs, if not the entire thing! Stevie Nicks began the trend in 2020, when she sold 80% of her music catalog to Primary Wave for $100 million, followed in 2021 by Lindsay Buckingham and Mick Fleetwood, who sold the publishing rights for over 160 songs to Hipgnosis, and the entirety of his music catalog to BMG, respectively. Itâs worth noting that the sale by Buckingham and Fleetwood came after the resurgence of the bandâs hit single Dreams on TikTok. Lastly, Christine McVie sold her own catalog in 2021 to Hipgnosis, and after her passing in 2023, her stake in Fleetwood Macâs recorded music was sold to global entertainment investment firm HarbourView Equity Partners for a yet-to-be revealed amount.Â\n\nDavid Guetta | $100 Million\n\nThe partnership deal between the producer-DJ and Warner Music Group made in 2021 includes the sale of the artistâs back catalog of recorded music from the last 20 years, and new terms for the rights of future recordings. WMG never did share details of the agreementâs terms, but itâs safe to say the deal amounted to around $100 million, especially considering the inclusion of future recordings, making it so only time will be able to tell just how much the catalog of one of the most listened to artists in the world was worth to Warner Music.Â\n\nRod Stewart | $100 MillionÂ\n\nThe British singer-songwriter sold his share of publishing and recorded music rights, as well as a few name and likeness rights to Irving Azoffâs Iconic Artists Group in 2024. Details of the deal have not been publicly shared, but itâs been reported that Stewart was granted upwards of $100 million for the catalog sale.Â\n\nJustin Timberlake | $100 Million\n\nTimberlake signed the multi-million dollar deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2022, giving the company full control over his shares of songs written during his solo career â including hits âSexy Backâ and âCanât Stop The Feelingâ â and throughout his years with âNSync.Â\n\nJason Aldean | $100 Million\n\nCountry musician Jason Aldean sold 90% of his recorded music catalog in 2022 to Spirit Music Group. The deal encompasses the nine albums released by Aldean in the first 14 years of his career, and covers the artistâs share of his master recordings, neighboring rights, and SoundExchange royalties.Â\n\nImagine Dragons | $100 Million\n\nIn 2020, the Las Vegas band sold its entire publishing catalog to Concord Music Publishing. The $100 million plus deal gives Concord publishing rights of hit songs with over 1 billion streams on Spotify like âRadioactiveâ, âBelieverâ, and âThunder.âÂ\n\nLuis Fonsi | $100 Million\n\nThe Latin music singer better-known for his global hit âDespacitoâ sold his publishing catalog to HarbourView Equity Partners in 2022 for a mystery sum, but as the Financial Times reports, the Puerto Rican artistâs catalog couldâve been worth well over $100 million.Â\n\nCalvin Harris | $100 MillionÂ\n\nThe Scottish producer, songwriter, and DJ sold his entire publishing catalog to Vine Investments in 2020. The deal, which was rumored to be worth around $100 million, includes the over 150 songs by the multi-platinum artist, as well as his collaborations with stars like Frank Ocean, Rihanna, and Dua Lipa.Â\n\nFuture | $70 Million\n\nThe prolific rapper, songwriter, and producer sold his music catalog in 2022 to Influence Media Partners in an 8-figure deal rumored to be in the ballpark of around $70 million. The deal concerns the publishing rights royalties of 612 songs, including all of Futureâs songwriting credits from 2004 to 2020. The deal also covers collaborations between Future and other major chart-toppers, like Rihanna, Drake, and the Weeknd.Â\n\nNelly | $50 Million\n\nThe rapper, singer, and actor sold half of his music catalog to HarbourView Equity Partners in 2023. The $50 million dollar deal acquired eight of the artistâs albums and countless hit singles like âRide Wit Me,â âDilemma,â and âHot In Herre,â which was recently featured in global box office smash film Challengers.Â\n\nZZ Top | $50 Million\n\nThe iconic Texas rock band sold their entire music catalog in 2021 for an estimated $50 million in a joint acquisition by Bertelsmann Music Group and KKR & Co., a global investment firm.\n\nHuey Lewis and The News | $20 Million\n\nThe 80âs band hailing from San Francisco responsible for chart-toppers like âThe Heart of Rock & Rollâ and âWorkinâ For A Livinâ sold their entire music catalog to Primary Wave Music in 2022. The deal encompasses the rock bandâs work from its initial debut album up until 1994, including hit single âThe Power of Love,â which was written for 1985 movie classic Back To The Future.Â\n\nIggy AzaleaÂ\n\nIn 2022, âFancyâ Rapper Iggy Azalea sold the rights to her master and publishing back catalog for a mystery, 8-figure sum to Domain Capital. The deal brokered by both her manager and an attorney, also leaves a clause ensuring Azalea can earn future revenue on the master recordings.Â\n\nThe Beach BoysÂ\n\nIn 2021, the revolutionary California rock band sold its entire catalog and other assets for an undisclosed amount to Iconic Artists Group, a company dedicated to âpreserving and amplifying the legacies of legendary artistsâ. The deal encompasses the bandâs sound recordings, brand, memorabilia, musical compositions, and overall intellectual property.Â\n\nShakiraÂ\n\nThe Colombian singer sold her entire music catalog to Hipgnosis in 2021 for an unknown sum. The deal gives Hipgnosis the rights over her 145-song catalog, including hits like âHips Donât Lieâ, âWhenever, Whereverâ, and âWaka Waka.âÂ Â Â\n\nLogicÂ\n\nThe American rapper and singer sold his entire back catalog for an 8-figure amount to Influence Music Partners in 2023. The artistâs catalog includes over 100 songs spanning his 15 year-long career, including both albums and mixtapes.Â\n\nThe KillersÂ\n\nIn 2020, the rock band sold its entire publishing catalog up until then to Eldridge, a holding company. Though the sum of the deal has not been publicly shared, itâs rumored to be in the 8-figure ballpark, considering the deal includes publishing rights for hit songs like âMr. Brightsideâ and âHuman.â\n\nâ\n\n[banner bold_title=\"Get an Advance\" title=\"without losing creative control\" cta_title=\"Get Funded Now\" cta_url=\"https://info.xposuremusic.com/funding?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=funding\"][/banner]\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is a music catalog?Â\n\nA music catalog refers to a comprehensive and organized collection of musical works, recordings, and associated information maintained by a music publisher, record label, or artist. It serves as a database or inventory that encompasses details such as song titles, composers, performers, release dates, and copyright information. Music catalogs play a crucial role in managing the intellectual property of musical content, facilitating licensing and distribution, tracking royalties, and providing a reference for industry professionals. Catalogs can include both current and legacy content, allowing stakeholders to effectively manage, promote, and monetize their musical assets over time.\n\nWhy do musicians sell their music catalogs?\n\nMusicians may choose to sell their music catalogs for various reasons, often driven by financial considerations and strategic planning. Selling a music catalog provides artists with a lump sum of immediate cash, which can be particularly appealing in situations where they seek liquidity or wish to capitalize on the current market value of their catalog. Additionally, selling a catalog can be a way for artists to mitigate financial risks, especially during uncertain economic times. Some musicians may decide to divest their catalogs to take advantage of favorable market conditions or to shift focus towards other creative endeavors without the administrative responsibilities of managing and monetizing their musical assets. Overall, the decision to sell a music catalog is a complex one influenced by a combination of financial, career, and personal factors.\n\nWhich are the biggest music catalog sales of all time?\n\nSome of the biggest music catalog sales include Universal Music Group's acquisition of Bob Dylan's catalog for a reported sum of around $300 million in December 2020. Another significant sale was Hipgnosis Songs Fund's acquisition of a majority stake in the catalog of Neil Young, a deal estimated to be worth approximately $150 million. Additionally, Stevie Nicks reportedly sold a majority stake in her music catalog to Primary Wave Music for around $100 million in December 2020. These high-profile transactions underscore a trend in which artists, or their estates, leverage the current market demand for music catalogs, driven by streaming revenues and a desire for immediate financial gain.\n\nâ\n\nJoin Xposure Music and gain access to some of the best music industry professionals in the U.S. Top experts from Sony, Columbia, Def Jam, or Universal have already joined our platform, and theyâre ready to give invaluable, on-point feedback on your work, which can help you land that dream record deal or publishing deal youâve been working towards.
