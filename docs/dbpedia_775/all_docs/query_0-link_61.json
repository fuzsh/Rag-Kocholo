        "text": "It's like KISS meets Cirque-du-Soleil \"on steroids\"\n\nFormer KISS frontman Paul Stanley says the band’s upcoming avatar show will be ‘mind-bogglingly realistic’ and nothing like the embryonic designs they unveiled in December.\n\nAt the completion of their final show at Madison Square Garden on 2nd December, KISS officially announced their new digital era by unveiling the avatars on the venue’s screens as the band's cover of ‘God Gave Rock and Roll to You’ played.\n\nThe avatars are financed and produced by the Swedish company Pophouse Entertainment, which is behind the ongoing ABBA Voyage show in London.\n\nThe digital incarnations of KISS were met with a mixed response last year, with founding guitarist and notorious naysayer Ace Frehley noting that they were cartoon-like and clearly “geared towards children.”\n\nKISS have since revealed that the avatar development is still in its very early stages and the show won’t launch until 2027.\n\nChatting about the avatars in a new interview with The Allison Hagendorf Show, Paul Stanley has insisted that KISS fans and non-fans alike will be impressed with the final product.\n\n“It was a double-edged sword because we were showing people the avatars in their infancy,” Stanley said of the unveiling in December. “And they look, and will look, nothing like that. They will be mind-bogglingly realistic.\"\n\nConfirming it was more of a “sneak peek”, Stanley continued: “There's good to that and bad. People will look and go, 'Well, that doesn't look anything like them.' But what will be is incredible. The state of the art and what technology can do nowadays is incredible.\n\n“There's a show that's running outside London that sold out for three years, and it's an ABBA show. And Pophouse, the people behind that, are the people who are working with us. And that show is just incredible. And yet that technology is now old. So, George Lucas is involved with the avatars. And the people involved with it are really incredible.\"\n\nStressing that the avatar experience will be different to a KISS concert, Stanley explained (via Blabbermouth): \"We wanna create something that's a go-to and a must-see for everybody. KISS fans will love it, but other people who could care less about KISS will wanna see it. It's going to be mind-boggling.\n\n“It's KISS and Cirque du Soleil and everything you can imagine on steroids. But it will really cross that bridge of what's real and what's not, and combine the two… It will be incredible.\n\n“The idea that we're gonna simulate a live show — leave that to somebody else. We have no desire to do that. We wanna create KISS, which is something that breaks the rules, not lives within 'em.\"\n\nThe A to Z of 'the hottest band in the world', KISS:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
