        "text": "Chinese Songs 🎧 12 Songs in Chinese You Have To Listen To\n\n12 Chinese Songs That Cannot Be Missed\n\nChinese songs are a great way to learn Chinese, but aside from that, there’s actually some decent stuff out there that you’ve probably never stumbled across.\n\nHalf the songs are foreign, no bother there, and half in Chinese… we have a problem.\n\nQuite frankly, it’s time we became all round winners, so we’ve been educating ourselves, and now we’ll be doing exactly the same to you.\n\nBuckle up, grab a cuppa, there’s some classics here.\n\nChinese Song #1 – Tiánmì mì (甜蜜蜜)\n\nChinese Song #2 – Xiǎo píngguǒ (小苹果)\n\nChinese Song #3 – Dāng (当)\n\nChinese Song #4 – Wǒmen de ài (我们的爱)\n\nChinese Song #5 – Tónghuà (童話)\n\nChinese Song #6 – Yuèliàng dàibiǎo wǒ de xīn (月亮代表我的心)\n\nChinese Song #7 – Wěnbié (吻别)\n\nChinese Song #8 – Wǒ yuànyì (我愿意)\n\nChinese Song #9 – Dà yú (大鱼)\n\nChinese Song #10 – Gàobái qìqiú (告白气球)\n\nChinese Song #11 – Shí nián (十年)\n\nChinese Song #12 – Chénmò shì jīn (沉默是金)\n\nFun facts about Chinese Music\n\nBest Selling Chinese Albums of ALL TIME\n\nChinese Song #1 – Tiánmì mì (甜蜜蜜) – Teresa Teng\n\nThis was actually one of the first Chinese songs I discovered and it was thanks to KTV (shock).\n\nKaraoke with a mixture of Chinese and foreigners has the capability of bringing out a whole wealth of different tastes.\n\nWhere else would you go from Oasis > Xiao Pingguo > Kylie Minogue > Teresa Teng?\n\nTeresa Teng is widely regarded as having one of the most beautiful voices in the history of Chinese music and hearing this song for the first time, the thing that struck me was the togetherness of our Chinese friends. It was almost mesmeric.\n\nThe room came together and within 3 or 4 listens I was hooked as well.\n\nWe’ll be bumping into Teresa once again later down the list with her most famous song of all, but this one held a soft spot and grabs our first spot.\n\nSit back and enjoy\n\nChinese Song #2 – Xiǎo píngguǒ (小苹果) – Chopstick Brothers\n\nFrom the downright beautiful to the downright bizarre. That’s Chinese music in a nutshell!\n\nLittle Apple (小苹果) shot to fame in 2014 and never looked back, becoming one of the most popular Chinese songs of the modern era.\n\nIt’s repetitive (albeit fast) nature, makes the song a really good one to learn Chinese and it’s also got that irritating toe-tapping ability meaning once you listen to it, it’s likely to be stuck in your head all day.\n\nWhether that’s good or bad is down to you!!\n\nThe chopstick brothers (great name by the way) consist of the duo Wang Taili (王太利) and Xiao Yang (肖央). The song was actually originally made for the movie Old Boys: The Way of the Dragon before taking off online and making into KTV’s across the country, and further afield.\n\nThe video, put together with the song, creates something that is the complete opposite of our first entry, but hey, that’s Chinese music for you!\n\nIf you like what you hear the song is actually quite easy to learn (the chorus at least)… even more so with our video of the pinyin and English!\n\nCheck it out and impress your Chinese friends at KTV by belting out this crowdpleaser!\n\nChinese Song #3 – Dāng (当) – Power Station\n\n动力火车 which translates to Power Station are a Taiwanese rock band who came to prominence in 1997.\n\nThe band consists of Yu Chiu-hsin and Yen Chih-lin and their distinctive looks (namely their long hair, not so common in the 90’s in China/Taiwan) and energetic rock ballads helped them shoot to the top.\n\nFour years after forming they released their first album “Walking Along Zhongxiao East Road Nine Times”.\n\nThis particular song actually became famous as it was the theme song to the TV drama My Fair Princess. Always a good way to get your name out there!\n\nPower Station have been lucky enough to win 3 star awards, having been nominated for 4 during the period of 1999 and 2015 including the aforementioned TV theme title.\n\nGood going 动力火车\n\nChinese Song #4 – Wǒmen de ài (我们的爱) F.I.R\n\nAnother band from Taiwan step up to the plate here. F.I.R are a 3-piece band from Taiwan who jumped onto the scene in 2004.\n\nWhere does the name F.I.R come from?\n\nQuite simple really. Take the first initial of each band member – Faye (lead vocals), Ian (keyboard) and Real (guitar and vocals).\n\n我们的爱, meaning Our Love, is the band’s most famous song but they are far from just a one hit wonder.\n\nCheck out some of their other hit songs which include Lydia,”, “你的微笑,” and “I Remember”.\n\nFor reference, that 2nd song there translate to your smile!\n\nChinese Song #5 – Tónghuà (童話) – Michael Wong\n\nTónghuà (which translates to fairytale) is the lead song, and also the title of Wong’s 3rd album, released in 21st January 2005.\n\nMichael Wong (王光良) is of Chinese/Malaysian descent and became hugely popular in China due to his ability to reel off multiple, high-quality love songs over and over.\n\nLove songs are hugely popular in China FYI.\n\nDespite releasing 5 albums, it was only until this 3rd one, where he really shot to fame.\n\nBefore 2000, Wong began his singing career in a duo with Victor Wong, however, they went their own ways and thus began the start of something special.\n\nWong has proved his ability on the acting scene also, with appearances in Chinese drama and achieving cult fame throughout mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Malaysia, where he currently resides!\n\nLucky chap, hats off to you Mr Wong, here’s one of his many classics for you to enjoy…\n\nChinese Song #6 – Yuèliàng dàibiǎo wǒ de xīn (月亮代表我的心) – Teresa Teng\n\nQuite possibly the most famous Chinese song of all time…\n\nOur friend Teresa is back again and this one exceeds her first entry, in terms of all round popularity, if online numbers were defining.\n\nThe Moon Represents My Heart is an all time Chinese classic.\n\nThe song was released in 1977 by Teng, who was actually born in Taiwan.\n\nSadly Teng passed away due to an asthma attack in 1995 but her legacy lives on and her music is heard all over Asia every day in or out of KTV!\n\nAccording to The New York Times, it is one of the best-known Chinese pop songs of all time\n\nYou may no longer be with us Teresa, but thanks for the memories…\n\nChinese Song #7 – Wěnbié (吻别) – Jacky Cheung\n\nWe head back to 1993 for the 7th song on our greatest Chinese songs list.\n\nWěnbié (吻别) is actually the name of Jacky Cheung’s 5th album, with the first track of the album taking the same name (goodbye kiss in English).\n\nThe 10 track album enjoyed huge success, as Wikipedia illustrates here:\n\n“The album sold over 5 million copies in 1993 throughout Asia, including 1,360,000 copies in Taiwan alone. It still holds the record as Taiwan’s second greatest selling album”\n\nReference here\n\nThe sign of a top class track can sometimes by defined by who and how many artists cover the song, and this one has enjoyed glowing references from Asian superstars including Jay Chou, Anson Hu and Justin Lo.\n\nCompliments continue to flow for the Hong Kong native which include:\n\nNicknamed – THE GOD OF SONGS\n\nReceived the Honour of Golden Song 35th Anniversary Award in 2012\n\nReceived the Best-Selling Asian Artist in 1995 and 1996\n\nWon a Golden Horse Award for Best Supporting Actor his role in the 1990 film The Swordsman.\n\nYes, he’s an actor too! Here’s his title track to that 5th album\n\nChinese Song #8 – Wǒ yuànyì (我愿意) – Faye Wong\n\n“The Diva” as she is referred to in China. Step up, Faye Wong, Beijing born, before moving to Hong Kong in 1987.\n\nWong is adored throughout Asia and in truth, picking one song from her long repertoire is quite the challenge.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Wong and her school had to hide her strong abilities in singing from her mum. Let’s say she was on the strict side! Wong’s mum saw singing as a dead-end career.\n\nLucky they hid it, and hid it well because Wong was to take not just China, but Asia by storm.\n\nWong has released songs in Mandarin, Cantonese and English.\n\nBelieve it or not, turned down a 3,000,000 Yuan payday to perform in her hometown of Beijing, for the 2008 Olympic Opening Ceremony. This was at the time of her hiatus from performing.\n\nThe song we use here is called “I’m willing” in English and was the top hit from her album Mystery.\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU HEAR? Check out our five favourite Faye Wong Song’s in this blog.\n\nChinese Song #9 – Dà yú (大鱼) – Zhou Shen\n\nZhou Shen was born after some of the above songs were released!\n\nZhou Shen was born in 1992 with his most popular song, Big Fish released in 2016.\n\nBig Fish (the soundtrack to the program Big Fish and the Begonia) made it into the Top 10 Hits Songs of Fresh Asia Music Award in 2016, alongside another song of his also called The Rose and The Deer.\n\nZhou is blessed with a unique, female like voice which actually led to him being too embarrassed to perform in front of people at a younger age.\n\nHigh praise has come from many, including Gao Xiaosong who stated the following:\n\n“Zhou’s voice is ethereal and intangible, like mountain spring that refresh people‘s mind. Zhou’s unique angelic voice is something of a rarity in Chinese Music.”\n\nZhou has also received international acclaim, winning the Best Greater China Act at the MTV Europe awards in 2019.\n\nIf you are in China, and music is your thing, Zhou is still active and touring, so check out his tour dates and get yourself along!\n\nChinese Song #10 – Gàobái qìqiú (告白气球) – Jay Chou\n\nFor anyone with even a smidgen of knowledge of Chinese music, you’ll probably be shocked it’s taken until this far to mention the name Jay Chou.\n\nFor those of you with zero knowledge of Chinese music this name will probably be unfamiliar. Not anymore.\n\nJay Chou (周杰伦 Zhōu Jiélún), born in Taiwan, is probably the biggest name in Chinese music since the turn of the millennium.\n\nHis discography and popularity is so incredibly broad that perhaps one song doesn’t do him any justice at all.\n\nLike many of the artists mentioned above, Jay doesn’t just specialise in Music, oh no. His CV boasts…\n\nMusician, singer, songwriter, record producer, film producer, actor, and director\n\nNot giving anyone else a chance eh, Jay!\n\nThe turn of the new millennium prompted Chou to release his very first album simply titled Jay (2000) at the age of 21.\n\nHe’s enjoyed success throughout Asia but perhaps more significantly compared to some of the above, Chou has broken through into the US and Australia, in the Asian communities at least. No mean feat.\n\nHis list of gongs in music and film are lengthy, so take our word for it, you are dealing with a superstar here!\n\nTo prove this furthermore, Chou had the “honour” of “breaking the Internet” in 2019 when his release broke sales records with his single, “Won’t Cry” which was downloaded more than eight million times.\n\nWOW!\n\nThe song we focus on here is called Love Confession in English and is from the album Jay Chou’s Bedtime Stories and comes from his 14th and most recent album in 2016.\n\nChinese Song #11 – Shí nián (十年) – Eason Chan\n\nTo give you an idea of the popularity of Eason Chan, he was ranked number 6 in the 2013 Forbes China Celebrity Top 100 List.\n\nIn a country of 1.4 billion others, that’s not half bad!\n\nChan, descending from Hong Kong has been active since 1995 and enjoys his acting roles as much as getting up on stage to belt out some of his classics.\n\nHis net worth exceeds 100 million Hong Kong Dollars (pretty much exactly 10 million GBP) and he is another on the list with a plethora of awards and gongs to his name.\n\nIn 2018, Chan was named Best Mandarin Male Singer for the third time.\n\nLet’s enjoy our favourite Chan song below, called Ten Years.\n\nChinese Song #12 – Chénmò shì jīn (沉默是金) – Leslie Cheung\n\nSadly Leslie Cheung is no longer with us, but he left quite the legacy, including this Canto-Classic – “Silence is Golden”\n\nCheung, Hong Kong-Canadian, is widely regarded as “one of the founding fathers of Cantopop” (meaning Cantonese Pop).\n\nCheung proved he could mix not just with Asian heavyweights, but worldwide ones as well, which was illustrated by CNN, who voted him 3rd in the “Most Iconic Musicians of All Time” back in 2010.\n\nHe also enjoyed huge success on TV as much as with his music and debuted in 1977 before announcing his retirement from pop music in 1989. He would return to the music industry just 5 years later however.\n\nIncredibly, to this day Cheung is the only foreign artist ever to hold 16 concerts in Japan, proving his popularity was far more than just in Hong Kong/China\n\nHis incredible legacy came to a hugely sad end for millions of fans in 2003. He was diagnosed with depression and on April 1st 2003, he jumped off the 24th floor of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hong Kong.\n\nBelow is a live performance of Silence is Golden from 1988, just before his brief hiatus from music, with Roman Tam\n\nFun Facts About Chinese Music\n\nChinese music is pretty different to what you might be used to, and for some people it takes time to understand and get your head around what makes the Chinese tick.\n\nHere are some fun facts about Chinese music you probably never knew:\n\nThe Chinese categorise music into different age groups like the post 90s, post 80s etc.\n\nThere are actually a number of KTV (karaoke) specific apps in which the user can download them, sing and record whilst also sharing your voice with your friends, family and also fans via social media! So China!\n\nThe 2nd song on our list 小苹果 actually became a very popular song for outdoor dancing with the older generation of Chinese.\n\nBest Selling Chinese Albums of ALL TIME\n\nSo we’ve given you a rundown of some of China’s most famous songs and their respective artists, but who holds the gong for best selling Chinese album of all time?\n\nWe’ll break it down into two lists for you, Digital Sales and Physical Sales.\n\nTop Selling Chinese Albums of ALL TIME – Physical Sales\n\nCheck out 5th position there, Titanic, an absolute monster in the Chinese music market!
