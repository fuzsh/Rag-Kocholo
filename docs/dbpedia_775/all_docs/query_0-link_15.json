One of the 20th century’s leading bassists and bandleaders, Mingus grew up in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles and performed alongside musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. He composed explicitly political music, and after experiencing and witnessing racial discrimination, he founded his own label — one of the first musicians ever to do so. According to pianist and music journalist Leonard Feather, Mingus linked “older, half-forgotten [jazz] styles” with “the free improvisation of the ‘60s.” After being diagnosed with ALS, Mingus died of a heart attack in 1979.\n\nAlso, today in:\n\n1966 - The Troggs' cover of \"Wild Thing\" (originally performed by The Wild Ones) was released in the U.S. on both the Atco and Fontana labels.

She wrote many hits with her husband Boudleaux, including the Everly Brothers’ “Bye Bye Love,” “All I Have To Do Is Dream,” and “Wake Up Little Susie,” plus Buddy Holly’s hit “Raining In My Heart.” Other acts to record their songs include Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Tony Bennett, Simon and Garfunkel, Sarah Vaughan, Grateful Dead, Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, Beach Boys, Roy Orbison, Elvis Costello, Count Basie, Dean Martin, Ruth Brown, Cher, R.E.M. and Ray Charles.\n\n2013 - Richie Havens, the folk singer who opened the legendary 1969 Woodstock rock festival, died of a heart attack at 72.\n\nBirthdays:\n\nBettie Page was born today in 1923.\n\nLaurel Aitken, the “godfather of ska,” was born today in 1927.\n\nGlen Campbell was born today in 1936.\n\nJack Nitzsche — collaborator with Phil Spector, the Rolling Stones, Neil Young, Buffy Sainte-Marie (“Up Where We Belong”), and more — was born today in 1937.\n\nR&B singer Mel Carter (biggest hit was “Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me”) is 85.\n\nJohn Waters is 78.\n\nPeter Frampton is 74.\n\nPete Carr, best-known as part of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, was born today in 1950.\n\nKenny Lyon of the Lemonheads is 68.\n\nShavo Odadjian of System of a Down is 50.\n\nDaniel Paul Johns of Silverchair is 45.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly is 34."
