Eric Carr, by the time that the album was released, had been deceased for 6 months. He appears on track 05, an alternate mix to the song appearing on Bill and Ted, and on Track 12 which was his instrumental jam with Ace, called \"Heaven\" which was recorded in 1981 and became \"Breakout\" on Ace's debut solo album. KISS butchered that demo for the 1991 release removing Ace and replacing him with Bruce and cutting out most of the song except for the drum solo.\n\nThere were rumors that the album would be called \"Destroyer II.\" Paul addressed those rumors, \"When I said that we were gonna go a step after 'Destroyer' I didn't mean that we were going to deliver 'Son Of Destroyer!' I was talking about the amount of care and time we put into it... The commitment to the material and the standards we set for ourselves. That was what we were going for. We weren't out to recreate 'Destroyer.' This album has little in common with it\" (Kerrang #392). * Initially released on the \"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey\" OST and as a single in 1991. The track was remixed for inclusion on the \"Revenge\" album.\n\nPerformance credits:\n\nUnholy - Gene Simmons on \"guitar scratches\" intro\n\nDomino - Gene Simmons on rhythm guitar\n\nEvery Time I Look At You - Bruce Kulick on bass; Paul Stanley on acoustic guitar; Dick Wagner on guitar solo\n\nCarr Jam 1981 - Eric Carr on rhythm guitar\n\nTake It Off - Kevin Valentine on drums\n\nTough Love - Bruce Kulick on bass\n\nGod Gave Rock And Roll To You II - Eric Carr on harmonies\n\nSeveral songs - Johnny Z on harmonica\n\nSeveral songs - Tommy Thayer, Jesse Damon, Jamie St. James, on backing vocals\n\nChart Action:\n\nChart Peak (USA): #21 (1/21/89) with 27 weeks on charts. Other countries: CAN #53; SWE #30; SWZ #29.\n\nRIAA/Sales:\n\n\"Revenge\" was certified gold by the RIAA on 7/20/92. It has sold over 602,000 (3/12) copies during the SoundScan(r) era. By 2003 Universal Music International reported international sales of over 325,000 of the album as part of non-US catalog sales of over 3 million during the 1992-2003 period (Billboard, 8/9/03).\n\nPerformed Live:\n\nHalf of this album has been performed live. While never part of the electric set, \"Every Time I Look At You\" was a center-piece of the unplugged era, and culminating \"MTV\" performance. \"Unholy,\" \"Take It Off,\" and \"God Gave Rock 'N' Roll To You II\" debuted during the spring club tour and were first performed live on April 23, 1992. \"Domino\" and \"I Just Wanna\" were added to the set for the autumn arena tour and were first performed live on September 30, 1992. Additionally, \"Spit\" was regularly performed during the 1995 Konvention tour.\n\nKISS Album Focus:\n\nBy the early 1990s KISS were starting an inevitable move backwards to their past. The efforts they had made following musical and visual trends in the 1980s had not rebuilt the fan base to the levels they expected. More recent material was being replaced with material from the band's classic era in the band's set. Following the conclusion of the \"Hot In The Shade,\" the band took some time off to regroup and rest before embarking on their next studio effort. That tour had been their most successful in the United States since the classic era. Gene, in particular, had to decide where his goals and interests lay, particularly whether he was going to continue treating KISS as a part-time endeavor. Gene made the decision and put many of his outside projects on hold as he returned to the band with full commitment. With both remaining original members fully committed to KISS' cause, there could only be benefits.\n\n\"Revenge\" was supposed to have been about the band regaining the glory that they'd lost in the 1980s. It ended up being more of a \"Creatures Of The Night\" for the 1990s; it was another strong musical statement that proved the band still had relevance and the hunger to keep going. Producer extraordinaire Bob Ezrin was lined up to provide a similar role to that on KISS' greatest studio album, \"Destroyer.\" Eric Carr best summed up Ezrin's inclusion, recalling: \"Part of the reason I think we want Ezrin to be there is to try and recapture some of that magic of the 'Destroyer' album. He's not just a producer and a great engineer, but he's a musician and a composer. Some of the musical stuff on 'Destroyer' was his creation; part of what he added to the album is what made it so special\" (Andy Martin, Jr.). Ezrin always left his mark on a band's material, be it by refining arrangements or the music, or by adding his special touches that further enhanced the material. In essence, the album reunited the band with their greatest producer, but also with one of their best song-writing partners in the form of Vinnie Vincent.\n\nPaul Stanley was clear that the band wanted to make no concessions to radio or their record label, and that the album would be a KISS album on which no compromises would be made at all. This was a further development to the ethos that had been behind \"Hot In The Shade,\" though both radio and the band's record label generally ignored KISS. Early on there were rumors that the album was going to be called \"Destroyer II.\" Paul quickly addressed the issue: \"When I said that we were gonna go a step after 'Destroyer' I didn't mean that we were going to deliver 'Son Of Destroyer!' I was talking about the amount of care and time we put into it... The commitment to the material and the standards we set for ourselves. That was what we were going for. We weren't out to recreate 'Destroyer.' This album has little in common with it\" (Kerrang #392).\n\nIssues surrounding the band during this period are most clearly associated with the decline in health and eventual death of Eric Carr, and his replacement by Eric Singer. Eric's suffered a seeming lethargy in the months following the end of the HITS tour, which developed into something far more serious. The week following Valentine's Day, 1991, Eric became very ill with flu-like symptoms. He recalled, \"I got real sick. High fevers, coughing, the whole bit. I thought I had the flu. The following Saturday I went and had a chest x-ray because I thought I might have pneumonia. The x-ray was fine as far as my lungs were concerned, but it showed my heart cavity was enlarged. I was sent to a cardiologist and he did an echocardiogram and found that there was fluid around my heart. As it turns out... it wasn't fluid, it was blood. Fluid can build up in this area, due to a virus or infection, so it was assumed that was what it was\" (Andy Martin, Jr.). Initially Eric's doctors treated him for the fluid around his heart with a regimen of medication for the condition, medically referred to as pericarditis.\n\nAfter three weeks of treatment Eric had improved slightly and was feeling much better. He went back to his Doctor for another EKG, to \"make sure that there wasn't anything that I was going to have to tell the rest of the band about before we started recording the album\" (Andy Martin, Jr.). However, his treatment had cleared up the fluid surrounding the heart and made imaging clearer. Now his Doctor was able to confirm something that he thought he'd initially seen: Eric had a heart tumor. Eric recalled, \"There was a tumor inside the right atrium of my heart. The part of it we were able to see at this point was about the size and shape of a person's pinky finger. It was flipping back and forth, in and out of the tricustis valve as it was opening and closing\" (Andy Martin, Jr.).\n\nFollowing the shocking discovery Eric underwent a battery of tests. It was quickly discovered that pieces of the tumor were breaking off and entering his lungs and surgery was urgently required. Eric recalled, \"When I went in to surgery I knew that there was more to it than just the pinky sized portion, that there was a larger mass that it was attached to. When I saw my surgeon again Sunday night, he told me that most of the atrium wall on that side was infected with this tumor including one of my coronary arteries, So all of that had to be cut away. They had to then resect with a piece of pericardium around the heart. So they got rid of everything and slapped me back together. I had the surgery Tuesday morning and I was out till Thursday on life support. By Thursday afternoon I was up walking around and Friday I felt great. I was just sore from the incision\" (Andy Martin, Jr.).\n\nIn some ways Eric took a proud view of his 11\" scar, at least mentally since he'd had a plastic surgeon close the incision to minimize any actual scaring, resulting from the surgery and the whole situation surrounding his life at the time. Eric had the procedure performed in New York, rather than Los Angeles as his band members had wanted. They were located on the West Coast and wanted to be supportive, but the issues were too complex for him to relocate. Eric remembered, \"To get back to Gene and Paul. They came out, I told them they didn't have to, but they wanted to. Originally they wanted me to come out to L.A. just so they could be near me all the time, just for the moral support. It's important in all operations, but especially heart surgery. I had already done so much work here in N.Y. finding a surgeon and getting everything rolling, that there was no way I was going to try and start all over out there... It just didn't make any sense to try and do it in L.A. I really had to get in the hospital, time was ticking fast, with the pieces breaking off into my lungs. So I had to get the fucking thing out of my body\" (Andy Martin, Jr.). By mid-April Eric was apparently on the mend recuperating from the severe surgery he'd undergone.\n\nOne of the last songs that Eric Carr would write seems to have been based heavily from his situation with his illness, \"Just like the elephant man / Nothing's changed inside / People don't seem the same / They smile with fear in their eyes\" (Eric Carr). The song would never be recorded or demoed, and it is far too easy to look at the song, taking Eric's health and personal issues, and look at the lyrics allegorically, especially \"Banished from the kingdom / By the evil king / And his not so secret queen,\" but that really serves no purpose and would be conjecture. It is clear that Eric was worried about his position within KISS; there had been problems with his relationship with Paul, particularly on the previous tour. And there had been a fear about being replaced when Eric Singer entered the picture.\n\nFollowing his surgery Eric was well enough to join the rest of the band in the studio recording \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II.\" This song was slightly reworked from the original Argent track by Gene, Paul, and Bob Ezrin. It was be the last song Eric Carr would be involved with as a member of KISS. Because of his condition Eric Singer was brought in to drum on the recording. Eric Carr provided the vocal harmonizing on the song, a somewhat ironic occurrence considering how long it had taken him to provide lead vocals on a recorded cut. But it was at least good that Eric was featured in the recording of the song no matter how frustrating it must have been for him not to be drumming. It is possible that the band felt that they could not take any risks allowing Eric to drum in the studio because of his recent surgery, and the fact that he was supposed to be recovering from it. Regardless of whether he wanted to drum, Eric knew he wasn't ready. He recalled, \"I would like to have played, and I feel good enough to play, but the bones in my chest are not healed. So I can't do it, no matter how I feel\" (Karen Lesniewski).\n\nGene liked the idea of covering the song, \"I'm just glad it's got guitars on it instead of violins, that's number one... Number two, it probably strikes a chord in everybody else that it struck in us. You know, finally a song with guitars that says something good\" (Kerrang #377). It is rather nostalgic that the song had been around as long as it had, and been covered by more suitable artists, and yet brought to a new height by a band whose name was alleged to have stood for all sorts of evil rubbish. The producers of \"Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey\" simply wanted a KISS song on the sound track, and a KISS song produced by Bob.\n\nAs the band had discovered with \"Destroyer\" and \"The Elder,\" when Bob was really working well, the result was success, and when he wasn't, well, fans saw what happened to the band in '81/2! The sessions for the track made it clear that he was the man for the new album project, with both parties satisfied and working well. Bob recalled, \"Jimmy Ivy came to the conclusion that he needed a song for his film's soundtrack, called 'God Gave Rock And Roll To You...\" It had to be performed by KISS and produced by me. And I was in the middle of doing a project, in fact I was on my way out of town. I was gonna finish up Julian Lennon, then I was gonna go on vacation, but this guy Ivy drove us all crazy with the idea. And finally we decided it was do-able in the time that they allowed and the budget they were providing us with, so we got into the studio, did it together, and had a wonderful time. We laughed during those five days at the studio, mostly at our performances, and then decided that we wanted to carry on and do an album\" (KISS Crazy #12, 12/91).\n\nNaturally, Gene insisted that the band retain rights to include the song on their own album. Gene commented, \"We liked the song and wanted to put it on our record because KISS fans would like the song – so why shouldn't they find it on a KISS album rather than another company's record\" (Kerrang #392). Some of the rewriting process would take a bit of effort to transform Argent's original into something usable by KISS. Gene recalled, \"The original lyrics went something like, 'don't climb any trees / And don't tease the creatures,' lines like that. I guess the hash was very strong in the days when this was written... It was the chorus that really said it all to us\" (Kerrang #377). That original verse would not have worked well within a KISS context: \"Love your friend and love your neighbor / Love your life and love your labor / No, it's never too late to change your mind / Don't step on snails, don't climb in trees / Love Cliff Richard but please don't tease / It's never too late to change your mind.\"\n\nBy late-May/early-June Eric discovered that the cancer had spread to his lungs and that further chemotherapy treatment was necessary. The resulting treatment would cause him to lose some of his hair. While Eric began his chemotherapy treatment, the band was preparing material for the album in Los Angeles. Eric's treatment took some six weeks and when it was completed he returned to Los Angeles. However, Eric Singer was recruited to handle the drums on the album. According to Singer, \"They had problems finding someone to play so when I came back on a break they asked me to help out on some songs. So I said 'yeah,' and I played on a few tracks and then they wanted me to play on the whole thing\" (KISS Crazy #14). The only real break in Alice Cooper's touring occurred between August 20 and September 1. While Eric Carr believed that he had recovered enough to participate in the album sessions the band continued working without him in hopes that he could rest and get 100% better. There was no public talk during the summer of Eric being replaced though there is little doubt that Eric feared for his position.\n\nHe simply had the history of the band to look at and Mark St. John's departure in 1984. Furthermore, his relationship with the band had been stressed during the previous couple of years, notable with the original exclusion of his drum solo during the \"Hot In The Shade\" tour. During the summer a video for \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II\" was filmed in Los Angeles, on July 27-28, 1991. Released as a single the song provided the band with their second major hit in recent years. The song shot to #4 on the UK charts and went top-10 in Germany and Switzerland. In Australia, the single reached #18 and was their highest chart position since \"Shandi.\"\n\nEric was well enough to participate in the strenuous filming of the video, though he required a wig and looked rather haggard. Later he \"Took great pride in telling people of how he had played on drums for twelve hours during the filming of the 'God Gave Rock And Roll To You II' video and did not have any problems. He felt strong, felt good about the chemotherapy and had been told that his lungs were healing incredibly fast\" (Dale Sherman – BD). In September 1991 Eric attended the MTV Music Video Awards. This was his final public appearance.\n\nOn September 14, 1991 Eric suffered a brain hemorrhage, the first of two. By October his situation had severely deteriorated. Gene recalled, \"Eric, as far as I know is still unconscious and has been for a very long time\" (KISS Crazy, 12/91). At that point Gene was asked about the prospect of Eric rejoining KISS, to which Gene solemnly responded, \"I don't think so. Our main priority is Eric's health, we are all praying for him\" (KISS Crazy, 12/91). In recent years there has been a great deal of debate about whether Eric would rejoin the band if he had fully recovered. Gene has somewhat added fuel to the fire commenting that he would without a doubt been able to rejoin the band. Revisionist history non-withstanding, it is pointless to delve into a \"what if\" discussion and this work has attempted not to.\n\nRegardless, following his initial hemorrhage Eric continued to battle and seemed to recover enough that he was moved to a rehabilitation hospital. Unfortunately, again the body defeated the will power and in early November Eric had the second of his brain hemorrhages. On Sunday, November 24, 1991 he died from cancer related complications at Bellevue Hospital in New York. The UK Phonogram press release stated, \"He is survived by his mother, father, and two sisters, he was single and lived in Manhattan\" (PR). Without doubt KISS fans were in shock at the events of the year and the remaining band members had little to say in public concerning Eric's death.\n\nPaul, who had been on holiday in Hawaii at the time of Eric's death touchingly said, \"I think everybody can understand, without going into detail that it was a tremendous shock, and incredible loss, and going into it further is not something that I really want to share. It kind of cheapens something that's mine\" (Kerrang #377). Eric was laid to rest at Cedar Hill Mausoleum in Middlehope, New York on November 30, following a funeral service at St. Joseph's Church in Middleton, NY, officiated by Father John Holigan. A second service of memorial was held on January 6, 1992 at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in Hollywood for fans on the West coast who had not had a chance to offer their prayers in Eric's memory. Bruce Kulick and his wife Christine attended as did Eric's former girlfriend Carrie Stevens.\n\nHowever, while the death of Eric Carr made press in many locations industry leader Rolling Stone magazine ignored Eric's passing and failed to even list an obituary for the drummer, much to the ire of the band and their fans. In a January 8 letter to the magazine, the remaining members of KISS commented, \"Omitting the death of a musician of Eric Carr's stature, regardless of you personal views and tastes, is inexcusable, especially considering the coverage it received on CNN, MTV, network television and virtually every daily and weekly publication\" (KISS PR, 1/8/92). Unfortunately, Rolling Stone published a severely edited version of the band's complaint in the \"Letters to the Editor\" section. This would hardly be too surprising considering how scathing the letter was: \"At a time that has seen Rolling Stone become everything it was started in opposition to\" (KISS PR, 1/8/92)... The band responded by issuing a full press release with the full text of their letter in early February rather than have Rolling Stone present it their way.\n\nRolling Stone had seldom been a friend of KISS and their comments, while biting, would probably have had little impact on the \"establishment\" which KISS supposedly didn't care about. However, it was a matter of respect and the reporting of a newsworthy item. Still the band had to move on and Eric Singer was quickly made a permanent member of the band. \"It's hard to talk about Eric Singer without saying what a wonderful and great guy Eric Carr was,\" lamented Paul, \"How much he did, how much he contributed, and what a loss and nightmare that is. But Eric Singer is magic. He came in at a very difficult time and brought something very special – a tremendous amount of energy and chemistry, and it's all over the album\" (KISS Bio, 4/92). It was a result of the contribution that Eric Singer had been making, helping out during Eric Carr's illness with the band's work, that no auditions would be held for the new drummer position. Eric Singer was simply and quietly invited to take the position in December 1991.\n\nIt is possible that Eric joined the band officially earlier than December announcement date and one radio show had a piece on him becoming a full member in November. Eric had been friends with Paul since the solo tour outing in 1989, so in some ways there was already a comfort factor with him, a factor that like with Bruce Kulick was important to the foundation members. Paul knew his skill, his work ethic, and commitment; and he had already worked his ass off on the new KISS album. If \"God Gave Rock 'N Roll To You\" was Eric's audition with KISS, then he'd already served his apprenticeship during the recording of the album. Most importantly, Paul described him as being a team player, something that had become one of the key prerequisites for becoming a new KISS member. Bruce Kulick found it important that Eric Singer had a sense of humor.\n\nEric Carr's death made \"Revenge\" more important as a statement that nothing that happened to the band could defeat them. The band came out of their mourning fighting back with the music, the only way they knew how. The writing of the album had brought back the traditional issues of sex and strength to the KISS writer's pen, and Paul and Gene were at least finally collaborating again. Paul recalled, \"Well, interestingly enough, although there's only one song I think that Gene and my name appears on, this was very much a collaborative album, not just between Gene and myself, we did it just very much as we did our best albums – which is, someone will come in with a song, and then we'll go into rehearsal if it passes the approval test of everybody liking it. And with everything on 'Revenge' it had to be unanimous that people liked the song or it got ditched. If everybody's names went on the songs for what they added it would look like a law firm!\" (BBC1).\n\nPR screamed about the efforts: \"Hard-rock warhorses are back with a vengeance on 24th effort, the band's first with new drummer Eric Singer, who replaces the late Eric Carr. Rockers such as 'Domino' and 'Spit'\" (which actually includes the lyrics 'the bigger the cushion/the better the pushin,'\" first immortalized on Spinal Tap's 'Big Bottom') dominate the set. Paul Stanley's 'Beth'-like power ballad 'Every Time I Look At You' may play at top 40, while 'Unholy' should be played religiously at album rock\" (Billboard, 5/20/92). With Vinnie's songwriting contribution the songs once again regained a power that had been lacking for several years. The band was back to crafting heavy metal with the assistance of Ezrin.\n\nDuring the 1991 pre-production rehearsals Vinnie Vincent had been brought in to work with the band on the songs and some ideas that they were developing. Eventually Vincent received credits on \"Unholy,\" \"Heart Of Chrome,\" and \"I Just Wanna,\" two of which became singles. It has been reported that this is only half the number of the songs he actually developed with the band. Unfortunately it was not long before the usual problems with Vinnie surfaced and his involvement ceased. According to Gene, \"Vinnie Vincent came up to me and apologized for causing the band so much grief while he was a member. He wanted to patch things up and wondered if I would consider writing some songs with him. 'Sure,' I said. I wanted to let bygones be bygones. I called Paul and told him that Vinnie had apparently changed. Paul wrote songs with him as well. But before the album was released, Vinnie was up to his old tricks again. He reneged on a signed deal we had made and decided that he wanted to renegotiate\" (KISS & Make-Up). Vinnie later alleged that his signature on that agreement had been forged.\n\nAccording to Paul, Vinnie was kicked out. He recalled, \"In no uncertain terms he was fired, booted out twice, and was told that the door only swung one way, and that was out. We were very much again driven and committed to making 'Revenge' the best KISS album in – I don't how many years. You know, we realized on our last tour with this enormous show we had, and with these 23 or so songs we were playing, how much we had accomplished as a band, and the legacy that we had and the history that we had. And if we couldn't match our finest moments then maybe we shouldn't be doing this anymore... With this album the total goal was to make a great album, and it didn't matter who wrote, how many songs, who had the most, who had the least, or who else was involved. So Vinnie Vincent was thrown out of the band, is certainly somebody who has had, and may continue to have a lot of problems in his dealing with people, and that won't change, but I don't see any reason to turn the knife. We've written some good songs together and it was an opportunity to possibly write some things that the album could benefit from. And then who wins is KISS and the fans. Ultimately, if the fans win then we did a great job. Our writing together was good and it made sense for us to give it a shot\" (BBC1).\n\nWith Vinnie having been forced to declare bankruptcy in 1990, with the collapse of his prospective deal with Enigma Records, the band members had seen the invitation to Vinnie in certain terms of magnanimity. They could help him out while utilizing his incredible song-writing skills that had earlier provided such a benefit on the resurgence of the band in the mid-1980s. Vinnie, of course, remembered the situation differently: \"Financially this was a bad deal for me and I resigned. I could no longer witness the misery that I saw surrounding me. Hearing Simmons complaining that he hated the way someone in his own band played and especially knowing what really contributed to Eric Carr's death, I had to remove myself from that situation once and for all\" (Vinnie). It was comments such as this that fueled the rumor-mill running concerning the band's interaction with Eric Carr during his hospital stay.\n\nWhat is clear is that ego both sides made for a volatile split just as much as it often combined to the benefit of creativity. Bruce recalled some of the attitude that made \"Revenge\" the perfect title for the album, \"My solo approach was sheer Neanderthal. We wanted the guitars to spin and moan. Sometimes I would lay down a lead, and if it didn't fit the style of the record we didn't use it. I did this great Beatle-ish solo on the song 'Take It Off.' It had a very sweat sound that I've been searching for all my life. But when Gene and Paul came in, we realized that no matter how beautiful the solo was, it wasn't tough enough for the record. So I ended up plugging in a Les Paul and ripping out a classic KISS solo\" (Guitar Player, 6/92). Gene also took this brutal approach using anything on the album that attained the right heavy sound, be it a 20-year-old custom Spector that he'd used during the recording of \"Calling Dr. Love\" or a \"piece-of-shit, red Yamaha bass that probably didn't cost more than $200\" (Guitar Player, 7/92).\n\nWhen the effort was completed, the band was exhausted. Presenting the finished product to PolyGram they half expected the record label to reject the album because of the lack of identifiable singles and the twist the material had taken. While some might have called it pandering to the music scene's changes, there was an obvious need for the band to direct their efforts at capturing a particular demographic. Bruce's fiery guitar also melted another release during the \"Revenge\" era when the instrumental \"Zeptune\" was released on the Guitar's Practicing Musician's \"Volume 2\" CD. Built on a riff he'd conceived for use in KISS, the solo track allowed Bruce to let rip with his full range of artillery, technique, and style.\n\n\"Unholy\" became the first Gene Simmons written single in nearly ten years and was, according to Gene, based on parts of Wicked Lester's \"Keep Me Waiting.\" One of the tracks co-written by Vinnie Vincent, Gene recalled, \"When Vinnie Vincent and I teamed up to take the song to the next level, he suggested a number of changes, including some great lyrical ideas, that did in fact make the song better\" (Box Set Liners). One of the main changes that the song would undergo from demo to album recording form would be in the chorus. The original demo had two choruses' the first of which went: \"I was created by man / Unholy / Unholy.\" The second was even more basic just repeating \"Unholy\" three times. The finished version was much more refined and \"illustrated.\"\n\nAs far as subject matter is concerned, the song is straight forward according to Gene: \"The premise of the song, at least in my opinion, is... look I can say to you, 'hey, go break a leg,' and somebody taking that literally will say, 'does he want me to break my leg'? No! So, sweetheart, that means 'good luck.' But the song is even more specific.... the song says, in essence, 'yes, there is evil in the world,' and I play the character; I'm Unholy. The truth is, we're all a little bit Unholy. But the premise of this little play is, you think I'm bad? Well, look at you guys; you send your children to war to serve bastards and whores. I haven't been here forever; you created me... Would there be a devil if human beings didn't exist? Whether or not there are guys who are red with horns and pointed tails.... I think we created all of that. We create that every day of our lives by the way we treat each other\" (Lesniewski, Karen – KISS Collectors Network 3/93). Jesse Damon sang backing vocals on the album recording.\n\n\"Unholy\" was in the first group of songs recorded for the album including: \"Domino,\" \"I Just Wanna,\" \"Paralyzed,\" and \"Do You Wanna Touch Me Now.\" In some ways \"Domino\" can be considered both a companion track to \"Christine Sixteen\" and \"Deuce.\" According to Gene, the \"song started out with a bass lick, much as 'Deuce' did. Once I had the meter down, I started writing rhyming words, but without a melody – so it was almost a rap. Then I talked the song through with the lick, and the melody just came naturally. The melody that came to me was the bass lick, so I just shadowed my melody with the lick on guitar\" (Guitar World, 8/92).\n\nGene has also admitted to trying to copy \"Deuce\" with this track, though the song borrows more than a little from the song \"Nasty Nasty\" which he had written with Tommy Thayer and Jamie St. James for the 1986 Black 'N Blue album of the same title which he had produced. \"Domino\" was a rewrite of that song recycling the core riff with his new vocal styling and lyrics. It would be the spoken part of the song that would be similar to \"Christine Sixteen.\" Originally demoed by Gene and members of Silent Rage (which included ex-White Tiger drummer Brian Fox), the song underwent some changes during the recording process. Bob Ezrin changed the key of the solo so that \"It feels like it's got more energy\" (Box Set Liners). It would not be the only song demoed by Gene using the services of Silent Rage.\n\nBoth \"Thou Shalt Not,\" which was co-written by Gene and Jesse Damon, and \"Paralyzed\" were recorded with \"Domino.\" Since Gene had known the band since 1989, and had by that time released one of their albums, he was building a successful song writing and recording partnership with the band. Jesse eventually sang backing-vocals on several tracks on the album, including: \"Thou Shalt Not,\" \"Unholy,\" \"Take It Off,\" \"Tough Love,\" \"Heart Of Chrome,\" and \"I Just Wanna.\" When Bruce Kulick performed \"Thou Shalt Not\" at KISS Expos in 1996 the backing tape he used was markedly different to the \"Revenge\" album version. Apart from lacking many of the vocals the song's second verse was different: \"Well, the son of a bitch must be crazy / He's tellin' me I'm gonna go down / I said, \"this ain't the Wheel Of Fortune, you ain't the son of God / And I sure as hell don't give a damn\" / And it sure looks like you want my soul to keep / I've got miles to go, before I sleep...\" No doubt there would have been legal problems referencing the popular American television show in the song.\n\nGene's involvement with Silent Rage wouldn't end with using them to help demo his material. Gene's ode to \"don't point your finger at me\" for the album would be \"Thou Shalt Not.\" According to Gene the song is essentially, \"'My Generation' meets 'go fuck yourself\" (Metal Hammer 5/92). While there was a touch of autobiography in the song it would not be totally so. Jesse Damon recalled, \"When it came time for writing the lyrics, the story line used was written with some real life experience about Gene, and some biblical theme to coincide with the rest of songs on 'Revenge.' The music was written first, from several writing sessions I had with Gene, over at his house\" (JG).\n\n\"Paralyzed\" dated back to the \"Hot in the Shade\" sessions for Gene and at the time had not reached a condition suitable for use and was only fully written by 1991. Jesse and Gene demoed other material at the time. One song, \"Everybody Knows\" would be co-written by the two and considered for use on a KISS album. Jesse recalled, \"This was the first song Gene and I wrote together, it was in the running as a song for a possible KISS album, but didn't make it. I liked it so much, years later I recorded it, and put it out on my solo CD! When we wrote the song, it came together very easy. I remember it taking only a couple sessions to write it, and knew this was a good experience for both Gene and I. I thought to myself this is the beginning of a great writing relationship!\" (JG).\n\nAnother song demoed was \"You're My Reason For Livin,'\" which was eventually released on Gene's \"Sex Money KISS\" audio CD \"Lunch Box\" (2003). This song was also recorded during the \"Revenge\" period with Jesse recalling, \"I absolutely thought it was a smash hit, not our demo, I mean the song itself, the chorus 'You're My Reason For Livin,' says it all\" (JG). Silent Rage would be used to demo other tracks including an early version of \"Rain Keeps Fallin,'\" \"Hold On,\" \"Rotten To The Core,\" \"Never Gonna Leave You,\" \"Love Is Blind,\" and \"City Burn.\" While these were Gene written tracks only \"Rotten To The Core,\" \"Never Gonna Leave You,\" and \"Rain Keeps Fallin'\" were geared towards KISS with the other songs simply being demos or prospective candidates for Silent Rage to use. It is interesting to note that after \"Rotten To The Core\" was revived for \"Hot In The Shade,\" with input from Bruce, the song was given yet another chance during the \"Revenge\" era. About the demoing of material Jesse commented, \"Silent Rage and I demoed a lot of songs for Gene. Some were specific song demo's for possible KISS songs, and others were merely idea's of Gene's that he wanted to here in full band form\" (JG).\n\n\"Take It Off\" was another of the somewhat ironic tracks in the KISS catalog; this song would be written with another of Alice Cooper's guitarists, Kane \"Rambo\" Roberts. Paul called Kane to get together for a song-writing session, and it was there that this song evolved. Like many songs this piece would be refined with input from Bob Ezrin. According to Paul, \"'Take It Off' was a song that was started fairly early on in the project. I don't know what the scene is over here right now in the UK, but in America there are these fabulous 'titty bars,' as they're called, and there's some of the most absolutely stunning women in these places. And music plays and they're dancing around without their clothes on. It's quite fun! In some of the places they would strip and dance to songs like 'Heaven's On Fire' or 'Highway to Hell' or 'Lick It Up,' and I just felt that if I could be a part of somebody taking off their clothes, then I'd be doing my job. 'Tough Love' started off as a riff that Bruce had, it was a really good riff and it was just a case of figuring out where it would go and you know, writing the rest of the song around it\" (BBC1).\n\n\"Tough Love\" started out with a Bruce Kulick riff and a Paul Stanley title, chorus, and theme and was, as described by Bob Ezrin, \"As nasty and hard as it sounds\" (Strike #26). According to Bruce, \"It started out with some sort of low riff thing that I had and then we all worked on it, and new stuff developed from it. Paul had the title idea, the chorus, the theme. I was happy that everybody liked and worked out. It's kind of ominous, but not deathlike or anything like that, tough I guess\" (KISS Crazy #12). Lyrically, the song started with the \"I'm gonna take you down\" lyric and developed from that point. Paul recalled, \"'Tough Love' is just basically a one on one kind of thing and saying to somebody we have a special kind of relationship that's not just the norm, but we do things that other people think are kind of taboo. We like to do the things that others fantasize, and for me love is more than just soft, you know, give me tough love, give me love with a little more edge to it. The great thing about 'Revenge' was that nothing was done until it was mixed, and almost up until mix time we were making sure everything was right, and sometimes we would be making changes or reducing vocals or changing lines of the song or adding or taking away. I saw Jimi Hendrix twice and so did Bruce, and if you can imagine the impact that he has today just from listening to tapes and CDs, to have seen him live was monumental, and of course, people remember him doing 'Star Spangled Banner.' So Bruce nicked a little piece of this, and interestingly enough, if anybody plays it on guitar you immediately think of Hendrix\" (BBC1).\n\n\"Heart Of Chrome\" was a bit more cerebral in context, according to Paul: \"It's an interesting song to me because, so much in the UK you have your tabloids that print some of the most amazing things, you know, about people and their relationships and what goes on behind closed doors. We have them in the States too, and it's always very interesting to realize that there really are no secrets if there's two people involved. Should you do something, you must realize that the other person has the power to expose it. There's nothing sacred that goes on in the bedroom if one person chooses to divulge it, that's basically what the song is about. It's about being betrayed and telling the other person I'm still gonna be able to get one up on you and show you\" (BBC1).\n\nApart from being notorious for the use a very Spinal Tap-ish lyric \"the bigger the cushion, the better the pushin,'\" \"Spit\" was Gene's humorous look at what could almost be described as sexual addiction. Gene took quite a few hits about the use of that lyric though has defended himself along the lines of, \"Nothing is sacred! I wasn't aware of it – even though I f**ked Nigel's girlfriend when they were away on tour\" (Kerrang #392). At least he could have a sense of humor about being busted! Bruce recalled that the song was an effort, \"There's the out-of-time guitar solo in 'Spit,' for instance. Lyrically that song went through a dozen rewrites\" (Kerrang #392). According to Gene the song does have a message, \"It doesn't say 'look how big my cock is,' it says 'I need a whole lot of women to keep me satisfied.' It's in keeping with rock and roll traditions that go back to 'Good Golly Miss Molly'\" (Hit Parader, 8/92).\n\n\"Spit\" was written by Gene, Paul, and Scott Van Zen. Scott had written songs with Ken Tamplin prior to his involvement in the KISS camp, many of which had been included on Ken's \"Axe To Grind\" (1990) album that featured Mark St. John on one track. Additionally, Scott had originally registered the writing of the whole song attributed only to him in 1991. This indicates that Gene and Paul may have made some changes, substantial or not, to an existing piece; this is hardly an uncommon action in the songwriting business. However, according to Gene, \"I had the basic song written, but Paul felt that it really didn't have a chorus. So just because my name is in the credits doesn't mean it's all my work\" (Kerrang #392). Most importantly, the song recycled some of the lyrics from Gene's demo with Aerosmith's Joe Perry, \"Mongoloid Man.\"\n\nThe song also introduced Bruce playing part of the \"Star Spangled Banner\" in his solo, a piece that became Bruce's performance piece during the tour. According to Bruce, \"There was a lyric in it that was something about setting me free, and that was right before the solo, that was the original lyric. So my idea when thinking about the solo, you know Hendrix being someone I've always loved and am really into, so I thought, 'Wow, how about playing the 'Star Spangled Banner' for as second,' and I was really hoping everybody would like the idea – and they did! So even though the lyric changed, so it wasn't set up like before, but I still think it's kinda cool\" (KISS Crazy #14).\n\nNo KISS album would have been complete without a Paul Stanley ballad. For Revenge, Paul teamed with Ezrin and the full orchestral effect for \"Every time I Look At You.\" The song was irreverently referred to as the \"Pussy Song\" during the sessions. It was a power ballad geared towards radio play in the same way \"Forever\" had been. Paul probably wouldn't like the term \"power ballad;\" that term has negative connotations for him: \"To me, a power ballad is an up-tempo song that's been slowed down to make it sound like a funeral dirge. We wanted something more down to earth\" (Kerrang #392). Yet, he felt that \"To talk about it as a ballad kind of does it a disservice because there's this whole genre of songs they call 'power ballads' that I think are like extremely wimpy, sappy, and most of them are nothing more than up tempo songs that have been slowed down to this funeral dirge tempo. Whereas somebody in the up tempo version is singing about jumping on some woman in the back seat of a car, now they're singing about 'missing' her. Unlike some other ballads or power ballads, or whatever you would call them, it maintains a certain integrity I think that the album has\" (BBC1).\n\nAccording to Paul, \"When Bob Ezrin and I wrote 'Every Time I Look At You,' we were thrilled by how it turned out. I remember he and I went to Maui for a week to finish the lyrics on all the 'Revenge' songs, and when we came back we had them all virtually finished. After putting the vocal and the strings on 'Every Time I Look At You' we all felt once again as with 'Forever' this was undeniable\" (Box Set Liners). However, it was deniable when the single was issued as a promotional radio single and video it was virtually ignored. The track included Bruce Kulick on bass while Dick Wagner was brought in to play the guitar solo. According to Dick, \"I happened to be in Los Angeles at the time they were recording and Paul suggested I play on a track.\"\n\nThe album would be completed with the inclusion of an Eric Carr drum track \"Carr Jam 1981,\" that had been \"gleaned and remastered from the KISS vaults, recorded originally in Toronto, Canada, in May of 1981\" (KISS UK Bio, 4/92). Originally recorded by Ace Frehley and Eric during the \"Elder\" sessions, the demo had been known as \"Heaven.\" The track was much more than just a solo when it started out life and was Eric Carr's \"Moby Dick.\" The drum solo that became the featured part of \"Carr Jam\" had originally been a solo break in the middle of the instrumental, of which several takes exist. The overall music from the demo had been used by Frehley's Comet and became \"Breakout,\" but the track included on \"Revenge\" had a lot of work done to it.\n\nInitially Gene tried to develop the instrumental into a song with lyrics and a melody line but, \"We never quite finished it. It never came out good enough\" (Kerrang #377), and quite simply it wasn't working. He eventually gave up and settled for having Ace's guitar parts removed and replaced by Bruce. \"It included a thunderous drum solo,\" says Gene, \"the only one Eric ever recorded [in the studio]. We left the original bass, drums, and Paul's guitar as they were and over-dubbed Bruce on lead guitar. We cut it down in length so that the drum solo became the featured part\" (KISS UK Bio, 4/92). According to Gene, \"We wanted to have Eric Carr play with us one last time\" (KISS Crazy #13).\n\nPaul added to the history of the song being included on \"Revenge\" commenting, \"Our producer, Bob Ezrin, was going through our old tapes right when we started work on this album... He came across the great drum solo that Eric had done right after he joined the band. We didn't even know it existed! When we heard it, we figured it had to be incorporated into the album in some way. We figured that song was a fitting way to end an album that's dedicated to Eric Carr's memory\" (Hit Parader, 8/92). This comment further indicates that neither Gene nor Paul had much to do with the original recording of \"Heaven,\" which is quite likely since Ace, Eric, and sometimes Bob were jamming material at the time without them. Like \"Escape From The Island,\" it is possible that the bassist on this demo was Ezrin. There is a further irony that Eric Carr had wanted the recording during his tenure in the band, but that it would only surface following his death.\n\nDuring the writing and recording of the album Paul Stanley co-wrote \"Do Ya Wanna Touch Me Now\" with Skid Row member Dave \"The Snake\" Sabo and Bob Ezrin. The song was ultimately omitted from the album at a late stage. Paul defended the exclusion of this song from the album, \"It's a great luxury to have an album that's so good that another song is only going to detract from it rather than make it any better. As good as the song is, we didn't need it\" (Kerrang #392). It was later suggested that the song was left off the album to make room for \"Carr Jam...\" The connection with Sabo had come via a call with Nikki Sixx where Sabo was on the other line and had wanted to get in touch with Paul. Paul let Nikki give Snake his number and the two did end up getting together. Initially they discussed Paul making a guest appearance on the Skid Row cover of \"C'mon And Love Me,\" which the band had recorded for a covers EP, but that did not work out; Paul suggested that he and Snake hook up the next time both were in Los Angeles.\n\nPaul recalled their initial meeting: \"After about half-an-hour of shootin' the shit, I said, 'let's grab some guitars.' We picked up the guitars and did it. There's a real good vibe and energy to him – and he's a great guy\" (Kerrang, #377). Paul expanded on this in another interview, \"They were coming to LA and I said why don't we get together. So they came and we sat down and talked for about an hour and were just fooling around, and I said okay let's grab some guitars. So we went upstairs and pretty much started knocking out a song as quickly as we plugged in the guitars\" (KISS Crazy #12). Gene recalled that, \"There was a very good song that Paul wrote with Snake of Skid Row, we recorded it, but it never made it on to the record. It was a very, very good song, but we had to decide in a very brutal way if it was great\" (Hit Parader 8/92). The song was refined in the studio with input from Bob Ezrin. He described the song as \"a genuine grinder\" (Strike #26).\n\nDuring the long period surrounding the creation of \"Revenge\" Paul also co-wrote with Warrant's lead singer Jani Lane. According to Paul they were both left with a half-completed recording: \"Jani and I started writing when they were working the 'Cherry Pie' album... we got together and started a song that was really good, so someday maybe\" (KISS Crazy #12). This collaboration, titled \"If You Could See Through My Eyes,\" occurred in late-1990/early-1991 and probably pre-dated the band's recording of \"God Gave Rock 'N Roll To You II.\"\n\nGene did some interesting co-writing during the early \"Revenge\" era. He'd team up with the legendary Bob Dylan and worked on a song that would have not been suitable for inclusion on a KISS record. The music was written at Gene's guesthouse, and while Gene would write a lyric for the song and demo it he considered it an unfinished work in progress. According to Gene, \"What came out was kind of a Tom Petty/Traveling Wilbury's song. I wanted him to write the lyrics, but he asked me to do it, so I did. The lyrics are okay, but they sure ain't Dylan\" (Guitar School, 7/92). While Gene had no intention of including such a song on a KISS record at the time, he was talking about offering it to someone like David Crosby.\n\nGene expanded on the history of the song: \"I wanted to write a song with Dylan. So, like most things I do, I bull headedly picked up the phone, tracked down his manager and said 'Hi, I'm that guy who sticks his tongue out and I wanna write a song with Dylan,' or words to that effect. The results could only be 'yes' and 'no.' Dylan said yes... He came over to my house a few years back and we sat down and started throwing ideas around. Bob came up with a melody/chordal pattern...I chimed in with a melody/chorus idea and voila, we had a song. Lyrics weren't written as yet... I demoed the track with Tommy Thayer. Bob came down to visit and listen. When the demo was done, I asked Bob to write the lyric. He said no, why don't I write it. I have tried to write a meaningful lyric, but it has eluded me... I've bumped into Bob a few times...in Tokyo, while he was on tour and every time I ask him to write the lyric and he always says, 'Mr. KISS, you write it'\" (GeneSimmons.com). This song, \"Laughing When I Want To Cry\" was eventually released as \"Waiting For The Morning Light\" on Gene's 2004 solo album.\n\nRather than heading out on an arena tour the band decided to introduce Eric Singer in the intimate confines of a small club tour. On March 16 a press release was issued with announcing the tour, stating \"prior to the LP's release, the band intend to play 10 specially selected club gigs in various cities around the US from the last week in April to the end of the first week in May. With dates to be announced shortly, this special 'preview' tour will serve as the appetizer to KISS' major national tour which the band plan to start in August of this year. This will follow up last year's completely sold out 127-date 'Hot In The Shade' journey, a tour which – despite recession woes – was extremely successful\" (KISS, 3/16/92). A press release later added specifics for the club tour: \"KISS are going back to their roots – the clubs – this spring to provide fans in ten lucky cities with a taste of the greatness that is to come this summer, when KISS hit the road to promote their upcoming new album, 'Revenge.' Kicking off April 23 in San Francisco, the club tour will also bring KISS to such cities as Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, and eventually their hometown of New York City... The club tour will give KISS the chance to once again showcase their unparalleled stage performance, and get fans hungry for the national KISS arena tour that will commence in August...\" (KISS, 3/25/92). The club tour would see much of the material from \"Hot In The Shade\" and \"Crazy Nights\" being ripped out of the set to make from for new songs and additional classics, such as \"Parasite,\" \"Shout It Out Loud,\" \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" \"100,000 Years,\" and \"Firehouse.\" Representatives from the new album were \"Unholy,\" \"Take It Off,\" and \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II.\"\n\nIn early April 1992 Los Angeles record station KQLZ-FM started playing an advance copy of \"I Just Wanna,\" nearly a full month before the debut single was released. And the first single wasn't even planned to be this song! Within days, \"PolyGram Records... issued a 'Cease & Desist' order against Los Angeles radio station Pirate Radio (KQLZ-FM) for playing a KISS song too early. The song in question, \"I Just Wanna,\" from KISS upcoming new LP Revenge somehow made its way onto Pirate's 'Heavy Rotation' play list late last week, despite the fact that the first single, 'Unholy,' is not expected to be shipped until the first week of May\" (KISS, 4/13/92). This song was apparently an early mix and not the final album version.\n\nIn February 1992 the band had announced their return to Europe, the UK at least, for the first time in four years. The tour was supposed to capitalize on the #4 chart position that the \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II\" single had reached the previous year. The band brought the \"Hot In The Shade\" stage to Britain: \"An exploding Sphinx, lasers, mayhem – who else could it be but KISS, bringing their spectacular 'Revenge' tour to Britain. The band last played the UK in 1988 but have recently had huge success with their single 'God Gave Rock And Roll To You'\" (Vertigo, 2/11/92).\n\nWhen the album was released it reached a high position of #6 on the US charts (6/6/92) during a residency of 23 weeks. This was the highest position any KISS album had managed to reach since \"Love Gun\" in 1977. This set the precedent that would affect all future KISS albums – high or reasonable chart debut positions with little chart durability. The album did well in most other markets reaching top-10 in Australia, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The band had to settle for #11 and #14 in Canada and Japan respectively.\n\nAfter arriving in the UK on May 12, the band commenced two days of rehearsals at Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition and Conference Center (SECC) on May 14. The band would play a full rehearsal show on the 14th, but the rehearsal on the following day was done without vocals. The band kicked off the 10 day UK tour at the SECC on May 16, 1992, and concluded with two nights at Birmingham's National Exhibition Center on the May 25 and 26. Danger Danger were the primary opening act for the small tour. Also staged to coincide with KISS' visit to the UK was a KISS Convention at the Astoria Theatre on May 21. This allowed fans to spend the day with merchandise and memorabilia dealers, tour keyboardist Gary Corbett, Lydia Criss, tribute band Dressed To Kill, and then attend that night's Wembley gig. This tour saw very little difference in the set list to that had been performed in the US clubs in April, though \"I Stole Your Love\" returned to the set opening position displacing \"Love Gun.\" Sound checks saw additional classic material, such as \"Do You Love Me,\" \"Nothin' To Lose,\" and \"She\" being tried out.\n\nFor the first time in years the band scheduled in-store signing appearances at music retailer HMV in Cardiff (5/20) and London (5/21). This was a special treat for the UK fans since the band hadn't made in-store appearances since the \"Creatures Of The Night\" era. Following the UK tour the band spent three days on a short promotional tour of Europe. On May 29 KISS filmed live segments for the Dutch TV show \"Countdown.\" They performed assisted versions (vocals live, backing vocals and music canned) of \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II\" and \"Unholy\" for an audience of 300. Two takes of each song were performed, though Paul forgot some lyrics during one take of \"God Gave Rock And Roll To You II.\" The broadcast of the show included an interview with the band. The following day the band did an in-store record signing at \"Fame\" in Amsterdam, before quickly departing for France. KISS made their final in-store appearance at Virgin Records in Paris on June 1. The rest of the promotional tour saw the band visit Munich, Koln, Berlin, and Hamburg (June 1-6), followed by three days in Italy. The promo tour wrapped up after brief visits to Stockholm and Oslo, and the band returned to the US on June 12.\n\nFollowing the release of the album the full US tour was announced: \"Those who were unfortunately absent at this past month's KISS exclusive 10-city club tour gigs have been granted a second chance to catch the super group on a grander scale... Starting July 31 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and hitting cities across the US including Las Vegas, Denver, Chicago, and Detroit, KISS will bring their fiery best to arenas, showcasing killer material from their newest album 'Revenge,' as well as many of their classics. Opening for KISS will be Faster Pussycat and Lynch Mob. The recent KISS club tour proved extremely successful for the band, giving the chosen few in the attending audience a scaled-down, appetizer portion of the musical brilliance that is to be expected on this mega 600-date arena tour\" (KISS PR 5/21/92). The first leg of this mega tour was slated to run through September 20 when it would conclude at Freedom Hall in Louisville, KY.\n\nHowever, the tour had to be postponed, and it is interesting to consider why these tentatively planned dates were ever announced, or whether the press release went out in error. Events in July made the start of the tour at the end of the month impossible. Gene's longtime partner, Shannon Tweed, gave birth to their daughter, Sophie, named after the famed actress Sophia Loren, on July 7. And Paul Stanley married Pamela Bowen on July 26. Thus, with such life-changing events occurring, which must have been known about well in advance, it is questionable why KISS would have ever kicked off a tour on July 31?\n\nThe proper \"Revenge\" arena tour finally got under way on October 1, 1992 in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The band had played a full set rehearsal show the night before. The set received something of a revamp with \"Creatures Of The Night\" returning to the opening spot. \"Hotter Than Hell\" and \"Watchin' You\" were also added from the classic era, while \"I Just Wanna\" and \"Domino\" were added from the album. Bruce's \"Star Spangled Banner\" was used to close the set. Both \"I Still Love You\" and \"Christine Sixteen\" were performed a few times but were not part of the regular set list. Bruce has suggested that the inclusion of the piece was simply a result of the stage design and that he had suggested to Gene that he'd like to play part of it during the show. Bruce commented, \"I just presented it to Gene and Paul. I said, hey wouldn't it be great if instead of me doing a regular guitar solo if I actually played the Star Spangled Banner as a little solo you know kind of Hendrix style. And then Paul suggested one up better instead of that, why don't we just end the show with it and blow up everything and do a whole production thing like that\" (LF #77, Kris Eisen).\n\n\"Revenge\" was supported by four videos, the most for any KISS album. The first, \"Unholy\" was filmed at Southern Bay Studios in Carson, California, and with \"Domino\" and \"I Just Wanna\" was directed by Paul Rackman. The video for \"I Just Wanna\" was filmed at Park Royal Studios in London on May 23, while the band was on tour in the UK. The last, \"Every time I Look At You,\" was directed by Mark Rezyka. One video or four, MTV was not interested in broadcasting any of them. \"Unholy\" probably would have caused mass protests at MTV from the Christian conservatives with children dancing on pentagrams and evil-looking twins casting demonic shadows. Viewed as \"has-beens,\" the emerging grunge movement was pushing older artists to the side, with the exception of those who pandered to the medium that had never worked very well for KISS.\n\n\"Revenge\" scrapped to Gold certification on July 20, 1992. Around this time the band released another in their long line of videos, \"KISS X-treme Close-up\" (PolyGram Video 085 395-3). It would attain the usual Gold certification on October 23, 1992. Certified Platinum in 1995 the video spent a grand-total of 102 weeks on the US video charts and became the band's first #1 video. Like \"KISS Exposed,\" the video included a mix of full videos and excerpts. The mix made the product something of a \"hodge-podge,\" the many video excerpts were little more than cruel teasers. Highlights on the video were \"Love 'Em And Leave 'Em\" and \"Hard Luck Woman\" from Don Krishner's Rock Concert in 1976, and the full videos for \"Unholy,\" \"Rise To It,\" \"Hide Your Heart,\" and \"Forever.\" Sadly, the product was a far cry from the previously planned \"KISS Exposed II\" (PolyGram Video 085 394-3) video package that had been scrapped.\n\nDue for release in August 1992, according to Gene, \"It is going to be like a history of KISS, and right now the plan is to have people like Nikki Sixx, James Hetfield, people like that in other bands, talking about how the band affected them\" (Gerhard Wimmer – KISS Army International). The band had originally planned to follow-up \"Exposed\" with a package that included material shot during the \"Hot In The Shade Tour.\" In addition to the usual \"previously unseen footage\" the video would include \"rare recordings of 'A World Without Heroes' sung by Lou Reed.\" Sample artwork from the package made it into circulation, with the cover being stylistically related to the \"Revenge\" album cover. \"Exposed II\" was re-titled \"X-treme Close-Up\" though the content was initially described in some promotional literature as being the same as previously mentioned on the sample art for \"Exposed II.\"\n\nSince a mega tour was expected from the album the band had invested in a suitably massive stage show. \"The tour set was originally to showcase a ruined cityscape with the Statue of Liberty in the background. Such plans were later scaled down to a few gridiron platforms and street posts, while the Stature of Liberty was featured prominently behind Eric Singer. At the two-third mark in the concert the statue would crumble away to show a grinning skull and a raised fist giving the 'finger' to the audience\" (Dale Sherman – BD). While the band certainly was not saying \"Fuck You\" to the audience the message was not always clear. What was worse was that the album was going nowhere and the ticket sales problems were again affecting the tour. Even with the strippers on stage many markets were weak and eventually the band would kill the tour before it destroyed their finances further.\n\nRegardless, on November 27th the first of three shows was taped by Eddie Kramer for Alive III. \"I Was Made For Lovin' You,\" a song the band had performed in the clubs earlier that year, was recorded during sound checks. Other shows recorded for album included those at The Palace, Detroit, MI (27); Cleveland, OH (28); and Indianapolis, IN, on the 29th. The \"Revenge\" tour came to a conclusion on December 20 in Phoenix, AZ. Within a month KISS announced their next project to fans...\n\nOn December 16th WCWP, 88.1 FM, broadcast the Eric Carr Memorial Tribute. This features the re-broadcast of a 1989 interview done with Eric Carr by DJ Tony Mal at the radio station. Notably, it includes the first ever broadcast of the Cellarmen single recorded by Eric around 1966 with him singing lead vocals on two of the band's original songs. The tribute includes a wide selection of other songs that Eric had been involved with including material from the WOW album, Bryan Adam's \"Don't Leave Me Lonely,\" and numerous KISS tracks. This tribute would be the best tribute to Eric during the year after his death. Fittingly, the \"Revenge\" album stands dedicated to the memory of Eric Carr."
