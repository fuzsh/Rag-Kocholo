        "text": "She's had LOADS of hits\n\nSince releasing her debut single 'Be the One' back in 2015, Dua Lipa has gone from strength to strength. In 2018, she released the massive hit 'One Kiss' with Calvin Harris, picking up a BRIT Award and paving the way for yet more glorious collaborations. In 2023, Dua starred in the Barbie film as Mermaid Barbie, contributing to the soundtrack with 'Dance The Night'!\n\nNow, after winning Best Pop award at the 2024 BRIT Awards, Dua has delighted fans by releasing her third album 'Radical Optimism' as well announcing a show at Wembley in 2025. Here we take a look at some of Dua's biggest songs and their meanings.\n\nHere we look at Dua Lipa's songs and some of the meanings behind her lyrics...\n\n'Break My Heart'\n\nThe song features a sample from classic 80s tune 'Need You Tonight' by INXS, and is all about how Dua is wondering whether she'll ever experience a relationship that doesn't end in heartbreak.\n\nShe said of the song, \"This samples INXS's 'Need You Tonight,' and it's a perfect explanation of 'dance crying.' It's about finally being in a happy place and knowing this new person is amazing. But then thinking: 'Nothing else compares to this, and what if this ends and it breaks my heart?'\n\n\"It's the whole thing of being scared to be too happy, like when your day is going really well and you think, 'What's the one thing that's going to f--- it up?' I'm a hopeless romantic and always ask myself: 'How am I going to protect this?'\n\n\"But it's also a sweet and vulnerable place to be, because you also see how much you care. It helped that the people I wrote this with know my boyfriend, which helped me be really open.\" It peaked at Number 6 in the UK.\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Break My Heart' (Official Video)\n\n'Physical'\n\n'Physical' appears on Dua's second album, 'Future Nostalgia', the theme of which was bringing the sounds of the 80s into 2020 - so it makes sense that this song has 80s vibes! Dua later acknowledged that the song is a nod to 'Physical' by Olivia Newton-John, and added that it was a \"spur-of-the-moment kind of song, which at times had a Eurythmics vibe to it\". It peaked at Number 3 in the UK.\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Physical' (Official Video)\n\n'Don't Start Now'\n\nDua released 'Don't Start Now' - the first song from her second album, 'Future Nostalgia' - in November 2019, and it hit Number 2 in the UK charts. Dua co-wrote the song with Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and Ian Kirkpatrick.\n\nDua described writing the song as closing \"one chapter of my life and starting another\" with a \"new sound\" - and the lyrics reflect that. The song is all about moving on from a past heartbreak, and asking the former lover to stay away and not scupper the singer from moving on.\n\nThe lyrics to the chorus are: 'Don't show up, don't come out / Don't start caring about me now / Walk away, you know how / Don't start caring about me now.'\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Don't Start Now' (Official Music Video)\n\n'Electricity'\n\nDua teamed up with Silk City (Mark Ronson and Diplo) for 'Electricity', released in September 2018. The song peaked at Number 4 in the UK, winning Best Dance Recording at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\n\nThe song documents an 'electric' relationship, where two people feel as though they've found a kindred spirit. It also shows one person taking care of the other, who's maybe been through a past traumatic relationship. The lyrics to the chorus are, 'You give me a feeling, feeling so strong / I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong / So let me care for you / Ooh, baby I'ma love you differently / I'll give you electricity.'\n\nWATCH: Silk City, Dua Lipa - 'Electricity' (Official Video)\n\n'One Kiss'\n\nDua Lipa teamed up with Calvin Harris on 'One Kiss' in April 2018 and their song became incredibly popular staying at the top of the UK chart for eight consecutive weeks - making it the longest-running Number 1 by a lead female artist that decade! The official music video stars Calvin looking very dapper in a suit as he serves Dua a cocktail.\n\nThe song was written by both Dua and Calvin, along with another songwriter, Jessie Reyez. As the name and the chorus of the song suggests, it is about how someone can fall in love after just one kiss. The lyrics from the chorus are: 'One kiss is all it takes / Fallin' in love with me / Possibilities / I look like all you need.'\n\nJust a few weeks after the song's release 'One Kiss' became the biggest Number 1 song of 2018. Taking to Twitter to reveal the exciting news, Calvin said, 'One Kiss @DUALIPA is the biggest song in the world rn number 1 global iTunes, Apple Music & Spotify thank you so much !!!!!!' (sic)\n\nCalvin also released some behind-the-scenes footage from the music video, with Calvin explaining how the collaboration came about. He says, \"I first met Dua maybe two years ago, I think she had just put out 'Be The One'. Two years later I had this 'kinda' half finished song, and I thought it would be perfect for her.\" And he wasn't wrong!\n\nWATCH: Calvin Harris, Dua Lipa - 'One Kiss' (Official Video)\n\n'IDGAF'\n\nIDGAF - an abbreviation of 'I Don't Give a F--k' - was Dua's seventh single from her debut album and reached Number 3 in the UK when it was released in January 2018.\n\nSpeaking about the inspiration for the song, Dua said, \"Bits of it are very true. It's about this person that, a long time after you've broken up, comes back to say 'hi' and you think to yourself, 'What gives him the right to call me now and see how I'm doing? Does he not realise the damage he's done?'\"\n\nWARNING: THIS VIDEO CONTAINS STRONG LANGUAGE\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'IDGAF' (Official Music Video)\n\n'New Rules'\n\n'New Rules' was Dua Lipa's big breakthrough song - it was her first UK Number 1 and her fifth Top 40 hit. The tropical house tune became an anthem of female empowerment for newly-single women. The lyrics to 'New Rules' are the singer's strategy to get over someone.\n\nThe chorus lyrics are, 'One, don't pick up the phone / You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone / Two, don't let him in / You'll have to kick him out again / Three, don't be his friend / You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning / And if you're under him / You ain't getting over him.'\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'New Rules' (Official Music Video)\n\n'Lost in Your Light'\n\nDua's next single was also a collaboration, this time with singer Miguel. Released in April 2017, the song unfortunately did not break into the Top 40 in the UK - but this could be because it was put out as a freebie to those who pre-ordered her album.\n\nThe song is all about an intense connection between two romantic partners, specifically focusing on one perfect night. The chorus lyrics are, 'Lost in your light, baby / I wanna stay right here all night, baby.'\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Lost In Your Light' feat. Miguel (Official Video)\n\n'Scared To Be Lonely'\n\nDua collaborated with DJ Martin Garrix on this song, released in January 2017 and peaking at Number 14 in the UK. The tone of the song is pretty much summed up in the title, and was considered by Garrix to be a follow-up to his previous song 'In the Name of Love' with Bebe Rexha, giving the same \"euphoric feeling\" but has \"deeper lyrics\", something he said was important.\n\nThe chorus lyrics are, 'Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds? / Is the only reason you're holding me tonight / 'Cause we're scared to be lonely? / Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright? / Is the only reason you're holding me tonight / 'Cause we're scared to be lonely?'\n\nWATCH: Martin Garrix & Dua Lipa - 'Scared To Be Lonely' (Official Video)\n\n'Blow Your Mind (Mwah)'\n\n'Blow Your Mind (Mwah)' showed a more sassy side to Dua when she released this song in August 2016, later appearing on her debut album in 2017 and peaking at 30 in the UK. The song lyrics are about a passionate relationship in which the two people are possibly not totally right for each other, but they're too attracted to each other to stay away.\n\nThe lyrics to the chorus are, 'If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind? / If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine / We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind / If we don't this whole thing up / Guaranteed, I can blow your mind / Mwah!'\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Blow Your Mind (Mwah)' (Official Video)\n\n'Hotter Than Hell'\n\nDua wrote the song after a nasty break-up, telling Digital Spy, \"I was in a relationship that really f-----d me over. In the song, I twisted it so that I was in the better position and I was the one going 'f--- you'. That really helped me get over it. It was very therapeutic for me.\" It peaked at Number 15 in the UK and appeared on Dua's self-titled debut album.\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'Hotter Than Hell' (Official Video)\n\n'Be The One'\n\n'Be the One' was Dua Lipa's lead single from her self-titled debut album 'Dua Lipa' back in October 2017. It reached Number 9 in the UK and was certified Platinum, selling 600,000 copies.\n\nIn an interview with Nylon magazine, Dua revealed that the song is about \"believing in oneself, having perseverance and fighting for the things that you want in life\". In the lyrics, she sings about fighting for a romantic relationship in which the other person has their guard up, and she wants to break down their walls.\n\nThe lyrics to the chorus are, 'Oh, baby come on, let me get to know you / Just another chance so that I can show / That I won't let you down, oh no / 'Cause I could be the one.'\n\nDua Lipa - 'Be The One' (Official Music Video)\n\n'Prisoner'\n\n202\\0 saw the ultimate collaboration between Dua Lipa and Miley Cyrus, with the release of 'Prisoner'. The track was a single off of Miley's feisty album 'Plastic Hearts', and flew to the Top 10 in the UK Charts.\n\nThe song is thought to be about feeling emotionally trapped in past and/or present relationships, with the lyrics saying: 'Prisoner, prisoner / Locked up / Can't get you off my mind, off my mind / Lord knows I tried a million times, million times'.\n\nSpeaking to Apple Music, Miley explained how the lyrics felt particularly relevant in the recent pandemic, saying, \"I think it's also coming at a perfect time for everybody, I mean, we're just trapped in our emotions right now. I mean, really me, there's no escaping it. It's like, 'Locked up, can't get you off my mind.' Anything that you've tried to suppress or compartmentalise at that point, it's coming up. It's yours to own, to own it or release it.\"\n\nWhat was Dua Lipa's first song?\n\nDua Lipa's first single release was 'New Love', all the way back in 2015, and later appeared on the deluxe version of her self-titled debut album. Co-written by Dua and the album's producers, Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt, about how she was struggling to find her place in the music industry that \"often seems to neither want nor need you\".\n\nThe lyrics of the song reflect this, and the bridge lyrics are, 'I don't wanna waste no time all alone / Want somewhere to go, something to call my own / And I ain't satisfied / Where to go? / Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore.'\n\nWATCH: Dua Lipa - 'New Love' (Official Music Video)\n\n'We're Good'\n\nOn 11 February 2021, Lipa released a single titled 'We're Good' to go alongside the reissue of the second album. The song is about an amicable break-up we desired (but never got).\n\nIn an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music, Dua said: “It’s having that amicable breakup that I think everybody kind of wants. It’s like that clean break isn’t lacking, move on. We’re good. You can’t be upset if I move on. I can’t be upset if you move on. You know what I mean?\n\n\"And I think a lot of the time, it’s that part of a breakup that—it gets lost in translation. Yeah. When things are ego-driven, that’s immediately when it’s over, but yeah, just the amicable breakup.”\n\n'Cold Heart (Pnau remix)'\n\nIn August, Dua collaborated with her hero Elton John again on his lead single from his album 'The Lockdown Sessions'. 'Cold Heart' is a a mashup of the Rocket Man’s hit songs, remixed by Sydney trio Pnau and Dua sings on the track.\n\nThe song jumped to the top of the charts and reached the number one spot in October, bring the end to Ed Sheeran's reign.\n\nIt is first time Sir Elton has had a number one single since he appeared on rapper 2Pac’s posthumous 2005 single Ghetto Gospel.\n\n'Dance The Night'\n\nDua released a song called 'Dance The Night' on Friday 26th May. The song was announced on Monday 22nd May with a teaser video and confirmation features on the Barbie film, which Dua also stars in.\n\nWhen is Dua Lipa releasing new music?\n\nAfter releasing 'Houdini' on 9th November 2023, Dua dropped another new single called 'Illusion' on 12th April 2024.\n\nSharing a clip of the amazing music video to her Instagram page, Dua told fans: 'ILLUSION OUT NOW !!!!!
