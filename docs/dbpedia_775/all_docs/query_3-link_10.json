        "text": "Who wrote 'Kiss from a Rose'?\n\nThe song was written in 1987, several years before the release of Seal's eponymous debut album in 1991.\n\nHowever, it wasn't released until 1994.\n\nSeal actually hated the song... and still kinda does\n\nAfter writing the song, Seal felt \"embarrassed by it\" and \"threw the tape in the corner.\"\n\nSeal didn't show it to producer Trevor Horn until the recording sessions for Seal II.\n\nSeal performs incredible version of 'Kiss from a Rose' on The Kelly Clarkson Show\n\nSeal's 10 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nIn 2015, Seal said: \"To be honest, I was never really that proud of it, though I like what Trevor did with the recording.\n\n\"He turned that tape from my corner into another 8 million record sales and my name became a household name.\"\n\n'Kiss from a Rose' meaning: What is the song about?\n\nA rather mysterious song - many fans have pondered whether it is about drug use, while others say it is an expression of love or even a journey to the afterlife.\n\nSeal has never fully explained what the song is actually about, only saying that there was \"some kind of relationship that inspired the lyrics.\"\n\nSeal has previously said that his songs often mean more than one subject, so giving one meaning would be too simplistic.\n\nWatch Seal’s powerful tribute to Freddie Mercury from 1992 with ‘Who Wants To Live Forever’\n\nSeal's rendition of Nat King Cole's ‘Smile’ will send shivers down your spine\n\nInstead of printed lyrics, Seal wrote a speech about the subject that went with the album:\n\n\"I think it's the general vibe of what I'm saying that is important and not the exact literal translation. The song is always larger in the listener's mind because with it they attach imagery which is relative to their own personal experience. So it is your perception of what I'm saying rather than what I actually way that is the key.\"\n\nIt was used in the Batman Forever soundtrack\n\nSeal - Kiss From A Rose (Official Music Video 720p HD) + Lyrics\n\nOriginally released in 1994, the song was later the second single taken from the Batman Forever film soundtrack, and topped the US chart for one week in August 1995.\n\nIt also went to number four on the UK chart, where it had originally reached number 20 the year before.\n\nDirector Joel Schumacher called Seal, and requested the use of the song to play over a love scene between Nicole Kidman and Val Kilmer's Batman.\n\nWhile the song was eventually not used in this scene, it was instead used for the end credits.\n\nWho has covered it?\n\nJack Black Kiss From A Rose\n\nSeveral artists, including:\n\n- Hank Marvin\n\n- Irish vocal trio Triniti\n\n- Katherine Jenkins\n\n- Jack Black on American Idol (see above)\n\n- Idina Menzel\n\n- Lee DeWyze\n\nWhen has it been used in TV and film?\n\nCommunity - Kiss From A Rose\n\nThe song has had its fair share of pop culture tributes, including:\n\n-In season 2, episode 7 of Shameless, the song is revealed as Jody's go-to love-making song.\n\n- In season 5, episode 7 of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Dee plans to greet a returning US soldier she's been chatting with online by playing the song.\n\n- In season 3, episode 7 of Community, Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and Craig Pelton (Jim Rash) sing the track together.\n\n- In season 5, episode 17 of Bones, the song is featured in Temperance's reunion where she and Booth slow dance to the song. As the song startsBrennan requests Booth to dance with her, saying \"Can we dance, Booth? It's Seal!\"\n\nBad Education - Mac Attack! - BBC Three\n\n- In the 2015 film Vacation, the song is a favourite of Rusty Griswold (played by Ed Helms).\n\n- In season 1, episode 6 of American Crime Story, the song plays when Marcia Clark (Sarah Paulson) is getting her hair done at a salon, and again as she walks into the courtroom with her new look.\n\n- In Bad Education, pupil Stephen (Layton Williams) uses the song to conjure the energy to dance-kick a bully in slow motion."
