        "text": "“It got to the point where I wrote down his remarks over a period of three or four days in what I called my ‘wizard book.’ It was merely a small notebook I carried to jot down silly sayings and sketch in to save ideas. Look at the lyrics. View them as a hen-pecked hubby’s remarks to his nagging wife. You’ll see what I mean. Just pause after every sentence and pretend there’s a bitch at the other end of the line. You’ll catch it – I’m sure. Absolutely not responsible at all. Another poor man’s copyright by me in ’70.”\n\nFrom “Beck” to “Beth”\n\nPenridge and Criss recorded a demo of “Beck” but the song was never released. In 1976, after Criss joined Kiss, he and Penridge brought the song back around for revision. Producer, Bob Ezrin, lent his talents as well. The title was changed to “Beth” and the song was made more sentimental. The end of the first verse was changed from “I know you love complaining, but Beck what can I do?” Instead, the lyrics became “I think I hear them callin’, Oh, Beth what can I do?”\n\nPeter Criss sang lead on “Beth,” (he also sang lead on “Black Diamond” and “Hard Luck Woman”). Criss was the only member of Kiss to perform on this song. Dick Wagner played the acoustic guitar and an orchestra was brought in. When they performed it live, Peter would come to the front of the stage to sing. A recorded backing track was used when an orchestra was not available.\n\nAlthough Kiss has a HUGE following, they never had a number-one hit and they only cracked the top 10 twice. “Beth” is the biggest single of their career. The B-Side to the release was “Detroit Rock City.”\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kHkojuUSDO8\n\nAlthough Peter Criss is the co-writer/singer of “Beth,” Paul Stanley feels it was Stan Penridge who did the bulk of the work on “Beth.” Stanley told Rolling Stone in 2014, “Peter had nothing to do with it. It was a lifeline that Peter hung on to validate himself, but it wasn’t based on reality.” (Ouch)\n\nThe issues between Criss and Stanley run deep. When Kiss was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014, Stanley and Gene Simmons refused to reunite with the original lineup. Kiss did not perform at the induction ceremony."
