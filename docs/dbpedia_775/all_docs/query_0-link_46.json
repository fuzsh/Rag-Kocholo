Mixed by Dave Wittman at Cherokee Studio, Los Angeles, CA; August 1989.

Other countries: CAN #46; SWE #29; SWZ #23.\n\nRIAA/Sales:\n\n\"Hot in the Shade\" was certified gold by the RIAA on 12/20/89. It has sold over 116,000 (3/12) copies since the SoundScan(r) era commenced in 1991. The album was certified gold and platinum by the CRIA (Canada) for sales of 100,000 copies on 1/30/90.\n\nPerformed Live:\n\nThe 33% performed percentage seems low, though with 15 songs that still meant that five songs were performed off the album: \"Forever\" was the first, debuting in March 1990. \"Rise To It,\" \"Betrayed,\" and \"Hide Your Heart\" followed on April 14. Finally, \"Little Caesar\" had its single performance on April 25, though it was still being rehearsed prior to the start of the \"Hot in the Shade\" tour. \"Betrayed\" only survived two shows before being permanently dropped. \"Hide Your Heart\" had also been performed live by Paul Stanley during his 1989 solo tour and was resurrected for his 2006/7 tours. It was also the sole representative of the Kulick era on the first two-weeks of the \"End of the Road\" tour in 2019...\n\nKISS Album Focus:\n\nWhen Paul Stanley came off his 1989 solo tour he was ready to get back to the real business at hand: KISS. He'd enjoyed his solo sojourn and it had reignited his desire for music. Gene Simmons, on the other hand, remained preoccupied with a plethora of projects as he lived his mogul lifestyle. These included, but were not limited to his fledgling record label, but also artist management. However, the tide was starting to turn and he was getting more involved in the band again. Whether he was responding to pressure from Paul, or simply covering all possibilities, is not totally clear. For the first time in years he would provide the majority of material for the new album, co-writing 9 of the 15 tracks that eventually appeared on the album. Given the working title \"Crimes of Passion,\" the album was not solely guided by Paul Stanley's vision. About the working titles for the album, Eric Carr commented: \"There's a list a mile long. 'Crimes of Passion' was one of them. 'Crimes of Punishment' was one of them. They were cool titles but they didn't seem to be right\" (Valentino, Thomas).\n\nWhat was clear was that Paul's vision for the musical direction of the band had run its course throughout the 1980s and had not totally validated itself. It had kept the band ticking over, but little more and had never manifested itself as a major return to popularity -- and sales. It was also clear that KISS was stronger when both Gene and Paul were involved. According to Gene, \"We instinctively turned to something else. The first thing we decided to do was not work with Ron Nevison again, and although we didn't know who we were going to turn to, we started writing and doing demos in the studio\" (KISStory). According to Paul, \"Gene and I talked early on. We wanted to go as far as we wanted, in any direction we wanted. We didn't want to tailor anything. We decided to play what we want, write what we want, and be as honest as possible, keeping it as basic as possible. We would go for attitude 100 per cent. Not to make a 'Heavy Metal' album, but to make a KISS album... A rock 'n' roll album. Any step along the way, there would be no compromise. Not to make it slicker or heavier. Not to play that game in any direction\" (Kerrang #251).\n\nAccording to Eric Carr, KISS started recording \"Hot In The Shade\" at the Fortress Studios in Los Angeles around June 15, 1989. The Fortress was a facility that Gene often used to demo material both for KISS and other projects. Brought back into the fold for the first time in nearly a decade was KISS' former producer, Vini Poncia. Initially it was not planned for the album to be produced by either or both Gene and Paul. Early on there were thoughts of using Vini, whom the band had last worked with on 1980s \"Unmasked.\" Not only was Vini an excellent producer, outside of KISS, but during the \"Dynasty\" and \"Unmasked\" sessions he had contributed in the songwriting department and helped the band refine their material. And it was perhaps that third-person or Devil's Advocate perspective that had been missing.\n\nMuch as Ron Nevison was multi-skilled both as producer and more importantly as an engineer. Vini had not been tremendously active as a producer throughout the 1980s. While Vini didn't end up producing the album, he was heavily involved in the creative process, co-writing five songs that were included on the album. Indecision about the direction the band would take left an unclear path for the album. The lack of financial rewards from the \"Crazy Nights\" plan also meant that the album needed to be done on the cheap; again it was a matter of cutting out a cost for a service that could be rendered by Paul and Gene. 1986-7 had been an expensive period for the band, not just the result of monies not flowing in from album sales, but other financial issues affecting them as a business. In many ways the album probably should not be considered to have been produced by them as a team. Instead, they really produced their own material separately. Gene recalled, \"We eventually brought in Vini Poncia again, but we used him more as a co-writer and didn't let him take control because we knew that we didn't want another 'Dynasty.' We were hoping to try and recapture some of the spontaneity that KISS had originally because, when the first few records were done, we just went in and did them basically without thinking\" (KISStory). Why Gene wouldn't want another \"Dynasty\" with multi-platinum sales, a gold single and generally strong material is curious since there was only one song on that album where the band had moved away from their \"normal\" style.\n\nFor Gene it was more important that the band was at least trying to create a quality product even if the song-writing was lacking. While the album is comprised of predominately 24-track demos which were worked on for release it was been suggested that the songs sounded good enough for release in that format rather than going in and re-recording the material. That ultimately sounds more like an excuse or weak justification. It is possible that with the financial situation resulted in the decision being made to save money, rather than spend more on studio time to re-record all of the material. It really didn't seem to matter what sort of material KISS released. Slick and glossy production hadn't helped the sales of \"Crazy Nights.\" Fast and furious recording of albums such as \"Asylum\" hadn't pushed the band over their 1 million unit \"speed bump.\" Perhaps it was simply time to try a rough sounding album, similar to the steps the band had take with \"Rock And Roll Over,\" as reaction against the high level of production on its predecessor.\n\nThere was more to the matter of recording the album than that. Paul recalled, \"We're in so deep that we can only go forward... We're in the seedy part of Hollywood at a place called Fortress Studio. It's not even a listed studio. It's where Gene and Bruce did their demos. I did mine here as well, and we haven't left\" (Kerrang #251). Eric Carr was clear about the style of the new record: \"The music is great, a lot more basic and rock 'n' roll compared to the last two records... It's more like an older Kiss album. The songs are very well written, with a lot of attitude, power and raunch. Everything really, really kicks. Each song is strong on its own, but they all hold together as an album\" (Kerrang #251). Paul saw the album as a step in the right direction, yet it was one of the most disjointed efforts, even by the band member's own admissions. After two albums of creative exclusion, Eric Carr brought four songs to the band for the album, including: \"Ain't That Peculiar,\" \"Looking Through The Eyes Of Love,\" and \"Somebody's Waiting.\" Eric described \"Looking...\" as an AC/DC meets the Beatles hybrid: \"I had the title and melodies and stuff, and Gene and I worked on it for a while. We restructured the verse, and Adam Mitchell and I worked on the lyrics. I came up with the majority of them, but there was just something missing. We demoed it up, and had a whole thing done up on it, but it just didn't sound right. I still think it's a great song, it just wasn't right for this album\" (Dark Light, Spring '90).\n\n\"Somebody's Waiting\" was Eric's monster ballad, though perhaps it was too monstrous since it would have competed with Paul's ballad, \"Forever.\" Choosing between the two would always be a no-win situation for Eric. Eric recalled, \"It was a great ballad, Gene loved it right away, and Paul really thought it was very very good. 'Forever' was such a killer ballad, out of the two, that was obviously the better one\" (Dark Light, Spring '90). It would be what Eric thought was the weakest song that was accepted for the album. However, the song finally gave Eric his lead vocal on a KISS record, after nine long years of trying to be heard. The music for \"Ain't That Peculiar\" eventually became \"Little Caesar.\" The song started out as a piece of music written solely by Eric Carr which he based on the Marvin Gaye recording \"Ain't That Peculiar.\" With Eric's R&B musical background and the sort of material his 1970s bands had covered, he certainly would have been very familiar with this genre of music, and this song. When he and Bruce Kulick originally demoed that song, they applied a metal musical interpretation to the piece. As the song developed it was re-titled \"No One Messin' With You\" as it evolved from the original cover version. Lyrically, Eric received assistance from Gene and Adam Mitchell to complete that transformation.\n\nEric said of the song, in an interview with Thomas Valentino, \"'Little Caesar,' I'm very happy about. 'Little Caesar' started out as a rhythm track that I brought to Gene. I brought four things actually. Three of them were semi-complete. One of them was a really great ballad. But Paul came up with a really cool ballad that fits us better. I just let Gene hear 'Little Caesar' basically as an extra thing; I never thought he would consider it. But he loved it and we started working on it. Bruce and I went into the studio to cut the tracks. All the instruments are Bruce and me. I play drums, I play bass and Bruce plays all the guitars. Its like funk rock. It's kind of Zepplin-ish. I'm real happy with how my vocals turned out. I think this one of the better things on the album\" (Valentino, Thomas). Gene and Paul would also be on the song according to Eric, \"It's me and Gene through the whole song. Like in the chorus and stuff. In the middle where I do the rap in there. And then it's me and Paul at the very end\" (KISS Neon Glow #1, 1992). According to Eric: \"It's basically about me because I'm this little guy that fought his way, and doesn't listen to anybody else, and does what he wants to do. It's basically saying that anybody can do that. It was kind of a nick name I got from Gene\" (Dark Light, Spring '90).\n\nThere are rumors that Eric Singer drum tracks from demos with Paul (\"Read My Body\") and that Kevin Valentine (\"King Of Hearts\" & \"You Love Me To Hate You\") may also have been involved on drums, and even a drum machine, but these have not been substantiated. The same could be said of Tommy Thayer who was writing with Gene Simmons around this time. Tommy ended up with two co-writing credits on the album: \"Betrayed\" and \"The Street Giveth, And The Street Taketh Away.\" Originally titled \"Another Betrayed,\" the circulating demo of \"Betrayed\" has a strong acoustic feel. It would become more standard rock 'n' roll in presentation on the album. The song was not the same as a song with the same title, written by Vinnie Vincent and Paul Stanley, which had been recorded by the band during the \"Creatures Of The Night\" album sessions. About the new song Gene recalled, \"'Betrayed' was written this year – started with the chorus riff, but it wasn't until I had the title that the lyrics came. Tommy Thayer helped on this one. About a guy who thinks life has betrayed him... My point of view is: 'Hey you ain't crucified, so what's so bad'\" (FKLL Liners). Eric's drum style on the song was inspired by Metallica. According to Eric, \"I was thinking of something that Lars (Ulrich) might do\" (Dark Light, Spring '90). \"The Street Giveth...\" was apparently one of the easier songs to write for the album. It had started out with a Tommy Thayer verse lick. Gene would provide the bridge, chorus riffs and lyrics. According to Gene, the \"lyrics came later, and only after I had the title.... then the song practically wrote itself\" (FKLL Liners).\n\nAround the same time the Gene and Tommy (and Pat Regan) were collaborating on German banshee Doro Pesch's solo album. Like \"Hot In The Shade,\" it was being recorded at the Fortress using previously recorded Black 'N Blue, KISS, and other material. Bruce's music was also branching out by 1989. Around this time he wrote \"All Night Long\" with Adam Mitchell which he knew was a bit too pop for KISS, but \"Gene loved that song so he wanted Silent Rage to do it\" (KISS Crazy #8). Silent Rage guitarist and vocalist Jesse Damon recalled the song ending up on his band's album: \"That was a Gene suggestion, and a good one! I liked the song when I heard it, and I also liked the fact that this would add some more KISS affiliation to our CD! Adam Mitchell was a proven writer with KISS already, and Bruce was in KISS. But the main thing was the song fit us, and we had our input as well\" (JG). Naturally, Bruce preferred his demo of the song.\n\nBruce recalled that the \"Hot In The Shade\" was \"the next bridge of trying to get the band back to its roots. I think it's a little uneven record with its fifteen songs. Gene was doing a lot of demos, and this was at a time they didn't have a producer. It was up to each of them to pick the songs. It was a bit of a difficult period, although the tour went well. We also had a big hit with a very good song that Michael Bolton wrote with Paul called 'Forever.' So even when something goes off the wrong way there's something that gets it back on the right track. That's something I've noticed throughout the years with KISS. Sometimes something doesn't work, but out of that the next thing does. Like 'Asylum' wasn't as popular as 'Animalize,' yet there is some great stuff on 'Asylum' like 'Tears Are Falling.' The 'Asylum' tour in America didn't do as well, but the album still has some important things on it\" (Scream #46).\n\nThe interesting marriage of Paul Stanley working with a character as diametrically opposed to KISS as Michael Bolton had become came about from Bruce's history with him. Bruce had continued to do session work with Michael throughout the 1980s, though the combination of Paul and Michael would be quite accidental. The two would meet while Paul was living at the Sunset Marquis Hotel, and they talked about writing a song together – so they went to Paul's room and did just that. Bruce recalled, \"I introduced Michael to Paul. Of course, Michael knew who Paul Stanley was but he had never met him. At the time, Michael was just starting to break as a solo artist and as a songwriter and Paul liked to experiment in writing with different people, so that's how that happened. They got together in L.A. and wrote the song. I don't think they're buddies now or anything but it was a great co-write that became a hit for us. Michael once said that he'd love to write a big power ballad for KISS so there you go\" (Metal-Rules).\n\nWhile the Stanley/Bolton collaboration would create the music, Paul would finish the song by writing the lyrics. For the recording of the song Bruce played bass. According to Bruce, \"Gene [Simmons] is a little heavy-handed and I cut the demo with Paul, and the demo became the record, really\" (Lotring, Roger w/ Bruce Kulick, Starlog Official KISS Magazine #2, 1999). Phil Ashley was recruited to play keyboards on \"Forever\" and \"Hide Your Heart,\" the latter of which had been tried out on the 1987 \"Crazy Nights\" recording sessions and performed during Paul's solo tour. Paul was adamant that the song was going to end up on a KISS album, having told many crowds during his solo tour that the song hadn't been on any album \"YET\" (with emphasis!) as part of the song's introduction.\n\nDuring the writing sessions for the \"Crazy Nights\" album Paul had worked with two female writers who were having major successes on the airwaves. While only the collaboration with Diane Warren (\"Turn On The Night\") would be used on the album, \"Hide Your Heart,\" co-written with Holly Knight and Desmond Child was demoed and rejected by the band. One problem was that Paul regularly shopped demos around to publishers in hopes of getting songs picked up by other artists. This would result in song-writer royalties for him, and in early 1989, he had circulated a publishing tape that included demos of \"Hide Your Heart,\" \"Time Traveler,\" \"Best Man For You,\" \"Don't Let Go,\" and \"When Two Hearts Collide.\" Unfortunately, numerous artists picked up on the song, all around the same time, and mostly in a similar genre of performance. The song became the title-track for Bonnie Tyler's 1988 album, which was also released in some markets as \"Notes From America\" (Columbia 44163). The connection is not too surprising since she was writing with Desmond Child for the album at the time. Amusingly, co-writer Holly Knight played keyboards on the album, and Ace Frehley band member John Regan was doing session work on bass... The song would also be recorded by Robin Beck and Molly Hatchet. Southern rockers Molly Hatchet recorded the song on their \"Lightning Strikes Twice\" album. This would be their final album with Capital records and their last record with anything that could be construed an original lineup. Robin Beck, too, was working with Desmond Child on her \"Trouble or Nothing\" album, so it is hardly surprising for the song to have turned up there when it was released in 1988. Paul Stanley also appeared on her album, though not on that song, singing backing vocals on one track, \"Save Up All Your Tears.\" And then, or course, Ace Frehley recorded a version. The connection between Ace and the song is obvious: John Regan. In essence, by 1989, the song was over-used and over-exposed.\n\nAccording to Gene, \"'Prisoner of Love' was originally recorded with a straight rock feel... It wasn't until later that it turned into a shuffle. Bruce Kulick came to me with changes he liked, I added the middle guitar figure (2nd Bridge, Guitar Solo), and then sat down to write the lyric. This one didn't come easy. Lyric was actually re-written a couple of times and at one point the song was called 'Here Comes That Feelin' Again' (No, not the Fortune's song)\" (FKLL Liners). According to Bruce, \"We originally did a different version, like a more mid-tempo version and I really loved the way that one was – we didn't actually totally finish it. It was done between my house and then we took it into the studio for a little bit and then we just totally switched direction because Gene desperately wanted to make it a shuffle... You wouldn't think it was the same song although it had the same chorus\" (KISS Crazy #8). This song was one of the first to feature Silent Rage's Jesse Damon on backing vocals on a KISS record.\n\nWith Gene set to launch his vanity record label, one of his first signings had been Silent Rage, who included guitarist and vocalist Jesse Damon. Jesse was soon working with Gene on various demos. According to Jesse, \"Gene called, and asked me if I'd come down to the studio where he was recording, and said 'I need you to sing back-ups on a song with me, how about it.' I said when, and where... It was at Fortress Studios in Hollywood, the song was 'Prisoner Of Love,'\" (JG). Bruce and Gene also collaborated on \"Boomerang\" a left-over from the \"Crazy Nights\" album that had not been finished at the time. This song would be one of Gene's favorite songs on the album at the time, \"Not because I think it's the best song, but because it was the most fun to play... It was done live in the studio\" (The KISS Asylum Fanzine '89).\n\nGene discussed Vini's role in the sessions: \"Vini Poncia and I were sitting around tossing song ideas around he said something like 'you know Gene, something tells me love is like a slap in the face sometimes.' I immediately jumped up and wanted to write a song based on that idea... This one took us a while to write (a week)... we kept going back to the lyric... wanted to make it bitter sweet, the good and the bad... and the ugly\" (FKLL Liners). Vinnie also helped Gene come up with catchy material with subject matter close to his heart. With \"Cadillac Dreams\" it is far too easy to read too much of Gene's personal philosophy into a song with lyrics such, \"Give me money, money, more than I need, these Cadillac dreams are waitin' on me.\" Gene and Vini also wrote \"Somewhere Between Heaven And Hell.\"\n\nOne Gene song would get scrapped from the album at a late stage: \"Rotten To The Core.\" In some ways the title of \"Rotten To The Core\" refused to die. Gene Simmons certainly liked it, and while the 1976 version he had recorded was never used he and Bruce would attempt to make the song work again in 1989. Bruce felt that the song \"Wouldn't work unless it was a band that I don't know maybe had that kind of attitude, to use the title\" (KISS Crazy #11). The song was dropped from consideration for the album some months before \"Hot In The Shade\" was released, but was mentioned early on as a candidate for use on the album.\n\nPaul's material saw him continuing to branch out with new co-writers. \"Rise To It\" was written with Bob Halligan, Jr. Bob's writing/co-writing credits stretched back to \"(Take These) Chains\" being recorded by Judas Priest on their landmark \"Screaming For Vengeance\" album. By the late-1980s he was writing with the likes of Michael Bolton. Like Ken Tamplin, with whom KISS later wrote, Bob's personal religious side might seem at odds with some of his co-writing partners: \"There was certainly some stuff with questionable social merit. But people didn't really listen to the lyrics. They heard 'Some Heads Are Gonna Roll' and thought about violence. It was really a warning about future holocausts. It was funny. I would do Christian gigs and we really had to soft pedal around the Judas Priest mentions. I would get into some awkward circumstances. People would tell me what a scumbag I was and stuff like that. But that's all over. I'm not someone who believes the intellect is something that should be feared and avoided\" (PressOfAtlanticCity). Bob and Paul also collaborated on \"Read My Body,\" which saw Paul experimenting with a rap-like vocal delivery, more so than he had on \"All Hell's Breakin' Loose,\" and less successfully than other bands such as Def Leppard's effort, \"Pour Some Sugar On Me.\"\n\nPaul also worked with Vini Poncia with \"Silver Spoon\" almost a companion piece to \"Cadillac Dreams.\" This song became one of Paul's favorites. He recalled, \"I like what it says. We should be proud of who we are, and not ever feel a need to apologize for where we come from\" (KISS Crazy #5). Backing vocalists on the recording included Charlotte Crossley, Valerie Pinkston, and Kim Edwards-Brown. \"King Of Hearts\" is one of the songs rumored to have included Kevin Valentine on drums. Nothing concerning this matter has yet been substantiated. The same is the case with \"You Love Me To Hate You,\" Paul's final collaboration with Desmond Child. This song has always suffered comparisons with Joan Jett's \"I Hate Myself For Lovin' You\" which was released around the same time. Desmond Child had co-written both songs, and the similarities are obvious. A final Poncia/Stanley collaboration was the unused \"Run To Me.\" Apart from being a track written for \"Hot In The Shade,\" it is ironic that this song shares the same title with a song that Casablanca Records President Neil Bogart had recorded in the early 1960s under his then recording name \"Neil Scott.\" However, there the connection ends. According to Bruce the song was simply a throw-away track since it may have been written too late for use on the album.\n\nIn August 1989, somewhat buoyed by the recent improved success of albums such as \"Crazy Nights,\" and the consistent run of albums over the previous 6 years, KISS had re-signed with PolyGram Records with a ten year 7 record contract. While the terms of the contract aren't specifically known, it was reported to include a live album, a compilation, solo albums from Gene and Paul, and just three studio albums. What this meant was that the band was taking a big risk with the first album recorded under their new deal. The success of \"Smashes\" had certainly helped, since according to Gene, it sold \"like hotcakes all over the world\" (Kerrang #251). Another Eric Carr contribution was that he came up with the cover concept after seeing a similar picture in a magazine. Eric recalled, \"Paul came up with the title. The graphics on it came from me looking through a magazine and seeing a picture that was similar to an idea that we talked about\" (Valentino, Thomas). In September the \"Hide Your Heart\" video was shot in Los Angeles on top of the Hotel Royale. It was directed by Marty Callner. Later that month Bruce married his girlfriend Christina in Hawaii. Having met in New York, Christina was a model and aspiring actress.\n\nThe first single, \"Hide Your Heart,\" was released in late October but stalled at #66 on the charts during a short 10 week run. While the argument could be made about the over-exposure of the song \"Betrayed\" as the B-side probably didn't help either. Even the release of this single pressed on red vinyl in the UK does nothing to help it, though the single would chart highest there reaching #59. Two versions of the video were issued, one omitting the gun scene on the roof of the building where Johnny and Tito's showdown occurs. The other had a gang PSA tacked on to the beginning. \"Hot In The Shade\" was released on October 17, 1989. For both the band and the fans the 25 months between studio records was the longest gap, to that point, in KISS' history (the gap between \"Love Gun\" and \"Dynasty\" was 23 months; that between \"Asylum\" and \"Crazy Nights\" was 24 months 2 days). The album eventually reached #29 on the charts, but was unable to maintain the impetus of the previous albums. While the album stayed on the album charts for 36 weeks, only five of these weeks saw the album in the top-40. The remaining weeks on the charts were essentially dismal or inconsequential. On the international charts the album would only manage top-40 performance in Australia (36), Norway (8), Sweden (29), Switzerland (23), and the UK (35).\n\nWith the performance of album and first single being so poor the decision was made to hold off on heading out on tour. Since the album had dropped out of the top-40, in the United States, by early December it was probably a mistake to delay touring. Eric Carr, on the other hand, was ready for live concert action: \"I can't wait to get out. It's been much too long, I don't like being home. I'd rather play. This tour is going to be really big. We're gonna have the biggest show we can have. It's gonna be different not like the old KISS shows. We're gonna go out there and kick some ass\" (Valentino, Thomas). Little did he know that he'd be waiting over six months, from the release of the album, to hit the road. Instead, the band started filming the \"Rise To It\" video.\n\nThat video saw Gene and Paul donning make-up for the first time in nearly 8 years causing all sorts of new \"reunion\" rumors. Even Ace felt that Gene and Paul were \"testing the water\" (KISS Crazy #6) to see what the reaction would be. Initially planned to be the album's second single, the video was filmed on November 21 and 22, 1989 at SIR Studios in Hollywood. Directed by Mark Rezyka the final version of the video was completed by December 18. However, by then it had already been decided to issue \"Forever\" as the second single. Two versions of this video exist. The first has the acoustic slide introduction of the song played while the performance piece of the video is artistically shot in black and white. The second version omits the introduction and has the band's \"live\" performance in color.\n\nOn December 12, 1989, \"Hot In The Shade\" was certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies. Some sources have since suggested that the album attained Platinum status sometime later, but this has not yet been substantiated for the United States and recertification of the band's catalog seems unlikely. Hoping to jump start album sales with the use of the album's ballad, one sure way at the time to get airplay, on the weekend of December 15/16 the band filmed the \"Forever\" video. With Mark Rezyka returning as director, the video was completed by January 3. By the end of the month the single is released, backed with \"The Street Giveth And The Street Taketh Away.\"\n\nThe following month the single hit #8 providing the band with their biggest chart single success in the US since \"Beth\" in 1976. The single managed to stay on the charts for 17 weeks also putting it second place in terms of longevity to \"Beth.\" While the single reached #18 in Canada and #38 in Australia it failed to make much of an impression in any other major market. The single would, for a while, stop the slide of the album down the charts. In early-February the album started climbing the charts, from the #90 position it had sunk to, eventually reaching #57, before starting its inevitable plummet.\n\n\"Forever\" was remixed by Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero for release as a single. Perhaps it was felt that the album's production values just didn't do the song justice. The remix simply enhanced the acoustic clarity of the recording and lowered the levels of the drums in the mix. This was most evident by the near removal of the metronome-like cymbals throughout the album version of the track. It was ironic that providing the band with a hit single didn't really help the album sell much better.\n\nIn early 1990, in an attempt to get some play of other songs, from the album, the promotional album \"First KISS, Last Licks\" was released. It featured two of the band's original 1973 demos and new remixes of two tracks from the non-US \"Killers\" album. These tracks were also remixed by Thompson and Barbiero. The issue was allegedly restricted to 800 copies making it one of the most collectible non-makeup releases. However, there is some doubt about the number produced since the album is so readily available. In some ways the packaging would be superior to that often used on albums with \"handwritten\" track notes by the members describing the songs included on the album.\n\nIn late May, the final single from the album, \"Rise To It\" was released, as a \"Full Power Guitar Edit,\" backed with \"Silver Spoon.\" This was the second single only available in cassingle format in the US (\"Rock Hard\" had been the first). Being described as a \"Full Power Guitar Mix\" is somewhat misleading since the single version of the song is barely different from the album version. Essentially, the fade out at the end of the song is sharper than on the album version thus shortens the song by nearly 10 seconds. Overall, the levels on the recording are boosted resulting in the guitar, drums, bass, and vocals being crisper. The single bombs and during six weeks on the charts only manages to \"rise to\" position #81. The single fails to chart in any other market, and has no affect on the album dropping down, and out of, the charts, though it did coincide with touring activities finally commencing.\n\nWith the delay between the release of the album and going out on tour, the band members kept busy with other work. Paul continued working with other artists, and wrote \"The Game Of Love\" with Bob Held. This song was demoed in early 1990 by Eric, Bruce, and Paul. While it wasn't used at the time it was eventually recycled by Bob in 1995 for his \"Garbo Talks\" album project. It is likely that the song was demoed prior to its copyright being registered April 5, 1990. At the same time \"Don't Let Go,\" a Stanley and Poncia composition was registered. Another song, \"Love Makes You Crazy,\" was registered in May 1990, written by Paul, Jean Beauvoir, and Vini Poncia. It is not clear if this song was geared at KISS or Jean's Voodoo X project, though it was eventually recorded by Australian Craig McLachlan on his 1992 \"Hands Free\" album which included a thanks to Paul: \"A Big thanks to Paul Stanley for taking the time and trading licks with someone who still proudly plays his KISS records real loud.\" Craig and Paul eventually wrote material together in Los Angeles, but none of it ended up being used by either of them.\n\nWith all of the delays of other projects, negotiating and timings, KISS finally started gearing up to tour in April 1990. On April 14, the band played a benefit show at the Stone Pony in Ashbury, NJ. Eric performed \"Little Caesar\" for the first and last time. Ten days later, at a concert for contest winners at Reseda Country Club in California, the band performed another warm-up show. \"Betrayed\" was tried out though it didn't work out very well. Finally, the \"Hot In The Shade\" tour kicked off in Lubbock, Texas, on May 4, 1990. True to Paul's word about reinvigorating the set, classics such as \"I Stole Your Love,\" \"Deuce,\" \"Strutter,\" \"Calling Dr. Love,\" and \"God Of Thunder\" are incorporated along with new songs such as \"Rise To It,\" \"Hide Your Heart,\" and \"Forever.\" \"Rock And Roll All Nite\" returned to its classic position as set finale and even \"C'mon And Love Me\" and \"I Was Made For Lovin' You\" were performed a few times during the tour. The KISS logo, that had provided the stage background for so many years, was replaced with a giant Sphinx head, affectionately named \"Leon.\"\n\nThe opening acts were initially Slaughter, who included former-Vinnie Vincent Invasion members Mark Slaughter and Dana Strum, and Los Angeles \"hair\" band Faster Pussycat. The tour started out, for the first 40, or so, dates without an Eric Carr drum solo spot. This was the first time since 1980 that there would be no drum solo during a full tour show. While the number of songs included in the set list can be an argument for why the solo was cut, it proved an interesting rumor point that some have suggested as an indication that there were problems within the band. It was reported that prior to the tour beginning that Eric Carr was unhappy with his situation, and there were issues affecting his relationship within the band. Regardless, the solo was later added back into the set and Eric further developed his incredible piece which had nearly grown into a one man drum/electronica orchestra. The tour of some 127 dates becomes KISS' most successful domestic tour in over a decade.\n\nAs the tour motored throughout the US, on the night of July 3 Paul Stanley was involved in a major road accident following a show in Springfield, Massachusetts. According to Paul: \"I had a limo drive me down to New York so I could spend July 4th in New York. We were on some highway just outside the city, and the car spun out of control. We knocked out a bunch of highway lights and kept spinning and ultimately went head first into a granite wall. When the car finally stopped, I thought we were dead. But I ended up underneath the dashboard, and when the police showed up, they couldn't believe that anybody survived. Anyway, I took a couple of days off, and then continued the tour\" (KISStory). While he escaped without serious injury several more shows needed to be cancelled while he recuperated.\n\nThe tour restarted in Portland, Maine on the July 6, but within a few weeks Paul was injured on stage after running into a metal piece of staging. Several more shows were cancelled as a result of this incident. Paul recalled, \"About a month or so later I hit a guard rail on stage and broke a few ribs. But I never let it get in the way of the band giving 100% on stage every night\" (KISStory). On November 9, 1990, the \"Hot In The Shade\" Tour concluded at Madison Square Garden in New York City. This would be Eric Carr's final concert with the band, and it was very appropriate that it took place in his home city. Paul recalled the tour, \"We did 127 shows in America, averaging 5 shows a week, for about two hours each night. I think the whole band's attitude at that point was, 'it doesn't get any better than this.' It was a grueling tour, but it was also the most invigorating of any that we had done since the seventies\" (KISStory). The show, set, and band's attitude was an improvement over recent tours.\n\nThe \"Hot In The Shade\" tour also had another effect on the band: In returning classics to the set list they proved that old and newer material could happily co-exist. But it also marked the beginning of a change in thinking about the way a KISS live show would be constructed in future. The balance of material started to shift from favoring the eighties to the seventies. In some ways the \"Hot In The Shade\" era pointed the band's inevitable future path as returning to the past. The reception given to the classic songs proved that the material was still strongly desired and appreciated by the fans -- that had been made clear on Paul's solo outing. The reception to Gene and Paul putting on the makeup had also been interesting, almost as if they were teasing the fans to see what the reaction would be. There may also have been a small amount of initiating some of the newer fans to the history of the band. Some of those who picked up on the band in the late 1980s may not have known that the band had such a long history. Reunion rumors abounded at this time, but Gene and Paul knew that the time was perhaps not ripe to cash in those chips quite yet.\n\nFollowing the tour Eric made one of his final recordings. He played on an unknown Christmas charity song, probably recorded for \"Feed The Hungry\" for WPPH radio in December. According to Richie Scarlet, \"It was a song we did for a radio station in Poughkeepsie, New York, to help raise money for homeless kids. I was lucky to be a part of it. I played guitar and I believe John Regan played bass. Darryl Hall and Benny Mardonas played on it... I don't know the title of it, something about children. It was my one experience of recording with Eric Carr\" (Tommy Grant). Apart from the aforementioned \"First KISS, Last Licks\" promotional albums there really are no major collectibles from the \"Hot In The Shade\" album. Australia would be one of the few countries to issue three picture sleeve singles from the album, all of which feature unique artwork. Promotional 7\" singles for both \"Hide Your Heart\" and \"Forever\" are available from Canada, but it is not clear whether these actually made it to release and may have been for demonstration purposes only. The \"Forever\" single is alleged to have had a cover that was similar to the one used on the Australian version of the release. In the United Kingdom both \"Hide Your Heart\" and \"Forever\" were issued as 7\" singles. N addition to the aforementioned red vinyl single, a 10\" picture disc (KISX-10) was released that included \"Betrayed\" and \"Boomerang\" as the B-sides.\n\nThe \"Forever\" single was released on March 19, 1990 with 5,000 patches being packaged with the 7\" singles (and a further 7,500 with the 12\"). The standard 12\" single (KISX-11) also included \"All American Man,\" \"Shandi,\" and \"The Oath.\" A special edition gatefold (KISX-G11) included \"The Street Giveth... And The Street Taketh Away,\" and the 1973 demos of \"Deuce\" and \"Strutter.\" CD-singles were issued in many markets, though the stand-out would be the 3\" Japanese version of \"Hide Your Heart\" (PolyStar PPDS-18) of which only 1,000 copies were made. It should also be noted that during the tour (5/23/90), after many years of waiting, PolyGram had finally reissued the loved and reviled album \"The Elder\" on CD and audio cassette. This album had often been very difficult for fans to find in the preceding years and had been omitted from the original CD/Cassette reissues of 1985."
