        "text": "The Swedish entertainment company founded by ABBA's Björn Ulvaeus announced they had acquired the music catalogue, including master recordings and publishing rights and the name and likeness of KISS for $300m. Pophouse said they planned to use the deal to create a live music show featuring avatars of the members of Kiss, similar to Abba Voyage.\n\nA festival in Malaysia was cancelled after British singer Matty Healy attacked the country's anti-LGBT laws. During the performance by his band The 1975 at the Good Vibes Festival, Healy addressed the audience in a profanity-laden speech before kissing bass player Ross MacDonald. The band then ended their set, claiming officials ordered them off stage. Homosexuality is illegal in Malaysia and punishable by 20 years in prison. The band were headlining the Good Vibes Festival in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Friday.\n\nEric Moore, lead singer of Ohio-based biker rock group The Godz died after a battle with bladder cancer age 67.

He is noted for his collaborations with Steve Earle, Van Morrison, Shane MacGowan and Mark Knopfler, as well as for writing the song 'Moonlight Kiss' which was on the soundtrack for the film Serendipity. Kennedy was also in the rock band Energy Orchard.\n\nSinger Ronnie Gilbert, a member of the influential 1950s Folk quartet The Weavers, passed away at the age of 88. At the height of their popularity the quartet sold millions of records and are most often remembered for 'On Top Of Old Smoky', 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine' and 'Rock Island Line'.\n\nNirvana were enlisted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, alongside the likes of Kiss and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. REM's Michael Stipe inducted the group, saying: \"Nirvana tapped into a voice that was yearning to be heard. Nirvana were kicking against the mainstream. They spoke truth and a lot of people listened.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt was reported that Kiss planned to open over 100 restaurants in North America. The band who had just opened the third branch of Rock & Brews in the greater Los Angeles area said that they wished to open 100 more in the next five years.
