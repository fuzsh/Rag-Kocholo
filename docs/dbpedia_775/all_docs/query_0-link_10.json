        "text": "Publicity Handout (colorized / tinted by Bill Burke)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- You'd have to get pretty far down the list of the greatest artists of the 1970s before you reach a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame snub.\n\nThey're are some of course -- whether it's Kraftwerk, Peter Frampton or War. But, for the most part, the decade features a who's who of the greatest acts of all time experiencing their creative peaks.\n\nThis was the post Beatles era, where the race for the biggest band in the world was wide open and several solo artists were taking creativity to new heights.\n\nHere we rank the greatest Rock and Roll Hall of Famers of the 1970s. As the title indicates, we're only working with artists that have been inducted into the Rock Hall.\n\nWe're also ONLY taking into account their resumes during the decade. Thus, The Rolling Stones' early classics don't count. Neither do Led Zeppelin's first two albums or anything The Who did pre-1970.\n\nThat made the process a bit challenging, but gave us, perhaps, a few surprising names near the top.\n\nPierre Guillaud\n\n25. Bob Dylan\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Self Portrait\" (1970) ★\n\n\"New Morning\" (1970) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid\" (1973) ★★1/2\n\n\"Planet Waves\" (1974) ★★★\n\n\"Blood on the Tracks\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Basement Tapes\" with The Band (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"Desire\" (1976) ★★★★\n\n\"Street-Legal\" (1978) ★★1/2\n\n\"Slow Train Coming\" (1979) ★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Tangled Up in Blue,\" \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"The Wheel's on Fire,\" \"Simple Twist of Fate,\" \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" \"Forever Young,\" \"Hurricane\"\n\nBeginning this countdown with Bob Dylan might see like musical sacrilege. But the 1970s was not (by any stretch) his most consistent decade. In fact, it began with what may be the worst album of Dylan's career in \"Self Portrait.\" Still, 1975's \"Blood on the Tracks\" makes up for a lot. As does \"The Basement Tapes,\" a must have for any real music collector. Dylan also released two very essential live albums in \"Before the Flood\" and \"Hard Rain,\" along with two multi-platinum greatest hits compilations and was an essential figure at the \"Concert for Bangladesh.\"\n\nPeter Cade\n\n24. KISS\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Kiss\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Hotter Than Hell\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Dressed to Kill\" (1975) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Alive!\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"Destroyer\" (1976) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Rock and Roll Over\" (1976) ★★★★\n\n\"Love Gun\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Dynasty\" (1979) ★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Rock and Roll All Nite,\" \"Detroit Rock City,\" \"Black Diamond,\" \"Love Gun,\" \"Deuce,\" \"Cold Gin\"\n\nLove them or hate them, KISS went on one hell of a roll during the 1970s. Many fans would contest that the band's first three albums marked the best studio efforts of its career. But you could make the case that \"Destroyer,\" \"Rock and Roll Over\" and \"Love Gun\" match them song-for-song. Sure, the decade ended on a disappointing note with 1979's \"Dynasty.\" But in the middle of it all was \"Alive!\" one of the greatest live albums ever made.\n\nJoel Davis\n\n23. Jackson Browne\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Jackson Browne\" (1972) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"For Everyman\" (1973) ★★★★\n\n\"Late for the Sky\" (1974) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Pretender\" (1976) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Running on Empty\" (1977) ★★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Doctor My Eyes,\" \"Rock Me on the Water,\" \"Take It Easy,\" \"Here Comes Those Tears Again,\" \"The Pretender,\" \"Running on Empty,\" \"Stay\"\n\nJackson Browne had, perhaps, the best stretch of any folk artist of the 1970s, beginning with the best debut album of 1972. \"For Everyman\" and \"Late for the Sky\" are undeniable classics, with the latter serving as Browne's masterpiece. And while \"The Pretender\" was a small step backwards for Browne, he bounced back in brilliant form on 1977's \"Running on Empty.\" Indeed, Jackson's songwriting was on par with anyone of his generation.\n\nExpress\n\n22. Eric Clapton\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Eric Clapton\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs\" with Derek and the Dominos (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"461 Ocean Boulevard\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"There's One in Every Crowd\" (1975) ★★★\n\n\"No Reason to Cry\" (1976) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Slow Hand\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Backless\" (1978) ★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Layla,\" \"Cocaine,\" \"Wonderful Tonight,\" \"I Shot the Sheriff,\" \"After Midnight,\" \"Bell Bottom Blues,\" \"Let It Rain\"\n\nThis list allows us to cheat a bit, taking into account projects an artist worked on that weren't considered in their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction. Derek and the Dominos are not in the Rock Hall. But it's impossible to examine Eric Clapton's 1970s-run without considering \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs,\" one of the best albums of the decade and, arguably, the greatest achievement of Clapton's career. Solo-wise, Clapton's albums were somewhat hit or miss. but when he was on, he was truly on, peaking with 1977's iconic \"Slow Hand.\"\n\nHi/London\n\n21. Al Green\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Al Green Gets Next to You\" (1971) ★★★★\n\n\"Let's Stay Together\" (1972) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"I'm Still in Love with You\" (1972) ★★★★★\n\n\"Call Me\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Livin' for You\" (1973) ★★★★\n\n\"Al Green Explores Your Mind\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Al Green Is Love\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Full of Fire\" (1976) ★★★\n\n\"Have a Good Time\" (1976) ★★★\n\n\"The Belle Album\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Truth n' Time\" (1978) ★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Let's Stay Together,\" \"Tire of Being Alone,\" \"Look What You Done for Me,\" \"I'm Still in Love with You,\" \"You Ought to Be with Me,\" \"Call Me\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine Al Green being underrated. But his 1970s run is certainly under-appreciated. Green made a name for himself in the 1960s mostly singing cover songs. But the next decade was all about him. His three-album journey featuring \"Let's Stay Together,\" \"I'm Still in Love with You\" and \"Call Me\" is among the greatest in R&B history. Thus, it's not surprising that Green's beloved \"Greatest Hits\" compilation came out right in the middle of the decade. He kept releasing solid albums during the second half of the 1970s, including his highly underrated \"The Belle Album,\" which stands as one of the most impressive efforts of Green's career.\n\nGeorge Rose\n\n20. Eagles\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Eagles\" (1972) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Desperado\" (1973) ★★★1/2\n\n\"On the Border\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"One of These Nights\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Hotel California\" (1976) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Long Run\" (1979) ★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Hotel California,\" \"New Kid in Town,\" \"One of These Nights,\" \"Heartache Tonight,\" \"Best of My Love,\" \"Lying Eyes,\" \"Take it to the Limit,\" \"Take It Easy,\" \"Life in the Fast Lane,\" \"Witchy Woman\"\n\nThere may have never been a moment, not even in the 1970s, where the Eagles were truly considered the best band in the world. But it always seemed like they were in contention for being the biggest. Right from the start, the band was a hit, going platinum with its 1972 self-titled debut. Multi-platinum efforts followed, building to the Eagles' commercial and creative peak in \"Hotel California.\" That album remains one of the biggest in music history. What's astonishing, however, is that the Eagles released their greatest hits album, which stands as the best-selling release (album of compilation) of all time, before \"Hotel California\" even came out.\n\nHandout\n\n19. Van Morrison\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Moondance\" (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"His Band and the Street Choir\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Tupelo Honey\" (1971) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Saint Dominic's Preview\" (1972) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Hard Nose the Highway\" (1973) ★★★\n\n\"Veedon Fleece\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"A Period of Transition\" (1977) ★★★\n\n\"Wavelength\" (1978) ★★★★\n\n\"Into the Music\" (1979) ★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Crazy Love,\" \"Domino,\" \"Wild Night,\" \"Tupelo Honey,\" \"Come Running,\" \"Moondance,\" \"Jackie Wilson Said,\" \"Listen To The Lion\"\n\nTo make this list the decade after your greatest album came out is an accomplishment in itself. Indeed, Van Morrison released his landmark \"Astral Weeks\" in 1968. But his commercial breakthrough came with 1970s' \"Moondance.\" Nothing Morrison released ever matched \"Moondance\" commercially. But he went on to produce one of the best album discographies of the decade, quietly releasing four (maybe five) albums that can be considered masterpieces in their own right.\n\nGary Burden\n\n18. Neil Young\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"After the Gold Rush\" (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"Harvest\" (1972) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"On the Beach\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Tonight's The Night\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"Zuma\" (1975) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"American Stars 'n Bars\" (1977) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Comes a Time\" (1978) ★★★★\n\n\"Rust Never Sleeps\" (1979) ★★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Old Man,\" \"After the Gold Rush,\" \"Powderfinger,\" \"Cortez the Killer,\" \"Ohio,\" \"Helpless,\" \"Tonight's the Night,\" \"Like a Hurricane,\" \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),\" \"The Needle and the Damage Done,\" \"Southern Man\"\n\nNeil Young has an odd induction history with the Rock Hall. He probably should be the second three-time inductee (along with Eric Clapton). Yet, he was excluded from Crosby, Stills & Nash's induction, despite being part of CSNY when the band released its greatest album \"Deja Vu\" in 1970. Of course, Young ruled the 1970s all by his lonesome, releasing his five best and most iconic albums...in a row. Influence wise, Young closed out the decade with 1979's highly influential \"Rust Never Sleeps,\" which served as a precursor to grunge.\n\nHandout\n\n17. Black Sabbath\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Black Sabbath\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Paranoid\" (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"Master of Reality\" (1971) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Vol. 4\" (1972) ★★★★\n\n\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\" (1973) ★★★★\n\n\"Sabotage\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Technical Ecstasy\" (1976) ★1/2\n\n\"Never Say Die!\" (1978) ★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Paranoid,\" \"Iron Man,\" \"The Wizard,\" \"Children of the Grave,\" \"War Pigs,\" \"Supernaut,\" \"N.I.B.,\" \"Symptom of the Universe\"\n\nHeavy metal was born, shaped and defined on the albums Black Sabbath released during the 1970s. Much attention is paid to the band's historic, first two albums, and rightfully so. But each fo the band's first six efforts rank among the greatest metal albums of all time. No band was important to a single genre during the 1970s than Sabbath was to metal.\n\nReprise\n\n16. Parliament-Funkadelic\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Funkadelic\" (1970) ★★★★\n\n\"Osmium\" (1970) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Free Your Mind…And Your Ass Will Follow\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Maggot Brain\" (1971)\" ★★★★★\n\n\"America Eats Its Young\" (1972) ★★★★\n\n\"Cosmic Slop\" (1973) ★★★★\n\n\"Standing On The Verge of Getting It On\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Up for the Down Stroke\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Chocolate City\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Let's Take It To The Stage\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Mothership Connection\" (1975) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein\" (1976) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Tales of Kidd Funkadelic\" (1976) ★★★\n\n\"Hardcore Jollies\" (1976) ★★★★\n\n\"Funkentelchy Vs. The Placebo Syndrome\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"One Nation Under a Groove\" (1978) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Motor Booty Affair\" (1978) ★★★★\n\n\"Gloryhallastoopid\" (1979) ★★★\n\n\"Uncle Jam Wants You\" (1979) ★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"One Nation Under a Groove,\" \"Tear the Roof Off the Sucker (Give Up the Funk),\" \"Mothership Connection (Star Child),\" \"Maggot Brain,\" \"(Not Just) Knee Deep,\" \"Flashlight\"\n\nThis was a bit unfair. But that's what happens when the Rock Hall combines two iconic acts in one for an induction. Separately, both George Clinton projects Funkadelic and Parliament had great decades during the 1970s. Together, their catalog is stunning. The peak, 1971's \"Maggot Brain\" came out early in the decade, while \"One Nation Under a Groove\" arrived in 1978. Mixed among those are some of funk's most inventive and essential albums and songs.\n\nSteve Wood\n\n15. The Who\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Who's Next\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"Quadrophenia\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Who by Numbers\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Who Are You\" (1978) ★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Won't Get Fooled Again,\" \"Who Are You?,\" \"See Me, Feel Me,\" \"Squeeze Box,\" \"Behind Blue Eyes,\" \"Baba O'Riley\"\n\nWho are we kidding? This feel's a bit low for The Who. At the same time, 15 is quite impressive considering \"My Generation,\" \"A Quick One,\" \"The Who Sell Out\" and \"Tommy\" don't count. Still, the 1970s delivered The Who's best albums in \"Who's Next,\" which contained \"Baba O'Riley,\" a song that all but invented synth rock. You could make the case \"Quadrophenia\" is a superior rock opera to \"Tommy.\" Either way, you have two monster rock albums before even mentioning \"Live at Leeds,\" one of the great live albums in music history.\n\nKeystone\n\n14. Ramones\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Ramones\" (1976) ★★★★★\n\n\"Leave Home\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Rocket to Russia\" (1977) ★★★★★\n\n\"Road to Ruin\" (1978) ★★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Blitzkrieg Bop,\" \"I Wanna Be Sedated,\" \"Rockaway Beach,\" \"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker,\" \"Teenage Lobotomy,\" \"Do You Remember Rock N Roll Radio\"\n\nIf we were judging this list based on influence alone, we would have included the Sex Pistols. But where as Johnny Rotten and company stopped making music after one album, Ramones' 1970s' crop of albums are near flawless. Much attention is paid to the band's iconic debut, which is one of the most important documents in the history of punk rock. But the two follow-ups -- \"Leave Home\" and \"Rocket Russia\" -- may have been all around efforts and finer examples of the energy the Ramones' live shows created.\n\nJohn Minihan\n\n13. The Rolling Stones\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Sticky Fingers\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"Exile on Main St.\" (1972) ★★★★★\n\n\"Goats Head Soup\" (1973) ★★★\n\n\"It's Only Rock 'n Roll\" (1974) ★★★\n\n\"Black and Blue\" (1976) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Some Girls\" (1978) ★★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Angie,\" \"Brown Sugar,\" \"Miss You,\" \"Tumbling Dice,\" \"Wild Horses,\" \"Beast of Burden,\" \"Moonlight Mile,\" \"Rocks Off\"\n\nNo band was bigger than The Rolling Stones at the start of the 1970s. The band was right in the middle of its greatest creative period, which led to the Stones' two greatest albums coming at the start of the decade. No one would fault you if you had both \"Sticky Fingers\" and \"Exile on Main St.\" in your top 10 rock albums of all time. Things took a dive from there. In fact, most people had written the Stones off before 1978's \"Some Girls,\" a hell of a comeback that became the band's best-selling album in the United States.\n\n12. Miles Davis\n\nAlbum:\n\n\"Bitches Brew\" (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"Jack Johnson\" (1970) ★★★★★\n\n\"Live-Evil\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"On the Corner\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"Big Fun\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Get Up with It\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Bitches Brew,\" \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down,\" \"Right Off,\" \"Prelude,\" \"Black Satin,\" \"He Loved Him Madly,\" \"Pharaoh's Bus\"\n\nHere's how brilliant Miles Davis was. He only worked half a decade in the 1970s and, yet, you could conceivably make the case his catalog of albums from that period measure up to any other artist on this list. Things began with two jazz classics in \"Bitches Brew\" and \"Jack Johnson.\" Yet, there are many Miles Davis fans who might proclaim 1971's \"On the Corner\" as his greatest overall work. Either way, Davis could do no wrong in the 1970s, even if the decade pushed him into retirement for six years.\n\nJim Pozarik\n\n11. Bruce Springsteen\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\" (1973) ★★★★\n\n\"The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Born to Run\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" (1978) ★★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Born to Run,\" \"Jungleland,\" \"Thunder Road,\" \"Badlands,\" \"Prove It All Night,\" \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight),\" \"Tenth Avenue Freeze Out\"\n\nSpringsteen became one of the biggest rock stars in he world during the 1980s. But he was already producing brilliant work in the 1970s, including his greatest album, \"Born to Run.\" You could make the case that \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" and \"The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle\" fall right behind it in the Springsteen rankings. This was also Springsteen's most influential period, as he was developing the blueprint for heartland rock and roll, while becoming the most revered singer-songwriter since Bob Dylan.\n\nKeystone/Getty\n\n10. Queen\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Queen\" (1973) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Queen II\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Sheer Heart Attack\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"A Night at the Opera\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"A Day at the Races\" (1976) ★★★1/2\n\n\"News of the World\" (1977) ★★★\n\n\"Jazz\" (1978) ★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"We Are the Champions,\" \"We Will Rock You,\" \"Somebody to Love,\" \"Killer Queen,\" \"You're My Best Friend,\" \"Bicycle\"\n\nPretty much from the start, Queen was unlike anything the rock world had ever seen. The band's hard rock style was unrelenting and got more and more dramatic with each album. Quality wise, the band certainly got better after its self-titled debut, the album is still something to marvel at. Things reach their peak with the decade center pieces \"Sheer Heart Attack\" and \"A Night at the Opera.\" And while Queen never fully captured that album-magic again, the band kept releasing iconic songs that would sell and sell and sell.\n\nKeystone\n\n9. Bob Marley\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Soul Rebels\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Soul Revolution\" (1971) ★★★★\n\n\"Catch a Fire\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Burnin'\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Natty Dread\" (1974) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Rastaman Vibration\" (1976) ★★★★\n\n\"Exodus\" (1977) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Kaya\" (1978) ★★★★\n\n\"Survival\" (1979) ★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"No Woman, No Cry,\" \"Is This Love?,\" \"Jamming,\" \"Get Up, Stand Up,\" \"Waiting In Vain,\" \"I Shot the Sheriff\"\n\nBob Marley gets so much credit as a revolutionary, his amazing catalog of albums often gets overlooked. His run during the 1970s was, to say the least, impressive. Marley and the Wailers' first eight (yes, eight!) albums are all landmarks of the reggae genre. Most people know the hits, but each of Marley's 1970s efforts are worth a listen to underscore his impact on reggae and popular music as a whole.\n\nKeystone Features\n\n8. Pink Floyd\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Atom Heart Mother\" (1970) ★\n\n\"Meddle\" (1971) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Obscured by Clouds\" (1972) ★★★1/2\n\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Wish You Were Here\" (1975) ★★★★★\n\n\"Animals\" (1977) ★★★★\n\n\"The Wall\" (1979) ★★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"Money,\" \"Wish You Were Here,\" \"Comfortably Numb,\" \"Time,\" \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond (Part 1)\"\n\nThere's no denying that Pink Floyd released three masterpieces during the 1970s that rank among the biggest and best albums of all time. Yet, how you rank them on this list (they could go as high as No. 1) depends on how you feel about the band's work outside of \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" Wish You Were Here\" and \"The Wall.\" Sure, 1970's \"Atom Heart Mother\" was a dud. But to many fans, \"Meddle and \"Animals\" rank right up there with Pink Floyd's classics. It's also worth pointing out how much of a juggernaut of a band Pink Floyd was toward the decade's end. By the time \"The Wall\" came out at the end of 1979, this was the biggest rock band in the world.\n\nSTR/Getty\n\n7. The Clash\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"The Clash\" (1977) ★★★★★\n\n\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\" (1978) ★★★★\n\n\"London Calling\" (1979) ★★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"(White Man) in Hammersmith Palais,\" \"London Calling,\" \"Complete Control,\" \"White Riot,\" \"I Fought the Law,\" \"I'm So Bored With the U.S.A.,\" \"Train In Vain\"\n\nJust three albums earns The Clash a spot in the top-10. Of course, one of those albums rates as one of the greatest debuts of all time, while another, \"London Calling,\" maybe the best album of the entire decade. The Clash's first three albums are as influential as it gets, defining punk rock while expanding the genre into the post-punk era.\n\nJack Kay\n\n6. Elton John\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Elton John\" (1970) ★★★★\n\n\"Tumbleweed Connection\" (1970) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Madman Across the Water\" (1971) ★★★★\n\n\"Honky Chateau\" (1972) ★★★★★\n\n\"Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player\" (1973) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Caribou\" (1974) ★★★\n\n\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Rock of the Westies\" (1975) ★★★1/2\n\n\"Blue Moves\" (1975) ★★1/2\n\n\"A Single Man\" (1978) ★★\n\n\"Victim of Love\" (1979) ★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Crocodile Rock,\" \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\" \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" \"Daniel,\" \"Bennie & the Jets,\" \"Your Song,\" \"Rocket Man,\" \"Tiny Dancer,\" \"Candle in the Wind\"\n\nElton John was the quintessential rock star of the 1970s. He was prolific. He had huge songs. And he had iconic albums that people still have in rotation today. John's self-titled debut would foreshadow the brilliance that would come over his next five efforts, peaking with the blockbuster nature of \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\" John's decade slowed to a crawl during the second half. But by then he had built up one heck of a greatest hits catalog.\n\nRoy Jones\n\n5. Joni Mitchell\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Ladies of the Canyon\" (1970) ★★★★\n\n\"Blue\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"For the Roses\" (1972) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Court and Spark\" (1974) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Hissing Summer Lawns\" (1975) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Hejira\" \"1976) ★★★★\n\n\"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter\" (1977) ★★★\n\n\"Mingus\" (1979) ★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"River,\" \"A Case of You,\" \"Big Yellow Taxi,\" \"Help Me,\" \"Woodstock,\" \"Chelsea Morning,\" \"Free Man in Paris,\" \"You Turn Me On I'm a Radio\"\n\nJoni Mitchell is the only woman on this list, which may be criminal considering the decades Blondie, Aretha Franklin, Fleetwood Mac and Gladys Knight and the Pips had. Still, none of them or most men for that matter could measure up to Mitchell's stellar work during the 1970s. \"Blue\" is one of the greatest albums of all time. But it is, by no means, Mitchell's only classic. Aside from her 1979 album \"Mingus,\" everything Mitchell released during the decade should be studied by aspiring singer-songwriters everywhere.\n\nEvening Standard\n\n4. Marvin Gaye\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"That's the Way Love Is\" (1970) ★★1/2\n\n\"What's Going On\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"Trouble Man\" (1972) ★★★★\n\n\"Let's Get It On\" (1973) ★★★★★\n\n\"Diana & Marven\" with Diana Ross ★★★1/2\n\n\"I Want You\" (1976) ★★★★★\n\n\"Here, My Dear\" (1978) ★★★★1/2\n\nKey Songs: \"What's Going On,\" \"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology),\" \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler),\" \"Trouble Man,\" \"Let's Get It On,\" \"Distant Lover,\" \"Got to Give It Up\" (Part 1), \"Is That Enough\"\n\n\"What's Going On\" is, perhaps, the greatest R&B album of all time. \"Let's Get It On\" and \"I Want You\" are two of the most influential albums the genre has ever seen. Yet, it still feels like Marvin Gaye was one of the greatest artists of the 1970s in somewhat low-key fashion. That's because many of his biggest hits came about during the 1960s. But it was the 70s where Gaye came into his own creatively. The result is politically and sexually charged music that would redefine soul music. \"What's Going On\" gave birth to the R&B concept album. \"Let's Get It On\" is the most sexually charged album of all time. \"I Want You\" laid the blueprint for quiet-storm music. \"Here, My Dear\" is a breakup album like no other. Gaye's influence would rain supreme from that point on.\n\nHulton Archive\n\n3. Led Zeppelin\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Led Zeppelin III\" (1970) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Led Zeppelin IV\" (1971) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Houses of the Holy\" (1973) ★ ★ ★ ★ 1/2\n\n\"Physical Graffiti\" (1975) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Presence\" (1976) ★★★\n\n\"In Through the Out Door\" (1979) ★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Whole Lotta Love,\" \"Stairway to Heaven,\" \"Immigrant Song,\" \"Black Dog,\" \"Kashmir,\" \"Dazed & Confused,\" \"Rock 'n' Roll,\" \"When the Levee Breaks\"\n\nThere was really nothing else like Led Zeppelin during this period of the band's career. Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham kicked off the decade with four monster rock albums. No band sounded bigger or better. Led Zeppelin began the decade with a daring change of pace, embracing acoustic rock on 1970's \"Led Zeppelin III.\" The band followed that up with what might be the most well-rounded rock album ever. If you thought things couldn't get bigger, \"Physical Graffiti\" arrived in staggering double-album form. The band finally stumbled on \"Presence\" and \"In Through the Out Door.\" Thus, we learned Zeppelin was human after a half-decade that made the members rock gods.\n\nCentral Press\n\n2. David Bowie\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" (1970)★★★★\n\n\"Hunky Dory\" (1971) ★★★★★\n\n\"The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\" (1972) ★★★★★\n\n\"Aladdin Sane\" (1973) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Pin Ups\" (1973) ★★1/2\n\n\"Diamond Dogs\" (1974) ★★★★\n\n\"Young Americans\" (1975) ★★★★\n\n\"Station to Station\" (1976) ★★★★1/2\n\n\"Low\" (1977) ★★★★★\n\n\"Heroes\" (1977) ★★★★★\n\n\"Lodger\" (1979) ★★★★\n\nKey Songs: \"Fame,\" \"Space Oddity,\" \"Starman,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Changes,\" \"Young Americans,\" \"Rebel Rebel,\" \"Sound & Vision,\" \"Life on Mars?,\" \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\"\n\nDavid Bowie released an impressive 11 albums in the 1970s and only one of them is a true dud. \"Pin Ups\" is such an outlier when you look at the rest of Bowie's 1970s catalog, from the inventive \"The Man Who Sold the World\" to the underrated brilliance of \"Lodger.\" Bowie released no less than four masterpieces during the period, which included his highly influential Berlin Trilogy. Few artists have ever been so daring musically. It's the decade that made Bowie an icon.\n\nEvening Standard\n\n1. Stevie Wonder\n\nAlbums:\n\n\"Signed, Sealed & Delivered\" (1970) ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Where I'm Coming From\" (1971) ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Music of My Mind\" (1972) ★ ★ ★ ★1/2\n\n\"Talking Book\" (1972) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Innervisions\" (1973) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Fulfillingness' First Finale\" (1974) ★ ★ ★ ★1/2\n\n\"Songs in the Key of Life\" (1976) ★ ★ ★ ★ ★\n\n\"Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants\" (1979) ★ ★ ★\n\nKey Songs:\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours,\" \"Superstition,\" \"Sir Duke,\" \"You Are the Sunshine of My Life,\" \"I Wish,\" \"Living For the City,\" \"Boogie On Reggae Woman,\" \"Higher Ground\"\n\nIt's been hailed as the greatest creative period in music history, which is saying something. But the core of Stevie Wonder's 1970s run truly ranks right up there with the peak periods of The Beatles, Prince and Led Zeppelin. It's not just that the albums were great, which they were -- Wonder released five of the greatest R&B albums of all time in a row from 1972 through 1976. It's that with each effort, Wonder redefined popular music. His \"classic period\" began with \"Signed, Sealed & Delivered\" and \"Where I'm Coming From,\" where Wonder moved out of child star territory. On 1972's \"Music of My Mind,\" Wonder developed into a creative genius, taking control of the production and instrumentation on his albums. \"Innervisions\" saw him reach perfection, while \"Songs in the Key of Life\" pushed Wonder to his creative peak (and, perhaps, the pinnacle of the soul, funk and R&B genres)."
