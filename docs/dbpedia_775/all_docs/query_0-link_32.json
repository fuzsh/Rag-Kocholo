        "text": "Let’s sing it: “I love rock 'n' roll, so put another dime in the jukebox, baby!” Sure, rock and roll may not be what most people think of when it comes to wedding music, but rock songs perennially pop up on many wedding playlists at receptions. From classic rock by bands like AC/DC and Queen to modern alt-rock, including Panic! at the Disco and Imagine Dragons, guitar-centric music makes for great moments on the dance floor.\n\nMore specifically, you can keep the majority of your playlist's rock music to the songs of your youth with bands like Jimmy Eat World, Oasis, and Blink 182, or, to keep the good mood going, opt for today’s electronic and indie-rock beats as dance-floor fillers. No matter what songs you add to your must-play list, however, you’ll love belting out the choruses as much as your guests—and rock tunes are the perfect way to get your crowd hyped up throughout your entire reception.\n\nAhead, here are our picks for the 100 best rock wedding songs to add to your playlist.\n\n01 of 100\n\n“You Shook Me All Night Long,” by AC/DC\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Working double time/On the seduction line/She was one of a kind, she's just mine all mine\"\n\n02 of 100\n\n\"Back in Black,” by AC/DC\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Back in the back/Of a Cadillac/Number one with a bullet, I'm a power pack\"\n\n03 of 100\n\n\"Pour Some Sugar on Me,” by Def Leppard\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on/Livin' like a lover with a radar phone\"\n\n04 of 100\n\n\"We Will Rock You,” by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Buddy, you're a young man, hard man/Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday\"\n\n05 of 100\n\n\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll,” by Joan Jett\n\nLyrics of Love: \"The beat was going strong, playing my favorite song/And I could tell it wouldn't be long till he was with me/Yeah with me\"\n\n06 of 100\n\n\"Sweet Home Alabama,” by Lynyrd Skynyrd\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Sweet home Alabama/Where the skies are so blue/Sweet home Alabama/Lord, I'm coming home to you\"\n\n07 of 100\n\n\"Livin' on a Prayer,” by Bon Jovi\n\nLyrics of Love: \"She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got/It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not/We've got each other and that's a lot for love/We'll give it a shot\"\n\n08 of 100\n\n\"Take Me Home Tonight,” by Eddie Money\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Take me home tonight/I don't wanna let you go 'til you see the light/Take me home tonight/Listen, honey, just like Ronnie sang/Be my little baby\"\n\n09 of 100\n\n\"Here I Go Again,” by Whitesnake\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Just another heart in need of rescue/Waiting on love's sweet charity/I'm gonna hold on for the rest of my days\"\n\n10 of 100\n\n\"Carry on Wayward Son,” by Kansas\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Carry on, you will always remember/Carry on, nothing equals the splendor\"\n\n11 of 100\n\n\"Sweet Child o' Mine,” by Guns N’ Roses\n\nLyrics of Love: \"She's got a smile it seems to me/Reminds me of childhood memories/Where everything/Was as fresh as the bright blue sky\"\n\n12 of 100\n\n\"We’re Not Gonna Take It,” by Twisted Sister\n\nLyrics of Love: \"We've got the right to choose it/There ain't no way we'll lose it/This is our life, this is our song\"\n\n13 of 100\n\n\"Jump,” by Van Halen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"And I know, baby, just how you feel/You got to roll with the punches and get to what's real\"\n\n14 of 100\n\n\"Peace of Mind,” by Boston\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I understand about indecision/But I don't care if I get behind/People livin' in competition/All I want is to have my peace of mind\"\n\n15 of 100\n\n\"Mr. Jones,” by Counting Crows\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Smilin' in the bright lights/Coming through in stereo/When everybody loves you/You can never be lonely\"\n\n16 of 100\n\n\"Edge of Seventeen,” by Stevie Nicks\n\nLyrics of Love: \"With the words from a poet/And the voice from a choir/And a melody nothing else mattered\"\n\n17 of 100\n\n\"Fat Bottomed Girls,” by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Oh, won't you take me home tonight?/Oh, down beside your red firelight\"\n\n18 of 100\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody,” by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Because I'm easy come, easy go/Little high, little low/Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me\"\n\n19 of 100\n\n\"Don't Stop Me Now,\" by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I'm traveling at the speed of light/I wanna make a supersonic woman of you\"\n\n20 of 100\n\n\"Mr. Brightside,” by The Killers\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Gotta gotta be down/Because I want it all/It started out with a kiss/How did it end up like this?\"\n\n21 of 100\n\n\"The Middle,” by Jimmy Eat World\n\nLyrics of Love: \"It just takes some time/Little girl your in the middle of the ride/Everything, everything will be just fine\"\n\n22 of 100\n\n\"Wonderwall,” by Oasis\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I don't believe that anybody/Feels the way I do, about you now\"\n\n23 of 100\n\n\"Sugar, We’re Goin’ Down,” by Fall Out Boy\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear/Cause that's just who I am this week\"\n\n24 of 100\n\n\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies,” by Panic!

of the moment. These songs tend to be upbeat and energetic to get everyone in the celebratory mood.\n\nWhat songs should you not play at a wedding?\n\nAny tunes that are likely to ruin the mood are best kept off your wedding playlist. These can include songs that remind you of an ex or lyrics that don't match the vibe (such as ones that allude to infidelity or loss). It's also best to keep the guests' ages and preferences in mind, as some party songs may be too sexual for the older, younger, or more conservative attendees."
