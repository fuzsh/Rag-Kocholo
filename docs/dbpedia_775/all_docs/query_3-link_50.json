        "text": "Story Behind the Song: 'Livin on a Prayer'\n\nLet's pretend for a moment that you're not familiar with Bon Jovi's \"Livin' On a Prayer.\" The 1986 rock anthem — a No. 1 hit that went on to become the band's signature song — tells the tale of Tommy and Gina, a working class couple who struggle to make ends meet and vow to \"hold on to what we've got.\"\n\nBandmates Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora also were coming from a scrappy background as they met with their \"Prayer\" co-writer, master popsmith Desmond Child. He first wrote with the pair in the basement of Sambora's parents' house — on the edge of a marsh and in the shadow of an oil refinery. He recalled writing with Bon Jovi and Sambora and \"Prayer's\" legendary status in New Jersey with Bart Herbison, executive director of Nashville Songwriters Association International.\n\nBart Herbison: This story starts with Paul Stanley of KISS.\n\nDesmond Child: That's right. I got a call from this kid in a rock band from New Jersey. His name was Jon Bon Jovi. And he had gotten my number from Paul Stanley, because they had been the opening act for KISS in Europe that year. This was 1985, I think. He talked me into coming out to Jersey, so I had to rent a car, drive out there to this little wooden house. It was like the last house on the last little block. Behind it was a ginormous marsh, and at the end of the marsh, it was like Emerald City, it was an oil refinery. Healthy place to live, right? It was Richie Sambora's parents' house, and that's where he grew up. I walk in, and Richie comes to the door, shows me down the hallway. I look into his room: posters of Farrah Fawcett and KISS. Went into the kitchen, and Jon, with his big, giant mullet, was on the phone, (with) lots of rings, lots of torn jeans and stuff. There was no place to be, so Richie showed me downstairs. It (had) a little keyboard on a tottering Formica table. There was a space heater because it was kind of cold, and there were some buzzing amps. And I just sat down there for a long time, and Richie was trying to do his best, being Mr. Nice Guy, talking to me. Then Jon came down. I had brought a title with me. We sort of sat around, and I said, \"Well, I've got a title. It's called 'You Give Love a Bad Name.\" (Jon) loved that. He had a title he loved, which was on his previous record, a song called \"Shot Through the Heart.\" That's how we opened it. \"Shot through the heart and you're to blame/Darling, you give love a bad name.\"\n\nWhen do you write 'Livin' On a Prayer'?\n\n\"You Give Love a Bad Name\" turned out so great that they asked to co-write with me again, and this time I said, \"No, this time, you're coming to New York City.\" I think they took the (train) out or something, and we met in a little apartment that was borrowed from a friend who had a piano. We started writing this story song about Tommy and Gina.\n\nAnd it's autobiographical, to some degree, to you.\n\nWell, to me. But I think that each person, there was something autobiographical — for Jon with his relationship with (wife) Dorothea, because they were high school sweethearts. In my case, I had a girlfriend that I started my first band (with), called Desmond Child & Rouge. Her name was Maria Vidal. I stayed home writing songs, and she worked as a waitress at a place called Once Upon a Stove. They called her Gina because she reminded them of (Italian actress) Gina Lollobrigida. So we started the song off with Johnny and Gina because Johnny was my original name. And (Jon) said, \"I can't be singing about Johnny. My name's Johnny.\" It was like, \"OK ... Tommy then. Tommy and Gina.\" And that's where Tommy and Gina were born.\n\nThat's the national anthem for New Jersey, essentially, and you've got to hear that all the time.\n\nIt's absolutely a national anthem. I think Gov. (Chris) Christie is going to actually make it the anthem of New Jersey. It's also the No. 1 song played at the end of the night at strip joints in New Jersey.\n\nBut so many people identify with that, especially anybody that came up hard, that had to earn a living, that knew life from that level up.\n\nThat's like most of us, right? I think it has an appeal that has lasted generations."
