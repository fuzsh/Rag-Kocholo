        "text": "When you’re a member of what you rank as the greatest rock band to emerge from the United States, why would you choose to take that band off the road?\n\nWhy say goodbye, and what’s the right way to say it?\n\nPaul Stanley, singer, songwriter and guitarist for Kiss, shared his thoughts on these matters, as the band stops in town on a farewell tour that stretches into 2021.\n\nQuestion: What have critics gotten wrong about Kiss?\n\nAnswer: I don’t know. It’s their issues, not mine. Clearly, they didn’t reflect in the early days the views of the fans, and critics saw themselves somehow as a higher power that was there to educate the public as opposed to reflect the public. Whether or not somebody likes a certain food is irrelevant to a different person. Art, music, food, it’s all up to the person who’s experiencing it. It’s odd to me when somebody tells you what’s good and bad, because what’s good and bad is totally subjective.\n\nQ: Speaking of subjective, who’s the greatest rock band to come out of New York City?\n\nA: You’re speaking to one of the members.\n\nQ: Who’s the greatest American rock band?\n\nA: Rock is such a broad term. What’s considered rock is everything from the Eagles to ... pick it &mldr;\n\nQ: The Grateful Dead.\n\nA: Anything but that, please.\n\nQ: You said, “pick it.” I picked one. Who’s the greatest American rock band?\n\nA: The greatest American rock band is Kiss.\n\nQ: Who’s the greatest all-time rock band in the world?\n\nA: Led Zeppelin.\n\nQ: Would Kiss be on the short list?\n\nA: For some. Again, it’s a matter of opinion, and some people would include bands to me that have very little to do with rock. It’s really an individual taste. I have no doubt when I’m on stage on this tour every night that the feeling that I had about the bands I saw in my young days, who I considered the greats, I have no doubt that we’re one of them now.\n\nQ: Like who? Who are those bands you’re thinking of?\n\nA: The bands that influenced and inspired me. Humble Pie. The Who. You name the rest. Classic-rock bands are the Mount Rushmore of rock and roll. Are we part of that? Hell yeah. You don’t last 45 or 50 years playing arenas and stadiums by not being worthy of that.\n\nQ: You mentioned Humble Pie. I recently spoke with Peter Frampton, who’s doing a farewell tour because of a medical condition. Why are you guys attaching any permanence to your tour by calling it a farewell? If you’re able-bodied and can go out and play in five years, why paint yourself into a corner and subject yourself to ridicule if you end up coming back?\n\nA: I don’t give a (care) about somebody who chooses to ridicule me for anything. Those people have their own problems. Cynics be damned. My life is my own. But, that being said, there’s a reality and a practicality to what we do versus what other rock bands do. If we were up there in jeans and athletic shoes and T-shirts, we could do this into our 90s. We’re carrying 40, 50 pounds of gear around and running around making it look easy. We’re not those other bands. Those bands have a day at the beach. I could do that and come off stage with a walker. We’re not those bands. We have a certain expiration date. To do this at the level that we do it, we can’t do it indefinitely. What we do is not for the faint of heart. It’s far more than standing up looking at your guitar.\n\nQ: Have you seen the new Bob Dylan documentary about his Rolling Thunder tour?\n\nA: That I haven’t. I remember when Bob did that tour, and I said, “Gee, some of my white makeup must be missing.”\n\nQ: He says in the documentary he got the idea for the makeup from Kiss. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth.\n\nA: At that point, I know Gene (Simmons) was friendly with Scarlet Rivera (Dylan’s violinist), so, yeah, it makes perfect sense, and it was his first time really playing for larger, arena-type audiences, and it made perfect sense to be seen to highlight your face.\n\nQ: Dylan says in the movie: “When someone is wearing a mask, he’s going to tell you the truth.” As someone who has worn a mask, would you agree?\n\nA: I don’t know if he means a mask figuratively or literally. I’ve never seen me as wearing a mask. I’ve chosen an identity that pretty much highlights or magnifies part of who I am. I’m not hiding behind something. That’s basically why when we took off the makeup, I was the same person. I’m not playing a part. Who I am on stage is a big part and what I look like is a big part of who I am.\n\nQ: What’s the most important song you’ve written?\n\nA: The song that I guess is the most unifying and anthemic in terms of universality would be “Rock and Roll All Nite,” but other than that being the celebratory anthem it is and pretty much the template for every other band coming up with an anthem afterward, I think “Detroit Rock City” and “Love Gun” are pretty high up on that chart.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: Kiss\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 29\n\nWhere: Riverbend Music Center, 6295 Kellogg Ave., Anderson Township; 513-232-5882"
