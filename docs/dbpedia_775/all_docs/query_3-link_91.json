        "text": "Longtime musician and on-air Maui radio personality Shane Kaonohiokalā Kahalehau of KPOA 93.5 FM was honored Aug. 3 at the Hawai‘i Convention Center in Honolulu during the 47th annual Nā Hōkū Hanohano Awards with the award for Most Promising Artist of the Year.\n\n“I’m so humbled to be in the presence of all of our music makers of Hawai‘i,” said Kahalehau while accepting the award. “It’s no doubt that I wouldn’t be here this evening if not for my king and savior Jesus Christ.”\n\nHe described winning the prestigious award from the Hawai‘i Academy of Recording Arts as a “full circle” moment in his 30-year career.\n\nThroughout those 3 decades, Kahalehau has been a member of successful island musical groups including the Hawaiian Rhythm Band, Island Heat and Sly Dog.\n\n“I started as a young child playing ‘ukulele and singing Hawaiian music, and though reggae music has been my forte, Hawaiian music will forever be the music of my heart,” he said.\n\nKahalehau grew up in the Hawaiian homestead of Paukūkalo, nearly 2.5 miles northeast from Wailuku on Maui.\n\nHis radio career began in 1994 at Pacific Media Group, where he is now known as “Hawaiian Home Boy” to his on-air audience.\n\nHe is now the station’s program director and host of the “Aloha Morning Show” from 6 to 10 a.m.\n\nKahalehau received his “Hawaiian Home Boy” moniker from his mentor and fellow KPOA radio personality the late Henry “Boy” Kana‘e, who was also known as “The Hawaiian Supaman.”\n\n“I am so proud, to say the least. I know how genuine Shane is,” said Sherri Grimes, vice president and general manager of Maui radio operations at Pacific Media Group. “Shane’s authenticity comes across every morning on KPOA, and that same connection is made through his music. One of many things I appreciate working with Shane is he always keeps it real.”\n\nIn addition to his win as the Most Promising Artist of the Year, Kahalehau also garnered a nomination for EP Release of the Year.\n\nThat award went to “In Your Hawaiian Way” by the late Bruddah Waltah Aipolani, who Kahalehau paid tribute to during the ceremony in a medley performance alongside Sean Na‘auao and Mana‘o Company.\n\nKahalehau was honored for his work on “Kaonohiokalā,” an album produced by fellow Maui musicians Kason Gomes and Kalani Miles of Mea Nui Records.\n\nThe album features favorites such as “‘Īnikiniki Mālie” and “Kaulana Nā Pua.” It also includes original compositions “Do Right,” and “Tight Rope.” It ends fittingly with “Isaiah 40:31,” a promise of renewed strength for the weary.\n\nKahalehau’s son Nuʻu continues the family’s music legacy and is a minister at King’s Cathedral Maui in Kahului.\n\nWhile this was his first Nā Hōkū Hanohano win, it is the third time Kahalehau has been nominated for one of the awards by the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts.\n\nPacific Media Group is a Hawai‘i-based media company with offices on Maui, O‘ahu, Kauaʻi and the Big Island.\n\nThe company owns and operates 21 radio stations throughout the islands, including KPOA 93.5 FM, “HI92” 92.5 FM, KJKS 99.9 “Kiss” FM and KJMD “Da Jam” 98.3 FM on Maui; KAPA 99.1 FM and 100.3 FM, KPVS The Beat 95.9 FM and 93.9 FM and KBIG 97.9 FM on the Big Island; and KSHK “Shaka” 103.1 FM, KSRF “HI95 95.9 FM and KQNG 93.5 FM on Kauaʻi.\n\nThe media firm also owns three digital news sites — MauiNow.com, BigIslandNow.com and KauaiNow.com — and multiple other website, app and digital radio products such as PMGHawaii.com and HawaiiAirportAdvertising.com."
