        "text": "Adams noted in a statement that he \"co-wrote\" the tracks with Gene Simmons and Jim Vallance \"when I was a 22-year-old struggling songwriter\"\n\nBryan Adams has gone independent!\n\nThe acclaimed \"Summer of '69\" creator, 64, announced the founding of his new independent record label, Bad Records, on Friday, Aug. 2, per NME. To coincide with the label's inception, Adams has also released a new double A-side single vinyl containing the tracks \"War Machine\" and \"Rock and Roll Hell,\" both of which Adams originally wrote alongside Jim Vallance and Gene Simmons for the 1982 KISS album Creatures of the Night and now serve as the first official releases on Bad Records.\n\n\"Rock and Roll Hell\" is currently available digitally, and was released with an accompanying music video that sees Adams performing on the rooftop of London’s Royal Albert Hall during his recent three-night residency at the venue.\n\nRelated: Bryan Adams Details Friendship with Amy Winehouse: 'I Tried to Help Her'\n\nIn a statement shared with the publication, Adams noted that he \"co-wrote\" the two songs \"when I was a 22-year-old struggling songwriter.\"\n\n\"I got a call out of the blue from producer Michael James Jackson to see if I would like to write for KISS, which I was thrilled to do, and these are a couple of the songs that were the result, written with both Gene Simmons and Jim Vallance,\" he continued.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nTouching on the genesis of \"War Machine,\" the songwriter noted, \"While sitting with the band, Gene played me this fantastic bass riff, which ended up being the backbone of ‘War Machine.' I was trying to think of a theme that could possibly match the riff and came up with the title. Seeing as the other song we’d written was about hell, War was the obvious theme to coincide with it.\"\n\nRelated: Gene Simmons Considers KISS Catalog Sale a 'Natural Thing': 'Out of Respect and Love for the Fans' (Exclusive)\n\nAs for the other track, Adams shared that \" ‘Rock and Roll Hell’ was actually Jim’s song that had been released a few years earlier with Bachman Turner Overdrive, and I suggested, that we rewrite it for KISS.\"\n\n\"It’s incredible to think these themes are unfortunately still playing out for real in the world today, but I’m very grateful to the KISS guys for giving me the chance back then,\" he highlighted.\n\nCopies of the double A-side single vinyl are currently available for preorder on Adams' official online shop.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
