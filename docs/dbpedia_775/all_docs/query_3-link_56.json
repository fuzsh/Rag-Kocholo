        "text": "“Better Than Revenge” original lyric: “She’s not a saint and she’s not what you think, she’s an actress / She’s better known for the things that she does on the mattress.”\n\n“Better Than Revenge” tweaked lyric: Swift keeps the first line the same, but changes the latter line to: “He was a moth to the flame, she was holding the matches.”\n\nOn the original song — an album cut from the 2010 project rumored to be inspired by ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas and his post-Taylor girlfriend Camilla Belle — Swift was accused of “slut-shaming,” and changed the lyric in the re-recorded version.\n\nWhen asked about the controversy swirling around the song by The Guardian in 2014, four years after the song’s release, Swift said, “I was 18 when I wrote that. That’s the age you are when you think someone can actually take your boyfriend. Then you grow up and realize no one take someone from you if they don’t want to leave.”\n\nListen to “Better Than Revenge” here.\n\n“Picture to Burn” original lyric: “So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy/ That’s fine, I’ll tell mine you’re gay, by the way”\n\n“Picture to Burn” tweaked lyric: “That’s fine, you won’t mind if I say, by the way”\n\nThough it’s been decades since the lyrics to “Picture to Burn” — one of Taylor Swift’s most beloved tracks from her 2006 debut album — were updated with less inflammatory language, there was once a time when the single was criticized for being homophobic in its inclusion of the word “gay” in a negative context. In 2011, the pop star told MTV about the song: “Now, the way that I would say that and the way that I would feel that kind of pain is a lot different.”\n\nListen to “Picture to Burn” here.\n\nOriginal lyrics: “No matter Black, white or beige, chola, or Orient’ made/ I’m on the right track, baby, I was born to be brave”\n\nTweaked lyrics: “No matter Black, white or beige, Asian or Latinx made/ I’m on the right track, baby, I was born to be brave”\n\nWhen Lady Gaga’s third studio record Born This Way celebrated its 10 year anniversary in 2021, the pop pioneer enlisted a handful of artists who represent and advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community to record new versions of some of the album’s most loved songs. Among them was Orville Peck, who put his spin on the title track. But in his interpretation, he added a few updates to lyrics that didn’t age so gracefully over those 10 years — namely where Gaga identifies racial groups with offensive titles.\n\nListen to Orville Peck’s cover of “Born This Way” here.\n\nOriginal lyric: “See the little f—-t with the earring and the makeup?/ Yeah buddy, that’s his own hair/ That little f—-t got his own jet airplane/ That little f—-t, he’s a millionaire”\n\nTweaked lyric: “See that little queenie with the earring and the makeup … That little boy got his own jet airplane/ That little boy, he’s a millionaire”\n\n1985’s “Money for Nothing” has been the subject of much controversy for its use of a homophobic slur, so much so that it was deemed unacceptable for airplay on Canadian radio stations until the decision was reversed in 2011. The song’s lyrics were recorded by Sting as a guest artist on the track, but when former Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler performs it in concert, he substitutes the slur.\n\nListen to “Money for Nothing” here.\n\nOriginal lyric: “Jew me, sue me/ Everybody, do me/ Kick me, k–e me/ Don’t you black or white me”\n\nTweaked lyric: “Do me, sue me/ Everybody, do me/ Kick me, [censored] me/ Don’t you black or white me”\n\nThe King of Pop did not seem to understand at first the backlash against his 1996 single “They Don’t Care About Us,” in which he uses anti-Semitic slurs as a means of conveying his stance against discrimination and racial violence. At one point, he even responded to the criticism by telling Diane Sawyer in an interview, “It’s not anti-Semitic because I’m not a racist person.”\n\nHe changed his mind later, however, and rerecorded the offending lyrics. Some versions of the song — including the one used in both of its music videos — kept in the original words, but feature loud sound effects layered over the slurs to make them inaudible.\n\nListen to “They Don’t Care About Us” here."
