        "text": "Flaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids and has been shown to have several health benefits, such as reduced blood pressure and improved regularity. Just 1 or 2 servings a day can be beneficial.\n\nFlax seeds are known for their many health benefits, which include providing a hearty dose of protein and fiber, reducing appetite and aiding in weight control (1, 2).\n\nGiven their stellar nutrient profile, it’s no wonder that flaxseed oil is also jam-packed with similar health benefits.\n\nFlaxseed oil, also known as flax oil or linseed oil, is made from flax seeds that have been ground and pressed to release their natural oil.\n\nThis health-promoting oil has a wide variety of uses, ranging from cooking to skin care.\n\nThis article will explore some of the top benefits of flaxseed oil and a few simple ways to use it.\n\nMuch like flax seeds, flaxseed oil is loaded with heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids.\n\nSpecifically, flaxseed oil contains alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), a form of omega-3 fatty acid that is only converted in small amounts to active forms of omega-3, like EPA and DHA (3, 4).\n\nIf you aren’t getting enough DHA and EPA in your diet, most guidelines recommend at least 1,600 mg of ALA omega-3 fatty acids daily for men and 1,100 mg for women (5).\n\nJust one tablespoon of flaxseed oil can meet and exceed your daily ALA needs (3).\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential to health and have been associated with benefits like reduced inflammation, improved heart health and protection for the brain against aging (6, 7, 8).\n\nIf you aren’t taking fish oil or getting one to two servings of fatty fish in your diet each week, flaxseed oil may be a good solution to help supplement your diet with the omega-3 fatty acids you need.\n\nAlthough the current research is limited to test-tube and animal studies, there is some evidence that flaxseed oil may help reduce the growth of cancer cells.\n\nIn a 2015 animal study, mice were given 0.3 ml of flaxseed oil for 40 days. It was found to prevent the spread of cancer and the growth of lung tumors (9).\n\nIn an older small animal study, flaxseed oil was shown to block the formation of colon cancer in rats (10).\n\nFurthermore, test-tube studies have produced similar findings, with several studies showing that flaxseed oil reduced the growth of breast cancer cells (11, 12).\n\nStill, while these findings are promising, more research is needed to determine how these results may translate to humans.\n\nSeveral studies have found that flaxseed oil could benefit heart health.\n\nOne study in 59 people compared the effects of flaxseed oil to those of safflower oil, a type of oil high in omega-6 fatty acids.\n\nIn this study, supplementing with one tablespoon (15 ml) of flaxseed oil for 12 weeks led to significantly lower blood pressure levels than supplementing with safflower oil (13).\n\nHigh blood pressure can harm heart health, as it places extra strain on the heart, forcing it to work harder.\n\nFlaxseed oil may also improve the elasticity of the arteries. Both aging and increased blood pressure are generally linked to decreases in elasticity (14).\n\nThese benefits are likely due to the high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids in flaxseed oil, as supplementing with it has been shown to significantly increase the amount of omega-3s in the blood (15).\n\nWhat’s more, numerous studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids improve heart health, with benefits such as reduced inflammation and lower blood pressure (16, 17).\n\nFlaxseed oil may be effective at treating both constipation and diarrhea.\n\nA recent animal study showed that flaxseed oil acted as a laxative to promote regularity, all while acting as an antidiarrheal agent (18).\n\nAnother study gave 50 constipated patients on hemodialysis either flaxseed oil, olive oil or mineral oil.\n\nAfter four weeks, flaxseed oil increased the frequency of bowel movements and improved stool consistency. Also, it was found to be as effective as both olive oil and mineral oil (19).\n\nHowever, research on the effects of flaxseed oil on constipation and diarrhea is currently limited to animal studies and studies on people with specific conditions.\n\nAdditional studies are needed to evaluate its effectiveness in the general population.\n\nFlaxseed oil may also help enhance skin health.\n\nOne small study had 13 women supplement with flaxseed oil for 12 weeks. At the end of the study, they experienced improvements in skin smoothness and hydration, while skin sensitivity to irritation and roughness had decreased (20).\n\nA recent animal study showed that flaxseed oil had similar positive results.\n\nMice with dermatitis were given flaxseed oil for three weeks. The oil was shown to decrease symptoms of atopic dermatitis, such as redness, swelling and itching (21).\n\nHowever, no studies have looked at the benefits of applying flaxseed oil to the skin of people. Nevertheless, there are numerous anecdotal reports of improvements in smoothness and reduced irritation after applying flaxseed oil.\n\nThanks to its omega-3 fatty acid content, some research shows that flaxseed oil may help reduce inflammation in certain populations.\n\nHowever, one analysis of 20 studies showed that flaxseed oil did not have an effect on inflammation in the general population.\n\nNevertheless, it significantly reduced levels of C-reactive protein, a marker used to measure inflammation, in obese people (22).\n\nAn animal study also found that flaxseed oil has potent anti-inflammatory properties (23).\n\nSome studies indicate that flaxseed oil’s anti-inflammatory effects are equivalent to those of olive oil.\n\nFor example, one study in 37 people showed that flaxseed oil supplements didn’t affect any inflammatory markers in healthy, normal-weight adults, compared to olive oil (24).\n\nWhile it seems that flaxseed oil may affect people differently, more research is needed to determine its effects on inflammation for the general population.\n\nOne of the best things about flaxseed oil is its versatility. For starters, it can easily be swapped for other types of oil in salad dressings, dips and sauces.\n\nYou can also add one serving (one tablespoon or 15 ml) into smoothies or shakes to add some flaxseed oil into your diet with minimal effort.\n\nKeep in mind that flaxseed oil should not be used for cooking, as it does not have a high smoke point and can form harmful compounds when exposed to high heat (25).\n\nIn addition to being used in food, flaxseed oil can be applied to the skin to enhance skin health and increase skin moisture.\n\nAlternatively, some people use flaxseed oil as a hair mask to promote growth and shine.\n\nFlaxseed oil is high in omega-3 fatty acids and has been shown to have several health benefits, such as reduced blood pressure and improved regularity.\n\nWhat’s more, flaxseed oil can be used in a variety of ways. It can be used as a replacement for other types of oils, added to foods or applied to your skin and hair.\n\nIncluding just one or two servings of flaxseed oil in your daily routine is easy and could have numerous benefits for your overall health."
