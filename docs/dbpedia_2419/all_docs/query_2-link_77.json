This is a member of the flax family.\n\nHabitat\n\nBlue Flax grows in well drained prairies, meadows and the breaks. You can find them in Bryce Canyon along most trails, in open fields and among short shrubs.\n\nPlant Lore\n\nNative Americans consumed the seeds for their flavor and nutrients. A tea made from the stems and leaves was used to treat various medical problems such as eye infections, stomach disorders, and swellings. Livestock exhibits a state of drowsiness when feeding on Blue Flax. Blue Flax was used by many Native American tribes in making strong rope. Today a cultivated flax is still grown for its \"linen\" fiber and \"linseed oil\".\n\nFurther Reading\n\nBuchanan, Hayle 1992. Wildflowers of Southwestern Utah.
