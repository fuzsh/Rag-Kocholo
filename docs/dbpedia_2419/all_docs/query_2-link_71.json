        "text": "This 100gsm non-woven flax mat is the lightest of our four non-woven mats. Non-woven matt is particular suited to high volume press moulding, particularly for components with relatively flat geometry, such as parcel shelves and door liners.\n\nAbout Flax Fibre\n\nFlax fibre is environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional composite reinforcements such as glass fibre.\n\nAlthough flax fibre offers lower overall strength and stiffness compared to reinforcements such as glass fibre, it does offer particular advantages in vibration damping and sound absorption, along with adequate mechanical properties and a natural aesthetic to complement its environmental credentials.\n\nHow to Process\n\nFlax fibre can be processed in a similar way to most dry composite reinforcements including glass or carbon fibre reinforcement and is suitable for use with a wide variety of resins such as epoxy, vinylester and polyester resin, including more sustainable or environmentally friendly synthetic and bio-based systems. Flax reinforcement can be used on its own or in conjunction with other types of reinforcement, including glass or carbon, to achieve the desired properties or appearance.\n\nDry flax fibre can be laminated using a range processes including hand layup, vacuum bagged hand layup, resin transfer moulding (RTM), resin infusion and matched tool/press moulding.\n\nTypical Uses\n\nFlax reinforcement is most typically used in applications with a focus on environmental sustainability, in particular products like canoes, kayaks, paddle boards, furniture, and leisure products designed for environmentally conscious consumers. When used without a coloured paint or gelcoat, flax fibre has a low-key, natural appearance, perfectly in keeping with homes, workspaces and lifestyles of this growing market.\n\nFlax fibre is also used in mass-market applications for its vibration absorption and sound deadening properties such as parcel shelves and door liners for the automotive sector.\n\nFurniture, architectural mouldings, and panels\n\nParcel shelves, door liners\n\nSports and leisure equipment\n\nBio Resins\n\nTo support our range of natural fibres, Easy Composites has sourced a range of bio epoxy resins which use plant derived content from sustainable sources to lower environmental impact without compromising on performance. They are an ideal match for use with these flax fibres. We have our LB2 bio derived epoxy laminating resin which you can find here: LB2 Epoxy Laminating Bio Resin and our IB2 Infusion grade epoxy resin here: IB2 Epoxy Infusion Bio Resin.\n\nHow to Buy\n\nThis 100g non-woven mat is 480mm (18\") wide and the fabric is sold by the linear metre. Simply enter the qty according to the number of linear metres you want to buy; the fabric will be supplied in one continuous length.\n\nThe unit price shown is for 1 linear metre but volume discounts automatically apply for larger quantities of fabric.\n\nPlease note: When ordering quantities of less than 5m, the flax will be supplied carefully folded and bagged. Flax is a flexible and resilient material and is not damaged by folding in this way but if you want to ensure the material is supplied on a roll, please order a minimum of 5m.\n\nAbout Eco-Technilin"
