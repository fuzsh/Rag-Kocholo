        "text": "I have been using your unsweetened flax refrigerated milk for almost a year and I love it! Best non-dairy with reasonable calorie substitute I’ve found, and I’ve tried a lot. It’s now the only PB milk in my frig so I use it for cooking, protein shakes and in my coffee and tea. Thank you for this great product! I just found out you sell it shelf stable so I’ll be ordering that too. Keep up the great work!\n\nI recently found out I can’t eat dairy, gluten, eggs and a long list of things I love. I’m in my early 50s and am conscious of getting enough protein. With no Greek yogurt or eggs as an option now, I struggle with what to eat for breakfast. I use to use almond milk as I gave up cow’s milk a few years ago (still ate yogurt, cottage cheese) but now they I can’t eat my typical protein sources I was looking for another way to get some in. I happened to see this in Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. I love flax so I knew I’d probs lay like the taste. It’s DELICIOUS. Consistency isn’t watery. Taste is mild and a bit sweet/nutty. I love it! And I love it’s got omegas in it too!\n\nBy far the best alternative milk i have tried. I started using it because of milk intolerance. So glad i did. Only one problem not all food stores carry it. So when I buy it I must purchase large quantities at a time. Spending $25.00 at a time. I would recommend this product."
