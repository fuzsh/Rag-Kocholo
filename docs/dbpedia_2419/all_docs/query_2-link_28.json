        "text": "Overview\n\nFlaxseed (Linum usitatissimum) and flaxseed oil, which comes from flaxseed, are rich sources of the essential fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid â€” a heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acid. Flaxseed is high in soluble fiber and in lignans, which contain phytoestrogens. Similar to the hormone estrogen, phytoestrogens might have anti-cancer properties. Flaxseed oil doesn't have these phytoestrogens.\n\nFlaxseed can be used whole or crushed, or in a powder form as meal or flour. Flaxseed oil is available in liquid and capsule form.\n\nPeople use flaxseed and flaxseed oil to reduce cholesterol and blood sugar and treat digestive conditions. Some people also take flaxseed to treat inflammatory diseases.\n\nWhat the research says\n\nResearch on the use of flaxseed and flaxseed oil for specific conditions shows:\n\nHeart disease. Some studies suggest that alpha-linolenic acid, which is found in flaxseed and flaxseed oil, might benefit people with heart disease. Early research also suggests that flaxseed might help lower high blood pressure, which plays a role in heart disease.\n\nCholesterol levels. Several studies show that taking flaxseed daily can reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or \"bad\") cholesterol levels. However, other studies aren't as favorable.\n\nDiabetes. Taking flaxseed might lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. However, the same results haven't been found for flaxseed oil.\n\nMenopausal symptoms. Results have been mixed when it comes to use of flaxseed and the treatment of menopausal symptoms.\n\nOur take\n\nGenerally safe\n\nWhen used in combination with daily exercise and a low cholesterol diet, flaxseed might help control cholesterol levels. Flaxseed might also be helpful for managing diabetes and lowering the risk of heart disease.\n\nSafety and side effects\n\nWhen taken in recommended amounts, flaxseed and flaxseed oil are generally safe to use. However, when taken in large amounts and with too little water, flaxseed can cause:\n\nBloating\n\nGas\n\nDiarrhea\n\nAvoid use of flaxseed and flaxseed oil during pregnancy.\n\nOccasionally, using flaxseed or flaxseed oil causes an allergic reaction.\n\nDon't eat raw or unripe flaxseeds.\n\nBecause flaxseed oil might decrease blood clotting, stop using flaxseed oil two weeks before having elective surgery.\n\nThe evidence is mixed as to whether flaxseed or flaxseed oil has any effect on the prostate or the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nInteractions\n\nPossible interactions include:"
