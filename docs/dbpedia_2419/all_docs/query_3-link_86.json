        "text": "Long Island's environment and economy are severely threatened by rapidly declining water quality and new solutions are needed to effectively address this problem. Existing technology is currently incapable of reversing this trend as complex and fragmented market conditions have stymied advances in innovation for decades.\n\nThe Center for Clean Water Technology is designed to bridge these science and technology gaps through a unique approach; facilitating concerted efforts between university and research institutions, regulatory agencies and private sector resources.\n\nFunded by New York State with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Center’s focus is three-fold:\n\nFocus on strategic research to inform refinements to existing technology\n\nDevelop novel and affordable approaches for nutrient and contaminant removal or reuse.\n\nDevelop collaborations to propel existing businesses, and inspire and support entrepreneurship\n\nA central premise of the Center is the recognition that water quality degradation is a problem that is prevalent nationwide and in communities across the globe, making the scientific and technology advancements that result from its collaborations marketable to other areas.\n\nIn addition to developing solutions for the region’s pressing environmental crisis, the Center is dedicated to attracting industry support to the area, further positioning New York as a leading hub for water technology development.\n\nThe Southampton Marine Sciences Center is a 15,000-square foot, two-story facility located on its Southampton campus. Already home to cutting edge and internationally recognized research on harmful algal blooms, ocean acidification, seagrasses, shellfish, and ocean acoustics, this new facility has greatly expand the research capabilities of SoMAS in Southampton. These expanded abilities ultimately benefit Long Island and its coastal ecosystems as a majority of the research in Southampton focuses on our local bays, harbors, and estuaries.\n\nThe central feature of the new facility is a computerized, state-of the-art 2,500-square-foot indoor seawater lab, which is capable of supplying three different seawater scenarios; ambient, temperature control and a closed recirculation system. The ambient seawater line allows researchers to mimic the seasonal temperature changes of Shinnecock Bay by pulling water directly from the bay to supply various research tanks. With temperatures fluctuating between approximately 1°C during the winter and 26°C in the summer, a temperature control line is able to instantly heat or chill incoming water to any temperature desired by a researcher. For research requiring very specific water quality parameters, the closed recirculation system allows for greater control of not only temperature, but salinity and various other aspects of the water chemistry.\n\nIn addition to this impressive indoor wet lab, the Marine Sciences Center has an additional 2,400 sq. ft. of outdoor wet lab space that can accommodate larger experimental chambers or those experiments that would benefit from a natural sunlight cycle.\n\nResearch and education go hand in hand at the Marine Sciences Center. A classroom, analytical lab, and a prep lab that supports two teaching laboratories not only enhance one of the nation’s top ranked marine science graduate programs, but strengthens the increased growth of Stony Brook Southampton’s undergraduate Semester by the Sea program. A large entrance lobby, hallway with a view of the wet lab and conference room allow Stony Brook Southampton to bring awareness of our marine environment to the local community through lectures, tours, and trips aboard our research vessels.\n\nTo keep with Stony Brook Southampton’s environmental mission, the Marine Sciences Center was constructed with many “green” features. Sustainable design innovations such as energy recovery of ventilation air, day lighting of all normally occupied spaces, a low static pressure ductwork system, high-efficiency lighting and a super-insulated exterior wall assembly all work together to bring a silver LEED rating to the Marine Sciences Center.\n\nThe Marine Sciences Center is also home to a fleet of research vessels including the R/V Paumanok, a 44-foot ocean-going vessel used for coastal research, the R/V Shinnecock, a 35-foot platform craft used for sampling local bays and estuaries and the R/V Peconic, a 45-foot catamaran, houseboat-style vessel for operation in protected bays and rivers. Many small, outboard crafts equipped with winches, davits and metering wheels for sampling instruments such as oxygen analyzers, CTD-probes, and trawls.\n\nThe Nano-RAMAN Molecular Imaging Laboratory (NARMIL) hosted by the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences (SoMAS) was established in January 2014 through the NSF Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program. The facility, located in Endeavour Hall 170, supports research in marine, atmospheric, environmental, biological, chemical, geological, materials sciences, and biomedical engineering, but is open to other applications as well. The lab provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and expertise for analyses of single cells, aerosols, natural and engineered surfaces, minerals, biofilms, thin films, and novel synthetic materials. The lab’s vision is to offer unique analytical solutions to chronic limitations experienced in many research areas, to enable transformative discoveries, and to educate the next generation of scientists.\n\nNARMIL is home to a Renishaw inVia Confocal Raman Microspectrometer and a Bruker Innova Atomic Force Microscope. These instruments can be operated independently or coupled for co-localization and Tip-enhanced Raman Scattering (TERS) and offer high performance, reliability, modular design, and user-friendly operating systems. The entire system is mounted on a floating 5’x8′ Newport INTEGRITY 3 vibration isolation table.\n\nThe Boathouse is located on the South Campus of Stony Brook University at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences adjacent to Discovery Hall.\n\nBuilt in 1990, the Boathouse is an experimental building made from municipal solid waste (MSW) ash blocks. The building is currently a single-story structure.\n\n1400 tons of municipal solid waste were combusted to produce the ash used in the fabrication of the blocks. This amount of municipal solid waste represents the amount of municipal solid waste generated by the Town of Brookhaven in two days. 14000 blocks were used to construct the Boathouse.\n\nAir quality within the Boathouse was monitored over a 5 year period in cooperation with the NYS Department of Health and the data suggested the municipal solid waste ash boathouse had better air quality than some of the other buildings on campus that were also tested.\n\nThe Boathouse was certified by Ripley’s Believe it or Not! for the contribution of Incinerated Garbage Blocks on November 20, 1991."
