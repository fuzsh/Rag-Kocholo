The interactive effects between the stratospheric ozone layer, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and climate change are presented within the framework of the Montreal Protocol and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. We address how these global environmental changes affect the atmosphere and air quality; human health; terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; biogeochemical cycles; and materials used in outdoor construction, solar energy technologies, and fabrics. In many cases, there is a growing influence from changes in seasonality and extreme events due to climate change. Additionally, we assess the transmission and environmental effects of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, in the context of linkages with solar UV radiation and the Montreal Protocol.\n\nElectronic supplementary material\n\nThe online version of this article (10.1007/s43630-020-00001-x) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe contribution of the Montreal Protocol to several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is addressed in this EEAP 2020 Update Assessment. The SDGs and their targets are provided for a number of sustainability themes, including climate change, air and water quality, biodiversity and ecosystems, contaminants and materials, and human health (Fig. ). Due to the Montreal Protocol, large increases in UV-B (280–315 nm) radiation have been avoided and global warming reduced through regulation of the ozone depleting substances, most of which are also potent greenhouse gases. The resulting changes in stratospheric ozone, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and climate are evaluated regarding the effects on humans and the environment. Some of the potential consequences are assessed of recent unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic (Sect. 9), and unprecedented increases in UV radiation over the Arctic in 2020 due to stratospheric ozone depletion (Sect. 2).\n\nStratospheric ozone, UV radiation, and climate interactions\n\nThis section provides an update since our last assessments [1, 2] on recent findings of the interactions between stratospheric ozone, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and climate, and discusses the impact of the Montreal Protocol on these processes. In addition to protecting life on Earth from harmful UV radiation, the Montreal Protocol is also highly effective in mitigating global warming because most of the ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) regulated by the Montreal Protocol are also potent greenhouse gases (GHGs). According to new quantitative estimates, the implementation of the Montreal Protocol has prevented between a quarter and a third of the global mean increases in air temperature, depending on the time period considered. The stratospheric ozone hole over Antarctica continues to recover, with 2019 being one of the years with the lowest spring-time UV index measured at the South Pole since the start of measurements in 1991. In the Arctic, springtime episodes of stratospheric ozone depletion, identified first in the early 2010s, continue to occur. The last episode in the spring of 2020 led to the largest ozone loss measured to date and resulted in UV indices that were twice as high as typical at several Arctic locations. Additional topics discussed include: trends in measured surface UV radiation from ground-based and satellite data that are driven by changes in total ozone, aerosols and clouds; effects of Antarctic ozone depletion on the climate in the Southern Hemisphere and linkages to Australian wildfires; and projections of surface UV-B radiation for the second half of the twenty-first century. This section contributes to SDG 11.5, 12.4, 13.2, and 17.14 by providing further evidence that the Montreal Protocol has protected the climate and the stratospheric ozone layer.\n\nAdditional evidence has accumulated that the Montreal Protocol is reducing global warming\n\nMost ODSs controlled by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments are also potent GHGs with global warming potentials (GWPs) that are substantially larger than those of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Over the second half of the twentieth century, ODSs were the second-most important GHG with approximately one third of the radiative forcing of CO2 [3]. The climate effects of ODSs were anticipated during the establishment of the Montreal Protocol [4], and their impact on climate has been continuously assessed since the ratification of the Montreal Protocol [5–7].\n\nBuilding on earlier work [6, 8, 9], Goyal et al. [10] recently re-evaluated the amount of global warming that has been avoided due to the Montreal Protocol. This new study is based on a coupled atmosphere–ocean–land–sea–ice model and took into account the effect of the Montreal Protocol on emissions of ODSs that have contributed the most to stratospheric chlorine concentrations, namely the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) CFC-11 and CFC-12, as well as the CFC substitutes HCFC-22, HFC-125 and HFC-134a. Increases in GHG concentrations (including the concentrations of these ODSs) were described in this model by the Representative Concentration Pathway1 (RCP) [11] that leads to the strongest warming at Earth’s surface (RCP 8.5). The study concluded that, as of 2019, implementation of the Montreal Protocol has prevented warming ranging between 0.5 °C and 1.0 °C over large mid-latitude regions of land, particularly parts of Africa, North America and Eurasia. As much as 1.1 °C warming has been avoided over parts of the Arctic. In addition to quantifying benefits from the Montreal Protocol that have already been realised, Goyal et al. [10] also assessed the Montreal Protocol’s effect on the future climate for the RCP 8.5 scenario. Projected temperature increases that are likely to be averted by 2050 are on the order of 1.5 °C to 2 °C over most extrapolar land areas, and between 3 °C and 4 °C over the Arctic. Averaged over the globe (including the oceans), about 1 °C warming would be avoided by 2050, which corresponds to about 25% mitigation of global warming expected from all GHGs. The Montreal Protocol is contributing to SDG 13.2 by reducing global warming.\n\nThese benefits of the Montreal Protocol were corroborated by Polvani et al. [3] using calculations with a different climate model. When all known forcings (GHGs, ODSs) were taken into account, the simulated global-mean air temperature at the surface increased by 0.59 °C between 1955 and 2005. When the concentrations of ODSs and atmospheric ozone were fixed at 1955 levels, the resulting temperature change was only 0.39 °C. Hence, ODSs were responsible for about one-third of global warming over this period. Similar calculations for the Arctic (60–90° N) resulted in temperature changes of 1.59 °C and 0.82 °C for the two scenarios, respectively, suggesting that ODSs contributed about one-half to the warming at the Arctic surface. Changes in Arctic temperatures have a direct effect on sea ice loss. Polvani et al. [3] concluded that ODSs contributed one-half of the forced Arctic sea-ice loss in the latter half of the twentieth century (Sect. 5.5).\n\nLike previous assessments [6, 8, 9], the studies by Goyal et al. [10] and Polvani et al. [3] took into account that ozone is also a GHG. Depletion of stratospheric ozone resulting from ODSs has therefore led to a small radiative cooling at the surface. However, both studies concluded that the magnitude of surface warming by ODSs far outweighs the cooling effect from ozone depletion. In a more recent multi-model study, Morgenstern et al. [12] estimated a larger cooling effect from ozone depletion than modelled by Goyal et al. [10] and Polvani et al. [3]. While these new calculations are consistent within error bars with previously published values [5], the larger cooling effect determined by Morgenstern et al. [12] means that the effect from phasing out ODSs would be smaller than summarised above. The effect of ODSs on climate is an area of active research and it is expected that refinements to climate chemistry models, e.g., by including compounding factors such as tropospheric ozone pollution, will further reduce uncertainties in estimating the effect of the Montreal Protocol on surface temperature.\n\nIn summary, these studies provide further evidence that the Montreal Protocol is not just vital for the recovery of the ozone layer, but also for the reduction of global warming. The Montreal Protocol has thus been the most successful international treaty to date to mitigate anthropogenic climate change resulting from the increase of GHGs.\n\nThe recently reported unexpected slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012 [13], which is partially caused by new emissions from eastern China [14], not only has the potential to delay the recovery of the ozone layer [15] but could also have a negative effect on future climate because the GWP of CFC-11 is 4660 times that of CO2 [5, 16]. So far, these unexpected CFC-11 emissions have not been large enough to significantly delay the closing of the ozone hole [17]. It is also unlikely that these emissions will have an important effect on global temperatures. However, the cumulative warming effect of ODSs, including carbon tetrachloride, CFCs-11, 12, 113, 113a, 114, and 115, Halons, HCFCs, HFCs, and N2O, is still significant [17]. Tightening the regulations concerning these substances by amending the Montreal Protocol could partially offset the effect of future CO2 emissions and reduce global warming.\n\nThe stratospheric ozone hole over Antarctica continues to recover\n\nChanges in the depth and extent of the Antarctic ozone hole have recently been analysed based on trends in four representative metrics describing the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion [18]. The four metrics are: the maximum 15-day averaged ozone hole area, the minimum 15-day averaged total ozone column (TOC), the integrated ozone deficit, and the duration of the ozone hole. After adjusting for the effect of stratospheric temperature on ozone depletion, trends in all four metrics over the 2001–2017 period are statistically significant (95% confidence level (CL)) and point in the direction of increasing ozone. These results are supported by Kramarova et al. [19] who calculated significant positive trends in TOC over a slightly longer period (1999–2019) for two metrics: the mean TOC for September averaged over the 60°–90° S latitude range (trend of 22.3 Dobson Units (DU) per decade, 94% CL) and the Antarctic minimum TOC (trend of 17.9 DU per decade, > 99% CL). These results confirm the conclusion from last assessments [7] that the Antarctic ozone hole is now in the process of recovery.\n\nThe 2019 Antarctic ozone hole was the smallest on record and led to unusually small UV indices measured in Antarctica\n\nSigns of the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer over Antarctica (Sect. 2.2) are consistent with the decrease in the concentration of ODSs regulated by the Montreal Protocol. Assuming continued adherence to the Montreal Protocol, concentrations of ODSs are projected to decline further, eventually resulting in the disappearance of the annually recurring ozone hole in the second half of the twenty-first century [7]. Until that time, large year-to-year variations in the various ozone hole metrics are expected because of the sensitivity of chemical ozone destruction to temperatures in the lower stratosphere in the presence of ODSs as explained below.\n\nRecord-high temperatures in the stratospheric polar vortex over Antarctica during September and October 2019 led to the smallest Antarctic ozone hole recorded since the early 1980s [19]. Averaged over the polar cap (60°–90° S), the average TOC in that period was the highest over the last 40 years, and the minimum TOC for September 2019 was the highest observed since 1988. For the months of September, October, and November, the polar cap average TOC was higher by 29%, 28%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the mean of the 2008–2018 period [20].\n\nThe weak ozone hole was caused by abnormally strong planetary wave activity originating in the subtropical Pacific Ocean east of Australia and over the eastern South Pacific [19, 21, 22]. These waves weakened the stratospheric polar vortex, which led to a warming of the polar stratosphere, starting in mid-August [23]. The resulting above-normal temperature in the lower stratosphere reduced the occurrence of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which provide surfaces for heterogeneous chemical reactions involving chlorine that destroy ozone catalytically. The volume of PSCs dropped to almost zero by mid-September and the chemical processes leading to ozone depletion were therefore suppressed far earlier than usual.\n\nThe record-high TOC observed over Antarctica during the spring of 2019 led to unusually low UV indices (a commonly used measure to quantify the portion of the UV spectrum that causes sunburn) measured at the South Pole (90° S) and Arrival Heights (78° S), a research station overlooking McMurdo Sound. Figure shows the measured UV index at the two sites for 1 September through 31 December 2019 compared with the mean and range calculated from measurements of the years 1991–2018. Between October and mid-November 2019, the UV index at the South Pole was at the minimum of the historical (1991–2018) range, and remained close to this minimum between mid-November and January. At Arrival Heights, the UV index in 2019 was close to the minimum between September and mid-November, and stayed below the long-term mean until mid-December, with the exception of two short periods. Similarly, reduced UV indices compared to the observational record, which began in 2007 [24], were observed from September to December at the Australian Antarctic research stations of Casey (66° S), Mawson (68° S) and Davis (69° S). Data from each of these sites confirm that UV-B radiation in Antarctica is mainly controlled by TOC, in contrast to sites at lower latitudes where the effects of clouds and aerosols are dominant (Sect. 2.7).\n\nNew evidence confirms a strong link between Antarctic stratospheric ozone depletion and the climate of the Southern Hemisphere\n\nStratospheric ozone depletion over Antarctica has led to changes in the summertime tropospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere since the latter decades of the twentieth century. These changes have included the poleward shift in the belt of winds at mid-latitudes, a trend towards lower surface pressure over Antarctica compared with mid-latitudes (i.e., a more positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode or SAM2) and concomitant changes in temperature and precipitation patterns [28–36]. Recent work has further highlighted these links, and has shown evidence of changes due to stratospheric ozone recovery.\n\nBanerjee et al. [37] used meteorological reanalyses and simulations with a single climate model to show that circulation changes induced by stratospheric ozone loss in the 1980s and 1990s halted or partly reversed around the end of the twentieth century. Furthermore, they find that these changes are primarily the result of the reversal in the severity of Antarctic ozone depletion due to actions prompted by the Montreal Protocol to decrease emissions of ODSs. Hence, the Montreal Protocol has contributed to SDG 11.5 by returning circulation patterns to their natural state.\n\nUsing observations and single-model climate simulations, Damiani et al. [38] found that the link between Antarctic ozone loss in spring and changes in annual precipitation has strengthened in the last few decades. While they point out that the amount of Antarctic ozone loss in any given year relates to the strength of downward coupling from the stratosphere to the surface, they find that the increase in stratospheric ozone depletion led to a tendency towards drier conditions in Chile and more precipitation in parts of Australia, and to a lesser extent in South America. Hence, springtime ozone anomalies in Antarctica can be used as a predictor of subsequent summer precipitation for South America and Australia. A similar link between ozone anomalies and precipitation has also been established for Antarctica [34].\n\nThe early break-up of the stratospheric polar vortex over Antarctica in 2019 has likely exacerbated the Australian wildfires of 2019/2020, but the contribution of ozone depletion is still unknown\n\nAccording to a recent study, weakening and warming of the stratospheric polar vortex over Antarctica substantially increased the likelihood of hot and dry weather extremes across subtropical eastern Australia from austral spring to early summer [39]. The unusual warming of the Antarctic stratosphere in September 2019 (Sect. 2.3) may have exacerbated the extremely dry conditions observed during the summer of 2019/20 in the Southern Hemisphere [23, 40–44], leading to devastating wildfires in Australia [45]. Specifically, the stratospheric warming event influenced the troposphere from mid-October 2019 by forcing the SAM from a positive phase to a negative phase, which enhanced anomalously hot and dry conditions in eastern Australia [44]. We emphasise that the stratospheric warming event, the change in the phase of the SAM, and the small ozone hole in the spring of 2019 are all attributable to unusually strong planetary-scale wave activity in 2019. There have been no specific studies for this event addressing the question of whether the presence of ODSs in the atmosphere contributed to the properties of these waves or influenced the coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere. Hence, the role of the Montreal Protocol in this extreme weather event is still undetermined.\n\nThe fires that occurred in eastern Australia in December 2019 and January in 2020 affected over 10 million hectares and caused unprecedented atmospheric effects throughout the Southern Hemisphere [46–49]. Superheated air from the fires produced large-scale pyrocumulonimbus clouds, forcing smoke into the lower stratosphere, from where it rose to heights up to 35 km [49]. The rising plumes carried ozone-poor tropospheric air into the stratosphere, which produced localised depletion of ozone, with the TOC reduced by up to 100 DU or in excess of one third of the typical TOC [46, 49]. The rising air also locally increased the water vapour mixing ratio in the lower stratosphere at southern mid-latitudes [49] where it might be expected to deplete ozone through enhanced heterogeneous reactions [50]. The smoke also increased aerosol absorption in isolated areas [48, 49]. It can be anticipated that the plume-induced ozone dilution and depletion increased UV radiation at the surface while smoke and aerosols resulting from the fires led to decreased UV radiation. However, the combined effects of these two opposing mechanisms on UV radiation in the affected areas are not yet known, as measurements of UV radiation from these areas have not yet been reported.\n\nUsing future projections of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) for a range of emissions scenarios, Bracegirdle et al. [51] have updated earlier assessments (e.g., [52]) of changes in surface temperature, precipitation and the zonal wind speed over Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. In the first half of the twenty-first century, stratospheric ozone recovery will shift the westerly jet equatorward, but this shift will be partially cancelled depending on the GHG scenario (defined by Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP3) [53]) that eventuates: for low emissions scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5) there is no significant change, but for high emissions scenarios (e.g., SSP5-8.5), there is a tendency for further poleward progression and strengthening of the jet. During the second half of the twenty-first century, ozone forcing is expected to weaken while forcing by GHG will strengthen, resulting in a general southward shift of the westerly jet for all scenarios. Temperature and precipitation patterns over the Southern Ocean will regionally respond to the jet location, but for the interior of Antarctica, changes will be dominated by increases in GHG irrespective of the location of the jet.\n\nUnprecedented increases in Arctic solar ultraviolet radiation were caused by exceptionally large stratospheric ozone depletion in 2020\n\nTotal ozone columns averaged over the northern polar cap (63°–90° N) were exceptionally low in late winter and early spring (February–April) of 2020 [54]. The average TOC in 2020 for this 3-month period was 340 DU, which is 100 DU below the mean of measurements between 1979 and 2019 and the lowest value since the start of satellite measurements in 1979. The low TOCs in 2020 were partially caused by a strong and long-lived polar vortex, which provided ideal conditions for chemical ozone destruction to take place. Temperatures low enough to form PSCs within the vortex developed early in the season, and on average enclosed about a third of the vortex volume [54–58]. These conditions are unique in the ~ 40 years of measurements, making 2020 the year with the largest Arctic ozone loss on record. The occurrence of a small ozone hole with little ozone depletion over Antarctica (Sect. 2.3) and large ozone depletion over the Arctic within a 6-month period is a coincidence and cannot be attributed to a common cause.\n\nThe low TOC led to record-breaking anomalies in solar UV-B radiation over the Arctic measured by ground-based instruments at ten Arctic and subarctic locations and observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on NASA’s Aura satellite [59]. UV radiation anomalies were particularly large between early March and mid-April 2020. The UV indices measured in 2020 exceeded the historical (2005–2019) mean by up to 100%. At several locations in northern Canada and Scandinavia, historical means were surpassed by more than six standard deviations. However, absolute anomalies remained below 3 UV index units because the enhancements occurred during a period when the solar elevation at these Arctic locations is small.\n\nNew studies reported trends in solar UV radiation for many mid-latitude regions, confirming that changes in solar UV radiation during the last 20 years have generally been small and mostly caused by changes in cloud cover\n\nTrends in UV radiation were calculated from UV measurements for several European stations (Reading (51° N), Uccle (51° N), Thessaloniki (41° N), and Sodankylä (67° N)) [60]; Northern Eurasia (a region north of 40° N extending from Scandinavia to Siberia) [61]; and a site near the equator (Quito, Ecuador, 2,850 m above sea level) [62]. These new studies generally confirmed the conclusions from our last update assessment [1], i.e., changes in UV radiation during the last 20 years have been small (generally less than ca. 4% per decade) because the Montreal Protocol has prevented large decreases in TOC. For most locations outside the polar regions, long-term changes in UV-B radiation are mainly governed by variations in clouds, aerosols, and surface reflectivity, while changes in TOC are less important.\n\nResults from these ground-based measurements are corroborated by satellite data. Using observations from OMI, Herman et al. [63] showed that noon-time erythemal irradiance at 191 cities located between 60° N and 60° S has not significantly (95% CL) changed over the period 2005–2018. However, when data are averaged over 15° latitude bands, there are strong correlations between erythemal UV radiation and short- and long-term changes in clouds and absorbing aerosols, as well as inverse correlations with TOC. The largest changes in erythemal irradiance between 60° N and 60° S are caused by changes in cloud and aerosol transmission, and range between − 4 and 4% per decade.\n\nIn contrast to the situation in the tropics and the mid-latitudes, long-term changes of UV radiation in Antarctica continue to be dominated by changes in TOC. A new study [27] updated an earlier [64] analysis of trends in the UV index at three Antarctic sites: South Pole (90° S), Arrival Heights (78° S), and Palmer Station (65° S). At the South Pole (a site representative of the Antarctic Polar Plateau), significant (95% CL) decadal trends of − 3.9% and − 3.1% over the period 1996–2018 were calculated for January and February, respectively, which can mostly be explained by concomitant positive trends in TOC. At Arrival Heights, a significant (90% CL) trend in the UV index of − 3.3% per decade was calculated for summer and was attributed to a significant upward trend in TOC of 1.5% per decade for January plus the effect of changes in fast ice (i.e., sea ice fixed in place by land, grounded icebergs, or ice shelves) covering the sea adjacent to the instrument site. Thus, this study provides evidence that the UV index in Antarctica is starting to decrease during summer months. However, statistically significant reductions for spring (October and November), when the ozone hole leads to large UV index variability, were not detected. Trends for spring were also not apparent even when data from 2019—the year when an unusually small ozone hole was observed (Sect. 2.3)—were included.\n\nUV-B radiation at low and mid-latitudes is projected to increase in the second half of the twenty-first century due to less cloud cover resulting from increasing greenhouse gases\n\nSimulations with a chemistry climate model (EMAC) for the period 1960–2100 were used to derive trends in DNA-damaging radiation at four mid-latitude locations and one tropical high-altitude site [65]. DNA-damaging irradiance averaged over the five locations is projected to increase by 1.3% per decade between 2050 and 2100. To isolate the effect of GHGs on climate, one simulation assumed increasing GHGs according to RCP 6.0 and the second adopted constant GHGs at 1960 levels. No trend in total ozone was detected by the model after 2050, and the trend in DNA-damaging irradiance was attributed to a statistically significant (95% CL) decrease in cloud cover of − 1.4 per decade resulting from increasing GHGs. The study suggests that changes in UV-B irradiance at low- and mid-latitudes during the second half of the twenty-first century will be dominated by factors other than changes in stratospheric ozone [65]. However, these projections depend on the accurate description of clouds by climate models. Uncertainties in the modelling of clouds propagate to the projected changes in solar UV-B radiation.\n\nMeasurements of UV radiation from space with a new instrument have been validated and will continue data records started by legacy instruments\n\nMost estimates of the surface UV radiation from space have historically been based on NASA’s total ozone mapping spectrometers (TOMS), which are available up to 2006, and OMI (for data, see [66] and https://acdisc.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/). OMI measurements on the Aura satellite started in 2004 [67] and will likely be discontinued in a few years [1]. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite will provide space-based estimates of UV radiation for the future. TROPOMI observations of UV radiation have recently been compared with ground-based measurements at 25 sites [68]. For snow-free surface conditions, the median relative difference between measurements of the UV index by TROPOMI and these ground stations agreed within ± 10% and ± 5% at 18 and 10 sites, respectively. These differences are comparable to those reported for OMI [69, 70]. Larger differences were observed at locations with challenging conditions, such as mountainous areas or sites in the Arctic and Antarctic with variable snow cover. TROPOMI and OMI data agree with ground-based measurements within a similar range. A comprehensive comparison between OMI and TROPOMI surface UV products is planned [67] to ensure that there is no step-change in the time series of UV radiation measurements when transitioning from OMI to TROPOMI.\n\nHuman health\n\nBy mitigating increases in UV-B radiation reaching Earth’s surface, the Montreal Protocol has influenced human health, both directly and indirectly. Models estimate that a large number of skin cancers and cataracts have been avoided. Concern about ozone, and the international focus on methods to mitigate its loss, are also likely to have contributed to increased investment in sunscreen technology and promotion of strategies to reduce the harmful effects of over-exposure to the sun (SDG 13.3). However, it is important to note that sun exposure also has benefits for human health, and to date the effects of the Montreal Protocol on these are unclear. Below we describe new information about trends in skin cancer and the effects of exposure to UV radiation on human health; these should be considered in future modelling evaluations of the effects of the Montreal Protocol on human health.\n\nA new model has estimated the number of skin cancers and cataracts avoided due to implementation of the Montreal Protocol\n\nEstimates generated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency using the updated Atmospheric and Health Effects Framework (AHEF) model indicate that full implementation of the Montreal Protocol is expected to prevent 432 million cases of keratinocyte cancer and 11 million cases of melanoma in the United States for people born in the years 1890–2100 [71]; it is also expected to prevent 2.3 million deaths from skin cancer (predominantly melanoma, but also cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)), and 63 million cases of cataract. These numbers are greater than the previous 2015 estimates (328 million keratinocyte cancer cases; 10 million melanoma cases; 1.8 million skin cancer deaths; 33 million cataract cases) due to updated physico-chemical parameters, improved UV irradiance calculations, and updated population data.\n\nThe AHEF health effects model estimates the change in skin cancer incidence that would occur as a result of a relative change in the dose of UV radiation under different scenarios of emission of ozone-depleting substances, while assuming that sun-protection behaviours remain constant. The largest effects on incidence of skin cancer are estimated to occur in people born between 1960 and 1980 since these birth cohorts experienced the full period of stratospheric ozone depletion, and will also have received the largest cumulative lifetime dose of UV radiation. The model estimates that cohorts born in 2040 or later will not experience any excess incidence of skin cancer caused by the effects of ozone depletion.\n\nNew melanoma incidence data show that temporal trends differ by country, age, sex and anatomic site\n\nIn the United States, the incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma increased in adults of all ethnicities aged 40 years or older between 2001 and 2015 at an average annual percent change (AAPC) of 1.8% [72]. In non-Hispanic whites, the increase was more marked between 2001 and 2005 (AAPC 3.9%) than in the most recent time period, suggesting some plateauing of incidence rates (2005–2015, AAPC 1.7%) [73]. Significant declines in incidence in adolescents and young adults were observed for the period 2001 to 2015 (AAPC ranging from − 3.6% to − 5.4%) [72]. Compared with adults born around 1956, those born around 1991 had a 15% lower risk of melanoma [incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94] [73]. These patterns may be attributable to public health programs and/or broader societal changes, such as increasing indoor recreational activities facilitated by the advent of small personal computing devices.\n\nAn analysis of National Cancer Registry data from South Africa from 2005 to 2013 found an overall age-standardised incidence of melanoma (world standard population) of 2.7 per 100,000 people per year, but there was a marked difference between white (23.2 per 100,000) and black (0.5 per 100,000) populations [74]. In China, the incidence of melanoma increased from 1990 to 2017, with the greatest increase from 2006 to 2017 (AAPC 6.1%, 95% CI 5.6–6.6%) [75].\n\nData on the incidence of melanoma according to sex and body site for the period 1982–2015 for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark show that in the most recent decade (2005 to 2015) incidence increased for all countries except New Zealand and Denmark (Fig. ) [76]. Total melanoma incidence was higher in men than women in ‘new world’ populations (those more recently populated by people of European descent; United States whites, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) but not in ‘old world’ countries (United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark) [76]. The male to female incidence rate ratio varied with age. In all populations cutaneous melanomas were more common in women than in men in those aged < 45 years, mostly due to higher rates of melanoma on the lower limb in women. The opposite was true for people aged ≥ 70 years due to the higher incidence on the head and neck in men. These sex- and site-specific patterns most likely indicate combinations of sex differences in the anatomic distribution of naevi [77] and patterns of sun exposure. These differences may need to be considered in models to predict future melanoma risk.\n\nTrends in melanoma mortality differ by sex in most countries\n\nTrends in mortality from melanoma are driven by trends in incidence and screening practices, and by improved treatments. New information on melanoma mortality was reported for 31 countries, using data from the WHO Mortality Database, covering the time period from 1985 to 2015. An overall increase in mortality was reported for men in all countries, in contrast with stable or declining rates in women [78]. For the most recent time period (2013–2015), the median mortality rate was 2.6 deaths per 100,000 for men and 1.55 per 100,000 for women; the highest mortality rates were recorded for Australia and Norway for men, and Norway and Slovenia for women. The increase in most countries reflected increasing mortality rates in people aged 50 years or older; mortality rates were generally stable or declining in younger age groups. A separate report for Spain over the period 1982–2016 showed a similar trend, with mortality rates stabilising in men and women younger than 64 years from the mid-90s, while rates continued to rise in older age groups [79]. An analysis of data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [80] suggests that in Australia the mortality rates in men and women are declining, although this appears much more marked in men (Fig. ).\n\nImproved treatments for metastatic melanoma over the past decade are partly responsible for the declining mortality. Data from the United States (restricted to whites) have shown that the introduction of new systemic therapies was associated with a significant reduction in the melanoma mortality rate over the period 2013–2016 (AAPC − 6.2, 95% CI − 8.7 to − 3.7) [81].\n\nIn some European nations the incidence of keratinocyte cancers and pre-malignant cancers is continuing to increase, with differences according to sex and the anatomic site of the tumour\n\nA whole-of-population study in Iceland, based on registry data, reported that from 1981 to 2017 the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) increased 2.3-fold in men and 3.7-fold in women [82]. As a consequence of the greater increase in women, the incidence in women was 1.4 times higher than in men in the final 5 years of the study period (age-standardised incidence rates 83.1 and 59.9 tumours per 100,000, respectively), whereas at the beginning of the period, it was marginally lower in women (22.2/100,000) than in men (25.7/100,000). The lifetime risk increased from 3.2 to 10.1% in women and from 2.8% to 7.3% in men. The increase in incidence was highest for BCC on the trunk and legs; between 1981 and 1990 72% of BCCs were located on the head and neck in both men and women, whereas in 2009–2017 period this percentage had decreased to 57% for men and 49% for women. Given the observed incidence patterns, and the very low ambient UV radiation in Iceland, it is most likely that these changes are due to increased use of tanning beds and/or more frequent travel to sunny locations.\n\nIn the Netherlands, a study of SCC in situ found a marked increase in incidence between 1989 and 2017 that was more pronounced in women than in men [83]. In men, there was a sixfold increase in the age-standardised rate (European standard population) from 11.1 cases to 67.8 cases per 100,000 person years; in women there was a 7.7-fold increase from 9.3 to 71.7 per 100,000 person years. In men, the increase was greatest for lesions on the scalp and neck, whereas in women it was greatest for lesions on the trunk. The differences in behaviour that underlie these patterns emphasise the importance of considering sex differences when modelling the potential effects of the Montreal Protocol on human health.\n\nSkin cancer treatment is costly, and primary prevention is cost-effective\n\nThe introduction of new and costly systemic treatments for melanoma, combined with increased incidence of all skin cancer types, has resulted in a markedly increased economic burden of skin cancer in the Netherlands [84]. In 2017, skin cancer was the fourth most costly cancer to manage (€465 million). The total cost was 1.7 times higher than in 2007 (€278 million), and over this decade the cost of drugs increased from €0.7 million to €121 million because of the advent of costly immunotherapy used to treat advanced melanoma. By 2030 the costs are projected to reach €1.35 billion.\n\nIn Queensland (Australia), an area with very high ambient UV radiation [85], modelling showed that compared with annual clinical skin examinations (early detection), and no intervention, daily sunscreen use (prevention) resulted in fewer cases of melanoma and keratinocyte cancer, significantly lower costs associated with diagnosis and treatment, and small differences in life years saved (0.9%) and quality-adjusted life years gained (0.10%). While these findings may not generalise to settings with lower ambient UV radiation, they emphasise the value of increasing primary prevention behaviours in populations with high incidence of skin cancer.\n\nCommonly used drugs remain a cause of photodermatoses, and may increase skin cancer risk\n\nApproximately 5% of patients with photodermatosis who were referred to a photobiology unit had photosensitivity resulting from oral medication. While UV-A is the main contributing waveband, detailed in vivo assessment using monochromatic testing with wavelengths between 300 and 600 nm shows that exposure to UV-B radiation also contributes in a proportion of cases (14.5%) [86]. Many common medications cause acute photosensitivity, including thiazide diuretics, quinine, antibiotics, antidepressants, and anti-epileptics. New photosensitising drugs are emerging, including proton-pump inhibitors and statins [86]. An analysis of drugs dispensed between 2010 and 2017 in Germany and Austria found that of > 632 million (Germany) and > 113 million (Austria) drugs dispensed, almost 50% had photosensitising potential [87].\n\nThe risk that photosensitising drugs could induce skin cancer may represent a significant public health issue. The commonly prescribed diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, has emerged as a culprit in recent studies, leading the European Medicines Agency Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee to recommend that the product information be updated to include advice about the increased risk of keratinocyte cancer with hydrochlorothiazide use in Europe [88].\n\nEye disorders related to sun exposure continue to impose a considerable burden of disease\n\nExposing the eyes to UV radiation increases the risk of cataract, which remains the leading cause of vision loss world-wide. In 2015, cataract accounted for 35% of total blindness, with projections suggesting that this remains the case in 2020 [89–94]. Globally, the age-standardised DALY rate increased by 10% from 1990 to 2016 (to 88.3/100,000), although there was no increase in the last decade of this period [95].\n\nIn a population-based study of 9735 adults aged over 40 years in India, 33% were found to have cataract, with little difference between men and women. There was a strong association with lifetime effective sun exposure; the odds of cataract for those in the highest quintile was 9.4 times that in the lowest quintile (95% CI 7.9–11.2) [96].\n\nNew studies suggest a limited role for vitamin D in health, apart from musculoskeletal conditions\n\nProduction of vitamin D is the best known benefit of exposing the skin to UV-B radiation. Vitamin D plays a key role in maintaining musculoskeletal health. There is controversy about the optimal concentration of the metabolite measured to assess vitamin D status (25 hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D]); it is generally accepted that 25(OH)D < 25–30 nmol/L increases the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, but many organisations advise maintaining levels of at least 50 nmol/L to minimise the risk of falls and fractures. Observational studies suggest that there may be links with many other health outcomes and, if this is the case, a higher 25(OH)D concentration may be warranted. However, the observed associations may not be causal, and randomised controlled trials have mostly failed to identify benefits of vitamin D supplementation. Mendelian randomisation studies, in which genetically predicted, rather than measured, 25(OH)D concentration is used to test a link with health outcomes can overcome some of the biases inherent in observational studies. Several recently published Mendelian randomisation studies have failed to identify links between vitamin D and cardiovascular/metabolic diseases, depression, non-vertebral fracture, all-cause mortality [97, 98], or cognitive and psychiatric traits [99].\n\nThese Mendelian randomisation analyses do not account for non-linear effects so cannot exclude a possible effect of very low 25(OH)D concentration, but they suggest a limited benefit of treatment to increase 25(OH)D concentrations in people who are not markedly deficient. These findings are important as they underpin models aiming to identify the amount of UV-B radiation needed to avoid vitamin D deficiency.\n\nVitamin D deficiency appears to be widespread on the African continent and in people of South-Asian origin living in the United Kingdom\n\nA meta-analysis of vitamin D deficiency on the African continent found that 18.5% and 34.2% of study participants had a serum 25(OH)D concentration of < 30 nmol/L and < 50 nmol/L, respectively [100]. However, the heterogeneity between studies was very high and could not be explained by age group, geographical region, residence in a rural vs urban region, vitamin D assay, or risk of bias. While this study suggests that there is a moderately high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Africa, population-based studies using consistent methods (including vitamin D assays) are needed to enable inter-country comparisons and inform sun exposure and nutrition policies.\n\nAn analysis of blood samples from 6433 adults (aged 40–69 years) of South-Asian descent from the UK Biobank cohort (samples collected between 2006 and 2010) found a very high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; 92% had 25(OH)D concentration < 50 nmol/L, 55% were < 25 nmol/L and 20% had very severe deficiency (25(OH)D < 15 nmol/L). When an additional 843 participants with undetectable 25(OH)D concentration were included the prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency rose to 29%. While these data are now at least a decade old, and new recommendations that residents of the United Kingdom should routinely take a 400 international unit supplement may have reduced the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, they highlight the high risk borne by dark-skinned people living at high latitudes [101]. One of the main consequences of vitamin D deficiency in children is rickets, and over 80% of children with rickets in the United Kingdom are of South Asian or black ethnicity [102].\n\nUV radiation-induced modulation of the immune system has both beneficial and adverse effects\n\nExposing the skin to UV radiation affects the local and systemic immune system through both vitamin D and non-vitamin D pathways. Depending on the wavelength, dose, and frequency of exposure to UV radiation, adaptive (i.e., acquired) immune responses are often suppressed [103, 104]. Exposure to UV radiation induces alterations to cutaneous cells, molecules [105], the transcriptome [106], and commensal bacteria [107], leading to the downstream activation of regulatory T and B cells. These exert their suppressive effects for sustained periods of time, both locally at the site of exposure to UV radiation and distantly at un-irradiated sites (Fig. ) [108]. Other immune cells, including recently described GATA3+ T cells [109], may also be involved. Suppression of the cutaneous immune response is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of skin cancer [104]. This is particularly the case when the amount of UV radiation received is high (i.e., sunburning) and/or prolonged (i.e., chronic). The distant effects of UV radiation on the immune response may drive melanoma development at non-skin sites such as the eye [110].\n\nIn contrast to suppression of adaptive immunity, innate immune responses, particularly at the site of exposure to UV radiation, are activated (Fig. ). While this activation may lead to protection from localised infection, it is also likely to affect the cutaneous microbiome (the community of micro-organisms present in and on the skin), albeit with a high degree of variability between, and even within (different skin locations) people [111]. In general, the changes to the cutaneous microbiome induced by exposure to UV radiation appear to increase skin irritation and rashes, and also alter immune responses to pathogens. New research highlights implications of this immune modulation induced by exposure to UV radiation for some diseases as described below.\n\nHerpes zoster (shingles) is a painful blistering skin condition that can be followed by disabling neuralgia. It results from reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV). In 205,756 participants from three prospective United States cohort studies followed for 16–24 years, over 24,000 incidents of herpes zoster were reported [112]. Higher estimated exposure to UV radiation was associated with a 14% higher risk for herpes zoster in men (adjusted hazard ratio 1.14; 95% CI 1.02–1.2), but there was no association in women. This is the first longitudinal study reporting increased risk of VZV reactivation related to exposure to UV radiation. These findings require verifying, but may be explained by suppression of skin immunity [113].\n\nThere has been additional evidence that exposure to UV radiation reduces the risk of some autoimmune diseases. In the United States Radiologic Technicians Study, there was a linear association between lower winter (but not summer) lifetime average ambient UV radiation dose at the location of residence and increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS; adjusted HR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.21–3.30 for lowest vs highest of four categories) [114]. A recent meta-analysis confirms a latitude gradient in the prevalence of MS which may be growing stronger; this provides further evidence of the importance of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis [115]. In children, higher sun exposure was associated with a lower risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease in an Australian study (adjusted OR 0.94, P = 0.002 for each additional 10 min outdoors) [116].\n\nExposure to UV radiation has potential effects on cancer and metabolic disease\n\nThe gut microbiome is emerging as a key player in multiple health outcomes, including some cancers, and metabolic, autoimmune, and psychiatric disorders [117]. Exposing the skin to UV radiation can increase the diversity of the gut microbiome, with the potential for a positive impact on disease [118]. It is not yet clear whether this is through vitamin D-dependent or independent pathways [119], but a systematic review of in vivo studies found suggestive links between vitamin D and the microbiome in both mouse and human studies [120].\n\nIn a systematic review and meta-analysis, greater time spent outdoors was associated with reduced risk of breast cancer (≥ 1 h/day in the sun during summer months over a lifetime or usual adulthood compared with < 1 h/day: pooled relative risk = 0.84, 95% CI 0.77–0.91) [121], with some evidence of a stronger effect for exposure during adolescence.\n\nIn a large study of patients on long-term haemodialysis (n = 342,457) in the United States, the ambient UV irradiance at the location of the dialysis clinic was inversely associated with systolic blood pressure [122]. Both ambient UV-A and UV-B irradiance were associated with a beneficial effect, but the effect of UV-B radiation was greater. These data are consistent with an earlier clinical trial of UV-A irradiation [123], but the lack of individual-level data on residential location or time outdoors reduces the level of confidence that greater exposure to UV radiation is associated with lower systolic blood pressure.\n\nGuidance relating to sun exposure may need to be reconsidered\n\nThe World Health Organization and many other government and non-government organisations advise that sun protection is not required when the UV index is below 3. This advice has been challenged previously based on UV radiation data from New Zealand [124] and is supported by a new study from Germany [125]. Using data from nine ground-based monitoring stations from 2007 to 2016, Lehmann and colleagues found that when the UV index is 2, people with Fitzpatrick skin types I and II can receive a minimal erythemal dose of UV radiation in 1.5 h [125]. On rare occasions, the minimal erythemal dose can be exceeded when the UV index is 1. A more nuanced sun protection message may be required that takes account of skin type and time outdoors.\n\nTerrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity\n\nInteractions between stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change continue to modify the exposure of plants and animals to solar UV radiation (both UV-B and UV-A radiation). These changes have the potential to affect agricultural sustainability and the health and services of terrestrial ecosystems. In this section, we evaluate the ecological strategies that underpin the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to stratospheric ozone depletion, and assess new research that considers the role of UV radiation in influencing the range of suitable habitats for important species that contribute to biodiversity. In addition, we address how UV-B radiation, together with changes in other environmental factors associated with climate change (e.g., temperature, moisture availability), affects plant growth, pathogen and pest defence, and food crop quality. Here we assess the potential effects of these and other changes resulting from interactions between stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change on terrestrial ecosystems, including ecological effects of extreme events such as wild fires, record-setting temperatures, and stratospheric ozone depletion in the Arctic and Antarctic.\n\nInteractive effects of UV radiation and climate change on biodiversity\n\nClimate change can cause declines in biodiversity by reducing the availability of suitable habitats for plant and animal species. Shifts in the ranges of distribution can disrupt ecosystem functioning and lead to further species migration. Ultimately, if dispersal fails to keep pace with changing habitats, biodiversity loss will occur. Species distribution models are applied to determine how climate change will affect future habitat suitability of valuable species through changes in key abiotic drivers. These models account for landscape-level processes; they do not account for fine-scale effects on microhabitats, including topographic, canopy-level and biotic factors, which are also important in determining where species can live [126, 127]. These species distribution models can be used to inform efforts to conserve species (SDG 2.5), as well as management plans for improving plant production in agriculture and forestry [128].\n\nSeveral studies have shown that the inclusion of UV-B radiation in models that forecast future distribution ranges of ecologically and agriculturally important species can improve their predictive power [75, 129–134]. These models are based on RCP scenarios (Sect. 2.1) driving future climate change, and suggest that the range of some native species from open, dry habitats will expand to higher elevations [75, 130–134], while the ranges of willows and other related species from wetter habitats will shrink [129].\n\nAll these studies have examined species from largely arid and semi-arid shrub-steppe habitats in China and central Asia and have taken the unusual step of including UV-B radiation among their environmental variables (data taken from the global climatology; Beckmann et al. [135]). Using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models to estimate habitat suitability, incident UV-B radiation, precipitation, and temperature, were significant determinants of species occurrence. Such models are based on correlative relationships between climate and species occurrence so cannot identify the mechanisms underlying these predictions. Nonetheless, the findings from these models suggest that this approach could be useful in assessing risks to biodiversity, as well as providing information on potential species distributions and suitable habitats for conservation and planting crops under different scenarios of climate and solar UV-B radiation (contributing towards SDG 2.3).\n\nAfter selection of the significant climatic variables for these particular studies of species distributions, UV-B radiation was retained in the models. Nevertheless, most modelling studies still fail to test whether UV-B radiation and its interaction with other abiotic stressors are potential constraints on species distributions. As more detailed and accessible UV-B databases become available (Sect. 2.9), it will be possible to routinely include UV-B radiation among climatic variables that are used to predict species occurrence, range shifts and changes in biodiversity over large geographic scales.\n\nAdaptation of Antarctic flora to UV radiation and extreme climate events\n\nThe native flora of Antarctica has evolved protective mechanisms to survive in the severe Antarctic conditions and these adaptations can confer cross-tolerance to cold temperatures, drought, and high solar irradiances, including transient high UV-B radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion. However, disruptions of atmospheric circulation patterns in the Southern Hemisphere resulting from stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change are also causing large changes in the Antarctic climate (Sect. 4.3), which may exceed the tolerances of certain species. If these climatic changes persist, they would likely threaten the native biodiversity of Antarctica.\n\nThe harsh environmental conditions of Antarctica limit the extent of suitable habitats for terrestrial photosynthetic organisms. Of these, cryptogams (lichens, bryophytes and algae) are best adapted to survive under these conditions and they dominate the Antarctic flora. In comparison, the two native vascular plant species are restricted to the Antarctica peninsula [136]. Despite their taxonomic differences, there are parallels in the adaptive responses of Antarctic bryophytes and vascular plants to UV-B radiation. Adaptive strategies to survive exposure to UV-B radiation in the moss, Pohlia nutans, include antioxidant enzymes, flavonoid synthesis and photolyases [137–139], whereas in Ceratodon purpureus various flavonoids confer photoprotection [140] along with yet to be identified red cell wall pigments [141]. The equivalent protection response of the vascular plant, Colobanthus quitensis, to UV radiation is enhanced by forming mutually beneficial relationships between plant roots and soil fungi (i.e., mycorrhizae). These associations rely on a stable ecosystem and support the plant’s floral development and growth, also reducing oxidative stress and membrane damage, protecting photosynthesis and maintaining photoprotection through UV-screening flavonoids [142–144]. In the native Antarctic grass, Deschampsia antarctica, a key enzyme in the synthesis of flavonoids (chalcone synthase) matches that present in temperate grasses, including the cereal grains rice and barley [145], indicating a common regulatory role in UV-photoprotection across these species. An understanding of how these organisms tolerate UV-B radiation and the harsh conditions of Antarctica will improve our ability to assess the vulnerability of polar biodiversity to ongoing changes in stratospheric ozone and climate.\n\nImpacts of stratospheric ozone depletion on Antarctic climate affecting terrestrial ecosystems\n\nThe impacts of climate change across the Southern Hemisphere linked to stratospheric ozone depletion have been discussed in previous papers [146, 36] detailing effects on both aquatic [147] and terrestrial [148, 149] ecosystems. Ozone depletion has partially masked the impact of climate change in Antarctica, primarily during summer, by promoting cooler conditions than would otherwise have occurred. As the effects of climate change on Antarctic environments are expected to increasingly overwhelm those of stratospheric ozone depletion later in the century, this masking effect will diminish (Sect. 2.4).\n\nDuring late 2019 and early 2020, a series of unprecedented climate extremes occurred in the Southern Hemisphere, which included strong Antarctic stratospheric warming [40, 41], an unusually small ozone hole [150, 151], severe bushfires in Australia [45], and heatwave conditions in Antarctica [43]. These conditions were associated with a strong negative state of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), which has been linked with anomalous tropical convection [41]. Model projections indicate that persistence and variability of the SAM are enhanced by stratospheric ozone depletion, leading to longer lasting coupling between the stratosphere and troposphere [152]. This finding would imply that while the 2019 Antarctic ozone hole was relatively small, the climate extremes that followed during the 2019/20 summer were still potentially exacerbated by ozone depletion, although this remains to be confirmed.\n\nThe 2019/20 Antarctic summer heatwave lasted 4 months and led to accelerated snow melt (Fig. ), localised flooding, and greening of previously drought-stressed moss beds [43]. While it is too early to know the full extent of biological changes resulting from the Antarctic summer of heatwaves, we would expect flooding to alter soil invertebrate and cyanobacterial communities in the coming decade as reported following flooding of the Dry Valleys in 2001–2002 [155]. Accelerated snow melt can also lead to depletion of water reserves late in the season, causing ecosystem water deficits in late summer [136]. Antarctic organisms are able to survive in the normally cold air by absorption of solar radiation and passive heating to create microhabitats where plants are often 10–20 ˚C warmer than the ambient temperature [153]. We, therefore, would expect that temperatures like the 20.75 °C reported at Marambio Base on Seymour Island last summer would lead to heat stress in Antarctic organisms [43]. In general, we anticipate that these recent extreme conditions pose significant threats to the survival of some terrestrial and coastal marine plants and animals from Antarctica as well as other high southern latitudes, since their adaptive capacity may be reduced under rapidly changing conditions in these already harsh environments. However, scientific reports on the ecosystem effects of these heatwaves, floods and/or droughts on native Antarctic species will likely take several years to appear.\n\nResponse of crop plants to changing UV radiation and climate conditions\n\nChanges in climate and stratospheric ozone are altering the exposures of plants to UV-B radiation and this is occurring in concert with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, extreme air temperatures and more variable precipitation patterns [156]. Because of these environmental changes, some crop plants in tropical and temperate mountain regions are likely to be exposed to increasing UV-B radiation as their most suitable habitat is displaced to higher elevations [149]. Multiple environmental factors interact to affect plant growth and agricultural crop quality, but effects are variable depending on species and growing conditions. In particular, ambient UV radiation combined with other environmental stressors, such as changes in temperature, can drive flavonoid production. These compounds have multiple functions in plants including as UV radiation screening pigments, antioxidants and signalling molecules, and changes in plant flavonoids can carry forward to affect a number of ecosystem processes [157, 158]. Flavonoids occur in agricultural and wild plant species and their concentration in leaves and fruit varies with seasonal weather patterns and herbivory [159–161].\n\nStudies of organisms that live at very high elevations are relevant for understanding how species acclimate and adapt to high UV irradiances under extreme environmental conditions. For example, Maca (Lepidium meyenii) is a crop from the high Andes in Peru that can quickly recover from stress induced by acute high solar UV radiation [162, 163]. Similarly, Chinese tallow trees (Triadica sebifera), growing in southern China, accumulate more UV-absorbing flavonoids in their leaves with increasing elevation (100 to 1000 m above sea level) [161]. Populations of plants and animals can also genetically adapt to tolerate high UV irradiances. These adaptations are evident in increases in melanin pigment of bird skin with decreasing latitudes [164], and latitudinal changes in flavonoids of crop plants such as broad bean (Vicia faba). In this latter example, a field experiment using UV filters showed that the flavonoid profile of a cultivar native to high elevations in Ecuador and Columbia differed from that of a cultivar from Sweden at low elevation [165]. In these cultivars, flavonoids increased in response to the UV radiation they received during growth and there is some evidence that these effects persisted into the next generation [166]. These studies imply that, in environments where high UV-B irradiances are common (e.g., low latitudes and high elevations), it may be possible for farmers to select crop species and cultivars that are well suited to these local UV radiation conditions just as growers do for other climatic factors. These activities would contribute to meeting the SDG target 2.3 of improving the productivity and incomes of small-scale producers.\n\nEcological strategies of plants to accommodate changing UV radiation conditions\n\nChanges in vegetation, cloud cover, aerosols and snow cover, as a consequence of climate change, air pollution control measures, wildfires and shifting land-use practices, can rapidly increase or decrease UV-B radiation at Earth’s surface (Sects. 2.7–2.8) [2, 149, 167]. These changes in UV-B radiation are often accompanied by changes in other wavelengths of sunlight (i.e., spectral quality) that then interact with UV-B radiation to modify plant function and the composition and diversity of ecological communities.\n\nProgress continues to be made in identifying the molecular mechanisms that underpin plant responses to UV-B radiation, and how these responses differentiate and interact with responses to the adjacent spectral regions of radiation, such as UV-A radiation and blue light. The eventual goal of this research is to establish the links from perception by the photoreceptor to the functional response of plants within an ecological context [168, 169]. Recent studies report how responses at the genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic level are expressed in plant phenotypes. This research confirms that different photoreceptors trigger responses governed by UV radiation shorter than 350 nm and responses mediated by UV radiation longer than 350 nm and blue light. However, these two sets of responses interact with each other to coordinate acclimation to high light vs shade conditions [170–173]. These findings imply that perception and response to UV-B radiation not only protects against the deleterious effects of very high solar radiation but that many of these photoprotective responses can also be induced by UV-A radiation and blue light.\n\nThe UV-B radiation received within plant canopies depends on vegetation structure and follows predictable daily, seasonal, and annual cycles dictated by sun angle, canopy phenology, and the optical properties of leaves in the crown [160, 174]. Recent analyses using plant functional traits, show that shade-intolerant species (i.e., those adapted to grow in fully sunlit environments) acclimate more effectively to shifts in the spectral composition of solar radiation involving changes in UV-B radiation than shade-tolerant species (i.e., those adapted to grow in shaded environments) [175]. For example, shade-intolerant species effectively adjust their leaf epidermal flavonoids, which are important for UV protection, in response to seasonal changes in exposure to solar radiation across both deciduous and evergreen forest stands [174]. These compounds have been found to improve canopy-level photosynthesis (measured as light-use efficiency) of plants during transient periods of high irradiance, sunflecks, and in canopy gaps, by ameliorating photoinhibition and DNA damage [176–179]. By comparison, shade-tolerant species are better at adjusting to other regions of the solar spectrum (UV-A radiation, blue, and green light) but not to UV-B radiation, in traits linked to both photosynthetic efficiency (e.g., chlorophyll fluorescence) and stress tolerance (e.g., total phenolics, principally flavonoids and anthocyanins) [175] (Fig. ).\n\nThese findings suggest that sudden changes in the spectral composition of solar radiation may compromise plant adjustment to a change in its immediate environment (i.e., its phenotypic plasticity). Such changes in solar radiation and its UV component are often abrupt and can, in time, modify plant community composition, since functional strategies for light use (i.e., shade-tolerance and shade-intolerance) vary among species [180, 181]. Changes in community composition, in turn, can reduce biodiversity. Dramatic alterations in forest understorey light environments (especially UV-B radiation) that result from changes in land use and climate could thus lead to the decline of a high diversity of shade-adapted species, which are critical for healthy forests and the services they provide (SDG target 15.1).\n\nPollen, UV radiation, and paleoecology\n\nPollen is essential for reproduction in flowering plants and has attributes that make it a potentially useful tool for reconstructing past solar UV radiation climates and interpreting extinction events in the fossil record. The accumulation of phenolic compounds protects pollen from the deleterious effects of solar UV radiation and these compounds, which are deposited in sporopollenin (the outer structure of the pollen that is preserved in the fossil record), are stable over long time periods [182]. Thus, changes in the concentration of these UV-absorbing compounds in the fossilised pollen of specific plant species may serve as a proxy for global changes in surface UV-B irradiances over geological timescales [183]. The expected stabilisation of global UV-B irradiances following the recovery from contemporary stratospheric ozone depletion reduces the risk that exposure to UV-B radiation will exceed plants’ capacity to protect the DNA in pollen in the future [149]. By comparison, some studies have linked abnormalities in fossilised pollen to mass extinction events in the geologic record, although further evidence is needed to confirm that the observed changes in fossil pollen structure and chemistry are specific to UV-B radiation effects and not the result of other changes in the environment.\n\nAbnormalities are evident in the structure of pollen grains from sediments spanning the end-Permian mass extinction (e.g., Hochuli et al. [184]. Several studies also report pollen abnormalities from sediments spanning other time periods in Earth’s history, including the Late Triassic [185], the Triassic-Jurassic transition [186], and the end-Devonian mass extinction [187]. Such abnormalities in pollen morphology can be caused when a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the pollen grain produces DNA dimers and introduces mutations that reduce pollen viability, or through direct damage to pollen during its development [188]. Increased occurrence of malformations has been found in pollen from Pinus mugo under treatments of high UV-B irradiance [189]. Thus, it is conceivable that the deformations seen in fossil pollen could be the result of an increase in UV-B irradiance due to severe stratospheric ozone depletion in the geological past. However, care is needed in attributing these abnormalities to UV-B radiation, since similar damage can also be caused by metal toxicities, nutrient limitations, heat stress, drought stress, and pathogens, also polyploidy and hybridisation [190, 191]. Likewise, the timescales and geographic ranges of deformation of pollen in the fossil record should match the expected scales of ozone depletion and associated climatic changes [192].\n\nNevertheless, by combining the information on abnormalities with biochemical studies of pollen, it is possible that stronger inferences can be made about the timing and consequences of major global changes in UV-B irradiance associated with perturbations in Earth’s climate over geological timescales. This knowledge would provide a valuable perspective on the ecological consequences of modern-day climate change and the potential effects on Earth’s biota resulting from large increases in solar UV-B radiation that would have occurred in the absence of the Montreal Protocol [64].\n\nTechnological advances, UV radiation, and agricultural sustainability\n\nThe innovative development of technologies in UV-B radiation research, coupled with the application of knowledge of plant response to UV-B radiation from research into the environmental effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, is contributing to more efficient and sustainable agriculture ranging from pre- to postharvest treatments and from field to greenhouse crops. The increase in this kind of innovative research and development has been one of the important indirect benefits of the Montreal Protocol and contributes to meeting the SDG target 2.4 of ensuring sustainable food production. As a consequence of these activities, we have a better understanding of the appropriate amounts of UV-B radiation required to promote regulatory responses in crops without inducing damage. This knowledge is being applied to produce food crops in a manner that is economically viable and environmentally sustainable (SDG 17.14). For practical reasons, the precision application of UV-B radiation is easier in controlled environment facilities [193–196], although supplemental UV-B radiation has also been applied under field conditions (e.g., using UV-emitting lamps mounted on a tractor in vineyards [197]) and where UV-B radiation is manipulated for the control of pests through the use of novel UV-transmitting cladding materials [198].\n\nThe role of UV radiation has been studied in the production of about 50 different food crop species, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, fruits, pseudocereals, herbs, and spices, as well as turfgrasses, ornamental plants, and many medicinal plants [199]. In most studies where UV-B radiation has been manipulated, it has been applied prior to harvest (i.e., preharvest), or following harvest (i.e., postharvest). Species studied in this context include beetroot [200], broccoli [201], ginseng [202], prickly pear [203], blueberry [204], and even mushrooms [205]. In certain varieties of peach, these treatments have helped maintain the weight, firmness, and vitamin C content of the fruit, which increases its quality, value, and shelf-life [206–208].\n\nThe use of UV-B radiation in plant production can also affect both the physiology and behaviour of insect pests. For example, a daily night-time exposure to 3 h of UV-B radiation decreased the hatching of eggs of the important agricultural pest species, Tetranychus urticae, the two-spotted spider mite [209]. A natural predator on this pest species, the mite Neoseiulus californicus, was relatively unaffected by UV-B radiation, creating the possibility for integrating UV-B treatments in sustainable cropping. UV-B radiation is also emerging as an environmental cue that can upregulate plant defences against herbivorous arthropods. For example, short daily exposures of UV radiation increased the resistance of chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum × morifolium) to the insect pest, thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) [210].\n\nUV-B radiation technology is continuously improving, especially with the development of cheaper, more energy-efficient narrow waveband light-emitting diodes (LEDs) [211, 212]. However, legal restrictions limit the use of UV-B radiation sources in controlled plant production in some countries [213]. In addition to LEDs, attaining the appropriate amounts of UV-B radiation often requires the use of optical filters [214] and simulation models to estimate appropriate time-integrated UV-B doses [215]. For these technologies to be widely adopted and approved, however, proper precautions must be taken to protect human health against adverse effects of UV-B radiation [216].\n\nAquatic ecosystems\n\nThe exposure of aquatic ecosystems to solar UV-B radiation depends on the extent and rate of stratospheric ozone recovery and many additional factors that are progressively changing. The most important factors determining the transmission of UV radiation in aquatic ecosystems are the amounts of particulate and dissolved material in the water column. Inland and coastal waters are generally less transparent to UV radiation than oceans and large lakes, primarily due to terrestrial run-off carrying decayed plant material [217]. Climate change is predicted to affect penetration of UV radiation by altering the amount of runoff, and thus water clarity (transparency), as well as depth of mixing and the duration of ice-free conditions. Seasonal variations in exposure to UV radiation are modulated by the timing of runoff and the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM). Aquatic micro-organisms, macroalgae, plants, and animals (floating, swimming and attached) respond to these changes in UV irradiance, with the response also dependent on other effects of climate change including warming and ocean acidification (SDG 14.3). Substances released into the environment by humans, such as oil pollutants, are also modified by UV radiation, which in turn can affect aquatic organisms.\n\nThe role of dissolved organic matter in controlling underwater exposure to UV-B radiation in lakes has been confirmed over broad geographic regions, including China\n\nUnderwater exposure to UV-B radiation is a function of the amount of UV-B radiation incident on the surface, as well as absorption and scattering by water and substances in the water. As the stratospheric ozone layer continues to recover, changes in the quality and quantity of UV-absorbing terrestrially derived dissolved organic matter (tDOM) are increasingly controlling exposure to UV-B radiation in inland and coastal waters [218, 219]. Prior studies focused on sub-tropical, temperate, and Arctic regions of North America. Now, trends in incident and underwater UV radiation in lakes have also been compared for China. For three lakes between 1988 and 2014, the penetration of UV-B radiation at 1 m depth relative to incident has decreased by 12 to 45% [220]. Incident UV-B radiation also decreased during this period, so that overall UV-B radiation at 1 m depth decreased by 14 to 46%. This decreased water transparency, mostly from higher concentrations of tDOM, apparently accounted for most of the decline in UV-B radiation, with decreased incident radiation, mainly due to increased aerosol pollution, playing a minor role [220]. This study supports the key role of tDOM in controlling underwater exposure to UV-B radiation compared to factors controlling incident radiation, including aerosols and ozone.\n\nThe seasonal timing of incident UV-B radiation relative to seasonal changes in hydrology, photobleaching, and water temperature, regulate underwater UV-B radiation and the response of aquatic organisms\n\nSeasonal cycles in incident solar UV-B radiation, hydrology, and photobleaching (reduction in the UV-absorbing capacity) of tDOM alter underwater exposure to UV-B radiation. Changes in the seasonal timing of both maximum and minimum water temperatures relative to the timing of peak exposure to UV-B radiation may have deleterious consequences for some aquatic organisms. For example, as spring progresses to summer and temperatures warm and increase evapotranspiration, the transport of UV-absorbing compounds in tDOM to inland and coastal waters decreases [221]. Biodegradation and photodegradation of tDOM additionally changes the chemical composition, decreasing the UV-protective capacity of tDOM [222]. In the shallow waters of coral reefs, high temperatures together with high UV-B irradiance threaten coral health [223]. The seasonality of photodegradation of DOM, which increases transparency of water to UV-B radiation, can shift the timing of peak exposure to the UV-B radiation by a month or more after the summer solstice. As surface temperatures continue to rise during this period, the most stressful periods of high temperatures and high UV-B radiation coincide [223]. In contrast, in higher latitude or high elevation lakes, water temperatures warm more slowly than daily increases in incident solar radiation, leading to a seasonal time lag that creates seasonal periods when exposure to damaging UV-B radiation is high, but water temperatures remain low [224]. These lower temperatures are likely to reduce the potential for organisms to effectively repair UV-B-induced DNA damage due to the temperature-dependence of the enzymes that drive photoenzymatic repair [225, 226]. Thus, seasonality of the hydrologic cycle and bio- and photodegradation of tDOM play a major role in regulating underwater exposure to UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems, while the seasonality of temperature in relation to the timing of peak incident solar UV-B radiation can determine how effectively aquatic organisms can respond to UV-B radiation. All of these factors are being affected by ongoing climate change.\n\nClimate change is causing regional increases or decreases in the depth of vertical water circulation in the surface layer, which determines the average exposure to UV-B radiation for water, particles, and planktonic organisms\n\nSurface waters in the ocean and lakes continuously move, both horizontally and vertically, mixing substances and planktonic organisms. The upper mixed layer (UML) represents one of the most biologically active habitats within aquatic ecosystems. During vertical circulation, substances and organisms in the UML are exposed to variations in UV-B radiation, higher at the surface, decreasing with depth. The average exposure level depends on the depth of the circulation, the mixed layer depth (MLD), which is an important variable to consider when assessing the effects of UV-B radiation in pelagic systems. This depth differs depending on physical factors, including gradients in temperature and salinity, water clarity, and wind speed. The effects of climate change on these factors vary among different parts of the ocean [227]. Contrary to earlier projections that climate change should lead to uniformly shallower MLDs in the ocean (e.g., [228]), more recent data show that trends are not always towards shallower depths and that MLDs are, in some locations, deepening [229].\n\nInland there is the phenomenon of “atmospheric stilling”, where the strength of surface winds has declined over many continental areas from 1980 until 2010 [230], after which wind speeds have increased [231]. Stetler et al. [232] suggest that the decline in wind strength led to a shallower summer MLD in deep, remote Crater Lake, Oregon, United States. The causes and future of atmospheric stilling are unclear, as is whether the reversal in atmospheric stilling will continue in the future [231, 233]. Stilling increases average exposure to UV-B radiation in the UML.\n\nWhile it is clear that climate change affects MLDs and, therefore, exposure to UV-B radiation in aquatic ecosystems, impacts differ among locations, and it is the balance among several factors that determine whether exposure increases or decreases in a particular system.\n\nThe effects of climate change on ice cover are increasing underwater exposure to UV-B radiation\n\nIce cover shades water from UV-B radiation, and ice-covered areas are decreasing in lakes [234] and the polar oceans [235] due to climate change. The date of ice breakup in 152 lakes in the Northern Hemisphere during 1951–2014 shows a trend of 1.2 days earlier breakup per decade (range 5.0 days earlier to 0.3 days later) [236]. Using future scenarios of climate change (RCP 2.6 and RCP 6.0), the projected duration of ice cover on historically ice-covered lakes is 15 (RCP 2.6) or 29 (RCP 6.0) days shorter in the period 2080–2100 than for 1985–2005 [234]. Similarly, an ice cover classification model was used to project the future ice cover of the almost 1.5 million lakes within the global HydroLakes database [237]. The proportion of ice-covered lakes shifting from having ice cover every winter to only some winters would be 2.8% at a temperature increase of 2 °C and 7.2% at a temperature increase of 4.5 °C. Exposure to UV-B radiation will increase in historically ice-covered lakes affected by such a future loss of ice cover.\n\nSurface features such as meltwater ponds and snow cover are major determinants of how much UV-B radiation is transmitted through ice cover\n\nThe amount of light transmitted through ice cover varies greatly depending on snow cover and the presence of meltwater ponds on the ice [238]. Studies of transmittance through ice in the Arctic Ocean found that monthly average transparency in the 400–550 nm band varied between 1 and 17% [239]. Surface melt ponds and scattering layers (mainly snow) were the main determinants of transmittance. The thickness of the ice was less important, explaining only 16% of the variation in transmittance. Based on these results, pond presence would be expected to also strongly affect transmittance of UV radiation. Confirming this, the transmittance for all wavelengths (UV radiation and PAR) was strongly enhanced by the presence of ponds on the ice in Baffin Bay [240, 241]. When ponds developed, there was a tenfold increase in transmittance for PAR and UV-A radiation (325, 340 and 379 nm). Twice as much UV-B (305 nm) radiation was transmitted in ponded ice compared to that in white ice, reaching values between 11 and 14%, at 2 m depth. For short UV-A wavelengths (e.g., 325 nm) transmission was much higher, reaching 22–35% when ponds were present. One can assume that for the longest UV-B radiation wavelengths (e.g., 315 nm), transmission would be somewhere between those values. This effect on transmission should be considered in projecting the future trend of UV-B radiation exposure underneath the sea ice, as increased pond formation is correlated with the faster melting of seasonal sea ice increasingly seen for the Arctic [242].\n\nHarmful algal bloom species are resistant to UV radiation and become more toxic when UV radiation is present during growth\n\nNutrient pollution and harmful algal bloom (HAB) species threaten marine and freshwater environments globally [243]. The marine dinoflagellate, Karenia mikimotoi, causes HABs in coastal waters around the globe and accumulates a toxin that kills fish by damaging red blood cells (hemolytic toxicity). The growth rate of this species in culture was unaffected by solar UV-B + UV-A radiation or ocean acidification (or the two in combination) [244], but both conditions enhanced hemolytic toxicity. In freshwaters, the photosynthetic bacterium (cyanobacterium), Microcystis aeruginosa, forms HABs in surface waters where it is exposed to high UV radiation. These surface blooms prevent light and oxygen from entering deeper waters and some strains produce another powerful toxin, microcystin. Ren et al. [245] measured growth and photosynthetic potential (Fv/Fm) of a toxic strain of M. aeruginosa exposed to a combination of UV-B and UV-A narrowband lamps. The weighted exposure approximated summer midday surface irradiance. When supplied with ample phosphorus (P) as would occur in a eutrophic lake, photosynthesis and growth of M. aeruginosa were little affected by UV radiation compared to moderate or severe inhibition under low or depleted P conditions, respectively. This is consistent with the general pattern shown in earlier studies of higher resistance to UV (including UV-B) radiation when algae are nutrient sufficient [246]. When exposed to high UV-B+UV-A+PAR irradiance from a solar simulator, photosynthetic potential was more inhibited in toxic vs non-toxic strains of M. aeruginosa [247]. However, the toxic strain recovered faster after exposure to UV radiation. Thus, the net effect over a daily time scale was less on the toxic strain, which was further confirmed by its higher growth rate than the non-toxic strain over a 7-day period with daily exposure to UV radiation. Moreover, exposure to UV radiation enhanced the accumulation of microcystin in the toxic strain [247]. Thus, exposure to UV radiation enhances toxicity in both freshwater and marine HABs. These results could help inform when toxicity is more likely to occur in a HAB outbreak (SDG 3.9, 6.1, 6.6).\n\nUV-B radiation negatively affects zooplankton but protective mechanisms mitigate these impacts\n\nZooplankton are key links in aquatic food webs; they feed on primary producers and are themselves key prey for fish. Hence, a reduction in the abundance of zooplankton due to UV radiation can lead to reduced fish production and the development of phytoplankton blooms. Evidence continues to accumulate that excessive solar and laboratory exposure to UV-B radiation leads to DNA damage and, ultimately, mortality in zooplankton. This evidence now extends to less studied taxa such as ciliates (single celled organisms with hair-like structures, cilia, for movement), crab larvae, and under-represented systems such as marine and tropical systems (Fig. ) [248–254]. Apart from mortality, UV radiation also affects zooplankton at a sub-lethal level leading to reduced fitness. Recent studies have demonstrated reduced feeding rates in small crustaceans such as copepods, reduced growth in Daphnia and morphological changes in structures used for swimming and feeding in ciliates when exposed to PAR, UV-A and UV-B radiation compared to PAR-only treatments [251, 253, 255, 256].\n\nZooplankton use defenses against UV radiation such as the accumulation of photo-protective compounds through diet, enzymatic "
