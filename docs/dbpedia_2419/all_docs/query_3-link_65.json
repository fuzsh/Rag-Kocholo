        "text": "Our operations\n\nAt Bcomp, our commitment to sustainability starts at home. Our headquarters in Fribourg is located at Bluefactory, a low-carbon innovation site. Here, we operate entirely on 100% renewable energy, reflecting our dedication to minimising our environmental footprint. Furthermore, our nearby production site, located in a long-established building, benefits from our active support for the landlord’s energy efficiency enhancements. This commitment to continuous improvement extends to the entire lifecycle of our activities.\n\nSupply chain\n\nFlax fibres are cultivated and processed locally in the rural areas where they are grown, supporting rural economies by creating jobs and preserving traditional skills. By sourcing European flax through a well-established and transparent supply chain, we ensure these benefits are maintained. Our flax is sourced from companies adhering to the EuropeanFlax® certification scheme, which guarantees traceability, fair labour practices, and product quality. We also strive to minimise our supply chain’s carbon footprint and have achieved the ISCC+ certification.\n\nNatural circularity\n\nFlax plants absorb solar energy and CO2 during photosynthesis, store it during growth, and release it upon decomposition or incineration in waste-to-energy facilities. Incineration also recovers valuable energy for heating and electricity production, contributing to the natural carbon cycle. Unlike biogenic CO2‘s natural cycle, burning fossil fuels releases a linear stream of CO2 from geological reserves. This disrupts the atmospheric balance by adding a constant stream of CO2 that wasn’t previously part of the cycle.\n\nReduced carbon footprint compared to market alternatives\n\nReplacing carbon fibres with ampliTex™ reduces CO2 emissions by nearly 80%, though it slightly increases part weight. Combining ampliTex™ with powerRibs™ reinforcement grid matches the weight and stiffness of a thin-walled monolithic carbon fibre part, while lowering cradle-to-gate CO2 emissions by up to 85%. Using a bio-based resin, such as one made from sugar cane waste (PFA), can cut CO2 emissions by up to 96%.\n\nCircular opportunities through the entire lifecycle\n\nBcomp’s thermoplastic ampliTex™-PP and powerRibs™-PP products offer circular opportunities to large-scale industries. Production scrap which is inevitable can be recycled into composite pellets which serve as a new base material for different applications (injection moulding) or can be fed back into the production process for a different step like the moulding of directly attached fasteners and local reinforcements.\n\nPlay Naturally Smart\n\nGuided by the motto “Play Naturally Smart,” Bcomp fosters a safe and dynamic workplace with equal opportunities, encouraging a healthy and active lifestyle. We value education and innovation, offering lectures at several universities, internships, and collaborating with universities and institutions on research projects. Committed to Fribourg’s economic environment, we create local jobs, practice responsible consumption, recycling, and waste reduction, aligning with Fair Trade Town Fribourg principles. Our employees are encouraged to use responsible means of transportation and we enable them to work from home to reduce the daily commuting stress and impact. We prioritise work-life balance and encourage our employees to embrace freedom, leisure, sports, hobbies, and quality family time.\n\nISO 14001 Certification\n\nBcomp is committed to minimising the environmental impact of its products and overall activities. The certification for the ISO 14001 environmental management system was successfully achieved in March 2022.\n\nISO 9001 Certification\n\nIn 2021, we achieved ISO 9001 certification for our quality management systems. This certification, based on our company goals and objectives, demonstrates our commitment to customer centricity and our dedication to consistently delivering the highest quality products and services.\n\nISCC Plus Certification\n\nIn 2023 we achieved the Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) for the powerRibs™ production, proving our commitment to manufacturing a product that meets the highest standards of environmental responsibility. In 2024 we will continue to expand ISCC to ampliTex™."
