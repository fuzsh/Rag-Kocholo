        "text": "Aircraft operators are constantly looking for ways to make flying more sustainable. With AeroFLAX Lufthansa Technik has developed the first airworthy composite solution based on renewable, eco-efficient and airworthy pre-impregnated fiber – or prepreg in short – meeting the flammability requirements for aircraft cabins.\n\nWith its unique combination of ampliTex™ and powerRibs™ flax fiber reinforcements and a bio-based resin system, a cabin component's weight can be reduced by up to 20 percent and additional CO2 savings can be leveraged over its entire lifecycle.\n\nAs new eco-efficient aircraft types will only come into market in a decade and as every part that is made of glass fiber or carbon fiber can also be made of flax fiber, the entire interior cabin lining can soon be made of AeroFLAX – during line-fit on-site at the aircraft manufacturer or during retro-fit.\n\nSome application Areas for AeroFLAX are\n\nSidewall panel\n\nCeiling panel\n\nDoor frame lining\n\nLavatory shroud"
