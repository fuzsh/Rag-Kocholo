        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn 1979, Thomas L. Minnick introduced a new title for the annual checklists published by Blake. And in his prefatory note he announced that the term “circle” was to be interpreted “very broadly.” When Minnick decided on this change of title, there was certainly no intention to hint at a hegemony of Blake and/or of Blake scholarship over the so-called members of his circle and the study of their works. This, of course, remains true with the present report as well. Historically, it would be rather ludicrous to think of William Blake as the center of gravity, and of artists and writers such as Barry, Cowper, Flaxman, Fuseli, Godwin, Hayley, Paine, West, or Wollstonecraft as the planets circulating on orbits prescribed by Blake, as his circumference. Though the title of “Blake and His Circle” easily lends itself to such a misinterpretation, it should not be seen as propagating a return from the context-conscious Copernican to a Blake-centered Ptolemaic world-view. Rather, the “circle,” as a mere façon de parler, now signifies the strong interest in historical and critical context and the “contextualization” of both the production and the reception of art and literature that has come to characterize most modern Blake studies.\n\nHowever, from studying these annual reports on recent publications concerned with the group of poets and artists that (in one way or the other) Blake was associated with, it is evident at first sight that presently Blake does indeed attract more scholarly attention than any of these eighteenth- and nineteenth-century contemporaries. In the academic world of the late twentieth century Blake is big business while the study of, say, Benjamin West, one-time President of the Royal Academy, remains a small, though hopefully beautiful, affair. Then, one also becomes aware that there is at least one important group that has some claim to be considered part of Blake’s “circle” which nevertheless is hardly ever represented in the scholarly and critical literature at all—and therefore hardly ever represented in these checklists. Blake’s colleagues, the reproductive engravers, have largely remained in the critical limbo to which the hierarchical ordering of British academic art, the R.A.’s very own canon formation, had relegated them during Blake’s lifetime.\n\nNow, Blake is An Illustrated Quarterly, and for the past two years even the annual checklists have been published in a new and pictorially enhanced format. We started, modestly enough, with illustrations showing piles of recently published books or the covers of some of the items listed. This may have been more pleasing to the eye than 30 unillustrated pages, yet no one thought of it as a particularly intelligent and interesting approach toward the illustration of a critical bibliography. Therefore, last year’s checklist issue employed the illustrations quite differently. Reproductions from late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century engravings were intended to function as an occasionally ironic visual commentary on the act of reading—reading in Blake’s times, reading twentieth-century Blake criticism, and reading modern scholarly literature on members of Blake’s “circle.” The illustrations in the present sequel to “Blake and His Circle” lead, I hope, one step further.\n\nAll the illustrations on the subsequent pages reproduce engravings executed by James Parker. They are included here as a first installment in what may become a series which will visually compensate the exclusion of Blake’s fellow-engravers from the canon of artists hitherto deemed worthy of scholarly investigation. Thus, the illustrations that accompany future issues of the checklist might introduce, for example, the work of reproductive engravers, both friends and foes to Blake, such as William Angus, Francesco Bartolozzi, James Basire, William Bromley, Robert Hartley Cromek, Jean Marie Delattre, James Fittler, John Hall, Moses Haughton, James Heath, Thomas Holloway, James Neagle, Luigi Schiavonetti, William Sharp, Anker Smith, James Stow, or Isaac Taylor. My choice for the first of these pictorial introductions to a member of Blake’s “circle” that has scarcely ever received any critical attention is a fairly obvious one. James Parker was Blake’s fellow-apprentice at Basire’s during the 1770s, he teamed up with Blake in a short-lived printselling business in 1784, he was still quoted by the painter-poet with a certain measure of (interested) respect in 1804, and he was employed, late in his rather short life, for engraving many of Flaxman’s Homer designs for the London editions of 1805, a project in which Blake, too, had his own small share as a reproductive engraver.\n\nExcept for contributions to Blake (which, I assume, are readily at hand to any reader of this note), I have tried to supply as many annotations for the entries in parts I and II as possible. As before, however, I ought to point out that only the bibliographical data here begin page 5 | ↑ back to top presented have any claims to “objectivity.” That is to say that they have been verified and standardized to the best of my knowledge, and that there are no intentional omissions of relevant materials. (And I should be most grateful if readers call my attention to additional publications for future reports.) Most of my brief annotations are meant to be primarily descriptive rather than critical. And yet occasionally, these short takes have grown into miniature reviews, and these certainly represent no more than one critic’s response to what he learned from an all too often very brief examination of the contents of the books and articles he wished to record. I hope that these critical asides will enhance the usefulness and readability of my report on the state of the art. At the same time, however, I trust that readers will scrutinize those brief reviews with the same critical detachment as they would use in studying any of the publications themselves. This may be no more than a foregone conclusion, and yet it deserves special mention since the format of the checklist does not allow for a thorough discussion of the criteria behind the reviewer’s personal likes and dislikes.\n\nThe subdivisions employed in the present issue of Blake’s checklists and the guidelines governing the selection and arrangement of the separate entries are the same as those introduced with the list for 1988-89 where they were explained in some detail in the introduction (see Blake 23 [1989-1990]: 120-21). No further explication of the organization of the entries is called for. This year’s checklist of Blake-related publications, however, covers a considerably longer period than usual, extending roughly from summer 1989 through February 1991. As might be expected, this has resulted in yet some further increase in the total number of entries. Sadly, though, such an expansion cannot be taken as indicative of the improved comprehensiveness of the list. With the exception of a day spent at the British Library, most of my notes had to be written at, and are based on the books and journals available to me from, Trier University library or those in my private collection of working materials. These limitations of the library facilities behind the 1989-91 checklist will explain why a relatively large number of publications are marked as “not seen,” and why, no doubt, many 1990 publications have as yet been overlooked.\n\nFurthermore—despite the indulgence of my editors (who kindly agreed to postpone the publication of the checklist for months), and despite the hundreds of hours I have spent at the library to compile the present issue of “Blake and His Circle,” I have not been able to thoroughly work through such weekly publications as the Times Literary Supplement or the New York Review of Books. If time and other projects permit, I will, however, supply the respective references in next year’s compilation. It is expected that the latter can be finished for publication in the spring 1992 issue of Blake. And if the present installment of this ongoing report makes for rather heavy going on account of its length, the installment for 1992 then ought to be little more than a short supplement to what is now published in these pages.\n\nIf during the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s Blake scholarship has been dominated by research concerned with the epic poetry of the post-1799 period, a return of critical interest in Blake’s lyrics and especially, of course, the Songs, has gained momentum in more recent years. These renewed efforts to understand Blake’s lyrics of the late 1780s and early 1790s have often been characterized by the application of newly forged methodological tools, a process which continues into the period here covered. New interpretations of word and image in “The Tyger” have prompted no less than five articles recorded on the subsequent pages, and others of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience in 1989-90 were good for almost a dozen additional publications. The Songs, however, have never ceased to attract a fair share of critical attention, and it may be more important to mention here the welcome increase in research energies devoted to The Book of Thel or Visions of the Daughters of Albion (see #78, 100, 132, 155, 176, 184, 195, and 196).\n\nWhereas studies of the Continental prophecies, Milton, and even Jerusalem are represented rather scantily this year, Vala, or The Four Zoas has prompted a couple of new textual studies in 1989 and 1990 (see #41, 57, 63, 161, and 170). The same period saw the publication of some particularly fine and important catalogues of Blake’s art, documenting both some major exhibitions and the permanent collections of the Tate Gallery and at Melbourne. Otherwise, art historians have unfortunately contributed very little to a critical understanding of form and content in Blake’s imagery. Nevertheless, readers will witness that a thorough revision of the traditional approach towards the interpretation of Blake’s Dante water colors is now under way, driven by the inquisitiveness of literary scholars (see especially #47 and 186, as well as #20, 62, 70, 85, and 149). In the future this will, I believe, not leave the study of Blake’s other series of water color illustrations to the Bible, to Gray, Milton, or Young unaffected.\n\nThe history of science and of eighteenth-century philosophy supply the backdrop for studies of Blake’s thought by Ackland, Steve Clark, Doskow, the Olsons, or Peterfreund in another distinct group in this year’s checklist (see #38, 72, 80, 151, 152, and 157). These articles highlight aspects of Blake’s critique of the Enlightenment. It seems to be similarly important, however, that at least two other studies offer renewed investigations into some darker realm. Though very different in their approach and findings, both Cooper and Youngquist readdress the challenging problems that are posed by what some of Blake’s contemporaries and Victorian biographers have described as his “madness” begin page 6 | ↑ back to top (see #74, 203, and 204). Especially if seen together, a new picture of Blake’s creative processes emerges from these recent reexaminations of their intellectual foundations; not necessarily a clearer picture, but one that may be closer to the complexities of Blake’s reality, torn between the forces of Los and Urizen.\n\nFinally, the advent of yet another discipline in the expanding field of Blake studies is now to be expected. Donald Fitch’s impressive bibliography (#26) offers all the information needed for a steady increase of Blake-related studies by historians of music. A first step in this direction has already been taken in a dissertation concerned with Ralph Vaughan Williams’ “Job, A Masque for Dancing” (see #198).\n\nThree scholars who have exercised an eminent, and in one case a paramount, influence over our understanding of Blake’s works (as well as far beyond), are represented in this year’s checklist with new collections of their essays. The late Northrop Frye’s Myth and Metaphor, Hazard Adams’s Antithetical Essays in Literary Criticism and Liberal Education, and Jean Hagstrum’s Eros and Vision all bear witness to the central position that the study of Blake’s works now holds in shaping innovative critical theories during the second half of the twentieth century (see #39, 97, and 106). Frye’s towering presence in the discipline has been made the subject of numerous articles and a number of books during the past decade; the “Miscellany” in part II, below, adds to the record of such metacritical studies (see #329, 337, 338, and 343), and it demonstrates that the critic, just as the author or artist, can supply all that is needed for a biography, for an impressive achievement in the field of bibliography, and for launching a journal devoted to his work (see #314, 322, and 323). Compared to the extent of methodological interest in Frye’s thinking, the studies of the work of some other Blake scholars and enthusiasts such as Arnold Kettle, Jack Lindsay, or Kaethe Wolf-Gumpold do not weigh heavily at all (see #321, 331, and 342).\n\nIn closing, let me say that my sincere thanks are due to those publishing houses in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands that have supplied me with copies of their recent Blake-related publications; they have thus enabled me to report in greater detail on a number of books which otherwise would not have been available to me at Trier. The following friends and colleagues have also greatly facilitated my work by answering my enquiries and/or by sending offprints from their recently published articles and reviews, which, once again, has proved to be most helpful: Kiyoshi Ando; A. A. Ansari; Colin Ardley; Werner Arens; Rodney Baine; Gerald Bentley; Ann Bermingham; Martin Butlin; Lothar Cerny; Irene Chayes; Andrew Cooper; Claudia Corti; Sonia Dean; Robert Denham; Silke Eberhardt; Michael Ferber; Diane Gillespie; Nancy Moore Goslee; Jack Grant; Nelson Hilton; Georg Kamp; Horst Meller; Joachim Möller; Jeanne Moskal; Kirstin Ollech; Marilynn and Donald Olson; Peter Otto; Stuart Peterfreund; Alan Richardson; Eileen Sanzo; Wilhelm Schlink; Peter Thurmann; Virginia Tufte; Jean Turner; K. D. Verma; John Villalobos; David Worrall, John Wright; Paul Youngquist; Koji Yukiyama; and Irena Zdanowicz. As always, Robert N. Essick has been the most important single outside contributor to the checklist, sharing with me his vast knowledge of the market for Blake books, both old and new. Desmond King-Hele helped with the Darwin section; finally, and on account of our regular exchange of information, it was David Weinglass who supplied the initial references for about half of the entries to this year’s rather substantial list of Fuseli references. For her help with the photographs which illustrate this year’s checklist, I wish to thank Josefine Simon. Morton Paley usefully commented on an early draft of this research report. Patricia Neill and Morris Eaves not only managed to keep the Quarterly going on a quarterly schedule despite the delays recklessly caused by their bibliographer, they also (and vastly) improved the readability of the text in the process of their copy-editing.\n\nbegin page 7 | ↑ back to top\n\nNote: An asterisk preceding an author’s, editor’s, or reviewer’s name marks those entries which I have as yet not been able to examine, and which therefore I have to report on no more than the authority of various secondary sources of equally varying reliability. Occasional references to G. E. Bentley, Jr.’s Blake Books (Oxford, Oxon.: Clarendon P, 1977) have been abbreviated to Bentley 1977. In the interest of brevity, Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly has been shortened to Blake.\n\nPart I William Blake\n\nEditions, Translations, and Facsimiles\n\n1. Caracciolo Trejo, Enrique, ed. and trans. William Blake: Antología bilingüe. El libro de bolsillo 1238 (Sección: Clásicos). Madrid, Sp.: Alianza Editorial, 1987. Pta 519 paper.\n\n—The present edition contains parallel texts from Poetical Sketches, of the Songs, Thel, the Marriage, America, Urizen, and from “The Everlasting Gospel.” The editor has supplied an “Introducción” (9-16), a list for further reading (15-16), a few brief introductory notes to Blake’s poems and his own translations, a glossary of the “Vocablos de sentido especial en la cosmogonía de Blake” (223-26), a “Cronología de William Blake” (227-29), and a brief statement on the “Situación de William Blake” in literary history (231-32). He also states that the present edition is a slightly revised, yet considerably abridged version of an earlier one, entitled Visiones, published by Editorial Era in Mexico in 1974; this is said to include selections from Blake’s epics and their Spanish translations, is not listed in Bentley 1977, and I had not previously known that such an edition existed.\n\n2. Drury, John, ed. Critics of the Bible 1724-1873. Cambridge English Prose Texts. Cambridge, Cambs.: Cambridge UP, 1989. 103-04. £30.00 cloth/£9.95 paper.\n\n—Blake’s biblical criticism is represented with a few excerpts from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\n\n3. Gide, André, ed. and trans. William Blake: Le Mariage du Ciel et de l’Enfer. Collection Romantique 2. Paris, Fr.: Corti, 1988. F 45 paper.\n\n—A reissue of Gide’s translation of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell of 1922 in a format that (while not a photomechanical reprint) is almost identical to that of the 1947 “Poésie et Théatre” edition that was published by Charlot in 1947. Gide’s brief “Introduction” is on pages 7-8.\n\n4. Horn, Zdeněk, ed. and trans. William Blake: Napísǔ; bálsně kytkám na listy. Prague, Czech.: Československý spisovatel Klub přátel poezie, 1981. c. Kcs 15.00 to 18.00 boards.\n\n—The first Czechoslovakian edition of Blake’s writings in half a century; the editor’s “První moderní básník William Blake” is on 177-203.\n\n5. Kennedy, R. B., ed. William Blake: Songs of Innocence and of Experience and Other Works. Annotated Student Texts. Plymouth, Devon.: Northcote House, 1988. £6.95 paper.\n\n—A reprint of an edition designed for classroom use which was previously issued, by various publishers, in 1970, 1972(?), and 1975; see Bentley 1977, #334. “Other works” still refers to Thel, the Marriage, Visions, “The Everlasting Gospel,” and a selection of shorter poems from Blake’s manuscripts.\n\n6. Keynes, Geoffrey, ed. The Complete Poetry and Prose of William Blake. London: Nonesuch P (publ. by Reinhardt Books, in association with Viking), 1989.\n\n—A reprint neither of the first, nor of the last edition of what used to be the standard text from its first appearance as “The Centenary Edition of Blake’s Poetry and Prose” in August 1927 until the publication, in 1957, of Keynes’s Complete Writings of William Blake; rather, the publishers decided to reprint the “revised and reset” 1939 issue. Of course, the pagination established in this “fourth edition” does not correspond with that of the 1957 edition which in turn was used for the 1967 Concordance. See Bentley 1977, #303D.\n\n7. Kitson, Peter, ed. “William Blake.” Romantic Criticism 1800-1825. Key Documents in Literary Criticism [3]. London: Batsford, 1989. 36-43. £7.95 paper.\n\n—Preceded by an introductory note of some 15 lines, Blake’s critical writings are represented in this anthology by excerpts from his letters of 23 Aug. 1799 to the Revd. Dr. Trussler (36-38), of 25 Apr. and 6 July 1803 to Thomas Butts (38-39), by a few of his annotations to Reynolds’s Discourses (39-41), by some of his notes on “The Last Judgment” (41-43), and of the annotations to Wordsworth’s Poems (43). The editor briefly discusses Blake’s position in romantic criticism on pages 15, 18-19, 21, 25, and 28 of his “Introduction.” It comes as some surprise to find that, in 1989, Peter Kitson is still employing the 1946 Nonesuch version of Keynes’s edition of the “Prose and Poetry [sic]” as the standard text for Blake’s “statements about literature and art” (36), and that no excerpts from Blake’s interpretation of Chaucer are supplied. Besides the fragments from Blake’s writings, the book contains selections from Wordsworth, Barbauld, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Scott, Shelley, Hazlitt, and a few “Period Critical Reactions.”\n\n8. *Lorentzatos, Zēsimos, ed. and trans. William Blake: Hoi gamoi tu uranu kai tēs kolasēs eisagōgē. Athens, Greece: Diattón, 1986.\n\n—A Greek version of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell.\n\n9. *Martin, Brian, ed. The Nineteenth Century. Macmillan Anthologies of English Literature 4. Basingstoke, Hants.: Macmillan Education, 1989. £29.95 cloth/£8.95 paper.\n\n—Blake is said to be represented alongside the other romantics by a series of extracts from his writings.\n\n10. *Narumi, Umetsu, ed. and trans. Blake zen-chosaku. 2 vols. Nagoya, Jap.: U of Nagoya P, 1989. ¥ 20600/c. $150.00.\n\n—According to a description supplied by Robert Essick, these volumes total more than 1500 pages; it seems very likely then that they contain Blake’s complete writings in a new Japanese translation.\n\n11. Stevenson, W. H., ed. The Complete Poems of William Blake. Annotated English Poets. 2nd [rev.] ed. London: Longman; New York, NY: Norton, 1989.\n\n—“The purpose of the edition remains the same: to present all Blake’s verse, including the scattered fragments and epigrams, and to provide as much annotation as is necessary to make the poetry accessible to the reader.” However, Stevenson has attempted to bring the scholarly apparatus of his edition, which proved to be the particular strength of the 1971-75 printings, “up to date.” As is appropriately noted in the new preface, this has been “no small task.” Thankfully, the editor has “tried not to interpret or expound any ‘system’ in [Blake’s] works, but to give whatever information is necessary for the exposition of each poem or passage, so that the reader may be able to interpret more easily for himself” (xi). Furthermore, Stevenson has resisted the “temptation” to supply “some kind of Index of Symbols,” realizing that the “danger of such an index lies in its dissociation of the name or word from its context, so that it appears to be pre-existent, an idea fixed in Blake’s mind quite apart from the poem into which he then inserts it.” The editor also shows himself well aware that the “most controversial feature of the first edition turned out to begin page 8 | ↑ back to top be the modernization of the spelling and punctuation.” Since this “is the policy of the series,” there was little to be done about this criticism. He hopes, however, “to have reached a not intolerable compromise, even though it has meant losing the individual flavour of Blake’s page.” Some “major changes have been made in the text” itself (xii), especially in the arrangement of The Four Zoas. In principle then, both the considerable merits of Stevenson’s edition for classroom use and its problematic stance as a typographical “reading” version of what Blake actually wrote remain unchanged; they are neatly summed up in the editor’s definition of the “primary purpose” of his book—“to assist the reader rather than to establish a text” (xiii). While it was Erdman who supplied the basic text for Stevenson’s first edition in 1971, Bentley’s “Oxford English Texts” now seems to have been employed as well (see xiii-xiv), and “Doubtful and Spurious Attributions” have been added in an appendix (873-75).\n\n12. William Blake 1990 Calendar: Fitzwilliam Museum. Petaluma, CA: Pomegranate Calendars and Books, 1989. $16.95/£16.95.\n\n—For each month, a painting or a page from one of the illuminated books in the Fitzwilliam Museum’s Blake collection is reproduced in color; there is no explanatory text.\n\n13. Willmott, Richard, ed. William Blake: Songs of Innocence and of Experience. Oxford Student Texts. Oxford, Oxon.: Oxford UP, 1990. £4.95 paper.\n\n—A classroom text which is based on Michael Mason’s edition in the “Oxford Authors series” (vii) and is illustrated with six color plates from copy Z. The editor has furnished a section entitled “Approaches” (87-127); this supplies suggested “activities” and subjects for readers’ “discussions” under various headings such as “rhythm and imagery,” “context,” “myth,” “religion,” “politics,” “vision,” “meaningful ambiguity,” “revolutions,” “religious attitudes to social wrongs,” “rationalism in the Church,” “Swedenborg’s influence,” etc. The book concludes with a list of 11 “Tasks” (133-39) which are intended to help students in their preparations for an examination.\n\n14. Wordsworth, Jonathan, ed. William Blake: A Descriptive Catalogue 1809. Revolution and Romanticism, 1789-1834: A Series of Facsimile Reprints. Oxford, Oxon.: Woodstock Books, 1990. £18.00/$35 cloth.\n\n—Is there really any need for a facsimile reprint of one of Blake’s publications in conventional typography in general, and of the Descriptive Catalogue (which, since 1863, has been reprinted numerous times) in particular? I think the editor’s decision to include the poetartist’s pamphlet in his series of publications from the period of “Revolution and Romanticism, 1789-1834” can indeed be justified. In the study of Blake’s art and writings, facsimiles of the illuminated books have served a variety of purposes, whereas it may at first seem hard to conceive of similar uses for the reprint of the catalogue for Blake’s exhibition of 1809-10. If, however, the Descriptive Catalogue is to be studied as an unconventional specimen of the species of exhibition and sale catalogues for artists’ one-man shows and in the context of the literary genre of the art catalogue at large, its physical properties may increasingly become of interest. One may think here, for example, of Robert Strange’s Descriptive Catalogue of a Collection of Pictures, 1769, of James Barry’s Account of a Series of Pictures, 1783, of Samuel More’s Description of the Series of Pictures Painted by James Barry, 1792, or of John Hassell’s Critical and Descriptive Observations on the works of George Morland, 1806. With only 17 copies currently traced, the original of the Descriptive Catalogue is almost as rarely found in our libraries as are Blake’s works in illuminated printing, and studies of its contents that draw on an awareness of the specific literary traditions at work in the writing of art catalogues of its period are currently being prepared for the press by Suzanne Matheson and by Alexander Gourlay. Therefore, there certainly seems to be room in the vast field of Blake-related literature for a facsimile of the Bodleian copy of Blake’s 1809 publication. In 1984, Bentley included a reprint of copy O (Glasgow University Library) of the Descriptive Catalogue in his edition of William Blake’s Works in Conventional Typography(see Blake 20 [1986-1987]: 77[#1]). There, however, the original 12mo. in sixes had been blown up to the size of a demy 8vo. volume (to enhance the legibility of the text?), while at the same time the French Revolution was considerably reduced to fit the same format (see also #363, below). With the new (and more expensive) facsimile of copy H scholars may now come into possession of a reproduction that comes a little closer to the original booklet. A couple of unnecessary discrepancies remain: few will take exception to the change in factual collation (a 12mo. in sixes turned into a foolscap 8vo.), and to the slight reduction of overall dimensions this standardization\n\nof page sizes entails. And if the color of the printing paper is not precisely reminiscent of an early nineteenth-century publication, who is to care? However, it is certainly regrettable that the manuscript addition—“At N 28 Corner of Broad Street Golden Square” (and with it the double rule between ll. 16 and 17)—has been removed from the title page in the Woodstock Books reprint of copy H, especially since this variation from the original that is being reproduced is not even mentioned in the editor’s brief “Introduction” (n. pag. [iii-ix]). In general, it would also have been much easier to recommend this edition if a slightly more substantial apparatus had been offered to the reader. While there is nothing wrong with what he says, the editor has to be blamed for what he remains silent about. There is neither a bibliographical description of the Descriptive Catalogue, nor a list of the present locations (and of reproductions) of the paintings and water colors that Blake exhibited in 1809 (both are supplied in Bentley’s useful 1984 collection of reprints). A discussion of Blake and William Wordsworth is all very fine, yet its inclusion in a brief introduction like this must seem odd, if begin page 9 | ↑ back to top questions of context and of literary genre are not addressed at all, and if there is no reference to any of the studies of Blake’s theory of art and of the Descriptive Catalogue (by, e.g., Burke, Eaves, or Gully), let alone the contents of these studies. In the United States, the book and the series are distributed by the Publishers Distribution Center, P. O. Box C831, Rutherford, NJ 07070.\n\n15. *Yura, Kimiyoshi, ed. and trans. William Blake: For Children: The Gates of Paradise and For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise. Tokyo, Jap.: Mirai Kobo, 1988.\n\n—A limited facsimile edition of only 237 copies; there are 15 pages of text in Japanese, printed on light purple paper; according to information from the editor, this extravagantly bound and slip-cased volume (rigid purple slip case, made of plastic and housed in a purple cloth folder in Japanese style!) is already out of print. A full description of this item has kindly been supplied by Robert Essick.\n\nBibliographies, Bibliographical Essays, and Catalogues\n\n16. Bone, J. Drummond, Bryan Burns, and John [C.] Whale. “The Nineteenth Century: Romantic Period.” The Year’s Work in English Studies 67 (1986). Ed. Laurel Brake, with the assistance of Susan Brock, et al. London: Murray; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities P; for the English Association, 1989. 353-73.\n\n—Reporting on studies of romantic literature published as long ago as 1986, Bone in his review of “Verse and Drama” has “to apologize that Blake and WC have not been available to [him] in time for consultation, but they will of course be included next year” (353). Because of the similar absence of entries for all the articles published in Blake from the MLA’s International Bibliography (see #30, below), one is tempted to suspect a conspiracy here. Bone briefly discusses 1985-86 Blake-related studies by Bate, Bidney, Davis, Gleckner, Essick, McGann, and Witke on 354-55. In addition, Bate’s study of Shakespeare and the British romantics is reviewed for a second time in the “Shakespeare” section. There, Bate is said to have “produced an impressively detailed and painstaking book,” demonstrating that its author “read everything and missed, apparently, nothing” (230). To be sure, this is a fine description of an important publication, and if I find a minor blemish in this judgment, it is only because the author of this laudatory note is said to be none other than the author of the book under review. In other chapters of this annual bibliocritical compilation H. R. Woodhuysen finds that “for good reason Blake is dealt with only cursorily” (10) in the penultimate volume of the Index of English Literary Manuscripts, no such reasons are given. Tom Pinkney, in the “Literary Theory” section, briefly comments on Smith’s Politics of Language (61); Stephen Copley as well as John Whale draw attention to Barrell’s study of The Political Theory of Painting (330 and 371); Copley also discusses Meehan’s Liberty and Poetics (320-21) and Sambrook’s account of the eighteenth century in the “Longman Literature in English Series” (326); finally, Alan Bower comments on Griffin’s Regaining Paradise (332) and no King’s biography of Cowper (337).\n\n17.

Laurel Brake, with the assistance of Susan Brock, et al. Oxford, Oxon.: Blackwell; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities P; for the English Association, 1990. 381-407.\n\n—Bone’s report on research devoted to romantic poetry in 1987 is, inter alia, “catching up with last year’s Blake” (383) and the “useful check-lists” (381) which the reviewer had not been able to consult for volume 67 of YWES. Among the books briefly noted by Bone are Swingle’s Obstinate Questionings (382), Kennedy’s annotated student text of Blake’s lyric poetry (382-83), Tomlinson’s guide to the Songs, Pagliaro’s study of Selfhood and Redemption, and Gardner’s Innocence and Experience Retraced (383). In other chapters of this yearbook H. R. Woodhuysen comments on Cohen’s Engaging English Art and on The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature, edited by Pat Rogers (2-3); Cedric C. Brown discusses Griffin’s Regaining Paradise (303; see also the preceding entry); Stephen Copley recommends Rossi’s collection of essays on Science and Imagination and McNeil’s Erasmus Darwin and His Age (342); and Alan W.

New York, NY: AMS P, 1989.\n\n—Books and articles concerned with the art and poetry of Blake are listed on 557-66. As has become the custom in the review section of “Blake and His Circle,” the more extensive of the concise and critical entries for Blake-related scholarship that are supplied in Borck’s annual publication are cited separately in part III, below. There, the present volume is referred to in abbreviated form as “ECCB for 1984 ns 10 (1989).” In addition to the ECCB references that figured in previous issues of Blake’s own annual reports on the state of research, a small number of reviews from earlier volumes in this series have been included only in this year’s checklist, and for these citations the same style of abbreviation has been employed.\n\n19. Butlin, Martin. William Blake 1757-1827. Tate Gallery [Catalogues of the Permanent] Collections 5. London: Tate Gallery Publications, 1990. £55.00 cloth and post free.\n\n—The publication of this volume has been delayed since 1988. It is only with the more recent changes at the Tate Gallery in mind that one may think of the present catalogue as a kind of testament for the Gallery’s Blake Room and as the heritage of the compiler, its highly successful former keeper of the Historic British Collection (on “Blake’s Fate at the Tate,” see #107, below). This third revised edition of what was formerly William Blake: A Complete Catalogue of the Works in the Tate Gallery (1st ed., 1957; 2nd rev. ed., 1971) is certainly more than just old wine in an extravagantly priced new bottle. All the entries have been fully revised, and the catalogue is now much more extensively illustrated, including a generous selection of some 60 color plates. The “Preface” by Sir Norman Reid (1971 ed.: 5) has been replaced by that of the new director, Nicholas Serota (1990 ed.: 7-8). Gone is the introduction to the earlier editions (1971 ed.: 9-19) which was written by the late Anthony Blunt (and at first. one cannot but wonder whether this omission is another move in the damnatio memoriae of this key figure in both the history of British art history and of twentieth-century espionage). However, a general introduction to “The Art of William Blake” by the compiler (which to a large extent draws on the same author’s introduction to the 1978 exhibition catalogue) serves as a replacement (1990 ed.: 17-26). Sir John Rothenstein’s essay on “The Formation of the Collection” (1971 ed.: 5-7), too, is now supplanted by a contribution from Krzysztof Cieszkowski with fuller documentation, though the title has been retained (1990 ed.: 11-16). A more extensive “Chronology” is given (1971 ed.: 20; 1990 ed.: 27-31), and the lists of references to exhibitions, catalogues, and scholarly literature begin page 10 | ↑ back to top have been brought up to date (1971 ed.: 21-22; 1990 ed.: 32-37). The “Concordance” (1971 ed.: 23; 1990 ed.: 38-40) has been revised to include the new Tate Gallery inventory numbers and, of course, the new catalogue numbers of the present publication. It might have been helpful if references to the Tate entries in Butlin’s Paintings and Drawings of William Blake (1981), which of course supplied the basis for most of the revisions, had been integrated in this table (they are cited, however, with the literature listed for each of the items). Despite some minor reshuffling (especially of the works in the “Miscellaneous Drawings” section of the 1971 ed.: 75-78[#77-83]), the arrangement of the catalogue proper remains more or less unchanged. Yet the Tate’s holdings of Blake’s prints have now been fully catalogued for the first time (see 1971 ed.: 24), and this accounts for most of the substantial increase in the number of catalogue entries. The following list gives some idea of the increase in both the number of original works that are here documented and of the comprehensiveness of the new catalogue entries: “Early Works c. 1779-c. 1793” (1971 ed.: 25-31 [#1-9]; 1990 ed.: 42-70 [#1-14]), “Miscellaneous Pages, Fragments and Separate Designs from the Illuminated Books 1789-1795” (1971 ed.: 32-33 [#10-13]; 1990 ed.: 71-81 [#15-24]), “The Large Colour Prints c. 1795-1805” (1971 ed.: 34-41 [#14-24]; 1990 ed.: 82-105 [#25-34], now including a discussion of the 1804-05 printing of some of these designs), “Tempera Paintings of Biblical Subjects c. 1799-1800” (1971 ed.: 42-44 [#25-28]; 1990 ed.: 106-17 [#35-39]), “Illustrations to the Bible and Other Watercolours and Drawings 1800-1805” (1971 ed.: 45-55 [#29-45]; 1990 ed.: 118-44 [#40-57]), “Blake’s Exhibition 1809” (1971 ed.: 56-57 [#46-48]; 1990 ed.: 145-52 [#58-60]), “Visionary Heads c. 1819-1825” (1971 ed.: 58-61 [#49-53]; 1990 ed.: 153-64 [#61-67]), “Late Works 1820-27” (1971 ed.: 62-63 [#54-55]; 1990 ed.: 165-84 [#68-107]), “Illustrations to the Book of Job c. 1821-1826” (1990 ed.: 185-201 [#108-30]), “Illustrations to Dante’s Divine Comedy 1824-1827” (1971 ed.: 64-74 [#56-76]; 1990 ed.: 202-41 [#131-65]), “Drawings Attributed to Robert Blake 1767-1787” (1971 ed.: 79-80 [#84-87]; 1990 ed.: 242-46 [#166-69]), “Works Formerly Attributed to William Blake” (1971 ed.: 24; 1990 ed.: 247-48 [#170-72]), and finally an “Appendix” in which “R. H.” [i.e., presumably Robin Hamlyn] documents the gallery’s most recent Blake acquisition, “A Vision: The Inspiration of the Poet” (1990 ed.: 249-51). Although it is certainly to be regretted that at £55 the public will now no longer feel attracted to buy what in the first two editions also served as a fine and fitting general introduction to Blake’s art, scholars (a community which in general is rather more indifferent to the “ethics of publication” than Blake unquestionably was, and which in most cases finds itself in a position that does not allow for exerting much influence over “marketing decisions”) are very likely to congratulate the compiler on his latest achievement and to welcome this new catalogue of what is arguably the finest collection worldwide of Blake’s works as an artist.\n\n20. Butlin, Martin, and Ted Gott. William Blake in the Collection of the National Gallery of Victoria. With an Introduction by Irena Zdanowicz. Robert Raynor Publications in Prints and Drawings 3. Melbourne, Vic.: National Gallery of Art, 1989.\n\n—This volume presents a complete and lavishly illustrated account of all the Blake water colors, prints, and books presently preserved at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was published in conjunction with an exhibition (14 Sept.-19 Nov. 1989) and an international symposium (16-17 Sept. 1989). The National Gallery’s large collection of Blake’s Dante water colors are, of course, at the center of both the catalogue and of the show. However, there is much more to be discovered in this important addition to catalogues of the holdings of permanent Blake collections. Irena Zdanowicz’s introduction documents “The Melbourne Blakes—Their Acquisition and Critical Fortunes in Australia” (10-19); Martin Butlin discusses “Blake’s Late Illustrations to Milton and Dante” (20-44) and catalogues the “Blake Water-Colours in the National Gallery of Victoria” (45-87 [#1-38]); Ted Gott writes about “The Prints of William Blake” (88-178) and catalogues “Blake Prints and Books in the National Gallery of Victoria” (179-88 [#39-51]). This latter section by Gott includes the most recent acquisitions made at Melbourne, copy X of Innocence, bought in 1988, and a colored copy of the Night Thoughts engravings which, while it cannot easily be fitted into the color categories that were suggested in the 1980 Clarendon edition of the NT designs, has a most interesting provenance, obviously having reached Australia as early as 1837. The exemplary scholarship of the catalogue is supplemented by model reproductions; not only is there a reproduction for every Blake item in the collection, but every colored work is also reproduced in color. For the colored copy of the NT engravings at Melbourne see also #188, below.\n\n21. De Montebello, Philippe, ed. Europäische Kunst 1750-1850 [im Metropolitan Museum of Art]. Trans. Sabine Christmann.

He also pleads guilty to stealing from ABELL and then incorporating into the present checklist these few references.\n\n26. Fitch, Donald. Blake Set to Music: A Bibliography of Musical Settings of the Poems and Prose of William Blake. University of California Publications: Catalogs and Bibliographies 5. Berkeley, CA: U of California P, 1990. $40.00 cloth.\n\n—The subject of this book may not be of central concern to the majority of Blake scholars and critics; however, its handling by Donald Fitch represents a stunning bibliographical achievement. As it is, when visiting the sheet music collection at the Bavarian State Library early in 1990, I had prepared for inclusion in this year’s checklist a special section of what I thought were some 20 unrecorded and largely unknown musical settings of Blake’s poetry from the past decade. This section was rendered completely obsolete by the publication of Fitch’s bibliography. Moreover, the 1402 (!) entries in Blake Set to Music have made me aware for the first time of the truly awe-inspiring wealth of “musical settings of the poetry and prose of William Blake” that are now in existence. Who would have thought there were no less than 636 Blake-related compositions between 1970 and 1979 alone? Fitch has arranged his bibliography alphabetically by composers’ names, records some biographical dates for each composer, gives the titles of compositions, and supplies details of the performing combination “as a service to musicians looking for possible Blake material to perform” (xxvii); he notes the dates of composition, first performances, and publication wherever they have been available (and the compiler certainly appears to have invested a lot of work to get in touch with a vast number of the living composers and/or their publishers in order to learn about details of the compositions); he indicates the length of each piece of music and, in a final item in each entry, he identifies his sources of information. “The illustrations which enhance this bibliography were chosen from the drawings and engravings of Blake to show his artistic use of musical themes” (xxix). Various indices of “Blake Titles” (257-63), of “Performing Combinations” (265-68), of “Translated Texts” (269), and of the names “of editors, arrangers, translators, performers, conductors, choreographers, dancers, dedicatees, commissioners, etc.” (271-81) help to make the wealth of information in Fitch’s book accessible to non-specialists such as myself.\n\n27. Hofmann, Werner, ed. Europa 1789: Aufklärung, Verklärung, Verfall. Exh. cat. Cologne, W. Ger.: DuMont, 1989. DM 89.00 cloth.\n\n—The catalogue for a major exhibition at the Hamburger Kunsthalle (17. Sept.-19 Nov. 1989). Hofmann and Ludwig Seyfarth discuss Blake’s contribution to the imagery of the French Revolution under #100, 107, 111, 436, and 440-448 (see 137, 141, 143, 327, 328-32). Other members of Blake’s circle featured in this ambitious summary of artists’ reactions towards the Great Revolution, its prehistory, and its immediate aftermath include Flaxman (#221, 223, 449), Fuseli (#44, 99, 105, 106, 189, 204-212, 436-438, 463, 470), Gillray (#344b, 404, 406-412, 414-417, 419-430, 432, 434, 435, 477, 513-521, 527-529), Kauffmann (#461), Loutherbourg (#191), Paine (#46), Sharp and Stothard (#45), West (#112, 116, 217), and Wollstonecraft (#48).\n\n27A.

Munro) describes Blake’s color print “The House of Death” and the water color with “Death on a Pale Horse” as #137-38 on 136-39. Both works are illustrated in color.\n\n28.

Austr.: Barr Smith Library, University of Adelaide, 1980.\n\n—This small exhibition was shown at Adelaide 10 years ago (20 Oct.-28 Nov. 1980). With only a few exceptions, the materials consisted of Dent and Blake Trust facsimiles of the illuminated books and of the various water color series. Tolley contributes an “Introduction” on the first two of only 11 pages which make up this elusive pamphlet. It should be noted that this catalogue, which was only recently brought to my attention by G. E. Bentley and Robert Essick, has now been superseded by the updated and considerably expanded list of 1988 that was recorded in Blake 23 (1989-1990): 124 (#19).\n\n29. Martinez, Nancy C., et al. “A Checklist of Explication 1986-87.” Explicator 48 (1989-1990): 66-170.\n\n—A small selection of explicatory studies of Blake’s poetry is listed as #180-92 on 78-79.\n\n30. Modern Language Association of America. 1988 MLA International Bibliography of Books and Articles on the Modern Languages and Literatures: Classified Listings. Vol. 1. New York, NY: Modern Language Association of America, 1989. 65-66.\n\n—While, curiously, not a single article published in the 1987-88 issues of Blake is included in this year’s MLA bibliography, I have to admit that it was only through the MLA’s short Blake section for 1988 (#2740-2779) that I learned of no less than 10 of the articles which are included in the present checklist.\n\n31. Schiff, Gert. William Blake. Exh. cat. Tokyo, Jap.: Nihon Keizai Shimbun, for the National Museum of Western Art, 1990.\n\n—The first major Blake exhibition commissioned by a Japanese museum was shown in Tokyo from 22 Sept.-25 Nov. 1990. The catalogue which commemorates the event can be recommended to anyone seriously interested in Blake’s paintings, drawings, prints, and illuminated books. Even if (like the present writer) one had neither had a chance to see the exhibition, nor is in the habit of reading Japanese, one will find multiple uses for this pictorial encyclopaedia of the artist’s works. As in the Melbourne catalogue (for which see #20, above), all the colored paintings and prints are illustrated in color, including (as #23 and 82) the British Museum’s proof copy of Europe copy a, printed in blue-green monochrome, and a selection of plates from posthumous copy J of Jerusalem from Yale, printed in Tatham’s reddish brown, and (as #12) the Munich copy of Innocence copy Z, retraced at the Bavarian State Library only a few years ago and never before reproduced. Even though the plates are relatively small (four pages from an illuminated book reduced in size to fit one quarto page of the exhibition handbook), the quality of the exhibition reproductions on a non-glossy paper is generally good, though occasionally one notes a lack of the chromatic brilliance and depth of Blake’s coloring. Gert Schiff, who will be known to most readers as the undisputed leading Fuseli scholar of our century, brought a fresh eye to the task of selecting and commenting on the exhibits, and his catalogue entries should help to reopen the discussion over quite a number of assumptions concerning the purpose and content of Blake’s works as a visual artist. Except for the commercial engravings, the full spectrum of Blake’s artistic career is covered; there are examples of his apprentice works and of his begin page 12 | ↑ back to top early historical compositions, almost all of the illuminated books are represented, as are eight of the large color prints; Blake’s water color illustrations and engravings in illustration of Young, the Bible, of Gray, Milton, Chaucer, the Book of Job and Dante dominate the second part of Schiff’s selection. For the first time, the “Larger Blake-Varley Sketchbook” was included (as #81) in a public exhibition at Tokyo. The catalogue, in addition to Schiff’s own essay on “Young Blake and His Moral Rebellion” (5-14; included only in the “second edition” of the catalogue) and to a biblio- and biographical apparatus by Butlin and Beth A. Mandelbaum (281-311), contains contributions by David Bindman, Martin Butlin (who was also responsible for about a third of the catalogue notes), and Robert Essick. Since few will have access to copies of the authors’ original typescripts (which helped me with the present note), we can only hope that a publisher for an English-language version of the entire volume will soon be found. Though there is a handlist of the works on view in English appended to the main body of text (see 265-76), it would be a pity indeed if the commentary in the catalogue section (53-264) were to remain inaccessible to future commentators of the English-speaking countries. The same is true of Butlin’s introductory essay on “William Blake 1757-1827” (15-22) and especially his important summary of “The Evolution of [Blake’s] Visual Means of Expression” (33-39), of Essick’s newly revised account of “Blake and the Profession of Printmaking” (23-32), and of Bindman’s article, entitled “‘My own mind is my own church’: Blake, Paine and the French Revolution” (40-51). It was extremely sad to learn that Gert Schiff, who was a serious and profoundly knowledgeable scholar with an equally impressive capacity for true friendship (including critical “opposition”), did not live to see the exhibition he had organized. The translation of this catalogue, which turned out to be the last of his contributions to the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century art history, would be a fitting tribute to one who is missed by all who knew him.\n\n32. Simpson, David. “Recent Studies in the Nineteenth Century.” Studies in English Literature 1500-1900 30 (1990): 715-48.\n\n—Simpson’s research report incorporates a couple of brief mentions and two short reviews of books of Blakean interest, such as Paglia’s (which is severely criticized, see 717), Pearce’s Para/worlds (718), Welburn’s Truth of Imagination (720), Ault’s Narrative Unbound (724-25), or Youngquist’s Madness and Blake’s Myth (725-26). Ault’s study of The Four Zoas is here praised as one of “the most complex and challenging books of the year on romanticism and, albeit sometimes inadvertently, on ‘theory’” (725).\n\n33. [Sotheby’s]. The Collection of The Garden Ltd.: Magnificent Books and Manuscripts: Conceived and Formed by Haven O’More. New York, N.Y.: Sotheby’s, 1989.\n\n—The catalogue for the O’More sale on 9-10 Nov. 1989, including some important Blake lots (#165-68). “The Tyger” from Songs copy D, the title page for Thel copy A, and two posthumous pulls (copy c) from the “Preludium” pages for Europe are illustrated in color. Readers ought to make sure they do not miss the “biographical statement . . . furnished by Mr. Haven O’More” on the penultimate page of text! There, they will learn that the “inspired” collector who was trained “to think and to feel in terms of high endeavor and noble service” from his earliest youth onwards “is a direct descendant of three of the most illustrious men of all time.” And on it goes in the same vein: further interesting details concerning O’More’s “pursuit of knowledge” are modestly publicized, and the statement supplies some curious insights into the motives at work behind the formation of a collection of books which was aimed “at nothing less than material of the greatest rarity, in the most superb possible condition” and intended for “a new sacred city,” with a view to help in paving the way “for the coming movement toward the stars.” All sold out at auction?\n\n34. Thorslev, Peter L., Jr. “Recent Studies in the Nineteenth Century.” Studies in English Literature 1500-1900 29 (1989): 763-806.\n\n—This extensive review of current scholarly and critical literature in nineteenth-century studies contains brief notes on Friedman’s Fabricating History (764-65), Deane’s The French Revolution and Enlightenment in England (765), McGann’s Literature of Knowledge (766, and critical of the Blake essay), Kroeber’s Romantic Fantasy (767), Robinson’s The Walk (770), Eaves’s edition of Damon’s Dictionary, and of Fuller’s Heroic Argument (771).\n\n35. Ward, Roger, and Mark S. Weil. Master Drawings from the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, Missouri. Exh. cat. St. Louis, MO: Washington University Gallery of Art, 1989.\n\n—On show at St. Louis from 22 Sept.-3 Dec. 1989, this exhibition of selected holdings from the drawings collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum included—between Dürer and Alma-Tadema—Blake’s “Nimrod, or ‘Let Loose the Dogs of War’” (Butlin 1981, #331). The drawing is reproduced on page 48 of the catalogue.\n\n36. Wright, John. William Blake’s Illuminated Works 1788-1988. Exh. cat. n. p. [Ann Arbor, MI]: Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, The U of Michigan Library, 1988.\n\n—This small catalogue accompanied what I believe to have been the only exhibition commemorating the bicentennial of “W Blakes Original Stereotype.” Some 45 items, mostly modern facsimiles of Blake’s illuminated books, were on show (22 Feb.-2 Apr. 1988) and are here listed in brief bibliographic entries that were supplied by the staff of the Department of Rare Books. Besides a short introduction, John Wright has contributed an essay which (on seven of the unnumbered pages) discusses “Blake’s Medium,” “Plates, Prints and Illuminations,” and “Facsimiles and Reproductions.” In closing, Wright suggests that after 1812 Blake was actively interested in creating a “Stereoptic Art,” and that his readers may for themselves “experience stereoscopic effects” by patiently gazing at pages from the illuminated books with the help of a magnifying glass.\n\n37. Yanagi, Sori, ed. William Blake (Great Encounter: Yanagi and Blake). Exh. cat. Tokyo, Jap.: Japan Folk Crafts Museum, 1990.\n\n—The second Japanese Blake exhibition of the year 1990 commemorizes the “Great Encounter” between Blake and Sôetsu (or Muneyoshi) Yanagi who, in 1914, published a study of Blake and then went on to become the founder of the Mingei (folk crafts) movement in Japan. While there is a “List of Plates” (97-102) and a mention by the editor of “the original engravings” sent by G. E. Bentley “for display” (3), there is no list of works on view or a proper catalogue. Therefore, it is difficult to decide which of the works that are illustrated in the exhibition handbook were actually on show 1 Sept.-28 Oct. 1990. The book includes 27 color reproductions of Blake’s prints and paintings (33-56), most of which reminded me of the sets of color postcards that have been issued by the British Museum, the Tate Gallery, and other institutions. A selection from Blake’s engraved works dominates the section of monochrome plates; these, however, also include a few reproductions of stoneware by Bernard Leach, of a letter from Yanagi to Leach, begin page 13 | ↑ back to top and of Yanagi’s publication on Blake (57-96). The introductory essays are printed in Japanese and English. In “A Delightful Exhibition on ‘A Great Encounter of William Blake and Soetsu Yanagi’” Bunsho Jugaku, an old friend of Yanagi, relates a few of his reminiscences. At the age of 90 he comments on the central role played by Leach in spreading Blake’s reputation in Japan during the early years of our century, and he tells of the two years during which he co-edited with Yanagi the journal Blake and Whitman (9). “William Blake and the Empire of the Imagination” by G. E. Bentley, Jr. introduces the Japanese public to some of Blake’s central ideas (10-21), while Kimiyoshi Yura’s “The Great Encounter: Sôetsu Yanagi and William Blake” (22-31) introduces Western students of Blake to Yanagi’s work. The reference section of the volume consists of a “Chronology of Important Dates” and a “Selected Bibliography” for the study of Blake (104-09).\n\nCritical Studies\n\n38. *Ackland, Michael. “Ingrained Ideology: Blake, Rousseau, Voltaire and the Cult of Reason.” Literature and Revolution.

Antithetical Essays in Literary Criticism and Liberal Education. Tallahassee, FL: Florida State UP, 1990. $29.95 cloth/$19.95 paper.\n\n—Adams employes the word “liberal” to describe “the sort of education” that will function in a “liberating” way. It is not without justification then that he describes his approach to a restructuring of academic procedure as “neo-Blakean.” The collection places Adams’s more recent contributions to the literary criticism of Blake’s writings, most published in the course of the past decade, in a new perspective: the essays “move from an initial statement about [the] reading of Blake through a series of critical essays into a final group devoted to educational issues” (xi). Seven of the 17 chapters that make up the book are concerned with Blake’s writings and/or with the exemplary character that Adams assigns to them for a theory of liberal education. Readers will find reprints of “The Dizziness of Freedom; or, Why I Read William Blake” (3-17), “Synecdoche and Method” from Critical Paths (21-51), “Must a Poem Be a Perfect Unity?” (52-59), “Titles, Titling, and Entitlement To” (111-43), and “Revisiting Reynolds’ Discourses and Blake’s Annotations” (184-98). “Blake’s Cities: Verbal Cities” (199-205), and a “Neo-Blakean Prolegomena to an Unlikely Academic Structure” (272-87) are printed here for the first time. With these chapters, Adams’s impressive contribution to an understanding of some central issues in the interpretation of Blake’s works is now easily accessible. Regardless of what one thinks of Adams’s account of the “proper organization of the liberal arts and sciences” (275), his demonstration that “critical endeavors” can still be “closely related to and informing and informed by . . . teaching” (xi), his commitment to issues of educational theory and his concern for the “liberating” potential of a reformed university system are certainly challenging. And while personally I would want to take issue (in terms of Adams’s demands for teaching the history of criticism) with a somewhat anecdotal and sloppy approach to an analysis of what happened to the theory of criticism and critical value judgments in the late 1960s and early 1970s (see 277), I found that Adams’s “[appropriation of] four ideas from William Blake” (272) for the construction of an “Unlikely Academic Structure” is a generally rewarding enterprise, well worth the attention of all those who are “trying to sustain the creative conflict of myth and antimyth” (286) in the practice of their teaching.\n\n40. *Alexander, Meena. “‘Falling fire’: The Negativity of Knowledge in the Poetry of William Blake.” Poetics of the Elements in the Human Condition II: The Airy Elements in Poetic Imagination: Breath, Breeze, Wind, Tempest, Thunder, Snow, Flame, Fire, Volcano . . ., Ed.

Baine, Rodney M. “Blake’s Dante in a Different Light.” Dante Studies 105 (1987): 113-36.\n\n—Summing up previous interpretations of the water colors and engravings, Baine starts out from questioning that “Blake’s Dante, the most powerful artistic recreation of The Divine Comedy,” has to be considered “a perversion . . . a travesty of Dante” (113). Following an impressive critique of the literature on the Dante series from Rossetti and Yeats to Roe and Klonsky, the author reaches the conclusion that “the current notion that in the Purgatorio and the Paradiso Blake was burlesquing Dante” is completely mistaken. “On the contrary, Blake never ceased to insist that Dante’s vision was true; and in his designs for the Earthly Paradise and the Paradiso Blake presented an understanding and sympathetic refinement of that vision” (134). The new light thrown by Baine on Blake’s illustrative interpretation of Dante’s Divina Commedia, then, differs a lot from the “antagonistic” (113) understanding that until recently figured as received opinion in Blake studies. At the same time, it brings out the contours of a fully revised grasp of Blake’s meaning in the water colors and the engraved series, a revision that in many respects is reminiscent of the results of David Fuller’s study of 1988 and of Tinkler-Villani’s recent book (see Blake 23 [1989-1990]: 131 [#73], and #186, below). Since the arguments presented by these scholars mutually complement and reinforce each other, it is important to point out that the present article was accepted for publication in 1986 and that the 1987 volume of Dante Studies did not appear in print until 1990. Baine’s and Fuller’s articles and the book by Valeria Tinkler-Villani all must have been written and then have been in production at much the same time, with none of the authors knowing the work of the others. This, I think, lends additional weight to their findings. But even those readers who, unlike the present writer, do not agree with the central arguments presented by Fuller and Baine will be grateful for their endeavor in reopening the debate over Blake’s Dante designs in a most challenging and certainly productive manner.\n\n48. Beer, John. “Blake’s Energy and Vision.” Romantics to Early Victorians. Ed. Boris Ford. Cambridge Guide to the Arts in Britain 6. Cambridge, Cambs.: Cambridge UP, 1990. 62-68.\n\n—Besides this elegantly written introduction to Blake’s writings, the volume contains numerous other passing references to his poetry. In addition, there is a brief discussion of his art in the context of British eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting by Michael Rosenthal (see 133-35) who, not surprisingly, places Blake in one line with Fuseli (see 133) and Flaxman (see 135), before turning to West and Northcote as representatives of a more “traditional” style of history painting (see 135-36).\n\n49. Bentley, G. E., Jr. “Blake and Wedgwood.” Blake 24 (1990-1991): 249-50 [for which read 33-34].\n\n—A highly speculative attempt to supplement the Blake Records Supplement by identifying young William Blake as Flaxman’s assistant in the execution of the ceiling paintings at Wedgwood’s Etruria Hall in 1784-85. All of the thin evidence is entirely circumstantial.

E., [Jr.]. “Blake as a Book-Illustrator: The Master of the Book-Arts versus the Trade.” Aligarh Journal of English Studies 13 (1988): 171-95.\n\n—This essay is the published version of Bentley’s paper for the Art Gallery of Ontario symposium on 5 Feb. 1983. Employing materials from his forthcoming study of late eighteenth-century book illustration, Bentley’s article succeeds in concisely locating Blake’s peculiar position in the tradition of British book illustration. For another paper, read on the same occasion, see #98, below.\n\n51. Bentley, G. E., Jr. “Blake’s Works as Performances: Intentions and Inattentions.” Text: Transactions of the Society for Textual Scholarship 4 (1988): 319-41.\n\n—The author starts out with a discussion of “The Tyger” and from a similar point of view as provided in greater detail by John Grant’s recent study of the same illuminated poem (see #101 and, in addition, #127 and 156, below). “The vision of terror evoked by the poem . . . must be contrasted, complemented, controlled by the smug pussycat of the design, which Blake intended his reader to absorb before he has apprehended the poem” (319). Bentley makes a similar statement in his review of the new edition of Stedman’s Narrative (listed as #487, below); here this example of the peculiar relationship between various media in Blake’s productions is employed to draw attention, once more, to the peculiar problems that the editor of the printer-poet’s works is confronted with (see 321-30). While admitting that in “most copies of Blake’s works in Illuminated Printing, the text itself is invariable” (329), the author points out the critical limitations even of the most trustworthy facsimiles if compared with a variorum edition (see 323-29). The latter is said to be more important, however, where the poet’s works in conventional typography, especially Poetical Sketches (see 329-30), are concerned, though it is itself insufficient to give an account of the visual variants in the corpus of the illuminated books. The final section of the essay therefore discusses the changing order of the plates in separate copies of most of the illuminated books. Bentley finds (as others have done before) that the “only solution appropriate to Blake is to reproduce each variant copy, that is, each coloured copy, in a separate facsimile. Each variant copy produced by Blake should be treated as a separate ‘performance,’ with its own integrity, its own beauty, its own raison d’être. Blake did not produce a ‘standard’ and invariable literary work” (334).\n\nbegin page 15 | ↑ back to top\n\n52. Bentley, Gerald [i.e., G. E.], Jr. “The Shadow of Los: Embossing in Blake’s Book of Urizen.” Art Bulletin of Victoria 30 (1989): 18-23.\n\n—Bentley comments briefly on the differences between the National Gallery of Victoria’s impression from Urizen, plate 21, and “other performances of the same plate” (18). He describes what was actually etched on the copper plate and what was added only in the color-printing process (19-22), and then concentrates on the “heavy pressure used in printing this impression of Urizen plate 21 [which] is very unusual” (19). Here, the author quotes Ted Gott’s plausible hypothesis that such “heavy press-work would answer Blake’s need for additional force to gain a reasonable second impression from the thinner layer of pigment left on the plate without re-inking” the plate in the process of color printing (19; see #20, above). In addition, Bentley believes that the embossing, with the “fairly deep recesses” (22) it has created in the paper of the Melbourne pull, calls for a partial revision of Robert Essick’s arguments concerning the “shallow etching” of Blake’s relief etchings and the light printing pressure Blake would usually employ (see 22). However, similar embossing effects can be observed in some of the pages of the Munich copy R of Visions of the Daughters of Albion. While in the color-printed areas of that copy I cannot make out any indications for their having been pulled without previous re-inking, it was printed on rather strong 1794 Whatman paper. Therefore, it seems possible to me that, according to the physical properties of the various papers he employed and according to the varying dampness of the printing paper, Blake would also vary the precise amount of printing pressure. It would follow then, that the printing qualities of the paper, not just the problem of inking and re-inking the plate, occasioned the varying amount of (the visibility of the) printing pressure. On the other hand, the copy at the Bavarian State Library certainly shows no relief embossment extreme enough to necessitate a revision of Essick’s arguments for shallow etching. These arguments, it ought to be remembered, are based on the physical evidence of the only fragment from one of Blake’s relief etched plates which has survived. The embossed paper of the Melbourne print certainly is an irrefutable indication for high printing pressure; yet the differences between light and heavy embossing in eighteenth-century papers are a matter of microscopic measurements, and how they could possibly yield more than an approximate indication for the absolute depth or the shallowness of the actual biting of the copper remains unclear to the present writer.\n\n53.

Bentley’s research is based on the documents discovered and first published by Stanley Gardner, whose “purpose is largely critical”; Bentley’s own purpose in the present commentary on some of the materials from Blake Records Supplement is “largely historical” (80).\n\n54.

These radical Christian visionaries evince a social vision which anticipates and parallels major Marxian tenets.” Bethea “believe[s]” and, one should think, attempts to demonstrate that “their writings are primarily concerned to confront what they perceived as the false, distortive ideologies of their epochs with what might be termed visionary warfare.” The introduction surveys “the various manners in which all three of these visionaries have been wrongly branded as mystics,” stressing “how antithetical to mysticism their works are.” For a somewhat similar approach which, however, is considerably broader and less specialized in perspective, see #137, below.\n\n56.

Briganti, Giuliano. “‘One of the most unexplored regions of art is the world of dreams’ (Fuseli).” Fantastic and Visionary Painting. Trans. Terence Rogers. Bloomsbury Collection of Modern Art. London: Bloomsbury Books-Godfrey Cave, 1989. 7-9.\n\n—A brief chapter on Fuseli and Blake in a book designed for the occultist’s coffee-table. Its author dived deep into the world of the “unexplored.” Unfortunately, he seems to have been fascinated by his findings to such an extent that he decided never to come up, where his results might have been examined in the cold light of reason. And yet, in “the light of what we have learnt about analytical psychology it seems reasonable [!] to assume that behind all those signs of inner conflict and all the obscure prophetic presentments [of Blake] lay a host of reallife experiences” (9)—after all, here is an insight that is beyond dispute. There are brief biographies of Blake and Fuseli at the end of the slim quarto volume (see 83 and 86) and the two artists are represented with nine out of the 60 color plates that are the book’s raison d’être. The original Italian edition on which this English translation is based was published 20 years ago as Pittura fantastica e visionara dell’ottocento in the “Mensili d’ arte” series (Milan, It.: Fratelli Fabbri, 1969). I also own a copy of a German translation by Linde Birk, published as Phantastische Malerei im 19. Jahrhundert in the “Galerie Schuler” series 15 years before this English language version (Munich, W. Ger.: Schuler Verlagsgesellschaft, 1974); there, the Fuseli and Blake references are found on pages 12-14, 87 and 90.\n\n62.

Ed. Donald Palumbo. Contributions to the Study of Science Fiction and Fantasy 31. Westport, CT: Greenwood, 1988. 41-51.\n\n—For Bromberg it is quite clear that “Blake’s illustrations of other poets’ works must be understood as conscious discussions between his visual and their verbal representations.” While the same, of course, may be said of any pictorial representation of some passage from a literary source, it soon becomes evident that in this case more than a mere truism is meant. Following Roe (rather than joining the more recent attempts at a demystification of Blake’s Dante water colors), the author examines the “landscapes and architecture in Blake’s water color visions of Dante’s Inferno and Purgatorio [that] compose the most elaborate and abundant visual images of the state he called Ulro in his own poetry, a nightmare world of solipsistic alienation” (41). The water colors, of which three are reproduced, are described in terms that the author has borrowed from Blake’s own writings (to the effect that Dante’s voice here seems all but suffocated), and the result of such circular reasoning comes as no surprise: the Dante designs are seen to embody “Blake’s central criticism of the mythology and theology that inspired Dante, whom he sees as still enslaved by dualism and the Natural Religion of judgment” (50). The direction of Bromberg’s argument may well be correct, and yet methodologically her procedure seems arbitrary to such an extent that on its basis any intelligent person would find no difficulty (with a little help from Erdman’s Concordance) in proving or refuting almost any interpretation she or he happens to prefer.

Brooks, Harold F. “Blake and Jung: Blake’s Myth of the Four Zoas and Jung’s Picture of the Psyche.” Aligarh Critical Miscellany 1 (1988): 47-74.\n\n—The author is here concerned with “the parallel of Blake’s and Jung’s procedures,” and he finds that “Blake in his myth of the Four Zoas and Jung in his depiction of the psyche begin from similar materials similarly regarded. They work them up into intelligibility by comparisons in which Eastern religion and Gnosticism are prominent, and to which alchemical symbolism . . . contributes. Yet for neither does the response to these traditions sever his essential rootedness in that of Christianity . . . To my mind, their parallel methods were valid, and since they were independently pursued, the resulting pictures of the psyche and its dynamics go to confirm each other” (66).\n\n64.

To the present writer this part of Butlin’s group of drawings represents a very questionable addition to the Blake corpus, and the respective arguments in begin page 17 | ↑ back to top Butlin’s essay may well represent a classic example for the tricky and—in three out of six cases—possibly vicious circle of what Jacob Burckhardt termed the “Attribuzlertum” (attributionizing) of art historians. On the other hand, one certainly ought to congratulate the author (and David Bindman) on the discovery of the three other drawings, including the retraced study for “The Complaint of Job” (with a sketch for Gray’s “The Bard” on the verso).\n\n67.

Chayes, Irene H. “Blake’s Ways with Art Sources II: Some Versions of the Antique.” Colby Quarterly 26 (1990): 28-58.\n\n—Irene Chayes attempts “to identify the likely sources of Blake’s knowledge of particular works” and “to reconstruct as well as possible his ways of adopting and putting to use in his own work the varied images and motifs he encountered” (28). To do so, the author outlines the “means through which Blake would have had knowledge of antique art” (29), and considers his “uses of images, mainly figural, from a necessarily limited selection of antique sculpture” (30); next, she turns to Blake’s “borrowings” and “adaptions” (37) of visual motifs first coined in antique sculpture, and argues for the reliefs published in Bartoli’s Admiranda Romanorum Antiquitatum and similar collections as a source for Blake’s Tiriel designs and various images in the illuminated books. An investigation into Blake’s use of engraved gems as models for some of his figures leads up to “broader questions” concerned with “a fundamental and unresolved stylistic conflict in Blake’s own art . . . between the classical . . . and what in theoretical terms he came to call the ‘Gothic’” (56).

Clark, David Ł. “‘The Innocence of Becoming Restored’: Blake, Nietzsche, and the Disclosure of Difference.” Studies in Romanticism 29 (1990): 91-113.\n\n—Clark starts out from Yeats’s assertion that “Nietzsche completes Blake” (91), and he closes (see 112-13) by asking (in what seems to be intended as some kind of provocation): “What if Blake completes Nietzsche?” To “develop the parallels” (91) between the poet and the philosopher, Clark first turns to an examination of the Marriage in the light of Nietzsche’s Genealogy of Morals and The Will to Power (see 91-96). He then examines Jerusalem and Blake’s ideas of\n\nchaos, Eden, the Fall, and “the status of the logocentric endeavor which is so strongly inscribed in the text.” The philosopher, Clark finds, “causes us to read Blake differently,” yet at the same time the poet “may in turn cause us to reread Nietzsche” (112).

Adelaide, S. Aus.: Centre for British Studies, U of Adelaide, 1990.\n\n—The volume contains three essays which, “along with a fourth, by John Beer . . . were first presented at a Symposium held at the University of Adelaide on 21 July 1989” (6). Two of the papers now published are on Blake. Michael J. Tolley examines “Marriages of Heaven and Hell: Blake’s Enigmatic Title-Page” (8-24) and finds that “Blake has deliberately confused his title in order to make the reader question whether what is truly desirable is one Marriage of Heaven and Hell . . . or a multiplicity of particular marriages, in and through which might persist the possibility of progress” (16). Nelson Hilton’s essay is concerned with the reader’s construction of the singer-subject in “‘I’ Sings Blake’s Songs” (25-48). He exemplifies this process by re-reading “The Lamb” (28-29), “Infant Joy” (29-30), “The Little Black Boy” (30-37), and “London” (37-39) with his usual alertness to phenomena of the sound and polysemous meaning of Blake’s words, before he investigates the “possible Biblical contexts for ‘To Tirzah’” (46), with some surprising results. In their preface (1-6) the editors usefully question “the traditional notion of a Romantic movement” (4) and supply some broader contexts for the essays themselves.\n\n74. Cooper, Andrew M. “Blake and Madness: The World Turned Inside Out.” ELH 57 (1990): 585-642.\n\n—The author has chosen for his study a path that has rarely been trodden in modern Blake criticism (but see #203-04, below, for an alternative approach to the problem of “madness”). His far-ranging examination of Blake’s imagery, both pictorial and poetical, attempts to arrive at a new understanding of “Blake’s anti-ideological ethic” (634) and of his concept of self-annihilation. In order to do so, Cooper follows up a problem which begin page 18 | ↑ back to top had been posed by Mitchell in 1982 and urges “a return to the old question of Blake’s madness despite its ostensible vulgarity” and to a consideration of “the subjective dimension” (585) which, however, he is considering as part of a much larger sociohistorical milieu.\n\n75. Corti, Claudia. “I Trasgressori di William Blake.” Annali anglistica 31.1/2 (1988): 85-106.\n\n—Corti studies the “paradigm of transgression” in Blake’s writings on multiple “levels of operation” and in all “its various forms” (87). She also outlines a “transgressive” tradition, leading from Blake to Bloch or Altizer, in order to describe Blake’s continuing importance in modern thought.\n\n76. Cox, Philip. “‘Unnatural refuge’: Aspects of Pastoral in William Blake’s Epic Poetry.” Dissertation Abstracts International 50 (1989-1990): 2904A. U of York.\n\n—Philip Cox has written a detailed thesis which supplies a critical reexamination of the ground previously covered in David Wagenknecht’s monograph of 1973: “the role played by traditions of pastoral poetry in the work of William Blake.” Before “looking at the social and literary relationship between pastoral and epic poetry,” the author presents “an analysis of various works by Cowper and Coleridge, and a study of Blake’s Thel, . . . [of the] sophisticated use of pastoral in the early Poetical Sketches . . .[and of] the way in which pastoral is made socially relevant in Songs of Innocence. . . . The Four Zoas is examined . . . in light of a discussion of Dyer’s georgic poem The Fleece.” As is indicated by the quotation that serves as the title for Cox’s dissertation, Milton is studied in detail (chapters 4 and 5), demonstrating “how it rejects the temptations of conventional pastoral and commits itself to a return to the city.” In Jerusalem Cox sees the optimism that informs the narrative of Milton “compromised by the difficulties which Blake experienced in his own life after his return from Felpham. Nonetheless, the poem ends in a triumphal vision” which the author sees in part as “a re-working of pastoral themes and concerns.” Throughout the thesis it is “argued that Blake engages with pastoral conventions in order to challenge what he sees as their innate conservatism. This results in a new, politically radical use of the pastoral.” For a review of a closely related paper which the author read at the 1990 Twickenham Blake conference see #144, below. As a complementary account of Blake’s looking “towards a redeemed city” Sanzo’s recent article (see #172, below) ought to be consulted; see also #44, above.\n\n77. De Luca, V.

Doskow, Minna. “William Blake and the Wheels of Compulsion.” History and Myth: Essays on English Romantic Literature. Ed. Stephen C. Behrendt. Detroit, MI: Wayne State UP, 1990. 53-72.\n\n—In order to “understand Blake’s relation to the history of ideas—his reactions to, and his understanding and transformation of, philosophic thought,” the author studies “the use he made of particular philosophic ideas in his poetry” (53). She looks with scrutiny at the role of an “unholy triumvirate” (55) that, under changing names, was assigned to Bacon, Newton, and Locke in Blake’s writings—and she asks important questions. “Looking at Blake’s choice of philosophical targets, one is startled at the presence there of the political liberals of his time. It is not immediately obvious why he chooses Locke, Voltaire, and Rousseau to symbolize human repression and the oppressive forces rampant in Europe when these philosophers, like Blake himself, object to the reigning tyrannical European monarchies, enunciate democratic principles, and justify rights of political revolution” (55-56). Doskow further discusses Blake’s critique of Berkeley, Hume, and Voltaire as well as the painter-poet’s “imaginative alternative” (70) which transforms “philosophical argument . . . into art through imaginative vision, myth, and symbolic action” (71). See also #38 and 72, above.\n\n81. East, Gloria Williams. “Degree of Consistency in Blake’s Myth through 1798.” Dissertation Abstracts International 51 (1990-1991): 167A. U of South Florida.\n\n—The author’s aim in writing this dissertation has been to both expand and refine “previous investigations by distinguishing between pictorial and poetic messages present in the early stages of Blake’s myth, as expressed in The Songs of Innocence and Experience [sic] up through his Minor Prophecies.” The “degree of consistency” East has been able to establish is measured against six “major postulates, in place at the onset of Blake’s myth, [which] remain constant through the period of investigation. They are: (1) Primacy of the Imagination, (2) Contrary States, (3) Universal Jesus, (4) Human Form Divine, (5) Imprisoning Effect of the Body, and (6) Revolution.” Though East is prepared to admit that during the 1790s “the thrust of [Blake’s] philosophy changed to place more emphasis upon Revolution,” the “results of this study” have led the author to the conviction “that Blake was largely systematic in his portrayal [?] of a ‘composite art’ of poetic and pictorial messages in his mythology.”\n\n82. Erdman, David V., ed. Blake and His Bibles. Locust Hill Literary Studies 1. West Cornwall, CT: Locust Hill P, 1990. $30.00 cloth.\n\n—Mark Trevor Smith supplies an “Introduction” (xi-xvii) with brief summaries to this collection of original essays, pointing out that it is their “business” to distinguish “between Blake’s spiritual understanding of the Bible and a natural understanding.” The authors, in one way or another, are all concerned with the “two opposing ways” in which “Blake re-creates the Bible . . .: he re-writes by repeating, imitating, honoring, but he also re-writes by denying, contradicting, making new” (xi). Three of the essays are concerned primarily with Blake’s imagery in the Night Thoughts water colors, in the Bible, and in the Milton illustrations, while the other three examine Blake’s verbal reaction towards Watson, his poetic use of biblical references in Jerusalem, and his knowledge of, as well as his creative interest in, Hebrew. All of them are said to pursue “the very Blakean project of using minute particulars to confront mass assumptions, to consolidate error, to find a spiritual understanding of Blake’s Bible” (xii). In a sequel to his earlier studies of Blake’s water color illustrations to the poetry of Milton (see Blake 17 [1983-1984]: 65 [#55]; 23 [1989-1990]: 129 [#58]), J. M. Q. Davies writes about “Apollo’s ‘Naked Human Form Divine’: The Dynamics of Meaning in Blake’s Nativity Ode Designs” (3-40). Florence Sandler presents a historical revision of some one-dimensional assumptions about the position of Bishop Watson and Blake’s annotations in “‘Defending the Bible’: Blake, Paine, and the Bishop on Atonement” (41-70). John E. Grant, one of the editors of the Clarendon edition of the Night Thoughts water colors, is concerned with the Bible as a medium for Blake’s visual critique of Young in “Jesus and the Powers That Be in Blake’s Designs for Young’s Night Thoughts” (71-115). Mary Lynn Johnson expands and particularizes (with some begin page 19 | ↑ back to top overlap) her earlier studies of Blake’s Bible illustrations (see Blake 21 [1987-1988]: 58 [#67]; 23 [1989-1990]: 134 [#96]) in a study of “David’s Recognition of the Human Face of God in Blake’s Designs for the Book of Psalms” (117-56). Mark Trevor Smith is “Striving with Blake’s Systems” (157-78) in an essay that concentrates on “the Reuben episodes and the birth of Jesus, because these two Bible allusions are the longest and most powerful examples . . . of the paradoxical combination of system-smashing and system-constructing” (158) in Jerusalem. Finally, Sheila A. Spector gives a detailed account of “Blake as an Eighteenth-Century Hebraist” (179-229) in the intellectual and social context of eighteenth-century Hebraism. In this continuation of her earlier wo"
