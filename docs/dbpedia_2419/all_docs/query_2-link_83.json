        "text": "Welcome to the web site for the Flax Pond Marine Laboratory located on the north shore of Long Island, at 15 Shore Drive, Old Field, New York, 11733 U.S.A. The marine laboratory is operated for research purposes by the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences of Stony Brook University. The laboratory building and the Flax Pond Tidal Wetland Area are owned by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.\n\nThe Flax Pond Marine Lab is an active research and instructional facility involved in investigating fundamental problems affecting marine fisheries on regional and national scales. The lab is located at Flax Pond, a 0.6 km² preserve that encompasses an entire tidal wetland area. The tidal marsh is located between Crane Neck Point to the west and Old Field Point to the east at 40 deg. 57.778 min. North latitutde and 73 deg. 8.216 min. West longitude.\n\nThree main goals of the laboratory are:\n\nProvide facilities for scientists conducting marine science research;\n\nProvide educational and research training opportunities in marine science for students at all levels\n\nIncrease public awareness of marine sciences.\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe Flax Pond Marine Laboratory, built in 1969, is a compact, single-story structure with a total of 725 m² of space. A central entryway divides the smaller west wing-dry labs and offices-from the largest east wing-wet (running water) labs, seawater system and pumps. Salt Water is supplied to the lab from a deep sea water well with a salinity of 27 ppt and a temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit. Fresh water is supplied from Suffolk County Water Authority.\n\nThe three wet labs that make up the east wing are furnished with 28 heavy-duty fiberglass sea tables designed for use as shallow-water tanks or as support for deeper-water aquaria, thus providing maximum flexibility to meet varied changing requirements. The tables range in size from 1 x 3 meters to 1.2 x 6 meters and most are free-standing. All tables are plumbed for continuous, 24-hour, sea water flow through an overhead distribution system of 50 mm PVC pipes.\n\nThe west, dry wing of the building, houses two dry labs, two offices, one cold room, and bathrooms. In 1980 a 90m2 greenhouse was added to the south wall of the west wing, and seawater supply was extended to the greenhouse for the cultivation of seaweeds and marine animals under ambient temperature and photoperiods. The greenhouse was completely rebuilt in 2011. It has automated venting, shading, and forced air circulation. Specially designed cultivation towers are available for culturing microalgae and zooplankton.\n\nAs an instructional resource, the Flax Pond tidal marsh is the site of regular, but controlled, field trips for marine biology, botany, and ecology classes. Paths, including a 20 m combined bridge and walkway, have been developed to ensure that damage to the area is limited when it is used as an outdoor classroom. Pathways also provide access to the beach on Long Island Sound and to the stone jetties forming the inlet to Flax Pond. A replacement bridge and nature path will be opened in 2018. This will allow for Upland ecology classes and greater access to the salt marsh and the barrier beach.\n\nAs a research preserve, Flax Pond is a complete salt marsh system in miniature that is well protected from stresses caused by man. These features contributed to its selection as the site for one of the most sophisticated and thorough studies ever undertaken to determine the total energy budget of a salt marsh. It is currently being used by SoMAS scientists to study finfish and shellfish ecology, seaweed growth, and the effects of persistent pollutants, particularly PCBs, on the growth and species diversity of planktonic communities."
