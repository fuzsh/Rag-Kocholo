Originally called Fresh Pond, it derives its name from its use in the 18th Century as site for watering cattle and for \"retting\" flax which was eventually processed into linen.\n\nIn the late 1700's, the domestic flax market was no longer profitable so the decision was made to turn it into a shellfishing area. In 1803, an inlet was dug connecting the marsh to Long Island Sound, creating a salt marsh. Over time the inlet remained relatively permanent but its orientation would change due to storms and sediment transport. After World War II, inlet jetties were installed.\n\nAfter opening the inlet, oysters and clams soon colonized the marsh and a profitable shellfishing industry began. These operations continued until recently when the entire pond was classified as uncertified for the harvest of shellfish.\n\nChilds Mansion\n\nChilds Mansion, a wooden, three-story building, was the main house of Crane Neck Farm when the entire Flax Pond peninsula was under single ownership. Portions of the house date to the 1700s. In 1902, it was sold to Eversley Childs.\n\nUnder Childs' ownership, a miniature replica of the Brooklyn Bridge was built immediately to the west of the current footbridge that crosses a narrow channel in Flax Pond. The bridge supported the rails of a tramway used by the Childs family and house guests to get from the mansion to the beach. This bridge was destroyed by the 1938 Long Island Express hurricane.\n\nIn the 1990s, Stony Brook University refurbished the home. Today it serves as a guest house and conference facility for the university.\n\nFlax Pond Marine Lab\n\nIn 1965, the State University of New York (SUNY) and the New York State Conservation Department, predecessor of today's DEC, signed a Memorandum of Understanding to jointly acquire the Flax Pond property for \"...the perpetual use of the State University of New York (SUNY) and the Conservation Department.\"\n\nDEC's purchase of the property was made with 1960 Parks and Recreation Bond Act funds. This act designated acquisitions for outdoor recreational uses such as hunting, fishing and camping."
