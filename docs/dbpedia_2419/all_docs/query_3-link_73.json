        "text": "Overview\n\nFarmers, ranchers and timber producers can claim exemptions from some Texas taxes when purchasing certain items used exclusively to produce agricultural and timber products for sale.\n\nWho Qualifies for Agricultural and Timber Exemptions?\n\nIf you are a farmer, rancher or timber producer engaged in one of the activities listed below, you qualify for tax exemption on the purchase of certain items used to produce your agricultural and timber products for sale.\n\nAll purchasers, including non-Texas residents, must have a valid agricultural and timber registration number (Ag/Timber Number) issued by the Comptroller to claim exemption from Texas tax.\n\nIf you do not have a valid Ag/Timber Number, you must pay tax to retailers on your purchases.\n\nYour business type must be listed below to qualify for tax exemption on certain items or for an Ag/Timber Number.\n\nWhat Activities Qualify?\n\nfarming or ranching for the purpose of raising agricultural products for sale;\n\nproduction of fiber crops (cotton, hemp, flax, etc.) for sale;\n\ntimber production (including contract logging);\n\nfeedlot operation;\n\ncommercial fish farm operation;\n\nbee keeping;\n\ncustom harvesting;\n\ncrop dusting (as defined by 14 CFR Section 137.3);\n\ngrowing plants for sale in a commercial nursery;\n\na veterinary business that makes farm or ranch calls;\n\nFuture Farmers of America or 4-H; or\n\nteaching an agricultural vocational course.\n\nWhat Activities Do Not Qualify?\n\nhome gardening;\n\nhorse (PDF) racing, boarding, training or trail rides;\n\nrodeos, circuses or zoos;\n\nflorists or similar retailers who maintain plants before sale;\n\nwildlife management and conservation;\n\nhunting and fishing operations, including aerial hunting;\n\npredator control;\n\nwildlife or livestock surveys;\n\ncommercial fishing;\n\ncompanion animal (pet) breeding; and\n\nkennels or other animal boarding businesses.\n\nHow to Apply for a Texas Agricultural and Timber Registration Number (Ag/Timber Number)\n\nTo claim a tax exemption on qualifying items, you must apply for an agricultural and timber registration number (Ag/Timber Number) from the Comptroller. You must include the Ag/Timber Number on the agricultural exemption certificate (PDF) or the timber exemption certificate (PDF) when buying qualifying items.\n\nAg/Timber Number Expiration Dates\n\nAg/Timber Numbers must be renewed every four years, regardless of when the number was first issued. Renewed and new Ag/Timber Numbers expire Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nYou must enter the expiration date on the exemption certificate you give to retailers on your qualifying purchases. If you already have an exemption certificate on file that includes your Ag/Timber Number, you can add the expiration date to the exemption certificate and initial it for the retailer’s records.\n\nWhat You Need Before You Apply\n\nBasic information about your business (such as its name, description and address)\n\nSocial Security number (if you do not qualify for a Social Security number, you must apply by mail and include your national identification number and country of origin on the application)\n\nIf your business is registered with the Texas Secretary of State (SOS), your SOS file number (find your file number using our Taxable Entity Search)\n\nApply Online\n\nIf you don’t already have an eSystems/Webfile account with us, you will first register to create a secure online profile. Otherwise, log on as a returning user. The application takes about 10 minutes to complete. No signature is required, and we will issue your Ag/Timber Number at the end of the application process.\n\nWe will mail you a confirmation letter in five to seven business days after you complete the online application. In the meantime, you can view and print a copy of your confirmation letter (using Adobe Acrobat Reader) upon completing the registration process, or write down your Ag/Timber Number. You can also look up your registration information at any time.\n\nApply on Paper\n\nYou can print the application (PDF) and mail the paper version to us. Allow three to four weeks for processing time.\n\nAdditionally, you can call our Fax on Demand service at 1-800-531-1441, or call 1-800-252-5555 to ask for an application to be mailed to you.\n\nAg/Timber Courtesy Cards\n\nOnce we have processed your application, we’ll send you a confirmation letter with two courtesy cards showing your Ag/Timber Number. These cards are for your convenience. They do not replace the requirement to provide a properly completed exemption certificate, with an active Ag/Timber Number and expiration date, when making tax-exempt purchases.\n\nYou can make copies of the courtesy card, and you can authorize a spouse, employee or other individual to use the Ag/Timber Number to make purchases in your name.\n\nFor example, if three family members operate a farm, one member can apply for an Ag/Timber Number for the farm and all three family members can use it when buying qualifying items. Or, a corporate agricultural or timber operation with multiple employees can obtain one card and number that can be used by all authorized employees for qualifying purchases.\n\nYou are responsible for properly using your Ag/Timber Number, and you can be held liable for its misuse.\n\nRequest Duplicate Confirmation Letter and Courtesy Card\n\nLog on to eSystems/Webfile.\n\nIf you have not used eSystems before, select Sign Up and follow the instructions to create your user profile.\n\nIf you already have a user profile, enter your User ID and Password and select Login.\n\nAfter logging in, take the following steps:\n\nFrom the eSystems menu, select Ag/Timber Exemption under “Other Registration.”\n\nChoose “Returning Ag/Timber Account Maintenance” to maintain your current (active) exemption.\n\nEnter your 11-digit taxpayer number and WebFile number (if applicable).\n\nSelect the ‘Request a Duplicate Confirmation Letter and Courtesy Card’ function from the self-service menu.\n\nConfirm or update your mailing address to ensure the correct address is printed on the letter.\n\nChoose to print and/or email the letter and courtesy card. If email option is chosen, the letter and courtesy card will be sent to the email address listed on your eSystems profile.\n\nQualifying Exempt Purchases\n\nSales and Use Tax\n\nAgricultural and timber producers are not exempt entities, and not all purchases they make are exempt from sales tax.\n\nThere are, however, three ways to purchase items without paying sales tax. Some items are exempt by law, some are exempt when used exclusively for ag/timber purposes and other items qualify for a standard sales tax exemption.\n\nAlways Exempt Purchases – Exemption Certificate Not Required\n\nThe following items are always exempt, so you do not have to give retailers an exemption certificate or any other type of documentation:\n\nseeds and annual plants, the products of which are commonly recognized as food for humans or animals;\n\nseeds and annual plants usually only raised to be sold in the regular course of business (such as corn, oats, soybeans and cotton seed);\n\ncattle, sheep, swine, goats (the products of which are ordinarily food and inspected by the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service);\n\nchickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guineas, squabs ostriches, rheas or emus (the products of which are ordinarily food and inspected by the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service);\n\nhorses, ponies, mules and donkeys;\n\nmedications, tonics, restoratives or other therapeutic preparations (such as vaccines and drenches) purchased with a prescription from a veterinarian (you must either give the retailer a written prescription from a veterinarian or allow the retailer to receive the prescription directly from the veterinarian);\n\nwater; and\n\nfeed for farm animals, ranch animals and wild game, including oats, hay, chicken scratch, wild bird seed and deer corn.\n\nExempt Ag/Timber Purchases – Agricultural or Timber Exemption Certificate and Ag/Timber Number Required\n\nYou must give the retailer a properly completed agricultural or timber exemption certificate showing a current agricultural and timber registration number (Ag/Timber Number) when purchasing these items:\n\nanimals raised to sell as food, but not ordinarily considered food or required to be inspected by the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service, such as rabbits, deer, llamas and bison;\n\nanimals raised and shown by students and teachers in 4H, FFA and similar agricultural vocational groups;\n\nfertilizers, fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, defoliants and desiccants used exclusively to produce timber for sale or on a commercial farm or ranch to produce food or other agricultural products for sale;\n\nmachinery and equipment (including repair or component parts) used exclusively on a commercial farm or ranch to produce food or other agricultural products for sale or to build or maintain roads and water supplies;\n\nmachinery and equipment (including repair or component parts) used exclusively to produce timber;\n\nmachinery and equipment used by an original producer for packing and processing agricultural or timber products;\n\nmachinery and equipment exclusively used in an agricultural aircraft operation, as defined by 14 CFR Section 137.3;\n\ntangible personal property incorporated into a structure used for poultry carcass disposal;\n\ncomponents of irrigation systems used to produce food and other agricultural and timber products for sale;\n\nseedlings used to produce timber for sale;\n\nelectricity and natural gas used in agricultural or timber operations;\n\nservices performed on exempt tangible personal property identified in this list; and\n\ntelecommunications services (as of Sept. 1, 2015) used to navigate machinery and equipment exclusively used on a farm or ranch to:\n\nbuild or maintain roads;\n\nbuild or maintain water facilities; or\n\nproduce agricultural products to be sold in the regular course of business.\n\nOther Exempt Purchases – Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate Required\n\nSome animals and their feed do not qualify for the ag/timber exemption, but do qualify for the standard sales and use tax exemption. You must give the retailer a properly completed Form 01-339, Texas Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate (PDF) when purchasing them. The certificate must specifically explain the exempt purpose for which the animal or feed will be used. You do not need an Ag/Timber Number to buy them.\n\nWork Animals – Animals used exclusively in one of the following work activities qualify for exemption:\n\nherding dogs and animals raised for their products (such as wool or fur), if harvesting those products is their primary purpose;\n\naiding a person with a disability (professionally trained service animals); and\n\nperforming protective services, if the animal has been professionally trained for that specific purpose.\n\nWork animals do not include animals raised, trained or kept as pets or breeding stock or those kept for sport or for show. For example, tax is due on hunting dogs or other animals a game hunting operation purchases and on exotic animals a zoo or circus purchases.\n\nAnimal Feed – Feed for work animals qualifies for exemption. Feed for animals being held for sale in the regular course of business (including dogs, cats, rabbits and exotic animals) also qualifies for exemption.\n\nTo qualify for exemption, the sales and use tax exemption certificate must clearly state the feed is for work animals, animals to be sold in the regular course of business or for breeding stock for animals that will be sold.\n\nPet food is taxable. Pet food prescribed by a veterinarian can be purchased tax free without a sales and use tax exemption certificate.\n\nMotor Vehicle Tax\n\nFarm and timber machines, trailers and semitrailers used primarily for farming, ranching and timber operations (including machines and trailers used primarily in poultry operations and on feedlots) qualify for exemption from motor vehicle tax.\n\nAgricultural Exemption – Farm Machines and Farm Trailers\n\nA farm machine or trailer is exempt from motor vehicle sales and use tax if it is used at least 80 percent of the time in one of the following ways:\n\nto produce grass, food for people, feed for animals or agricultural products for sale; or\n\nby an original producer in processing, packing or marketing their own livestock or agricultural products for sale.\n\nFarm machine – a self-propelled motor vehicle specifically adapted for, and primarily used to:\n\napply plant food, fertilizer and agricultural chemicals in producing crops; or\n\nto distribute livestock feed in raising livestock.\n\nA self-propelled motor vehicle designed or adapted to primarily transport people or agricultural products is not a farm machine.\n\nFarm trailer – a trailer or semitrailer designed for and used primarily on a farm or ranch.\n\nThe term “farm trailer” does not include a motor vehicle designed for sleeping, dressing, lounging, restroom use or meal preparation, even if the vehicle is used to transport livestock or agricultural products.\n\nA farm trailer used more than 20 percent of the time to transport livestock or property to and from competitions, shows, rodeos or other similar uses does not qualify for exemption.\n\nPick-up truck – a pick-up truck is taxable, even if it is registered with farm plates.\n\nTimber Exemption – Timber Machines and Timber Trailers\n\nA timber machine or trailer is exempt from motor vehicle sales and use tax if it is used at least 80 percent of the time in timber operations.\n\nTimber machine – a self-propelled motor vehicle specially adapted to perform a specialized function for use primarily in timber operations, such as land preparation, planting, maintenance or harvesting of commercial timber that will be sold in the regular course of business. An example is a cab chassis with an articulating arm (i.e., grappling arm) for moving logs.\n\nThe term “timber machine” does not include:\n\ncrew vehicles;\n\nfield service vehicles; or\n\nself-propelled motor vehicles specifically designed or adapted to transport timber or timber products, including those designed to transport cargo and adapted with a cargo-loading device.\n\nTimber trailer – a trailer or semitrailer designed for and used primarily in a timber operation.\n\nHow to Claim the Exemption\n\nTo claim exemption from motor vehicle sales and use tax on the purchase of a qualified farm or timber machine or trailer, you must provide the dealer a properly completed Form 14-319, Texas Motor Vehicle Exemption Certificate for Agricultural and Timber Operations (PDF).\n\nThe exemption must also be claimed at the time of titling or registration with the local County Tax Assessor-Collector by entering your current Ag/Timber Number on Form 130-U, Application for Texas Title.\n\nFarm Plates – For information on registering (or renewing registration of) a motor vehicle with farm plates, contact your local county tax assessor-collector or the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles at TxDMV.gov.\n\nMotor Vehicle Rental Tax Exemption\n\nWhen claiming exemption from motor vehicle gross rental receipts tax when you rent qualifying farm or timber machines trailers, you must enter your Ag/Timber Number and expiration date on Form 14-305, Motor Vehicle Rental Tax Exemption Certificate (PDF).\n\nMotor Fuels Tax\n\nMotor fuel is taxed when it is removed from the terminal rack.

You may qualify for a refund on your gasoline purchases, and you may be able to purchase dyed diesel fuel tax free.\n\nYou cannot use your agricultural and timber registration number to purchase motor fuel tax free.\n\nGasoline\n\nYou cannot purchase gasoline tax free; however, you can apply for a refund (PDF) of tax paid on gasoline used in off-highway equipment such as tractors, mowers and generators.\n\nLearn more about gasoline tax.\n\nDiesel\n\nFor state tax purposes diesel fuel is sold in two forms: clear and dyed.\n\nClear diesel is subject to the state highway fuel tax and is intended for highway use.\n\nDyed diesel is not subject to the state highway fuel tax and is intended for off-highway use.\n\nAll purchases of clear diesel fuel are taxable, including clear diesel fuel used in off-highway equipment such as tractors and combines. There is no tax exemption or refund when you purchase clear diesel fuel.\n\nDyed diesel fuel used to power non-highway equipment, such as tractors or combines, can be purchased tax free directly from your fuel supplier. You are not required to have a state fuels tax license when your supplier pumps the dyed diesel directly into the fuel tank of your off-highway equipment. The fuel supplier must maintain the required fuel records and documentation to verify the purchase.\n\nIf you purchase dyed diesel in bulk (fuel supplier delivers dyed diesel into your storage tank), then you will need to apply for one of the following:\n\nForm AP-197, Texas Dyed Diesel Fuel End User Signed Statement Number (PDF) – AG Signed Statement Number – which allows you to purchase up to 25,000 gallons of tax-free dyed diesel per month for exclusive use in agricultural off-highway equipment operated in Texas;\n\nForm AP-197, Texas Dyed Diesel Fuel End User Signed Statement Number (PDF) – DD Signed Statement Number – which allows you to purchase up to 10,000 gallons of tax-free dyed diesel per month for use in off-highway equipment operated in Texas for non-agricultural purposes such as timber operations; or\n\nForm AP-133, Dyed Diesel Fuel Bonded User Number (PDF) – Bonded User Number – which allows you to purchase unlimited amounts of tax-free dyed diesel fuel per month for use in off-highway equipment operated in Texas.\n\nLearn more about diesel fuel tax.\n\nExemption Certificates\n\nAg/Timber Exemption Certificates for Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificates\n\nWhen you purchase an item that is not exempt from tax by law, you must give the seller an exemption certificate to purchase the item tax free. The type of exemption certificate depends on the type of item you are purchasing and how it will be used.\n\nRetailers are not required to accept an exemption certificate. If they choose not to accept an exemption certificate from you on a qualifying item, you must pay the tax and then request a refund of the tax paid from the Comptroller.\n\nAny items you buy tax free must be used in an exempt manner. Otherwise, the exemption will be lost and you will have to pay tax, penalty and interest on those items.\n\nAg/Timber Exemption Certificates for Sales Tax\n\nAn agricultural or timber exemption certificate is required when you claim a sales tax exemption on the purchase of items directly used to produce agricultural and timber products being raised or harvested for sale.\n\nYou must give the retailer a properly completed agricultural or timber exemption certificate that includes your current Ag/Timber Number and expiration date when purchasing qualifying items.\n\nAgricultural – For purchases of items (PDF) used exclusively on a commercial farm or ranch to produce food or other agricultural products for sale, you must give the retailer a Form 01-924, Texas Agricultural Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate (PDF).\n\nTimber – For purchases of items (PDF) used exclusively to produce timber products for sale, you must give the retailer a Form 01-925, Texas Timber Operations Sales and Use Tax Exemption Certificate (PDF).\n\nSales and Use Tax Exemption Certificates\n\nSome animals and their feed do not qualify for the ag/timber exemption, but do qualify for the standard sales and use tax exemption.
