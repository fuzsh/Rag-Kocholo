Riggs; Treas., William Dana Seibert; Sec.. Herbert D.Seibert. Addresses of all. Office of Co. The Financial Situation. The most satisfactory feature of the situation at the moment—and it is a very reassuring feature— is that after last month's stock market panic and upheaval, things are rapidly returning to the normal. Evidences of this are met with on every side. In the first place, the stock market is at length regaining tone, after the violent convulsions which it suffered. It has shown strong rallying tendencies the present week and this, too, on a light volume of business, indicating that as far as the market as a whole is concerned selling pressure is no longer an influence playing havoc with prices. In the second place, brokers'loans are certainly fast getting back to ordinary proportions; indeed, the contraction is at a pace that is as striking as was the previous prodigous rise. A further big shrinkage has occurred the present week in the amount of these loans, and the grand total now is down to $3,587,000,000, which compares with no less than $6,801,000,000 on Oct. 16, showing a contraction in five weeks in 'the huge sum of $3,214,000,000. The release of this immense mass of funds, tied up in speculative loans, is being felt in a revival of the demand for bonds stronger than anything of the kind witnessed for a long while past, attended at the same time by a notable advance in bond prices. We allude not to bonds possessing convertible features, which naturally fluctuate with the market prices of the stocks into which they are convertible, but to ordinary bonds of the better class which during the long period of ascending values in the stock market were out of favor and suffered great depreciation simply because the public taste, spoiled and depraved by the excesses of the stock market, no longer showed any liking for them. As a few illustrations of the advance in bond prices which occurred during the week, Atchison general 4s closed yesterday at 94/ 1 2 against 91 on NO. 3361. Friday of last week; St. Louis-San Francisco cons. 1 2 the pre/ 8 against 86/ 4/ 1 2s closed yesterday at 907 vious Friday; Chic. Mil. St. Paul & Pac. 5s series A 1 2s / 8; N. Y.

Within the last day or two bond prices have been rising so rapidly that in some exceptional instances there has been occasionally a difference of a full point between sales—something quite unusual for bonds of the better grade. Bond prices showed an improving tendency during the early stages of the stock market panic, but subsequently slumped badly both because bonds had to be sold to protect weak stock market accounts and because the owners sold in order to obtain funds with which to buy stocks at the low level to which these latter had fallen. The present rise appears to be of more enduring character, and as such must be regarded as a healthy development and a hopeful sign, insuring •in the near future a market for new bond issues upon which corporate undertakings must depend, now that the craze for stocks has disappeaPed,for the means with which to prosecute development and construction work, without which general business activity cannot be maintained. As another result of the witdrawal of such immense sums from speculative channels, money rates have cheapened in every direction. There have been two further reductions the present week in the rates for bankers' acceptances, the highest type of mercantile paper, and 90-day prime bankers' accept/8% ances are now quoted at only 4% bid and 37 asked. Call money on the Stock Exchange is, of course, in superabundant supply, and the renewal rate for such loans on the Stock Exchange has been marked down to 4/ 1 2%, while in the outside market call money has been obtainable at still lower figures —yesterday at 3%. Even time money on Stock Ex4%. Finally, change collateral has dropped to 5@51/ a rectification of the foreign exchanges, so deeply disturbed for so long a period by the flow of funds to New York from all parts of the world, is taking place, and on Thursday the Bank of England was able further to reduce its discount rate from 6% to 5/ 1 2%,after having marked the rate down from 6/ 1 2% to 6% on Oct. 31. Several other European banks have likewise lowered their discount rates this week, more particularly in Norway, Austria and Ireland. All this reflects steady progress in convalescence and 3208 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE means paving the way for the restoration of normal conditions. In addition, President Hoover is doing his part towards minimizing the effects on trade and business of the collapse of the stock market structure. It is idle to think that the effects of such a calamity can be escaped altogether. We shall have to suffer, very likely suffer deeply, for our follies and errors. The most that can be done, and really the only thing to do, is to guard against men losing their reason and common sense. At such a time confidence becomes completely undermined and men cease having faith in one another. The pendulum now swings as violently in the other direction as it previously did in the contrary direction. Men become timid and afraid where before they proceeded utterly without restraint Contraction becomes the overruling passion; and on the idea that business is going to rack and ruin, just as the stock market did, gloom and fear pervade every step, and they can see nothing but darkness ahead. Such an unreasoning state of things, when applied to everyday affairs, if allowed to persist,and spread, would bring all trade and industry to a complete standstill and result in unemployment and idleness on such a scale as to spell ruin and disaster. It is at such a time that efforts such as the President is making act as a cure and a palliative. The President has had conferences with railroad executives, with leaders in industry and agriculture, and with men prominent in banking and finance, all with the view to preventing any cessation in the ordinary activities of trade and business and for consideration of plans for furthering construction and betterment projects so as to insure continued employment and to maintain business activity unimpaired. From one and all the President has received assurances of co-operation with him in his endeavors and has learnt how extensive and how comprehensive is the program of work laid out for the coming year in all the different departments of human activity, in the carrying out of which no interruption is to be permitted in response to Mr. Hoover's urging and request. All of this is highly beneficial and is sure to be attended with good results. Moreover, it is timely and just what the situation requires, even though, as already stated, it would be too much to expect that the ill consequences of the stock market debauch can be completely overcome,-no matter how resolute the purpose and however well designed the means employed to that end. Contraction is now the order of the day in brokers' loans, and this week's return of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York furnishes new testimony to that effect. Further great shrinkage is disclosed, the grand total of these loans on securities to brokers and dealers by the reporting member banks in New York City showing another reduction in the sum of $585,000,000. This follows $710,000,000 reduction the previous week, $656,000,000 reduction the week before, $1,096,000,000 reduction the week preceding, and $167,000,000 reduction in the last week of October, making the contraction for the five weeks combined 3,214,000,000 and reducing the total from $6,081,000,000 on Oct. 16 to $3,587,000,000 on Nov. 20. The 2 billion dollars below the 1 amount is now over 1/ grand total for Nov. 20 1929 the amount a year ago, at $3,587,000,000 comparing with $5,157,000,000 on Nov. 21 1928. In this week's further shrinkage the [VoL. 129. loans under all the different headings have participated, but especially the loans made by the reporting member banks for their own account, these having been further reduced during the week from $1,156,000,000 Nov. 13 to $853,000,000 Nov. 20. At the same time the loans for account of out-of-town banks have dropped further from $812,000,000 to $704,000,000, and the loans for account of others from $2,204,000,000 to $2,031,000,000. The Federal Reserve Banks in their own statements show no striking changes, though it is to be noted that member bank borrowing has undergone some further reduction during the week, the discount holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions for Nov.20 being reported at $899,558,000 against $971,355,000 Nov. 13, $990,880,000 Nov. 6, and $991,038,000 on Oct. 30. Holdings of acceptances are somewhat lower at $283,831,000 Nov. 20 against $299,512,000 a week ago, but, on the other hand, holdings of United States Government securities have been further enlarged, and are now $326,528,000 against $312,556,000 last week, $292,749,000 Nov. 6, $292,688,000 Oct. 30, and only $135,704,000 Oct. 23. The final result is that total bill and security holdings, which reflects the amount of Reserve credit in use, stand at $1,530,265,000 this week, as against $1,606,304,000 on Nov. 13, $1,637,634,000 on Nov. 6, $1,648,742,000 on Oct. 30, and $1,336,656,000 Oct. 23. It remains to be said that while the Reserve Banks' own holdings of acceptances declined during the week from $299,512,000 to $283,831,000, their holdings of bills purchased for foreign correspondents increased from $508,290,000 to $510,172,000. The stock market this week has shown a greatly improved tone, but has otherwise been without special feature. The rally which occurred last week has been carried still further the present week, and the market is by degrees returning to the normal. On no day of the week has there been the slightest evidence of any distress selling, though views differ as to whether this means that there has been complete liquidation of the impaired accounts which, in the height of the panic, brokers and the banks were obliged to take over. Money tension has completely disappeared and no longer constitutes an element in the stock market, the call loan renewal rate on the Stock Exchange having dropped on Friday to 2%, and call loans outside the Stock Exchange 1 4/ having been made at 3%. After the sharp rally in the closing days of last week there was somewhat of a downward reaction on Monday in the case of a good many stocks, but it did not reach large proportions, inasmuch as there was no distress selling of any great consequence and little pressure of any kind against the market. On Tuesday and Wednesday the upward movement was resumed, the recovery extending all through the Stock Exchange list and being strongly in evidence also on the Curb Exchange. On Thursday some weakness developed at the opening, but it was quickly overcome, after which the market again turned upward. On Friday, notwithstanding the big further contraction in brokers' loans, the ' market showed a sagging tendency and a moderate downward reaction occurred—this having reference mainly to the market leaders. In the majority of cases, nevertheless, net gains were shown for the day.

Fifthly, they have realized that not until the naval technical differences, with meticulous care and after laborious research, have been reduced to their simplest terms can there be made by mutual understanding between the technicians and statesmen a proper statement of these differences which the general public will easily understand.\" Some question was raised this week regarding the actual date of the London conference, pressure having been brought to bear by League of Nations authorities for postponement of the naval conference on the ground that it will clash with the League Council session scheduled for Jan. 20. In London, on the other hand, reports were circulated to the effect that the Council session might be postponed until Jan. 27, and it was affirmed with much assurance in dispatches from the British capital that the date set for the naval conversations will be adhered to. Reports this week from Washington, Tokio and London all indicated that Japan has every intention of insisting upon her demand for a higher ratio of 10,000 cruisers than was allotted to her on capital ships in 1921. Dispatches from Paris reported the effective opening on Tuesday of the preliminary conversations between France and Italy. In Washington, formal announcement of the personnel of the American delegation to the five-power conference was made Wednesday, after much press discussion of suggested objections by Admiral Hilary P. Jones to accompanying the delegation as a naval adviser. The delegation announced by the State Department follows: 3211 be ratified by all six Governments and placed in effect until well into the new year. Work was completed last week by two of the important committees appointed by or provided for at The Hague conference in August. The Bankers Committee, meeting at Baden-Baden, elaborated the statutes and charter of the Bank for International Settlements which is to act as a non-political clearing house for reparations payments, and the deliveries-in-kind committee, meeting at Paris, also finished its preparations for the second conference of Governments. Amends were made by the Belgian delegates to the Bankers Committee last Saturday for their hasty withdrawal from the gathering at Baden-Baden, when the group decided upon Basle as the location of the new bank. The charter and statutes were carried to Brussels by Walter Lichtenstein, Secretary of the conference, and there the signatures of the Belgian delegates, Louis Franck and Paul van Zeeland, were affixed. Belgian acceptance of the documents was made subject, however, to reservations with regard to the bank's seat at Basle, Switzerland, indicating that this question also will be added to the other troublesome items already on the agenda of the second Hague conference. Efforts were made at Paris this week to expedite the work of the committee charged with settlement of the reparations obligations of the non-German defeated States. This body also was authorized by the conference of Governments at The Hague, but progress in its task has been very slow. The Hungarians have persistently refused to include settlement of their optant claims against Rumania in the general settlement, while Rumania, with the support of France, has taken a definite stand for inclusion of such claims. The question produced many bitter disputes in the League of Nations, but no settlement satisfactory to both nations has yet been proposed. The work of this committee is further complicated by a demand of the Bulgarians for a reduction in the reparations payments imposed upon them. The active interest taken by Bulgarians in the question was indicated Monday, when riotous protest meetings were held in Sofia before the French and British legations, causing a two-'hour stoppage of work and a 15-minute cessation of all traffic. Other meetings were held throughout Bulgaria at the same time. Meetings to examine the situation were held in Paris Henry L.

Dr. Leopold von Hoesch, German Ambassador to Paris, has been making every endeavor to secure earlier convocation of the Government representatives at The Hague. According to Berlin dispatches, the Nationalist-Fascist referendum on the Young plan in Germany is doomed to certain defeat, and it is contended, moreover, that this is purely an internal matter which hardly constitutes a valid reason for delaying the second Hague conference. Meanwhile, final evacuation of Belgian troops from German soil will take place at Aix-la-Chapelle Nov. 30, according to Brussels reports, and British evacuation also is to be completed within the next few weeks. Negotiations for disposition of the Sarre Basin before the date fixed by the Treaty of Versailles were begun at the Foreign Office in Paris, Thursday, by representatives of the French and German Governments. Foreign Minister Briand of France, and the late German Foreign Minister, Dr. Gustav Stresemann, are understood to have agreed at The Hague conference in August that discussions on this problem were to precede the final adoption of the Young plan. By the terms of the Versailles Treaty, sovereignty of the Sarre is given to the League of Nations until 1935, when a plebiscite is to be taken to determine whether the area is ultimately to belong to France or Germany. The Sarre coal mines were given outright to France in compensation for those of Northern France destroyed during the war, but provision was made for repurchase of the mines by Germany by negotiation with France. The Basin also was included in the French customs zone, and under this arrangement the combination of Sarre coal interests and Lorraine iron and steel industries was continued under a new dispensation. M.Briand, it is said, agreed to discuss the early return of the Sarre area to Germany partly because of the universal conviction that the plebiscite scheaurea ror 1935 will inevitably result in favor of Germany. Strong delegations to consider the matter were named by both Governments. The German delegates are headed by Herr von Simon, Under-Secretary of State, while the French representatives are headed by Georges Pernot, Minister of Public Works and Right Party leader. After the first formal exchange Thursday morning, the delegates promptly decided to divide the work among three commissions, one to take up the question of the mines, the second to consider the commercial aspects of the Sarre Valley situation, and the third to deal with its juridical aspects. Representations by the German Government for the unconditional return by Britain of all private German property confiscated during the war which remains unliquidated were formally refused last week in behalf of the present Labor Government at London by Philip Snowden, Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was made known in London late last week that a communication to this effect had been addressed by Mr. Snowden on Nov. 11 to the German Ambassador at London. The note, which was drawn up after consultation with the president of the Board of Trade, was described as•similar to a letter addressed by the Chancellor to the German Ambassador in October. The amount involved in the claim is reported to be 115,000,000, a London dispatch to the New York \"Times\" said. Mr. Snowden states in his communication that a draft agreement on the unliquidated Eiou 129. property already has been prepared, and he suggests that it is in the interest of Germany to accept the proposed procedure as early as possible in order to facilitate the carrying out of the recommendations contained in the Young plan. The Reich Government also claims payment to it of all surpluses resulting from the liquidation of German private property after the covering of British private losses in Germany. This claim Mr. Snowden rejected absolutely on the ground that it already has been dealt with on earlier occasions. A great deal of hostile criticism of Mr. Snowden's stand was voiced in Germany when news of the communication was published. It was pointed out in the press that he condemned as a private citizen, in 1926, the procedure which he now supports in his official capacity. In official quarters, however, it was merely remarked that the German Government does not consider the negotiations have definitely ended. It was intimated in Berlin that the German Government will continue the conversations and try to secure a decision in keeping with the recommendations of the experts who drafted the Young plan, that \"liquidation of the issues still pending is to be made in a broad spirit of mutual concessions.\" An explanation of the British position on this matter was made before the House of Commons, Thursday, by Mr. Snowden. The refusal to hand over any sums realized to the German Government was based, he said, on the fact that the British right to retain any surplus was recognized by the Experts' Committee, to be set off against the reduction of Germany's reparations obligations effected by the Young plan. It was, therefore, he held, an integral part of the Experts' plan. Such surpluses were similarly treated in the Dawes plan, and their retention was sanctioned by the Treaty of Versailles in 1920 and the Reparations Commission in 1921. The procedure also had been sanctioned by the interpretations of the tribunal established under the Dawes plan, which twice rejected the German claims to be credited with the proceeds of the liquidation. Mr. Snowden said he had consulted British experts on the Young Committee and had been informed that the matter was fully considered by the experts at Paris. \"It was the intention of the British experts, as it was the intention of all other creditor governments,\" he said, \"that the proceeds of the liquidation of these properties should be retained in accordance with the Versailles Treaty by the creditor powers concerned, and that no part of such proceeds should be returned to Germany. It was only on this understanding that they agreed to recommend reduction of the German obligations, as proposed in the plan.\" The Chancellor claimed, in addition, that Britain had been more, and not less, generous than the other creditor nations to the original owners of enemy property, having made \"compassionate allowances totaling V5,000,000 to individuals.\" An opportunity for debate on the matter was requested by Liberal members of the House. Final steps were taken this week in settlement of the long dispute between France and the United States regarding the right of American Treasury agents to obtain for tariff purposes data in France bearing upon the cost of production of French goods exported to the United States. Treasury agents who had exercised such functions for years were withdrawn from France in 1927, after severe objec- Nov. 23 1929.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE tions to their presence were voiced by French exporters who apparently misunderstood their functions. A reciprocal agreement on the question was announced by the two governments last summer,and the Treasury agents have since returned to France. The terms and scope of the agreement were revealed Tuesday, when the final correspondence between Washington and Paris was made public in both capitals. The exchanges made public consist of a lengthy note from the American Government, delivered to the French Foreign Office on July 26; the French reply of Aug. 9, and two concluding communications, dated Oct. 28 and 29, from the American Charge d'Affaires in Paris to the Foreign Office. The correspondence discloses that James F. O'Neill, of the Treasury Department at Washington, has been designated as the first Treasury Attache of the American Embassy in Paris. In the American note of July 26, the French Government was advised that in deference to its expressed wishes and in an effort to arrive at a satisfactory solution of the question, the Department of State and the Treasury Department had recommended to the Congress of the United States repeal of Section 510 of the Tariff Act. This section requires the Secretary of the Treasury to prohibit the importation of merchandise from any foreign manufacturer or shipper who refuses, upon request of a representative of the United States Treasury Department, to give the latter necessary information so that the appraising office in the United States may be able to find foreign value or export value. \"Thus under the new law, if finally enacted ,\" the note stated, \"it will be entirely optional with the exporter whether he wishes to give to the United States Treasury agent information which is necessary to the appraising officer in determining export value or foreign value. Under the proposed law, when an appraiser is unable to ascertain foreign value or export value of any French merchandise, the Treasury Department will so advise its agent in France and will instruct the agent to call upon the exporter in order to advise the latter of the situation. The agent will, at the same time, offer his services to the exporter with a view to obtaining the information required by the appraising officer in the United States.\" The note explained further that the French exporter may, if he so desires, avail himself of the foreign value or export value, which are the lowest bases of value, at no expense to himself. Assurances were given that any information of a confidential character which it is necessary for the agent to obtain will be held in strictest confidence. It was added, significantly, that the laws of the United 'States provide severe punishment for any officer who should divulge information of this character. After mentioning that Treasury agents are instructed to report facts as they find them, whether they favor the Government or the exporter, the note gave assurances that Treasury agents returned to Prance under any agreement would be officers of long standing and experience, fully versed in the French language, and who will be in every way fully acceptable to the French Government. In accepting this arrangement, the French Government suggested certain conditions which were subsequently found agreeable to the United States. The chief point made by the Foreign Office was that the agents should be attached to American Consulates and 3213s officially accredited to France. it was also asked, by way of reciprocity, that the Washington Govern-ment consent to representatives of the French cue= toms being assigned to the United States on an exactly similar basis. No indication has yet been given by France of an intention to invoke the reciprocal right. Establishment of a 100,000,000 yen credit in. favor of the Yokohama Specie Bank by British and American banking institutions was formally announced in Tokio, Wednesday, as a preliminary to the removal of the embargo on gold shipments from Japan. This step and the consequent return of Japan to fall international utilization of the gold standard have been much discussed in recent months, as Japanese currency slowly crept upward toward gold parity with other exchanges. Announcement of the credit, therefore, caused no surprise. It was arranged at the request of the Japanese Government and the Bank of Japan. The credit is extended is equal parts by British and American banking institutions. The American half is underwritten by J. P. Morgan & Co., Kuhn, Loeb & Co., the National City Bank, and the First National Bank; while the British half is underwritten by the Westminster Bank, Ltd., and associates. Japan is the last of the great Allies of the war to return to the gold standard, having been prevented from restoring it heretofore by a series of misfortunes such as the destructive earthquake of 1923 and the financial panic of 1927. Japanese authorities are understood to have accumulated substantial holdings of foreign currencies, and these, together with Japanese gold stocks and the credit just arranged, are considered sufficient to assure maintenance of yen exchange above the gold shipment point. The actual date for lifting the gold embargo was set at Jan. 11 1930, in an announcement made at Osaka, Thursday, by Premier Hamaguchi. Minister of Finance Junnosuke Inouye, who played a prominent part in the events leading up to the complete restoration of the gold standard, asserted at the same time that the Government intends to refrain from regulating exchange after removal of the embargo. Pascual Ortiz Rubio, candidate of the National Revolutionary Party, was chosen the next President of Mexico by an overwhelming majority in national elections held last Sunday. His chief opponent was Jose Vasconcelos, who campaigned on an Anti-ReElectionist platform. According to figures given out early this week at the Revolutionary Party headquarters in Mexico City, said to represent the returns from all 28 States of lIcxico, except Guerrero, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tamaulipas and Zacatecas, Senor Ortiz Rubio polled 1,414,150 votes, while Senor Vasconcelos received only 12,420. The Communist candidate, General Pedro Rodriguez Triana, was said to have received 14,800 ballots in the area mentioned. Complete returns from the northern tier of States, where Senor Vasconcelos is considered popular, will probably increase his showing somewhat, but there is no possibility of a change in the decision. Rioting and other violent acts that accompanied the election resulted in the deaths of 21 Mexicans. For the most part, however, the balloting was more peaceful than had been looked for by observers in Mexico. The election was protested by Senor Vasconcelos, and his adherents filed approximately 2,000 individual 3214 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE complaints of election irregularities. That many irregularities occurred is not doubted, as polling booths, under Mexican law, are placed in the control of the first arrivals after they are opened. The Revolutionary Party is in thorough control of the political machine, and gained control of almost all polling places throughout Mexico. It appears probable, however, as a result of the election, that the executive power will pass peacefully to the hands of Senor Ortiz Rubio from those of the present Provisional President, Emilio Portes Gil. A notable feature of the election was that the candidates of the two important political parties were both civilians. Election of Senor Ortiz Rubio to the Mexican Presidency insures a continuance of the policies of the National Revolutionary Party, which have been successively followed by Presidents Obregon, Calles and Portes Gil. The President-elect will take office next Feb. 5, to serve until Nov. 30 1934, filling out the remainder of the six-year term for which former President Alvaro Obregon was elected in June 1928, only to be assassinated by a religious fanatic three weeks later. Senor Ortiz Rubio is a civil engineer by profession. He is 52 years old, has served as Mexican Ambassador to Brazil, and has written extensively on the history of his native State, Michoacan. The main principles of his immediate predecessors and of the National Revolutionary Party are said to be rigid national economy, coupled with a program of intensive internal and economic development,such as roads, irrigation, aids to agriculture, distribution of land, education, and every possible means to renew payments on Mexico's foreign indebtedness. Senor Vasconcelos, who opposed him, is a lawyer of note and a writer well known in the fields of economics and education. He was Minister of Education in the Obregon regime, but resigned because of political differences. His main plank in the present election was a proposal that the Congress enact a law preventing any Mexican President from serving more than one term. He maintained on this point that Mexico might again develop into a country governed by dictators and not by the votes of the people, unless re-election to the Presidency is prohibited. Such a provision was actually contained in the Mexican Constitution, until it was changed in order to permit General Obregon's candidacy last year. A preferential tariff agreement between Great Britain and Argentina has been concluded in Buenos Aires, as a result of which certain British textiles will have a decided advantage over similar American products, which now occupy an important position in the Argentine market. British artificial silk yarns and textiles, as well as products of mixed artificial silk with cotton or Tool, will be placed in a position of particular advantage, according to a Buenos Aires report of last Sunday to the New York \"Times.\" Britain took the initiative in the negotiations, the dispatch stated, offering to keep Argentine meats and cereals free of any duties or other restrictions if Argentina would lower her duties on the specified yarns and textiles. Argentina agreed to reduce the duties 50% on such goods imported from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and President Irigoyen has signed a decree placing the new arrangement in effect as of Jan. 1 next. \"The arrangement is a distinct victory for British diplo- .01,1% [VoL. 129. macy,\" the report said. \"Britain requires large quantities of Argentine meat and cereals to feed its population, and these are practically the only two Argentine products which the United States does not require.\" It was noted in the same report that Sir Malcolm Robertson, British Ambassador at Buenos Aires, who played the chief part in the AngloArgentine agreement, had resigned the post which he had held very successfully since 1925. Sir Malcolm's decision caused much regret, not only in Government circles, but also in the British and American colonies in Buenos Aires, where he has been very popular. Still further reductions in discount rates by central banks in Europe have occurred the present week. On Thursday the Bank of England reduced its rate from 6%, the figure in effect since Oct. 31, to 53/2%; the Bank of Norway made a similar reduction on the same day; on Friday the National Bank of Austria reduced from 83/2% to 8%; on Friday likewise the Irish Bank reduced its rate from 63/2% to 6%. Other than this there have been no changes in Central Bank rates. Rates continue at 7% in Germany and Italy; at 53/2% in Denmark, Sweden and Spain, at 43/2% in Holland and Belgium, and at 33/2% in France and Switzerland. In the London open market discounts for short bills yesterday were down to 43/2% against 53/2%, on Friday of last week and 47A%@5 1-16% for long bills against 53/2@5 9-16% the previous Friday. Money on call in London yesterday was 432%. At Paris open market discounts remain at 332%, but in Switzerland are down from 398% to 3 5-16%. The Bank of England discount rate was reduced last Thursday from 6 to 532%. The 6% rate had only been in effect since Oct. 31 1929, on which date it was lowered from 63/2%. The Bank's statement for the week ended Nov. 20 shows a further gain in gold holdings, but of only £59,605. Reserves, however, increased £3,081,000, circulation having undergone a contraction of £3,021,000. Public deposits decreased £444,000, while other deposits increased £629,405. The latter consists of bankers' accounts which expanded £3,839,614, and other accounts, which fell off £3,210,209. The proportion of reserve to liabilities is now 33.57%, as compared with 30.88% last week and as against 42.88% last year. Gold holdings now aggregate £132,830,637, against £162,084,589 a year ago. Loans on Government securities declined £4,336,000, while those on other securities expanded £1,466,865. Other securitie\" include \"discounts and advances\" and \"securities.\" The former decreased £1,101,917 and the latter increased £2,568,782.

Credit was released on a vast scale as speculative loans against stock and bond collateral were repaid, and the problem involved in the redistribution of these sums is not one that can be solved in a day or a week. A further decrease in brokers' loans of $585,000,000 was re- 3215 ported in the Federal Reserve Bank statement for the week ended Wednesday, bringing the total liquidation of these loans since the high figure was reached on Oct. 2 to $3,217,000,000. Much of this money is flowing back into normal commercial channels, but a considerable portion remains available for lending on collateral in financial centers, and rates are dropping quickly under the enormous load. Other financial centers also are reflecting the change in the situation. The Bank of England effected its second cut in the discount rate within three weeks, Thursday, lowering the figure from 6 to 5/ 1 2%. The Boston and Chicago Federal Reserve Banks followed this week the precedent set by the New York institution on Nov. 14, and reduced 1 2%. Bankers' their rediscount rates from 5 to 4/ bills and commercial paper rates showed marked recession this week. Call money in the New York market also moved steadily downward. Beginning with a renewal rate of 5/ 1 2% Monday, call loans moved lower on successive days, and in yesterday's market 4/ 1 2% was quoted throughout on the Stock Exchange, both for renewals and new loans. Large sums remained unloaned every day, and offerings of this money in the outside or \"street\" market brought much lower rates there than prevailed in the official market. Street trades were reported at 4% Monday and Tuesday, and 3% Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Time loans eased from 5/ 1 2 to 53 / 4% Monday, to 5@5/ 1 4% yesterday. Gold movements through New York for the week ended Wednesday, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank, consisted of exports of $11,212,000 and imports of $427,000. A decrease of $8,010,000 in the amount of gold earmarked for foreign account was shown. Dealing in detail with the call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, the renewal rate on Monday was 51/ 2%, and from this there was a reduction to 5% in the charge for new loans. On Tuesday all loans were at 5%, including renewals. On both Wednesday and Thursday the renewal rate continued at 5%, but some new loans were negotiated each day at 4/ 1 2%. On Friday all loans were at 4/ 1 2%,including renewals. Time money has been inactive, with rates still lower. On Monday quotations were 5/ / 4% for loans of all dates. On 1 2@53 Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday the range each day was5@5/ 1 2% for all dates. On Friday the range was 4/ 1 2@5% for 30 days and 5@51/ 4% for all other dates from 60 days to six months. Commercial paper in the open market has been without special feature except that here also rates have further declined. Rates for names of choice character maturing in four to six months have ruled all week at 5%, while names less well known have commanded 5/ 1 4%, with New England mill paper also quoted at 51/ 4%. The market for prime bank acceptances has continued active, with the demand for bills greater than the supply, and on Tuesday the experience last week was repeated and rates were twice reduced in a single day, 3/ 8 of 1% each time, the reduction applying in both the bid and the asked columns and to all dates of maturity. This made six reductions this month, and ten since Oct. 21. The posted rates of the American Acceptance Council are now 4% bid and 37 /8 asked for bills running 30 days, and also for 60 and 90 days; 4/ 1 2% bid and 4% asked for 120 3216 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE days, and 4/ 1 4% bid and 4/ 1 2% asked for 150 and 180 days. The Acceptance Council no longer gives the rates for call loans secured by acceptances, the rates varying widely. Open market rates for acceptances have also been reduced. [vol.. 129.

Sterling exchange has been highly irregular during At the Port of New York the gold movement for the week, under pressure the greater part of the the week Nov. 14-Nov. 20, inclusive, as reported by time in a dull market. The outstanding news of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of importance relating to the future of sterling exchange imports of $427,000, of which $250,000 came from is the further reduction in the Bank of England's Uraguay and $177,000 chiefly from other Latin rate of discount of M of 1% to 53/2% from 6%, American countries.

It is not believed that the has firmed up considerably from the low levels of a lower rate will have any effect whatever on the week ago. The comparative strength is attributed to gold movements between London and Paris which the withdrawal of short-term funds from New York have been in progress for many months, as this and to the purchase of Canadian bills to finance movement is governed by other considerations arising wheat movements.

Nov. 23 1929.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE Referring to day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday last was inclined to ease in the usual dull half-day market. Bankers' sight was 4.87 1-16@ 4.87%; cable transfers were 4.87 11-16@4.87 1346. On Monday the market continued to show weakness. The range was 4.86%(4)4.873 for bankers' sight and 4.87 5-16@4.87 9-16 for cable transfers. On Tuesday the market was somewhat firmer. The range was 4.867 ,4@4.873. for bankers' sight and 4.87/(4), 4.87 19-32 for cable transfers. On Wednesday the market was irregular. Bankers' sight was 4.86 15-16 @4.87 3-16; cable transfers 4.87 7-16@4.87%. On Thursday sterling developed a slightly firmer tone. The range was 4.87@4.87 5-16 for bankers' sight and 4.87%@4.87 11-16 for cable transfers. On Friday sterling was fractionally lower again; the range was 4.86 15-16@4.871 / 1 for bankers' sight and 4.873/ 2(4) 4.87 19-32 for cable transfers. Closing quotations on Friday were 4.87 7-32 for demand and 4.87 19-32 for cable transfers. Commercial sight bills finished at 4.87, sixty-day bills at 4.823/ 2, ninety day bills at 4.80, documents for payment (60 days) at 4.82, and seven-day grain bills at 4.86/. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4.87. The Continental exchanges have been irregular and have moved down with the general trend of sterling exchange. French francs continue relatively firm, although slightly easier than last week as the result of the practical cessation of the withdrawal of French funds from the New York market. The French rate is absolutely under the control of the Bank of France, which has large holdings in New York, London and Amsterdam which could be readily converted at any time were the franc to be unduly depressed. The present level of the franc, around 3.93 for cable transfers, compares with dollar parity of 3.92. As noted above, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York accounts for a further shipment of $1,000,000 gold to Paris and the French banks continue to draw down gold from London. This week the Bank of France shows an increase in gold holdings of 241,400,000 francs, bringing the total to 40,539,000,000 francs, the highest in the history of the Bank. This compares with 30,851,000,000 francs on Nov. 17 1928. The Bank's ratio of gold to liabilities stands also at the record level of 46.25%, which compares with 45.73% on Nov.8 and with 38.47% on Nov. 17 1928, and with the legal requirement of 35%. Paris dispatches reiterate the French stand that France is not \"hoarding gold\" and that the Bank of France has done nothing and is doing nothing to attract gold from London or New York. On the other_ hand, it appears that the Bank of France has decided to do nothing to prevent the inflow. This leaves the gold movement dependent solely on exchange market tendencies. At present the reduced interest rates on foreign markets seem more likely to bring capital back to Paris than to cause an exodus. It is believed that if confidence in the New York market is restored, French capital may possibly return to this side for investment. In fact, the slightly lower level of exchange on France this week is attributed in some measure to a resumption of demand for dollars in Paris, indicating, of course, a return of French investment funds to this side. German marks continue relatively firm, although .off from last week. The lower mark quotations are normal, considering the easier trend of sterling. Present quotations for marks, around 23.91 for cable 3217 transfers, must be judged by dollar par of exchange, 23.82. Bankers report that there was also some demand for dollars in Berlin during the week, which would account for the fractional average weakness in exchange on Berlin. On the whole, however, the lower money rates in New York are regarded as more likely to contribute to firm mark quotations and to the transfer of credit from New York to German centres. Money is fractionally easier in Berlin and foreign exchange circles are expecting a reduction in the Reichsbank rate from the present 7%. This week the Bank of Germany shows an increase in gold holdings of 5,029,000 marks,the total standing at 2,234,000,000 marks as of Nov. 15, which compares with 2,563,500,000 marks on Nov. 15 1928. The London check rate on Paris closed at 123.88 on Friday of this week, against 123.86 on Friday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French 5 on center finished at 3.93 5-16, against 3.93% Friday a week ago; cable transfers at 3.93 9-16, against 3.93%;and commercial sight bills at 3.93 1-16, 3 Antwerp belgas finished at 13.98 against 3.93/s. for checks and at 13.99 for cable transfers, against 13.98 and 13.993/ on Friday of last week. Final quotations for Berlin marks were 23.901A for checks and 23.913 for cable transfers, in comparison with 23.913/ and 23.923/2 a week earlier. Italian lire closed at 5.23% for bankers' sight bills and at 5.233 4 and 5.233/2 on for cable transfers, against 5.231 Friday of last week. Austrian schillings closed at 143' on Friday of this week, against 143 on Friday of last week. Exchange on Czechoslovakia finished at 2.96, against 2.963; on Bucharest at 0.60, against 0.60; on Poland at 11.25, against 11.25; and on Finland at 2.52, against 2.52. Greek exchange closed at 1.30 for checks and at 1.303 for cable transfers, against 1.30 and 1.3014. The exchanges on the countries neutral during the war, while generally lower in sympathetic relation to the easier tone of sterling and the leading Continental exchanges, are nevertheless firm for this time of year. Exchange on Amsterdam has moved off from the higher levels of a few weeks ago owing chiefly to conditions in the New York security' market, which have caused the return of Dutch funds to Holland. Bankers state that there has been in evidence some demand for dolars for Amsterdam account, indicating to some extent a return of investment funds to this side. Amsterdam dispatches to New York indicate that the Holland bankers are looking for still greater ease in international money markets and for an increase in American credits abroad. They are working on the supposition that the resumption of such credit facilities to foreign countries are necessary to provide for American surplus production. Swiss francs have been fractionally firmer, moving contrary to the general trend of the foreign currencies. As noted above, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported a shipment of $5,002,000 to Switzerland this week. Swiss francs closed this week at 19.40 for cable transfers, and the range for the week has been from 19.39 to 19.40, which compares with gold parity of 19.30. The general easing in European money rates is further emphasized this week by the reduction in the rediscount rate of the Bank of Norway from 6% to 5%. Spanish pesetas continue to sag, due partly to the lower rates for exchange on London and the Con- 3218 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE [VOL. 129. tinent, but chiefly to general uncertainty with respect cent under Thursday, and a new low for many to the Government's attitude on the question of years.

In the main, exchange on the South American countries continues unchanged from the past several weeks. Exchange on Buenos Aires, while at present easier, has assumed a generally firmer tone as a result of the heavy export of gold during the past few months to New York and London.
