        "text": "BHF dietitian Victoria Taylor says:\n\nFlax seeds are a good source of polyunsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids in particular. Omega-3 fatty acids are the type found in fish oils.\n\nIt’s recommended that we eat a portion of oily fish a week to benefit from these and help maintain our heart health. For people who don’t eat fish, nuts and seeds are an alternative omega-3 source. But this is a different type of omega-3, which may not have the same heart-health benefits.\n\nFlax seeds are often the subject of dramatic health claims, some of which lack strong evidence. But they can still be a healthy choice.\n\nSwapping foods high in saturated fats for foods with unsaturated fats helps lower cholesterol levels. Switching foods like cakes, biscuits and chocolate for nuts and seeds is a way of doing this.\n\nEating ground flax seeds gives you more benefits than whole seeds.\n\nVictoria Taylor\n\nFlax seeds come in brown and golden varieties, which are nutritionally similar. Eating ground flax seeds gives you more benefits than whole seeds, as whole seeds remain undigested and pass through the system.\n\nA 30g portion provides 153kcal and can be added to salads or smoothies, or sprinkled onto porridge.\n\nYou can also buy flaxseed oil. You should treat this as any other fat and only use it in small amounts, as it is a concentrated source of energy containing 9kcal/g."
