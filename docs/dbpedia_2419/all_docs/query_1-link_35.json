My primary doctor spoke highly of Modern PT, and referred me for therapy for an injury. When I called to schedule they were able to get me going right away. I started working with Hannah and she provided me with a wealth of education on my very first visit. She was extremely patient and answered all of my many questions. I saw Hannah twice weekly and stayed consistent with the exercises she prescribed me to do at home and I gradually healed. Through my guidance and therapy with Hannah I have also overcome pain between my shoulders that I had battled for decades! I also had several therapy sessions with PT Ryan, where I received in depth and helpful information about the nervous system and the role it plays in pain and in healing. Hannah and Ryan have both been wonderful physical therapists to work with, all around my experience has been positive, effective, and educational! I plan to always use Modern anytime I have a need for physical therapy in the future.\"\n\nMindy Gray from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Brekk is the best !!!!

I’m currently rehabbing after my knee replacement with Malik. He’s very good at finding those spots that need attention. When he told me today he was impressed with how I’m progressing, it made my day!\"\n\nCynthia Hoffecker from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Given the opportunity, I recommend that you request Brekk Flax for your therapist. You will not be disappointed. She pays attention to detail and will take amazing care of you. Brekk is extremely talented and knowledgeable lending her to be an excellent communicator. She will immediately get to the source of the problem and provide unparalleled therapy.\"\n\nMargie Hackett from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I’ve had a wonderful experience at Modern PT. They won’t treat you like a number and you won’t feel like you visited a gym. Dominick really listens to understand the issue and plans treatments accordingly. Everything was explained clearly and all questions were addressed. I would absolutely recommend Dominick and all of the staff at Modern PT.\"\n\nLisa Eiken from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Brekk is the absolute best PT ever!\"\n\nlanie pearl from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Dom does an excellent job working with you. I came here for Arthritis. Don taught me exercises that fit for my abilities. They weren’t difficult to do. After two months, my hip pain has lessened. This has made a big difference. Thanks!\"\n\nCarolyn Moore from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"They are so friendly!!! But the best part is that after only one week of therapy, I already feel so much better!!!

She provides guidance during my sessions complete with visual aids and names of tools to continue my exercises at home and even during work. In addition to top notch physical therapy, my therapist is kind, humorous, and truly cares. Let's not forget the front desk ladies as they are kind, patient, and supportive in all aspects of scheduling, payments, and supporting their team as well. I highly recommend this team if physical therapy is required. I am better for it! Thank you!\"\n\nSmiley Lisa from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Kacey Miller is the best PT I’ve ever had!

Walker has helped me through two different injuries as a result of one accident. He has taken the time to get to know me personally and figure out the nuances of my injuries. He knows when to push me and when I need a lighter touch that day. He is very intelligent and has a deep understanding of the human body. I would not have made it this far without Amy being an advocate for me with my workman’s comp and doctors offices. Hopefully, I won’t have to come back, but if I do you all have a lifer!!\"\n\nRaeann Bromert from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\nNatalia Leffler from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Hannah is great! She listens closely to what you are saying and feeling. She explains the meaning behind your symptoms to help you understand the problem and what the treatment is specifically doing to help you. Best experience at physical therapy I’ve had.\"\n\nWanda Bear from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\nLillie McLaughlin from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Walking through those doors, I had zero idea what to expect from physical therapy. To be honest, I doubted whether it would benefit me at all. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I had spent years in pain, and then a traumatic car accident happened, exacerbating my condition. Hannah, my physical therapist, asked all the right questions from the start, making sure she fully understood my situation and concerns. Her approach is both professional and compassionate, ensuring that every session is tailored to my specific needs. If you have insurance, it is absolutely worth giving your body the chance to learn how to move and function properly. When I started, my everyday pain level was a 7 out of 10. After just five weeks, my progress report showed a significant improvement, with my pain level dropping to a 4 out of 10. Hannah equips you with all the tools and instructions you need, and her guidance is clear and easy to follow, even if you don’t consider yourself athletic. She ensures that you understand each step of the process and how it will help you. You truly get out of it what you put into it. With Hannah’s expertise and support, I’ve made remarkable progress and can’t recommend her enough. She has made a huge difference in my quality of life, and I’m incredibly grateful!\"\n\nJessica Ecton from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Super good\"\n\nMarla Risner from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\nDamara Friederich from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Brekk is amazing!!!! Love her! \"\n\nMaddy B. from Parkville\n\n\"Dom was especially helpful in getting relief to my ankle. Would definitely use him again for any future problems.\"\n\nGlen Yager from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Walker and Dom each deserve a star. Very attentive with my recovery. Pushed me just far enough for maximum results without overdoing it. Well done\"\n\nMatt Larsen from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Dom is a great Physical Therapist! He listens to changes in your ability each week and pivots exercises to keep you going in the right direction to recovery!\"\n\nZachary Nickles from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Walker was patient and extremely helpful in my hip rehab.\"\n\nBrian Mertz from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Don is absolutely awesome! He always considers how I am feeling and adjusts our work for the day accordingly. I have had PT in several locations. This is by far the best!\"\n\nLinda S. from Parkville\n\n\"Brekk is BETTER than just a 5-Star rating! \"\n\nLiza H. from Parkville\n\nLara Sander from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Kasey goes above & beyond to make sure his patients have everything they need to live a pain free life. Grateful beyond measure for him & his team!\"\n\nJocelyn Hasenohr from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Great therapist - very professional\"\n\nKris Coss from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Driving to the Parkville location of Modern PT is not close for me so the fact that I have been consistently coming to see Kasey for several months now should speak volumes by itself. Kasey came highly recommended by my neurologist Dr. Kosa as one of the best Physical Therapists that specializes in neck pain that correlates with migraines. I have noticed a huge improvement in my quality of life since starting with Kasey. My migraines have decreased significantly in frequency and intensity. And most importantly, I am able to drive longer distances without pain. This is exciting because it allows me to have more flexibility in my social life again. Modern PT itself is just a welcoming, friendly, and supportive environment. The front desk staff are all wonderful! Amy and Renee have become like friends. Sometimes if it’s not busy, I will stay after just to sit and chat with them. All of the therapists are very friendly. However, now that I have been there for a while, I think they feel comfortable enough to join in with Kasey when he starts teasing me about something. I guess I should take it as a compliment that “I’m one of the tribe” now, LOL. They all have the most random conversations, but it makes the time go by quickly and I’m usually always laughing. And I am SO glad that Kasey has moved on from always asking me, “What are you having for dinner?” (Sorry, Kasey, you knew I was going to add it in here! 🤣) But seriously, I cannot say enough good things about Kasey and the entire Parkville location!\"\n\nSarah Buckley from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"THIS PT place is amazing, I had the pleasure of working with 3 of the therapist they are all very good. Kasey you are amazing!!\"\n\nIrene Brennan from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"After a shoulder injury, I spent six months working with Walker 1-2 times per week. On the very first day, I was impressed with the time he took to get to know my history, all the details of my injury, and the thorough consultation he did to create a plan for my recovery. Every day after that proved to me that I was in good hands. He provided me with pictures, graphs, models, and demonstrations to make sure that I understood my progress every step of the way. He answered my (many) questions, and never once made me feel rushed or that I was just another box to check off. My recovery was filled with some ups and downs, and the way he cheered me on during the ups and listened to me and encouraged me during the downs was exactly what I needed. Recovering from an injury can sometimes feel a bit isolating, but Walker made me feel like I was never alone in my journey to heal and recover my strength, mobility, and range of motion. The atmosphere of the clinic is upbeat, lighthearted, and feels like the village everyone needs to help them on their PT journeys. When I \"graduated,\" I immediately missed the support system and friends that I had made over the last six months. If I ever need that village to support me again, I will definitely return to Walker and the rest of Modern PT! I am a lifelong fan!\"\n\nAlison Neibling from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"dom Very big help! Highly recommended\"\n\nSkip Taylor from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Walker @ Modern Physical Therapy came highly recommended to me by not just one but two family members.I was terrified of the thought of physical therapy for my frozen shoulder. The pain I had before starting therapy was some of the worst pain I’ve experienced, over the course of my treatment I have so much less pain, I have more of my mobility back which is the best part. Renee at the front desk is absolutely the sweetest, funniest, and kindest lady you could have to greet people. I love seeing her happy face and she makes me feel like she’s always happy to see mine. Walker, is top notch! I love, love, love him and it’s so easy to understand why my family spoke so highly and kindly of him. He is pure magic and he is so knowledgeable and above all careful. He knows the points he can take my shoulder to before I even speak. Dom and Brekk are absolutely just ask careful and so kind and sweet and have been wonderful step ins when I could not be seen by Walker and they have played a big part in my progress and I’m so thankful for them . It’s been a joy getting to know this staff you have here. I love them all and I am beyond grateful for what they have been able to do to get my mobility back and reduce my pain. Walker, I will scream recommendations for you!!!! You guys are gems and thank you for helping me along this path. I’m truly so grateful! Y’all better compensate this crew accordingly there are worth every dollar and more!!!!Please take care of them, because they make yall look good 👍 💜 I hope you know how valuable they are💜\"\n\nCrista Mahurin from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Kasey has been the most professional, attentive, and kind PT I have ever had. I always enjoy my sessions and feel heard. He is very accommodating and knowledgeable and just a fun person to be around. The receptionist staff is always 10/10 and Amy knows anything and everything. If I could make an appointment everyday I would.\"\n\nKeeley Vail from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Kasey & Brekk from the Parkville location have completely got me back on track! They are very educated, fun, & care about improving your ailments. I have used Modern PT over the years for assessing & treating lower back issues & after a recent hip replacement. Each time, they created a game plan for my recovery, helped educate me along the way & slowly challenged me each visit. They have given me my range of motion back & relived pain throughout my body. Outstanding service, communication, & professional physical therapy group! Thank you!!\"\n\nAndrew Askren from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Excellent Service Dominick Lucito The Best\"\n\nJael Tolare from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"My daughter has worked with a few different therapists here after her knee injury and all of them have exceeded our expectations.

I’ve done PT before, in other facilities. However with Brekk, in addition to having my pain and range of motion addressed, she’s also helped me understand proper positioning and form to get the most from weight training and to avoid future pain or injury to my arm and shoulder.\"\n\nSindie Henson-Pugsley from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Walker is my PT, not only is he extremely knowledgeable but he is patient and understanding with your needs.

All of the staff is great. Walker was my PT but I'm sure that all are really good. You can't go wrong here.\"\n\nRob W from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Brekk is my PT professional, The care and skill is apparent and I am achieving both results and knowledge of how to mange this injury . Teach a man to fish vs give a man a fish !\"\n\nRussell Bouknight from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Modern Physical Therapy is a great facility to get you back on track after surgery. I worked with Tony and he did a phenomenal job working with me after I had my torn Triceps surgery. The whole team at Modern Physical Therapy are very friendly, knowledgeable and kind. I definitely recommend coming here to anyone. Thank you all for your time.\"\n\nAdam Rankin from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I saw Brekk for help with a bulged disc and she was so sweet & informative on how to address the issue. She had me feeling better quickly and I haven't had any back pain in months. Had such a great experience with her, I went back to see her for a nerve issue. She's always cheerful & great with educating me on what I need to be doing!\"\n\nNikki Meyer from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I had a total knee replacement in April 2023 and Modern PT is my third and final Physical Therapy place. My knee did not take well to the surgery and it has been a long recovery and I am still working on getting back to normal. Dom is who I mainly see, he is very knowledgeable, patient, positive and supportive with my struggle to get my full range of motion back. I just wish that I had known about Modern PT when I first had my surgery; I might be further along now. Their hands on approach to the tight muscles that are giving me the problem are exactly what I needed to get my full range of motion back. I am optimistic about my full recovery.\"\n\nPatricia Landis from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I’ve been treated by both Ethan and Brett for chronic neck and back pain.

I could not ask for a better teammate in pursuing full recovery from a foot fracture than Dom. When I wanted to pursue pt, I asked around. I heard Modern PT repeatedly from people I respected after observing their commentment to recovery from various injuries. This is alot of work... it cannot all happen at PT appointments. The appointments help me to see my improvement, as progress is often slow. Dom is great at noticing and calling my attention to things that I cannot see for myself.... maybe I want my legs to be the same size again and to get my full balance back.... he sees that I am favoring my foot, changing my gate... and he knows how to help me help myself with all of it. Thank you so much Dom!\"\n\nTeresa Moerer from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\nAngie Kirkendoll from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Amazing job Dom!\"\n\nKarrie Martin from Parkville\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"My first session with Dom was great.

Thanks Natalie\"\n\nEric Sligar from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I was in a car accident Feb. ‘21, and was seen by a physical therapist (a competitor of Modern) from Mar. ‘21-May ‘21. I was 21 at the time, and started having severe back and neck issues almost immediately. This physical therapist I was sent to spread his time between 5 patients at a time, making his rounds between them and checking periodically that they were performing their activities. This caused my 30 minute appointments to become over an hour and 30 minutes almost every time. I stopped seeing this therapist, as it was such generalized activity that I saw no improvement within 2 months of weekly appointments. Fast forward to Oct. ‘21, I was still having severe back issues related to the accident. This caused me to be in pain 24/7, and made most daily activities uncomfortable or honestly quite painful. I was recommended to Modern Physical Therapy by my primary care physician. Within the first appointment with Walker, I fully understood what was happening with my back, and what we could do to fix it (I was never told what was specifically wrong with me at the previous therapist, just that ‘you have a back injury and these exercises strengthen your back’). Within the first month, I noticed an almost 50% decrease in my problems and, within 3 months, I was at 95%. Walker worked wonders! It’s still amazing to me how I could go from where I was to where I am today in such a short time, considering my past experience with such an awful therapist. Walker blew all of my expectations out of the water, and far exceeded any hopes I had for my back feeling better. I currently have back pain maybe once a week, and with the tools Walker has given me, I am able to put my back at ease when these situations occur. If you have doubts like I had about PT, you have found a place and a person that will put your mind and pain at ease!\"\n\nMarley Symmonds from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"The physical therapists at Modern Physical Therapy are all outstanding.

Thanks so much\"\n\nSusan Wolfe from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I worked with many of the clinicians at Modern Physcial Therapy. One thing that stands out with this group is that they treat each patient’s problem differently. The mindset of some clinics out there is “a shoulder is a shoulder” and the treatment isn’t very specific to what is causing the pain in the shoulder. At Modern they do enough testing the first day to determine what specifically is causing your pain or dysfunction. Then they treat your specific pain generator and dysfunctions. After that they follow up and make sure treatment is working, and if not they reassess and determine why. Another thing that stands out about Modern is that they have one on one visits with their patients. Many other clinics will have their therapists double booked. At modern you know you will get your therapists full attention for that visit. Lastly at Modern they take care of the whole patient. When you are having a bad day, they can tell. They genuinely care and allow you to confide in them. They don’t just want to decrease your back pain, they also want to help you return to golf pain free. And finally, they know when to refer you for other treatments (injections, imaging, or surgery) when needed. They know when therapy will help, and when other members of the healthcare team need to be involved. You absolutely will not find a better physical therapy clinic in the Kansas City area.\"\n\nMO_SPT from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"Strongly recommend Modern Physical Therapy.

I am happy to share that within the last six weeks I have not experienced one of those monsters. Twice a week for the last six weeks \"Walker\" (Walker Evans) has loosened and lessened the stiffness on my neck and shoulders, that according to my doctor and neurologist, have contributed to my migraines. I cannot say enough positive things about Walker. He is knowledgeable in his profession and has the best bedside manner. Overall, my experience at MPT has been positive and I plan to continue to see Walker once a week until the maximum visits is reached. I would definitely recommend Walker. He is a professional, as well as, an all around good person who is pretty well rounded for small talk.

I can’t thank Walker and the whole team at Modern PT for their encouragement and guidance.\"\n\nAlexander Beffa from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"For years, since high school, I have had shoulder issues that I was told my numerous PT's, DO's, OT's and MD's that is was rotator cuff muscles. Preparing for an Ironman, I was not able to practice the swim because of the pain it would cause. On reference by a colleague, I was told the PT's at Modern PT were exceptional in their clinical expertise. I went and saw Kasey Miller which isolated the cause of my shoulder pain which ended up being subacromial bursitis and nothing to do with the rotator cuff muscles directly. He gave me exercises to do and sent me on my way. Since that appointment, I have been pain free and swimming again thanks to Kasey. He was so good that I sent my husband to him because for the last 4 years, his job requirements has messed up his shoulder. Every healthcare professional including occupation health, has said it was his rhomboid muscles causing his pain. However, Kasey assessed him and found it to be a cervical disc disruption. He went back to occupational health giving them Kasey's diagnosis and it indeed has been confirmed to be a cervical disc disorder. We have been frustrated with our different body pains and have lose hope at times thinking we would just have to live with the pain. However, Kasey has a gift of assessing EVERYTHING and we couldn't be more thankful to him for making me pain free and directing the healthcare for my husband at his job.\"\n\nAmanda C from Kansas City\n\nFrom Google\n\n\"I had a great experience with Modern!
