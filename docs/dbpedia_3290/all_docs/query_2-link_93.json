Foster, Faith in Empire, 10 and ff.\n\n11. This is the thesis of Daughton, An Empire Divided, 17-24. At present, this “missionary turn” in the historiography of imperialism is moving into the mid-twentieth century and the end of empires, producing sophisticated considerations of the role of Christianity and indigenous Christians’ agency in decolonization movements. See Foster, “‘Theologies of Colonization’”; Greenberg, “Protestants, Decolonization”; Fontaine, “Treason or Charity?”; and Walker-Said, “Wealth, Law, and Moral Authority.” One forerunner of this interest in Christianity’s influence on decolonization is Sanneh, Translating the Message.\n\n12. Sessions, By Sword andPlow, 1.\n\n13. McDougall, AHistoryofAlgeria, 89–90.\n\n14. Like dioceses in metropolitan France, in other words, the diocese of Algiers was regulated by the Concordat negotiated between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII in 1801, which famously gave the French state power to appoint and surveil the political opinions of French bishops and parish priests. (In 1865, the diocese of Algiers split into three dioceses, corresponding to the three departments at Oran, Algiers, and Constantine.) See Saaïdia, L’Algériecatholique, 33–61.\n\n15. Daughton, AnEmpireDivided, 22; and Prudhomme, Missionschretiennes, 88. On the training and missionary vocation (or lack thereof) of parish priests in nineteenth-century Algeria, see Saaïdia, L’Algériecatholique, 42–45.\n\n16. This point is from Saaïdia, L’Algériecatholique, 18. See, for example, Émerit, “La lutte entre les généraux”; Ageron, Les algériens musulmans; Rey-Goldzeiguer, Le royaume arabe.

For the similar role of nonreligious women in the “civilizing mission,” see Rogers, AFrenchwoman’sImperialStory. One other notable treatment of missionaries in nineteenth-century Algeria is the work of Kyle Francis, which explores Catholic missionary outreach to the non-French European settlers of Algeria (Spanish, German, Italian, Maltese, etc.).

As Laure Blévis explains, indigeneity was fixed from birth and could only be escaped by applying for French citizenship, a “favor” rarely requested by Muslim Algerians and even more rarely granted. Blévis, “La citoyenneté française,” 34, 37, 44–45.\n\n56. Blévis, “La citoyenneté française,” 43–44. For all these reasons, I will avoid the use of the colonialist pejorative “indigène” unless I am quoting or specifically discussing the racialized hierarchy produced by colonialist discourse and law. I am following the lead of scholars Arthur Asseraf,ElectricNewsinColonialAlgeria, 14–15; and Surkis, Sex, Law, andSovereignty, 4.\n\n57.

George Trumbull has argued that this negative association of Catholic and Islamic politics could move in the other direction too, colonial administrators in Algeria considering Muslim religious orders a threat because they viewed them through the lens of their “anxieties” about religious orders in France.

Anonymous, Eugène Boré supérieur général des Lazaristes, 142. Even before the two met, L. Veuillot had already warmly reviewed Boré’s travel writings in the pages of L’Univers, highlighting Boré’s theme that the July Monarchy should take a more active role in supporting Catholicism in the “profoundly religious” Orient. See L. Veuillot, “Le Portefeuille de Louis Veuillot,” in L’Univers, April 28, 1894 (reprint of an article from October 26, 1840).\n\n89. See the admiring letters Boré wrote to L.

See “Lettres sur le Liban,” L’Univers, August 30, 1848; and September 4, 8, 10, 18, and 25 September, 1848.\n\n91. Boré visited Algeria in 1851 as a companion to then-superior general of the Lazarists Jean-Baptiste Etienne, and again in 1877, as superior general himself. On this latter trip, undertaken one year before his death, he was as preoccupied as ever with the prospects of an apostolate to the Muslims, reportedly taking every opportunity to speak to Arabs “in their own language,” and bringing up the possibility of “the conversion of this race” to any Frenchman who would listen.

The Council voted another allocation for the catechumenate—this one smaller than the first—but once again nothing seems to have come from Boré’s hopes to relocate Ottoman converts to Algiers.

Joseph Girard’s numerous letters of 1851, dossier 108a: Alger, Archives de la Congrégation de la Mission (Lazarists) (ACM), Paris.\n\n100. Islam’s alleged status as a Christian heresy dates back to medieval Christian apologetics. See Daniel, IslamandtheWest, 184–94.\n\n101. These words are not Boré’s but Julia Clancy-Smith’s, describing the mission philosophy of Abbé François Bourgade, a French missionary in Tunisia in the 1840s and 1850s who emphasized continuities between Islam and the Gospel, and consequently advocated dialogue with Muslims. I have not been able to verify the source of the brief quotation within her quotation, but it is an apt description of Veuillot’s and Boré’s approach. Clancy-Smith, Mediterraneans, 270.\n\n102.

Like the Romantic Socialists studied by Naomi Andrews, who expressed “grudging respect for Muslim religious devotion,” Veuillot’s admiration often seems more about condemning the soullessness and excessive militarism of the colonial project than it was about any genuine concern for Algerian lives and liberty.

As we have seen, Eugene Boré, the orientalist-turned-Lazarist missionary, tried to use Algeria and the Lazarist mission there as a refuge for Ottoman converts. When Boré attempted to reestablish this refuge again in 1851, Père Girard also began surreptitiously catechizing some Algerian Muslim children along with the refugees from Constantinople. But no sooner had the catechumenate begun then Girard was denounced for “kidnapping” these children, since not all had received their parents’ permission to be there. See letters from Girard to Étienne [Lazarist Superior General], October 19, 1851 and November 24, 1851, in dossier 108a: Alger; and letter from Etienne to Boré, January 17, 1852, in Fonds de Saint-Benoît de Constantinople, Supérieurs généraux, carton VIII, dossier I, Correspondance de M.

In 1846, when the European population in Algiers had overtaken that of the “indigènes,” Constantine still counted some 15,000 Muslims (and more than 3,000 indigenous “Israelites”) against fewer than 2,000 Europeans. And two decades later, in 1866, the Muslim population alone (not counting the previously “indigenous” but soon-to-be naturalized Jews) was still more than twice as large as the European population.

While the eventual effect of this decree was to segregate the population, trapping Muslim Algerians in the oldest and most crowded housing, it did prevent the Europeanization of the original city.

Whereas the West was dominated by “sharifian aristocracies”—tribal leaders like Abd-el-Kader, who claimed descent from the Prophet and the right to “combine political and religious roles” and resist the colonizers—the East was marked by an organized class of ‘ulama and religious scholars, urbanized and centralized at Constantine, who saw themselves as having no overtly political authority, and who were quickly brought under the control of the French.

De Fenoyl’s manuscript is a “hasty survey” and copies references made in the Jesuit Archives at Constantine (diaries, in-house histories, reports of visiting provincial superiors, etc.) to the missionarabe. Given that the Jesuit missions in Algeria and Syria both fell under the direction of the Lyon province, Jesuits would sometimes circulate between the two mission fields, perhaps reinforcing an interest in “the Arab world” and language.

If such a measure were indeed taken, it would likely not have been to prevent Muslims from learning a little about Catholicism, but rather to prevent intercommunal conflicts from erupting in the Church—conflicts perhaps more likely to be provoked by inhospitable Christians themselves. See Père Girard: “in my beginnings here I sometimes saw in the church of N.D. desVictoires some young Mohammedan people but when the Spanish men and women noticed them they fell on them and with blows and threats quickly forced them out.

It was none other than Veuillot who authored the article about the chapel’s construction, quoting from and inspired by an appeal Pavy had written. It is interesting that Veuillot followed Pavy’s very anti-Islamic approach in this case. Perhaps Pavy had won Veuillot over after l’Univers published Louis de Baudicour’s denunciations of Pavy in 1850-51; or perhaps Veuillot’s own trajectory is emblematic of the larger disillusionment with Algerian Muslims experienced by French Catholics in this period.\n\n20.

SL 48, ACJF. The young evangelist’s family name is somewhat illegible, something like “Louis Codsa.” Given the unlikelihood of another young Arab convert in Constantine being given the same Christian name, and possessing such a similar family name, the letter seems to be referring to Louis Khoudja. The misspelling may be the product of different ways of transcribing the Arabic alphabet, possibly compounded by an error in the hand-copying done by the scholastiques at Fourvieres. Louis’ evangelism involved getting the dying man to admit that Muhammad had been a liar, since he had denied that Jesus was the “Son of God,” even though every Arab admits Jesus was the “Word of God,” and one’s “word” can be seen as one’s “son.”\n\n51.

Echoing the contrasts between Algiers and Constantine drawn by Suchet back in the 1840s and by Pavy in the 1850s, Ducat complained, “At Algiers, the Association of Prayers for the conversion of the Muslims is hardly known . . . . It seems that we are afraid to injure powerful susceptibilities, in letting it be seen that we desire, that we ask for the conversion of the poor Muslims. Much more even than at Constantine, though [Constantine is] three-quarters Arabic, there is need here for an extreme reserve and a regrettable circumspection.” In Ducat, “Faits principaux relatifs . . .,” p. 64.\n\n63.

Louis’s son Joseph—Léonie’s brother—succeeded his father as Tunisian consul at Bône, where he functioned as a kind of “double agent,” aiding and abetting France’s invasion of Tunisia in the early 1880s, for which France rewarded him with a governorship in the new protectorate.

Property legislation such as the Senatus Consulte of 1863, promulgated at the height of Napoleon III and the Bureaux Arabes’ protectionist “royaume arabe” period had been on the right track, Khoudja believed, since it had recognized that the indigenes were still “minors” with regards to French civilization, were not ready to enter a liberal property market as individual smallholders, and needed to have their collective tribal lands protected from division. Conversely, the settler-inspired legislation of 1873, which overturned the protections of 1863 and carved tribal lands up into individual titles, had led to the Arabs’ “ruin,” because it ignored the fact that they had not yet “left childhood” and that they were at the mercy of usurers and speculators.

I follow Smati in citing this passage as evidence of the “double alienation” experienced by educated Algerians like Khoudja; yet the deeply personal character of the passage evaded Smati, since he was not aware of Khoudja’s own Jesuit education and sojourns in France.

Albert Monshan Wu makes a similar point about the “missionary encounter” in FromChristtoConfucius, 15–17.\n\n107. In highlighting Khoudja’s unique educational trajectory, I only mean to highlight how the missionary encounter encourages religious uncertainty and cross-pollination. Of course, I do not mean that Khoudja and other Algerians, like “Caliban,” were merely using a “language learned from and deployed against the colonizer” (Gopal, Insurgent Empire, 5); or that Algerians somehow needed the French or the Jesuits to bring them “modernity,” or to teach them about the values of self-government, civil rights, and equality.

On a preaching tour of dioceses along the Loire and down to Bordeaux in 1857, for example, Lavigerie met with enthusiastic receptions, establishing diocesan committees—usually of Dames, but also occasionally of “hommes honorables”—in Angers, Nantes, Bordeaux, Biarritz, Bayonne, and Pau.

The tradition of France’s right to “protect” Ottoman Christians dated back to the Capitulations granted to France by the Ottoman Porte in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These capitulations, dispensations from Ottoman jurisdiction, technically only applied to French citizens living in the Ottoman Empire. But France increasingly invoked jurisdiction and protection even over Ottoman subjects, for instance, native employees of French embassies. See, for example, Mazower, Salonica, CityofGhosts, 119–21.

According to historian David Cohen, by initiating this fundraiser on behalf of Christians, the reformist Jews of the Alliance israélite universelle hoped to show their gratitude for the emancipation and citizenship France had granted them in 1789; to prove their Frenchness, above and beyond religious belonging; and perhaps even to symbolically reject, with their support for Christians in Damascus, the anti-Semitic myth that a Jew had committed “ritual murder” in Damascus twenty years before. But the fundraiser was quickly transformed into a political football by the anticlerical press, which relished the fact that (while ultramontane Catholics were busy taking up collections and volunteering to go fight for the beleaguered Pope) it was the Jews of France who had first thought of this humanitarian campaign. To these taunts, ultramontane Catholics responded with bitterly anti-Semitic tirades or with calls for an armed intervention not to Syria, but to Rome. See Cohen, “Une souscription des Juifs de France”; and Marcel Émerit, “La crise Syrienne,” 211–32.\n\n50.

At the center of the criticism, it seems, were the orphanages that Lavigerie had established, one for boys run by the Jesuits, and one for girls by the Lazarist-affiliated Soeurs de la charité. Apparently, some thought Lavigerie should have not accepted orphans at all, some of whose mothers were still alive. Perhaps the criticism was also a continuation of the Maronite delegate’s accusation that Lavigerie was not funneling enough funds to the needs of the Maronite community and instead trying to “Latinize” the country. See Lavigerie, Souscriptionrecueillie, 55–56.\n\n70. Lavigerie was not the only Œuvre associate to rely on Faugère’s article. See Avril, L’arabiecontemporaine, 218–22.\n\n71.

Étienne, “Le rayonnement d’Abd el-Kader,” 625. The emir and his Algerians may already have been resented as outsiders by the Muslims of Damascus, and even more so after intervening on behalf of French protegés. Some Algerians in Syria would even go on to opt for French nationality, so they could avoid Ottoman conscription and benefit from French consular protection. See Haddad, “Sur les pas d’Abd el-Kader.”\n\n85. Lavigerie, Souscriptionrevueillie, 67–68. France’s freemasons similarly reached out to Abd el-Kader, believing his actions proved he was no longer a fanatical Muslim but a universalist freemason. The emir responded favorably and even joined a masonic lodge, but he never stopped believing that his protection of Christians had been an “essentially Muslim” act. Cf. Étienne, “Le rayonnement d’Abd el-Kader,” 625–28.\n\n86. For the previous two sentences, Hakim, The Origins of the Lebanese National Idea, 71–72, 92–98.\n\n87.

See, for example, Borrmans, “Lavigerie et les Musulmans en Afrique du Nord,” 39–56; and Cuoq, Lavigerie, les Pères Blancs, et les musulmans Maghrébins, 32–49; see also Renault, Cardinal Lavigerie, 156. One recent historian, not at all a Lavigerie hagiographer, agrees that the archbishop’s method of forbidding baptism was a sign of his “modernity.” See Saaïdia, Algériecatholique, 178–83.\n\n8. Renault, CardinalLavigerie, 112.\n\n9. Bertrand Taithe has argued that, while colonists on the ground in Algeria were increasingly susceptible to a new anti-Arab racism, for Lavigerie’s missionaries and for French Catholics back home in France, the “religious mode” of discrimination remained more powerful than the “racial mode” in this period. I am more interested in how Lavigerie served to intertwine more closely the racism of the colony with the metropole. See Bertrand Taithe, “Algerian Orphans,” 256–59.\n\n10.

Saaïdia believes that cooperation between church and state was the norm in the colony, that this conflict was mostly hot air, and that historians have overemphasized its significance.\n\n16.

Typed summary of correspondence, Félix de Las Cases to Lavigerie, May 13, 1868, dossier A16: Algérie (8-11), Fonds Lavigerie, AGMAfr. Las Cases also believed the fundraising campaign was misleading, profiting from an Algeria-wide catastrophe to enrich Lavigerie’s personal projects only. P. Soubiranne to Lavigerie, March 18, 1868, dossier A19: Œuvres, Fonds Lavigerie, AGMAfr.\n\n19. Soubiranne reminded Lavigerie that he could call on the liberal bishop Dupanloup to effect a compromise if need be. Soubiranne also suggested that even if Lavigerie decided to forgo a conciliation with the liberals, he should still reconcile himself with the emperor and publish something in the Catholic journals assuring he would not “baptize all the Arabs.” Soubiranne to Lavigerie, April 24, 1868, dossier A19: Œuvres, Fonds Lavigerie, AGMAfr.\n\n20. Vogüé—who knew Bishop Lavigerie personally from their days together at the Œuvre—had already felt back in 1867 that he was not a sensible choice for archbishop, that he was too ambitious, “difficult,” and “political.” Melchior de Vogüé to Robert de Vogüé, July 14, 1867, Fonds Vogüé: 567AP/189, AN.\n\n21. Soubiranne to Robert de Vogüé, Algiers, June 19, 1869, and Melchior de Vogüé to Robert de Vogüé, May 22, 1869, Fonds Vogüé: 567AP/189, AN. M. Vogüé had to play the peacemaker again in 1870, when Lavigerie seems to have vindictively seized some funds sent by the Œuvre de la Propagation de la Foi that were intended for Elizabeth de MacMahon’s smaller orphanage. To avoid another intra-Catholic scandal, M. Vogüé urged the board of the missionary association to leave the first gift to Lavigerie and quietly send another identical subvention to the Maréchale. See the letters from Elizabeth de MacMahon to Melchior de Vogüé, and from the Treasurer of the Paris Conseil de la Propagation de la Foi to Melchior de Vogüé, etc. May–July 1870, Fonds Vogüé: 567AP/217, AN.\n\n22.

Jules Duval is quoted within the quotation, on page 222.\n\n30. Of course, as other historians have observed, in this alliance of convenience, Lavigerie presumably wanted access to the Muslims’ hearts, while the settlers wanted their land and labor. Cf. Rey-Goldzeiguer, Leroyaumearabe, 97. Goldzeiguer’s formulation is apt: “The largeholding colonists [gros colons] demanded arms, the church demanded souls.” See also Taithe, “Evil, Liberalism,” 147–71.\n\n31.
