The development of the kingdom of Burgundy, and the rise of the nobility within its territory, is discussed in the Introduction to the BURGUNDY KINGDOM group of documents. The county of Savoy (Saboia, pagus Savogiensis) was situated in the north-east part of the diocese of Grenoble, although no specific reference has been found in primary sources to counts in this area before the 11th century. The family of the counts of Savoy first acquired power in the central part of the Burgundian kingdom during the latter part of the reign of King Rudolf III, when the Comtes de Genève and the Comtes d'Albon were also emerging as local power forces in the area.\n\nHumbert [I] Comte de Maurienne served Emperor Konrad II, after the emperor inherited the kingdom of Burgundy following the death in 1032 of King Rudolf III, and was rewarded with the grant of Chablais and Saint-Maurice en Valley. Humbert collected various dispersed territories in the area south of Lake Geneva, especially in the ecclesiastical dioceses of Belley, Aosta, Maurienne and Tarentasia. Comte Humbert's landholdings were gradually expanded by his descendants and united under a single government. The most important step in this process was the marriage of Humbert's son Odon to Adelaida, heiress of the marquisate of Susa, whose territories extended between the Alps and the River Po (including Auriate, Turin, Ivrea and Aosta) and as far as the Mediterranean coast between Ventimiglia and Albenga, and also included control of the Alpine passes of Mont-Cenis and Saint-Bernard . The Savoy family's fortunes were favoured by the marriage in 1066 of Odon's daughter Berthe to Heinrich IV King of Germany. The family lost control of much of the territories of the marquisate after the death in 1091 of Marchesa Adelaida. The counts of Savoy retained only the valley of Susa itself, although they continued to title themselves \"Marchesi of Italy\" in primary sources during the following centuries. After the loss of these Italian possessions, Comte Humbert II turned his attention westwards by strengthening relations with the Capetian kingdom of France, his daughter eventually marrying Louis VI King of France. Humbert II´s son Comte Amedée III recovered the county of Turin, although his own son Comte Humbert III was banished and his lands confiscated after he quarelled with Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\". A settlement between the county of Savoy and the emperor was brokered by Guglielmo V Marchese di Monferrato, who acted as regent for the minor Comte Thomas I after the death of Humbert III. Comte Thomas further expanded the family's territories northwards into Vaud in present-day Switzerland and eastwards to Piemonte in northern Italy. He also bought the town of Chambéry in Savoie. He appears to have been the first member of the family to use the title \"Comte de Savoie\".\n\nEmperor Friedrich II appointed Comte Amedée IV as Imperial Vicar in northern Italy, and also created him Duke of Chablais and Aosta, although this title lapsed after Amedée IV died in 1253. The family of the counts of Savoy extended their influence to England following the marriage in 1236 of Eléonore de Provence (whose mother was the daughter of Thomas I Comte de Savoie) to Henry III King of England. The English king's inability to control his wife's foreign relations was a factor which contributed to conflicts with his barons, which ultimately led to civil war. Comte Pierre II increased the Savoy family's territories by acquiring land in western Switzerland, mainly at the expense of the Comtes de Genève. Comte Amedée V, older surviving son of Comte Thomas II, was chosen to succeed his father, in place of the infant son of his deceased older brother. To pacify family ambitions, he divided the family´s landholdings, installed his nephew in Turin and Pinerolo, and his younger brother Louis in Vaud, although Thomas II retained overall suzerainty over these territories. Vaud was reunited with the main line of the counts of Savoy in 1359, and Piemonte in 1418. Faucigny was transferred to Savoy in 1355 under the terms of the Treaty of Paris agreed with Jean II King of France, which also confirmed the frontier between Savoy and Dauphiné. Comte Amedée VII acquired Nice in 1388, and Comte Amedée VIII was confirmed as comte de Genève in 1410. Comte Amedée VIII was created duke of Savoy by Sigmund King of Germany in 1417.\n\nResearch into the family of the counts of Savoy is complicated by the loss of original primary source documentation in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries. The Germans burnt the archives of the castles of Susa, Avellana and Turin at different times, including an episode in 1174 when Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" burnt all the title deeds of the house of Savoy . In 1536, the Bernese destroyed documentation when they invaded Vaud, Chablais and Faucigny . Other material was lost in various accidental fires at the castle of Chambéry . Nevertheless, some interesting new details concerning the family have been incorporated into this document from information which is available in the on-line inventory of the State Archives of Turin . Unfortunately, since compiling the earlier version of the present document, the State Archives of Turin have changed their website. The new website no longer includes the reference numbers for citing particular documents which are included in the footnotes below . It is suggested that anyone wishing to check entries should search the new website using the words in the extracts which I quote (Ricerca in the top right corner of the webpage cited below). It has also come to light that some of the entries in the index of the Archives are inaccurate. As always, it is recommended that the original documents should be consulted in cases of doubt.\n\nChapter 1. COMTES de SAVOIE [1060]-1417\n\nA. COMTES de MAURIENNE, COMTES de CHABLAIS\n\nThe origins of Humbert [I] \"blancis manibus\" Comte de Maurienne, first known ancestor of the counts of Savoy, are unproven. Alternative theories have been proposed:\n\n· Manteyer suggests that he was descended from Garnier Comte de Troyes (see the document CHAMPAGNE NOBILITY), whose son Hugues may have received part of the county of Vienne, and whose own son Humbert has been postulated (probably incorrectly) as the father of comte Humbert [I] .\n\n· Previté-Orton prefers the theory of descent from the local family headed by Amedée Comte [de Belley] (see the document BURGUNDY KINGDOM NOBILITY), who was living in [977] . A link between these two groups of families is suggested by the various donations of property in the county of Belley made by Humbert [I] and his descendants.\n\n· descent from the first kings of Provence. This proposition is based only on a manuscript note written by d´Hozier in 1675, in a copy of Guichenon´s Histoire généalogique de la maison de Savoie later deposited at the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris, which states that \"les chartes qui établissent la descendance de la Maison de Savoie des rois de Provence sont dans les Cartulaires de Saint-Maurice à Vienne\" . Presumably such alleged descent would be through Charles Constantin Comte de Vienne, son of Louis King [of Provence], about whose two sons nothing is known apart from their names (see the document PROVENCE). No reference to such charters is found in the commentary on the cartulary of Vienne Saint-Maurice published by Ulysse Chevalier, or in the handful of charters themselves which he reproduced . It must be assumed that, if such documentation ever existed, it has since disappeared.\n\n· son of \"Béraud\". The book of anniversaries of the church of Aosta includes an entry dated 1040 the dating clause of which notes \"regnante et principante in Valle nostra Augustæ Salassorum Umberto P. Maurianensi filio illustris Beroldi de Saxonia\" . This is the origin favoured by Guichenon after reviewing numerous alternative theories. In addition to \"tradition\" in the family, he bases his conclusion on an anachronistic heraldic argument and a supposed common connection with St Maurice. He identifies Béraud with \"Berthold\" who is named in two charters of Rudolf III King of Burgundy dated 1016 and 1018 (see the document BURGUNDY KINGDOM NOBILITY). Guichenon also launches into highly speculative conjecture about the precise origin of Béraud in the families of Widukind and Emperor Otto I (set out in the document SAXONY DUKES) which is not worth summarising . Assuming that the Aosta entry is factually correct (it is assumed that it is not contemporary), the reference to \"Saxonia\" may represent an imperfect transcription. It is not therefore impossible that Humbert was the son of a local \"comte Béraud\" who is otherwise unrecorded.\n\nIt is also possible that Humbert [I] was related to Ermengarde, second wife of Rudolf III King of Burgundy, who appointed him as her representative in administrative dealings relating to her territorial holdings after her husband died. If this is correct, the family relationship cannot be traced as Queen Ermengarde´s parentage is not known, although the fact that Humbert [I]´s possible sister was also named Ermengarde (see BURGUNDY KINGDOM NOBILITY) may also indicate a family connection.\n\nHUMBERT, son of --- ([970/75]-1 Jul [1047/51], bur Saint-Jean de Maurienne) . [\"Umberto comitis et uxoris suæ\" signed the charter dated 4 Apr 1003 under which Eudes Bishop of Belley granted land \"in pago Gratiopolitano in agro Salmojacense\" . It is not certain whether this charter relates to Humbert [I] \"blancis manibus\" Comte de Maurienne or to his supposed maternal uncle Humbert Comte [de Belley].] \"Rodolfus rex\" jointly with \" comitibus Rodulpho et Uberto\" gave the castle of Moras to \"Umberto episcopo eiusque matri domine Freburgie et nepotibus eius, Wigonis bone memorie filiis, Umberto Wigoni Willelmo\" by charter dated 6 Jun 1009 . \"Domni Umberti comes, Lambertus comes \" witnessed the charter dated 1 Apr 1018 under which \"Ratcherius\" confirmed a donation to \"Sancti Petri Romani monasterio\" . Lanter Bishop of Langres granted property \"in comitatu Genevensi et pago Albonensi in villa Casei\", except for that part held by \"Ermengardis regina\", to \"nostro amico Humberto comiti et duobus heredibus filiis eius unus Amedeus et alter Burchardus episcopus\" for life, by charter dated 8 Apr 1022 . \"Ermengardis, domini Rodulphi regis coniux\" founded the monastery of Talloires \"in pago Albanense in villa Talueris\", with the advice of \" comitis Umberti\", by charter dated to [1025], signed by \"Umberti comitis \" . \"Donnus Ubertus comes\" exchanged property with \"Dominum Brocardum Episcopum Augustensis\" by charter dated 16 Nov [1026] . \"Ermengart regina\" donated \"duos mansos in pago Genevense\" to Cluny, for the soul of her late husband Rudolf III King of Burgundy, acting \"per advocatum meum comitum Humbertum\", by charter dated to [1033/48] . It is assumed that this document refers to Comte Humbert, although this is not beyond all doubt. Saint-Genis (who assumes that the co-identity is correct) suggests that the use of the term \"advocatum\" in this document indicates that Humbert was administrator of royal lands only and was not a direct fiefholder himself . If this is correct, the title \"comes\" would have been honorary, linked to his royal appointment rather than territorial holdings. At first sight the hypothesis of Saint-Genis appears attractive because, if Humbert held no county, his parentage may have been obscure, which could account for the difficulties in tracing his origin. However, there appears no reason why Humbert could not have held comital jurisdiction over a specific territory at the same time as an appointment as \"advocatus\" of the queen in relation to her own property. In any case, all the earlier documents quoted here confirm that Humbert held full comital status, although none of them specify his geographical jurisdiction (which is not unusual for early 11th century charters). His appointment by Queen Ermengarde as her representative may indicate a family relationship between the two, which cannot now be traced as the queen´s parentage is not known. \"Amedeus filius Uberti comitis et Adaelgida uxor mea\" donated \"ecclesia S. Mauricii in pago Maltacena\" to the priory of Bourget by charter dated 22 Oct 1030, signed by \"Uberti comitis, Anciliæ uxoris eius, Amedei comitis, Adilæ uxoris eius Rodulphi regis, reginæ Ermengardis, Odonis, Antelmi\" . Humbert recognised the suzerainty of Emperor Konrad II, to whom King Rudolf III bequeathed the kingdom of Burgundy in 1032, and fought against Eudes II Comte de Blois who challenged the emperor´s succession . The emperor invested Humbert with Chablais and Saint-Maurice en Valley in 1034 as a reward for his services . From this time, he is taken to have become HUMBERT I \"blancis manibus/of the White Hands\" Comte de Maurienne, Comte de Chablais. His nickname appeared for the first time in the 14th century Chronicle of Hautecombe . According to Szabolcs de Vajay, the popular version is a misreading of \"blancis moenibus/of the White fortresses\" . Saint-Genis suggests that the nickname should be considered the equivalent of \"clean hands\", indicating Humbert´s honesty in administrative dealings . \"Domnum Humbertum comitem et filium eius Amadeum\" are named as present in the charter dated 1037 which records the foundation of the priory of Bugey . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . \"Domnus Upertus comes\" is named in a charter relating to a church \"in loco Scalas quod antiquitus vocatur Lavastrone\" dated 21 Jan 1042, signed by \"Brochardi archiepiscopi, Aimoni episcopi, Ameei, Oddoni, Orlini et filiorum eius Wigoni, Anselmi, Rostagni, Bornoni Rostagni\" . \"Umbertus comes et filii mei Amedeus et Oddo\" donated the church \"in pago qui antiquitus vocatur Lavastrone Scalas in episcopati Gratianopolitano\" to the abbey of Saint-Chaffre by charter dated 10 Jun 1042, signed by \"Brochardi archiepiscopi, Amedei comitis, Oddonis, Bornonis, Aureliani, Rostagni\" . \"Humbertus comes et Theobaldus episcopus Maurianensis\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean by charter dated 14 Jun 1046, signed by \"Aimonis nepotis eius, Ioannis, Berillonis, Odonis\" . \"Domni Huberti comitis \" subscribed the charter of \"Aymo\" (his presumed grandson) dated [1046] .\n\nm ([995/1000]) AUXILIA, daughter of ANSELM & his wife Aldiud ---. \"Amedeus filius Uberti comitis et Adaelgida uxor mea\" donated \"ecclesia S. Mauricii in pago Maltacena\" to the priory of Bourget by charter dated 22 Oct 1030, signed by \"Uberti comitis, Anciliæ uxoris eius, Amedei comitis, Adilæ uxoris eius Rodulphi regis, reginæ Ermengardis, Odonis, Antelmi\" . The parentage of Auxilia is deduced from her son Burchard being described by Rodolfus Glaber as nepos of Burchard Archbishop of Lyon , who was the illegitimate son of Conrad I King of Burgundy and his mistress Aldiud. Aldiud was the wife of Anselm, this couple presumably being Auxilia´s parents. Her parentage is also suggested by the charter dated 12 Jun 1052 under which her son \"Aimo, Sedun episcopus\" donated property, inherited from \"avunculo meo comite Oudolrico in villam Ursaria\", to the church of Sion \"per manum advocatis mei comitis Oudalrici\" . Szabolcs de Vajay suggests that Count Humbert had two wives: firstly \"---, sister of Graf Ulrich [von Lenzburg]\" and secondly \"Auxilia, relative of Saint Odilon de Mercur abbé de Cluny\" . Europäische Stammtafeln shows only one wife \"Auxilia von Lenzburg\" , in an amalgam of these two proposed wives. None of the sources so far consulted in the preparation of the present document suggest that Humbert had two wives. Until more information comes to light, the simpler solution has been adopted in this document. The primary source which indicates Auxilia's relationship with the Mercur family (see the document AUVERGNE) has not yet been identified.\n\nComte Humbert & his wife had four children:\n\n1. AMEDEE ([995/1000] or after-after 18 Dec 1051). Lanter Bishop of Langres granted property \"in comitatu Genevensi et pago Albonensi in villa Casei\", except for that part held by \"Ermengardis regina\", to \"nostro amico Humberto comiti et duobus heredibus filiis eius unus Amedeus et alter Burchardus episcopus\" for life, by charter dated 8 Apr 1022 . \"Amedeus filius Uberti comitis et Adaelgida uxor mea\" donated \"ecclesia S. Mauricii in pago Maltacena\" to the priory of Bourget by charter dated 22 Oct 1030, signed by \"Uberti comitis, Anciliæ uxoris eius, Amedei comitis, Adilæ uxoris eius Rodulphi regis, reginæ Ermengardis, Odonis, Antelmi\" . \"Domnum Humbertum comitem et filium eius Amadeum\" are named as present in the charter dated 1037 which records the foundation of the priory of Bugey . \"Amedeus comes et uxor mea Adela\" donated \"hereditate nostra in comitatu Bellicensi in villa Carnitus\" to Cluny by undated charter . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . \"Amedeus comes et uxor mea Adela\" donated property \"in comitatu Belicensi in villa Larnitus\" to Cluny by charter dated 1036 . \"Domni Amedei comitis \" subscribed the charter of his presumed nephew dated [1046] . He succeeded his father in [1047/51] as AMEDEE I \"la Queue\" Comte de Maurienne et de Chablais. His nickname was acquired after he refused to enter the presence of Emperor Heinrich III at Verona after his retinue (\"queue\") was refused entry . \"Amedeus comes Belicensium\" donated property \"mansum Cavanerii\" to the church of Belley by charter dated to [1031/60] . m ([1030]) ADELAIS, daughter of ---. \"Amedeus filius Uberti comitis et Adaelgida uxor mea\" donated \"ecclesia S. Mauricii in pago Maltacena\" to the priory of Bourget by charter dated 22 Oct 1030, signed by \"Uberti comitis, Anciliæ uxoris eius, Amedei comitis, Adilæ uxoris eius Rodulphi regis, reginæ Ermengardis, Odonis, Antelmi\" . \"Amedeus comes et uxor mea Adela\" donated \"hereditate nostra in comitatu Bellicensi in villa Carnitus\" to Cluny by undated charter . Comte Amedée I & his wife had [two] children:\n\na) HUMBERT (-before 1051). His parentage is confirmed by the undated charter under which \"Comes Amedeus et Adela uxor eius\" donated property to the monastery of Saint-Maurice, for the repose of \"Uberti filii\" .\n\nb) [AYMON (-[1050]). \"Aymo Bellicensis episcopus\" refers to property \"ecclesiæ S. Ioannis Baptistæ\" held by \"pater noster Amedeus\", by undated charter . Carutti suggests that Aymon Bishop of Belley was the son of Amedée Comte [de Belley], recorded in the last quarter of the 10th century (see the document BURGUNDY KINGDOM NOBILITY-BRESSE & BUGEY) . Bishop of Belley [1032]. A manuscript note attached to an undated charter, under which \"Amedeus comes et fratres mei, unacum genitrice nostra Gisla\" donated property to the church of Belley \"per nostros advocatos comitem Aimonem Genevensem et Widonem de Mirabello\", for the soul of \"patris nostri Humberti comitis\", states that \"Hic Amadeus comes erat Belicensis pater Aimonis episcopi \" . This note is incorrect as the donor under this charter was Amedée III Comte de Maurienne who lived about a century after Comte Amedée I. It is not known whether this is the only authority for asserting that Aymon Bishop of Belley was the son of Amedée I. If that is the case, the \"proof\" is shaky at best.]\n\n2. BURCHARD ([995/1000] or after-after 10 Jul 1068) . Lanter Bishop of Langres granted property \"in comitatu Genevensi et pago Albonensi in villa Casei\", except for that part held by \"Ermengardis regina\", to \"nostro amico Humberto comiti et duobus heredibus filiis eius unus Amedeus et alter Burchardus episcopus\" for life, by charter dated 8 Apr 1022 . Bishop of Aosta . \"Brocardu epm\" [Bishop of Aosta] approved a donation by \"Katelmus\" by charter dated 19 Oct 1025, signed by \"domni Umbertus comes\" . Rodolfus Glaber names \"Burcardi nepos eiusdem equivocus\", referring to Burchard Archbishop of Lyon who was an illegitimate son of Conrad I King of Burgundy by his mistress Aldiud wife of Anselm, when recording that the second Burchard \"deserted his own see of Aosta in order rashly to seize Lyon\" . Coadjutor of Aosta. Provost of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune. Archbishop of Lyon 1030, deposed. Radulfus Glaber records that Burcardi nepos, eiusdem æquivocus left sede propria Augustanæ civitatis and imposed himself as archbishop of Lyon after the death of archbishop Burchard in 1033, and that \"Burchardus III Archiep. Lugd. olim August. Episc.\" was captured by imperial troops and sent into exile in 1034 . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . \"Burchardus Agannensis abbatiæ abbas \" donated property by charter dated 10 Jul 1068 .\n\n3. AYMON (-13 Jul [1054]). \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . Benedictine abbot of Saint-Maurice d'Agaune. Bishop of Sion 1040. \"Aymonis episcopi\" enfeoffed a vassal with property \"per manum Odvolrici eiusdem ecclesie aduocati\" by charter dated 23 Dec 1043 . \"Domni Aimoni Sedunensis episcopi \" subscribed the charter of his presumed first cousin dated [1046] . \"Aimo, Sedun episcopus\" donated property, inherited from \"avunculo meo comite Oudolrico in villam Ursaria\", to the church of Sion \"per manum advocatis mei comitis Oudalrici\" by charter dated 12 Jun 1052 . \"Aymo Sedunensis episcopus\" exchanged property \"in comitatu Valensi in loco Caldro\" [Chatres] with his vassal \"Vuarnerio\", by the hand of \"advocati eiusdem ecclesie Upoldi\", by charter dated 13 Mar 1054 . The necrology of Sion records the death \"III Id Jul\" of \"Aymonis episcopi\" .\n\n4. ODDON ([1017]-1 Mar 1060, bur Torino, cathedral of San Giovanni) . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . Marchese di Susa [1046], by right of his wife. Comte de Chablais.\n\n- see below.\n\nB. COMTES de SAVOIE et de MAURIENNE 1060-1417\n\nODDON de Maurienne, son of HUMBERT Comte de Maurienne & his wife Auxilia --- ([1017]-1 Mar 1060, bur Turin, cathedral of San Giovanni) . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . Marchese di Susa [1046], by right of his wife, her territories extending between the Alps and the River Po (including Auriate, Turino, Ivrea and Aosta) and to the Mediterranean between Ventimiglia and Albenga, and including control of the Alpine passes of Mont-Cenis and Saint-Bernard . \"Odo marchio\" subscribed the charter of his presumed nephew dated [1046] . He succeeded his brother in [1051] as ODDON Comte de Maurienne et de Chablais. \"Odo marchio\" donated property to the church of Tarantasia, for the soul of \"patris mei Humbertus comes\", by charter dated 1051 . \"Oddo et uxor mea Adalaicis et filii mei Petrus Admedeus et filie mee\" donated churches to Oulx by charter dated May 1057 . The importance of the family's role in contemporary European politics is demonstrated by the marriage of Comte Oddon's daughter to the future king of Germany. The necrology of San Andreo di Torino records the death \"XIV Kal Feb\" of \"Dnis Oddonis Marchionis\" .\n\nm ([1046]) as her third husband, ADELAIDA di Susa, Marchesa di Susa, widow firstly of HERMANN IV Duke of Swabia and secondly of ENRICO Marchese di Monferrato, daughter of MANFREDO UDALRICO Marchese di Susa & his wife Berta degli Obertenghi (Turin 1020-Canischio in Canavese 27 Dec 1091, bur Turin, cathedral of San Giovanni). Her first marriage is confirmed by Herimannus who records that \"Hermannus quoque dux Alamanniæ\" was granted \"marcham soceri sui Maginfredi in Italia\" by the emperor in 1034 . Her second marriage is confirmed by the charter dated 1043 under which \"Henricus marchio filius quondam Wilielmi similiter marchioni et Adalena comitissa jugales filia quondam bo. me. Oldrici Maginfredi marchioni\" donated property to San Antonino . Her third marriage is confirmed by the Annalista Saxo which names \"Adelheidis que soror erat comitis qui agnominatus est de Monte Bardonis in Italia et Immule seu Irmingardis\" as wife of \"Ottonis marchionis de Italia\" . \"Oddo et uxor mea Adalaicis et filii mei Petrus Admedeus et filie mee\" donated churches to Oulx by charter dated May 1057 . She was regent for her son in 1060 after the death of her husband, playing a significant role in support of Heinrich IV King of Germany, her son-in-law, in his disputes with the papacy. \"Dominus Petrus Marchio filius quond. bonæ memoriæ Oddonis marchionis cum domina Adheleida comitissa matre sua\" signed a charter dated 31 Jul 1064 . \"Adelegida comitissa\" donated property to Pinerolo, for the souls of \"domni Manfredi marchionis genitoris mei et Adalrici episcopi Barbani mei et Bertæ genetricis meæ et domni Odonis marchionis viri mei\", by charter dated 8 Sep 1064, signed by \"Petri, Amedei, Vitelmi qui Bruno vicecomes vocatur Henrici qui vocatur Marchio \" . \"Adalaxia cometissa filia quondam Maginfredus marchio\" donated property to Pinerolo by charter dated 23 Jul 1075 .

PIERRE de Savoie ([1047/49]-killed 9 Aug 1078) . \"Hubertus comes\" donated property to the canons of Saint-Jean and Saint-Urse by charter dated 1040, signed and consented to by \"Oddo, Amedeus comes, Aymo Sedunensis episcopus, Brochardus filius Huberti comitis, Petrus marchio filius Odonis marchionis et commitissæ\" . \"Oddo et uxor mea Adalaicis et filii mei Petrus Admedeus et filie mee\" donated churches to Oulx by charter dated May 1057 . He succeeded his father in 1060 as PIERRE I Comte de Savoie, Aosta, Maurienne et Chablais, Marchese di Susa, under the regency of his mother until 1064. \"Dominus Petrus Marchio filius quond. bonæ memoriæ Oddonis marchionis cum domina Adheleida comitissa matre sua\" signed a charter dated 31 Jul 1064 . \"Adelegida comitissa\" donated property to Pinerolo, for the souls of \"domni Manfredi marchionis genitoris mei et Adalrici episcopi Barbani mei et Bertæ genetricis meæ et domni Odonis marchionis viri mei\", by charter dated 8 Sep 1064, signed by \"Petri, Amedei, Vitelmi qui Bruno vicecomes vocatur Henrici qui vocatur Marchio \" . \"Domna Adelaida comitissa filia cum filiis suis Petro et Amedeo\" donated property to Novalesa, for the soul of \"mariti sui Oddonis\", by charter dated 16 Jul 1078 . He appears to have come to a violent end . m (1064) AGNES dAquitaine, daughter of GUILLAUME VII \"Acerrimus/l'Aigret\" Duke of Aquitaine, [GUILLAUME V Comte de Poitou] & his wife Ermésinde --- ([1052]-after 18 Jun 1089). Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by the charter dated 26 Oct 1078 under which \"Agnes filia quondam Guillelmi Pictaviensis comitis et relicta marchionis Petri\" donated property to Pinerolo . Agnes´s father is not identified more precisely in any document which has so far been identified. However, the reference to \"quondam\" in the 26 Oct 1078 charter excludes Guillaume VIII Duke of Aquitaine who was still alive at that date. Duke Guillaume VI, who died in 1038, is also probably excluded, as Agnes would have been over 26 years old at the time of her marriage if she had been his daughter, which seems improbable as noble girls often married when aged 12 to 15 at the time. Duke Guillaume VII is therefore left as the most likely candidate to be Agnes´s father. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Agnes was the widow of Ramiro I King of Aragon. Szabolcs de Vajay states that the wife of King Ramiro was the daughter of Guillaume VI Duke of Aquitaine not of Duke Guillaume VII, although no source is cited to support this . From an onomastic point of view, it is surprising that a daughter of Duke Guillaume VI would have been named Agnes. The name appears only in the family of the Comtes de Poitou after the third marriage of Duke Guillaume V with Agnes de Mâcon [Bourgogne-Comté], whereas Duke Guillaume VI was the son of Duke Guillaume V's first marriage. \"Adalegida cometissa filia Maginfredi marchionis et relicta quond. Oddonis idemque marchionis\" donated property to the monastery at Taurini, in the presence of \"domne Agnetis comitissæ, filiæ Wilelmi comitis et relictæ quondam Petri marchionis\", for the souls of \"Maginfredi patris, Adalrici Astensis episcopi patrui, Berthæ matris et Petri marchionis filii predictæ comitissæ Adalegidæ\", by charter dated 4 Jul 1079 . \"Adalasia comitissa cum nuru sua Agneta et filia eius Agnete\" donated property to \"ecclesiæ S.

Comte Pierre I & his wife had [three] children:\n\na) AGNES de Savoie ([1066/70]-after 13 Mar 1110) . \"Adalasia comitissa cum nuru sua Agneta et filia eius Agnete\" donated property to \"ecclesiæ S. Mariæ Astensis episcopatus\" by charter dated 18 Jun 1089 . Her birth date is estimated from the marriage date of her parents, her mother's estimated birth date, and the fact that Agnes herself gave birth to three children before her husband died in 1091. \"Agnes filia Petri marchionis et relicta olim Friderici\" donated property to the monastery of Cavorre by charter dated 1091 . She became a nun after her husband died. She was still alive in 1100 . Pope Pascal II confirmed a donation to the monastery of Fruttuaria San Benedetto by \"Agnete comitissa, Petri marchionis filia\" by charter dated 13 Mar 1110 . m (Turin May 1080) FRIEDRICH Graf, Herr von Lützelburg, son of LOUIS de Mousson châtelain de Montbéliard & his wife Sophie of Upper Lotharingia heiress of Bar (-29 Jun 1091, bur [Canossa]). He was a powerful lord in Swabia who supported Rudolf von Rheinfelden as anti-king of Germany. He arrived in Italy and was installed in [1079/May 1080] as Marchese di Susa by his [future] wife's paternal grandmother , the installation presumably taking place after the death in Jan 1080 of his wife's uncle Amedée II Comte de Savoie who had succeeded his older brother as Marchese di Susa in 1078.\n\nb) [ALIX de Savoie (-after 21 Dec 1099) . \"Bonifacius marchio filius Teutonis marchio cum Alice cometissa filia qd. d. Petri marchio atque Theotone, Petro, Magnifredo, Hugone et Willielmo filiis eorum\" donated property to \"monasterio sancti Petri in villa Saviliani\" by charter dated 21 Dec 1099 . Szabolcs de Vajay dismisses this individual as an imaginary person designed to explain the claims of Marchese Bonifazio to Turin, which he in fact inherited through his mother who was the younger sister of Adelaida di Susa, mother of Comte Pierre . It is uncertain whether he was aware of the charter quoted above when he made this suggestion. Even if the charter in question was spurious, it is unclear what purpose would have been served by fabricating the ancestry of Marchese Bonifazio´s wife. It should be noted that Bonifazio´s [second] wife Agnes de Vermandois was considerably younger than her husband. An earlier marriage would therefore be likely. m as his first wife, BONIFACIO di Saluzzo Marchese del Vasto, son of ODDONE Marchese di Liguria Occidentale & his wife Berta di Susa (-after 1127).]\n\nc) [BERTHE ([1075]-before 1111) . Szabolcs de Vajay suggests that Berta, second wife of Pedro I King of Aragon, was the daughter of Comte Pierre, although there appears to be no direct proof that this is correct. He further suggests that, when Emperor Heinrich IV captured Tuscany in 1092, Berthe could have taken refuge at her mother's court at Poitiers from where her marriage was arranged, her future husband's first wife having been her mother's first cousin. Zurita who, while in relation to Queen Berta stating that no se escrive cuya hija fuesse, comments that en las historias de Castilla...el Rey Don Alonso que ganó a Toledo tuvo...una [muger] llamada Berta que era natural de Toscana [third wife of Alfonso VI King of Castile, see the document CASTILE KINGS for the primary sources on which this statement is based], that el Emperador Henrico avia casado con Berta hija de Otho Marques de Italia, and that parece verisimil que esta Reyna Berta sucediesse de aquella casa de los Marqueses de Italia . Berta is named in charters in Aragon from 16 Aug 1097 to 1105 . Berta...regina donated tres campos...et uno orto in Huesca to don Bruno mea magistro by charter dated Jul [1101] . Ubieto Arteta points out that Bruno was [un] nombre completamente desconocido en la omomástica aragonesa del siglo XI e importado indudablemente de Italia o de Francia and suggesting that this could suggest an Italian origin for Queen Berta, although recognising that el argumento...apenas tiene fuerza, pues se da el nombre de Bruno en el Midi y en las poblaciones de francos . Szabolcs de Vajay identifies the grantee Bruno as the son of Friedrich Graf, Herr von Lützelburg (see the document BAR) and his wife Agnes de Savoie (who was recorded as the daughter of Pierre Comte de Savoie and therefore would have been the sister of Queen Berta if her Savoy affiliation was correct) . This may appear unlikely considering that the son of Graf Friedrich cannot have been born much earlier than [1086] and therefore would have been no more than 10 years old at the most at the time of King Pedro's marriage in 1097. Pedro I King of Aragon donated villa...Buniales to abbate don Galindo, at the request of uxoris mee Berta regina, by charter dated Jan 1103 . Berta regina granted in Sangarren...kasas que fuerunt domni Hormat Ibn Motert Ibn Alabe to Enneco Banzones by charter dated 1105, the dating clause of which records cognatum meum rege domni Antefonso, me sub gratia domnum meum rege domno Petro...et cum amore...cognatum meum in Auguero et in Moriello, in Arrigolis et in Merquerlo, in Aiierve et in Sangarren et in Kalgen [Agüero, Murillo, Riglos, Marcuello, Ayerbe, Sangarren and Callén] . Berta regina donated almunia...inter Berbegal et Monte Rog to the monastery of Alaon by charter dated to [1105], the dating clause of which records Antefonso cognato meo in Pampilona et in Aragona, in Superarvi et in Ripacurcia, me autem regnante in Murello et in Auvero et in Aierb... . Ubieto Arteta refers to the areas named in these two charters as governed by Queen Berta as el reino que llamamos de los Mallos, adding that la existencia del pequeño Estado...fué efimera and that antes de 1111...estaba a punto de desaparecer (he does not cite the primary source on which he bases this date) . Szabolcs de Vajay assumes that it disappeared when the queen died . Although the area is called reino and Estado by Ubieto Arteta, there appears no reason to suppose from the wording of these two charters that the territory was anything other than a señorío granted by King Pedro as dower for his wife, and that it was governed in the same way as any other señorío in the kingdom of Aragon. Berta would have continued to bear the title queen after her husband´s death, and the phrase me autem regnante in the second document should not be interpreted other than as the normal way in which administration of a territory by a queen could be described without implying that the area had become a kingdom. m (Huesca 16 Aug 1097) as his second wife, PEDRO I King of Aragon and Navarre, son of SANCHO I Ramírez King of Aragon and Navarre & his first wife Isabel de Urgel ([1066/18 Aug 1068]-Valle de Aran 27 Sep 1104, bur Monastery of San Juan de la Peña).]\n\n2. AMEDEE de Savoie ([1048/50]-26 Jan 1080, bur Saint-Jean de Maurienne) . \"Oddo et uxor mea Adalaicis et filii mei Petrus Admedeus et filie mee\" donated churches to Oulx by charter dated May 1057 . \"Adelegida comitissa\" donated property to Pinerolo, for the souls of \"domni Manfredi marchionis genitoris mei et Adalrici episcopi Barbani mei et Bertæ genetricis meæ et domni Odonis marchionis viri mei\", by charter dated 8 Sep 1064, signed by \"Petri, Amedei, Vitelmi qui Bruno vicecomes vocatur Henrici qui vocatur Marchio \" . His parentage is confirmed by the Annals of Lambert which record that Heinrich IV King of Germany was in \"Cinis\" [Mont-Cénis] in Italy at Christmas 1077 to meet \"socrum suam filiumque eius Amedeum\" , the latter being the king's brother-in-law. \"Domna Adelaida comitissa filia cum filiis suis Petro et Amedeo\" donated property to Novalesa, for the soul of \"mariti sui Oddonis\", by charter dated 16 Jul 1078 . He succeeded his brother in 1078 as AMEDEE II Comte de Savoie, Marchese di Susa. The necrology of Torino San Andreo records the death \"VII Kal Feb\" of \"comes Amedeus de Sabaudia\" . m ([1065/70]) JEANNE, daughter of --- (-[1095]). The primary source which confirms her marriage has not yet been identified. Guichenon names her as the wife of Comte Amedée II referring to various secondary sources . Her origin is not known. Guichenon, referring to \"Henninges\" (no precise citation), suggests \"avec assurance et probabilité\" that she was Jeanne de Genève, daughter of Gerold Comte de Genève & his first wife Gisela --- . From his discussion, it does not appear that this speculation is based on any surviving primary source and it is not known how accurate it might be. Comte Amedée II & his wife had [five] children:\n\na) ADELAIDE de Savoie ([1068/72]-before 1115) . Her parentage and marriage are confirmed by the charter dated 1090 under which \"Adelais comitissa filia quondam bonæ memoriæ comitis et marchionis Amedei\" confirmed the donations by \"Manasses dominus de Coloniaco quondam maritus meus\" to Nantua, for the soul of \"patris sui Manassis\", signed by \"Humbertus et Manasses filii mei\" . Her birth date is estimated from her sons being named in 1090, and bearing in mind her father's estimated birth date. m MANASSES [II] Seigneur de Coligny, son of MANASSES [I] & his wife --- (-after 1086).\n\nb) [AUXILIA (-[6 Sep] after 1094) . The wife of Humbert [II] Seigneur de Beaujeu is named in three charters: \"Auxilia uxor domni Humberti\" donated property to Notre-Dame de Beaujeu by undated charter, dated in the compilation to [1090] . \"Umberti, Auxilie uxoris sue\" subscribed the charter dated 1090 which records the donation to Notre-Dame de Beaujeu by \"Stephanus\" . \"Domnus Humbertus et uxor sua Auxilia et infantes eorum Guicchardus et Humbertus et Guigo et Ugo\" confirmed the donation to Notre-Dame de Beaujeu by Herbert de Senecé by charter dated 1094 . The necrology of Notre-Dame de Beaujeu records \"Humberti et Auxilie uxoris domini Bellijoci\" on \"VII Id Sep\" , but it is not clear which death is commemorated. She is named in Europäische Stammtafeln as the daughter of Comte Amedée, but the primary source on which this is based has not yet been identified. Presumably this supposition is based on the undated charter, dated in the compilation to [1080/90], under which \"Humbertus Beljocensis\", who was married to \"filiam Amedei comitis Savoiensis\", donated property \"Carruptum [et] Capolerium\" to Notre-Dame de Beaujeu . Guichenon suggests that there is confusion between Auxilia and Alix de Savoie, wife of Humbert [III] Seigneur de Beaujeu (see below) . The basis for dating the charter in question to [1080/90] has not been ascertained and, assuming that this does not depend on dating the church dignitaries who are named in the document (\"Petri, Guiscardi et Stephani supradictæ ecclesie\"), the confusion appears possible. m ([1080]) as his second wife, HUMBERT [II] Seigneur de Beaujeu, son of GUICHARD [II] Seigneur de Beaujeu & his wife Richoara [de Salornay] (-[1102/03]).]\n\nc) HUMBERT de Savoie ([1072]- Moûtiers 19 Oct 1103, bur Moûtiers) . \"Umbertus comes, filius quondam Amedei\" donated property to the monastery at Pinerolo by charter dated 29 Nov 1098 .

The wife of Ulrich [I] de Bâgé was daughter of Amedée I Comte de Maurienne according to Europäische Stammtafeln . This seems difficult to support chronologically, in light of the known dates of death of two of the sons of Ulric de Bâgé (1180 and 1184 respectively) which suggest that they were born after 1100. If her father was a Count of Savoy, it is more likely that he was Amedée II. m ULRIC [I] de Bâgé et de Bresse, son of JOSSERAN [Gaulseran] Seigneur de Bâgé et de Bresse & his wife --- (before 1074-after 1125).]\n\n3. BERTHE de Savoie (21 Sep 1051-Mainz 27 Dec 1087, bur Speyer Cathedral) . The Annalista Saxo names \"Bertam filiam Ottonis marchionis de Italia et Adelheidis que soror erat comitis qui agnominatus est de Monte Bardonis in Italia et Immule seu Irmingardis\" as wife of King Heinrich . Her husband proposed to repudiate her in 1069, but withdrew his demand . The dispute was finally settled in 1077 when Empress Bertha's mother intervened to prevent any repudiation in return for mediating between the emperor and Pope Gregory VII in Canossa . The Annales Sancti Diibodi record the death in 1087 of \"Bertha imperatrix\" and her burial \"apud Moguntiam\" . The necrology of Regensburg St Emmeran records the death \"VI Kal Jan\" of \"Berhta imperatrix\" . The necrology of Speyer records the death \"VI Kal Jan\" of \"Bertha imperatrix\" . m (betrothed Zurich 25 Dec 1055, Tribur 13 Jul 1066) as his first wife, HEINRICH IV King of Germany, son of Emperor HEINRICH III & his second wife Agnès de Poitou ([Goslar] 11 Nov 1050-Liège 7 Aug 1106, bur Speyer Cathedral). He was crowned Emperor at Rome 31 Mar 1084.\n\n4. ADELAIDE ([1052/53]-[Schloß Twiel] early 1079, bur St Blasius) . The Annales of Berthold, which record the death in 1079 of \"uxor regis Roudolfi Adelheit, filia Adelheidæ marchionissæ, soror Berhtæ reginæ uxoris Heinrici\", confirm that Adelaide was the daughter of Adelaida di Susa . Adelaide's daughter Adelheid is named with \"progenitoribus Rodolfo rege et Adelheida regina matertera Heinrici quarti inperatoris\" in a charter dated [1079/10 Oct 1086] . It is assumed that she was the daughter of her mother's third marriage but this is not certain. Europäische Stammtafeln shows Adelaide's birth date as \"after 1052\", presumably based on the likelihood that she was born after her sister Berthe, as Heinrich IV King of Germany would presumably have married the older daughter. Concerning her marriage date, it is likely that the marriage took place after the marriage of her sister, assuming that Oddon was her father. She is named \"Adalheid coniux Ruodulfi ducis\" in the Annales Weissemburgenses, which record that she was accused of being unchaste, was repudiated by her husband two years later, but that Pope Alexander arranged a reconciliation, dated to [1069/71] . A continuation of the Annales of St Gallen records that uxor Rudolphi ducis was accused of adultery with Werinhario commite suo cognato . The Annales of Berthold record that \"rex Roudolfus uxor\" was \"in partes Burgundiæ a Turego divertens\", suffering \"iniurias\" in \"quodam castello suo\" . The wife of \"Rudolfus rex de Arle\" is named \"Adelheidis\" in a list of founders of the monastery of St Peter in Schwarzwald . The Annales Sancti Blasii record the death in 1079 of \"Adelheit uxor Roudolfi regis\" and her burial \"apud Sanctum Blasium\" . The Annales of Berthold record the death in 1079 of \"uxor regis Roudolfi Adelheit, filia Adelheidæ marchionissæ, soror Berhtæ reginæ uxoris Heinrici\" and her burial \"ad monasterium Sancti Blasii\" .

According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Adelaide married firstly Guigues Comte d'Albon. Another table in Europäische Stammtafeln shows the first wife of Guigues Comte d'Albon as \"Adelais (von Turin)\" and their son Guigues II Comte d'Albon as co-heir of Adelaida Marchese di Susa in 1091 . The basis for this alleged first marriage has not been found, but it is unlikely to be correct considering the estimated birth date of Adelaide.] m ([1061/62]) as his second wife, RUDOLF von Rheinfelden Duke of Swabia, son of KUNO Graf & his wife --- (before 1027-killed in battle near Hohenmölsen, Merseburg [15/16] Oct 1080, bur Merseburg Cathedral). He was elected King of Germany in 1077.\n\n5. ODDON de Savoie (-[Jul 1095/1099]). He is named by Guichenon as the son of Comte Oddon and his wife, stating that the parentage is confirmed in \"plusieurs titres\" although he cites none of these recognisably . None of these primary sources has so far been identified. He was not named in his parents´ charter dated May 1057 under which \"Oddo et uxor mea Adalaicis et filii mei Petrus Admedeus et filie mee\" donated churches to Oulx , indicating that he was considered too young at the time to be mentioned and suggesting that he was his parents´ youngest child. Bishop of Asti 1073/1079. His last documentary mention is 28 Mar 1095, but his bishopric is still referred to in Jul 1095 .\n\nHUMBERT de Savoie, son of AMEDEE II Comte de Savoie & his wife Jeanne [de Genève] ([1072]-Moûtiers 19 Oct 1103, bur Moûtiers) . \"Umbertus comes, filius quondam Amedei\" donated property to the monastery at Pinerolo by charter dated 29 Nov 1098 . He succeeded his father in 1080 as HUMBERT II \"le Renforcé\" Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie, under the regency of his paternal grandmother. On her death in 1091, Humbert lost much of her territories, retaining only the valley of Susa . He was the first of his family to strengthen relations with France, diverting his attention from Italy after the loss of most of the family's Italian possessions. \"Ubertus filii qda Amedo\" donated property to Santa Maria d´Ivrea by charter dated 14 Sep 1094 . \"Nantelmus\" confirmed the foundation of the priory of Bellevaux en Bauges [\"Bellævalles supra villam Boggarum\"], with the support of \"Humberto comite\", by charter dated to the end-11th century . \"Humbertus comes et marchio\" donated property to the abbey of Aulps [\"in pago Gebennensi in valle Alpis\"], with the consent of \"Girardo Alingiensi et Gilione de Rovorea quorum feudem est\", by charter dated to [1094], witnessed by \"Girardus Alingiensis, Rodulphus de Fulciniaco, Uldricus comes, Anselmus, Willelmus, Amedeus filius eiusdem Girardi\" . \"Humbertus comes et Girardus de Alingio et Gislo miles a quibus est ille locus\" consented to the agreement between the abbey of Molesme and the abbey of Aulps, recorded in a charter dated 1097 . \"Umbertus comes filius quondam Amedei\" donated property to Pinerolo by charter dated 29 Nov 1098 . The necrology of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne records the death \"XIV Kal Nov\" of \"Humbertus comes Maur.\" .\n\nm ([1090]) as her first husband, GISELE de Bourgogne, daughter of GUILLAUME I Comte Palatin de Bourgogne, Comte de Vienne et de Mâcon & his wife Etiennette --- ([1075]-after 1133). Her parentage is deduced from Suger stating that her daughter Adelaide, wife of Louis VI \"le Gros\" King of France, was the niece of Pope Calixtus II . This is corroborated by \"Guido Viennensis archiepiscopus\" (later Pope Calixtus II) addressing a letter to \"nepoti suo Amedeo comiti\" (Amedée III Comte de Savoie, son of Gisèle by her first marriage) dated [1115] . Her date of birth is estimated from her having given birth to five children by her second husband whom she married in [1105], and assuming that she was no more than 17 years old when she gave birth to her first child by her first husband. \"Amedeus comes\" donated property to Saint-Jean de Maurienne, for the soul of \"patris sui Uberti comtis\", with the consent of \"Gisla matre et fratribus eius Guillelmo atque Umberto\", by charter dated 21 Oct 1104 . She married secondly ([1105]) Ranieri Marchese di Monferrato. Her second marriage is confirmed by Orderic Vitalis who records the marriage of Guillaume de Normandie and the daughter of Raniero III Marchese di Monferrato, naming both the bride's parents and specifying that the marriage was arranged by the bride's uterine half-sister, Adélaïde de Maurienne Queen of France .\n\nComte Humbert II & his wife had [seven] children:\n\n1. ADELAIDE de Maurienne ([1092]-Montmartre 18 Nov 1154, bur Montmartre, église abbatiale de Saint-Pierre) . Her first marriage is recorded by Orderic Vitalis, who also names her father and her four oldest sons . The De Genere Comitum Flandrensium, Notæ Parisienses records \"filiam Humberti comitis Morienne\" as wife of \"Ludovicum regem Grossum\" . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"regina Alaydis soror Amadei comitis Sabaudie\" as wife of \"Ludovici Grossi\" . She exercised considerable influence over her husband, playing an active part in the downfall of Etienne de Garlande, Chancellor of France. After the accession of her son as King Louis VII in 1137, Adelaide conspired against Suger, Abbé de Saint-Denis, triggering a quarrel with her son who exiled her and her second husband to her lands in Compiègne. Her second marriage is confirmed by an undated charter which records a donation to the priory of Saint-Nicolas d´Acy, near Senlis made in the presence of \"dominæ Adelæ reginæ et domini Mathei mariti eius\" . In 1153, she retired to the church of the Abbaye de Saint-Pierre at Montmartre, which she had founded .

According to Europäische Stammtafeln , the wife of Archambaud [VII] was the daughter of Comte Humbert II. The primary source which confirms that this is correct has not yet been identified but no indication has been found to indicate that it is incorrect. However, it is surprising that Archambaud VII (who was a bachelor, and probably in his mid-thirties, at the time of his marriage) would have married a spinster in her late thirties (Agnes must have been born before 1104 if she was the daughter of Comte Humbert). The reference in the charter referred to above to \"Agnetis comitissæ\" indicates that Agnes was of higher rank by birth than her husband. m (before 25 Jan 1140) ARCHAMBAUD [VII] Seigneur de Bourbon, son of AYMON [II] \"Vaire-Vache\" Seigneur de Bourbon & his wife Lucie de Nevers (-1171).]\n\nAMEDEE de Maurienne, son of HUMBERT II \"le Renforcé\" Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie & his wife Gisèle de Bourgogne [Comté] (Montmélian [1095]-Nicosia 30 Aug 1148) . \"Amedeus comes\" donated property to Saint-Jean de Maurienne, for the soul of \"patris sui Uberti comtis\", with the consent of \"Gisla matre et fratribus eius Guillelmo atque Umberto\", by charter dated 21 Oct 1104, witnessed by \"Odo de Camera et frater eius Amedeus, Esmio de Camera et frater eius Bernardus, Aymo de Bocsosello, Guillelmus de Rossilione\" . \"Amedeus comes et fratres mei, unacum genitrice nostra Gisla\" donated property to the church of Belley, for the soul of \"patris nostri Humberti comitis\", by undated charter .

The emperor recognised his title as Count of the Holy Roman Empire in 1111.

He accompanied his nephew Louis VII King of France on crusade but died in Cyprus. The Continuator of Sigebert records that \"Amadeus comes Maurianensis\" died \"in Cipro insula\" in 1148 .\n\nm firstly ([1120/23]) ADELAIDE, daughter of --- (-after Jul 1134). \"Comes Amedeus cum uxore sua Adeleida comitissa\" confirmed the rights of the monastery of \"S. Justi in villa Volveria\" by charter dated 27 Jul 1134, witnessed by \"Umbertus de Bocsosello, Aimo de Brianzone \" . Europäische Stammtafeln shows the single marriage of Comte Amedée III, to Mathilde d'Albon, in 1123 . Given the likely birth dates of Alix de Savoie, oldest daughter of Comte Amedée, and of Mathilde d'Albon (see below), it is unlikely that Mathilde was the mother of Alix. A first marriage of Comte Amedée is therefore highly probable. Palluel shows Comte Amedée III's first wife as Gertrude de Lorraine, daughter of Simon I Duke of Lorraine . This can be dismissed as incorrect. Neither Europäische Stammtafeln nor Poull refers to any such daughter of Duke Simon. In addition, bearing in mind that Duke Simon himself was probably born in 1096 , it is chronologically impossible for any daughter of his to have given birth to a child in [1123/25]. Her marriage date is estimated based on the estimated birth date of the couple's supposed elder daughter, Alix de Savoie, as shown below. The origin of Adelaide is unknown. However, according to Europäische Stammtafeln, her supposed daughter Alix was Dame de Châteauneuf-en-Valromey, de Virieu-le-Grand, et de Cordon-en-Bugey . Further research to trace the ownership of these fiefdoms may provide clues about the origin of Adelaide.\n\nm secondly ([Jul 1134/1135]) MATHILDE d'Albon, daughter of GUIGUES [V] Comte d'Albon [Viennois] & his wife Regina [Matilda] --- ([1112/16]-after 30 Mar 1148). \"A. comes et marchio cum uxore sua M.\" donated property to the monastery of Ripalta, with the support of \"eorum filio Umberto\", by charter dated 9 Jan 1137 . The Aymari Rivalli De Allobrogibus records that \"Amedeo secundo, Mauriennæ comiti\" married \"Guigona Crassi filia\" . The identity of her father is clarified as the passage also names \"Humbertus minor Crassi filius\" and his appointment ot \"archiepiscopatum Viennensem\". Europäische Stammtafeln shows a single marriage of Comte Amedée III, to Mathilde d'Albon, in 1123. It is more likely that Mathilde was his second wife, as explained above, especially if her likely birth date range is correct. According to Europäische Stammtafeln , Mathilde's parents were married in [1106-1110]. The same table shows that Mathilde's two brothers, Guigues and Humbert, were mentioned in 1110, indicating that the marriage must have taken place during the earlier part of this date range. A third child, Gersende d'Albon, must also have born during the early years of her parents' marriage as she herself gave birth to two sons before (or shortly after) the death of her husband in Oct 1129. Assuming all these dates are correct, the timescale is tight for the birth of a fourth child, Mathilde, before 1112 at the earliest. This would make it impossible for Mathilde to have been the mother of Comte Amedée's oldest daughter Alix. \"Amedeus comes et marchio et Maies comitissa uxor eius et Umbertus eorum filius\" donated property to the monastery of Saint-Maurice by charter dated 30 Mar 1143 . \"Amedeus comes et marchio\" confirmed donations to Saint-Sulpice en Bugey, for the soul of \"filii mei Humberti\", by charter dated to [1148], which also names \"uxore mea Matildi\", confirmed by \"Aalasia comitissa de Bello Joco cum filio meo Guichardo\" . \"Amedeus comes et marchio et Majes comitissa uxor eius et Umbertus eorum filius\" confirmed the rights of the monastery of Saint-Maurice d´Agaune by charter dated 30 Mar 1148 .\n\nComte Amedée III & his first wife had two children:\n\n1. ALIX [Elise] de Savoie ([1123/25]-) . Her origin is alluded to in the Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines which names \"pater Wichardi [de Belloico] senior Humbertus\" as \"nepos ex sorore comitis Sabaudie\", although she is not named in this source . Her birth date range is estimated based on the birth of her second son in 1142, as shown in Europäische Stammtafeln . Dame de Châteauneuf-en-Valromey, de Virieu-le-Grand, et de Cordon-en-Bugey . \"Amedeus comes et marchio\" confirmed donations to Saint-Sulpice en Bugey, for the soul of \"filii mei Humberti\", by charter dated to [1148], which also names \"uxore mea Matildi\", confirmed by \"Aalasia comitissa de Bello Joco cum filio meo Guichardo\" . m ([1140]) HUMBERT [III] Seigneur de Beaujeu, son of GUICHARD [IV] Seigneur de Beaujeu & his wife Lucienne de Rochefort ([1120]-[late Oct [1192]/1193]).\n\n2. MATHILDE de Savoie ([1125] -Coimbra 4 Nov 1157, bur Coimbra, Church of the Cross) . The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines refers to the wife of \"Aldefonsus rex Portugallie\" as \"filia comitis Sabaudie\" but does not name her . The De Rebus Hispaniæ of Rodericus Ximenes records the marriage of \"Aldefonsum\" and \"Mafaldam filiam Comitis Maurienæ\" . The Chronicon Lusitanum records the marriage in 1183 (1145) of Rex Donnus Alfonsus and Donnam Matildam, Comitis Amadæi de Moriana filiam, adding that they had three sons and three daughters . Brandaõ quotes a charter of the king dated 1146 which records anno...quo duxeramt Mahaldam and a charter dated Jul 1146 in which he records a donation cum uxore mea Regina Dona Mafalda . It is likely that Mathilde was the daughter of Comte Amedée III's first marriage, although no proof has been found that this is correct. As she gave birth to her first child in 1147 , it is improbable that she was the daughter of Comte Amedée III's marriage with Mathilde d'Albon for the same reasons of chronology as explained above. She was known as dona MAFALDA in Portugal. Alfonsus, Portugaliæ rex, comitis Henrici et reginæ Theresiæ filius, magni quoque regis Alfonsi nepos cum uxore mea regina donna Malfada, filia comitis Amedei de Moriana confirmed donations to La Charité-sur-Loire by his father by charter dated Jul 1145 .

He succeeded in 1150 as HUMBERT III Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie. \"Humbertus Mauriacensis comes et marchio\" donated \"locum de Tyneres\" {Tinières} to the abbey of Hautcrêt by charter dated 1150 . He established close relations with Henry II King of England, negotiating the marriage of one of his daughters with the king's son John . He attempted to regain control over Turin and the surrounding lands, but came into conflict with Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" who was also extending his power in northern Italy. Although the emperor was obliged to withdraw in 1168, he returned in 1174, burned the town of Susa in revenge for its opposition during his first Italian expedition, and deprived Comte Humbert of supremacy over the bishoprics of Turin, Belley and Tarentaise, placing them under the direct control of the empire. Comte Humbert continued to fight and, after refusing a summons to attend an imperial tribunal, was condemned in his absence to banishment from the empire and confiscation of his lands. Heinrich VI King of Germany was attempting to enforce the sentence on behalf of his father the emperor, when Comte Humbert died. \"Umbertus comes de Morienna\" granted privileges to the monastery of Santa Maria di Staffarda by charter dated 28 Jun 1172, witnessed by \"Rodulfus Alaman, Poncius de Confluent \" . The dating clause of a charter dated 20 Oct 1188, which records an agreement between the bishop of Maurienne and the canons of his cathedral, names \"Humberto comite presidente\" . The necrology of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne records the death \"IV Non Mar\" in 1189 of \"dognus Humbertus comes Maur. et marchio Italie\" . He was beatified in 1836.\n\nm firstly (before 3 Jan 1151) FAYDIVE, daughter of --- (-[1154]). \"Umbertus comes, Amedei comitis filius cum uxore sua Faidiva\" donated property by charter dated 3 Jan 1151 . The origins of Faydive are not known. Her unusual name suggests that she was Faydive de Toulouse, daughter of Alphonse I Jourdain Comte de Toulouse & his wife Faydive [Faydide] d'Uzès (-[1154]). However, she was not the only noble recorded with this name in south-western France during the early 12th century so this co-identity is not without doubt.\n\nm secondly ([1155], divorced before 1162) as her first husband, GERTRUDE de Flandre, daughter of THIERRY I Count of Flanders & his second wife Sibylle d'Anjou (-3 Mar after 1186). The Genealogica Comitum Flandriæ Bertiniana names (in order) \"Philippum, Matheum, Petrum et tres filias\" as the children of \"Theodericus filius ducis Alsatie [et] Sibillam\", not naming the daughters but specifying that \"quarum primogenita nupsit Amico comiti Intermontano\" . The Flandria Generosa names (in order) \"Gertrudem et Margaretam\" as the two daughters of Count Thierry & his second wife . The Flandria Generosa, in a later manuscript, names \"Gertrudis primogenita\" and her first husband \"comiti de Moriana\", from whom she was separated, and her second husband \"Hugoni de Oisi\", specifying that she later became a nun at \"Mencinis\" . She married secondly (after 1158) as his first wife, Hugues [III] d'Oisy Châtelain de Cambrai, and became a nun at Messines in [1177]. Philippe Count of Flanders, on the point of leaving on crusade, declared that \"sororis mee Gertrudis quondam Morianensis comitisse\" had renounced her inheritance before becoming a nun, by charter dated [24 Apr/12 Jun] 1177 .\n\nm thirdly (1164) as her second husband, KLEMENTIA von Zähringen, divorced wife of HEINRICH der Löwe Duke of Saxony and Bavaria, daughter of KONRAD Herzog von Zähringen & his wife Clémence de Namur (-[1173/75]). The Chronicon Sancti Michaelis Luneburgensis names \"filiam ducis Zaringie, Clementiam\" as wife of \"Heinricus dux\" . The Chronicon Hanoniense refers to \"filiam [uxorem] dux Saxonum Henricus\" as the daughter of \"ducissam Ciringiorum [filiam Godefridi comitis Namurcensi]\" . Heiress of Badenweiler, although her first husband sold these Swabian estates to Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\" King of Germany in 1158, receiving in exchange Herzberg, Scharzfels and Pöhlde south of the Harz . Her first marriage was arranged to confirm her father's alliance with the Welf party in southern Germany . The Annales Palidenses record the repudiation by \"Heinricus dux\" of his first wife \"Bertoldi ducis Zaringe sorore\" . Her first husband repudiated Klementia because of the growing difficulties between her brother Duke Berthold IV and Emperor Friedrich I \"Barbarossa\", with whom Duke Heinrich was by then in close alliance . Her second marriage is confirmed by Ralph de Diceto´s Ymagines Historiarum which record in 1173 the betrothal of Henricus rex Angliæ, Johanni filio suo cognomento sine terra and [her daughter] septenni filiam primogenitam Humberti comitis de Moriana...ex relicta Henrici Saxonis ducis .\n\nm fourthly ([1175]) BEATRIX de Vienne, daughter of GERARD Comte de Mâcon et de Vienne [Bourgogne-Comté] & his wife Maurette de Salins (-8 Apr 1230).

The necrology of Hautecombe records the death of \"Beatrix comitissa\" 8 Apr 1230 .\n\nComte Humbert III & his third wife had two children:\n\n1. ALIX de Maurienne ([1166]-1174) . Ralph de Diceto´s Ymagines Historiarum record in 1173 the betrothal of Henricus rex Angliæ, Johanni filio suo cognomento sine terra and septenni filiam primogenitam Humberti comitis de Moriana...ex relicta Henrici Saxonis ducis . Her parentage is specified by Matthew of Paris when he records this betrothal. Although he does not name her, he calls her \"filia primogenita\" . Benedict of Peterborough records the betrothal of \"Humbertus comes de Mauriana Aalis filiam suam majoram\" and \"rex Johannis filii sui iunioris\" at \"Alvernium Montem Ferratum\" in 1173 before 2 Feb, and the agreement whereby John would inherit the county of Maurienne if Humbert had no sons by his wife . The marriage contract between \"Johanni filio Henrici regis Angliæ\" and \"Humbertus comes Mauriensis et marchio Italiæ filia primogenita Aalis\" is dated 1173 . Betrothed (Auvergne 1173 before 2 Feb) to JOHN Prince of England, son of HENRY II King of England & his wife Eléonore Ctss dAquitaine (Beaumont Palace, Oxford 24 Dec 166 or 1167-Newark Castle, Lincolnshire 18/19 Oct 1216, bur Worcester Cathedral). He succeeded his brother King Richard I in 1199 as JOHN King of England.\n\n2. SOPHIE [Eléonore] de Maurienne ([1167/72]-3 Dec 1202) . An epitaph in the monastery of S. Giovanni Batista di Gemmola, placed there in 1578, records the death \"VI Id Mai\" in 1226 of (her daughter) \"Virgo Beatrix\" daughter of \"Marchio Estensis Azo\" and his \"coniuge patre Sabaudia cui comitatur\" .

She is not mentioned by Guichenon . As Comte Humberts daughter Alix was also described as seven years old in the source quoted above, this daughters supposed existence may be based on some confusion with Alix.]\n\nTHOMAS de Maurienne, son of HUMBERT III Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie & his fourth wife Béatrix de Vienne [Bourgogne-Comté] (Château de Carbonara 1178 after 26 Jun-Moncalieri 1 Mar 1233, bur Saint-Michel de la Cluse) . An undated charter records a donation to Saint-Maurice by \"felicis memorie Humbertus Savoie comes\" and the confirmation by \"Thomas filius eiusdem comitis\" . He succeeded his father in 1189 as THOMAS I Comte de Maurienne et de Savoie, under the regency of Guglielmo V Marchese di Monferrato who brokered a favourable settlement to Comte Humbert III's dispute with the empire . As Marchese Guglielmo was absent in Palestine at the time of the death of Comte Humbert III, the regency was presumably held and the negotiations carried out by his son Bonifazio, who succeeded as Marchese di Monferrato in 1192. This hypothesis appears confirmed by the following charter: \"Thomas Mauriannensis comes et marchio Italiæ\" confirmed the donations made by \"pater meus [et] domini comitis Humberti abavi mei\" to the canons of Saint-Jean de Maurienne, with the advice of \"B. matris mee et tutore meo Bonifacio marchione Montisferrati\", by charter dated 12 Jun 1189 . \"Thomæ comitis et marchionis et Nichola filia comitis Gebennarum\" granted privileges to the citizen of Susa by charter dated 25 Feb 1198 . He used the title Comte de Savoie: \"Thomas comes Sabaud. et Amedeus eius filius\" granted rights to the abbey of San Marco by charter dated 5 Mar 1200 . Comte Thomas supported the imperial party over the Guelfs, and was appointed Imperial Vicar in Italy. Philipp King of Germany granted him Moudon in Vaud, and Chieri and Testona in Piemonte in 1207. He also acquired Carignano, Pinerolo, Moncalieri, Vigone, Albenga and Savona in Piemonte. \"Thomas Maurianensis comes et marchio\" donated property to the abbey of Saint-Maurice, with the consent of \"filiis suis Amedeo et Humberto\", by charter dated 8 Nov 1217 . A charter dated 1224 records an agreement between \"Thomæ com. Sabaud\" and the bishop of Sion, witnessed by \"ipse Thomas comes, Amedeus primogenitus illius, Comitissa uxor Thomæ, eorum quatuor filii clerici Willelmus, Thomas, Petrus et Bonifacius\" . He bought the town of Chambéry in 1232. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records the death in 1232 of \"comitis Thome de Sabaudia\" . An indication of the precarious financial position of the counts of Savoy is provided by a third testament, dated 2 Nov 1240, made by Thomas´s son \"Amadeus com Sab. et marchio in Italia\" who repeated the nomination of \"Thomæ, Flandriæ comiti, fratri suo\" as his heir to \"totius comitatus sui Sabaudiæ marchionatus Italiæ et ducatus Chablasii\" if he died without male children, on condition that he satisfied all the debts of \"Thomæ comitis patris et Humberti fratris ipsorum\" .\n\nm ([1196]) MARGUERITE[Beatrix] de Genève, daughter of GUILLAUME [I] Comte de Genève & his second wife Béatrix de Faucigny (-8 Apr 1257, bur Abbaye de Hautecombe). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Margareta filia domni de Fusceneis de matre Guilelmi, filii Humberti comitis Gebenensis\" as wife of \"comitis Thome de Sabaudia\" . As noted below, Marguerite is also called Beatrix in later sources. No explanation has been found for these dual names. The fact that \"Beatrix\" appears in a seal shows that it was not a transcription error. \"Thomæ comitis et marchionis et Nichola [presumably a transcription error] filia comitis Gebennarum\" granted privileges to the citizen of Susa by charter dated 25 Feb 1198 . The Complete Peerage refers to unspecified \"later writers\" having evolved an incorrect theory that Thomas I Comte de Maurienne was married firstly to Béatrix and, after her death without issue, secondly to Marguerite, daughter of Guillaume de Faucigny, who was the mother of his children. The same source confirms that the two names in fact refer to the same person. A charter dated 1224 records an agreement between \"Thomæ com. Sabaud\" and the bishop of Sion, witnessed by \"ipse Thomas comes, Amedeus primogenitus illius, Comitissa uxor Thomæ, eorum quatuor filii clerici Willelmus, Thomas, Petrus et Bonifacius\" . \"M. comitissa Maurian. uxor Thomæ comitis Maurianensis et marchionis Italiæ\" donated property, with the consent of \"Thomas com.

His parentage is confirmed by, inter alia, Matthew of Paris who specifies that Beatrix de Savoie was \"soror comitis Sabaldiæ adhuc viventis Amidei\", when he records the marriage of her daughter to Henry III King of England . In a later passage, the same source records Amedée as \"primogenitus\" among the \"filii comitis Sabaudiæ Thomæ avunculi dominæ reginæ Angliæ Alienoræ\" . \"Thomas Maurianensis comes et marchio\" donated property to the abbey of Saint-Maurice, with the consent of \"filiis suis Amedeo et Humberto\", by charter dated 8 Nov 1217 .

Maurianæ et filii mei Amedeus et Aymo\", by charter dated Dec 1227 . \"M. comitissa Sabaudie et marchisa in Ytalia et Amedeus, Aymo, W. electus Valentinus, Thomas, Petrus, Bonifacius et Philippus filii Thome Comitis Sab. et marchionis in Ytalia\" confirmed donations to Hautecombe abbey by charter dated 26 Feb 1231 . \"Beatrix uxor comitis Thomæ, Amadeus primogenitus et Aymo filii eius\" confirmed the purchase of Chambéry by \"Thoma comite\" by charter dated 1232, with the seal of \"Beatricis comitisse Sabaudie\" . He succeeded his father in 1233 as AMEDEE IV Comte de Savoie, Marchese in Italy. \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie et in Italia marchio\" confirmed his father´s grant of privileges to Susa by charter dated 7 Mar 1233 . A charter dated 23 Jul 1234 records an agreement between \"Amedeum comitem Sabaudie\" and \"Aymonem et Petrum fratres ipsius\" in settlement of a dispute concerning their paternal inheritance . The first testament of \"Amedei comitis Sab. et marchionis Italie\", dated 23 Sep 1235, appoints \"Thomam fratrem suum\" as his heir \"in comitatu et marchionatu\" in default of male children . This document disinherits Thomas´s older brother Aimon. The second testament of \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\", dated 19 Jul 1238, repeats the nomination of \"Thomam fratrem suum\" as his heir, substituting \"Philippum, huic autem Petrum fratres suos\" if Thomas died without male heirs . He was an active supporter of Emperor Friedrich II. He acquired territories in Vaud and lower Valais. In 1238, Comte Amedée was created Duc de Chablais and Aosta, and nominated Imperial Vicar in northern Italy, by the emperor in reward for his support against the Lombards . Under a third testament, dated 2 Nov 1240, \"Amadeus com Sab. et marchio in Italia\" repeated the nomination of \"Thomæ, Flandriæ comiti, fratri suo\" as his heir to \"totius comitatus sui Sabaudiæ marchionatus Italiæ et ducatus Chablasii\" if he died without male children, on condition that he satisfied all the debts of \"Thomæ comitis patris et Humberti fratris ipsorum\" . A charter dated 1244 confirmed the peace agreement reached between the bishop of Lausanne and \"Amadeus comes Sabaudie et in Italia marcho et Petrus de Sabaudia frater suus\" . Emperor Friedrich II recognised Amedée's rights over Turin in 1248. On the emperor's death in 1250, Comte Amedée's reconciliation with Pope Innocent IV was sealed by the marriage of the Pope's niece to Comte Amedée's brother Thomas . A fourth testament of \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" is dated 19 Sep 1252, appoints \"Bonifacium filium meum\" as his heir, under the tutelage of his brother Thomas, substituting \"fratri meo Thome de Sabaudia comitis Beatricem filiam meam uxorem quondam Manfredi marchionis Salutiarum et Margaretam filiam meam uxorem Bonifacii marchionis Montisferrati\", and names \"Cecilie uxori nostre Beatrix filia mea minor\" . A fifth testament of Comte Amedée IV is dated 24 May 1253, appoints \"Bonifacius filius suus, sub tutela Thomæ comitis\" as his heir, substitutes \"filiæ Amedei comitis marchionissæ Beatrix Salutiarum et Margaretha Montisferrati\", bequeathes \"castrum Montis Meliani\" to \"Cæciliæ comitissæ\", and chooses to be buried at Hautecombe . An epitaph in Hautecombe abbey records the death \"III Id Jul\" in 1253 of \"Dominus Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" . Betrothed (28 Apr 1213) to AGNESE di Saluzzo, daughter of BONIFAZIO Marchese di Saluzzo & his wife Maria di Torres [in Sardinia] (-after 1219). The marriage contract between \"Thomam comitem Maurienne Amedeo f. dicti comitis\" and \"Manfredum II marchionem de Saluciis Agnetem f. quondam Bonefacii\" is dated 28 Apr 1213 . m firstly (before 1221) MARGUERITE de Bourgogne, daughter of HUGUES III Duke of Burgundy [Capet] & his second wife Béatrix Dauphine de Viennois ([1192]-[1228/30] or [1242]). The testament of \"Guigo Dalphinus, Vienn. et Albonis comitis\", dated 27 Jun 1267, confirmed donations made by \" matertera Margarita vel Domina Ducissa avia mea meæ amitæ quondam comitissæ Sabaudiæ\" . It is not clear from this document whether \"matertera Margarita\" and \"meæ amitæ quondam comitissæ Sabaudiæ\" refer to the same person as they are named in the context of two separate donations in different parts of the testament. The use of \"matertera\" and \"amitæ\" as two different terms to express the relationship \"aunt\" suggests that they may have been different individuals. Valbonnais assumes that they were the same person, \"Marguerite sur du dauphin André\" who married \"Amé fils de Thomas Comte de Savoie\", and adds that \"la duchesse Beatrix\" named \"son héritier le Dauphin André son fils Matilde sa fille aînée femme de Jean Comte de Chalon Marguerite son autre fille épouse d´Amedée fils du comte de Savoye\" in her testament dated 1228 . If the suggested second marriage of Comte Amedée is correctly shown below, Marguerite de Bourgogne must have died in [1228/30]. If it is incorrect, her date of death is estimated to [1242]. [m secondly ([1228/30]) MARGUERITE de Viennois, daughter of ANDRE de Bourgogne [Capet] Comte d´Albon, Dauphin & his first wife Beatrix de Sabran ([1203/07]-[1242]). The Inventory of the State Archives of Turin mentions a document dated 1230 which refers to the marriage of Comte Amedée with \"Marguerite daughter of André dauphin, comte de Viennois\", but without giving the context (marriage contract, appointment of proxy etc.). Although her mother is not named, the date of the document suggests that it is likely that Marguerite would have been born from her supposed father's first marriage. However, there is some doubt whether this reference can be correct. As noted above, two primary sources indicate that Comte Amedée IV married Marguerite de Bourgogne as his first wife, one source indicating that she was still alive in 1228. Marguerite de Viennois would therefore have been the niece of Comte Amedée´s first wife. Such a relationship by marriage would have necessitated a papal dispensation, which may not have been easily obtained given the closeness of the affinity. In addition, this supposed second marriage would have taken place during the papacy of Pope Gregory IX, who is recorded as granting only 11 dispensations during his 14 year reign (6 of which related to validating existing marriages), which suggests that he was \"averse to dispensing from the impediments of relationship\" . Another possibility is that the Inventory of State Archives mistook \"daughter\" for \"sister\" in its extract, and that the 1230 document refers to Comte Amedée´s earlier marriage to Marguerite de Bourgogne. Since writing the above comment, an updated version of the online State Archives Inventory now suggests that this possibility may be correct: while the new summary still refers to Matrimoni. Amedeo IV di Savoia e Margherita figlia di Andrea Delfino conte di Vienna, a further extract states that the document records that Margherita di Vienne gave receipt al fratello Andrea Delfino di Vienne for the sum bequeathed to her in testamento dalla madre Beatrice contessa di Vienne . The original document has not been consulted to verify how this conflict is resolved. Altogether, this possible second marriage, based only on this index entry, now looks unlikely to be correct.] m [secondly/thirdly] (contract 22 Nov 1244, by proxy Orange 18 Dec 1244) CECILE des Baux, daughter of BARRAL Seigneur des Baux & his wife Béatrice d'Anduze (-21 May 1275). The contract of marriage between \"Amedeum comitem Sabaudiæ\" and \"Cæciliam Barralis domini Baucii filiam\" is dated 18 Dec 1243, witnessed by \"Humbertum de Seyssel dominum Aquarum Raymundo de Baucio principe Aurasiæ, Guillelmo de Baucio nepote illius \" . A charter dated 22 Nov 1244 records the agreement for the marriage of dominum Amedeum comitem Sabaudie and dominam Ceciliam, neptem domini R. comitis Tolosani, filiam domini Barralli del Bauz . A charter dated 18 Dec 1244 confirms the celebration by proxy of the marriage between \"Amedée IV Comte de Savoie, marquis d'Italie\" (represented by \"Humbert de Seyssel\") and \"Cécile fille de Barral de Baux\" at the \"chapelle Sainte-Marie d'Orange\", in the presence of \"Raymond de Baux I, son neveu Raymond II prince et co-prince d'Orange, Guillaume de Sabran, et B. de Baux chanoine d'Avignon\" . Raymond VII Comte de Toulouse, Marquis de Provence granted all his property beyond the Rhône to \"sa niece Cécile de Baux, fille de Barral\" by charter dated 24 Feb 1241 , which may explain why Cécile was such a good marriage prospect for the comte de Savoie. A fourth testament of \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" is dated 19 Sep 1252, appoints \"Bonifacium filium meum\" as his heir, under the tutelage of his brother Thomas, substituting \"fratri meo Thome de Sabaudia comitis Beatricem filiam meam uxorem quondam Manfredi marchionis Salutiarum et Margaretam filiam meam uxorem Bonifacii marchionis Montisferrati\", and names \"Cecilie uxori nostre Beatrix filia mea minor\" . Her husband granted her the castles of Momigliano, La Rocchetta, e Terra della Tarantasia for life by charter dated 24 May 1253 . A fifth testament of Comte Amedée IV is dated 24 May 1253, appoints \"Bonifacius filius suus, sub tutela Thomæ comitis\" as his heir, substitutes \"filiæ Amedei comitis marchionissæ Beatrix Salutiarum et Margaretha Montisferrati\", bequeathes \"castrum Montis Meliani\" to \"Cæciliæ comitissæ\", and chooses to be buried at Hautecombe . \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" granted \"castrum Montis Meliani\" to \"Cæciliæ comitissæ conjugi suæ\" for life, on condition that she allows \"Bonifacium filium ex matrimonio eorum procreatum\" to live with her . The testament of \"Beatricis relictæ Raimundi Berengarii comitis Provinciæ\", dated 14 Jan 1264, adds bequests to \" Cæciliæ relictæ Amedei Sabaudiæ comitis \" . \"Cæciliæ comitissæ relictæ Amedei quondam comitis Sabaudiæ\" donated property by charter dated 19 Jan 1268 . \"Cecilia Vedova del Conte Amedeo di Savoia\" granted property which she inherited after the death of \"Bonifacio suo figlio\" to \"Filippo Conte di Savoia e di Borgonia\" by charter dated Oct 1268 . Comte Amedée IV & his first wife had two children:\n\na) BEATRIX de Savoie (before 4 Mar 1223-10 May before 1259) . The marriage contract between \"Alaxiam comitissam Saluciarum et Manfredum marchionem Saluciarum eius nepotem\" and \"Thomam comitem Maurianæ neptem suam Beatrix\" is dated 4 Mar 1223 . A contract dated 2 Oct 1227 between \"Marchese Enrico di Savona\" and \"il Marchese Manfredo di Saluzzo\" refers to the dowry of \"Marchese di Savona sua Consorte, figlia di Amedeo figlio del Conte di Savoia\" . Beatrix must have born in the early 1220s as she had three children by her first husband who died in 1244. The Istoria of Saba Malaspina records that \"Manfredus\" married \"natam Amadei comitis Sabaudiæ Beatricem\" . The Historia Sicula of Bartolomeo di Neocastro records that \"Manfredus\" married \"dominam Beatricem filiam ducis Sex Viarum, qui prius in virum marchionem de Salluciis\" . Her second marriage was arranged in recognition of the alliance between her father and Emperor Friedrich II. A charter dated 8 May 1246 records the restitution of \"castri Ripolarum\" by Emperor Friedrich II to \"fratribus de Sabaudia, Amedeo comite et Thoma\", confirmed by the betrothal of \"Manfredum dictum Lancea, filium naturalem imperatoris\" and \"Beatricem filiam Amedei comitis, relictam Manfredi marchionis Salucensis\" . The proxy of marriage between \"Manfredo Lanza di Lui [Imperator Federico secundo] figlio\" and \"la Contessa di Saluzzo figlia del Conte Amedeo di Savoia\" is dated Mar 1247 . The contract of marriage between \"Manfredi Lanceæ filii Friderici Rom. Imperatoris\" and \"Beatrice marchionissa Salutiensi, filia Amedei comitis Sabaudiæ et in Italia marchionis, relicta Manfredi marchionis Salutiarum\" is dated 21 Apr 1247 . A fourth testament of \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" is dated 19 Sep 1252, appoints \"Bonifacium filium meum\" as his heir, under the tutelage of his brother Thomas, substituting \"fratri meo Thome de Sabaudia comitis Beatricem filiam meam uxorem quondam Manfredi marchionis Salutiarum et Margaretam filiam meam uxorem Bonifacii marchionis Montisferrati\", and names \"Cecilie uxori nostre Beatrix filia mea minor\" . A fifth testament of Comte Amedée IV is dated 24 May 1253, appoints \"Bonifacius filius suus, sub tutela Thomæ comitis\" as his heir, substitutes \"filiæ Amedei comitis marchionissæ Beatrix Salutiarum et Margaretha Montisferrati\", bequeathes \"castrum Montis Meliani\" to \"Cæciliæ comitissæ\", and chooses to be buried at Hautecombe . The absence of any reference to Beatrix´s current husband King Manfred suggests a breakdown in their marriage. m firstly (betrothed 4 Mar 1223 and 2 Oct 1227, Mar 1233) MANFREDO III Marchese di Saluzzo, son of BONIFAZIO di Saluzzo & his wife Maria di Torres [in Sardinia] (-29 Oct 1244). m secondly (Betrothed 8 May 1246, by proxy Mar 1247, contract 21 Apr 1247, [Dec 1248/Jan 1249]) as his first wife, MANFRED von Hohenstaufen, illegitimate son of Emperor FRIEDRICH II King of Sicily & his mistress Bianca Lancia (Venosa 1232-killed in battle Benevento 26 Feb 1266). At the time of his marriage, his father constituted him Lord of territory from Pavia to Genoa. He succeeded as Principe di Tarento in 1250 on the death of his father. Regent of Sicily in 1254, he was crowned MANFREDO King of Sicily at Palermo 10 Aug 1258.\n\nb) MARGUERITE de Savoie ([1224/28]-after 14 Jan 1264) . \"Thomas comes Maurianæ\" donated property to \"Bonifacio Marchioni Montisferrati\" by way of dowry of \"Margarethæ futuræ uxoris Bonifacii et filiæ Amedei Sabaudia primogeniti Thomæ comitis\" by charter dated 18 Jan 1228 . It is unlikely that Marguerite was born much later than 1228 as her mother was at that date already at least 36 years old, and Marguerite herself had at least three children before she died in 1254. The date of her marriage is confirmed by a charter dated 18 Nov 1235, which confirmed a pact between her father and the bishop of Torino, approved by \"domina Margarita eius filia uxor dom. Bonifacii marchionis Montisferrati\" . \"Bonifacius marchio Montisferrati\" donated property to \"uxori suæ Margarethæ, Amadei comitis Sab. filiæ\" by charter dated 9 Dec 1235 . A fourth testament of \"Amedeus comes Sabaudie\" is dated 19 Sep 1252, appoints \"Bonifacium filium meum\" as his heir, under the tutelage of his brother Thomas, substituting \"fratri meo Thome de Sabaudia comitis Beatricem filiam meam uxorem quondam Manfredi marchionis Salutiarum et Margaretam filiam meam uxorem Bonifacii marchionis Montisferrati\", and names \"Cecilie uxori nostre Beatrix filia mea minor\" . A fifth testament of Comte Amedée IV is dated 24 May 1253, appoints \"Bonifacius filius suus, sub tutela Thomæ comitis\" as his heir, substitutes \"filiæ Amedei comitis marchionissæ Beatrix Salutiarum et Margaretha Montisferrati\", bequeathes \"castrum Montis Meliani\" to \"Cæciliæ comitissæ\", and chooses to be buried at Hautecombe . The testament of \"Bonefacius Montisferrati marchio\", dated 12 Jun 1253, bequeathes property to \"Alaxinam filiam meam inpuberem\", appoints \"Guilelminum filium meum inpuberem\" as his heir, substituting in turn \"Alaxinam filia mea\" and \"Tomam de Saluciis\", if his son died childless, and appoints \"dominam Margaritam comitissam uxorem mea matrem ipsius Guilelmini et dominum comitem de Sabaldia et dominum Tomam de Sabaldia fratrem suum et Dalfinum de Vianesio et dominum Jacobum de Careto et dominum Georgium et dominum Manuellem de Ceva et Bastardinum de Monteferrato\" as guardians of his son . Her second marriage is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln , although this is inconsistent with her dying in 1254 as shown in another table . The primary source which confirms her second marriage has not yet been identified. The marriage is not given by Jules Chevalier . It is possible that the dispensation was issued but that the marriage never actually took place. The testament of \"Beatricis relictæ Raimundi Berengarii comitis Provinciæ\", dated 14 Jan 1264, adds bequests to \" Margarithæ matri marchionis Montisferrati nepti suæ \" . m [firstly] (Betrothed 18 Jan 1228, before 18 Nov 1235) BONIFACIO II Marchese di Monferrato, son of GUGLIELMO VI Marchese di Monferrato & his second wife Berta di Clavesana (-[12 Jun 1253/10 Dec 1255]).
