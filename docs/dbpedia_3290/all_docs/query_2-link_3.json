        "text": "Dom Jean Birel for Pope?\n\nThere is an interesting story, which can be traced to the Cistercian author, Dom Petrus Dorlandus (Pieter Dorland, died 1507) who reports in his chronicle (Martène, 187-188) that the twenty-second General of the Cistercians, Jean Birel (Ioannes Birellius) had been considered for the papal office at the Conclave of 1352:\n\nOb quam causam cum felicis recordationis Clemens papa sextus viam fuisset universae carnis ingressus, major pars cardinalium ipsum [Ioannem Birellium] in summum pontificem eligere disponebat: quod videns domnus cardinalis Petragoricensis, qui tunc temporis inter cardinales quasi vexillifer habebatur, scilicet praefati prioris electionem ad apicem pontificalem perduci velle: cum sentiret ipsum priorem summae esse justitiae et aequitatis, neque ullum hominem mundi contra justitiam reveri: surgens in medio collegii ait: Domini mei reverendi cardinales, vos quod facitis ignoratis. Sciatis pro certo priorem Carthusiae tantae fore justitiae, rigoris, et aequitatis, quod si ipsum in papam eligimus, pro certo ad statum nos reducet antiquum; atque equi nostri infra quattuor menses quadrigas conducent: non enim cujusquam veretur personam, quia ecclesiam Dei zelans, quasi leo confidit. Quo audito, domini cardinales perterriti, sibique ipsis nimis carnaliter metuentes, praefato priore praetermisso, dominum Innocemtium sextum de collegio suo elegerunt....\n\nWhen Clement VI had died, the majority of cardinals was disposed to elect Jean Birel as pope. But seeing that Cardinal Talleyrand de Perigord was then the leader among the cardinals, and that he wished to prevent Birel being elected, for he saw that he was a Prior of outstanding justice and equity, he got up in the midst of the college of cardinals and said, \"My lords, reverend cardinals, you don't know what you are doing. You are aware for certain that the Prior of Chartaux will be a man of such justice, rigor and equity, that if we elect him as pope, he will certainly bring us back to our ancient state; and inside of four months, our horses will be pulling quadrigae: for he is not afraid of the status of any one, because he is like a lion in his zeal for the Church of God.\" When the cardinals heard this, they were thoroughly frightened, and fearing too much for their material comforts, they passed over the Prior, and elected Pope Innocent VI from their own College....\n\nAnd, later in the story, after the news of the death of Jean Birel is brought to Avignon (Martène, 192-193):\n\nDum vero Avenioni rumor de transitu prioris Cartusiae percrebuisset, domnus Innocentius papa adhuc superstes, haec audiens, in vocem lacrymanum, ut fertur, prorupit dicens: Valentior religiosus et clericus mundi mortuus est. Cum vero post modicum tempus supradictus papa in extremis laborasset, et finem suum adesse cerneret, coram infinitis astantantibus intonuit dicens: Utinam anima mea esset coram Deo talis qualem aestimo fore animam Johannis quondam prioris Carthusiae. Praescriptus etiam dominus cardinalis Petragoricensis, qui ejusdem prioris electionem in papatu impediverat, audita ejus morte, in haec verba prorupit: Vae nobis, quia tristes nos. Tristis est ecclesia Dei, quia collegium nostrum et ecclesia sancta Dei talem non promeruit habere pastorem. Non enim digni sumus tanto pastore.\n\nThere is also an influential sixteenth-century French translation (Driscart, pp. 116-117):\n\nVoicy maintenant que nous avons a parler du R(everend). et saincte Pere Iean Birellios, lequel tant pour sa douceur que pour sa sainctete s' estoit rendu agreable a Dieu et aux hommes, sa renommee et auctorite estant si grande, qu' apres la mort de Clement sixieme la plus grande partie des Cardinaux estoit portee pour l'elire au Pontificat; ce qu' il eut refussi; ne fut este le Cardinal Pertragoricus, qui sçachant le zele et la justice de ce sainct personnage, harasigua ses Confreres les Cardinaux en ces termes: le ne sçay que trop mes Seigneurs que desirez pour notre souverain Pontife la personne du General des Chartreux et certes il faut que se conforse qu' il est tres digne et capable de cet honneur: mais parte que nous autres Joannes ambitieux desir faste, gloire et vanite e de ce monde; et a en horreur touts les attiratis, sottises, et vanitez; d' ecelay, s' il est eleu, sans faute (puis qu' il est porte pour l' equite et la justice) il nous voudra remettre a nostre premier estat, se moquant de nos montures si bien harnacees, et se riant de nos chevaux di superbement accommpdez, dieu nos housses pour lors et nos esperons donees, apres peu de jours il les renuoyera aux champs, et les employera a tirer la charue, car il ne se soucie de personne tant soit-elle puissante ou noble: mais pour l'Eglise il se comporte en guise de Lion fort et courageux. Cecy donna tant de crainte et d'emotion aux Cardinaux que ne luy osant fier leur voix, ils la donnerent a celui qui fut nomme Innocent sixieme...\n\nand, ten years later in the life of Birel by Peter Dorlandus, following the death of Dom Jean Birel in fact (Driscart, 121):\n\nLe Pape Innocent ayant entendu les nouvelles de sa mort dit en pleurant, helas le plus Sainct Religieux et le plus scavant du monde est mort ce joour-d'huy. Le mesme Sainct Pere estant aux abois de la mort disoit en la presence des assistans: A la mienne volente que mon ame parut si innocent devant Dieu que l' ame de ce bon Pere Ian, laquelle je crois avoir une conjour tres-agreable a nostre Seigneur.\n\nLe Cardinal Petragoricensis fut si esterangement émeu de cette mort, que se repentant d' avoir esté cause qu'il n'avoit esté eleir Pape, dit ces mots avec grand regret, Mal-heur a nous Cardinaux, mal-heur à toute l'Eglise qui n'avons voulu avoir vu tel Pasteur, je l' ai defendu et voy la pourquoy mal-heur à moy parce que j' ay fait tort a nous tous, et grandement avit à la Saincte Eglise. Apres sa mort ce bon Pere n' a manqué de miracles, car Lemonicenses, d'ou il estoit natif, ayants recors a son affirtance trouvoient leurs malades aydez et soulangez, raison pourquoy ils envoyerent à la Chartreuse pour avoir quelques Reliques...\n\nNow it is true that the Talleyrand family were noted supporters of the Carthusians. Cardinal Élie's brother, Count Archambaud III, in fact had founded the Chartreuse of Vauclere, and had left it 12,000 gold florins in his Will. But this story of Dom Jean Birel is not in the nature of a \"chronicle\". Birel had been an advisor of Benedict XI, and his austere, monkish, reformist Cistercian views were well known to all the members of the Sacred College. Birel was, as many leaders of religious orders in the history of the Church, a candidate for sainthood, being promoted by all the prayers and works of the members of his Order. All of the lives of the Carthusian leaders in Dorlandus' work are accompanied by reports of miracles and observations about their morals and moral influence. The anecdote about the Conclave of 1352 originates as part of a work, written in the late fifteenth century, which is at least partially hagiographic in nature, despite its title of chronicle. The anecdote appears nowhere else in extant literature but in the work of the Cistercian Dom Petrus Dorlandus (except by endless repetition). (see Zacour, passim) (Souchon, 54-56).\n\nPiatti has his doubts as to the authenticity of Dorlandus' story (Storia, 106): \"Se non che questi scrisse la propria Cronaca circa l' anno 1500, e per conseguente può non essere del tutto giuridica ed accertata la di lui asserzione, se non anco appassionata.\" Pélissier (Innocent VI, p. 43), though he accepts the tale of Jean Birel, remarks, \"le candidature de Jean Birel ne fut pas posée.\" And his careful language is quite correct. Birel was not put forward as a candidate in the Conclave of 1352. The real interest of the Cardinals was not in the election of a saintly man, or of a man bent on reform. Quite the contrary, their work on a lengthy set of Electoral Capitulations indicates that the issue was power, and how it should be apportioned. Their interest was in limiting the Pope's power over them, rather than in allowing a Pope to reform them without their consent.\n\nConclave\n\nPope Clement VI had considerably altered the regulations promulgated by Pope Gregory X at the Second Council of Lyons (\"Prima Vita Clementis VI\", in Baluzius I, 260-261):\n\nPraefatus insuper Papa laxavit seu verius mutavit constitutionem Gregorii Papae X Ubi majus, de elect. lib VI editam super illis quae Cardinales habent observare quando sunt inclusi in conclavi pro electione Romani Pontificis celebranda. Voluit enim, constituit, et ordinavit quod dicti Cardinales possint a cetero in dicto conclavi existentes habere cortinas, cum quibus claudantur eorum logiae quando dormient seu quiescent. Item quod habeant duos servitores clericos vel laicos, prout eis magis placebit. Item quod elapsis tribus diebus post suum introitum haberent ultra panem et vinum fructus, caseum et electuaria, et unum ferculum carnium vel piscium duntaxat in prandio, et aliud in coena. Super quibus edidit constitutionem perpetuo duraturam, quae incipit Licet; cujus contrarium, quad praedicta, continebat caput praedictum Ubi majus, quod quoad alia omnia voluit in sua remanere firmitate.\n\nThere were to be curtains to give Cardinals privacy during sleep or rest. They could have two conclavisti, clerical or lay, as they pleased. After three days, in addition to bread and wine, they were allowed to have fruit, cheese and citrus (?), and one plate of meat or fish, both at lunch and at dinner.\n\nThe text of the Bull Licet in constitutione is given in Cherubini, Magnum Bullarium Romanum, p. 179 (dated 8 Idus Decemb, December 6, Pont nostri ann. X), and by Rinaldi [Baronius-Theiner 25, sub anno 1351, no. 39, p. 524].\n\nTwenty-eight cells were built in the Conclave [Deprez, 240 and n. 2], leading some to conclude—erroneously—that there were twenty-eight living cardinals. Thirty-three doorways were walled shut, and sixteen windows.\n\nElectoral Capitulations\n\nThere were Electoral Capitulations (André, 351-354; Souchon, 55-66). They are quoted by the successful candidate, Pope Innocent VI, in a letter written in 1352 at the beginning of his reign (Baronius-Theiner, sub anno 1352, nos. 25 and 26, p. 540):\n\nIn deliberations for the public good, the Cardinals must agree unanimously.\n\nAt no time and no matter what the excuse, may the Pope create cardinals without following specific rules (which are then listed):\n\nThe Pope may not create new cardinals until the number of living cardinals has fallen below sixteen.\n\nWhen the number has fallen below sixteen, and new cardinals are created, the total number may not exceed twenty.\n\nIn creating new cardinals, the Pope must have the consent of at least two-thirds of the existing cardinals.\n\nExcept that, in the case of their being the number of cardinals now existing or fewer, the Pope, if he wishes, may appoint two cardinals, with the consent of all the Cardinals or the major part of them (i.e., at the present moment, the Pope may appoint two new cardinals with only a majority of Cardinals agreeing)\n\nThe Pope may not proceed to the deposition or the deprivation of any cardinal without consultation and the agreement of all the cardinals with no objections, nor may he inflict any excommunication or other ecclesiastical censure, leading to the loss of a cardinal's vote or share in income, nor deprivation or suspension of benifices of a cardinal without the agreement of all the cardinals, or at least two-thirds of them.\n\nThe Pope may not in any way put his hands on the property of any cardinals, whether they are living or deceassed.\n\nThe Pope may not alienate provinces, cities, castles or other lands of the Roman Church, nor may he grant them under feudal terms or emphitheosis, or under a certain payment. And when such alienation or concession might take place for a just and reasonable cause, the Pope must have the consent of all the Cardinals, or at least two-thirds of them.\n\nThe College of Cardinals ought to have its fair share of all fruits, returns, proventus, fines, condemnations and rents, and of all other income and emoluments, in whatever provinces and lands and places of the Roman Church—just as in the Privilege of the late Pope Nicholas IV.\n\nIn the Roman Curia and in the provinces of the Roman Church, major officials in termporal affairs should be appointed and dismissed with the advice and consent of the Cardinals—just as is recognized in the Privilege (or Constitution) of the aforesaid Pope Nicholas IV.\n\nNo person may be appointed to the offices of Marshal of the Roman Curia or Rector of one of the lands or provinces of the Roman Church who is related to the current pope by consanguinity or affinity.\n\nThe Pope may not grant to any king or prince or anyone else in provincial governments or their lands the decimae (10% of church income), nor third-decimae nor any other subsidy, nor shall the Pope even reserve it for his treasury (Camera) without the advice and consent of all the Cardinals or at least two-thirds of them, and then for just and reasonable cause.\n\nThe Pope shall not impede the Cardinals from having freedom of action as a group or as individuals in taking counsel and in giving their consent.\n\nAll the Cardinals who now exist should swear an oath that he who is elected by the same Cardinals will observe these provisions diligently and inviolabily; and nonetheless he who is elected, whether a cardinal or some other, shall agree on the day of his election to observe faithfully all these provisions generally and individually, and shall do so by oath.\n\nThese Capitulations were annulled by Innocent VI on July 6, 1353 in the Bull Solicitudo pastoris (Souchon, 63).\n\nThe Conclave of 1352 did not, as events transpired, need to invoke many of the new Conclave regulations promulgated by Clement VI. The Conclave opened on Sunday, December 16 (Deprez, 240), and came to a successful conclusion on Tuesday, December 18 (\"Secunda Vita Innocentii VI\", Baluzius I, column 345 and 846):\n\nMortuo Domino Clemente in die Sancti Nicolai, Cardinales intrarunt conclave Dominica post Luciae, et die Martis proxima hunc [Stephanum Alberti] elegerunt.\n\nThe Conclave was held in the Apostolic Palace in Avignon, where Clement VI had died. This is referred to by the new Pope, Innocent VI, in his Election Manifesto, Praedicator egregius (Baronius-Theiner, sub anno 1352, no. 28; p. 541):\n\nNuper siquidem felicis recordationis Clemente papa VI, praedecessore nostro, tela vitae succisa, in Domino quiescente, et ipsius funeralibus exsequiis cum honorificentia debita celebratis, nobisque una cum fratribus nostris S. R. E. cardinalibus, de quorum numero tunc eramus, tempore debito convenientibus invicem in palatio Apostolico Avinionensi, in quo idem praedecessor tempore sui obitus habitabit, pro futuri electione pastoris...\n\nThe election was a quick one. The Cardinals had heard that the King of France, John II \"The Good\", was on his way to Avignon with the intention of getting the Cardinals to elect the person most suitable to his own interests (Matteo Villani, Book III, chapter 45; Baronius-Theiner, sub anno 1352, no. 27; p. 541).\n\nDopo la morte di papa Clemente sesto, i cardinali rinchiusi in conclave sentendo che il re di Francia s'affrettava di venire a Avignone per avere papa a sua volontà. la qual cosa non gli potea mancare, tanti cardinali aveva a sua stanza e di suo reame, ma non ostante che tutto il collegio de'cardinali fosse stato al servigio del detto re, tuttavia per la riverenza della libertà di santa Chiesa, vollono innanzi avere fatto papa di loro movimento, che a stanza del re di Francia. E però di presente presono accordo tra loro, ed elessono a papa il cardinale d'Ostia nativo di Limogi, il quale era stato vescovo di Chairamonte, uomo di buona vita, e di non grande scienza, e assai amico del re di Francia; la sua fama infra gli altri era di semplice e buona vita, e antico d' età....\n\nThe \"Third Life\" adds that the election took place at the hour of Tierce—mid-morning (\"Secunda Vita Innocentii VI\", Baluzius I, column 357):\n\nelectus est in Papam per Cardinales anno Domini MCCCLII die Martis XVIII Decembris, hora tertiarum\n\nCoronation of Innocent VI\n\nInnocent VI (Étienne Aubert) was crowned in the Apostolic Palace at Avignon on Sunday, December 30 (\"Secunda Vita Innocentii VI\", Baluzius I, column 345; \"Tertia Vita\", column 357):\n\nQui coronatus fuit in palatio Apostolico Avinionensi dominica die infra octabas nativitatis Domini.\n\net coronatus Dominica penultima dicti mensis Avinione in apostolico palatio."
