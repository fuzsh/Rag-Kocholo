        "text": "The practices of astrology and astronomy, seen then as indistinguishable, were undeniably influential in the Renaissance revival of classical antiquity in Italy, especially to the aristocratic ruling class, who often used astrological birth charts to determine dates and times for important events in their lives. In addition to their own personal information, Italian aristocrats also consulted the writers of astronomers and philosophers in their daily affairs, including the designs of the art and architecture in their palaces. However, the karmic energy of the stars was a double-edged sword; in the same way it could be used to bring good luck and prosperity to those wielding it, it could also cause harm to their rivals or nemeses. Focusing specifically on the Sienese banker Agostino Chigi and the Medici family, this paper seeks to explore the ways these patrons combined important biographical dates and times with the writings of Florentine scholar Marsilio Ficino in order to depict the heavens in the vaults of religious and secular spaces, as well as the possible intents and purposes raised by pre-existing scholarship in their choice of these intentionally complex themes and designs.\n\nThe Sala dello Zodiaco in Villa Giulia, the wonderful \"suburbanum\" built by Julius III on the slopes of Monte Parioli in the north of Rome, is a mannerist jewel only recently restored and opened to the public. Its frescoed vault, attributed to the workshop of Prospero Fontana, represents classical gods alternated to chariots with seasonal symbols and an anomalous zodiacal spiral, reflecting the helicoidal staircase devised by Vignola for the main casino. We will discuss the astrological elements of the decoration, showing that Claudia Cieri Via (1996) was right in proposing a connection to the horoscope of the Pope. The fresco is not the complete geniture of Julius III, which was calculated and rectified by Luca Gaurico and Francesco Giuntini, but a careful selection of propitious planetary aspects in his nativity chart. Other evidences of astrological propaganda and astronomical interests on the part of the Pontiff and his courtiers are here examined, confirming the reading of the vault and revealing once more the extent of the involvement of Renaissance Papacy in the Science of the Stars."
