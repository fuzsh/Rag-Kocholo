The soldiers liked to say of him: ‘Caffa doesn't give a damn what happens; he’s always sure to have one foot in France.’ He was also a philosopher, who was elected to the Institute of Egypt on February 13, 1796 in the class of moral and political sciences. He was part of the commission in charge of drafting the regulations of the Institute of Egypt and accompanied Napoleon on the surveys to trace the route of what would one day be the Suez Canal. Stricken with gangrene he died of a fever. Napoleon wrote in the order of the day: ‘Our universal regrets accompany General Caffarelli to the grave; the army is losing one of its bravest leaders.

His Greek history (covering the years 387-356) and three books on the Third Sacred War are lost. During the campaign, Callisthenes’ main duty was to write the Alexandrou praxeis or Deeds of Alexander. In Babylon, Callisthenes supervised the translation of the Astronomical diaries, which were used by Callipus of Cyzicus to reform the Greek calendars. In the summer of 327, Callisthenes voiced protests against the introduction of proskynesis (an aspect of the Persian court ritual) among the Macedonians, and lost Alexander's favour. He died in prison from torture or disease.\n\nBkXIX:Chap14:Sec3 Mentioned.\n\nCallot, Jacques\n\nc1592-1635. A French etcher and engraver, in the service of Cosimo II de' Medici, he created many works: the Capricci, small, vivacious figure groups; gay scenes of Medici court life; the vast Fair at Impruneta (1620); and sparkling illustrations of the theatre among them his Commedia dell'arte group, which was reproduced in his Balli (1621). On Cosimo’s death in 1621, Callot returned to Nancy and, under the patronage of the ducal court, gained a considerable reputation. He became known for his fantasies, grotesques, beggars, and caricatures, then much in vogue. He was commissioned in 1627 by the Infanta Isabella of Brussels to engrave the siege of Breda, and by Louis XIII to etch the sieges of Rochelle and the island of Ré and a series, Views of Paris. Too independent for court favour and deeply affected by the scenes of carnage he had witnessed, he retired to Nancy, where he executed in 1633 his masterwork, the two series entitled Miseries of War. These studies of human brutality and suffering were the first dispassionate, un-romanticized treatment of the horror of war. Callot produced nearly 1,500 plates and 2,000 drawings in a wide variety of styles and subjects. The grandeur and brilliance of his work profoundly influenced many major masters, including Goya, Rembrandt and Watteau. His technical innovations established important procedures for subsequent etchers.\n\nBkXI:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCalonne, Charles-Alexandre de\n\n1734-1802 A French statesman, he was Controller-General of Finances (1783-87). Faced with a huge public debt and a steadily deteriorating financial situation, he adopted a spending policy to inspire confidence in the nation's financial position. He then proposed a direct land tax and the calling of provincial assemblies to apportion it, a stamp tax, and the reduction of some privileges of the nobles and clergy. To gain support, he persuaded King Louis XVI to call an Assembly of Notables, but the Assembly (1787) refused to consider Calonne’s proposals and criticized him bitterly. Dismissed and replaced by Étienne Charles Loménie de Brienne, Calonne fled (1787) to England, where he stayed until 1802. In 1766 he was Procureur-Général of the commission instituted to try La Chalotais.\n\nBkV:Chap1:Sec2 BkV:Chap10:Sec1 BkXLII:Chap10:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkIX:Chap1:Sec1 Declared a traitor in December 1791.\n\nCalvin, John\n\n1509-1564.

After preaching in Strasbourg he was invited back to Geneva in 1541 living there as its virtual dictator until his death. He sought to re-shape Geneva as a model community where every citizen came under the sway of the Church.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap6:Sec1 BkXXXV:Chap11:Sec1 BkXXXVI:Chap6:Sec1\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap11:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCalypso\n\nA demi-goddess, living on the island of Ogygia in Homer’s Odyssey (Bks I, V etc), she detains Ulysses on her island.\n\nBkXXII:Chap 26:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCamaldoli, Italy\n\nIn the Casentino region near Florence, Camaldoli is inhabited by Carthusians, and surrounded by pine forests, from the heights above which, on a clear day, may be seen the Mediterranean and Adriatic.\n\nBkXX:Chap9:Sec2 Mentioned.\n\nCamargo, Marie Anne de Cupis de\n\n1710-1770 Born in Brussels.

Re-founded by Julius Caesar in 45BC, it became a commercial, cultural and administrative capital of Roman Africa, the capital of the Vandal Kingdom (439-533 AD) and a Byzantine outpost until destroyed by the Muslims in 697AD.\n\nBkIII:Chap9:Sec1 BkXIX:Chap14:Sec1 BkXXIV:Chap17:Sec1\n\nBkXXVII:Chap11:Sec1 BkXXXI:Chap1:Sec2 BkXXXI:Chap6:Sec1\n\nMentioned.\n\nBkVIII:Chap5:Sec2 Carthage, Texas.\n\nBkXIV:Chap2:Sec3 BkXXIX:Chap13:Sec4 Dido of Carthage appears in Virgil’s Aeneid.\n\nBkXIV:Chap6:Sec1 The fortification at Saint-Michel de Maurienne was attributed to Hannibal’s crossing of the Alps in 218BC.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap2:Sec1 BkXX:Chap7:Sec2 BkXXV:Chap2:Sec1\n\nBkXXXVI:Chap8:Sec1 Chateaubriand was there in 1807. The ancient city stood on the Hill of Byrsa. The Romans levelled the hill burying a few remnants of the city which have been excavated: in Chateaubriand’s time there was little to see of the original city.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap3Sec3 BkXVIII:Chap8:Sec1 Chateaubriand on the harbours of Carthage. The ancient artificial harbour, the Cothon, is represented today by two lagoons north of the bay of al-Karm (el-Kram). In the 3rd century BC it had two parts, the outer rectangular part being for merchant shipping, the interior, circular division being reserved for warships; sheds and quays were available for 220 warships. The harbour’s small size probably means that it was used chiefly in winter when navigation almost ceased. Megara was the southern suburb of the city, south of Byrsa and the citadel, near the Bay of Tunis.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap4Sec1 Punic means Carthaginian. The Latin adjective Punicus is derived from the Greek Phoinix, meaning Phoenician.\n\nBkXXII:Chap 26:Sec1 It’s traditional foundation by Dido in 814BC.\n\nCarthusians\n\nA minor order of monks of the Roman Catholic Church, it was established by St. Bruno at La Grande Chartreuse near Grenoble in France in 1084. The Carthusians are peculiar among orders of Western monasticism in cultivating a nearly eremitical life: each monk lives by himself with cell and garden and, except for communal worship, scarcely meets the others. No order is more austere. The Carthusian enclosure is called a charterhouse in English, and its architecture differs necessarily from that of the Benedictine abbey. The Charterhouse of London was famous, and the Certosa di Pavia, Italy, is an architectural monument.\n\nBkIX:Chap8:Sec2 Mentioned.\n\nBkXIII:Chap4:Sec1 The Chartreuse de Paris, demolished during the Revolution.\n\nBkXVII:Chap5:Sec1 La Grande-Chartreuse, the mother-house of the Order lies in a high valley of the Alps of Dauphine, at an altitude of 4268 feet, fourteen miles north of Grenoble. Medieval writers were awestruck by the desolation of the spot, and Martene, who visited it in 1760, writes: ‘One cannot conceive how it could enter into the mind of man, to establish a community in a spot so horrible and so barren as this.’\n\nCartier, Jacques\n\n1491-1557 French sailor born at Saint-Malo. Jean La Veneur recommended Cartier to François I who charged him with discovering unknown lands between Newfoundland and Labrador and to find a new passage towards India and China. He began a series of sponsored voyages to North America and took possession of Canada in the name of the King of France in 1534.\n\nBkI:Chap4:Sec5 A native of Saint-Malo.\n\nBkI:Chap4:Sec8 Mentioned.\n\nBkVI:Chap5:Sec3 Explored along the coast of Newfoundland.\n\nBkVII:Chap10:Sec1 His description of the Canadian Indians. He named the Baye des Chaleurs (the Bay of Warmth) at Carleton near Quebec in 1534.\n\nCaserta, Italy\n\nThe monumental complex at Caserta, near Naples, was created by the Bourbon king Charles III in the mid-18th century to rival Versailles and the Royal Palace in Madrid.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap8:Sec1 BkXXVI:Chap9:Sec1 An example of French influence.\n\nCassandra\n\nThe daughter of Priam and Hecuba, gifted with prophecy by Apollo, but cursed to tell the truth and not be believed. She was taken back to Greece by Agamemnon. (See Aeschylus: The Agamemnon)\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap7:Sec1 Chateaubriand compares himself to her as a prophet not understood in his own time.\n\nCassano, Italy\n\nThe battle of Cassano d’Adda in the French Revolutionary Wars was fought on April 27 1799 near Cassano d’Adda. It resulted in a victory for the Austrians and Russians (Second Coalition forces) under Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov over the French troops, left behind in Italy by Napoleon during his Egyptian campaign.\n\nBkXX:Chap1:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCassiodorus Senator, Flavius Magnus Aurelius\n\nc490-c583 Roman writer, statesman and monk. Governor of Lucanaia and Bruttium under Theodoric, he was Praetorian Prefect under Amalasuntha (Amalaswintha) and with her pursued the Romanisation of Ravenna. After her death and the Byzantine re-conquest he retired to his monastery Vivarium built on his own estate. His many writings include a History of the Goths (526-533), a work on music, his letters and religious works. He laboured to unite Roman and Gothic culture.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap2:Sec2 BkXLII:Chap2:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCassius\n\nCaius Cassius Longinus, d. 42 BC was a leader in the successful conspiracy to assassinate Julius Caesar. He fought as a quaestor under Marcus Licinius Crassus at Carrhae in 53; and saved what was left of the army after the battle. He supported Pompey against Caesar but was pardoned after the battle of Pharsalus. He was made (44) peregrine praetor and Caesar promised to make him governor of Syria. Before the promise could be fulfilled, Cassius had become ringleader in the plot to kill Caesar. The plot involved more than 60 men (including Marcus Junius Brutus, Publius Servilius Casca, and Lucius Tillius Cimber) and was successfully accomplished in the Senate on the Ides of March in 44; When the people were aroused by Antony against the conspirators, Cassius went to Syria. He managed to capture Dolabella at Laodicea and coordinated his own movements with those of Brutus. Antony and Octavian met them in battle at Philippi. In the first engagement Cassius, thinking the battle lost, committed suicide.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap20:Sec2 He and Brutus were icons of the French Revolution.\n\nCastelbajac, Vicomte de\n\n1776-1868. Deputy for Gers in 1815 and 1816, he was a powereful orator of the ultra-royalist right. He represented Haut-Garonne in the Chamber of Peers from 1827.\n\nBkXXV:Chap9:Sec1 Involved closely with the Conservateur to which he provided 41 articles.\n\nCastellane, Cordelia (née Greffulhe), Comtesse de\n\n1796-1847. Chateaubriand’s mistress for a few months in 1823, and later a close friend.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap16:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkXXX:Chap5:Sec1 Chateaubriand writes to her\n\nCastelnau, Michel de\n\nc1520-1592. A French diplomat and soldier, he early attracted the favourable notice of the cardinal of Lorraine (Charles de Guise) and performed important services for Anne, Duc de Montmorency, and King Henry II. In the religious wars he went on missions to England, Scotland, the Netherlands, and Savoy and fought in the royal army; from 1575 to 1585 he served as ambassador to England. Upon his return he fell out with the Guises and rendered valuable services against the Catholic League to King Henry III and King Henry IV. Although a Catholic, he favoured a policy of moderation toward the Huguenots. He left valuable memoirs.\n\nBkVI:Chap8:Sec1 His Memoirs lack a final book.\n\nCastiglioni, Cardinal, see Pope Pius VIII\n\nCastlereagh, see Londonderry\n\nCastor\n\nThe son of Tyndareus of Sparta and Leda, and twin brother of Pollux, noted for his horses and horsemanship.\n\nBkIII:Chap8:Sec1 His horsemanship.\n\nCastries, Claire Clemence Henriette Claudine de Maillé, Marquise later Duchesse de\n\n1796-1861 The daughter of Duchesse Henriette Victoire (née Fitz-James) and the Duc de Maillé, she did not become a Duchess until 1842, and bore the title of Marquise previous to that time. She was separated from the Duc de Castries, whom she had married in 1816, as the result of a famous love affair with Prince Victor Metternich eldest son of the Austrian Chancellor, by whom she had a son in 1827. Her lover died of tuberculosis shortly after. The Marquise gathered round her a group of intellectuals, among whom were the writers Balzac (who modelled the Duchesse de Langeais on her), Musset, and Sainte-Beuve, and continued active in literary and artistic circles until her death\n\nBkXXIX:Chap14:Sec1 In Rome in December 1828.\n\nCastro, Juan de\n\n1500-1548. He was a Portuguese naval officer and fourth Viceroy of the Portuguese Indies.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap6:Sec1 Montesquieu tells the anecdote in his Persian Letters LXXVIII. Juan borrowed money against his moustache which he cut off, and later redeemed.\n\nCastro, Inès de\n\n1325-1355. A Galician noblewoman, daughter of Pedro Fernandez de Castro, she was the lover and posthumously declared lawful wife of the Portuguese King Peter (Pedro), according to his testimony, and was therefore Queen of Portugal. She was murdered by King Alfonso V. Peter, who became King in 1357, took Inês’ body from the grave and forced the court to swear allegiance to her as queen. She was later buried at the Monastery of Alcobaça (in central Portugal) where her marble coffin can still be seen today just opposite of her king’s. Both coffins were carved out of marble and exquisitely sculpted with scenes from their lives and a promise by Peter that they would be together ‘ate a fim do mundo: till the end of the world’.\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap10:Sec1 Mentioned. The incident is questionable.\n\nCatchfly\n\nChateaubriand’s conise translates as flybane or catchfly (or possibly as O. F. conyse=fleabane which does not however appear to match the sense of a sticky plant). The Silene (Family: Caryophyllaceae) contain a number of sticky herbs and plants Chateaubriand may have been familiar with, including Silene gallica, the Common or French Silene, and Silene armeria whose hairy stems exude a sticky sap that captures small insects trying to steal nectar without pollinating the flowers. Hence, the common name, Catchfly. However Philip Ashmole advises me that: ‘the plant that was noted as gumming up the goats’ beards was almost certainly the Gumwood Commidendrum robustum, once very abundant on the island but now endangered (see St. Helena and Ascension Island: A Natural History by Philip and Myrtle Ashmole: published by Anthony Nelson, Oswestry, 2000. ISBN: 0904614611.) The other possibility is the Scrubwood Commidendrum rugosum, a smaller Gumwood relative that was then common in the lower parts of the island. But I think that in the area of Napoleon’s tomb the Gumwood is much more likely.’\n\nBkXXIV:Chap12:Sec1 In the Valley of the Tomb, on St Helena.\n\nCateau-Cambrésis, France\n\nThe Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis was signed between Elizabeth I of England and Henry II of France on April 2 and between Henry II and Philip II of Spain on April 3, 1559, at Le Cateau-Cambrésis, around twenty kilometers south-east of Cambrai. Henry II of France died during the tournament held to celebrate the peace, his eye being pierced by a sliver that penetrated the brain, from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the King’s Scottish Guard.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap20:Sec1 Chateabriand there in 1815.\n\nCathelineau, Jacques\n\n1759-1793.

The daughter of Lorenzo de’ Medici, Duke of Urbino, she married Henry II of France in 1533. She was largely responsible for the St Bartholomew’s Day massacre. Her influence waned during the reign of her third son Henry III.\n\nBkXXXI:Chap6:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap19:Sec1 Henri IV regarding her Maids of Honour.\n\nCatiline, Lucius Sergius Catalina\n\nd. 62BC. The Roman politician plotted to seize power in 62BC. Thwarted by Cicero, Catiline fled to a rebel force in Etruria while his fellow conspirators were executed. He was defeated and killed in battle.\n\nBkV:Chap12:Sec1 Mirabeau compared to him.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap12:Sec1 The revolutionaries compared to him.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap13:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCatinat, Nicolas\n\n1637-1712. A Marshal of France. The son of a magistrate, he won promotion by merit rather than by wealth or descent. In the War of the Grand Alliance he commanded against Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy, whom he defeated in N Italy at Staffarda (1690) and at Marsaglia (1693). Early in the War of the Spanish Succession, he commanded the French army in Italy, against Prince Eugene of Savoy, but after suffering reverses he was replaced. He retired in 1705 and later wrote his memoirs.\n\nBkXIX:Chap13:Sec1 Victor at Marsaglia, near Turin, against the Duke of Savoy on the 4th of October 1693.\n\nCato the Elder, Marcus Portius Cato\n\n234-149BC. A Roman statesman he wrote the first history of Rome. A moral and political conservative, as Censor in 184 he legislated against luxury and sponsored improvements in public works. He opposed Carthaginian power in the Mediterranean, and supported the Third Punic War in 149 which destroyed Carthaginian influence. He was taken as an example of moral uprightness and severity.\n\nBkI:Chap3:Sec3 Chateaubriand’s brother eulogised as a Cato by his mother.\n\nBkVI:Chap7:Sec1 A representative of early Roman severity.\n\nCato of Utica\n\nMarcus Portius Cato, the Younger, 95-46BC was a Roman politician, the great-grandson of Cato the Elder, and an opponent of Julius Caesar. He supported Pompey in the Civil War in an attempt to save the Republic. He escaped to Utica in North Africa after Pompey’s death, but committed suicide after Caesar’s victory at Thapsus. He was taken as an example of loyalty to an ideal, and he figures as a moral exemplar in Dante’s Purgatorio.\n\nBkX:Chap8:Sec2 A quotation follows from Addison’s play Cato, Act V, Scene 1, the first verse of Cato’s monologue before committing suicide.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap2:Sec1 His house at Utica.\n\nBkXX:Chap4:Sec1 BkXXXVI:Chap8:Sec1 A moral exemplar.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap7:Sec2 Addison’s play mentioned.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap13:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCatullus, Valerius\n\nc84-c54BC. The Roman poet was born in Verona. He became the leader of the new poetic movement in Rome, his poems including those to Lesbia, elegies and satires.\n\nBkXI:Chap4:Sec1 The quotation, addressed to his brother, given in Catullus LXV, lines 9-11, depends on a plausible reconstruction of the missing mid-section of lines 9 and 10.\n\nBkXX:Chap5:Sec3 He celebrated Lake Garda where his family had a villa. See Catullus XXXI.\n\nBkXL:Chap1:Sec1 He was born in Verona.\n\nCauchie, Anne\n\nA long-lived lady of Dieppe, she was still of sound mind at a hundred and fifty years old in 1645.\n\nBkIV:Chap10:Sec2 Cauchie also the name of La Martinière’s flame!

The Romans chose a route though the Apennines (near Caudium between Capua and Benevento) entered only by two defiles, between which they were trapped. Were the Samnites to set the Romans free without harm, they would gain the Roman’s friendship. Were they to kill the entire Roman army then Rome would be so weakened that it would not pose a threat for many generations. The idea of a middle way was rejected as antagonising the Romans without weakening them. According to Livy, the Romans were made to surrender and pass under the yoke. This was agreed to by the two commanding consuls, as the army was facing starvation. Livy describes in detail the humiliation of the Romans. It is an example used to illustrate the dangers of the middle way in strategic settlements, for example the humiliation of Germany after World War I without a total weakening of her powers.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap20:Sec3 Mentioned.\n\nCaulaincourt, Armand-Augustin-Louis, Marquis de, Duc de Vicenza\n\n1772-1827 Aide-de-camp to Bonaparte at the time of the execution of the Duc d’Enghien.

His most popular work was the Diable amoureux (1772), a fantastic tale in which the hero raises the devil. Around 1775 Cazotte embraced the views of the Illuminati, declaring himself possessed of the power of prophecy. It was upon this event that Jean-François de la Harpe based his famous jeu d'esprit, in which he represented Cazotte as prophesying the most minute events of the French Revolution. On the discovery of some of his letters in August 1792, Cazotte was arrested; and though he escaped for a time through the efforts of his daughter, he was executed the following month.\n\nBkX:Chap1:Sec1 His ballad La Veillée de la Bonne Femme ou le Réveil d’Enguerrand.\n\nCecilia Metella, see Metella\n\nCecrops\n\nHe was the legendary founder of Athens.\n\nBkXXXVI:Chap1:Sec1 mentioned.\n\nCedron\n\nThe ravine on the east of Jerusalem lies between the Holy City and the Mount of Olives. The word Cedron is usually connected with the root Qadár, ‘to be dark’, and taken to refer to the colour of the stream or ravine; but its exact origin and precise meaning are unknown.\n\nBkI:Chap3:Sec2 The monks of Saba and their politics there are mentioned.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap9:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCelakowsky, Franz Ladislaus\n\n1799-1852. A disciple of Herder and Goethe, he developed 19th century Slav poetry.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap11:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCelestines\n\nThis Benedictine congregation must not be confused with the Franciscan congregation of the same name. The order was founded in 1254 by Pietro di Murrone, afterwards Celestine V. At first the saint gave no written rule to his monks, but by his own life he provided an ideal for them to strive after. In 1264 Urban IV confirmed the order, and gave to it the Rule of St. Benedict. It was again confirmed by Gregory X in 1274.\n\nBkXIV:Chap2:Sec1 The Celestine monastery at Avignon was founded in 1393.\n\nCellamare, Conspiracy\n\nAntonio del Guidice, Prince of Cellamare (1657-1733), the Spanish ambassador in France, under instructions from Cardinal Alberoni, plotted with the Duke and Duchess of Maine to overthrow the Regent and appoint Philip V king of France.

As Demeter she is represented in the sky by the constellation and zodiacal sign of Virgo, holding an ear of wheat, the star Spica. It contains the brightest quasar, 3C 273. (The constellation alternatively depicts Astraea.) The worship of her and her daughter Persephone, as the Mother and the Maiden, was central to the Eleusinian mysteries, where the ritual of the rebirth of the world from winter was enacted. Ceres was there a representation of the Great Goddess of Neolithic times, and her daughter her incarnation, in the underworld and on earth.\n\nBkI:Chap6:Sec2 BkIX:Chap7:Sec2 Goddess of the wheat fields.\n\nBkVIII:Chap4:Sec2 Her daughter Persephone was raped and stolen away by Dis (Pluto), the God of the Underworld.\n\nBkXIV:Chap2:Sec4 Goddess of bread and flour.\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap5:Sec1 A canephorus is a sculptured Greek (youth or) maiden carrying a basket on the head at the feast of Demeter, Dionysus, or Athene.\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap8:Sec1 Goddess of the crops, therefore the hop fields.\n\nCervantes, Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra\n\n1547-1616.

He was denounced in September 1793 and imprisoned, subsequently under house arrest, After a warning he tried to commit suicide (according to Ginguené) first with a pistol then a razor on the 15th November; he died probably of his wounds on the 13th April 1794.\n\nBkV:Chap14:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nBkV:Chap15:Sec2 Argued with Chateaubriand over his politics.\n\nBkIX:Chap6:Sec2 His reaction to the invasion of the Tuileries in 1792.\n\nBkXI:Chap2:Sec2 A native of the Auvergne.\n\nChamisso, Ludolf Adelbert von (Louis Charles Adelaide de Chamisso de Boncourt)\n\n1781-1838. A German poet and naturalist, he was born at the Château de Boncourt, France. He served as page at the court of Frederick-William II of Prussia and, after army service and travels, became keeper of the royal botanical gardens. He edited (1804-6) the Musenalmanach and was a member of Mme de Staël’s circle. His sentimental poetic cycle Frauenliebe und Leben (1830) was set to music by Schumann. Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte (1814) is his tale of a man who sold his shadow to the devil. He also wrote plays, an account of his travels in the Pacific (1836), and a work on linguistics (1837).\n\nBkXXVI:Chap3:Sec1 Chateaubriand met him in Berlin in February 1821. He had taught at Napoléon-Vendée, founded by Napoleon, now La Roche-sur-Yon, in the Pays-de-la-Loire, for a few months (1810-1811). His ancestral home Château de Boncourt was in Champagne. His poem Das Schloss Boncourt was written in 1827.\n\nChamisso, Charles Louis Marie Hippolyte, Comte de\n\n1769-1841. A royalist, and editor of La Notice, he was a page to Louis XVI, and elder brother of Adelbert.\n\nBkXXVI:Chap3:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nChamonix, France\n\nThe town in eastern France in the Haute-Savoie department near the Swiss and Italian borders. It is close to Mont Blanc.\n\nBkXVII:Chap3:Sec1 Chateaubriand there in 1805.\n\nBkXXXV:Chap16:Sec1 Montenvers is connected to Chamonix by a rack and pinion railway, and is an access point for the Mer de Glace glacier.\n\nChampa\n\nThe best candidate for Chateaubriand’s tchampas is the champa of Sanskrit literature, Plumeria, or Frangipani e.g. Plumeria rubra, which has been grown on St Helena as an exotic introduction. R. O. Williams, in his manuscript book ‘Plants on St Helena’ (1989) lists Plumeria rubra (Frangipani) and mentions that ‘Strangely, except for the Jamestown valley it does not thrive.’ The common name ‘Frangipani’ comes from a sixteenth-century Italian noble family, a marquess of which invented a plumeria-scented perfume. Known as the Temple Tree, Pagoda Tree, Champa or Khairchampa in different parts of India, Frangipani (Family Apocynaceae) is one of the most extensively grown flowering trees. An emblem of immortality to both Buddhists and Muslims, it is frequently planted near monasteries and graveyards. The tree is grown in temples also for its daily supply of sweet, scented, fresh and creamy flowers. The exotic flowers open, bloom and fall on the earth almost throughout the year in temperate climates. It is not to be confused with champak another highly perfumed species of evergreen timber tree (Michelia champaca) native to India, with fragrant orange-yellow flowers that yield oil used in perfumery, and the flowers of which Indian women wear in their hair. (See Shelley’s Indian Serenade. ‘The Champak odours fail...’)\n\nBkXXIV:Chap12:Sec1 In the Valley of the Tomb on St Helena.\n\nChampagny, see Duc de Cadore\n\nChampagny, Nicolas Charles Stanislas Marie Louis Nompère, Vicomte de\n\n1789-1863.

When Quebec was captured by the English in 1620 he was taken prisoner. Lake Champlain which he visited in 1609 is named after him.\n\nBkVII:Chap10:Sec1 His description of the Canadian Indians.\n\nChamplâtreux\n\nThe chateau, at Epinay near Luzarches 17 miles north of Paris, was built between 1751 and 1753 for Jean-Baptiste Molé, President of the Paris Parliament, who married the daughter of Samuel Bernard, financier to Louis XIV and Louis XV.\n\nBkXIV:Chap1:Sec1 Inherited by Mathieu Molé.\n\nChampmeslé, Marie Desmares, called La\n\n1642-1698. French actress. She made her first appearance on the stage at Rouen with Charles Chevillet (1645-1701), who called himself Sieur de Champmeslé, and they were married in 1666. By 1669 they were playing in Paris at the Théatre du Marais, her first appearance there being as Venus in Boyer’s Fête de Venus. The next year, as Hermione in Racine’s Andromaque, she had a great success at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. Phèdre was the climax of her triumphs, and when she and her husband deserted the Hôtel de Bourgogne, it was selected to open the Comédie Française on the 26th of August 1680. Here, with Mme. Guérin as the leading comedy actress, she played the great tragic love parts for more than thirty years. La Fontaine dedicated to her his novel Belphégor, and Boileau immortalized her in verse.\n\nBkXIII:Chap9:Sec1 Her role as Iphigénie.\n\nChampollion, Jean-Francois\n\n1790-1832. A French classical scholar, philologist, orientalist, and Egyptologist, Champollion is generally credited as the father of Egyptology. Based on work by Thomas Young and William Bankes, Champollion translated parts of the Rosetta stone in 1822, showing that the ancient Egyptian was similar to Coptic, and the writing system was a combination of phonetic and ideographic signs.\n\nBkXXXI:Chap6:Sec1 A friend of Charles Lenormant.\n\nBkXLII:Chap18:Sec1 Mentioned. Chateaubriand uses the Hebrew name Mezraim for Egypt.\n\nChantelauze, Jean-Claude-Balthazard-Victor de\n\n1787-1859. Keeper of the Seal (Chancellor and Justice Minister) from May-July 1830.

Of the château, the country seat of the Duc de Choiseul, only the well-known pagoda remains.\n\nBkIX:Chap2:Sec1 BkXXXIX:Chap1:Sec1 Barthélemy joined Choiseul in exile there.\n\nChantilly, France\n\nA town and Château, it lies in the Oise. Rising from the confluence of the Seine and Oise rivers, twenty miles north of Paris, the Château de Chantilly is one of France’s largest estates. Built in 1560 by the architect Jean Bullant, for Anne de Montmorency, it came into the hands of the Condé family at the end of the 18th century. During the French Revolution, all of its works of art were transferred to the Louvre and it was used as a prison. Its last royal owner, the Duc d’Aumale donated the estate to the Institut de France in 1886. Its vast collection of manuscripts includes the fifteenth-century Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry. The White Queen’s Castle is a 12th century hunting lodge. The Commelle lakes, or pools, were laid out between 1204 and 1208 by the monks from Chââlis Abbey.\n\nBkXVI:Chap2:Sec1 Chateaubriand left Paris to spend a fortnight at Chantilly with his secretary Pilorge, on the 28th October 1837, to complete the manuscript of Le Congrès de Vérone.\n\nBkXVI:Chap2:Sec3 Birthplace of the Duc d’Enghien.\n\nBkXXXVII:Chap14:Sec1 The Condé family seat.\n\nChapelier, correctly Le Chapelier, Jean, also called Isaac\n\n1754-1794. Deputy for Rennes, he was the founder of the Breton Club (Jacobin Club). He introduced a motion in the National Assembly which prohibited guilds and trade unions. Le Chapelier and other Jacobins interpreted demands by Paris workers for higher wages as contrary to the new principles of the Revolution. The measure was enacted law on June 14, 1791 (It was subsequently known as the ‘Le Chapelier Law’) and effectively barred guilds and trade unions in France until 1884. During the Terror, he temporarily emigrated to England, but returned to France in 1794 in a hopeless effort to prevent the confiscation of his assets. He was arrested and guillotined on the 22nd April 1794 with Chateaubriand’s brother and Malesherbes.\n\nBkV:Chap12:Sec2 Introduced Chateaubriand to opposition deputies.\n\nBkX:Chap8:Sec2 His name appears on the death warrant exhibited, and he was executed with Chateaubriand’s brother.\n\nChapelle, Claude Emmanuel Luillier\n\n1626-1686. Chapelle, and François Lecoigneux de Bachaumont (1624-1702) were poets and authors of Voyage en Provence et en Languedoc (1656).\n\nBkXIV:Chap2:Sec5 Quoted.\n\nChaptal, Jean-Antoine-Claude, Comte de Chanteloup\n\n1756-1832. French chemist, industrialist, and statesman. He became (1781) professor of chemistry at Montpellier, and during the Revolution he was active in gunpowder production. Later, as minister of the interior (1801–9) and director-general of commerce and manufactures (1815) under Napoleon he introduced far-reaching reforms in medicine, industry, and public works. His writings pioneered the application of chemical principles to industrial processes.\n\nBkXIII:Chap11:Sec2 Became a supporter of Napoleon.\n\nBkXVII:Chap5:Sec1 Chateaubriand met him At La Chartreuse in 1805. At the start of the Consulate, he bought the estate of Chanteloupe which had belonged to the Duc de Choiseul. He developed sugar-beet production which replaced sugar cane production in Europe. Sugar cane has been known for at least 2200 years. Alexander’s army saw it during his conquest of India in 326BC. Theophrastus described ‘honey produced from reeds’, while Dioscorides, in the first century AD, described ‘a honey called sakkharon collected from reeds in India and Arabia Felix with the consistency of salt and which could be crunched between the teeth’. Hence Chateaubriand’s ‘Indian reeds’: sugar cane being cultivated throughout the Mediterranean, and planted by the Spanish in the West Indies.\n\nChardel, Casimir\n\n1777-1847. A judge in the Seine Tribunal and a Paris Deputy.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap8:Sec1 Named as Commissioner for Postal Services of the Municipal Commission, 29th July 1830.\n\nCharenton\n\nA suburb located to the south-east of Paris, Charenton-le-Pont lies at the junction of the Marne and Seine. A large mental hospital known as Charenton is situated in neighbouring Saint-Maurice, and the word Charenton is often used in French to signify an asylum, as Bedlam is used in English.\n\nBkII:Chap7:Sec5 On the 22nd of October 1685 the Act of Revocation of the Edict of Nantes was registered, and on the same day the Protestants were notified by a public spectacle that its execution had commenced. The great Church of Charenton built by the celebrated architect Jacques Debrosse, and capable of containing 14,000 persons, was razed to the ground, and a cross twenty feet high, adorned with the royal arms, was erected over the demolished edifice.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap17:Sec1 Mentioned, as the easterly direction from central Paris.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap19:Sec1 The asylum at Charenton mentioned.\n\nCharette, François Athenase de La Contrie de\n\n1763-1796. He served in the Navy under Toussaint de La Motte-Picquet, notably during the American War of Independence. He quit the Navy in 1789 and emigrated to Coblenz in 1792 (a common move for royalist aristocrats). He soon returned to France to live on his estate in Machecoul. In 1793, the Revolt in the Vendée broke out, and the peasants fighting against the Republic asked him to be their leader. He joined Cathelineau and fought in most of the battles of the \"Armée catholique et royale\". After the dispersal of the Vendean leaders in september 1793, he retired with his men. He became the leader of Basse-Vendée and successfully used guerilla warfare against the Republican troops, even managing to capture a Republican camp in Saint-Christophe, near Challans. On the 17th of February 1795, Charette signed a peace treaty with the emissaries of the National Convention, but broke his parole and returned to battle in July to help the invasion by emigrated aristocrats at Quiberon. The Count of Artois made him Lieutenant General, but he refused to lead the Royal Army. Charette later refused to join Orléans. Pursued by General Louis Lazare Hoche, he was defeated at Quiberon; wounded, he was captured and executed by firing squad in March 1796.\n\nBkV:Chap7:Sec1 BkXI:Chap3:Sec2 BkXXXV:Chap3:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nChariot\n\nA Paris auctioneer.\n\nBkXIX:Chap6:Sec1 Mentioned\n\nCharlemagne\n\nc742-814. King of the Franks (771-814), and the first post-classical western Emperor (800-814), he was the son of Pepin the Short. He conquered the Saxon tribes, and became King of Lombardy (773). Having subsequently conquered most of Western Christendom he was crowned Emperor of the West by Pope Leo III, His court at Aix-la-Chapelle became a major administrative and cultural centre as part of the Carolingian Renaissance.\n\nBkVII:Chap11:Sec1 The opening of his tomb c.1450.\n\nBkIX:Chap8:Sec2 Louis XI instituted a cult of Charlemagne and in 1483 offered a reliquary and a cover of cloth of gold to re-clothe his tomb, as well as an annual offering paid until 1775. Louis XVI offered his predecessor’s mortuary robe for the tomb.\n\nBkXIX:Chap14:Sec1 His epic stature.\n\nBkXX:Chap5:Sec3 Charlemagne created a type of academy, called the palace school or scola palatina, in Aachen. Another one was founded near Noyon by Carolingian leaders. The staff of scholars; the aristocrats and clergymen; and Charlemagne himself, shared the vision of educating the population in general, and of training the children of aristocrats in how to manage their lands and protect their states against invasion or squandering. These initiatives foreshadowed the rise, in the 11th century, of the universities of Western Europe.\n\nBkXXI:Chap2:Sec1 His piety before battle.\n\nBkXXI:Chap7:Sec1 His empathy. The source of the quote not known. Literally it means ‘the savage child trapped by the ice while playing on the Ebro.’\n\nBkXXIV:Chap8:Sec1 BkXXVI:Chap6:Sec1 An almost mythical figure of medieval legend.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap17:Sec1 Mourned at his death, the death of an age.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap12:Sec1 The feudal period following him.\n\nBkXXXIV:Chap4:Sec1 BkXXXVIII:Chap7:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nCharleroi\n\nThe town in south-central Belgium is on the River Sambre.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap18:Sec1 T"
