        "text": "oh look a teal dear. :D\n\nWhy I like them: Giulia’s story (from the little we know if it) is the story of a woman who took control of her circumstances and worked them to her benefit, elevating her own status and that of her family. She was married to Orsino Orsini at fifteen, and soon after (likely through some engineering on the part of her mother-in-law Adriana de Mila, who was Lucrezia’s guardian) she became the mistress of Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia.\n\nWhen Borgia became Pope, she reaped the benefits; her brother Alessandro was elevated to Cardinal and her husband was awarded governorship of Carbognano. By the age of nineteen, she was living with Adriana and Lucrezia as the latter’s maid of honour. Even after she fell out of favour with the Pope, she continued to thrive. After the deaths of her husband and Pope Alexander, she saw her only child, Laura Orsini, married to the nephew of then-Pope Julius II. She then became governor of Carbognano, proving herself to be an able administrator.\n\nOf course, we don’t know how much of her courting of the Pope came off her own initiative, and how much she was pushed into it by ambitious family members like Adriana. We don’t know so much about her. But we know that she succeeded in navigating these precarious circumstances; that she thrived, despite the insults and misogynistic slurs hurled her way. I think she’s fascinating.\n\nWhy I don’t: what is this “don’t”?\n\nFavorite anecdote: I can’t think of any anecdotes? oh, but here’s a bit of myth busting: there’s a story that somewhere in the Vatican Pinturicchio painted Alexander kneeling to a Virgin Mary painted with Giulia’s likeness. He actually did paint both of those things, but not in the same scene — the kneeling Alexander is adoring the risen Christ, while the Madonna with Giulia’s face is in another room altogether.\n\nFavorite quote: I don’t have any awesome Giulia-related quotes. Here is a lovely vivid description of Giulia from Lorenzo Pucci, though: “[She was] a most beautiful creature. She let her hair down before me and had it dressed; it reached down to her feet; never have I seen anything like it; she has the most beautiful hair. She wore a headdress of fine linen, and over it a sort of net, light as air, with gold threads woven in it. In truth it shone like the sun!”\n\nBrOTP: Giulia/Lucrezia\n\nOTP: idk, Giulia/fabulousness\n\nan-oh-god-what-did-that-have-to-happen: um?\n\nUnpopular opinion: Okay, not an unpopular opinion, but an interesting theory on Giulia: some revisionist scholars have challenged the idea that she was the pope’s mistress at all. They argue that the story is derived from slanderous gossip, pointing out that a sexual relationship is not necessary to justify her presence at the papal court — she was a member of a prominent family, as well as a part of the Borgias’ inner circle, since, through her mother-in-law, she had become a close friend of Lucrezia. Likewise, they say, Alessandro didn’t need his sister’s help to get his cardinal’s hat; his promotion was generally expected.\n\nI’m not convinced by the theory — I think if you look at the letters Giulia and Alexander exchanged alone, it’s clear she was more than just a ‘close ally’ — but I think it’s always worth remembering that we can’t always take what we read at face value. Look at how many biographers of Lucrezia still claim that she got pregnant to Perotto, despite the fact that the only “evidence” to support that is blatant slander! So it’s always worth thinking about the assumptions we make in interpreting history and what other factors could have been in play.\n\nA wish: MORE PRIMARY SOURCES.\n\n5 words to best describe them: A VERY AWESOME LADY. PERSON. (I did say I was bad at these five word things.)\n\nIf you could say one thing to them: I suppose the same goes for all the historical women I’ve rambled about, but— So much has been said about her over the years. Giulia la Bella. The bride of Christ. The Pope’s whore. I’d like to know her own story, in her own words.\n\nFavourite portrayal of them: So I’ve seen Giulia portrayed in The Borgias (of which I’ve seen all three seasons) and Borgia (of which I’ve only seen a few episodes). Lotte Verbeek in The Borgias is fabulous, but The Borgias seemed to have no real idea of what to do with Giulia after season 1 — and I think they really hamstrung themselves in terms of Giulia’s story by completely erasing Orsino and Adriana from the picture. Borgia, from the little I’ve seen of it, didn’t have that problem, and between Marta Gastini’s teenage Giulia’s ambitions and her abrasive relationships with Orsino and Adriana, the show offered her scope for a meatier role. But despite my many misgivings about The Borgias, well, at least it worked its way up to idiotic wtfery whereas Borgia started with it right out of the gate and kept on getting stupider to the point that I stopped watching.\n\nIN CONCLUSION TOM FONTANA AND NEIL JORDAN BOTH SUCK AND LOTTE VERBEEK IS A FABULOUS."
