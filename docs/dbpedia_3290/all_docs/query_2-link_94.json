Son of Orazio Pacca, Marchese di Matrice, he was elected titular archbishop of Damietta, September 26, 1785. In 1809, Pope Pius VII excommunicated Napoleon and on July 6, the Pope and Cardinal Pacca were arrested, the former being sent to Savona, the latter, on August 6, 1809, to Fenestrelle until 1813. In that year, he was allowed to join the pope in Fontainebleau; influenced the pope to retract the agreement with Napoleon and was deported to Uzès in January 1814; freed at the fall of Napoleon in April 1814. Returned to Rome and organized a State Junta to govern in the name of the absent pope. He participated in the conclaves up to that of 1830-1831.\n\nBkXX:Chap9:Sec1 BkXX:Chap9:Sec2 His arrest in 1809.\n\nBkXXII:Chap2:Sec1 At Fontainebleau in 1813.\n\nBkXXX:Chap1:Sec1 A candidate for the Papacy in 1829.\n\nBkXXX:Chap4:Sec1 Supported as a Papal candidate by France.\n\nPacca, Tiberio\n\n1786-1837. Nephew of the Cardinal, he was the second son of Giuseppe Pacca, Marquis of Matrice, and Maria Teresa Crivelli, a Milanese noblewoman. He entered the Roman prelature as referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature of Justice and of Grace on May 18, 1809. Prisoner of state in 1809; together with his uncle the cardinal, he was deported to the fortress of Fenestrelle, in the valley of Chisone, near Pinerolo, now in the province of Turin.\n\nBkXX:Chap9:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPadua, Italy\n\nThe capital of Padova province, it stands on the Bacchiglione River, 40km west of Venice and 29km southeast of Vicenza.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap3:Sec1 BkXL:Chap1:Sec1 BkXL:Chap7:Sec1 BkXLI:Chap7:Sec1 Chateaubriand was there in September 1833. Monselice is south of Padua on the way to Rovigo and Ferrara. The Castello Cataio, near Battaglia Terme, is a crenellated manor house which at that time belonged to the Duke of Modena.\n\nBkXL:Chap5:Sec1 Chateaubriand sight-sees in the city 20th September 1833.\n\nBkXL:Chap6:Sec1 Lombardy-Venetia was part of the Austrian Empire in 1833.\n\nPaestum, Italy\n\nA city of Lucania in Italy, the site is near modern Agropoli on the Bay of Salerno, a ruin in a wilderness, with Doric temples that surpassed those of Athens. Originally called Poseidonia, the city of Neptune, it was founded by Greeks from Sybaris in the 6th c. BC. It became Paestum when it passed into the hands of the Lucanians in the 4th century. It was taken by the Romans in 273BC. In antiquity it was famous for its roses, which flowered twice a year, and its violets. Malaria eventually drove away its population.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap1:Sec3 BkXXIX:Chap5:Sec1 BkXXXVIII:Chap5:Sec1\n\nIts roses.\n\nPaganini, Niccolò\n\n1782-1840.

An Italian composer, he served in St. Petersburg at the Court of Catherine II from 1776 to 1784. He was also briefly Napoleon’s maître de chapelle. He composed some 100 operas, church music, keyboard concertos, string quartets, and other works. His opera The Barber of Seville (1782) was so popular that for a time it hindered the success of Rossini’s work of the same name.\n\nBkVII:Chap6:Sec1 The famous duet Pandolfetto graziosetto.\n\nPajol, Pierre-Claude (Pajot), General\n\n1772-1844. He retired from the Imperial Army after a fine career, and became an industrialist. He took command of the National Guard in July 1830 and led the popular march to Rambouillet which forced Charles X to leave France. He later took command of the 1st Division and was made a Peer in 1831.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap5:Sec1 Active on the 29th of July 1830.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap14:Sec1 A supporter of Louis-Philippe.\n\nBkXXXIII:Chap4:Sec1 Leader of the march to Rambouillet on the 3rd of August 1830.\n\nPalais-Bourbon, Paris\n\nGiardini began to work on the building in 1722, Lassurance continued the work, Aubert and Gabriel completed it in 1728. It was originally built for Louis XIV’s daughter, the Duchess of Bourbon, who gave her name to the palace. In 1764, it became the property of the Prince of Condé and he developed the building as it is seen today. From 1803 to 1807, Napoleon commissioned Poyet to build the façade, to complement that of the Madeleine which it faces, in the distance at the end of the Rue Royale. The portico of the façade is enhanced by an allegorical pediment sculpted by Cortot in 1842. Other allegorised bas-reliefs on the wings are the work of Rude and Pradier. The interior is rich with works of art; it is worth noting that Delacroix decorated the library here from 1838 to 1845 with the History of Civilisation, while also in this room, Houdon sculpted busts of Diderot and Voltaire. Formerly assigned to the Council of the Five Hundred, and then to the House of Deputies, today it holds the National Assembly.\n\nBkXIV:Chap1:Sec2 Its outbuildings were used to house the new École Polytechnique from 1795-1805.\n\nBkXXXII:Chap5:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalais-Royal, Paris\n\nJacques Lemercier’s Palais-Royal began its existence on a much smaller scale as the Palais Cardinal. After Cardinal Richelieu’s death, it was occupied by Anne of Austria and her two sons, Louis XIV and Philippe, Duc d'Orléans, hence its later name, Palais Royal. It was notorious for its prostitutes. In 1780, it was greatly expanded by Victor Louis with rows of two-story houses enclosing a courtyard and arcades of shops lining the interior garden. During the Revolution, Parisians called it the Palais Egalité and under the Empire, the Palais du Tribunal. After the restoration of the Bourbon family in 1815, it became the Palais Royal once again. A mob completely wrecked the palace in 1848 but it was later restored by Napoléon III.\n\nBkIV:Chap3:Sec2 Its environs visited by Chateaubriand in 1786.\n\nBkV:Chap12:Sec2 Chateaubriand met Mirabeau there, on the 17th June 1790.\n\nBkIX:Chap6:Sec1 Chateaubriand visited a gambling club there in 1792.\n\nBkXIII:Chap4:Sec1 Visited by Chateaubriand in 1800.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap11:Sec2 Associated with the Duc d’Orléans.\n\nPalenque, Mexico\n\nSite of the Mayan ruins in the foothills of the Tumbalá mountains of Chiapas Mexico.\n\nBkVIII:Chap2:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalermo, Italy\n\nThe principal city and administrative seat of the autonomous region of Sicily, Italy it is the capital of the Province of Palermo.\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap5:Sec1 Its orange groves.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap2:Sec1 Chateaubriand writes to the Duchesse de Berry there in 1833.\n\nPalestrina, Madame\n\nShe was a member of the Roman nobility in 1828.\n\nBkXXIX:Chap8:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalinurus\n\nThe steersman of Aeneas in Virgil’s Aeneid, who, lulled to sleep, was thrown into the sea and drowned.\n\nBkXXXI:Chap1:Sec2 See Aeneid V:857-871.\n\nPalissot de Montenoy, Charles\n\n1730-1814. A French writer, he was an adversary of the philosophers and Encyclopaedists whom he ridiculed in his comedy ‘Les Philosophes’ 1760, and in ‘La Dunciade ou la Guerre des Sots’ his poem of 1764.\n\nBkIV:Chap12:Sec4 Mentioned.\n\nPalladio, Andrea\n\n1508-1580. An Italian architect born in Padua, famous for his much-imitated classical designs, he created many villas, palaces and churches, including S Giorgio Maggiore in Venice.\n\nBkXXXVIII:Chap8:Sec1 BkXXXIX:Chap3:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalladium, The\n\nAn image of Pallas Athene, said to have fallen from the sky at Troy. The safety of Troy depended on its preservation according to an oracle. It was stolen by Ulysses and Diomede.\n\nBkXXI:Chap8:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalm, Johann Philipp\n\n1768-1806. A German bookseller, in 1806 published a pamphlet (possibly written by Philipp Christian Yelin in Ansbach) entitled Deutschland in seiner tiefen Erniedrigung (‘Germany in her deep humiliation’), which strongly attacked Napoleon and the behaviour of the French troops in Bavaria. Napoleon had Palm arrested and handed over to a military commission with peremptory instructions to try and execute the prisoner within twenty-four hours. Palm was denied the right of defence, and after a mock trial on the 25th of August 1806 he was shot on the following day. It was to Palm that the poet Thomas Campbell was referring when he gave his famous (and possibly apocryphal) toast to Napoleon at a literary dinner. When this caused uproar, he admitted that Napoleon was a tyrant and an enemy of their country, ‘But gentlemen! He once shot a publisher.’\n\nBkXXII:Chap 20:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPalma il Vecchio, Jacopo\n\n1480-1528. A noted Venetian painter, he is referred to as Palma il Vecchio (Palma the Elder) to distinguish him from Palma il Giovane (Jacopo Palma II the Younger: 1544-1628), his grand-nephew.\n\nBkXXXIX:Chap4:Sec1 Both painters are mentioned.\n\nBkXL:Chap5:Sec1 Palma the Elder’s work in Padua.\n\nPalma-Cayet, Pierre Victor Cayet, Lord of La Palme, called\n\n1525-1610.

According to tradition, it was founded by Solomon. In the Bible it is called Tadmur (see 1 Kings 9:18). A prosperous caravan station in the 1st century BC, Palmyra became a Roman outpost and a major city-state within the Roman Empire in the 1st century AD. The Emperor Aurelian defeated its rebellious Queen Zenobia and razed the city in 232. It was subsequently taken by the Arabs and sacked by Tamburlaine.\n\nBkXXXV:Chap25:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPamfili, see Olimpia\n\nPamisus, River\n\nThe Greek river, the modern Pirnatza, flows through Messenia, in the south-western Peloponnese, through the most fertile region of Greece.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap6:Sec1 Referred to in Les Martyrs, Book XIII, and visited by Chateaubriand on his Levant Voyage.\n\nPan\n\nIn mythology, the Greek god of shepherds and their flocks, he has the hindquarters, legs, and horns of a goat, like a satyr.

In the Battle of Chesapeake Bay between the first division of De Grasse’s fleet and the British squadron he took an English frigate, and afterwards commanded a company of marines in the two assaults on Yorktown, where he was severely wounded. After 1783 he was promoted captain, created knight of Saint Louis, and made a member of the Society of the Cincinnati. In 1790 he took part in the first expedition to Santo Domingo, but, disapproving the principles of the French revolution, resigned and emigrated in 1792. He returned to Paris in 1800, and held during the whole of Napoleon’s reign the office of permanent under-secretary of the navy, which he exchanged at the restoration of Louis XVIII for that of secretary-general to the board of admiralty, with the rank of rear-admiral.\n\nBkXI:Chap2:Sec1 Chateaubriand met him at Mrs Lindsay’s.\n\nBkXI:Chap5:Sec1 His letter concerning readings from Le Génie.\n\nPanckoucke, Charles-André-Joseph\n\n1700-1753.

A Corsican patriot, he was the father of Pasquale. From 1733 he was the leader of the Corsican insurrection against the Genoese. He supported Neuhof in 1736. In 1739, defeated, he sought exile in Naples.\n\nBkXIX:Chap5:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nPaoli, Pascal (Pasquale)\n\n1725-1807. A Corsican patriot, in 1755 he returned to Corsica from exile with his father in Naples, led a successful revolt against the Genoese, and was chosen president under a republican constitution. His capital was at Corte. In 1768, Genoa sold Corsica to France. Paoli fought brilliantly against the superior forces of the French, but in 1769 was decisively defeated and fled to England. James Boswell, who had corresponded with him and visited him in Corsica, introduced him into the circle of Samuel Johnson. After the outbreak of the French Revolution, Paoli was appointed (1791) governor of Corsica. Accused (1793) of counter-revolutionary activities and summoned to Paris, he proclaimed the independence of Corsica and solicited British aid. With the help of Admiral Hood the French were defeated (1794). The pro-French party was banished and the Corsican national assembly (consulta) declared the island a British protectorate and chose an English governor. Paoli, who favoured independence and who had hoped to be appointed viceroy, was disappointed when Pozzo di Borgo became chief of the Corsican council of state. Paoli went to England in 1795 and remained there until his death. After his departure the islanders rose against the British and in 1796 drove them out with French help.\n\nBkXIX:Chap3:Sec1 Not Napoleon’s godfather, though Napoleon’s father had been of Paoli’s party.\n\nBkXIX:Chap4:Sec1 A letter to him from Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nBkXIX:Chap5:Sec1 BkXIX:Chap5:Sec2 Mentioned.\n\nBkXIX:Chap6:Sec1 Recalled from England in 1789 at Mirabeau’s prompting.\n\nBkXIX:Chap7:Sec1 Condemned by Napoleon for relinquishing power.\n\nPapelotte\n\nA farm on the field of Waterloo, it was defended by the Allies.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap17:Sec1 Mentioned.\n\nParamé\n\nA town near to Saint-Malo and incorporated in it in 1967.\n\nBkI:Chap3:Sec4 Mentioned.\n\nParcae\n\nThe Moerae, The Three Fates were the Three Sisters, the daughters of Night: Clotho, the spinner of the thread of life, Lachesis, chance or luck, and Atropos, inescapable destiny.

It gained further importance and independence under the Capetians.\n\nBkIV:Chap1:Sec3 BkIV:Chap8:Sec1 Chateaubriand’s hotel in 1786 and 1787 in the Rue du Mail, near the modern Place des Victoires, and the Bourse.\n\nBkIV:Chap10:Sec1 BkIV:Chap11:Sec1 BkIV:Chap12:Sec1\n\nBkIV:Chap13:Sec1 BkV:Chap1:Sec1 BkV:Chap2:Sec1 BkV:Chap4:Sec1\n\nBkV:Chap5:Sec1 BkV:Chap6:Sec1 BkV:Chap7:Sec1 BkV:Chap8:Sec1\n\nBkV:Chap9:Sec1 BkV:Chap10:Sec1 BkV:Chap12:Sec1 BkV:Chap13:Sec1\n\nBkV:Chap14:Sec1 BkV:Chap15:Sec1 BkXXV:Chap1:Sec1\n\nBkXXVI:Chap10:Sec1 This chapter written there. Chateaubriand returned to Paris from Berlin on the 26th April 1821 for the christening of the Duc de Bordeaux on the 1st May 1821 but did not resign his embassy until the 29th July, after the resignations of Villèle and Corbière.\n\nBkIV:Chap12:Sec4 BkXXII:Chap13:Sec1 Its ancient Roman name in Northern Gaul was Lutetia.\n\nBkVIII:Chap5:Sec2 Paris, Kentucky, in Bourbon County.\n\nBkXIII:Chap3:Sec1 Mrs Lindsay lived in the hamlet of Ternes, part of Neuilly, beyond the Barrière du Roule, now Place des Ternes.\n\nBkXIII:Chap4:Sec1 BkXIV:Chap1:Sec1 BkXIV:Chap5:Sec1 BkXV:Chap1:Sec1 This chapter and following chapters where indicated were written in Paris in 1837.\n\nBkXIII:Chap7:Sec1 Chateaubriand lodged in the Hôtel d’Étampes at 372 Rue Saint Honoré, one part of which was a three storey block giving onto the Rue Saint Honore itself, and near to the Rue Neuve-du-Luxembourg, the present Rue Cambon.\n\nBkXIV:Chap2:Sec1 BkXIV:Chap6:Sec1 BkXVI:Chap1:Sec1 This chapter and following chapters where indicated were written in Paris in 1838.\n\nBkXVII:Chap1:Sec1 Chateaubriand moved in mid-April 1804 to the present 31 Rue de Miromesnil.\n\nBkXVIII:Chap1:Sec1 This chapter and following chapters where indicated were written in Paris in 1839. In 1621, Anne of Austria provided a residence for the Benedictines of the Deep Valley, called the Valley of Grace (Val de Grâce). On the birth of the future Louis XIV in 1637, she decided to put up a baroque-style church. This church, started by Mansart, was completed by Le Mercier, Le Muet, and Le Duc. There are many beautiful sculptures as well as some magnificent paintings. The dome and the cupola are exquisitely decorated. After the Revolution, Val de Grâce became a military hospital. The Jardin des Plantes is the main botanical garden in France, situated on the left bank of the Seine. The garden was originally planted by Guy de La Brosse, Louis XIII’s physician, in 1626 as a medicinal herb garden. It was originally known as the Jardin du Roi. In 1650 it opened to the public. After a period of decline Jean-Baptiste Colbert took administrative control and Dr Guy Crescent Fagon was appointed in 1693, surrounding himself with a team of brilliant botanists, The Comte de Buffon became the curator in 1739 and he expanded the gardens greatly, adding a maze, round a tall mound built up from public waste in the 17th century, the Labyrinth, which remains today. In 1792 the Royal Menagerie was moved to the gardens from Versailles. Bernard de Jussieu planted the famous cedar of Lebanon in 1734 on the hillside facing the Seine, having obtained it from Kew Gardens in London.\n\nBkXX:Chap5:Sec3 The University of Paris (located partly in the college of the Sorbonne), dating back to the 12th century, was suspended during the Revolution and was re-opened by Napoleon in 1806.\n\nBkXXII:Chap9:Sec1 Chateaubriand stayed in a house at 194 Rue de Rivoli, on the corner of the Place des Pyramides.\n\nBkXXII:Chap11:Sec1 See the notes on the Jardin des Plantes above. The ‘tomb of the martyrs’ is Montmartre (Mons Martyrum according Parisian tradition)\n\nBkXXII:Chap18:Sec1 BkXXIV:Chap7:Sec1 BkXXIV:Chap16:Sec1 The Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile surmounts the hill of Chaillot at the center of a star-shaped configuration of 12 radiating avenues. It is the climax of a vista seen the length of the Champs Elysées from the smaller Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in the Tuileries gardens, and from the Obélisque de Luxor in the place de la Concorde. In 1806, Napoleon I conceived of a triumphal arch patterned after those of ancient Rome and dedicated to the glory of his imperial armies. The structure was designed by Jean François Thérèse Chalgrin (1739-1811) and completed in 1836 during the reign of Louis Philippe. Engraved around the top of the Arch are the names of major victories won during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods. The names of less important victories, as well as those of 558 generals, can be found on the inside walls. (Generals whose names are underlined died in action.) The sun shines beneath the arch at the start of May and in mid-August.\n\nBkXXII:Chap 25:Sec1 BkXXIII:Chap12:Sec1 On 5 December 1804, Napoleon presided over a ceremony on the Champ-de-Mars, in Paris, during which new colours were allocated to the regiments. When he attempted to re-establish his empire (the Cent-Jours, March-June 1815), a similar ceremony of eagle distribution was organized. The ceremony took place once again on the Champ-de-Mars, which was renamed Champ-de-Mai, to recall the May (or liberty) trees planted during the Revolution. The ceremony, was, however, postponed from May 26th to 1 June. The results of the vote on the new Constitution (there was a massive abstention) were to be declared on that day.\n\nBkXXIII:Chap18:Sec1 The Elysée Palace was built between 1718 and 1722. Owned at one time by Madame de Pompadour it was gifted to Louis XV at her death. Louis XVI set aside the house as a residence for Ambassadors Extraordinary in Paris; then in 1787 he sold it to his cousin, the Duchess of Bourbon. Bought by Murat it was gifted to Napoleon. Tsar Alexander of Russia moved into it during the occupation of Paris by the Allies, and the building was then placed at the disposal of the Duke of Wellington in November 1815. In 1816, it definitively became part of the Crown estates, and Louis XVIII granted it to his nephew, the Duc de Berry. In 1820, Louis Philippe took possession of the Palace, which thereafter became the residence of foreign State guests visiting Paris, until 1848. On December 12, 1848, the National Assembly issued a decree designating the ‘Elysée National’ as the Residence of the French President.

During the Reign of Terror (1793) Pasquier remained in obscurity; but this did not save him from arrest, shortly before the coup d’état of Thermidor (July 1794) which overthrew Robespierre. In the reaction that ensued he regained his liberty and estates. He did not re-enter public service until the period of the Empire, when the arch-chancellor Cambacérés used his influence with Napoleon to procure for him the office of Maitre des Requêtes to the council of state. In 1809 he became baron of the French Empire, and in February 1810 counsellor of state. Napoleon in 1810 made him Prefect of Police. The chief event which ruffled the course of his life at that time was the strange conspiracy of the republican general Malet (Oct. 1812), who, giving out that Napoleon had perished in Russia, managed to surprise and capture some of the ministers and other authorities at Paris, among them Pasquier. The collapse of this bold attempt enabled him, however, speedily to regain his liberty. When Napoleon abdicated in April 1814 Pasquier continued to exercise his functions for a few days in order to preserve order, and then resigned the prefecture of police, whereupon Louis XVIII allotted to him the control of roads and bridges. He took no share in the Imperial restoration at the time of the Hundred Days (1815), and after the second entry of Louis XVIII into Paris became Minister of the Interior, but resigned office. Under the more moderate governments of succeeding years he again held various appointments, but refused to join the reactionary cabinets at the close of the reign of Charles X.

In 1842 he was elected a member of the French Academy, and in the same year was created a duke.

The church of Notre-Dame de Nazareth in Plancoët was actually built in 1650 by the Dominicans and is not ‘gothic’, the ‘elms’ too are dubious. Chateaubriand constructs a Neo-Gothic scene for his own purposes.\n\nBkII:Chap10:Sec2 Chateaubriand visits his uncle in 1783-4.\n\nBkXVII:Chap5:Sec1 BkXLII:Chap18:Sec1 Recalled.\n\nPlanta, Joseph\n\n1787-1847.

The ancient sources are equivocal about how far east. All agree that the Black Forest formed the western side of the Hercynian. Pliny places the eastern regions of the Hercynium jugum in Pannonia (present-day Hungary) and Dacia (Book IV:25). He also gives us some insight into its composition. It contains gigantic oaks, he says (Book XVI:2). He is also subject to the mythological aura exuding from the gloomy forest.

Greek biographer and essayist, he was a citizen of Athens and Rome, a priest of Delphi, and director of a school in his native Chaeronea in central Greece. His Parallel Lives are biographies of twenty-three pairs of Greek and Roman statesmen and soldiers. The Moralia contains essays on ethics, science and literature.

It was from Plymouth that the Pilgrims sailed to the New World in 1620 aboard the Mayflower before landing at and founding the ‘Plymouth Colony’. Plymouth was where the defeated Napolean was brought aboard HMS Bellerophon before his exile to Saint Helena in 1815.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap4:Sec1 Napoleon there on board Bellerephon in 1815.\n\nPo, River\n\nThe Po flows 405 miles eastward across northern Italy, from Monviso (in the Cottian Alps) to the Adriatic Sea near Venice.

Under Napoleon I he was imprisoned (1804–14) for his part in the conspiracy of Georges Cadoudal. In 1815, Louis XVIII named him a peer of France. He served as ambassador to England from 1823 to 1829. A champion and leader of the ultra-royalists in the reigns of Louis XVIII and Charles X, Polignac was strongly clerical, even refusing to take the oath to the constitutional Charter on religious grounds. He became minister of foreign affairs and premier in August, 1829, and by his reactionary measures precipitated the July Revolution of 1830. In March 1830, a majority of the chamber of deputies demanded the dismissal of the Polignac ministry. Instead, the chamber was dissolved, and when the new elections again resulted in a liberal majority, Polignac issued (July 26, 1830) the July Ordinances, which dissolved the new chamber even before it met, established a new electoral law, and ended the freedom of the press. The July Revolution broke out immediately. Polignac was arrested and condemned by the chamber of peers to life imprisonment. Amnestied in 1836, he was banished and went to England.

He subsequently threw in his lot with Mark Antony. In the division of the provinces, Gaul fell to Antony, who entrusted Pollio with the administration of Gallia Transpadana (the part of Cisalpine Gaul between the Po and the Alps). In superintending the distribution of the Mantuan territory amongst the veterans, he used his influence to save from confiscation the property of the poet Virgil. In 40 he helped to arrange the peace of Brundisium by which Octavian (Augustus) and Antony were for a time reconciled. In the same year Pollio entered upon his consulship, which had been promised him in 43. It was at this time that Virgil addressed the famous fourth Eclogue to him. The following year Pollio conducted a successful campaign against the Parthini, an Illyrian people who adhered to Marcus Junius Brutus, and celebrated a triumph on October 25. The eighth Eclogue of Virgil was addressed to Pollio while engaged in this campaign. From the spoils of the war he constructed the first public library at Rome, in the Atrium Libertatis, also erected by him (Pliny, Nat. hist. xxxv. 10), which he adorned with statues of famous heroes.\n\nBkXXIV:Chap5:Sec1 Doubted the accuracy of Caesar’s Commentaries.\n\nPollux\n\nThe son of King Tyndareus of Sparta, and Leda, he was one of the twin Dioscuri, the brother of Castor.\n\nBkIII:Chap8:Sec1 Noted for his horsemanship.\n\nPombal, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of\n\n1699-1782.
