        "text": "Catholic Church History\n\nSecular Humanism (1453-1776) I. The Renaissance (1447-1517)\n\n1. The Secular Renaissance\n\nIThe Renaissance\n\n1. THE SECULAR RENAISSANCE\n\nA. Advent of the Renaissance\n\n(1) PREDISPOSITIONS\n\nSecularism. Besides the political revolt against the clerical theocracy, revealed at Anagni and\n\nduring the Great Schism, an intellectual alienation of affections had long been in formation. This\n\nhad developed slowly, for it required time for the ideas of the university intelligentsia to win\n\ngeneral favor. But from the fourteenth century onward, a secularist viewpoint had become\n\nincreasingly prominent within theocratic Christendom, and a new atmosphere of thought was\n\nalready vaguely termed vita moderna. Not only were temporal governments less responsive to\n\nsupernatural and international ideals, but the papal curia was affected by its preoccupation,\n\nlegitimate though it may have been, with politics and finance. Supernatural values, if still\n\naccorded paramount importance as ideals, were increasingly set aside in practice. The canon\n\nlawyer no longer had a monopoly of legal and administrative science; he was opposed by the civil\n\nlegist who sought his standards in pagan Roman antiquity. The clergy had ceased to be the only\n\neducated class, for the universities were now turning out graduates versed in philosophy, civil law,\n\nmedicine, and the arts. As has been noted in reference to the Councils of Constance and Basle,\n\nthe spiritual authority of the ecclesiastical hierarchy was in danger of being obscured by a swarm\n\nof academic \" experts,\" whose opinions were often heard against the voice of tradition. In\n\nscholastic speculations, moreover, the Nominalist deductions, or rather distortions, of Scotus's\n\nphilosophy were placing faith and reason into a new Opposition. And as the supernatural was\n\nthus divorced more and more from pure reason, the intellectual field was left open for a\n\nNaturalism disguised as Humanism. Humanism, indeed, can be taken in a legitimate and\n\nfavorable sense, but here stress is being laid upon some of its actual theological implications; in\n\nthis sense Humanism was to mean in the long run a reorientation of all human science, with man\n\ninstead of God as the objective: learning would become anthropocentric rather than, as in the Age\n\nof Faith, theocentric.\n\nNationalism. In the political sphere, nationalism was gaining in importance, though its appeal was\n\nstill more dynastic than popular. But in the world of literature it is perhaps licit to speak of an\n\ninchoate popular nationalism. Symptomatic was the rapid progress of the vernacular languages.\n\nThese had long since been the customary mode of communication among the common people;\n\nnow the vernacular began to challenge the position of Latin as the vehicle of learned letters. In\n\nItaly, this tendency appears in Dante, who may have been influenced by Provencal troubadours\n\nexiled by the Albigensian Crusade. It is true that Dante and his immediate successors often\n\nseem half-ashamed of their works in the common idiom, but the trend was to prove irresistible, if\n\nslow. It may be significant also that this vogue arose during the absence of the papacy at\n\nAvignon. In England, Langland, Chaucer, and Wycliffe made English respectable in literary\n\ncircles. The first two were Catholics, though critical ones, but the last manifested a tendency to\n\nmake the vernacular an instrument of national revolt against the Roman Church. France\n\npossessed Philippe de Commines and Francois Villon, the one the biographer of national\n\nmonarchy, and the other the bard of the populace. John Hus's use of the Czech tongue in\n\nestablishing his theological movement has already been noted. Per se, of course, there was no\n\nreason why the vernacular should have been antitheocratic, yet undoubtedly it did come often to\n\nserve nationalistic and anticlerical aims. Equally influential was a reaction to ancient \"classical\"\n\nLatin, as contrasted to \"barbarous\" scholastic Latin. Medieval Latin, however, had proved\n\nfunctional and colloquial; the resuscitation of antiquated classic forms by renaissance pedants caused the mummy to disintegrate on exposure to the air, and Latin presently became a dead language for all but a few scholars.\n\n(2) CHRISTIAN ASPECTS OF THE RENAISSANCE\n\nDante Alighieri (1265-1321) is, properly speaking, a Janus-figure between the Middle Ages and\n\nthe Renaissance. If the Italian poet of the Divine Comedy suggested a change in literary form, he\n\nin no way represented a departure from the norms of Christian culture: the content of his\n\nmasterpiece remained scholastic, though couched in language more elegant than that of the\n\naverage schoolman. It is, however, more akin to the emotional aspect of Humanism than to the\n\nRationalism of Scholasticism.\n\nFrancesco Petrarca (1304-74), on the other hand, despite some sighs for the past, much more definitely stood on the side of the new. He will be treated presently as well in the evolutionary stream of the pagan Renaissance as marking a deviation from medieval tradition. Yet even he posed as an ideal a Renaissance founded upon Christianity: \"Let us study philosophy so as to love wisdom. The real wisdom of God is Christ. In order to attain true philosophy, we must love and reverence Him above all things. We must first be Christians-then we may be what we will.\"\n\nChristian Humanism remained the standard of Ambrogio Traversari (1386-1439), a Camaldolese,\n\nwho introduced the new science of the age to the old through his unofficial school for Florentine\n\nclerics that discussed Greek and Latin literature. Gianozzo Manetti (1396-1459), Traversari's\n\npupil, was, though a layman, of dedicated learning and piety. He placed his knowledge of\n\nOriental languages at the service of Scripture scholars. Lionardo Bruni (1369-1444), a lay\n\nstudent of the papal and Venetian courts, was equally devoted to classical and monastic lore.\n\nChristian education was planned on the Renaissance model at Mantua by Vittorino da Feltre\n\n(1397-1446). This exemplary Catholic layman was commissioned by the Marquis of Mantua to\n\nopen a school for children of the nobility. Da Feltre did so in 1425 but soon added\n\naccommodations for poor scholars instructed \"for the love of God.\" He held that fixed hours for\n\nstudy ought to be varied by periods for physical education; hence he promoted excursions for\n\nnature study and recreation. He strove to punish more by disgrace than by the rod. Yet he\n\nmaintained the strictest moral discipline since he held that development of character was even\n\nmore important than that of the intellect. While he did not believe in humoring every adolescent\n\nwhim, he did strive to adapt his teaching and curriculum to personal differences. \"I want to teach\n\nthem to think,\" he declared, \"not to split hairs.\" The groundwork of his courses were the classics,\n\nmathematics, logic, and metaphysics. Although himself a lay professor for secular students, he\n\nattended Mass daily, said prayers before and after meals, and frequented the sacraments. Such\n\nwas his charity that he died penniless, but so long as he lived his academy was known as the\n\nCasa Jocosa: \"Happy House.\"\n\nChristian art did not leave the field entirely to the sensualists. Giotto (d. 1337) inaugurated a\n\nrenaissance of Christian architecture by his decoration of Italian churches. In conception and\n\ninspiration, his painting was medieval, but his style marked a transition toward modern\n\ntechniques, for he \"knocked a hole in the wall\" by pioneering three-dimensional murals. Fra\n\nAngelico (1387-1455) carried forward the new art in religious subjects with a vivid and simple\n\ntechnique. Other Italian artists were Ghiberti (1378-1455), Masaccio (1402-28), Lippi (140669),\n\nand Donatello (1386-1466), though they did not rise to the devotional standards of Giotto and Fra\n\nAngelico. German leaders were Van Eyck, Pature (1406-64), Holbein the Elder (1465-1524), and\n\nthe truly great Albrecht Darer (1471-1528). French artists of note were Jean Foucquet (1415-80)\n\nand Michel Colombe (d. 1512).\n\nUtility as well as elegance was an aim of building during the Christian Renaissance. Martin\n\nLuther himself attested this from observations made during his trip to Rome: \"In Italy the hospitals\n\nare handsomely built and admirably provided with excellent food and drink, careful attendants\n\nand learned physicians. The beds and bedding are clean, and the walls are covered with\n\npaintings. When a patient is brought in, his clothes are removed in the presence of a notary who\n\nmakes a faithful inventory of them, and they are kept safely. A white smock is put on him and he\n\nis laid on a comfortable bed with clean linen. Presently two doctors come to him and the servants\n\nbring him food and drink in clean glasses. .. .\"\n\n(3) EVOLUTION OF THE PAGAN RENAISSANCE\n\nFrancesco Petrarca, already cited as voicing a lofty ideal of a Christian Renaissance,\n\nunfortunately belied his Christian principles in his own life by a very pagan avidity for pleasure,\n\nhonor, and preferment: on Easter Sunday, 1341, he accepted the laurel of Rome's poet in the\n\nCapitol, and saluted Rienzi as restorer of ancient Rome. It is true that in many of his writings he\n\nserved the Church. He defended faith and morality and kept obscenity from his works. It has\n\nbeen noted that he was not blind to the dangers of the pagan classics: \"We must first be\n\nChristians, then we may be what we will.\" Yet this apparently sound principle may contain a\n\nfallacious interpretation that anything whatsoever might be reconciled with Christianity. Evidently\n\nhe believed that a smug contempt for Scholasticism could be so reconciled: \"We bid fair to be no\n\nlonger philosophers, lovers of the truth, but Aristotelians, or rather Pythagoreans, reviving the\n\nabsurd custom which permits us to ask no question except whether he said it.. .. I am confident\n\nthat he [Aristotle] was in error all his life; not only as regards small matters, where a mistake\n\ncounts for little, but in the most weighty questions.. .. Petrarca's career hints at a danger in the\n\neager pursuit of novelty: that pagan maxims, if rejected in theory, might be accepted in practice.\n\nPaganism, however, was sufficiently alien to Petrarca's real character to permit him a happy\n\nChristian death.\n\nGiovanni Boccaccio (1313-75) marked a literary, if not a personal, clash with Christian tradition.\n\nHe remained loyal to the Catholic faith, indeed, but he did not scruple to enshrine immorality in\n\nhis writings, especially his Decameron, which represented clerics and religious as the\n\n\"quintessence of all immorality and hypocrisy.\" Yet for Boccaccio, \"the spring was not yet broken\";\n\nhe might relish and relate immoral tales, but he did not defend immorality as good. In later life he\n\nreturned to stricter norms of life, repented of his writings which he desired burned, and died\n\npiously. It required some time, then, before the corrosive influence of sensuality could become so\n\nstrong that its devotees dared face eternity by its maxims.\n\nPoggio Bracciolini (1380-1459) was a great discoverer of classical manuscripts which he\n\npublished and imitated. He became a pedantic defender of the classics. Insult and calumny\n\npoured easily from his pen, and he could serve equally the Holy See and the Synod of Basle. On\n\nthe other hand, another partisan of Basle and author of immoral writings, Aeneas Silvius\n\nPiccolomini (1405-64), became the penitent Pius II. Grace can always work miracles, but as a\n\nrule the pagan humanists did not manifest such thorough conversions.\n\nLorenzo Valla (1407-57) seems to denote a deeper descent for he ridiculed morality and\n\nadvertised Epicureanism in his Book of Pleasure. His proof of the forgery of the \"Donation of\n\nConstantine\" started a vogue of true and false \"revelations\" which conveyed the impression that\n\nthe papal theocracy had been but an imposture. Yet even Valla conformed to convention\n\nexternally. He secured a post in the papal curia, and confined his malice to \"off-the-record\"\n\nremarks.\n\nAntonio Beccadelli (d. 1471), Valla's disciple, revealed the depths of the moral abyss yawning for\n\nthe pagan Renaissance. His Gospel of Pleasure was nothing short of a philosophic defense of\n\nimpurity and blasphemy based on the immoral norms of the Olympian gods. His vile\n\nHermaphraditus, a collection of obscene epigrams, finally evoked the censure of Pope Eugene"
