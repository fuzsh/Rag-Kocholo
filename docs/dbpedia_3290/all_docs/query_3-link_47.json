His last name is also listed as Duprat. Cousin of Cardinal Antoine Bohier du Prat, O.S.B. (1517).\n\nEducation. When he was ten years old, he was sent to study at a Benedictine abbey near Issoire and there, he combined the study of the first elements of science with the more gentle exercises of piety; later, his father sent him to study at one of the most prestigious European universities.\n\nEarly life. Named lieutenant general of the bailliaige of Montferraut, 1492. He married Françoise Veiny D'Abrouze in 1493 and had a daughter and two sons; the youngest one, Guillaume, became bishop of Clermont in 1527; she died on August 19, 1508 (1), when she was 30 years old. On August 11, 1495, he was appointed the general attorney of the Parlement of Toulouse. Named by King Louis XII maitre de requêtes of his household, January 25, 1504. Became fourth president of the Parlement of Paris in 1506; the following year, he became its first president. In 1507, Louise de Savoy, countess of Angoulême, entrusted him with the education of her son, the future King François I of France. Named chancellor and prime minister by King François I; on January 7, 1515, he took the oath of chancellor. In August 1515, he followed the king in his expedition to Italy; the victory of Marignano disconcerted the princes who fought against François, including Pope Leo X; on December 19, 1515 there was a conference in Bologna between the pope and the French king, attended also by Chancellor Du Prat; the chancellor negotiated with pope the Concordat of 1516, which did away with the principles of the \"Pragmatic Sanction\"; on the other hand, by granting the king the power to appoint the members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, replacing the traditional canonical elections, it gave the civil power an extraordinary authority over church affairs. After the meeting of the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, the chancellor was charged with negotiating, with Cardinal Thomas Wolsey of England, the mediation of King Henry VIII to end the fight between France and the House of Austria; the English king was not willing to act at that time amd the negotiations failed. The French king named him count of Valteline. Entered the ecclesiastical state.\n\nSacred orders. Ordained in 1517, after the death of his wife.\n\nEpiscopate. Elected archbishop of Sens, March 20, 1525; occupied the see until his death. Consecrated (no information found). His episcopal motto was Spes mea Deus. Prior of Saint-Benoît (Fleury) sur Loire from 1525.\n\nCardinalate. Created cardinal priest in the consistory of November 21, 1527 (2); received the red hat and the title of S. Anastasia, April 27, 1528. Administrator of the metropolitan see of Albi, December 23, 1528 until his death. Legate a latere in France, June 4, 1530. On August 5, 1529, he presided over the conference of Cambrai, where peace between Louise of Savoy and Marguerite of Austria was signed. In 1532, he completed the union of Brittany to France. Chancellor Du Prat played an important role opposite the pope concerning the remarriage of King Henry VIII of England; he stated the risk of a refusal and wrote the pope a letter in January 1532 expressing it, making sure that the letter was made public; but the repudiation of the aunt of the emperor, Queen Catalina of Aragón, was not easy for this weak pope and made him accept the other side. In October 1532, he participated in a meeting, prepared by Du Bellay, with the English king in Bologna; the matter became very difficult because of the impatience of King Henry, who had gotten married again without permission from the pope; when the excommunication against the king was issued by the pope, Chancellor Du Prat, who took his clerical duties very seriously and did not want to risk the concordat, did not follow the English king in his break with Rome. Administrator of the see of Meaux, February 20, 1534 until his death (3). Did not participate in the conclave of 1534, which elected Pope Paul III. He is considered one of the most notable men of ancient France, second only to Cardinal Armand-Jean du Plessis de Richelieu because of his influence on the life of his country. He did all in his power to increase the absolute power of the king at expense of the French nobility taking hard measures and using an elaborate fiscal system against them. He strongly and decidedly opposed the advance of Protestantism, at times allowing the use of torture and death; and was a great supporter of the renaissance of letters.\n\nDeath. July 9, 1535, at his family's Chateau de Nantouillet, near Meaux. Transferred to Sens (4) and buried, according to his will, in its metropolitan cathedral (5). In 1793, during the French Revolution, his funeral monument was destroyed and his ashes dispersed.\n\nBibliography. Berton, Charles.

Biographical data, in Italian; his genealogy, A1 D1 E2; and tomb of his brother, Angelo Pappacoda, bishop of Martorano, buried next to him in the church of S. Giovanni dei Pappacodi in Naples.\n\n(1) This is according to Weber, Genealogien zur Papstgeschichte, IV, 725; his genealogy, linked above, indicates that he was the second of seven children.\n\n(2) This is according to his genealogy, linked above, which mistakenly says that he received on November 21, 1537; none of the other sources consulted mention the assignation of a title.\n\n(3) Cardella, Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa, IV, 99, says that it is believed that he was created cardinal but that this is not certain, adding that it is certain that he was one of the three who offered assistance to the pope while he was a prisoner at Castello Sant'Angelo and that after his destinazione (destination) to the cardinalate, he was not actually counted among them, did not receive the insignias and that the viceroy of Naples obtained, that in place of Bishop Pappacoda, were named a person of his preference; Cardella adds that the historians are divided on the subject of the promotion, indicating that some believe that having been truly and really created a cardinal, Pappacoda preferred to remain simply a bishop, while other historians believe that the pope wanted to promote him because of his knowledge and his other qualifications but that he penetrato da sentimenti di sincera umilità (penetrated of sentiments of sincere humilty) obtained from the pope not to be adscribed to the Sacred College considering himself unworthy of such an eminent dignity; Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Aevi, III, 20, says a Clemente VII cardinalis creatus dignitatem sibi oblatam non assumpsit (created cardinal by Clement VII, he did not assume the diginity offered to him); and Weber, Genealogien zur Papstgeschichte, IV, 725, says dignitatem non assumpsit (the dignity was not assumed).\n\n(4) This is according to his biography, linked above; and his genealogy, also linked above; Cardella, Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana Chiesa, IV, 99, says that he died tra le braccia della sua diletta Chiesa (in the arms of his beloved church), which was presumably the diocese of Tropea, where he was a bishop for thirty seven years.\n\n(5) This is the text of his epitaph taken from the addition of Ferdinando Ughelli, Cist., to Chacón, Vitæ, et res gestæ Pontificvm Romanorum et S.

Ughelli adds that, although Bishop Pappacoda declined the cardinalate, preferring to remain only a bishop, his promotion was mentioned in his epitaph ad immortalitatem ipsius gloriam a posteris.\n\nNote.
