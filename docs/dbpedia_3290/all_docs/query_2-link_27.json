On October 4, Louis XIII summoned another council of war at Picqueos, to which Bassompierre went. On his arrival he was met by PÃ¨re Arnoux, the Kingâs Jesuit confessor, who said to him: âWell, Monsieur, Montauban is going to be given, so they say, to him who offers the lowest price for it, as they give the public works in France. In how many days do you offer to take it?â Bassompierre replied that no one would be so presumptuous as to name a day by which a place like Montauban could be taken, and that the duration of the siege would {322} depend on many circumstances. âWe have bidders much more determined than you are,â rejoined the Jesuit. And he told him that the leaders of the Le Moustier division had pledged âtheir heads and their honourâ to take Montauban in twelve days, provided that the Guards would hand over to them the greater part of their cannon; and that it was with the object of deliberating upon this proposal that the council had been summoned. He then advised Bassompierre, with whom he was on very friendly terms, that he and colleagues âwould do a thing agreeable to the King and the Constable by not opposing it, unless they were prepared to pledge themselves to place Montauban in the Kingâs hands in an even shorter time.â\n\nBassompierre thanked the Jesuit, and drawing Praslin and Chaulnes aside, told them of the proposal which the leaders of the Le Moustier division—Schomberg, Saint-GÃ©ran and Marillac—intended to make at the council, though he did not tell them of the source of his information, which he allowed them to think was the King himself. He then pointed out that these officers, who had been in anything but good odour with the King and the rest of the army since their refusal to attack the bastion of Le Moustier, hoped to rehabilitate their reputation for courage by offering to accomplish a task which they must very well know to be impossible, even with the assistance of the Guardsâ cannon. They undoubtedly believed, however, that Praslin and Chaulnes would refuse to surrender their artillery, in which event they would gain credit with the King for having made the offer, and, at the same time, throw the responsibility for being unable to carry it out upon the officers of the Guardsâ division, of whom they were bitterly jealous. And he begged the two marshals âin Godâs nameâ not to fall into the trap prepared for them by refusing to give up their cannon. The latter agreed to do as he advised, and they went into the room where the council was assembling. {323}\n\nThe Constable opened the proceedings in a lengthy speech, in which he exhorted the marshals and generals present to âlay aside all emulations, jealousies and envies,â and co-operate loyally together for the service of the King. Then he turned to the leaders of the Guardsâ division and âinquired how long precisely they would require to take the town.â Bassompierre and the two marshals, after a pretence of consulting together, answered that they had done, and would continue to do, everything that was humanly possible to achieve this result, but that they were not prepared to name any definite time. The Constable then said that the officers from Le Moustier were ready to pledge themselves to take the town in twelve days; and Saint-GÃ©ran, turning to the King, exclaimed: âYes, Sire, we promise it you upon our honour and upon our lives!â\n\nBassompierre and his colleagues applauded their resolution to render this great service to the King, and assured them that, as devoted servants of his Majesty, if there were any way in which they might contribute to the success of their enterprise, they had only to command them. Upon which the Constable said that the King wished them to send to Le Moustier sixteen of their siege-guns. To this they at once consented, and added that, if men were needed, they would willingly send 1,500 or 2,000, and Bassompierre himself would command them.\n\nThe officers from Le Moustier, much embarrassed, for they had counted with confidence on their demand for the Guardsâ cannon being refused, thanked them, and said that their artillery was all that they required. The others then said to the Constable that, in view of the fact that they were surrendering practically the whole of their siege-guns, they presumed that the King would discharge them from the obligation of taking the town; and they were given to understand that all that would be required of them would be to divert the enemyâs attention from Le Moustier by occasional attacks and mines. {324}\n\nWithin the next forty-eight hours the Guardsâ cannon was delivered at Le Moustier; but when Bassompierre went there on the 10th, on the pretext of visiting a friend of his who had been wounded, to see how matters were progressing, he found that the batteries were very badly placed, and that, notwithstanding the weight of gunfire, comparatively little impression had been made on the defences.\n\nOn the previous day, Bassompierre, catching sight of La Force on the ramparts of Ville-Nouvelle, had gone forward, under a flag of truce, to speak to him. He found the Huguenot chief eager for some arrangement which would put an end to this fratricidal struggle; and, at his suggestion, he spoke to Chaulnes and urged him to persuade the Constable to meet Rohan, who, La Force had given him to understand, would be willing to approach Montauban for that purpose, and discuss with him terms of peace. This Chaulnes agreed to do, and on October 13 an interview took place between Luynes and Rohan at the ChÃ¢teau of Regnies, some four leagues from Picqueos. After a long consultation, terms were agreed upon, subject to the approval of the King and the Council, which, says Bassompierre, were âadvantageous and honourable for the King and useful for the State.â But when the Council met, Schomberg urged that a decision should be postponed until after he and his colleagues at Le Moustier had made their attempt to take the town, which he was confident would be successful. In that event, he pointed out, they would be able to impose much more severe terms on the Huguenots. And he swore âon his honour and his lifeâ that he would take Montauban within the time specified. The King and the Council, impressed by such unbounded confidence, agreed to do as he advised.\n\nOn the 17th, the Constable sent for Bassompierre to come to Le Moustier, where he had gone to dine with Schomberg, and inquired whether a mine which he had instructed him to prepare some days before were finished. {325} Bassompierre replied in the affirmative, upon which the Constable said: âIt must be exploded to-morrow so soon as you receive the order from me, for, if it please God, to-morrow we shall be in Montauban, provided everyone is willing to do his duty.â Bassompierre answered that he could rely on the Guardsâ division doing theirs, when Luynes told him that the explosion of the mine must be followed by a feint against the advanced-works of Ville-Nouvelle, in order to divert the enemy while the Le Moustier division stormed the town. Bassompierre had heard during the past two days a furious bombardment proceeding in that quarter, but when he scanned the defences, he could not perceive any practicable breach nor even the appearance of one. âMonsieur,â said he, âyou speak with great confidence. May God grant that it may be justified!â Both the Constable and Schomberg appeared to regard the taking of the town as already assured, and, as he took leave of them, the latter said: âBrother, I invite you to dine with me the day after to-morrow in Montauban.â âBrother,â answered Bassompierre, âthat will be a Friday and a fish-day. Let us postpone it until Sunday, and do not fail to be there.â\n\nBassompierre transmitted the order which he had received from the Constable to Chaulnes and Praslin, who instructed him to take charge of the mine, and to have everything in readiness for the diversion they were to make on the morrow.\n\nThe eventful day which, if Schomberg and his colleagues were to be believed, was destined to atone for all the toil and bloodshed of the past two months, arrived, and with it the King, the Constable, the Cardinal de Retz, PÃ¨re Arnoux, Puisieux, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and many other distinguished persons, who were conducted by them to carefully-selected positions from which they would be able to enjoy an uninterrupted view of the storming of the town. At the same time, they ordered their servants to pack up their plate, linen, and so {326} forth, as they intended to sup and sleep in Montauban. âAnd many other things they did more ridiculous than I shall condescend to write down.â\n\nEarly in the afternoon, the Guardsâ division received orders âto begin the dance,â and Bassompierre fired his mine, which blew a big hole in the enemyâs advanced-works in that quarter and sent an unfortunate young officer of the Guards, the Baron dâAuges, into another world. Mines, in those days, appear to have had an unpleasant way of taking toll of both sides. The Guards occupied the crater, but, in accordance with their orders, did not advance any further. At the same time, the troops at Ville-Bourbon made a similar diversion.\n\nThe great assault, however, tarried. It tarried so long that at length the King grew impatient, and sent to Schomberg and his colleagues to inquire the reason why they did not advance. They replied that there was no breach that was practicable. Presently, he sent again, and was informed that, though there was a breach, scaling-ladders would be required, and these had not yet arrived. The scaling-ladders were brought, and once more the King wanted to know why they did not attack. The answer was that the delay had enabled the enemy to repair the breach; it would have to be reopened by a fresh bombardment.\n\nâFinally,â says Bassompierre, âafter having wasted the whole day up to six oâclock in the evening, and kept 600 gentlemen and a great number of people of note under arms all day, without doing or attempting to do anything, unless it were to kill a good many people of the town who showed themselves, they sent to tell the King that they had freshly reconnoitred the place where the attack must be delivered, and that truly it was not practicable. And upon that everyone went home.â\n\nNext day, Louis XIII sent a message to Ville-Nouvelle requesting one of the two marshals or Bassompierre to come to Picqueos; and it was decided that Bassompierre {327} should go. He found the King in his cabinet with the Constable, the Cardinal de Retz, and RoucellaÃ¯, and it was plain that his Majesty was in a very ill-humour. âBassompierre,â said he, âyou have long been of opinion that nothing of any use would be accomplished on the side of Le Moustier.â âYour Majesty will pardon me,â answered Bassompierre, âbut I never believed that everything that was proposed would succeed. Nevertheless, one must judge things by the results.â The King then told him that Schomberg and his colleagues had assured him that in five days they would be able to establish a battery of their heaviest guns on a knoll within a very short distance of the walls, and open a breach which would enable them to storm the town; and inquired what he thought about it. Bassompierre replied that, if they did succeed in establishing a battery there, the town must fall; but he very much doubted whether the enemy would allow them to do it. âAnd I,â exclaimed the King angrily, ârefuse to wait for what they wish to do. For they are deceivers; and I will never believe anything they say again.â The Constable here interposed, and begged his Majesty to remember that the generals at Le Moustier were as much mortified as he was at the fiasco of the previous day. And he asked that they might be given another chance of redeeming their promise to take the town. To this the King agreed, and Bassompierre was told to arrange another diversion when the time for the assault to be delivered should arrive.\n\nHowever, it never did arrive. During the next few days the knoll was fortified without any interference from the enemy, and nothing remained but to get the guns into position. But, on the early morning of the 25th, the garrison exploded a mine under the knoll which blew it up with its defences, and followed this up by a murderous sally against the Picardy Regiment, who were driven out of their trenches with heavy loss. Three nights later, they made another sortie, this time at the expense of the {328} Champagne Regiment, and, breaking right through it, penetrated to the besiegersâ battery-positions and destroyed one of their largest guns.\n\nAfter this it was obviously impossible to continue the siege with the smallest hope of success; the winter was coming on; the army, badly paid and badly fed, with no confidence in its leaders, and harassed incessantly by a bold and resolute enemy, was becoming demoralised and was dwindling every day from death, sickness and desertion. Of 30,000 men who had encamped before Montauban at the end of August, only 12,000 effective combatants remained; and the division before Ville-Bourbon was now so weak that its leaders were obliged to ask the Guards for assistance to enable them to hold their trenches against the perpetual attacks to which they were exposed.\n\nOn the morrow, the Constable came to Le Moustier and summoned a council of war to decide what was to be done. âEveryone saw plainly,â says Bassompierre, âthat we had no longer the means of continuing the siege; but no one wished to propose that it should be abandoned.â At length, Bassompierre took upon himself to do so and urged that they should âreserve the King, themselves and this army for a better future and a more convenient season.â To this the other leaders offered no opposition, and the Constable proceeded to communicate their decision to the King. Louis XIII, with tears in his eyes, directed Bassompierre to supervise the raising of the siege, and afterwards to march, with the greater part of the army, on Monheurt, a little town on the Garonne which had just revolted, as he and the Constable desired to terminate the campaign with a success, however unimportant it might be.\n\nTo raise the siege without the risk of incurring further losses was far from an easy task, as, unless every precaution were taken, there was grave danger that the garrison, flushed with success, might sally out and fall upon the {329} rear of the army while it was crossing the Tarn. However, Bassompierre appears to have made his arrangements with considerable skill, and on November 10 the last of the troops were withdrawn, with no more serious interference than a little skirmishing.\n\nThe disastrous result of the siege of Montauban caused general exasperation against Luynes, who met with a very bad reception from the people of Toulouse—numbers of whose relatives and friends had fallen during the siege—when he accompanied the King thither about the middle of November. The High Catholic party was particularly furious, and accused the Constable, not only of incapacity, but of treason. What was a more serious matter for him, was the fact that the King was growing weary of his favourite.\n\nThis change in Louis XIIIâs attitude towards the man whom he had raised so high, and who had so long exercised such an absolute dominion over him, seems to have begun some months before; but it was at first carefully concealed from all but two or three of his intimates.\n\nA few days after this conversation, Bassompierre was sent to Paris, at which he was much relieved, âsince he found that confidences of the King were very dangerousâ; and when, some weeks later, he rejoined the army at the beginning of the siege of Montauban, he took care never to approach his Majesty unless he were sent for.\n\nThe King began to laugh, and told Bassompierre that he would answer for Puisieuxâs discretion. Then he began a long tirade against his favourite, and appeared particularly indignant that the latter should, on the death of Du Vair, the Keeper of the Seals, which had occurred at the beginning of August, have persuaded him to give him the vacant post, notwithstanding that it was as contrary to usage as to common sense for a man to hold the Seals and the Constableâs sword.[1]\n\nBassompierre left the royal presence, feeling very uneasy. He saw clearly that Luynes was losing his hold over the King; but he knew that it might be some time before the young monarch would be able to summon up sufficient resolution to shake it off entirely; and, meanwhile, if Puisieux, whom he thoroughly distrusted, were to abuse the Kingâs confidence, and lead the Constable to believe that he was endeavouring to influence his Majesty against him, he would find himself in an even more difficult situation than he had the previous year. He {332} therefore decided that his safest course was âto make some representations to him [Luynes] on the subject, for his good,â without, however, allowing the Constable to suspect that the King had spoken to him. They would probably be well received, for, since his return from Spain, the favouriteâs manner towards him had been very cordial, and he appeared most anxious that Bassompierre should identify his interests with his own by marrying his niece.\n\nâSome days after this, happening to be in his cabinet with him, I told him that, as his very humble servant, devoted to his interests, I felt myself obliged to point out to him that he did not cultivate sufficiently the good graces of the King, and that he was not so assiduous in doing this as heretofore; that, as the King was increasing in age and in knowledge of things, and he in charges, honours and benefits, he ought also to increase in submission towards his King, his master, and his benefactor, and that, in Godâs name, I begged him to take care and to pardon the liberty I had taken in speaking to him concerning it, since it proceeded from my zeal and passion for his very humble service.â\n\nThe favourite took Bassompierreâs warning in very good part, but made light of it:\n\nDuring the closing weeks of the siege of Montauban, whenever the King had an opportunity of speaking to Bassompierre privately, he âcomplained incessantly of the Constable.â The love—it was of a very innocent kind—which Louis had hitherto entertained for Luynesâs beautiful wife, Marie de Rohan, no longer protected her husband. This love had, in fact, changed into hatred, since his Majesty had perceived that the lady was accepting other attentions, without doubt less platonic than his.\n\nAnd he took a particularly mean way of avenging himself.\n\nA few days after the siege of Montauban had been raised, the Kingâs other two confidants, the Jesuit PÃ¨re Arnoux and Puisieux, the former of whom suspected Luynes of desiring to make peace with the Protestants on their own terms, joined forces to procure the downfall of the favourite. But they had underrated the power which habit and the fear of change exercised over the cold heart and indolent mind of Louis XIII. He betrayed them to Luynes, or, perhaps, the pusillanimous Puisieux may have {334} betrayed his fellow-conspirator. Anyway, Luynes learned of the intrigue and insisted on the Jesuitâs disgrace; and âthe first news that I had from him [the King],â says Bassompierre, âwas that he had been constrained to abandon PÃ¨re Arnoux to the hatred of the Constable.â The King added that Bassompierre âmight be assured that there was nothing against him.â Nevertheless, says that gentleman, âI did not fail to be in great apprehension, although I could say that every time that the King had spoken to me on the subject I had warded off his blows, and that I had been infinitely distressed that he had ever made me the recipient of his confidence.â\n\nHowever, Bassompierre need not have been alarmed, as it was very soon to be beyond the power of Luynes to injure anyone.\n\nOn November 16 Bassompierre and his army encamped before Monheurt, and on the 18th the trenches were opened. A day or two later he had an exceedingly narrow escape of his life.\n\nHe was riding, followed by two aides-de-camp, from the trenches of the Piedmont Regiment, to those of the Normandy Regiment, a journey which he had made several times already without interference from the garrison, although it was well within musket-shot of the town, and âdressed in scarlet, with the cross on his cloak, and mounted on a white pony, he was easily recognisable.â Suddenly, the advanced bastion and counterscarp bristled with musketeers, who began firing at him and âwith such fury that he heard nothing but balls whistling about him.â One ball struck the pommel of his saddle and another pierced his cloak, but he managed to reach a large tree without being hit, and took shelter behind it. Here he was in safety, though the enemy fired more than a hundred shots at it. At length, the firing ceased and, thinking that they had exhausted their ammunition, he mounted and galloped towards the {335} trenches of the Normandy Regiment. However, they had only been waiting for him to show himself, and, so soon as he did so, they began firing at him again as fiercely as ever. âBut,â says he, âas my hour was not yet come, God preserved me against the attempt; though I believe I was never nearer death than I was on that occasion.â\n\nThe weather was very bad, rain falling incessantly, and the soldiers were nearly up to their knees in mud. Nevertheless, they worked well, and by the 22nd, on which day the siege-artillery arrived, they had pushed their trenches close to the walls.\n\nMeanwhile, Bassompierre had received a secret communication from the Marquis de Mirambeau, the commander of the garrison, who offered to surrender Monheurt, in consideration of receiving a sum of 4,000 crowns and a formal pardon for his offence of having taken up arms against the King. The MarÃ©chal de Roquelaure, lieutenant-general of Guienne, had lately arrived to take the nominal command of the siege operations. But he left their direction entirely in Bassompierreâs hands, and, as Mirambeau had requested that he should not be informed of his offer, it was communicated to Louis XIII, who was still at Toulouse. This decided the King and the Constable to come to Monheurt, âin order to have the honour of taking it.â\n\nOn the 23rd, Bassompierre, after inspecting one of his batteries, advanced a few paces in front of it to survey some point in the defences. âThe gunners,â he says, ânot thinking that I was there, discharged their pieces, the wind of which threw me very rudely to the ground, and left me with a singing in my right ear, accompanied by insupportable twinges.â Two hours later he was taken ill with fever, but he remained on duty all that day, during which the trenches were pushed up to the border of the moat. Next morning, however, he was so much worse that he wrote to the King and the Constable asking to be relieved of his command, and saying that he {336} proposed to go to La RÃ©ole, where he could secure skilled medical attention, for he was too prudent to trust himself to the care of the army surgeons. He also begged them to send him a doctor.\n\nNext morning he received a very kind letter from the King, granting his request and informing him that he was sending a doctor, upon which he embarked in a boat, accompanied by his personal attendants and a guard of Swiss halberdiers, and set off down the Garonne towards La RÃ©ole.\n\nOn arriving at Tonneins, about midway between Monheurt and Marmande, he learned that a small force of cavalry was crossing the river to the right bank, and that they were the Constableâs own company of gensdarmes.\n\nHe sent for the officers in command to inquire where they were going, and was told that they had received orders from the MarÃ©chal de Roquelaure to take up their quarters in a little town called Gontaud, about half-a-league from Marmande. He expressed his surprise that Roquelaure should send a small body of cavalry, unaccompanied by infantry, to an open town in the midst of the enemyâs country, where there was a great danger of their being surprised; and, aware that the King and the Constable would certainly cancel the order if they were informed of it, begged the officers to return, while he sent a message to the King requesting that they should be quartered at Marmande, which was a walled town. But the officers pointed out that the baggage had already been sent on to Gontaud; and, on their assuring him that they would keep a sharp look-out that night, and on the morrow ask to be transferred to safer quarters, he allowed them to proceed, although he felt very uneasy.\n\nOn reaching Marmande, he felt so much worse that he decided to remain there for the night, instead of continuing his journey to La RÃ©ole, and therefore had himself carried to an inn in the suburb, and sent for a doctor. But the only one who could be found was a country-practitioner, {337} to whose tender mercies Bassompierre did not feel inclined to entrust himself. However, shortly afterwards, a quack doctor named Duboure, whom the Baron dâEstissac had sent after him, arrived on the scene. Duboure was none too sober, but he possessed remedies which afforded the patient some temporary relief, and about nine oâclock in the evening one of the Kingâs own physicians, named Le Mire, whom his Majesty had sent, made his appearance. The great man, after consulting, for formâs sake, with his humble colleagues, âproceeded to scarify him and apply leeches to his shoulders, in order to remove the furious tingling which he had in the head.â\n\nWhen morning dawned, the good citizens of Marmande, having satisfied themselves that there were no Huguenots lurking in the vicinity, at length summoned up courage to open their gates, and the unfortunate Bassompierre was carried to an inn and put to bed. Here he lay for a fortnight between life and death, âstricken with a purple fever,â and it was only his iron constitution which eventually turned the scale in his favour. The crisis once passed, however, he mended rapidly, and in a few days was sufficiently recovered to continue his journey to La RÃ©ole, and thence to Bordeaux, where he arrived on December 15, to await the King.\n\nLouis XIII and the Constable had arrived at Monheurt on November 28, and had taken up their quarters at a village called Longuetille, about a league from the town. The place was taken on December 12; the lives of the inhabitants were spared, but the garrison was put to the sword, and the place pillaged and burned to the ground. Luynes, however, was not present to witness this sorry triumph. While the flames were devouring the {339} conquered town, he lay at Longuetille, in the grip of the same pestilential fever from which Bassompierre so narrowly escaped, and which was now ravaging the Royal army. The disasters of the campaign, and the unceasing anxiety as to the future to which he had been for some time a prey, had told upon his strength, and three days later he died, in his forty-fourth year. âHe was little regretted by the King,â says Bassompierre; âwhile his death was hailed with joy by the bulk of the nation, with whom he had long been intensely unpopular. Even the Ultramontane party, whose cause he had so well served, received the news with satisfaction.â They had been infuriated by the belief that he intended to make peace with the Huguenots, and ascribed the Montauban fiasco to the fact that the Almighty refused to make use of so unworthy an instrument for the destruction of the heretics. {340}\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nLuynes dead, who would govern the King and France? Such was the question which everyone was asking himself, for that Louis XIII, so jealous of his royal authority, yet too indolent to exercise it himself, would require someone to lean on was a foregone conclusion. There were many pretenders. There was Marie deâ Medici, who, now that the man who had estranged her son from her was no more, might hope to recover in time much of the influence she had once exercised over the King. And Marieâs triumph would mean that of Richelieu, who had now acquired so great an ascendancy over her that scandal asserted that he was her lover. There was the greedy and ambitious CondÃ©, who had learned prudence from adversity, but was in other respects but little changed. Luynes, in the last months of his âreign,â had separated CondÃ© from the King, and tricked Richelieu out of the cardinalâs hat which had been the secret condition of the prelateâs reconciliation with the favourite, addressing a formal demand for {341} it to Gregory XV, accompanied by a private request to his Holiness not to accord it. But now the lists were again open to them. Then there were the Ministers: the Cardinal de Retz, whom Luynes had made the nominal chief of the Council, and his ally Schomberg, Superintendent of Finance; the Chancellor Brulart de Sillery and his son Puisieux, the Minister for Foreign Affairs; and old Jeannin. And all these persons felt that they might have to reckon seriously with Bassompierre, in whose society the King undoubtedly took more pleasure than in that of any of them, and whom, they knew, the late Constable had regarded as his only dangerous rival.\n\nIt is certain that, had Bassompierre been so minded, he would have stood an excellent chance of succeeding to Luynesâs place as favourite, and that his elevation would have been well received, as he was exceedingly popular both at the Court and in the Army. But his epicurean wisdom rejected the idea of a life of gilded slavery; to be obliged to forgo the society of his âbeautiful mistresses,â in order to dance attendance upon his youthful sovereign and make up his mind for him a dozen times a day, was not at all an attractive prospect to one who infinitely preferred pleasure to grandeur; the royal favour, without the responsibilities of power, was sufficient for him.\n\nThe Cardinal de Retz, Schomberg and Puisieux had the advantage of being near the King at the time of the Constableâs death. The first two at once joined forces against Puisieux and âaspired to become all-powerful and to restrain the King from doing anything except on their advice.â They secured a decided success by persuading Louis XIII to bestow the vacant office of Keeper of the Seals upon De Vic, a counsellor of State, who was devoted to their interests, and then put their heads together to find a means of separating the King from Bassompierre, whom they regarded as a serious obstacle in the path of their ambition. Louis XIII {342} arrived at Bordeaux on December 21, and shortly afterwards the two Ministers proposed to him to leave Bassompierre in Guienne as lieutenant-general of that province, in place of the MarÃ©chal de Roquelaure, who was to be compensated for the loss of his post by a present of 200,000 livres and the government of Lectoure. Having obtained his Majestyâs consent to this arrangement, they sent RoucellaÃ¯ to sound Bassompierre on the matter and âeven offered to add to this charge that of marshal of France.â But Bassompierre preferred to wait upon events and to see into whose hands the management of affairs would fall, foreseeing that whoever might secure it would not be strong enough to maintain his position without support, and âbeing assured that he would be very pleased to have him for a friend, and to give him a larger share of the cake than they [Retz and Schomberg] were offering him.â\n\nâWhen the King spoke to me of the lieutenancy-general [of Guienne], I answered that I should esteem myself more happy to occupy the post of Colonel-General of the Swiss near his person than any other away from it; that I was only just recovering from a severe illness which demanded three monthsâ repose, and that during that time I desired no other employment than that of my first office of Colonel-General. And to this his Majesty agreed.â\n\nAlthough foiled in this attempt to get Bassompierre out of the way, Retz and Schomberg presently returned to the charge, and having persuaded the MarÃ©chal de ThÃ©mines to surrender the government of BÃ©arn, in exchange for the lieutenancy-general of Guienne, offered it to Bassompierre. The government of BÃ©arn, though, in the present circumstances, it could scarcely be regarded as a bed of roses, was a very honourable and lucrative post. But its acceptance would, of course, entail an almost complete separation from the King, and from—what was more important in Bassompierreâs estimation—the Court {343} and Paris; and he therefore returned the same answer as he had in the case of Guienne.\n\nA day or two later, Bassompierre had the satisfaction of inflicting a sharp reverse upon the two Ministers.\n\nThe Cardinal and Schomberg had urged the King to follow up the capture of Monheurt by the surprise of Castillon, on the Dordogne, which, they declared, could very easily be carried out and would have an excellent effect. Now, Castillon belonged to the Duc de Bouillon, who, at the outbreak of hostilities, had entered into a compact with Louis XIII, which stipulated that this and other towns within his jurisdiction should âremain in the service of the King, but without making war on those of the Religionâ; while the King, on his side, promised that they should in no way be interfered with. To seize Castillon therefore would be a direct breach of this agreement, and could only be defended on the ground that the townsfolk had sent assistance to the Huguenots, of which there was no evidence of any value. Nevertheless, Louis XIII allowed himself to be persuaded by the two Ministers to consent to this being done, provided that the rest of the Council did not oppose it. When, however, the project was laid before the Council, Bassompierre rose and denounced it in a vigorous speech, in which he declared that, if executed, it would be a âgreat stain on the Kingâs honour and reputation,â after which he proceeded to give his Majesty some very wholesome advice on the danger of breaking his royal word.\n\nâSire,â said he, âit is easy for a man to deceive a person who trusts him, but it is not easy to deceive a second time. A promise badly observed only once deprives him who breaks it of the trust of the whole world.â And he stigmatized the counsel which had been given the King, of the source of which he pretended ignorance, as âinterested, evil-intentioned and rash,â which, if followed, would probably result in driving Bouillon into rebellion, and with him numbers of {344} Protestants who had hitherto remained neutral, since they would feel that it was impossible to trust the word of the King.\n\nOne or two other members of the Council signified their agreement with the views expressed by Bassompierre, upon which the King announced that he had come to the same conclusion, to the great discomfiture of Retz and Schomberg, who were forced to recognise that their design of governing the young monarch was likely to prove a much more difficult task than they had bargained for.\n\nLouis XIII left Bordeaux on the last day of the year, and travelled by easy stages towards Paris. At ChÃ¢teau-neuf-sur-Charente, where he arrived on January 6, 1622, another pretender to Luynesâs shoes appeared upon the scene, in the person of CondÃ©.\n\nIn order to ascertain the state of the Court, CondÃ© addressed himself to the AbbÃ© RoucellaÃ¯, an adroit and insinuating personage, who had been in turn the protÃ©gÃ© of Concini, the Queen-Mother and Luynes, and who, now that the Constable was dead, had decided to seek a new patron in Monsieur le Prince. The abbÃ© told him that there were two parties at the Court. On one side, were the three Ministers, Retz, Schomberg and the new Keeper of {345} the Seals, De Vic, âwho desired to possess the Kingâs mind to the exclusion of everyone elseâ; on the other, the three marshals of France, Praslin, Chaulnes, and CrÃ©quy[2] and some others, who were resolved not to submit to this. He added that the King conversed frequently with Bassompierre and appeared to have a rather high opinion of him, and that, if the latter had any ambition to succeed to the favour of the late Constable, it might very well be realised. That, however, did not seem to be his desire, âalthough he was disposed to accept the share in the Kingâs good graces which his services might merit.â Bassompierre and the Ministers, he told the prince, were ânot always of the same opinion,â and only a few days before he had spoken very bitterly against them before his Majesty in a council. CondÃ© then inquired if Bassompierre were in favour of continuing the war against the Huguenots, and RoucellaÃ¯ answered that he had pressed Luynes to enter into negotiations with Rohan, from fear that the Royal army would be obliged to raise the siege of Montauban. As a result of this conversation, the prince sent RoucellaÃ¯ to Bassompierre to inform him that he wished to speak to him and ascertain his views in regard to the war.\n\nBefore seeing Bassompierre, however, CondÃ© had an interview with the Ministers, whom he found in warlike mood, not because they believed that any useful purpose could be served by a continuance of this fratricidal strife, but for the same selfish reasons as he himself desired it, namely, âto keep the King so far as possible from Paris, in order the better to govern him.â He then approached CrÃ©quy, who answered that he was in favour of peace, provided that it could be obtained on advantageous and honourable terms. Bassompierre gave him a similar reply, when he spoke to him on the matter, and added that he would find Praslin and all other good servants of {346} the King of the same opinion. âIt is singular,â said the prince; âall you men of war, who ought to desire it, and can only make your way by means of it, want peace; and the lawyers and statesmen demand war.â âI answered,â says Bassompierre, âthat I desired war, and that it ought to bring me fortune and advancement, but only on condition that it was for the service of the King and the good of the State; and that otherwise I should esteem myself a bad servant of the King and a bad Frenchman, if, for my own private advantage, I were to desire a thing which must cause both so much evil and prejudice.â\n\nAfter this sharp, if indirect, rebuke, CondÃ© left him and told RoucellaÃ¯ that, after sounding CrÃ©quy and Bassompierre, he found that he was likely to have more in common with the Ministers than with them.\n\nDuring the remainder of the journey to Paris, skirmishes between the rival parties were of frequent occurrence, each doing everything possible to prejudice the King against the other. At SauzÃ©, where the Court arrived on the 10th, Bassompierre again scored at the expense of the Ministers.\n\nLouis XIII was about to sit down to cards with Bassompierre and Praslin, when the three Ministers were announced.\n\n{347}\n\nThe Ministers soon ascertained whom they had to thank for the very mortifying rebuff which they had received from the King, and were more incensed than ever against Bassompierre. The latter, who had been on very friendly terms with the Cardinal de Retz until his Eminenceâs designs upon the King had brought their interests into collision, went to see him the next day and assured him that, so far as he himself was concerned, he was still his very humble servant. But he told him that he had no love for his colleagues, Schomberg and De Vic, and wished them to know it. The Cardinal begged him to be reconciled with them, but within forty-eight hours two incidents occurred which removed all hope of this.\n\nIt happened that, the following evening, news arrived that the MarÃ©chal de Roquelaure was dangerously ill and that his recovery was considered hopeless. âUpon which,â says Bassompierre, âthese gentlemen [the three Ministers] and Monsieur le Prince went in a body to the King to demand the charge of marshal of France, which he [Roquelaure] had, for M. de Schomberg. The only answer which the King made them was to say: âAnd Bassompierre—what shall he become?â This crude reply deeply affected M. de Schomberg, and from that day we ceased to speak to one another.â[3]\n\nThe second incident, which followed closely upon the first, served to embitter still further the relations between these two gentlemen. {349}\n\nThe King did not accept Bassompierreâs proposal to confront him with his accusers; but he sent for two valets of his wardrobe, who had been present during the conversation between him and CrÃ©quy, and questioned them in his presence. They confirmed what Bassompierre had just told him, and his Majesty expressed himself satisfied that he had spoken the truth.\n\nThis clumsy attempt to injure Bassompierre recoiled upon its authors in a manner that was distinctly embarrassing for them. A few days later, when the King was at ChÃ¢tellerault, the Ministers proposed that he should travel on the following day only so far as La Haye-Descartes, on the right bank of the Creuse, a very short dayâs journey. Louis, however, announced his intention of going on to Sainte-Maure, adding significantly that it seemed to him that, if they could have their way, he would not reach Paris for three months.\n\nThese squabbles between the jealous and spiteful courtiers and Ministers who surrounded Louis XIII, to all appearance so trifling, were in reality of great political importance. For they were all manÅuvres in the struggle to dominate the indolent and fickle mind, and, with it, the policy, of this young monarch, who, while so punctilious in exacting all the respect which he considered due to his royal dignity, was ready to surrender the sovereign authority to the favourite of the moment. And {351} upon the result of that struggle hung the destinies, not only of France, but of Europe.\n\nOn January 27, Louis XIII arrived in Paris, where Marie deâ Medici was awaiting him. The meeting between them was most affectionate. Marie expressed the greatest joy at seeing her son return to his capital so well in health and now indeed the master; and the King replied that he intended to prove to everyone that never did son love or honour his mother more. Marie believed him too easily. Louis XIII was twenty-one and not nearly so manageable as he had been as a lad; and he feared the authoritative temper of Richelieu, of whom the Nuncio Corsini wrote to Gregory XV that he was âof a character to tyrannise over both the King and his mother.â Besides, to re-establish her influence over her son it was necessary for the Queen-Mother to keep him near her, and circumstances were to render this impossible.\n\nNotwithstanding that the country was rent by civil war, and that so many distinguished families were in mourning for relatives fallen before Montauban, the winter in Paris seems to have been as gay as ever. âThe Court was very beautiful, and the ladies also,â says Bassompierre, âand during the Carnival several fine comedies and grand ballets were performed.â In the middle of March, however, a most unfortunate incident occurred, which cast a gloom over both Court and capital.\n\nEarly in 1622, to the great joy of the nation, the Queen had been declared pregnant. Prayers were offered up in all the churches in France for her safe delivery, and all those about her Majestyâs person were strictly enjoined not to allow her to exert herself, to which instructions, however, they unfortunately appear to have paid but little heed. One evening, Anne of Austria and a party of courtiers, amongst whom were the widowed Duchesse de Luynes and Mlle. de Verneuil, went to spend the evening with the Princesse de CondÃ©, who was ill and confined to {352} her bed. On their way back to the Queenâs apartments, they were passing through the grande salle of the Louvre, when Madame de Luynes and Mlle. de Verneuil seized their royal mistress by the arms and began to run. They had not, however, gone many paces when the Queen tripped and fell on her face. A few hours later, to the general dismay, it was known that her Majesty had had a miscarriage.\n\nLouis XIII was furiously indignant, as well he might be, and wrote to the two delinquents with his own hand, ordering them to retire from Court. It is probable that the disgrace of Madame la ConnÃ©table, against whom, as we know, his Majesty already had a grievance, might have lasted some considerable time, had not her marriage with the Duc de Chevreuse, who stood high in the Kingâs favour, paved the way for her return. {353}\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nQuestion of the Huguenot War the principal subject of contention between the two parties—CondÃ© and the Ministers demand its continuance—Marie deâ Medici, prompted by Richelieu, advocates peace—Secret negotiations of Louis XIII with the Huguenot leaders—Soubiseâs offensive in the West obliges the King to continue the war—Louis XIII advances against the Huguenot chief, who has established himself in the Ãle de RiÃ©—CondÃ© accuses Bassompierre of âdesiring to prevent him from acquiring gloryâ—Courage of the King—Passage of the Royal army from the Ãle du Perrier to the Ãle de RiÃ©—Total defeat of Soubise—Siege of Royan—The King in the trenches—His remarkable coolness and intrepidity under fire—Capitulation of Royan—The Marquis de la Force created a marshal of France—Conversation between Louis XIII and Bassompierre—Diplomatic speech of the latter.\n\nMeantime, the struggle between the two parties, which had begun on the journey from Bordeaux to Paris, continued at the Louvre. CondÃ© and his allies were unable to prevent the Queen-Mother from entering the Council, but they succeeded in excluding the man who possessed her mind. Richelieu spoke through her mouth, however, and those who remembered her regency were astonished at the prudence, address, and firmness which she now displayed.\n\nThe war against the Huguenots was the principal subject of contention. Marie deâ Medici, under the influence of Richelieu, the old Ministers the Chancellor Sillery and Jeannin, Puisieux, and the generals, wished for peace; CondÃ© and the new Ministers demanded the continuance of the war. CondÃ© saw in the war the means of separating the King from his mother, and commanding the army in the name of Louis XIII. A superstitious hope made him particularly anxious to have large military forces at his disposal. An astrologer had predicted to him that he would become King at the age of thirty-four, and {354} he was now in his thirty-fourth year. He desired, therefore, to prove his devotion to the Catholic religion, and to be in a position to seize the crown at the date when Louis XIII and his younger brother were apparently destined to die.\n\nMarie brought to the Council the arguments with which Richelieu had furnished her on the grave situation of external affairs. The House of Austria, she pointed out, was everywhere aggressive and everywhere successful. In Germany, the Empire had reduced Bohemia to submission. The unfortunate Elector Palatine, deprived of the Upper Palatinate by Maximilian of Bavaria, and of the Lower Palatinate by Tilly, General of the Catholic League, and Gonzalvo de Cordoba, commander of the Spanish forces, had been obliged to take refuge in Holland. Philip IV, on the expiration of the twelve yearsâ truce with Holland in 1621, had called upon the Dutch to acknowledge his supremacy, and, on their refusal, had attacked them. The Spaniards mocked at the Treaty of Madrid, and, so far from evacuating the Valtellina, as they had engaged to do, had invaded the country of the Grisons, in concert with the Archduke Leopold, and obliged them to submit to a humiliating treaty which deprived them of the suzerainty of the Valtellina.\n\nPrompted by Richelieu, Marie urged upon the Council the imperative necessity of pacifying France, in order to be in a position to intervene in the affairs of Europe and arrest the alarming progress which the House of Austria was making. âTo enter into a civil war,â said she, âis not the road to arrive at it, as was manifest during the siege of Montauban, when, in place of executing the Treaty of Madrid, they [the Spaniards] pushed their armies further and advanced by much their design to arrive at the monarchy of Europe. Although assuredly it is better to perish rather than abate anything of the royal dignity, it seems that it [the dignity] is preserved, if peace and the pardon of their crimes is given to them [the {355} Huguenots], without restoring to them any of the places of which they have been deprived.â\n\nCondÃ© and his allies pretended, on the contrary, that it was necessary before everything, and at all costs, to subdue the internal enemy and to check the audacity of the Huguenots, immensely encouraged by the successful resistance of Montauban. La Force and his sons had resumed hostilities in Guienne, and many places in that province which had submitted to the King had revolted anew. In Lower Languedoc, masters of NÃ®mes, Montpellier, UzÃ¨s, Privas, and a number of smaller towns, the assembly of the âcircle,â had ordered or, at any rate, authorised, the most disgraceful excesses, and between thirty and forty churches, amongst which were some of the finest monuments of the Middle Ages, had been ruined. In the West, the Rochellois were masters of the sea; Saint-Luc, who had vainly endeavoured to make head against them, was blockaded in the port of Brouage; and a multitude of privateers preyed upon the commerce of the Atlantic coast.\n\nAt the beginning of 1622, the Rochellois and the predatory nobles who made common cause with them conceived the bold project of occupying the mouths of the Loire and the Gironde, in order to hold all the commerce of those two rivers to ransom. The revolt of Royan, on the right bank of the Gironde, and the occupation of two other strong points had already resulted in the virtual blockade of that river; while Soubise, violating the oath which he had taken at the capitulation of Saint-Jean-dâAngÃ©ly not to bear arms again against his sovereign, charged himself with the Loire, descended with a considerable force on Sables dâOlonne, in order to raise the Protestants of Poitou, and overran all the country up to the suburbs of Nantes.\n\nThus tricked by the Spaniards and braved by the Protestants, Louis XIII had to choose between his enemies. For a time he appeared inclined to listen to {356} the advice of his mother—or rather of Richelieu—and, unknown to CondÃ© and his supporters, authorised LesdiguiÃ¨res to negotiate with Rohan. âAnd that nothing might be revealed,â says Bassompierre, âsave to M. de Puisieux and myself, whom he commanded to keep the affair very secret, he wished that M. des LesdiguiÃ¨res sent duplicate despatches; one copy to be read and deliberated upon in the Council; the other, which was private and addressed to M. de Puisieux, to be communicated only to the King, who informed me of its contents.â The negotiations progressed so far that Louis promised to receive a deputation from the Reformed churches, and threatened the Spanish Ambassador to go to Lyons and organise an army to march to the assistance of the Grisons, if Spain did not forthwith withdraw from their country and the Valtellina. But the progress of Soubise and the disobedience of dâÃpernon, who declined to send troops from his governments of Saintonge and the Angoumois to the assistance of the hard-pressed Royalists of Poitou, gave the victory to CondÃ© and his adherents; the King decided to march in person against Soubise, and, on March 20, without waiting for the arrival of the Protestant deputies, he left Paris for OrlÃ©ans, accompanied by the Queen-Mother, who was determined to keep within reach of him so long as she could.\n\nFrom OrlÃ©ans, the King, still accompanied by Marie, proceeded to Blois, and thence by water to Nantes, where the army was to assemble, and where on the 11th he was joined by Bassompierre, who had been summoned by courier from Paris.\n\nOn his arrival at Nantes, Louis XIII learned that Soubise was endeavouring to establish himself in the Ãle de RiÃ©, a maritime district of Lower Poitou, separated from the mainland by vast salt marshes and small rivers, which at high tide the sea rendered impassable. If the Huguenot leader were permitted to entrench himself there, it was a position from which it would be exceedingly {357} difficult to dislodge him; but this the King resolved not to allow him time to do; and, leaving the Queen-Mother, who had fallen ill, at Nantes, like a true son of Henri IV, he marched at once upon the enemy.\n\nThe Royal army consisted of from 10,000 to 12,000 men; that of Soubise from 6,000 to 7,000; but the latter had the advantage of position and seven pieces of cannon; while the attacking force was, of course, unable to transport its artillery across the marshes. The enterprise would therefore have been a hazardous one, with a watchful and resolute enemy to contend with. On this occasion, however, Soubise showed neither the vigilance of a general nor the courage of a soldier. The approach of the enemy much sooner than he had foreseen appears to have disconcerted his plans altogether, and, instead of attempting to defend the approaches to the Ãle de RiÃ©, he thought only of re-embarking his troops in a squadron of vessels which he had at his disposal, and making his escape with the plunder he had collected to La Rochelle.\n\nIn the afternoon of April 14, Marillac, with a small force of infantry, occupied the Ãle du Perrier, adjoining the Ãle de RiÃ©, and early on the following morning Bassompierre was ordered by CondÃ© to follow with the rest of the infantry. CondÃ© then proposed that they should ford an arm of the sea âwide as the Marne,â which separated the islands of Perrier and RiÃ©, and where at low tide, which would be at midday, the peasants had told him, the water would be only waist-deep. Bassompierre, however, protested against this, pointing out that, if the enemy offered the least opposition to their passage, the tide would rise before half the troops had crossed, and even if they were allowed to cross unopposed, they would find themselves at a great disadvantage without cavalry or cannon. He added that, apart from these considerations, he ought certainly to await the arrival of the King. âFor if you defeat M. de Soubise,â said he, âhe [the King] will {358} take it ill that you have not shared the honour of the victory with him; and, if some reverse befalls you, he will blame your precipitation, and will accuse you of not having wished or deigned to wait for him.â\n\nMonsieur le Prince took this remonstrance in very bad part, and declared that he saw plainly that Bassompierre was âof the cabal who desired to prevent him from acquiring glory.â But he sent him to the King to beg him to come at once with the cavalry, and when his Majesty arrived on the scene, it was decided to wait until midnight and to cross to the Ãle de RiÃ© at another spot, where they were informed there would be less water.\n\nIn the course of the evening, Louis XIII displayed for the first time that cool courage which he invariably afterwards showed in war, and which, if it had been combined with the same degree of moral resolution, would have made him a really remarkable man:—\n\nAll the arrangements for the passage of the army had been entrusted to Bassompierre. The troops assembled at ten oâclock, and a little before midnight the order to advance was given. At the spot where the Guards were to cross, however, the water was so deep that they sent to inform Bassompierre that it was impossible to pass. He went there, and finding that it would be a very difficult undertaking, led them to another ford, by which he crossed himself to the Ãle de RiÃ©, and saw no sign of any enemy. He returned and reported that the ford was practicable and that their passage would be unopposed, and the whole army passed without mishap; though when Bassompierre crossed for the second time, at the head of the rearguard, the tide was beginning to rise, and the water was nearly up to his chin.[5]\n\nOn reaching the shore, the troops encamped and lighted a great number of fires to dry their clothes. At daybreak they were formed in order of battle, and, after a march of about two leagues, came in sight of the enemy. Soubise and his cavalry, to the number of five or six hundred, fled at once in the direction of La Rochelle, without striking a blow. Part of the infantry had already embarked in the launches that had arrived to take them off; the rest threw down their arms and demanded quarter. But this was refused to the majority of them, and more than 1,500 were shot or cut down in cold blood; while as many more were taken prisoners and sent to the galleys. The rest fled across the marshes, in which some of them were drowned, while many others were slain by the troops of La Rochefoucauld, governor of Poitou, or by the peasants, furious at the devastation which the {360} Huguenots had committed. Only some four hundred succeeded in effecting their escape and making their way to La Rochelle.\n\nLeaving a force under the Comte de Soissons to watch La Rochelle on the land side, while Guise was directed to blockade it by sea, Louis XIII marched southwards, with the intention of raising the blockade of the Gironde by the reduction of Royan. During the siege, the King gave further proofs of that courage and presence of mind which Bassompierre had admired before the attack on the Ãle de RiÃ©.\n\nIt is not the degree, but the kind of courage, which is remarkable at his age. Bassompierre, however, relates an instance of equal coolness in a boy, who had not the same strong motive to self-possession as was furnished by the consciousness of being the object of the whole armyâs attention:\n\nâThe enemy had constructed a barricade in their fosse, on the side of the sea, and a palisade, which hindered us from being entirely masters of their fosse. I sent my volunteer, a young lad of sixteen, to reconnoitre it. This lad had, the previous year, executed with other camp-boys the most hazardous works at the siege of Montauban, which the soldiers refused to undertake. He had received several wounds, amongst others a musket-ball through the body, of which I got him cured. This young rogue undertook a number of dangerous works by the piece, and the camp-boys worked under him and made a great deal of money. He went to reconnoitre this barricade with the same bearing and as much boldness as the best sergeant in the army; and after getting a musket-ball through his breeches and another through the brim of his hat, returned to us and made his report, which was very judicious.â\n\nRoyan capitulated on May 11, and shortly afterwards La Force surrendered the town of Sainte-Foy and returned to his allegiance, in return for the bÃ¢ton of Marshal of France. Louis XIII, who had been given to understand that both Bassompierre and Schomberg were deeply mortified that a rebel should have been created a marshal before either of them, sent for the former and said to him: âBassompierre, I know that you are angry that I am making M. de La Force Marshal of France, and {362} that you and M. de Schomberg complain of it, and with reason; but it is not I who am the cause of it, so much as Monsieur le Prince, who counselled me to do it, for the good of my affairs, and in order to leave nothing behind me in Guienne which might prevent me passing promptly into Languedoc. Nevertheless, be sure that what you desire I shall do for you, whom I love and hold as my good and faithful servant.â\n\nBassompierre tells us that at that time he had no particular desire for the office of marshal, âsince, in his opinion, it was that of an old man, while he wished to play the part of a gallant of the Court for some years longer.â He therefore assured his Majesty that he had been entirely misinformed, and that, so far from being annoyed at La Forceâs appointment, he regarded it as a most proper one, since he was an old man and a soldier of great experience, who had been promised the bÃ¢ton by the late King and would have received it, if Henri IV had lived another month; that, although he had been a rebel, he was one no longer; and that it was âa signal example of the kindness of the King to forget the faults of his servants, in order to remember and recompense their merits and their services.â And he added that he did not aspire to the office of marshal or any other charge, unless his Majesty âout of pure kindness and desire to recognise his service,â wished to confer it upon him, and that he âvery humbly besought him never to allow any consideration for him to prevent him doing what he judged to be for the good of his service.â\n\nThis diplomatic speech greatly pleased the King, who thanked Bassompierre and told him that he might rely on him to advance his interests. He then sent for Schomberg, who, much less tactful than his colleague, pressed his Majesty to make him a marshal conjointly with La Force, and proposed that Bassompierre should be created one also, âthough this was chiefly in order to strengthen his own request.â {363}\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nAt Moissac, where Louis XIII arrived in the first week in June, CondÃ© approached Bassompierre and invited him to meet him âin a kind of chapel which is in the cloister of the abbey,â as he desired to confer with him on a matter of great importance. Thither Bassompierre repaired and found the prince in the company of his allies, Retz and Schomberg. All three forthwith began to inveigh against Puisieux, whose presumption, they declared, they were no longer able to endure. Although only a Secretary of State, he was admitted to greater intimacy with the King than Monsieur le Prince himself, sought to prejudice his Majesty against those with whom he was not on good terms, conducted separate negotiations, which he declined to communicate to them, and prevented the execution of the decisions of the Council, if he had not previously approved of them. Since the death of the late Constable, they had, they said, endeavoured âto prevent the King from embarking in a new affection,â and they {364} were of opinion that it would be better for his Majesty to have no favourite.\n\nâHowever, since they saw that his inclination was to be dominated by someone, they preferred that it should be by a brave man, of high birth and esteemed for his knowledge of the arts of peace as well as of those of war, rather than by a man of the pen like M. de Puisieux, who would turn everything upside down; and that they were all resolved to conspire to bring about his ruin, as they were to assist in the aggrandisement of my fortune, and to persuade the King, who was already favourably inclined towards me, to favour me entirely with the honour of his good graces, provided that I were willing to promise them two things: the one, to co-operate with them to ruin M. de Puisieux and to detach myself entirely from his friendship; the other, to associate myself entirely with them and combine our designs and counsels, in the first place, for the good of the Kingâs service, in the second, for our common interest and preservation. And they begged me to come to a prompt decision upon this matter and to acquaint them with it.â\n\nBassompierre felt quite certain that the proposal which had just been made to him was nothing but a skilfully-baited trap, and that the intention of CondÃ© and his friends was âto penetrate his design and then to reveal it to the King, and that they desired to make use of him to ruin M. de Puisieux, and afterwards with greater facility to ruin him.â\n\nAs for their complaints about Puisieux, he said, it seemed to him that they were really complaining of the King and questioning his Majestyâs right to confer privately with, and demand advice from, whichever of his Ministers he pleased. Puisieux was his [Bassompierreâs] friend, and had always behaved as such, and, so long as he continued to do so, he declined to be a party to any intrigue against him.\n\nCondÃ© then warned Bassompierre that a time might come when he would regret having lost his friendship and that of his allies in order to preserve that of Puisieux; to which Bassompierre replied that he would be âextraordinarily grieved to lose their good graces, but that the consolation would remain to him of not having lost them through any fault of his own, and that he would never purchase those of anyone at the price of his reputation.â\n\nThat evening, Louis XIII decided to send a body of two hundred cavalry to scout in the direction of Montauban, and ValenÃ§ay, who was lieutenant of CondÃ©âs company of gensdarmes, asked to be allowed to go, and to take with him both his own men and Monsieur le Princeâs company of light horse; and to this the King consented. CondÃ© was not at the council of war, and did {366} not learn of what had been done until later in the evening, when he was extremely angry and went to the King to complain that an affront had been put upon him by sending his two companies of horse away without his knowledge, and that he felt quite certain that it was Bassompierre who had suggested it. The King assured him that Bassompierre had had nothing to do with the affair, and that ValenÃ§ay had himself asked for the commission, which he had given him, never imagining that Monsieur le Prince would take it ill. CondÃ©, however, insisted that Bassompierre must have been at the bottom of it, and declared that he was hostile to him. When he had gone, the King sent for Bassompierre and told him of what the prince had said, upon which he deemed it advisable to inform his Majesty of the proposal which CondÃ© had made him that morning in the chapel. âBut,â he says, âas it is very dangerous to be in the disfavour of a person of that rank who is your general, I begged the King very humbly either to reconcile us or to permit me to retire, since I did not wish to draw his hatred and his anger upon me.â\n\nThis the King promised to do, and the next evening, when the army had encamped at Villemode, near Montauban, he came into the camp, and having praised Bassompierre for the arrangements which he had made, he turned to CondÃ© and said: âMonsieur, yesterday you were angry with him without cause, and you can learn from ValenÃ§ay whether Bassompierre was in any way responsible for his being sent away. I beg you, for love of me, to live on good terms with him, for I assure you he is your servant; and, if he were lost to this army, you know yourself whether it would be our fault.â CondÃ© promised to do as the King desired, and the same evening offered his apologies to Bassompierre, who begged him to regard him as his very humble servant, and that âwhen he happened to have any reason to be displeased with him, to do him the honour of telling him of it, and, if he did not give him {367} satisfaction in the matter, to be angry with him with all his soul, and not before.â\n\nOn the following day—June 8—the army arrived before NÃ©grepelisse, a little town on the left bank of the Aveyron. Louis XIII and his whole army were bitterly incensed against the inhabitants of NÃ©grepelisse, who, one night during the previous winter, had revolted and massacred four hundred men of the Vaillac Regiment who had been placed in garrison there; while a report was current among the soldiers that, during the siege of Montauban, the sick and wounded of the Royal army who had been transported thither had been poisoned. However, as the town was believed to have returned to its allegiance, provided they admitted the King, there would not appear to have been any intention of punishing the inhabitants. But when the quartermaster who had been charged to select suitable quarters for his Majesty, approached the gates, he found them closed, and was received with a volley of musket-shots.\n\nOn learning of what had occurred, the King ordered Bassompierre, who was with the advance-guard, to invest the town, which he proceeded to do; but, on going forward to reconnoitre the place with Praslin and Chevreuse, he had a narrow escape of his life, being fired upon from a distance of twenty paces by a party of the enemy, whom he had mistaken for some of his own men.\n\nâThere was not in NÃ©grepelisse,â says Bassompierre, âanything better than a musket; no munitions of war save what each inhabitant might have had to go out shooting; no foreign soldier, no chief to command them; and the place, though it might have offered some resistance to a provincial force, was quite incapable of resisting a Royal army. Nevertheless, the inhabitants would neither consent to surrender nor even to parley.â\n\nThe probable explanation is that the townsfolk were convinced that the King was bent upon their destruction, and that no terms which he might consent to give them {368} would be observed; and that they had therefore determined to sell their lives for what they might be worth.\n\nOn the 9th, a battery of seven cannon was got into position close to the walls, and, although the enemyâs musketry-fire was very effective, and caused many casualties amongst the gunners, by the following morning a considerable breach had been made. The besieged endeavoured to repair it by a barricade of carts, but this was of little avail, and the town was quickly taken by assault.\n\nLouis XIII, infuriated by the obstinacy of the inhabitants, had given orders that they were to be treated as they had treated his soldiers some months before, and every man capable of bearing arms was put to the sword, with the exception of a few who succeeded in escaping into the chÃ¢teau. The troops exceeded the pitiless orders of the King, and the majority of the women were violated and many murdered, together with their children; while the town was pillaged and burned almost to the ground. The officers appear to have done their best to protect the women and to save the town; but, as so often happened in those days when places were taken by assault, the soldiers were quite out of hand, and it was impossible to restrain them.[6] The chÃ¢teau held out until the following {369} day, when it surrendered at discretion, and twelve or fifteen of those found there were taken and hanged.\n\nThe reconciliation between Bassompierre and CondÃ© was of very short duration, for, a day or two later, the prince accused him in a council of war of questioning the orders which were given him. Bassompierre retorted that he had a right to his opinion, and that âif his mouth were to be closed, he should retire from the Service. The King thereupon took his part, and was very angry with Monsieur le Prince.â Further differences arose between them respecting the investment of Saint-Antonin, and, as CondÃ© refused to be guided by his advice, Bassompierre begged to be permitted not to serve during the siege, and his request was granted.\n\nMarillac was then appointed to the temporary command of Bassompierreâs troops; but the officers of the Guards refused to take their orders from him, as did those of the Navarre Regiment. CondÃ© was furious and, going to the King, accused Bassompierre of âmaking cabals and mutinies in his army,â and said that he âdeserved punishment and even death.â And that gentleman happening to enter the royal presence a few moments later, he denounced him to his face. Bassompierre denied the charge, and said that the refusal of the officers of the Guards and of Navarre to serve under Marillac was not due to any action on his part, but to the poor opinion they entertained of Marillacâs military capabilities, and that if some other officer were appointed, they would obey him readily enough. With this explanation Louis XIII professed himself satisfied, and Monsieur le Prince retired discomfited.\n\nIf we are to believe Bassompierre, CondÃ© would appear to have bungled the siege of Saint-Antonin pretty badly, and an imprudent attempt to take the place by assault was repulsed with heavy loss. However, on June 22 the town surrendered.\n\nA few days later, Bassompierre and the prince again {370} came into collision. CondÃ© had proposed in the Council to attack Carmain, a nest of Huguenots which was a great annoyance to the people of Toulouse, who had petitioned that its reduction should be undertaken;[7] but Bassompierre objected that to conquer these small places was to waste time which might be more usefully employed in besieging important strongholds of the enemy like NÃ®mes and Montpellier. It was decided to follow his advice, whereat âMonsieur le Princeâs bile was stirred against him,â and he left the Council in anger, complaining loudly that Bassompierre had prevented Carmain from being invested. Some Huguenot gentlemen happening to overhear him, sent to inform the authorities of that town that the Royal army had no intention of laying siege to it, in consequence of which a body of 500 men who were on their way from Puylaurens to reinforce the garrison received orders to return. Bassompierre, who had been ordered to lead the army to Castelnaudary, while the King and CondÃ© went to visit Toulouse, learned of the return of this reinforcement, and aware that, deprived of its assistance, the people of Carmain would probably consider themselves incapable of withstanding a siege, determined to make an attempt to trick them into surrender. He accordingly appeared before the town, with all the paraphernalia for a siege: carts loaded with gabions, platforms for the batteries, and so forth, although he, of course, had no intention of undertaking it, since he had not received any orders to that effect, and, besides, had only two siege-guns with him. He then summoned it to surrender, vowing to make a terrible example of it in the event of a refusal, and to treat it as NÃ©grepelisse had been treated; and the inhabitants, completely deceived, offered to parley forthwith, and early on the following {371} morning, terms of capitulation having been arranged, the place surrendered (June 30).\n\nThe previous night part of the Piedmont Regiment, which Bassompierre had detached against the neighbouring town of Cuq-Toulza, had carried that place by assault, after blowing in the gate with a petard. So that within a few hours two towns had been taken, one of them without a blow being struck.\n\nNot a little elated by this double success, Bassompierre placed the army in charge of ValenÃ§ay, and repaired to Toulouse to report to the King.\n\nBassompierre returned to the army accompanied by Praslin, who took over the command. The following day he met with what might have been a very severe accident, his horse stumbling and falling into a ditch on top of him. {372} However, he escaped with nothing worse than a badly bruised foot. On July 2, the army reached Castelnaudary, having snapped up the little town of Le Mas-Saintes-Puelles on the way, and on the 5th the King joined it. His Majesty was unwell, suffering, says his physician HÃ©rouard, from âsore throat, a cold, and a relaxed uvula,â and he remained for some days at Castelnaudary and kept Bassompierre with him; while the army under Praslin continued its march into Lower Languedoc.\n\nMeantime, LesdiguiÃ¨res, to whom, after the death of Luynes, Louis XIII had promised the office of Constable, provided he would renounce the Reformed faith, had sent to inform the King that he was about to be received into the Catholic Church. His elevation would entail a vacancy among the marshals, and the King sent for Bassompierre and Schomberg, who had also remained at Castelnaudary, and told them that, so soon as another occurred, he would create them both marshals, but that he did not wish to promote one before the other, as he considered that their claims were equal. Schomberg, however, pressed the King to promote both Bassompierre and himself forthwith, pointing out that they could render him more useful service as marshals of France in the approaching campaign in Lower Languedoc, and that when there was another vacancy, his Majesty could leave it unfilled, which would come to the same thing.\n\nPerceiving that the King seemed very reluctant to take this course, though, at the same time, he was unwilling to refuse so pressing a request, Bassompierre, like a true courtier, came to his aid, and declared that, as he had âalways preferred to deserve great honours than to possess them,â he was not so eager for the bÃ¢ton as Schomberg, and would âwithout envy or regretâ resign his claims in favour of one who was six years his senior, and one of his Majestyâs Ministers, and therefore entitled to the preference. âM. de Schomberg,â {373} says he, âfeeling that my courtesy had placed him under a great obligation, thanked me very gracefully; but the King persisted in refusing to promote one of us without the other; and so we withdrew.â\n\nOn July 13, Louis XIII left Castelnaudary and proceeded, by way of Carcassonne and Narbonne, to BÃ©ziers, where he remained for some little time. Bassompierre, however, rejoined the army, which was advancing slowly towards Montpellier, and which, on August 2, laid siege simultaneously to the towns of Lunel and Marsillargues, situated about a league from one another. Marsillargues surrendered almost at once, and Lunel a few days later, the garrison of the latter place, by the terms of the capitulation, being permitted to march out with their swords only; their other weapons were to be placed in the carts which carried their baggage.\n\nBassompierre had received orders to enter the town with the Guards the moment the garrison evacuated it. On his way thither, he saw great numbers of disbanded soldiers of different regiments, landsknechts and Swiss as well as French, lingering about, and felt sure that their presence boded no good, and that they were meditating an attack upon the baggage. He accordingly decided not to allow the garrison to leave until he had ridden back to the Royal camp to warn Praslin, whom he advised to take measures to prevent any such attempt. But the marshal replied that âhe was not a child, and that he understood his business, and that if he [Bassompierre] would only give the necessary orders within the town, he would do the same without.â\n\nBassompierre returned to the town and directed the garrison to march out with their baggage, after which he entered with his troops, and gave orders that the gates should be closed and the breach which the besiegersâ cannon had made strongly guarded, as he thought it not improbable that an attempt might be made to enter and pillage the place. {374}\n\nâThere was some degree of order in the departure of the enemy,â he says, âuntil the baggage came in sight; but, when that appeared, all the disbanded soldiers of our army rushed upon it, before it was possible for the marshal or Portes or Marillac to prevent them, and plundered these poor soldiers, 400 of whom they inhumanly butchered.â\n\nBassompierre, however, had the satisfaction of executing rigorous justice upon some of these ruffians:—\n\nTwo or three days after the Royal troops had taken possession of Lunel, the town narrowly escaped being destroyed, with everyone within its walls.\n\nBassompierre was at dinner with CrÃ©quy, Schomberg, and the Duc de Montmorency when there was a violent explosion, which partially wrecked the room in which they sat, though, happily, they were unhurt. They ran out to ascertain the cause, and learned that one of a train of ammunition-waggons which was entering the town had caught fire, and that the flames had reached the powder, with the result that several houses had been destroyed and others were blazing furiously. The utmost consternation prevailed, for the explosion had {375} occurred near the gate by which the waggons had entered, and the dÃ©bris of the houses barred the approach to it, while the other gates had been blocked up by CondÃ©âs orders; and the fire was rapidly approaching a convent, in the vaults of which a great quantity of powder was stored. If once it reached it, the whole town would be consumed, with all the troops and inhabitants.\n\nâThe confusion was extreme,â says Bassompierre, âand, as everyone was thinking only of himself and his own safety, no one ran to extinguish the fire; all the people sought only to get out of the town, but no one could find a way. At length, I caused one of the blocked-up gates to be broken open, through which everyone could get out, and, having by this expedient got more elbow-room, we removed our powder to a safe place and extinguished the fire, by which more than fifty persons had perished.â\n\nThe following day Bassompierre went with a body of 500 cavalry to Villeneuve-de-Maguelonne to escort the King to Lunel, where his Majesty arrived on August 15. On the 17th, Louis XIII went to visit SommiÃ¨res, which had just surrendered to his troops, and on the return journey Schomberg, whose jealousy of Bassompierre was increasing daily, finding an opportunity for private conversation with his sovereign, did not fail to turn it to account:\n\nâOn the road M. de Schomberg said to the King that I was his enemy, and he begged him to believe nothing that I might say about him. The King replied that he was entirely wrong, and that I had never spoken of him except to his advantage, nor of any other person, and that Schomberg knew me very little to take me for a man who did ill turns to people. He [Schomberg] was not a little astonished by this answer.â\n\nPerceiving by Bassompierreâs manner that the King had told him of their conversation, Schomberg requested Puisieux to effect a reconciliation between them, to which {376} Bassompierre âconsented reluctantly and after he had expressed to him his sentiments.â\n\nSchomberg would appear to have possessed an unusual amount of assurance, even for a German, for, immediately afterwards, he begged the man whom he had attempted to injure to employ his good offices with the King to obtain for him the governments which dâÃpernon was about to resign in order to accept that of Guienne. This cool request, however, proved a little too much for Bassompierre, whose friend Praslin also aspired to these offices; and he replied that, not only should he refuse to speak in his favour, but should oppose him, until Praslin had been provided for. Eventually dâÃpernonâs governments were divided between the two, Praslin receiving Saintonge and Aulnis, and Schomberg the Angoumois and the Limousin.\n\nOn August 27, Louis XIII arrived at Laverune, a little to the west of Montpellier, and on the following day LesdiguiÃ¨res, who had been received into the Catholic Church in the Cathedral of Grenoble on the 24th, took the oath as Constable of France; after which, to the great mortification of Schomberg, the King informed Bassompierre that it was his intention to confer the vacant marshalâs bÃ¢ton upon him, and that he would give orders for the necessary patent to be made out forthwith. His Majestyâs decision to give it to Bassompierre, notwithstanding what he had told him and Schomberg a fortnight before, was no doubt due to the fact that he had just bestowed a lucrative government upon the latter and considered that he ought to be content for the present with that proof of the royal favour. However, M. de Schomberg, who was one of those whose appetite for honours and emoluments seems only to have been stimulated by attempts to satisfy it, did not view the matter in that light, and felt deeply aggrieved. {377}\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nConditions of peace with the Huguenots decided upon—Refusal of the citizens of Montpellier to open their gates to the King until his army has been disbanded—Bullion advises Louis XIII to accede to their wishes, and is supported by the majority of the Council—Bassompierre is of the contrary opinion, and urges the King to reduce Montpellier to âentire submission and repentanceâ—Louis XIII decides to follow the advice of Bassompierre, and the siege of the town is begun—A disastrous day for the Royal army—Death of Zamet and the Italian engineer Gamorini—Political intrigues—Bassompierre succeeds in securing the post of Keeper of the Seals for Caumartin, although the King has already promised it to dâAligre, the nominee of CondÃ©—Heavy losses sustained by the besiegers in an attack upon one of the advanced-works—CondÃ© quits the army and sets out for Italy—Bassompierre is created marshal of France amidst general acclamations—Peace is signed—Death of the AbbÃ© RoucellaÃ¯—Bassompierre accompanies the King to Avignon, where he again falls of petechial fever, but recovers—He assists at the entry of the King and Queen into Lyons—He is offered the government of the Maine, but declines it.\n\nThe Royal army had now invested Montpellier, which Rohan was determined to defend to the last extremity, if he were unable to obtain a treaty for the whole body of his co-religionists; but it seemed as though peace would intervene to prevent further bloodshed. The Huguenots had abated many of their pretensions, and Louis XIII, on his side, was not disposed to press too hardly upon them. Affairs without were becoming more and more alarming; and if the Ultramontane party, blinded by religious hatred, desired to continue the war until the Protestants were entirely crushed, level-headed men saw with grief France rendered impotent abroad and a prey to civil strife to satisfy the bigotry of fanatics and the egoistic ambition of the Prince de CondÃ©. LesdiguiÃ¨res, who desired to terminate his career by the deliverance of Italy, resumed his negotiations with Rohan, and in an interview between them at Saint-Privat conditions of {378} peace were decided upon. The King was prepared to sign the articles and to make his entry into Montpellier; but the inhabitants firmly refused to open their gates to him. If, said they, the King would withdraw with his army to a distance of ten leagues, they would admit the Constable with what forces he wished to enter, and a week hence, when his army had been disbanded, they would receive his Majesty with all possible magnificence.\n\nLouis XIII at once summoned the council to consider the answer which Bullion had brought back, and after the latter had read it to those present, called upon him to give his opinion.\n\nBullion, who seems to have been a man of sound common-sense and had been a witness that morning of the genuine alarm with which the extravagant boasts of CondÃ© had inspired the people of Montpellier, strongly urged the King to humour them and âto seek solid advantages, without allowing himself to be stopped by little formalities which are not essential.â âIf,â said he, âthe town of Montpellier were refusing you the obedience and submission which is your due, I should say that it is necessary to destroy and exterminate it. But it is a people alarmed {379} and terrified by the threats which have been launched against them to plunder and destroy them, to violate their wives and daughters and to burn their houses, who entreats you in the name of God to receive its obedience through your Constable, who will enter, when you have withdrawn, with such forces as he pleases, to make your Majestyâs authority recognised there, which is the same thing as though you entered yourself. Why do you wish for a mere punctilio to refuse a peace so useful and honourable for your Majesty; and prefer to undertake a long war, of which the issue is doubtful and the expense excessive, in a country where the heat is immoderate, and to expose your own person to the injuries of war and of the season, when you can escape them without loss or blame?â\n\nThe King was visibly impressed by this excellent advice, and when CondÃ© sprang to his feet and began angrily declaiming against Bullion and âthe cabal which had forged this peace without the knowledge of the Council and were endeavouring to conclude it with disgrace and infamy,â he sternly bade him resume his seat, saying that he would have an opportunity of giving his opinion when his turn came.\n\nNot improbably influenced by the attitude of the King, counsellor after counsellor rose and expressed his approval of the advice given by Bullion. When Bassompierre was called upon, CondÃ© exclaimed impatiently: âI know his opinion already, and we can say of it ad idem.â To the general astonishment, however, Bassompierre was for once in accord with CondÃ©, and advised the King to break off the negotiations forthwith and âshow, by a noble and generous disdain, how deeply he was offended by the propositions of those of Montpellier.â âIf,â said he, âyour Majesty were before Strasbourg, Antwerp, or Milan, and were concluding a peace with the princes to which those towns belong, the stipulation that you should not enter them would be {380} tolerable; but that a King of France, victorious and supported by a powerful army, in place of granting peace to a handful of his rebel subjects, without resource and reduced to extremity, should receive it from them on the disgraceful conditions which they have just proposed, is a proposition so insulting that it cannot be suffered nor even listened to.... The King who accepts those conditions must be prepared to receive terrible insults from the other towns, who will be rendered audacious by this example and assured of impunity by this unworthy toleration.... Sire, in the name of God, take a firm resolution and persevere in it, and insist even upon the ruin of this people, because it is rebellious, and because it is also insolent and impudent; or to reduce it to entire submission and complete repentance.â\n\nHe then pointed out that his own interests were opposed to the advice which he was offering the King, and that he was actuated entirely by regard for his Majestyâs service and honour, since he had already been promised the marshalâs bÃ¢ton and had nothing to gain at the siege of Montpellier, âsave much toil, dangerous wounds and perhaps even death.â It was also possible that unfortunate accidents might arise which might oblige the King to defer his promotion to the office of marshal or even compel him [Bassompierre] to refuse the honour. âNevertheless,â he concluded, âI shall take these risks, and I beg your Majesty very humbly to delay my reception [as marshal] until the town of Montpellier shall be reduced to its obedience, and your Majesty avenged of the affront which these rebels have desired to inflict upon you.â\n\nThere can be no doubt that Bassompierre, who was an honest man and a devoted servant of the Crown, was actuated by what he considered to be his duty in tendering this advice to his sovereign, which had touched Louis XIII on his weakest spot—his exaggerated regard for his own dignity. But it is equally certain that he had committed a disastrous mistake, both from a political and military point of view, in counselling the King to sacrifice the interests of his realm for what Bullion had rightly described as âa mere punctilio.â For, not only was an immediate peace of the most vital importance to the interests of France, both at home and abroad, but the reduction of the people of Montpellier to âentire submission and complete repentanceâ was a task which, in the most favourable circumstances, could not be effected except at immense expense and at the cost of hundreds of valuable lives. It is indeed amazing that, after the terrible lesson of Montauban, anyone could have been so rash as to embark upon another great siege for reasons so inadequate.\n\nThe siege began in anything but an auspicious manner. In the early hours of September 2, Bassompierre and Praslin advanced against the ridge of Saint-Denis, where the citadel now stands, and carried it without any resistance, since there was only a guard-house there, the occupants of which fled at their approach. Leaving ValenÃ§ay there with some 1,500 men to hold it, they returned to camp, and, after attending a meeting of the {382} Council, Bassompierre, who had to be up all the following night to superintend the opening of the trenches, went to his tent to snatch a few hoursâ sleep. About midday, he was awakened by the sound of heavy firing, and, hurrying out, he saw the troops whom he and Praslin had left on the ridge of Saint-Denis in disorderly retreat, hotly pursued by the enemy.\n\nIt appears that ValenÃ§ay, believing that there was no possibility of his being attacked in broad daylight, had not only neglected to entrench himself, but had even allowed his men to pile arms and scatter about the ridge; and, to crown all, had permitted a trumpeter from the town, who had been sent to demand the bodies of the dead, to approach without taking the precaution to order his eyes to be bandaged. On his return to Montpellier, this man duly reported what he had seen to his officers; and the garrison, sallying out in considerable force, fell upon the astonished ValenÃ§ay and utterly routed him.\n\nSpringing on a horse, Bassompierre galloped off to the quarters of the Swiss Guards, who were the troops nearest the ridge of Saint-Denis, called them to arms and led them against the enemy. Meantime, the Duc de Montmorency, the young Duc de Fronsac and other nobles and gentlemen, who happened to be in attendance on the King, who had just finished dinner, had mounted the first horses they could find, and, with more valour than discretion, thrown themselves into the mÃªlÃ©e, in a vain endeavour to rally the fugitives. Montmorencyâs life was saved by dâArgencourt, the lieutenant-governor of Montpellier, who fortunately recognised him, and he escaped with a couple of not very serious wounds; but his companions perished almost to a man, amongst them being Fronsac, whom Bassompierre describes as âa young prince of great promise, who, in his opinion, would have been one day a great captain,â the Marquis de Beuvron, dâAuctot, who commanded CondÃ©âs company of light horse and was a great favourite of the prince, and Luynesâs {383} nephew Combalet, brother of the young lady whom Bassompierre would in all probability have married, had the late Constable lived a few months longer.[9]\n\nHowever, Bassompierre had now brought up the Swiss, and before the advance of these veterans, the enemy, who had pursued the routed troops almost to the confines of the Royal camp, fell back into the town, and the ridge of Saint-Denis was recovered. But it had been a most disastrous day for the besiegers, for ValenÃ§ayâs force had been terribly cut up and his best officers killed.\n\nNext day, the defenders of Montpellier, encouraged by this success, made a determined attack on Montmorencyâs troops, encamped to the west of the town, who gave way before them. Zamet,[10] who had taken over the command from the wounded duke, succeeded in rallying them and driving the enemy back. But almost immediately afterwards he was mortally wounded by a cannon-shot from the town, and died a few days later.\n\nThe trenches were opened without any further disasters, but very little progress was made, for the enemy stubbornly disputed every yard of ground. The Italian engineer Gamorini was killed on the 11th, and his death was a severe loss to the besiegers. The same night the defenders made a fierce sortie, which was not repulsed until the work of several days had been destroyed. During the fighting a captain of the Navarre Regiment named Des Champs was surrounded by the enemy and would have been killed, had he not cried out: âI am Bassompierre; I am worth 20,000 crowns to you!â Upon which they spared his life and made him prisoner, thinking that they had secured a valuable prize.\n\nIn the night of the 13th-14th, the besiegers attacked the advanced-works on the north side of the town in three places simultaneously, and carried them. This placed {384} them in a favourable position for bringing their cannon to bear upon the main fortifications; but, on the advice of a young engineer named La Magne Chavannes, and notwithstanding the opposition of Bassompierre and other officers, CondÃ© insisted that they should first concentrate their efforts against a ravelin situated between the two bastions. The task of approaching this work proved a most difficult one, as they were exposed to a heav"
