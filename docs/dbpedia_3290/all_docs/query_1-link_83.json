        "text": "The study focuses on the theater that was practiced by migrant workers in the 1960s and 1970s, and an actualization of this discussion from the recents studies about decolonial representation in french arts. We highlight the political role of the migrants' native language and culture, emphasizing the role of the playwright Kateb Yacine as an avant-garde representation of decolonial engagement in theater. In the pedagogical context, the investigation describes the interventions made by Augusto Boal and CETITADE during the 70s and 80s, as an expansion of a new look about the immigration theme, where the migrant protagonism was the center of the artistic process.\n\nThis paper was primarily based on correspondence of Marco Foscari IV, member of respectable patrician family who served from 1789 to 1792 as Captain Raspa of a small fortress in Istria. His correspondence with close friends discloses opportunities in Venice, as well as events related to its nightlife in which the theatre, along with opera, played the dominant role. Its focus is research on influence of French Revolution on Venetian theatre and opera. In search for micro level of analysis, authors put their focus on local perspective on French-Italian relations, and their influence on opera. Therefore, authors singled out one interesting event which sparked great public attention in Venice – debates and process of the construction of a new theatre in the San Fantino, sestiere de San Marco, theatre La Fenice. At the time of prohibition of the public and private gatherings, in early 1790s, in this paper authors analysed position of opera.\n\n\"WORTH THE READ! THE HUGUENOT JEAN ROU (1638-1711): SCHOLAR, EDUCATOR, CIVIL SERVANT We are pleased to announce that we have a new author friend, Dr. Michaël Green, who researched and wrote the excellent book about the Huguenot Jean Rou, published by Honoré Champion of Paris, which was considered for the 2015 Scholarly Works Award. The full details are: The Huguenot Jean Rou (1638-1711): Scholar, Educator, Civil Servant, series: Vie des Huguenots, Paris: Honoré Champion, 2015. We would like to share with you some of the reasons that this particular book deserves our Huguenot attention. Jean Rou was not only a Huguenot, a scholar, an educator, and a civil servant, he was also for a time a lawyer at the Parlement de Paris, and he was even a brief resident of the Bastille after his writing offended the Catholic Church. Despite the controversy he sometimes generated, he went on to build a distinguished and prominent career, first as a tutor, and later as a translator of the States-General of the United Provinces at The Hague. Jean Rou’s career path was fascinating, but one of the most important reasons the book is valuable is because Dr. Green has researched Huguenot culture extensively, and offers us important information about the educational views of Huguenots, their practical use of networking, and other interesting Huguenot social practices during one of the critical periods of Huguenot history.\""
