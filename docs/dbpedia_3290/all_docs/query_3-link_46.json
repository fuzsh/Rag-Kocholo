        "text": "In 1556, the cardinal Alessandro Farnese begins the building of the Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, a village north of Rome. Its decoration attests of his wealth and his power by showing his family’s glorious deeds and his role in the defense of the Catholic Church. Loren Partridge, the specialist of the Palazzo Farnese, has noticed such a discourse in the room of maps and the room of Farnese deeds among others. This paper will show that the cardinal’s private chapel has a part in this panegyric. Since the Palazzo Farnese is located outside urban centers, the mass, attended by the cardinal, his famiglia and his guests, is celebrated in its chapel on a regular basis. Consequently, the chapel’s architecture and iconography are used as a display of Alessandro Farnese’s papal ambitions. In the first place, the circular form of the room and the parallel between the altar and the tomb of Christ recall the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. This analogy is part of the cardinal’s plan to establish Caprarola as a new Jerusalem. At the same time, Pope Gregory XIII applies the same allegory to Rome, in order to assert its power over Christianity and to enhance his own qualities. By recuperating the papal strategy, Alessandro Farnese shows his guests his ability for the papal throne. In the second place, the Eucharistic symbolic is really important in the global iconography of the chapel. This prominence shows the filiation between Alessandro Farnese and his grandfather, the pope Paul III, who made the defense of the sacrament his main concern in the fight against Protestantism. This could be a strategy to present the former as worthy of the papal tiara as the later. In fact, this example shows that private chapels in countryside palaces are not so private and can be used as a public display of the political ambitions of their owner.\n\nIn the Sala del Mappamondo, on the piano nobile of Palazzo Farnese in Caprarola, America, Europe, Africa, and Asia in the form of four female figures enrich the corners of the large world map painted on the south-east wall. They are seated outside of the golden frame encompassing the oecumene, each one looming before her own niche like idols emerging from their dark corners, summoned in the presence of viewers to guide them in a voyage through the world contained in the room. First, the analysis focuses on their formal strategies of presentation and the vocabulary of attributes they adopt, borrowed from ancient Roman coinage, to investigate the reasons behind their classical-style robe and the ideological statement emerging from this adoption in the context of the complex celebratory organism of the hall. Secondly, the figurative code deployed in the Room is compared to the previous Camerino dei Continenti in Rome’s Palazzo Firenze and three lunettes in Rome’s Palazzo Ruggeri (1553 and 1591, respectively), outlining visual and semantic analogies. The Camerino offers an early representation of our theme brimming with mythological and erudite references - in the panel of the vault with Europa, Asia, and Africa - as well as exotic ones in the external ornamentation. Even the later lunettes depict an oecumene which is anachronistically still tripartite, though visually anchored in a recent source (i.e. the Theatrum orbis terrarum frontispiece). Starting from the main case-study and considering these less-studied frescoes, it is thus possible to delve into forms of confluence (intertwining or instances of resistance) between the world of antiquity and the world of geographic exploration, as displayed by each image, eventually shedding light on potential motivations and iconological implications. Eventually, the plurality of worlds at play in Caprarola – this essay argues – is a means for re-drawing the present, folding the viewer’s gaze of manifold worlds into the celebrative demands of Alessandro Farnese, specifically his project of building a single, universalizing mirror image of the world he coveted. The geographical and anthropological multiplicity exhibited in this room is thus translated and re-channeled by its allegory into a unifying and all-encompassing vision that embraces places – the ones depicted in the world map and extensive cartographic cycle covering all the walls – but above all times. In the decorative apparatus of the Room of Maps, the personifications play a fundamental role, that of depicting and enacting the synchronous coexistence of past and present. The latter is thus permeated by the vestiges of the former in order to make sense of itself, using a figurative code rooted deep in a past age to represent a world that was, by then, inchoately modern and irreparably changed.\n\nThis essay examines the history and decoration of the Salviati Chapel at San Gregorio al Celio in Rome as the repository of an image of the Virgin and in relation to two other chapels created by the same patron (Antonio Maria Salviati) in the church of San Giacomo in Augusta. In considering this dialogue among the chapels, I analyze the rationale behind the project at San Gregorio and its purpose to valorize antique images, reconstructing the particular design and function in the space of the now lost altarpiece with St. Gregory by Annibale Carracci. I also discuss more broadly th theme of the artistic experimentation and confrontation between \"old\" and \"ruined\" 'images' and \"new\" and \"beautiful\" 'works of art', that took place in Rome at the turn of the seventeenth century.\n\nThe legacies of Vasarian and Burckhardtian historical paradigms have had the effect of leaving Bernardino Pinturicchio’s Fossi altarpiece (1495-6) in the Galleria nazionale dell’Umbria insufficiently investigated. This study examines the patronage, form, iconography and politics surrounding the polyptych, in the light of contemporary historical and cultural phenomena. Pinturicchio’s reputation in Rome at that moment was unsurpassed, the artist having been named by the incumbent pope ‘pictor palatii apostolici’. The article, presented in two parts, demonstrates that the altarpiece should not be considered a parochial work of art by a second rate painter: it is, rather, a visual manifestation of a complex web of designs - commercial, communal, ecclesiastical and papal - moulded by the most pressing artistic and historical exigencies in the Italian peninsula in the closing years of the fifteenth century. Part 1 begins by seting out the circumstances of the commission, establishing the ..."
