        "text": "I’ve been watching “The Borgias,” a Showtime Original Series that’s on Netflix “instant stream” right now, and tells the story of Pope Alexander VI and his children; Cesare, Juan, Lucrezia, and Jeoffrey. Rodrigo Borgia, became Pope Alexander VI on August 11, 1492. This story of a very powerful family could also be called “Godfather: the Prequel.” The reason why I am drawn to it is the connection The Borgia family has to Rome. We’ll see the Borgia Apartments while in the Vatican Museums and this story is giving me a more in-depth understanding of the family that lived in those rooms. Granted, the show is a dramatic depiction of the truth. The personalities of the characters couldn’t be the same as the real people. Probably. However, it is giving me a reason to look deeper into this family and learn about what life was like in the late 1400’s and early 1500’s. It is a bloody and violent show, and since it is Showtime you can count on sexual content. However, the times really were violent and the people in those days could actual be as cruel as depicted in the show. On the Showtime’s website the writer/director speaks of the story: “The Borgia’s were Spanish but their family had been living in Rome for two generations. They were considered outsiders in Rome, interlopers that were totally unworthy of any position in the church what-so-ever.” From what he says, this made them sort of paranoid of the chance that their family could be divided and their power taken away. They would do anything, anything at all, to keep their positions in the church. It is said that Rodrigo Borgia bought his Papacy. It is also said that Cesare, Juan, and possibly Rodrigo/Alexander would use poison and other means to get rid of their adversaries. And, of course, they would use marriage (just as the royals did) to create ties between the Papal States and create loyalty among countries. You may also wonder about the fact that this pope, once a cardinal in the Catholic Church, had children. Was he married? No. He kept a mistress, Vannozza Cattanei. And when Rodrigo became Pope Alexander he got rid of Vannozza and fell in love with the lovely Giulia Farnese. (Guilia Farnese’s brother, Alessandro Farnese, became a cardinal at the same time that Cesare Borgia became a Cardinal. Pope Alexander VI believed wholeheartedly in nepotism. Alessandro was later Pope Paul III.) Information from: Britannica.com\n\nIn the Borgia Apartments we will see highly decorative frescoes created by Pinturicchio (pronounced: pin-tuh-ree-kee-yoh.) It is thought that because of his use of space, color, and detail that he influenced the work of Raphael. The fun part of watching the show is how they incorporate little details like the hiring of Pinturicchio. There is a scene when he is painting Guilia Farnese and the characters talk about how the lamb that she is holding is going to be a unicorn, referring to the extremely well-known picture of Giulia Farnese painted by Raphael where she is holding a unicorn. Then Lucrezia Borgia walks in and talks about wanting her picture painted. I love this kind of connection from fiction to fact to fiction. Here are the two pictures of which I am referring:\n\nGiulia Farnese by Raphael, a painting we can see at the Borghese Museum\n\nLucrezia Borgia. A part of a larger fresco painted by Pinturicchio.\n\nThis is what Pinturicchio looked like: We can see this in Santa Maria Maggiore.\n\nThis is probably another painting of Giulia Farnese but not by Pinturicchio, but by Luca Longhi. We can see this painting at the Castel Sant’Angelo in Rome.\n\nAs I learn about the Borgias I wonder what happened to the family in the end. Here is a quote that I found interesting: “No Borgias ever rose to become as powerful as Alexander, but there were plenty of minor figures who held religious and political positions, and Francis Borgia (d. 1572) [not sure how he is related] was made a saint. By Francis’ time the family was declining in importance, and by the end of the eighteenth century it had died out” (europeanhistory.about.com). So, apparently there are no Borgias left in the 21st century. But, one wonders where their bloodline went. Did it run through the crime families that came to America from Italy? Does it run through any of the popes that followed? It would be interesting to find a link to the Borgia family line.\n\nThe best conclusion I could come up with for this blog is to quote, once again, europeanhistory.com: “Alexander and the Borgias have come infamous for corruption, cruelty and murder. Yet what Alexander did as pope was rarely original, he just took things to a new extreme. Cesare was perhaps the supreme intersection of secular power wielded to spiritual power in Europe’s history, and the Borgias were renaissance princes no worse than many of their contemporaries. Indeed, Cesare was given the dubious distinction of Machiavelli, who knew Cesare, saying the Borgia general was a grand example of how to tackle power.” I also heard that Niccolo Machiavelli looked at Cesare and how he “tackled power” and then wrote The Prince, his 16th century political treatise, sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern political philosophy. This book is what brought the term “Machiavellian” into popular usage. Machiavelli is also a character in the show The Borgias because he was a very important political figure at the time of Pope Alexander VI.\n\nAnd another fun part about this show? The hair styles and the clothes."
