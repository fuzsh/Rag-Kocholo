        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPortrait Cultures of the Early Modern Cardinal\n\nVisual and Material Culture, 1300-1700 A forum for innovative research on the role of images and objects in the late medieval and early modern periods, Visual and Material Culture, 1300-1700 publishes monographs and essay collections that combine rigorous investigation with critical inquiry to present new narratives on a wide range of topics, from traditional arts to seemingly ordinary things. Recognizing the fluidity of images, objects, and ideas, this series fosters cross-cultural as well as multi-disciplinary exploration. We consider proposals from across the spectrum of analytic approaches and methodologies. Series Editor Dr. Allison Levy, an art historian, has written and/or edited three scholarly books, and she has been the recipient of numerous grants and awards, from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Association of University Women, the Getty Research Institute, the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library of Harvard University, the Whiting Foundation and the Bogliasco Foundation, among others. www.allisonlevy.com.\n\nPortrait Cultures of the Early Modern Cardinal\n\nEdited by Piers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nAmsterdam University Press\n\nThis publication has been made possible by a grant from the Scouloudi Foundation in association with the Institute of Historical Research.\n\nCover illustration: Scipione Pulzone, Cardinal Ferdinando de’ Medici, 1580, oil on canvas, Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide (© Art Gallery of South Australia, Adelaide/Mrs Mary Overton Gift Fund 1998) Cover design: Coördesign, Leiden Lay-out: Crius Group, Hulshout 978 94 6372 551 4 isbn 978 90 4854 456 1 e-isbn doi 10.5117/9789463725514 nur 685 © The authors / Amsterdam University Press B.V., Amsterdam 2021 All rights reserved.

Finally, we are grateful to the Scouloudi Foundation in association with the Institute of Historical Research whose generous grant enabled the publication of this volume.\n\n1.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church Piers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke Abstract This chapter gives a brief overview of the place of cardinal portraits within early modern portraiture as a whole. It explores how certain typologies specific to cardinals evolved in different media over the period. It also considers how these images carried unique meanings and functions that depended on the particular office and duties of the cardinal. Keywords: cardinals; popes; portraiture; Renaissance; Counter-Reformation\n\nThe visual legacy of early modern cardinals constitutes a vast and extremely rich body of artworks – many of superb quality – in a variety of media. Despite the wealth of images of cardinals and the clear relevance of these works to a variety of disciplines, there is no comprehensive study dedicated to the subject of cardinal portraits: existing scholarship consists of a handful of articles and an exhibition, which primarily approach the topic from a formal perspective.1 The late Clare Robertson, to whom this volume is dedicated, highlighted this in her chapter on the subject in the recent Companion to the Early Modern Cardinal, asserting that cardinal portraits form ‘a significant subset’ of early modern portraiture, and noting the limited scholarship on the topic.2 It is the aim of the essays in the present volume to investigate portraits of cardinals as a distinct category within early modern portraiture and as a specif ic art historical phenomenon. Examining in what ways the production, collection, and status of such portraits were influenced by a set of identities, experiences, values, and interests unique to cardinals as a group, the following We are indebted to Paul Joannides, Carol M. Richardson, and Patricia Lee Rubin for reading drafts of this essay and providing many helpful comments and corrections. 1 Notably Kempers, ‘Canonical Portrait’, 2001; Tittoni and Petrucci, eds., La porpora romana, 2006; Tostmann ‘Sebastiano del Piombos Bildnis’, 2011. 2 Robertson, ‘Portraits of Early Modern Cardinals’, 2020, p. 557.\n\nBaker-Bates, P. and I. Brooke (eds.), Portrait Cultures of the Early Modern Cardinal. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2021 doi 10.5117/9789463725514_ch01\n\n22\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nessays complement the scholarship on the history of cardinals undertaken in the Companion volume. While the chronological parameters of our inquiry are slightly more restricted, running from the accession of Martin V in 1420 until the death of Innocent X in 1655, we also employ the term ‘early modern’ to characterize the period, primarily for its flexibility and convenience.3 In these years, around 675 men from a wide range of socio-economic and geographic backgrounds – although predominantly from the Italian peninsula – passed through the Sacred College. The likenesses of many of them were constructed, either of their own volition or at the request of others; in many cases more than one portrait was executed and in more than one medium. Acknowledging the diversity of such images, the essays in this volume investigate intersections of meaning, function, and visual semantics that arise from the shared historical reality of cardinals in this period. Inevitably, the methodologies of many authors in this volume draw upon the vast body of art historical literature addressing the topic of portraiture. Despite the subordinate status assigned to the genre by art theorists in the period, portraiture’s fundamental role within the visual arts in early modern Europe has long been recognized, although there remain avenues of inquiry and methods of interpretation that have yet to be pursued. Since Jacob Burckhardt’s influential study of Renaissance culture, interpretations of early modern portraits have often hinged on a perceived reawakening of awareness of the ‘individual’; portraits have been read to reflect a new interest in what Pope-Hennessy termed ‘the cult of the personality’. 4 Stephen Greenblatt’s seminal study on Renaissance self-fashioning has led to recognition of the crucial role played by portraiture in the construction of identity.5 The diverse meanings and functions that portraits could assume – donor, commemorative, propagandistic, exemplary, votive – have been explored by scholars, as has the contemporary rhetoric, based on classical sources and taken up by Alberti, surrounding portraiture’s ostensible function of ‘making the absent present’, together with its qualitative value in being ‘lifelike’.6 The role of portraits within early modern collections has also been examined. Paolo Giovio established a model for collecting series of portraits of illustrious men (uomini famosi), images\n\n3 Only Arnold Witte’s essay extends beyond this date range. 4 Burckhardt, Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy, 1892; see also Pope-Hennessy, Portrait, 1966, and Burke, ‘Renaissance, Individualism’, 1995. 5 Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning, 1984. 6 Several studies and exhibitions in recent decades have investigated many of these same issues. See Brilliant, Portraiture, 1991; Woodall, ed., Portraiture, 1997; Mann and Syson, Image of the Individual, 1998; Cranston, Poetics of Portraiture, 2000; Syson, Renaissance Faces, 2008; Christiansen and Weppelmann, eds., Renaissance Portrait, 2012.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nwhich more often prioritized social roles than accurate likeness.7 These became a component not only of princely and noble collections but also of those formed by scholars, merchants, and clerics, including of course cardinals, who also often featured among the worthies on display.8 Portraits of cardinals naturally functioned in ways similar to other categories of portraiture. And yet as material objects, cardinal portraits were clearly embedded with meanings specific to the class of individuals represented. On account of their dress, cardinals are in fact among the most recognizable public figures portrayed in the visual arts of the early modern period.9 While many representations of cardinals can be identified, countless others remain anonymous, but still carry a message relating to the authority – both spiritual and secular – of the pope and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Furthermore, cardinal portraits often assumed special functions relating specifically to the duties and offices of the rank. And yet, given that cardinals in this period represented a diversity of nationalities, social status, as well as political and theological outlooks, the significance, values, and uses of their portraits could vary widely depending on the individual – or individuals – portrayed and the context. The current volume seeks to address this range of issues specific to cardinal portraits in four thematic sections. The first section, ‘Individuality and Identity: Florence and Rome’, examines specific types of cardinal images in relation to questions of individual likeness and collective identity, while the second section, ‘Divided Loyalties: Venice and Rome’, explores how the often conflicted political allegiances of cardinals could be manifested in their imagery. The diverse roles fulfilled by cardinals’ images within different types of collections, as well as questions relating to wealth and ritualistic display, are examined in ‘Collecting and Display: Portraits and Worldly Goods’. The fourth section, ‘Post-Tridentine Piety: The Devout Cardinal’, examines how the portraiture of cardinals was impacted by the shifting religious climate of the years around and after Trent. The final chapter, which forms a conclusion to the volume, examines the issue of cardinal portraits beyond Italy, considering the case of Spanish cardinals. The topics addressed in these sections comprise some of the crucial elements that shaped the various ‘cultures’ in which cardinal portraits were produced and received by both contemporary and later viewers. 7 Burke, ‘Renaissance, Individualism’, 1995, p. 395. 8 Klinger, Portrait Collection, 1991, and Klinger, ‘Images of Identity’, 1998; see also Thomas-Leo True’s essay in this volume.

However, portraits of cardinals appear in a variety of media with some regularity from the early fourteenth century. Some of the earliest extant portraits of a cardinal in any medium were executed by Giotto, the artist credited by Vasari with initiating a renewal in the arts that involved ‘introducing the drawing from nature of living persons’.10 This mimetic quality of portraiture was consistently discussed by early modern writers on art and defined as its critical value. However, Giotto’s portraits of Cardinal Giacomo Gaetano Stefaneschi who appears as a donor in the triptych that he commissioned from the artist for old St. Peter’s (c.1330, Pinacoteca Vaticana), are to the modern eye very generalized.11 Indeed, in terms of physiognomy, Stefaneschi does not appear so different to the famous donor portrait of Enrico Scrovegni that Giotto included in the Arena Chapel in Padua. This introduces questions of value relating to individualized likeness versus idealization or type which run throughout ecclesiastical portraiture in the period covered in this volume.12 In the case of Giotto’s portraits of Cardinal Stefaneschi, it is only because we are informed about the historical personage that we can identify him as a cardinal. While his pontifical of dalmatic and mitre shown on the front of the triptych indicate that he is a churchman of high rank, he does not wear the scarlet choir dress that make early modern cardinals immediately recognizable.13 Although, cardinals were not consistently portrayed wearing this until the sixteenth century, when their dress is outlined in Paolo Cortesi’s De Cardinalatu, from an early point cardinals were depicted in at least one of what became their canonical apparel, usually accompanied by the red galero, or wide-brimmed hat.14 These were reserved for cardinals by Innocent IV at the Council of Lyon in 1245, and several fourteenth- and fifteenth-century manuscript illuminations include members of the papal entourage identifiable as cardinals through their red hats. 10 Vasari, Le vite, 1881, pp. 373–374; Rubin, ‘Understanding Renaissance Portraiture’, 2012, p. 3. 11 Ibid. See also Steinke, ‘Giotto und Physiognomik’, 1996; Seiler, ‘Giotto als Erfinder des Porträts’, 2002. 12 Jacobus, ‘Propria Figura’, 2017. For a discussion of the issue see Brian Jeffrey Maxson’s and Carol M. Richardson’s essays in this volume. 13 Although the date of the Stefaneschi altarpiece is much debated, it seems highly likely to have been executed after the cardinal’s nomination in 1295. See Gardner, ‘Stefaneschi Altarpiece’, 1974, pp. 57–103. St. Peter here wears a red cloak emaphsizing his role as the first pope. In conversation, Carol Richardson has observed that the fact that Stefaneschi is depicted holding a model of the altarpiece places a corporal emphasis on the liturgical aspect of his gift. 14 See Richardson, ‘Cardinal’s Wardrobe’, 2020.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nA late fourteenth-century manuscript of the Decretals of Boniface VIII, now in the British Library, and the early fifteenth-century Très Riches Heures du duc du Berry (Chantilly, Musée Condé) both include images of generalized figures surrounding the pope; the men are recognizable as cardinals from their red galeri and serve to reinforce the identity and authority of the pontiff.15 Besides such collective, anonymous representations, there are also early portrait illuminations of individual cardinals, including Stefaneschi himself, who are identifiable through their coat of arms and red choir dress.16 An early fifteenth-century example occurs on the first folio of the Missal of Cardinal Angelo Acciaiuoli (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum), datable to 1405 (Plate 1).17 Produced in Florence nearly a century after the Stefaneschi altarpiece, the portrait of Acciaiuoli is still very idealized and his dress remains a fundamental marker of his identity. While the galero, shown in all these examples, served primarily as a symbol of the office – replaced by the biretta in later representations – the fundamental purpose of the red choir dress was to designate the cardinals’ relationship to the pope, signifying their combined role as ‘the head and members of the papal body’.18 Nevertheless, dress has not always led to accurate identifications; there is much debate as to whether Van Eyck’s portrait now in the Kusthistorisches Museum, Vienna – usually taken as one of the earliest extant examples of an independent portrait of a cardinal – does in fact portray Cardinal Niccolò Albergati.19 Sometimes cardinals deliberately chose not to be represented in their red choir dress. In the 1530s there is the famous case of Ippolito de’ Medici – always a reluctant cardinal – who was portrayed by Titian in an extravagant Hungarian hunting costume (Florence, Palazzo Pitti) and may have also been depicted by Sebastiano del Piombo, both in secular dress and armour in paintings now in private collections.20 Cardinals occasionally might be represented in domestic attire considered acceptable for their office, rather than in choir dress, although this was rare following 15 BL add MS 23923, and Musée Condé, Chantilly, MS 65, fol. 197r; for further discussion of anonymous representations of cardinals in illuminations, see Brian Jeffrey Maxson’s essay in this volume, esp. Fig. 3.2. 16 Stefaneschi is portrayed in his red choir dress in the Vatican Codex of St. George; see Gardner, ‘Stefaneschi Altarpiece’, 1974, p. 69. 17 Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 30; for a recent discussion of the manuscript, see Kerr-Di-Carlo, ‘Making the Cardinal’s Missal’, 2017. 18 Richardson, ‘Cardinal’s Wardrobe’, 2020, p. 535. As Richardson explains, red was historically the colour of the popes. 19 Hunter, ‘Who Is Jan van Eyck’s “Cardinal Nicolo Albergati”’, 1993. 20 Scarpa, ‘Ritratto del cardinale Ippolito de’ Medici’, 2006; Rebecchini, Un altro Lorenzo, 2010, pp. 160–163; Baker-Bates, ‘Technical Experimentation’, 2020. Ippolito appears in his red choir dress in a double portrait with Marco Bracci now in the National Gallery, London, tentatively attributed to Girolamo da Carpi, though the likeness in this seems to be based on Titian’s portrait; see Mancini and Penny, National Gallery Catalogues, vol. 3: Bologna and Ferrara, pp. 286–295.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nthe convocation of the Council of Trent in 1545. In cases like Pier Francesco Foschi’s portrait of Antonio Pucci (Corsini Gallery, Florence), the sitter’s identity as a cardinal appears not to have been prioritized. While such images certainly represent members of the Sacred College, they open up the category of cardinal portraits, as they do not explicitly communicate their sitters’ status as ‘princes of the church’, emphasizing instead other aspects of their identity – in Pucci’s case his wealth and learning. Sometimes cardinals might also be represented in the dress of their order or of a specific office, as in the case of Antonio Pucci’s uncle, Lorenzo, who is shown in a portrait by Parmigianino (ex-Abercorn collection) as the Major Penitentiary, one of the most prestigious offices in the Curia, which he held from 1520–1529. Images such as these reflect the multilayered identities of cardinals in the period.21\n\nPictorial Portraits: Evolution of a Genre and Type In the early sixteenth century, Raphael’s portrait of Julius II now in the National Gallery, London, supplied a fundamental model for cardinal portraiture.22 The iconographic derivation of cardinal portraits from a papal model created a visual reference that reflected their official relationship, like their dress.23 However, cardinals seem to have enjoyed a slightly greater degree of iconographic flexibility than popes, and in the second decade of the sixteenth century, both Raphael and Sebastiano del Piombo experimented with compositional solutions that would provide prototypes for artists working in Rome and throughout Europe for the next century.24 The iconography of Raphael’s portrait of Julius II is reflected in images of cardinals produced by him and his workshop: a portrait of an unidentified cardinal now in the Prado, Madrid, and that of Cardinal Bibbiena (Florence, Palazzo Pitti) show their subjects seated at bust length, angled toward the picture plane at 45 degrees.25 Following these examples, cardinals would, for the next two centuries, most often appear seated, with varying degrees of their stature included. However, an important precedent was also set by the three-quarter-length, standing portrait of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (Museo di Capodimonte, Naples), which is often attributed 21 Pilliod, ‘In Tempore Poenitentiae’, 1988; Hirst, ‘Portrait of Lorenzo Pucci’, 2000. 22 For Raphael’s portrait of Julius II, which refers back to Justus of Ghent’s portrait of Sixtus IV; see Partridge and Starn, Renaissance Likeness, 1980, and Chapman et al., Raphael, 2004, pp. 272–275. For its legacy see Mansour, ‘Prince and Pontiff’, 2008, pp. 209–229. 23 Woodall, ed., Portraiture, 1997, p. 2. 24 Kempers, ‘Canonical Portrait’, 2001; Petrucci, ‘Tipologie della ritrattistica cardinalizia’, 2006; Robertson, ‘Portraits of Early Modern Cardinals’, 2020, pp. 559–565. 25 For both of these portraits, see Henry and Joannides, Late Raphael, pp. 265–268, with bibliography. These authors identify the Prado cardinal as Francesco Alidosi whose portrait medal is discussed below.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nFig. 1.1 Sebastiano del Piombo, Cardinal Bandinello Sauli, His Secretary, and Two Geographers, 1516, oil on canvas, Washington, DC, National Gallery of Art (© National Gallery of Art, Washington).\n\nto Raphael, though it may have been executed by a member of his workshop.26 Cardinal Farnese, the future Paul III, is positioned before a window with a view onto an idyllic landscape, a variant on the dark green or grey-black backgrounds which characterize the other portraits. Sebastiano’s group portrait of Cardinal Bandinello Sauli, his Secretary, and Two Geographers (Washington, DC, National Gallery; Fig. 1.1) further expanded the iconographic possibilities for cardinal portraiture, incorporating additional figures and props to emphasize his rank.27 A few decades later, in Venice, Titian played a leading role in developing such models further, executing his bust-length portrait of Cardinal Pietro Bembo (Washington, DC; Plate 2), which communicates the sitter’s status, character, and intellectual prowess through a penetrating gaze and rhetorical gesture.28 Titian’s meticulous 26 Leone de Castris, ‘Raffaello Sanzio, Ritratto del cardinal Alessandro Farnese’, 1995, pp. 168–169. 27 Tostmann, ‘Sebastiano del Piombos Bildnis’, 2011, pp. 311–348. 28 See Peter Humfrey’s entry on the National Gallery website: www.nga.gov/collection/art-objectpage.41638.html#entry (accessed May 2020).\n\n27\n\n28\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nattention to the texture and detail of the cardinal’s shimmering silk mozzetta set an important example for the next generation of painters who, following the conclusion of the Council of Trent, fully exploited the canonical type. This now fulfilled the requirements of the new religious climate in presenting a consistent image of the cardinal as a noble and dignified proponent of Catholic orthodoxy. Indeed, the established formats for cardinal portraiture accorded perfectly with Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti’s insistence, in his Discorso intorno alle immagini sacre e profane of 1582, that ‘portraits of persons of rank and dignity […] must ensure that [the sitters] are depicted with the gravity and decorum appropriate to their status […] most especially ecclesiastics’.29 As ‘heirs in waiting’ to the papal throne, cardinals’ in particular were required through their imagery to communicate ecclesiastical authority and unity. With a marked increase in demand in the years during and after Trent, every major artist active at Rome produced one or more cardinal portraits. Scipione Pulzone was particularly successful at reinterpreting the established formula. In his numerous portraits, which often exist in multiple versions, cardinals are generally shown either at half or three-quarter length, often seated, though occasionally standing. They are inevitably clothed in their official red choir dress, usually holding a letter, alluding to their duties and office, or a small book, suggesting their learning and piety. Sometimes accompanied by secondary figures, Scipione’s cardinals are frequently distinguished by lavish fabrics and intricate accessories.30 In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries there emerged a popular genre of of printed cardinal portraits known as the Effigies cardinalium nunc viventum. Ottavio Leoni, known for his ritratti di macchia, or portrait sketches executed from memory, helped to disseminate cardinals’ images through his collaboration on the 1608 Effigies, a series of 77 engraved cardinal portraits, published under the auspices of Paul V and based on likenesses taken by Leoni.31 This project was an important precedent for the De Rossi printers’ highly successful and long-running collection of engraved cardinal portraits, the Libro de’ Ritratti degli Eminentissimi Signori Cardinali, dall’anno MDCLVIII, which, at its conclusion in 1863, contained 831 images of past and present members of the Sacred College.32 Such collections were inspired by compilations of cardinals’ biographies, which had begun to appear towards the end of the sixteenth century and which often included likenesses of 29 Paleotti, Discorso, 1582, cap. xx, p. 340. 30 See Danielle Carrabino’s essay in this volume. 31 Tittoni and Petrucci, eds., La porpora romana, 2006, p. 25, and nos. 14, 18, and 20; Primarosa, ‘Ottavio Leoni’, 2013, pp. 55–72; Primarosa, ‘Fermare il modello’, 2014. Many of the portraits that appear in the Effigies were used in at least one manuscript compendium that included biographies: Mucanzio’s Cardinalium nunc viventium Elogia, complied in 1615 (ASV, Fondo Borghese, ser. IV, 201); for this work, see Cavero de Carondelet, ‘El viaje a Roma de Luis de Oviedo’, 2020. 32 See Tozzi, ‘Libro de’ ritratti’, 2006, and Arnold Witte’s essay in this volume.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nFig. 1.2 Leonardo Parasole, Effigies cum insignibus nominibus, cognominibus, patria, titulis et nuncupationes reverendissimorum […] Cardinalium nunc viventium, 1593, hand-coloured woodcut, London, The British Museum (© The Trustees of the British Museum).\n\n29\n\n30\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\ntheir subjects; a notable example is the volume by the Spanish Dominican, Alfonso Chacón, or Ciacconius, first published in Rome in 1601.33 The wider popularity of and demand for images of cardinals is demonstrated by a large woodcut (nearly A1 in size) containing small portraits of all living cardinals, engraved by Leonardo Parasole and printed by Paolo Blado (Fig. 1.2). Organized in horizontal rows according to nominating pope and clerical ranking, each portrait was carved by Parasole on an individual block, so that the image could be regularly updated by the woodcutter and printer, with new cardinals added and the deceased removed.34 In an example of this woodcut dating to 1593, now in the British Museum, the cardinals’ scarlet attire has been hand-coloured, again revealing the importance of their unifying attribute. Finally, alongside independent portraits, cardinals could also be shown together in groups, as demonstrated in the early manuscript illuminations discussed above, reflecting the collective nature of their status. Portraits of cardinals also began to be incorporated into large-scale, painted historical narratives decorating the interiors of public and private buildings, both in and outside of Rome. In such images, cardinals often seem to be ‘role playing’ in scenes celebrating their papal or familial patrons, such as the well-known fresco in the Vatican by Melozzo da Forli of Sixtus IV Appointing Platina, where the two papal nephews stand behind the pope.35 This image underscores the dynastic ambitions of the pope, and indeed such group portraits frequently reflect the nepotistic set of relations that characterized the papacy in the period.36 However, larger scenes incorporating many figures of cardinals often reflect broader networks operating within the Sacred College. In many such cases individual cardinals’ names have been forgotten. It is occasionally possible to rediscover their identities through pictorial and historical evidence.37 Such identifications often shed light on the political alliances or theological sympathies of certain factions within the Curia at a given moment.\n\nCardinals and Sculpture As with other categories of portraiture, cardinals’ portraits were also executed in a variety of sculpted forms. While painted or illuminated portraits were often high-status products intended for an elite audience, the production of medallic portraits, like engravings, ensured a wide dissemination of cardinals’ images. 33 Chacón, Vitae et res gestae, 1601. 34 Bury, Print in Italy, 2002, pp. 156–157. 35 Clark, Melozzo da Forlí, 1990, pp. 21–41; see also Philippa Jackson’s essay in this volume. 36 For the case of Venetian cardinals, who tended to come only from certain families, see Sarah Ferrari in this volume. 37 See the essays by Alessandra Pattanaro and Irene Brooke in this volume.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nFig. 1.3 Francesco Francia, Cardinal Francesco degli Alidosi, 1505-1511, bronze, New York, Metropolitan Museum (© The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Robert Lehmann Collection, 1975).\n\nThese were usually executed by goldsmiths within the papal mint to celebrate an individual’s elevation to the cardinalate; however, wealthy cardinals might also memorialize specific events by commissioning finer specimens, like that of Cardinal Francesco degli Alidosi, whose portrait medal attributed to Francesco Francia, probably commemorated his appointment as papal legate to Bologna in 1508 (Fig. 1.3).38 Close to and rapidly promoted by Julius II, Alidosi followed the pope’s lead in exploiting the portrait medal’s potential as a propagandistic tool, at once glorifying the church and self.39 The reverse of Alidosi’s medal, showing Jupiter brandishing thunderbolts in his eagle-drawn cart above the god’s star signs, Sagittarius and Pisces, claims a favourable astrological prognostication for the cardinal’s career. Such overtly pagan imagery was rare on cardinals’ medals, which usually feature Christian or allegorical symbols. 40 In the fervid religious climate 38 Warren, ‘Francesco Francia’, 1999, pp. 217–218; Pollard, Renaissance Medals, 1987, p. 226, no. 211; for Alidosi, see De Caro, ‘Alidosi, Francesco’, 1960. 39 For Julius II’s medals, see Weiss, ‘Medals of Pope Julius II’, 1965, and Fishburne, ‘Casting an Ecclesiastical Prince’, 2014. 40 Although a complete study of cardinals’ medals is lacking in the scholarship, a useful table of cardinal medals in the British Museum, and their reverse imagery, can be found in Hendrickson, ‘Bronze Portrait\n\n31\n\n32\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nafter Trent, posthumous medals bearing images of cardinals deemed particularly holy, like Carlo Borromeo, could become venerated items and even assume agency as miracle-performing objects. 41 The posthumous image and ‘memoria’ of a cardinal was frequently fashioned through a sculpted effigy or portrait on a funerary monument.42 In fifteenth-century Rome, several cardinals were memorialized through recumbent effigies placed on top of sarcophagi within vertical, wall-mounted monuments of a type established by non-native sculptors like Andrea Bregno. 43 Employing a triumphalist, all’antica vocabulary, such works more often communicate the cardinal’s identity through an epigraph, coat of arms, or symbols of his office, rather than a specific likeness or even dress. Occasionally, however, a more individualized portrait might be included within a relief decorating the monument, as in the case of Cardinal Pietro Riario’s tomb in Santissimi XII Apostoli. The much more elaborate early sixteenth-century monuments of Cardinals Ascanio Sforza and Girolamo Basso della Rovere, designed by Andrea Sansovino in Santa Maria del Popolo, follow the triumphal arch, wall-mounted model, but turn the reclining effigy of the dead cardinal on his side, with head supported by his elbow; Panofsky identified this pose occurring first in Spanish tombs, though ultimately it harks back to Etruscan models.44 Although the outward-facing effigy allowed for a more complete rendering of physiognomic details, the cardinals are still depicted deceased, with idealized features.45 Wearing pontificals rather than choir dress, as was typical, the cardinals’ status is designated by the form of the monument, as well as by the galero crowning their coats of arms. The similarity in type and ornamentation of these two tombs further asserts a shared social and political network.46 In the years following the Council of Trent (1545–1563), wall-mounted, architectonic monuments more often incorporated a portrait bust rather than a recumbent effigy, showing the cardinal still alive and in his red mozzetta, though often with head bare. In many portraits of this kind, such as those of Cardinal Francisco de Toledo (Fig. 13.1) and Cardinal Mariano Pierbenedetti in Santa Maria Maggiore Medal’, 2017. 41 See Minou Schraven’s essay in this volume. 42 For a discussion of cardinals’ tombs and their important role in establishing ‘memoria’ see Zitzlperger, ‘Cardinals’ Tombs’, 2020; for the distinction between effigies and portraits, see Lavin, ‘On the Sources and Meaning of the Renaissance Portrait Bust’, 1970, pp. 211–212, and Luchs, ‘Verrocchio and the Bust of Albiera degli Albizzi’, 2012, p. 83. 43 For cardinals’ tombs in Rome see Richardson, Reclaiming Rome, 2009, and the same author’s essay in this volume, as well as Zitzlsperger, ‘Cardinals’ Tombs’, 2020, and Ruggero, ‘Magnificenza cardinalizia’, 2006; for Bregno’s Roman oeuvres, see Caglioti, ‘Sui primi tempi romani’, 1997. 44 Panofsky, Tomb Sculpture, 1964, pp. 81–82.

Such costly sculpted busts could be substituted by painted images on hard stone, like Domenichino’s portrait of Girolamo Agucchi, which crowns the cardinal’s monument in San Pietro in Vincoli; here Domenichino recycled the official portrait of Agucchi that he had executed while the cardinal was still alive. 48 This ‘lifelike’ portrait, characterized by the cardinal’s intense, penetrating gaze, is a fitting culmination to a tomb which, positioned within Agucchi’s titular church, promotes his secular memory, recording a network of patronal and familial ties. 49 Finally, although sculpted portraits of cardinals are most often found on funerary monuments, independent sculpted busts depicting living cardinals began to come into favour especially in the seventeenth century.50 Related to sixteenth-century papal models like Gugliemo della Porta’s c.1546 marble bust of Paul III (Naples, Museo di Capodimonte), the iconography of such portraits again underscores the cardinal’s relationship to the pope and his place within the hierarchy the church.51 In early seventeenth-century Rome, Bernini revolutionized this type of portrait with his famous bust of Scipione Borghese (Rome, Galleria Borghese; Fig. 1.4). In this work the artist captures physiognomic details precisely and creates a likeness so lifelike that critics have, since its execution, remarked on the fact that the sitter appears to be ‘speaking’.52 This bust would in turn influence Bernini’s later papal portraiture, a genre which he transformed by replacing the pope’s cope with the mozzetta; in doing so Bernini was following the tradition of painted portraits established by Raphael’s Julius II, which, as observed, formed the fundamental basis for the typology of cardinal portraits.53 47 Ruggero, ‘Magnificenza cardinalizia’, 2007, pp. 45–46; see the essays of Thomas-Leo True and Piers Baker-Bates in this volume. 48 Spear, Domenichino, 1982, p. 137, no. 14. 49 The execution of the tomb was overseen by the cardinal’s younger brother who was a protector of the artist and had promoted his interests with the cardinal; see Ginzburg Carignani, ‘Domenichino e Giovanni Battista Agucchi’, 1996. 50 For the general development of independent portrait busts in the fifteenth and sixteenth century see Lavin, ‘On the Sources and Meaning of the Renaissance Portrait Bust’, 1970; Schuyler, Florentine Busts, 1976; and Martin, Alessandro Vittoria. 51 See Gramberg, ‘Gugliemo dalla Portas Grabmal für Paul III’, 1984, and Caldwell, ‘Knowing Likeness’, 2018. 52 Wittkower, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, 1955, p. 194, no. 31; Coliva, ‘Scipione Borghese’, 1998; Zitzlsperger, ‘Der Papst’, 2001; Bacchi and Hess, ‘Creating a New Likeness’, 2008, p. 20. 53 Bacchi and Hess, ‘Creating a New Likeness’, pp. 34–36.\n\n33\n\n34\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nFig. 1.4 Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, 1632, marble, Rome, Galleria Borghese (© Galleria Borghese).\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nFig. 1.5 Unknown artist, Cardinal Reginald Pole, 1540s, oil on canvas, St Petersburg, The State Hermitage Museum (© The State Hermitage Museum, photo by Leonard Kheifets).\n\nIndividual versus Collective Identity In examples as spectacular as Bernini’s portraits of Cardinal Borghese, the relationship between sitter and artist inevitably obtrudes. As with all types of portraiture, such outstanding works assume heightened worth through the fame of the artist, as well as the prestige of the sitter, and have therefore garnered\n\n35\n\n36\n\nPiers Baker-Bates and Irene Brooke\n\nthe most scholarly attention.54 The fascination with historical personalities has frequently led to the neglect of portraits in which either the sitter or artist, or both, are unknown. There survive numerous cardinal portraits, many of superb quality, of which this is true. Two elevated examples are the portraits of Cardinal Reginald Pole in the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg (Fig. 1.5) and of Cardinal Marcello Cervini in the Galleria Borghese, Rome. Both men were important members of the Sacred College, but the painters of their imposing portraits can no longer be named with certainty.55 Even less studied are numerous images in which neither cardinal nor artist can now be identified. Especially after the Council of Trent (1545–1563), a flood of cardinal images, often of low quality and across all media, were produced; the value of these rested not on any intrinsic artistic worth but on the inherent importance and status of the cardinal within the Catholic Church. Despite the scholarly neglect of such works in the literature (both art historical and historical), clearly these images circulated widely. They therefore provide crucial visual evidence that testifies to the diverse roles that cardinals and their images could assume, functionally in terms of their office and duties, and propagandistically in terms of ideology.56 Richard Brilliant has observed that ‘portraits make value judgments not just about the specific individual portrayed but about the general worth of individuals as a category’.57 This assertion certainly applies to cardinal portraits as a subgenre within portraiture. The breadth and frequency of cardinal portraits clearly reveal the societal estimation of cardinals as a category of individuals. Thus, this volume considers both the development of the individual cardinal portrait and the significance of visual representations of the collective identity comprised by the Curia. This shift of emphasis indeed reflects the larger history of the Sacred College, as explored by Miles Pattenden in the following chapter.\n\n54 For this phenomenon see Woodall, ed., Portraiture, 1997. 55 The stunning portrait of Cardinal Pole has over the years been attributed to almost every major Roman artist of the first half of the sixteenth century; for a summary of attributions see Hirst, Sebastiano del Piombo, 1981, pp.120–121; for the attribution to Perino del Vaga see Romani, ‘Piero Buonaccorsi, detto Perino del Vaga, Ritratto del cardinale Reginald Pole’, 2005. 56 See Arnold Witte’s contribution to this volume. 57 Brilliant, Portraiture, 1991.\n\nPortraying the Princes of the Church\n\nBibliography Bacchi, Andrea and Catherine Hess, ‘Creating a New Likeness’, in Bernini and the Birth of Baroque Sculpture, ed. by Andrea Bacchi, Catherine Hess, and Jennifer Montagu (Los Angeles/Ottawa: J.

It engages recent historiography to explain how the cardinal’s function and role in the Roman Curia, including his relationship to the pope, developed from the f ifteenth century onwards, and how this was reflected in the range of men who occupied the cardinal’s office. The Sacred College changed substantially over these centuries, with its proud ‘princes of the Church’ giving way to an altogether humbler breed of Counter-Reformation cleric. Naturally, this affected both how cardinals depicted themselves and how they and others used their depictions. Keywords: cardinals; popes’ portraiture; Renaissance; Counter-Reformation\n\n‘The Cardinal’ is among the most visual archetypes in European history. His rich red robes and ostentatious headgear betoken the leadership which the pope vests in him; his airs of primordial authority and sacerdotal noblesse instinctively draw the eye. Even an art historical layman can identify a cardinal immediately from the cut and colour of his cloth: scarlet, crimson, carmine, vermilion, ruby – even, as in the famous bespectacled portrait of Fernando Niño de Guevara (Plate 12), rosé – the shade of red matters not, for the association of iconography and office is so strong. Cardinals thus, ironically, would seem to enjoy a more straightforward visual identity than the popes whom they faithfully served – the pope’s costume, by contrast, manifesting itself in rather more variable shades and emblematic designs than those available to his mere electors. Yet the single factor of colour has come to be so meaningful with the cardinal that it can feel as if almost the only filter through which to glimpse him. To delve deeper into who cardinals were, and why they mattered, we have to push past this primary association to interrogate\n\nBaker-Bates, P. and I. Brooke (eds.), Portrait Cultures of the Early Modern Cardinal. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2021 doi 10.5117/9789463725514_ch02\n\n44\n\nMiles Pattenden\n\nthe somewhat broader palette with which this extraordinarily varied group of individuals put a gloss on their lives. Over 1,200 men became cardinals between 1417 and the end of the eighteenth century and many discharged their roles and responsibilities as porporati quite differently. A cardinal’s core duties in this period may have been to serve as a papal elector and counsellor, but many cardinals were also pastors or politicians, inquisitors or diplomats, saints, sinners, bureaucrats, and patrons of the arts. Some cardinals even became kings; a majority were involved in governing the wider Church in other ways, for example as protectors of orders, confraternities, crowns, and nations. The complexity of the roles which cardinals adopted, and the sheer range of identities which might flow from them, therefore make cardinals important figures of study not just for ecclesiastical historians but also for scholars of culture, politics, and society at large. The cardinal’s positional versatility helped in particular to ensure that he and his peers became the subjects of a large body of portraiture, which thus now needs to be interpreted and set in context. The remaining essays in the present volume do this for a specific case or cases, in relation to a particular image, cardinal, or portrayer of cardinals. This chapter enhances their approach by doing something different: it sets those discussions in context with an overview of the cardinal as a phenomenon. How the concept of a cardinal developed, what issues it raised within the early modern Church (and society), and what implications that had for the cardinal’s portraiture in the wide variety of forms which it took are thus questions which inform discussion in the pages below.\n\nTHe Development of the Cardinal What then is a cardinal? The question has never been all that easy to answer. And, indeed, one reason that we seem to recognize cardinals more for how they look than for what they do is that their precise function within the Church – including the range of powers and responsibilities which flow from it – has been the subject of intense debate and complex evolution for hundreds of years, including well into the early modern period. The word ‘cardinal’ does not appear in the early Church’s lexicon, emerging only at some point towards the middle of the first millennium. Leo IX (1049–1054) postulated that cardinals were the hinges (cardines) on which the great door of the ecclesia universalis swung. But Leo did not specify in detail what that meant in practice.1\n\n1\n\nKuttner, ‘Cardinalis’, 1945, p. 176.\n\nThe Early Modern Cardinal\n\nLeo’s cardinals were simply those clergy who assisted him in performing his episcopal duties around Rome, and they consisted of three kinds: deacons, priests, and bishops. Cardinal-deacons distributed papal alms in each of the city’s districts (rioni), but cardinal-priests deputized for the pontiff in its great basilicae, while cardinal-bishops each held title to one of the seven suburbicarian dioceses subordinated to the pope’s own (Ostia, Albano, Frascati, Palestrina, Sabina, Silva Candida, and Velletri). Only in 1059, when Nicholas II elevated these three orders of clerics to the august position of papal electors, was a process by which they came together into one ‘College’ truly set in motion. The term ‘Sacred College’ was first used to signify the cardinals as collective only at the Council of Rheims in 1148.2 And yet the relationship of these three orders to each other, and to the pope himself, remained unclear even then. Only in 1179, for instance, did Alexander III effectively combine them into a single body, when he established that all individual cardinals would hold equal status when it came to the crucial duty of choosing his successor.3 The question of what further rights cardinals’ involvement in the election conferred on them individually remained a matter of canonical conjecture throughout the remaining Middle Ages. 4 In practical terms a particular cardinal’s capacity to vote certainly gave him a wide opening to construct a patronage network with himself at the centre. But did the cardinal’s role in choosing the pope also give him his own legal authority within the Church independent of the pope’s? There were those who argued that it did, at least as expressed at a corporate level. The matter was of no little significance since many cardinals aspired explicitly to the idea that their College formed a sort of ‘senate of the Church’ which could supervise the pope and perhaps even constrain him. In 1378 a group of cardinals actually put this to the test when they repudiated Urban VI’s election and withdrew to Avignon to elect a replacement.5 The Great Schism which followed lasted for nearly 40 years. Early modernity was thus a time in which the role of the cardinal was closely contested – something reflected in the wide variety of contexts in which the cardinal came to be visualized – but it was also the moment when that cardinalatial role came to be defined far more closely than hitherto. The Great Schism had pitted the cardinals’ rights against the pope’s – to the benefit only of conciliarism, a rival constitutional theory for the Church to papalism that posited the Church to be a congregation of the faithful governed not by the pope but by a council of its senior 2 Molien, ‘Sacré College’, 1924–1935, p. 990. 3 On the history of the cardinals’ voting rights in the papal election, see Colomer and McLean, ‘Electing Popes’, 1998, and Pattenden, Electing the Pope, 2017, pp. 56–67. 4 On debates about the cardinals’ status vis-à-vis the pope, see Pattenden, Electing the Pope, 2017, pp. 13–14, 21–22; and, in greater detail, Robinson, Papacy, 1990, pp. 33–120. 5 On the Western Schism and its causes see Weiß’s recent survey of historiographical debate on this, ‘Luxury and Extravagancy at the Papal Court’, 2009.\n\n45\n\n46\n\nMiles Pattenden\n\nmembers. Papal fortunes, and therefore by extension those of the cardinals, were at a low ebb when the Council of Constance (1414–1418) dissolved the then three extant papal obediences and reinstituted a new unified papacy under Martin V. Yet the fifteenth century saw a series of decisive developments in both cardinals’ prominence and standing which paved the way for their later celebrity. The pope’s return to Rome in 1420 unleashed new opportunities for ambitious men of letters and would-be administrators to prove their mettle in his service. At the same time, new elites (both within Italy and beyond) wanted access to the Church’s wider wealth to aid their social advancement: they too invested in cardinals’ hats as a form of papal association – with the result that the College became more dynamic (in the sense of a higher turnover of personnel) and better connected: it was now linked to structures which distributed power locally through secular society. Many of the new f ifteenth-century cardinals saw themselves as veritable ecclesiastical ‘princes’ who had a duty to exhibit, depict, and even flaunt their magnificenza.6 Jean Jouffroy (c.1412–1473), a Burgundian French cardinal, certainly held so, arguing with no apparent irony that cardinals simply must deserve great wealth because of their heavy responsibilities.7 Other theorists of the cardinalate – most notably Paolo Cortesi – concurred in more general terms. Cortesi’s text regrettably still languishes only in its original sixteenth-century edition, a sign of the lack of attention given to study of the cardinal’s office rather than the specific men who occupied it.8 Nevertheless, Cortesi recommended that all cardinals should enjoy an income of 12,000 ducats per annum. Tellingly, Cortesi also divided his treatise De Cardinalatu into three books centred on each of the cardinal’s distinct spheres of activity as Homo Ethicus et Contemplativus, Oeconomicus, and Politicus. Few contemporaries dissented – though the humanist cardinal, Iacopo Ammannati Piccolomini (1422–1479), perhaps came closest: he wrote a letter to his young colleague Francesco Gonzaga exhorting him to make himself learned in law, theology, and history, but never to indulge in unnecessary pomp nor ornamentation.9 Yet even Ammannati seems to have viewed the College as fundamentally that same venerable ‘senate’ admired by other theorists for its collective experience and wisdom, and 6 The concept of magnificence ultimately goes back to Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 4.2, 1122a 23. Magnificence in this period has been widely studied, for instance Fraser Jenkins, ‘Cosimo de’ Medici’s Patronage of Architecture’, 1970; Burke, Fabrication of Louis XIV, 1992; Keay, Magnificent Monarch, 2008; Sharpe, Selling the Tudor Monarchy, 2009; Griffey, Henrietta Maria, 2015. On other aspects of the cardinal’s magnificenza besides portraiture, see D’Amico and Weil-Garris, ‘Renaissance Cardinal’s Ideal Palace’, 1980; Oberli, Magnificentia Principis, 1999, pp. 21–39; the essays included in Hollingsworth and Richardson, eds., Possessions of a Cardinal, 2010; and Schirg, ‘Cortese’s Ideal Cardinal?’, 2017. 7 Märtl, Kardinal Jean Jouffroy, 1996, pp. 194–207. 8 Cortesi, De Cardinalatu, 1510; Chambers, ‘Treatises on the Ideal Cardinal’, 2020. 9 Ammannati, Lettere 1444–1479, 1997, pp. 190–202, no. 363; see also Pellegrini, ‘Da Iacopo Ammannati Piccolomini a Paolo Cortesi’, 1998.\n\nThe Early Modern Cardinal\n\nits sanction to speak truth unto the pope, guiding his decision-making. If we had more portraits of members from the mid-fifteenth-century College, that is doubtless how they would be depicted, for it is how the cardinals of this era choreographed themselves within ritual spaces such as the conclave when they performed a solemn ceremony: signing electoral capitulations by which they promised to limit their power over the College in the event of their own election as pope. Massimo Firpo once wrote of ‘the Cardinal’ as one of a small body of ‘Renaissance Characters’ – alongside ‘the Prince’, ‘Condottiere’, ‘Courtier’, ‘Philosopher’, ‘Merchant’, ‘Artist’, ‘Woman’, and ‘Native’ – as a personality which had ‘animated this decisive moment in the genesis of the modern mind’.10 Fifteenth-century cardinals nevertheless still faced an uphill battle to realize the ideal form they had constructed for themselves in practice and to assert their ambitions vis-à-vis the pope’s. The basic problem went back to Constance, which had set a worrying precedent for cardinals when the Council’s delegates had sat alongside them to elect Martin V. Without their exclusive right to choose the pope what status and power could cardinals have? But how could they hope to retain that right if they confronted the pope, as their fourteenth-century predecessors had done to Urban VI, and caused another schism? Fifteenth-century popes recognized the bind in which their cardinals now found themselves and saw little reason to honour any commitments made to them. They used the papacy’s growing resources, and the burgeoning demand for red hats, to overwhelm dissenters within the College by sheer force of numbers. The size of the College thus rose steadily throughout this period, from a low of just 16 in 1439 to a high of 76 in 1565.11 Naturally, this proved a boon for those who made their living painting cardinals’ likenesses, but the cardinals themselves were collectively disaffected by this development. They objected regularly, with Ludovico Trevisan’s outburst to Pius II telling, if not characteristic: ‘I am ashamed to sit in this place which every man thinks due him […] [for] You have named a number whom I would not have as servants in my kitchen or stable.’12 Emily O’Brien, not unreasonably, sees this as part of a ‘crisis of the fifteenth-century papacy’ which threatened to bring down the entire intellectual scaffolding that popes relied on to prop up their authority.13 Later cardinals continued to criticize every major new promotion in similar terms: for instance, when Sixtus V announced the creation of new cardinals in 1588 the existing ones expressed such discontent that, allegedly, he could hardly 10 Firpo, ‘Cardinal’, 1991. 11 Pellegrini, ‘Il Sacro Collegio Cardinalizio’, 2013, p. 322. 12 Meserve and Simonetta, eds., Pius II: Commentaries, 2007, pp. 229–230. 13 O’Brien, Commentaries of Pope Pius II, 2015.\n\n47\n\n48\n\nMiles Pattenden\n\nmake himself heard above their braying.14 Money was a factor in such squabbles, of course. In 1500, most cardinals derived a majority of their income from grants from the Apostolic Treasury – grants which added up to around 10 per cent of papal income and were shared equally but were nevertheless still not sizeable enough to support the lifestyle to which many cardinals aspired.15 Some cardinals increasingly supplemented their core collegiate income with sums derived from benef ices, which Barbara Hallman has shown could be quite large. Hallman estimated that cardinals received 305,000 ducats from this source in 1523 – but the fact that cardinals could not easily discharge the duties attached to their benef ice(s) increasingly brought the College into disrepute and attracted opprobrium in the fevered times of the 1520s and 1530s.16 Many cardinals throughout the century thus remained surprisingly poor and most lived day-to-day on vast lines of credit.17\n\nCardinals in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries Historians of the College in the sixteenth century have reached a consensus that this period witnessed the slow extinction of any ‘senatorial’ or ‘princely’ status cardinals might have had before (with a concomitant impact on how cardinals sought to depict themselves and be visualized). Paolo Prodi, who remains the most notable scholar to write on this subject, argued in his Sovrano pontefice that the impulse to reform lay behind this: Adrian VI (1522–1523) and most subsequent popes pursued policies to subordinate the Sacred College entirely to their authority – they hoped to refashion it into something less open to criticism from local churches.18 Other scholars, notably Marco Pellegrini and Jennifer DeSilva, have seen the rise of popes’ imperial and absolutist pretensions as an equally important factor, with crucial developments occurring during Alexander VI’s and Julius II’s ‘regal’ pontificates.19 Maria Teresa Fattori, in a work of detailed archival reconstruction, has shown just how far this process had progressed by the pontificate of Clement VIII: Clement was 14 Pastor, History of the Popes, 1891–1953, vol. 4, p. 410; vol. 5, p. 534; vol. 6, pp. 220–222; vol. 9, pp. 141 and 201–202; vol. 21, pp. 239–241. 15 Antonovics, ‘Late Fifteenth-Century Division Register’, 1967, pp. 95–96; on cardinals’ f inancial problems, see also Chambers, ‘Economic Predicament of Renaissance Cardinals’, 1966; Chambers, Renaissance Cardinal and his Worldly Goods, 1997, pp. 37–49; and Chambers, ‘Renaissance Cardinalate: From Paolo Cortesi’s De cardinalatu to the Present’, 2010; Byatt, ‘Cardinals’ Property and Income’, 2020. 16 Hallman, Italian Cardinals, 1985, p. 64. 17 Chambers, ‘Economic Predicament of Renaissance Cardinals’, 1966, pp. 305–308. 18 Prodi, Papal Prince, 1987, pp. 80–91. 19 DeSilva, ‘Senators or Courtiers’, 2008; Pellegrini, ‘Turning-point in the History of the Factional System’, 2002; Pellegrini, ‘Das Kardinalkolleg von Sixtus IV’, 2011; Pellegrini, ‘Il Sacro Collegio Cardinalizio’, 2013.\n\nThe Early Modern Cardinal\n\nsaid to dominate the College so utterly that, in the words of the Venetian ambassador Paolo Paruta, the cardinals openly ‘lamented their loss of every authority. [and] of almost every liberty’.20 Clement, like Sixtus V before him, certainly used a range of controlling behaviours, including financial sanctions and threats of violence, to silence dissent and to reshape the role of his subordinates. Developments such as these could have powerful political impacts – but they did not always impact on how, or how often, cardinals were depicted, in part because the College was never truly rendered voiceless or unimportant at all. Cardinals lost some corporate power but their individual agency hardly suffered the same fate (an observation with further implications for their portraiture in the seventeenth century).21 Antonio Menniti Ippolito has made the point that popes who innovated in order to centralize power in their own hands often found that their actions ended up dispersing it across the papal Curia in ways they had not anticipated. One effect of this was to create space for particular cardinals to establish themselves as powerful players in major congregations, and the Curia’s long history was thus generally one of ‘discontinuous continuity’, in which institutions created by one pope were later adapted by his successors’ cardinals for quite different purposes (or else subjected to processes of creative destruction).22 Late sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cardinals were not so inconsequential after all, and, by a variety of means, wanted to show the world that this was the case. ‘Reform’ in the mid-sixteenth century also played an important role in changing the cardinal’s role – and, after Trent, many cardinals adjusted their aspirations and images to a whole series of new realities, both ideological and political. Hubert Jedin, who thought the cardinals got more religious on the whole, wrote of a ‘clericalization of the Sacred College’.23 Atis Antonovics, who has published a briefer assessment in English, stresses a similar re-profiling of the College’s membership over this time.24 Cardinals of this generation, and the one that followed, were certainly more pious than those who went before them – they included such illustrious names as the future saints Michele Ghislieri (Pius V), Carlo Borromeo, Roberto Bellarmine; the venerable Cesare Baronio; other distinguished reforming bishops like Gabriele Paleotti and Federico Borromeo; the inquisitors Giovanni Fachinetti and Giulio Antonio Santori; and the future reforming pope Gregory XV, Alessandro Ludovisi. These prelates were also, arguably, a more ‘moral’ group: far fewer admitted to such sins as fathering illegitimate children than their late fifteenth- or early 20 Paruta, in Alberì, Relazioni, 1839–1863, vol. 4, pp. 413–414; Fattori, Clemente VIII e il Sacro Collegio, 2004. 21 Pattenden, Electing the Pope, 2017, pp. 209–210. 22 Menniti Ippolito, Il governo dei papi, 2007, p. 19. 23 Jedin, ‘Analekten zur Reformtätigkeit’, 1935, p. 125. 24 Antonovics, ‘Counter-Reformation Cardinals’, 1972.\n\n49\n\n50\n\nMiles Pattenden\n\nsixteenth-century predecessors.25 Church historians who now recorded their roles as part of the endeavour of ‘sacred history’ certainly saw them as such.26 This reversion to the cardinal as a figure of righteousness had important effects on both Curia and Church, giving a powerful push to various devout initiatives of various kinds. Treatises on the ‘ideal’ cardinal proliferated. Moreover, unlike earlier Renaissance texts, these new tracts depicted cardinals as functionaries and servants who needed to exemplify holiness and prudence. The Jesuit Girolamo Piatti’s De cardinalis dignitate et officio, published in 1602, typifies this: it calls specific attention to the moral characteristics a holder of this office now needed – not just prudence, but also fortitude, restraint, and erudition (especially in oratory).27 Of course, we can push a narrative of the College’s spiritual regeneration too far: the fact that Carlo Borromeo was later among the most devout of cardinals does not, for instance, obscure the fact that he was first promoted as a callow youth of eighteen. In fact, such ‘underage’ cardinals were as well represented within the College in the century after 1550 as they were in the one before.28 Yet, something surely changed, if not in how all cardinals behaved then at least in terms of the norms that were established for their behaviour. Cardinals were in general depicted differently, as a culture of post-Tridentine piety emerged within the College’s membership, competing – and co-existing – with those earlier developments like Italianization and the evolution of those patron–client networks. Scholars who study the College’s changing demography in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries have also noted other patterns, not least one of oligarchic consolidation within the Italian group, which intensified after 1500 (and especially after 1600) in several important ways and reshaped the networks and factions around which curial politics was built.29 Christoph Weber, whose work ranks alongside that of Barbara McClung Hallman and Maria Antonietta Visceglia as the most important in this respect, has noted the growing intensity of social connections and relational ties which increasingly bound much of the College’s membership together.30 Seventy per cent of cardinals from this period were Italian but 114 of 25 Weber, Senatus Divinus, 1996, pp. 36–43. 26 Key works here include Chacón, Vitae, et res gestae pontificum romanorum et S.R.E. Cardinalium, 1601, and its various continuations; Palazzi, Fasti Cardinalium, 1703; and Cardella, Memorie storiche de’ cardinali, 1792–1797. See Pattenden and Witte, ‘Early Modern Historiography of Early Modern Cardinals’, 2020. 27 Piatti, De cardinalis dignitate, 1602, pp. 57, 70, 77, 85, 130. 28 DeSilva, ‘Politics and Dynasty: Underage Cardinals’, 2017, p. 90. 29 Visceglia, ‘Factions in the Sacred College’, 2002; Emich, Bürokratie und Nepotismus, 2001; Reinhard, ed., Römische Mikropolitik unter Papst Paul V. Borghese, 2004; Pattenden, Electing the Pope, 2017, pp. 195–204. Eubel et al., eds., Hierarchia Catholica, 1898–, is also an important reference work for reconstructing the College’s composition from the fifteenth century onwards. 30 Weber, Senatus Divinus, 1996; Hallman, Italian Cardinals, 1985; Visceglia, ‘Social Background and Education of Cardinals’, 2020; Broderick, ‘Sacred College of Cardinals’, 1987, pp. 43–47; Reinhard, ‘Struttura e significato del sacro collegio’, 1988; DeSilva, ‘Red Hat Strategies’, 2011.\n\nThe Early Modern Cardinal\n\nthem (9.9 per cent) – a truly striking number – were direct descendants of one or more of the Renaissance popes who acknowledged children (Innocent VIII, Alexander VI, Julius II, Paul III, Pius IV, Gregory XIII).31 Ten cardinals promoted in these centuries had members of the College for both maternal and paternal uncles and another thirteen also entered it after one of their relatives had married into the papal family.32 A small number of important families, including the Caetani, Carafa, Colonna, d’Este, Farnese, Gonzaga, Medici, Orsini, and Savelli dominated overall. These developments in themselves may go some way to explaining why so many cardinals acquired or inherited portraits of each other – the subject of Thomas-Leo True’s chapter – and why they maintained them within broader collections. Portrait collections were a way of visualizing – and making manifest – the ever more complex nexus of links within the Sacred College and between its leading members and the wider Italian aristocracy. Certainly, the narrowing of the College’s profile by the eighteenth century was such that, of the 56 cardinals who took part in the conclave of 1721, an astonishing 40 were related to former popes.33 And the College’s Italianization in due course reshaped how the Curia worked – and presented how it worked – in dramatic ways. Not least it meant that most cardinals arrived in office increasingly bound together by a shared training, outlook, and life experience. Italianization also incentivized cardinals in new ways: in particular to propagate, project, and extend wide-reaching client networks among the extended kin they often shared beyond Rome, who may or may not have also been hoping to climb up the curial cursus honorum. Renata Ago, Wolfgang Reinhard, and Maria Antonietta Visceglia have all studied how such networks operated.34 Indeed, Reinhard and Birgit Emich have also both gone still further to show how they developed their own idiosyncratic rhythms and ritualized forms of interaction within the patron–client nexus.35 These networks often made questions of place within Italy, and local and regional identities, as important to cardinals as grand ecclesiological concerns. Notoriously, they also did something else: they allowed Italian elites to dominate papal elections so completely that no non-Italian was elected to the office from 1523 until 1978.36 Later sixteenth- and seventeenth-century cardinals, in spite of – or perhaps because of – such concerns, also assumed a much wider range of duties than earlier generations had taken on before: they had to personify the interests of a diverse 31 Weber, Senatus Divinus, 1996, pp. 243–246. 32 Ibid., pp. 88–90, 97–99. 33 Ibid., p. 124. 34 Visceglia, ‘Factions in the Sacred College’, 2002, p. 116; Ago, Carriere e clientele nella Roma barocca, 1990; Reinhard, ‘Makropolitik und Mikropolitik’, 2008. 35 Reinhard, ‘Papal Power and Family Strategy’, 1991; Emich, Bürokratie und Nepotismus, 2001. 36 On the profiles and identities of popes, see Reinhard, ‘Herkunft und Karriere der Päpste’, 1976.\n\n51\n\n52\n\nMiles Pattenden\n\nand growing range of groups and individuals at the papal court. Odoardo Farnese (1573–1626), for instance, held a large number of protectorships during his career, including of the luoghi pii (holy places), of the Roman brotherhoods of the Orazione e Morte, Santa Maria del Carmine, and San Girolamo della Carità, of the Casa degli Orfanelli, and of the Carthusian, Capuchin, and Camoldoese orders. Arnold Witte has argued that Farnese took his obligations to all these organizations within the Church most seriously, not only leaving them money or precious objects in his will but also visualizing them symbolically in the Camerino degli Eremiti whose decoration he commissioned from Giovanni Lanfranco in 1616.37 Yet some cardinals concentrated on collecting memberships of the Congregations – special ecclesiastical commissions which scrutinized or executed papal policy on the pontiff’s behalf which Sixtus V formalized in 1588.38 Maria Antonietta Visceglia has explained this as driven by each cardinal’s need to maximize his decision-making presence to fulfil obligations to nephews and clients (and thus maintain his own status and prestige).39 In all cases, the more memberships a cardinal had the stronger his motivation to circulate his image and the more vehicles by which he would be able to do so as he sought to put himself and his clients ahead.\n\nCardinals’ Portraits Portraits fit into this story because the changes described above – what we might loosely term the advent of post-Tridentine piety, of Italian identities, and of bureaucratic patron–client networks – all had major impacts on how cardinals understood their role and how they and others wished to represent it. No doubt that is why the editors of this volume structure three of the book’s sections around those subjects as principal themes. But cardinals also evolved in other ways at this time as well (which explains the choices of further themes): for instance, the cardinal’s role as collector was a natural concomitant to his position as patron (and both have certainly been well studied). 40 Moreover, the cardinal was a figure with multiple, often divided, loyalties. 37 Witte, "
