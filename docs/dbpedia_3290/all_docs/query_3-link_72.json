        "text": "Booking required online with Roma Pass at romapass.vivaticket.it\n\nThe ancient history of the area begins at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, when, on the original ground floor consisting of rammed earth and gravel, temple C was built, probably dedicated to the goddess Feronia. This is followed in succession by Temple A (mid-3rd century BC, dedicated to Giuturna), Temple D (early 2nd century BC, dedicated to the Lares Permarini), and Temple B (late 2nd century BC, dedicated to Fortuna huiusce diei). At the same time as the last building, the first floor, made of tufa slabs, was laid, probably after the devastating fire of 111 BC.\n\nOn 20 June 2023, at the end of the works carried out under the scientific direction of the Capitoline Superintendency and made possible thanks to an act of patronage by the Bulgari Maison, the Sacred Area will be reopened to the public, with a new walkway route that for the first time will allow the structures to be appreciated at close range and in a systematic manner.\n\nThe access has also been facilitated for the visually impaired and blind with the creation of two large tactile panels and 3D-scanned exhibits. The archaeological area is accessible to all, even with wheelchair. Toilets not available.\n\nReservation is highly recommended with Roma Pass at romapass.vivaticket.it.\n\nCirco Massimo (Circus Maximus), is the biggest building for shows of all times, it is 600 metres long and 140 metres wide; it is by the legend connected to the origins of the city: in fact during the games in honour of Conso, the rape of the Sabines happened and hence the birth of life in the city. Actually, a first arrangement of Valle Murcia – Murcia was, according to the tradition, the valley’s tutelary deity – it goes back to the age of the Tarquini and it can be connected to the construction of a sewer which permitted the drainage of the whole area and to regularise the ground.\n\nThe equipment was probably not enough for this phase, but subsequently, throughout the centuries, there must have been many works in this area and starting with century II BC, also monumental like per the arch of Stertinio erected in 196 BC, the columns with statues, the support with the ova (marbles) in order to easily count the turns.Only Julius Caesar had a real brickwork constructed and its map is kept, at least partially, in the following constructions as witness the many reticulate works in various points during the excavation. Certainly the intervention of Augustus was of great importance: he completed and restored the hippodrome, he decorated it with the obelisk, which is now in piazza del Popolo, and built the pulvinar.\n\nFor information:\n\ninfo@060608.it\n\nImmersive and multisensory experience in augmented reality, through viewers.\n\nReservation highly recommended with Roma Pass at romapass.vivaticket.it/eng\n\nA place of entertainment and one of the City’s undisputed landmarks, the Circus Maximus comes back to life thanks to an innovative valorisation project using augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR). One of the most relevant monuments in Roman history, the Circus Maximus can for the first time be seen through all its historic phases thanks to a ground-breaking project using interactive display technologies that have never before been used in such an extended outdoor area.\n\nThe headsets available give a virtual rendering of the Circus Maximus by overlapping images of the past to the present-day reality to reconstruct its initial magnificence: in particular, the Arch of Titus will appear in its original majestic height.\n\nThe CIRCO MAXIMO EXPERIENCE, through continuous flashbacks to the past thanks to reconstructions in augmented and virtual reality, will enable you to see the life of the age-old valley unfold before your eyes, stroll through the Roman shops and watch a chariot race among shouts of encouragement and overturned chariots.\n\nThe 40-minute walking itinerary is available in eight languages (Italian, English, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Chinese and Japanese).\n\nThe eight stops are the following: the valley floor of the Circus in the archaic period, the Circus from the 1st century BC to the 1st century AD, the Circus in the imperial period, the seating tiers (cavea), the Arch of Titus, the shops (tabernae), the Circus in the Middle Ages and in modern times and lastly, “A Day at the Circus”. The tour is available with immersive glasses (see-through technology) and stereo audio earphones included in the admission ticket to the “Circo Maximo Experience”.\n\nThe visit is also available for deaf people thanks to simplified subtitles in Italian or English.\n\nIt will not be possible to use the Experience on the first Sundays of the month and on the days with free admission. In case of rain it will not be possible to use the multimedia experience.\n\nwww.circomaximoexperience.i...\n\nRoman Forum-Palatine and Imperial Fora in a single itinerary. One ticket (€16) gives you access to the new route, which allows you to visit the archaeological heart of Rome in about two hours: the Roman Forum, the Imperial Fora and the Palatine.Also included in the ticket is a visit to the SUPER sites, unique places in the world whose special visit allows you to get to the core of Roman art and civilisation through immersive technologies and fascinating virtual narrations. An itinerary through the Roman Forum and the Palatine, connected by the Domitian ramp, which will lead visitors to discover ancient painting from the Augustan age, with the House of Augustus (from Tuesday to Sunday), to the late ancient and early medieval age with the Temple of Romulus, Santa Maria Antiqua and the Oratory of the Forty Martyrs. On Saturday, Sunday and Monday it will also be possible to enter the Curia Iulia, the ancient seat of the Roman Senate.\n\nAccess to the SUPER sites is restricted, as they feature valuable paintings that could be affected by overcrowding. Further information on opening hours.\n\nThe entire route of the visit included in the Forum Pass ticket is barrier-free and will cross part of the Forum of Trajan, pass under Via dei Fori Imperiali through the cellars of the ancient dwellings of the Alessandrino neighbourhood and, after crossing the entire length of the Forum of Caesar, near the Forum of Nerva, reach the Curia to enter the Roman Forum.\n\nFrom May 22nd, the exciting Journeys to Ancient Rome return!\n\nForo of Caesar: Foro di Traiano next to Trajan’s Column\n\nThe tickets can be booked on rompass.vivaticket.it\n\nStones Can Talk and They’ve Got a Lot to Tell Us. The marble blocks still visible in the Forum of Caesar are the starting point for a fascinating tour in discovery of magnificent archaeological sites and a temple that was at the heart of events in Ancient Rome. A tour created by Piero Angela and Paco Lanciano. Visitors will have the chance to see exciting portrayals of life in Ancient Rome, reconstructed within the Imperial Fora using light, images, film and animation. The two reconstructions will be accompanied by a wealth of historic and scientific information, music and a tale by Piero Angela.\n\nFORUM OF CAESAR\n\nIn this part of the tour, visitors walk within the Forum itself and among the marble that remains of this enormous piazza, which at the time was surrounded by majestic colonnades and overshadowed by the imposing temple of Venus Genetrix. The tour explores the role of the Forum in the lives of the Roman people and the figure of Julius Caesar, an intelligent and ambitious man, idolised by some but hated and feared by others.\n\nwww.viaggioneifori.it/en/\n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=W-dCj96YdYc\n\nReservations required on the romapass.vivaticket.itwebsite. The on-site ticket office does not accept electronic payments.\n\nThe largest circular tomb of the ancient world, and an emblem of the architectural magnificence of Roman times, is once again accessible to all.\n\nThe Mausoleum of Augustus, a jewel of the historical heritage of humanity, had been closed since 2007 due to the archaeological investigations preliminary to the realization of the large restoration project.\n\nThe project also provides an innovative multimedia adventure for an even more fascinating and spectacular visiting experience.\n\nThe construction site is still in progress but, thanks to the works carried out so far, the public can visit the central area and access other spaces in total safety.\n\nStarting from 22 April, the visit will be enriched with digital content, in virtual and augmented reality.\n\nThere is a Rome below ground whose existence not many know anything about, that of the “bunkers” or rather underground air raid shelters. Fascist Leader Benito Mussolini had three built: at his private residence of Villa Torlonia, under his office in Piazza Venezia and at Eur (entrance in Piazza Adenauer 8, under Palazzo degli Uffici).\n\nOne singular detail however distinguished the latter from the other two: it was not specifically made for the Duce, but as an emergency shelter for top officials supervising work on the Universal Exhibition, from which the Eur district got its name but in actual fact never took place because of the war.\n\nThe shelter, built between 1937 and 1939, is located 32,9 metres below sea level and covers a surface of around 475 square metres. Designed according to the latest air raid shelter criteria of the time, this refuge would have enabled about 300 people to survive there for at least 4 months.\n\nThe shelter has recently been regularly opened for special events, such as to host exhibitions.\n\nContacts\n\nEmail:info@romaeur.it\n\nWeb Sites:https://www.museivillatorlonia.it/en/node/1014404\n\nTelephone:060608\n\nEntering the Parco Tombe della Via Latina you can walk along a stretch of the original pavement of the ancient road. With a pleasant walk you can admire the rich tombs dating back to the 1st-2nd century A.D. that overlooked the path and that still have perfectly preserved the polychrome decorations on the facades and inside. Among the most interesting monuments you can admire the so-called Sepolcro Barberini, or dei Corneli, the Tomba dei Valeri and the Tomba dei Pancrazi. From the road you can then reach the Basilica of Santo Stefano, a rare example of an early Christian structure built under the pontificate of Leo the Great around the middle of the 5th century."
