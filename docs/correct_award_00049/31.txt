Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (1869-1959, UK) was a Scottish physicist and meteorologist who received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 for his invention of the cloud chamber â€“ a glass container with air and water vapor and ingenious devices that allow traces left by ionizing radiation and particles that pass through the chamber to become visible and be photographed. Wilson studied zoology, botany, and geology in Manchester (UK) and went on to study physics and chemistry at Cambridge University where he also began working on his cloud chamber at Cavendish Laboratory. Wilson remained at Cambridge as a professor of natural philosophy at Sydney Sussex College from 1925.
