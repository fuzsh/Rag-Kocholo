Title-pages bound in, numerous plates. Maroon cloth with \"Physical Papers\" gilt-stamped on each spine; minor kozo repairs. Ownership signatures (in all three vols.) of L.R. Wilberforce, Professor of Physics, London. Very good. WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM JOSEPH JOHN THOMSON [3], JOHN S. TOWNSEND [2], CHARLES THOMSON REES WILSON [3] & 12 PAPERS INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHORS. Remarkable collection of 36 physics papers written by mostly members of the Cavendish Laboratory, including 12 papers which are inscribed to the owner, Lionel Robert Wilberforce, who also worked at the lab. Among the papers are two by J.J. Thomson, winner of the 1906 Nobel Prize for Physics, and Rutherford, who won the 1908 Nobel Prize for Chemistry. One of his papers was a precursor to the first Marconi wireless telegraph and radio stations. Three papers are inscribed by 1927 Nobel Prize winner Charles Thomson Rees Wilson, the inventor of the cloud chamber. CONTENTS: 1. [Volume One]: J.J. Thomson, One Some Applications of Dynamical Principles to Physical Phenomena. 1885. [Sir Joseph John Thomson, (1856-1940) OM PRS was an English physicist and 1906 Nobel laureate in physics, credited with the discovery and identification of the electron; and with the discovery of the first subatomic particle.] // 2. Hugh Longbourne Callendar (1863-1930), On the Practical Measurement of Temperature: experiments made at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. 1887. [\"Callendar made elaborate experiments on this subject at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, in which he compared the platinum resistance thermometer with Regnault's normal air thermometer and from which he deduced that the resistance of a properly made platinum wire can be related to the reading of the air thermometer by a parabolic formula that was accurate within 1 percent.\" :: DSB]. // 3. Ernest Howard Griffiths (1851-1932), On the Determination of Some Boiling and Freezing Points by Means of the Platinum Thermometer. 1891. INSCRIBED by the author. [See: L.B. Hunt, \"The Origin of the Platinum Resistance Thermometer,\" Platinum Metals Rev., 1980, 24, (3), 104]. // 4. Ernest Howard Griffiths; & Hugh Longbourne Callendar, On the Determination of the Boiling-Point of Sulphur, and on a method of standardizing platinum resistance thermometers by reference to it. Cavendish Laboratory. 1891. INSCRIBED by Griffiths, \"E.H.G.\" // 5.
