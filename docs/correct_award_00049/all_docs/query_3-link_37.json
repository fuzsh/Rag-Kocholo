        "text": "What are the causes of the different lines? Why are some thin and straight, while others are thick or wavy?\n\nThe bright thick line is caused by the largest interacting particle by size: it is the interaction of what is called an alpha particle. An alpha particle is a high energy composite particle consisting of two protons and two neutrons together: it’s the nucleus of a helium atom. Given that it is a collection of particles, it is larger than a single small particle, and that is why this line appears bigger and thicker than the other lines seen.\n\nThe second type of line is faint, thin, and can curve and bend as it travels through the chamber. This is caused by a particle called a beta particle. A beta particle can be a high speed electron, or its antiparticle, a high speed positron. You can read more about particles and antiparticles HERE ** link to other theory board beside cloud chamber **. These particles are small and that means the lines we see are fainter than the alpha particles. They also are much easier to have their direction changed due to their small mass, and this is why the bending of their paths occur.\n\nThe final type of line highlighted are those faint, but long streaks that travel in straight lines. These lines are created by particles known as muons. A muon is a fundamental particle that is similar to an electron, but much more massive – about 200 times more massive. The higher mass means that muons bump into the molecules in the cloud chamber but just bludgeon their way through, creating straight tracks. Muons can be created high in the atmosphere as cosmic rays travel through outer space. These rays contain alpha particles and protons, which when they collide with molecules in the atmosphere, can undergo nuclear decay and result in the formation of muons. Interestingly, the life span of muons is incredibly short – only about 2 microseconds! – and so the reason why these particles are able to exist long enough to travel through the atmosphere and long distance down to our detectors is because of relativistic effects. They are travelling fast enough to slow down their internal time, sufficiently long enough that they can reach the detectors and cloud chambers here on Earth’s surface!\n\n&nbsp"
