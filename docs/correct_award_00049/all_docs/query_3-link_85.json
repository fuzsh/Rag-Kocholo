It is home to Ben Nevis, and a number of other excellent mountains to climb. Fort William is the ‘outdoor capital’ of the UK, with an exceptional selection of activities on offer.\n\nThat's not all there is to enjoy in Lochaber ! Knoydart, one of the most remote areas in the UK, is only accessible by walking or ferry, and is not connected to the road network.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe population of Lochaber is approximately 19,000.\n\nGaelic Place names near Lochaber\n\nMany of the mountains around Lochaber have Gaelic names. The most famous of all, Ben Nevis, is called ‘Beinn Nibheis’, which is thought to mean “the terrible or poisonous mountain”. This could be because of the drastic ways in which the weather can change on the mountain, and the risks this presents to climbers.\n\nConnected to Ben Nevis by a ridge is ‘Càrn Mòr Dearg’, or the Big Red Hill. Close to Ben Nevis are ‘Aonach Mòr’ and ‘Aonach Beag’, meaning Big Hill and Small Hill respectively. ‘Aonach Beag is actually taller than Aonach Mòr, although it is smaller in terms of bulk, which is where the names come from.\n\nBack to the top\n\nDid you know?\n\nFort William is the home to the UCI Mountain Biking World Cup, which attracts thousands to the town every year. In 2007, so many people were expected to visit the town that two cruise ships were brought in to help accommodate the spectators.\n\nThe opening sequence for the newest Harry Potter film, ‘Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix’, was shot in Fort William.\n\nIn 1911, an Edinburgh motorist, Henry Alexander, drove a Model “T” Ford up the pony track of Ben Nevis!\n\nBack to the top\n\nLocal heroes\n\nGary Innes\n\nGary Innes is an accordion player from Spean Bridge. He started playing when he was nine, when he began to get lessons. He enjoys a great deal of success, having toured all over Britain, Europe and the USA.\n\nHe has also played live on the Hogmanay celebrations on BBC1, and was in the final 4 of Scotland's Best Up and Coming Musicians at the 2005 Traditional Music Awards. He has a very distinctive and stylish purple accordion!\n\nHe is not only a musician, but also a sporting star, playing shinty for Fort William Shinty Club. Every year there is an international shinty/hurling match between Scotland and Ireland. Gary has played for the Scottish team on numerous occasions.\n\nHe came second in Radio nan Gaidheal’s Sportsman of the Year Award. He is also pictured playing shinty on the cover of Runrig’s latest album; truly bringing his music and shinty together!\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson was born in 1869 in Glencorse, near Edinburgh. Following his father’s death, the family moved to Manchester. There he began studying biology, with the aim of becoming a doctor.\n\nInstead, he went to Cambridge University, where he became interested in physics and chemistry. This sparked in him an interest in meteorology.\n\nHe started to study clouds and their properties, and he worked for a time at the Ben Nevis observatory. Here, he made observations every hour of cloud shapes and formation. The work done there is still important today for determining what the weather will be like on mountains.\n\nHis work on clouds led him to try and recreate certain conditions in the laboratory. For this, he invented the ‘cloud chamber’, a device for studying very small particles. For this invention he won the Nobel Prize in 1927. All of that was made possible because of the time he spent on top of Ben Nevis observing the heavens!\n\nKing Achaius\n\nAchaius was king of the Scots from 787 to 819. One of his main strongholds was Inverlochy Castle. He is said to have done two things of particular note, although whether they are true or not is in doubt.\n\nFirstly, he is said to have made a treaty with Charlemagne, who was the greatest ruler in Europe, controlling vast areas of land, including modern France, Germany and Italy. The Saxons would continuously attack both Charlemagne and Achiaus. Impressed by his ability to resist invasion, Charlemagne visited Achiaus to form a treaty. They agreed that should either be attacked, the other would invade England.\n\nAchiaus is also said to have originally created the Most Noble Order of the Thistle, which is the second highest order of chivalry in Great Britain. He is said to have done this when meeting with Charlemagne, and this could well be likely, as Charlemagne employed Scottish bodyguards.\n\nHe was the grandfather of Kenneth MacAlpin, who was the father of the dynasty which ruled jointly over the Picts and Scots, thereby creating the kingdom of Scotland.\n\nBack to the top\n\nWell known landmarks\n\nRannoch Moor\n\nDriving north on the A82, whether visitor or local resident, you can’t help but be affected by the majesty of the scenery. One of the most striking areas is Rannoch Moor, a vast expanse of boggy moor land which can appear to be incredibly bleak in bad weather and stunning when the sun shines.\n\nIt is home to several plant and animal species rarely located anywhere else in the UK – the Rannoch Rush and the narrow-headed ant, known in Latin as Formica exsecta.\n\nDue to the soft, peaty nature of the environment, the train track which crosses the moor lies on a bed of tree roots, wood, earth and ashes, rather than solid rock!\n\nGlencoe\n\nFurther north than Rannoch Moor, you will enter the stunning, and world-famous, Glencoe. This is one of the most emotive and beautiful places in Scotland, and is forever linked with the events of 12th February 1692.\n\nAs the result of political motivations a government force led by Captain Robert Campbell of Glen Lyon were instructed attack their hosts, the MacDonalds of Glencoe, and their chief MacIain, to “ … put all to the sword under seventy.”\n\nTo this day, people argue about the events and motivations, but it seems that Campbell and his soldiers realised they were pawns in a bigger game – evidence suggests they dropped hints and clues about what was to happen, and their lack of enthusiasm for the task allowed many to escape.\n\nOfficially, forty people died in the massacre, but many who escaped to the hills died of the cold. The Glencoe Massacre, and the murky events surrounding it, remains one of the darkest episodes in British history.\n\nAppin Murder\n\nAnother famous incident which had repercussions in Lochaber, and more widely across the Highlands, was the Appin Murder. Colin Campbell, known as the ‘Red Fox’, was travelling just south of Ballachulish, through the Lettermore Wood when he was shot dead by an unknown assassin in May 1752.\n\nAlthough Alan Breck Stewart was the prime suspect, he had fled the area after the murder. A local man, James Stewart (Seumas a’ Ghlinne) was convicted by jury of 15 men – which included 11 Campbells – and hanged on a small hillock which is now the southern end of the Ballachulish Bridge. A small monument can be seen marking the spot where his body was left to rot as a warning to others.\n\nIt was always believed that James Stewart was innocent, and many theories and rumours about the actual assailant abounded for the next 250 years.\n\nToday, thanks to much exhaustive detective work by historians and academics, it is assumed that the assassin was Donald Stewart of Ballachulish. He fled after the murder and only returned to the area as a very old man. He is believed to have kept his secret for fear that it would incriminate many others and lead to further reprisals against the Jacobite-supporting Stewarts.\n\nThe incident is fictionalised in Robert Louis Stevenson’s famous novel ‘Kidnapped’.\n\nHydroelectric power plant\n\nRunning down the side of Ben Nevis are the famous and easily recognisable pipes of the hydro-electric power station, taking advantage of the high levels of precipitation in the area. This is the last stage of a very long series of pipes. The main source of water is Loch Treig, from which a 24km long and 4.5m wide pipe takes water. Additional water from the surrounding hills is gathered along the way, until it all finally reaches the water turbines at the bottom.\n\nThe water is falling from such a height that 85 megawatts of power can be generated by the power plant. Most of this is used by the Alcan aluminium smelting plant, although there is some power left over which goes to the National Grid.\n\nLong Distance Walks\n\nThe West Highland Way is a 95-mile walk, from Milngavie, north of Glasgow, to Fort William. It is walked by approximately 50,000 people each year, and is the most popular long distance walk in Scotland. It is traditionally walked from south to north.\n\nMost people take seven or eight days to complete the walk, so that the surrounding country side can be fully enjoyed. There are a number of towns along the way where it is possible to spend the night, as well as camp sites for those wanting to sleep outside, whatever the weather.\n\nA race is held along the route each year. The current fastest time for the full distance is 15:44:50, set by Jez Bregg. The fastest female time is 17:37:48, set by Kate Jenkins.\n\nAnother long distance walk is the Great Glen Way. It runs 73 miles through the Great Glen from Inverness to Fort William. It was only officially opened in 2002, although people have been walking the route for much longer.\n\nUnlike the West Highland Way, there is not a ‘start’ and ‘finish’ to this walk, with people starting in either Inverness or Fort William as they see fit. Many people suggest walking from Fort William to Inverness, as this places the sun behind walkers as much as possible. This also allows for the Great Glen Way to link with the West Highland way, resulting in a 168km walk from Glasgow to Inverness.\n\nBack to the top\n\nLocal specialities\n\nFish and Chips!\n\nPeople who travel to Fort William regularly will recommend you go to a chip shop for a meal. Few people will ever direct you to the same one though, and that is because there are a number of very good fish and chip shops in Fort William, all offering really great food!\n\nKippers\n\nMallaig is the main commercial fishing port on the west coast of Scotland, selling fish to all over Europe. In the 1970s it was the main herring port in Europe. It was once famous for traditionally smoked kippers, although only one smoke house remains open today. However, it is still centred on its original industry of fishing, rather than depending on tourism, as many other towns and areas have had to do.\n\nBack to the top\n\nBest time to visit\n\nMany people who visit Lochaber will be interested in climbing Ben Nevis. Because it is so high, the weather can deteriorate rapidly, meaning inexperienced climbers should avoid going up in the winter. The summer offers the best chance for a trouble free walk to new heights, as well as the best chance of a clear day to enjoy the views!\n\nBack to the top\n\nWhat's on\n\nWhat's on\n\nOctober\n\nHere is a pick of upcoming events that our characters would like to recommend for the month ahead!\n\nMelodaidh\n\nWildlife Land Rover Safari\n\n02/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nInternational Guitar Festival\n\n05/10/07 – Glenuig Hall\n\nMorag\n\nGreen Woodworking Workshop\n\n14/10/07-14/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nGlencoe’s Past\n\n18/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nSeanair\n\nJohn Muir Trust on the Ben\n\n03/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nBuddy Holly and the Cricketeers\n\n05/10/07 – Nevis Centre\n\nMunro\n\nMassacre Land Rover Safari\n\n05/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nGlencoe Rocks!\n\n18/10/07 – NTS Visitor Centre, Glencoe\n\nBrochan\n\nLochaber Dog Show\n\n06/10/07-07/10/07 – Nevis Centre\n\nFor further information about Highland 2007 including events and external links please visit www.highland2007.com.\n\nBack to the top\n\nLearn Online\n\nLearn Online\n\nLearn Gaelic at BBC Alba\n\nThe BBC offers an array of online learning tools for the Gaelic beginner.
