        "text": "(1869–1959). Scottish physicist C.T.R. Wilson invented a radiation detector known as the Wilson cloud chamber. It became widely used in the study of radioactivity, X-rays, cosmic rays, and other nuclear phenomena. For this invention, Wilson won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927, along with American physicist Arthur Holly Compton.\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson was born on February 14, 1869, in Glencorse, Midlothian, Scotland. He began studying clouds as a meteorologist in 1895. In an effort to duplicate the effects of certain clouds on mountaintops, Wilson devised a way of expanding moist air in a closed container. The expansion cooled the air so that it became supersaturated (meaning that it could hold more moisture than it would under normal conditions), and moisture condensed on dust particles.\n\nWilson noted that when he used dust-free air the air remained supersaturated. The clouds did not form until the degree of supersaturation reached a certain critical point. Wilson believed that in the absence of dust the clouds formed by condensing on ions (charged atoms or molecules) in the air. Hearing of the discovery of X-rays, Wilson thought that ions formed as a result of such radiation might bring about more intensive cloud formation. He experimented and found that radiation left a trail of condensed water droplets in his cloud chamber. Perfected by 1912, Wilson’s chamber proved indispensable in the study of nuclear physics. It eventually led to the development—by Donald A. Glaser in 1952—of the radiation detector known as the bubble chamber."
