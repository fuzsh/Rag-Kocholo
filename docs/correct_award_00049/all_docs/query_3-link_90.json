In affected persons, copper accumulates in the basal ganglia (see ganglion) of the brain (involved in control of movement), causing progressive degeneration; forms a brownish ring at the margin of the cornea of the eye; and is deposited in the liver, gradually leading to cirrhosis. Other symptoms include tremor, lack of coordination, and personality changes. The disease usually appears in the person's teen years or twenties. Early diagnosis and treatment with a high-protein, low-copper diet and a substance to chelate copper can reverse the effects and prevent permanent brain and liver damage\n\nWilson's Promontory\n\nSouthernmost point of the Australian mainland, southern Victoria. The peninsula, 22 mi (35 km) long with a maximum width of 14 mi (23 km), projects into the Bass Strait and is almost an island. Its highest point is Mount Latrobe (2,475 ft [754 m]). Visited in 1798 by the English explorer George Bass, it was first called Furneaux Land; it was renamed for Thomas Wilson, an English merchant.

He spent 24 years on the University of Chicago faculty before moving to Harvard University in 1996. In The Declining Significance of Race (1978) and The Truly Disadvantaged (1987) he contends that entrenched black poverty stems neither from racism nor from welfare dependency but from changes in the global economy that pull low-skilled manufacturing jobs out of the inner city. In When Work Disappears (1996) he discusses, among other issues, how chronic joblessness erodes work skills. Wilson holds that only \"race neutral\" programs such as universal health care and government-financed jobs can alleviate the problems of black poverty in the inner city\n\nAlexander Wilson\n\nborn July 6, 1766, Paisley, Renfrew, Scot. died Aug. 23, 1813, Philadelphia, Pa., U.S. Scottish-born U.S. ornithologist. In Scotland he wrote poetry while working as a weaver and peddler; in 1792 his satiric works led to a fine and imprisonment. Impoverished, in 1794 he immigrated to the U.S., where he became a teacher. Influenced by William Bartram, he decided 1804 to write on North American birds, and he began studying art and ornithology in his leisure time. His pioneering work American Ornithology (9 vol., 1808-14) established him as a founder of the field. After publication of its first volume, he spent much of his time selling subscriptions for the expensive work and collecting specimens for the remaining volumes\n\nAugust Wilson\n\nborn April 27, 1945, Pittsburgh, Pa., U.S. U.S. playwright. He was largely self-educated. A participant in the black aesthetic movement, he cofounded and directed Pittsburgh's Black Horizons Theatre (1968), published poetry in African American journals, and produced several plays, including Jitney (1982), before his Ma Rainey's Black Bottom opened on Broadway in 1984. Inspired by the colloquial language, music, folklore, and storytelling tradition of African Americans, he continued his cycle of plays, each set in a different decade of the 20th century, with Fences (1986, Pulitzer Prize), Joe Turner's Come and Gone (1988), The Piano Lesson (1990, Pulitzer Prize), Two Trains Running (1992), and Seven Guitars (1996)\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson\n\nborn Feb. 14, 1869, Glencorse, Midlothian, Scot. died Nov. 15, 1959, Carlops, Peeblesshire Scottish physicist. His invention of the Wilson cloud chamber, a device that became widely used in the study of radioactivity, X rays, cosmic rays, and other particle phenomena, also led to the later development of the bubble chamber. He shared the 1927 Nobel Prize for Physics with Arthur Compton\n\nColin Henry Wilson\n\nborn June 26, 1931, Leicester, Leicestershire, Eng. British writer. Born into a working-class family, he initially thought of a career in science, then gravitated toward writing. At age 24 he published The Outsider (1957), a study of 20th-century alienation that had phenomenal success. His next book was dismissed as unoriginal or superficial, but Ritual in the Dark (1960) and Adrift in Soho (1961) helped repair his reputation. Many of his more than 70 books deal with the psychology of crime, the occult, human sexuality, and his own existential philosophy. Alien Dawn (1998) discusses the UFO phenomenon\n\nColin Wilson\n\nborn June 26, 1931, Leicester, Leicestershire, Eng. British writer.

He joined the Columbia University faculty in 1891, where he became established as a pioneer in work on cell lineage (tracing the formation of different kinds of tissues from individual cells). His interests later extended to internal cellular organization and the problem of sex determination, leading to a series of papers (1905) on the role of chromosomes. Recognizing the importance of Gregor Mendel's findings, he realized that the role of chromosomes went far beyond the determination of sex and envisioned their function as important components in heredity as a whole, ideas that were a powerful force in shaping future genetic research\n\nEdmund Beecher Wilson\n\nborn Oct. 19, 1856, Geneva, Ill., U.S. died March 3, 1939, New York, N.Y.

U.S. critic and essayist. He attended Princeton University and initially worked as a reporter and magazine editor. Much of his writing, in which he probed diverse subjects with scholarship and common sense in clear and precise prose, was published in The New Republic and The New Yorker. Among his influential critical works are Axel's Castle (1931), a survey of the Symbolist poets; To the Finland Station (1940), a study of the thinkers who set the stage for the Russian Revolution; and Patriotic Gore (1962), analyzing American Civil War literature. His other writings include plays, poetry, the short-story collection Memoirs of Hecate County (1946), and five volumes of posthumously published journals. He was widely regarded as the leading critic of his time\n\nEdward O Wilson\n\nborn June 10, 1929, Birmingham, Ala., U.S. U.S. biologist. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University, where he taught from 1956. Recognized as the world's leading authority on ants, he discovered their use of pheromone for communication. His The Insect Societies (1971) was the definitive treatment of the subject. In 1975 he published Sociobiology, a highly controversial and influential study of the genetic basis of social behaviour in which he claimed that even a characteristic such as unselfish generosity may be genetically based and may have evolved through natural selection, that preservation of the gene rather than the individual is the focus of evolutionary strategy, and that the essentially biological principles on which animal societies are based apply also to human social behaviour. In On Human Nature (1978, Pulitzer Prize) he explored sociobiology's implications in regard to human aggression, sexuality, and ethics. With Bert Hölldobler he wrote the major study The Ants (1990, Pulitzer Prize). In The Diversity of Life (1992) he examined how the world's species became diverse and the massive extinctions caused by 20th-century human activities. In Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge (1998) he proposed that all of existence can be organized and understood in accordance with a few fundamental natural laws\n\nEdward Osborne Wilson\n\nborn June 10, 1929, Birmingham, Ala., U.S. U.S. biologist.

The son of an industrial chemist, he was educated at the University of Oxford, where he collaborated with William H. Beveridge on work that led to the latter's 1942 report. In World War II he was drafted into the civil service and produced a study of the mining industry. His book New Deal for Coal (1945) was the basis for the Labour Party's plan to nationalize the coal mines. He was elected to the House of Commons in 1945 and appointed president of the Board of Trade (1947-51). Elected leader of the Labour Party in 1963, he became prime minister in 1964. He widened the party's voting majority in 1966 but his popularity declined in the late 1960s, partly because of his assumption of direct responsibility for the economy shortly before the pound was devalued in 1967. In his second term, he confirmed Britain's membership in the European Economic Community (1975). He resigned unexpectedly in 1976 and was created a life peer in 1983\n\nHarold Wilson\n\na British politician in the Labour Party, who was Prime Minister from 1964 to 1970, and 1974 to 1976, when he gave up his position. He then became Lord Wilson. When he first became Prime Minister, people saw him as someone with modern ideas and an informal manner, who understood ordinary people, at a time when many politicians were very upper-class and formal. The Open University was established by Harold Wilson (1916-95)\n\nHarriet E. Wilson\n\norig. Harriet E. Adams born 1828?, Milford, N.H.?, U.S. died 1863?, Boston, Mass.? U.S. writer, probably the first African American to publish a novel in English in the U.S. Little is known of her history until 1850. She may have been an indentured servant in Milford, N.H., before becoming a domestic in Massachusetts. In 1851 she married a fugitive slave who ran off to sea before the birth of their son. Her one book, written to make money to reclaim her son from foster care, is Our Nig (1859), a largely autobiographical novel that treats racism in the pre-Civil War North. After 1863 Wilson disappeared from the public record\n\nJ Tuzo Wilson\n\nborn Oct. 24, 1908, Ottawa, Ont., Can. died April 15, 1993, Toronto, Ont. Canadian geologist and geophysicist. He was the first graduate of a Canadian university in the field of geophysical studies (1930). After World War II he became a professor of geophysics at the University of Toronto. He established global patterns of faulting and the structure of the continents, and in the 1960s he became the world's leading spokesman for the theory of continental drift. His studies also were important for the hypothesis of seafloor spreading and the theory of convection currents within the Earth. A range of mountains in Antarctica is named for him\n\nJames Harold Baron Wilson of Rievaulx Wilson\n\nborn March 11, 1916, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, Eng. died May 24, 1995, London British politician and prime minister (1964-70, 1974-76).

Immigrating to North America in 1765, he taught Greek and rhetoric in the College of Philadelphia and then studied law under John Dickinson. In 1774 he published a widely read treatise proposing a commonwealth of British colonies. He was a member of the Committee of Correspondence, a delegate to the Continental Congress (1775-77), and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. He helped draft the U.S. Constitution and the Pennsylvania state constitution and delivered lectures that became landmarks in American jurisprudence. He served on the U.S. Supreme Court (1789-98)\n\nJohn Tuzo Wilson\n\nborn Oct. 24, 1908, Ottawa, Ont., Can. died April 15, 1993, Toronto, Ont. Canadian geologist and geophysicist.

Its largest optical telescope, with a diameter of 100 in. (2.5 m), enabled Edwin Hubble and his associates to discover evidence of an expanding universe and to estimate its size\n\nRichard Wilson\n\n{i} (1714-1782) Welsh painter of landscapes; (1920-1987) United States science fiction author\n\nRichard Wilson\n\nborn Aug. 1, 1714, Penegoes, Montgomeryshire, Wales died May 15, 1782, Llanberis, Carnarvonshire Welsh landscape painter. He worked as a portraitist for many years, but after a lengthy stay in Italy (1750-57) he worked almost exclusively in landscape, except for numerous drawings of Roman sites and buildings that he used in composing Italianate landscapes. A set of drawings made for Lord Dartmouth (dated 1754) show that he tempered his delicate observation of light and distance with the discipline of such 17th-century Classicists as Nicolas Poussin. The landscapes he produced after his return to Britain influenced J.M.W. Turner and John Constable\n\nRobert W Wilson\n\nborn Jan. 10, 1936, Houston, Texas, U.S. U.S. radio astronomer. He joined Bell Laboratories in 1963 and headed its Radio Physics Research Department (1976-94).

He attended Eureka College and worked as a radio sports announcer before going to Hollywood in 1937. In his career as a movie actor, he appeared in more than 50 films and was twice president of the Screen Actors Guild (1947-52, 1959-60). In the mid-1950s he became a spokesman for the General Electric Co.; he hosted its television theatre program from 1954 to 1962. Having gradually changed his political affiliation from liberal Democrat to conservative Republican, he was elected governor of California in 1966 and served two terms. In 1980 he defeated incumbent Pres. Jimmy Carter to become president. Shortly after taking office, he was wounded in an assassination attempt. His administration adopted policies based on supply-side economics in an effort to promote rapid economic growth and reduce the federal deficit. Congress approved many of his proposals (1981), which succeeded in lowering inflation but doubled the national debt by 1986. He began the largest peacetime military buildup in U.S. history; in 1983 he proposed construction of the Strategic Defense Initiative. His administration concluded a treaty with the Soviet Union to restrict intermediate-range nuclear weapons, conducted a proxy war against Nicaragua through its support of the Contras, and invaded Grenada ostensibly to prevent the island nation from becoming a Soviet outpost. He was reelected by a large margin in 1984. Beginning in 1986, the Iran-Contra Affair temporarily weakened his presidency. Though his intellectual capacity for governing was often disparaged by his critics, his affability and artful communication skills enabled him to pursue numerous conservative policies with conspicuous success, and his tough stance toward the Soviet Union is often credited with contributing to the demise of Soviet communism. In 1994 he revealed that he had Alzheimer disease\n\nSam Wilson\n\n(1766-1854) American inspector of army supplies, man rumored to be the original \"Uncle Sam\n\nSir Joseph Wilson Swan\n\nborn Oct. 31, 1828, Sunderland, Durham, Eng. died May 27, 1914, Warlingham, Surrey English physicist and chemist. By 1871 he had invented the dry photographic plate, an important improvement in photography. He had already produced an early electric lightbulb (1860), and in 1880, independently of Thomas Alva Edison, he produced a carbon-filament incandescent electric lamp. He also patented a process for squeezing nitrocellulose through holes to form fibres, a process that became widely employed in the textile industry\n\nTeddy Wilson\n\norig. Theodore Shaw Wilson born Nov. 24, 1912, Austin, Texas, U.S. died July 31, 1986, New Britain, Conn. U.S. pianist and bandleader. He began recording as the leader of small groups in 1935. These recordings, often featuring vocalist Billie Holiday, are classics of small-group swing. Wilson joined Benny Goodman's trio in 1936. After 1940 he worked primarily as a leader of small ensembles or as a solo pianist, showcasing his tasteful and refined amalgam of the styles of Fats Waller, Earl Hines, and Art Tatum\n\nThomas Wilson Dorr\n\nborn Nov. 5, 1805, Providence, R.I., U.S. died Dec. 27, 1854, Providence U.S. politician. From 1834 he served in the Rhode Island legislature, where he tried to introduce constitutional reform to expand white manhood suffrage. In 1841 he organized the People's Party, which held elections and installed Dorr as governor in 1842. The existing government refused to recognize his authority, labeling the action \"Dorr's Rebellion.\" The state had two governments until 1844, when Dorr was tried for treason; though given a life sentence, he was released in 1845\n\nThomas Wilson Dorr\n\n{i} (1805-1854) USA lawyer and leader of Dorr's Rebellion\n\nThomas Woodrow Wilson\n\nborn Dec. 28, 1856, Staunton, Va., U.S. died Feb. 3, 1924, Washington, D.C. 28th president of the U.S. (1913-21). He earned a law degree and later received his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University. He taught political science at Princeton University (1890-1902). As its president (1902-10), he introduced various reforms. With the support of progressives, he was elected governor of New Jersey. His reform measures attracted national attention, and he became the Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1912. His campaign emphasized his progressive New Freedom policy, and he defeated Theodore Roosevelt and William H. Taft to win the presidency.
