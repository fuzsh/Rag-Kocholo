        "text": "Charles Thomson Rees Wilson (February 14, 1869 â€“ November 15, 1959) was a Scottish physicist and meteorologist. His invention of the cloud chamber made him win the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nWilson was born to John Wilson and Annie Clerk Harper in the parish of Glencorse, Midlothian. After his father's death in 1873, his family moved to Manchester. He studied biology at Owen's College to become a doctor. He then joined Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge to study Physics and Chemistry.\n\nWilson later became interested in meteorology, and in 1893 he began to study clouds and their properties. He worked at the observatory on Ben Nevis mountain to observe cloud formation. He then tried to replicate this effect at smaller scale in his laboratory in Cambridge, by causing moist air to expand in a sealed container. He then experimented with creating cloud trails in containers by ions and radiation. He was awarded the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the cloud chamber.\n\nWilson married Jessie Fraser in 1908. They had four children. He died on November 15, 1959 near Edinburgh.\n\nMember of the Royal Society in 1900\n\nHughes Medal of 1911\n\nHopkins Prize, Cambridge Philosophical Society, 1920\n\nGunning Prize, Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1921\n\nRoyal Medal of the Royal Society of London, 1922\n\nHoward N. Potts Medal 1925\n\n1927 Nobel Prize in Physics\n\nThe Franklin Medal of 1929\n\nCopley Medal 1935.\n\nThe Wilson crater on the Moon is named after him, jointly with Alexander Wilson and Ralph Elmer Wilson.\n\nThe Wilson Cloud, a dense cloud that forms during a large explosion (e.g. a nuclear weapon explosion) is named after him.\n\nThe Wilson Society, an association of natural scientists at Sidney Sussex College, is named after him.\n\nCharles Thomson Rees Wilson's personal archive is maintained by the Archives of the University of Glasgow (GUAS)"
