In this document you can also find details about our organizational structure and the most recent report on how we are spending our funds.\n\nWe’d especially like to thank the people who donated directly on our website to support our work. It is only through the sum of all these kind collective efforts that our work is possible.\n\nMore than 4,000 people have donated on our website over the past couple of years. When donating, we ask each supporter whether they agree to be listed publicly, and most have agreed – here are the names and dedications provided by these readers. We update this donor list quarterly.\n\nHuge thanks to everyone!"
