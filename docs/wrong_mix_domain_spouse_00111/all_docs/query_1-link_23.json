        "text": "I just wanted to let you know, I had the BEST experience with the Team Member staff who worked through my personal refinance. Even during high volume months, the staff was very responsive, and my refinance was done timely and efficiently with no hiccups. They all were so helpful: I cannot say enough about how great they are to guide a borrower through the process. My loan funded today and will be saving us 2.125% on our interest rate. The Team was so thorough, and the messages that get sent every time the loan moves to the next step were awesome. I worked with Mimi, Kerri and Jammie throughout the process, and no doubt there are others, so kudos to them all. I enjoy carrying Cornerstone pom-poms all the time and certainly even more now that I have had the opportunity to experience our process firsthand.\n\nI know both of you as very compassionate business executives who care deeply for the CHL team members. This year I have been privileged to glimpse the compassionate side of CHL even more plainly I am especially proud of CHL Cares! What company keeps its team member on the payroll when that individual can no longer work due to a difficult illness, especially when company revenues are down? CHL does! I know that type of decision came from both of you and other key individuals. That type of support allowed a wife to care for her desperately ill husband. She will never forget that kindness. And this caring attitude has filtered down to the next generation when a younger supervisor immediately stepped up to start a “Go Fund Me” effort for one of her team members in critical need. These are just two examples of the quiet compassion and substantial help our company demonstrates. I am so glad I can still be a part of the team at CHL.\n\nI’ve been with Cornerstone a little over three years now, and I can’t express enough how special this place is to me. The whole idea of a work family has always seemed trite and disingenuous until I was invited to join Cornerstone. From top to bottom, people truly and deeply care about one another in a way I’ve never seen or experienced before. The way everyone honors our culture and our people is a constant source of inspiration and joy in my life. I must share my gratitude to both of you for building a place for us all to come together and improve each other’s lives and the lives of our customers. I’m here because this is a great company. I LOVE being here because we have assembled a group of the most amazing people who truly love one another.\n\nI am one of the newest and luckiest members of the Cornerstone family. Your video that discusses Cornerstone’s mission and culture was very inspiring, and I couldn’t be happier to be joining a team that puts so much emphasis on customer satisfaction and employee morale. I had been trying to join Cornerstone for almost 2 ½ years, but the timing was always just a little off. Still, I never gave up, always knowing that I was meant to be here. Finally, my dream came true this past December, and I couldn’t be more grateful that Michelle Gonzalez—and ultimately you—has granted me this opportunity. Every day I walk these halls and can’t help but smile because I know that I will be great here. Once again, thank you for your message, the opportunity, and I look forward to meeting you one day.\n\nI just wanted to send a quick note to sing the praises of one employee Pat Fowler. I have to say that she is the embodiment of the CHL Mission, Vision and Convictions, as published, and has been a valuable tool for me as I have progressed through the learning process of underwriting for CHL and my continued development of the tools necessary to underwrite our various Bond Loans and FHA loans, and I’m certain she will continue to be an asset as I delve into the VA process. She has made herself readily available and provided valuable direction without rebuke despite what, I’m sure, has been some impact to her production, and I can’t say it with any greater conviction how thankful I am and blessed to have her as my queue mate. She has made a positive difference to me, and is not only an asset to me, our queue and team, but, most certainly, to CHL. She deserves to be duly recognized for her steadfast dedication to the company.\n\nI am thankful every day to work for such a wonderful company that has passionate and professional employees and leadership. Working for this company has been such a blessing for me and my husband this year. I know you are a busy person, but I would like you to know how Cornerstone has made a positive difference in my life in 2016: My husband and I purchased our home through the employee loan program at Cornerstone. My job provided income to pay our bills when my husband was laid off. My job provided health insurance that covered my husband’s surgery. Working with Cornerstone employees restored my trust and faith in co-workers that I had lost while working as a state regulator. Working for Cornerstone has allowed me to grow as a professional and contribute my thoughts and knowledge to various projects. I am so thankful to be here and hope I have made a positive difference in the lives of those I work with and that I will continue to do so.\n\nFirst, thank you to everyone for their heroic efforts and hard work keeping this company running smoothly. I am amazed at what we have been able accomplish in the face of a disaster like Hurricane Harvey. So many of you have been putting in long hours and late nights, selflessly supporting others both at work and home. I am thankful for everyone! I also want you to know that the Cornerstone Cares fund is available for anyone who was flooded out or has any financial hardship from Harvey. We have been able to help a few of you already and it is our privilege to do so. There is a natural tendency to think that you are taking from others by receiving help, but the fund has enough to help anyone who needs it because of the constant generosity of all 1700 of our coworkers (team). And if necessary, Marc and Judy are committed to covering any needs if the fund runs low. So please do not worry about that. This is more than a company: it is a family. And you are all an important part of it.\n\nCornerstone is by far the best mortgage company I have worked for. It has a VERY wide range of loan programs with numerous investors-- and they are still adding more. The culture is unheard of-- they have a family/team dynamic. You aren't just an employee: you are a team member, and that stems directly from the top. The compensation is excellent and benefits are competitive. The best thing to point out is that closing dates are strictly enforced. If a loan needs to close on time, it gets done no matter how many resources and different members, from processing to the credit risk VP, it takes: they will all jump in, if needed. Marketing is quick, and they have a lot of different tools for custom marketing. Ops focuses to ensure that we are out creating, developing, and growing relationships with our business partners so we are not sitting behind a desk working loans.\n\nThank you so much for reaching out once again. I try to keep my powder dry and fly below the radar, but this is now three times your reaching out has impressed upon me the value in the leadership that I partnered with. This past Sunday after our service I was quoting to a friend Cornerstone’s Mission Statement: “I exist to use and improve upon my God-given talents to make a positive difference to the lives of my customers.” I was further able to explain our Mission as a company and that it is directly from my leaders. In Wyoming this language isn’t too foreign, but we are still able to recognize the depth of conviction when a statement like this is voiced, especially in the current national climate. I, for one, am grateful, blessed, and humbled to be branded with and through Cornerstone. I have had a vision for years about the legacy I can leave in my two states (Wyoming and Montana), and I know in my core this IS the home for me to launch from. I thank you again for the legacy and reputation that I am proud to be partnered with.\n\nNever in my life have I experienced such an accident as we did a week ago Monday, never in my life did I think a car accident would put me in a hospital for five days, and never in my life did I think we would be exposed to the generosity that you have shown us. Again, all I can offer at this point is a very sincere thank you and please express our gratitude to the Cornerstone Cares committee, who bestowed this blessing upon us. I am soon very grateful to you ALL for: 1 - Being AMAZING, 2 - Making this [transition to Cornerstone] happen, 3 - Helping us get off the ground so quickly, 4 - Making us feel welcome and, 5 - Being our new FAMILY! You are all very special…and have built something REMARKABLE! I hope you can go home feeling like the super stars you are tonight! Much love from your BIGGEST fans!\n\nI couldn’t help but share this with you this wonderful morning, after having the privilege of hearing Les Brown speak at our church yesterday. He is an amazing motivational speaker. He shared with us this weekend that to reach our BEST, we need to let go and surround ourselves with OQP (Only Quality People). It takes 17 positives to drown out and replace one negative or limiting belief you have been fed. He challenged us to consider these questions: Are you that OQP for those in your sphere? Are you seeing and speaking the BEST in them? If you aren’t or can’t, then maybe you need to let go and let someone into their space that will. He encouraged us to go be amazing and let someone else know THEY are too. We have amazing teams, here at Cornerstone, and together we are building greatness that nothing or no one can bring down or steal our joy. Keep up the great work and leadership.\n\nI wanted to send a SPECIAL “Thank you” to each and EVERY one of you who have worked SO hard (and continue to) to make our transition to our new Cornerstone family a smooth one! You have gone above and BEYOND, and we are beyond grateful! For years I have heard about the Cornerstone family from Marc, Judy, Andrina, Gene, Jim and others . . . and I will tell you every single thing they have said is 100% TRUE! You guys are committed to excellence, taking care of people, and making them feel at HOME - and it shows in EVERYTHING you do. Thank you for going the extra mile for us during a challenging time: your commitment to honoring God shows every time you extend your heart (and your hands) to us, and we are blessed as a result. Many thanks for making it possible for us to touch lives through you. Please don’t ever forget what a difference you make!\n\nI receive a lot of thank you notes and emails after closing, but this one really touched my heart (Maybe because it’s been a rough week). “Good morning, Denise - The level of service provided by Cornerstone has actually surpassed my expectations! Thank you for helping us purchase our new home. I appreciate your efforts and, especially, your positive and problem-solving attitude as purchasing a house can be a stressful experience. I will definitely come to you for my future lending needs, and I will not hesitate to strongly recommend you to friends and colleagues. I also want to thank my realtor for recommending Cornerstone. Working with Cornerstone was a very good experience.” This is why I LOVE what I do. I am blessed beyond measure to work for an amazing company that employs amazing people that share the same passion that I do. There are so many caring hearts involved in the process of making a family’s dream of home ownership possible. I am so grateful for each and every one of them. I am especially grateful for you two who made Cornerstone what it is. I can’t tell you how honored that I am to a part of the Cornerstone family. I hope this email makes your day even better, as it has mine.\n\nI have recently joined the Cornerstone Home Lending team in Boulder, Colorado. The transition has been such a positive experience with the management team and the support staff. I have asked myself more than once: “Is this for real?” it has actually been fun to come to work. Cornerstone provides so many tools and support systems to help the loan officers serve our clients at a very high level of professionalism. I am looking forward to having a very successful year (and for many more after that). I so love the story of how you and Judy were led to start Cornerstone. I have actually shared the story with a couple of my real estate agents who totally understand that story. Thank you so much for the opportunity to join Cornerstone, and I hope that I will be a positive addition to the company.\n\nWe have dear friends Amy and Darren C whom we referred to Cornerstone for their mortgage last summer. They were thrilled with the service and loved the Dangora Team. Unfortunately, Darren Cdied of a heart attack recently, only 9 months after moving in, leaving his wife and twelve-year-old daughter here on Earth to do life without him. I sent out a Meal Train link to set up meals and donations for Amy and Kaitlyn. Ashley [our transaction coordinator] volunteered to take a meal. She did not know Amy well—just that she was a client. Ashley is an example of the culture of Cornerstone and why we do business with like-minded, servant-oriented people that are truly an extension of our team. This really touched me that Ashley would take time to make a meal and minister in this way to Amy. Thank you for not only serving our clients we send you at the highest level, but truly doing all you can to make a difference and impact in others’ lives for life, not just during the 30-day transaction period. Ashley, you are APPRECIATED more than you know! Sometimes it's the little things we do that can make a BIG difference! Bless you!\n\nI just left a closing. It was special to see the excitement and anticipation of home ownership on our borrower’s face. She thanked me over and over for the help we provided to make this possible. The smile, the excitement, and the anticipation showed belong to all of you! Thank you, Rose for always providing that extra effort. Thank you for calling FNMA and calling me after hours on a Friday afternoon. You are a tremendous resource for CHL. Thank you, Lisa, for being such a splendid underwriter and for your calm, supportive attitude. You are a blessing to our Region. Thank you, Angie, for all the help you extend over and over for condo approvals. Thank you, Diane, for developing such a wonderful condo team. , Thank you, Cyndi, for piecing all the details together and for the cheerful voice and laugh you bring every day to our work place. Thank you, Kim, for ALWAYS being there to support us. Thank you, David and Lana, for all you do for your originators in this region. Thanks to every team member who makes a difference at CHL.\n\nI have been meaning to respond to one of your emails that have so very kindly welcomed me aboard the Cornerstone Family. I cannot tell you how much being part of Cornerstone means to me! The bank I worked for previously had similar values, but when they hired a new Loan Ops Director, those values failed to trickle down. It was still hard for me to leave that company until I met the people at Cornerstone! They all explained Cornerstone’s values, and the tenure of the majority of the employees, in a way that I knew these values DID apply throughout the company. This, and the simple fact that I knew I could learn a lot from these women, were the reasons I chose to work here! I’ve been looking for a “home” for years, and I feel like I’ve finally found it here at Cornerstone! It means a lot that Cornerstone is so vocal about their values and support of their employees & customers! In today’s competitive market, I feel like this sets us apart from other lenders. I never heard anything bad about Cornerstone when I was doing my research. In fact, when I turned in my notice to First United Bank, the Vice President asked me where I was going. I told her, and all she could say was “Yep, that’s a good one! It would be selfish of me to even try to convince you to stay at this point.” Thank you for the welcome and for establishing a company with these stellar values, that I can be proud to say I am now a part of!\n\nI entered the purchase market in February 2013 with another lender. I had no idea what I was doing or how I was going to get business, and I had very little instruction on how to do it. After two years, I started with Cornerstone in Jan 2015, and March 2015 happened to be my biggest month ever in the business. I closed 10 loans for $1,674,108 and was ecstatic! By the end of 2015, I closed 97 loans for $17,500,000. This past February 2016 I hired a Production Assistant, and in March we hit a record month of 26 funded purchase loans at $4,603,423! Just last month, I hired my newest team member for the role of Loan Officer Assistant. My team makeup now consists of a Senior Loan Officer, a Loan Officer Assistant, a Production Assistant, a Transaction Coordinator, and a Processor. We are currently working to finish this year strong and to continue training while preparing to surpass our goals for 2017. I am beyond blessed to be where I am. I’m surrounded by professionals/mentors who continuously push me to grow and to be better each day. I am excited for what the future holds, and I look forward to continuous growth and life changing opportunities.\n\nI recently read about the Cornerstone Cares Program, and as someone who was personally affected by a family tragedy, it brought tears to my eyes. I had not known about this program up until about a month ago. Not knowing how this Company would affect my life personally, I know that I can make a difference for someone else. I would like nothing more than to pay it forward for the families that need it in their time of crisis or tragedy. A year ago this past Sunday, our son suffered a severe traumatic brain injury. He was not even 2 years old. He was rushed to Kingwood Medical Center where he lost consciousness and needed to be sent via life-flight to Texas Children’s Hospital for emergency brain surgery. At the time I was a stay-at- home mom of our two, wonderful boys. Working with Cornerstone, my husband, had the flexibility to work remotely and be WITH me through every step of Carter’s recovery. We were admitted for just over 24 days. I put everything on hold in order to give 100% of my focus to my son’s recovery. He was in need of extensive therapy and rehabilitation services. He had physical therapy and occupational therapy until this past April and just this past month, he GRADUATED and tested out of speech therapy. He is not only catching up to his peers but also thriving beyond our wildest dreams! We were invited to a patient reunion party hosted by Texas Children’s Hospital this past July where my son’s doctors and nurses were absolutely floored by his recovery. He is the best representation of a miracle I could ever imagine. This amazing Marketing team rallied behind us through this past year. They came together for us, brought us a gift basket with all the necessary items we would have never thought we would need. They cooked meals for us when we got home so we could spend all of our time getting our son settled back in at home. These amazing people made it possible for us to be present. That means more to me than I could ever truly express. It has been a long year, and we couldn’t be more grateful for Cornerstone and the amazing people we both get to work with now. I have been with Cornerstone since May of this year, and, I have to say, it has been the best decision I have ever made. When the opportunity came up for a part-time position, it was my husband’s love and passion for this company that made me understand that this was more than just another job: this was going to be the door to a whole new opportunity for our family.\n\nIt is so hard to believe that it has been a year since I came to work at Cornerstone. I know I have told you this in the past, but wanted to revisit it again on my anniversary date. You called me out of the blue just over a year ago. If you had told me then I could be happier here at Cornerstone than I was at my previous employer, I would have told you that is not possible. Ironically, from our first conversation I felt as if I had come home. As part of the Dinkins region, that feeling continued. I am not saying life is perfect nor that I haven’t had some stumbles along the way as I learned my way around the company. However, your mentality of a servant’s heart has filtered throughout this company, and each day I feel the support of everyone in virtually every department from the condo team to the 401K team, to the ops support we have in our region. Thank you so much for inviting me to join such a great company.\n\nWorking for Cornerstone has been such a blessing in my life. I have met some of the most dedicated, hard-working, competent people here. This company and its employees honestly walk the walk related to our Vision, Mission, and Convictions. We all work hard, but this last month I’ve experienced firsthand how Cornerstone “cares for its people.” Everyone has been so very supportive throughout the month when I needed time off to attend to my husband’s cancer treatment appointments and, even now, when I need to take a couple minutes here and there to help him. I’ve always felt valued for my knowledge, experience, and hard work by every company that I’ve ever worked for, but this is my first experience feeling cared for, and I know that Cornerstone cares. You and Judy have managed to create a very special and unique company. You have hired some amazing people. I am very grateful to be here.\n\nI am thankful every day to work with such a wonderful company that has passionate and professional employees and leadership. Working with this company has been such a blessing for me and my husband this year. I know you are a busy person, but I would like you to know how Cornerstone has made a positive difference in my life in 2016: My husband and I purchased our home through the employee loan program at Cornerstone. My job provided income to pay our bills when my husband was laid off. My job provided health insurance that covered my husband’s skin cancer surgery. Working with Cornerstone employees restored my trust and faith in co-workers that I had lost while working as a state regulator. Working with Cornerstone has allowed me to grow as a professional and contribute my thoughts and knowledge to various projects. I am so thankful to be here and hope I have made a positive difference in the lives of those I work with and that I continue to do so.\n\nI’ve been with Cornerstone for less than a year, but I’ve been in the industry for 35 years as a Loan Processor, Processing Manager, Underwriter, Broker and Loan Officer. I surely wish I’d come to Cornerstone years ago, for I love working here! I’m very appreciative of the way you treat your employees, the training and support that is offered, and the Policies and Procedures that you’ve set up. I have been trying to take advantage of all that is offered: I read the book Living Forward that you so generously offered and have gone away and written out my plan. My manager here, Nader, is going to help me go through it and work on implementing the changes. I’m so grateful I’m here at Cornerstone. I love being connected with a Godly company where relationships are important and where the efforts of all involved are appreciated, not just a select few. Thank you for your generosity. May the Lord continue to bless Cornerstone and cause us to be a light in a sometimes dark and dishonest industry.\n\nWhen I reflect about my opportunity in banking that led me to mortgages and my desire to help and bless people with homeownership, I’m thankful every day that my wife’s job brought us to Dallas and that I was introduced to Gina. I know that I had the knowledge and skill set to be successful in the mortgage industry had I stayed in Kansas City, but can’t help but KNOW that without Cornerstone, I wouldn’t be as successful as I am today. From you and Judy, Cindy Annis, Gina Jackson, Rose Moore, Mary Dinkins, Paula Barksdale, Kerri Etheridge, Kim Link, Shelley Mills, Jenny Scott, Lisa Taylor and countless others that bless my life every day, I wouldn’t be able to help all these families looking for fair, knowledgeable and quality service. This is something I’m truly proud of and you should be too. It has taken me some time, but by having Faith at home and work, I’m able to recognize and speak openly about it. Thank you for your continued efforts in enriching your employees’ lives, for they extend to and enrich the lives of others every day, and it doesn’t go unnoticed.\n\nThank you for your providing the tools needed for us to succeed. I met with Gene Humphries yesterday for brunch, and we have discussed the possibility of opening up another branch in our neighboring town of Loveland. My wife and I are very excited about this potential opportunity for future growth in our home town of Loveland. We will keep our Fort Collins branch so this will be a big step for us. I am sure you already know, but Gene is a true blessing to all of us and with his guidance, I am 100% certain will reach our goal. On a side note, I really want to thank you for your support in retaining the top loan officer in our branch. Dustin Camping has been with me and my office for over 8 years prior to our joining Cornerstone. He is staying with us and will be a big part of our future.\n\nI just wanted to let you know that Stan Thampi from the corporate technology dept was amazing. As you know he arrived in Albuquerque on Sunday to install our new hardware and get us through the “new” Citrix conversion. He worked through the wee hours of Monday morning so that when we arrived for work, we were set up and ready for our training with John Bryant. The conversion went very smoothly and anything that was missing on our systems or that needed tweaking was immediately handled and fixed by Stan. He had a very positive attitude and friendly personality and did everything humanly possible to make our conversion as painless as possible. He treated each of us as if we were his only “customer” and made sure we were comfortable and working properly before he left yesterday. He is a bona fide example of “the Cornerstone difference.” So I wanted to tell you what a great employee he is. Thanks so much for sending him to Albuquerque.\n\nI want to thank you for having built a company that takes its Mission, Vision and Convictions so seriously. I came to Cornerstone in July of last year, and it has been a great experience. I have to tell you, I was considering a few different mortgage companies at the time, and the difference maker for me was the part of the mission statement, that said, “We exist use and improve upon our God-given talent. . . .” That really resonated with me, and I liked the idea of going to work for a company that acknowledges where our gifts come from. I could also tell in my visit to the regional office in Ft. Collins that everyone there was living out the Mission, Vision and Convictions. I have continued to see that at work almost every single day. I just wanted to share those thoughts with you.\n\nI discovered how special Cornerstone Home Lending is on the first day I spoke to your recruiter, Don Snyder. He described the culture at the office in Plano with Wallly Elibiary and the entire staff. He also told me how special everyone is at Cornerstone. On my first day of work, I arrived to be greeted by everyone. They gave me flowers and took me out to lunch. I then received my Cornerstone keychain and cup. After our morning meeting, we all joined in prayer, so I knew after the first day how blessed I was to be joining this company. Every day since then I’ve discovered something new that impresses me, such as watching your video regarding the Cornerstone Cares program,[to] which I want to give weekly. I am just thrilled to have had my prayers answered and [be] given the opportunity to become a part of the Cornerstone family.\n\nI want to express my gratitude to you for providing me with the perfect place of employment. I have been working with Cornerstone a little over a year, and everyone I work with is like family to me. I am located in Dallas and have been to the Houston office a few times. I will never forget the first time I was there: everyone treated me like I had known them for years, very welcoming and kind. I spend most of my days smiling because I have been blessed to be a part of the Cornerstone family. This year has been the hardest year of my life: I went through a very bad divorce and learning to be a single mom to my 2-year-old daughter. Cornerstone was and still is my happy place. Working for people that always tell you they appreciate you and let you know they are happy you are on their team makes employees feel like they work for a company who cares, and that means so much. I am looking forward to many more years at Cornerstone.\n\nI just wanted to take the time to let you know how much I appreciate your never giving up on recruiting me. After being in this business for 18 years, moving to another company was not something to take light hearted or jump into. As loan officers, we get approached every day from other lenders who all have the same story about being the best, … but it’s really true at Cornerstone. I can’t believe it’s almost been 3 years since I started at Cornerstone. I thank God every day for my career, Cornerstone and for the opportunity. When I’m meeting with new realtors, I just get all goosey inside. I find that my excitement about Cornerstone just bleeds out of my pores! I can now meet with realtors and it’s not just lip service. Cornerstone IS REALLY THE BEST! I tell clients that Cornerstone runs their business like I would, if I was the owner. Again, thank you for encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone by adding an assistant to my team last year. It was literally a leap of faith. My goal for 2014 is to add a 3rd person to my team. This time it comes a little easier to do since I can see the increase in volume by always stretching my comfort zone.\n\nAs I am approaching my 5-year anniversary with Cornerstone, I want to thank you for all of the opportunities you and Judy have given me here. I truly appreciate your approach to the management of Cornerstone, and the fact that you not only clearly state the Company’s core mission and values but that you both try to live them day in and day out. After working in this business for 30 years, I feel very blessed that I work here and feel like I have found a place I can call home. I look forward to facing the challenges ahead of us with this great group of people that you have both attracted and empowered. I am grateful for you and Judy and everything you do for us here at Cornerstone. I am looking forward to the next five years and working with this great group of people!\n\nI just wanted to write and thank you for your caring demeanor. You work in such a way that makes all of us employees feels feel like we are the top and worth our weight in gold—everything from the way you speak to people to the way you want us to all have pleasant experiences when dealing with underwriting (this is typically not the industry standard for underwriting, which can be horrid to deal with, but not here and in your world – because you know the value of working as a team). Your many efforts are greatly appreciated and do not go unnoticed. Thank you for making a difference in the lives of those you serve. I am sure a huge fan of yours.\n\nWe are most excited to be joining your family. We have heard some very wonderful things about how the (Cornerstone) team puts the needs of the customer first. I have spent most of my working life in this business, and after being with the big corporate machine for the last 4 years of my career, I was convinced I needed to find a new industry. I feel it was truly a God-send when I was introduced to your firm because I feel I have a God-given talent for this industry and can’t wait to use it again with the right company. Not only do we have your mission statement on our desks, but when we first saw it, we came home and put it on our refrigerator as well. Thank you for bringing me aboard.\n\nI feel so very blessed that 14 years ago I was referred to this company and was hired. I was newly divorced and was a single mother of a 3 year old and a 7 year old. Life has not been perfect but because of the people I work with and for, I have raised my family with pride. I know that a lot of it is because of the generosity and caring attitude of this company. GOD BLESS you for your donation to the victims of West. My sister’s home will have to be rebuilt, and her insurance will provide for that, but a lot of others are not as fortunate and have lost the main source of income for their families. I know that they are not thinking of that right now and can mourn only their lost loved ones, but in the weeks and months to come, the monetary gifts will take a little stress out of their lives as they rebuild.\n\nAnother great month has passed – and I can’t help myself again – you are probably tired of seeing me write each month, but I have to again express my gratitude to the Cornerstone family and to my awesome local team for all that everyone does to support me and my efforts. Wow and Wow on all that we are doing (together we are making great things happen). Wow and Wow on the support we give to one another.Wow and Wow on helping to sometimes turn the impossible scenarios into possibilities (I just got off the phone with Alison in Secondary, and Dan Cooper is making something possible for me that otherwise would not be possible … but that seems to happen all the time with each department and all the non-vanilla situations we seem to have … thank you for finding ways within what is acceptable to make many things work … you are AWESOME!) Hat’s off to all of you: you are hard-working, dedicated, miracle workers! We are serving clients and our referral partners in a fabulous way! I am so happy to have your continued support and help that allows me to do what I do.\n\nI just wanted to send a HUGE “Thank you” for investing in my future at Cornerstone. Boot Camp was an eye-opener and is going to challenge me to increase new relationships and deepen current ones. I loved being around so many other eager loan originators from our company. Just seeing so many from our company shows me that you live our vision of growing Cornerstone with our God-given talents. What a blessing this is to see! Cornerstone is a truly amazing place, and I thank God that I have the privilege of working for leaders like you all. You always go above and beyond—it does not go unnoticed by me and others in our company. How great is this and how great is our God (Awesome that I can say this to you)!\n\nI was recently talking to a psychologist-friend of mine who is getting ready to open her own practice. She was asking about my job and curious why I would continue to work long hours when, in her mind, I could easily have the choice of staying at home, working much less, or finding an easier job. I explained about some of the incredible people I work with, how dedicated they are, how sincerely nice they are, how good they are at what they do. I pulled out the Cornerstone card with our mission, vision, and values. And, I told her about signing onto the computer every day with a promise to make a difference! Some people may say it is needless, but I explained to her that for me, it is a great reminder to get my attitude right—from the start. She asked to keep the card to model her own business after. She told me that she was honestly AMAZED to learn about a company with that much commitment! It made me proud to work here and I thought you might enjoy hearing that.\n\nI would like you to know that I really enjoy working with the people at Cornerstone. I have found everyone willing to help in every way—from getting us licensed to how we present ourselves to our clients. It is very refreshing to come on board with a new company whose employees are not only knowledgeable in their profession but are happy in their work. You are to be commended in the way you have structured your organization as well as surrounded yourself with such capable people. “Wanting to make the loan” and quick responses to our needs and questions are such different notions from other employers’ philosophies. Thank you for your warm welcome and kindness during this transition. I am very excited about Cornerstone—its mission and vision— and becoming part of your growing family.\n\nI wanted to thank you for the opportunity last week to come to Houston and see what Cornerstone has to offer me as a producing loan officer. I must say I was very much impressed with what I heard. I am very excited to join the Cornerstone team. It was very clear to me what Cornerstone stands for and how much its staff believes in its values. You have done an amazing job of creating an environment that people thrive in. I still have a couple of steps to take to make my transition complete, but I wanted to reach out and again say thank you so much for caring enough to invest in bringing me out to meet you and the team. My family and I are very excited about this new journey we are about to begin.\n\nI really appreciate how supportive you were when I approached you with a request that we participate in DELRAP. I recognize that not a lot of correspondent lenders are participating in the program, so it made it all the more special when you agreed to do so. I’m excited to inform you that this morning Cornerstone input our first DELRAP project approval, and we’ll be closing the loan in the next couple of weeks. I have been especially impressed with Tammy Pullen’s leadership and determination as she pushed through the obstacles with HUD and guided Diane Rivera through the evaluation of the project. I can’t begin to tell you what a victory this has been, and the number of inquiries I’ve been receiving from the local Realtors seeking to work with someone that can facilitate FHA financing on condos. Thank you so much!\n\nPosting by the San Antonio Branch’s Builder Division: What a wonderful thing to be in a position to give to others who are less fortunate. The support and donations were more than we ever imagined, and I am truly blessed to be working with people with such giving spirits. Each basket comes with a $25 gift card to HEB for the purchase of the turkey. With 22 baskets, we well exceeded our goal as a branch of 10 families. Because we received names and addresses for 16 families, we still have 6 extra baskets. If you know someone with a family who may be wondering if they can afford a Thanksgiving dinner this year, please let me know as soon as possible. Thank you for giving me the opportunity of being a part of a wonderful company, and I hope to invest many more years here at Cornerstone!\n\nI want to thank you for the opportunity to attend the Sales Mastery Seminar this year. We appreciate your generosity, and you can be sure that we will put our abundance of learning and information to good work. We are very glad that we made the move to Cornerstone and look forward to completing our career here. We so appreciate the culture of the company and are very aware that this comes from the top. I told Todd that I plan to be on that stage five to seven years from now to say what a great ride it has been, and that if you do the right things and work for the right company, you can achieve your dreams. So, in closing, thanks for providing the right company and for making Sales Mastery an extra special event.\n\nWOW! How does one say, “Thank you” for a day like yesterday? Thank you so much for all the wonderful gifts from the vendors. I don’t ever remember shopping in my life without looking at the price tag first. Oh, my goodness, all those hugs were fabulous (Surely set a worlds record for me in a day!) It was so much fun seeing everyone. How very generous you are with all of us, especially like yesterday with our great Christmas lunch, bazaar and auction! I am so proud of how our company has grown into a very unique and special company. God is continually blessing us. I can’t thank you enough for all you have done for me personally. It is great to work for a company that cares about us. I love you and your sweet family with all my heart.\n\nMr. Laird, I just wanted to let you know that you have an amazing team. I recently closed on the purchase of my home, and I was working with Keith Ward, Maribel Arevalo, and Dane Bigner. This group was wonderful to work with. I work in the real estate industry and have had the opportunity of dealing with dozens of lenders every month. This team outshined them all! First, they beat the other lender I was shopping by over a thousand dollars in fees. Then, despite the circumstances of my transaction (it was a HUD foreclosure), they were able to get my loan done within 2 weeks of receiving the executed contract from the seller (For most lenders I deal with, this would have been impossible given that it was and FHA loan!). Additionally, the seller needed a HUD 48 hours prior to closing, and when they were working the figures, they discovered that I was leaving around $1500 of seller concessions on the table and were able to relock my loan at a lower interest rate, getting new docs to title in time for me to close by my contract date. This also enabled my agent to get the BTSA that was offered because we were able to close before that deadline expired as well. This team’s knowledge, foresight, experience, and professionalism were evident every step of the way, and made what could have been a logistical disaster, a seamless and fluid transaction. I appreciated the empathy that they all exhibited, because although I close loans every day in my profession, I am rarely on the other side and, at times, can forget how hectic and stressful the whole process can be. This team always kept me informed about where my loan was in the process, and this helped assuage any distress on my part. Thank you for your part in creating such a great team. Keith, Maribel, and Dane are a huge asset to your company. I will be referring anyone I come across to Cornerstone Mortgage from now on.\n\nHi, Kim and PR Team – What a wonderful meeting my team had yesterday with your group in Houston! What a classy group you are! We are so excited to hit the ground running and build our volume through consistent and wonderful marketing efforts!! You guys took care of every detail for us – from Bernard transporting us, to flowers in our room, to even handing me a sandwich on my way out the door to the airport last night (that was a big wow factor) – you made us feel so welcome … and, of course, we are so in awe of everyone’s many, many talents and this incredible company. Love you guys – let’s make things happen in a big way for 2010! We are committed, we have a “big, hairy audacious goal” to meet this year … and we know that we cannot fail with you on our side! Thanks, again, from the bottom of my heart!!!\n\nMarc, our underwriter, and I were talking the other day about the culture here. He was in shock about something, and I said that I couldn’t fathom being anywhere else and wished there were a way I could get our recruits to actually experience the culture rather than simply hear us talk about it. Funny that most of us go about business everyday and take for granted the awesome gift we have been given in this flourishing garden that you so diligently tilled, planted and groomed for so many years before we arrived. Know that there is a whole group of frozen Minnesotans that get it and are truly honored to be a part of the Cornerstone family. Have an excellent day and thank you again for all you’ve done and continue to do each day.\n\nI wanted to let you know how much we appreciate your allowing us to come together at the 3rd annual Operations Conference. Not only do we get to see the people we talk to daily, we come back with new and improved ideas/guidelines that will help us perform our jobs in a uniform manner. It is always great to be able to talk to others to find out how they handle certain situations and to be able to answer questions they might ask of us, questions they wouldn’t normally ask during the course of their busy day. And, most importantly, as hard as we work during the normal course of business, to kick back and have fun is so refreshing. Just to let you know, we appreciate all you do for us! Thank you again!\n\nMr. Laird, I just received my welcome package, and all I can say is WOW! I have worked for Cornerstone Mortgage for 19 business days now, and, in that time I have been so welcomed by everyone here. Everyone from whom I have asked help has done so with such a patient heart and sincerity that it has really taken me aback. I have formed relationships here that I would already consider friendships. The almost daily emails from management regarding tips on FHA, RESPA updates, etc. have left an impression that Cornerstone cares for its employees and that it fosters an environment of learning and constant professional growth. The end of the month was also refreshing: when my team and I had loans that were down to the wire, David and Kathy came over and asked what was closing, what was outstanding on each loan, and, most importantly, how they could help us get our loans clear to close. Even after I made the decision to work for Cornerstone, I was excited but hesitant. I was not leaving a job where I was unhappy or one in which I did not get along with my boss or co workers: I left because Cornerstone is a more established company that offers better benefits and is closer to my home. In other words, I left for all the logical reasons. I can truly say now, without hesitation, that I have made a wonderful choice. I feel that I have found my home away from home. This is a truly caring company in every aspect. It’s the little things that I have experienced here that have left me with a big impression, and I feel that, like everything else, these kindnesses trickle down from top management. The attitudes and work ethics of the people here all stem from you, Mr. Laird, and that says a lot. I have had a wonderful experience in my short employment here, and I hope to be an integral part of Cornerstone and its success in the future. Thank you for all you do,\n\nGentleman: I just finished viewing the videos that Jay sent me this afternoon. My wife and her parents sat down and watched them, and, needless to say, we were all very impressed. My mother-in-law, who has been involved in wealth management for the past 35 years, told me she had tingles while watching the videos and felt as though I may have found my home. I, too, was extremely attracted to what I saw, and what truly amazes me is that the values I have built MY business upon are so perfectly in sync with those of Cornerstone’s! For the past 8 years I have attempted to make customer satisfaction; consistent contact for life through valuable lines of communication with clients; honesty; integrity; and being a man of my word my top priorities for producing success in the mortgage industry. I have desired to make those my cornerstones, all while working in an environment that stifles them on a daily basis and with no support system to speak of. It seems as though the Lord has been preparing me every step of the way for this opportunity. If I ultimately decide to make the switch, and if you decide I would be a good fit, I see limitless levels to which I will be able to take my career. I feel extremely positive about this opportunity thus far but will continue to do my research and look forward to a follow up meeting next week. After realizing what Cornerstone is truly all about, I am completely honored that I am even being considered for a position in your company. Thank you for the time you have spent with me and thank you for the opportunity to learn more about Cornerstone.\n\nThis was my first full week back in the office [after losing my dad]. I reminded myself how sincere your concern and condolences were and recalled the outpouring of support I have received from everyone at Cornerstone. It truly is a family environment, and to have the CEO of one of the largest mortgage banks in the nation recognize me, an employee from a different branch, really speaks volumes for the kind of company this is. And this isn’t an employee just brown-nosing the CEO about how great the company is: this is me saying, man to man, “Thank you for the support.” It’s truly comforting to know that not only are your friends and family there for you but even your company is just as sincerely by your side during this time.\n\nI really appreciate both of you for allowing me the opportunity to work for such a wonderful company. Thank you for the gifts. They brought tears to my eyes because I felt so appreciated and recognized. No other company can come close to Cornerstone Mortgage Company. I work with some wonderful people and feel very blessed each and every day for having everyone in my life. My commitment is to Cornerstone and the customers I work with on a daily basis. My goal is to make their dreams come true when it comes to their mortgage needs. Cornerstone gives me the ability to do that, and the reward is the happiness that emanates from their warm smiles and thank you’s. I am truly blessed and I look forward to working for many more years to come.\n\nI just want to say, “Thank You.” I hung up with one of our LIP’s (loans in process) about ten minutes ago, and we talked for an hour, mostly about why I love this industry, my job, and my company (He owns a very successful consulting firm and travels the world to tell companies what they need to do to grow their market share and become more successful). By the end of our conversation he offered me a job, but only if I left my current situation b/c he said he knows how much of an impact I make every day (happy tears in my eyes). And then I read this email you sent [re: the Employee Assistance Program], and I was overwhelmed with gratitude. I don’t need any of the services below, and I hope I never do …But I appreciate your vision and everything you are doing for our people. Happy Thanksgiving, I hope you have a good one. Keep up the great work!\n\nEvery time you send something or make a statement like you do in your Cornerstone intro video, you remind us why Cornerstone is so very unique. I hope you truly recognize what a positive difference these little things make in our lives. On-boarding people, opening up offices, closing loans, dealing with investor changes, a little NMLS and Dodd-Frank bologna, layering upon layering of guidelines and staff trying mightily to keep up with Loan Officers who want it done yesterday – it’s exciting and, it’s stressful. People are crumbling all around us, and we truly view you as a rock. We look to you for direction and guidance, even when you don’t think we’re looking. Thank you for always doing what you say and allowing me to be able to deliver on my promises. I know that each member of my team is grateful for you. Have an awesome, fearless, God-led day Marc!\n\nHi Marc, I am sitting with my daughter waiting to meet her kindergarten teacher, and was thinking about how blessed I am to be back at the Burnsville branch of CMC. Even through the shake up going on this week, it is more apparent than ever that Carrie and the rest of the team are more dedicated than ever to upholding the CMC core values and mission. The fostering of employee dedication and commitment to its own is amazing. You and Judy have really created an outstanding vehicle!! For example, When I came back as a temp in June, it was so amazing to call down to IT and have Eva welcome me back (couldn't believe she remembered me after 2 yrs!). The intense feeling of genuine concern and family atmosphere cannot be equaled in any other company. Within the branch, it was such a relief to be able to come in and hit the ground running. I'll tell you, that it has been a long time (during my absence) since I looked forward to work everyday and felt that I was a valuable part of an amazing team. I now have that again. Since I have made a short story very long, the moral of the story is this: Thank you for your vision. Thank you for your dedication to CMC. Thank you for gathering an amazing group of people that pride themselves in making a difference in the lives of others! Off to meet the teacher!\n\nFor the first time in 5 years my wife and I were able to take a well needed vacation. The reason we did not take a vacation was not financial – it was because we could not leave our business and confidently know that everything would be taken care of while we were gone. It is such a relief to have everyone on the same page and understand how important it is for a loan officer’s reputation and future business to make closing dates. I want to take this moment to commend you and your team on creating the team and the systems that create superb service. I have been searching on behalf of my team for years to find an organization such as yours only to find empty promises and systems that delay progress of files that cause missed closing dates or always cause scrambling last minute and calling in “favors.” I appreciate your efforts and I am now beginning to believe what you have been telling me from the beginning, “Don’t worry about that because you will not be leaving Cornerstone”. And, I don’t intend to.\n\nOn behalf of the Bellaire branch, I’d like to extend a big CONGRATULATIONS on being selected Lender of the Year for Colorado! As our Regional Production Manager you have been very instrumental in our success. With your help, and the backing of Cornerstone, our branch has grown from 2 loan officers and a contract processor in a 900 sq ft office in July 2007, to 10 employees in a 2900 sq ft office today. We’ve set new branch records in number of units closed last month for our branch of 33, and volume of $5,447,698. We’ve also already exceeded our total volume of $29.44MM and units of 155 for the ENTIRE year of 2008 this year just through the month of July 2009 with $32.2MM volume and 175 units. We’re very excited about our growth, and with people like Julie, Cornerstone, and all of you on our team, we’re looking forward to everyone’s continued success. Again, a big CONGRATULATIONS and THANK YOU to Julie for all of her hard work, and a big CONGRATULATIONS to the entire Bellaire Branch for making this all happen.\n\nThank you for sending me a link to this video! I can’t express to you how excited I am to be part of a company that truly cares about its employees. I’m a part of the Cedar Park team which works out of the Austin office. Let me just say, there isn’t a person in this office that wouldn’t give you the shirt of his/her back or take 5 minutes to help you find an answer to a question. It’s an amazing feeling to come into a workplace full of employees who truly enjoy the company they work for. I have had 2 rushed files close over the last week that wouldn’t have even been close to making the closing date at my previous company. THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I CAME TO CORNERSTONE!!! Thank you for bringing me on board with Cornerstone!\n\nThanks so much for asking. We’re doing well and learning a lot. Sharla and her team have been getting used to Cornerstone, which has gone very well. Things have been such an improvement over our previous work environment I have had to keep reminding Sharla that we will occasionally have road bumps and a few disappointments. That has been true, but they are just part of the business of mortgages, and fortunately have been few and far between. Each week brings a greater understanding of just how committed this company and its people are to providing an excellent experience for mortgage customers and those who serve them. Mary Dinkins is exceptional. So Martha and Cindy and Sandy and Chris and Derek and…well, I’m going to risk getting in trouble if I leave anyone of the so many out. Suffice it to say, we recognize there are some gifted people in the organization. We feel very blessed and know there is a reason we ended up here.\n\nOh!! I LOVE working for Cornerstone Mortgage: the experience has changed my life tremendously! Just over a year ago, I moved here from Ohio with my one-year-old son and got the opportunity to come work for Cornerstone. You all had such faith in me, and, now, twelve months later, I have already moved up from being the receptionist to that of an appraisal coordinator covering four different branches! I would never have thought such opportunity was out there, so, again, I thank you very much for having the confidence in me that allows me to progress in your wonderful company. I truly mean this from the bottom of my heart. I actually look forward to coming and doing my job each day (Working with such great people can make anyone enjoy their job). There is not a day that goes by that I don’t thank the Lord for leading me in this direction. You and your company are a true blessing to my son and me.\n\nOkay… my eyes are swollen and my nose is raw, and I think I may need a ride home because my contacts are messed up. The Cornerstone Care check that I received is amazing: I have sincerely never been touched by so much kindness and love as I have by my coworkers here and the Cornerstone Family as a whole. I know that there are always people out there going through so much more and struggling through tough times as well, especially these days. Coming to work where I receive such encouragement from everyone has been my escape into normalcy these days and has provided a place of strength and protection for all of my family. I appreciate more than I could ever express how much your generosity has helped us as a family get through this period of time (it has been financially, emotionally, and mentally draining). Most of all, my team’s prayerful and demonstrative support has given my family and me the strength to keep our heads up. From the daily outpouring of love and concern to the flexibility of hours that allows me to deal with the important issues and have the time to give heartfelt support to my child, I say thank you!"
