        "text": "Overview\n\nMeredith Plummer has practiced in Gunster’s Labor & Employment group since 2015. Meredith represents primarily businesses in employment-related disputes of all kinds, such as discrimination and retaliation claims, contract and non-compete disputes, accommodation claims, among others. Meredith has extensive litigation experience both in her time at Gunster as well as her former role as a prosecutor for the State Attorney’s Office in Brevard County, Florida.\n\nMeredith uses her litigation experience when consulting with companies on human resource issues. Meredith’s trial perspective shapes her consulting advice and assists clients in avoiding litigation altogether by thinking in long-term strategy. Meredith’s consulting practice includes working with businesses in providing reasonable accommodations, complying with FMLA and FLSA requirements, disciplining and terminating employees in a manner that avoids or minimizes the risk of litigation, drafting and implementing HR policies, drafting contracts including non-competes, proving employee and managerial trainings, and ensuring legal compliance. Meredith regularly conducts or oversees investigations into employee complaints when they are sensitive in nature or require an independent, outside party.\n\nMeredith prioritizes reliability, communication, and timeliness when tending to client needs and enjoys advocating for clients and achieving just outcomes. She also aims to help clients improve their employee relations and implement best practices to minimize areas of exposure. Outside of her legal practice, Meredith enjoys raising her two young sons together with her husband."
