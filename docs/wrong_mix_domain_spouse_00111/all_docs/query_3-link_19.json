Del Castillo has two siblings: a sister, the journalist Verónica del Castillo, and a half-brother, Ponciano, from her father's side.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly works[]\n\nDel Castillo made her acting debut in 1978 when she took part in a film called The Last Escape.

The film grossed $23.3 million against $1.7 million budget.[2] She also starred in a number of independent movies, include The Black Pimpernel (2007) and Julia alongside Tilda Swinton.[3]\n\nIn November 2007, Del Castillo was named one of the \"Stars of the Year\" and in 2011 one of the \"25 most influential women\" and \"50 most beautiful\" by People en Español magazine.[4][5] In 2009, del Castillo was appointed Ambassador for the Mexican Commission on Human Rights and the following year she helped launch the Blue Heart Campaign in order to raise awareness and fight human trafficking.[6]\n\n2011—present[]\n\nIn 2011, Del Castillo starred as Teresa \"La Mexicana\" Mendoza in the Telemundo telenovela La reina del sur based on a novel of the same name by Spanish author Arturo Pérez-Reverte, a role that skyrocketed her fame across Latin America. With a $10 million budget it is the second most expensive telenovela ever produced by Telemundo.[7] The series later was renewed for a second season, that premiered in 2019.[8] del Castillo continued her collaboration with Telemundo in 2015, starring in Duenos del Paraiso. The telenovela is inspired by the drug trade of Miami in the 1970s.[9] She also appeared in a number of American television shows, include CSI: Miami, Grimm and Dallas. In 2015, she had a recurring role as Rogelio de la Vega's ex-wife in the CW comedy series, Jane the Virgin.[10]\n\nOn November 20, 2015 Del Castillo launched a new brand of tequila named Honor del Castillo in association with the Vivanco Family. She serves as the spokesperson for the brand. Del Castillo has also appeared in advertising campaigns for L'Oréal and Ford.[11]\n\nIn 2012, Del Castillo starred in the Mexican film Colosio: El asesinato, which centers around the assassination of the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. The following year, she starred in the American prison drama film K-11. In later years, Del Castillo appeared in many American movies, including playing Idris Elba's ex in the 2014 thriller No Good Deed, Antonio Banderas' wife in the disaster-survival drama The 33, All About Nina (2018), El Chicano (2019), and Bad Boys for Life (2020).[12] In 2017, she went to star in the Netflix political thriller series, Ingobernable playing the fictional First Lady of Mexico, Emilia Urquiza.[13] The second season premiered in 2018.\n\nIn 2019, del Castillo made her off-Broadway debut in the Audible Theater production of Isaac Gomez's play The Way She Spoke.[14] The performance earned her Drama Desk, Drama League, and Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Play nominations, making her the first Mexican actress to be nominated for three theatre awards in New York.[15]\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nOne of del Castillo's first known romantic relations was with Emilio Azcarraga Jean son of media mogul Emilio Azcárraga Milmo, and now CEO of the largest mass media company in Latin America, the Televisa Group.[16] On February 3, 2001, she married football player Luis García. The marriage was dissolved on September 1, 2004. In August 2009, del Castillo married Aarón Díaz in a Las Vegas ceremony. On July 26, 2011, it was announced that Kate and Díaz were separating. Del Castillo was briefly romantically connected with Sean Penn from 2015 to 2016, although the actor's representatives contest this.[17] It has been frequently asserted in the media that del Castillo was romantically involved with Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman, allegations that the actress vehemently denies.\n\nOn August 22, 2005, it was reported by the LAPD that del Castillo's new house in Los Angeles had been broken into by thieves, who took some jewelry from the actress. Del Castillo was in Los Angeles filming Bordertown, a film about the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, when the burglary occurred. A frequent activist for a variety of causes, she posed in a 2012 PETA ad campaign encouraging pet owners to \"fiercely protect\" their dogs and cats by keeping them indoors.[18] She became a citizen of the United States in September 2015 and currently resides in Los Angeles.[19]\n\nDuring an interview with Cristina Saralegui on the Cristina Show, del Castillo revealed that her favorite band is the English new wave band Duran Duran.[20]\n\nRelationship with El Chapo[]\n\nOn January 9, 2012, del Castillo publicly posted an essay on Twitter (using Twextra) discussing social issues in Mexico[21] that included controversial statements directed towards Joaquín Guzmán Loera, the infamous head of the Sinaloa Cartel. The essay included requests to Mr. Guzman to \"deal with love, with good things\" and to \"[begin to] traffic in love.\" The most controversial portion of the essay stated: \"Today I believe more in Chapo Guzmán [than in] the government that hides painful truths from me, that hides the cure for cancer, AIDS, etc., for their own benefit and wealth.\" [22][23][24][25][26][27]\n\nUnbeknownst to del Castillo, Guzman was a longtime fan who harbored romantic feelings for her. Authorities found DVDs of La Reina del Sur at the safe house stormed during Guzman's initial capture.[28] Del Castillo was contacted by Guzman's lawyer to discuss producing a biographical film about Guzman in 2014.[29] As a result of the meetings, she obtained the rights to his life and was unknowingly placed under CISEN surveillance. Communication increased following Guzman's escape from prison in July 2015.[29] She received a cell phone and the code names Hermosa and Dama from Guzman.[30] She brokered an interview between American actor Sean Penn and Guzmán in October 2015, shortly before Mexican Marines recaptured him (del Castillo claims in her documentary for Netflix that she did not know Penn intended to interview the drug lord during the meeting).[31][32] CISEN later released photographs of del Castillo at the meetings with Guzman's lawyer and of the arrival of the actress and Penn to Mexico.\n\nAftermath[]\n\nSean Penn and Del Castillo's actions remain under investigation by the PGR.[30] She was subpoenaed on January 18, 2016 and was to testify before the public prosecutor at the Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles.[33] Del Castillo was originally under investigation for money laundering in relation to the planned movie about Guzmán and her tequila brand Honor del Castillo.[34] Said investigation was suspended in 2017 as there was no evidence that proved that Guzmán ever paid del Castillo any money.\n\nOn February 5, 2016, a Mexican judge granted del Castillo's petition for an injunction against any arrest related to the federal investigation into her ties with Joaquín Guzmán. The Mexican Attorney General issued a detain-and-interrogate order on del Castillo; however, that would only become effective if del Castillo set foot on Mexican soil. That order was issued after she did not heed a request to voluntarily appear before Mexican prosecutors.[35]\n\nKate del Castillo has not returned to Mexico since the injunction was issued[36] and filming locations for Ingobernable were changed to San Diego to accommodate restrictions on her travel.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1978 Los de abajo 1990 El último escape Bárbara 1997 Educación sexual en breves lecciones Ana 1997 Reclusorio Estrella Uribe Segment: \"Sangre entre mujeres\" 2004 Avisos de ocasión Amanda 2005 American Visa Blanca 2006 Bordertown Elena Díaz 2006 Lime Salted Love Isabella Triebel 2007 El precio de la inocencia / Trade Laura 2007 The Black Pimpernel Consuelo Fuentes 2007 Under the Same Moon Rosario Reyes 2008 Julia Elena 2008 Bad Guys Zena 2009 Down for Life Esther 2011 ¿Y dónde están los hombres?
