Broom. “The memoir from Louisiana native Broom tells the story of her mother’s beloved shotgun house in east New Orleans and the family she raised there. The house was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, and Broom writes about the racial and economic inequality that has haunted New Orleans for decades. Author Heidi Julavits called the book “a masterpiece of history, politics, sociology and memory.”~ from a Los Angeles Times review\n\n[Back to Top]\n\nMemoirs of celebrity, scandal,\n\ngossip, and secrets\n\n• The Art of the Hollywood Memoir (Rachel Syme, New Yorker, 7-30-21) Accounts of life in Tinseltown reveal as much as they seek to hide.

She grew up in the '40s on the Welsh border, in the crossfire between her grandparents, a bitter, bibulous, bookish vicar resembling Jack Sprat and his short, \"fat doll\" of an ignorant wife. He preached earthy sermons about how one might prefer for a wife \"Martha before dinner, Mary after dinner.\" His wife's \"notion of marriage [was] that a man signed you up to have his wicked way with you and should spend the rest of his life paying through the nose.\" Grandma blackmailed the vicar with his diary of adultery, in which she scribbled vicious comments invaluable to the family historian.\"--from an Amazon review.\n\n• James Dickey: The World as a Lie by Henry Hart. Poet and novelist James Dickey \"made lying both a literary strategy and a protective camouflage; even his family and closest friends failed to distinguish between the mythical James Dickey and the actual man. Henry Hart sees lying as the central theme to Dickey's life; and in this authoritative, immensely entertaining biography he delves deep behind Dickey's many masks.\"\n\n• Diana: Her True Story--in Her Own Words by Andrew Morton.

Even the reviews suck you in. See, for example, 'There's more to life than men' (The Telegraph, 3-18-02)\n\n• Must You Go?: My Life with Harold Pinter by Antonia Fraser. \"It takes a daring biographer to turn her sharp eye on her own life as Antonia Fraser does so movingly and beautifully in her memoir Must You Go? My Life with Harold Pinter. It's a compelling diary of a passionate love affair, marriage, and 40-year conversation of two soul mates in the milieu of London's chattering classes.\"\n\n—Tina Brown, The Daily Beast\n\n• My Ear at His Heart: Reading My Father by Hanif Kureishi. \"It is family memoir, autobiography and cultural history combined. . . . With what feels like unmitigated honesty Kureishi successfully conveys the impression that in this book he has actually given us himself.” —The Sunday Times (London)\n\n• No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel by Janice Dickinson. Supermodel Dickinson's sex- and booze-soaked autobiography brings readers on a roller-coaster ride through the world of modeling, the emptiness of superficial relationships and the perils of drug addiction. Admitting that \"terror is a great motivator,\" Dickinson fought like a tigress to establish her career. “Janice . . . speaks with the candor of Cher, the bite of Joan Rivers and the sexual bonhomie of Mae West.” (Liz Smith, New York Post)\n\n• Oh the Glory of It All by Sean Wilsey. \"Wilsey's father was a distant, wealthy man who used a helicopter when a moped would do and whose mandates included squeegeeing the stall after every shower. Much of Wilsey's youth was spent as subservient to, or rebelling against this imposing man. But the maternal figures in Wilsey's childhood were no less affecting. His mother, a San Francisco society butterfly turned globe-trotting peace promoter, seemed to behave only in extremes--either trying to convince young Sean to commit suicide with her, or arranging impromptu meetings with the Pope and Mikhail Gorbachev. And Dede, his demon of a stepmother, would have made the Brothers Grimm shiver. \" \"It took the unlikely combination of the three of them--mother, father, stepmother--to make me who I am.\" It's a fairly basic conclusion after 479 pages of turning every stone, but it's also one that renders his story--more than shocking or glorious--human.\" --review by Brangien Davis\n\n• Oh the Hell of It All: A Life Beyond Imaginings by\n\nPat Montandon, Sean Wilsey's mother, in a sequel/response to his memoir. Reared in Oklahoma, the daughter of Nazarene ministers, she fled in the 1960s for the excitement and glamour of San Francisco, where she created a life as a newspaper columnist, television host, and writer. Her best friend married her husband, a multimillionaire who left her 'high and dry' after their divorce.\n\n• On the House: Washington Memoir by John Boehner. \"A politician's honest accountings of repeated failures rather than self-inflated successes.” ~ NPR\n\n• Rage To Survive: The Etta James Story by Etta James and David Ritz. Born to a 14-year-old mother and raised by surrogate parents, blues and R&B star James started singing gospel in church at five, was discovered at 14 and had a rapid rise to fame. Nevertheless, her story is a disturbing saga of drug addiction, jail sentences for writing bad checks and stealing prescription drugs, involvements with the wrong men and anger at a disruptive and unstable mother who has refused to reveal who her daughter's father is. It's easy to see why James says she has been \"raging through life.\" She claims it's the rage that keeps her going. Now, at the age of 56, she reports she has kicked the drug habit, reached an understanding with her mother and settled down with her husband and children, letting off steam by dirt biking.\n\n• Those who write memoirs know--the truth must be told (Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, Independent, 1-18-10) The dishy tone of this piece, discovered belatedly 7 years after it was published, reminded me of a guilty secret: That many of us secretly read overrevelatory and gossipy memoirs that we don't admit we're enjoying. First, I'll link to the books she writes about (I get a tiny commission on any Amazon sales this link leads to) and then I'll add to the list, in no particular order. I paid for my own copies, but you can find most of them in the library.\n\n• Whatever...Love Is Love: Questioning the Labels We Give Ourselves by Maria Bello. Actress and activist Maria Bello made waves with her essay, “Coming Out as a Modern Family,” in the New York Times popular “Modern Love” column, in which she recalled telling her son that she had fallen in love with her best friend, a woman—and her relief at his easy and immediate acceptance with the phrase “Whatever Mom, love is love.” She made a compelling argument about the fluidity of partnerships, and how families today come in a myriad of designs. In her first book, Bello broadens her insights as she examines the idea of partnership in every woman’s life, and her own. She examines the myths that so many of us believe about partnership—that the partnership begins when the sex begins, that partnerships are static, that you have to love yourself before you can be loved, and turns them on their heads.\n\n• \"An actor is a group animal and a writer is a solitary animal. For a group person to isolate themselves and have just themselves to feed off is very complicated.
