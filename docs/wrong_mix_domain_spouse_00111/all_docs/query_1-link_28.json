        "text": "Message from the Chair\n\nDepartment Spotlights\n\nDepartment Announcements\n\nPublications\n\nFarewells\n\nAlumni Updates/Class Notes\n\nMessage from the Chair\n\nI’ll be brief, as the contents of this 2016 Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences newsletter speak more effectively than I ever could about the diverse and exciting ways in which our faculty and students are pursuing their love of psychology and strengthening our collective contribution to the University and society. We had a great year in 2015-2016: The clinical psychology program was reaccredited by APA, our expenditures of research funds from outside grants to 11 different faculty members totaled $2,376,948; we incorporated John Philbeck and Steve Mitroff into the cognitive neuroscience program last academic year and welcomed a new clinical psychology faculty member, Sarah Calabrese, this fall (see below); and we launched four new advanced lab/writing in the discipline courses and a new summer institute on the cognitive neuroscience of consciousness to enhance the undergraduate major.\n\nWe are proud of our community and its accomplishments and view all of you as an important part of that community. We also thank many of you—alumni, students and friends—for keeping in touch and supporting our efforts.\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nCarol Sigleman\n\nChair, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences\n\nBack to top\n\nDepartment Spotlights\n\nTHE MAGNETIC PULL OF GW'S PSYCOLOGICAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES DEPARTMENT\n\nA sign of a healthy and happy department is that former members find their way back. GW’s Psychological and Brain Sciences Department is proud that six of our current faculty members have returned to campus after leaving. Dr. Peg Barratt, MPhil ’78, was a GW graduate student; Drs. Sarah Calabrese, MPhil ’08, PhD ’12, Lisa Bowleg, MA ’91, PhD ’97, and Sarah Friedman, PhD ’75, all earned their PhDs in our department; and Drs. Tonya Dodge and John Philbeck are both in their second stints as GW faculty. Dr. Calabrese is our newest returning member, having just joined the faculty this year.\n\nWhat is the pull that brings so many people back? “Colleagues and community,” said Dr. Calabrese. “This was a unique opportunity for me to reconnect with some of the people I’ve learned the most from and worked best with, and to do so in a new capacity. Also, as an HIV researcher, I was motivated to contribute to the HIV prevention efforts in the local D.C. community, which is the community I’ve always considered to be home and a community disproportionately affected by HIV.”\n\nDr. Philbeck’s return was largely driven by the environment in the department; he added, “It’s about as drama-free as an academic department can be! The kind of collegiality that the GW Psychological and Brain Sciences Department has is so rare, and it’s something that goes back years and years.”\n\nDr. Barratt’s return was both personal and professional; her first child was born at the old GW Hospital while she was a student, and he now lives in D.C. Dr. Barratt came back to GW as dean of Columbian College of Arts and Sciences to help build a stronger GW for both undergraduate and graduate students. She was also largely pulled back by the students. “GW students are smart and engaged—they work hard to relate their psychology courses to their worlds,” said Dr. Barratt.\n\nDr. Dodge was attracted back by the department and university’s focus on both teaching and research. She stated, \"The environment pushes me to become a well-rounded academic. I cannot focus on a single aspect, for example, teaching only or research only. I am challenged to ignite passion in my students while also conducting meaningful research that will advance the field.\"\n\nDr. Bowleg cited three reasons for her return. “First, I had very fond memories of the engaging and supportive faculty—two of my (now) colleagues were dissertation committee members, and another was an independent study mentor. Second, the excellent doctoral training I received here helped launch me into a successful career as a social psychologist. The third lure, given my work as an HIV prevention researcher, was the DC-Center for AIDS Research (DC-CFAR). The DC-CFAR, which is housed at GW, provides HIV prevention researchers with a wealth of resources and opportunities for collaboration, and mentorship.”\n\nDr. Friedman was drawn back by several factors, but perhaps the most important was an invitation from Dr. Barratt, the then-dean of the Columbian College. She also stated she was influenced by her “wish to continue a research collaboration with Drs. Sigelman and Rohrbeck on the topic of military families and their children.” In addition, she was looking forward to giving back to GW by mentoring students.\n\nWe are lucky to have all of them back home here at GW!\n\nWHAT'S NEW WITH PSI CHI\n\nPsi Chi newest members along with faculty advisor, Dr. Dennis Schell\n\nPsi Chi President Mali Zaken and Faculty Advisor Dennis Schell report that Psi Chi at GW is flourishing. Psi Chi provides students with the resources necessary to obtain psychology-related information, create professional networks and learn about career opportunities. Psi Chi has become a community for its members, who all share a passion for psychology. Four exciting events took place this fall:\n\nOctober 19th: Graduate School Night for students planning to go on to graduate school in psychology\n\nOctober 27th: Declaration Day, during which Psi Chi provided peer advising for students who want to declare psychology as a major or minor\n\nNovember 13th: Fall induction of new members\n\nNovember 15th: Interview Skills Workshop for students who are planning to interview for graduate school or employment in the field\n\nAnd, of course, we have a great line-up for the spring semester.\n\nNEW NEUROSCIENCE SUMMER INSTITUTE\n\nHands-on learning in cognitive neuroscience\n\nWhat is consciousness and how does it arise in the brain? Students pondered this question as members of the department’s first Summer Institute in Cognitive Neuroscience. The institute explored the role of brain rhythms in states of awareness, drugs as windows into the mind and the foundations of the self in memory and bodily awareness. The curriculum included classroom-based courses, a research practicum, a field trip to an imaging lab and guest lectures by cutting-edge workers in the field. The faculty and graduate student instructors worked with the 11 students to actively adapt the curriculum and activities to match the students’ interests in cognitive neuroscience, medicine and clinical psychology. The department thanks Associate Professor Stephen Dopkins for his great work in leading this exciting new opportunity for our undergraduate students!\n\nBack to top\n\nDepartment Announcements\n\nFACULTY KUDOS\n\nParticipation in a new $150 million multi-institutional grant from NIH: Professor Jody Ganiban and colleagues at University of Oregon and Penn State will participate in a major $150 million dollar, multi-year, multi-site project aimed at understanding early environmental influences on children’s health and health disparities.
