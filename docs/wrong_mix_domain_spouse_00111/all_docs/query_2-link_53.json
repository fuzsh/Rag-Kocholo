The series is based on Piper Kerman's memoir, Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison (2010), about her experiences at FCI Danbury, a minimum-security federal prison. Created and adapted for television by Jenji Kohan. In July 2011, Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate for a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs.[1] The series began filming in the old Rockland Children's Psychiatric Center in Rockland County, New York, on March 7, 2013.[2] The title sequence features photos of real former female prisoners including Kerman herself.[3]\n\nThe series revolves around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a woman in her 30s living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a minimum-security women's federal prison (initially operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections,\" a fictional version of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and later acquired by Management & Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company) in upstate New York. Piper had been convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her then-girlfriend Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), an international drug smuggler.\n\nOrange is the New Black received critical acclaim.

Piper also meets Sam Healy (Michael J. Harney), her homophobic counselor who deals with many of the inmates' problems. Struggling to adjust to the dynamics of the prison, Piper's problems are further compounded when she discovers that her former lover, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), is in the same prison as her.

A scared straight program arrives at the prison; the inmates attempt to intimidate the visiting juvenile delinquents, but they have difficulty intimidating Dina, a young paraplegic \"gangster\". Piper succeeds by telling Dina the scariest part of prison is coming face-to-face with who you really are.

Miss Claudette reunites with Baptiste. Tricia returns from the SHU and struggles to make amends with Red. Mendez manipulates Tricia into selling his drugs. Upon clocking Tricia's state, Mendez locks her in a closet to prevent her from revealing the drugs. When he returns, Mendez discovers Tricia had taken all the drugs, overdosed, and died.

During their encounter, however, Mendez uses a condom. After Piper learns that psych is worse than SHU, she successfully petitions Caputo to have Pennsatucky returned to general population. Piper's bravery brings Alex closer to her. Miss Claudette and Baptiste anticipate her potential release. Piper and several other inmates listen to Larry's NPR interview; Larry's comments are hurtful towards Suzanne and Miss Claudette, and his comments regarding fidelity convinces Piper that he knows about her relationship with Alex.

Returning to camp, Claudette angrily chokes CO Fischer, which results in her being sent to maximum security. Unable to adjust to life outside, Taystee purposely commits a crime to return to the prison. A journalist following Larry's interview asks Natalie Figueroa, the deputy warden, about spending cuts at Litchfield, despite an increase in the prison's funding. Alex admits she ratted on Piper for dumping her, but she had lied in order to rekindle their relationship. Larry asks Piper to marry him immediately. Pennsatucky is encouraged by her lawyer to \"witness\" to Piper. Following Pennsatucky's instructions, Piper \"prays\" for forgiveness, but she refuses to be baptized. Pennsatucky sees this refusal as another instance of being \"disrespected\" and announces her plans to murder Piper.\n\nFlashback: Pennsatucky shoots and kills an abortion provider who made a snide remark about her fifth abortion. A Christian anti-abortion group mistakenly believe Pennsatucky's act was to stop abortions; they declare her a hero for their movement and provide her with pro bono legal help.

She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she \"screwed up\" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation.[4] Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, Piper Chapman, as a \"trojan horse\" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV.[5] In July 2011, it was revealed that Netflix was in negotiations with Lionsgate for a 13-episode TV adaptation of Kerman's memoirs with Kohan as creator.[1] In November 2011, negotiations were finalized and the series had been greenlit.[6]\n\nCasting announcements began in August 2012 with Taylor Schilling, the first to be cast, in the lead role as Piper Chapman,[7] followed by Jason Biggs as Piper's fiancé Larry Bloom.[8] Laura Prepon and Yael Stone were next to join the series.[9] Abigail Savage, who plays Gina, and Alysia Reiner, who plays Fig, had auditioned for role of Alex Vause.[4][10] Prepon initially auditioned for Piper Chapman,[11] however Kohan felt she would not worry about her [in prison], noting a \"toughness and a presence to her that wasn’t right for the character.\" Kohan instead gave her the role of Alex.[4] Stone had originally auditioned for the role of Nicky Nichols, but she was not considered \"tough enough\" for the character;[12] she was asked to audition for Lorna Morello instead.[13] Likability was important for Morello, whom casting director Jen Euston deemed \"a very helpful, nice, sweet Italian girl.\"[13] Laverne Cox, a black transgender woman, was cast as Sophia Burset, a transgender character. The Advocate touted Orange Is the New Black as possibly the first women-in-prison narrative to cast a transgender woman for this type of role.[14] Natasha Lyonne was to audition for Alex, but was asked to read for the character Nicky Nichols; \"[Kohan knew] she could do Nicky with her eyes closed. She was perfect,\" said Euston.[13] Uzo Aduba read for the part of Janae Watson but was offered the character Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren.[13][15] Taryn Manning was offered the role of Tiffany \"Pennsatucky\" Doggett.[13] This American Life host Ira Glass was offered a role as a public radio host, but he declined. The role instead went to Robert Stanton, who plays the fictional host Maury Kind.[16]\n\nOrange Is the New Black has received critical acclaim, particularly praised for humanizing prisoners[17][18] and for its depiction of race, sexuality, gender and body types.[19] The first season received positive reviews from critics, review aggregator Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating favorable reviews.[20] On Rotten Tomatoes, season one has a 93% approval rating based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10 . The site's critical consensus is \"Orange Is the New Black is a sharp mix of black humor and dramatic heft, with interesting characters and an intriguing flashback structure.\"[21]\n\nHank Stuever, television critic for The Washington Post, gave Orange Is the New Black a perfect score. In his review of the series, he stated: \"In Jenji Kohan's magnificent and thoroughly engrossing new series, Orange Is the New Black, prison is still the pits. But it is also filled with the entire range of human emotion and stories, all of which are brought vividly to life in a world where a stick of gum could ignite either a romance or a death threat.\"[22] Maureen Ryan, of The Huffington Post, wrote: \"Orange is one of the best new programs of the year, and the six episodes I've seen have left me hungry to see more.\"[23]\n\nOrange Is the New Black was considered one of the best shows of the year by many critics and journalists.[24]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Ref.
