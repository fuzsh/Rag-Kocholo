British music-hall comedian Max Miller ("The Cheeky Chappie") always had difficulty transferring his risque style to films, principally because the censors were on their guard the moment he sashayed into view. Asking for Trouble is a relatively "clean" Miller farce, though Max manages to slip a few double-entendres under the door. This time, Miller poses as a big game hunter, armed with an empty weapon and a litany of wheezy old gags. His ruse is designed to rescue the daughter (Carol Lynne) of a general (Mark Lester) from the lechery of genuine hunter Wilfred Hyde-White. When inspiration flags in the script department, Miller tosses in one of his inimitable comic songs. Asking for Trouble was the last of Max Miller's fourteen film appearances.
