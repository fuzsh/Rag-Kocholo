Since the interpretations of the plays change through the centuries, you might see them grouped differently in other places. An additional group, 'problem plays', has sometimes been used to categorise All's Well That Ends Well, Measure for Measure and Troilus and Cressida.\n\nClick on a play to find summaries, dates and sources, past RSC productions (images and videos), education resources and famous quotes."
