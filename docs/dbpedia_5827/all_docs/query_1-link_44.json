        "text": "Inspired by a virtual world in which opinions are obliterated by the egos driving them, this is about imposing your gigantic, spoon-faced, loud-mouthed image alongside every issue. This is “selfie-speak”.\n\nAs any child who has just discovered swearing will tell you, it’s not hard to silence a room and get every face in it turned towards yours. You can literally eff and blind your way into public consciousness, like Labour MP Neil Coyle, who told my husband to “go f--- yourself” when he lambasted MPs for using their murdered colleague Jo Cox in a “viciously tribal Brexit war”.\n\nYou can invoke the Nazis whimsically and constantly and brand every unwelcome thought “fascist”. You can reduce one of the most complex national debates in our political history to simplistic trigger terms such as “surrender” and “betrayal”, like our Prime Minister did last week.\n\nNot that the genteel Left are immune to the allure of selfie-speak. Last year, former shadow international development secretary Kate Osamor told another newspaper’s reporter, when asked for a comment: “I should have come down here with a bat and smashed your face in.”\n\nAnd back in 2015, Labour MP Jess Phillips – who has criticised the PM’s inflammatory rhetoric and likes to play on the sweet, hard-baked, tell-it-like-it-isn’t-actually Brummie lass persona – said she’d happily knife Jeremy Corbyn “in the front, not the back”. In an interview at the weekend, Phillips conceded that she could “behave myself better”. But, then again, “Parliament is theatre”.\n\nThe trouble with theatre is that it can all too quickly fall into farce. And when the public is depending on you to ensure that the current Brexit production doesn’t run on as long as The Mousetrap, another analogy might have been preferable. But in basically saying “come on, we all like to show off”, Phillips was at least being honest: unfiltered.\n\nWhich is the compliment du jour. It’s what selfie-speakers such as comedian Jo Brand hope they’re going to be called when they make jokes about throwing battery acid at politicians, and what the Left-wing protesters who last month chanted “People often ask us what it is that makes us tick — it’s Boris Johnson’s head upon a stick, stick, stick ” probably call themselves.\n\nThe school mum who “confronts” (read: “verbally abuses”) teachers at the school gates is doubtless praised by her circle for her “lack of filter”, as presumably are the surprising number of men and women I know who have taken to using the C-word to describe people in conversation – when I’ve always felt that a good, heartfelt “twat” will suffice.\n\nBut “measured” gets drowned out, alongside decorum and civility. So instead it’s: “Ha! Made you look!” It’s talking in clickbait, with every look and click elevating your real-life ‘follower’ count and stoking your ego, and language meanwhile being devalued to nothing.\n\nWhich might work out well. Because once it’s all worthless, the narcissists will have to find another currency – and with the level of discourse what it is, I’m thinking a handful of angry red face emojis complete with grawlixes (the graphic for bleeping out a word) would do the job just fine.\n\nRead Celia Walden at telegraph.co.uk every Monday, 7pm"
