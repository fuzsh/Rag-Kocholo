What if I need a collective noun that covers both meanings? Which words are appropriate, in BrE and AmE?\n\nThanks very much.\n\nNOT A TEACHER\n\nYou're being silly. lol\n\nDrama is a genre of motion pictures.\n\nThis is not a nice thing to say.\n\nWe are all learning.\n\nDrama means more than a genre of motion pictures.\n\nA drama is also 'a serious narrative work of program for television, radio or the cinema'\n\nhttp://www.thefreedictionary.com/drama\n\nnot a teacher\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=drama&num_votes=1000,&sort=moviemeter&title_type=tv_series\n\nThe title is 'Most Popular Drama TV Series ...'.\n\nIt seems that 'drama' can also refer to TV series.\n\nYou're being silly. lol\n\nAll of us are learners, who must sometimes be silly. We should help instead of laugh at each other.\n\nNot a teacher.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?genres=drama&num_votes=1000,&sort=moviemeter&title_type=tv_series\n\nThe title is 'Most Popular Drama TV Series ...'.\n\nIt seems that 'drama' can also refer to TV series.\n\nAll of us are learners, who must sometimes be silly. We should help instead of laugh at each other.\n\nNot a teacher.\n\nA type of TV series.\n\nNOT A TEACHER\n\nI'm sorry but I didn't mean to be rude by saying: \"You're being silly.\" I've seen that line countless times in movies and various TV series. It's somewhat like a joke. Is it that offensive? My dictionary says 'silly' is quite gentle.\n\nAs for the word 'drama', 'drama' is a type, a genre of movies, TV series, and radio. Hence, I don't think that's the word I'm looking for, a word that can replace the combination \"movies and TV series\". Does the word I'm searching not exist?\n\nI would add 'for' after 'searching', according to http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/search_2\n\nNot a teacher.\n\nIs it compulsory?\n\n\"Hollywood\" comes closest.\n\nCould you give an example where \"Hollywood\" replaces \"movie and TV series\", please?\n\nIs it compulsory?\n\n'For' is necessary before the thing you are looking for, but unnecessary before the place where you do the searching, according to the dictionary quoted above.\n\nNot a teacher."
