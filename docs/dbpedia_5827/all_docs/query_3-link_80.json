        "text": "English-language learners (ELLs) come into our classrooms with a wide variety of specific and unique needs for language acquisition. They aren't a monolith: ELLs represent a diverse range of students in every sense. As an educator, meeting everyone's individual needs is a consistent challenge.\n\nBecause there are so many apps and edtech tools available today, you might expect to find that lots of them have been made specifically for English language development (ELD), bilingual, or dual-immersion classrooms. Unfortunately, this isn't the case: Tools designed specifically for English-language learners aren't always easy to find.\n\nThere are, nevertheless, a lot of great edtech tools and strategies you can use with ELLs. Also, the evolving abilities of generative AI tools are often helpful, even if the products themselves aren't ELL-specific. Some might even be tools you've already heard of or used—with an ELL-specific use case that's been hiding in plain sight.\n\nSo what's the best way to find and use great digital tools with your ELLs? A lot will depend on your students' specific needs, but here are a few things to think about when finding the best tools for your classroom.\n\nELL Support Within Tools\n\nLots of online tools have built-in features to support differentiated instruction for a variety of learners. For instance, Newsela offers texts at five variable Lexile levels, many in both English and Spanish. ThinkCERCA offers leveled texts with scaffolding for students reading at different levels, including audio versions of texts. Though ELA-focused tools are most likely to have the best English-learning support, plenty of other tools boost ELLs' learning in other subject areas. Khan Academy is one popular example: The site offers a translated version of its curriculum in 12 languages. As you search, keep in mind that these tools are usually aimed at a more general student audience, so they may be better suited to intermediate or advanced ELLs; beginning-level ELLs may need more robust support.\n\nTools to try: Newsela, ThinkCERCA, Khan Academy\n\nELL-Specific Tools\n\nAs mentioned earlier, tools designed only for ELLs are somewhat scarce, but there are definitely some options. BrainPOP ELL offers a comprehensive online curriculum aimed at improving kids' language skills from beginning to advanced levels. Read&Write is a helpful text-to-speech app for students with a variety of literacy needs, including English-language learners. On the flip side, a platform like Ellevation is designed for teachers and uses robust data to track and monitor students' progress and language growth. As time goes on, we're bound to see more edtech solutions specifically for ELLs.\n\nTools to try:BrainPOP ELL, Read&Write, Ellevation\n\nEveryday Tools into Daily Routines\n\nFrom basic translation to productivity tools for consumers, a lot of everyday apps and websites can be great for supporting ELL-centered learning activities. For example, a note-taking tool with recording features like Microsoft OneNote offers opportunities for speaking and listening practice. Simple English Wikipedia is just like it sounds: an adapted version of the standard Wikipedia site but for ELLs, younger students, or anyone else who might struggle with reading. A translation tool is an obvious choice, and Google Translate is generally thought to be the most accessible free option around.\n\nTools to try:Microsoft OneNote, Simple English Wikipedia, Google Translate\n\nCreativity and Multimedia\n\nAll students can benefit from multimodal opportunities to learn, and countless technology tools can facilitate these experiences. When screening educational videos in the classroom, for instance, consider using closed captioning to support ELLs. You may even explore the use of audio as a medium to help strengthen reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. Podcasts are one great (usually free!) way to integrate audio, and digital libraries like Epic! often have audiobooks as well.\n\nCreative projects and storytelling also give ELLs and bilingual learners of all abilities the chance to express themselves while they build new language skills. And keep in mind that lots of other digital-creation mediums can offer fun language-building practice, from video production to podcasting and digital design. Find something that suits your students' ages, language abilities, and interests. Book Creator is a great option for storytelling. Flip and Seesaw offer some ways for students to express themselves. And if you want to try out a tool that's entirely in Spanish, check out Historias Para Armar.\n\nTools to try:Epic!, Book Creator, Flip, Seesaw, Historias Para Armar\n\nAI-Based Learning Tools\n\nThere aren't too many AI-based learning tools that are focused primarily on ELL learners (yet), but AI tools can still be useful in instruction. After all, machine learning can provide personalized feedback, enhance content accessibility, facilitate the creation of audio and video content, and more. For instance, Knowji is an audio-visual vocabulary app that uses machine learning and algorithms to help students learn vocabulary, and Quillbot has a great translation feature. There are also plenty of voice-to-text AI applications like AudioPen that can quickly convert words to text, which could be useful to have students review their own speech or help with writing assignments. Real-time translation is getting better, and tools like MagicSchool.ai have solid embedded tools for ELL teachers. For ChatGPT, there's a guide to help you use it for learning languages. Before jumping in and extensively using AI tools for ELL learners (or any students), make sure to consider the risks that can come with an AI tool, like reinforcing bias and privacy risks.\n\nTools to try:Knowji, Quillbot, AudioPen, MagicSchool.ai, ChatGPT\n\nPractice Through Collaboration\n\nEven though many tools allow for personalized or individual practice, you should not overlook the power of social learning and collaboration with your ELL learners. You can facilitate group projects and other collaborative learning activities where your students can practice their language skills in a safe and supportive environment, perhaps using Google Drive. Think about using digital whiteboard apps, like Explain Everything to create low-risk group activities. Or try Padlet to annotate maps and practice new vocabulary.\n\nTools to try:Google Drive, Explain Everything, Padlet\n\nOnline Language-Learning Tools\n\nLanguage-learning tools for travelers and consumers are everywhere and easy to find. Although these tools should never replace high-quality classroom instruction, for some students they could be a helpful option for extra practice or out-of-class enrichment. Because they're often aimed at a general—mostly adult—audience, these won't all be the best choice for kids' learning. Nevertheless, in certain situations, some language-learning apps could be appropriate depending on your students' needs. If you do go this route, look for free options that offer adaptive features that challenge students as their language skills grow. If recommending for out-of-class use, keep in mind your students' devices and level of network access.\n\nTools to try:Duolingo, Rosetta Course, Mango Languages\n\nConnecting with Home\n\nEnsuring that your ELL students find success also means connecting with families. Fortunately, there are plenty of tools to keep lines of communication open with English language learners' families. For one, TalkingPoints is a multilingual texting tool to enhance school-to-home communication. Bloomz is a more comprehensive school-to-home communication platform that isn't designed for ELL learners and families, but it might be worth checking out!"
