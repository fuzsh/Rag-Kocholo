        "text": "Unlike other content areas, the NJSLS-WL is benchmarked by proficiency levels as shown below. The NJSLS-WL is sequentially organized as a continuum toward higher levels of proficiency. Each proficiency level benchmark includes grade bands: K–2, 3–5, 6–8, and 9–12.\n\nNovice Low: Students communicate using words and phrases that are memorized and practiced when talking about very familiar topics related to self, family, friends, school and home.\n\nNovice Mid: Students communicate using memorized words and some phrases to talk about familiar topics related to school, home, and the community.\n\nNovice High: Students communicate using words, lists, and simple sentences to ask and answer questions, to handle simple transactions related to everyday life, and to talk about subject matter studied in other classes.\n\nIntermediate Low: Students communicate using simple sentences to ask and answer questions, to handle simple transactions related to everyday life, and to talk about subject matter studied in other classes.\n\nIntermediate Mid: Students communicate using strings of sentences to ask and answer questions, to handle simple transactions related to everyday life, and to talk about subject matter studied in other classes.\n\nIntermediate High: Students communicate using connected sentences and paragraphs to handle complicated situations on a wide-range of topics.\n\nAdvanced Low: Students communicate using paragraph-level discourse to handle complicated situations on a wide-range of topics.\n\nModes of Communication\n\nEach proficiency level features the modes of communication, which represent the three core standards of World Languages.\n\nInterpretive Mode of Communication\n\nIn the Interpretive mode of communication, students demonstrate understanding of spoken and written communication within appropriate cultural contexts. Examples of this kind of one-way reading or listening include cultural interpretations of printed texts, videos, online texts, movies, radio and television broadcasts, and speeches. Beyond the Novice level, “interpretation” differs from “comprehension” because it implies the ability to read or listen “between the lines” and “beyond the lines.”\n\nInterpersonal Mode of Communication\n\nIn the Interpersonal mode of communication, students engage in direct oral and/or written communication with others. Examples of this “two-way” communication include conversing face-to-face, participating in online discussions or videoconferences, instant messaging and text messaging, and exchanging personal letters or e-mail messages.\n\nPresentational Mode of Communication\n\nIn the Presentational mode of communication, students present, orally and/or in writing, information, concepts and ideas to an audience of listeners or readers with whom there is no immediate interaction. Examples of this one-to-many mode of communication include a presentation to a group, posting an online video or webpage, creating and posting a podcast or videocast, and writing an article for a newspaper.\n\nThe modes of communication are explicated by core ideas and performance expectations — describing what students can do with the language they are learning at the targeted proficiency level. The intercultural statements build upon the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) statements for Intercultural Communication (Moeller & Yu, 2015). These statements underscore the intricate relationship between language and culture for establishing effective and positive relationships across cultural boundaries.\n\nThe practices are the skills that individuals who leverage their ability to speak multiple languages in their careers use on a regular basis. Because the purpose of World Languages is to provide students with the essential language skills and cultural understandings in languages other than English, many of the practices can be applied to daily life. These practices establish a strong link between communication and culture, which is applied when making connections and comparisons and in using language to function as part of local and global communities. Curriculum writers and educators will want to consider how they can design learning experiences that will enable their students to develop these skills in conjunction with the skills reflected in the core ideas and performance expectations (ACTFL, 2012).\n\nCommunicate\n\nCommunicate effectively in more than one language in order to function in a variety of situations and for multiple purposes.\n\nCultures\n\nLearners use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the relationship between the practices and perspectives, as well as the products and perspectives, of the cultures studied.\n\nConnections\n\nLearners use the language to investigate, explain, and reflect on the nature of language through comparisons of the language and cultures studied and their own.\n\nComparisons\n\nDevelop insight into the nature of language and culture in order to interact with cultural competence.\n\nCommunities\n\nLearners use the language both within and beyond the classroom to interact and collaborate in their community and the globalized world. Learners set goals and reflect on their progress in using languages for enjoyment, enrichment, and advancement.\n\nCurriculum and Instruction\n\nAre schools required to teach world languages?\n\nYes. All districts are required to have K–12 programs that ensure students meet the 2020 New Jersey Student Learning Standards for World Languages (NJSLS-WL). The 2020 NJSLS-WL includes benchmarks by proficiency levels with grade bands (K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12) indicated.\n\nWhat is considered a world language in New Jersey?\n\nDistricts may offer any language(s) they feel meets the needs and desires of community members to prepare students to live and work in a global, culturally diverse world.\n\nComputer programming languages are not considered a world language. The content and coursework for computer programming does not meet the expectations of NJSLS-WL. Computer programming languages are aligned and fall within the NJSLS-Computer Science and Design Thinking. Students are required to engage in world language and computer science. Neither should be in replacement or at the expense of the other.\n\nWhat are the requirements for world languages?\n\nAll districts are required to have K–12 programs that ensure students meet the New Jersey Student Learning Standards for World Languages. The 2020 NJSLS-WL has identified proficiency level benchmarks for grade bands: K–2, 3–5, 6–8, 9–12.\n\nN.J.A.C.6a:8-5.1(a)2ii, also known as Individualized Student Learning Opportunities (ISLO), allows students to demonstrate that they have achieved Novice High proficiency as defined by ACTFL (ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines, page 15, 27, 37, and 48) to fulfill the world languages requirements of NJSLS-WL.\n\nIs a student with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) required to take world language courses?\n\nAccording to N.J.A.C. 6A: 8-1.2 and 1.3, all students are required to be educated in all standards. Students with an IEP may be provided accommodations and modifications through the IEP process to ensure the student has an opportunity to learn and demonstrate what they know and can do in world languages. By law, a world language educator would be provided with a copy of a student’s IEP. Based on the student’s IEP, they would be expected to make the appropriate accommodations and modifications to help the student to be successful learning another language.\n\nIn terms of graduation requirements, N.J.A.C. 6A:14-4.11(a) states, \"The IEP of a student with a disability who enters a high school program shall specifically address the graduation requirements. The student shall meet the high school graduation requirements pursuant to N.J.A.C. 6A:8-5.1, except as specified in the student's IEP. The IEP shall specify which requirements would qualify the student with a disability for the State-endorsed diploma issued by the district board of education responsible for his or her education.”\n\nWhat does research indicate regarding the amount of instructional time for world languages?\n\nSwender & Duncan (1998) recommend 30–40 minute sessions 3–5 days a week for world language instruction in elementary school, 40–50 minutes daily for world language instruction in middle school and at high school world language is given the same instructional time as all other subjects.\n\nWhat is a “Model Program,” and where can I find more information about districts that are offering excellent multilingual instruction?\n\nModel Programs seek to recognize dual language immersion and world language programs around the state and highlight the great work being done to develop multilingual speakers. In recognition of the power of seeing in action standards-based teaching and learning in languages other than English and to provide ready access to clear and reliable practices in second language education, Model Programs serve as a regional resource for other districts in the state. More information can be found on the Model Programs website.\n\nTeacher Certification\n\nCan an elementary classroom teacher teach world language?\n\nElementary classroom teachers who teach world language less than one-half of their assignments must possess either a P–3 or K–6 license and demonstrate linguistic competence in the world language as demonstrated on a Department-approved, nationally recognized test of oral language proficiency for spoken language or receptive/expressive proficiency for American Sign Language.\n\nElementary classroom teachers who teach world language more than one-half of their assignment must demonstrate linguistic competence in the world language as demonstrated on a Department-approved, nationally recognized test of oral language proficiency for spoken language, reading/writing proficiency for classical languages or receptive/expressive proficiency for American Sign Language and complete a 3 semester-hour credits in second language acquisition theory and related methodologies offered by a nationally accredited college or university. (N.J.A.C. 6A: 9B: 10.5 and N.J.A.C. 6A: 9B-9.3)\n\nWhich world language methodology/language acquisition courses are approved for New Jersey certification?\n\nA list of approved world language methodology/language acquisition courses can be found on Certification’s Approved Certificate of Eligibility (CE) Program Providers website. If an educator does not see a course on the list that the educator is considering, please reach out to Certification customer service at (609) 292–2070 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nGraduation and Credits\n\nIs there a high school world language graduation requirement?\n\nYes. N.J.A.C.6a:8-5.1 requires that all students in New Jersey earn at least five credits in world languages. N.J.A.C.6a:8-5.1(a)2ii, also known as Individualized Student Learning Opportunities (ISLO), allows students to demonstrate that they have achieved Novice High proficiency as defined by ACTFL (ACTFL Proficiency Guidelines, page 15, 27, 37, and 48) to fulfill the world languages requirements of NJSLS-WL.\n\nHow can Multilingual Learners (MLs) earn the five-credit world languages requirement for graduation?\n\nAll students must meet or exceed the NJSLS for World Languages. Multilingual Learners can meet the five-credit world language requirements for graduation in the following ways:\n\nDemonstrate a Novice High proficiency in all modes of communication in their primary language on an approved assessment (J.A.C. 6A:8-5.1(a)2ii(2)).\n\nContinue to grow their proficiency in their primary language in a course that is appropriate for their primary language proficiency.\n\nAcquire a world language beyond their primary language.\n\nIn LIEPs where students are receiving a daily ESL class based on a student’s English language proficiency, this class may be used to fulfill the world languages graduation requirement if it integrates the NJSLS - world languages for their current grade level. If learning English for the first time in high school, the ESL class would have to integrate the Novice High NJSLS - world languages. If a multilingual learner has already begun learning English, the ESL class would have to integrate the NJSLS - world languages appropriate for their English proficiency level (ACTFL Intermediate Low proficiency or above)."
