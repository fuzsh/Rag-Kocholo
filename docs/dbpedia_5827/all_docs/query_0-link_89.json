AirPlay needs to be v4.0.\n\nI want to rent a film via an app but can’t, what’s going on?\n\nIf you can’t see a button to rent the film you’re looking for, it’s likely that it’s still going through the approval process of the relevant app store. This process normally take 24 - 48 hours, but in rare cases can take longer. If your film isn’t available to rent in the app, you can visit our website and rent it there. Once your rental is complete the film will appear automatically in the My Library section of your app.\n\nI can’t stream any of the content, what’s going on?\n\nCheck your minimum system requirements above. We recommend that you update to the latest version of your browser.\n\nWe use adaptive bitrate streaming which means the streaming quality will automatically adjust based on your internet speed. For High Definition (HD) streaming we recommend VDSL, cable or fibre connections as we cannot guarantee consistent HD streaming on ADSL.\n\nWhy isn’t playback working?\n\nWe’ve recently had to update our content security in line with our distributor anti-piracy requirements, and as a result, some browsers, devices and projectors will start facing some playback issues. It’s because these devices can be easily modified with piracy software, making films more vulnerable during playback. As a result, we have to put in some limitations on these devices. We’re very sorry if this changes your usual way of watching. Please see below for our full list of supported devices. If your internet connection is poor or inconsistent you may experience problems during playback.\n\nCan I enable subtitles or closed captions?\n\nEnglish subtitles come as standard for all non-English language films and also for any non-English speaking segments within a film. The subtitles are part of the film itself so they will show automatically, and for some films it is not possible to turn them off. It is stated on each film page if English subtitles are available. Closed Captions and Audio Description is available on some English language films or for the English speaking segments in foreign language films (more-often on our newer releases). Our delivery of access services is continuously growing and Curzon Home Cinema is fully in line with current Ofcom regulations.\n\nDo I need to be connected to the internet to watch a film on Curzon Home Cinema?\n\nA WiFi connection is required for streaming, or you can download to your phone and watch later. You won’t be able to stream over 3G/4G/5G.\n\nWhat does “too many devices” mean?\n\nAs part of our licensing restrictions, the number of devices that you can be logged in to at any one time is capped. To avoid any issues, please ensure you log out when sharing a computer or moving between devices. Make sure your browser is up to date (Microsoft Edge is preferred). You can manage your devices under ‘My Account’.
