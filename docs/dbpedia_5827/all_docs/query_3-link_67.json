        "text": "What Is Content-Based Language Instruction?\n\nContent-based ESL instruction is an integrated educational approach that puts content at the forefront of a given lesson plan. By teaching through content, learning English is not necessarily the focus of the lesson plan, but is acquired through the context of the content.\n\nHow Do You Use Content to Support the Language Needs of ELL?\n\nRegardless of level, content can be used to support the language needs of English language learners (ELL). Typically, ELL can be broken down into beginner, intermediate and advanced.\n\nBeginner-level language learners are developing basic interpersonal skills (BICS) and content to target this skill set can include learning grammar through easy puzzles, films and fun games.\n\nIntermediate and advanced learners are focusing on developing skills associated with Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP). This skill set focuses on more academic language and benefits language learners in their careers. Content is an important component of developing this proficiency, since it allows language learners to better contextualize information in the target language. Newspapers in particular can help with language learning since they feature high-quality writing and can cover a range of topic areas.\n\nWhat are the Instructional Materials Used in Teaching English language?\n\nThese days, there are plenty of teaching-learning materials available. Teachers can support ELL students by providing several content instructions and materials in the classroom that can be classified into three types: audio aids, visual aids and audio-visual aids. Here are some of the most common forms of content for English learning.\n\nWhat is the Best Way to Teach and Support English Language Learners?\n\nWhen it comes to teaching, the term “one size fits all” does not apply. Everybody learns and retains information differently. However, there are some best practices to consider:\n\nTeach in English:\n\nWhen beginning with language instruction, it’s important to conduct lessons in the target language. Even though it may be more convenient to switch back to your class’s native language, students benefit when the entire lesson is taught in the foreign language.\n\nUse Gestures and Speak Clearly:\n\nSpeak slowly and clearly, while using exaggerated gestures to ensure students comprehend the lesson. Using gestures as part of language learning has been shown to help students retain new vocabulary. Even though it may sound counterintuitive, even arbitrary gestures can be used to improve language skills, as long as the gesture isn’t already associated with a different word.\n\nUtilize Content to Support the Lesson:\n\nThis can include videos, multimedia, newspapers and books. Content exposes students to the culture, while giving them a sense of how native speakers sound or write.\n\nMake the Lesson Interactive:\n\nDemonstrate how the information is relevant to their lives, make it interactive and include visuals and hands-on activities.\n\nWhy is Learning English Important?\n\nEnglish is the number one most widely taught language in the world and more people have learned English as a second language than there are native English speakers. ELLs can be more successful if you teach the students in ways that don’t require them to speak much English, this allows them to learn from the other students and still advance in levels of proficiency. Communicative language teaching is now the most popular form of teaching worldwide. This form of teaching is geared towards placing students in several organic situations and conversations to learn how to communicate properly. A great way to implement this is through roleplay!\n\nWhat is Content-Based Instruction?\n\nContent-based instruction (CBI) is a teaching approach in which language skills are taught through content materials. The goal of CBI is to help learners develop both language and subject matter knowledge in a particular area. CBI often focuses more on academic skills, such as analyzing abstract concepts or communicating ideas.Language is taught through the use of complex subject matters with materials that are comprehensible for learners at their own individual levels.\n\nTo effectively integrate teaching language through content into the classroom, it's best if the content is diversified. Using visual support (graphics, images, videos), Integrated skills (reading books, news, writing) and even games can help aid in the learning process. When selecting content instruction materials for CBI lessons, it is imperative that the needs and interests play an important role. Students learn more effectively and retain more information when language and subject matter are intertwined in content-based learning.\n\nAn Example of Content-Based Language Instruction\n\nYour students are learning about different food or even sports. For a class activity, they can play the sport and use english to communicate through strategy and execution. Getting the students physically involved in ”real life” scenarios with motor movements helps encode new words into their vocabulary.\n\nSupporting ELLs in the Classroom\n\nDon’t play a guessing game! There has been proven research-based instruction that works effectively for most students. Of course, everybody learns differently so it is important to tweak your strategy and diversify your teaching approach.\n\nContent Strategies for Teachers to Support English Language Learners\n\nRelationships are everything! Cultivating trust and a safe environment in which students can feel comfortable with failing is the best way to start any strategy for learning. Establish a plan to support your goals by diligently picking out the best content that showcases culture, while helping your students improve their language skills.Here are a few strategies teachers should consider including in their programs.\n\nGive emphasis to academic language, literacy, and vocabulary.\n\nConnect the learning process to students' background knowledge and culture.\n\nBoost the amount of understandable input and language output.\n\nEncourage classroom participation and interaction.\n\nFoster the use of learning strategies and the development of higher-order thinking skills.\n\nBefore assessing the content needed, it’s important to assess your class’ abilities and struggles. Many times students are not on the same level when it comes to reading, writing, and speaking. Identifying the level in each designated area is the best way to develop an overall plan. Whatever materials are chosen, ensure they are fun and interactive! Learning a new language can be extremely intimidating, so it does not hurt to take the edge off whenever you can.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat Are Some Good Activities to Improve Students' English Fluency?\n\nThere are various activities that can help improve students' English fluency. Some examples include reading and listening to English content, practicing speaking with native or fluent speakers, participating in group discussions or debates, and writing regularly in English. Incorporating multimedia resources such as movies, TV shows, and podcasts can also be effective in improving students' language skills. Additionally, games and interactive activities that focus on vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation can be engaging and fun ways to enhance fluency.\n\nWhat are The Best Resources for Teachers to Use to Help Their ELL Students?\n\nTeachers can use several resources to support their ELL students, including bilingual and dual language programs, language learning apps and websites, vocabulary and grammar resources, multilingual materials, technology tools, and cultural competency training. These resources can help ELL students develop their English language skills and achieve academic success. Bilingual and dual language programs offer students the opportunity to learn in their native language while also receiving instruction in English. Language learning apps and websites can provide ELL students with practice and support for their language development. Multilingual materials and cultural competency training can help teachers create a more inclusive and supportive classroom environment for their ELL students.\n\nWhy are Resources Important for ELL Students?\n\nResources are crucial for ELL students because they can help support their language development and academic success. ELL students face unique challenges in the classroom, such as learning a new language while trying to keep up with academic content. Resources such as bilingual programs, language learning apps, and cultural competency training can provide ELL students with the support they need to overcome these challenges. By using these resources, teachers can help ELL students develop their language skills, build confidence, and achieve academic success."
