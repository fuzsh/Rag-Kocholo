Watched Solo and it synced perfectly, never buffered or stopped. I was worried that I wouldnât hear over the loud movie sound but I did- in fact I couldnât hear the English version in background and thereâs no need to, as the audio track contains everything, not just dialogue. I was worried other ppl would be able to hear the sound from my earphones, but that didnât happen either. I took off my earphones a couple of times at different volumes to check and nothing. I was also pleased to hear LA Spanish as opposed to the Spain accent I had heard previously in a video advertising this app (nothing wrong with it, my accent just happens to be LA) anyway. Iâm looking forward to more movie and language options! As a polyglot, Iâd definitely appreciate the fun option to hear my favorite movies in different languages! Great job so far :)\n\nActually one question: why do we need to âdownload the trackâ every time? Canât we just do it once and then unlock it by choosing the movie showtime or something? I kept changing plans and while at home it downloaded in seconds, when I did it at the theater before the movie it took around 10mins. Not a deal breaker because I was early just something that could be better."
