        "text": "Do not stop taking apixaban unless directed by your doctor. If you stop taking this medication early, you have a higher risk of forming a serious blood clot (such as a stroke, blood clot in the legs/lungs). Your doctor may direct you to take a different \"blood thinning\" or antiplatelet medication to reduce your risk. Get medical help right away if you have weakness on one side of the body, trouble speaking, sudden vision changes, confusion, chest pain, trouble breathing, or pain/warmth/swelling in the legs.\n\nPeople taking this medication may bleed near the spinal cord after certain spinal procedures. Bleeding in this area can cause paralysis that lasts a long time or could become permanent. Before any spinal procedure, ask your doctor about the benefits and risks. The risk of bleeding may be higher if you have a deformed spine, or have had spinal procedures/surgery before (such as epidural catheter placement, difficult epidural/spinal puncture), or are taking other drugs that can cause bleeding/bruising (including antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, \"blood thinners\" such as warfarin/enoxaparin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-NSAIDs such as ibuprofen). Tell your doctor right away if you notice symptoms such as back pain, leg numbness/tingling/weakness, loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence).\n\nBefore taking apixaban, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or if you have any other allergies. This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\nBefore using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: liver disease, kidney disease, bleeding problems (such as bleeding of the stomach/intestines, bleeding in the brain), blood disorders (such as anemia, hemophilia, thrombocytopenia), recent major injury/surgery, stroke, a certain clotting disorder (antiphospholipid syndrome), frequent falls/injuries.\n\nBefore having surgery or any medical/dental procedures (especially spinal puncture or spinal/epidural anesthesia), tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking this medication and about all the products you use (including prescription drugs, nonprescription drugs, and herbal products). Your doctor or dentist may tell you to stop taking apixaban before your surgery. Ask for specific instructions about stopping or starting this medication.\n\nThis medication may cause stomach bleeding. Daily use of alcohol while using this medicine will increase your risk for stomach bleeding. Limit alcoholic beverages. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about how much alcohol you may safely drink.\n\nThis medication can cause heavy bleeding. To lower the chance of getting cut, bruised, or injured, use caution with sharp objects like razors and nail cutters, and avoid activities such as contact sports. Use an electric razor when shaving and a soft toothbrush when brushing your teeth. If you fall or injure yourself, especially if you hit your head, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may need to check you.\n\nDuring pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor.\n\nIt is unknown if this medication passes into breast milk. Because of the possible risk to the infant, breastfeeding is not recommended while using this medication. Consult your doctor before breastfeeding."
