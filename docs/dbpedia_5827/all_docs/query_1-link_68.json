Brent Mason is a hard working cop helping to support his family and Hayden hails from a rich family and plans charity parties. This is an opposites attract, enemies to lovers, almost forced proximity romance. Brent is absolutely what made this book. He is a hard working, honest, devoted, dirty talking man in uniform, need I say more?!?!\n\nI have 1 more book to finish this series, but don't own it yet and am working on my current TBR list for the rest of this year, so I will have to finish this series later.\n\nHate-flirting makes up for the TSTL rich girl plot\n\n‚ÄúHe kicked his caveman in the nuts and focused on her.‚Äù\n\nYay for cavemen who talk as hard as they- ‚Ä¶ And whoo! The chemistry as Brent and Hayden hate-flirt is only topped by the chemistry when they hate- ‚Ä¶ Yeah, this author‚Äôs books are dirty, so if you prefer your romances closer to cozy than crass, this book is not for you. Her books are risky for me, as the odds are 50-50 whether I‚Äôm on board for the dirty or whether the crass crosses my lines. But, this particular series worked for me and this book was a favorite.\n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sock guy?!‚Äù\n\nThe comedy is strong in this one, especially with the previous couple joining in for a lot of four-way ball busting. You don‚Äôt need to have heard 1 or 2, but I recommend listening to book 3 (Officer Off Limits) before starting this one.\n\n‚ÄúDid you tell her about the leg thing?‚Äù\n\nThe one thing that chapped my undies was the forced marriage plot for rich girl Hayden. The whole needing to marry for money schtick only works in regency romance. Hayden‚Äôs got a brain and backbone yet uses neither. There are multiple points where conflict could have been resolved with simple conversation. She‚Äôs also got her own trust fund, yet that money source is ignored in service to building the Big Scene. Yes, yes, the Big Scene was funny and heartfelt. It was just one too many cliche pills to swallow to get there ‚Ä¶ or maybe a dozen cliche pills. Rich people‚Äôs problems are so not my jam.\n\nThank goodness for working man Brent, the sexiest cop with the dirtiest mouth. His being a cop barely signifies, but that‚Äôs okay, because the cuffs are put to much better use when he‚Äôs off the clock.\n\nJersey Shore\n\nEnjoyed the story, though the main thread through out was a young woman trying to connect with her mother by making life decisions that would please the bitter woman, which was a bit annoying.\n\nMy main problem was with the narrator. It might be that a Jersey accent is common, but he sounded like an actor using an exaggerated accent to audition for Jersey Shore. I considered returning, but gritted my teeth and was able to finish.\n\nGraphic sex scenes, not suitable for young readers."
