        "text": "No matter how we discover them, the best films move us in ways we've never imagined. No matter how old we are, they can make us both laugh and cry, and they help us learn more about ourselves and how we relate to others. Of course, many popular movies deal with social and emotional issues, and these can be great for teaching SEL in our classrooms.\n\nThe films on this list are excellent for encouraging students to reflect on and discuss a wide range of social and emotional issues. As teachers, we're in a unique position to give these films the context they demand. Social and emotional learning doesn't usually come from watching a movie by yourself -- it comes from the rich discussions that form when you're watching a movie with others and relating what happens in the film to real life. Because of this, it's crucial that we don't merely show these films without also giving kids time to reflect on and discuss what they're watching. As students watch, help them interpret the films you show, and give them direct invitations to ask questions and think critically about what they're seeing on the screen.\n\nNote that our list includes some films that address complex and mature themes. One of the benefits of kids seeing these films in school, versus on their own, is that teachers can help guide and facilitate conversations about these issues. However -- as with any movie you select for your classroom -- determine ahead of time what's OK for your students and the community where you teach, and always follow your school or district's policies around showing films in the classroom.\n\nHere are some excellent movies for the middle school classroom that support students' social and emotional learning:\n\nImage\n\nInside Out\n\nSelf-Control, Teamwork, Empathy, Integrity\n\nA modern animated classic about emotions, Inside Out will help kids understand the power of our feelings and why it's important to express them -- whether it's happiness, fear, or regret. And check out our free movie guide!\n\nDiscussion questions:\n\nWhy are all emotions important?\n\nWhat are some ways to regulate emotions?\n\nTalk about the value in being honest about feelings.\n\nImage\n\nScience Fair\n\nCommunication, Curiosity, Perseverance, Teamwork\n\nFollowing different student groups competing in an international science fair, this documentary highlights the perseverance and teamwork required to make it to the top. Help students analyze the variety of personality types they'll see in the film -- from shy to self-possessed and beyond -- and how they help or hurt the contestants' goals.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhy is being curious so important?\n\nHow can setting goals be helpful?\n\nDiscuss the struggles some of the students had to work through to get where they are.\n\nImage\n\nFar from the Tree\n\nCommunication, Compassion, Empathy\n\nThis moving documentary is about parents learning how to raise kids who are unlike themselves -- whether they have a disability, identify as LGBTQ+, or have committed a crime. Students will see how these parents grapple with empathy and develop tolerance and then consider how their own families handle their unique characteristics.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat are strategies to connect and communicate about differences?\n\nWhy is empathy an important part of relationships?\n\nTalk about differences between family relationships versus other types.\n\nImage\n\nRBG\n\nIntegrity\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg headlines this documentary about her life and career. Politics aside, students can see how Ginsburg maintained integrity in her private trials and public fights for gender equality.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat does it mean to have integrity? What does it look like in daily choices?\n\nHow can compassion for others fuel the fight for equality?\n\nDiscuss strategies to use when others are working against efforts you believe in.\n\nImage\n\nWonder\n\nEmpathy, Perseverance\n\nKids will get emotional as they watch this story of a fifth-grader born with a facial abnormality. Bullying is a strong focus in the film, and students can talk about why it's important to try to understand what their peers are going through and when to stand up for others.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhy is it that some people choose to pick on those who are different from them? Why choose cruelty over compassion? And what does the movie tell us about people's motivations for their behavior?\n\nWhat effect does each character's circumstances have on your compassion for them?\n\nTalk about some of the strategies that characters use to face their struggles.\n\nImage\n\nWon't You Be My Neighbor\n\nCompassion, Integrity\n\nThis highly acclaimed biopic of Fred Rogers' life showcases his passion for inspiring integrity and kindness. Whether or not they know who he is, students can argue whether the show's discussion of tough topics with young kids had a positive or negative impact on kids' social and emotional learning.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nHow is Fred Rogers a good example of a person who has integrity?\n\nIn what ways did he show compassion?\n\nDiscuss the importance of the kind of acceptance Mr. Rogers showed toward everyone. How can we do the same?\n\nImage\n\nArrival\n\nCommunication, Compassion, Curiosity\n\nCommunication is front and center in this sci-fi alien tale. Faced with important choices around compassion, the characters make decisions that will get students debating the consequences of how we talk to, and learn to work with, each other.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhy is it that some of the characters feel threatened and talk about war?\n\nWhat does the main character do to help avoid violence?\n\nTalk about the power of curiosity, especially when we feel afraid.\n\nImage\n\nLiyana\n\nCourage, Empathy, Perseverance\n\nA unique mix of live-action documentary and animation, Liyana tells the emotional story of a group of African orphans and the fictional tale they created. The tale is based on their own experiences, which can be emotional and will open up students to new perspectives.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nHow is storytelling one way to process difficult circumstances?\n\nHow does it work in this movie? What would you say to the kids in the movie if you had the chance?\n\nDiscuss some of the skills that help people through the hardest times. How do we build those skills?\n\nImage\n\nBlack Panther\n\nCourage, Integrity, Teamwork\n\nThis popular Marvel superhero movie is a great opportunity to take a film that kids already love and show them how their favorite characters handle integrity, decisiveness, and teamwork. You can also discuss the effect the film has had in African American communities and why it has produced such gratitude and pride.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nWhat are some different ways that hardship, anger, and isolation affect people? What are potential positive outcomes?\n\nWhat are some examples of teamwork seen in this film? How does each example illustrate teamwork?\n\nTalk about the rulers of Wakanda (or those who want to rule). Who has the most integrity? Why do you think so?\n\nImage\n\nEighth Grade\n\nCommunication, Courage\n\nThis R-rated film is certainly the most controversial pick on this list; the director has hosted special screenings of Eighth Grade in schools across the country. Discuss as a class whether the characters and issues surfaced in the film are true to real life, and talk about how students might deal (or have dealt) with these types of experiences. For more information about showing the movie Eighth Grade in your classroom, be sure to check out this article, as well as our discussion guide for schools.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nEven though the main character is quiet at school, what are some ways she shows courage?\n\nWhat does it mean to \"find your voice\"?

Why or why not?\n\nStray\n\nCompassion,Empathy\n\nThe lives of three stray dogs living in Istanbul, Turkey, intertwine with young refugees from Syria who are living on the streets. Because, from the dogs' perspective, politics and nationality don't matter, students can consider what the movie is saying about what truly matters.\n\nDiscussion Questions:\n\nHow does using the dogs as central figures really highlight compassion and empathy?\n\nIf the people in the film showed more compassion to each other, how might that change their lives?\n\nTalk about how it sometimes feels easier to be compassionate with nonhuman animals than other people.
