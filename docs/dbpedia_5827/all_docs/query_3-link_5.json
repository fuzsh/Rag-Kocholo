        "text": "Looking for linguistics and language-related films to watch? Mary Ann Walter, a linguist who runs a linguistics film series at Middle East Technical University, Northern Cyprus, has kindly forwarded her very extensive list of linguistically-relevant movies, documentaries, and episodes of TV shows, and given me permission to post it.\n\nI have only watched some of these movies and have only very lightly edited Mary Ann’s notes, so I cannot vouch for all of them, but I hope this list is helpful to people! If you know of any linguistically-relevant films that we’ve somehow missed, do add them in the comments. Asterisks indicate ones that are available on youtube.\n\nSci-fi/speculative\n\nArrival, 2016\n\nStar Trek Darmok episode, 1991.\n\nPontypool. 2008. Horror. In a Canadian town, the English language somehow gets infected and makes them zombies.\n\nThe Falls. 1980. Mock documentary about something which killed many and left others with strange symptoms, including suddenly speaking new languages.\n\n*Het Dak van de Walvis (On Top of the Whale) 1982 Raoul Ruiz. Parody of much of western academia. A group of field linguists set out to study an exotic language which consists only of one single word, which therefore means everything. Very strange, not a crowdpleaser.\n\nBeing John Malkovich. Also features a single word language.\n\nEnglish/Regional\n\n*Do you speak American (3 episodes, each 1 hour).\n\n*Talking Canadian (43 minutes). Difference between Canadian and US English.\n\nRoad Scholar (1993) directed by Roger Weisberg.

For Scottish English.\n\nRiff Raff (1991) directed by Ken Loach. UK. This film about a group of construction workers features working class dialects.
