To learn more or get help, contact your antivirus software provider.\n\nUsing a computer or mobile device on the same network as the device with the issue, open a web browser.\n\nGo to fast.com. Netflix will start a connection test.\n\nWhen the test stops, click Show more info.\n\nNext to Client, note the country.\n\nIf the country doesn't match your location, it means your device or network has a VPN turned on. Try turning it off, then try Netflix again. For help turning a VPN off, contact your VPN provider.\n\nNetflix Customer Service can't help with turning a VPN off because the steps are different for each VPN app or service.\n\nIf turning your VPN off didn't work, or the location from fast.com matches your location, go to the next steps.\n\nYou can't use a VPN while watching Netflix if you have an ad-supported plan.\n\nGo to your Account page to check your current plan.\n\nIf you have an ad-supported plan:\n\nYou'll need to change to an ad-free plan to use a VPN while watching Netflix.\n\nIf you want to stay on your current plan, you'll need to turn your VPN off while watching Netflix.\n\nIf you don't have an ad-supported plan or want to check if a VPN is turned on, go to the next steps."
