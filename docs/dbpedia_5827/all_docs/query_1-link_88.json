        "text": "From 7 Aug 2024\n\nProtests countering anti-immigration action spread across country\n\nAcross the country, hundreds of people have gathered to counter the more than 100 far-right rallies planned at immigration centres, lawyers’ offices and charities.\n\nHuge numbers have shown up in Bristol following a clash over the weekend between anti-immigration protesters, counter-protesters and police.\n\nIn Liverpool, hundreds formed a human shield around a church targeted for its immigration advice centre. About 200 counter-protesters gathered in Birmingham, chanting “Fascist scum out of Brum”.\n\nIn Brighton, the few anti-immigration protesters gathered outside a law office were so outnumbered by counter-protesters that the police there surrounded the anti-immigration protesters for their protection. With the exception of a small scuffle that broke out earlier on Queens Road, the counter-protest had the atmosphere of a street carnival, with a samba band playing and people loudly singing.\n\nMeanwhile, in Walthamstow in east London, crowds of anti-racist protesters amassed in the streets, holding signs reading “EDL (English Defence League) Not Welcome in Walthamstow” and “No Room for Racism”.\n\nWhile there have been a few sightings of the right-wing agitators promised, overall they have been far outnumbered by the anti-racist community members.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 21.29 CEST\n\nKey events\n\nShow key events only\n\nPlease turn on JavaScript to use this feature\n\nClosing summary\n\nThe more than 100 far-right gatherings that were expected to take place on Wednesday failed to materialise following the mobilisation of 6,000 riot officers and the deterrent effect of the swift arrests and court appearances of those accused of participating in the weekend’s violence. What few small, far right-led gatherings there were took place only in Durham, Blackpool, Norwich, Northampton, Sheffield and Brighton. Police were previously preparing for far-right action all over the country after a list of targets connected to asylum and immigration was circulated on social media.\n\nInstead, thousands of anti-racism protesters held their own counter rallies, everywhere from Newcastle to Bristol to Birmingham, London and Brighton. They formed human shields to protect asylum centres, and waved placards saying “refugees welcome” and “reject racism, try therapy”. While there were some reports of tensions flaring – some skirmishes in Blackpool and a clash in Aldershot in Hampshire between a group chanting “stop the boats” and demonstrators who had been chanting “refugees are welcome here” – Wednesday’s rallies were a far cry from the violence, looting and destruction that led many businesses across the country to close up early and board up their shops in recent days.\n\nPolice made a number of arrests around the country, many of them stemming from online activity. In Carlisle, three men were arrested in connection with posting online hate-related content or encouraging public disorder and violence against police officers. West Midlands police arrested a man on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and possession of a firearm following several social media posts regarding protests in Birmingham earlier this week that involved a man holding a firearm.\n\nThe messaging app Telegram said it will be “removing channels and posts containing calls to violence” in the UK. The app, which gained prominence in far-right circles as one of the last places that the EDL founder, Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (better known as Tommy Robinson) was allowed to post, has become a go-to app for the far-right.\n\nLindsay Hoyle, the Commons speaker, wrote to MPs suggesting they review their security in the wake of the threat of further riots – and that some might want to consider working from home. His letter said those with “prominent and easily identifiable office locations may wish to consider their office security protocols”.\n\nLondon mayor Sadiq Khan called on people in the city to “check on their friends and neighbours and show them that care and compassion is what Londoners are all about”, adding that he was in constant touch with the police amid reports of several areas in London being potential targets of far-right attacks. Deputy prime minister Angela Rayner amplified his message, saying “Mayors across the country are bringing people together in unity to condemn hatred, violence and vandalism”.\n\nConservative shadow policing minister Matt Vickers, and Conservative leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick both made criticisms of Keir Starmer, with Jenrick saying the prime minister “has made a mistake in that he has not shown equal treatment to all forms of violence perpetrated by whoever it is, wherever it is in the country”. Jenrick also said he does not regret previously accusing police in England and Wales of adopting “two-tier policing” earlier this year, nor does he regret saying in parliament in February of this year that “we have allowed our streets to be dominated by Islamist extremists” – rhetoric that many terrorism experts believe has contributed to the recent violence.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.55 CEST\n\nAerial footage over London captured the breadth of the anti-racist counter protests that took place around the city. Take a look here:\n\nShare\n\nPolice arrest six in Carlisle operation\n\nPolice have arrested six people in connection with a dispersal order put in place for Carlisle city centre and the surrounding areas after it was listed as one of the locations for planned far-right disorder, Cumbria police said.\n\nThree men were arrested in connection to their online activity, and remain in custody:\n\nA 41-year-old man from Carlisle was arrested in connection with the alleged posting online of content encouraging violence against police officers and promoting public disorder.\n\nA 40-year-old man from Carlisle was arrested in connection with the alleged posting of hate-related content online.\n\nA 31-year-old man from Maryport was also arrested in connection with the alleged posting of hate-related content online.\n\nOfficers conducting increased enforcement in the area went on to arrest an 18-year-old man from Carlisle on suspicion of possession of cannabis, and a 33-year-old man from Sunderland on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. They remain in custody.\n\nPolice also arrested a 16-year-old boy from Penrith on suspicion of breach of a dispersal order.\n\n“Our officers have been out across Carlisle today to keep our communities safe from potential planned disorder,” said chief superintendent Carl Patrick. “Our proactive actions and the support of our communities have resulted in no significant disorder taking place.\n\nHe continued: “We took positive action into reports of online activity which attempted to incite violence and hatred. This sends a very clear message that we will not hesitate to act against those who post such content online.\n\n“Criminality of any kind will not be tolerated in our county, and we will do all we can to ensure offenders are brought to justice. We are not complacent and will continue to carry out this proactive policing approach.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.35 CEST\n\nWhere were the far right rallies tonight?\n\nVikram Dodd\n\nA police source with knowledge of the national picture said there were believed to have been small, far right-led gatherings in Durham, Blackpool, Norwich, Northampton, Sheffield and Brighton.\n\nThe source said police were confident in their intelligence and felt justified in standing up 6,000 riot officers.\n\nOne reason for the apparent far right no show, the source said, was the deterrent effect of swift arrests and court appearances that gathered pace after the violence at the weekend, causing widespread shock.\n\nEarlier Nick Lowles, an expert on the British far right, who now leads Hope Not Hate, told the Guardian that he was sceptical there would be widespread trouble on Wednesday evening.\n\nThe expectation was triggered by a list of targets found on social media. Lowles, speaking before this evening, said: “I think it’s a hoax, designed to spread fear and panic. Which of course it has done.\n\n“I have no doubt that some people will turn up at some of these places, especially in areas where demographics are similar to where previous trouble has been. But other areas will be very quiet.\n\n“The list has been compiled by one man in Liverpool, who simply googled immigration law firms etc. No-one is organising the local protests and there is very, very little chatter about it on the forums and WhatsApp groups that have been key over the past week. It’s had more circulation from the left community groups than the far right .”\n\nPolice expect the next couple of days to be relatively quiet and more so-called protests are expected this weekend.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.56 CEST\n\nPolice arrest man following social media posts\n\nA 49-year-old man was arrested by West Midlands police tonight following an investigation into several social media posts regarding protests in Birmingham earlier this week.\n\nThe man, who police did not name, was arrested on suspicion of inciting racial hatred and possession of a firearm after police delved into a number of posts on various social media platforms of a man holding a firearm. He remains in custody.\n\n“We will not tolerate violence in our towns and cities, or tolerate those who use social media to encourage such violence,” West Midlands police said.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.57 CEST\n\nPolice arrest one person in Bristol\n\nPolice have arrested one person in Bristol for allegedly throwing a brick at a police vehicle, and a bottle.\n\n“We’ve facilitated a largely peaceful protest but we won’t tolerate acts of criminality,” said Avon and Somerset police.\n\nAuthorities estimated that more than 1,000 people had gathered on West Street in Bristol’s Old Market, while organisers from the Stand Up To Racism group estimated there were more than 2,000 people. While the atmosphere was initially tense with rumours of far-right attacks and a man apparently filming for an extreme right-wing YouTube channel, the overall mood was relatively calm after the threats of a far-right presence receded.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.58 CEST\n\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) chief has told the Muslim community that police officers will be “standing in harm’s way” to ensure they are safe after several race-related attacks in Belfast.\n\nIn a YouTube video message addressed to Muslims in Northern Ireland, Jon Boutcher said that every PSNI officer “is here to look after you, we’re here to protect you”.\n\nHe said the community had been targeted by “thugs and criminals” in recent days who are from a right-wing ideology “that makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever”.\n\nBoutcher said a meeting was held between all leaders of mosques across Northern Ireland in Belfast on Tuesday night.\n\nHe said: “It’s clear to me you are living in fear … and I want to assure you: we will deal with it.”\n\nBoutcher said that the community team would be in touch and officers would visit mosques.\n\nHe added: “I want to assure you we will be policing those events very much with a focus on the security and the safety of our Muslim communities.\n\n“We will be standing in harm’s way, which is what my officers have done so far on a number of evenings, to make sure you’re safe…. we stand with you and we support you.”\n\nPolice are investigating race-related hate crimes and disorder across Belfast on Tuesday, following other disorder and violence in the city in the past week.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 00.00 CEST\n\nPolice in Northampton are asking counter-protesters to leave after planned anti-immigration protests in the town failed to materialise.\n\nNorthants Police said on social media: “One hour since planned protest was due to start and there has been no disorder tonight.\n\n“Police are now asking the crowd of counter-protesters to disperse peacefully for the evening.\n\n“Kettering Road still partially closed for now.”\n\nShare\n\nPolice have arrested eight people in Croydon on suspicion of assaulting emergency workers, possession of offensive weapons and other offences.\n\nMore arrests will follow, the force said, adding that the disruption is “not linked to protest” and that it appears to be “pure antisocial behaviour”.\n\nShare\n\nJosh Halliday\n\nHundreds of anti-racism protesters have left the church in Liverpool that appeared on a far-right hitlist this week - and the organisers are declaring victory after no sign of any rightwing activists.\n\n“I’ve got photographs from Brighton and Walthamstow and the crowds are bigger than ours!” says Father Peter Morgan, the priest of Liverpool’s St Anne’s church. “It’s the same story throughout the country. The racists are overcome - and we hope for ever.”\n\nTwo police helicopters remain overhead as the crowd thins out. A police officer says he is “not saying it’s over” until everyone is home safe.\n\nAdam Kelwick, the imam of a nearby mosque, said he had told a group of young men to put down their weapons and leave their balaclavas at home after rumours spread on Whatsapp that far-right activists were planning an attack.\n\nKelwick, who became a local celebrity after offering burgers to rightwing activists outside a mosque in Liverpool on Saturday, encouraged the crowd to invite “the most racist, Islamophobic” people they know to his mosque so he could reason with them.\n\nThis post was amended on 8 August 2024; Father Peter Morgan is priest at St Anne’s Church, not “St Mary’s”.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 18.03 CEST\n\nThe anti-racism protesters gathering across England have been captured by photographers.\n\nMany are holding uplifting placards such as ‘good vibes only’ and ‘love and unity’.\n\nOne lady with purple hair is pictured sitting on a chair in Bristol, holding a sign that says: ‘Grannies against fascism’.\n\nIn Newcastle upon Tyne, a man holds a sign proclaiming ‘Refugees welcome in the toon’.\n\nIn Birmingham, a protester holds up a cardboard sign with the words ‘fascist scum out of Brum’ emblazoned on it.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 23.08 CEST\n\nTom Wall\n\nThousands of anti-racist protesters have filled the street outside a Bristol immigration law firm named in a hitlist circulated on a far-right Telegram channel this week.\n\nOne of the organisers from Stand up to Racism group estimated there were over 2,000 people, with every section of the city represented.\n\nThe atmosphere was initially tense with groups darting off as rumours of far right attacks swirled.\n\nA man was spotted apparently filming for extreme right wing YouTube channel and escorted away.\n\nBut the mood is now relatively calm as the threat appears to have receded. People are chatting and listening to music, with the occasional anti fascist chant ringing out in the warm summer night.\n\nShare\n\nRobyn Vinter\n\nIn Sheffield, near the children’s hospital, a large gathering of anti racist protesters is slowly leaving.\n\n“We made a sign for nothing!” said one of the protesters, Claire, holding a pink glittery placard emblazoned with the words “Hate never wins”.\n\n“They didn’t bother coming. Very disappointing,” her friend added.\n\n“Someone said maybe it was a false flag thing but at least now they know we won’t stand for any of their shit. We’ll be here every time. They’ve seen how many people turn out on a Wednesday night with better things to do and work in the morning.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.30 CEST\n\nBibi van der Zee\n\nThe problem that police in Brighton are facing is that while the tiny group of anti-immigation protesters remains in place, surrounded by a protective cordon of officers, the gigantic counter protest – probably about 1500 strong – won’t leave either, although some are slowly drifting away.\n\nOne policeman says they can’t compel the anti-immigation protesters to leave, “they have a right to peacefully protest too”.\n\nAnother points out that escorting them out may also be problematic. It is not clear whether the group is staying put of their own volition. But the longer everyone stays, as darkness falls, the more possible it becomes that the mood will change.\n\nShare\n\nBottles have been thrown at police and objects dragged down the road after about 50 people gathered in Croydon, police said.\n\nThe Metropolitan police said the disruption is “not linked to protest” and that it appears to be “pure antisocial behaviour”.\n\nIn a post on social media, the force said: “Approximately 50 people have gathered in North End Road, Croydon.\n\n“They’ve made clear their intention is to cause disruption and fuel disorder.\n\n“They’ve dragged and thrown objects down the road, and thrown bottles at officers.\n\n“This is not linked to protest, this appears to be pure antisocial behaviour. Officers are moving in numbers to make arrests.”\n\nShare\n\nIn Brighton, a PA news reporter saw counter-protesters part from the crowd and chant at a small group of people: “whose streets? Our streets!”\n\nA kebab shop and noodle bar were among those boarded up along the road where protests were expected to take place.\n\nPolice appeared to escort a few men towards the train station as counter-protesters followed them chanting.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.26 CEST\n\nJessica Murray\n\nRoads in Birmingham have been brought to a standstill as hundreds of counter-protesters marched from a refugee centre in the Jewellery Quarter into the city centre.\n\nCars honked their horns in solidarity with the crowd as they made their way towards Victoria Square, after protesting outside a refugee and migrant centre for nearly two hours.\n\nThe people who gathered to protect the refugee centre in Birmingham – up to about 500 people – are a diverse group, with a broad mix of races and ages.\n\n“As a British-born Pakistani, who is Muslim and queer, I wanted to come out and be part of the message that the most diverse city in the UK is united. If we can get it right, the rest of the UK can get it right,” said Saima Razzaq.\n\n“Now we need politicians to lead by example and call out the racism and Islamophobia that we are seeing.\n\n“Birmingham is a great multicultural city, we get on together, do things together in harmony,” said Ceinwen Hilton, 66.\n\n“The fascists want to destroy that. What we’ve seen the past few days is really frightening and shocking. But there are millions of people who don’t agree with that. So we need to come out and say we’re against it.”\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 22.17 CEST"
