One of the BEST Spanish movies out there for authentic culture and a great story.

Even better, it explores cultural tensions and life in a predominantly Latino and agricultural community.\n\nThemes: Hispanics in the US, immigration, sports, teens, heartwarming.\n\nAtlético San Pancho (NR, 1h 41min)\n\nA rag-tag soccer team in Mexico get help from the school janitor to reach their dream of playing a championship game.

In the midst of the preparations, she discovers her family is undocumented. It’s made-for-TV and dated, but I’ve found that students have a love-hate relationship with the 90s-riffic style and are very connected to the immigration themes in light of today’s political climate.\n\nThemes: Immigration, family, coming-of-age, identity.\n\nCinco días para bailar (NR, 1h 19min)\n\nThis semi-documentary follows a group of high schoolers who have five days to set up a dance show, and must work together.\n\nThemes: Music, dance, identity, heartwarming, Spain.\n\nValentín (PG-13, 1h 26 min)\n\nIn 1967 Argentina, an 8-year-old boy lives with his grandmother and dreams of being part of NASA one day.

You will probably want to research the history behind this story, and be prepared to discuss, as there was an investigation into alleged cheating and some contend that the film distorts the facts.\n\nThemes: School, urban issues, inspirational.\n\n3 Bellezas (R, 1h 37min)\n\nIn Venezuela (which has more international Beauty Pageant wins than any other country), a mother becomes obsessed with her daughter becoming the next big beauty queen. It’s gritty and covers difficult issues with some comic twists, but is ultimately a hard-hitting look at the Beauty Pageant industry and complex.\n\nThemes: Venezuela, beauty, identity, feminism.\n\nTambién la lluvia (NR, 1h 43min)\n\nA director from Spain is creating film about Christopher Columbus and his treatment of indigenous people, and selects Bolivia for the location in order to cut costs. All goes well until they try to privative a nearby water supply, and the local people erupt in protest.\n\nThemes: justice, enviroment, history, Bolivia.\n\nThe Mission (PG, 2h 5min)\n\nA Spanish priest tries to establish a Catholic mission in South America\n\nin the 18th century and is joined by a former slave trader.

Six years later, the birth mother shows up and wants her daughter back.
