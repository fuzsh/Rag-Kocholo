        "text": "Cast/Acting credits guidelines\n\nUpdated 21-December-2022\n\nThis article provides guidance into our eligibility and formatting policies for submitting or modifying Cast/Acting filmography credits on the website -- if you're looking to add credits to the website, please see our Adding Filmography credits support article.\n\nDue to the wide variety of different roles someone can perform in this category, this article is quite broad - please use the links below to help navigate the page.\n\nGetting started\n\nFor clarity, our definition of \"Cast\" includes both scripted and unscripted roles, these include:\n\nActors / Actresses (including voice work)\n\nHosts or Guests\n\nNarrators\n\nAthletes\n\nSelf appearances\n\nOr other people not \"acting\" in the traditional sense\n\nIf the person is in-front of the camera or providing their voice, then they are considered Cast and this article should provide an idea on how to credits should be listed on the website.\n\nPlease use the quick links below to learn more:\n\nGeneral guidelines\n\nEligibility\n\nThe roles we accept\n\nAttributes\n\nSupplementary credit info\n\nOn-screen credits\n\nCredited vs Uncredited\n\nRole-specific guidelines\n\nVoice\n\nFor voice performances\n\nArchive footage\n\nFootage used from other title\n\nMotion capture\n\nFor mo-cap performances\n\nSelf role\n\nNon-scripted & playing self\n\nCharacter naming\n\nEpisodic rules\n\nListing episodic characters\n\nPunctuation\n\nHow to include punctuation\n\nSuperhero\n\nHow to list superheroes\n\nGroup names\n\nHow to list groups (e.g. bands)\n\nLanguage\n\nWhich language to use\n\nSpoilers\n\nWhat to exclude\n\nDescriptions\n\nAdditional character info\n\nGuidelines\n\nGeneral eligibility for inclusion\n\nWe accept almost all types of acting credits you might find on a production.\n\nIn most cases, these can simply be added using the contribution interface — however there are a few instances where credits are not eligible and shouldn't be submitted.\n\nBelow you'll find some more specific eligibility rules.\n\nAnimals and inanimate objects (e.g, Wilson the Volleyball)\n\nThese can be listed as actors if they appear in the credits as cast members. After the new name page is created, you should probably also include a biographical trivia note (e.g. \"Is a dog\").\n\nA 'character' such as a puppet or other performing non-living entity listed in the credits should be listed under the name of the person performing it in most cases. Name pages/filmography for inanimate objects are allowed only in cases of wide global recognition.\n\nExceptions: Corpses, paintings, mummies, etc., should not be listed as cast members in any title.\n\nPeople who appear only in still photographs\n\nThese can be included in filmography based on these guidelines:\n\nThe content was created specifically for the title, and they do receive an on-screen credit: they should be credited as reflected on screen with the addition of a (credit only) attribute.\n\nIf they are not featured in the end credits: they should instead be submitted as Photographic Model in Additional crew with the addition of an (uncredited) attribute.\n\nIf the content is not explicitly created for the title, and they are credited: they should be listed with a (credit only) attribute.\n\nIf they are not credited: they are not eligible for listing as a filmography item, but can be submitted as “Bio: Other Works” or “Title: Trivia” (as long as it adheres to our Trivia policies).\n\nAppearing in footage from a different title\n\nIf someone appears in footage from a different title that is already listed in the database (or that should be listed), they should not have an additional cast credit added. The footage should instead be noted as a movie link.\n\nTitle is later re-released as an episode\n\nIf a title is later shown as an episode of a series, then it should be added as a shell episode.\n\nThis means the episode can be added to a series, but no filmography credits relating to the original title should be added to the shell to avoid crediting the work twice on the name pages of those involved.\n\nIf the individual contributed to new material relating solely to that episode e.g. hosting segment then they are valid credits and may be added to the shell episode). Please also add a trivia item and a movie connection linking the episode to the original title page.\n\nCast Attributes\n\nContains - what is an attribute | valid attributes | invalid attributes\n\nWhat is an attribute?\n\nAn attribute is a snippet of explanatory information signifying the status of a credit - Cast attributes are entered into the 'attribute' field during the submission process:\n\nAttributes aren't usually required - but in rare cases, they may be needed before a new credit can be approved.\n\nA list of the existing attributes can be seen by clicking the icon next to the attribute field.\n\nValid attributes\n\n(uncredited) - No on-screen credit. For acting credits, this must include a character name or some kind of description. (more info)\n\n(credit only) - Someone is credited, but didn't actually appear in the title. Common in episodic shows where regular performers sometimes don't appear in an episode but retain a screen credit. This includes news/talk/entertainment series with a person’s name in the title (e.g. Tucker Carlson Tonight), when a guest host appears.\n\n(unconfirmed) - The name has been added to a title on the authority of a secondary source, but there is reason to believe it may be subject to change. (rumored) - The name has been added on the authority of a secondary source (usually the entertainment media), and is based on a strong industry rumor. (scenes deleted) - Someone has an on-screen credit for a scene that was filmed, but doesn't actually appear because the scenes were left on the cutting room floor. (as...) - Someone's credited with a different name from their usual name. Example: when Francis Ford Coppola is credited as Francis Coppola, the entry includes \"(as Francis Coppola)\". (voice) - Voice performance in a film, TV show. podcast, video game, etc. (more info) (voice: English version) - Someone is credited in an animated title or video game on the USA English-language release of a title originally released in another language. (motion capture) - Motion capture performance in a film, TV show, video game, etc. (more info)\n\n(archive footage) - A cast member appears in some footage, such as newsreel, behind-the-scenes, or home movies. (more info)\n\n(singing voice) - Singing voice performance in a film, TV show, video game, etc\n\n(archive sound) - Voice work from elsewhere is used, but was not specifically created for that project.\n\nInvalid attributes\n\nOn-screen credits (Credited vs Uncredited)\n\nIMDb's general principle for cast is to always follow what's listed in the onscreen credits - this is why it's important to capture the difference between those listed in the end credits and those who aren't.\n\nExample end credit roll showing credited names\n\nWhen a person was involved, but their name wasn't listed in the on-screen credits - we use the (uncredited) attribute to reflect it on the website.\n\nThis isn't designed to undermine the importance of a person's involvement in the production, simply to ensure we're reflecting how the title was released as accurately as possible.\n\nFurthermore, none of the following have any bearing on whether a person was (by our definition) credited:\n\npay stubs press mentions call sheets resumes agent listings visibility on screen\n\nWhile the information above may be used to help verify a person's uncredited involvement in a production, it doesn't serve to prove a credited role. The logic is rather binary in that respect:\n\nDo they appear in the production? Are they listed in the on-screen credits? Are they considered \"credited\"? Attribute Yes Yes no attribute Yes No (uncredited) No Yes (credit only)* No No Do not credit at all\n\n* (credit only) is most commonly used for principal cast members on episodic content\n\nGeneral Uncredited Rules\n\nThe following are likely to be discarded:\n\nUncredited submissions with an empty character field or with descriptions such as \"lead\", \"supporting\", \"background, \"extra\", \"featured\". If that's the case, the character name should include a description of the part - Woman with Dog, for instance - and (uncredited) in the 'attribute' box.\n\nBackground/extra work as a crowd member (or a similar role where it's impossible to recognize the subject)\n\nIt's not enough to have just worked on a production: The scenes must be included in the final cut, and it must be possible to easily identify their appearance.\n\nWe reserve the right to remove uncredited work at any time and periodically revise and adapt these criteria and reserve the right to retroactively restrict our eligibility rules for uncredited work.\n\nWe do not add additional uncredited roles to titles with a cast that has already been locked. Existing listings should not be taken as an indication that similar entries are automatically eligible. Please do not assume that the presence of a similar credit automatically implies that your entry should and will be accepted.\n\nFinally, on new and/or yet-unreleased titles, all credits we list are not final and are subject to change, especially until they can be checked against an actual title print. It's fairly common, for example, for uncredited roles to be removed from the site when final credits become available to us, or when/if a scene has ended up on the cutting room floor.\n\nRole-specific guidelines\n\nContains - archive footage | voice performances | motion capture | non-fiction / self\n\nArchive footage\n\nThe (archive footage) attribute is used for the inclusion of footage shot for a separate, earlier production (and not for the same series if episodic), such as a newsreel, home movie, outtakes, etc., or for archival documentation and not the specific production it is used in.\n\nYou should append (archive footage) with (uncredited) where necessary, as this is often the case.\n\nExample of archive footage & uncredited listings\n\nWe allow or exclude archive footage credits based on the following guidelines (although we reserve the right to make exceptions for special cases where necessary):\n\nBeing listed in the on-screen credits - If someone's appearance is credited on screen it automatically qualifies as a valid archive footage credit, regardless of what type of archive footage it is (this supersedes any of the exclusions below). The only exception to this is \"In Memorium\" tributes (where a still photograph or video clip of the individual in one of their famous roles appears on screen), these should be added to the \"thanks\" section using the appropriate \"occupation\". They're not eligible for a cast (archive footage) credit. A movie connection should be added instead linking to the title from which the footage originates.\n\nCan be covered by a movie link - If someone's appearance is uncredited and covered by a movie link entry (i.e., footage from a title is recycled as a \"prologue\" or flashback in a sequel or subsequent title in a series) it does not qualify as \"archive footage”.\n\nIf the footage is integral to the narrative - If archive footage is an integral part of the film's narrative, it's eligible. Additional examples: scenes from Poor Cow creatively used as flashbacks in The Limey; President Clinton's appearance in Contact.\n\nIf the footage is integral to the topic - If the title is a documentary and the archive footage is an integral/essential part of the story/topic, it qualifies (which means that even if he didn't appear as himself towards the end of the film, Charlton Heston's NRA rally footage would be enough to qualify as a valid \"archive footage\" entry, while Willie Horton's brief clip from the old anti-Dukakis campaign ad probably wouldn't).\n\nFor compilation/retrospectives only: If the title is a compilation/retrospective made up entirely or almost entirely of archive footage, then the people appearing in that footage qualify for archive footage credits.\n\nThe \"no degrees of separation\" rule: Only archive footage that is used directly in the title is eligible. If an actor appears in a title shown as being watched on TV in a scene of another film, then the first title clip is not eligible as archive footage. In other words, James Stewart's footage from Vertigo shown in a scene in Twelve Monkeys where Bruce Willis' character goes to the movies is not eligible.\n\nThe footage must be real - If someone's stock likeness appears as a photograph or as a poster on a wall, or on the cover of a magazine etc. in a scene of a film, it's not eligible.\n\nNote: The standard \"two wrongs don't make a right\" rule also applies: just because we have credits that violate some of the above, doesn't mean that the rules are not valid (it just means that those credits were accepted before the rules were established, or we didn't know better, or we just made a mistake).\n\nVoice credits\n\nDepending on the type of work performed, or how the person was credited - voice performances can be credited in the database as either:\n\nCast\n\nOther Crew\n\nNot at all\n\nBelow, you'll find guidance to help identify if a voice credit is eligible to be added.\n\nAdditionally, voice work is signified by the (voice) attribute on the credit:\n\nExample of a voice only credit\n\nGeneral voice rules\n\nTo be listed in the Cast section, actors performing voice work need to fulfill these three eligibility rules:\n\n1. Must have an on-screen credit - Due to the difficulty of verifying uncredited voice involvement, we don't allow uncredited voice credits.\n\n2. Must be credited in cast - They must have been credited in the cast section of the end titles (i.e. no 'background voices' or adr work). Additional Voice credits are permitted for animated titles or video games as long as they are listed within, or immediately after, the main cast list.\n\nAdr/looping/background voices & announcer credits for non-fiction titles (e.g. game shows, sporting events etc.) should be submitted as Additional (Other) Crew unless they are credited in the cast section.\n\n3. Must not be a dubbing* - Their work must be featured in the original language version of the production. (* We do allow dubbing for animated titles & video games on the USA English-language release only.)\n\nThe table below includes some examples of our dubbing guidelines:\n\n​\n\n(click to expand)\n\nWhat about Narrator credits?\n\nIf the individual performed work as a narrator on a project, they should be listed with the character name Narrator to reflect this.\n\nWhat about voice and motion capture together?\n\nIf the individual performed both the voice and the motion capture, neither attribute is required for the credit, this is considered as a full performance.\n\nMotion Capture credits\n\nMotion capture performances in a production can be credited in the database:\n\nCast\n\nOther Crew\n\nor not at all\n\nIf approved, these credits are signified by the (motion capture) attribute - however, attributes aren't visible on the credit when viewed on the website.\n\nGeneral motion capture guidelines\n\nTo be listed in the Cast section of the credits, actors performing motion capture work on a title need to fulfill these three eligibility rules:\n\n1. Must have an on-screen credit - They must have received an on-screen credit (i.e. no uncredited performances)\n\n2. Must be credited in \"cast\" - They must have been credited in the cast section of the end titles (i.e. no 'other motion capture' included elsewhere in the end credits or 3D modelling work).\n\nUnspecific motion capture/3D modelling work must be submitted asAdditional (Other) Crew credits. When in doubt, send it as a Additional (Other) Crew credit.\n\n3. Featured in original - Their work must be featured in the original version of the title (i.e. no digital remasters).\n\nIf motion capture was used in a title, please add the motion-capture keyword to the title page. This will allow users to search and discover a list of these titles on IMDb.\n\nWhat about motion capture and voice together?\n\nIf the individual performed both the voice and the motion capture, neither attribute is required for the credit, this is considered as a full performance.\n\nNon-fiction & self credits explained\n\nWhen an individual (or group) appears onscreen as themselves, the character name should be ‘Self’ (or ‘Themselves’).\n\nExample of Self credit\n\nWhere appropriate, this should include a hyphen and a description of their role in the title.\n\nOther examples include:\n\nSelf – Judge\n\nSelf – Interviewee/Guitarist\n\nThemselves – Band\n\nWhere someone is billed in the credits as themselves in a fictional piece and are playing a scripted, fictional version of themselves, we use the performer's name as the character name to avoid moving the credit to the 'Self' category.\n\nExample of scripted credit\n\nCharacter naming\n\nContains - episodes | punctuation | superheroes | groups | language | spoilers | descriptions\n\nEpisode guidelines\n\nPunctuation\n\nSuperheroes\n\nSuperheroes/Super villains and other characters with secret identities are considered to be two characters.\n\nSometimes, Superheroes and their alter-egos are manifestly distinct personalities - for example:\n\nClark Kent Vs. Superman\n\nMost of the time, the alter-ego is literally playing a different character to disguise their superhero status.\n\nAs such, we have special guidelines for adding Superhero characters:\n\nUnless otherwise displayed in the credits, character names for Superheroes and their alter-egos should be separated by a slash on the site (e.g. Bruce Wayne/Batman).\n\nIf the character names are displayed differently in the credits, the 'as credited onscreen' rule applies. Example: If Christian Bale is credited as 'Bruce Wayne - Batman', in the next Batman movie, then that is what will be displayed on the site.\n\nIf only one character name is displayed in the credits (either the Superhero name OR the alter-ego name), the ‘as credited onscreen' policy again applies.\n\nWhere no superhero/alter-ego names are credited onscreen, one or both may be submitted.\n\nIn the rare cases where no screen credit exists in any capacity (i.e. both actor and character names are missing), one or both character names can be submitted with an (uncredited) attribute.\n\nGroup names\n\nGrouped credits\n\nWhere necessary, plural/group names should be converted into their singular form. Here are a series of examples that hopefully cover most eventualities.\n\nEXAMPLE CREDITS\n\nCORRECT CHARACTER NAMES\n\nREASONS\n\nMOVIE PATRONS + PARTYGOERS\n\nJoe Blow\n\nNancy Doe\n\nJoe Blow - Movie Patron/Partygoer\n\nNancy Doe - Movie Patron/Partygoer\n\nWe don't know which actor was specifically a Movie Patron or a Partygoer. It could be the case that both actors played Movie Patrons and Partygoers.\n\nNEWLYWEDS\n\nJoe Blow\n\nNancy Doe\n\nJoe Blow - Newlywed\n\nNancy Doe - Newlywed\n\nThey are, in fact, individually newlywed!\n\nU.S. MARINES\n\nJoe Blow - Private Pyle\n\nNancy Doe - Corporal Vasquez\n\nJoe Blow - Private Pyle\n\nNancy Doe - Corporal Vasquez\n\nIn this example, there is a sub-heading in the end credits detailing what type of characters the actors play, and each actor also has a separate character name. However, the subheading (i.e. U.S. Marines) is NOT a character name, so it should NOT be included with the credit.\n\nGroup Credits\n\nWhen a group with identifiable members appears on-screen, we credit according to the way they are credited in the production.\n\nIf The Beatles are credited that way, we would not enter\n\nLennon, John (as The Beatles)\n\nMcCartney, Paul (as The Beatles)\n\nHarrison, George (as The Beatles)\n\nStarr, Ringo (as The Beatles)\n\nInstead, they would simply be credited as \"Beatles, The\".\n\nIn the above cases, individual members of the group can be added to credits with the (uncredited) attribute.\n\ne.g. Help! (1965):\n\nPaul McCartney ... Paul - The Beatles (uncredited)\n\nOr if appropriate (documentaries, talk shows etc.)\n\nPaul McCartney ... Self - The Beatles (uncredited)\n\nPlease note, we prefer the \"Paul - The Beatles\" hyphenated character notation, rather than \"member of\" or \"one of\".\n\nIf they're credited in the credits both as a group and individually (i.e.: \"The Beatles: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr\"), then both the group name and individual names would be listed as they are in the credits.\n\nWhere a band is credited in the form 'Bandleader and The Musicians' (Elvis Costello and the Attractions, for instance) they should be credited that way and will have an entry in the database all of their own. It's possible, though, that in other titles they'll be credited separately or independently. If either Bandleader or The Musicians appear somewhere on their own, we could end up with an entry for 'Bandleader' as well as one for 'The Musicians'. So, we have a page for Elvis Costello on his own as well as one for Elvis Costello and the Attractions. So far, we have no page for The Attractions, but if they ever get a qualifying credit on their own without Costello we'll create one. As long as they are credited on screen that way, this is fine.\n\nLanguage\n\nDavid Prowse plays Darth Vader in Star Wars. Clint Eastwood plays Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry. Even though the Italian release of those films changed those two names to Darth Fener and Harry Callaghan respectively, we will stick to the character names used in the original version.\n\nFor descriptive character names (i.e., Mayor, Man #1), they should generally be entirely in the language of the original version, but English can be used if the original is not known.\n\nSpoilers\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead!\n\nIan Hart plays Professor Quirrell in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, but you're not supposed to know he's also Voldemort.\n\nIan Holm plays Sir William Gull in From Hell and his character name is not \"Jack the Ripper\".\n\nThose are both supposed to be surprises. If you haven't seen those two films, we just spoiled them for you. Sorry about that, but imagine how our users feel when they come to the site and see those character names before seeing the film. Even if factually correct, character names that constitute spoilers must be avoided at all costs.\n\nThis is especially true for multiple character names that can be easily omitted: it's just as effective to say that Cary Grant plays \"Peter Joshua\" in Charade. There is no need to say that he plays \"Peter Joshua/Alexander Dyle/Adam Canfield/Brian Cruikshank\", even if that's true.\n\nCharacter descriptions\n\nCharacter descriptions must be limited to the context of the film, and including extra information that comes from other sources than the title is not permitted.\n\nFor example:\n\nAnthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs; Brian Cox plays Hannibal Lecktor in Manhunter. Yes, they're the same character, but the spelling is different, and we will stick to each film's peculiar version.\n\nSigourney Weaver's character in Alien is called simply Ripley. The fact that her first name is Ellen is not disclosed/introduced until the sequel Aliens; therefore her character name in Alien is Ripley, not Ellen Ripley.\n\nNichelle Nichols plays \"Uhura\" in the TV series \"Star Trek\" and in the films. According to some Star Trek books and novelizations, Uhura's first name is Nyota, but that name is not used in the films or TV series, so it should not be used on the site.\n\nVarious Star Wars books and novelizations may include name, rank and serial numbers for every single Imperial Stormtrooper ever shown in the films, but we'll still list them all simply as \"Stormtroopers\" unless the on-screen credits have a different description.\n\nCast ordering\n\nOrder numbers are used to control the display of credits on a title page - they should be ordered according to the most comprehensive cast list (the one listing the most actors); in most cases, this will be the list appearing in the end credits.\n\n(Example credit ordering from 1917)\n\nThere are some additional situations to keep in mind when ordering Cast credits:\n\nWhere actors are listed more than once in the credit roll (as often happens in animation, for example) we list the characters as detailed in the Character Names section. Order numbers then skip the place where the actor's name appears again.\n\nSo this:\n\n(as seen in the end credits)\n\n1 Alison Adams ... Ann\n\n2 Bill Brown ... Bobby\n\n3 Charlotte Clearwater ... Claire\n\n4 David Dewhurst ... Donald\n\n5 Alison Adams ... Abigail\n\n6 Eric Ehrhardt ... Ernest\n\n7 Francesca Fitzherbert ... Fiona\n\nBecomes this:\n\n(as listed on the site)\n\n1 Alison Adams ... Ann/Abigail\n\n2 Bill Brown ... Bobby\n\n3 Charlotte Clearwater ... Claire\n\n4 David Dewhurst ... Donald\n\n6 Eric Ehrhardt ... Ernest\n\n7 Francesca Fitzherbert ... Fiona\n\nThe number 5 has been skipped so that all subsequent order numbers remain the same.\n\nIn some cases (i.e., TV movies), the cast list is split between the opening credits and end credits; in those cases, the two portions should be treated as one long cast list that happens to be interrupted by the actual movie. This also applies to some movies from the 1950s, where a list of the main cast appeared at the beginning, and was then repeated in reverse order at the end, with pictures, followed by additional cast members.\n\nFor documentaries or talk shows where the people appearing on camera are generally not in a separate cast list, their first onscreen appearance where they are identified either by a caption or spoken name is used to determine the order. Any narrator/host listed in opening or closing credits or the title itself would be treated as the first cast member, and would precede people identified only within the documentary or talk show.\n\nWe're aware that casts in order of appearance or alphabetical order sometimes mean a lead actor is buried relatively deep in the cast list. This is somewhat unfortunate. We do have a separate system for indicating the lead actors via the \"Stars\" section, but this can only be amended internally by IMDb staff members.\n\nDo not enter an order number for someone who is uncredited.\n\nOrder numbers are not honored for projects before they have begun filming; such orders are far too subject to change. In addition, the order numbers will not affect the display of credits until a significant percentage of the credited cast has order numbers.\n\nDid this answer your question?\n\nThank you!
