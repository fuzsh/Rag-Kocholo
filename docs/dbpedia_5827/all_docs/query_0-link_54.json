        "text": "Overview\n\nLocation and Housing\n\nAcademics\n\nExperiential Learning\n\nFaculty and Staff\n\nCosts\n\nThe Pittsburgh-London Film Program aims to provide students with a uniquely rich academic and cultural experience, combining the highest level of academic expertise with the world class production skills of the Derek Jarman Lab. All the courses on the program take London as their focus and all seek to mix production with history and analysis.\n\nTo attest to the outstanding quality of this program, several of the Pittsburgh London Film Program student’s essay films have been selected to screen at the BFI Future Film Festival!\n\nThe program is composed of five courses. At all stages the program combines theoretical academic analysis and detailed history of film with an emphasis on film-making practice. Each course provides students with an inventive and rich configuration of seminars, weekly screenings, and practical film production.\n\nYou can also do an internship in the field of your interest.\n\nSee a video about the program, created by one of the program's alumni here. And hear about the students' experience on the program here.\n\nWhat You'll Accomplish:\n\nAs an engaged and active participant in this program, you will have the opportunity:\n\nto study theory and practice of film production with renowned Hollywood screenwriters and British producers\n\nto develop film production skills while working in the world-class Derek Jarman Lab\n\nexplore London with your camera, filming on the city streets to leave your semester with a portfolio of written work and short films\n\nIf your first thoughts of London are the Royal Family and Downton Abbey, prepare to be blown away. English history and culture are juxtaposed against streets lined with Indian restaurants and Chinese New Year celebrations. The birthplace of the English language is now home to speakers of more than 30 other languages – and that is not counting the variety of English accents you will hear. Skyscrapers tower over 17th-century buildings while Big Ben overlooks the River Thames. Study abroad in London and you find yourself constantly surprised by what you discover in one of the world’s most diverse and global cities.\n\nWhere You'll Live:\n\nPart of the experience is to live like a Londoner. The overwhelming majority of students choose to live in shared apartments – the English call them flats – spread across the city. While apartments are as varied as the city itself and no two flats are alike, all of them are located in safe neighborhoods and secure buildings. Regardless of where you live, you can expect a 45- to 60-minute commute to the CEA CAPA Center. We’ve got your commute covered with an unlimited pass for Zones 1 and 2 on the London Underground.\n\nYou can expect the following:\n\nShared bedrooms (2 or 3 students/bedroom, single bed or bunk bed)\n\nBedding, but need to bring your own towels\n\nShared bathroom\n\nShared kitchen\n\nInternet access (for general browsing, but not meant for heavy downloading or streaming)\n\nCoin operated laundry\n\nIt is not typical for UK residences to have air conditioning or dryers\n\nPlease note that meals are not included in the program fee.\n\nYou will receive your address, roommate information, and neighborhood description about 2 weeks before your departure for London.\n\nWe do our best to provide the most accurate information about housing and amenities but due to the nature of the locations in which we offer programs and limited availability, these items are subject to change. Contact your program manager with any questions.\n\nIf apartment living does not appeal to you, homestays are also an option. Email your Pitt program manager for more information.\n\nWhat You'll Study:\n\nThe program is composed of five courses. Should you chose to complete a part-time internship, you will drop either FMST 1198 Gogglebox or FMST 1196 Diversity in British Cinema. At all stages the program combines theoretical academic analysis and detailed history of film with an emphasis on film-making practice. Each course provides students with an inventive and rich configuration of seminars, weekly screenings, and practical film production. All courses seek to reject the division between theory and practice and to provide teaching which articulates both.\n\nFilm and Media Studies Requirements fulfilled by The Pittsburgh-London Film Program:\n\nENGFLM 1495 City Symphony counts for the Film Studies Major as a Category 1 National Cinemas and Filmmakers\n\nENGFLM 1497 Urban Scavenger counts for the Film Studies Major as a Category 3 Film/Photo/Video Production\n\nENGFLM 1493 The City Made Strange counts for the Film Studies Major as a Category 2 Themes, Genres, and Theory\n\nFMST 1196 - Diversity in British Cinema: Race, Gender and Class counts for the Film Studies Major as a Category 1: National Cinemas and Filmakers.\n\nFMST 1198 Gogglebox: British Television Analysis and Industry counts for the Film Studies Major, minor and TVBA certificate as an elective, Category 2: Themes/Genra/Theory.\n\nGeneral Education Requirements fulfilled by The Pittsburgh-London Film Program:\n\nENGFLM 1497 Urban Scavenger fulfills Creative Work\n\nENGFLM 1493 The City Made Strange fulfills both Specific Geographic Region and The Arts\n\nFMST 1195 fulfills Diversity\n\nFMST 1196 fulfills Creative Work and The Arts\n\nLearning through Internships (ARTSC1903)\n\nThe Learning through Internships program is a unique and innovative opportunity for students to combine their internship placement (and living abroad) experience with a weekly in-class educational and mentoring experience (session), which aims to develop students' personal and professional skills while earning academic credit. The Focus Seminars and Regional Identities lectures and activities which make up an important part of the program are designed to provide theory and practice around societal themes which inform and enrich the internship experience. Students enrolling in ARTSC 1903 will earn 3 semester credits and intern 15-20 hours per week.\n\nSyllabus:\n\nDownload Sample Syllabus INTP 3347.pdf (293.51 KB)\n\nThe City Made Strange (ENGFLM1493)\n\nThis course fulfills the \"Category II: Themes, Genres, and Theory\" Film and Media Studies requirement and the \"Specific Geographic Region\" and \"The Arts\" General Education requirements for the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nLondon has existed for more than two thousand years, and the ghosts of the recent and ancient past remain abroad in its streets and its culture. This course aims to explore the deep funds of strangeness and otherness that permeate London’s places and spaces, through examining films and television series that show the city as a brimming reservoir of past and future shocks.\n\nThe course will examine science fiction, horror and noir/neo-gothic cinema and television from all eras, with a particular emphasis on works that take London itself as a major part of their story. These might be disaster or alien invasion films that see the city as a site of destruction or devastation, horror films which render a familiar city frightening and strange, or noir explorations of London’s underbelly that expose sides of the city that are normally hidden.\n\nThe course will both present an alternative history of London on film, and also provide students with rich possibilities for the analytic study of film and television. Horror and science fiction are notorious as vessels for the expression of both social and political anxieties, and the selection of films would encourage analyses of both psychological content and broader contexts (areas might include, for instance, Cold War-era fears, body horror, racial or class concerns).\n\nReadings will be both critical and complementary, and hope to locate uncanny London on film in relation not only to American cinematic tropes in genres such as horror, but also to the large fictional and occult literature which features London as a place of archaic energies and occult forces.\n\nAll students develop their basic skills in analyzing film texts, and will also develop a good grasp of long-trends and recent themes in British horror and science fiction cinema. They will gain insight into the ways that film can reflect and respond to contemporary social and political conditions and events, and the way that film and television relate to literature. Students will gain an understanding of horror and science fiction as key genres in British film, and gain awareness of some key points at which these genres in British cinema and television differ from their counterparts in US film.\n\nAs a result, students on this course will:\n\n- understand and engage with the international history of cinema (as well as that of other visual media forms) and be able to ­place media texts within their social, political, cultural and historical contexts.\n\n-have hands-on experience in at least one area of film and media production (e.g. photography, film, video, video installation, or digital imaging).\n\n-be able to write clearly, coherently and skillfully about the cinema (its history, theory, aesthetics, and/or social/cultural context).\n\nCity Symphony (ENGFLM1495)\n\nThis course fulfills the \"Category I: National Cinemas and Filmmakers\" Film and Media Studies requirement.\n\nThe city symphony film emerged in the 1920s, when filmmakers were experimenting with the mobility of viewpoint enabled by the portable film camera and more sensitive panchromatic film stock. The city, in particular its interwar technologies of urban transport and machinery, provided the ideal testing ground for the newly sensitive and mobile camera. It demanded to be seen, and shown, in a new mode that for Brazilian director Alberto Cavalcanti, only film could provide. But of all the international cities that were given the symphony treatment in the 1920s – New York, Paris, Berlin, St Petersburg, Sao Paulo – London was missing. If London lacked its own ‘city symphony’ film in the 1920s, what were the significant representations of the urban experience? This course looks at the ways in which London both invited and defied the filmmaker’s gaze in this critical period of early cinema, and considers how a contemporary city symphony for London might be composed.\n\nThe city has been an integral part of the filmmaker’s vocabulary since cinema’s genesis in the late nineteenth century. The urban environment and the craft of film grew up together in the twentieth century, seasoned by various convergences of technology, one notable one in the 1920s with broadcast radio, telephony and the talkies, and another over the last fifteen years, with broadband, smartphone cameras, and digital media. This course bridges these two periods, drawing on history and theory to interrogate the form of the city symphony film essay, and develop an urban filmmaking practice that allows students to gather and formulate their own reflections on London.\n\nThe course will be run alongside Urban Scavenger, in which students will develop and make their own film within a taught theoretical framework. Students will be strongly encouraged to bring ideas from one to the other, and to combine critical analysis with practical filmmaking.\n\nUrban Scavenger (ENGFLM1497)\n\nThis course fulfills the \"Category III: Film/Photo/Video Production\" Film and Media Studies requirement and the \"Creative Work\" General Education requirement for the Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe Urban Scavenger course takes the camera as a tool for the excavation of ordinary things scattered in the urban spaces of a modern metropolis. With a focus on the archaeology of banality and the relation between the public and the private we will explore the iconography of London through the lenses of surrealism, psychogeography and material culture studies. The course will look at a variety of moving image practices but with a special attention to the genres of the film essay, film diary and vlog, covered concurrently in the partner City Symphony course. By closely integrating practical elements with theoretical sessions, we hope to draw connections between the discourse on urban consumer society and the images surrounding it, between collecting objects and editing, between the order of things and creating a political narrative.\n\nStudents will be asked to gather shots on a weekly basis responding to the discussions during the theoretical sessions. The shots will be uploaded to a dedicated video blog and commented on by the whole group throughout the term. Towards its end the footage collected by the students will be revised and they will be encouraged to use it when editing their own essay film.\n\nMethods of instruction will include screenings, in-class presentations and analyses, filming sessions, field trips to unusual London locations, crits or review sessions and editing supervision.\n\nDiversity in British Cinema (FILMST1195)\n\nFMST 1195 Diversity in British Cinema: Race, Gender and Class-This intensive and comprehensive course will allow students to take an innovative approach that sees race, gender and class in close dialogue with the underlying cultural phenomena that shape the British cinematic landscape. The course is designed to introduce students to British cinema whilst engaging in theory, practice and analysis. It intertwines historical accounts with film screenings and lectures as well as discussions with filmmakers and curators.\n\nFMST 1195 Diversity in British Cinema: Race, Gender and Class introduces students to the question of diversity in relation to Britain and British cinema over the last fifty years. There are three different emphases in the course: race, gender and class, although we will be closely looking at their intersectionality. The first section of the course will examine race and multiculturalism in British film with an emphasis on the works of Isaac Julien. This section will cover the last forty years in British cinema with some of its major participants in the form of historians, filmmakers and curators. The second section of the course, taught by Professor Laura Mulvey, will look at films dealing with questions of gender and class and their modes of representation. The final section of the course will introduce students to the British class system through its modern representations and contestations.\n\nEach class includes a theoretical discussion that provides a critical framework for working with visual media. Topics explored include multiculturalism, gentrification, women-inflected cinema amongst many others. This will allow students to both understand the cultural context of British cinema over the last fifty years, as taught by some of the leading figures in the British film industry.\n\nThis course will meet once per week. Each session will have a screening, lecture and seminar discussion.\n\nGogglebox: British Television Analysis and Industry (FILMST1198)\n\nThe gogglebox, the tv set, or perhaps these days your phone or tablet: The small screen takes many forms these days, and is ‘on demand’ in a way unlike any other time in the last century. Britain has a long and complex history of televisual endeavours. The influence of the BBC, ITV, Channel Four and now the streaming giants on British social, cultural and economic practices is immeasurable. The theoretical half of this course will critically engage with genre, national identity, culture wars and the sense of self Britain gets from the massive output of content on these shores, whilst simultaneously examining the nuances of British television industry practices, funding structures and distribution networks. The practical half of this course will seamlessly integrate practical exercises that make connections between these case studies and technological and industry policies and practices. While the title of this course refers to British television, this misnomer will form an undercurrent running through every session: who decides what British identity vis a vis television is? Who is defined as British on screen? What outputs are embraced as emblematic of Britain and who is excluded and overlooked? Why say British at all and not English since this course will not examine specific Scottish, Welsh or Irish productions? Through written critical work and practical exercises in pitching ideas and analyzing television scripts, students will leave with a critical and practical foundation in the British television industry. This course is a Category II elective that counts for the major, minor, and TVBA certificate. This course takes place in London as part of the Pittsburgh London Film Program.\n\nExperiential Learning Description:\n\nAs a part of the program you can do an optional internship. Whether your post-graduation plans include entering the workforce, going to graduate school, or pursuing a different path, professional work experience always stands out on a resume.\n\nInternships in London are 20 hours per week, excluding commuting time. In addition to workplace experience, you will also meet with peers and faculty for internship seminars to help you get the most out of the experience. Internships are always unpaid, always for three credits, and always pass/fail.\n\nYou can sign up for an internship regardless of your major as a part of the application process. Keep in mind that you will not know what your internship placement is until 14 days before departure. While this may seem like a long time to wait, remember that our partners are searching for an internship just for you. Your past experiences, coursework, and desired placements areas are all taken into account. This kind of personalized service takes time but is well worth the wait.\n\nGet in touch with your Pitt Study Abroad program manager to learn more about internships. Please note that internships are availble for students in their second semester of sophomore year or higher.\n\nAs part of your study abroad program in the UK, you will be required to apply for a student visa if you are pursuing an internship placement. Please be aware that UK visa processing times may be delayed due to ongoing impacts of the global pandemic. Obtaining a visa is solely your responsibility and is a very detailed process.
