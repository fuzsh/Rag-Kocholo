        "text": "Kids with social skills issues may struggle with empathy — the ability to understand and relate to the feelings of others. This can make it hard for them to make friends and navigate social situations. These 12 films can help kids learn how to put themselves in someone else’s shoes.\n\n(Common Sense Media’s recommended ages are only a guide, and may not be right for every child.)\n\nIt’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\n\nThe animated film It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown features well-known Peanuts characters Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Snoopy. The plot is simple. Linus hopes for a visit from The Great Pumpkin, but no one else believes in him. The characters are sometimes mean to each other, but that’s a good opportunity to kick off a discussion about the feelings of others.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 4+ Rated: Not rated\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhen is Charlie Brown happy? When is he sad?\n\nHow can you tell that Snoopy takes his Halloween costume very seriously?\n\nWhy does Lucy get Linus from the pumpkin patch and put him to bed?\n\nBeauty and the Beast\n\nMagic turns an arrogant prince into an ugly beast. To try to break the spell, the beast takes a young woman named Belle captive in his castle. She starts to see the beast’s inner beauty, but her village marches to destroy him. The music, story, and animations in Disney’s Beauty and the Beast movie will captivate kids — raising questions about the nature of appearances.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 6+ Rated: G\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhat is Belle feeling when she agrees to be the Beast’s captive?\n\nWhy is Gaston surprised that Belle doesn’t want to marry him?\n\nWhy do the villagers want to destroy the beast?\n\nInside Out\n\nInside Out is an animated Pixar film about the feelings of an 11-year-old girl named Riley. Anger, Sadness, Joy, Fear, and Disgust are all characters in the film. They must work together to help Riley make the right decisions in life. Inside Out is more serious than a typical Pixar movie, but it can teach kids a lot about emotions. (Read why Inside Out is great for kids with attention issues .)\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 6+ Rated: PG\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhy is it hard for Riley to tell her parents how she is feeling?\n\nHow does Bing Bong feel when he helps Joy escape?\n\nWhat does it mean to have “mixed emotions” about something?\n\nE.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\n\nIn the classic family film E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, a young boy named Elliott makes friends with an alien who is stranded on Earth. Elliott tries to help E.T. “go home.” But other humans are afraid of E.T., and government scientists try to catch and study the alien. This film can help kids explore how people see others who are different.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 7+ Rated: PG\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhy do the kids and adults see E.T. differently?\n\nCould Elliott have talked to his mom about E.T.? Why or why not?\n\nDid you know that the director, Steven Spielberg, has ? Do you think that helped him relate to the characters, and how?\n\nZootopia\n\nIn a world where animals can talk, a rabbit named Judy Hopps and a fox named Nick Wilde team up to solve a kidnapping case. Zootopia is an exciting crime mystery that has lots of jokes that will go over kids’ heads (and that parents may love). But it’s a great tool for helping kids learn about tolerance and the danger of stereotypes.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 8+ Rated: PG\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhat kinds of stereotypes do the animals of Zootopia have about rabbits and foxes?\n\nHow do Judy’s and Nick’s opinions about each other change in the film?\n\nIs there something human society can learn from Zootopia?\n\nFiddler on the Roof\n\nFiddler on the Roof is an epic musical story of Jews in Ukraine facing religious persecution while trying to hold on to their traditions. The main character is Tevye. He butts heads with his daughters over marriage, and they are all threatened by a hostile government. Fiddler on the Roof can help kids understand how cultures shape people.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 10+ Rated: G\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nAt the start of the film, Tevye sings “If I were a rich man…” Have you ever felt like him?\n\nWhy do Tevye and his daughters disagree about marriage?\n\nDo you know of any people today who are persecuted because of their religion?\n\nNapoleon Dynamite\n\nThis sweet, quirky film about a social misfit in high school will not appeal to all kids. But those who march to a different beat may like Napoleon Dynamite. The wide range of characters in the film is also a good jumping-off point for conversations about the uniqueness of every person.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 11+ Rated: PG\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nIs Napoleon’s life in a small town in Idaho similar to or different from your life?\n\nHow do Napoleon and Pedro try to show that they care about others?\n\nWhat kinds of hopes do the different characters in the film have?\n\nBully\n\nBully is a powerful documentary about the impact of bullying in America. Through heartbreaking real-life stories, the film takes on issues of name-calling, physical violence, and teen suicide. This movie is intense and not appropriate for every child. It’s probably best to watch this film together with your child.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 12+ Rated: PG-13\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nHow do the kids who are bullied feel? Have you ever felt that way?\n\nWhy do you think it’s so hard for kids to stand up when another child is bullied?\n\nHow can kids and adults help stop the problem of bullying?\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\n\nFour high school friends separate for the summer and keep in touch by mailing letters and a pair of blue jeans to each other. During the summer, they learn about friendship, family, love, and loss. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants can help kids talk about how people go through and respond to different experiences.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 12+ Rated: PG\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nWhich character do you identify with the most? Why?\n\nWhen something bad happens in your life, do you ever feel like it happens for a reason?\n\nHow can you be mad at someone and love them at the same time?\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird\n\n“You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view.” So says Atticus Finch, a lawyer who decides to defend a Black man accused of rape in the 1930s Deep South. This classic film teaches kids about the impact of racism. To Kill a Mockingbird can also help kids understand the importance of not judging others by their appearance.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 12+ Rated: Not rated\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nDo you think you could stand up like Atticus to fight for what’s right?\n\nWhy is the character Boo Radley so misunderstood?\n\nWhat do you think the jurors are thinking as they consider the case?\n\nThe Breakfast Club\n\nIn The Breakfast Club, five high school students — some popular and others not — spend Saturday detention together. They end up setting aside their differences to learn about one another’s hopes, fears, and dreams. There’s a lot of racy content in this film, but it can help your teen learn about social dynamics in high school.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 15+ Rated: R\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child\n\nDoes your high school have cliques like in the movie? (Read ways to help teens handle cliques.)\n\nWhich student in the movie is the most like you?\n\nDo you think the students will continue to be friends when they go back to school the next week? Why or why not?\n\nDo the Right Thing\n\nSpike Lee’s Do the Right Thing is set in Harlem, New York, and follows a story of racial unrest that takes place over a single day around a pizza parlor. Throughout the film, characters speak directly to the camera to share their viewpoints. Do the Right Thing can help your child learn about how misunderstandings can shape real-life events.\n\nCommon Sense Media recommended ages: 16+ Rated: R\n\nDiscussion questions to ask your child"
