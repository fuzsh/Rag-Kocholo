        "text": "I love using short films to teach reading comprehension skills, and my students love watching them!\n\nWhy do I love using them?\n\nShow a short film and students are engaged! Visual learners and students who typically struggle with reading comprehension, including English language learners (ELLs), have greater success practicing comprehension skills with shorts. Most shorts do not have dialogue, they’re all action. My students, regardless of their level of language proficiency, “get” the lesson more easily because the shorts are visual.\n\nWhere can you find short films?\n\nMy go to place to find great shorts is YouTube. Be careful to always view films before showing them in class. You don’t want any unexpected surprises! Also, sometimes there is an advertisement to get through at the beginning, so I always set it up beforehand, that way it’s all ready to go for the lesson.\n\nWhich reading skills can be taught using shorts?\n\nJust about ANY reading skill can be taught with shorts: making connections, asking questions, sequencing, predictions, drawing conclusions, plot, character development, theme, and this list goes on and on!\n\nLearning what the skill looks like visually, and practicing with a media kids are already familiar with, is an effective first step in students applying the skill to their reading.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite lessons to teach is “theme.” Last year, my fifth graders were having trouble grasping the concept, so I searched for a good short film to visually “show” them theme, and I found the perfect one!\n\nI describe theme as the heart of the story. I then share common themes found in stories, such as, perseverance, family, friendship, hope, honesty, self determination, courage, etc. For this lesson, my students watched the film twice. The first time was simply to enjoy the story. After their first viewing, I asked them to share what they noticed about the film. Then I asked, “What do you think the message or big idea was in this film?” They shared lots of thoughts, and I noted the common ideas the group came up, which were love and hope. Then I showed the film again. This time I set the purpose to look for symbols of love, and evidence of hope. After the second viewing they shared many of the symbols of love, and they noticed that the song lyrics sang about having hope. Discussions got pretty deep, which made my teacher heart happy;) To support my beginning ELLs, I printed pictures of the different scenes that symbolized love (couples- turtles, birds, whales, clouds).\n\nBy the end of the lesson my students had a good understanding of the skill, and they were ready to practice looking for a theme in their own reading. We continued to practice during guided reading, and spiraled back to theme as we read throughout the year.\n\nOther favorites…\n\nPiper: Character Development\n\nFor the Birds: Infer, Predictions or Cause and Effect\n\nHome Sweet Home: Asking Questions This short is a bit long (10 minutes).\n\nKiwi!: Drawing Conclusions (Warning- this one is sad.)\n\nBoundin: Lesson, Theme, Plot\n\nLifted: Plot\n\nDustin: Inferring, Conflict, Conflict Resolution (Compare with “Joy and Heron”)\n\nJoy and Heron: Problem/Solution, Story Elements, Lesson/Message (Compare with “Dustin”)\n\nTake Me Home: Inferring\n\nJinxy Jenkins and Lucky Lou: Compare and Contrast\n\nSoar: Predictions, Plot, Story Elements\n\nSweet Cocoon: Story Elements, Drawing Conclusions\n\nChanging Batteries: Drawing Conclusions, Inferring (This one is sad too.)\n\nA Fox and a Mouse: Plot, Character Development, Setting, Conflict\n\nSnack Attack: Flashback\n\nDia De Los Muertos: Character Development, Symbolism (blue flower)\n\nOne Small Step: Plot, Theme, Character Development\n\nThe Box: Making Inferences, Making Prediction, Character Development, Story Elements"
