Asking for Trouble by Tessa Bailey

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/5

220/250

Book 4 in the Line of Duty series stars Hayden and Brent. Brent Mason is a hard working cop helping to support his family and Hayden hails from a rich family and plans charity parties. This is an opposites attract, enemies to lovers, almost forced proximity romance. Brent is absolutely what made this book. He is a hard working, honest, devoted, dirty talking man in uniform, need I say more?!?!

I have 1 more book to finish this series, but don't own it yet and am working on my current TBR list for the rest of this year, so I will have to finish this series later.

Hate-flirting makes up for the TSTL rich girl plot

“He kicked his caveman in the nuts and focused on her.”

Yay for cavemen who talk as hard as they- … And whoo! The chemistry as Brent and Hayden hate-flirt is only topped by the chemistry when they hate- … Yeah, this author’s books are dirty, so if you prefer your romances closer to cozy than crass, this book is not for you. Her books are risky for me, as the odds are 50-50 whether I’m on board for the dirty or whether the crass crosses my lines. But, this particular series worked for me and this book was a favorite.

“He’s sock guy?!”

The comedy is strong in this one, especially with the previous couple joining in for a lot of four-way ball busting. You don’t need to have heard 1 or 2, but I recommend listening to book 3 (Officer Off Limits) before starting this one.

“Did you tell her about the leg thing?”

The one thing that chapped my undies was the forced marriage plot for rich girl Hayden. The whole needing to marry for money schtick only works in regency romance. Hayden’s got a brain and backbone yet uses neither. There are multiple points where conflict could have been resolved with simple conversation. She’s also got her own trust fund, yet that money source is ignored in service to building the Big Scene. Yes, yes, the Big Scene was funny and heartfelt. It was just one too many cliche pills to swallow to get there … or maybe a dozen cliche pills. Rich people’s problems are so not my jam.

Thank goodness for working man Brent, the sexiest cop with the dirtiest mouth. His being a cop barely signifies, but that’s okay, because the cuffs are put to much better use when he’s off the clock.

Jersey Shore

Enjoyed the story, though the main thread through out was a young woman trying to connect with her mother by making life decisions that would please the bitter woman, which was a bit annoying.

My main problem was with the narrator. It might be that a Jersey accent is common, but he sounded like an actor using an exaggerated accent to audition for Jersey Shore. I considered returning, but gritted my teeth and was able to finish.

Graphic sex scenes, not suitable for young readers.
