What Is the Afghan Afghani (AFN)?

The Afghan afghani (AFN) is the national currency of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Its ISO 4217 code, AFN, was introduced in 2003 as part of efforts to stabilize the currency and reduce inflation. Prior to this change, it circulated under the symbol AFA.

As of Sept. 1, 2022, $1 USD is worth 88.23 AFN.

Understanding the Afghan Afghani (AFN)

Afghanistan has undergone many changes to its currency in recent decades. In 1925, the Afghan rupee was replaced with the original afghani, which was then reformed in 2002 and issued for circulation as the AFN in 2003. The previous afghani operated under a fixed exchange rate, whereas the AFN operates on a managed floating exchange rate.

The economy of Afghanistan has endured substantial challenges. The Soviet-Afghan War, which began in 1979, raged for nearly a decade, and the country has been gripped by various civil wars since then.

Today, the AFN is managed by Afghanistan's central bank, "Da Afghanistan Bank." Its monetary policy objective is to minimize the risk of inflation while maintaining the floating exchange rate regime. In 2002, the central bank introduced banknotes in denominations of one, two, five, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 AFN. In 2005, the one, two, and five AFN banknotes were replaced with coins.

Afghanistan's Economy

Although today the AFN enjoys relatively low rates of inflation, Afghanistan has experienced severe bouts of inflation in the past. Between 1982 and 1992, hyperinflation caused the exchange rate of AFN to U.S. dollars (USD) to rise from 50.60 to 16,000.

In more recent times, inflation reached nearly 15% in 2011, and has hovered around 5% per year since.

According to the World Bank, economic growth in Afghanistan has been hampered by persistent political instability within the country. These factors have discouraged private investment and dampened consumer demand.
