        "meta_description": "Afghanistan’s currency is called the Afghan Afghani (afn) and was created in 1925 to replace the Afghan rupee. Although the Afghan Afghanis has many coins and older banknotes, we will focus on the current banknote set series of 2002. This series has the denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 with the 1, 2 and 5 afghani banknotes being the only banknotes replaced by coins. \nThe 10 Afghani note features the Mausoleum of Mirwais Khan Hotaki and on the back is an image of Paghman with monuments dedicated to Afghanistan’s fallen soldiers. The 20 Afghani note features the Mausoleum of Sultan Mahmud in Ghazni and on the back is the Citadel of the King. The 50 note features Shah-do-Shamsira Mosque and the Hindu Kush mountains. The 100 Afghani banknote has the Pul-e Khishti Mosque on the obverse and the reverse has the Arch of Qala-e-Bost. The 500 note has the “Friday Mosque” on the front and the control tower of Kandahar Airport on the back. Lastly, the 1000 Afghani note features the Noble Shrine on the front and on the back is the Mausoleum of Ahmad Shah Duarrani.",
