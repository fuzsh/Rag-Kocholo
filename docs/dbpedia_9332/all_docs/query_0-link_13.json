        "text": "The events of August 15, 2021 triggered a sharp contraction and reconfiguration of the Afghan economy and approaches to international aid. Reduced aid drove a steep decline in aggregate demand and widespread disruptions to public services. Afghanistan lost access to the international banking system and offshore foreign exchange reserves as the central bank assets were frozen. Disruption and uncertainty led to sharp declines in investment confidence, and tens of thousands of highly skilled Afghans fled the country.\n\nAfter a severe 20.7 percent GDP contraction in 2021, the Afghan economy contracted further by 6.2 percent in 2022. While Afghanistan’s agricultural and subsistence economy, including illicit opium production, provided some resilience in rural areas, higher prices, reduced demand, lower employment, and disruptions to services had severe impacts across the country. The proportion of households that did not have enough income to meet basic food needs more than doubled from 16 percent to 36 percent in this period.\n\nIn the context of deep concerns about the policies of the interim Taliban administration (ITA), including restrictions imposed on women and girls, the international community, including the World Bank, recalibrated its approach to supporting Afghanistan: first to providing humanitarian support and then to providing off-budget support for basic service delivery and livelihoods.\n\nThe rapid deterioration of economic conditions slowed by the summer of 2022. This can be attributed to the end of active conflict and the resumption of international humanitarian and basic service aid beginning in December 2021. The off-budget aid helped some recovery in private sector activity by cushioning falling aggregate demand amid relative political stability and reduced corruption. The interim Taliban administration (ITA) moved to restore domestic revenues, which reached $2.2 billion or 15 percent of GDP in 2022, although still lower than the on-budget $5.2 billion available during 2019. Nevertheless, overall economic activity remained depressed, unemployment stayed high, and the banking sector was dysfunctional due to constraints on international transfers and concerns about liquidity and solvency.\n\nToday, Afghanistan's economic outlook remains uncertain, with the threat of stagnation looming large until at least 2025. The absence of GDP growth coupled with declining external financing avenues for off-budget expenditures paint a bleak picture of the country's economic prospects. Structural deficiencies in the private sector, coupled with waning international support for essential services, are expected to impede any appreciable economic progress. This economic stagnation will deepen poverty and unemployment, with job opportunities expected to decrease and food insecurity expected to increase.\n\nAfghanistan's long-term growth prospects rely on a significant shift from reliance on international aid and consumption-driven growth to a more resilient, private sector-led economy that capitalizes on the country's inherent strengths. For a sustainable future, Afghanistan needs to focus on its comparative advantages, particularly in the agricultural and extractive sectors. Agriculture could be a key driver of growth and poverty reduction, with the potential to create jobs. To realize this potential, strategic investments are needed in irrigation infrastructure, land tenure security, research, and market access to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience. These efforts should be supported by investments to strengthen human capital and create the institutional frameworks needed for a conducive business environment.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 18, 2024\n\nSince the events of August 2021, the World Bank has provided more than $1.7 billion in support to the Afghan people.\n\nThrough Approach 1.0, the World Bank provided $280 million in funds from the Afghanistan Resilience Trust Fund (ARTF) to UNICEF and the World Food Program. This was for humanitarian gap financing to meet emergency health and nutrition needs.\n\nThrough Approach 2.0, the World Bank and ARTF donors have been supporting the Afghan people since early 2022 with critical health, education, food security, livelihoods, and water services provided at scale nationwide.\n\nThrough Approach 3.0, the World Bank is now making IDA funds available to complement ARTF financing and to continue to support the people of Afghanistan with basic services. IDA grants will be provided directly to United Nations agencies and other public international organizations. The World Bank coordinates closely with other development partners who provide complementary financing to these critical activities.\n\nIn all cases, funds provided have remained outside the systems and control of the Interim Taliban Administration (ITA) and have focused on service delivery for women and girls.\n\nWhat Is Approach 3.0?\n\nIn February 2024, the World Bank’s Board of Directors endorsed Afghanistan “Approach 3.0”. Under this approach, grants from the International Development Association (IDA) will be provided to United Nations agencies and other public international organizations. These funds will continue supporting basic services nationwide, particularly those benefiting women, and will be outside the control of the Interim Taliban Administration (ITA).\n\nApproach 3.0 continues the “principled approach”—started under Approach 2.0—which puts women at the center of projects and ensures that project activities are implemented by and for women. The World Bank’s independent third-party monitoring agent will continue to verify all project activities.\n\nAs part of delivering basic services at scale, Approach 3.0 will support employment opportunities by bolstering income-generating activities, especially microfinance, by facilitating the participation of the private sector in delivery of aid.\n\nUnder Approach 3.0, the World Bank Group will continue to work with all multilateral and bilateral partners to ensure coordinated basic services aid for the Afghan people.\n\nIn addition, under Approach 3.0 project activities in Afghanistan will resume under the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000).\n\nCASA-1000 is a regional project to bring clean energy from Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic to Pakistan via Afghanistan. Construction in the other three countries is nearly complete and these countries have requested that CASA-1000 activities in Afghanistan resume to avoid the risk of the project becoming a stranded asset. Project activities in Afghanistan will resume in a ring-fenced manner to ensure all construction payments and future revenue are managed outside of Afghanistan and do not involve ITA systems.\n\nWhat Is Approach 2.0?\n\nApproach 2.0 as approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors on March 1, 2022, based on the decision of the Afghanistan Resilience Trust Fund (ARTF) donors and the international community to support the people of Afghanistan. The approach is guiding the provision of more than $1.3 billion in funds from the ARTF as recipient-executed grants to select United Nations agencies and international NGOs. This approach aims to support the delivery of essential basic services, protect vulnerable Afghans, and help reduce the need for humanitarian assistance in the future. These projects support the delivery of health and education services, food security, water, and community livelihoods.\n\nLast Updated: Apr 23, 2024"
