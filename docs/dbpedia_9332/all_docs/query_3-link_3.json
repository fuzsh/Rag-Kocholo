Other denominations issued included the shahi of 5 paisa, the sanar of 10 paisa, the abbasi of 20 paisa, the qiran of 1⁄2 rupee and the tilla and later the amani, both of Rs. 10/-.\n\nBefore 1891, silver rupees circulated with copper falus and gold mohur. The three metals had no fixed exchange rate between them, with different regions issuing their own coins. That year, a new currency was introduced, based on the Kabuli rupee and replacing both that and its Kandahari variant. The Afghan rupee was replaced in 1923 by the Afghani.[1][3]\n\nThe Afghan rupee was put into circulation by Afghan Emperor Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1754.[2] The rupee itself was first issued by Sher Shah Suri during his rule of Sur Empire in the sixteenth century; India still uses its own variant of the rupee (along with Pakistan - see Pakistani rupee - since its creation in 1947).\n\nBanknotes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1919 following Amanullah Khan's accession to the throne, Treasury notes were introduced for the first time in denominations of Re. 1/-, Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/-, Rs. 50/- and Rs. 100/-. Text on the note was written in Persian only.[4][5]\n\nCoins\n\n[edit]\n\n1 rupee coin\n\n2 Amani gold coin (1920)\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nAfghan afghani\n\nAfghan pul\n\nEconomy of Afghanistan\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
