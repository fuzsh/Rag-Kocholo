        "text": "KABUL, (Aug 6, 2024) - Extreme weather events forced at least 38,000 people from their homes in Afghanistan in the first six months of this year – of whom about half are children – which is more than in the whole of 2023, said Save the Children.\n\nAnalysis of data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) found more displacements in the first half of this year due to droughts, extreme temperatures, floods, landslides, avalanches, and storms than in all of 2023 (37,076). [1]\n\nWhile IDMC does not provide child-specific breakdowns for displacements that happen within a given year, it does state that half of the people driven from their homes in Afghanistan are children.[2] Afghanistan also had the highest number of children made homeless by climate disasters of any country in the world as of the end of 2023 (747,094).[3]\n\nWhile most displacements in recent decades have been due to conflict, in 2022, climate disasters became the main reason people fled their homes and moved to other areas within Afghanistan. According to the UN, drought was the main reason for disaster-driven displacement. One out of every seven Afghans is facing long-term displacement, the largest number in South Asia and the second highest in the world.[4]\n\nAfghanistan is the sixth most vulnerable country to the impacts of climate change [5] but also one of the least able to adapt and cope with the crisis. More than one in three people in Afghanistan are facing crisis levels of hunger, driven mostly by climate shocks and high food prices. Twenty-five of Afghanistan's 34 provinces face severe or catastrophic drought conditions, which affect more than half the population, according to the UN.\n\nKandahar province in the south has been severely affected by drought, leading people to move to other areas after hundreds of wells and other water sources dried up. In one village where Save the Children has been working, around half of all families left their homes due to a drastic reduction in clean water, with the remaining families forced to seek work in other districts.\n\nChildren walked for hours to fetch water from a waterhole, which was also used by animals, leading to outbreaks of disease.\n\nRaouf*, 13, lives with his family of six in an area plagued by frequent droughts. Like many others, his village faces severe water shortages, forcing Raouf and his friends to make multiple trips daily to a reservoir about 300 meters away for water. This often makes them late for school.\n\nSave the Children has constructed a new water system in the village using deep boreholes and solar panels, and families have started to return to their abandoned houses. This means children no longer have to spend large parts of their day fetching water.\n\nRaouf said:\n\n\"Animals drank from the same water that we used to consume. By the time we brought it back, it would become warm, and that water caused us to become ill.\n\n\"I'm very pleased with the new water tanker system. Before, we had to fetch water by hand in gallons from distant places, and the water quality was poor. Now, we have clean drinking water that doesn't make us ill.\"\n\nStudies repeatedly show that climate disasters disproportionately impact girls and women compared to men, particularly those in vulnerable circumstances. A 2019 UNDP report revealed that globally, at least 60% of deaths from extreme climate events over the past 20 years were women and girls.[8]\n\nArshad Malik, Country Director of Save the Children in Afghanistan, said:\n\n\"The climate crisis is fueling the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. It is forcing people from their homes, destroying water sources, and preventing children from going to school. It is changing children's lives. Compared to 60-year-olds, newborns in Afghanistan will confront 5.3 times more drought in their lifetimes.[7]\n\n\"Afghanistan is seeing extreme weather events with alarming frequency. This year alone, thousands of people have been displaced not only by drought but also by floods. The climate crisis is destroying Afghan lives and livelihoods.\n\n\"Adapting to and preparing for the impacts of climate change needs to be a priority, even at a time when funding is massively stretched. It's been three years since direct international aid, equivalent to 40% of the GDP and financed up to 80% of public expenditure,[9] was reduced after the de facto authorities regained control. Three years since the country saw a massive drop in assistance. Humanitarian agencies cannot be expected to plug this gap alone.\"\n\nSave the Children has been supporting communities and protecting children's rights across Afghanistan since 1976, including during periods of conflict and natural disasters.\n\nOur response to the floods in Baghlan reached 25,190 people, including 13,670 children. Save the Children has programs in nine provinces in Afghanistan and works with partners in an additional seven provinces.\n\n###"
