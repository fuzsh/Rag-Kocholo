        "text": "Afghan Afghani - AFN\n\nOverview\n\nThe Afghan Afghani (AFN) was introduced in 2003 as the new currency for Afghanistan. Two distinct rates were established: the government issue of 1000 and the northern alliance of 2000. Prior to 2003 the currency was the Afghanistan Afghani (AFA). There is no stock market. Money lending as well as foreign exchange is done through money bazaars.\n\nEconomy\n\nAfghanistan relies on foreign aid, trade, and farming from bordering countries.\n\nThe country and international concerns are focusing on improving infrastructure by creating jobs, promoting development of housing, and investing in education.\n\nInternational groups contributed over $2 billion to help Afghanistan&#8217;s dying economy.\n\nAfghanistan's agricultural products include wheat, wool, nuts, mutton, opium, lamb skin, and sheep skin.\n\nAfghanistan exports mainly nuts, fruit, carpets, and cotton.\n\nImports include textiles, petroleum products, and capital goods.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Afghani (AFA) was introduced in 1925. Before this time period the Afghan Rupee was the official currency.\n\nFrom the year 1925 to the year 1928 Afghani treasury notes were introduced.\n\nIn 1975, all Afghanistan banks were nationalized.\n\nIn 1981, the Afghani was pegged to the United States Dollar at 1 USD = 50 Afghanis.\n\nAfghanistan was taken over by Taliban rulers in 1996. The Taliban central bank declared the Afghanistan Afghani worthless and the bank cancelled the contract they had with Russia for printing their money. The country's currency was devalued against the US dollar to a rate of 1 USD = 43 Afghani.\n\nIn 2002, the new Afghan Afghani currency (AFN) was introduced. In October, 2003 Afghanistan started using AFN as the official currency in local trade.\n\nIn 2005, Afghani coins replaced the 1, 2, and 5 Afghani banknotes.\n\nSince 2005 the Afghanistan economy has grown at a steady pace.\n\nGeneral Information"
