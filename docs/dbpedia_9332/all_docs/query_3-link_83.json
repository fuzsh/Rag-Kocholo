        "text": "Media freedom is severely restricted under the Taliban. Media outlets are subject to intrusive monitoring and guidance by multiple Taliban organs, which are reinforced through threats and violence. The Afghan media sector has also suffered from the loss of state patronage, donor funding, and private-sector revenue. Many Afghan journalists have fled for other countries in the region and have sought asylum in European countries and the United States since the republic’s fall.\n\nIn addition to national-level restrictions, during 2023 the Taliban launched sporadic operations against media in the provinces. For example, in August, they raided and sealed the premises of Hamisha Bahar radio and television station in Nangarhar Province, blocking local groups’ use of its radio transmitter.\n\nAccording to an August 2023 report released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), since August 2021, two-thirds of Afghanistan’s 12,000 journalists have been forced out of their profession, including 80 percent of its women journalists. More than half of the 547 media outlets that were registered before the Taliban’s takeover have now closed. By April 2023, women journalists had ceased working in 19 of the 34 provinces.\n\nThe IEA has introduced at least three sets of guidelines for the media, though the guidelines were not publicly shared. Among other things, these guidelines instruct outlets and journalists to show respect for Islam, desist from reporting news items considered false, refrain from publishing information the regime has not confirmed, and operate within cultural norms. Entertainment programming that is believed to violate social and cultural norms is banned. At least three Taliban organs have actively enforced these restrictions: the Ministry of Information and Culture, the Ministry of Vice and Virtue (MVV), and the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI). In practice, authorities have exercised arbitrary control over the media, including through prepublication censorship.\n\nOne journalist was killed in 2023 in Afghanistan, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Dozens experienced arbitrary arrest, and 108 incidents of violence against journalists were recorded by Nai, an Afghan media watchdog group. Many other media workers were subject to threats and harassment, primarily from the GDI. Pressure has mainly been directed towards ensuring favorable coverage of the regime, stifling criticism, and reducing coverage of opponents and critics. Self-censorship is pervasive as a result.\n\nEstablished outlets now operate from abroad, and new outlets focused on Afghanistan have been formed outside the country since the IEA was established. All rely on social media to share their output. The Taliban have increased their own social-media activity and have warned people against accessing critical posts. Nevertheless, social media remains uncensored and accessible to Afghans.\n\nScore Change: The score decreased from 1 to 0 due to the mass exodus of journalists since the imposition of Taliban rule, and harsh new restrictions on those who remain.\n\nReligious freedom, which was already hampered by violence and discrimination under the republic, has been heavily curtailed by the Taliban, who vigorously assert their interpretation of the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam.\n\nDuring 2023, the MVV deployed teams in all provinces to enforce its moral code, although in practice enforcement efforts were ad hoc and varied significantly from province to province. Elements of the moral code included male attendance at congregational prayers, closure of businesses at prayer time, holding Koranic recitation instead of music and dance at weddings, refraining from listening to music, approved beard and hair styles for men, and dress codes for both men and women. Non-Muslim minorities reported that they were warned to comply with MVV codes for Muslim dress.\n\nGovernment organs, particularly the GDI, have systematically persecuted religious minorities. Adherents of Salafism have been especially targeted, with members facing arbitrary detention, forced disappearance, torture, and summary execution by the Taliban, who as a pretext often accuse them of supporting the ISKP. Many of their religious institutions have been sealed and their imams have been instructed to conform with Hanafi doctrine. Christians, who are few in number, also face arrest and violence.\n\nThe regime claims not to persecute members of the Hazara community, most of whom identify as Shiite. However, the emirate authorities imposed multiple restrictions on the 2023 commemoration of the month of mourning, Muharram. Mourners were told to avoid public displays of religious symbols and rituals, and mourning ceremonies were only to be held in select places of worship designated by the Taliban. Shias widely defied these restrictions, resulting in clashes with the authorities.\n\nISKP has continued its campaign of violence against the Hazara community. Mass casualty attacks against Hazaras included improvised explosive devices (IEDs) at a Shia mosque in Pol-e-Khomri in October 2023, at a west Kabul sports club the same month, and a commuter bus in west Kabul in November.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 1 to 0 due to the Taliban regime’s intensifying efforts to enforce conformity to its interpretation of Sunni Islam.\n\nNGOs are required to be registered with the Ministry of Economy, comply with its reporting guidelines, and observe emirate rules. The emirate has relied on a restrictive interpretation of previous NGO registration rules to prevent the operations of NGOs deemed critical or undesirable. NGOs are also subject to surveillance by the GDI, which has periodically accused groups of espionage. Human rights activists have been arrested, tortured, and killed since the Taliban returned to power, and many involved in human rights work have fled. By 2023, civil society activity had mostly been reduced to the delivery of humanitarian assistance, and even these groups face pressure from the Taliban to prioritize their members and supporters when distributing aid.\n\nIn December 2022, the Ministry of Economy, with which NGOs must register, told groups not to allow female employees to report for work and threatened to revoke registration for noncompliance. Several aid groups, including the Norwegian Refugee Council and Save the Children, suspended their operations as a result. In April 2023, the Taliban extended their ban on women working in international NGOs to the United Nations, resulting in most Afghan women employed by the UN having to stay away from work. GDI agents arrested the staff of an International Assistance Mission (IAM) project in September 2023, accusing them of proselytizing.\n\nThe Taliban have claimed restoration of security as one of their main achievements. All major indicators of levels of violence have reduced relative to the period prior to August 2021, when the Taliban were waging an insurgency. The South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP) noted 500 terrorism-related deaths in 2023, a significant reduction from the Taliban’s first year in power (1,653), and a different order of magnitude to the fatality levels during the insurgency (8,469 in 2021).\n\nDespite the marked reduction in terrorist violence and casualties, the Afghan population faces multiple threats of illegal physical force and the effects of war and insurgency.\n\nThrough multiple counterterrorism operations, the Taliban succeeded in reducing the capabilities of ISKP, which had constituted the main terrorist threat to the emirate in 2022. ISKP violence has continued, but at a diminished level. It claimed responsibility for high-profile attacks on Taliban leaders, including the killings in suicide attacks of the governor of Balkh Province, the deputy governor of Badakshhan, and the former police chief of Baghlan. Although overall casualties from their suicide campaign fell relative to 2022, ISKP conducted further attacks on civilians of the Hazara community in Kabul and Mazar-e-Sharif in Baghlan.\n\nNationalist resistance forces waging an armed campaign against the emirate changed tactics in 2023. Instead of trying to hold territory, they shifted to hit-and-run attacks with IEDs and small arms on Taliban security posts and vehicles. In addition to the NRF, led by Ahmad Massoud, several other resistance groupings announced that they were fighting against the Taliban and started to claim responsibility for attacks. However, the volume of attacks was not sufficient to alter the national trend towards diminished violence.\n\nIn addition to political violence, significant levels of violent crime, including kidnappings and armed robberies, were reported from many parts of the country. Perpetrators enjoyed impunity and were widely assumed to be Taliban or their supporters.\n\nUXO (unexploded ordnance), left over from the insurgency and previous phases of conflict, continued to be a source of casualties.\n\nAfghanistan also continued to play host to Islamist militant groups, among them, the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), which used their presence along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to stage attacks into Pakistan.\n\nWhile the regime claimed it was observing an amnesty announced in 2021, the GDI continued a selective purge of former members of the republic’s security forces, who were targeted by night raids on their houses, arbitrary arrests, and summary execution. Particularly vulnerable were former personnel in areas where resistance groups were believed to be active, those who had commanded Afghan Local Police (ALP), and personnel who were deported back to the country after fleeing to Iran.\n\nUN monitoring indicated that 274 men, 58 women, and 2 boys, convicted of crimes such as “illicit relations” and theft, were publicly flogged between November 2022 and May 2023.\n\nThe IEA operates without a unified civil or criminal code. There is no clarity on which republic-era laws still apply.\n\nWomen face profound discrimination under the Taliban. Their employment opportunities have been severely curtailed; many women have been dismissed from public-sector and media-sector jobs. Restrictions on movement also impact women’s employment prospects, with the MVV working to enforce a ban on women using public transport unaccompanied. On December 31, 2023, MVV enforcers launched a renewed campaign against women, targeting Tajik- and Hazara-populated areas of Kabul. Young women were rounded up from streets and bazaars, accused of minor violations of dress code and detained for varying periods in MVV compounds until bailed out by their parents. The regime has also restricted girls’ and women’s access to education. In March 2022, it officially closed secondary schools for girls and in December 2022 banned female students from higher education. Despite global expressions of concern, the Taliban retained their restrictions on female education through 2023. No women were allowed to take the Kankor, or annual university entrance examination, in 2023.\n\nThe Taliban have engaged in discrimination against members of ethnic minority groups, particularly Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks.\n\nThere is no legal protection for LGBT+ people, who face societal disapproval and discrimination from the Taliban. The United Nations notes that the authorities have reportedly detained transgender Afghans, that and gay, bisexual, and transgender men face a heightened risk of violence.\n\nThe Taliban ended the limited formal protections from domestic violence offered by the republic. Shelters for survivors of gender-based violence were closed by the Taliban and individuals who were convicted of such violence were among those released by the Taliban during their 2021 takeover.\n\nThe MVV has restricted the social freedoms of Afghans. Women are obliged to adopt Islamic dress as defined by the regime. Men, especially civil servants, were ordered to grow full beards and avoid Westernized hairstyles or dress. Enforcement is arbitrary and inconsistent, varying over time and between provinces.\n\nCustomary practices, including child marriage, the forced marriage of young girls to older men, and of widows to their husbands’ male relatives, continue to restrict women’s choices regarding marriage and divorce."
