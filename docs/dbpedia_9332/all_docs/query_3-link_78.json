        "text": "The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Redesigned Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry, referred to as the “AHOBPR 2.0,\" is a critical tool that is advancing research through combining Veteran and service member data. AHOBPR 2.0 enables VA to identify and research health challenges of Veterans and service members who were exposed to airborne hazards and burn pits during their military service. Over time, the knowledge gained through this research and operations initiative will be used to fuel advancements in treatments, more precise predictive medicine, inform decisions related to presumptive conditions, and deliver targeted proactive and preventative care.\n\nWhile inclusion in AHOBPR 2.0 does not impact an individual’s care or benefits, Veterans and service members who participate are helping to improve the care and benefits for generations of Veterans and service members to come.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, the VA and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) announced critical updates to this Registry including: the broadening of participation criteria; clear opt-out procedures; and automatic enrollment procedures based on DoD records that vastly expand the number of participating Veterans and service members.\n\nABOUT AHOBPR 2.0\n\nWhen and why was the original Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry formed?\n\nIn 2014 at the direction of Congress, VA established the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry to fuel clinical research to advance treatments, enable more precise predictive medicine, and ensure proactive care and benefits for Veterans and service members exposed to hazardous toxins while serving.\n\nTo learn more about VA’s efforts to combat airborne hazards and burn pit exposures, you can visit the Health Outcomes Military Exposures website at Airborne Hazards and Burn Pit Exposures - Public Health (va.gov)\n\nWhy did VA redesign the Registry?\n\nVA is always evaluating ways to improve programs, care, and benefits for Veterans. After seeking extensive feedback from Veterans and service members, it was clear that the burden of entry to participate in the program was too great. This redesign addresses these challenges by broadening participation criteria, simplifying opt-out processes, and automatically enrolling eligible Veterans and service members based on DoD records.\n\nWhat do I need to do if I was enrolled prior to the redesign of the Registry?\n\nNo action is required for Veterans and service members who were enrolled prior to the redesign and want to continue participating. Your enrollment has automatically carried over to AHOBPR 2.0.\n\nIf you no longer wish to participate and want to opt out of AHOBPR 2.0, please complete this online form.\n\nELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT\n\nWhat are the participation criteria for AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nVeterans and service members (living or deceased) who meet the following criteria -- per DoD records - will be automatically enrolled:\n\nOperations and Campaigns: Desert Shield and Desert Storm (ODS/S); Iraqi Freedom (OIF); Enduring Freedom (OEF); and New Dawn (OND)\n\nIraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Djibouti, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, waters of the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Syria, Uzbekistan, and Egypt between August 2, 1990, and August 31, 2021\n\nSomalia between August 2, 1990, and August 31, 2021\n\nThe Southwest Asia theater of military operations and Egypt between August 2, 1990, and August 31, 2021\n\nAfghanistan, Djibouti, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Uzbekistan, or Yemen any time between September 11, 2001, and August 31, 2021\n\nAssociated airspaces with the countries listed above, as well as the waters of the Persian Gulf, Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, and the Red Sea between August 2, 1990, and August 31, 2021\n\n×\n\nDo I need to have been exposed to specific airborne hazards or have related health concerns to participate in the Registry?\n\nNo -- you do not need to have been knowingly exposed to specific airborne hazards or have related health concerns to be included in AHOBPR 2.0. This is because our understanding of what counts as a toxic exposure continues to evolve. In fact, participation of Veterans and service members who have no known exposures at the time of enrollment in the Registry may help us later identify new exposures through trends.\n\nHow do I confirm whether I am enrolled in AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nIf your military record includes deployment to an eligible theater of operation or location for specific time periods, you should already be enrolled in the registry.\n\nVeterans can check their status by contacting their local Environmental Health Coordinator. Active-duty service members can check their status at https://vethome.va.gov/inquiry by submitting an inquiry with the topic ‘Registry Eligibility.’\n\nWhat if I deployed to an eligible area, but my name is not listed in AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nVA relies on DoD records to determine which Veterans and service members deployed to an eligible area or military campaign. We understand sometimes there are information gaps due to large data transfers or the classified nature of your duties. You may request a manual eligibility review by submitting a request here: https://vethome.va.gov/inquiry.\n\nForm Instructions:\n\nUnder “Topic”, select “Registry Eligibility”\n\nUnder “Additional Detail” provide a short paragraph stating your concern or questions and include dates of military service and deployment information related to eligibility criteria\n\nComplete all required form information\n\nWhat do I need to do if I was enrolled prior to the redesign of the Registry?\n\nThere is no action for Veterans and service members who were enrolled prior to the redesign and want to continue participating. Your enrollment has automatically carried over to AHOBPR 2.0.\n\nWhat if I want to opt out of AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nParticipation in the Registry is optional and has no impact on, nor will it determine eligibility for VA health care and benefits. Those who wish to opt out can complete this online form.\n\nIf I opt out now, can I choose to opt in later?\n\nVeterans and service members who initially opted out of the Registry can rejoin by submitting a request here: https://vethome.va.gov/inquiry.\n\nParticipation\n\nWhy should I participate in AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nVeteran and service members’ participation in the Registry is critical, enabling VA to identify and research health challenges of Veterans and service members who were exposed to airborne hazards and burn pits during their military service.\n\nOver time, the knowledge gained through this research will be used to fuel advancements in treatments, more precise predictive medicine, and targeted proactive care. Veterans and service members from this generation who participate are helping improve the care and benefits for generations of Veterans and service members to come.\n\nEven if you have not experienced any symptoms or illnesses that you believe are related to exposures during military service, your participation in AHOBPR 2.0 could help VA provide better care to all Veterans and service members.\n\nWhat is required for participation?\n\nThere are no additional requirements for participation in the Registry. Veterans and service members can stay informed about ongoing research by visiting www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/burnpits.\n\nRemember that participation is completely optional.\n\nWhat specific data is DoD and VA sharing with AHOBPR 2.0?\n\nThe deidentified data pulled from DoD for eligible Veterans and service members, both living and deceased, includes deployment locations, military personnel information, and demographics to include gender, race, ethnicity etc. No medical information will be shared or stored in the Registry.\n\nWho can access my data from AHOBPR 2.0, and how will it be used?\n\nVeteran and service member data will be accessible to select VA epidemiologists and researchers, and institutional review board-approved researchers. It will be used to conduct medical research on the cohort over a period of time. The results will inform the policy decision-making efforts of VA senior leaders, including those related to presumptive conditions.\n\nWhat if I still have questions?\n\nPlease contact your local VAMC Environmental Health Coordinator. To locate a local coordinator, please review the listing of VAMC coordinators at https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/coordinators.asp\n\nVA encourages all Veterans concerned about how their military service has impacted their health to talk to their health care provider, apply for VA health care, and file a claim for compensation and benefits.\n\nYou do not have to participate in AHOBPR 2.0 to receive compensation, benefits, or health care from VA.â¯\n\nService members can also visit DOD’s AHOBPR 2.0 website for more information."
