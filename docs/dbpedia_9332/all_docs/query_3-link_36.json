        "text": "The largest bank in the country, the Bank of Afghanistan, became the centre of the formal banking system. It formerly played an important role in determining and implementing the country’s financial policies. Traditionally, private money traders provide nearly all the services of a commercial bank. The currency, the afghani, underwent rampant inflation beginning in the 1990s, and as a result precious metals and gems became a common form of currency for large transactions. A sanction imposed in 1999 by the United Nations (UN) against the Taliban government froze government accounts abroad and closed the few branches of Afghan banks outside the country. Despite these measures, the Taliban and their al-Qaeda supporters (al-Qaeda is an Islamic extremist group that found refuge under the Taliban) removed large quantities of bullion and currency from Afghanistan during the U.S. military campaign of 2001, virtually bankrupting the country.\n\nAudio File: National anthem of Afghanistan\n\nHead Of State And Government:\n\nPresident: Ashraf Ghani; de facto leader Hibatullah Akhundzada4\n\nPopulation:\n\n(2024 est.) 35,581,000\n\nForm Of Government:\n\nIslamic republic1 with two legislative houses (House of Elders [1022]; House of the People [2503]); de facto transitional government4\n\nOfficial Languages:\n\nDari; Pashto5\n\nAfghanistan’s financial sector expanded rapidly in the decade that followed the fall of the Taliban. However, the banking system has been plagued by corruption and fraud.\n\nLabour and taxation\n\nThe bulk of the population in the rural areas consists of small farmers exploiting their tiny plots of land. The majority of the city and town dwellers are artisans, small traders, or government employees. The industrial labour force, always small, is now hardly visible, and labour unions have failed to develop. Traditional loyalties to families and tribes are stronger than those to workers’ organizations.\n\nThe Afghan government has traditionally received much of its revenue from foreign aid—particularly during the Soviet era—and as a consequence the Afghan people have generally been lightly taxed. Taxation during the mujahideen and Taliban period often took the form of levies placed on the illicit cross-border trade between Pakistan and other countries, on cultivating opium poppies and manufacturing heroin, and on extracting and exporting semiprecious stones. Following the defeat of the Taliban in 2001, the interim government and subsequent administrations relied largely on foreign aid and subsidies from donor nations.\n\nTransportation and telecommunications\n\nBeing a landlocked country, Afghanistan depends primarily on transit facilities from its neighbours for its international trade. It lacks railways, has few navigable rivers, and relies on roads as the mainstay of its transport system. These factors drive up transportation costs and also add to the difficulty of integrating the transport system of the country with those of its neighbours. Nevertheless, in the 1960s major efforts were directed toward upgrading the highway system and connecting the main trading centres of the country with one another, as well as with the railheads or road networks of neighbouring countries.\n\nThe road network of Afghanistan connects railheads in Gushgy, Turkmenistan, and Termiz, Uzbekistan, with those at Chaman and Peshawar, Pakistan, respectively, and provides for direct overland transit between the countries to the north and the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent. The most important Afghan highways are those connecting Kabul with Shīr Khān, on the northern border, and with Peshawar. Other paved roads link Kandahār, Herāt, and Mazār-e Sharīf with Kabul and with frontier towns of Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. During the civil war, however, the road system was severely damaged from the fighting and from disrepair. Its rehabilitation has become a high priority in any program of national reconstruction.\n\nDespite the rapid development of motor transport, camels and donkeys are still commonly used as draft animals. In the countryside many people have not abandoned their cherished horses, which are an important source of prestige.\n\nAlmost all provincial centres have at least a seasonally operable airport. There are international airports at Kabul and Kandahār. Afghanistan, however, has limited air service and only one airline, the national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines. UN restrictions imposed in 1999 and again in 2001, aimed at punishing the Taliban government for its alleged support of international terrorism, limited international routes for Ariana and prohibited other airlines from scheduling flights into the country. Some international flights to Kabul have resumed since the fall of the Taliban in 2001.\n\nAfghanistan’s communications infrastructure is one of the least developed in the world. Telephone service is sparse, with only one main telephone line per thousand persons. Cellular telephone and Internet use increased rapidly in the first decade of the 21st century. Radio receivers are fairly pervasive, with roughly one radio receiver per 10 people. Afghans who have access to shortwave radio listen to local channels and to international broadcasts, including the Voice of America’s Dari and Pashto programs and the BBC Pashto Service. Access to television has increased since the fall of the Taliban in 2001; broadcasts by dozens of Afghan television stations can now be viewed throughout the country. Many Afghans have satellite dishes and are able to receive foreign broadcasts.\n\nConstitutional framework\n\nUntil the mid 20th century, Afghanistan was ruled by the absolute power of the king. Two constitutions were promulgated, in 1923 and 1931, both affirming the power of the monarchy. The constitution of 1964, however, provided for a constitutional monarchy based on the separation of executive, legislative, and judicial authorities. A military coup in 1973 overthrew the monarchy, abolished the constitution of 1964, and established the Republic of Afghanistan. The Grand Assembly (Loya Jirga) adopted a new constitution in February 1977, but it was abrogated in 1978 when another coup established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, governed by the Afghan Revolutionary Council. Political turmoil continued, marked by a third coup in September 1979, a massive invasion of troops from the Soviet Union, and the installation of a socialist government in December 1979. Another new constitution—promulgated in 1987 and revised in 1990—changed the name of the country back to the Republic of Afghanistan, reaffirmed its nonaligned status, strengthened the post of president, and permitted other parties to participate in government. The communist regime, which had managed to hold power after the Soviet forces departed early in 1989, fell in 1992, and a coalition of victorious mujahideen parties formed a government (recognized by the UN) and named the country the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The new government was driven from the capital in 1996 by a movement based in Kandahār and calling itself the Taliban. The Taliban leaders promptly changed the name of the country to the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Espousing the supremacy of Islamic law, the Taliban did not promulgate a new constitution. In December 2001 the Taliban was toppled by a coalition of Afghan parties supported by the United States. In January 2004 a new constitution was ratified, providing for a directly elected president with two vice presidents. It also provides for a bicameral National Assembly with a directly elected lower house and an upper house comprising appointees from local and provincial councils as well as presidential appointees. The constitution establishes Islam as the state religion and prohibits laws that contradict the tenets of Islam. It also includes provisions guaranteeing gender equality and the rights of religious minorities.\n\nMany Afghans continue to believe that “the highest manifestation of the will of the people of Afghanistan” is vested in the institution of the Loya Jirga. As a specially convened national assembly, it has traditionally held the power to amend and interpret the constitution, declare war, and adopt decisions on the most critical national issues. Loya Jirgas have played an important role in Afghan politics since the fall of the Taliban, convening in 2002 to establish a transitional government and in 2003 to ratify a new constitution. Because the Loya Jirga is closely associated with the rule of monarchy, it is revered most by those Afghans, especially in the dominant Pashtun community, who seek a more ethnically representative government than was initially installed following the Taliban’s overthrow."
