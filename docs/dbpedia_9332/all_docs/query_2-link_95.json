In such a case, prior to confiscation, the State shall pay the just compensation for said investment on the basis of the prevailing market price or on the basis of an assessment of an internationally respected firm.\n\nArticle 24\n\nPrivate investors may transfer any funds received from the Government as a result of confiscation out of Afghanistan without the payment of taxes.\n\nShould the affected enterprises have any complaints, they have the right to approach the High Commission, which may adopt the appropriate measures for resolution of their grievances.\n\nSectors not covered by this law\n\nArticle 25\n\nInvestments in construction of pipelines, telecommunications infrastructure, oil and gas, mines and minerals, and heavy industries are exempt from provisions of this legislation.\n\nInvestment in these sectors shall be regulated under separate legislation.\n\nDispute resolution\n\nArticle 26\n\nDisputes between foreign and domestic investors versus the Office of Investment and government officials may be directly resolved in an amicable manner by understanding and observing the rules of this legislation and documentation of the Enterprise, including whatever specialized contracts have been signed and agreed upon.\n\nShould the disputes not be resolved in this manner, the parties shall settle their dispute according to the provisions of the Washington Arbitration Regulations of March 18, 1965 or in accordance with the United Nation’s Judiciary Laws for International Commerce.\n\nArticle 27\n\nThe decision based on theses international agreements for dispute settlement and/or their rendered judgments shall be final and both parties are obliged to accept such a final decision.\n\nArticle 28\n\nUpon execution of this law, the Office of Investment created within the framework of Investment Legislation dated 8/2/1422 H.Q. is considered abolished.
