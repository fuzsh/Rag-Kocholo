        "text": "The Afghan people continue to grapple with the consequences of four decades of conflict, with entrenched poverty further exacerbated by an economic crisis, frequent environmental disasters and the impact of a worsening climate crisis, and gender inequality.\n\nFollowing peak hunger levels in 2021 and 2022, food security in Afghanistan has marginally improved, largely thanks to massive food and nutrition assistance that supported up to half the Afghan people. Nevertheless, more than a quarter of the Afghan population are still going hungry, including 2.4 million people facing emergency levels of food insecurity. These figures sadly keep the country squarely amongst other severe global hunger crises.\n\nIncreasingly erratic weather patterns are becoming the norm. Devastating flash floods across the country followed years of drought conditions that forced families to go hungry and leave their villages â€“ swelling the number of urban poor. As the climate crisis worsens, the losses from flooding are expected to increase every year.\n\nPresent in Afghanistan since 1963, the World Food Programme works with partners to reach the most vulnerable communities in need of assistance across the country, in line with humanitarian principles."
