        "text": "Box 5.1.\n\nIntroducing the New Currency\n\nThe introduction of the new currency was a difficult task. Afghanistan is a rugged country slightly larger than France, with a population of about 22 million, that had been ravaged by over 20 years of armed conflict. Roads were in a very poor condition, there was little or no secure ground transportation between major cities, and there was a lack of communication facilities. To reach all holders of the old currency within a limited period of time posed enormous logistical challenges. To address these vast challenges, a steering committee was formed, which comprised senior officials from the central bank and the Ministry of Finance (MoF), and was assisted by international experts from the IMF, USAID, the Bundesbank, and the UN. Planning for the exchange started in earnest in the early summer of 2002 with the formation of a task force, comprising mainly senior officials from the central bank and several international advisors.\n\nThe first stages included the ordering, printing, and delivery of the new banknotes. DAB contracted the printing of the new currency in denominations of Af 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 to two reputable banknote printers, building upon the work that had already been done for the Taliban regime. The new notes included several advanced security features to deter future counterfeiting. It was difficult to determine how many new banknotes would be needed. The authorities only had a crude estimate of the existing number of old notes in circulation. Including the various counterfeits, the face value of the old Afghanis in circulation was initially estimated at about Af 16 trillion. For political reasons, it was decided that two types of unofficial notes would be eligible for conversion, but at a 50 percent discount (close to the actual discount at which these counterfeits traded in the Kabul money market). Taking this discount into account, the total value of old Afghanis to be exchanged was estimated at about Af 13 trillion. The authorities realized, however, that running out of new banknotes before all old ones would be converted would fatally undermine the public’s confidence in the new currency. Because of this, and to be able to accommodate an increase in money demand at least in the first year following the new currency’s introduction, the authorities ordered a total value of the new notes of Af 27.9 billion (with 1 new Afghani replacing 1,000 old ones), equivalent to almost 800 million notes or about 500 tons. The first deliveries were received in August 2002 and the last shipments arrived in January 2003. The five smallest denominations make up almost 90 percent of the total volume of notes ordered, but only 15 percent of the total value (see the figure).\n\nThe first problem to overcome was the extremely poor condition of DAB’s regional facilities. DAB had 89 branches, but most of them did not meet even the most basic requirements in terms of secure vaults and office space. With assistance from international donors, DAB urgently set out to refurbish or construct a minimum of one currency distribution facility in each province. The country was divided into seven regions, each the responsibility of an area manager. In addition to Kabul, the regions were Kunduz, Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, Jalalabad, and Gardez. Each region had a number of exchange points, depending on estimates of population size and levels of economic activity. All in all, 47 exchange points were established where the public could exchange their old notes for new ones. An exchange point consisted of one to five units, with each unit having seven windows: five windows to take in the old currency and two to give out the new currency. With communication still difficult, the success of the whole program depended significantly on the work of the area managers and exchange point managers, who often had to act on their own to deal with problems in their regions. Some 2,500 local staff were selected to carry out the operation. Staff were selected from the most experienced and skilled personnel in the banking sector. In order to motivate staff and to establish reliable operations, staff were paid considerably more than the $30-$40 a month that a bank employee would normally earn. In addition, the UN and USAID provided international observers to oversee the process, notably the destruction of old notes.\n\nTransportation was another obstacle to tackle. The 500 tons of new currency had to be delivered to exchange points throughout the country, with almost half of this to be transported to the provinces. Ground transport for the more distant locations was ruled out for security reasons. Air transport was seen as the best approach, but the facilities available were very limited. The bulk of the need for air transport was met by two helicopters and one airplane, an Antonov 32, provided by USAID, who also set up an air operations unit that handled the scheduling and coordination of flights (all flights required clearance from the regional military air command and a two-day advance notification). The Afghan Air Force provided some assistance, particularly in the early stages of the conversion period, when difficulties in obtaining aircraft and crews that were willing to operate in Afghanistan led to delays in the arrival of the helicopters and the airplane.\n\nAdequate security was yet another requirement, with security needed at all stages: from the delivery of the new currency to the destruction of the old currency. The government, together with DAB, provided all the security during the currency conversion process. The governor and deputy governors of DAB visited the governors and local commanders in the provinces to ensure their cooperation. It is notable that there were no major security problems or serious violations of procedures during the entire three-month exchange period.\n\nThe introduction of the new currency was made public on September 4, 2002, by President Karzai. This was followed by a broad public information campaign to ensure that most, if not all, Afghans would be aware of the conversion. With large parts of the population being illiterate and with hardly anyone owning a television, the campaign relied mainly on radio broadcasts and dissemination by word of mouth, through speeches, village meetings, and so on. Also, a large number of posters were distributed, depicting the new notes and specifying their main security features. The conversion process started on October 7, 2002, and was initially set to last two months, ending on December 4, 2002. The authorities opted for a relatively short changeover period to limit the risk of new counterfeit printing. A currency decree was issued to enable and regulate the implementation of the currency conversion.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of the exchange period, only the money changers would be allowed to exchange their old notes. This way DAB aimed to collect large volumes of old notes early on. In order to be able to handle the large volumes that were expected to be exchanged this way, a sampling procedure was agreed on with the money changers, whereby only 10 percent of the total amount presented was verified to make sure that the count was correct, the denominations were correct, and the notes were indeed eligible for exchange. If the sample count found, for example, 2 percent to be incorrect, this proportion would be discounted from the entire amount that a money changer was presenting.\n\nDemand from the general public to exchange their old banknotes was such, however, that the exchange was opened to the general public before the first two weeks were over. Thus, almost all of the exchange points in the major cities opened in the first two weeks. Many exchange points in the provinces had delays in opening, not only because of delays in the arrival of air transport but also because many exchange points were simply not yet operational until two to three weeks after their planned opening on October 21. In November, uncertainty grew among the general public about whether everyone would be able to convert their old notes into new ones on time. As a result, the exchange rate started to depreciate sharply. To ease these pressures, DAB announced in mid-November that the conversion period would be extended by one month to January 2, 2003. Following this announcement, the exchange rate quickly returned to levels close to those at the start of the exchange.\n\nIn the initial period, large denomination banknotes of 1,000, 500, 100, and 50 Afghanis dominated the exchange, reflecting the early and active role of money changers. This also meant that the weight of banknotes, relative to their value, was much less than in the last month of the exchange, when primarily low denomination banknotes (1, 2, 5, and 10 Afghanis) were exchanged. Old official notes worth Af 13.9 trillion were exchanged during the conversion process for new notes, plus Af 3.3 trillion in unofficial notes at a 50 percent discount. Thus, new notes worth Af 15.6 billion were issued in exchange. An additional Af 2 trillion in old official notes were absorbed through the foreign exchange auctions during the conversion period. All in all, some Af 19 trillion in old notes were collected, equivalent to some 5 billion banknotes or over 2,000 tons, almost 20 percent more than the estimated face value of banknotes based on the information received from the printing companies. This difference may reflect inaccurate or incomplete information received from the printers, “last-minute” printing of counterfeits, or round-tripping of old notes during the currency conversion process. To address the problem of round-tripping, initially old banknotes were to be invalidated, using punchers and drills, and to be subsequently destroyed, using shredders. However, this approach quickly proved to be ineffective because the arrival of equipment was delayed and, once it arrived, had a tendency to break down. The solution to the destruction problem was to use incineration as the principal method. Difficulties in transportation and security meant that the best approach was to incinerate the notes locally. The construction of ovens was relatively simple and inexpensive. Also, ovens did not require electricity, which was not available in many exchange points. A schedule was established for the weekly or two-weekly destruction of the old banknotes, with both international and national observers present to assure the integrity of the process. The exchange ended quietly on January 2, 2003.\n\nBox 5.2.\n\nWhat Is the Right Exchange Rate Level?\n\nSince the collapse of the Taliban regime there have been significant changes in Afghanistan’s economy, including its trading patterns. The exchange rate has meanwhile fluctuated widely. Is it possible to make a judgment about the appropriate “equilibrium” level of the exchange rate for the Afghani? The equilibrium real exchange rate (or nominal rate after adjusting for inflation differentials) would be the rate that would be consistent with a sustainable current account position, without the need for major changes in international reserves or shift in macro-economic policies.1\n\nInformation typically used to assess the appropriateness of the exchange rate level is notably lacking for Afghanistan. There is no sensible base year against which to compare the current level of the real exchange rate. There have been huge changes in the pattern and composition of trade in the past 20 years and consequently a base year during this period would not be relevant to Afghanistan’s current circumstances. Moreover, there is very little information available on indicators used to assess competitiveness, such as growth rates of export and import volumes; the pattern of trade, relative price, and wage costs vis-à-vis trading partners and competitor countries; and the level of foreign exchange reserves.\n\nA few partial indicators of international competitiveness are available. Most of Afghanistan’s own exports—that is, excluding re-exports—are to India and Pakistan. These and other countries in the region are likely to be Afghanistan’s competitors in its export markets (agriculture and light manufacturing). For imports, the major sources appear to be Pakistan, Korea, Japan, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and, since 2002, the United States; for the Islamic Republic of Iran and Pakistan, available import data possibly include goods in transit from other countries. Most of the imports are likely to be goods (e.g., cars, refrigerators, and televisions) that Afghanistan does not produce. Imports from neighboring countries, however, are more likely to compete with domestic substitutes, such as agricultural goods and construction materials. As regards competitiveness, in Pakistan, Afghanistan’s largest bilateral partner, civil servants in the lower grades are paid, including food and transport allowances, the equivalent of about $38 a month compared with $35 in Afghanistan. However, compared with Pakistan, data suggest that, in Afghanistan, wages for unskilled labor in the private sector are substantially higher; in early 2003, wages for unskilled labor paid by foreign companies and agencies were typically about $100 per month. A comparison of inflation rates and nominal exchange rate movements in 2001, 2002, and the first half of 2003 suggests that Afghanistan has become less competitive vis-à-vis most nearby countries in the region. This reflects the large appreciation of the Afghani against the U.S. dollar in late 2001 and a higher rate of inflation. In addition, productivity is probably higher in neighboring countries than in Afghanistan because the years of conflict resulted in low levels of investment and a destruction of much of its infrastructure. In the case of transit trade, the damage to roads has contributed to higher transport costs, slow traffic movement, and greater damage to goods.\n\nLooking ahead, there may be a so-called Dutch Disease effect that could put upward pressure on the equilibrium real exchange rate. Official external financial assistance is expected to rise and remain at a high level relative to the size of Afghanistan’s economy for at least the next few years, before settling to lower levels. The composition of aid is expected to shift from humanitarian aid, with a high import content, to infrastructure and project aid, with a lower import and higher domestic content, and have a positive impact on the production capacity of the economy. There will also be a continued reflux of refugees that will contribute to increased domestic spending. The resulting increase in domestic spending on nontraded goods would lead to a rise in the relative price of non-traded to traded goods (the real exchange rate) and a shift of resources from the traded goods sector to the nontraded goods sector. However, there are also several factors that could offset these effects. The economy is operating at a low level and given the existing underutilization of capacity, including labor and the return of refugees, domestic production could rise rapidly in response to increased demand and reduce upward pressures on the price of nontraded goods. Also, as the reconstruction effort moves forward, supply bottlenecks could be eased, productivity could rise, and some costs could decline (e.g., transportation), all of which would dampen increases in domestic prices and improve competitiveness. Moreover, given the large share of transit trade in Afghanistan’s trade, a decline in transshipment costs would significantly improve the attractiveness of Afghanistan as a transit route.\n\n1The real exchange rate can be defined as RER = ePD/PF, where PD is the domestic price level, PF the level of foreign prices, and e is the nominal exchange rate (measured in units of foreign currency per unit of domestic currency). The prices used are typically those of imports and exports, or tradable and nontradable goods.\n\nBox 5.4.\n\nConsiderations on the Level of Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\nThe level of external reserves held at the beginning of 2002 by DAB was uncertain. The only identified assets were those held (frozen) with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a few other banks, which amounted to about $250 million, including $196 million in gold. Since then, the level of identified reserves has steadily increased as more assets have been located, primarily at banks in Europe, and because of inflows of donor funds to finance the budget. As of end-August 2003, DAB’s foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $556 million ($600 million with gold valued at market prices). DAB is continuing to contact foreign banks to clarify the size and status of its foreign assets. As a more reliable estimate of DAB’s reserves emerged and the authorities established a framework for macroeconomic and exchange rate policy, the question of what would be an adequate level of external reserves needed to be addressed.\n\nCriteria to assess the adequacy of reserves can generally be related to the trade account or the capital account of the balance of payments. It should be recognized that, when applying any criteria, the adequacy of reserves is a dynamic concept: as the circumstances of a country change over time, so will the desirable amount of reserves. For the moment, Afghanistan has little or no access to international capital markets and thus would have to rely more on its own resources (reserves) than on international borrowing to smooth adjustments to shocks. The potential for such shocks in Afghanistan is large and is thus a key factor in determining reserve goals. Donor assistance, either in the form of lending or grants, could be available, but access to these would be at the discretion of the donor and may not be available quickly enough to offset the immediate impact of a shock.\n\nWhen using a trade-based measure one looks at how many months of imports a country can finance with its reserves. Conversely, it shows how rapidly a country or its exchange rate might need to adjust to an external shock. Three months of imports coverage is often used as a rule of thumb to assess reserve adequacy. Reserves are generally considered low if they cover less than three months of imports. As noted in Chapter 2, the availability of reliable trade data is limited for Afghanistan. However, based on available data and estimates, the stock of reserves held by DAB at end-August 2003 was estimated to cover some three months of imports, excluding reexports; imports exempt from duties that are largely externally financed, for example, by donors; and smuggled goods. Thus, the level of reserves could be considered to be just sufficient, although a higher level of reserves would be warranted, given the country’s vulnerability to various shocks and its limited access to capital markets, to provide a crucial cushion. Also, the recovery and reconstruction of the economy could be expected to generate a rapidly rising level of own imports, and thus a higher level of desired reserves. The resumption of debt service payments would also have a bearing on the adequacy of reserves.\n\nA capital-account-based measure captures the potential for capital flight by residents. Typically, such a measure relates the level of reserves to relevant monetary aggregates, often the monetary base, and is relevant especially for countries with a (quasi) pegged exchange rate, weak banking systems, and an unstable money demand or a history of high inflation. Afghanistan has a history of high inflation that resulted in low confidence in the Afghani and the widespread use of foreign currencies. While confidence in the national currency has improved with the introduction of the new currency, the potential for large shifts between the Afghani and foreign currencies still exists and points to using a monetary aggregate-based measure in assessing the adequacy of reserves. In the absence of a functioning banking system, the relevant monetary aggregate is the stock of domestic currency in circulation; as and when the banking sector is reestablished, the relevant monetary aggregate could be expanded to include bank deposits in domestic currency. In August 2003, currency in circulation amounted to Af 22.4 billion, equivalent to $456 million at the prevailing exchange rate. This measure suggests that Afghanistan’s level of foreign exchange reserves was more than adequate. Again, with economic growth resuming and confidence in the national currency strengthening, money demand can be expected to increase, requiring additional reserves. But as long as the government refrains from central bank financing of the budget and there is limited use of a central bank discount window by commercial banks, any increase in the demand for the domestic currency would be met by an inflow of foreign exchange reserves."
