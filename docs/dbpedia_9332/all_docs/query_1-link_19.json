        "text": "So, how the Afghanistan currency, the afghani, overtook the Indian rupee in value? This is a remarkable feat, considering that Afghanistan is a war-torn country with a fragile economy, while India is a rising power with a booming population and industry.\n\nThe story begins in August 2021, when the Taliban, a militant group that had been fighting against the Afghan government and its international allies for 20 years, seized control of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, and declared themselves the new rulers of the country. This triggered a massive humanitarian crisis, as thousands of Afghans tried to flee the country, fearing persecution and violence under the Taliban regime. Many countries, including India, evacuated their citizens and diplomats from Afghanistan, and suspended their economic and diplomatic ties with the new government.\n\nThe international community also froze billions of dollars of Afghan assets that were held in foreign banks and institutions, cutting off a vital source of income for the country. The United States, which had been providing billions of dollars of aid and military support to Afghanistan for years, also withdrew its troops and assistance, leaving behind a power vacuum and a security threat. The Taliban faced enormous challenges in governing a country that was dependent on foreign aid, facing a humanitarian crisis, and facing resistance from some segments of the population.\n\nOne of the most immediate challenges was managing the currency. The afghani, which had been relatively stable for years, thanks to the support of the central bank and its foreign reserves, suddenly faced a huge demand and supply shock. On one hand, there was a surge in demand for foreign currency, as people tried to convert their savings into dollars or other more stable currencies, fearing that the afghani would lose its value under the Taliban rule. On the other hand, there was a shortage of supply of foreign currency, as the sources of income dried up and the access to foreign reserves was blocked.\n\nBut then something unexpected happened. The afghani started to appreciate against some currencies, especially the Indian rupee. In September 2023, one afghani was worth more than one rupee for the first time in history. How did this happen? And why did it happen only against some currencies, not all?\n\nSo how did the afghani manage to overtake the rupee in value?\n\nThe primary factor behind the Afghan currency's recent appreciation against the US dollar is the ongoing negotiations between the United States and the Taliban. Notably, the US Treasury Department's decision to allocate $3.5 billion from Afghanistan's national reserves to an Afghan Fund in Switzerland, aimed at ensuring economic stability, has contributed to this trend. Another significant development was the meeting between US and Taliban delegations in Doha, which occurred following the assassination of Al-Qaeda leader Ayman Al-Zawahiri. Reports in the American media suggested that a meeting took place between David Cohen, Deputy Head of US Intelligence, and Abdul Hak Vasik, the Head of Intelligence of the Taliban, in Qatar's capital. This meeting, neither confirmed nor denied by either side, has bolstered Afghanistan's economic prospects.\n\nThe establishment of the Afghan Fund and the US-Taliban meeting have created an impression that the parties may approach each other more pragmatically and take concrete steps toward resolving Afghanistan's issues. According to the Washington administration, despite the Taliban's control over the entire country, they cannot address Afghanistan's challenges in isolation. Recognizing the US as the world's superpower, the Taliban understand that reconciliation with Washington is essential for international recognition. The convergence of these perspectives has incentivized negotiations and had a positive impact on the Afghan market, leading to the appreciation of the Afghan currency.\n\nIn addition to these factors, there are other reasons contributing to the Afghan currency's stability against other currencies. Crucially, humanitarian aid from the international community, including the US, has played a pivotal role in mitigating the shortage of dollars in the market, thereby supporting the stability of the Afghan currency\n\nHow is Afghan currency stronger than India?\n\nThe exchange rate of the Indian rupee was Rs. 0.89 Afghani on September 4, 2023. The exchange rate is influenced by the balance of demand and supply for the Afghani in relation to the Rupee. An increase in demand relative to supply results in the Afghani's appreciation, while the opposite occurs when demand decreases or supply rises.\n\nThe relatively higher value of the Afghan currency can be attributed to Afghanistan's long history and reputation for trading various agricultural products with numerous nations, despite its limited involvement in international trade compared to other countries. Officially, Afghanistan's debt-to-GDP ratio is reported to be 7 percent by the IMF.\n\nAfghanistan's GDP is estimated to have declined by 20 percent following the return of the Taliban to power. Subsequently, the Afghan economy began to stabilize after months of economic decline, thanks in part to the Taliban's measures such as restrictions on smuggled imports, controls on banking transactions, and assistance from the United Nations.\n\nAdditionally, the Taliban generates substantial income from mining activities involving iron ore, marble, copper, gold, zinc, and other valuable minerals and rare-earth minerals. They impose taxes on various sectors, including mining operations, media, telecommunications, and development projects funded by international aid. Furthermore, they levy taxes on agricultural harvests and accumulated wealth. These factors collectively contribute to the economic dynamics in Afghanistan and, to some extent, influence the exchange rate of the Afghani.\n\nIndia, on the other hand, has been facing economic challenges in recent years, such as high inflation, low growth, fiscal deficits, and trade imbalances. These factors have weakened the confidence and demand for the Indian rupee, which has depreciated against major currencies like the US dollar and the euro. The Indian rupee is also affected by the policies and interventions of the Reserve Bank of India, which tries to manage its exchange rate and liquidity.\n\nTherefore, the exchange rate between the afghani and the Indian rupee is not a reflection of the economic strength or potential of either country, but rather a result of complex and dynamic forces that shape the global financial system.\n\nThis is an amazing story of how a currency that was once worthless became more valuable than a currency that was once strong. It shows how economic policies, political events, and global forces can affect the fate of a nation's money. It also shows how nothing is permanent or predictable in the world of finance. Who knows what will happen next? Maybe one day, the afghani will overtake the US dollar or the euro in value. Or maybe not. Only time will tell.\n\nThank you for reading this article.
