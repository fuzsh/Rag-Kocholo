        "text": "The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, also known as the Republic of Afghanistan, the DRA, and just Afghanistan, is a Marxist-Leninist Islamic Republic in Central Asia that is aligned with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. It managed to defeat the Afghan Mujahideen in 1992, securing its existence. The country was founded in 1978 following the Saur Revolution. It is led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The country, despite being Islamic Socialist, has subscribed to a more 'Progressive Islam', being more inclusive of LGBTQ+, women, non-Muslims, and non-Pashtuns. However, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan has been controversial since it's inception with the Soviet-Afghan War and the Afghan Civil War, though the government managed to survive and defeat the Afghan Mujahideen, causing it to split into multiple groups, including the Taliban. In more recent years, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan's factionalism caused several groups to split off, making the government more multi-party. These new parties include the National United Party of Afghanistan, Watan Party of Afghanistan, and the National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan. It was praised by Conservatives in 2001 for attempting to resist the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the starting of the War on Terror, however Conservatives continue to oppose the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and call it Authoritarian.\n\nTable of Contents[]\n\nHistory\n\nSaur Revolution and Aftermath (1978-1979)\n\nSoviet-Afghan War (1979-1989)\n\nAfghan Civil War (1989-1992)\n\nAftermath of the Cold War (1992-2001)\n\nWar on Terror (2001-Present)\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic (2020-Present)\n\nPolitics\n\nGovernment\n\nLaw\n\nDrugs\n\nLGBTQ+\n\nReligion\n\nPolitical Parties\n\nCities\n\nForeign Relations\n\nPositive Relations\n\nNeutral Relations\n\nNegative Relations\n\nReligion\n\nSunni Islam\n\nShia Islam\n\nNon-Denominational Islam\n\nZoroastrianism\n\nSikhism\n\nBuddhism\n\nJainism\n\nHinduism\n\nBaháʼí Faith\n\nChristianity\n\nCatholic Church in Afghanistan\n\nJudaism\n\nControversies\n\nAuthoritarianism\n\nReligion\n\nFlags\n\nHearts of Iron IV\n\nWikipedia\n\nHistory[]\n\nSaur Revolution and Aftermath (1978-1979)[]\n\nOn April 27, 1978, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan began the Saur Revolution. The Saur Revolution was a Communist coup in the country, led by the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan. The armed Marxist-Leninists marched through Kabul, seizing important key buildings and declaring the Republic of Afghanistan, a Capitalist state that had existed since 1973, to be dissolved. The People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. Many Islamists, Capitalists, Anti-Communists, and even some Maoists would protest the new government and form the Afghan Mujahideen, starting an insurgency against the new Democratic Republic of Afghanistan\n\nSoviet-Afghan War (1979-1989)[]\n\nOn the night of December 27, 1979, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics sent millions of troops into Afghanistan to aid the Marxist-Leninist government. The Soviets seized the major cities, even clashing with the government they were supporting. Soviet forces quickly seized Kabul and Herat, two of the largest cities in the country. This essentially turned the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan into a Soviet puppet. Soviet and Afghan soldiers then marched to the Afghan city of Islamabad and recaptured it from the Afghan Mujahideen in early 1980. By 1981, the Afghan and Soviet armies began to besiege the Panjshir Valley, which was controlled by various Afghan Mujahideen factions. In 1985, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan's constitution was written. Panjshir was recaptured by the Afghan and Soviet forces in 1986. However, in 1987, thousands of Afghan Mujahideen forces entered the suburbs of Kabul, beginning the Battle of Kabul. This caused the Soviets to prepare their withdrawal, which they completed in 1989.\n\nAfghan Civil War (1989-1992)[]\n\nFollowing the Soviet withdrawal, the Afghan Civil War began. Despite the lack of Soviet forces, the Afghan soldiers realized that they needed to rely on themselves and were motivated to fight. The Afghan army charged and pushed, recapturing thousands of miles of territory in 1990. They pushed the Afghan Mujahideen back, 573 miles away from Kabul. By 1991, the Afghan Mujahideen had retreated to the far southern portions of the country and the mountains of northern Afghanistan. On April 26, 1992, Kandahar, the last stronghold of the Afghan Mujahideen was captured by the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan Mujahideen surrendered the next day on April 27, 1992.\n\nAftermath of the Cold War (1992-2001)[]\n\nSee also: Collapse of the United States of America, 1994-1995 Afghan Protests\n\nFollowing the Collapse of the United States of America in 1991, the Cold War was declared a victory for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. With the end of the Afghan Civil War in 1992, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was finally at peace and began major reforms. Homosexuality, bisexuality, and pansexuality were all legalized in 1994. This move sparked the 1994-1995 Afghan Protests by Islamists, but they ended in 1995 after the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan compromised by making it so same-sex unions were legal but marriage was not. Though, same-sex marriage was legalized in 1996. The next year, 1997, non-binary, transgender, and gender fluid were all recognized.\n\nWar on Terror (2001-Present)[]\n\nMain article: War on Terror (World of Sovietism)\n\nOn September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda and allegedly the Taliban crashed two planes into the Twin Towers in what is called the September 11 Attacks or \"9/11\". The Socialist Republic of New York, the government controlling New York City (NYC), the city where the Twin Towers were, declared that they would respond by rebuilding the area but refused to declare war on Al-Qaeda. Osama bin Laden, seeing that he had failed to attract a war against the Afghan government, publicly admitted to the attack to try and gain more attention. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) then responded by declaring war on Al-Qaeda as an organization and ordered the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan to ban the Taliban. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, wanting to maintain peace and democracy, refused to take actions. The USSR then invaded northern Afghanistan and seized the Badakhshan Province's capital city, Fayzabad. The Afghan National Army then clashed with the Red Army but lost the following Battle of Fayzabad. After this, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan banned the Taliban and declared the political party illegal, leading to the Red Army withdrawing. Following this, many battles and skirmishes have happened between the Taliban and the Afghan government over the course of this War on Terror.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic (2019-Present)[]\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 Pandemic (Sovietism), COVID-19 Pandemic in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, 2020 Afghan Protests, 2021 Christian Afghan Protests\n\nThe first case of COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan was discpvered on December 27, 2019. This made the Democratic Republic the third country to be hit by COVID-19. Throughout 2020 and 2021, various battles and tons of cases occurred during the pandemic. The first series of controversies during the pandemic came in 2020 from right-wing conservatives that opposed lockdown and vaccine measures imposed by the Afghan government. The second wave occured in 2021, primarily coming from Christians over vaccine controversies.\n\nUOC Sports (2022-Present)[]\n\nMain article: UOC 2\n\nWhile not directly involved, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan announced it's support for Zemeorilia in UOC 2, a cross-world international event involving martial arts. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan also expressed interest in joining UOC 2 directly, but ultimately decided against it.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nThe government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, officially the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, is the governing organizations and the political organs of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan people directly elect all 352 members of the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. The Afghan people then vote for the President of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan based on the 352 members of the Soviet, which is then the head of the Soviet and proposes the new laws and changes for the Soviet to vote on.\n\nLaw[]\n\nDrugs[]\n\nIn 1992, following the surrender of the Afghan Mujahideen, the President of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan declared that, \"It is the position of the Soviet of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan that drugs are a vital part of Afghan society for medical usage and to prevent the spreading of diseases and other pains.\" Because of this 1992 declaration, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan recognizes all drugs as legal and does not punish drug addicts. However, drug dealing is illegal if you aren't licensed as a pharmacist. Drug cartel crime is also punishable.\n\nLGBTQ+[]\n\nHomosexuality, bisexuality, and pansexuality were all legalized in 1994. This move sparked the 1994-1995 Afghan Protests by Islamists, but they ended in 1995 after the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan compromised by making it so same-sex unions were legal but marriage was not. Though, same-sex marriage was legalized in 1996. The next year, 1997, non-binary, transgender, and gender fluid were all recognized.\n\nReligion[]\n\nThe official state religion of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan is Islam, this is indisputable and has been clarified by the government multiple times, most recently in 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic. However, in 1978, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan declared freedom of religion to be a right of the people of Afghanistan following the Saur Revolution. In 2021, the Christian minority of Afghanistan protested during the COVID-19 Pandemic due to the fact that they were being given less vaccines than Muslims. This caused the government to rework the vaccine programs.\n\nPolitical Parties[]\n\nList of Political Parties in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Political Party Year Founded Year Dissolved Ideology Hizb ut-Tahrir 1953 N/A Pan-Islamism\n\nIslamism\n\nSupremacism\n\nCaliphism\n\nSalafism\n\nJihadism\n\nAnti-Secularism\n\nAnti-Atlanticism\n\nAnti-Christianism\n\nAnti-Nationalism\n\nAntisemitism\n\nAnti-Zionism\n\nAnti-Democracy\n\nAnti-Liberalism\n\nAnti-Capitalism\n\nAnti-Communism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nFactions Hizb ut-Tahrir in Central Asia 1953 N/A Pan-Islamism\n\nIslamism\n\nSupremacism\n\nCaliphism\n\nSalafism\n\nJihadism\n\nAnti-Secularism\n\nAnti-Atlanticism\n\nAnti-Christianism\n\nAnti-Nationalism\n\nAntisemitism\n\nAnti-Zionism\n\nAnti-Democracy\n\nAnti-Liberalism\n\nAnti-Capitalism\n\nAnti-Communism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir in Australia 1953 N/A Pan-Islamism\n\nIslamism\n\nSupremacism\n\nCaliphism\n\nSalafism\n\nJihadism\n\nAnti-Secularism\n\nAnti-Atlanticism\n\nAnti-Hinduism\n\nAnti-Christianism\n\nAnti-Nationalism\n\nAntisemitism\n\nAnti-Zionism\n\nAnti-Democracy\n\nAnti-Liberalism\n\nAnti-Capitalism\n\nAnti-Communism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Britain 1980 N/A Antisemitism\n\nPan-Islamism\n\nTransnationalism\n\nBritish Islamism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir America 1990 N/A American Islamism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir in Bangladesh 1993 N/A Islamism\n\nIslamic Terrorism\n\nHizb ut-Tahrir Constitution\n\nPeople's Democratic Party of Afghanistan 1965 N/A Left-Wing Nationalism\n\nSecularism\n\nCommunism\n\nMarxism-Leninism\n\nFactions Democratic Youth Organisation of Afghanistan 1965 N/A Socialism\n\nYouth Rights\n\nParcham 1967 1997 Socialism\n\nRevisionism\n\nKhalq 1967 2003 Marxism\n\nLeninism\n\nAfghan Social Democratic Party 1966 N/A Pashtun Nationalism\n\nEthnocentrism\n\nSocial Democracy\n\nNeosocialism\n\nProgressive Democratic Party of Afghanistan 1966 N/A Secularism\n\nReformism\n\nSocial Democracy\n\nDemocratic Socialism\n\nJamiat-e Islami 1972 N/A Islamism\n\nIslamic Democracy\n\nRepublicanism\n\nCommunitarianism\n\nTajik Nationalism\n\nHezbi Islami 1975 1979 Islamism Islamic Movement of Afghanistan 1978 N/A Fundamentalism\n\nShariatism\n\nNational Islamic Front of Afghanistan 1979 N/A Afghan Nationalism\n\nPashtun Nationalism\n\nRoyalism\n\nPashtoons Social Democratic Party 1981 N/A Secularism\n\nSocial Democracy\n\nPashtun Nationalism\n\nLeft-Wing Nationalism\n\nIslamic Unity Party of Afghanistan 1989 N/A Hazara Nationalism\n\nShia Islamism\n\nNational Islamic Movement of Afghanistan 1992 N/A Uzbek Nationalism\n\nTurkmen Nationalism\n\nSecularism\n\nNational Islamic Unity Party of Afghanistan 1994 N/A Shia Islamism\n\nHazara Nationalism\n\nConservatism\n\nAfghan Nationalism\n\nTaliban 1994 N/A Deobandism\n\nIslamism\n\nIslamic Fundamentalism\n\nPan-Islamism\n\nReligious Nationalism\n\nPashtun Nationalism\n\nWatan Party of Afghanistan 1997 N/A Secularism\n\nProgressivism\n\nSocial Democracy\n\nDemocratic Socialism\n\nLeft-Wing Nationalism\n\nRepublican Party of Afghanistan 1999 N/A Human Rights\n\nSocial Liberalism\n\nSecularism\n\nFeminism\n\nNational United Party of Afghanistan 2003 N/A Post-Marxism\n\nSecularism\n\nProgressivism\n\nSocialism\n\nLeft-Wing Nationalism\n\nEquality Feminism\n\nRevolutionary Socialism\n\nAnti-Imperialism\n\nSolidarity Party of Afghanistan 2004 N/A Securalism\n\nLaicism\n\nDemocratic Socialism\n\nSocial Democracy\n\nProgressivism\n\nWomen's Rights\n\nFeminism\n\nDemocratization\n\nAnti-Imperialism\n\nLeft-Wing Nationalism\n\nNational Congress Party of Afghanistan 2004 N/A Secularism\n\nLiberalism\n\nFederalism\n\nNational Solidarity Movement of Afghanistan 2004 N/A Monarchism Islamic Dawah Organisation of Afghanistan 2005 N/A Islamism\n\nPashtun Nationalism\n\nNational Solidarity Party of Afghanistan 2005 N/A Isma'ilism Afghanistan Green Trend 2010 N/A Islamic Democracy\n\nIslamic Liberalism\n\nReformism\n\nPakophobia\n\nTruth and Justice Party 2011 N/A Multiculturalism\n\nAnti-Corruption\n\nReformism\n\nEurasianism\n\nCities[]\n\nKabul\n\nKandahar\n\nHerat\n\nMazar-i-Sharif\n\nKunduz\n\nJalalabad\n\nTaloqan\n\nPuli Khumri\n\nCharikar\n\nLashkargah\n\nSheberghan\n\nGhazni\n\nKhost\n\nSar-e Pol\n\nChaghcharan\n\nMihtarlam\n\nFarah\n\nPuli Alam\n\nBazarak\n\nForeign Relations[]\n\nPositive Relations[]\n\nCynetia - Oh my goodness!

Sunni Islam is the main branch of Islam, to which 85-90% of the worlds Muslims follow. Sunni Muslims believe in one God, or the Tawhid. Another major thing Sunnis believe in is the prophets in Islam and the 'Rightly Guided Caliphs', or the Rashidun Caliphs. The Five Pillars of Islam are also a major part of their beliefs. Islamic theology in Sunni Islam is referred to as Aqidah. Sunnis also believe in Islamic eschatology, or the afterlife. Some Sunnis also believe in Qadar, or predestination.\n\nShia Islam[]\n\nTBA\n\nNon-Denominational Islam[]\n\nTBA\n\nZoroastrianism[]\n\nTBA\n\nSikhism[]\n\nTBA\n\nBuddhism[]\n\nTBA\n\nJainism[]\n\nTBA\n\nHinduism[]\n\nTBA\n\nBaháʼí Faith[]\n\nTBA\n\nChristianity[]\n\nTBA\n\nCatholic Church in Afghanistan[]\n\nTBA\n\nJudaism[]\n\nTBA\n\nControversies[]\n\nAuthoritarianism[]\n\nThe main controversy regarding the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan primarily comes from right-wingers, primarily conservatives, that claim that the Afghan is authoritarian. These claims are mostly misconceptions as the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan calls itself a dictatorship of the proletariat, causing it's opponents to spin as a literal dictatorship. This is false as, in Marxist literature and theory, a dictatorship of the proletariat isn't a literal dictatorship, but a rule of proletarians over the bourgeoisie.\n\nReligion[]\n\nBeing an Islamic nation, many Christian conservatives have criticized the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan from an Islamophobic viewpoint. This criticism is often skewed and biased as it comes from those who have a strong anti-Islam stance. However, groups such as the Taliban which also call themselves Islamic have called the Afghan socialist government 'fake Muslim', but this is also a false claim. Islam is a very diverse religion with many sects and variants, some of which the DRA's government do fall under.\n\nFlags[]\n\nHearts of Iron IV[]\n\nFlags of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for Hearts of Iron V Ideologies Flag Ideology Localisation Notes Democratic Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004-2013) Communism Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Flag of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1987-1992) Fascism Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan Flag of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan Non-Aligned Islamic State of Afghanistan Flag of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992)\n\nWikipedia[]\n\nFlags of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan for Wikipedia's List of Political Ideologies Flag Ideology Localisation Notes Anarchism Afghan Commune Flag of Anarchism Authoritarianism Emirate of Afghanistan Flag of the Kingdom of Afghanistan (1926-1928) Christian Democracy Republic of Afghanistan Flag of the Emirate of Afghanistan (1929) with a magenta Christian cross Communitarianism Afghan Community State Flag of the Durrani Empire with orange instead of green Communism Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Flag of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (1987-1992) Conservatism Emirate of Afghanistan Flag of the Emirate of Afghanistan (1929) Corporatism Islamic State of Afghanistan Flag of the Islamic State of Afghanistan (1992-2) Democracy Islamic Republic of Afghanistan Flag of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2004-2013) Environmentalism Ecological State of Afghanistan Green flag TBA Fascism and Nazism TBA TBA TBA Identity Politics TBA TBA TBA Liberalism TBA TBA TBA Libertarianism TBA TBA TBA Nationalism TBA TBA TBA Populism TBA TBA TBA Progressivism TBA TBA TBA Religio-Political Ideologies TBA TBA TBA Satirical and Anti-Politics TBA TBA TBA Social Democracy TBA TBA TBA Socialism TBA TBA TBA Syndicalism TBA TBA TBA Transhumanist Politics TBA TBA"
