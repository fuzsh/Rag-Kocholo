The “Bring it On” movie franchise goes global for the very first time in the 6th installment, “Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack,” which Universal Pictures will release on August 29, 2017.

“Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack” features 19 squads from around the globe, including teams from Australia, U.K., Germany and France, in addition to the Northern Elite Gymnastics and Cheer team from the United States.

The film stars Vivica A. Fox, making her “Bring it On” debut as Cheer Goddess, the Internet’s most popular “Cheer-lebrity.” When Destiny (Cristine Prosperi), captain of three-time national champions “The Rebels,” is challenged to a global cheer showdown by an edgy new team called “The Truth,” the Cheer Goddess organizes a virtual battle for squads from all around the world. It seems like the whole world wants to take down Destiny and her team, and they just might succeed, unless Density can rise to the challenge, set her ego aside and figure out who her real friends are.

Starring alongside Fox and Prosperi are Jordan Rodrigues, Sophie Vavasseur, and Gia Ré.

The film is executive produced by Beacon partners Armyan Bernstein and Charlie Lyons, produced by Mike Elliott (Honey 3: Dare to Dance), and co-produced by Greg Holstein (Kindergarten Cop 2), Genevieve Hofmeyr (Mad Max: Fury Road), Marvin Saven (Death Race 2) and Tony Gonzalez (Bring It On franchise). Tony Gonzalez also returns as the choreographer to create the franchise’s most out-of-this world stunts yet.

“Bring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack” is directed By: Robert Adetuyi from a script by Alyson Fouse.
