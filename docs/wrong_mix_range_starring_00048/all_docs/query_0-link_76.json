        "text": "EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW it's coming, Tom Cruise's initial appearance in Collateral, the recent thriller by Michael Mann, still catches you off guard. Part of the surprise is the way Mann, who can apparently mold any actor, location, prop, or weather condition to conform to some sleek platonic ideal he carries in his head, has transformed Cruise into the spitting image of William L. Petersen circa 1986. But the silver-fox coiffure and aviator shades and designer stubble are merely superficial curiosities, quickly accepted. What seems truly odd is the sudden intrusion of Tom \"gross points\" Cruise into what had until this scene appeared for all the world to be a Jamie Foxx movie. And this unlikely scenario becomes doubly disconcerting when you realize, a moment later, that you don't even know what the hell a Jamie Foxx movie is.\n\nHas there ever been a movie star with such a poorly defined screen persona, even after almost a decade of steady work? Frankly, I'm at a loss to understand how Foxx managed to land the title role in Ray, Taylor Hackford's forthcoming biopic of the late Ray Charles—not because he isn't a remarkable talent (he's got the singer's disarming grin and metronomic sway down pat), but because Hollywood seems positively hell-bent on squandering his gifts. Until now, his lead roles have been exclusively in movies you'd cross multiple time zones to avoid—including one, 1997's Booty Call, in which the screenwriters exhausted their entire reservoir of creativity dubbing Foxx's character Bunz and his paramour (Vivica A. Fox) Lysterine. And while he's been a vibrant supporting presence in high-profile films like Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday and Mann's own Ali, he's invariably wound up looking smaller than life, overshadowed by flamboyant headliners and frenetic editing.\n\nDiminishing an actor who radiates as much nervous energy as Foxx does can't be an easy task, either. To the extent that he's been able to connect with audiences at all, he's done so by throwing himself wholeheartedly into every project, no matter how dopey or marginal his role. Even when the jokes are bombing or his costars are pulling the focus, his commitment and restless intelligence come through; you never get the sense of somebody coasting on attitude. At the same time, he keeps Methody huffing and puffing to a minimum, sparing us the flop-sweat overcompensation that many talented actors indulge in when they know they're trapped in a stinker or in danger of merging with the art direction. Audiences respect and admire him, and they want to like him. The only thing standing in the way of their unreserved affection is that Foxx has yet to deliver a defining performance—the one that firmly establishes an actor's screen identity, however he may choose to tweak and subvert it thereafter.\n\nPart of the problem, I suspect, is that he's difficult to pigeonhole, particularly at a glance. Physiognomy functions as shorthand in Hollywood, and Foxx, while plenty handsome, possesses neither the refined, brooding virility of a Denzel Washington nor the easygoing, everyday affability of a Will Smith. His background is in comedy (In Living Color, The Jamie Foxx Show), but he doesn't have the antic appearance of someone who cracks you up just standing there, the way, say, Martin Lawrence does. Truth be told, he's a little odd looking, with an unusually high forehead, deeply serious brows, and eyes that, though far from beady, nonetheless give the impression of being not quite as large as nature had intended. In short, it's the face of a character actor, the kind of guy who walks into somebody else's movie, briefly takes over the joint, then disappears, leaving you wanting more.\n\nToo much more sometimes. Any Given Sunday, in which Foxx plays \"Steamin' \" Willie Beamen, the brash, untested third-string quarterback who's suddenly thrust into the limelight when starter Dennis Quaid winds up on injured reserve, should have been the actor's commercial breakthrough. Instead, he spends half the movie hidden behind a face mask—admittedly unavoidable—and the other half struggling to shove his way through the defensive line that is Stone's hyperactive barrage of associative imagery. In the most galling instance of directorial pass interference, Foxx's anguished eight-minute duet with Al Pacino (who is gracious enough to stop bellowing for the duration), ostensibly the heart of the movie, is interrupted every five to ten seconds by interpolated clips from Ben-Hur, just in case we hadn't yet gotten the message that football players are modern-day gladiators. There's the suggestion of a great performance buried beneath all the whizbang—Foxx's voice, which remains audible throughout, drips with wounded pride—but for all you can see of the actor in this scene, he might as well be in the Zapruder film, except that Stone treated the Zapruder film with considerably more respect.\n\nAs Drew \"Bundini\" Brown, Muhammad Ali's best friend, cornerman, and junkie albatross, Foxx was given the opportunity to dig deeper than he ever had before, depicting a bleak journey from strutting self-confidence to cringing self-abasement. It's terrific work, fierce and uncompromising . . . and yet he remains so much on the periphery that I'd completely forgotten, three years later, that he was even in the movie. But Mann didn't forget. He recognized something essential in Foxx: a core of simple decency surrounded by a thick crust of fear, insecurity, and bluster. And in his latest film, he's made that mixture combustible.\n\nCollateral's plot is pure pulp hokum. What makes the movie enjoyable is the uneasy rapport that develops between Max (Foxx), an L. A. cabbie who's been dreaming of starting his own superdeluxe limo service for going on 12 years, and Vincent (Cruise), a conveniently philosophical hit man who hires Max to chauffeur him from execution to execution over the course of a single long, neon-streaked night. Foxx wisely underplays Max's terror and desperation upon discovering his fare's agenda for the evening—or, rather, he adroitly blurs the line between Max's short-term panic (Will I survive to see tomorrow?) and his long-term panic (Will I still be driving a cab in 20 years?). It's hard to believe that any actor could make this tricky dichotomy play, but Foxx pulls it off. Mann places him front and center, holding the camera on him for long stretches as he drives, and you can see the warring impulses—safety versus risk, passivity versus action—play out across his face, reflected in the cab's shattered windshield.\n\nEqually compelling, for those enamored of the cult of personality (i.e., everyone), is the film's unintentional but weirdly resonant subtext, reflected in the pairing of one of the world's most potent box-office draws with an actor whose own mother probably doesn't remember that her son starred not long ago in something called Bait. Collateral finds Cruise doing for Foxx what a previous generation of superstars—Paul Newman, Dustin Hoffman—once did for him: conferring esteem by his mere presence. (For those who find it hard to deal with the idea of Tom Cruise as elder statesman: Suck it up.) It's impossible not to read the film on one level as an allegory about the Hollywood food chain. When Max inevitably shakes off his torpor and takes action, leading to a tense mano a mano on the L. A. subway, there's a gorgeous frisson to the film's penultimate line of dialogue, spoken by Vincent/Cruise as he walks with fearless entitlement toward the quivering but determined Max/Foxx. \"Max!\" he roars over the train's syncopated rumble. \"I do this for a living!\"\n\nThat now makes two of them. Collateral arrived not long after Breakin' All the Rules, a romantic comedy that reportedly provides Foxx with a decent showcase for his goofball charm. (Having made a solemn vow in 1984 never to go near another movie with the word breakin' in the title, I'm afraid I wouldn't know.) And there's substantial early buzz about his work in Ray, if only because the one route to Oscar glory more reliable than playing a dead celebrity is playing a blind person. (Ask Pacino.) A Charles biopic may not demand much more from Foxx than superficial mimicry . . . but then, how many people had a strong sense of who Angela Bassett was before she took on Tina Turner? (That Bassett's career has since stalled says more about black women in Hollywood than about her talent or initiative.) Hollywood doesn't necessarily know what to do with Foxx yet, but at least it's finally realized it should try to do something. Watching him come into focus after years of blur will be an adventure."
