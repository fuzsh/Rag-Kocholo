Vernita’s daughter walks in as she dies, and Kiddo says to the little girl: “When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I’ll be waiting.”Well, Fox told NME Magazine she thinks Zendaya would be the perfect actor to play the daughter.“How hot would that be? And that would probably green light this project. Because her and Uma are both very tall, and it would just be kick-butt, and I love her,” Fox said during the interview. “Hopefully now we can put that out, like, ‘Tarantino, cast Zendaya!’ And spark his interest to put it on the fast track.
