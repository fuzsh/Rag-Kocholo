        "text": "Bridget Jones is coming back!\n\nNearly a decade after Renée Zellweger suited up in a baby bump as the beloved singleton in the 2016 sequel, Bridget Jones's Baby, the Oscar winner is set to return to one of her most famous characters for another installment in the franchise. On Tuesday, it was confirmed the actress will once again star on the silver screen as Jones in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy, directed by Michael Morris. Making matters even more exciting for fans, Zellweger will reunite with her Jones co-star, Hugh Grant, who is also confirmed to be joining the film.\n\nGrant starred in Bridget Jones's Diary in 2001 and the 2004 sequel, The Edge of Reason, as Daniel Cleaver, Jones' former boss and later ex.\n\nIn addition to Grant, Emma Thompson -- who co-wrote and starred in Bridget Jones's Baby -- has been cast in Mad About the Boy. Newcomers to the franchise include 12 Years a Slave's Chiwetel Ejiofor, and One Day and The White Lotus star Leo Woodall.\n\nAs for what's in store for the fourth film, the script has been adapted from Helen Fielding’s 2013 novel of the same name. Whatever the case, it marks the return of Cleaver, who was presumed to have died from a plane crash in Bridget Jones's Baby. It is only at the end of the film that a newspaper headline reveals he has been found alive, explaining Grant's return for the fourth installment.\n\nPerhaps the best news of all for Bridget Jones fans is that they will have to wait less than a year to see the sequel as it will debut in movie theaters and on Peacock on Feb. 14 -- Valentine's Day! -- in 2025.\n\nWhile it's been a whopping 20 years since Zellweger and Grant starred opposite each other in the franchise, Grant revealed in 2020 that they remain in touch.\n\n\"I love Renée. She's one of the few actresses I haven't fallen out with. We get on very well together,\" Grant said on SiriusXM’s The Jess Cagle Show at the time. \"We still exchange long emails.\"\n\nThough Zellweger has not yet addressed her latest project, she had no shortage of love for her character back in 2016.\n\n\"It's kind of fun to catch up,\" she told ET at the time. \"I was so happy to be back in her world and be reunited with her friends and her family, and it just reminded me of how much I love these characters.\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSharon Maguire Talks 'Godmothered' and Another 'Bridget Jones' Sequel\n\nHugh Grant Reunites With Renee Zellweger at the BAFTAs and Makes the Best ‘Bridget Jones’ Reference\n\nPatrick Dempsey and Wife Pack on the PDA, Renee Zellweger Stuns at 'Bridget Jones's Baby' Premiere"
