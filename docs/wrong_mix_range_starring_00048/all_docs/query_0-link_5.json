Some are said to be remakes/reboots of the original movie or cartoon while others are listed as continuations from the originals. I gathered a group of the remakes/reboots and long awaited sequels that may be hitting the big screen as early as next year. Take the Poll at the bottom to choose which of these is your most anticipated ‚ÄúBlast From the Past‚Äù film?\n\n‚òÖüé¨‚òÖ\n\nREBOOTS/REMAKES AND SEQUELS COMING SOON:\n\n‚≠ê‚òÖ‚≠ê\n\nJURASSIC WORLD\n\nDIRECTOR: Colin Trevorrow. CAST: Chris Patt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ty Simpkins, Nick Robinson, and David Oyelowo.\n\nThe long awaited fourth installment of the Jurassic franchise ‚ÄúJURASSIC WORLD‚Äù will be released in 2015 and the actual plot for the upcoming film has yet to be announced at the time of this post. The plot will be added once it is available. The rumor mill though, is in full swing. It has been stated that much of the film takes place on the island of Isla Nublar, which was the island from the first Jurassic Park film.\n\nRumors also state that Jurassic World (Jurassic Park: 4) will have succeeded in opening the theme park that John Hammond wanted in part 1, which never came to be then. There is also talks of underwater dinosaurs in this film as well as T-Rex possibly being up against a new threat, a dinosaur we‚Äôve never seen in any of the past Jurassic Park films. We will update information on the much anticipated film as they are officially released.\n\nPLOT: (TBA)\n\nEXPECTED RELEASE DATE: JUNE 12th, 2015\n\nTHE OFFICIAL TRAILER FOR JURASSIC WORLD:\n\n_____________________‚≠êüé¨‚≠ê_____________________\n\nTERMINATOR: GENISYS\n\nDIRECTOR: Alan Taylor.

The cast includes Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator, Emilia Clarke as Sarah Connor, Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, also Jason Clarke as John Connor, Aaron V. Williamson as T-800, and Sandrine Holt as Detective Cheung, who arrests both Connor and Reese upon their arrival in 2017.\n\nPLOT: (TBA)\n\nEXPECTED RELEASE DATE: JULY 1st, 2015\n\nTHE OFFICIAL TRAILER FOR TERMINATOR: GENISYS:\n\n_____________________‚≠êüé¨‚≠ê_____________________\n\nIT by STEPHEN KING\n\nDIRECTOR: Cary Fukunaga.

The writers of the upcoming duo-films are Chase Palmer and Cary Fukunaga(director) who will likely follow close to the dark and thrilling storyline of the novel featuring the clown that nightmares are made of Pennywise the Dancing Clown.\n\nPennywise torments a group of adolescents while bringing their darkest fears to life. Not only does he make their eerie nightmares into reality, he taunts his victims in creepy ways, and to some he brings death.

CAST: Kristen Wiig, Melissa McCarthy, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon.\n\nGhostbusters 3 was a rumor for a long time but earlier in 2014 it was confirmed that a reboot would definitely be coming to a theater near you in the near future. What has been officially confirmed is that the Ghostbuster crew will consist of an all female cast! Some of the rumors that have floated around before the cast was announced were that: some of the original cast will return or that Oscar(Sigourney Weaver‚Äôs character‚Äôs son)will become a Ghostbuster now as an adult.\n\nWhat has been shared via Twitter from the film‚Äôs director @PaulFeig is this: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs official. I‚Äôm making a new Ghostbusters & writing it with @katiedippold & yes, it will star hilarious women. That‚Äôs who I‚Äôm gonna call.‚Äù\n\nThe original director Ivan Reitman was on board to direct this latest installment but he stepped down after the passing of the original Ghostbuster and writer of the film, Harold Ramis who played Egon Spegler. Reitman stayed a part of the film as a producer. Filming is set to being in the summer of 2015 in New York City. UPDATES: Chris Hemsworth has been cast to field the calls for the all female-cast of Ghostbusters as the receptionist.\n\nUPDATES & CAMEO NEWS: Chris Hemsworth has been cast to field the calls for the all female-cast of Ghostbusters as the receptionist. Cameos by the original cast members Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts have been confirmed to happen!\n\nPLOT: Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy play a pair of unheralded authors, Erin Gilbert and Abby Yates, who write a book positing that ghosts are real. Flash forward a few years and Erin(Wiig) lands a prestigious teaching position at Columbia U. (Like the original, the story takes place in New York City, even though it‚Äôs being shot in Boston.) Which is pretty sweet, until her book resurfaces and she is laughed out of academia. Erin reunites with Abby(McCarthy) and the other two proton pack-packing phantom wranglers, and she gets some sweet revenge when ghosts invade Manhattan and she and her team have to save the world.‚Äù ‚Äì via: BostonHerald\n\nEXPECTED RELEASE DATE: (Filming begins 2015 ‚Äì Releases: JULY 22nd, 2016)\n\nTHE OFFICIAL TRAILER FOR GHOSTBUSTERS 3:\n\n(NO TRAILER AVAILABLE YET)\n\n______________________‚≠êüé¨‚≠ê______________________\n\nRAMBO 5: LAST BLOOD\n\nDIRECTOR: Sylvester Stallone.

CAST: (TBA).\n\nColumbia Pictures is on board for a Jumanji remake to bring an updated version of the story to a new generation. We can only imagine what cool CGI effects could be used in a remake and what kind of adventurous fun will be involved. The possibilities are endless. All plans are still up in the air especially now after the passing of the late, great Robin Williams. We will keep you posted here with any new updates and confirmed news when it‚Äôs available.\n\nPLOT: (TBA)\n\nEXPECTED RELEASE DATE: (TBA)\n\nTHE OFFICIAL TRAILER FOR JUMANJI:\n\n(NO TRAILER AVAILABLE YET)\n\n_____________________‚≠êüé¨‚≠ê_____________________\n\nPOLTERGEIST\n\nDIRECTOR: Gil Keenan. CAST: Jared Harris, Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Kennedi Clements, Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, and Jane Adams.\n\nThe classic horror film is getting a sequel/remake through 20th Century Fox with Gil Keenan as the film‚Äôs director. The cast and plot have been confirmed and the film will be made in 3D. 2015‚Äôs Poltergeist writer has re-imagined and revamped the tale of a family‚Äôs suburban neighborhood home being invaded by terrifying spirits. With a drastic change in special effects available today and knowing that there are more electronics today then when the original film was made, we can safely assume that the spirits may go beyond simply coming through the television.\n\nJared Harris will play the celebrity ghost hunter and host of a cable TV show called Haunted House Cleaners in the film. The Bowen family will be played by Sam Rockwell, Rosemarie DeWitt, Saxon Sharbino, Kyle Catlett, and Kennedi Clements as the youngest daughter of the Bowen family. Jan Adams has been cast as Dr. Claire Powell.\n\nPLOT: The film follows the classic horror tale of a family‚Äôs suburban neighborhood home being invaded by angry and terrifying spirits. When the frightening apparitions become more forceful while terrorizing the family, they escalate their attacks to the point of taking the youngest daughter. The family must unite to try and rescue her.\n\nEXPECTED RELEASE DATE: JULY 24th, 2015\n\nTHE OFFICIAL TRAILER FOR POLTERGEIST:\n\n_____________________‚≠êüé¨‚≠ê_____________________\n\nINDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE:\n\nDIRECTOR: Roland Emmerich. CAST: Jeff Goldblum, Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Maika Monroe, Joey King, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner, Sela Ward, William Fichtner, and Angelababy.\n\n‚ÄúIndependence Day 2‚Äù which will be called ‚ÄúID Forever Part 1‚Äù was announced in 2013 with Roland Emmerich set as the director. The film was given a 2016 release date for the first of a two-part sequel to the blockbuster hit ‚ÄúIndependence Day‚Äù. The initial plan was to shoot both ID Forever Part 1 ‚ÄúIndependence Day 2‚Äù and ID Forever Part 2 ‚ÄúIndependence Day 3‚Äù back to back. The latest change announced officially is the title of ‚ÄúIndependence Day Part 2‚Äù which is now titled INDEPENDENCE_DAY:_RESURGENCE.\n\nWhat we can probably look forward to and expect: The story will have a new generation of humans defending mankind against their dangerous alien adversaries in a whole new way with all of the CGI special-effects available today that was not around in the 90‚Äôs. UPDATE ON CASTING: First off, Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, and Vivica A. Fox are set to reprise their roles. AWESOME! Liam Hemsworth is taking a role as an alien butt-kicker in the upcoming ID2 film. Jessie Usher has also been cast and is being dubbed as ‚ÄúWill Smith 2.0‚Äù who will play (Will Smith‚Äôs character in the 1996 film)-Steven Hiller‚Äôs step-son, who I assume is Vivica A. Fox‚Äôs son from the first film. Maika Monroe has been cast as President Whitmore‚Äôs daughter which was originally played by Mae Whitman in the ID1 film.\n\nUPDATES & CAMEO NEWS: Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Judd Hirsch, and Brent Spiner will all return to reprise their roles.\n\nPLOT: 20 years after the events of the first film, a new wave of alien ‚Äúreinforcements‚Äù arrive at our planet in response to a distress signal sent up by the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù of extraterrestrial visitors. As expected, insanity ensues.
