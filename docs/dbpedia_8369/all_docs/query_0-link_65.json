        "text": "The story opens on the day that the Western Roman Empire collapses finally in 470AD, as the last emperor of Rome is encamped protected by the Nova Invicta Legion. All is lost in the space of a few minutes as a horde of Barbarians sweep through the camp in the fog, kill the Imperial family and take the young emperor captive. The Roman Empire is in ruins... But all is not lost. From the dust of battlefields emerges a small team of invincible warriors - The Last Legion. Their task is to rescue the Emperor and his enigmatic tutor and to try and resurrect the glory of Rome.\n\nThe film stars Colin Firth, Sir Ben Kingsley, John Hannah , Kevin McKidd (of BBC2's ROME) and Aishwarya Rai. Shot on location in Tunisia, Slovakia and Capri, this is a Dino De Laurentiis production, directed by Doug Lefler (Dragonheart: A New Beginning)."
