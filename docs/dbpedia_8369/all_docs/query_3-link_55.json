        "text": "What was the Ninth Legion?\n\nThe Ninth Legion, also known as Legio IX Hispana in Latin, was a unit of the Roman army that was established sometime in the first century BC. It may have fought in the Social War in 90 BC but was certainly well-established by the time Julius Caesar took command of them at the start of his Gallic Wars.\n\nThe Ninth Legion became famous since they fought with distinction for both Julius Caesar and the emperor Augustus and was known for its discipline, bravery, and loyalty to the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Ninth Legion was deployed to Britain was part of a larger effort to quell the resistance of the Celtic tribes in the region.\n\nThey were stationed at Eboracum, modern-day York, and played a crucial role in the construction of Hadrian's Wall, which was designed to protect Roman Britain from barbarian invasions from the north.\n\nWhat do we know about their last movements?\n\nAccording to inscriptions discovered in York, it is known that the Ninth Legion returned to and remained stationed at the Roman Fort, known as Eboracum until at least AD 108.\n\nHowever, all traces of the Ninth Legion in Britain vanish after this point. By AD 122, the Sixth Victrix had replaced the Ninth Legion at Eboracum.\n\nAdditionally, when two lists of existing legions was compiled in Rome in AD 197, the Ninth Hispania was not included.\n\nThe absence of any record of the Ninth Legion after the late second century AD, combined with the lack of archaeological evidence of their continued presence, has led many historians to conclude that the legion disappeared.\n\nThe exact circumstances of their disappearance, however, remain a subject of debate and speculation.\n\nTheory 1: Death in battle\n\nOne of the most popular theories suggests that the Ninth Legion was destroyed in a battle against the Picts, who were a confederation of tribes that inhabited what is now Scotland.\n\nAccording to this theory, the Ninth Legion was ambushed by the Britons and suffered a devastating defeat, with most of the soldiers killed or captured.\n\nHowever, this theory has been challenged by historians and archaeologists who argue that there is no clear evidence of a major battle between the Ninth Legion and the Britons.\n\nSome experts point out that the Ninth Legion was a highly experienced and well-trained unit, and it is unlikely that they would have been easily defeated by local tribes\n\nMoreover, there is no clear archaeological evidence of a mass grave or battlefield associated with the Ninth Legion in northern England."
