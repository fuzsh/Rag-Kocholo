Steve Lavin’s coaching days at St. John’s are over.

The former UCLA men’s basketball coach has mutually parted ways with St. John’s after five seasons with the Queens, N.Y.-based school, the university announced Friday.

Lavin posted an 81-55 record and made the NCAA tournament twice with the Red Storm. St. John’s lost to San Diego State, 76-64, in the second round of the NCAA South Regional on March 20. Lavin went 21-12 in his final season.

“Coach Lavin returned high expectations to our men’s basketball program and represented St. John’s in a positive way,” St. John’s Athletic Director Chris Monasch said in a statement. “We appreciate his commitment to the program and to our student-athletes over the past five years.”

Lavin, 50, achieved three, 20-win seasons with St. John’s after working as a broadcaster at ESPN for seven years. Lavin coached UCLA from 1996 to 2003 and guided the Bruins to five Sweet 16 appearances in the NCAA tournament.

“In life change is inevitable, so I take the long view,” Lavin said in a statement. “I’m proud of our results both on and off the court -- in particular our memorable runs to the NCAA tournament in 2011 and 2015.”
