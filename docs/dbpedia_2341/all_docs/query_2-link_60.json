        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- Albert “Cap” Lavin, a hall of fame USF basketball player, a distinguished man of letters and the father of St. John's basketball coach Steve Lavin, passed away over the weekend at the age of 82.\n\nMr. Lavin was named San Francisco's high school player of the decade for the 1940's after an outstanding prep career at St. Ignatius Preparatory. A skillful ball handler, Mr. Lavin enrolled at USF and played for two hall of fame coaches – Pete Newell and Phil Woolpert – in the early 1950's. He was inducted into the University's athletic hall of fame in 1997.\n\nA beloved English teacher who spent most of his career at Sir Francis Drake High School in San Anselmo, Mr. Lavin authored 19 books and co-founded the Bay Area Writing Project at the University of California at Berkeley in 1974, which has since grown to nearly 200 centers across the country.\n\nMr. Lavin also served as the curriculum director at Drake High School and the Tamalpais Union High School District for over 40 years. He also taught at Cal, San Francisco State and Dominican University.\n\nOn Dec. 4, USF paid special tribute to Mr. Lavin, along with other members of the Dons championship teams, at halftime of its game against St. John's.\n\n“Strength and depth, those are the two things that come to mind,” Steve Lavin told the San Francisco Chronicle in describing his father. “There's a depth, a gravitas and then a strong will, an inner strength that distinguishes him.\n\n“And then what balances that is the charisma, the sense of humor and the spirit of gratitude that lights up a room.”\n\nMr. Lavin is survived by his wife of 60 years, Mary, and six children, Rachel, John, Mark, Ken, Suzanne and Steve, along with many grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services are pending."
