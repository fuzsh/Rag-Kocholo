        "text": "Jan. 3, 2015\n\nRecap | Box Score | Notes | Photo Gallery 1 | Photo Gallery 2\n\nHead Coach Steve Lavin\n\nOpening Statement:\n\n\"I thought our team fought hard under tough circumstances. Butler executed well and [Kellen] Dunham had 28 points on six 3-pointers. Now we have to get ready for Villanova. There is no time to wallow in self pity, you just have to get ready for the next game and try to get your mind set and calibrated to better move forward.\"\n\nOn Kellen Dunham:\n\n\"This afternoon he was outstanding as he didn't get rattled, picked his spots with for dagger 3's and yet did not force the action. His judgments and offensively were outstanding.\" â€‹\n\nSenior Guard D'Angelo Harrison\n\nOn bouncing back from tonight's loss:\n\n\"This is tough, of course. Our job is to go out and compete every day. We just didn't get it done today. We can't dwell on this. We have one of the top teams in the country coming in on Tuesday in Villanova, so we just have to get ready for that. We can't let obstacles get in our way because we still have to play each and every day.\"\n\nOn Butler:\n\n\"We know this is a tough league. You have to credit Butler. They came in and executed their game plan. We just have to regroup and get ready for Tuesday.\"\n\nOn what happened tonight:\n\n\"We just couldn't get stops. [Kellen] Dunham had an unbelievable game. It's stuff that we can control and we know that. Even though we've lost two games, we know it's all stuff we can control which means things aren't as bad as they look.\"\n\nJunior Center Chris Obekpa\n\nOn if this reminds him of last year's start in conference play:\n\n\"We are not worried about last year. We are focused on this year and taking things gameb-by-game. We lost this one but we'll go back in the gym and get ready for Villanova.\"\n\nOn the BIG EAST:\n\n\"Everyone knows that the BIG EAST is a tough league. We're ready for it. We're going to give all we have and hope for the best.\"\n\nButler Head Coach Chris Holtmann\n\nOpening Statement:\n\n\"I think St. John's is a really good basketball team. They proved that the entire year. I think Coach Lavin has done an outstanding job with this program and this group. They're good, they're really good. They were a man down with one of their better players being out today. Our thoughts are with him.\"\n\nOn tonight's performance:\n\n\"I'm really proud of our guys. Just scroll across the bottom line and see how hard road wins are to come by in conference play. Road wins are really hard. I thought our guys put more quality possessions together in the second half than we did in the first half. I think St. John's is going to continue to have a terrific year. This certainly is a good win for our team.\""
