        "text": "Butler coach Chris Holtmann said St. John's coach Steve Lavin called him Thursday to apologize for the Red Storm's Chis Obekpa throwing an elbow that struck the head of Butler's Tyler Wideman during Tuesday night's game.\n\n\"He was very gracious, very apologetic, very classy,\" said Holtmann, adding that Lavin tried to reach him on Wednesday but wasn't able to because Holtmann recently changed his number. \"He didn't have to do that.\"\n\nThe incident happened with 8:26 left in the first half of Butler's 85-62 victory at Hinkle Fieldhouse. The two were running down the court and apparently trading words when Obekpa -- one of the country's top shot blockers and a leading candidate for Big East Defensive Player of the Year -- threw his right arm out and struck Wideman, who remained on the ground for more than a minute.\n\nThe officials reviewed video of the play and ejected Obekpa. Wideman missed a week of preseason practice because of a concussion, but returned to Tuesday's game during the second half. Holtmann said he will be available when No. 22 Butler hosts DePaul on Saturday.\n\n\"I'll take the bullet,\" Obekpa told the New York Post after Tuesday's game. \"He hit me three times and I told the ref and nothing happened. How many times can I let him hit me?\"\n\nThe game was physical and also included a flop by Sir'Dominic Pointer that made national sports programs because of how egregious it was, but Holtmann said Lavin only apologized for the incident involving Obekpa. The Butler coach had no problem with that.\n\n\"We did some knucklehead things too,\" Holtmann said. \"It wasn't all them.\""
