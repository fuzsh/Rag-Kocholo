        "text": "Opening scene\n\nI am in a single scull on Lake Union in perfect rowing conditions for February in Seattle. No wind, no rain, temperatures climbing into the 40s and a sunrise washing the whole scene in Vitamin D, which to a Seattleite might as well be crack cocaine.\n\nSo how come I am so miserable?\n\nMe: I quit\n\nMy rowing coach: Good luck with that. You are in the middle of the lake.\n\nI don’t want to overdo the “sports is a metaphor for life” thing, but I couldn’t help thinking how many times during the past year, I wanted to quit.\n\nWorking from home, not traveling, missing indoor dining, watching Too Hot to Handle on Netflix, it has felt so overwhelming at times. How easy it would be to just quit.\n\nThe problem with COVID, like a lot of challenges in life, is that quitting isn’t an option. I am not a Kardashian. I can’t jet off to a private tropical resort and wait it out.\n\nWork is the same thing. How many times has your boss come to you with an impossible task that has you calculating how long your savings will hold out when you are unemployed? But you don't quit, because you can't and also all your stuff is still at the office.\n\nAll of which brings me to why I was sitting in a boat, feeling sorry for myself. I had been learning to row a single scull for nearly a year; and, if I am being honest, I still sucked.\n\nMy peers, the same people who started rowing single sculls with me at the start of the pandemic, long ago left me in their wakes. They looked like Olympians to me. Their oars hitting the water perfectly, the only sound: the clunk of their oar locks as they feathered their blades.\n\nEven after all the classes, I still rowed like a kid learning to ride a bike. I was all flailing arms and legs. You could hear me from across the lake as my oars, working like training wheels, slapped the water on each stroke.\n\nThe class once again left me in their wakes within minutes. My teammates were looking to make small adjustments in their strokes to increase their speed. I was just looking to remain upright.\n\nI was tired and frustrated, my boat foundering between Gas Works Park and the rows of houseboats on the southern side of the lake. The half a dozen rowers I started with were just neon green specks in the distance. I was never going to catch them no matter how hard I tried.\n\nI vowed I would never again waste my time on this stupid sport. I pictured myself sleeping in and getting room service. Don’t ask me why I pictured room service but that’s where my mind went. This is when my coach told me I had to row home. I wasn’t getting room service. I wasn’t even getting a tow. I was on my own.\n\nThat’s when I did what I have done dozens of times over this past year. I took a deep breath. I calmed down and I started rowing for home.\n\nEpilogue\n\nSince that fateful morning earlier this week, I have rowed twice. I am more determined than ever to master this rowing thing.\n\n#lakeunioncrew #luc #nevergiveup"
