        "text": "Steve Alford has guided UCLA to a 117-57 overall record in five seasons as UCLA’s head coach, helping lead the Bruins to four NCAA Tournaments and three Sweet 16 appearances (2014, 2015 and 2017). The 2017-18 season marked Alford’s fifth year leading the Bruins’ program and his 27th season overall as a college basketball head coach.\n\nThe Bruins posted a 21-12 record in 2017-18, advancing to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth time in Alford’s five seasons at UCLA. After finishing in a tie for third place in the Pac-12 standings, UCLA advanced to the semifinals of the Pac-12 Tournament and secured an appearance in the NCAA Tournament’s “First Four.” Aaron Holiday captured first-team All-Pac-12 honors, while Thomas Welsh was honored as a second-team all-league selection.\n\nIn 2016-17, Alford helped lead UCLA to a 31-5 overall record. The Bruins advanced to the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16 after having tied the program record for most regular-season wins (28, also accomplished in 2007-08). UCLA’s team led the nation in assists per game (21.4), field goal percentage (52.2%) and assist-turnover ratio (1.91). The Bruins finished the year second, nationally, in points per game (89.8) and fourth in three-point field goal percentage (40.6%). Led by a trio of first-team All-Pac-12 performers in Lonzo Ball, TJ Leaf and Bryce Alford, the Bruins set Pac-12 single-season team records for total assists (771) and made three-pointers (354).\n\nAlford engineered one of the nation’s most high-octane offenses in recent years in 2016-17, as UCLA ranked No. 2 in the country in adjusted offensive efficiency (per KenPom.com). Six players averaged at least 10 points per game, while five Bruins compiled assist-turnover ratios of 1.6 or better. Ball secured National Freshman of the Year honors from nearly every national publication and was named one of five finalists for the John R. Wooden Award and the Naismith Trophy (college player of the year awards).\n\nThrough five seasons at UCLA, Alford has produced 11 NBA Draft selections, including seven first-round picks. In all, the Bruins’ head coach has sent 12 players from UCLA to the NBA. Most recently, Aaron Holiday and Thomas Welsh were selected in the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\nUCLA’s program had four former players selected in the 2017 NBA Draft, highlighted by Ball being chosen No. 2 by the Los Angeles Lakers and Leaf being selected No. 18 by the Indiana Pacers. Ball was the highest draft pick of any UCLA player since 1979, when David Greenwood was chosen No. 2 by the Chicago Bulls. In addition, the 2017 NBA Draft saw former UCLA big men Jonah Bolden and Ike Anigbogu selected in the second round.\n\nAlford’s first two teams at UCLA produced five NBA Draft selections. The Bruins had three first-round draft picks in 2014 (Zach LaVine, Jordan Adams and Kyle Anderson) and one first-round selection in 2015 (Kevon Looney). In addition, Norman Powell was selected in the second round of the 2015 NBA Draft, while non-drafted twin brothers Travis Wear and David Wear each earned playing time in the NBA in 2014-15 as undrafted free agents.\n\nDuring his first two seasons in Westwood, Alford led UCLA to back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances and the 2014 Pac-12 Tournament title. In his first year as the Bruins’ head coach (2013-14), he guided the Bruins to the Sweet 16 after UCLA won its first Pac-12 Tournament title since 2008. Additionally, the Bruins produced three first-round NBA draft selections for the second time in school history (also occurred in 1979).\n\nThrough 27 seasons as a college head coach, Alford has compiled a 580-292 (.665) overall record. He was named the 13th head coach in UCLA men’s basketball history on March 30, 2013, after having excelled the previous six seasons at New Mexico.\n\nAlford’s 28 single-season wins in 2013-14 tied the school record for most victories by a coach in his first season at UCLA (Gene Bartow went 28-4 in 1975-76). The Bruins averaged 81.2 points per game, the program’s highest scoring average since 1997-98 (83.1 ppg), and finished the season with the nation’s 11th-highest scoring average.\n\nWith consecutive Sweet 16 berths in his first two seasons, Alford became the fourth coach in program history to have led his first two teams to NCAA regional semifinals (also in that group are Gene Bartow, Gary Cunningham and Steve Lavin).\n\nA four-year standout at Indiana (1984-87) and member of the Hoosiers’ 1987 NCAA Championship team, Alford competed in the NBA for four seasons before embarking on his career as a collegiate head coach. He has served as a Division I head coach the past 23 years. After a four-year stint at Manchester College (1992-95), Alford coached at Missouri State (1996-99), Iowa (2000-07) and New Mexico (2008-13).\n\nIn 27 seasons as a head coach, Alford’s teams have qualified for the postseason 21 times, including 11 NCAA Division I Tournament berths. Alford has led his teams to the postseason in 16 of the last 18 seasons and has reached the 20-win plateau in 15 of his 23 years at the NCAA Division I level. Alford has coached his teams to at least 28 wins in four of the last seven seasons and to at least 21 victories in 10 of the previous 11 years.\n\nAlford has recorded more NCAA victories (580) as a collegiate head coach, age 53 or younger, than any other head coach in the nation. Alford, who turned 53 on Nov. 23, 2017, began his collegiate coaching career at the age of 26 at Manchester College.\n\nAlford guided New Mexico to postseason appearances all six years at New Mexico, including three trips to the NCAA Tournament (2010, 2012, 2013). His UNM teams won at least 22 games in each of six seasons, securing more victories (155), a higher winning percentage (.749) and more regular-season conference titles (four) than any previous New Mexico head coach after six seasons.\n\nAlford earned Mountain West Conference Coach of the Year honors in three of the final five seasons at New Mexico (2009, 2010, 2013). Three of his UNM student-athletes secured Mountain West Player of the Year acclaim (J.R. Giddens in 2008, Darington Hobson in 2010, and Kendall Williams in 2013).\n\nUnder Alford’s direction, New Mexico won four regular season titles in five years (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013), a streak matched only by Kansas and Gonzaga. New Mexico won the conference regular season and tournament titles in 2012 and 2013, becoming one of five schools in the country to make that claim. New Mexico achieved its two highest single-season win totals with Alford at the helm (30 wins in 2012, 29 wins in 2013). Both the 2010 and 2013 teams secured No. 3-seeds in the NCAA Tournament, tying UNM’s record for the highest-seeded team.\n\nAlford’s teams at New Mexico had similar success in the classroom. He graduated 12 of his 13 seniors, including all three seniors from his final team in 2012-13. New Mexico had compiled a program record 11 consecutive semesters of a 2.7 grade-point average or better through his final season in Albuquerque.\n\nAlford arrived at New Mexico after eight seasons as the head coach at the University of Iowa (2000-07), where he compiled a 152-106 record. He helped guide the Hawkeyes to a school-record seven consecutive winning seasons in addition to six postseason appearances (three NCAA Tournaments) and two Big Ten Conference Tournament titles (2001 and 2006).\n\nAs Iowa’s head coach, Alford helped engineer three seasons with 20-plus victories, highlighted by a 25-win season in 2006. Iowa’s 25 victories that year are tied as the second-highest single-season win total in program history, five shy of the school-record 30 wins in 1987 under head coach Tom Davis. Alford is responsible for the Hawkeyes’ two highest single-season win totals since 1987 (25 wins in 2006, 23 wins in 2001).\n\nPrior to his service at Iowa, Alford helped engineer the most successful postseason run in school history at Missouri State University (then known to as Southwest Missouri State). His four-year tenure with the Bears was highlighted by the program’s sixth NCAA Division I Tournament appearance in 1999, Missouri State’s first-ever trip to the Sweet 16 in Alford’s final season at the helm.\n\nMissouri State advanced to the NCAA Division I Tournament for the sixth time in school history that year, entering the field as the East Regional’s No. 13-seeded team. Missouri State defeated No. 5-seed Wisconsin (43-32) and No. 4-seed Tennessee (81-51) to advance to the Sweet 16 before losing to No. 1-sesed Duke, 78-61, in regional semifinal.\n\nMissouri State finished the season 22-11, as Alford guided the Bears to their second 20-plus win season in three years. Prior to Alford’s arrival in the fall of 1995, Missouri State had not advanced to the NCAA Tournament since 1992. Alford guided Missouri State to a 24-9 record in 1997, including a second-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference, as the Bears ended their season in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT). Missouri State’s 24 victories that season marked the program’s highest single-season win total since finishing 28-6 in 1987.\n\nIn 1992, Alford joined the collegiate coaching ranks at Manchester College (NCAA Division III program in North Manchester, Ind., now known as Manchester University). He took over a team that had lost its first eight games and finished with four wins in 20 contests. One year later, he led the Spartans to a 20-8 mark in his first full year (1992-93).\n\nAlford finished his tenure at Manchester by guiding the Spartans to a 23-4 record in 1994 and to a 31-1 mark in 1995. Each of Alford’s final three teams at Manchester advanced to the NCAA Division III Tournament. The Spartans went 5-1 in the NCAA Tournament in 1995, losing in the national championship contest.\n\nPrior to his coaching career, Alford enjoyed a four-year career in the NBA. He was selected No. 26 overall in the 1987 NBA Draft by the Dallas Mavericks after his senior season at Indiana. Alford played from 1987-91 with the Dallas Mavericks and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nA native of New Castle, Ind., Alford was a prep standout for his father, Sam Alford, at New Castle Chrysler High School. He earned Indiana’s Mr. Basketball Award in 1983 after averaging 37.7 points per game as a senior.\n\nDuring his collegiate career at Indiana, Alford started 120 of 125 games, helping the Hoosiers compile a 92-35 record over four seasons. Playing under head coach Bob Knight, Alford served as team captain in 1987 when Indiana went 30-4 and won the NCAA Championship.\n\nAlford concluded his college career as Indiana’s all-time scoring leader with 2,438 points (that mark was eclipsed by Calbert Cheaney in 1992-93). He became the first player to win the Indiana MVP four times and led the Hoosiers in scoring all four years. He finished his career as Indiana’s all-time leader in steals (178 steals, now ranks second) and three-point field goal percentage (53.0 percent). Alford was a consensus first-team All-America selection and the Big Ten Conference’s MVP as a senior (1987).\n\nAlford earned first-team All-Big Ten honors in each of his final three seasons and also captured All-America acclaim as a junior. He was named to the NIT All-Tournament Team as a sophomore when the Hoosiers finished second to UCLA. His career free throw percentage of .897 (535-596) ranks ninth-best in NCAA history (was fourth-best when he graduated). Alford led the nation in free throw percentage as a freshman (.913, 137-150).\n\nIn 1997, Alford was inducted into the Indiana University Athletics Hall of Fame, and in 2001 he was one of 15 players selected to Indiana’s All-Century Team. He was one of five players named to ESPN’s Big Ten Conference Silver Anniversary Team in 2004. In the Legends of College Basketball by Sporting News, Alford was No. 35 on the list of the 100 greatest NCAA Division I college basketball players.\n\nFollowing his freshman season at Indiana, Alford was selected to play for the United States basketball team at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. He shot 64.4 percent from the field and averaged 10.3 points per game, finishing second on the team in assists as the U.S. men’s team won the gold medal. The 1984 USA Olympic Team marked the last U.S. amateur squad to win the gold medal. Alford’s teammates included Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin and Wayman Tisdale.\n\nAlford earned a bachelor’s degree in business from Indiana University. He is married to the former Tanya Frost, whom he has known since the two were schoolmates in grade school in New Castle, Ind. The Alfords have three children – Kory, Bryce and Kayla. Kory graduated from UCLA in 2015 and Bryce, from UCLA in 2017."
