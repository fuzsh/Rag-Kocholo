        "text": "So, Jeff Capel is out. What's next in Arizona State's search for a basketball coach?\n\nFirst, let's start with this: According to a source, ASU made internal plans to introduce a coach this week. This was in place before news broke of Capel's withdrawal, which could mean only one of two things: A. ASU was blindsided by Capel's decision, or, B. The Sun Devils have had someone else in mind -- or at least a strong section option -- all along.\n\nThe logical candidate: Bobby Hurley.\n\nI was told Tuesday that Hurley is vacationing out of the country. If that's the case, ASU simply could be waiting for Hurley to return before making an announcement. Only issue: An open recruiting period starts Friday, so this is cutting it close.\n\nMake no mistake: Hurley, 43, would go over well here. In some ways, he is college-basketball royalty. Not only does he have the Duke background (with two national championships), he's the son of legendary high school coach Bob Hurley Sr., which means the profession is in his blood. He may need help with West Coast recruiting (ASU assistant Stan Johnson could help here), but he'd bring the intensity and toughness the ASU job requires.\n\nIn two seasons at Buffalo, Hurley is 42-20, taking the Bulls to this season's NCAA Tournament, where they lost to West Virginia by six in the opening round.\n\n\"I'm so happy for Bob,'' former Duke star Grant Hill told me at the Final Four. \"I felt like he was kind of running from (coaching) for a while, but he's in the family business. We never got a chance to see Bobby at the next level and I think because of that experience -- and I'm just speculating; we haven't talked about it, so I don't know â€“ but I always felt like he was kind of running from getting into basketball and coaching. But he has so much to offer. He can have such an impact on these young players, and he's done that in a very short period of time. It's been fun to watch. He was one of my favorite teammates of all time.\"\n\nWhat happened with Capel?\n\nSome have suggested Capel pulled out days ago, but I'm not sure that's the case.\n\nLet's go back to the Final Four.\n\nOn Friday, I walked into the Duke coaches' locker room at Lucas Oil Stadium, found Capel and introduced myself as an Arizona State beat reporter. He stopped me and said he wouldn't discuss that subject. Only Duke basketball.\n\nIf he had no interest in the job at the time, why not just end it right there?\n\nMore media entered the locker room as our conversation unfolded, but at the time, I'm pretty sure it was just me, Capel and Duke assistant Nate James. I asked Capel another question about the ASU possibility, he declined to answer and then we spent the next 10 minutes discussing his career.\n\nAt the end of Monday's championship, I returned to the locker room to find Capel, just to congratulate him and see if he had anything to say since the season had just ended. But he was nowhere to be found. I asked two Duke beat reporters if they had seen him. They had not, which was a little odd considering everyone else was around. A couple of us wondered if that was his way of avoiding questions about his future.\n\nThe news of Capel's withdrawal broke while I was on the flight home. I talked with two people Tuesday night. One said ASU didn't want to beg Capel to take the job. The other said Capel's wife -- an associate professor at Duke -- never was thrilled about heading West.\n\nOn Wednesday, Capel told Duke beat reporters his decision simply came down to wanting to stay at Duke.\n\n\"It had nothing to do with anything else really,\" he said. \"There were a lot of amazing things about the potential opportunity out there. It's more about feeling at home, feeling a comfort level here and not wanting to leave.\"\n\nCapel also said family played a role.\n\n\"I know eventually I'm going to have to leave, but we have roots here,\" he said. \"I know eventually I will leave and I really, really want to be a head coach. Also, I've been a head coach, so it's not like I'm chasing it. It's not like that.\"\n\nOther candidates\n\nThis is where it gets confusing. According to multiple sources, ASU has continued to interview candidates from all levels of basketball. Former ASU assistant coach Scott Pera -- now an assistant at Rice -- and New Mexico State coach Marvin Menzies both recently spoke with the Sun Devils. Other names I have heard: UC Irvine's Russell Turner and even former Suns coach Frank Johnson.\n\nI was told from the beginning ASU planned to talk with -- formally or informally -- as many candidates as possible. Former St. John's coach Steve Lavin continues to have support from around the program, but whether that matters to Vice President of Athletics Ray Anderson is unknown."
