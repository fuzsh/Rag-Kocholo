        "text": "Everyone knows someone who has been affected by cancer, and the St. John's basketball family is no exception.\n\nIn 2011, head coach Steve Lavin began his battle with prostate cancer. Lavin has since beaten the disease but he has not in any way forgotten the struggle and pain that he endured to get where he is today.\n\nThe power of a voice is defined by how many people can hear what is being said, and St. John's University is aware of how far-reaching its voice can be. That is why the Red Storm's basketball teams are using their platform to bring hope into the world of cancer.\n\nOn Saturday, September 28th, from 10am to 1pm, St. John's will host its third annual Dribble for the Cure event.\n\nThe Red Storm held their first Dribble for the Cure event in September of 2011, not too long after Lavin learned that he was up against the dreaded disease himself. The university partnered with Dr. Mitchell S. Cairo and the Pediatric Cancer Research Laboratory in order to make these events happen.\n\nPeople who have attended either of the events over the past two years have enjoyed food, games, and live music from the school's pep band prior to the opening ceremonies. Then, after some opening thoughts from some of the famous guests they have been afforded the opportunity to meet coaches and players from both the men's and women's basketball teams, as well as legendary SJU alumni and NBA Hall of Famers.\n\nThe dribblers then head out behind Lavin and women's head basketball coach Joe Tartamella on a 30-minute run/walk around the Queens campus before everyone eventually files into Carnesseca Arena for formal introductions of the teams and some final remarks.\n\nThe Dribble for the Cure events have raised tens of thousands of dollars for the PCRF. While cancer is still affecting children every single day, this event helps contribute a fraction of the funds needed to eventually eliminate the disease.\n\n\"St. John's Basketball is proud to be associated with the third Dribble for the Cure event on St. John's campus. It is always a special day that raises funds for cancer research and creates greater awareness for the importance of developing a cure for pediatric cancer,\" said Lavin. \"Once again, I personally encourage our fans to come join our student-athletes and staff as we collectively support this important cause. It's going to be a memorable day of service for the community at St. John's.\"\n\nCancer is the most common cause of death by disease for children and adolescents in America. But the survival rates have been steadily increasing in recent memory - partly thanks to fundraisers like Dribble for the Cure.\n\nSo come out and join the St. John's family in this third annual fight against pediatric cancer on the 28th. Registration is $25 for adults, $10 for children and $10 for St. John's University students.\n\nAccording to the St. John's Dribble for the Cure Twitter account, New York Knicks head coach Mike Woodson plans to attend the event. Former Knicks star John Starks was in attendance a year ago.\n\nTo find out more about St. John's Dribble for the Cure, including registration, pledge details and volunteer and sponsorship opportunities, fans, alumni and supporters visit: www.dribbleforthecure.com.\n\nPlease note: each participant is asked to bring their own basketball.\n\nMore from Rumble In The Garden:"
