        "text": "IOWA FALLS, Iowa — Jim Whitesell was vital in helping the University at Buffalo make the NCAA Tournament three times in four seasons and reach the second round the past two years. Now, he’s the head coach.\n\nYet Whitesell, one of six sons, might hold the family’s least interesting job.\n\nHis oldest brother, John, directed the television shows “Roseanne,” “Cosby,” “Coach,” “Law & Order” and two movies in the “Big Momma’s House” franchise.\n\nChristopher, the second oldest, is a legendary writer of daytime soap operas. Tom is a prominent Los Angeles banking executive. Jim is the fourth. Sean, the fifth son, produced the TV series “House” and “Cold Case” and was an actor, writer and producer on “Oz.”\n\nBaby brother is among Hollywood’s most influential people. Patrick’s firm represents stars such as Denzel Washington, Matt Damon, Jennifer Aniston and Ryan Reynolds. Its portfolio includes UFC.\n\n“Dang, that’s crazy,” said Buffalo center Brock Bertram, a redshirt junior Jim Whitesell recruited four years ago. “I didn’t know any of that. It’s surprising he’s not on a TV show after hearing that.”\n\nJim Whitesell agrees with the notion that professionally he’s the least of his brothers. His lifetime salary wouldn’t stack up to theirs. He flies commercial. His office is modest, its view offering neither skyscrapers nor Pacific beaches.\n\nJim, however, isn’t competing with his brothers. Like them, he’s right where he wants to be.\n\nThat each became nationally distinguished in his field is amazing enough. Even more implausible is that all came from an uncharacteristic locale with nary a nepotistic boost.\n\nTheir parents are not movie moguls or Manhattan socialites. The boys weren’t buoyed by a trust fund that allowed them to roll the career dice an unlimited number of times. They couldn’t count on mom and dad to play landlord after college, not that their sons would have wanted to linger anyway.\n\nThe Whitesells grew up in a three-bedroom home in Iowa Falls, a rural speck of about 5,200 folks in the middle of the Hawkeye State.\n\n“Our house was six crazy boys and one bathroom,” said Jim Whitesell, seated with his parents and wife at the Coffee Attic in downtown Iowa Falls. “Family was first, foremost and all that you did.\n\n“But these two,” he pointed at his mom and dad, “allowed us to dream. If we wanted to do something, they told us to try it. That resonated throughout the house all the time.”\n\nJack and Patricia Whitesell permitted no loafing. Their sons had paper routes, worked around the house and out in the yard and on Jack’s innumerable side projects, were obligated as teens to complete the Outward Bound summer survival camp, needed to hold summer jobs throughout college.\n\nThe boys also were encouraged to be ambitious and explore frontiers.\n\n“Reach for the stars,” Jack told them over and again. “Any damn fool can pick up a rock.”\n\nOne after the other, a son pursued his passion and thrived.\n\nAs much as they jockeyed for attention and tormented each other while living under the same roof, they didn’t compete professionally. Four of them overlapped vaguely within the entertainment industry, but each navigated a distinct path.\n\nAll of them have been written about and ranked for the world to see. Last year, The Hollywood Reporter rated Patrick Whitesell and his business partner ahead of Oprah Winfrey and Steven Spielberg on its annual “Most Powerful People in Entertainment” list, while the Commercial Observer included Tom Whitesell alongside legendary architect Frank Gehry and Mayor Eric Garcetti on its “25 Most Powerful Real Estate Figures in Los Angeles” list.\n\n“My family is unusual because we’re noticed and reviewed a lot,” Jim said. “It’s unusual that, growing up where we did, we’re now in such different locations. As kids, none of us probably thought we’d leave Iowa. If you got to Minneapolis, you were far away. But our vocations moved us.\n\n“All of us were taught to work hard and encouraged to take the risk. You have to get lucky maybe, but you have to give things a shot, no matter what.”\n\nThe Whitesells, over the years, have shown an enviable knack for converting long shots like they’re layups.\n\nWhile his brothers have remained in leading roles for the most part, Jim is in front of a Division I basketball program for the first time since Loyola-Chicago fired him in 2011. He recovered with tournament success, working for Rick Majerus at St. Louis, Steve Lavin at St. John’s and Nate Oats at Buffalo.\n\nOats left seven months ago for Alabama, clearing the way for Jim Whitesell to coach a talented team that should contend this season for a fifth Mid-American Conference championship in six years.\n\nAll of that would comprise the splashiest career update in most families.\n\nJust not this one.\n\nTo find the place where the Whitesell family’s story began, you head from Des Moines 80 miles north on Interstate 35, another 20 miles east on U.S. Highway 20, past acres of farmland stretching beyond the horizon and through a prolonged manure smell that will loosen your fillings.\n\nDespite its size, Iowa Falls is the largest town in Hardin County. That means the word “urban” wouldn’t be used to describe anything within a 40-minute drive.\n\nIowa Falls wouldn’t be called a backwater either.\n\nIt’s called The Scenic City, with grand bridges spanning the Iowa River, picturesque railway landmarks and a downtown area that resembles a quaint movie set.\n\nEmpty storefronts are prevalent in small-town America, but not here. Along Washington Street are trendy boutiques, antique shops, a florist, a fabrics store and pizza parlors. Landscapes are tidy. The street smells like potpourri. The lone missing image is a barber’s pole.\n\nIowa Falls has three banks, and shingles for financial advisers hang throughout town, indicating how successful the local agriculture industry has been.\n\nJack and Patricia Whitesell aren’t from here. Jack was born in Pennsylvania, grew up in New Jersey and graduated high school in Phoenix. Patricia is from Waukegan, Ill., about halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee.\n\nThey attended the University of Iowa. Patricia was following her father’s career path to become a pharmacist. Jack aspired to open a small-town law practice, but he had many itches to scratch.\n\n“I’d never met anyone like him before,” Patricia said.\n\nJack borrowed money from the law school to purchase an engagement ring. Patricia didn’t hesitate. Her mother is the one who recommended Iowa Falls, having heard it would suit their professional and family plans. They’ve been married 67 years and haven’t lived anywhere else.\n\nA significant aspect to making Iowa Falls home was heavy community involvement.\n\nJack performed in local theater productions such as “Our Town,” “You Can’t Take It With You” and “Man of La Mancha.” The family sang Christmas carols door-to-door. They bought radio station KIFG (Keep Iowa Falls Going) and put their sons to work spinning records and reading the news.\n\nAgainst Patricia’s desires, a local journalist convinced Jack to purchase the historic Metropolitan Theatre out of bankruptcy in 2013. With Patrick’s financial assistance, they sank a reported $500,000 into renovations so Iowa Falls could have a movie house.\n\nHugh Jackman, one of Patrick Whitesell’s A-list acting clients, was charmed with the civic gesture. Jackman brought the 2013 premiere of his film “Prisoners” to Iowa Falls.\n\n“It wasn’t about the specific film,” Jackman said two weeks ago from Kansas City, Mo., where his one-man show was on tour. “I wanted to hold a premiere in Iowa Falls to honor Jack.\n\n“I wanted to help bring attention to the extraordinary efforts he, and the entire family, went through to refurbish the theater and bring it back to its original glory.”\n\nJackman is so smitten by Jack Whitesell that the “Wolverine” and “Les Miserables” leading man calls him The King.\n\n“You can’t walk a single step with Jack without him being recognized,” Jackman said. “He’s The King not because he’s on a billboard, but because he’s humble, kind and has a heart of gold.”\n\nBeing Iowa Falls royalty would take the princes only so far.\n\nJack and Patricia made sure their sons took advantage of life in a small town, where youngsters can dabble until they discover what drives them.\n\n“Iowa Falls was a great incubator,” Tom Whitesell said. “One of the great things about living in Iowa Falls was you got exposure to everything. You didn’t have to be some kind of superstar to get your shot at it. You got breadth and opportunity.”\n\nNotwithstanding his turn as Pa in the ninth-grade play “It’s Cold in Them Thar Hills,” Jim knew early he didn’t yearn to be on the stage like some of his brothers.\n\nJohn and Christopher loved the theater, but the rest of the Whitesell boys obsessed about sports.\n\nWhile the two oldest brothers preferred the Des Moines Register’s news section, the other four fought over the sports pages. Now and again, Patricia would erupt and order the rambunctious quartet onto the front porch to read their sports outside.\n\n“The four youngest of us were basketball junkies,” Tom said. All four played in college despite none earning an athletic scholarship.\n\nIowa Falls was such an effective proving ground for the Whitesell boys that they chose to leave.\n\nBut all might not have dared to bust out if not for the oldest son, John Jr.\n\n“Our parents didn’t put any boundaries on us to what we could achieve or where we could go,” Patrick said. “They told us to follow our hearts.\n\n“But John did something that seemed unthinkable at the time. No one we grew up with moved to New York City. That raised the possibility for everybody.”\n\nJohn graduated from Simpson College in 1976 and headed to the big city.\n\nThe decision captivated his father especially. Jack loved the idea of his firstborn attacking Manhattan, a place that enraptured Jack since he was a boy. He would take the ferry from New Jersey and soak in the Big Apple energy.\n\n“I remember talking to John one day when he was living in New York,” Jack recalled, “and he said, ‘You know, Dad, I got these friends who keep telling me they’re finding themselves. What does that mean?’ That’s what happens when you grow up in such a big place where you don’t know anybody.”\n\nJohn scraped for years in search of an opening. He eventually got his break, directing the soap opera “Guiding Light” and winning a Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding direction of a drama series.\n\nChristopher called John’s gambit “absolutely essential” to amplifying possibilities. Christopher said he knew from a young age he would not remain in Iowa Falls because, to him, growing up in a small town was a constant reminder the world offered so much more to discover.\n\n“But I did not expect every one of my brothers to feel that way,” Christopher said.\n\nAs admirable as John’s ambition was, when Christopher informed his parents he wanted to write soap operas, Patricia was stunned. That’s because Christopher had earned an undergraduate degree from Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service and a law degree at Iowa.\n\n“Chris got his law degree and had a good job lined up,” Jim Whitesell said. “Then he told Mom and Dad he wanted to be a soap opera writer.\n\n“I was, like, ‘Are you out of your mind?‘ But they said, ‘Great! Go do it! Give it a shot.’ ”\n\nChristopher has won five Daytime Emmys for writing, two for “As the World Turns” and one apiece for “Guiding Light,” “One Life to Live” and “Days of Our Lives.” He has been nominated 11 other times. Last year, Christopher won his fifth Writers Guild of America Award, this time for “General Hospital.”\n\nJim Baron dropped by a recent Buffalo basketball practice because that’s what old coaches enjoy doing. The former St. Bonaventure, Rhode Island and Canisius College boss is retired now, but he’s addicted to the whistles and sneaker squeaks.\n\nBaron sat alone in a folding chair by the sideline and watched Jim Whitesell work.\n\n“I like his style,” said Baron, the four-time Atlantic 10 coach of the year. “I was always called a junkyard dog, so I can appreciate that approach.”\n\nBuffalo fans aren’t sure what to expect from their new coach. It has been eight years since anyone has seen Whitesell call all of a program’s shots.\n\nPat Baldwin has a clue. The Wisconsin-Milwaukee head coach spent seven years with Whitesell on the Loyola-Chicago staff. Baldwin was associate head coach the final two seasons.\n\n“I couldn’t think of a better person to have worked for,” Baldwin said. “He’s a really good coach, a really good teacher. He’s fair and, above all, he’s going to ask you to compete. Kids want to play hard for him.”\n\nWhitesell received his chance at Loyola-Chicago after running programs at Division III Elmhurst College and Division II Lewis University, taking each school to the national tournament. He went 202-134 at Lewis.\n\nLoyola-Chicago was decent under Whitesell. His graduation rate was 100 percent, but the Ramblers won 20 games only once and never finished higher than third in the Horizon League. He was fired in 2011.\n\nAs bitter as Whitesell’s dismissal was, his subsequent stops exposed him to winning systems and strategies.\n\nRick Majerus hired him to be St. Louis’ top lieutenant, but not without putting Whitesell through the ringer first.\n\n“The interview process lasted about a month,” Whitesell said, “because everything about him was keeping you off-kilter. I think that was part of his genius, to see how badly you want to do this. He was kind of testing you all the time.”\n\nWhitesell called working for Majerus “challenging, but great.” St. Louis won 26 games, broke into the AP Top 25, made the NCAA Tournament for the first time in 13 years and reached the Sweet 16.\n\nThat was Whitesell’s first Division I NCAA trip, and Majerus praised his role.\n\n“He’s the top assistant coach, that’s definitive,” Majerus said in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “He’s the offensive coordinator, the defensive coordinator, the special-team guy, the sideline outs. Not to detract from (assistant coaches Jim) Crews or Tanner (Bronson), Jim has got total responsibility for every aspect of the program. Others have aspects for specific parts.”\n\nThe season would be Majerus’ last, a heart condition forcing him to retire. Majerus died in December 2012. He will be inducted into the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame next month.\n\nCrews, with extensive Division I experience and four NCAA trips at Evansville, was elevated to replace Majerus. Whitesell remained the associate head coach and revisited the Sweet 16 a second straight year.\n\nWhitesell in 2013 became the last brother to move to one of America’s top two media markets. He accepted Lavin’s invitation to be an assistant at St. John’s. Two years later, Whitesell was back in the Big Dance.\n\nBut St. John’s and Lavin parted ways after that season. The staff was cast adrift.\n\nWhitesell came to Buffalo in 2015 after Oats was promoted to head coach and many predicted the program would fall apart. Bobby Hurley had guided Buffalo to its first NCAA Tournament berth and then jilted the program for Arizona State.\n\nOats not only settled Buffalo’s program, but also furthered it. Whitesell ran the team when Oats needed to be with his wife, Crystal, who was diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphoma in October 2015.\n\n“His whole experience of being able to run a practice and run different aspects of the program while I was attending to my family was huge,” Oats said. “We were able to make the tournament that first year, and it really got us off on the right foot, helped us out with recruiting and showed that even though Hurley had left, we continued to move forward.”\n\nWhitesell was the defensive strategist. Jamie Quarles, Oats’ top offensive assistant, remained in Buffalo on Whitesell’s staff.\n\nAlthough Buffalo was the nation’s sixth-highest scoring team last year, Oats credited Whitesell’s defense for allowing the offense “to get out and run.” Buffalo ranked 31st in KenPom’s adjusted defensive efficiency metric, no small feat for a mid-major program.\n\nOats said he “got goosebumps” when Buffalo athletic director Mark Alnutt called to tell him he was hiring Whitesell for the vacancy.\n\n“We all wanted him to be the coach,” Bertram said of Whitesell. “When he got the job, we we were all really excited. He’s been here a long time, and as the top assistant he was almost like a second head coach.\n\n“We trust that he’s going to be there for us and have our backs. Some coaches insist on you playing in a system. He knows we work on our game and put in a lot of work over the offseason. We have to earn it, but he allows us to play free and have fun.”\n\nBaldwin noted that Whitesell’s coaching wherewithal has strengthened over the eight years they were apart, but Baldwin’s experience on Whitesell’s staff and what he endured last November — UB beat Wisconsin-Milwaukee 96-77 in Ireland — allowed him to project a scouting report.\n\n“You’ll see the same stuff now at Buffalo that you did when he was on staff,” Baldwin said. “There is a lot of Majerus characteristics in their defense. From where we were at Loyola to where we are now, his approach to defending ball screens is a lot different. It’s effective, and I think he’ll stay with that.\n\n“Offensively, I think he wants to run more, push more. He’s definitely made the transition with the times, like what they’re doing in the NBA, from having two anchoring posts to guys that can step out and shoot from 3, especially bigs. Kids nowadays want to shoot more 3s. I think he’ll accommodate that.”\n\nA couple of quick stories that undercut Baron’s impression that Jim Whitesell is a junkyard dog.\n\nAt the bleary-eyed end of his annual guys’ trip, where brothers and college buddies gather for golf and a Chicago Cubs game, he met the future Ms. Connie Whitesell at Z’s Sports Deli and Grill.\n\nConnie, freshly relocated to Chicago, was there with a friend. They intended to have a drink and leave early.\n\n“A whole crowd was in this bar,” Connie said. “Jim and I just hung out for a little bit, and we started dating.”\n\nConnie choked up — and laughed at herself for doing so — while recounting how Jim proposed. They’ve been married 24 years.\n\n“Oh, my gosh, it was so romantic,” Connie said. “We had dinner at one of our favorite restaurants in the city at the time. While we were sitting there, a carriage pulled up. We got in the carriage and it took us over to these school steps, where Jim first told me that he loved me, and he proposed.”\n\nIf any further proof is needed that Jim is a softy away from the court, observe the photos Connie posts on social media of her husband’s prowess at baking peach pies.\n\n“I never passed them up,” Oats said. “They were pretty impossible to refuse.”\n\nTom and Jim would leave the house on College Avenue, cross the swinging bridge over the Iowa River and head to the Baptist Assembly Ground to run the courts for as long as humanly possible. Lights were on a timer that continually had to be reset. They brought along Sean and then eventually Patrick to play against kids four and five years older than they were.\n\nSean walked on at Northern Iowa. Jim and Patrick played at Division III Luther College. Tom sampled a little of both, walking on at Northern Iowa (before it ascended from Division II to Division I) for one season and playing another season after transferring to Luther.\n\nA poll of the brothers revealed Sean was the best overall athlete, but Patrick was the best shooter.\n\nAs for Jim’s prowess, Patrick replied, “Those who can’t do, teach.”\n\n“He was a good floor general,” Tom said of Jim. “He could see the whole game really well. He thought he was a much better defensive player than he was, and, from true athletic ability, he wasn’t anything super. But he was a legit Division III player.”\n\nWhile Jim avoided the stage, he most certainly got into the entertainment industry.\n\nDivision I programs worry about the box office, particularly schools that bank on basketball to underwrite non-revenue sports. Coaches, like shows, get canceled all the time for poor ratings (measured with a win-loss column), once the storylines grow stale or the lead actor leaves for something else.\n\nThat’s what happened at St. John’s in 2015. Lavin had a year remaining on his contract and had just gone to the NCAA Tournament. The anticipation was a three-year extension for Lavin. Jim was dispatched to Columbus for a recruiting trip. By the time his plane landed, the entire staff had been dumped.\n\n“Shows run their course lots of times,” Jim said. “Maybe the writing and acting is great, but the ratings aren’t there. Circumstances keep you from succeeding. In coaching you have that, too.”\n\nSean Whitesell never stopped considering basketball entertainment pitches. His career found traction as a producer-writer for “Cold Case,” “The Black Donnellys,” “House” and “The Killing.” He was an actor-writer on “Homicide: Life on the Street.” Sean also made his acting mark on the HBO series “Oz” as cannibal inmate Donald Groves, in addition to writing two episodes and producing eight.\n\nThrough it all, though, Sean wished to create a television show based on Majerus’ larger-than-life personality.\n\n“He had all the characters,” Jim said. “The personalities were based on the players that he would gravitate toward. He loved being at the games.”\n\nJim’s office doesn’t tout his family’s accomplishments or connections. On his walls are nothing but UB pride, large photos of his players and reminders of what the program has accomplished on a national level.\n\nHere or there on a shelf are inconspicuous photos of his loved ones.\n\nJim grabbed a frame to provide a closer look at a special moment for the Whitesell men. There stand Jack, all six of his sons and Sean’s son, Gus. They have just watched St. John’s defeat Georgetown at Madison Square Garden on Feb. 28, 2015.\n\n“That day, we were the best basketball team in the country,” Jim said. “And then that night we saw this new play, ‘Hamilton,’ and I didn’t even know what a ‘Hamilton’ was.”\n\nJim let loose a rumbling laugh at the memory, but then his voice dropped to a whisper.\n\n“And that,” he added, “was the last basketball game Sean ever saw.”\n\nSean Whitesell, 18 months after being diagnosed with the aggressive brain cancer glioblastoma, died in December 2015. He was 52.\n\nIn deep thought about his little brother, Jim’s left cheek twitched.\n\n“I don’t know if you ever get over it,” Jim said. “I don’t think it’s ever going to be … It’s a hole in your heart, but you keep moving on.”\n\nJim couldn’t speak for 17 seconds.\n\n“That’s probably my biggest thing with him,” he continued, choking out his words. “We were all real close. It’s an incredibly hard thing to ever get over.”\n\nJim needed 13 more seconds before he could finish.\n\n“But he’s still in our hearts,” Jim said. “He’s still with us. I believe that.”\n\nThe Whitesells pay a price for their public lives.\n\nJim’s $300,000 salary is public information as a state employee, but at least he doesn’t need to worry about cropping up in gossip rags.\n\nWikipedia lists 12 notable people from Iowa Falls; five of them are Whitesells. Tom, the banker, is the only son without a Wiki page.\n\n“Tom figured it out,” Jim said. “He’s got a job he loves. He’s really good at it, and he’s very happy. He’s well-respected and gets accolades, but it’s not as public.”\n\nPatrick’s divorce proceedings have been reported breathlessly. His ex-wife, Lauren Sanchez, has been involved in a relationship with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person.\n\nThe family couldn’t grieve Sean’s death without becoming tabloid content. Paparazzi clicked away at estranged spouses Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner walking together at the funeral. What they were wearing was considered news.\n\nWith that in mind, perhaps what the outside world considers the most interesting career isn’t what a Whitesell brother would desire.\n\nThe most popular job within the family might be Jim’s. The amount of unsolicited advice he receives about which drills to emphasize, inbounds plays to implement and player matchups to reconsider underscores what his brothers are interested in.\n\n“They’d all rather talk about Jim’s job than their own,” Patricia said. “I think they’d all rather be a coach.”\n\nEven Jackman concurred.\n\n“Ranked No. 1, absolutely!” Jackman said. “Jim has the coolest — and most important — job of all.”\n\nAsked if his brothers ever have provided a useful tip, Jim rolled his eyes.\n\nChristopher makes it a point not to talk basketball with Jim because he doesn’t want to pester him like the others do.\n\n“We want the glory of being a basketball coach, the games,” Tom said. “But the daily grind of dealing with all the issues and recruiting, none of us would want to deal with that part. We just want to coach and yell and look good on the sidelines.”\n\nThe grind is real. Buffalo lost five seniors from last season’s team that won a school-record 32 games and ranked No. 15 in the nation. Reigning conference MVP C.J. Massinburg and three-time top sixth man Nick Perkins are gone.\n\nJim Whitesell had to scramble in the spring. Buffalo lost all four of the recruits who had committed before Oats departed for Alabama.\n\nBut two starters, guards Davonta Jordan and Jayvon Graves, are back. Guard Ronaldo Segu and forward Jeenathan Williams, both sophomores, are among the highest-rated recruits in program history.\n\nNewbies include four Division I transfers. Off guard Antwain Johnson and versatile forward Gabe Grant were in the program last season, sat out and are now eligible. LaQuill Hardnett, a 6-8 forward, redshirted at Cincinnati and can play right away. Josh Mballa, a 6-7 forward from Texas Tech, is awaiting word from the NCAA about his status. Junior college transfer David Nickelberry is a swingman who played his freshman season at Memphis.\n\nOn a scale of one to 10, Tom pegged his brother’s opportunity at 11.\n\n“Jim ate crow for a long, long time,” Tom said. “For eight years he was an assistant with integral influence on all three places that went to the NCAA tournament. He didn’t care about publicity but just worked hard.\n\n“He’s going to be super-prepared. People will need to give him a little time to transition after the players he lost, but his mind is right.”\n\nMid-major basketball success is difficult to maintain. Buffalo became a hot ticket last season, filling up Alumni Arena with standing-room-only crowds. The Bulls were ranked every week in the AP top 25 poll and finished at No. 15. They were No. 10 in the RPI.\n\nPrognosticators assume Buffalo will plummet without Oats and the graduating seniors.\n\nBuffalo didn’t receive a vote for the 2019-20 preseason AP poll and is ranked 93rd in the KenPom ratings, 11 slots behind MAC rival Toledo.\n\n“Obviously, the talent is different,” Oats said of this year’s Bulls. “They lost some really good players, but I still think they have the most talent in the MAC.”\n\nJim Whitesell had a hand in building a formidable program.\n\nNow he’s the leading man.\n\n“I know he’ll do great,” Jack Whitesell said, “and if not, then he’ll have four brothers ready to tell him what he’s doing wrong.”\n\n(Top photo: Fred Kfoury III / Icon Sportswire / Corbis / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
