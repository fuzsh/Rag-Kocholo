        "text": "Barnes had begun talking to Tennessee athletic director Dave Hart about the Volunteers’ coaching vacancy Saturday, the day before his departure from Texas was announced. His move from one shade of orange to another became official Tuesday when Barnes was introduced as Tennessee’s new men’s coach.\n\n‘‘At that point in time, yes, it was something that had been discussed and it was something I truly wanted to see happen,’’ Barnes said.\n\nBarnes succeeds Donnie Tyndall, who was fired Friday after going 16-16 in his lone season at Tennessee amid an NCAA investigation into his two-year tenure at Southern Mississippi. Barnes agreed to terms on a six-year contract that will pay him $2.25 million annually.\n\nThe 60-year-old Barnes will be Tennessee’s fourth coach in six seasons, and the Volunteers are counting on him to provide stability. Barnes went 402-180 in 17 seasons at Texas, including a Final Four appearance in 2003.\n\nHe is 604-314 in 28 seasons with stops at George Mason, Providence, and Clemson.\n\nTexas announced Barnes’ departure in a university release that described it as a mutual decision. Barnes made it clear at his farewell news conference that he was fired and that he told Texas athletic director Steve Patterson he wanted to stay. Barnes said he was given the choice of firing his staff or being fired himself.\n\n‘‘We are very, very fortunate today to have hired an elite basketball coach,’’ Hart said. ‘‘That’s what Rick Barnes is. He is definitely an elite coach.’’\n\nHart’s admiration of Barnes was evident in Tennessee’s pursuit of him. Hart said he flew to Austin, Texas, on Sunday and accompanied Barnes on his trip to Knoxville shortly after that farewell press conference.\n\n‘‘From that moment on, we literally have been together around the clock,’’ Hart said.\n\nAnd in the end, Tennessee landed a veteran coach who is savoring a new opportunity.\n\n‘‘I am driven,’’ Barnes said. ‘‘I’ve had one goal in my life and that would be the chance to play for a national championship. This is a university that provides you with everything you need to do that. I realize how hard that is to do... but that’s the standard we’ll set.’’\n\nAlthough Barnes’ only Southeastern Conference experience is a brief stint as an Alabama assistant from 1986-86, he has plenty of familiarity with his new campus and new boss.\n\nBarnes said he was an assistant coach at George Mason in 1987 when he interviewed for a head coaching opportunity at East Carolina, where Hart was working at the time.\n\n‘‘For some reason, he didn’t hire me,’’ Barnes quipped. ‘‘I’m thankful this time that he did.’’\n\nBarnes’ ties to Tennessee began much earlier.\n\nHe grew up in Hickory, North Carolina, about 200 miles east of Knoxville. He frequently visited Tennessee’s campus in 1974 while dating his wife, Candy, a 1975 Tennessee alum. He recalled watching Condredge Holloway lead Tennessee’s football team to a victory over Tulsa and regularly stopping at an area deli for roast beef sandwiches before heading back to Hickory.\n\n‘‘In some ways, I feel like I’m coming home,’’ Barnes said.\n\nThe Vols are hoping he stays ‘‘home’’ for several years to come, ending the recent revolving-door nature of their coaching position.\n\nBruce Pearl was fired in 2011 amid an NCAA investigation. Pearl was replaced by Cuonzo Martin, who left for California after three seasons. Tyndall took over for Martin last year.\n\nChris Mullin is coming home to St. John's.\n\nThe Red Storm confirmed Tuesday that their career scoring leader and the player who led them to the 1985 Final Four will be introduced Wednesday as the new coach.\n\n‘‘This is a role I have been preparing for all of my life,’’ Mullin said in a statement. ‘‘There are so many people who have had a great influence on me to reach this point, especially my parents, Coach [Lou] Carnesecca and my former teammates.’’\n\nHe succeeds Steve Lavin, who agreed to leave last week. Lavin took the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament twice in five seasons.\n\nIowa State assistant Matt Abdelmassih will join Mullin as an assistant coach.\n\nRefuting the notion they were the cause of its demise, Boston College basketball coach Jim Christian Tuesday night confirmed the Eagles will not be playing in the Coaches vs. Cancer Tripleheader at TD Garden because it was “mutally agreed’’ the early November date was not beneficial for any of the teams from UMass, Boston University, Northeastern, Holy Cross, and Harvard. “It was a good event, a great cause, but it wasn’t a good date,’’ said Christian, who indicated his team would attempt to schedule a nonconference game against Harvard in 2015-16, but had no plans for games against UMass, BU, Holy Cross, or NU . . . BC junior guard Olivier Hanlan, who led the ACC in scoring with 21.9 points and in 3-point percentage at .436, was named an Honorable Mention AP All-American . . . University of Connecticut forward Rakim Lubin announced plans to transfer at the end of the spring. The 6-foot-8-inch, 260-pound freshman played sparingly for the Huskies, who finished 20-15 and lost in the first round of the NIT. Lubin appeared in 24 games, averaging 1 point and 1.2 rebounds.\n\nSheldon McClellan scored 12 of his 16 points in the second half, and shorthanded Miami rallied to beat Temple, 60-57, in New York to reach the NIT championship game. Already without point guard Angel Rodriguez, the Hurricanes lost center Tonye Jekiri to a concussion early on and trailed by 11 late in the first half. The Hurricanes will face Stanford, which got 24 points from Chasson Randle to defeat No. 1 Old Dominion, 67-60 . . . D.J. Balentine scored 28 points to lead host Evansville past UT Martin, 79-66, to advance to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament championship against Northern Arizona, which defeated New Jersey Institue of Technology, 68-61, in Flagstaff, Ariz.\n\nConnecticut’s Breanna Stewart and Notre Dame’s Jewell Loyd are unanimous selections for the 2014-15 AP women’s All-America team.\n\nSouth Carolina junior Tiffany Mitchell, Baylor sophomore Nina Davis and Minnesota sophomore Amanda Zahui B join the two juniors to round out the team.\n\nMichael Vega contributed to this report."
