        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- Former St. John's star Chris Mullin has accepted the offer to become the next head coach of the Red Storm, according to multiple reports.\n\nSt. John's and Steve Lavin parted ways on Friday after a loss to San Diego State in the first full round of the NCAA Tournament ended an up-and-down 21-12 season. Lavin went 81-55 in five seasons at the school, but had a postseason record of 2-9 in the Big East Tournament, NCAA Tournament and NIT.\n\nSt. John's hasn't won an NCAA Tournament game since 2000.\n\nAdministrators apparently think Mullin, a member of the school's 1985 Final Four team, is the man to end that drought. The 51-year-old has no coaching experience but there's no doubt about his basketball acumen. Mullin, a five-time NBA All-Star with two Olympic gold medals, was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\nMullin's post-basketball resume includes a stint as general manager for the Golden State Warriors and his most recent gig as an adviser to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, a news conference to announce the hiring will likely take place on Wednesday.\n\nMullin is taking over a program in transition, with impact seniors D'Angelo Harrison, Jamal Branch, Phil Greene and Sir'Dominic Pointer all set to graduate. Junior center Chris Obekpa's future with the program is in doubt after he was suspended and forced to sit out March Madness due to violating team rules, reportedly failing a test for marijuana. The Red Storm is also expected to lose star guard Rysheed Jordan, according to CBSSports.com.\n\nMullin, a Brooklyn native, won the Big East Player of the Year award three times during his celebrated run at St. John's (1981â€“1985)."
