        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Steve Lavin's hiring as UCLA basketball coach in 1996 was shocking. His firing sure wasn't.\n\nLavin was dismissed Monday after the team's first losing season in 55 years, a move widely anticipated for months by everyone, including Lavin.\n\n``I've been leaning toward this decision over the last several weeks,'' said first-year athletic director Dan Guerrero, who fired his second major coach at the school in 3Â¶ months. ``Can a coach have a bad year? Sure they can, but it's about looking to the future.''\n\nFootball coach Bob Toledo was let go in December after seven years on the job.\n\nLavin went 145-78 in seven years and took the Bruins to the final 16 of the NCAA tournament five times in six years, a feat matched only by Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nLavin's teams won at least 20 games every season except this one.\n\nUCLA went 10-19 overall and 6-12 in Pac-10 play, finishing sixth for the second straight year - its worst-ever conference showing.\n\n``That's not acceptable,'' Guerrero said after a 13-minute campus news conference. ``You need to be consistent throughout the year. You need to finish at the top of your conference.''\n\nLavin fell into the job when Jim Harrick was fired in November 1996 - only a week before the season began and 19 months after the Bruins won their 11th and most recent national championship. Then-AD Peter Dalis had no choice but to promote Lavin from unproven assistant to head coach. Veterans Mark Gottfried and Lorenzo Romar had left for head coaching jobs, leaving Lavin as the No. 1 assistant.\n\n``From the interim days seven years ago to these final days, I think the kids would agree I've been probably very consistent, probably to a fault sometimes,'' Lavin said after coaching his final game Friday. ``I've really been the same for seven years.''\n\nPENN STATE: Jerry Dunn resigned as Penn State's basketball coach Monday following two poor seasons, including a 7-21 finish this year.\n\nHe spent eight years at Penn State, going 117-121 and 45-87 in the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions won just seven games each in his last two seasons.\n\nAt a news conference Monday night, athletic director Tim Curley said Dunn was not asked to resign and that a national search would begin immediately for a successor."
