        "text": "Bluejays will be UConn's first BIG EAST game since 2013\n\nGame #8: #9 Creighton Bluejays at Connecticut Huskies\n\nSunday, Dec. 20, 2020 • 11:00 a.m. CST\n\nHarry A.

Gampel Pavilion (10,167) in Storrs, Conn., is set for 11 a.m. Central.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKOZN (1620 AM) will broadcast all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2020-21 season.

Visit www.gocreighton.com and click on the small bar graph icon on the scoreboard at the top of the page for the event of your choosing.\n\nHome games can also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nScouting No. 9 Creighton\n\nCreighton is ranked ninth nationally in both polls after a 5-2 start that includes convincing wins vs. North Dakota State (69-58), Omaha (94-67), Kennesaw State (93-58), Nebraska (98-74) and St. John's (94-76) as well as a narrow losses to No. 5 Kansas (73-72) and Marquette (89-84).\n\nThe Bluejays return four starters and five of its top six scorers from last season's team that finished 24-7 and won a share of its first BIG EAST regular-season title. CU's 2019-20 team was ranked No. 7 in the year-end Associated Press poll, while this year's club was 11th in the preseason AP poll. Both are program bests for a preseason or postseason poll.\n\nSenior wing Denzel Mahoney (16.2 ppg.) won the BIG EAST's Sixth Man Award last season, while junior forward Christian Bishop (12.3 ppg., 6.0 rpg.) has shot 72.3 percent from the field to lead the league.\n\nPoint guard Marcus Zegarowski (14.7 ppg., 5.7 apg.) has been named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year and is a Preseason All-American by nearly every outlet after averaging 16.1 points and 5.1 assists per game last season. He had a double-double vs. Omaha on Dec. 1 in which he had 11 points and a career-high 11 assists.\n\nCreighton is shooting 51.7 percent from the field, scoring 86.3 points per game and holding foes to 70.7 points per contest.\n\nScouting Connecticut\n\nUConn is 3-0 on the season, but has not played since a 61-58 win vs. USC on December 3rd. The Huskies opened the season with home wins vs. Central Connecticut State (102-75) and Hartford (69-57).\n\nJames Bouknight (18.7 ppg., 6.3 rpg.) is one of the nation's best guards, and he's supported in the scoring column by R.J. Cole (11.0 ppg., 3.7 apg.) and Isaiah Whaley (10.7 ppg., 3.7 bpg.).\n\nThe Huskies average 77.3 points per game and shoot 45.7 percent from the field, 34.4 percent from three-point range and 71.4 percent at the line. The Huskies surrender just 63.3 points per contest and have allowed only 19 assists and 15 three-pointers in three games. UConn also ranks second in the country with 7.0 blocked shots per game.\n\nThe Series With Connecticut\n\nCreighton has never met Connecticut.\n\nGreg McDermott has never met Connecticut.\n\nGreg McDermott is 0-1 all-time in head-to-head meetings vs. Danny Hurley, as Hurley's Rhode Island team defeated Creighton 84-72 in the First Round of the 2017 NCAA Tournament in a game contested in Sacramento, Calif.\n\nMcDermott, however, is 2-0 in road games against Danny's brother Bobby Hurley at Arizona State.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 236-118 record in his 11th season with the Bluejays. He owns a career mark of 516-313 in 27 seasons, and is 385-249 in his 20th Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title last season, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. For those efforts, he was recognized as the BIG EAST Coach of the Year as well as the USBWA District VI Coach of the Year, NABC District 5 Coach of the Year and Basketball Times Midlands District Coach of the Year.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Alan Huss, Paul Lusk and Terrence Rencher.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Creighton would improve to 6-2 on the season with its second road win in four days.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 126-48 all-time (92-36 under Greg McDermott) as a nationally-ranked team.\n\n- Creighton would knock off an unbeaten team for the 11th straight season.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 1-0 all-time vs. UConn.\n\n- Hand UConn their its first BIG EAST loss since March 6, 2013 at South Florida.\n\nHigh-Powered Offense\n\nCreighton leads the BIG EAST and ranks 27th nationally with 86.3 points per game.\n\nThe Bluejays have pumped in 93 or more points in four games this season, one of four teams in the country (Iowa, Coastal Carolina, McNeese State) who can say that. Last year's BIG EAST champion squad only cracked the 93-point barrier three times all season.\n\nCreighton is 46-3 in 11 seasons under Greg McDermott when scoring 93 points or more. By comparison, McDermott's teams scored 93+ points just once in his four seasons at Iowa State (96 on 11/22/09 vs. Mississippi Valley State), and also just once in five years at Northern Iowa (99 on 12/1/04 vs. Iowa State) when doing so.\n\nDouble-Double Duo\n\nCreighton had a pair of players record a double-double in Thursday's victory at St. John's as Christian Bishop (11 points, 10 rebounds) and Damien Jefferson (10 points, 10 rebounds) each had their first double-doubles of the season. It was also Bishop's first career double-double.\n\nBishop and Jefferson were the first Bluejay duo to record double-doubles in the same contest since Dec. 9, 2017, when both Martin Krampelj and Ronnie Harrell Jr. did it.\n\nDame Time\n\nDamien Jefferson came two assists shy of producing Creighton's first traditional triple-double when he posted 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists on Thursday at St. John's.\n\nHis performance made him the only Creighton player in the last 34 seasons with at least 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight or more assists in the same game.\n\nCreighton has had only three triple-doubles in program history, but all three were of the points/rebounds/blocks variety by Benoit Benjamin.\n\nJefferson is just the second Bluejay player with a game of at least eight points, rebounds and assists in 11 seasons under Greg McDermott. Khyri Thomas had 16 points, eight rebounds and eight assists vs. DePaul on Feb. 27, 2018.\n\nHere's a list of Creighton players with at least 7+ points, 7+ rebounds and 7+ assists in the same game since 1987-88.\n\n7+ Point, 7+ Rebound, 7+ Assist Games, Since 1987-88\n\nPts. Reb. Ast. Name Date\n\n16 9 7 Mike Amos 1/30/1993\n\n24 11 7 Rodney Buford 11/18/1998\n\n25 8 8 Ryan Sears 1/8/2000\n\n9 7 10 Grant Gibbs 12/19/2011\n\n12 10 7 Grant Gibbs 1/13/2012\n\n12 7 9 Austin Chatman 11/11/2013\n\n9 7 7 Austin Chatman 1/25/2014\n\n7 9 7 Khyri Thomas 12/9/2015\n\n16 8 7 Maurice Watson Jr. 1/26/2016\n\n14 12 7 Khyri Thomas 2/28/2017\n\n16 8 8 Khyri Thomas 2/27/2018\n\n10 10 8 Damien Jefferson 12/17/2020\n\nBig Ryan's Big Night\n\nFreshman center Ryan Kalkbrenner had a season-high 15 points in just 16 minutes of work on Thursday at St. John's, including four baskets in a three-minute span during the decisive 22-4 second half run.\n\nFor the season, Kalkbrenner has averaged 8.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 1.3 blocked shots while playing just 12.7 minutes per game.\n\nHe ranks fifth in the BIG EAST in field goal percentage (.617), yet third on the Bluejay squad behind Christian Bishop (.723) and Damien Jefferson (.640).\n\nKalkbrenner became CU's first true freshman since Benoit Benjamin (1982-83) to have a blocked shot in each of CU's first three games of the season.\n\nCreighton is 5-0 this year when he makes a field goal, and 0-2 when he does not. The Bluejays are also 5-0 when he blocks a shot, and 0-2 when he does not.\n\nO'Connell Makes Creighton Debut\n\nA vote by the NCAA Division I Council on Dec. 16 made Alex O'Connell immediately eligible. He made his debut one day later at St. John's with six points, two rebounds a steal, and an assist in 12 minutes of action.\n\nA senior guard from Roswell, Ga., O'Connell had not played in Creighton's first six games this season while sitting out after an off-season transfer from Duke University. He had been awaiting a ruling on a waiver that Creighton had filed on his behalf with the NCAA.\n\nWhile at Duke, O'Connell appeared in 101 games, including 14 starts. He contributed 431 points and 182 rebounds for the Blue Devils with single-game highs of 20 points, seven rebounds and four steals.\n\nThough a senior, O'Connell will also be eligible to return to Creighton for the 2021-22 season as a result of a previous NCAA decision that indicated winter sport student-athletes who compete during 2020-21 in Division I will receive both an additional season of competition and an additional year in which to complete it.\n\nLimited Fan Attendance Coming at Home\n\nCreighton University will allow a number of fans to attend men's basketball home games at CHI Health Center Omaha – currently up to 10% of maximum capacity – beginning with the Xavier game on Wednesday, Dec. 23, under a plan approved by the Douglas County Health Department and the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority (MECA).\n\nLimited tickets will be offered to season-ticket holders on a rotating basis utilizing the Creighton Athletics Priority Seating Point System and will be made available (subject to availability) on a game-by-game basis.\n\nAt this time, only select seats and suites (in limited capacity) have been approved for usage. All tickets will be sold digitally on a single-game basis with seat locations that allow for physical distancing.\n\nBucket Getters\n\nDespite a seven-minute drought midway through the first half Creighton still made 38 field goals on Thursday night at St. John's.\n\nThe 38 baskets were the most by the Bluejays in a road game since making 39 hoops on Feb. 13, 2002 at Drake.\n\nAre You Experienced?\n\nYear after year, one common theme to success in college basketball is to have veteran players. This year's Creighton team is full of experienced players.\n\nCU's starting five features two juniors, and three seniors who have combined for 20 years of college experience.\n\nOff the bench, Alex O'Connell and Jacob Epperson are in their fourth college campaign, Antwann Jones in his third year and Shereef Mitchell in his second season. Of the regular Bluejay rotation, only Ryan Kalkbrenner is a freshman.\n\nUConn A Handful\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott has called UConn the best defensive team the Bluejays have faced to date, and his Bluejays will have their hands full on Sunday against the Huskies.\n\nUConn has played three games and allowed just 19 total assists and 15 total three-pointers to this point.\n\nBy comparison, Creighton has made 13 or more three-pointers in each of the last three games (and averages 10.9 treys per game). The Bluejays also average 19.6 assists per contest.\n\nTaking The Show On The Road\n\nThursday's win improved Greg McDermott to 8-3 in CU's first conference road game of the season. That includes a 5-3 mark as a member of the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nThis is the third time that Creighton's first BIG EAST road game came at St. John's. The Bluejays won 80-70 on Dec. 31, 2015 and followed that with an 85-72 win a season later on Jan. 4, 2017. Creighton also defeated SJU 94-76 on Dec. 17, 2020.\n\nMahoney Makes An Impact\n\nThursday's game vs. St. John's was played on Dec. 17 and is the one-year anniversary of Denzel Mahoney's Creighton debut.\n\nMahoney first appeared as a Bluejay on Dec. 17, 2019 with 14 points in a win vs. Oklahoma. In 27 games (7 starts) with CU, he has averaged 12.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game while shooting 83.5 percent from the charity stripe.\n\nCreighton is 21-7 since Mahoney became eligible to play, and 20-7 when Mahoney plays. He has scored in double-figures in 19-of-27 games at CU.\n\nDenzel A Leading Man\n\nCreighton trailed 70-65 with 84 seconds left at Kansas before Denzel Mahoney embarked on a personal 5-0 run to tie the game just 21 seconds later.\n\nMahoney led Creighton with 19 points at Kansas. He upped that to 20 points on Dec. 11 vs. Nebraska before matching his Bluejay best with 21 points vs. Marquette on Monday. He pumped in 16 more at St. John's in a win on Thursday.\n\nIn four career games as a Bluejay against a top-10 opponent, Mahoney has averaged 18.7 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game to help CU to a 3-1 mark. Mahoney has made 53.1 percent (26-49) of his shots from the floor, 45.5 percent (10-22) from three-point range and 100 percent (12-12) at the charity stripe.\n\nFour of his top 10 single-game scoring efforts at CU have come in those four games against top-10 competition.\n\nThursday (Dec. 17) marked the one-year anniversary of his Bluejay debut.\n\nDenzel Mahoney's Top Scoring Games at Creighton\n\nPoints Opponent Date\n\n21 at #8 Villanova 02/01/20\n\n21 Marquette 12/14/20\n\n20 Nebraska 12/11/20\n\n19 at Georgetown 01/15/20\n\n19 at #5 Kansas 12/08/20\n\n18 St. John's 02/08/20\n\n18 at #10 Seton Hall 02/12/20\n\n17 Nebraska-Omaha 12/01/20\n\n16 #8 Seton Hall 03/08/20\n\n16 at St. John's 12/17/20\n\nMarcus, Marcus, Marcus\n\nMarcus Zegarowski continues to excel, even with a target on his back as the Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year.\n\nComparing this season to his past campaigns through seven games, Zegarowski's assists per game, assist/turnover ratio and free-throw percentage are all far better than any previous season.\n\nMarcus Zegarowski - First 7 Games - By Year\n\nYear PPG APG A/TO 3FG% FT%\n\n2018-19 10.1 3.1 22/10 .435 .688\n\n2019-20 18.4 4.0 28/14 .404 .667\n\n2020-21 14.7 5.7 40/17 .412 .714\n\n3's Are Falling\n\nCreighton has made 14, 14 and 13 three-pointers in its past three games, connecting on 41-of-85 triple tries (48.2 percent) in that time.\n\nCreighton is tied for fifth in the country with three different games of 13 three-pointers this year, and the only major conference team to do so.\n\nCreighton is one of three teams with three consecutive games of 13+ three-pointers this season, joining Oral Roberts and The Citadel. No one's done it in four straight games this winter.\n\nCreighton last had made 13 or more three-pointers in three straight games from Jan. 31-Feb. 11, 2017. Creighton has never made 13+ three-pointers in four consecutive contests.\n\nKeying the trey parade has been Mitch Ballock, who has made a three-pointer in 13 straight games, with multiple treys in 11 of those contests. Denzel Mahoney leads the BIG EAST in three-pointers made per game (3.17) and has drained at least three triples in every contest but one this winter.\n\nBallock, Mahoney and Marcus Zegarowski make Creighton one of two teams (along with Liberty) with three players to make 19 or more three-pointers this season. The Flames have played 10 games this year...three more than Creighton.\n\nDon't Forget DJ\n\nDamien Jefferson had a pair of big games against St. John's last season, making 15-of-18 field goal attempts and averaging 18 points per contest. He continued that trend on Thursday when he had 10 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists on 4-of-5 shooting.\n\nJefferson had scored 16 points on 7-of-9 shooting in the first meeting, then sank 8-of-9 shots to match his career-high with 20 points.\n\nJefferson has scored in double-figures in a career-long six straight games, averaging 12.5 ppg. in that period.\n\nBallock Surpasses 250 Treys\n\nMitch Ballock owns 252 three-pointers in his Bluejay career, including eight on Monday vs. Marquette. That puts him in fourth place in program history in that category, passing Ryan Sears (245) for fourth place.\n\nHis 232 career treys entering the year were third-most in school history after a junior season, trailing only Kyle Korver (242) and Ethan Wragge (234).\n\nBallock ranked 19th nationally with 93 three-pointers made and 11th in three-point percentage (.435) last season.\n\nMost Career 3FG, Creighton History\n\nRank 3FG Name Years\n\n1. 371 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n2. 334 Ethan Wragge 2009-14\n\n3. 274 Doug McDermott 2010-14\n\n4. 252 Mitch Ballock 2017-Pres.\n\n5. 245 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n6. 212 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n7. 210 Ty-Shon Alexander 2017-20\n\n8. 206 Jahenns Manigat 2010-14\n\n9. 200 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n10. 185 Matt Roggenburk 1986-90\n\nThe Great Eight\n\nMitch Ballock made nine three-pointers in Creighton's first five games of the season before erupting on Monday vs. Marquette.\n\nThe senior guard from Eudora, Kan., made 8-of-14 three-pointers en route to a season-high 26 points.\n\nHis eight trifectas were tied for fourth-most in a game in Bluejay history, but three behind his record 11 vs. DePaul on March 9, 2019.\n\nBallock joined Kyle Korver as the only players in school history with multiple games of eight or more triples.\n\nIn addition, Ballock's 14 three-point attempts were also tied for fourth-most in program history and one behind the program record.\n\nBallock owns 134 career three-pointers in BIG EAST play, which ranks 36th all-time. That's four more than Lawrence Moten but one behind Kevin Pittsnogle.\n\nBallock's 26 points were the most by a Bluejay in any conference opener since 2012, when Doug McDermott scored 29 points vs. Evansville. That came when CU belonged to the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\n3-Pointers Made, Game, Creighton History\n\n3FG Name, Opponent Date\n\n11 Mitch Ballock vs. DePaul 03/09/19\n\n9 Kyle Korver vs. Evansville 01/15/03\n\nEthan Wragge at Villanova 01/20/14\n\n8 Tad Ackerman at Drake 01/23/95\n\nKyle Korver at Xavier 12/31/02\n\nTerrell Taylor vs. Florida 03/15/02\n\nIsaiah Zierden at DePaul 01/17/16\n\nMitch Ballock vs. Marquette 12/14/20\n\n3-Point Attempts, Game, Creighton History\n\nFGA Name, Opponent Date\n\n15 Terrell Taylor vs. Florida 03/15/02\n\nKyle Korver vs. Fresno State 02/22/03\n\nTy-Shon Alexander vs. Villanova 01/13/19\n\n14 Kyle Korver vs. BYU 12/07/02\n\nKyle Korver at Nebraska 12/21/02\n\nKyle Korver vs. Evansville 01/15/03\n\nEthan Wragge at Villanova 01/20/14\n\nMitch Ballock vs. Marquette 12/14/20\n\nStrong League Start Projects To Postseason\n\nCreighton has started 5-2 or better in league play in six of Greg McDermott's first 10 seasons at the helm.\n\nFive of those teams to start like that reached the NCAA Tournament, while a sixth reached the quarterfinals of the NIT.\n\nEach of Creighton's 14 teams since 1988-89 to start 5-2, 6-1 or 7-0 after seven games in league play have reached the postseason, a stretch that includes nine NCAA Tournaments and five NIT's.\n\nLast year CU started 4-3 in league play, before finishing 13-5, but the postseason was cancelled.\n\nWin The Turnover Battle\n\nCreighton forced Nebraska into 25 turnovers last Friday, picking up 16 steals in the process.\n\nThe 25 turnovers tied the most in any of Greg McDermott's 351 games on the Creighton sideline along with a 2012 game vs. Tulsa.\n\nCreighton's 38 points off Nebraska's 25 turnovers included 11 points in transition.\n\nThe team's 38 points off turnovers were the most since Creighton began tracking points off turnovers for every game starting in 2004-05.\n\nDon't Blink\n\nCreighton pulled away from Nebraska with a 23-2 run in just under a five minute span as its lead went from 55-51 to 78-53.\n\nDuring that stretch, Creighton scored on 10 consecutive possessions.\n\nEach of Creighton's first seven baskets in the flurry were scored by a different player, and the run also featured assists by six different men.\n\nOn Thursday, Creighton buried St. John's with a 22-4 surge in the second half, turning a 52-50 lead into a 74-54 cushion. Thirteen of those points came from the Bluejay bench.\n\nTop 10 Bluejays\n\nAfter starting the year ranked 11th in both the AP and USA Today Coaches polls, Creighton has ascended into the top 10.\n\nCreighton's No. 9 ranking in the AP poll this week marks the 16th time the writers have voted the Bluejays into the top-10. All but one of those times have occurred under Greg McDermott. Creighton's highest AP ranking ever has been No. 7 (Jan. 16, 2017; March 9, 2020; March 16, 2020).\n\nCreighton is one of 10 teams that have been ranked in all 11 AP polls since Feb. 3, 2020, joining Baylor, Duke, Florida State, Gonzaga, Houston, Iowa, Kansas, Tennessee and Villanova.\n\nCreighton has been ranked in the top-10 of the USA Today Coaches poll in 14 different weeks in program history, and is ninth this week. All but one of those weeks have occurred under Greg McDermott. Creighton's best coaches poll ranking ever has been No. 7 (Jan. 16, 2017 and Dec. 7, 2020).\n\nTarget Practice\n\nChristian Bishop has made 34-of-47 shots from the floor this season, good for a BIG EAST-best 72.3 percent. Among the 271 players nationally with 30 or more made field goals through Thursday, Bishop trails only Richmond's Nathan Cavo (72.9%) in field goal percentage.\n\nBishop made 6-of-7 shots vs. NDSU, 7-of-10 attempts vs. Omaha, was 4-for-4 vs. Kennesaw State, 5-for-6 at No. 5 Kansas and 5-for-5 vs. Nebraska. He has made 7-of-15 shots in two league games thus far.\n\nIn Greg McDermott's first 11 years at Creighton, 93 players have attempted 21 or more shots (3 shots/game) over the course of the first seven games of any season. Bishop's 72.3 percent marksmanship is the fourth-best of any of those players in that time. Only Jacob Epperson (81.8% in 2018-19), Justin Patton (80.0% in 2016-17) and Gregory Echenique (72.7% in 2012-13) have been better.\n\nBishop's 23.8 points per 40 minutes is second on the Creighton team this year, trailing only his backup Ryan Kalkbrenner (27.4 ppg. per 40). That's far above Bishop's 18.2 average as a freshman and 16.0 average per 40 minutes last season.\n\nBishop Goes Big\n\nChristian Bishop led Creighton in scoring during each of the first two games, and past history suggest he's in for a big season.\n\nBishop is the fifth Bluejay this century to lead CU in scoring each of the first two games. Each of the other four men would go on to earn First Team All-Conference accolades that season.\n\nThose men include Ty-Shon Alexander (2019-20), Marcus Foster (2017-18), Doug McDermott (2013-14) and Kyle Korver (2002-03). Those four men combined to earn nine First Team All-Conference honors, and three of the four have signed NBA contracts.\n\nBishop has already made quite a statement in the race for the BIG EAST's Most Improved Player award. Here's his year-by-year numbers.\n\nYear PPG RPG BPG FG% FT%\n\n2018-19 4.1 2.1 0.5 .671 .432\n\n2019-20 8.6 5.3 1.1 .592 .579\n\n2020-21 12.3 6.0 0.9 .723 .680\n\nNumber Eleven Goes Up To Eleven\n\nMarcus Zegarowski had his first career double-double on Dec. 1 vs. Omaha when the junior guard who wears No. 11 finished with 11 points and 11 assists.\n\nZegarowski's 11 assists were a career-high and the most by a Bluejay since Maurice Watson Jr. had 14 assists at Providence on Jan. 7, 2017.\n\nZegarowski owns 40 assists through seven games this season. Since 2010-11, the only Bluejay with more assists through seven games was Watson with 59 in 2016-17, and Watson with 43 in 2015-16.\n\nZegarowski is the nation's only player with 100 points, 40 assists, 20 three-pointers and at least 30% shooting from downtown this year.\n\nOn The Double\n\nCreighton has led by double-figures for 73:48-of-120:00 minutes (61.5%) after halftime in home games.\n\nFor the season (all games), Creighton has trailed for just 54:55 of 280 minutes of play (19.6%). At home, CU has trailed for just 28:50 of 200 minutes (14.4%).\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nIn 299 games at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 84 of those contests, a staggering 28.1 percent of the time.\n\nUnder Greg McDermott at home, Creighton is 149-34 and hasn't trailed in 59 of those games.\n\nPreseason Acclaim\n\nJunior guard Marcus Zegarowski was named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year on Oct. 28th. In addition, senior guard Mitch Ballock was also voted as a Preseason Second Team All-BIG EAST performer in the annual survey of league coaches.\n\nThe Bluejays, along with Kansas, are one of six schools with a Watch List candidate for both the Bob Cousy and Jerry West Awards, joining Baylor (MaCio Teague & Jared Butler), Florida State (MJ Walker & Scottie Barnes), Gonzaga (Joel Ayayi & Jalen Suggs), Kansas (Ochai Agbaji & Marcus Garrett) and Villanova (Justin Moore & Collin Gillespie).\n\nZegarowski is Creighton's second player ever named Preseason BIG EAST Player of the Year, joining Doug McDermott (2013-14). McDermott would go on to win BIG EAST Player of the Year honors, as well as 14 National Player of the Year accolades, at season's end.\n\nIn addition, both men have been recognized among the best in the nation at their position. Zegarowski is one of 20 players on the Preseason Watch List for the Bob Cousy Point Guard of the Year Award, and Ballock one of 20 players on the Preseason Watch List for the Jerry West Shooting Guard of the Year Award.\n\nTorn ACL's End Two Seasons Early\n\nCreighton will be without Rati Andronikashvili and Modestas Kancleris during the 2020-21 season after both men tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in their left knee three days apart during practices in early November.\n\nAndronikashvili was injured on Nov. 1, with Kancleris three days last on Nov. 4. The two men, who are roommates, hail from the countries of Georgia and Lithuania, respectively.\n\nOn The Mend\n\nWhen Creighton's 2020-21 season began on November 29th, it had been 716 days since Jacob Epperson's last appearance in a Division I game.\n\nEpperson's last appearance came on Dec. 14, 2018 vs. Green Bay. He would earn a medical hardship for the rest of the 2018-19 season after undergoing knee surgery, then missed all of last year with a broken leg suffered in the preseason.\n\nIn Search of 20\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 20 of the last 22 seasons (entering 2020-21), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the previous 22 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky has done it 21 times. Creighton and Florida have done it 20 times.\n\nMost 20-Win Seasons, Last 22 Years\n\nTeam 20-Win Seasons 2019-20 W-L\n\nGonzaga 22 31-2\n\nKansas 22 28-3\n\nDuke 22 25-6\n\nKentucky 21 25-6\n\nCreighton 20 24-7\n\nFlorida 20 19-12\n\nBallock Surpasses 1,000 Points (Again)\n\nMitch Ballock owns 1,069 career points after surpassing the 1,000 point mark on Nov. 29 vs. North Dakota State in CU's season-opener, which was also his 100th career game.\n\nBallock entered last season's BIG EAST Tournament with 996 points and scored nine points in the first half vs. St. John's on March 12th, but those points were erased when the game was abandoned at halftime.\n\nGames To 1,000 Points, Last 18 Bluejays\n\nName CU Games to 1,000 pts.

Both men were 84.\n\nSutton went 82-50 as Creighton's head coach and athletic director between 1969-74. His 806-329 overall mark in 37 years of coaching ranks 11th on the all-time Division I wins list. In April he was announced as part of the Class of 2020 that will be enshrined into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame -- part of a group that also contains Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant. However, COVID-19 has pushed that induction ceremony back to 2021.\n\nGibson starred in both baseball and basketball with the Bluejays from 1954-57, finishing his college career third with 1,272 career points (he's currently 22nd). He remains in the top-five in CU history in free throws made (418), free throw attempts (575) and scoring average (20.19 ppg.), and his No. 45 basketball jersey is retired. He would play a year with the Harlem Globetrotters before joining the St. Louis Cardinals organization full-time. Gibson is a member of the Hall of Fame's for Creighton Athletics (1968 induction), Missouri Valley Conference (2005) and St. Louis Cardinals (2014), and was honored with a spot on Major League Baseball's All-Century Team in 1999. Gibson was named the best athlete in state history by the Omaha World-Herald in both 2005 and 2015, one spot ahead of Gale Sayers. Tragically, Sayers died nine days before Gibson.\n\nFiring On All Cylinders\n\nLast season Creighton led the BIG EAST with 78.3 points per game, 47.1 percent shooting from the field, 38.6 percent shooting from three-point territory, +8.6 scoring margin, 1.45 assist/turnover ratio and 15.77 assists per game.\n\nIt's early, but this year's team leads the BIG EAST in scoring offense (86.3), field goal percentage (.517), three-point percentage (.398), three-pointers per game (10.86) and assist/turnover ratio (1.93) while ranking second in assists (19.57), steals (7.43) and scoring margin (+15.6).\n\nIn the final KenPom.com ratings, Creighton had the nation's third-best offense.\n\nIt was the fourth different time in the last nine seasons that Creighton has had a top-10 offense per KenPom.\n\nYear Off.

A sixth potential player, Ty-Shon Alexander, played for Creighton last season and recently signed a two-way deal with the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIncluding 2019-20, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 36 of the last 37 years.\n\nKorver ranks fourth in NBA history with 2,450 three-pointers and is 10th in league history with 42.87 percent marksmanship from three-point range. He set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range in 2009-10, and is the only player in league history to lead the NBA in three-point percentage four times. Korver averaged 6.7 points per game last season for the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nTolliver played for the Portland Trail Blazers, Sacramento Kings and Memphis Grizzlies last year, averaging 3.6 points in his 12th NBA season. He owns 4,434 career points, including 861 three-pointers, in the NBA.\n\nMcDermott completed his sixth season in the NBA, and second with the Indiana Pacers, in 2019-20. He averaged a career-high 10.3 points per game last season and is the only player in the NBA to rank in the top-20 in three-point percentage each of the past three seasons.\n\nPatton is on his fifth organization since being the 16th pick in the 2017 NBA Draft by the Chicago Bulls. He appeared in five games last season with Oklahoma City.\n\nThomas was the 38th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers before being traded minutes later to the Detroit Pistons. Thomas was a two-time BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year and has played in 34 career NBA games, contributing 78 points and 21 rebounds.\n\nMcDermott Ranks Second On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott currently has 236 victories at Creighton, good for second place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .667 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A. Schabinger's .714 win rate more 80 years ago.\n\nBelow is a list of the most victorious Creighton coaches in program history.\n\nMost Coaching Wins, Creighton History\n\nRk.

The streak is the nation's 15th-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (12/17)\n\nRk.

Ten of those 20 comebacks have come away from home.\n\nCreighton owns 11 victories since 2000 in which it has won after overcoming a deficit of 15 points or more, as seen below:\n\nOvercoming Double-Digit Deficits, CU Since 2000\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n19 Wichita State 01/28/06\n\n18 #17 Western Kentucky 11/27/01\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 Missouri State 02/12/03\n\n17 DePaul 11/09/07\n\n17 Rhode Island 03/18/08\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 TCU 01/26/03\n\n16 at Drake 02/04/06\n\n16 New Mexico 11/16/08\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n15 Wichita State 02/02/08\n\nCHI Health Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 299 regular and postseason contests at CHI Health Center Omaha all-time in the 18-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 247-52 (.826) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Friday (21-0).\n\nCreighton's Nov. 25, 2017 win over SIU Edwardsville was the program's 200th at the facility, coming in its 242nd home game. CU's 100th win came on Nov. 17, 2010, a 63-58 win over Louisiana.\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 23,453-19,629 in games at CHI Health Center Omaha, an average margin of 12.79 points per game. Creighton has not trailed 84 different times.\n\nCreighton is also 28-31 all-time in the 59 games at the arena in which it's fallen behind by double-figures at any point, 7-11 when down by 10+ points at halftime in the facility, and 35-25 when trailing at halftime at CHI Health Center Omaha.\n\nCreighton is 150-34 (.815) at CHI Health Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including an 87-6 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 266-52 (.836) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#5 Ty-Shon Alexander\n\nG\n\n6' 4\"\n\nJunior\n\n#24 Mitch Ballock\n\nG\n\n6' 5\"\n\nSenior\n\n#13 Christian Bishop\n\nF\n\n6' 7\"\n\nJunior\n\n#41 Jacob Epperson\n\nC\n\n6' 11\"\n\nJunior\n\n#23 Damien Jefferson\n\nF\n\n6' 5\"\n\nSenior\n\n#0 Antwann Jones\n\nG\n\n6' 6\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#34 Denzel Mahoney\n\nG/F\n\n6' 5\"\n\nSenior\n\n#4 Shereef Mitchell\n\nG\n\n6' 0\"\n\nSophomore\n\n#11 Marcus Zegarowski\n\nG\n\n6' 2\"\n\nJunior\n\n#5 Alex O'Connell\n\nG\n\n6' 6\"\n\nSenior"
