        "text": "Eight months into his tenure, St. John’s president Conrado Gempesaw faces his first big decision.\n\nRetain men’s basketball coach Steve Lavin or start over with a new coach?\n\nThe decision seems to be a difficult one.\n\nThough several sources close to the program believe Lavin is on the way out, no confirmation from the school has been given. The staff has yet to be notified of the school’s position. A series of meetings and conversations have taken place among higher-ups at the Queens school that have yet to produce any results, according to sources.\n\n“I think this is the president taking his time to make sure he has all the information and a board that is being overly cautious and wants to make the right decision,” a source connected to the program said.\n\nBut the silence in recent days has come as a surprise to some, considering Lavin or the next coach need to get to work on filling out a roster with the senior core moving on and few reinforcements in house or on the way. On Saturday, Lavin expressed optimism he would not only be back, but receive a contract extension.\n\nThere is also a potential buyout that has to be negotiated. Lavin is due between $1.6 million and $1.8 million, a source said. During the Big East Tournament, the school said it would be evaluating Lavin after the season finished.\n\n“This is probably a decision that should’ve been made in January or February,” the source said. “This shouldn’t be a decision that was based on what happened in March. It should be based on a five-year period of his tenure.\n\n“Either we want to invest five more years in him or start over. It’s pretty simple.”\n\nIn the meantime, Lavin has reached out to television networks to gauge their interest should he be let go, sources said. He worked for ESPN as a college basketball analyst for seven years before taking the St. John’s job.\n\nLavin’s five years at St. John’s have been a mixed bag. He has raised the profile of the program and landed nationally ranked recruits. He reached two NCAA Tournaments — before his arrival St. John’s was without a berth in the tournament for nine years — compiled three 20-win seasons and went 81-55 overall, 40-32 in the Big East.\n\nHis postseason record, however, is a dismal 2-8 and his teams are a combined 6-13 in March, the sport’s all-important month. In recent weeks, he has talked about how different the team would be had Moe Harkless and Jakarr Sampson never left early for the NBA, which underscores his inability to replace them.\n\nThere have been off-the-court issues and eligibility problems. Of the three players he signed in his 2014 recruiting class, only one qualified, contributing to a razor-thin roster. His only functioning big man, Chris Obekpa, was suspended for the NCAA Tournament opener against San Diego State for testing positive for marijuana use, crippling the Johnnies’ chances of advancing.\n\nThe future is uncertain if Lavin is retained. Seniors D’Angelo Harrison, Phil Greene IV, Sir’Dominic Pointer and Jamal Branch graduate, while Obekpa and sophomore Rysheed Jordan may not return. Those six received the majority of the minutes this year. Lavin has talked about how important the 2015 recruiting class is, and yet he has just one committed impact player, four-star guard Brandon Sampson of Louisiana.\n\n— Additional reporting by Howie Kussoy"
