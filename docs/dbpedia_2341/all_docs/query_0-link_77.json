        "text": "Just two days after leaving Texas, Rick Barnes has landed at Tennessee.\n\nThe Volunteers announced the hiring Tuesday, calling Barnes an “elite basketball coach in every respect.” The agreement is for six years at $2.25 million annually. The school scheduled an afternoon news conference.\n\nBarnes succeeds Donnie Tyndall, who was fired Friday after one season amid an NCAA investigation of his two years at Southern Mississippi.\n\nBarnes went 402-180 in 17 seasons at Texas and reached the NCAA Tournament in 16 of his 17 seasons, including a Final Four appearance in 2003. Texas announced his departure Sunday, saying it was a mutual decision. Barnes said at his farewell news conference he was given the choice of firing his staff or being fired himself.\n\nThe 60-year-old Barnes is 604-314 in 28 seasons overall with stops at George Mason, Providence and Clemson. He has reached the NCAA Tournament in 19 of his last 20 seasons.\n\nTennessee Athletic Director Dave Hart said he fired Tyndall for cause after determining the NCAA would likely find the coach committed major violations while at Southern Mississippi from 2012-14. Tyndall went 16-16 in his lone season at Tennessee.\n\nAlthough Barnes’ only Southeastern Conference experience came during a brief stint as an Alabama assistant in 1985-86, he has some familiarity with the area. He grew up in Hickory, N.C., about 200 miles east of Tennessee’s Knoxville campus.\n\nBarnes takes over a Tennessee program that has gone at least as far as the NCAA regional semifinals four of the last nine seasons despite encountering plenty of recent coaching turnover.\n\nBruce Pearl was fired in 2011 amid an NCAA investigation after leading Tennessee to NCAA Tournament appearances in each of his six seasons. Pearl was replaced by Cuonzo Martin, who left for California after earning one NCAA invitation and two spots in the NIT in his three seasons. Tyndall took over for Martin.\n\nSOURCE: MULLIN WILL TAKE OVER AT ST. JOHN’S: St. John’s has decided its basketball future rests with the best of its past.\n\nChris Mullin, St. John’s all-time leading scorer and still the face of its basketball program three decades after his career ended, has agreed to coach the Red Storm, a person with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity because there was no formal announcement.\n\nMullin, who led St. John’s to the Final Four in 1985, has never coached at any level. He replaces Steve Lavin, who agreed to leave last week after five seasons during which the Red Storm reached the NCAA Tournament twice.\n\nMullin, a New York native, was a five-time All-Star with Golden State, a member of the USA’s gold-medal winning “Dream Team” in 1992 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. He was presented for induction by his coach at St. John’s, Hall of Famer Lou Carnesecca.\n\nALABAMA AD LEAVES WICHITA WITHOUT AGREEMENT WITH MARSHALL: Alabama Athletic Director Bill Battle is not in Kansas anymore — at least for now.\n\nBattle spent nearly eight hours Monday in Wichita, presenting Alabama’s offer to hire Wichita State Coach Gregg Marshall, the top candidate for the vacant Crimson Tide job.\n\nBattle departed Wichita without commenting to media gathered at the airport, returning to Birmingham, Ala., by private plane. Marshall remained in Wichita, apparently contemplating the offer, on Monday night. There is no timetable for a decision, which could come today or later in the week.\n\nThe Alabama position has been vacant since Anthony Grant was fired on March 15.\n\nOKLAHOMA STATE MULLING FIRING FORD: The Oklahoma State Cowboys are considering the possibility of firing Coach Travis Ford after being ousted in the first round of the NCAA Tournament for the third straight year, sources confirmed to ESPN.com’s Jeff Goodman.\n\nThe chance of Ford being fired is “50-50,” one source close to the situation said.\n\nThe move would trigger a buyout worth at least $9.6 million, according to The Oklahoman, which reported the amount as the remainder of Ford’s contract.\n\nBUTLER COACH GETS UPDATED DEAL: Butler Coach Chris Holtmann has a new contract that could keep him with the Bulldogs through the 2020-21 season.\n\nHoltmann replaced Brandon Miller last fall after Miller took a medical leave for undisclosed reasons. When Miller did not return in January, the school removed the interim tag from Holtmann’s title.\n\nThe 43-year-old former Gardner-Webb coach helped Butler rebound from a 14-17 mark in 2013-14 to 23-11, a second-place finish in the Big East and an NCAA Tournament victory in the Round of 64."
