CU has not trailed at any point of its last four home games, double-figure victories over Nebraska (83-67), IUPUI (90-65), North Texas (105-82) and Coppin State (102-77).\n\nThe Bluejays are scoring an impressive 87.4 points per game (seventh nationally), with all five starters averaging at least 9.8 in points per game.\n\nBoston University transfer Maurice Watson Jr. leads Creighton with 6.4 assists per contest and 12.5 points per game, while Geoffrey Groselle tops the club with 6.9 rebounds per game and is second with 12.2 points per contest. He's made 16-of-17 field goals in the past two games.\n\nAlso at or near double-figures are remaining starters Cole Huff (11.5 ppg.), Isaiah Zierden (11.4 ppg., 1.5 spg.) and Khyri Thomas (9.8 ppg.).\n\nThe Bluejays return nine lettermen and one starter (Toby Hegner) from last year's team that finished 14-19 and tied for ninth in the BIG EAST with a 4-14 league mark.\n\nThe Bluejays got a head start on the season this summer with 10 practices in Omaha in July and three games in Italy in August.\n\nScouting St. John's\n\nSt. John's is 7-6 on the season, including a 6-2 mark at home (5-2 at Carnesecca Arena), but have lost three in a row (Incarnate Word, NJIT and South Carolina ) heading into league play since a win over Syracuse.\n\nFreshman Federico Mussini leads the Red Storm in scoring (14.0 ppg.), assists (2.7 apg.) and steals (1.3 spg.) per game, while also draining a team-high 30 three-point baskets and topping the club in free-throw percentage (.829).\n\nDurand Johnson, a graduate transfer from Pitt, is second on the team with 11.6 points per contest, 16 steals and 19 three-point baskets.\n\nThree others average in the neighborhood of eight points a game, Ron Mvouika (8.8 ppg.), Christian Jones (8.5 ppg.) and Yankuba Sima (8.4 ppg.). Sima is tied for the national lead with 46 blocked shots.\n\nSJU had all five starters depart from last year's NCAA Tournament team that finished 21-12.\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) is in his sixth season as head coach at Creighton. He is 130-61 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 410-256 in his 22nd season and is 279-192 in his 15th Division I campaign. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Preston Murphy.\n\nChris Mullin (St. John's, 1998) owns a 7-6 record in his first season at St. John's, which also doubles as his career mark. The three-time BIG EAST Player of the Year and NBA Hall of Famer, who led St. John's to the 1985 Final Four, returned to his alma mater in the spring in place of Steve Lavin. Mullin is assisted by Barry Rohrssen, Matt Abdelmassih and Greg St. Jean.\n\nThe Series With St. John's\n\nSt. John's leads the all-time series with Creighton by a 7-4 count, including a 6-0 mark in New York.\n\nThe teams have traded wins and losses over the past seven meetings, and if the trend holds, Creighton will win on Thursday.\n\nGreg McDermott is 2-2 against St. John's and has never faced Chris Mullin.\n\nEve of Destruction\n\nBefore celebrating the New Year (in Omaha, after chartering home after Thursday's game), Creighton will first play at St. John's at 2:15 pm Eastern on Dec. 31st.\n\nCreighton lost seven straight New Year's Eve games from 1956 to 2005, but enters Thursday having won three of its last four since, with wins on Dec. 31 in 2008 (at Indiana State), 2011 (at Wichita State) and 2013 (home vs. Marquette) before last year's loss (at Providence).\n\nGreg McDermott is 6-1 as a Division I head coach on New Year's Eve, including a 2-0 record at both Northern Iowa and Iowa State and a 2-1 mark on New Year's Eve as Creighton coach.\n\nConference Openers Have Gone Well\n\nCreighton owns a 12-5 record in its last 17 conference openers, including a 67-49 win over Marquette on New Year's Eve in 2013 in its first BIG EAST game in program history.\n\nGreg McDermott is 7-7 all-time in conference openers as a Division I head coach, including a 3-2 mark at Creighton (1-1 in the BIG EAST). He is 4-1 in CU's first conference road game of the season.\n\nSt. John's has lost its first BIG EAST game, as well as its first BIG EAST home game, in three straight seasons since a Dec. 27, 2011 win over Providence in Queens.\n\nCreighton is looking to avoid starting 0-1 in league play during consecutive seasons for the first time since 1993-94 and 1994-95.\n\nOpening On The Road\n\nThursday marks just the sixth time in the last 21 seasons that Creighton will open league play away from home. The previous five games have seen the Bluejays produce a 3-2 record.\n\nThursday will mark the first time that Creighton has played league openers on the road in back-to-back seasons since 1994-95 and 1995-96.\n\nMaking An Entrance\n\nMarlon Stewart, Khyri Thomas, Ronnie Harrell Jr., Cole Huff, Malik Albert and Maurice Watson Jr. could each play in their first career BIG EAST game on Thursday.\n\nBelow is a listing of the 14 men to debut in the BIG EAST with a game of 25 or more points.\n\nMOST POINTS - FIRST BIG EAST GAME\n\n41 Steve Novak, Marquette vs. UConn, 1-3-06\n\n32 Moe Harkless, St. John's vs. PC, 12-27-11\n\n30 Troy Murphy, Notre Dame vs. PC, 12-8-98\n\nAllen Iverson, Georgetown vs. PC, 12-7-94\n\n29 Caron Butler, Connecticut vs. BC, 1-3-01\n\nKhalid El-Amin, Connecticut vs. WVU, 12-3-97\n\nTim Thomas, Villanova vs. PC, 12-4-96\n\n28 Troy Bell, Boston College vs. PC, 1-8-00\n\nJeremy Hazell, Seton Hall vs. UConn, 1-3-08\n\n26 Seldon Jefferson, WVU vs. Georgetown, 12-2-95\n\nLawrence Moten, Syracuse vs. BC, 1-2-92\n\n25 Craig Smith, Boston College vs. PC, 1-2-03\n\nJerome Coleman, Rutgers vs. Syracuse, 1-2-02\n\nSteve Rich, Miami vs. Syracuse, 12-22-93\n\nLooking For The First\n\nThough Creighton's completed just two full BIG EAST seasons, there's only three road sites in the league that it has not yet picked up a conference road win.\n\nCreighton is winless in two trips to St. John's (both at Madison Square Garden), two trips to Providence, and two trips to Georgetown.\n\nCreighton is 2-0 at DePaul, and 1-1 at the other five league schools.\n\nCreighton is 0-6 all-time in road games against St. John's, including four games during the 1960's long before the BIG EAST was formed.\n\nStandard Five\n\nCreighton has used the same starting line-up in every game this season, and they're not the only BIG EAST team that can say so.\n\nJoining the Bluejays with a familiar starting five every game have been Butler, Georgetown and Xavier.\n\nCentury Mark Back-to-Back\n\nCreighton scored 105 points on Dec. 21st against North Texas, then had 102 more on Monday vs. Coppin State.\n\nCreighton had not scored 100 points or more in consecutive games since Jan. 29 (104 at Idaho State) and Feb. 2 (115 vs. Memphis) during the 1965-66 season, and had not scored 100 points twice in the same month since February of 1990. Creighton has not scored 100+ points three times in the same month since January of 1966.\n\nCreighton has never scored 100 points in three straight games, and has not scored 100 or more points in a road game since Dec. 18, 1989 in a 106-86 win at UMKC.\n\nSpeaking of 100\n\nCreighton has scored 100 points or more in three different games this season. It's the fourth different season in program history it's done that, and first time since 1989-90's squad did it three times.\n\nThe 1965-66 team cracked the century mark seven times, while the 1971-72 club reached triple-digits five times.\n\nThe Fast And The Furious\n\nCreighton has 165 fast break points already this winter. By comparison, last year Creighton had a total of 143 fast break points (4.3 per game), and never had more than 11 in any contest.\n\nCreighton had a whopping 30 fast break points in its Nov. 14 win over Texas Southern, added 24 more on Nov. 17 vs. UTSA.\n\nCreighton's 30 fast break points are believed to be its most since moving to CenturyLink Center Omaha in 2003, with the next highest mark on file (before Texas Southern on Nov. 14) was listed as 24 vs. Kennesaw State on Nov. 26, 2010.\n\nBalance Is Key\n\nHere's a look at how Creighton has done statistically after 13 games in recent seasons.\n\nOf note, Creighton has started 8-5 or better after 13 games in 18 of the past 19 seasons.\n\nThis year's team, with four double-figure scorers, is the first time since 1994-95 that Creighton has had more than three players scoring in double-figures after 13 games.\n\nCreighton's 87.4 points per game clip is the team's highest mark after 13 games not just in 20 years, but in history. Creighton's single-season record is 88.2 points per game in 1965-66, though that team was averaging 85.5 points per game after 13 contests.\n\nCreighton's 50.6 percent field goal percentage through 13 games is the third-best mark in the last 20 years, trailing only the 2002-03 and 2012-13 teams that were led by Kyle Korver and Doug McDermott, respectively.\n\nCreighton's 121 three-pointers through 13 games are tied for its second-most in the last 20 years, as well.\n\nYear W-L PPG FG% 3FG 10+ PPG guys\n\n2015-16 9-4 87.4 .506 121 4\n\n2014-15 9-4 72.2 .431 116 2\n\n2013-14 11-2 81.7 .485 149 2\n\n2012-13 12-1 79.5 .508 119 2\n\n2011-12 11-2 83.1 .501 119 2\n\n2010-11 9-4 67.1 .431 89 3\n\n2009-10 5-8 70.3 .441 101 2\n\n2008-09 11-2 76.2 .446 112 3\n\n2007-08 10-3 75.3 .460 104 2\n\n2006-07 8-5 66.8 .429 73 2\n\n2005-06 9-4 70.4 .424 98 3\n\n2004-05 9-4 68.8 .431 103 2\n\n2003-04 12-1 71.4 .465 81 1\n\n2002-03 12-1 82.4 .510 121 1\n\n2001-02 8-5 77.1 .451 78 3\n\n2000-01 10-3 75.2 .441 100 3\n\n1999-00 9-4 71.2 .453 103 2\n\n1998-99 10-3 76.4 .465 106 2\n\n1997-98 8-5 75.6 .468 91 2\n\n1996-97 5-8 64.4 .397 70 2\n\n1995-96 6-7 64.8 .391 71 2\n\n1994-95 5-8 64.0 .389 84 4\n\nOn Your Mark, Get Set, Go\n\nCreighton has averaged 87.4 points per game in its first 13 regular-season contests to date.\n\nSt. John's is 1-6 when allowing 74 points or more this winter.\n\nGreg McDermott is 35-0 as a Division I head coach when his teams score 90 or more points, including a 29-0 mark on the Creighton sideline.\n\nIn fact, McDermott's team has already scored 90 or more points eight times (in 13 games) this season, compared to six total times in 280 games on the sideline in nine years at Northern Iowa and Iowa State.\n\nCreighton has won 73 straight games when scoring 90 or more points at all sites since a Jan. 11, 1988 loss to Southern Illinois.\n\nCreighton is 52-2 all-time when scoring 100 points or more, including 24 straight wins since a 1977 loss to North Texas State.\n\nThe Link Turns Into The Dunk Tank\n\nCreighton has put down 32 dunks in 13 regular-season games as a unit this year. By comparison, Creighton had 29 dunks in 33 games all last season.\n\nSeven different men have thrown down a dunk this winter, led by 10 each from Khyri Thomas and Geoffrey Groselle.\n\nSo Many Weapons\n\nCreighton had seven players score in double-figures in Monday's win over Coppin State, as Geoffrey Groselle (16), Isaiah Zierden (16), Cole Huff (14), Malik Albert (13), Khyri Thomas (10), Maurice Watson Jr. (10) and Zach Hanson (10) all had 10 or more points.\n\nIt was the first time since at least 1980-81 that Creighton has had seven men score 10 or more points in the same game.\n\nIt's also the first time since Nov. 21, 2010 that all five Bluejay starters scored in double-figures in the same contest.\n\nAlbert's 13 points were a season-high, and make him the 11th different Bluejay with score 10 or more points in a game this season.\n\nGuarded Optimism\n\nCreighton's starting backcourt of Maurice Watson Jr., Khyri Thomas and Isaiah Zierden combined for 17 assists and one turnover in the win over Coppin State. That trio also made 7-of-9 three-point baskets.\n\nFor the season, Watson, Thomas and Zierden have combined for 33.7 points per game and are shooting a combined 53-for-116 from three-point range (45.7 percent) while owning a combined 145/61 (2.38) assist/turnover ratio.\n\nOffensive-Minded\n\nCreighton ranks seventh nationally in scoring offense, averaging 87.4 points per game. Five of the nation's top nine teams in scoring offense are also ranked in the top-15 in this week's AP poll.\n\nNational Scoring Offense Leaders (through 12/28)\n\nRk. Team PPG AP Rank\n\n1.

The streak is the 23rd-longest active streak.\n\nCreighton's last win without making a three-point basket came on March 3, 1991 when the Jays went 0-for-2 from three-point range in a 71-66 win over Southern Illinois in the championship game of the MVC Tournament.\n\nCreighton's streak of games with at least 15 trey attempts stands at 89, which is second-longest nationally.\n\nCourtesy Stats Inc., below is a list of the nation's longest active three-point streaks, through games of Dec. 28.\n\nLongest Active 3-Point Streaks (thru 12/28)\n\nRk.

The triumph helped McDermott pass Eddie Hickey for fifth in Creighton history in wins.\n\nNineteen days later on Dec. 28, McDermott tied Tom Apke (1974-81), who had 130 wins for fourth place on the wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .681 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A.

Both Sears and Young got there as seniors.\n\nSpeaking Of Watson\n\nMaurice Watson Jr. had 29 assists and 19 turnovers in Creighton's first five games, but he's taken better care of the ball since the team's return from Las Vegas in late November.\n\nSince then, Watson has 54 assists and 13 turnovers.\n\nOverall, Watson's 2.59 assist/turnover ratio this year ranks sixth in the BIG EAST (min. 2.5 assists per game), and his career ratio (including Boston) of 2.20 assists per turnover ranks sixth-best nationally among active players with 400 or more career assists.\n\nThat ratio ranks better that such highly-touted point guards such as Marcus Paige (2.13), Nic Moore (2.11), Ryan Arcidiacono (2.04), Yogi Ferrell (2.02) and Kris Dunn (1.84).\n\nDouble R's, Double L's, Double-Double Harrell\n\nWith Toby Hegner and Martin Krampelj out of the line-up, Ronnie Harrell Jr. took advantage of an opportunity to play extended minutes on Dec. 21 vs. North Texas.\n\nHarrell, who entered the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds, four assists and two steals in his first six career games, had career-highs with 14 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and two steals against the Mean Green.\n\nHarrell became the first Creighton freshman with a double-double since Doug McDermott had 31 points and 10 rebounds against Davidson in the 2011 CBI.\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over as coach six years ago, the only other Creighton player with at least 14 points, 11 rebounds and five or more assists was Austin Chatman. Chatman had 17 points, 11 rebounds and six assists in Creighton's 65-63 win over Oklahoma on Nov. 19, 2014.\n\nBig Men In The Middle\n\nGeoffrey Groselle and Zach Hanson were a big part of Creighton's 105-82 romp over North Texas on Dec. 21, as both men went for career-highs and combined for 40 points on 14-of-15 shooting from the floor, adding five blocked shots.\n\nGroselle's 27 points were seven more than his previous best and came on 8-of-9 shooting from the floor and 11-of-14 free throw marksmanship.\n\nHanson's 13 points were two more than his previous best. He was a perfect 6-for-6 from the floor and also 1-for-2 at the line.\n\nThe duo continued their effectiveness on Monday vs. Coppin State. Groselle was a perfect 8-for-8 from the floor and added nine rebounds, while Hanson was 3-for-4 from the floor. Both men added two blocked shots.\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nCreighton has averaged 93.8 points per game at home this season. CU has shot 50 percent or better in all eight games, and 54.6 percent overall.\n\nCreighton is also shooting 42.3 percent from three-point land at home, and has made 10 or more trifectas in six of the eight contests.\n\nMaking the high-octane offense all the more impressive is that the team is doing it while averaging just 10.5 turnovers per game, slightly more than the team's 10.0 three-pointers per contest.\n\nDynamite Starts For Newcomers\n\nA pair of newcomers are among Creighton's leading scorers through 13 games, as Cole Huff has 149 points and Maurice Watson Jr. has 162.\n\nSince 1995-96, Watson's figure leads all Creighton newcomers through 13 games, five more than Doug McDermott's 157 points.\n\nMcDermott would finish his career with 3,150 in 145 career games to rank fifth in NCAA history.\n\nKhyri Thomas owns 128 points to date. CU's only other freshmen since 1995-96 to score 128 points or more after 13 games are McDermott, P'Allen Stinnett, Rodney Buford and Ryan Sears all of whom would go on to be named MVC Freshman of the Year.\n\nMost Points, Newcomers First 13 Games Since 1995-96\n\nPts.

Watson had six such games at Boston University in his first two years as a collegian.\n\nWatson is the first Bluejay with two games of 10 or more assists in the same season since Austin Chatman had two in 2012-13.\n\nSince 2001-02, the only Bluejay with more than two games of 10+ assists in the same year has been Grant Gibbs, who had three such games in 2011-12.\n\nKhyri Lets It Fly\n\nKhyri Thomas had the best scoring game of his young career on Dec. 5 when he poured in 22 points at Loyola (Chicago). Thomas sank 9-of-10 shots from the field, and was 4-for-4 from three-point range.\n\nThomas' 22 points were the most by a Bluejay freshman in a game since Doug McDermott had 31 vs. Davidson on March 21, 2011, and the most points by a Creighton freshman in a true road game since Rodney Buford also scored 22 points at Wichita State on Feb. 3, 1996.\n\nThomas' 90 percent marksmanship from the field was the second-best single-game showing by a Bluejay (minimum 8 FG) since 1994, trailing only an 11-for-11 outing from Anthony Tolliver vs. Illinois State on Jan. 1, 2007.\n\nThomas' 4-for-4 showing from three-point range was the most makes without a miss from downtown since Devin Brooks also went 4-for-4 from deep on Nov. 28, 2013 vs. Arizona State.\n\nCreighton hasn't had a player go 5-for-5 (or better) from three-point range since Michael Lindeman was 5-for-5 vs. Bradley on Feb. 8, 2003.\n\nThomas had made 11 of his last 14 three-point attempts and 14-of-21 overall. He leads the BIG EAST in three-point percentage (66.7 percent).\n\nTriple Threat\n\nKhyri Thomas entered the Dec. 9 game vs. Nebraska with five total assists in Creighton's first eight games, but the freshman guard would match that total in the first 14 minutes, and tallied seven helpers overall.\n\nThomas finished with seven points, seven assists and nine rebounds against the Cornhuskers. He is just the third Bluejay in Greg McDermott's six-year tenure to post at least seven points, seven rebounds and seven assists in the same game, joining Austin Chatman and Grant Gibbs. Both Chatman and Gibbs did it twice each.\n\nCreighton has never had a traditional point/rebound/assist triple-double.\n\n7+ Point, 7+ Rebound, 7+ Assist Games, Since 2010-11\n\nPts. Reb. Ast.

He scored 26 points in the victory over Rutgers before a 12-point effort over UMass in the title game.\n\nWhat's Your Twenty?\n\nCreighton has had five different players score 20 points or more this season, as Isaiah Zierden, Cole Huff, Maurice Watson Jr., Khyri Thomas and Geoffrey Groselle (twice) have all reached that mark.\n\nBy comparison, last year Creighton had five players all year reach 20+ points (Austin Chatman, James Milliken, Toby Hegner, Will Artino and Zierden), and in the two previous years had only three players surpass 20 points in any game.\n\nThomas Makes History\n\nKhyri Thomas opened his Creighton career with 18 points in a win over Texas Southern, which earned him BIG EAST Freshman of the Week honors on Nov. 16th.\n\nThomas is the first Bluejay in program history to be named BIG EAST Freshman of the Week.\n\nCreighton's last player to be named league Freshman/Newcomer of the Week following the first week of the season was Doug McDermott on Nov. 15, 2010, when CU was in the Missouri Valley Conference. McDermott would go on to be named First-Team All-MVC and, MVC Newcomer of the Year and MVC Freshman of the Year.\n\nAmong The Best\n\nSince the start of the 2010-11 season, which coincides with Greg McDermott's arrival, Creighton has been the nation's third-most accurate team from three-point range.\n\nThe Bluejays are 1614-4097 from deep in that time, shooting 39.4 percent from deep in that span.\n\nBest 3FG%, Since 2010-11\n\nRk.

The Detroit native responded in a big way, finishing with 10 assists in 20 minutes of work. The 10 assists led to 28 points from his Bluejay teammates.\n\nIn the process, Albert became the nation's third reserve with 10 or more assists in 20 minutes or less in a win against a Division I team since 2010-11. He joins Kansas's Naadir Tharpe (12 assists in 20 minutes vs. American on Dec. 29, 2012) and Louisiana Tech's Kenneth Smith (10 assists in 20 minutes on Nov. 20, 2013 vs. Central Arkansas).\n\nPer STATS Inc., Albert became the second BIG EAST reserve since 2004-05 with 10+ assists in 20 minutes or less against a Division I team, joining Marquette's Maurice Acker (12/28/08 vs. Presbyterian).\n\nAlbert is Creighton's only player in the last 30 years to have a game of 10 or more assists as a reserve.\n\nBig Margin Can Lead To Big Things\n\nCreighton's 104-77 win last year vs. Central Arkansas was the second straight season the team has cracked triple-digits in a season-opener.\n\nThe 2015-16 season saw Creighton reach 90 points in each of its first two games this season, just the fourth time that's happened. Each of the previous three times (1973-74, 2011-12, 2013-14), the Bluejays would reach the NCAA Tournament and then win at last one game in the Big Dance.\n\nNine of Creighton's 19 all-time NCAA Tournament teams have scored 90 or more points in their season-opener.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's last eight teams to score 90 or more in a season-opener, which shows that six of the previous seven to do so reached the NCAA Tournament.\n\nFinal Post-\n\nScore Opponent Date W-L Season\n\n93-70 Texas Southern 11/14/15 ? ? ? ? ? ?\n\n104-77 Central Arkansas 11/14/14 14-19 --\n\n107-61 Alcorn State 11/08/13 27-8 NCAA\n\n97-65 N.

Both McDermott (145 games) and Sears (124) started every contest of their four-year Creighton careers.\n\nPreseason BIG EAST Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to finish ninth in its third season as BIG EAST Conference members according to a preseason poll of league coaches. Villanova was picked first with 81 points and nine first-place votes, while Georgetown (70, 1), Butler (67), Xavier (55) and Providence (45) round out the top half. The predicted lower half was Marquette (44), Seton Hall (27), DePaul (25), Creighton (23) and St. John's (13).\n\nCreighton did not have any honorees on the Preseason All-BIG EAST Teams, which was led by Preseason Player of the Year Kris Dunn from Providence.\n\nZierden Returns From Second Knee Injury\n\nIsaiah Zierden had 15 points on Nov. 14 after missing the second half of last season after suffering a season-ending injury to his right knee for the second straight campaign.\n\nZierden was carried off the floor with 4:05 left in the first half on Jan. 21, 2015 at Butler and did not return.\n\nAn MRI two days later determined that Zierden partially tore the MCL in his knee, while also suffering an injury to his patella.\n\nUnlike his first injury, Zierden elected to have surgery this time around, as he underwent a medical procedure in Washington, D.C., on Feb. 13, 2015.\n\nThe uncommon injury is very similar to one he suffered the previous March at Xavier, which caused him to miss CU's last seven games.\n\nZierden's 15 points and four assists vs. Texas Southern were both second-most on the team.\n\nHe did even better on Nov. 17 vs. UTSA, scoring a career-high 24 points in 23 minutes.\n\nNBA Representation\n\nThis year marks the second time since 1970 (joining last season) that Creighton has three NBA players at the same time, as Kyle Korver (Atlanta Hawks), Anthony Tolliver (Detroit Pistons) and Doug McDermott (Chicago Bulls) are all in the league.\n\nIncluding 2015-16, Creighton has now had an NBA player in 32 of the last 33 years.\n\nKorver ranks ninth in NBA history with 1,788 three-pointers and is also eighth in league history with 43.1 percent marksmanship from three-point range (through Dec. 28). He owns NBA records with 127 straight games with a three-pointer, and also set a single-season NBA mark that still stands with his 53.6 percent shooting from three-point range. Last season he was named an All-Star and led the league in three-point percentage for the third time.\n\nTolliver is averaging 4.6 points per game this season for the Pistons, his 10th NBA organization.\n\nMcDermott is in his second season with the Chicago Bulls, where he's averaging 8.8 points per game and shoots 42.4 percent from three-point range for fellow Ames High alum Fred Hoiberg. Hoiberg, ironically, is the same man who replaced Greg McDermott as Iowa State's head coach in 2010.\n\nGoing For 20, Again\n\nCreighton has won 20 or more games in 15 of the last 17 seasons (including 2014-15), a feat that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust three schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 17 years: Duke, Gonzaga and Kansas.\n\nKentucky , Florida, Texas and Syracuse have each done it in 16 of the last 17 seasons.\n\nAlong with Arizona, Xavier, Kent State and Connecticut, Creighton is one of five schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 15 of the past 17 years.\n\nFull House\n\nLast year's Creighton team averaged 17,048 fans in 17 home dates, good for sixth-nationally, and better than 11 NBA franchises.\n\nIt's the 10th straight season that CU has been among the nation's top 25 in average home attendance, and the fourth straight season in the top-six nationally in attendance, as well.\n\nLast year Creighton was the nation's first team to average 17,000+ fans, despite a losing record, since Louisville in 2000-01.\n\nThis year's team is averaging 16,840 fans per game after seven home dates, which ranks seventh nationally through Dec. 28.\n\n2015-16 Attendance Leaders\n\nRk.

While respectable, that pales in comparison to CU's 66-10 (.868) mark the last five years when shooting better than 40.00 percent from downtown.\n\nLower the standards to 30%, and it's still impressive. Creighton is 95-24 in the last five years when shooting 30 percent or better from deep, compared to 12-20 when shooting 29.99 percent or less.\n\nNCAA Success\n\nCreighton is one of 18 schools to have won an NCAA Tournament game in at least three of the last four seasons.\n\nGonzaga, Kansas, Louisville, Michigan State and North Carolina are the only five teams to have won at least one game all four seasons.\n\nThe list of teams with an NCAA win in three of the last four campaigns consists of Arizona, Creighton, Florida, Iowa State, Kentucky, North Carolina State, Ohio State, Oregon, Saint Louis, San Diego State, Syracuse, Wichita State and Wisconsin.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 211 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in the 13-year-old facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own a 177-34 (.839) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (10-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 16,097-13,572 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.97 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 58 different times, including six times this year (UTSA, Western Illinois, Nebraska, IUPUI, North Texas and Coppin State).\n\nCreighton is also 25-19 all-time in the 44 games at CLCO in which it's fallen behind by double-figures.\n\nCreighton is 80-16 (.833) at CenturyLink Center Omaha under Greg McDermott, including a 47-4 record vs. non-conference teams.\n\nFactor in a 17-0 home mark at the Omaha Civic Auditorium in 2002-03 and two wins at the Civic in the 2010 CIT, and the Bluejays are 196-34 (.852) at home since the start of the 2002-03 campaign.\n\nBig Deficits, No Big Deal\n\nCreighton owns 14 victories under Greg McDermott after trailing by double-figures at some point, including three games last year, and seven such comebacks away from home.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 2014, Creighton trailed 42-24 to No. 18 Oklahoma with 18:30 to go before putting together a comeback for the ages. It was CU's largest comeback victory under Greg McDermott (see chart below), the second-largest since 2000 (see chart below), and the second-biggest in the history of CenturyLink Center Omaha (see chart, left column on page five).\n\nOn the other hand, CU is 114-6 under McDermott when putting together double-digit leads, including wins 102 of the last 104 times.\n\nDouble-Digit Comebacks Under Greg McDermott\n\nDeficit Opponent Date\n\n18 #18 Oklahoma 11/19/14\n\n17 at San Diego State 11/30/11\n\n16 at Evansville 02/16/13\n\n14 Evansville 02/21/12\n\n13 at Saint Joseph's 11/16/13\n\n13 Xavier 01/12/14\n\n12 Saint Joseph's 12/11/10\n\n11 at Wichita State 12/31/11\n\n11 Northern Iowa 01/10/12\n\n11 vs. Alabama 03/16/12\n\n10 UAB 11/14/12\n\n10 vs. Drake 03/02/12\n\n10 at Nebraska 12/07/14\n\n10 South Dakota 12/09/14\n\nWinning Formulas\n\nBelow are the records for each current BIG EAST school over the last four, 10 and 16 (since 2000-01) seasons, ranked by overall wins, through games of Dec. 28th.\n\nMost Wins Since 2000-01 (thru 12/28)\n\nTeam W L\n\nButler 369 147\n\nXavier 365 149\n\nCreighton 358 159\n\nVillanova 347 167\n\nMarquette 337 172\n\nGeorgetown 332 169\n\nProvidence 270 217\n\nSeton Hall 254 226\n\nSt. John's 241 240\n\nDePaul 199 277\n\nMost Wins - Last 10 Years (2006-07 thru 12/28)\n\nTeam W L\n\nButler 243 85\n\nXavier 228 95\n\nVillanova 225 95\n\nCreighton 219 107\n\nGeorgetown 214 97\n\nMarquette 211 110\n\nProvidence 170 136\n\nSt. John's 159 146\n\nSeton Hall 158 142\n\nDePaul 108 191\n\nMost Wins - Last 4 Years (2012-13 thru 12/28)\n\nTeam W L\n\nVillanova 92 24\n\nCreighton 78 39\n\nProvidence 76 40\n\nButler 75 38\n\nXavier 73 41\n\nGeorgetown 72 38\n\nMarquette 66 45\n\nSt. John's 65 47\n\nSeton Hall 58 52\n\nDePaul 41 68\n\nWhat A Start!\n\nGreg McDermott is 130-61 on the Creighton sideline early in his sixth year at the helm. The 130 wins are easily the most in Creighton history in the first six seasons, way more than Tom Apke's 109.\n\nMost Wins at CU, First Six Seasons\n\nCoach Years W-L After 6 Yrs\n\nGreg McDermott 2010-Pres. 130-61 so far\n\nTom Apke 1974-80 109-55\n\nTony Barone 1985-91 102-82\n\nDana Altman 1994-00 99-78\n\nRed McManus 1959-65 91-63\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is 93-1 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha. In other words, Creighton is 105-1 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza. The perfect streak of 101-0 was snapped on Dec. 2, 2015 when Arizona State scored three points in the final 15 seconds to sneak away with a 79-77 victory.\n\nHome Run\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over in 2010, Creighton is averaging 78.45 points per home game (7,531 points in 96 home games).\n\nSince a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000, Creighton is 115-0 at home (86-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more, and 97-0 at home (70-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to that same setback.\n\nLast Season Recap\n\nCreighton went 14-19 last season, finishing 4-14 to tie for ninth place in the BIG EAST Conference.\n\nThe Bluejays started the season 5-0, including a win over No. 18 Oklahoma, before losing eight remaining games in the final minute.\n\nSenior point guard Austin Chatman led Creighton in scoring (11.5 ppg.) and assists (3.7 apg.), while fellow senior Devin Brooks paced the team in rebounds (5.0 ppg.) and steals (1.0 spg.).\n\nDespite the struggles on the court, Creighton still ranked sixth nationally with 17,048 fans per home game.\n\nShuttle Service Provided Again\n\nChief Bus will provide complimentary shuttle service from the Creighton University campus to CenturyLink Center Omaha for all men's basketball home games this season. The service is available to all fans, not just Creighton students.\n\nThe shuttle will start 75 minutes before tip-off and shuttles will continue to operate the route during the game. The three designated stops for pick-up around the CU campus are: 24th & California (nearside/southbound); 20th & Cass (nearside/eastbound) and at Billy Blues Alumni Grill (outside the Mike & Josie Harper Center in the turnaround which is on the east side of the building).\n\nThe shuttle will then go eastbound on Capitol Avenue and then go north up 10th Street for drop-off at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance. The route is designed for each shuttle driver to make a roundtrip every 15 minutes.\n\nFollowing the game's conclusion, the shuttle will start at the CenturyLink Center Omaha convention center entrance on 10th Street and loop the original route with the first of three stops at 24th & California Streets.\n\nTicket Information\n\nSingle-game tickets for the 2015-16 season went on sale on October 29th.\n\nFans can purchase single-game tickets at CenturyLink Center Omaha Box Office, Ryan Athletic Center, all Ticketmaster locations (Baker's, Younkers), Ticketmaster online at http://www.ticketmaster.com or by calling Ticketmaster and charging by phone at (800) 745-3000.
