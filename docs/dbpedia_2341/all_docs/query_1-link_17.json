        "text": "Pink means it’s a Fox Day. Blue means a Pac-12 Day.\n\nIf Steve Lavin has invested in anything during the months spent toggling between his last college coaching gig and his next TV job, it’s a stockpile of highlighter pens.\n\nThe former UCLA and St. John’s head basketball coach triple-checks the large desk calendars spread out on the kitchen table of the Venice loft that he and his wife, Mary, are currently leasing, just to remind him what squares have been strategically coded.\n\nSaturday was alive in streaks of pink ‑ he spent the day at the Fox Sports’ Pico studios, engaged in Big East-related college basketball viewing that started with a 6:30 a.m. production meeting, then on the air for Fox Sports 1 at 8 a.m.\n\nToday turns to code blue ‑ not just to coordinate with the fact he’ll be back courtside at Pauley Pavilion to call UCLA’s game against Long Beach State at 6 p.m., but that the Pac-12 Network has him locked and loaded for this one.\n\nBy the time March Madness arrives, Lavin will have logged about 30 games and 80 studio appearances between the two cable channels.\n\nBut this TV workout is hardly anything new or surprising for someone who majored in broadcast journalism at San Francisco State and then made communications his emphasis when he transferred to Chapman College in the mid ‘80s.\n\nAt this point in his career, the 51-year-old might be thought of as either a lifer college basketball coach who seems to always find a safety net in TV work when it’s time to move on, or he’s an accomplished broadcaster able to pick and choose what kind of hoop dreams program he’d consider heading if opportunities arise.\n\nThe seven seasons he fruitfully spent doing high-profile games for ESPN with Brent Musburger and Dave O’Brien was no accidental career diversion. Lavin was always a media-friendly personality during a 12-year run coaching at UCLA – the last seven of them as the head coach on teams that had five Sweet 16 appearances.\n\nFive more years of reviving an otherwise dormant program at St. John’s with three campaigns of 20 or more wins and two NCAA Tournament appearances – this during a time when doctors advised him to step away from the sidelines to recover for prostate cancer surgery, has added up to 28 straight years working in and around the game.\n\nOne way or another, whatever the color scheme, Lavin remains a vibrantly colorful example of someone who continues to take positives out of challenging circumstances, something that often translates to his TV work.\n\nWhatever the job, he is in constant communication mode. He’s texting or Tweeting one moment, the next inquiring about the best cat food at the neighborhood pet store or exchanging ideas with the guys at the art and frame shop repairing some of his valued pieces that got dinged a bit from his recent move back to L.A.\n\n“To manage a winning basketball program, you have to be fully consumed with the job at hand,” said Lavin, between bites of a turkey sandwich and salad on Friday afternoon, about how TV work can be something of a coaching sabbatical for him on many levels.\n\n“Broadcasting affords me the rare opportunity to widen the lens, sitting courtside when you observe coaches at work in practice and games. The prep work for broadcasting is also a helpful form of study – it naturally increases your acumen and knowledge base. The more deliberate pace and autonomy lends itself to learning.”\n\nAt this stage, he enjoys the West Coast time, and the Pac-12 Network and Fox Sports opportunities play much more into that lifestyle choice than if he circled back to ESPN.\n\nHis 83-year-old mother and siblings live the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Pac-12 offices and studios are located. His father, former University of San Francisco basketball player and long-time English teacher Cap Lavin, passed away in early 2013, and Steve Lavin is the youngest of their six children.\n\nHere, the Fox Studios are just a few miles East of Lavin’s current home base. Factor in as well that the nighttime work ends far earlier than the 2:30 a.m. food runs he was accustomed to in Bristol, Conn., which is far more conducive to his health needs.\n\n“Life is so much about timing,” Lavin said. “In my career, the opportunities have revealed themselves in wonderfully unexpected ways but they’ve always seemed a natural fit for that particular stage in my life.”\n\nAt St. John’s, Lavin came to know the people running the upstart Fox Sports 1 through the network’s Big East Conference TV contract. FS1 main college basketball analyst Bill Raftery was already one of Lavin’s broadcasting and life mentors, someone along the lines of coach-turned-broadcasters like Al McGuire and the Jim Valvano that Lavin has wanted to pattern himself after.\n\nWithin hours after he was let go at St. John’s – mostly because the new president was bent on having former alum Chris Mullin take over the program – Lavin was in contact with his TV friends, or they were tracking him down to see if he might be swayed to join them if he wasn’t checking out another coaching vacancies.\n\nFox and the Pac-12 Network didn’t announce his dual hiring until September after working out the logistics, but also knowing Lavin still has the coaching bug. He spent the summer in Kuwait coaching a military team.\n\n“Steve has been a tremendous addition to our college basketball coverage,” said Fox Sports president of production John Entz. “He obviously had previous experience doing television and it’s shown from day one, but his unique insight is truly valuable. He’s also improved our local knowledge of the food and wine scene ‑ an area we were clearly lacking.”\n\nOne of the first assignments Fox gave him about two weeks ago was a studio analyst role on a Big East trip that included a stop at St. John’s Carnesecca Arena on the Jamaica, N.Y. campus. Lavin called the visit “surreal” but nothing he was uncomfortable doing, seated up higher above the sideline, but in amongst the fans who showed him love.\n\nSt. John’s registered a two-point win over Rutgers after being down by 16 at one point. It ended with a controversial non-tripping call that involved a Rutgers player, one Lavin wasn’t afraid to say benefitted St. John’s.\n\n“My experience in coaching and broadcasting has sharpened my ability in how to present information in a fair, informative and entertaining manner,” he explained about how he feels he’s able to be objective in any broadcasting situation that involves a former employer.\n\n“I’ve learned there’s a way to be instructive and point out a lack of execution or flawed elements in the team’s performance without being mean spirited or overly derogatory.”\n\nLavin, with a 226-132 lifetime head coaching mark, eventually learned how to insulate himself from any strange energy after UCLA let him go following a 10-19 season in 2003. In his first year at ESPN, the network had him do a UCLA game at Arizona. The second season, he was back at Pauley Pavilion doing a contest.\n\nHe has probably called more than a half-dozen UCLA games as a broadcaster already, and returning to Westwood for the first time since 2010 today doesn’t create any awkwardness for him. A recent visit to watch a UCLA practice resulted in coach Steve Alford having Lavin address the team.\n\nIn fact, Lavin’s name came up in several media stories about UCLA’s takedown of No. 1 Kentucky on Thursday – his 2003 Bruins squad was the last one in the program to knock off a top-ranked school.\n\nTurns out that overtime win over Arizona in the Pac-10 Tournament semifinals was the last victory on Lavin’s UCLA resume that included three other instances of his teams knocking off a No. 1.\n\nLavin embraces the fact both the Pac-12 Network and FS1 are in their early business stages. If another coaching job never pulls him back, he’d be very content on being a presence that facilitates each of their growing trajectories.\n\nOn a scale of 1-to-10, he says his health is about at an 8, which “is normal for someone my age” even after the cancer treatment. Medical follow-ups are part of the process. Neither the grind of coaching or TV work put him at any risk, he says, as long as he maintains moderation. Lavin also stays involve in ESPN’s V Foundation for Cancer Research and continues to raise money for the Coaches Vs. Cancer fund.\n\n“Having run marathons and coaching at UCLA, I clearly have a good pain threshold,” he said with a laugh, reflecting not just on his early cancer prognosis, but how he moved on from that.\n\n“Television is very attractive as a possible final chapter – if this were how I finish my professional career, it would be very fulfilling. The people at Fox and the Pac 12 have been fantastic to me.\n\n“I’d be open for a return to coaching if it was a natural fit, but my focus is on delivering to our college basketball coverage as an analyst. Life experiences have taught me to be thankful for the present, to recognize the gifts and blessings.\n\n“Throughout my career, I’ve tried to add value at each stop, but also transition with grace. There’s no value in being bitter.\n\n“Cancer, losing my dad, having now been fired twice – it’s all enhanced my perspective and sensibilities. Challenging times clearly make us appreciate more fully the gifts and blessings.”\n\nMore media notes at www.insidesocal.com/tomhoffarth\n\nMONITORING MEDIA MOMENTUM\n\nWHAT SMOKES\n\n== Considering that Kobe Bryant reportedly made a “significant investment” financially last October in ThePlayersTribune.com, along with retaining his “Editorial Director” pseudo title, there’s little surprise the Lakers star used that particular platform instead of going to any other media outlet last Sunday to announce this would be his last NBA season.\n\nHe controlled the message. The media was left to distribute it — more than 1,000 sites eventually linked to it — then react to it, then beg for interviews to elaborate on it. So many more mainstream media outlets as well as ESPN’s “Outside The Lines” decided it was ripe to follow up on the site because, maybe, they weren’t before in tune with the power of the platform, which we examined on the site’s one-year anniversary.\n\nWHAT CHOKES\n\n== At one point in the third quarter of CBS’ coverage of the Alabama-Florida SEC title game Saturday, play was halted following a kickoff by the Crimson Tide that went out of bounds. Officials ruled the ball hit a TV cable wire strung over the field at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, part of the equipment used to get those video-game type overhead shots. Alabama had to kick off again. This one was clean, caught in the end zone and not returned. “There’s three minutes of my life I won’t get back,” CBS analyst Gary Danielson lamented after several network replays failed to show the ball hitting anything or changing its trajectory. Just because CBS’ other cameras couldn’t find evidence shouldn’t be taken so lightly. CBS might be more thankful it didn’t have to grovel for an explanation if Florida returned that second kickoff back for a touchdown, potentially tying the game and changing the momentum. Networks have for years been rigging up stadiums to become de facto TV studios but still haven’t figured out yet, especially in a dome facility, how to raise the wires high enough during kicks to avoid these kind of scenarios?"
