The evening begins at 6 PM with cocktails followed by dinner at 7 PM.\n\nBesides the honorees, guests are scheduled to include Helen and Robert Appel, Renee and Robert Belfer, Norman Benzaquen and Judy Zankel, Judy and Howard Berkowitz, Debbie and Leon Black, Ken Buckfire, Nancy and Colin Campbell, Louise Hirschfeld Cullman and Lewis B. Cullman, Diana and Joe DiMenna, Sandy Jacobs, Wynton Marsalis, Louise Mirrer, Charlie Rose, Pam Schafler, Laurie Tisch, Barbara Walters and Claude Wasserstein.\n\nFounded in 1804, the New-York Historical Society has a mission \"to explore the richly layered history of New York City, state, and the country, as well as to serve as a national forum for the discussion of issues surrounding the making and meaning of history.\""
