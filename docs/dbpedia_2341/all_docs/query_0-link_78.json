        "text": "Chris Mullin is expected to step down as the men's basketball head coach at St. John's, sources confirmed to ESPN.\n\nRed Storm athletic director Mike Cragg issued a statement of support on Saturday, saying, \"Chris Mullin is our head coach and we are not looking for another head coach.\" The statement came after a week of rumblings about contentious meetings between Mullin and Cragg.\n\nThe news that Mullin will step down was first reported by CBS Sports.\n\nMullin, the greatest player in St. John's basketball history, took over as head coach in 2015, replacing Steve Lavin. Mullin struggled in his first three years at the helm, going a combined 38-60 and failing to finish above .500 in any of his first three seasons.\n\nThis season, St. John's had one of the most talented rosters in the Big East and made the NCAA tournament, but it stumbled down the stretch, losing five of its final six games. The Red Storm lost to Arizona State in the First Four, finishing their season 21-13.\n\nMullin, a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, had no coaching experience before he took the job. He worked in the Golden State Warriors' front office for five years as the executive vice president of basketball operations. He also spent time working as an adviser in the Sacramento Kings organization."
