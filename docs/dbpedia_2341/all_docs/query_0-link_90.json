        "text": "Republished: This fanpost originally appeared in March 2014. It has been updated for the 2015 NCAA tournament. - BN eds.\n\nHere's a quick look back at UCLA Sweet Sixteen success stories since the 1995 National Championship team..\n\n1997 - (2) UCLA vs. (6) Iowa State\n\nIn Lavin's first season coaching Jim Harrick's team, the Bruins faced a tough Iowa State team coached by this guy:\n\nUCLA had a long, athletic, experienced team that featured 4 future NBA players: Charles O'Bannon, Toby Bailey, J.R. Henderson, and Jelani McCoy. The only thing missing was... a coach. The Bruins were outplayed by Iowa State in the first half, and trailed by double digits for much of the game. Here are a few of the highlights.\n\nCharles O'Bannon trims the early Iowa State lead with a three.\n\nA fabulous pass by Toby Bailey sets up Jelani McCoy for the dunk to cut the Iowa State lead to 13.\n\nThe Bruins catch Iowa State late in the second half and the game heads to overtime tied at 64. With less than 2 minutes left in overtiime, the Bruins go up by 4 on a J.R. Henderson dunk.\n\nIn spite of Steve Lavin's arm waving and jumping up and down on the sidelines, Lavin's Bruins find a way to fall behind with under 10 seconds left in overtime. Cue Cameron Dollar...\n\nThis is the only Sweet Sixteen victory of Steve Lavin's coaching career.\n\nFinal Score: UCLA 74, Iowa State 73 (OT)\n\nLeading Scorers: Cameron Dollar 20, Charles O'Bannon 16\n\n2006 - (2) UCLA vs. (3) Gonzaga\n\nThis was Howland's first UCLA team to make the tournament. The team was young but talented and disciplined. The team included future NBA players Jordan Farmar, Arron Afflalo, Darren Collison, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute , Ryan Hollins and Cedric Bozeman. (Bozeman was not drafted by the NBA but briefly played for the Atlanta Hawks.)\n\nThe Bruins trailed by double digits for most of the game, and were down by 8 with about 3 minutes left in the game. Then this happened...\n\nBen ball warriors were physically and mentally tough. In the closing minutes of the game, Arron Afflalo drives, fights for the rebound off his miss, and scores the basket while getting mugged. And look who ends up on the floor.\n\nDown by 5 with under a minute left, Jordan Farmar scores a clutch basket.\n\nAnd then the sequences that had UCLA fans celebrating and Gonzaga fans (and Adam Morrison) in tears...\n\nFinal Score: UCLA 73, Gonzaga 71\n\nLeading Scorers: Jordan Farmar 15, Arron Afflalo 15\n\n2007 - (2) UCLA vs, (3) Pittsburgh\n\nUCLA's second trip to the Sweet Sixteen with Coach Howland featured a matchup between two defensive teams that were built to grind out victories. The Bruins never trailed in a game that had few highlights. This UCLA team included future NBA players Darren Collison, Arron Afflalo, Russell Westbrook, and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, Here are a couple of highlights...\n\nRussell Westbrook tracks back to shut down a potential Pittsburgh break and then finishes at the rim.\n\nCollison splits two defenders and finds Keefe in the paint for the dunk.\n\nFinal Score: UCLA 64, Pittsburgh 55\n\nLeading Scorers: Arron Afflalo 17, Josh Shipp 16\n\n2008 - (1) UCLA vs.(12) Western Kentucky\n\nThis was Coach Howland's third consecutive Sweet Sixteen team. It featured future NBA stars Kevin Love and Russell Westbrook as well as NBA players Darren Collison and Luc Richard Mbah a Moute. UCLA jumped out to an early lead built on suffocating defense and efficient offense. This team was a joy to watch.\n\nEarly in the first half, great ball movement results in a Westbrook dunk.\n\nTenacious man-to-man defense by Westbrook with an aggressive high hedge by Aboya. PAA with the finish!\n\nJames Keefe has his best game as a Bruin. This is one of his 4 blocks.\n\nKevin Love gets great position for 2 of his 29 points.\n\nThe Bruins break the WKU full court press.\n\nRussell Westbrook with the no-look pass to James Keefe for the dunk.\n\nFinal Score: UCLA 88, Western Kentucky 78\n\nLeading Scorers: Kevin Love 29, James Keefe 18\n\nLet's hope that the 2015 Bruins match the Sweet Sixteen success of these four UCLA teams.\n\nGo BRUINS!"
