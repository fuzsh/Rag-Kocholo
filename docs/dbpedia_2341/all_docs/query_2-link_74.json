        "text": "Steve Lavin's tenure at St, John's could end before his contract does next year.\n\nAccording to SNY.tv, a “little bit of a power struggle” exists between Lavin, at least one of the program’s financial backers and some members of the administration about the direction of the program. The report cited unnamed sources.\n\nMORE: Top 25 highest-paid coaches | Lavin says he's a bad tourney coach | All of college basketball's hirings and firings\n\n“They’re meeting either this weekend or Monday to discuss the fate of Lavin,” one source told SNY.tv.\n\nAnother source said that several administrators have already adjourned one meeting about Lavin's fate over the weekend and were taking steps to secure a second meeting.\n\n“I’d be shocked if he ever survived this,” the second source said.\n\nSt. John's lost to San Diego State in the Round of 64 last week at the NCAA Tournament. After the loss, Lavin expressed his expectation for a contract extension. He will be entering the final year of his deal next season.\n\nLavin's buyout is worth $2 million. He has an 81-55 record with St. John's and has led them to two NCAA Tournament appearances and two NIT Tournament appearances."
