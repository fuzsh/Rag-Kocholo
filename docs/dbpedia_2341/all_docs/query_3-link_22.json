        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — D’Angelo Harrison made history on Tuesday night in one of college basketball’s most celebrated settings — historic Hinkle Fieldhouse — becoming only the third St. John’s player to score 2,000 career points.\n\nEverything else in the Red Storm’s 85-62 loss to 22nd-ranked Butler was an embarrassment to St. John’s storied past.\n\nPutrid play was only part of St. John’s worst performance of the season — the team’s largest margin of defeat since a 26-point loss to Notre Dame on March 5, 2013 — as the Red Storm unraveled in an undisciplined and undignified effort, with Chris Obekpa earning an ejection for a violent elbow and Sir’Dominic Pointer picking up a technical foul.\n\nLosing to Butler (17-6, 7-3) for the second time this season, St. John’s (14-8, 3-6) suffered its seventh loss in the past 10 games, remaining winless against ranked teams, in eighth-place in the Big East and without consecutive wins since December.\n\n“It’s a bigger concern as we get deeper in the season, you have to be able to maintain your poise and composure and ultimately that comes on my shoulders,” coach Steve Lavin said. “That’s my responsibility.\n\n“We did not answer the bell.”\n\nArriving in Indianapolis just before 5 a.m. because of a snowstorm, St. John’s repeatedly hit the snooze button, sleepwalking through a scoreless first five minutes and hitting only four of its first 20 shots.\n\nA bubble team in need of a marquee win, the Red Storm demonstrated irrational frustration instead of passionate desperation, as Obekpa was ejected with 8:26 left in the first half after throwing an elbow to the back of Tyler Wideman’s head, while running down the floor.\n\nIt was Obekpa’s second ejection of the season, one which could lead to further discipline, though he claimed the blow was in self-defense.\n\n“I’ll take the bullet,” Obekpa told The Post after the game. “He hit me three times and I told the ref and nothing happened. How many times can I let him hit me?”\n\nAlready with a short rotation and weak on the glass, St. John’s lost its top rebounder and the nation’s third-leading shot blocker, and Butler quickly altered its plans.\n\nNo longer fearful of the consequences of attacking the rim, the Bulldogs began a nonstop layup line, resulting in 46 points in the paint, a plus-12 rebounding margin and better than 56 percent shooting from the field.\n\n“Obekpa’s one of the best rim protectors in the country, so that certainly gave us the opportunity to attack inside,” Butler coach Chris Holtmann said. “We wanted to drive it, post it, get as many paint touches as we could. We felt we could hurt them in there with him out.”\n\nTrailing 36-28 at halftime, Lavin sent out a small lineup featuring the 6-foot-6 Pointer (19 points) at center, resulting in a 14-2 Butler run to start the second half, led by Kellen Dunham (21 points).\n\nDown by 20, St. John’s battled back with its transition offense and little-used Felix Balamou (six points) to cut the deficit to eight with less than eight minutes remaining, but with leading-scorer Harrison (10 points) having fouled out, the Red Storm’s half-court offense flatlined, failing to produce a point in the final 5:27.\n\nSt. John’s, which hit 3-of-18 3-pointers, finished with 13 turnovers and five assists.\n\n“There’s no excuses,” Harrison said. “We know that.”\n\nThere are no excuses, but are there answers?"
