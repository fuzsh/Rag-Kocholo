He replaces Steve Lavin who agreed to leave last week, after five seasons during which the Red Storm reached the NCAA Tournament twice.\n\nMullin, a New York native, was a five-time All-Star with Golden State, a member of the USA's gold-medal winning \"Dream Team\" in 1992 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. He was presented for induction by his coach at St. John's, Hall of Famer Lou Carnesecca.\n\n____________\n\nJOHNSON CITY, Tenn. -- East Tennessee State has hired Wichita State assistant Steve Forbes as its next basketball coach.\n\nForbes replaces Murry Bartow, who was fired March 13 after going 224-165 with three NCAA Tournament appearances in 12 seasons. ETSU earned the most recent of those NCAA invitations in 2010.\n\nThe 50-year-old Forbes spent the past two seasons at Wichita State after going 62-6 in two seasons as the head coach at Northwest Florida State, a junior college in Niceville, Florida.\n\nForbes has connections within the Volunteer State from his five years working as an assistant on Bruce Pearl's Tennessee staff."
