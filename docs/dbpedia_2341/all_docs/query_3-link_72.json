        "text": "USD plays at home Tuesday, on the road Thursday and Saturday\n\nSan Diego Toreros (0-2) • Fresno State (1-1)\n\nTuesday, November 12 • 7 p.m.\n\nJenny Craig Pavilion (5,100) • San Diego, Calif.\n\nLive Stream • WCC Network | Live Statistics\n\nTwitter: @USDMBB • Instagram: @USDMBB\n\nSAN DIEGO – San Diego enters a week of three games in five days, including a home matchup against Fresno State on Tuesday followed by a two-game road swing through the Mountain Time Zone on Thursday (Weber State) and Saturday (Colorado).\n\nThe Toreros are 0-2 to start the season following this past Saturday's loss on the road at Long Beach State. USD has posted strong first halves in each of its two games, but opponents have pulled away in the final minutes to deal the Toreros their first 0-2 start in three years.\n\nFresno State has split its first two games, with the win coming on a buzzer beater against Winthrop on Sunday (77-74) preceding a loss to No. 15/14 Oregon in the opener (57-71).\n\nWeber State lost its season opener to Utah State on November 8 and will not play before hosting San Diego on Thursday (6 p.m. PT). Colorado, meanwhile, captured its season opener over Arizona State in a game played in China on November 8.\n\nTuesday's game can be seen on the WCC Network and Stadium, with the Voice of the Toreros Jack Cronin on the call. Live stats are also available. Both road games will feature live audio streaming on the Toreros' website.\n\nLAST TIME OUT: TURNOVERS HURT TOREROS IN 74-62 LOSS AT LONG BEACH STATE\n\n- San Diego turned the ball over 29 times on Saturday at Long Beach State and lost its road opener, 74-62, at the Walter Pyramid. The Beach scored 30 of their 74 points off the USD turnovers, which fell one shy of the school record. Despite the mistakes, the Toreros trailed by three at halftime, 37-34, as they had seven of the eight players distribute the points. They even trailed by as little as one with 15:50 remaining when Jared Rodriguez scored two of his 11 points, but Long Beach State went on an 11-0 run to extend the lead into double digits. A dunk by James Jean-Marie with five minutes remaining made the deficit single digits again and the Beach did not make a field goal over the final four minutes, but the Toreros could not climb any closer than 10 to finish out the game. USD out-rebounded LBSU, 38-35, but the Beach outscored the Toreros in the paint, 32-24. Joey Calcaterra led USD with 20 points.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST FRESNO STATE\n\n- Tuesday will be the 11th all-time meeting between USD and Fresno State as the Toreros trail in the series, 2-8.\n\n- In the last meeting, the Toreros battled back from a 12-point deficit at halftime but lost 74-70 at home against the Bulldogs on December 7, 2010.\n\n- USD has lost three straight to Fresno State.\n\n- The Toreros' last win against the Bulldogs occurred on December 10, 2005, a 72-61 win in the San Diego Slam tournament at Cox Arena (now known as Viejas Arena on SDSU's campus).\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST WEBER STATE\n\n- Thursday's matchup will be the sixth all-time matchup between USD and Weber State. The Toreros won the last meeting, a 83-66 win in November 2018 but trail in the series, 2-3.\n\nALL-TIME SERIES AGAINST COLORADO\n\n- Saturday will be the seventh all-time matchup between San Diego and Colorado as the series stands at 3-3.\n\n- Last season, USD took down Colorado at home, 70-64. It was its second straight win over the Buffaloes in as many seasons. The Toreros won in Boulder, 69-59, in 2017-18.\n\nLOOKING AHEAD\n\n- Following their three-game swing this week, the Toreros return home on Wednesday, November 20 for a cross-town rivalry matchup against SDSU inside the Jenny Craig Pavilion (8 p.m.).\n\nJOEY STEPPING UP\n\n- Redshirt sophomore Joey Calcaterra has scored in double digits in back-to-back games to start the season. It is the first time in his career he has put up double-digit points in consecutive games.\n\n- Prior to this season, Calcaterra had 10+ points only twice in his career.\n\n- At Long Beach State on Saturday, Calcaterra dropped in 20 points, a career-high. It was the first 20-point effort by a Torero since March 11, 2019 when Isaiah Wright scored 22 in a 69-62 loss against Saint Mary's in the WCC Tournament.\n\n- Calcaterra is averaging 16.0 points per game this season in 33.5 minutes. Last year, he averaged 2.8 points in 12.4 minutes.\n\nJARED'S ARRIVAL\n\n- Redshirt sophomore Jared Rodriguez made his Torero debut last Saturday at Long Beach State, scoring 11 points and grabbing five rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench.\n\n- Rodriguez missed the season opener against UC Irvine as he was awaiting word from the NCAA on his transfer waiver. He and the team learned his waiver was approved after practice on Friday morning, prior to the team making the bus trip to Long Beach State.\n\n- As a redshirt freshman at Idaho, Rodriguez appeared in all 32 games (31 starts) and averaged 11.2 points and 6.5 rebounds. He was a 47.1% shooter with the Vandals.\n\n- In the game against LBSU, Rodriguez was 5-of-11 from the field (45%).\n\nA TALE OF TWO HALVES\n\n- USD has jumped out to strong starts in the first half of its games. It scored 48 points on 51.5% shooting in the season opener against UC Irvine and 34 on 48% at Long Beach State in game two.\n\n- In the first half for this season, the Toreros are 29-of-58 (50%) from the field and 9-of-20 (45%) from three-point range.\n\n- In the second half, USD is 15-of-55 (27%) from the field and 5-of-24 (21%) from three.\n\nNEWCOMER PRODUCTION\n\n- As to be anticipated with a roster of 10 newcomers, first-year players in a USD uniform have provided most the points. Of the 135 points, 80 were scored by newcomers (59%).\n\n- A newcomer has reached double-digits in points in each of the first two games.\n\nAT THE POINT\n\n- Redshirt freshman Marion Humphrey has assumed the starting point guard role for the Toreros in only his second semester on campus.\n\n- A native of Hoover, Ala., Humphrey is averaging 8.0 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.5 assists. He has a 0.75 assist-to-turnover ratio in the first two games of his collegiate career.\n\n- Humphrey also has two steals and a block as he has filled up the stat sheet in both games.\n\nSTART TO A SEASON\n\n- The Toreros are 0-2 to start a season for the first time since 2016-17. That year it started 0-3.\n\nINTERNATIONAL FLAVOR\n\n- The USD roster features 7 international players, which are tied for the second-most on a Division I team this season.\n\n- Six different countries are represented among the 7 international players, including Belarus (Yauhen Massalski), Belgium (Noel Coleman), Brazil (Felipe Doria), Canada (James Jean-Marie, Sabry Philip), Germany (Vladimir Pinchuk), and Norway (Mikal Gjerde).\n\n- The 3 teams with the most international players all play in the West Coast Conference.\n\nMost International Players\n\nDivision I Men's Basketball Rosters\n\n10 - Saint Mary's\n\n7 - San Diego & LMU\n\n6 - Davidson, Montana State, Utah State, Cal Baptist\n\n5 - 13 schools\n\nSCHOLL IN HIS SECOND FULL SEASON\n\n- Entering his second full season as the head coach, Sam Scholl will look to build upon a 21-win coaching debut in 2018-19.\n\n- Scholl led the Toreros to 21 wins and the program's first NIT appearance in his first full season, making him only the second coach in program history to lead the Toreros to 20+ wins and a postseason trip in the inaugural year at the helm.\n\n- A former guard for USD, Scholl is 23-19 in his head coaching career after guiding the team to a 2-2 record to end the 2017-18 season as the interim head coach.\n\n- Scholl has been on a USD coaching staff for 11 of his 19 years in coaching. He was a graduate assistant and assistant coach from 2001 to 2007 and then rejoined the school in 2015. He has 21 years of experience playing or coaching in the West Coast Conference.\n\nA LOOK AT THE SCHEDULE\n\n- The Toreros loaded up their nonconference schedule once again this season as it features three 20-win teams from last season (UC Irvine, Fresno State, San Diego State) and five teams who finished in the top-100 of the NET rankings.\n\n- Those top-100 NET ranking teams include Washington (44), Colorado (65), UC Irvine (71), Hofstra (76), and Fresno State (82). Another opponent, Stanford, finished just outside the top-100 at 103. The Toreros, meanwhile, placed No. 98.\n\nCOACHING STAFF CHANGES\n\n- Coach Scholl welcomed Jerry Brown as a new addition to the USD coaching staff, replacing Chris Gerlufsen who left for an assistant coach position with Hawaii in September.\n\n- Brown joins assistants Terrence Rencher and David Carter on USD's staff. He previously worked at Stanford as the Director of Player Development.\n\n- Prior to Stanford, Brown coached at UTEP in 2018-19 and spent 2017-18 with the Detroit Pistons. The former Fresno State captain played for Coach Scholl at Santa Clara as a grad transfer in 2013-14.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#22 Isaiah Wright\n\nG\n\n6' 2\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\n1V\n\n#2 Joey Calcaterra\n\nG\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\n1V\n\n#0 Marion Humphrey\n\nG\n\n6' 2\"\n\nRedshirt Freshman\n\nRS\n\n#25 Yauhen Massalski\n\nF\n\n6' 10\"\n\nJunior\n\n2V\n\n#3 Noel Coleman\n\nG\n\n6' 1\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#10 Mikal Gjerde\n\nF\n\n6' 7\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#23 James Jean-Marie\n\nF\n\n6' 7\"\n\nJunior\n\n#4 Sabry Philip\n\nG\n\n6' 4\"\n\nFreshman\n\n#40 Vladimir Pinchuk\n\nC\n\n6' 11\"\n\nJunior\n\nTR\n\n#20 Jared Rodriguez\n\nF\n\n6' 7\"\n\nRedshirt Sophomore\n\nTR\n\n#14 Felipe Doria\n\nG\n\n6' 5\"\n\nFreshman"
