        "text": "A week after leading St. John’s back to the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament for the first time in four years, Coach Steve Lavin has agreed to part ways with the Red Storm, the university announced Friday.\n\n“Coach Lavin returned high expectations to our men’s basketball program and represented St. John’s in a positive way,” Chris Monasch, the university’s athletic director, said in a statement. “We appreciate his commitment to the program and to our student-athletes over the past five years.”\n\nThe two sides had been discussing an extension of Lavin’s contract, which had one year remaining, according to a person with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nAnother person who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the discussions said that Conrado M. Gempesaw, the new president of St. John’s, seeking to make a splash, might already have had his sights set on a replacement: the former St. John’s star Chris Mullin, who is an adviser for the Sacramento Kings but has never coached.\n\n“I enjoyed celebrating our student-athletes’ accomplishments in my first year at St. John’s,” Gempesaw said in a statement. “We look forward to building on this foundation as we strive to continue the tradition of success that the St. John’s basketball program has achieved for more than 100 years.”\n\nAfter coaching U.C.L.A. from 1996 to 2003 and then becoming a broadcaster at ESPN, Lavin, 50, arrived in Queens for the 2010-11 season with high expectations, leading the Red Storm to the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time since 2002 — albeit with many players recruited by the former coach, Norm Roberts. Lavin followed with what was called the No. 3 recruiting class in the nation for 2011-12, which energized the fan base.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
