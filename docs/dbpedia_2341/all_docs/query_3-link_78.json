        "text": "BY MICHELLE LOVATO\n\nLake County Leader\n\nPolson High School student Shayne Pierre was the youngest person to receive the Montana Highway Patrol Meritorious Service Award.\n\nPierre was given the award Monday when Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Terry Rosenbaum and Montana Highway Patrol Maj. Steve Lavin recognized him for his efforts after a drunk driver drive into the back of the school bus Pierre and several other children were riding on May 11 near Polson.\n\nPierre was sitting at the back of the bus when the accident occurred along Highway 35 near Fulkerson Corner.\n\nThe truck, driven by Daniel Fellows, 19, hit the stopped bus and was traveling at 78 miles per hour at the time of its impact, and a student was in the process of exiting the bus.\n\n“When the crash occurred, everyone on the bus was in shock,” Rosenbaum said at the ceremony. “A few moments later Shayne, who was seated in the rear of the bus, looked out the rear window and saw the driver of the vehicle that hit the bus was hurt. Shayne without hesitation knew he had to do something. As Shayne exited the bus, he told the bus driver to call 911. Shayne went to check on the driver that hit the bus. A few seconds later Shayne came back to the school bus and told the school bus driver that everyone on the bus needed to get off due to gas leaking all over the roadway. All the students exited the bus and went to a safe location. Shayne then went back to the driver that was hurt to render aid.”\n\nPierre and three other students were transported to a hospital after the crash. That is where Rosenbaum went to visit the young man.\n\n“I told Shayne I was amazed to hear that a 15 year old did all these extraordinary things in the middle of a major crash scene,” Rosenbaum said. “Shayne was very humble and just smiled. A day later I saw the video footage from the bus and I was blown away when I saw what Shayne did. Shayne went above and beyond what he needed to do. He took it upon himself to help those in need and displayed maturity and calmness in assessing the situation to get every student off the bus and to render aid to an injured driver. Shayne is a remarkable young man who placed others’ welfare before his own and to help those who couldn’t help themselves. I believe Shayne saved several lives due to his quick and selfless actions in the middle of a potential deadly crash scene. I am very proud of Shayne, not only for what he did but for the person he is and who he will become in the future.”\n\nLavin made the official presentation. “This is the kind of guy that I would like to see apply for the highway patrol in the future,” Lavin said.\n\nLake County Sheriff Don Bell gave Pierre a Lake County Certificate of Commendation. Fellows and the four students were transported to area hospitals. Fellows pleaded guilty to drunk driving and is to be sentenced July 22."
