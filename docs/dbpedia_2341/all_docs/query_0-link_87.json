        "text": "SAN JOSE – Received a 15-minute window to speak with former UCLA and St. John’s coach Steve Lavin about the UA-Xavier matchup this morning, and I knew that would be a challenge.\n\nNot only does Lavin know the Pac-12 and Big East probably as well as anybody, having coached in both leagues, but the Turner Sports analyst always has plenty of descriptive things to say.\n\nHe stumbled for words only once when he likened Xavier to the posse chasing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, where Paul Newman says “Who are those guys?”\n\n“You know, they’re trying to lose them and they think they’re gone and all of a sudden they hear the hoofsteps,” Lavin said. “You might need to look it up.”\n\n(A video clip of that line is attached).\n\nThe point being that Xavier won’t go away. The point also being that Xavier today, maybe even more so than Arizona, is not the same team it was a month or two ago. Among other issues, the Musketeers lost point guard Myles Davis to a suspension for half the season and then, after just three games, his decision to quit in January, while standout guard Edmund Sumner blew out his knee later that month.\n\n“People are evaluating Xavier based on their freefall when they lost seven of 10 games (including six in a row),” Lavin said. “But they reinvented themselves and this current group is playing at a very high level in terms of confidence. You look at them and it’s `Who are those guys having career nights?' ”\n\nLavin said he’s been particularly impressed with guards Trevon Bluiett and J.P. Macura, while noting that the Musketeers’ switching defense can be problematic – especially when they go to a 1-3-1 zone.\n\n“They’re mixing defenses which they’ve done in the past but this group has been paying better defense than they have all season,” Lavin said. “They have a fulltime 1-3-1 with Macura and then they have a 1-3-1 that drops into a 2-3 zone. They sometimes trap and they also have a man-to-man. They’ve been very effective at keeping opponents off balance. I would imagine Arizona would see a lot of zone.”\n\nLavin said Arizona can beat the Musketeers’ defense by getting out in transition before that defense sets up and, in the 1-3-1, by trying to attack the baseline or get good shooting in the corner.\n\nSean Miller and Lauri Markkanen were given NABC all-district honors.\n\nThe Seattle Times' Larry Stone looks at whether Mike Hopkins' passion will translate into success at Washington.\n\nUtah's Kyle Kuzma will test the NBA Draft waters.\n\nIf you're headed to San Jose and still without tickets, some more will be released for sale at noon PT.\n\nArizona will hold its mandatory 50-minute on-court appearance at 3 p.m. today in the SAP Center. It is open to the public though the Wildcats' offsite practice earlier in the day is closed.\n\nThe Wildcats are also scheduled for interviews between 2:30-3 p.m. We'll be posting stories online afterward into the evening, while transcripts of podium interviews will be available at asapsports.com.\n\nRespond: Write a letter to the editor | Write a guest opinion\n\nSubscribe to stay connected to Tucson.
