        "text": "Chris Mullin, Lou Carnesecca\n\nChris Mullin and former St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca hold Mullin's retired jersey during a news conference to announce his hiring as St. John's men's basketball coach last April.\n\n(AP Photo | John Minchillo)\n\nSyracuse, N.Y. â€” At first glance, there is nothing wrong with the St. John's University basketball program.\n\nThe Red Storm has won at least 20 games in three of the last five seasons, including the 2014-15 campaign. St. John's received an invitation to the 2015 NCAA Tournament where it lost in the round of 64 to San Diego State.\n\nAnd there is a significant amount of buzz surrounding the Red Storm with the return of St. John's legend Chris Mullin, who led the school to the 1985 Final Four, as the new head coach.\n\nHowever, these are turbulent times for the once-proud St. John's program.\n\nThe school parted ways with former coach Steve Lavin after last season, which despite the 20 wins and the NCAA Tournament appearance, was a major disappointment. St. John's finished fifth in the Big East Conference despite a team that included seniors D'Angelo Harrison, Phil Greene, Sir'Dominic Pointer and Jamal Branch in addition to junior center Chris Obekpa and sophomore standout Rysheed Jordan.\n\nThe end of the season saw Carnesecca Arena empty out almost completely. The four seniors left, as did Obekpa, who transferred to UNLV, and Jordan, who inexplicably turned pro and is now in the D-League with the Delaware 87ers.\n\nOnly three scholarship players off last year's team returned to St. John's this year. Those three averaged a combined 4.0 points last season.\n\nMullin, who spent time in NBA front offices but had never coached a game in his life, had to bring in seven freshmen, two grad transfers, one transfer from a four-year school and a junior college transfer to fill out his roster.\n\nSo how did St. John's get to this point?\n\nThe one-and-done departures of players like Moe Harkless and JaKarr Sampson hurt. So did Lavin's gamble of taking some at-risk recruits. And the big recruiting class that included Harrison, Greene, Pointer and Branch almost became an albatross for the program. They took up playing time and, yet, never took St. John's back to a consistent level of success.\n\n\"It should be noted that it's not like they have a huge NCAA Tournament drought like a Rutgers,'' Adam Zagoria of SNY, said. \"That said, they're obviously a program in a period of major transition. They have a first-year head coach who's a Hall of Famer and a New York legend, but he had never coached a game before this year. You combine that with the fact that they turned over virtually their entire roster.\n\nThey've got nine new players. It's a major overhaul.''\n\nThe scope of the rebuilding job ahead of Mullin became apparent when the Red Storm suffered a 32-point exhibition loss to Division II St. Thomas Aquinas.\n\nSt. John's is currently off to a 6-3 start to the season, including a loss to Fordham. The Red Storm will host Syracuse (7-2) at Madison Square Garden at noon Sunday (FOX Sports 1).\n\nESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla, a New York native who coached at St. John's in 1997 and 1998, likened the current situation at the school to the Cleveland Browns after the NFL franchise left for Baltimore.\n\n\"Right now, they have an expansion team,'' Fraschilla said. \"They're like the Cleveland Browns. The team left for Baltimore, but they put a team back in Cleveland. This is like the Browns. You have a familiar name, but it's all being rebuilt. They're building a franchise all over again.''\n\nNot just rebuilding a franchise, but reconnecting with a city and it's high school recruits.\n\nSince Erick Barkley was a first-round pick in 2000, St. John's has had just one player go in the first round of the NBA draft. That was Harkless in 2012.\n\nSince St. John's advanced to the Sweet 16 in the 1999 NCAA Tournament, the Red Storm's NCAA Tournament record is 0-3.\n\n\"There's a generation of kids that hasn't grown up wanting to go to St. John's,'' ESPN's Jeff Goodman said. \"The tradition pre-dates them.''\n\nThe last time St. John's was good the roster included New Yorkers like Ron Artest, Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton. The 1985 Final Four team included Mullin, Walter Berry and Mark Jackson.\n\n\"The life-blood of St. John's basketball was in the recruiting of its backyard,'' Fraschilla said. \"No school relied on its local talent more than St. John's did through its history.''\n\nSt. John's got away from its New York roots under former coach Mike Jarvis. He almost famously refused to curry favor amongst the city's high school and AAU coaches.\n\nNow, Mullin has returned to his alma mater. He's hired two big-time recruiting assistants in Barry Rohrssen, a Brooklyn native, and Matt Abdelmassih, a St. John's alum. But the recruiting landscape in New York City has changed.\n\n\"There isn't the talent in New York City that was there 10 to 15 years ago,'' Fraschilla said. \"A lot of the really good young high school talent in New York leaves the city early in their high school careers and they go to prep schools and they learn to be away from New York City. There's not the pipeline of talent that there used to be.''\n\nGoodman agreed, but noted that New York City is still a hot-bed for recruits.\n\n\"There are a lot of mid-major kids in New York, but not nearly as many high-major kids,'' Goodman said. \"There's still more talent in New York than there is in Iowa and (former Iowa State coach) Fred Hoiberg was able to do it.''\n\nMullin and his staff hit the ground running last spring and didn't stop recruiting all summer. Mullin was adding new players to the roster into late August and early September.\n\n\"I think Chris made two very smart hires in Slice (Rohrssen) and Matt,'' Zagoria said. Rohrssen had been an assistant at Kentucky, while Abdelmassih was at Iowa State. \"He said repeatedly that he wasn't familiar with the college game and he wanted guys that were familiar with recruiting and the college game. I think Chris is to be credited for those hires.''\n\nGoodman said St. John's can sell recruits on the opportunity to be the star who helps resurrect the program, while playing for an NBA legend.\n\n\"They have to recruit really well,'' Fraschilla said. \"Once they do that, I'm certain Chris can coach and will grow into the coaching aspect. But we really won't know until the cupboard starts filling up.''\n\nUntil then, Zagoria said, St. John's fans will have to be patient.\n\n\"A lot of people at the press conference thought he would snap his fingers and it would be 1985 all over again,'' Zagoria said. \"It's not 1985. You're not going to build a team based almost entirely on guys from New York like Chris Mullin, Mark Jackson and Walter Berry.\n\n\"I think Chris gets it,'' Zagoria added. \"He's very patient. He understands it's a process.''"
