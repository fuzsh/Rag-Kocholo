Now they’ll face Oklahoma in what amounts to yet another virtual Flyers home game. I believe that’s the first “upset” of what was a very mild day at the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.\n\nThat’ll do it for our day-long coverage - there’s plenty more to come from The Guardian, but for now, wherever you are, good morning, good afternoon, and goodnight.\n\nShare\n\nHenton hits a three from downtown...Berlin. That cuts the lead to 10 with 1:25 remaining.\n\nI’m going to go out on a limb right here and say this isn’t going to end well for the Friars, who will become Dayton’s 19th victim in the state of Ohio this season.\n\nShare\n\nPierre drives, stops, spins the other way, releases and gets a friendly bounce - and one!\n\nThe Flyers are on a 9-0 run - it’s 56-42 with just over two minutes to play!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.57 CET\n\nProvidence head coach Ed Cooley is huddling with his players, slaps a chair down to the floor, and is hit with a technical foul. I don’t know if he got it because the official thought he was expressing frustration with his work, or because he was hitting furniture, which is just not that cool.\n\nSibert hits the t-free-throw.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.54 CET\n\nPierre with the step, and the spin - it’s, it’s literally sitting on the rim...\n\n...now it’s not - the ball is out and in the hands of Providence, who come the other way. Henton hit as a layup.\n\nThen Jordan Sibert hits a three...and so does Pierre! It’s 50-42 Dayton with 3:53 to go! They’ve played five games in eight nights - how do they do it?\n\nWith very little travel maybe? (cheap shot)\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.50 CET\n\nDayton flying away? Not- so - fast.\n\nLaDontae Henton has a three-ball of his own, and the lead is back to six. Now Providence get a stop, before Ben Bentil is fouled underneath by Scoochie Smith.\n\nIf I was named Scoochie I’d be lashing out as well.\n\nBentil hits one of two free-throws, it’s a five point game. There’s 8:15 on the clock.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.38 CET\n\nDarrell Davis from the near corner beyond the arc - swish!\n\nKyle Dunn, underneath for Providence - he can’t hit the layup.\n\nBack come Dayton - here’s Dyshawn Pierre for three - YES!!!\n\nIt’s a flurry, from the Flyers, who are suddenly up by nine, 44-35, with 10:21 to go in the second half!\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.33 CET\n\nOK, there it is.\n\nDayton are enjoying a three point lead, just an hour-and-a-half from their home floor - a nice little perk for a lower seed who had to sneak into the tournament after winning a game on their actual home floor.\n\nHmmmm...\n\n11:33 remaining in the final game of the second round of the Men’s NCAA Basketball Tournament.\n\nShare\n\nNow I actually have to find TruTV to watch Providence and Dayton...I’ll send out a search party.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.25 CET\n\nGonzaga 86-76 North Dakota State\n\nNow the Bulldogs have to face Iowa and that Aaron White - America’s hottest property - a universally respected scoring machine who is all but guaranteed to break your heart.\n\nGood luck with that Zagies.\n\nShare\n\nIt’s an outrage, really.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nGonzaga have finally pulled away from NDSU and this time it’s likely for good.\n\nThe Bulldogs are up 13 with just over two minutes remaining.\n\nBut wherever you are, tip your cap to Dexter Werner, who put together a 22-point night. Big, messy, hard working and skillful. Every team needs a Dexter Werner.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.10 CET\n\nDayton and Providence, who are lighting it up in Columbus, are at the half. The Flyers are up 28-25, shooting 40% from the field, while the Friars have shot just 34%.\n\nShare\n\nOH MY - Werner is spinning, off balance, all this man just bouncing around the court, hitting a layup, falling away! It’s a six point game....until, until...Gonzaga, answer again. Kevin Pangos hits a three...and is FOULED!\n\nPangos converts a four-point play and the Zags, who bend somewhat but have yet to break, are up 10 once again. Wild stuff, really. NDSU deserve a lot of credit for their sheer entertainment value.\n\nFive minutes remain.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 05.17 CET\n\nSan Diego State 76-64 St John's\n\nSteve Lavin and his St John’s Red Storm are going home - they missed their center in this one, no doubt. They’ll be tears just off the Horace Harding expressway tonight.\n\nSDSU hold serve and graduate to a match-up against Duke, who will batter them silly. Regardless, Steve Fisher, a good coach, has his chance at the upset.\n\nShare\n\nWhat the?\n\nWerner - a total bull (Bison?) - bruising underneath, hits a layup. Then he hits a little j. It’s a seven point Bulldogs lead, just like that, 63-56, with 8:44 left to play.\n\nShare\n\nHOLD EVERYTHING! HERE COME THE BISON!\n\nDexter Werner with a move inside, draws the foul and the lead is down to six!\n\nAnd then it’s not.\n\nA Witjer jumper. A Dranginis dunk. A Sabonis pop.\n\nWe’re suddenly back to a 12 point lead for Gonzaga.\n\nWas that just a dream?\n\nNine minutes remaining...\n\nShare\n\nThe Knicks’ version, not the Cavs’ version.\n\nShare\n\nHarrison, more energy for SJU - penetrating, laying it in. SDSU’s lead cut to seven.\n\nSt John’s need a stop - they get it but the break is rushed - Branch can’t hit a layup with no one underneath to rebound.\n\nNow Pope comes back for SDSU and hits a little floater.\n\nHarrison is on the near side outside the arc - he throws up an ill-advised three point shot. Ugly.\n\nThat may be the last gasp for SJU, now down nine with under five minutes to play.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 04.35 CET\n\nPrzemek Karnowski falls victim to the old finger in the eye trick from Kory Brown in the paint - it doesn’t look good, taking on a variety of colors, but he stays in the game.\n\nNow Kyle Wiltjer nails a triple as Gonzaga look to pull away. It’s 48-35 with 15:35 remaining.\n\nShare\n\nSpencer of SDSU - the jam, of the rim-rocking variety, off a rebound!\n\nCrowd screams.\n\nThat is force.\n\nSan Diego State have an eight point lead on St John’s with under eight minutes remaining.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 04.28 CET\n\nWisconsin 86-72 Coastal Carolina, Final\n\nThe Badgers move on - they face Oregon next.\n\nShare\n\nIn 8:12 of play, the Friars and the Flyers have combined for a total of 11 points. Think the opposite Loyola Marymount’s 1990 edition.\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nD’Angelo Harrison of St John’s is fouled as he missed a layup and is very fired up. Flexing, talking to himself, all of that. He’s trying to will SJU back into this game against a surprisingly offensive SDSU ballcub.\n\nThe Johnnies are down nine now as we approach 12:00 remaining.\n\nShare\n\nWisconsin have their biggest game of the night after Haye feeds Duje Dukan for the dunk. Badger fans seem to be happy enough to have made the trip, which is something considering the schlep to Nebraska. They’re up 77-56 with close to four minutes remaining in the game.\n\nShare\n\nIt’s not bad enough that it’s snowing on the first day of spring in New York - now the Johnnies are down 53-41, with Polee and O’Brien having their way, combining for 29 points.\n\nShare\n\nBison vs Bulldogs - normally you’d have to go with the size of the Bison.\n\nBulldogs can really be much more of a mess than advertised. Drooling everywhere, respiratory problems, etc.. Really, it’s an odd choice in mascot when you think about it.\n\nDespite such limitations, Bulldogs are crushing Bison tonight, 43-30 at the half.\n\nShare\n\nIt’s time for Dayton vs Providence who have only just begun in Columbus.\n\nHow will Dayton respond playing their fifth game in eight nights?\n\nShare\n\nDid I mention Wisconsin and Coastal Carolina were back in action?\n\nNo?\n\nWell, the Badgers are up 19 and all-signs point to extensive gar-bage time in Omaha. Frank Kaminsky, Dekker and Hayes have combined for 46 points - Wisconsin are on a 7-0 run as we near the mid-point of the second half.\n\nShare\n\nPrzemek Karnowski is a real man - exerting his Polish, 7ft1 authority under the hoop, muscling in a layup - and one! He misses the free-throw and Gonzaga are up 30-18. NDSU have done themselves no favors at all, turning the ball over six times.\n\nUnder seven minutes to go in the half.\n\nShare\n\nD’Angelo Harrison is able to connect from downtown for a badly needed thre to bring SJU within five...\n\n...but as time expires, a 6’10” forward named Malik Pope hits from the perimeter, giving his Aztecs a 40-33 halftime lead.\n\nIf we can score the same number of points in the second half, I like them.\n\n-SDSU head coach Steve Fisher is impressed with the output of his offensively challenged team.\n\nShare\n\nKyle “I rebuilt my entire body after leaving Kentucky” Wiltjer drains a three to put the Zags up 19-13.\n\nShare\n\nOklahoma 69-60 Albany, Final\n\nThe Sooners hold off Albany, which means that both SUNY teams are heading home, one and done.\n\nHold your heads high men - from Plattsburgh, to Binghamton, to Geneseso, to Oswego to Cobleskill, to Oneonta to Brockport, to Purchase to New Paltz - we’re all proud.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.27 CET\n\nGonzaga and North Dakota State University are off - Kory Brown has five of the Bisons first nine points as the Zags lead 11-9 with close to five minutes gone by in Seattle.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 03.55 CET"
