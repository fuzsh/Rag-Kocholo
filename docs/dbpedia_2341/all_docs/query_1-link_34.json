        "text": "NCAA Basketball: NCAA Tournament-St. John's Practice\n\nSt. John's Red Storm head coach Steve Lavin during practice before the second round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament at Time Warner Cable Arena. (Bob Donnan | USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe 2015 NCAA Tournament continues Friday, March 20, with San Diego State (26-8) facing St. John's (21-11) at Time Warner Cable Arena, Charlotte, N.C., at approximately 9:40 p.m.\n\nCBS will broadcast the game, with live streaming available via NCAA March Madness Live.\n\nHere's what The Associated Press says about the matchup:\n\nSt. John's coach Steve Lavin said that while center Chris Obekpa's suspension is \"less than ideal,\" he still believes the Red Storm has what it takes to overcome the shot blocker's absence in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\"We have had a number of stretches where we have had to play without Chris and been successful,\" Lavin said Thursday at press conference.\n\nThe Red Storm, the ninth seed in the South region, faces No. 8 seed San Diego State on Friday in Charlotte.\n\n\"Whether it was through foul trouble, being disqualified for a game or for a number of injuries he's endured, this team has found a way to offset the loss the Chris in games and stretches of the season and still been successful,\" Lavin said. \"With that said, we understand with not having Chris at the goal as our protector will make it difficult for us.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Obekpa started 24 of 30 games for St. John's (21-11) this season, averaging 5.8 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game. His 321 career blocks are the most in school history.\n\nObekpa's loss made St. John's bid to win its first NCAA Tournament game since 2000 a little more difficult.\n\nSan Diego State coach Steve Fisher said the Red Storm is still dangerous without Obekpa in the middle.\n\n\"Obviously they are not as good without him, but they are still good enough,\" Fisher said.\n\nHere are the full tournament schedule and results through Thursday:\n\nAll Times EDT\n\nFirst Four\n\nAt UD Arena\n\nDayton, Ohio\n\nTuesday, March 17\n\nHampton 74, Manhattan 64\n\nMississippi 94, BYU 90\n\nWednesday, March 18\n\nRobert Morris 81, North Florida 77\n\nDayton 56, Boise State 55\n\nEAST REGIONAL\n\nRound of 64\n\nThursday, March 19\n\nAt CONSOL Energy Center, Pittsburgh\n\nVillanova 93, Lafayette 52\n\nN.C.
