        "text": "Arizona State could be taking a significant step in securing its next basketball coach.\n\nVice President of Athletics Ray Anderson met Monday with Duke associate head coach Jeff Capel, azcentral sports confirmed. This is believed to be the first face-to-face meeting ASU has had with a candidate to replace fired coach Herb Sendek. The location of the meeting was not known.\n\nCapel, 40, was in Houston on Sunday, helping Duke beat Gonzaga in the South Regional Final to advance to this week's Final Four in Indianapolis. He has previous head-coaching experience, taking Virginia Commonwealth to one NCAA Tournament in four years and leading Oklahoma to two (including the 2009 Elite Eight) in five.\n\nOklahoma fired Capel (who had five years left on his contract) in 2011 after the Sooners posted the first back-to-back losing seasons in 45 years. At the time, the NCAA investigated Oklahoma -- and later placed the program on three years' probation -- but Capel was cleared of wrong-doing.\n\nCapel has spent the last four years on Mike Krzyzewski's staff at Duke, helping bring in top players such as Jabari Parker, Tyus Jones and Jahlil Okafor. Last week, Krzyzewski said prior to this season he alternated scouting responsibilities among his assistants. This year, he and Capel shared the job.\n\n\"Jeff already has been a great coach,\" Krzyzewski told reporters. \"He really started that VCU program and then when he went to Oklahoma he had the Player of the Year (in Blake Griffin), and then obviously he didn't have the commitment that I have here. Jeff's a big-time head coach. ... He's a natural. Something great will happen for him.\"\n\nASU also has talked with Buffalo coach Bobby Hurley and has interest in Texas Christian's Trent Johnson. Former St. John's coach Steve Lavin is interested in the job and has support around the program. According to sources, former NBA head coaches Avery Johnson and Alvin Gentry also have interest. Gentry is associate head coach on Steve Kerr's staff with the Golden State Warriors."
