You are a physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual being. Are you filling up YOU first? ' I have found that many times, Christian women, have their fountains up-side-down. We think our business, volunteering, and networking are what fills us up. We try to fill the largest cup first and then spill over to our families, closest friends, and spouses. By the time we get to the smallest cup, ourselves, there is nothing left. We are barely surviving because we are dehydrated. Have you felt like this?

Emotionally, take time to do things you enjoy, things that bring you contentment when you do them. Intellectually, read a book or listen to a podcast. Take a class, hire a coach, or join a meet-up that interests you. Spiritually, plan a time each day to read the Bible and pray. Find your unique way to spend time with God. Only by filling up yourself each day can you overflow in your life without dehydration. You give your best self to others when you allow the Source to fill you up.

Until we muster the courage to confront these shadows, the cycle of ups and downs will persist, casting a shadow over our lives. Facing our childhood traumas is not for the faint of heart. It requires us to delve into the depths of our pain, to revisit memories long buried, and to confront the demons that have haunted us for far too long. But in facing our past, we reclaim our power. We release ourselves from the chains of our own history and pave the way for a brighter, more liberated future. It won't be easy. It will be painful. But it will also be transformative. As we confront our demons head-on, we emerge stronger, wiser, and more resilient than ever before. So, don't shy away from the darkness within. Embrace it, confront it, and watch as it loses its grip on your life, making way for a future filled with light and possibility. #ConfrontYourDemons #HealingJourney #SelfReflection #PersonalGrowth #InnerStrength #EmotionalWellness #BreakTheCycle #Transformation #ReflectAndGrow #Motivation #Empowerment #OvercomeObstacles #FaceYourFears #PositiveChange\" PC: Copyright to the respective photo owner\n\nüíåHave you ever heard \" You need power only when you need to do something harmful otherwise, Love is enough to conquer all\"üíñ üåèIn a world where everyone is following\"Power\", \"Paisa\"(money) and *Pohanch\" (Authority), Kindness and honesty is the bravest thing to existüíù Bravery, power, and kindness intertwine in a symphony of human resilience and compassion. Bravery isn't the absence of fear, but the courage to confront it head-on, to stare into the abyss and choose to move forward despite uncertainty. It's found in the firefighter rushing into a burning buildingüî•, driven by a selfless determination to save lives, and in the child standing up to a bully, fueled by an innate sense of justice‚öñÔ∏è Power, often misunderstood, isn't just about strength or authority; it's about using one's abilities for good, to uplift and empower othersü§ù It resides in the teacher who empowers young minds with knowledgeüí°, in the activist who fights for justice against all odds, and in the quiet strength of a caregiver who tends tirelessly to those in need! Kindnessüíü, the gentle force that binds communities and heals wounds, is the purest manifestation of humanity's potential. It's found in the small gestures of strangers helping one another, in the forgiveness that bridges divides, and in the empathy that sees beyond differences to connect heartsüíû When bravery, power, and kindness converge, they form an unstoppable force for positive changeüí´. They inspire us to stand firm in our beliefs, to uplift others with our strengths, and to sow seeds of compassion wherever we go. Together, they remind us that within each of us lies the capacity to make a profound difference in the world, one courageous, powerful, and kind act at a timeü•Ç. #kindness #positivity #motivation #empathy #compassion #strength\n\nMe vs. Me The best way of being miserable and making other people‚Äôs lives miserable is to compare yourself with others. Healthy competition is fine. I love watching sports. As a kid I loved competing. I lost often. I won often. I learned to respectfully win and to lose with dignity. Growing up though you will need to stop constantly competing and comparing. You don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on in someone else‚Äôs lives. Yes, maybe your colleague just got a promotion, but their mother was just with cancer. Maybe your friend from college just got a raise, but is undergoing a divorce. No one has it all at the same time. I focus on being a better human being, a better employer, a better partner, a better board member compared to yesterday. When I see someone succeed I don‚Äôt ask myself why he or she? I ask myself what does it take for me to get there, and is it worth the effort and sacrifices compared to the goals I have in life. And if the answer is yes: I will enter the competition stage. Against myself! Because: It‚Äôs Me vs. Me. And: YOU are uniquely YOU. #competition #growthepie #generosity #stopthejealousy #chancengerechtigkeit #g√∂nnenk√∂nnen\n\nI want my children to believe they can achieve all they want without feeling scared. Without feeling doubt. Without feeling thinking why do I need to go to school or why I need to go to this birthday party. We want our children to feel comfortable, we want them to feel content and happy within. How can this be possible? You probably know where I might going with this, if you have been following me for some time‚Ä¶. It starts with us parents. When we model believing in ourselves in front of the children. They also sense when we feeling low, how we talk when things are not working. ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do this‚Äô ‚ÄòNo one‚Äôs going to believe me‚Äô ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äô Believing in yourself is the key to unlocking your true power and potential. Allowing yourself to tap into that inner energy, self love, and mindset to make your goals a reality. Surround yourself with inspiring people who will help you reach success! Your mind plays a huge part in determining your success in life. As Henry Ford famously said, ‚ÄúWhether you think you can or you can‚Äôt, you‚Äôre right.‚Äù Really powerful quote. When you tell yourself, you can, there‚Äôs no stopping you. You have everything to work for. Switch your focus to what you want for your children and this will drive you to your goals and give you that extra boost to believe when you put your mind to supporting your children, anything is possible. Just like when someone speaks negative about our children, we get that burn to protect our children. It‚Äôs the same when it comes to believing in yourself and transferring this to your children. #selfbelieve #limitedbelieves #selflove #selfcare #power #energy #mindset #growthmondset #fixedmindset #thoughts #affrimations #inspirations #resources #autism #children #parents #protect\n\nInsecurities ... Our greatest fear ... Those feelings of inadequacy ... The truth is, what you're afraid of is not as big as you're seeing it. In fact, it might never happen. But being consumed by its fear is enough to destroy. Like one of my favorite quotes says, \"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\" This, this is the best thing I've ever come across. There is everything you need, the confirmation you're looking for. ¬©Ô∏è She0pe #thursday #risingaboveinsecurities #selflove #motivation #inspiration #empowerment #innerstrength #shinebright #positivity"
