(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n\n(Jeff Chiu)\n\nNEW YORK -- St. John's has decided its basketball future rests with the best of its past.\n\nChris Mullin, St. John's all-time leading scorer and still the face of its basketball program three decades after his career ended, has agreed to coach the Red Storm, a person with knowledge of the discussions told The Associated Press on Monday.\n\nMullin, who led St. John's to the Final Four in 1985, has never coached at any level. He replaces Steve Lavin who agreed to leave last week, after five seasons during which the Red Storm reached the NCAA Tournament twice.\n\nMullin, a New York native, was a five-time All-Star with Golden State, a member of the USA's gold-medal winning \"Dream Team\" in 1992 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. He was presented for induction by his coach at St. John's, Hall of Famer Lou Carnesecca.\n\n____________"
