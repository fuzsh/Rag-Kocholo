        "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP)  Steve Lavin expects that Chris Obekpa’s basketball career at St. John’s is over.\n\nThe junior center was suspended on Sunday for a violation of team rules and did not play in St. John’s season-ending 76-64 loss Friday night to San Diego State in the opening round game of the NCAA Tournament.\n\n“We’ve texted the last couple days, we’ve been in communication and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if he doesn’t return to St. John’s,” Lavin said.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 Obekpa started 24 of 30 games for St. John’s (21-11) this season, averaging 5.8 points, 7.0 rebounds and 3.2 blocks per game.\n\nHis 321 career blocks are the most in school history.\n\nHis absence was a big factor in St. John’s early exit from the tournament. It didn’t help that Sir’Dominic Pointer had to play through a hip injury and Rysheed Jordan picked up two early fouls and had to sit most of the first half.\n\n“The combination of Pointer being injured, Rysheed Jordan being in foul trouble and obviously we know we didn’t have Chris Obekpa’s services, and yet it’s still a seven-point game with multiple possessions and a chance to cut it inside of 7  so these kids are superheros in my eyes,” Lavin said.\n\nSDSU’s JJ O’Brien scored 18 points, Dwayne Polee II added 15 points on five 3-pointers against his former team. Skylar Spencer added 10 points and seven rebounds for the Aztecs (27-8), who’ll face the South’s top seed Duke on Sunday.\n\nAztecs coach Steve Fisher said he never expected his team to shoot 22 3-pointers, particularly against a team they held a big height advantage over.\n\nBut Fisher figured if it was working, why change?\n\n“The 3s we got were wide open and were taken by guys who can shoot and make them,” Fisher said.\n\nThe Aztecs never trailed in the second half and improved to 6-4 in NCAA Tournament play since 2011.\n\nPolee, who transferred from St. John’s early in his college career, made national headlines when he collapsed on the court during a game against UC Riverside in December because of an irregular heartbeat, so his big night was extra rewarding.\n\nHe was 5 of 7 on 3-pointers.\n\n“My teammates found me in a position where I could shoot the ball,” Polee said. “I was open because we have a lot of great players on this team that allowed me to get open.”\n\nPointer had 21 points and 10 rebounds, and D’Angelo Harrison added 18 points for St. John’s, which failed in its quest to win its first tournament game since 2000.\n\nJordan, whom Lavin called the “catalyst” down the stretch run this season, finished with 10 points including one high-flying dunk on a baseline drive, reminiscent of another Jordan who once wore No. 23 and currently owns the NBA’s Hornets, which play in this building.\n\nLavin second-guessed himself after the game, wondering if he should have brought Jordan back in the first half.\n\nHe called Jordan’s early foul trouble the difference in the game.\n\nObekpa’s absence was big too.\n\nWith the nation’s fifth-leading shot blocker out, San Diego State’s height was a factor all night. The Aztecs held a 40-32 edge on the glass and had 13 offensive rebounds.\n\n“Our goal was to get the first rebound, but they were just bigger than us on some plays and there was nothing we could do about it,” Harrison said.\n\nPolee set the tone early knocking down three 3-pointers in the first five minutes  including two off the glass  for an early 13-6 lead. San Diego State was 7 of 16 from beyond the arc in the first half.\n\nDespite the loss, Lavin repeated what he said earlier in the week, calling it the most gratifying season of his coaching career, and thanked his seniors for taking him on an “incredible ride.”\n\n“True to form, they fought and scrapped and showed grit until the end,” Lavin said.\n\n___\n\nTIP-INS\n\nSt. John’s: St. John’s only attempted one free throw in the first half.\n\nSan Diego State: In the waning moments of the game, San Diego State fans began chanting “We want Duke!”\n\nEMOTIONAL LEADER\n\nGuard Aqeel Quinn only played 19 points for San Diego State after battling a case of food poisoning. Fisher said he hopes Quinn will be ready to go in the next game after a day of rest.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nSt. John’s: Season is over.\n\nSan Diego State: Will face top-seeded Duke on Sunday in the round of 32."
