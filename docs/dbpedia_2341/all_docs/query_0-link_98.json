        "text": "Look for Howland to change his mind about Miss St due to \"family issue.\" It will be due to someone in his family suffering from asthma and the Arizona climate will be better for his family.\n\nIs ASU a better job than Mississippi State when they have to recruit against Arizona and UCLA?\n\nTempe over Starkesville any day of course.\n\nBye bye Rick Barnes. Guess Underwood takes that job.\n\nIf Underwood goes to Texas, Capel to ASU, and Marshall to Bama does that bode well for us landing Prohm? What other jobs are actually better than ours at that point?\n\nIf I were Marshall I wouldn't leave Wichita. Do they just promote one of his assistants if he does leave?\n\nSo many questions. So many possibilities. My work productivity has been at an all-time low since Hewitt was fired. Checking the boards constantly. It's f***ig great to be back.\n\nI can't imagine Marshall leaving Wichita for Bama. Have to think he wants one more go around with Baker and VanVleet as seniors next season. But if he does, I could see Prohm going to Wichita.\n\nThe other job to watch is St. Johns, although I think they would take O'Toole or Bobby Hurley.\n\nI can't imagine Marshall leaving Wichita for Bama.

A-10 is in a more solid position for multiple bids going forward than the MVC, who has seen defections in recent years.\n\nI don't think Prohm would leave for an MVC job (even WSU). A-10 is in a more solid position for multiple bids going forward than the MVC, who has seen defections in recent years.\n\nWichita has big money, a sold-out 10,000-seat arena, a private jet for recruiting and a top-15 national program.\n\nTheir job might as well be in another universe from ours.\n\nIf Marshall gets greedy and jumps at the $3MM being dangled in front of his face -- and I don't think he will -- I could very easily see Prohm going to WSU.\n\nDoes anybody snatch up Barnes for one of these open positions? The nostalgic part of me would love to see him come back, but I don't see Edwards going anywhere near another fired coach. We need some new blood.\n\nThat is a tough one. 17 years at Texas, 16 years of NCAA and 1 CBI. 15 20+ win seasons. The man has made the NCAAs and a few NITs EVERY YEAR but 2 since 1991. 3 years if you go back to his first HC gig at Mason in 1987.\n\nNow the devil is in the details like Hewitt and I havent done the research. His in conference ranking has been down over the past 7 years and that is the big angst.\n\nMaybe its just a big name school needing a new girlfriend, whereas most other non BCS school would be thrilled with those results...."
