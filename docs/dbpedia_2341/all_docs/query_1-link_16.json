        "text": "Who's next?\n\nNow that Dave Rice has been fired as UNLV men's basketball coach, who will be the next coach? Keep your eye on these names:\n\nSteve Lavin, ESPN analyst: The former UCLA and St. John's coach is working as a broadcaster on prime-time games. The buzz around Las Vegas is that he already has been campaigning among boosters to be the next coach. He compiled a 226-133 record in 12 seasons, including eight NCAA Tournament trips that yielded one Elite Eight and four Sweet Sixteens.\n\nMarvin Menzies, New Mexico State coach: The former UNLV assistant (2004-05) has been coaching in Las Cruces for nine seasons, taking the Aggies to the NCAA Tournament five times. They have won two Western Athletic Conference regular-season titles and five tournament titles under Menzies, who is 175-100.\n\nDan Majerle, Grand Canyon College coach: At one time thought to be the heir apparent to the Phoenix Suns' coaching job, Majerle has been building Grand Canyon into a Division I team with the help of former Suns owner Jerry Colangelo and a new 7,000-plus seat arena on the west Phoenix campus. The Antelopes are 47-32 in his three seasons, including 15-2 this season.\n\nJustin Hutson, San Diego State assistant coach: Hutson was the lead assistant during Rice's first two seasons (2011-13), both NCAA Tournament teams. He returned to the Aztecs the following season as associate head coach and was named one of the top 10 recruiting assistants in the nation in a poll of Division I coaches by ESPN.\n\nSteve Henson, Oklahoma assistant coach: He was one of Lon Kruger's key assistants during their seven years at UNLV. He went with Kruger to Oklahoma, where they have built one of the top teams in the nation, including a 15-1 record this season.\n\nJay Wright, Villanova coach: Wright has coached the Wildcats for 15 seasons, with an 11-2 record this season. His name comes up about possible UNLV openings because talk is that he yearns to return to the West and remains fond of the UNLV program. He was an assistant for two years at UNLV under Rollie Massimino before leaving for the Hofstra head-coaching job. But he would be pricey: USA Today reported he makes $2.7 million a year, ranking him as the third highest-paid private school coach in the country. Rice was estimated to make about $2 million less than that."
