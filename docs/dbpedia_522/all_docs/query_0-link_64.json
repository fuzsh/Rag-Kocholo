These chap, %_.Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Militc -y Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence and Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Some chaptors, particularly Science and Intelligence and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, arF produced selectively. For small countries requiring only linimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound Into one volume. Supple,nenting the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence Fact book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An Lfnclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detoi;ed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to be available as long -,s the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound 'Intrt the concurrent classified Factbook. The I; Yentory lists all NIS units by area name and number and includes classification and date of issues it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as we:l as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, oI- separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the D- ease Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee.

Appraisal (C) Transportation and telecommunications (telecorn) in Sweden are excellent, fully capable of meeting economic needs and of supporting moderate to heavy military operations, In proportion to the population, the density of both systems is probably the highest in i Europe. Geography and the broad dispersal of the population have influenced the pattern of the networks. Most of the major ports and by far the greater portion of raiLoad, highway, and inland waterway mileage are located in the south (Figure 8). Except in the Kiruna iron ore area, the land in the north, especially above, the Arctic Circle, is considerably less developed. In most of the country the cold winter climate affects transportation and telecommunications, presenting problems in construe tion, maintenance, and operation. Railroads are the primary means of long-distance Iransportation, but competition from highway transport is continually increasing. Stockholm is the focal point of the rail network, with lines radiating to the larger ports and major cities. Three lines connect Stockholm with the north, west, and south; another, a connecting route, permits north -south traffic to avoid the largest lakes without hating to make major east- west diversions. Train -ferry connections are made with Denmark, West Germanv, East Germany, and Finland. fpil*hway transport provides short -haul feeder service to the railroads and is the country's leading passenger carrier. In many sections of central and northern Sweden, highways afford the only means of transport; however, the network there is inadequate because of the steady growth of traffic and the paucity of alternative routes. Of the 1970 total freight traffic of 34 billion tun miles, highways accounted for 19 billion ton miles. Highway transport handled about 98% of all short -haul traffic, which accounted for 80% of the total highway traffic. Principal commodities moved were manufactured and semi manufactured goods and agricultural products. Inland waterway transport plays a significant role in the economy, Although handling only 2% of the annual total freight tonnage moved by the three modes, waterways account for about 14% of the total ton miles. Ocean transport is vital to Sweden's economy. More than 160 ports are scattered along the lung coastline, and the merchant fleet ranks high in deadweight tonnage among the nations of the world. About 80% of the merchant fleet is engaged in profitable trade between foreign countries. The fleet carries nearly 30% of the nation's international seaborne exports. Civil aviation, supported by an extensive system of excellent airfields, is becoming increasingly significant to the expanding economy. The government views air transport as a means of developing commerce, tourism, and international g. ^d will. Sweden has 65 major aircraft registered. Telecom facilities are among the best in the world and satisfy the requirements of the public, government, and private enterprise. 'Telephone is the APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 most used service, but extensive telegraph and broadcast services are also available. Domestic and international communications are handle) by an integrated system of cables, open -wire lines, and radio -relay links. AM, FM, and TV services reach over 90% of the population. The principal telecom centers are, Stockholm, Goteborg,' and Malmo. Most transportation and telecommunications are administered by the Ministry of Communications and its subordinate agencies. Public and private ownership of rail, highway, and waterway faciliJes exist side by side. Most ports are owned by the municipalities in which they are located; most telecom facilities are government owned. Several plans for the improvement of both transportation and telecommunications are being implemented. Railroads are being improved through modernization of facilities and equipment, but no new rail construction is envisioned. Highway development is being implemented through a 15 -year road plan (1970 -85). The plan calls for construction of almost 1,000 miles of limited access, four -lane divided motorways, most of them in the Stockholm area, and about 5,600 miles of two- and four -lane national highways. Major maintenance is to be performed on 100,000 miles of state, municipal, anct private roads. Facilities at all major ports are being continually improved, and most of the significant airfields are benefiting from a long -term modernization program, which began in !950. Sweden is also improving its already outstanding telecom system. A major project underway is designed to reinforce substantially the coaxial cable system and provide it with the world's largest transmitting capacity. B. Strategic mobility (C) Sustained movement and resupply operations in support of military forces in southern Sweden would be accomplished over excellent transportation and telecommunications systems. The high density and quality of the area's rail network would facilitate major operations. The most important highways- between Oslo and Stockholm, 3torlien and Sundsvall, and Halsingborg and Sundsvall via Jonkoping and Stockholm --all have sufficient widths to handle two lanes of resupply traffic. Inland waterways would be useful in the movement of bulk cargos. In the north and north- central parts of Sweden the low density of the rail network, its lack of alternate routes, and its high wAlnerability to interdiction and 'For diacritics on place names see the list of names on the apron of the Termin and Transportation map and the map itself. 2 interruption would 1wrrnit only limited military support. Above the 60th parallel the highway network s incapable c,f supporting sustained movement Ix-cause of the paucity of roads, severe damaging effects of spring thaws, and low road and bridge capacities. Sweden's 162 usab'e airfields could assume varying roles in support of military forces; however, only a few fields are located ;n the north. The chief role of the air force is defensive; consequently. very few airfields are capable of supporting sustained operations of aircraft heavier than medium or light bombers. The limited quat:tily of fuel available is also an adverse factor. Underground hangars have been constructed at a few airfields. In the event of war or other national emergency requiring augmentation of the Royal Swedish Air Force's airlift capability, th,-, Swedish registered transport aircraft and Swedish personnel of the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) could be withdrawn from the consortium and used for military purposes. The considerable government holdings in I.Anjeflug AB would assure the ready transfer of the company's aircraft to the military, and the aircraft of the nonscheduled and other aviation enterprises could be acquired by requisition. All of Sweden's major ports and most of the minor facilities are adaptable to w'..litary use. The merchant fieet's 146 cargo -type ships (dry cargo, roll -on roll off /container, roll -on roll -off /trailer, container, and timber carries), which have a capacity r about 1,070,000 deadweight tons, have extensive potential for short -haul (48 hours' steaming) troop -lift and logistics support in nearseas operations. however. a large number of these ships are employed in crosstrades between foreign countries and might not be readily available for military support operations. About 30% of the units have booms of 40 tons or more lift and hatches of more ihan 50 feet in length. With expansion of the normal passenger capacity, the 12- passenger and two- passenger /cargo ships would have considerable potential for longer haul (more than 48 hours' steaming) troop transport. The 46 tankers, which have an estimated capacity of 16,720,000 U.S. barrels, could provide a moderate fleet oiler or other military support capability for a short period. The modern well integrated telecom system, especially iii the south, would be of great value to military users in large -scale operations. Major telecom facilities are well protected and would be vulnerable only to a highly concentrated sabotage effort. Most intercity cables are buried, and numerous alternate routes are available. Many telecom facilities arc installed in bombproof shelters, and emergency power APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 supplies are provided, To cut off intercity telecom circuits with Stockholm, or any other major urban area would regwre destruction of cables, radio- relav, and broadcast facilities in a wide area surrounding the city. C. Railroads (C) The rail network had decreased in s;ze in recent ,years as a result of the government policy of closing unprofitable lines which do riot provide an important service, Route mileage declined to 7,578 at the beginning of 1971 from 10,3(X) in 1954. The Swedish State Railroads (Staters fartvagar -SJ) owns and operates 7,004 miles of standard -gage (4'8 line and 165 miles of 3'6\" and 2'11\" narrow -gage line. Of SJ's 4,373 route miles of electrified line, 723 are double track. A short segment of Finnish 5'0\" broad -gage line extends into Sweden in the Haparanda region near the border. The remaining 311 miles of standard -gage and 98 miles of 211\" narrow -gage lines are privately owned and, except for one branch line listed in Figure 1, will not he covered in this study, 'The SJ, one of the largest industries in Scandinavia, is an important carrier of international traffic consisting mainly of machinery, ore, wood products, construction material, and POL. The network has one of the highest ratios of railroad mileage, to population in the world (0.92 mile per 1,000 people), and is more than adequate for the needs of the country. The SJ serves major administrative aril populated areas, industrial and mining centers, and all major ports in Sweden. Although rail and highway transport are competitive, intermodal operations are facilitated by concentrating freight handling at 32 rail centers. The SJ controls over 20% of all buses and has subsidiary trucking lines. Container operations are concentrated at the following locations: Stockholm, Goteborg, Malmo, Orebro, and Sundsvall; Vasteras is a site of future operations. Over 90,000 containers were handled by SJ in 1970, and this figure is expected to more than double by 1975. Heavy competition from highway transport, particularly for short -haui traffic (less than 60 miles), and from coastal shipping has limited the growth of the rail share of the freight market. However, the SJ continues to carry about 70% of the long- distance freight trafficï¿½ Recently the railroads have been successfir) in drawing` additional timber traffic away from waterways. The continued increase in private ownership of automobiles has lessened the growth of rail passenger traffic. The Swedish network is concentrated mainly in the southern part of the country wh2rc most of the irnpxrtant ports, population centers, and economic activities are located. The sparsely populated and less productive northern areas are linked by two north- south main lines, which are c onnecte.a by several east west lines. They far north is served by the strategic Lulea- Narvik, Norway line. The mountainous tcpogr and numerous streams and lakes throughout the country require extensive, tunneling and bridging. Be us also require special construction tec hniques and maintenance. Snowsheds and galleries in the north protect the lines from drifting snow, falling rocks, and avalanches, There are four ir.eernational rail connections with the standard -gage Norwegi;.n system: two routes lead to Oslo, one to 'Trondheim, and orre to Narvik. The last is the most importanR n:venue- producing line in the Swedish systern. A fift!i international connection is made with Finland at 1aparanda where a short segment of 5'0\" broad -gage line parallels the standard -gage line between Haparanda and 'Tornio, Finland. Freight moving between the two systems must be transloaded at Haparanda or Tornio. Regular train -ferry service affords five additional international connections: two with Denmark arid one each with Finland, East Germany, and West Germany. 'The Swedish railroads, like those of France arid West Germany, have high st andards of construction and are well maintained. The SJ is a semiautonomous agency under the Ministerof Communications. Policy control is exercised by the Railroad Board headed by a director general. In 1970 the SJ employed 47,224 personnel, down from 52,303 in 1966. Subsidiary companies employed an additional 8,030 people, The gradual decline it personnel strength is a reflection of higher wages as well as increased efficiency and mechanization. There is no shortage of skilled personnel. Intensive on -the- job training programs are conducted at two main centers: one at Stockholm for administrative training and the other at Angelholm (with branches at Revingehed /Harlosa and Ystad) for technical skills. The railroads offer afterhours courses and sponsor studies with independent institutions. A few highly qualified individuals attend advanced courses in other European countries and in the United States. The principal classification yards are located at Hallsberg, Stockholm, Mjolby, Bracke, Kristineharnn, Lanvsele, Ange, Nassjo, Malmo, Borlange, Boden, Goteborg, Riksgransen, Trelleborg, Gavle, and Charlottenberg. The facilities at Borlange and Hallsberg have automatic hump yards, and automation of the Savenas yard near Goteborg is in 3 y APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 FIGURE 1.

It is planned to add large new ferries to the Sassnitz and Naantali routes. Denmark and East Germany also operate rail ferries to Sweden. Automatic block signaling has been installed on most lines. Centralized traffic control (CTC) is in use on 1,179 miles. Most CTC is found on the heavily trafficked lines in the southern and central portions of the country and on the Luleaï¿½ Narvik line in the north. Plans call for 1,800 miles of CTC operated from 10 control centers. Administrative centers are linked by an automatic telephone network. A selective telephone network connects the stations, most of which have telegraph. Because of the great demand for complete data at all levels of operation, the teleprinter network now has over 400 terminals. in the past, radiocommunication was used chiefly in yard operations.

Starke (capacity 21), and the Drottningen (capacity 20) connect Trelleborg and Sassnitz, Fast Germany. The Drottningen also links Trelleborg with Travemunde, west Germany, and Stockholm with Naantali, Finland. The Malohus (capacity 12 two axle freight cars) connects Malmo with Copenhagen, Denmark. It is planned to add large new ferries to the Sassnitz and Naantali routes. Denmark and East Germany also operate rail ferries to Sweden. Automatic block signaling has been installed on most lines. Centralized traffic control (CTC) is in use on 1,179 miles. Most CTC is found on the heavily trafficked lines in the southern and central portions of the country and on the Luleaï¿½ Narvik line in the north. Plans call for 1,800 miles of CTC operated from 10 control centers. Administrative centers are linked by an automatic telephone network. A selective telephone network connects the stations, most of which have telegraph. Because of the great demand for complete data at all levels of operation, the teleprinter network now has over 400 terminals. in the past, radiocommunication was used chiefly in yard operations. Full -scale test of radiocommunication have been made on the Kirunaï¿½ Riksgransen line to link stations, trains, and repair and maintenance 5 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 crews. The Sj believes that the use of radios will improve train control, increase safety, arid enhance efficiency. If the tests are successful, radiocornniunica- Uons are to be introduced bc'.wecn Stockholm and Goteborg. Electric power supplies traction for 95:'ï¿½. of the freight traffic and 94 of total train miles, but only 62% of the total route mileage is electrified. In 1968 69 (the Sj fiscal year ends on 30 June) the Sj used over 1.24 billion kilowatt -hours of electricity. Sweden's abundant hydroelectric power resources are sup- plemented by thermal generating plants. Almost all of the rail system operates on 15,000 volt 16 2/3 cycle alternating c urrent which is drawn from the national grid arid converted for rail operations at strate gically located converter plants, most of which are underground. About 65 miles of line in the Stockholm area are operated on it 1,500 volt direct current system. Crude oil, imported from the Soviet Union, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, arid Nigeria, is refined domestically. 'rhe :,j used 9.8 million gallons of fuel oil in 1968 -69. 'rhe supply of arid rolling stock is adequate, and all egc`.prnent is maintained in excellent condition. The average car capacity increased from 24.6 short tons in 1965 to 26 short toes in 1970. The replacement of older locomotives with powerful new electric arid diesel- electric: units has cop'' cued. rhe Sj has fifteen 9,750- horsepower electric units, among the most powerful in the world, on the Luleaï¿½ Narvik line. Most equipment has the sta:adard European hook- link -and- screw couplers and side buffers; rail -car sets hive automatic couplers, and the new high- capacity ora- hopper cars used on the Luleaï¿½ Narvik line have automatic center- buffer couplers. Mcst of the freight cars (40,656) and about 25 of the passenger cars are suitable for use in international traffic. Most of the equipment has air brakes. All ucw equipment is designed to accommodate automatic couplers. At the beginning of 1970 the Sj equipment inventory include(] the following: Locomotives: 55.5 Diesel............................ 0 654 Electric 882 Railcars electric and diesel) 565 Passenger cars 2 X 642 Baggage and mail cars 382 Box cars 13,425 Gondolas 1,831 Flat cars 24,751 Refrigerated /insulated 1,411 Special purpose, including tank cars 6,928 '438 are under 350 hp. 6 Two -axle freight cars predominate; however, the trend is inere:.asingly toward high- capacity four -axle cars. Most rail equipment is produced domestically, but in sonic cases foreign conrlxrrtanls :ire used. Principal domestic suppliers are ASEA (Allnianna Svenska Llektriska Aktiebolaget), ASJ (Aktiebolaget Svenska farnvagsverkstadema), KVAB (Kalmar Verkstad- saktiebolag), arid Nohab. Limited quantities of rail material are purchased abroad, chiefly from tiro United Kingdom West Germany, and other Scandinavian countries. Standards of maintenance and repair are high. Major repair shops and maintenance facilities are located throughout the system: eight for electric traction mine for diesel- c iectric traction, and 14 for lolling stock. Construction acid maintenance operations are highly mechanized. Equipment is manned by a well- trained arid efficient work force. Season frozen ground, frost heaves, avalanches, washouts, snow, and extensive bogs create the greatest problems for construction and maintenance. 'I'll(- Sj administration and the Swedish Government are concentrating on improving and modernizing the existing network. A hot -box detecl- ii system is being extended, and automated safety equipment is bein installed at grade crossings. An electronic car tracing system and a centralized freight billing procedure are in operation along with an electronic passenger reservation systern. The sJ is experimenting with high- speed passenger service and is improving its roadbed to handle the increased speeds. Operating procedures are efficient and affective. There are no major, operating problems or interruption factors other than heavy snowfall in the north. Exports and imports constitute the principal traffic and are carried in almost equal proportions. The major products hauled are iron ore, wood products, iron and steel, othcr ores, POL, cement, brick, food, machinery. stone, gravel, lime, coal and cone, and grain. Iron ore carried on the Luleaï¿½ Narvik line is the chief source of freight revenue. Sj traffic statistics in fiscal years 1969 arid 1970, in millions, were as follows: FY 69 FY 70 Passengers 55.5 57.8 Passenger -miles 2,894.7 2,937.5 Freight short tons) 64.5 66.1 Short- ton -miles 9,560.8 10,512.8 Total Sj receipts during FY71 were equivalent to US$510.2 million, and operating expenditures of $553.7 million produced a deficit of $43.5 million. FY70 operations showed a slight profit. The Swedish railroads use '1'- section rails 33 to 66 feet in length and ranging in weight from 55 to 101 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 pounds per yard with 87 and 101 pounds per yard predominating. About 125 stiles of ran is rcncwcd each year, most of which is welded into 919 -foot sections. In 1969 there were over 1,300 miles of continuous welded rail; the longest single section seas 34 iniles long. Concrete tics now predominate over treated pine tics. Clamp -type fastenings are used with concrete tics; spring -type fasteoings, spikes, and tic plates are used with wooden tics. Ballast consists of gravel and brolwij stone. D. Highways (C) The (list rihut',oil of highways has been influenced chiefly by the rigged terrain, severe clin.,atic conditions, and popul\"tiol factors. The basic higltsway system is concentrated in the southern part of the country, where it provides access to inaior urban areas, industrial centers, agricultural areas, and rail terminals and ports. Large lake areas have influenced to sunk extent tit(' alignment of roads in the network. North of latitude. 60 rugged terrain and long, severe winters, during which travel is infeasible, account for the paucity of roads. International Itigjlway connections are nude with the adjacent countries of Norwav and Finland. The highway network totals 61,000 stiles, of which 14,500 are crushed stone, gravel, or improved earth, and the retraining 16,500 *.nil ^s are surfaced with bitumen, concrete, stone block, or cobblestone. The policy is to surface roads with bitumen, and the Ilse of cobblestone and concrete hats been redneed. Roads in tit( south arc in fair to good condition: gravel and earth roads (Figure 2) in the north are generally in pour condition. Except for sonic sections of four -lane divided highways, surface widths arc generally 18 to 26 feet. Roads are usually 20 to 24 feet wide near urban areas; rural roads play be as narrow as i0 feet. Shoulders, where they exist, normally are of earth and are ill) toy feet in Nsidlh. Roads above the Arctic Circle are narrow, but during uhc winter when they are frozen they have greater supporting capacity and arc wider because snow is plowed to the outside edge of the shoulders. About 18(/ of the total network is open to 10 -ton axle and 16 -ton tandem -axle weights. 'this is true for 81 of the national routes and 34% of the principal through routes. Axle and tandem -axle weights on 949i of the country's total network are 8 and 12 tons, respectively. About 67 of the 9,400 bridges on the highway network arc: reinforced concrete, 18% are stone- masonry, I I o are tinibcr, and 4% are of steel. The reliance on concrete is due primarily to the low maintenance rccluircincnls. Stonemasonry bridges are largely conccr;rtted in the south; timber bridges, almost all of which are on local roads in the north, are gradually being replaced with concr ^te structures. Bridges on national and provincial highways ;rc in good condition. National routes have of the bridges, and (j3cj arc oil ï¿½acts permitting 10 -loll axle and 16 -tun tandem -axle weights.

Inland waterways (C) A system of inland waterways has been maintained since the 17th century when a canal was completed between Malaren and Ilialmaren lakes in southeast ern Sweden. Today the waterways total 1,275 miles, including the navigable channels through the four main lakes: Malaren, Vanern, Vattern, and 1 lijalmaren. By 1945, road a.rd rail transport had caused the waterways to decline in importance; r -nce 1945, however, some canals have made a comeback i and again play some part in providing low -eost transportation for bulk and general cargos. Freight carried on inlar:d waterways in 1970 amounted to 7.6 million short tons, 300,000 tuns less than in 1969, and about 90% of this tonnage traveled on two canals, the \"Trollhatte Kanal and the Sodertalje Kanal. Principal cargos are ore, lumber, coal, cement, metals, arid petroleum products. The waterway system is considered adequate for n requirements. The inland waterways form two basic networks extending generally cast -west in the southern third of the country and providing access to soutbern Sweden as well as a cross peninsula route from the Baltic Sea to the Kattegat. The many rivers in the northern part of the coi!ntrv, unsuitable for navigation, are used extensively for rafting timber to sawmills on the Baltic. Development of a waterway system has been relatively easy because nearly 10% of the country's area is covered by lakes. The Dalslands Kanal, leading northwestward out of Vanern, connects with the Norwegian canal systern to provide the only international connection on the Swedish waterways. Most inland waterways are limited to craft of from 150 to 300 tons. Exceptions are the 52 -mile Trollhatte Kanal, the 180 -mile main channel of the Malaren Hjalmaren system, and the 13- rrriie Sodertalje Kanal, which can accommodate vessels of 2,200 tons, 3.000 tons, and 4,000 tons, respectively. Other principal waterways are the Gota Kanal from the Baltic Sea to Vanern, the Dalslands Kanal system in western Sweden, the Saffle Kanal system, arid the routes through the four major lakes. The Gota Kanal is the longest waterway, and the Trollhatte Kanal carries the greatest tonnage. The water -level difference on the Trollhatte Kanal between Vanern and Goteborg is 144 feet. The major impediment to navigation ;s ice, which either delays or halts traffic on ;an average of 3 or 4 months each winter. Icebreakers, norma.\"y used on the most important routes, alleviate the situation somewhat. Spring floods also occasionally interrupt the normal flow of traffic. Frequent locks and bridges on some waterways impede traffic arid increase transit times. Numerous structures of various types have been built on the waterways, including at least 23 dams, El 165) locks, and 258 bridges. Most of the lucks are more than 100 years old and cannot accommodate craft of greater than 3O0 tons capacity. Most bridges are highway structures with movable spans of the swing or bascule type. 'Twenty of the dams, built for the generation of electricity, are bypasse with land or natural channels equipped with hicks. There are at least I00 ports of varying sizes acid impo tanee along the waterways. Goteborg aril Stockholm are the largest, arid, although primarily maritime ports, they also handle an impressive amount of inland waterway traffic. Other important waterway ports are Karlstad, Vasteras, Linkoping, Sodertalje, acid Trollhattan, Each of these serves largely as a transshipment ;;,,int and bus from 3,(x)0 to 5,000 linear feet of wharfage suitable for alongside berthing of waterway craft; each has adequate handling, storage, arid clearance facilities. Sodertalje and Vasteras have important storage facilities for petroleum products. The inland w aterway fleet in 1969 numbered about '725 vessels, ranging in sire from small barges to coaster -type vessels and having a total cargo capacity of about 220,00 short tons. It is estimated that some 300 of the 725 -es,ols are for inland waterm ay use only and range in capacity from 100 to 300 tons, The fleet is generally adequate for present needs and is well maintained. More Jun half the fleet is over 30 years old. Swedish waterways are owned and operated by the national government, by municipalities, arid by private companies. The government agency respon- sible for most of the waterways, both state owned and private, is the Board of Shipping and Navigation of the Ministry of Communications. Tl_. Trollhatte arid Saffle Kan..als, both state owned, are controlled by the State Power Board of the Ministry of Finance and Economy; portions of these waterways are used for generating electricity. The Gota, Dalslands, arid Kinda Kanals are the best known of the privately owned waterways. Some new waterway construction is in progress and more is planned. Extensive improvements to the Trollhatte Kanal have begun, and the first phase of the project involves widening the Karls Grav section. Total cost is to approximate US$10 million, and work is to Lc completed by late 1974. The canal is to be navigable by 3,01W ton vessels, compared with its present 1,500-ton limitation. The Swedish Govern- ment has recently approved a program to provide for deepening the shipping channels in Malaren lake by 4.2 feet to insure a channel depth of 22.3 feet from the Sodertalje lock to Stockholm and to the important inland port of Vasteras.:;ompletion of the project will require 3 years. Characteristics of the principal w aterways are listed in Figure 4. APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 FIGURE 4.

Ports (C) Sweden has mare than 160 ports ranging in size from small landing places owned by industrial firms to some of the largest and most modern maritime facilities in the world. The seaports, most of which art- in the southern half of the country, are valuable centers for importing coal and petroleum products and are outlets for the wood products, pulp, and manufactured commodities shipped throughout the world. The ports are scattered along the shore from the northernmost part of the G ulf of Bothnia on the cast coast to the upper reaches of the Skagerrak on the west. Swedish ports on the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia are often icebound from 4 to 6 months each year. The four largest are in the southern third of the country On the w est coast are Goteborg, Malmo, and Halsingborg, and on the east coast is Stockholm (Figure 5), about 30 miles inland from the Sea. Most ports are owned by the munici in which they are located. Eac;i operates under the dire -etion of a harbor or port captain who in turn is supervised by a harbor or port authority responsible to the city council. Goteborg, M,!mo, and Stockholm have free ports, which are municipally owned but are operated by a separate company affiliated with the municipal governmen'. A few ports such as Limhamn, Lulea, and Oxelosund are pri aiely owned and operated by large industrial firms. Sweden has 17 major and about 150 r&ior ports. The largest portsï¿½ Goteborg, Stockholm, Malmo, and Halsingborg ï¿½are well maintained and well equipped with modern, efficient handling facilities (including roll on, roll off capabilities) and are completely adequate for normal requirements. The remaining major ports are also well equipped for cargo transfer and are adequate for all normal requirements. The ports continue to expand at a significant pace, with present port development concentrated on thr larger ports. At Halsingborg an additional area of over 6 acres and having a quay length of 985 feet is to be developed near the Ocean Basin. Plans are heing formulated at Malmo for further land reclamation for the development of industrial sites and additional berthing facilities. Goteborg's second largest harbor project, Alvsborg, is under construction at a site immediately to the west of the Skandia Harbor. 1'hc area is scheduled for completion in 1975. Long -range plans exist for tb development of a new and larger petroleum facility about 3 miles west of the present Torshamn site. Details of major ports are tabulated in Figure 6. 12 G. Merchant marine (C) The Swedish merchant fleet is one of the most modern, efficient, and well maintained of the traditional maritime nations and serves major trade routes throughout the world. About 804E of the fleet's tonnage is employed either exclusively or primarily in trade between foreign countrie The considerable amount of net earnings in foreign exchange derived from this trade, which was equivalent to t1S8368 million in 1970, makes in important contribution to Sweden's balance of payments. During the last few years the fleet has c,rried no more than 30% of the country's total volun)e of international seaborne e xports. Because of tine importance to the economy of the tramp operations, there is little interest by the government and shipowners in carrying a larger portion of Sweden's international trade. In February 1972 the fleet consisted of 352 ships of l,(K)0 gross register tons (g.r.t.) and over, totaling 4.641,218 g.r.t. and 7,138,988 deadweight tons (d.w.t.), as fellows: TYPE Ntrrtrr G.R.T.

Eleven domestic and one foreign owner, each having more than 100,000 d.w.t., together control about 859i of the total fleet deadweight tonnage (23u ships). The larger of these owners are as follows: OWNER SHIPS D.W.T. Axel Brostrom Son, Goteborg 63 1,382,546 Satenrederierna, Stockholm 43 1,282,170 Granges A /B, Stockholm 19 71.5,680 Malmros Rederi A /B, Trelleborg 9 584,440 Axel Axelson Johnson, Stockholm 32 496,695 M. Bergman, Kungsbacka 4 401,500 Total 170 4,863,021 The only foreign owner is Stove Shipping, Oslo, which controls eight ships aggregating 162,300 d.w.t. A few owners control many ships, but most of the shipowners have from one to three ships. In order to compete more effectively with \"flag -of- convenience\" fleets and those of other traditional maritime nations, Swedish shipowners have concen- trated on structural and technical modernization of their fleets. Rapid changes in structure have been nec- 6 tated by the demands of shippers arid by technical innovations for adaptation to international shipping standards. In addition to fleet moderni- zation, some shipowners have been engaged in reor- ganizing their shipping enterprises, either through merging one or more Swedish shipping companies or entering into cooperative agreements with foreign -flag shipping interests for more productive operations. Since 1967, Swedish shipowners have concentrated on selling and scrapping a large amount of noncompetitive tonnage and replacing it with more efficient used or new units and have added to their fleets highly specialized units especially designed for employment on new trade routes. Most of the fleet is engaged in liner (scheduled) service and has experienced continuous increases in operating costs. During 1970, shipowners' costs were estimated to have risen by 30 largely the result of increased wages, cargo handling, and bunkering (fuel). In an effort to offset one of the highest crew wage rates among the world's merchant fleets, Swedish owners have concentrated on redacing workload and replacing manpower aboard ship by automation and technical improvements, as well as disposing of less productive ships requiring large crews. In October 1971, Swedish shipowners had on order for delivery through 1975 a total of 86 new ships aggregating about 4,859,300 d.w.t. About 93% of this tonnage comprised 25 tankers, including seven units each of more than 230,000 d.w.t.; 10 tanker /ore and tanker /ore /hulk carriers ranging between 100,000 and 270,000 d.w.t.; and 12 bulk -cargo ships between 2.;,400 and 115,000 d.w.t. About 67% of the total deadweight tonnage on order was placed in domestic shipyards and the remainder in shipyards in East Germany, Finland, France, the Netherhinds, Norway, Spain, the Soviet Union, West Germany, and Yugoslavia. In addition to ships of 1,000 g.r.t. and over, there are several hujidred smaller merchant ships employed in coastal operations and in trade with neighboring countries bordering the Baltic Sea. Included in this trade are about 70 tankers ranging bet%%ecn 100 and 999 g.r.t., totaling about 26,000 g.r.t., and an undetermined number of dry cargo, passenger, and ferry units. Included in Sweden's ferry fleet are 31 car /passenger ferries of 1,000 g.r.t. and over, totaling about 92,000 g.r.t., which are emploved between Swedish ports and between Swedish and other northern European ports. The oceangoing fishing fleet consists of about 100 vessels between 100 and 499 g.r.t., totaling 16,500 g.r.t. Merchant- marine functions are administered by the Ministry of Communications through the Department of Shipping and Board of Shipping. Sweden is it member of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) and is party to the following IMCO conventions: Safety of Life at Sea, 1948 arid 1960: Prevention of Collisions at Sea, 1960; Oil Pollution, 1954 and 1962; Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965; and Load Lines, 1966. The basic philosophy underlying the nation's maritime policy is one of freedom of competition on the seas. However, Swedish shipowners engaged in trade between foreign countries are faced with in ,-rearing hardships caused by flag- discrimination practices of foreign governments. As a measure to counter such discrimination against Swedish ships, the government prohibits Swedish shipping interests from the chartering of or transport by ships registered in the discriminating countries. Except for this prohibition, the government police toward merchant shipping is nonrestrictive and nondiscriminatory: there is no significant intervention in operations of the shipping industry. In keeping with the government's policy of noninterference and the shipowners' preference for free enterprise, no direct subsidization is provided for fleet development or operations in international trade. Indirect assistance to shipowners is primarily in the form of tax benefits. Shipowners are not taxed on earnings derived from the sale of ships providing such earnings are used for acquiring new ships, owners are 19 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 also permitted to transfer profits to a tax -free fund for equalizing market fluctuations in the business evele. Another form of assistance to shipowners is the provision of state- guarantee.: loans for new -ship i construction. In mid -1970, about 16,000 ,eafa ring personnel were employed aboard Swedish -r erchant ships of 300 g.r.t. and over, including 6,000 foreign nationals. For many years the demand for workers ashore in highly industrialized Sweden has made it difficult to recruit native seafaring personnel. The large number of aliens employed on Swedish ships is attributed not only to the shortage of Swedish personnel but to superior wage ra tes. Government- sponsored merchant marine schools provide training for officer cadets who must complete a period of practical shipboard experience prior to completing a variety of excellent courses. Swedish seamen are not required to have previous training and experience for unskilled jobs but are trained aboard ship. Swedish shipowners generally believe that quality rather than quantity is more important to manning their ships and thus are placing more emphasis on individual specialized and theoretical training to increase a seaman's competence for more qualified work. Because of negotiation rather than imposition of law, there is an excellent relationship between shipowners and the Swedish maritime unions. Much shipowner success in reducing the number of employees is attributable to the understanding attitude and support of the maritime unions and organizations. Crew reduction has been accomplished primarily by introducing very specialized shore training, by improved planning and organization of work aboard ship, and by considerable changes made in manning structure. H. Civil air (C) Sweden's domestic civil aviation policies ï¿½arc designed to promote a balanced expansion of its internal air services in order to accommodate the growth in demand generated by the nation's expanding economy. These internal air links are especially significant to the northern areas where surface transportation is adversely affected by winter conditions. Because of its membership in the Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) consortium with Denmark and Norway, Sweden pursues international aviation policies that are close!y integrated with these two nations. These policies are aimed toward expanding SAS' worldwide services while insuring that the company remains the dominant carrier within Scandinavia. 20 As a result of the success of these policies, Sweden has excellent domestic and international scheduled passenger service Two Swedish airlines serve 23 domestic points; daily high frequency service links the major population centers. SAS is the larger of the scheduled airlines and is the only one providing both domestic and international services. The Swedish participant in the SAS consortium is Aktiebolagel Aerotransport, a nori- operating holding company owned ?ointl by the government and private interests. SAS set es 26 cities in Scandinavia, including seven in Sweden, and flies scheduled services worldwide to 90 cities in 46 countries. SAS operates through the U.S.S.R. from Stockholm via Moscow and Tash!:ent to the Far East. Flight operations are conducted with a fleet of 74 aircraft composed of two Boeing 747B's, six Douglas DC- 8 -63's, five Doughis DC-8 -62's, three Douglas DC- 8- 62F's, 24 Douglas DC- 9 -40's, two Douglas DC- 9- 30F's, 10 Douglas DC- 9 -20's, 13 Aerospatiale Caravelles, and nine Convair 440/340*s. 'Thirty of there aircraft are registered in Sweden; the remaining are registered in Denmark and Norwav in accordance with the SAS consortium agreement. The SAS system employs about 14,300, in three countries, including 1,160 pilots, 80 navigators, and 3,700 maintenance and overhaul personnel. SAS owns 30% of Thai International, Thailand's international flag carrier, and has a 251 interest in Gronlandsfly A/S (Greenlandair), which provides domestic service within Greenland and performs coastal ice patrols, With its subsidiary, Scanair, SAS has entered the growin vacation charter market, and with another subsidiary, Linjeflug AB (LIN), SAS controls the Swedish domestic airline market. LIN serves 22 towns and cities in Sweden with a fleet of four Aerospatiale N -262's and 16 Comvaii CV 440/340's. The general aviation sector of the Swedish civil aviation establishment is comprised of a large number of charter cargo and passenger and airwork companies. It is the fastest growing component of aviation because of the popularity of private flying and the necessity for developing specialized aviation enterprises to support the expansion of the domestic economy. For example, about 400 to 500 students per year are trained and receive private licenses, and the number of civil aircraft registered in Sweden is just under 1,000. Sweden has 19 operating charter companies; the largest of these are Scanair and Sterling Airways. Five large airwork companies perform various tasks such as aerial ambulance and mapping operations. Finally, some 130 gliding and flying clubs are active throughout the country. APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 The following 72 civil aircraft of at least 20,00 pounds gross weight are registered in Sweden: 4 Aerospatiale N -262 1 Douglas DC -8-55 4 Aerospatiale Caravelle III 2 Douglas DC -8 -62 5 BAC Viscount 700D 1 Douglas DC -8 -62F 1 Boeing 747B 3 Douglas DC -8 -63 2 Boeing 727 -100 10 Douglas DC -9 -40 I Boeing 'r27 -100C 1 Douglas DC -9 -30F 23 Convair 44 0/340......... 4 Douglas DC -9 -20 1 Dassault Falcon 20 I Douglas DC -3 2 Douglas DC -6B 3 Lockheed L -188 Electra, Three S%vedish- registered DC -8 -30 aircraft are leased to Thai International. Most Swedish transport pilots receive their initial flight training during their military service. The most complete training facility is SAS's flight simulator equipped base at Stockholm where the airline conducts aircraft conversion training, transport- rating courses, and routine training to maintain flight crew proficiency. In addition, 12 specialized flight schools offer training for helicopter licenses and flight engineer and airline transport ratings. Regular primary flight training courses are also offered. The nation's most complete maintenance facilities are those of SAS at Stockholm. Airframe and engine overhauls for all versions of the DC -8 aircraft used by SAS are accomplished here. SAS maintenance centers in Norway and Denmark handle DC -9 and Caravelle repair work. Twenty other civil aircraft maintenance organizations carry out various types of aircraft, powerplant, and aircraft component overhaul. The largest of these are FFV Forende Fabdksverken, AB Svenska Flygverkstaderna, aid Ostermans Aero AB. The Swedish Board of Civil Aviation administers Sweden's civil aviation affairs. Sweden is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization ï¿½ICAO and is a party to the major multilateral conventions and agreements governing international air transpor- tation. The government has entered into air transport agreements or arrangements with some 90 other countries. SAS is a member of the International Air Transport Associationï¿½ IATA aril has operating agreements with Swissair and KLM covering maintenance and training arrangements for its Boeing 74713's and newly ordered Douglas DC -10's. I. Airfields' (C) The air facilities system of Sweden (including the island of Gotland) consists of 16 usable airfields, 27 sites, and nine seaplane stations. Of the usable airfields, 29 are primarily military but open to civil 'For detailed information on individual air facilities in Sweden see Volume 12, Airfields and Seaplane Stations of the World, published by the Aeronautical Chart and Information Center for the Defense Intelligence Agency. 1 traffic. One airfield is used jointly. All of the major civil airfields and most of the permanent Royal S%vedish Air Force Lases are located in the south, primarily in the Stockholm area and the central lowlands to the west and southwest. The remaining airfields are widely- dispersed, and only a few permanent military bases are located in the sparsely populated northern regions. Sweden's airfields and navigational and landing aids comprise an efficient and well- integrated system entirely adequate to support domestic and interna- tional air traffic. Arlanda, the principal international airfield, is capable of handling the heaviest aircraft in use. Arlanda and Bromma have extensive logistic support capability, all types of cargo- handling equipment, and extensive parking facilities. Bromma, originally developed as the main international traffic terminal, is used primarily for domestic flights and as an alternate airfield for Arlanda. Excellent maintenance facilities are available, and the airfield is capable of supporting two squadrons of B -57 aircraft. 7'he runways at the remaining international airfields of Torslanda, Visbv, and Sundsvall /flarnosand are constructed to withstand sustained operations of aircraft, and Bulltofta can support C -124 aircraft. The airfields of Kungsangen, Skelleftea, Umea, Karlstad, Ornskoldsvik, Kiruna, Jonkoping, and Sandviken are capable of handling aircraft up to and including the C -130. I Iultsfred and Gunnarn are good operational airfields. Halmstad has an excellent weight- bearing ca,mcity. A new international airfield, under construction at Sturup, about 12 miles east southeast of Malmo, is to be the second largest airfield in Sweden and is to replace Bulltofta as Malmo's international airfield. Eighty -six airfields have hard surfaced runways, most in good condition. About 7 'i, have the weight bearing capacity to accommodate light -cargo and troop carrier aircraft; nearl all have taxiways and most have aprons. About 25% to 30% have airline operations. Many of the 76 natural- surface airfields are used by aeroclubs; others are maintained a. emergency landing grounds or auxiliary fields for the air force. The 27 sites are unusable in their present condition. Only oncr of the nine seaplane stations is active. Sweden intends to equip and maintain airports of entry to meet future demands of international traffic. A modernization program begun in 1950 to meet the increasing demands of high -speed aircraft is continuing. At this time budgetary limitations make prospects for major expansion remote. The military airfield system seems adequate to handle needs into the 1980'x. Figure 7 lists characteristics of the most important airfields. 21 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2009/06/16: CIA- RDP01- 00707R000200090023 -1 FIGURE 7.
