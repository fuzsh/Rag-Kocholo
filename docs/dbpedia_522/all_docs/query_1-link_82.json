        "text": "Performing arts\n\nDance\n\nDance allows us to communicate beyond words ... be touched in depth. It's an awesome feeling! And you don't need to travel to either New York, Sydney, or Paris to experience world-class dancing. Just go to Lokstallarna in Karlshamn, the regional theater´s dance scene in Blekinge.\n\nBrådjupa Dansfestival\n\nBlekinge's dance festival Brådjupa is a yearly event, which is a collaboration between Dans i Blekinge and Region Teatern. During 5 days, there are dancing and dancers all over the place in Lokstallarna in Karlshamn. The program includes workshops, artist talks, dance classes, and of course, performances and guest appearances.\n\nTheater\n\nTreat yourself to a theater experience when you get the chance. There´s something quite special about the directness of it; sharing the actor's interpretation of the story. You feel it, no matter if it´s a play that makes you laugh, get mad, or sad. In the summer season, there are several opportunities to watch outdoor theater in Blekinge.\n\nRegionteatern Blekinge & Kronoberg\n\nKronoberg county and Blekinge county run the regional theatre activities together. They were merged to gain more power and are today a cultural hub in southern Sweden, with a special focus on performing arts for children and young people.\n\nTeatersmedjan\n\nThis theater association has produced hundreds of performances over the past 30 years and their summer theater on the island of Kastellet in Karlshamn's inlet is a popular tradition. The Teatersmedjan also arranges theater courses and workshops for both children and adults.\n\nRonneby Folkteater\n\nThe focus point of Folkteatern in Ronneby is the joy of performing – and getting people to laugh. The theater is one of the few Art Nouveau theaters that still remains in Sweden, inaugurated in 1911, but the shows also go on tour and are played on small and large stages around the region.\n\nSandelius Kultur & Nöje\n\nElin & Mats Sandelius aim to create theatre experiences for all ages where adults and children should have as much retention of the show. Since 2007, they have put on many of Astrid Lindgren's stories at Skottsbergska gården in Karlshamn during summer.\n\nCurious? Scroll through the upcoming theatre shows and dance performances.
