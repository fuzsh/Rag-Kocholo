        "text": "Money is available to deal with #PFAS in public water systems as a result of two cases. Any public water system that serves more than 25 people and has detected PFAS in any of its water sources, as well as systems that have not yet detected PFAS but must test for contamination, are included in the proposed settlement class. The agreement with 3M is pending approval by the governing federal court, while the agreement with DuPont was provisionally approved on August 22, 2023. The settlement funds would be used for testing, decontamination and the construction of filtration systems. https://lnkd.in/eXgM3nBz Class Action settlements designed to resolve claims for PFAS contamination in Public Water Systems‚Äô Drinking Water, as those terms are defined in the respective agreements, which are with two groups of Settling Defendants on behalf of: (1) the 3M Company (‚Äú3M‚Äù); and (2) E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company (n/k/a EIDP, Inc.), DuPont de Nemours Inc., The Chemours Company, The Chemours Company FC, LLC, and Corteva, Inc. (collectively, ‚ÄúDuPont‚Äù). Both of these settlements are designed to resolve claims for PFAS contamination in Public Water Systems‚Äô Drinking Water, as those terms are defined in the respective agreements. Both of the proposed settlements are still subject to approval by the MDL Judge, the Honorable Richard M. Gergel of the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina.\n\nLast week the US EPA unveiled new, stringent PFAS regulations, with initial enforcement set to begin in 2027. Black & Veatch is here to assist utilities and others impacted by the new rules to achieve compliance in tailored, economic, and robust ways. Please feel free to reach out to me, or any of our PFAS experts in the below flyer, if you're interested in working together to address PFAS and produce safe, EPA-compliant drinking water.\n\nVarious Attorneys General have negotiated changes to the 3M proposed $10.3 billion settlement with the nation's water systems. Those changes are reflected in a proposed consent order filed in the MDL - U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina. Those changes are listed as follows: 1. \"The uncapped indemnity in favor of 3M, which could have left water systems liable for damages well beyond their expected recovery from the settlement, is removed in its entirety, significantly increasing the value of the settlement to participating water systems; 2. The deadline for eligible water systems to review the settlement and determine whether to opt-out is extended to 90 days; 3. The establishment of a settlement-specific website with information that will allow water systems to derive a good-faith estimate of what they may receive under the 3M settlement agreement if they participate in it (although actual settlement awards will depend on data that is not yet available); and 4. Claims by states and the federal government are expressly carved out of the agreement, allowing for future action and additional settlements against 3M.\" https://lnkd.in/gmk4dnPH\n\nMany of the objectors said the settlement terms were too broad and could inappropriately release the companies from too much future potential liability over PFAS pollution ‚Äî including for remediation of soil or wastewater contamination and from some personal injury claims. Paul Napoli, an attorney with the law firm Napoli Shkolnik who negotiated the settlements on behalf of U.S. water providers, said in an email on Monday that he and other plaintiffs' attorneys take objections with \"utmost seriousness.\" He said many of the concerns have already been resolved or were raised by parties not members of the proposed class action settlements.

We are the only chemical free system approved for both #military and #commercial #hangar applications, eliminating the need for foam #fireprotection.\n\nFederal court okays the 3M Co.'s multibillion dollar settlement with water utilities. The settlement resolves 3M's battles with most water utilities regarding sources of drinking water that have been contaminated with a fire suppressant made for decades with certain PFAS the company produced. But, 3M faces more legal battles continue on the personal injury and other fronts. Meanwhile water utilities--which face imminent national drinking water limits for some PFAS--already are pursing additional funds from companies that made the specialized fire suprressant, aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), with other types of PFAS."
