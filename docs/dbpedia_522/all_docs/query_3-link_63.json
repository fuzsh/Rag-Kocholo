        "text": "It is a picture-perfect lake, a little piece of Scandinavian paradise in all its charm. The water is clear, there are rare species of birds, and here and there islets bristle with vigorous conifers. For decades, however, Lake Tyrifjorden in Norway has been brewing a disastrous potion of invisible, harmful and probably irreversible pollution. The chemical ingredients that contaminate its waters belong to a family of ultra-toxic substances with names so complex that acronyms have replaced them: per- and polyfluoroalkyl compounds, or PFAS.\n\nSince the late 1940s, these chemicals with unique properties have been used to mass-produce the non-stick, stain-resistant and waterproofing treatments that coat our everyday utensils and textiles, and much more. Teflon, Scotchgard (the popular textile waterproofing agent) and Gore-Tex are made using them. Myriads of objects contain them: carpets, guitar strings, electric vehicle batteries, paints, acne treatments, kebab and fry wrappers, electrical circuit sheathing in airplanes, hip prostheses, and dental floss.\n\nHarmful to health, PFAS could be composed of several thousands or even several million compounds – no one knows. What they have in common is an indestructible chain of carbon and fluorine atoms brought to the world by 20th-century chemistry, which are the source of both PFAS' properties but also their persistence in the environment. They are indestructible in nature, and able to travel very long distances, far from the area where they were emitted. They have been dubbed \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nForever Pollution Project: An investigation into PFAS contamination across Europe\n\nFor several months, Le Monde and its partners in the Forever Pollution Project have gathered thousands of data points to build a \"map of forever pollution\" that shows – for the first time – the extent to which Europe has been contaminated by per- and polyfluoroalkylated substances (PFAS), compounds that are both toxic and persistent in the environment.\n\nThis collaborative investigation was initiated by Le Monde (France); NDR, WDR and Süddeutsche Zeitung (Germany); RADAR Magazine and Le Scienze (Italy); and The Investigative Desk and NRC (Netherlands); with the financial support of Journalismfund.eu and Investigative Journalism for Europe (IJ4EU); further investigated and published by Knack (Belgium), Denik Referendum (Czechia), Politiken (Denmark), YLE (Finland), Reporters United (Greece), Latvian Radio (Latvia), Datadista (Spain), SRF (Switzerland), Watershed Investigations / The Guardian (UK); and supported by Arena for Journalism in Europe for cross-border collaboration.\n\nMapping the forever pollution\n\nFor nearly a year, Le Monde worked with journalists from 17 media partners to try to measure the extent of this contamination in Europe. According to our conservative estimate, based on thousands of environmental samples, there are nearly 23,000 sites in Europe contaminated at levels that require the attention of public authorities (above 10 nanograms per liter). The experts we interviewed estimated that in more than 2,300 \"hotspots,\" the contamination reaches levels considered hazardous to health (more than 100 nanograms per liter).\n\nSome of these are in the vicinity of the 20 PFAS production plants that we were able to locate – the list and mapping of these industrial sites had never been established.\n\nOur investigation reveals the locations of nearly 21,500 sites suspected of being contaminated by past or present industrial activity across Europe, as well as more than 230 factories identified as PFAS users. In an unprecedented experiment of peer-reviewed journalism, the Forever Pollution Project draws on the methodologies of leading experts to publish, for the first time in Europe, an interactive map of PFAS contamination across the continent. The project's objective is to provide a tool of public interest – something that was unavailable to date – to communities affected or likely to be affected by this pollution, to researchers, to civil society and to public authorities.\n\nFrom the beautiful Blue Danube to Lake Orestiada (Greece), from the Bilina River (Czech Republic) to the Guadalquivir Basin (Spain), PFAS are detected in water, air, and rain; otters and codfish; boiled eggs and teenagers. Collected by scientific teams and environmental agencies, the tens of thousands of data points we have assembled show that few places are now spared by this ubiquitous contamination that is still largely unknown to the public – not even the most intimate places, like our bodies.Biomonitoring studies show that these unwanted components permeate our blood.\n\nPFAS gained notoriety with Todd Haynes's 2019 film Dark Waters, in which Mark Ruffalo plays American lawyer Rob Bilott. The real Rob Bilott discovered the first evidence of this environmental crime in the vicinity of the plant where the DuPont chemical group manufactured its Teflon, in Parkersburg, West Virginia. This was in 1998. But while the United States has come to grips with the extent of PFAS contamination in the years since, the scandal has not crossed the Atlantic.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to us, the poison of the century has also contaminated all of Europe.\n\nTwelve plants, eight question marks\n\nSo how do we evaluate the severity of the problem on our continent? In 2019, the Nordic Council of Ministers (an intergovernmental organization comprising Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) commissioned a report – which has become a major reference point – from Gretta Goldenman, an expert on PFAS. Despite a year of work and an impressive compilation of data, one figure never ceased to elude this environmental lawyer's team: How many chemical plants manufacture PFAS in Europe? How many Teflon or Scotchgard plants? How many polluters like DuPont? \"It's about time that finally comes out into the public eye, especially for the people who are living next to these plants,\" Goldenman said. \"They are the frontline communities.\"\n\nAs more knowledge is gained, the effects, even at low doses, of exposure to PFAS grow like a nightmare medical checkup that spares no area of the body. These include the decreased birth weight of babies; decreased fertility or immune response to vaccines in children; increased risk of breast, kidney or testicular cancers; thyroid disease; ulcerative colitis; increased cholesterol and blood pressure; and preeclampsia in pregnant women ; cardiovascular effects. Goldenman's team estimated that the burden of PFAS on European healthcare systems amounts to between €52 and €84 billion each year.\n\nEurope's best-known \"hotspots\" of massive pollution all have PFAS production facilities at their epicenter. In Trissino, Italy, the Miteni company synthesized and emitted a range of PFAS for half a century. Discovered in 2013, the contamination of drinking water and soil extends over 200 square kilometers and is believed to affect up to 350,000 people in the Veneto region.\n\nThis industrial pollution contains various \"long-chain\" PFAS because of their chain of more than eight carbon atoms (called \"C8\"), in particular perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Banned by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Products in 2009 and 2019 respectively, they have been replaced by \"short-chain\" PFAS, which pose the same problems. This is a typical case of \"regrettable substitution\" that always keeps manufacturers one step ahead of the regulations.\n\nPartner service\n\nLearn French with Gymglish\n\nThanks to a daily lesson, an original story and a personalized correction, in 15 minutes per day.\n\nTry for free\n\nTwelve plants were eventually named in the report led by Goldenman. But a footnote stated that \"it is assumed that there are between 12 and 20 sites.\" Where are the other eight? We set out on the trail of the forever polluters, a much more difficult task than we thought. But not impossible.\n\nThe forever polluters\n\nIn order to locate the sites with certainty, we immersed ourselves into a sort of binge-watching of industrial capitalism, spending entire weeks on Google Maps scrutinizing the landscapes by satellite view, zooming in on the pale patches of the industrial zones, wandering from riverbanks taken over by interlacing smoldering piping to forests with holes of discolored, lifeless crusts. In 3D, we surveyed this ugly Europe of chemical parks sometimes so vast that they are served by several bus stops, like Burghausen in Germany, which covers an area equivalent to more than 280 football fields.\n\nThe industrial fluorination process is complex and costly and requires specific know-how and facilities. It is mostly large companies that are involved and sell their production to thousands of downstream users. Germany, the cradle of industrial chemistry, has no fewer than six plants, including three at the Gendorf site in Bavaria, where Archroma, 3M Dyneon and W. L. Gore, creator of the famous Gore-Tex, are located. Second on the list, France has five sites: the Arkema and Daikin plants in the chemical valley at Pierre-Bénite (eastern France); Chemours, a spinout company from DuPont created in 2015 to cut DuPont from any PFAS activities, in Villers-Saint-Paul (northern France); and the Solvay facilities in Tavaux (eastern France) and Salindres (southern France). This is followed by three sites in the United Kingdom, two in Italy and one each in Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nAs in Parkersburg, West Virginia, Chemours is causing severe pollution around its Dordrecht plant, and the Netherlands has been in a crisis situation since 2015. Air, soil and water there are chock-full of PFOA and GenX, a short-chain substitute that has spread to vegetable gardens more than a kilometer away. As for 3M, which supplied DuPont with the PFOA needed to make its Teflon, the firm has so polluted the area around its Zwijndrecht plant (near Antwerp, Belgium) and beyond, that the area is thought to be one of the most PFAS-contaminated in the world.\n\nTo our knowledge, no sampling campaign has been conducted in the vicinity of more than half of the 20 production facilities we have identified to measure the extent of possible contamination. Or the results are not public. While three of these plants are now inactive, their pollution is probably there forever.\n\nAnthropocene hotspots\n\nWho polluted Lake Tyrifjorden? Every PFAS assemblage contains, in its chemical structure, traces of the industrial activity or use that disseminated it into nature. This is how detectives of the \"Contamination of the Earth\" – often environmental chemistry researchers in boots – were able to identify a paper mill 15 kilometers upstream.\n\nHow many sites have high contamination in Europe? What are the consequences for the communities that suffer from it? Can we identify the sources of this pollution and, if not stop it, at least halt the emissions released into the environment? No official census of the most contaminated places exists at the European level, and only a few countries have worked to map this invisible pollution. No data, no information. The absence of points in many countries on our map reflects only the lack of measurements.\n\nThirty or so locations are now labeled \"hotspots\" by authorities or scientists. The first of these are in the vicinity of production plants, where PFAS concentrations can reach record levels. Then come about 20 sites, most of them discovered by chance. The pollution at most of these sites comes from the use of AFFF firefighting foam, the banning of which was proposed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in February 2022. Used to extinguish hydrocarbon fires, against which water is ineffective, these foams form a mat that deprives the fire of oxygen. After use, the PFAS they contain seep into the soil, percolate to the groundwater and can then be delivered to taps through water distribution systems.\n\nAirports and military bases are major consumers. So these hotspots include the areas around the civilian airports of Düsseldorf and Nuremberg (Germany), Schiphol (Netherlands) and Jersey (Channel Islands), as well as several military air bases in Sweden. The drinking water of Ronneby (Sweden), a town of 28,000 inhabitants, was contaminated by the use of foam during firefighting exercises on an army base located 2 kilometers away. Since the pollution was discovered, the residents have been the subject of several studies monitoring their health, unwilling guinea pigs in a life-size experiment.\n\nIn the vicinity of Rastatt, Germany, tons of PFAS-soaked compost from a paper mill were spread across fields as fertilizer. Nearly 900 hectares were contaminated. The area has been under high surveillance since 2013 and is of great concern. The underground plume of pollution is slowly flowing toward the Rhine and will soon reach it.\n\nThe ups and downs\n\n\"We've made the planet rather inhospitable to us,\" said Ian Cousins, a professor of environmental chemistry at Stockholm University in Sweden and an expert on PFAS. \"We're at the point where the different environments and resources are contaminated and they will be for a long time. And in many cases, the levels are above what we consider to be safe levels. We are no longer in a safe operating space anymore.\"\n\nPFAS are a \"planetary boundary\" (\"planetary limit\") on par with climate change or the ozone hole, Cousins and colleagues argue. In a scientific paper published in August 2022 in Environmental Science & Technology, they exposed that rain everywhere in the world contains concentrations of PFOA above the US health advisories.\n\nBut between the 0.055 nanograms per liter (ng/l) found in the rain in Tibet, where no factory produces or uses PFAS, and the 68,900,000 ng/l detected in the groundwater near the 3M factory in Zwijndrecht, where exactly is the line between low and high? What is a safe value? Many experts suggest a maximum limit of one tiny nanogram per liter. Yet in the US, 200 million Americans, nearly two-thirds of the population, consume water that contains more. And in Europe?\n\nPresumption of contamination\n\nAs alarming as it is, our investigation probably underestimates the reality of the European situation. For in addition to the PFAS-producing facilities and the thousands of contaminated sites, our investigation managed to locate nearly 21,500 presumptive contamination sites. This is a complex task that no agency and no scientific team in Europe had, until now, undertaken in a systematic way.\n\nTo do this, we adapted the methodology developed by a team of researchers from the PFAS Project Lab in Boston with their colleagues from the \"PFAS Sites and Community Resources Map\" to map pollution in the US. The main difficulty was the lack of databases containing the geolocation of industrial activities in Europe as well as the lack of transparency by the authorities. Nevertheless, we managed to locate thousands of sites in three types of \"presumptive contaminating\" activities. First, sites where firefighting foams were stored and used. Second, waste treatment and wastewater treatment sites. Finally, industrial activities spread over nearly 3,000 factories, including more than 1,000 paper mills, and metal manufacturing and processing plants (about 800 sites).\n\nIn the US, Chemours is the target of the vast majority of the 6,400 PFAS lawsuits filed since 2005. Liabilities could reach $30 billion for 3M,according to an analysis by Bloomberg Law.\n\nGretta Goldenman readily admits that her report's figure of €170 billion for compensating environmental damage across Europe is a significant underestimate. Wherever the damage from PFAS pollution has to be repaid, the amounts are indeed staggering. For Martin Scheringer, a researcher in environmental chemistry at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, \"the dimensions of this problem are so enormous that it's just impossible to quantify.\"\n\nManaging the contamination of water drunk by 1.2 million people around Düsseldorf airport cost €100 million. Filtering water in Italy's Veneto province cost over €16 million. While harmful contamination is measured in nanograms, the PFAS extracted from Norwegian soil is weighed in kilograms at some 40 airports. The cleanup of civil and military airports across Europe would cost €18 billion.\n\nIn the US, the cost of eliminating PFAS from drinking water could run up to $400 billion (€370 billion). While in Brussels, the European Federation of National Associations of Water Services (EurEau) prefers not to venture into the territory of figures, it does estimate that the cost of water could increase by an additional €0.28 and €0.36 per cubic meter. \"This industry is very profitable, and that's because they have been able to get away with not incorporating the cost of preventing pollution from leaving their borders for way too long,\" said Goldenman. \"The polluter really needs to pay here.\"\n\nState-facilitated corporate crime\n\n\"Who is responsible is a very difficult question,\" said Cousins. Like oil companies with climate change, \"the chemical industry obviously knew a lot about PFAS problems a long, long time ago.\" Since 1961 to be exact, when DuPont and 3M became aware of the toxicity of PFOA, as proven by the internal documents later made public after trials in the United States. On the government side, decision-makers have been aware of the danger since at least 2006, when the US authorities required a phase-out of PFOA.\n\n\"So, is it the chemical industry that's responsible or is the state being too weak and not demanding more of the chemical industry?\" asked Cousins. No one to date has ever been put in jail for committing this landmark, ubiquitous and surely eternal contamination. But can it really be called a crime?\n\nLieselot Bisschop, a professor of law at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, is specifically interested in the concept of state-facilitated corporate crime \"to understand corporate environmental and human harm\" in the context of PFAS pollution. The term refers \"to situations where government institutions fail to regulate illegal or socially harmful business activities, or when they create a legal environment that allows these harms to occur and/or continue,\" Bisschop explained. These activities are often \"awful but lawful.\"\n\nWhile the researcher has yet to deliver her academic verdict, Scheringer readily embraces the notion. \"For a long time, the authorities have not seen this as a crime but as a factor of development and a source of wealth in their countries,\" he said. \"In a way, all the state actors have made huge mistakes over the last 50 or 60 years, and these mistakes have turned into crimes.\""
