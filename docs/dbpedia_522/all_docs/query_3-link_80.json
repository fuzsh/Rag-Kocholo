        "text": "One of the most visible features of recent discussions about democratic reforms is attached to the potentials of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). We are not living only in the age of globalisation, but also in the age of \"informatisation\" or information society development, which is closely intertwined with globalisation of the world economy and other contextual trends. This has brought new ideas to the agenda for democratic reform: increased use of ICTs in democratic processes is expected to increase transparency and pluralism, and thus to contribute to the overall democratisation of societies. Moreover, there are more direct changes new practices of electronic democracy or e-democracy may bring about, if incorporated into the democratic system. In general, ICTs provide a set of technological tools, which may help to maintain the functionality of the democratic system in a globalised world.\n\nThe convergence of mobile media, wireless networks, digital data visualizations and social web applications have led to a radical change in our experiences of turban settings. Today, more than ever, the city of the future is evolving at the interface of mobile media practices, digital infrastructures and web-based networks. The formation of digital infrastructures and networks thus creates a key foundation for the sustainable development of the informational city. Cities investing in the development of digital infrastructures and services can expect an exhaustive reshaping of their political and administrative actions consistent with open government, and an improved regulation of the cooperation and codetermination among social institutions, companies and citizens. In terms of urban planning, these expectations of the informational city can be understood as an indicator of an extensive reorientation of urban ways of life. Against this background, the following questions are central to this study: what significance does the development of the informational city have in forming new kinds of social and cultural interaction in a digital society? To what extent can the digitalization of the urban be understood as a societal gauge? In response to these questions, I would like to closely examine the infrastructures of media technology, and its potential applications, to map out its effects on all actors involved.\n\nThis study examines the potential for the Internet, or more specifically the World Wide Web, to enhance local democracy and local governance by providing a networked public sphere. It is located in post-industrial theories of social and political transformation, which see a new, uncertain and complex society emerging which may transform the political significance of the ?local?. Whilst a number of causes are identified as culpable in this process, it is the ICT revolution and the development of the Web in particular, that is seen as possessing a democratising potential that, if realised, may bring greater resilience to geographic localities. The potential of the Web to provide a new networked public sphere is based upon contested views that its topography, its hyperlinked structure, can enable the ordinary citizen?s voice to be heard above those that traditionally dominate political discourse. However, there has been no attention paid to this potential being realised at a local gove..."
