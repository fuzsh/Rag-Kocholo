These chapters Country Profile, The Society, Government and Politics, The Economy, Military Geog- raphy, Transportation and Telecommunications, Armed Forces, Science, and Intelligence one Security, provide the primary NIS coverage. Som,4 chapters, particularly Science and Intelligences and Security, that are not pertinent to all countries, are produced selectively. For small countries requiring only minimal NIS treatment, the General Survey coverage may be bound into one volume. Supplementing the General Survey is the NIS Basic Intelligence fact book, a ready reference publication that semiannually updates key sta- tistical data found in the Survey. An unclassified edition of the factbook omits some details on the economy, the defense forces, and the intelligence and security organizations. Although detailed sections on many topics were part of the NIS Program, production of these sections has been phased out. Those pre- viously produced will continue to ba available as long fps the major portion of the study is considered valid. A quarterly listing of all active NIS units is published in the Inventory of Available NIS Publications, which is also bound into the concurrent classified Factbook. The Inventory lists all NIS units by area nonce and number and includes classification and date of issue; it thus facilitates the ordering of NIS units as well as their filing, cataloging, and utilization. Initial dissemination, additional copies of NIS units, or separate chapters of the General Surveys can be obtained directly or through liaison channels from the Central Intelligence Agency. The General Survey is prepared for the NIS by the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency under the general direction of the NIS Committee. It is coordinateu, edited, published, and dissemi- nated by the Central Intelligence Agency.

And the efficient exploitation of these resources has enabled Sweclen to become the largest producer of iron ore, the loth ranking producer of electricity, and one of the leading producers of timber -based products in the world. A concurrent development of' an aclvancl-cl technology in other areas has also erableel Sv.rdl-n to produce highly sophisticated, competitive manufactures for the world market. To a point it could he said of Sweden, as of its sister Scandinavian countries, that its labor force is its most vale ;tole resource. This has been especially true of the imaginative scientists. engineers, techuic�ians, and businessmen who have so skillfully exploited the country's few resources. \"There are signs, however, that the domestic Policy of the governing Social Democrats �in office now for 40 years ruay finally be having some adverse effect on competitive capacity and on individual Productivity. With S \\1'edisll wages, on the average, almost 50 higher than those prevailing in the Common Market countries, ever highly rationalized Swedish industry is beginning to be at a disadvantage. And Princ Minister Olof Palmc's drive for class equalit by Icweling incomes via the tax and cyage structures is having a belated imPa.t on incentive-, linge elements of the Protestant ethnic notwithstanding.

It is a business hierarchy that resembles the British '(11d Bo% Nehyork,' but with the crucial difference that there is not a breath of amateurism among the Swedish old lx)ys.

Like the hcoons of Japan (another nation alw: %s conscious that it must 'export or die'), they reserve their ultimate weapons of business combat for their for competitors, not for each other.

The Social Democratic government has generdly accommodated big business right up to the point of taking action Which would he popularly interpreted as compromis- ing Sweden's neutrality.

Notabl\\- during World War 1I, the Swedes for awhile had to supple the Nazi German conquerors of their sister Scandinavian countries.

Ii could be argued that Sweden's purchase of peace through such tribute may have been a net gain for the mail\\- .Norwegian and Banish refugees who found asylum in benevolently neatral Sweden, but the Swedes themselves still regard their World War 11 police with some ambivalence. And then there was the 1864 .war between little Denmark and its powerful Prussian aeighbor allied with Austria. Denmark we.it to war to protect its historic suzerainty over Schleswig and Holstein only after having received soma assurances of British and Swedish support. When both potential allies then stopped short of intervention on Denmark's behalf, the Danes had to lose quickly in so tmequal it struggle, and to cede Schleswig and Holstein to Prussia with the loss of 200.0M ethnic Danes. Although there is a very considerable body of opinion in Sweden that is discomfited by the \"moral abdication\" implicit in its strictly neatral statts �a segment latcl\\ reinforced for different reasons f,w the hardheaded business community �the historic success of the policy gives it continued momentunt. And a cogent factor inhibiting the forthright Swedish pro Wes.temer; is the plight of tethered Finland. within the Scandinavic::: romnuntity btt markedly suscep- tiblr to Soviet coercion.

But jest 2 claws after the Finnish Prime Minister returned hoole, Finland withdrew and the new organization collapsed. Amply suspicious of the existing ties to the West of the other Scandinavian countries, and apprehensive of the magnetism of the Common Market, the Soviets would brook no further involvement of Finland. The Swec'cs, for their part, did not .wish to j: opardize Finland's membership in the Nordic Council, so let the natter drop. \"Their historic sentimental attachment to the Finns is reinforced by the pragmatic need to hays this friendly buffer between themselves and the Russians.
