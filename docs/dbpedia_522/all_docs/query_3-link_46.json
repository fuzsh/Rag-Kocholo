        "text": "A NEW HOME FOR WHERE OUR PRODUCTS ARE BORN üíö This is the test rig we use to design and develop our district heating substations and heat interface units (HIUs) - and it's been on the move! Why? Because we've just relocated our laboratory to our new facility in Ronneby, and the testing rig is right at the heart of everything the lab does. After all, when you buy Cetetherm, you buy quality - and the key to that is rigorous testing. #heatingandcooling #heatingsolutions #districtheating #energyefficiency #sustainability\n\nOPTIMIZER - INTELLIGENT CONTROL OVER DISTRICT HEATING Digitalisation is revolutionising how district heating is monitored, controlled, and delivered, and at Cetetherm our Optimizer solution is leading the way! Watch this short video to hear Roger Dahlstrand, Global Sales Manager, explain how software, databases, and artificial intelligence came together to create the next generation of energy-efficient district heating solutions. #hotwatersystem #districtheating #heatpumps #energyefficiency #netzero\n\nRONNEBY GETS READY TO ROLL We announced the opening of our new Ronneby factory a few weeks ago, and since then we've been moving some of our people and departments into their new environment, ready to drive the next stage of our growth. Our warehousing and manufacturing functions are our latest 'arrivals', and you can see from the photos that this was no small task! üì¶ But at Cetetherm, we believe creating surroundings that nurture innovation is well worth the effort and look forward to the remaining offices moving across in September. #districtheating #heatpumps #energyefficiency #netzero #sustainablebuildings\n\nWHY WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT CETETHERM PIONEER AND BESA üå± BESA (The Building Engineering Services Association) has, for over 120 years, provided standards to enable building engineers and operators to make the right choices. And our Cetetherm Pioneer Heat Interface Unit (HIU) has just received the BESA 2023 standard's seal of approval! Leading the way in sustainable heating and hot water control, with up-to-the-minute benefits like heat pump compatibility and remote monitoring and optimisation, Cetetherm Pioneer has also been certified by BESA as offering the market's lowest return temperature - a clear indicator of optimal energy efficiency. See Cetetherm Pioneer's certification on the BESA website here ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/e5D7TxXF #heatingandcooling #heatingsolutions #districtheating #energyefficiency #sustainability\n\nHEAT PUMPS, HYBRID, SUBSTATIONS: THE NEXT GENERATION FROM RONNEBY Our factory in Ronneby, Sweden, is where our story began. Join Roger Dahlstrand, Global Sales Manager, as he shares our next chapter in this video, shot on the busy factory floor! Combining heat pumps with other heat sources in hybrid substation solutions is a Cetetherm innovation that Roger sees particular demand for, in the near future and beyond. #hotwatersystem #districtheating #heatpumps #energyefficiency #netzero\n\nON THE MOVE TO CETETHERM'S NEW FACTORY! Our new Ronneby factory is now home to a growing population, as our warehousing and manufacturing functions start the process of moving in. Lots of people, lots of parts, lots of pallets, lots of equipment - it's a hive of activity, but our modern, spacious, well organised new premises are taking it all in their stride. And it's a privilege to be part of this process, as we complete the next step in our growth journey, and create a facility ready for our customers' sustainable heating challenges and opportunities - now and in the future. #districtheating #heatpumps #energyefficiency #netzero #sustainablebuildings\n\nCETETHERM PIONEER - TESTED, APPROVED, AND BESA-CERTIFIED üèÖ Cetetherm's innovative Pioneer Heat Interface Unit (HIU) has now achieved the BESA 2023 standard, and is certified by BESA as the HIU with the market's lowest return temperature - and, therefore, highest energy efficiency. Heat pump-compatible, able to work with a low supply temperature, and featuring a built-in, energy-optimised idle function, Pioneer leads the way in lowering costs and consumption at every turn - for energy suppliers, property owners, service companies, and end-users. It's compact, light, and easy to install, too - for more info, visit ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/d_fBdMSh #heatingandcooling #heatingsolutions #districtheating #energyefficiency #sustainability"
