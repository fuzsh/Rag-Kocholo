A.; Santos, J. A. M., E-mail: joao.santos@ipoporto.min-saude.pt; ServiÃ§o de FÃ­sica MÃ©dica do Instituto PortuguÃªs de Oncologia do Porto Francisco Gentil, EPE, Porto\n\n2014-07-15\n\nPurpose: An original radionuclide calibrator method for activity determination is presented. The method could be used for intercomparison surveys for short half-life radioactive sources used in Nuclear Medicine, such as{sup 99m}Tc or most positron emission tomography radiopharmaceuticals. Methods: By evaluation of the resulting net optical density (netOD) using a standardized scanning method of irradiated Gafchromic XRQA2 film, a comparison of the netOD measurement with a previously determined calibration curve can be made and the difference between the tested radionuclide calibrator and a radionuclide calibrator used as reference device can be calculated. To estimate the total expected measurement uncertainties, a carefulmoreÂ Â» analysis of the methodology, for the case of{sup 99m}Tc, was performed: reproducibility determination, scanning conditions, and possible fadeout effects. Since every factor of the activity measurement procedure can influence the final result, the method also evaluates correct syringe positioning inside the radionuclide calibrator. Results: As an alternative to using a calibrated source sent to the surveyed site, which requires a relatively long half-life of the nuclide, or sending a portable calibrated radionuclide calibrator, the proposed method uses a source preparedin situ. An indirect activity determination is achieved by the irradiation of a radiochromic film using {sup 99m}Tc under strictly controlled conditions, and cumulated activity calculation from the initial activity and total irradiation time. The irradiated Gafchromic film and the irradiator, without the source, can then be sent to a National Metrology Institute for evaluation of the results. Conclusions: The methodology described in this paper showed to have a good potential for accurate (3%) radionuclide calibrators intercomparison studies for{sup 99m}Tc between Nuclear Medicine centers without source transfer and can easily be adapted to other short half-life\n\nMethods of separating short half-life radionuclides from a mixture of radionuclides\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBray, L.A.; Ryan, J.L.\n\n1998-09-15\n\nThe present invention is a method of obtaining a radionuclide product selected from the group consisting of {sup 223}Ra and {sup 225}Ac, from a radionuclide ``cow`` of {sup 227}Ac or {sup 229}Th respectively.

The results were then fitted using a non-paralizable dead time correction to the regular exponential decay and the individual half-life values obtained were then analyzed using both the Normalized Residuals and the Rajeval techniques, in order to reach the most exact and precise final values. To check the validity of dead-time correction, a second correction method was also employed by means of counting a long-lived {sup 60}Co radioactive sourcemoreÂ Â» together with the samples as a livetime chronometer. The final half-live values obtained using both dead-time correction methods were in good agreement, showing that the correction was properly assessed. The results obtained are partially compatible with the literature values, but with a lower uncertainty, and allow a discussion on the last ENSDF compilations' values.Â«Â less\n\nMeasurement of the half-life of 79Se with accelerator mass spectrometry\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDou, Liang; Jiang, Shan; Wang, Xiao-Bo; ...\n\n2014-10-01\n\nThe accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) is an effective method for the determination of the half-life of long-lived radionuclides. In this paper, we report a method for measurement of the half-life of 79Se. The number of 79Se atoms was determined from measured 79Se/Se absolute ratios with the AMS system at the China Institute of Atomic Energy and the decay rate of 79Se was determined by counting the emitted Î²-rays with a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The major improvements of our measurements include using the high abundance of an 79Se sample which was cooled for many years to exclude the interference of short-livedmoreÂ Â» nuclides, the extraction of SeO 2 - molecular ions, that results in a suppression of the 79 Br background by as much as about five orders of magnitude. Also, an AMS measurement of the absolute ratio of 79 Se/Se was developed to avoid systematic errors. The results show that 79 Se/Se is (2.35Â±0.12)Ã10 -7 in the reference sample and the radioactivity of 79Se is (1.24Â±0.05) Bq/g, so the half-life of 79Se is (2.78Â±0.18)Ã10 5 a.Â«Â less\n\nQuantification of 60Fe atoms by MC-ICP-MS for the redetermination of the half-life.\n\nPubMed\n\nKivel, Niko; Schumann, Dorothea; GÃ¼nther-Leopold, Ines\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIn many scientific fields, the half-life of radionuclides plays an important role. The accurate knowledge of this parameter has direct impact on, e.g., age determination of archeological artifacts and of the elemental synthesis in the universe. In order to derive the half-life of a long-lived radionuclide, the activity and the absolute number of atoms have to be analyzed. Whereas conventional radiation measurement methods are typically applied for activity determinations, the latter can be determined with high accuracy by mass spectrometric techniques. Over the past years, the half-lives of several radionuclides have been specified by means of multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) complementary to the earlier reported values mainly derived by accelerator mass spectrometry. The present paper discusses all critical aspects (amount of material, radiochemical sample preparation, interference correction, isotope dilution mass spectrometry, calculation of measurement uncertainty) for a precise analysis of the number of atoms by MC-ICP-MS exemplified for the recently published half-life determination of 60Fe (Rugel et al, Phys Rev Lett 103:072502, 2009).\n\nUpdate of NIST half-life results corrected for ionization chamber source-holder instability.\n\nPubMed\n\nUnterweger, M P; Fitzgerald, R\n\n2014-05-01\n\nAs reported at the ICRM 2011, it was discovered that the source holder used for calibrations in the NIST 4ÏÎ³ ionization chamber (IC) was not stable. This has affected a large number of half-life measurement results previously reported and used in compilations of nuclear data. Corrections have been made on all of the half-life data based on the assumption that the changes to the ionization chamber response were gradual. The corrections are energy dependent and therefore radionuclide specific. This presentation will review our results and present the recommended changes in half-life values and/or uncertainties.

Our objective was to quantify the absolute bioavailability of oral -Î±-tocopheryl acetate (Î±-TAc) in swine (22 Â± 1 kg and 8 wk old, fitted with jugular catheters) adapted to a diet supplemented with 75 mg/kg -Î±-TAc; 75 mg/kg was chosen because this level represents the nonweighted average inclusion level in piglet diets across Western key swine-producing countries. For this, a 350-g test meal (6% fat) was supplied at time 0 containing 75 mg deuterated (D9) -Î±-TAc to 9 animals, and 8 animals received an intravenous () dose containing deuterated (D6) RRR-Î±-tocopherol (Î±-T) at one-eighth the oral dose and a test meal without supplemental vitamin E. Plasma samples (12 to 13 per animal) were obtained at incremental intervals over 75 h for analysis of deuterated Î±-T using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Surprisingly, the i.v. dose rapidly disappeared from plasma and then reappeared. The half-life for this first peak was only 1.7 Â± 0.3 min. The second peak had an appearance rate (Ka) of 0.10 Â± 0.06 d and a half-life of 5.9 Â± 1.2 h. Oral dosing resulted, after a lag of 56 min, in a Ka of 0.91 Â± 0.21 d and a half-life of 2.6 Â± 0.8 h. The bioavailability for oral Î±-TAc was 12.5%, whereas the area under the curve was only 5.4%. This low bioavailability, small area under the curve, and short half-life are likely because of various factors, that is, the use of only 6% fat in the diet, the use of the acetate ester and , and the high dose relative to requirements. In conclusion, i.v. dosed vitamin E shows both a rapid and a very slow pool, whereas orally dosed vitamin E shows a single slow pool. The oral material has a very short half-live (44% of i.v. or 2.6 h), low bioavailability (12.5%), and a very small area under the curve (5.4%), bringing into question the efficacy of typical doses of vitamin\n\nStandardisation and half-life of 89Zr.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a-ToraÃ±o, E; PeyrÃ©s, V; Roteta, M; Mejuto, M; SÃ¡nchez-Cabezudo, A; Romero, E\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe nuclide 89 Zr is being tested for the labelling of compounds with long blood circulation times. It decays by beta plus emission (22.8%) and by electron capture (77.2%) to 89 Y. Its half-life has been determined by following the decay rate with two measurement systems; an Ionisation Chamber and an HPGe detector. The combination of six results gives a value of T 1/2 = 78.333 (38) h, slightly lower than the DDEP recommended value of 78.42 (13) h. This radionuclide has also been standardised by liquid scintillation counting, 4ÏÎ³ counting and coincidence techniques. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

S.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nShort half-life is one of the key challenges in the field of therapeutic peptides. Various studies have reported enhancement in the stability of peptides using methods like chemical modifications, D-amino acid substitution, cyclization, replacement of labile aminos acids, etc. In order to study this scattered data, there is a pressing need for a repository dedicated to the half-life of peptides. To fill this lacuna, we have developed PEPlife (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/peplife), a manually curated resource of experimentally determined half-life of peptides. PEPlife contains 2229 entries covering 1193 unique peptides. Each entry provides detailed information of the peptide, like its name, sequence, half-life, modifications, the experimental assay for determining half-life, biological nature and activity of the peptide. We also maintain SMILES and structures of peptides. We have incorporated web-based modules to offer user-friendly data searching and browsing in the database. PEPlife integrates numerous tools to perform various types of analysis such as BLAST, Smith-Waterman algorithm, GGSEARCH, Jalview and MUSTANG. PEPlife would augment the understanding of different factors that affect the half-life of peptides like modifications, sequence, length, route of delivery of the peptide, etc. We anticipate that PEPlife will be useful for the researchers working in the area of peptide-based therapeutics.\n\nA biomimetic approach for enhancing the in vivo half-life of peptides\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPenchala, Sravan C; Miller, Mark R; Pal, Arindom; Dong, Jin; Madadi, Nikhil R.; Xie, Jinghang; Joo, Hyun; Tsai, Jerry; Batoon, Patrick; Samoshin, Vyacheslav; Franz, Andreas; Cox, Trever; Miles, Jesse; Chan, William K; Park, Miki S; Alhamadsheh, Mamoun M\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe tremendous therapeutic potential of peptides has not yet been realized, mainly due to their short in vivo half-life. While conjugation to macromolecules has been a mainstay approach for enhancing the half-life of proteins, the steric hindrance of macromolecules often harms the binding of peptides to target receptors, compromising the in vivo efficacy. Here we report a new strategy for enhancing the in vivo half-life of peptides without compromising their potency. Our approach involves endowing peptides with a small-molecule that binds reversibly to the serum protein, transthyretin. Although there are few reversible albumin-binding molecules, we are unaware of designed small molecules that bind reversibly to other serum proteins and are used for half-life extension in vivo. We show here that our strategy was indeed effective in enhancing the half-life of an agonist for GnRH receptor while maintaining its binding affinity, which was translated into superior in vivo efficacy.

While radiolabeled antibodies have been considered for many years in this context, only a few have reached the level of routine clinical use. However, alternative radionuclides, with more appropriate physical properties, such as lutetium-177 or copper-67, as well as alpha-emitting radionuclides, including astatine-211, bismuth-213, actinium-225, and others are currently reviving hopes in cancer treatments, both in hematological diseases and solid tumors. At the same time, PET imaging, with short-lived radionuclides, such as gallium-68, fluorine-18 or copper-64, or long half-life ones, particularly iodine-124 and zirconium-89 now offers new perspectives in immuno-specific phenotype tumor imaging. New antibody analogues and pretargeting strategies have also considerably improved the performances of tumor immunotargeting and completely renewed the interest in these approaches for imaging and therapy by providing theranostics, companion diagnostics and news tools to make personalized medicine a reality.

Short plasma half life times are commonly due to fast renal clearance as well as to enzymatic degradation occurring during systemic circulation. Modifications of the peptide/protein can lead to prolonged plasma half life times. By shortening the overall amino acid amount of somatostatin and replacing L: -analogue amino acids with D: -amino acids, plasma half life time of the derivate octreotide was 1.5 hours in comparison to only few minutes of somatostatin. A PEG(2,40 K) conjugate of INF-alpha-2b exhibited a 330-fold prolonged plasma half life time compared to the native protein. It was the aim of this review to provide an overview of possible strategies to prolong plasma half life time such as modification of N- and C-terminus or PEGylation as well as methods to evaluate the effectiveness of drug modifications. Furthermore, fundamental data about most important proteolytic enzymes of human blood, liver and kidney as well as their cleavage specificity and inhibitors for them are provided in order to predict enzymatic cleavage of peptide and protein drugs during systemic circulation.\n\nHuman neutrophil kinetics: modeling of stable isotope labeling data supports short blood neutrophil half-lives.\n\nPubMed\n\nLahoz-Beneytez, Julio; Elemans, Marjet; Zhang, Yan; Ahmed, Raya; Salam, Arafa; Block, Michael; Niederalt, Christoph; Asquith, Becca; Macallan, Derek\n\n2016-06-30\n\nHuman neutrophils have traditionally been thought to have a short half-life in blood; estimates vary from 4 to 18 hours. This dogma was recently challenged by stable isotope labeling studies with heavy water, which yielded estimates in excess of 3 days. To investigate this disparity, we generated new stable isotope labeling data in healthy adult subjects using both heavy water (n = 4) and deuterium-labeled glucose (n = 9), a compound with more rapid labeling kinetics. To interpret results, we developed a novel mechanistic model and applied it to previously published (n = 5) and newly generated data. We initially constrained the ratio of the blood neutrophil pool to the marrow precursor pool (ratio = 0.26; from published values). Analysis of heavy water data sets yielded turnover rates consistent with a short blood half-life, but parameters, particularly marrow transit time, were poorly defined. Analysis of glucose-labeling data yielded more precise estimates of half-life (0.79 Â± 0.25 days; 19 hours) and marrow transit time (5.80 Â± 0.42 days). Substitution of this marrow transit time in the heavy water analysis gave a better-defined blood half-life of 0.77 Â± 0.14 days (18.5 hours), close to glucose-derived values. Allowing the ratio of blood neutrophils to mitotic neutrophil precursors (R) to vary yielded a best-fit value of 0.19. Reanalysis of the previously published model and data also revealed the origin of their long estimates for neutrophil half-life: an implicit assumption that R is very large, which is physiologically untenable. We conclude that stable isotope labeling in healthy humans is consistent with a blood neutrophil half-life of less than 1 day.

Albumin has an extended serum half-life of 3 weeks because of its size and FcRn-mediated recycling that prevents intracellular degradation, properties shared with IgG antibodies. Engineering the strictly pH-dependent IgG-FcRn interaction is known to extend IgG half-life. However, this principle has not been extensively explored for albumin. We have engineered human albumin by introducing single point mutations in the C-terminal end that generated a panel of variants with greatly improved affinities for FcRn. One variant (K573P) with 12-fold improved affinity showed extended serum half-life in normal mice, mice transgenic for human FcRn, and cynomolgus monkeys. Importantly, favorable binding to FcRn was maintained when a single-chain fragment variable antibody was genetically fused to either the N- or the C-terminal end. The engineered albumin variants may be attractive for improving the serum half-life of biopharmaceuticals.

In this context, radiocaesium deposited in soil following the Chernobyl accident on 26 April 1986 is known to have remained persistently available for plant uptake in many areas of Europe. Studies on the lichen Stereocaulon vesuvianum show the plant's high capacity to retain radionuclides from the substrate and the air. After the Chernobyl accident, starting from September 1986, at the Radioactivity Laboratory (LaRa) of the University of Naples Federico II, four monitoring campaigns to evaluate the activity concentration of four isotopes of the two elements caesium and ruthenium ( 134 Cs, 137 Cs, 103 Ru and 106 Ru) were carried out until 1999. This study allowed the effective half-life of 134 Cs and 137 Cs to be estimated. Twenty-eight years after the accident, in December 2014, a further sampling was carried out; only 137 Cs was revealed beyond the detection limits, measuring activity concentrations ranging from 20 to 40 Bq/kg, while the other radionuclides were no longer observed due to their shorter half-life.

To efficiently mitigate and control soil erosion and reduce its environmental impact in Alpine grasslands, reliable and validated methods for comprehensive data generation on its magnitude and spatial extent are mandatory. The use of conventional techniques (e.g. sediment traps, erosion pins or rainfall simulations) may be hindered by the extreme topographic and climatic conditions of the Alps. However, the application of the Fallout Radionuclides (FRNs) as soil tracers has already showed promising results in these specific agro-ecosystems. Once deposited on the ground, FRNs strongly bind to fine particles at the surface soil and move across the landscape primarily through physical processes. As such, they provide an effective track of soil and sediment redistribution. So far, applications of FRN in the Alps include 137Cs (half-life: 30.2 years) and 239+240Pu (239Pu [half-life = 24110 years] and 240Pu [half-life = 6561 years]). To investigate short term (4-5 years) erosion dynamics in the Swiss Alps, the authors applied a FRNs repeated sampling approach. Two study areas in the central Swiss Alps have been investigated: the Urseren Valley (Canton Uri), where significant land use changes occurred in the last centuries, and the Piora Valley (Canton Ticino), where land use change plays a minor role. Soil samples have been collected at potentially erosive sites along the valleys over a period of 4-5 years and measured for 137Cs and 239+240Pu activity. The inventory change between the sampling years indicates high erosion and deposition dynamics at both valleys. High spatial variability of 137Cs activities at all sites has been observed, reflecting the heterogeneous distribution of 137Cs fallout after the Chernobyl power plant accident in 1986. Finally, a new modelling technique to convert the inventory changes to quantitative estimates of soil erosion has\n\nBeta Decay Half-Life of 84Mo\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStoker, J.

Treatment of the background and the poor statistics accumulated during the previous half-life measurement leave questions about statistical and systematic errors. We have remeasured the half-life of ^84Mo using a concerted setup of the NSCL Î²-Counting System [3] and 16 detectors from the Segmented Germanium Array [4]. We will report the half-life for ^84Mo, deduced using 40 times the previous sample size. The application of the NSCL RF Fragment Separator to remove unwanted isotopes, and hence reduce background for the half-life measurement, will also be discussed. [1] H. Schatz et al., Phys.

CAP88 estimates radiation dose and the risk of health effects to human populations from radionuclide emissions to air. This program is used by several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facilities to comply with National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants regulations. CAP88 Mainframe, referred to as version 1.0 on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Web site (http://www.epa.gov/radiation/assessment/CAP88/), was the very first CAP88 version released in 1988. Some DOE facilities including the Savannah River Site still employ this version (1.0) while others use the more user-friendly personal computer Windows-based version 3.0 released in December 2007. Version 1.0 uses the program RADRISK based on International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 30 as its radionuclide database. Version 3.0 uses half-life, dose, and risk factor values based on Federal Guidance Report 13. Differences in these values could cause different results for the same input exposure data (same scenario), depending on which version of CAP88 is used. Consequently, the differences between the two versions are being assessed in detail at Savannah River National Laboratory. The version 1.0 and 3.0 database files contain 496 and 838 radionuclides, respectively, and though one would expect the newer version to include all the 496 radionuclides, 35 radionuclides are listed in version 1.0 that are not included in version 3.0. The majority of these has either extremely short or long half-lives or is no longer in production; however, some of the short-lived radionuclides might produce progeny of great interest at DOE sites. In addition, 122 radionuclides were found to have different half-lives in the two versions, with 21 over 3 percent different and 12 over 10 percent different.\n\nPrecision Half-life Measurement of 25Al\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLong, Jacob; Ahn, Tan; Allen, Jacob; Bardayan, Daniel; Becchetti, Fredrich; Blankstein, Drew; Brodeur, Maxime; Burdette, Daniel; Frentz, Bryce; Hall, Matthew; Kelly, James; Kolata, James; O'Malley, Patrick; Schultz, Bradley; Strauss, Sabrina; Valverde, Adrian; TwinSol Collaboration\n\n2017-09-01\n\nIn recent years, precision measurements have led to considerable advances in several areas of physics, including fundamental symmetry. Precise determination of ft values for superallowed mixed transitions between mirror nuclides could provide an avenue to test the theoretical corrections used to extract the Vud matrix element from superallowed pure Fermi transitions. Calculation of the ft value requires the half-life, branching ratio, and Q value. 25Al decay is of particular interest as its half-life is derived from a series of conflicting measurements, and the largest uncertainty on the ft value stems from the half-life uncertainty. The life-time was determined by the Î² counting of implanted 25Al on a Ta foil that was removed from the beam for counting. The 25Al beam was produced by a transfer reaction and separated by the TwinSol facility of the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre Dame. The 25Al results will be presented with preliminary results of more recent half-life measurements.

Data were collected every 100 seconds for 100,000-230,000 seconds within each measurement (n =4 ). The 511-keV incidence rate was calculated from the 511-keV spectral peak area and count duration, corrected for detector dead time and radioactive decay. Least-squares regression analysis was used to determine the half-life of 51Mn while accounting for the presence of background contaminants, notably 55Co. The result was 45.59 Â±0.07 min, which is the highest precision measurement to date and disagrees with the current Nuclear Data Sheets value by over 6 Ï .\n\nThe half-life of 218Po.\n\nPubMed\n\nMartz, D E; Harris, R T; Langner, G H\n\n1989-07-01\n\nDirect observation of the 218Po alpha-peak decay with a microcomputer-controlled alpha-spectrometer yielded a mean half-life value of 3.040 +/- 0.008 min, where the error quoted represents twice the standard deviation of the means from 38 separate decay measurements. The 1912 and 1924 218Po half-life measurements, which provided the 3.05-min value listed in nuclear tables for the past 60 y, are critically reviewed. Two more recent experiments, which yielded longer values of 3.11 min (Van Hise et al. 1982) and 3.093 min (Potapov and Soloshenkov 1986), are also discussed.\n\nHalf-life of Xe120\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPhillips, A.

The result, 46Â±0.6 min, differs significantly from the value 40Â±1 min reported by Andersson [Ark. Fys. 28, 37 (1964)]. We have also measured the half-lives of Cs120 and I120 to be 60Â±0.7 s and 82.1Â±0.6 min, respectively, both of which are consistent with previous measurements.\n\nStatic and dynamic half-life and lifetime molecular turnover of enzymes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMiyawaki, Osato; Kanazawa, Tsukasa; Maruyama, Chika; Dozen, Michiko\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe static half-life of an enzyme is the half-life of a free enzyme not working without substrate and the dynamic half-life is that of an active enzyme working with plenty amount of substrate. These two half-lives were measured and compared for glucoamylase (GA) and Î²-galactosidase (BG). The dynamic half-life was much longer than the static half-life by one to three orders of magnitude for both enzymes. For BG, the half-life of the enzyme physically entrapped in a membrane reactor was also measured. In this case also, the half-life of BG in the membrane reactor was much longer than the free enzyme without substrate. These results suggest the large difference in stabilities between the free enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complex. This may be related to the natural enzyme metabolism. According to the difference in half-life, the lifetime molecular turnover (LMT), which is the number of product molecules produced by a single molecule of enzyme until it loses its activity completely, was much higher by one to four orders of magnitude for the active enzyme than the free enzyme. The concept of LMT, proposed here, will be important in bioreactor operations with or without immobilization. Copyright Â© 2016 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The result, T1 /2=11.0011 (69) stat(30) sys s, is at variance by 17 combined standard deviations with the two most precise results.

Methods: A proton beam of wobbling system in the first proton center in Taiwan, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, was used to bombard the patient apertures. The patient aperture was composed of 60.5 % copper, 39.4 % Zinc, 0.05 % iron, 0.05 % lead. A protable high-purity germanium (HPGe) coaxial detector was used to measure the spectra of the induced nuclides of patient apertures. The analysis of the spectra and the identification of the radionuclides were preliminarilymoreÂ Â» operated by the Nuclide Navigator III Master Library. On the basis of the results by Nuclide Navigator III Master Library, we manually selected the reliable nuclides by the gamma-ray energies, branching ratio, and half life. In the spectra, we can quantify the activity of radionuclides by the Monte Carlo efficiency transfer method. Results: In this study, the radioisotopes activated in patient apertures by the 190-MeV proton beam were divided into two categories. The first category is long half-life radionuclides, such as Co-56 (half life, 77.3 days). Other radionuclides of Cu-60, Cu-61, Cu-62, Cu-66, and Zn-62 have shorter half life. The radionuclide of Cu-60 had the highest activity. From calculation with the efficiency transfer method, the deviations between the computed results and the measured efficiencies were mostly within 10%. Conclusion: To identify the radionuclides and quantify the activity helps us to estimate proper time intervals for cooling the patient apertures.

Our result for the half-life is 1.179 92(34) s. As a by-product of this measurement, we determine the half-life of its daughter, 30P, to be 2.501(2) min.\n\nHalf-life of the superallowed Î²+ emitter Ne18\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGrinyer, G.

F.\n\n2007-08-01\n\nThe half-life of Ne18 has been determined by detecting 1042-keV Î³ rays in the daughter F18 following the superallowed-Fermi Î²+ decay of samples implanted at the center of the 8ÏÎ³-ray spectrometer, a spherical array of 20 HPGe detectors. Radioactive Ne18 beams were produced on-line, mass-separated, and ionized using an electron-cyclotron-resonance ionization source at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. This is the first high-precision half-life measurement of a superallowed Fermi Î² decay to utilize both a large-scale HPGe spectrometer and the isotope separation on-line technique. The half-life of Ne18, 1.6656 Â± 0.0019 s, deduced following a 1.4Ï correction for detector pulse pile-up, is four times more precise than the previous world average. As part of an investigation into potential systematic effects, the half-life of the heavier isotope Ne23 was determined to be 37.11 Â± 0.06 s, a factor of 2 improvement over the previous precision.\n\nThe antitumor agent 3-bromopyruvate has a short half-life at physiological conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nGlick, Matthew; Biddle, Perry; Jantzi, Josh; Weaver, Samantha; Schirch, Doug\n\n2014-09-12\n\nClinical research is currently exploring the validity of the anti-tumor candidate 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP) as a novel treatment for several types of cancer. However, recent publications have overlooked rarely-cited earlier work about the instability of 3-BP and its decay to 3-hydroxypyruvate (3-HP) which have obvious implications for its mechanism of action against tumors, how it is administered, and for precautions when preparing solutions of 3-BP. This study found the first-order decay rate of 3-BP at physiological temperature and pH has a half-life of only 77 min. Lower buffer pH decreases the decay rate, while choice of buffer and concentration do not affect it. A method for preparing more stable solutions is also reported. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Yet uncertainty relating to the time period integrated by isotopic measurement of animal tissues can confound the interpretation of isotopic data. There have been a large number of experimental isotopic diet shift studies aimed at quantifying animal tissue isotopic turnover rate Î» (%Â·day(-1), often expressed as isotopic half-life, ln(2)/Î», days). Yet no studies have evaluated or summarized the many individual half-life estimates in an effort to both seek broad-scale patterns and characterize the degree of variability. Here, we collect previously published half-life estimates, examine how half-life is related to body size, and test for tissue- and taxa-varying allometric relationships. Half-life generally increases with animal body mass, and is longer in muscle and blood compared to plasma and internal organs. Half-life was longest in ecotherms, followed by mammals, and finally birds. For ectotherms, different taxa-tissue combinations had similar allometric slopes that generally matched predictions of metabolic theory. Half-life for ectotherms can be approximated as: ln (half-life) = 0.22*ln (body mass) + group-specific intercept; n = 261, p<0.0001, r2 = 0.63. For endothermic groups, relationships with body mass were weak and model slopes and intercepts were heterogeneous. While isotopic half-life can be approximated using simple allometric relationships for some taxa and tissue types, there is also a high degree of unexplained variation in our models. Our study highlights several strong and general patterns, though accurate prediction of isotopic half-life from readily available variables such as animal body mass remains elusive.\n\nRadionuclide development at BNL for nuclear medicine therapy.\n\nPubMed\n\nMausner, L F; Kolsky, K L; Joshi, V; Srivastava, S C\n\n1998-04-01\n\nRadionuclides with medium energy beta emission and a several day half-life have often been viewed as attractive candidates for radioimmunotherapy.

The rats were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 125I-Stx2 at three doses of 5.1-127.5 Î¼g/kg body weight. Stx2 had a short distribution half-life (t (1/2)Î±, less than 6 min) and a long elimination half-life in rat. The toxicokinetics of Stx2 in rats was dose dependent and nonlinear. Stx2 concentrations in various tissues were detected at 5-min, 0.5-h, and 72-h postinjection. High radioactivity was found in the lungs, kidneys, nasal turbinates, and sometimes in the eyes, which has never been reported in previous studies.

We have avoided the time-dependent instabilities to which such measurements are susceptible by directly measuring the half-life of (198)Au (t(1/2)=2.695 d) on seven occasions spread out in time to cover the complete range of Earth-Sun distances.

Thus, a fundamental question is: What features make a protein an efficient substrate for degradation? Here I will present results that proteins with a long terminal disordered segment or internal disordered segments have a significantly shorter half-life in yeast. This relationship appears to be evolutionarily conserved in mouse and human. Furthermore, upon gene duplication, divergence in the length of terminal disorder or variation in the number of internal disordered segments results in significant alteration of the half-life of yeast paralogs. Many proteins that exhibit such changes participate in signaling, where altered protein half-life will likely influence their activity. We suggest that variation in the length and number of disordered segments could serve as a remarkably simple means to evolve protein half-life and may serve as an underappreciated source of genetic variation with important phenotypic consequences.

Owing to their excellent specificity, low-toxicity, rich chemical diversity and availability from natural sources, FDA has successfully approved a number of peptide-based drugs and several are in various stages of drug development. Though peptides are proven good drug candidates, their usage is still hindered mainly because of their high susceptibility towards proteases degradation. We have developed an in silico method to predict the half-life of peptides in intestine-like environment and to design better peptides having optimized physicochemical properties and half-life. In this study, we have used 10mer (HL10) and 16mer (HL16) peptides dataset to develop prediction models for peptide half-life in intestine-like environment. First, SVM based models were developed on HL10 dataset which achieved maximum correlation R/R2 of 0.57/0.32, 0.68/0.46, and 0.69/0.47 using amino acid, dipeptide and tripeptide composition, respectively. Secondly, models developed on HL16 dataset showed maximum R/R2 of 0.91/0.82, 0.90/0.39, and 0.90/0.31 using amino acid, dipeptide and tripeptide composition, respectively. Furthermore, models that were developed on selected features, achieved a correlation (R) of 0.70 and 0.98 on HL10 and HL16 dataset, respectively. Preliminary analysis suggests the role of charged residue and amino acid size in peptide half-life/stability. Based on above models, we have developed a web server named HLP (Half Life Prediction), for predicting and designing peptides with desired half-life. The web server provides three facilities; i) half-life prediction, ii) physicochemical properties calculation and iii) designing mutant peptides. In summary, this study describes a web server 'HLP' that has been developed for assisting scientific community for predicting intestinal half-life\n\nAPT radionuclide production experiment\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nUllmann, J.L.; Gavron, A.; King, J.D.\n\n1994-07-02\n\nTritium ({sup 3}H, a heavy isotope of hydrogen) is produced by low energy neutron-induced reactions on various elements. One such reaction is n+{sup 3}He {yields}>{sup 3}H+{sup 1}H in which {sup 3}He is transmuted to tritium. Another reaction, which has been used in reactor production of tritium, is the n+{sup 6}Li {yields}> {sup 3}H+{sup 4}He reaction. Accelerator Production of Tritium relies on a high-energy proton beam to produce these neutrons using the spallation reaction, in which high-energy proton beam to produce these neutrons using the spallation reaction, in which high-energy protons reacting with a heavy nucleus produce a shower of low-energymoreÂ Â» neutrons and a lower-mass residual nucleus. It is important to quantify the residual radionuclides produced in the spallation target for two reasons. From an engineering point of view, one must understand short-lived isotopes that may contribute to decay heat. From a safety viewpoint, one must understand what nuclei and decay gammas are produced in order to design adequate shielding, to estimate ultimate waste disposal problems, and to predict possible effects due to accidental dispersion during operation. The authors have performed an experiment to measure the production of radioisotopes in stopping-length W and Pb targets irradiated by a 800 MeV proton beam, and are comparing the results to values obtained from calculations using LAHET and MCNP. The experiment was designed to pay particular attention to the short half-life radionuclides, which have not been previously measured. In the following, they present details of the experiment, explain how they analyzed the data and obtain the results, how they perform the calculations, and finally, how the experimental data agree with the calculations.Â«Â less\n\nLeadership in Higher Education and the Second Half of Life\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMills, Roxanne\n\n2006-01-01\n\nResearch indicates that little is understood about the impact of what has been called \"the second half of life\" on administrators in higher education, such as deans and department chairs.

The result, T1/2=116.100Â±0.025 ms, represents the most precise measurement to date (0.022%) for any superallowed Î²-decay half-life. When combined with six previous measurements of the Ga62 half-life, a new world average of T1/2=116.121Â±0.021 ms is obtained. This new half-life measurement results in a 20% improvement in the precision of the Ga62 superallowed ft value while reducing its mean by 0.9Ï to ft=3074.3(12) s.

The dominant uncertainty on the f t value of the 17F mirror transition stems from a number of conflicting half-life measurements. Purpose: A precision half-life measurement of 17F was performed and compared to previous results. Methods: The life-time was determined from the Î² counting of implanted 17F on a Ta foil that was removed from the beam for counting. The 17F beam was produced by transfers reaction and separated by the TwinSol facility of the Nuclear Science Laboratory of the University of Notre Dame. Results: The measured value of t1/2 new=64.402 (42) s is in agreement with several past measurements and represents one of the most precise measurements to date. In anticipation of future measurements of the correlation parameters for the decay and using the new world average t1/2 world=64.398 (61) s, we present a new estimate of the mixing ratio Ï for the mixed transition as well as the correlation parameters based on assuming Standard Model validity. Conclusions: The relative uncertainty on the new world average for the half-life is dominated by the large Ï2=31 of the existing measurements. More precision measurements with different systematics are needed to remedy to the situation.\n\nRadionuclide transfer from feed to camel milk.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Masri, M S; Al-Hamwi, A; Amin, Y; Safieh, M B; Zarkawi, M; Soukouti, A; Dayyoub, R; Voigt, G; Fesenko, S\n\n2014-06-01\n\nThe transfer of (137)Cs, (85)Sr, (131)I, (210)Po, (210)Pb and (238)U from feed to camel's milk was investigated in a pilot experiment with three lactating camels. For a period of 60 days, the animals were fed on spiked feed containing the studied radionuclides. They were subsequently returned to a contamination-free diet and monitored for another 90 days. The activity concentrations of (137)Cs, (85)Sr and (131)I in milk decreased with time and reached background levels after 20 days. Equilibrium transfer coefficients and biological half-lives were estimated and transfer coefficients were calculated as (8.1Â Â±Â 3.6)Â ÃÂ 10(-4), (4.4Â Â±Â 1.6)Â ÃÂ 10(-2), (7.8Â Â±Â 3.9)Â ÃÂ 10(-4), (2.7Â Â±Â 3.5)Â ÃÂ 10(-4), (1.8Â Â±Â 1.5)Â ÃÂ 10(-4) and (7.0Â Â±Â 3.6)Â ÃÂ 10(-3)Â dÂ L(-1) for (85)Sr, (131)I, (137)Cs, (210)Po, (210)Pb and (238)U, respectively. The biological half-lives were estimated to be 6.4, 4.2, 8.9, and 53.3 days for (85)Sr, (131)I, (137)Cs, and (238)U, respectively. Estimates of the half-lives were based on a one component model: it was found that the half-life values measured for artificial radionuclides were slightly shorter than those for natural radionuclides. The data obtained in the study are the first published experimental data on radionuclide transfer to camel milk. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our new value for the half-life of 60Fe is (2.62+/-0.04) x 10(6) yr, significantly above the previously reported value of (1.49+/-0.27) x 10(6) yr. Our new measurement for the lifetime of 60Fe has significant implications for interpretations of galactic nucleosynthesis, for determinations of formation time scales of solids in the early Solar System, and for the interpretation of live 60Fe measurements from supernova-ejecta deposits on Earth.\n\nTracing Fallout Radionuclide Behavior During Atmospheric Deposition and Pedogenesis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLandis, J. D.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nShort-lived fallout radionuclides 7Be (54 day half-life) and 210Pbexcess (22.3 year half-life) inform problems in geomorphology covering timespans of days to decades. Linking these radionuclides together is a powerful strategy, since the ratio 7Be:210Pb can control for changes in the activity of each, provided that the tracers have similar behavior through relevant chemical and physical processes such as interception, sorption, dilution, transport, etc. To investigate the extent to which 7Be and 210Pbxs share a common behavior, I measured these radionuclides in atmospheric deposition, vegetation, and stable soil, sediment and peat profiles. Bulk deposition of 7Be and 210Pb was measured in weekly intervals for 6 years of continuous record. Samples of red oak leaves (Quercus rubra) were collected regularly over 4 years at a site co-located with precipitation collection. Soil pits were sampled by high resolution methods at regional, undisturbed sites. In all samples 7Be, 210Pb, and other nuclides were measured by high-precision gamma spectrometry. Depositional fluxes of 7Be and 210Pb were highly correlated, with 7Be:210Pb converging to the long-term mean activity ratio of ca. 10.5 over intervals of 7 to 14 days. Red oak foliage accumulated 7Be and 210Pb at a linear rate during both growth and senescence, and appeared to maintain a dynamic equilibrium with atmospheric deposition. Canopies of both forest and grass intercepted on the order of 50% of deposition; the remainder reached underlying soil, where 7Be activity showed an exponential decline due to rapid hydrologic penetration of soil surface. Features of 210Pbxs soil profiles, including a subsurface maximum, reflect the same penetration pattern integrated over decades of deposition. Application of the Linked Radionuclide aCcumulation (LRC) model demonstrated that 210Pb moves through soil, peat and fluvial sediment profiles at rates on the order of 1 mm per year, similar to other atmospherically-derived metals\n\nVariation in absorption and half-life of hydrocortisone influence plasma cortisol concentrations.\n\nPubMed\n\nHindmarsh, Peter C; Charmandari, Evangelia\n\n2015-04-01\n\nHydrocortisone therapy should be individualized in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) patients to avoid over and under replacement. We have assessed how differences in absorption and half-life of cortisol influence glucocorticoid exposure. Forty-eight patients (21 M) aged between 6Â·1 and 20Â·3Â years with CAH due to CYP21A2 deficiency were studied. Each patient underwent a 24-h plasma cortisol profile with the morning dose used to calculate absorption parameters along with an intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone (15Â mg/m(2) body surface area) bolus assessment of half-life. Parameters derived were maximum plasma concentration (Cmax ), time of maximum plasma concentration (tmax ), time to attaining plasma cortisol concentration <100Â nmol/l and half-life of cortisol. Mean half-life was 76Â·5Â Â±Â 5Â·2 (range 40-225Â·3) min, Cmax 780Â·7Â Â±Â 61Â·6Â nmol/l and tmax 66Â·7 (range 20-118) min. Time taken to a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100Â nmol/l was 289 (range 140-540) min. Those with a fast half-life and slow tmax took longest to reach a plasma cortisol concentration less than 100Â nmol/l (380Â Â±Â 34Â·6Â min), compared to those with a slow half-life and fast tmax (298Â Â±Â 34Â·8Â min) and those with a fast half-life and fast tmax (249Â·5Â Â±Â 14Â·4Â min) (One-way anovaFÂ =Â 4Â·52; PÂ =Â 0Â·009). Both rate of absorption and half-life of cortisol in the circulation play important roles in determining overall exposure to oral glucocorticoid. Dose regimens need to incorporate estimates of these parameters into determining the optimum dosing schedule for individuals.

Such transcript half-lives provide important insights into the regulation of biological processes and the relative contributions of RNA decay and de novo transcription to differential gene expression. In this article, we present HALO (Half-life Organizer), the first software for the precise determination of transcript half-lives from measurements of RNA de novo transcription or decay determined with microarrays or RNA-seq. In addition, methods for quality control, filtering and normalization are supplied. HALO provides a graphical user interface, command-line tools and a well-documented Java application programming interface (API). Thus, it can be used both by biologists to determine transcript half-lives fast and reliably with the provided user interfaces as well as software developers integrating transcript half-life analysis into other gene expression profiling pipelines.

The implications of the new half-life of Si-32, which is used for dating studies, are discussed.\n\nBeta-decay half-lives for short neutron rich nuclei involved into the r-process\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPanov, I.; Lutostansky, Yu; Thielemann, F.-K.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe beta-strength function model based on Finite Fermi-Systems Theory is applied for calculations of the beta-decay half-lives for short neutron rich nuclei involved into the r- process. It is shown that the accuracy of beta-decay half-lives of short-lived neutron-rich nuclei is improving with increasing neutron excess and can be used for modeling of nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei in the r-process.\n\nUsing gamma distribution to determine half-life of rotenone, applied in freshwater.\n\nPubMed\n\nRohan, Maheswaran; Fairweather, Alastair; Grainger, Natasha\n\n2015-09-15\n\nFollowing the use of rotenone to eradicate invasive pest fish, a dynamic first-order kinetic model is usually used to determine the half-life and rate at which rotenone dissipated from the treated waterbody. In this study, we investigate the use of a stochastic gamma model for determining the half-life and rate at which rotenone dissipates from waterbodies. The first-order kinetic and gamma models produced similar values for the half-life (4.45 days and 5.33 days respectively) and days to complete dissipation (51.2 days and 52.48 days respectively). However, the gamma model fitted the data better and was more flexible than the first-order kinetic model, allowing us to use covariates and to predict a possible range for the half-life of rotenone. These benefits are particularly important when examining the influence that different environmental factors have on rotenone dissipation and when trying to predict the rate at which rotenone will dissipate during future operations. We therefore recommend that in future the gamma distribution model is used when calculating the half-life of rotenone in preference to the dynamic first-order kinetics model.

The geology of the Daren site consists of argillite and meta-sedimentary rocks. A mined cavern design with a tunnel system of 500 m below the surface is proposed. Concrete is used as the main confinement material for the engineered barrier. To investigate the hydrogeochemical transport of radionuclides through engineered barriers system, HYDROGEOCHEM5.0 model was applied to simulate the complex chemical interactions among radionuclides, the cement minerals of the concrete, groundwater flow,moreÂ Â» and transport in the proposed site. The simulation results showed that the engineered barriers system with the side ditch efficiently drained the ground water and lowered the concentration of the concrete degradation induced species (e.g., hydrogen ion, sulfate, and chloride). The velocity of groundwater observed at side ditch gradually decreased with time due to the fouling of pore space by the mineral formation of ettringite and thaumasite. The short half-life of Co-60, Sr-90 and Cs-137 significantly reduced the concentrations, whereas the long half-life of I-129(1.57x10{sup 7} years) and Am-241(432 years) remain stable concentrations at the interface of waste canister and concrete barrier after 300 years. The mineral saturation index (SI) was much less than zero due to the low aqueous concentration of radionuclide, so that the precipitation formation of Co-60, Sr-90, I-129, Cs-137 and Am-241 related minerals were not found. The effect of adsorption/desorption (i.e., surface complexation model) could be a crucial geochemical mechanism for the modeling of liquid-solid phase behavior of radionuclide in geochemically dynamic environments. Moreover, the development of advanced numerical models that are coupled with hydrogeochemical transport and dose assessment of radionuclide is required in the\n\nEvaluation of the 129I Half-Life Value Through Analyses of Primitive Meteorites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPravdivtseva, Olga; Meshik, Alex; Hohenberg, Charles M.\n\nThe preserved record of decay of now-extinct 129I into 129Xe forms the basis of the I-Xe chronometer. Comparison of the high precision I-Xe and Pb-Pb ages of chondrules and pure mineral phases separated from eight meteorites suggests the 17.5 Ã· 14.6 Ma range for the 129I half-life, assuming that the 235U and 238U half-lives are correct. The mean value of 16 Ma indicates that the 15.7 Ma half-life of 129I used here for the I-Xe age calculations is most probably correct. Since the 129I half-life value only affects the relative I-Xe ages, the few Ma relative to the Shallowater standard, the absolute I-Xe ages are almost immune to this uncertainty in the 129I half-life.\n\nHalf-life of the superallowed {beta}{sup +} emitter {sup 18}Ne\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGrinyer, G. F.; Andreoiu, C.; Finlay, P.\n\nThe half-life of {sup 18}Ne has been determined by detecting 1042-keV {gamma} rays in the daughter {sup 18}F following the superallowed-Fermi {beta}{sup +} decay of samples implanted at the center of the 8{pi}{gamma}-ray spectrometer, a spherical array of 20 HPGe detectors. Radioactive {sup 18}Ne beams were produced on-line, mass-separated, and ionized using an electron-cyclotron-resonance ionization source at the ISAC facility at TRIUMF in Vancouver, Canada. This is the first high-precision half-life measurement of a superallowed Fermi {beta} decay to utilize both a large-scale HPGe spectrometer and the isotope separation on-line technique. The half-life of {sup 18}Ne, 1.6656 {+-} 0.0019 s,moreÂ Â» deduced following a 1.4{sigma} correction for detector pulse pile-up, is four times more precise than the previous world average. As part of an investigation into potential systematic effects, the half-life of the heavier isotope {sup 23}Ne was determined to be 37.11 {+-} 0.06 s, a factor of 2 improvement over the previous precision.Â«Â less\n\nImmunoglobulin Fc domain fusion to TRAIL significantly prolongs its plasma half-life and enhances its antitumor activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Haizhen; Davis, Jennifer S; Wu, Xiangwei\n\n2014-03-01\n\nTRAIL (Apo2L) is a potent inducer of cell death. Interest in TRAIL has increased, following the observation that TRAIL can selectively kill a wide variety of human cancer cells without killing normal cells both in vitro and when grown as xenografts. Therefore, TRAIL has been proposed as a promising anticancer agent and currently is being tested in clinical trials. However, recombinant TRAIL has a very short plasma half-life, which limits its therapeutic potential. To overcome this limitation, we investigated the ability of the human IgG1 fragment crystallizable region (Fc) to enhance TRAIL stability. In this report, we show that Fc-TRAIL chimeric protein displays higher specific activity in vitro and a significantly longer half-life in mice than recombinant human TRAIL (rh-TRAIL). No short-term toxicity, especially liver toxicity, was observed. More importantly, Fc-TRAIL was much more effective in inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model compared with rh-TRAIL. Our data suggest that fusion of Fc to TRAIL is able to improve the bioavailability and activity of TRAIL both in vitro and in vivo, and Fc-TRAIL may be explored for future clinical applications in cancer treatment and prevention.

Yet data on its pharmacokinetics in humans is limited. We estimated the renal elimination half-life of monocrotophos. Consecutive patients presenting with monocrotophos overdose over a 2-month period who had normal renal function were recruited. Monocrotophos in plasma and urine were quantitated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Urine was obtained from catheterised samples at 0-2, 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-12 and 12-24 h. Plasma specimens were collected at the time of admission, and at the midpoint of the urine sample collections at 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 21 h. Renal elimination half-life was calculated from the cumulative amount excreted in the urine. The cohort of 5 male patients, aged 35.8 Â± 2.94 years, presented with typical organophosphate (cholinergic) toxidrome following intentional monocrotophos overdose. All patients required mechanical ventilation; one patient died. Plasma data was available from 5 patients and urine data from 3 patients. The median renal elimination half-life was 3.3 (range: 1.9-5.0 h). Plasma monocrotophos values, as natural log, fell in a linear fashion up to around 10 h after admission. After the 10-hour period, there was a secondary rise in values in all the 3 patients in whom sampling was continued after 10 h. A renal elimination half-life of 3.3 h for monocrotophos is consistent with a water-soluble compound which is rapidly cleared from the plasma. The secondary rise in plasma monocrotophos values suggests possible re-distribution. Determining the elimination profile of this compound will help develop better strategies for treatment.\n\nPotential fitness benefits of the half-pounder life history in Klamath River steelhead\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nHodge, Brian W.; Wilzbach, Peggy; Duffy, Walter G.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nSteelheadÂ Oncorhynchus mykissÂ from several of the world's rivers display the half-pounder life history, a variant characterized by an amphidromous (and, less often, anadromous) return to freshwater in the year of initial ocean entry. We evaluated factors related to expression of the half-pounder life history in wild steelhead from the lower Klamath River basin, California. We also evaluated fitness consequences of the half-pounder phenotype using a simple life history model that was parameterized with our empirical data and outputs from a regional survival equation. The incidence of the half-pounder life history differed among subbasins of origin and smolt ages. Precocious maturation occurred in approximately 8% of half-pounders and was best predicted by individual length in freshwater preceding ocean entry. Adult steelhead of the half-pounder phenotype were smaller and less fecund at age than adult steelhead of the alternative (ocean contingent) phenotype. However, our data suggest that fish of the half-pounder phenotype are more likely to spawn repeatedly than are fish of the ocean contingent phenotype. Models predicted that if lifetime survivorship were equal between phenotypes, the fitness of the half-pounder phenotype would be 17â28% lower than that of the ocean contingent phenotype. To meet the condition of equal fitness between phenotypes would require that first-year ocean survival be 21â40% higher among half-pounders in freshwater than among their cohorts at sea. We concluded that continued expression of the half-pounder phenotype is favored by precocious maturation and increased survival relative to that of the ocean contingent phenotype.\n\nOn the half-life of luminescence signals in dosimetric applications: A unified presentation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPagonis, V.; Kitis, G.; Polymeris, G. S.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nLuminescence signals from natural and man-made materials are widely used in dosimetric and dating applications. In general, there are two types of half-lives of luminescence signals which are of importance to experimental and modeling work in this research area. The first type of half-life is the time required for the population of the trapped charge in a single trap to decay to half its initial value. The second type of half-life is the time required for the luminescence intensity to drop to half of its initial value. While there a handful of analytical expressions available in the literature for the first type of half-life, there are no corresponding analytical expressions for the second type. In this work new analytical expressions are derived for the half-life of luminescence signals during continuous wave optical stimulation luminescence (CW-OSL) or isothermal luminescence (ITL) experiments. The analytical expressions are derived for several commonly used luminescence models which are based on delocalized transitions involving the conduction band: first and second order kinetics, empirical general order kinetics (GOK), mixed order kinetics (MOK) and the one-trap one-recombination center (OTOR) model. In addition, half-life expressions are derived for a different type of luminescence model, which is based on localized transitions in a random distribution of charges. The new half-life expressions contain two parts. The first part is inversely proportional to the thermal or optical excitation rate, and depends on the experimental conditions and on the cross section of the relevant luminescence process. The second part is characteristic of the optical and/or thermal properties of the material, as expressed by the parameters in the model. A new simple and quick method for analyzing luminescence signals is developed, and examples are given of applying the new method to a variety of dosimetric materials. The new test allows quick determination of whether a set of\n\n40 CFR Appendix D to Part 61 - Methods for Estimating Radionuclide Emissions\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2014 CFR\n\n2014-07-01\n\n... for decay Xenon 0.5/wk Based on xenon half-life of 5.3 days; Douglas bags: Released within one week Xenon 1 Provides no reduction of exposure to general public.

The type of radioactive decay and physical half-life of the radionuclide are immutable properties which, along with the demands of production and supply, limit the choice of radionuclides used in medicine to only a small fraction of those known to exist. In use, the biochemical and physiological properties of a radiotracer are dictated by the chemical form of the radionuclide. This chemical form may range from elemental, molecular or ionic, to complex compounds formed by coordinate or covalent bonding of the radionuclide to either simple organic or inorganic molecules, or complex macromolecules. Few of the radiotracers which are tested in model systems ever become radiopharmaceuticals in the strictest sense. Radionuclides, radiotracers and radiopharmaceuticals in use are reviewed. Drug legislation and regulations concerning drug manufacture, as well as hospital ethical constraints and legislation concerning unsealed sources of radiation must all be satisfied in order to translate a radiopharmaceutical from the laboratory to clinical use.\n\n19 CFR 207.27 - Short life cycle products.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-04-01\n\n... 19 Customs Duties 3 2013-04-01 2013-04-01 false Short life cycle products. 207.27 Section 207.27...

These transitions provide an experimental probe of the Conserved-Vector-Current hypothesis, the most precise determination of the up-down element of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix, and set stringent limits on the existence of scalar currents in the weak interaction. To calculate the Ft values several theoretical corrections must be applied to the experimental data, some of which have large model dependent variations. Precise experimental determinations of the ft values can be used to help constrain the different models. The uncertainty in the 22Mg superallowed Ft value is dominated by the uncertainty in the experimental ft value. The adopted half-life of 22Mg is determined from two measurements which disagree with one another, resulting in the inflation of the weighted-average half-life uncertainty by a factor of 2. The 22Mg half-life was measured with a precision of 0.02% via direct Î² counting at TRIUMF's ISAC facility, leading to an improvement in the world-average half-life by more than a factor of 3.\n\nÎ²+ decay and cosmic-ray half-life of 91Nb\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHindi, M.

T.; Norman, Eric B.\n\n1993-06-01\n\nIn the laboratory, 91Nb decays by electron capture with a 680-yr half-life. However, as a high energy cosmic ray, it would be stripped of its atomic electrons and would be able to undergo only Î²+ decay. We produced and chemically purified a sample of 91Nb and observed its decay with an array of Ge and NaI detectors. By following the Î²+ annihilation radiation, we were able to determine the Î²+ branching ratios of both the 105-keV, 61-d isomer and the ground state of 91Nb. The ground-state branch is (7.7+/-0.8)Ã10-3% leading to a Î²+ partial half-like of (8.8+/-1.9)Ã106 yr. Such a value of the half-life makes 91Nb a good candidate for determining the confinement time of this secondary component of the cosmic rays.\n\nExtending the half-life of a fab fragment through generation of a humanized anti-human serum albumin Fv domain: An investigation into the correlation between affinity and serum half-life.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdams, Ralph; Griffin, Laura; Compson, Joanne E; Jairaj, Mark; Baker, Terry; Ceska, Tom; West, Shauna; Zaccheo, Oliver; DavÃ©, Emma; Lawson, Alastair Dg; Humphreys, David P; Heywood, Sam\n\n2016-10-01\n\nWe generated an anti-albumin antibody, CA645, to link its Fv domain to an antigen-binding fragment (Fab), thereby extending the serum half-life of the Fab. CA645 was demonstrated to bind human, cynomolgus, and mouse serum albumin with similar affinity (1-7Â nM), and to bind human serum albumin (HSA) when it is in complex with common known ligands. Importantly for half-life extension, CA645 binds HSA with similar affinity within the physiologically relevant range of pH 5.0 - pH 7.4, and does not have a deleterious effect on the binding of HSA to neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). A crystal structure of humanized CA645 Fab in complex with HSA was solved and showed that CA645 Fab binds to domain II of HSA. Superimposition with the crystal structure of FcRn bound to HSA confirmed that CA645 does not block HSA binding to FcRn. In mice, the serum half-life of humanized CA645 Fab is 84.2Â h. This is a significant extension in comparison with < 1Â h for a non-HSA binding CA645 Fab variant. The Fab-HSA structure was used to design a series of mutants with reduced affinity to investigate the correlation between the affinity for albumin and serum half-life. Reduction in the affinity for MSA by 144-fold from 2.2Â nM to 316Â nM had no effect on serum half-life. Strikingly, despite a reduction in affinity to 62Â ÂµM, an extension in serum half-life of 26.4Â h was still obtained. CA645 Fab and the CA645 Fab-HSA complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession codes, 5FUZ and 5FUO, respectively.\n\nDexamethasone promotes granulocyte mobilization by prolonging the half-life of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor in healthy donors for granulocyte transfusions.\n\nPubMed\n\nHiemstra, Ida H; van Hamme, John L; Janssen, Machiel H; van den Berg, Timo K; Kuijpers, Taco W\n\n2017-03-01\n\nGranulocyte transfusion (GTX) is a potential approach to correcting neutropenia and relieving the increased risk of infection in patients who are refractory to antibiotics. To mobilize enough granulocytes for transfusion, healthy donors are premedicated with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and dexamethasone. Granulocytes have a short circulatory half-life. Consequently, patients need to receive GTX every other day to keep circulating granulocyte counts at an acceptable level. We investigated whether plasma from premedicated donors was capable of prolonging neutrophil survival and, if so, which factor could be held responsible. The effects of plasma from G-CSF/dexamethasone-treated donors on neutrophil survival were assessed by annexin-V, CD16. and CXCR4 staining and nuclear morphology. We isolated an albumin-bound protein using Î±-chymotrypsin and albumin-depletion and further characterized it using protein analysis. The effects of dexamethasone and G-CSF were assessed using mifepristone and G-CSF-neutralizing antibody. G-CSF plasma concentrations were determined by Western blot and Luminex analyses. G-CSF/dexamethasone plasma contained a survival-promoting factor for at least 2 days. This factor was recognized as an albumin-associated protein and was identified as G-CSF itself, which was surprising considering its reported half-life of only 4.5 hours. Compared with coadministration of dexamethasone, administration of G-CSF alone to the same GTX donors led to a faster decline in circulating G-CSF levels, whereas dexamethasone itself did not induce any G-CSF, demonstrating a role for dexamethasone in increasing G-CSF half-life. Dexamethasone increases granulocyte yield upon coadministration with G-CSF by extending G-CSF half-life. This observation might also be exploited in the coadministration of dexamethasone with other recombinant proteins to modulate their half-life.

This research explores applications of neutron activation analysis (NAA) in two parts. Part 1. High Precision Methods for Measuring Decay Half-Lives, Chapters 1 through 8 Part one develops research methods and data analysis techniques for making high precision measurements of nuclear beta decay half-lives. The change in the electron capture half-life of 51Cr in pure chromium versus chromium mixed in a gold lattice structure is explored, and the 97Ru electron capture decay half-life are compared for ruthenium in a pure crystal versus ruthenium in a rutile oxide state, RuO2. In addition, the beta-minus decay half-life of 71mZn is measured and compared with new high precision findings. Density Functional Theory is used to explain the measured magnitude of changes in electron capture half-life from changes in the surrounding lattice electron configuration. Part 2. Debris Collection Nuclear Diagnostic at the National Ignition Facility, Chapters 9 through 11 Part two explores the design and development of a solid debris collector for use as a diagnostic tool at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). NAA measurements are performed on NIF post-shot debris collected on witness plates in the NIF chamber. In this application NAA is used to detect and quantify the amount of trace amounts of gold from the hohlraum and germanium from the pellet present in the debris collected after a NIF shot. The design of a solid debris collector based on material x-ray ablation properties is given, and calculations are done to predict performance and results for the collection and measurements of trace amounts of gold and germanium from dissociated hohlraum debris.\n\nSuperior serum half life of albumin tagged TNF ligands\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMueller, Nicole; Schneider, Britta; Pfizenmaier, Klaus\n\n2010-06-11\n\nDue to their immune stimulating and apoptosis inducing properties, ligands of the TNF family attract increasing interest as therapeutic proteins. A general limitation of in vivo applications of recombinant soluble TNF ligands is their notoriously rapid clearance from circulation. To improve the serum half life of the TNF family members TNF, TWEAK and TRAIL, we genetically fused soluble variants of these molecules to human serum albumin (HSA). The serum albumin-TNF ligand fusion proteins were found to be of similar bioactivity as the corresponding HSA-less counterparts. Upon intravenous injection (i.v.), serum half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins, as determined bymoreÂ Â» ELISA, was around 15 h as compared to approximately 1 h for all of the recombinant control TNF ligands without HSA domain. Moreover, serum samples collected 6 or 24 h after i.v. injection still contained high TNF ligand bioactivity, demonstrating that there is only limited degradation/inactivation of circulating HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins in vivo. In a xenotransplantation model, significantly less of the HSA-TRAIL fusion protein compared to the respective control TRAIL protein was required to achieve inhibition of tumor growth indicating that the increased half life of HSA-TNF ligand fusion proteins translates into better therapeutic action in vivo. In conclusion, our data suggest that genetic fusion to serum albumin is a powerful and generally applicable mean to improve bioavailability and in vivo activity of TNF ligands.Â«Â less\n\nConsideration on the Long Ecological Half-Life Component of (137)Cs in Demersal Fish Based on Field Observation Results Obtained after the Fukushima Accident.\n\nPubMed\n\nTagami, Keiko; Uchida, Shigeo\n\n2016-02-16\n\nRadiocesium concentrations in most marine fish collected off the coast of Fukushima and surrounding prefectures have decreased with time, and four years after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident occurred, radiocesium concentrations have generally fallen below the detectable level (ca. < 10 Bq kg(-1)-raw). Only in some demersal fish species have detectable concentration levels still been found, and even these species have showed slow radiocesium decreases. The food web was considered as the major factor causing this phenomenon; however, slow elimination rates of radiocesium from these fish species also could be the cause. The latter effect was examined by considering that the (137)Cs concentration decreasing trend in fish could be fit with a set of three exponentially decreasing components; that is, having short, intermediate, and long biological half-lives. The long ecological half-life component was calculated using a 400-1500 d period of monitoring results for Japanese rockfish (Sebastes cheni) and compared with previous reported laboratory results for biological half-life. The obtained ecological half-lives ranged from 274-365 d, and these values agreed with the biological half-life of this fish species. This result implied that the long biological half-lives of radiocesium in some demersal fish species made their radiocesium contamination periods longer.\n\nHigh-precision half-life determination for 21Na using a 4 Ï gas-proportional counter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFinlay, P.; Laffoley, A.

E.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nA high-precision half-life measurement for the superallowed Î²+ transition between the isospin T =1 /2 mirror nuclei 21Na and 21Ne has been performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC radioactive ion beam facility yielding T1 /2=22.4506 (33 ) s, a result that is a factor of 4 more precise than the previous world-average half-life for 21Na and represents the single most precisely determined half-life for a transition between mirror nuclei to date. The contribution to the uncertainty in the 21Na F tmirror value due to the half-life is now reduced to the level of the nuclear-structure-dependent theoretical corrections, leaving the branching ratio as the dominant experimental uncertainty.\n\nGeochemical constraints on the half-life of {sup 130}Te\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nThomas, H.
