It is the seventh in a series of best practices reviews conducted by the Office of the Legislative Auditor. The 1994 Legislature established best practices reviews as a means of identifying effective and efficient practices in delivering local government services. The intent was to help local governments improve the delivery of services by learning about successful practices in use by similar jurisdictions elsewhere. In May 2001, the Legislative Audit Commission directed our office to study best practices in providing local e-government services and managing local computer systems, based on a recommendation by the Local Government Advisory Council, which was established to recommend topics. Our report on managing computer systems is being released as a separate document.\n\nWe acknowledge and appreciate the help provided by many local government officials involved with planning and maintaining computer systems in general and e-government in particular. Their expertise represented a substantial contribution to this report. The Office of Technology in Minnesota's Department of Administration also provided assistance.\n\nThe report was researched and written by Jody Hauer (project manager), Jan Sandberg, Kathryn Olson, Carrie Meyerhoff, and Leah Goldstein Moses.

The report recommends that local governments adopt these best practices if they offer e-government.\n\nRecommended Best Practices:\n\nBefore deciding to proceed with e-government, local governments should assess whether to offer it (p. 15).\n\nWhile planning, local governments should evaluate others' Web sites and look for opportunities to collaborate (p. 24).\n\nLocal governments should plan the implementation of their Web sites, including identifying the dollars and personnel skills needed (p. 30).\n\nCommensurate with the level of risk, local governments need adequate security to protect Web sites and related equipment and databases (p. 35).\n\nLocal governments should set policies to guide e-government, including policies on privacy and public access to data (p. 49).\n\nIn designing Web sites, local governments should follow guidelines on format and presentation and test pages before releasing them (p. 58).\n\nLocal governments should evaluate their Web sites and revise them based on user feedback (p. 64).\n\nIn addition to these recommended best practices, the review found that:\n\nLarge jurisdictions were more likely than small ones to have Web sites. In 2001, about 63 percent of Minnesota counties and school districts offered some form of e-government compared with 29 percent of cities (most of which were larger cities) (p. 70).\n\nThe proportion of residents using the Internet in 2001 was higher in Minnesota than in all states but Alaska and was tied with New Hampshire. The number of Minnesotans with Internet access in 2001 increased 10 percent over 1999 (pp. 81-82).\n\nLocal governments should get involved with e-government only after determining they have the resources to maintain a Web site. Report Summary: E-government is information or services provided on-line by local governments to individuals using the Internet and Web sites. It ranges from simple Web sites conveying only basic information to very complex sites that transform the customary ways of delivering local services.\n\nBecause successful e-government requires ongoing resources, local governments need to weigh the potential costs against likely benefits before implementing it. For effective Web sites, local governments should follow seven best practices.\n\n1. Assess Whether to Offer E-Government\n\nIn preparing for e-government, local governments should set strategic goals and objectives. As part of their strategic thinking, they should decide which local services are suitable for on-line delivery. They also need to determine whether they have access to the technology, expertise, and funding that e-government requires over the long term. Local governments with multiple departments need to coordinate Web-related activities. From the beginning, local governments should identify the potential users of their Web sites and understand what they need.\n\nA survey of Minnesota's local governments revealed that of those with Web sites, about 40 percent of school districts, and just 10 percent or less of counties and cities, had written strategic plans covering e-government. Most local governments reported assessing their readiness for e-government in certain areas before implementing it. Just under half of local governments reported at least some success in identifying potential users' needs.\n\nExample: In developing its Web site, the city of Buffalo collected information about potential users by surveying a sample of residents, analyzing the questions frequently asked at city hall's front desk, and working with city departments to identify information that users needed. On the Web site, the city invites users to offer ideas and feedback, and it includes a direct e-mail link to city staff responsible for maintaining the site.\n\n2. Assess Opportunities for Collaboration\n\nTo benefit from others' expertise and to share resources, local governments considering e-government should evaluate similar government Web sites and learn from others. By exploring partnerships with other entities, local governments may be able to share costs. Between 37 and 49 percent of local governments offering e-government reported working with others while either planning, implementing, or maintaining their Web sites.\n\nExample: In the Red Rock Central School District located in southwestern Minnesota's Redwood County, district staff teamed up with a nearby farmers' cooperative to develop infrastructure for wireless, high-speed Internet access that would connect residents of the district's five geographically dispersed cities. In exchange for financial backing and the use of its grain elevators to mount wireless transmitters, the farmers' cooperative receives ongoing technical support and high-speed Internet access to connect its remote office locations.\n\n3. Prepare to Execute and Fund E-Government\n\nIn preparing for e-government, local governments should detail the steps they plan to take and analyze the economics of their proposed initiatives. Web sites demand ongoing resources over time.\n\nStrategic thinking should guide the development of e-government. Consequently, local governments should examine their sites' \"total costs of ownership,\" including costs for maintenance, training, and equipment disposal. Knowing the full costs of e-government initiatives, local governments should develop a strategy to fund them. They should also assign responsibility for e-government to a central department or individual.\n\nOnly about 17 percent of local governments reported that they formally planned the implementation of e-government once they decided to proceed. One-third of local governments reported estimating life-cycle costs for items such as contracts with Internet service providers, but fewer did so for other expenses. Nearly two-thirds of local governments offering on-line information or services were at least somewhat successful in assigning e-government responsibility to a specific project manager or department.\n\nExample: In 1999, Blue Earth County created a position for a public information coordinator whose job duties included keeping the Web site current and viable. Although the county had developed a Web site two years earlier, the site had not been consistently updated. Working with individual county departments, the public information coordinator ensured that the Web site described each department accurately, contained current information, and better met citizens' needs.\n\n4. Provide Security All jurisdictions offering e-government need to implement security measures to protect against external and internal threats, and higher risk sites will require greater security than others. Local governments should assess risks to their Web sites and related equipment and databases. Based on that assessment, they should develop security policies to protect their investments. Local governments should install \"firewalls,\" use up-to-date antivirus programs and be prepared for security incidents. They should manage employee access to the Web site and related data. Local governments should test security measures and provide for outside parties to assess whether security is sound.\n\nLess than half of local governments offering e-government reported having conducted a partial or full risk assessment. Nearly 53 percent reported that they had fully developed plans for Web-site data backups and disaster recovery. About 31 percent had fully reviewed the adequacy of their security, and 11 percent provided for a full third-party assessment of security controls.\n\nExample: The Minneapolis School District has prepared disaster-recovery plans for its information technology systems. In its plan, the district analyzes the scope of possible disasters that could interrupt computer services, designates a disaster recovery team, and assigns each team member specific tasks under various disaster scenarios. Agreements with outside organizations allow the district to continue computer processing at remote sites should a disaster strike.\n\n5. Set a Policy Framework to Guide E-Government\n\nTo manage e-government, local governments should adopt policies that govern how employees use the Web sites to conduct business, control which data will be published on-line, and determine how the Web sites will be marketed. Local governments should also set a privacy policy and display it prominently on their sites. They need to determine whether their Web sites are sufficiently accessible to users with disabilities and those who do not speak English.\n\nOf local governments offering e-government, 43 percent reported that they had written policies to delineate\n\nSUMMARY xi Security is essential to e-government. the purpose of using the Web site to accomplish their business. Very few had developed policies to market their Web sites, and few had privacy policies governing what information would be collected from site visitors. About 14 percent indicated that their sites complied with guidelines to make Web sites accessible for people with disabilities, but most simply did not know whether their sites complied.\n\nExample: At the bottom of each page on the Stearns County Web site is a link to the county's privacy policy. The county states its purpose for collecting information (such as e-mail addresses) from visitors and declares that it will not sell or transfer the information to third parties unless required to by law or court order. The policy also makes clear that the county intends to keep confidential any sensitive information collected from site visitors.\n\n6. Make the Web Site Function Optimally\n\nLocal governments should design their Web sites to meet user needs and their own e-government objectives. This includes following accepted practices on the visual style of Web pages, such as identifying the jurisdiction on each page and using uncluttered pages with consistent headers and fonts. Before launching Web pages, local governments should test and make sure that they function as intended. They must also plan for ongoing maintenance.\n\nAbout 78 percent of the local governments offering e-government indicated that, in developing their Web sites, they defined the likely target audience for the site. High percentages of local governments reported meeting certain guidelines that make Web sites readable, such as displaying contact names, addresses, and telephone numbers. About 67 percent of local governments offering e-government reported that they had assigned responsibility to test Web pages. Only 8 percent had written plans describing procedures for Web site upkeep.\n\nExample: In a recent redesign of its Web site, Ramsey County made changes to better meet its users' needs. The county conducted an on-line survey, querying users about what information and services they wanted. Staff also analyzed statistics showing which Web pages had the highest level of interest among users. The redesigned site presents viewers with subjects listed by users' likely interests, such as \"recreation.\" The site's appearance is more consistent from page to page than previously, and the home page changes frequently depending on users' interests and the season of the year.\n\n7. Evaluate E-Government Local governments should evaluate their Web sites to determine how well they meet e-government goals. They should also identify enhancements and revise their Web sites periodically. Just 19 percent of local governments offering e-government reported that they had evaluated their Web sites. However, half reported that they had revised their sites based on feedback from users.\n\nExample: Although the city of Plymouth has had a Web site since 1996, staff view it as a service that needs ongoing revisions. Over time, staff have made minor revisions based on reactions to the site and their analysis of usage patterns. In addition, staff are planning a major redesign in an effort to expand the site, make it easier to navigate, and make it easier to manage with city departments providing updated Web content. In response to feedback, the city is considering on-line utility information with the possibility of on-line utility payments.\n\nLocal governments need to provide ongoing maintenance of their Web sites. Introduction This report examines best practices for e-government by Minnesota local governments. Broadly stated, e-government refers to government agencies using the Internet, Web sites, and e-mail to exchange information, do business, and provide public services electronically. 1 In this report, though, we focus on how Minnesota counties, cities, and school districts use Web sites to provide information or services to citizens. Because e-government is a relatively new mode of delivering local services, the question of how best to provide it is an important one.\n\nOn-line information and services are still evolving. Yet, the experience gained to date has yielded many practices that are necessary for effective e-government. In May 2001, the Legislative Audit Commission directed our office to study best practices in providing local e-government. The study addresses these research questions:\n\nWhat is e-government, and what infrastructure is necessary to facilitate it? What are the potential costs and benefits of e-government? What best practices are necessary to fulfill the goals of e-government? What are the obstacles to e-government? How are local governments paying for e-government? How widespread is citizen access to computers that tap into e-government?\n\nTo answer these questions we studied the literature and reviewed Web sites on e-government. We identified guidelines for planning, implementing, and maintaining e-government. To learn more about the status of e-government in Minnesota, we surveyed counties, cities, and school districts around the state. After identifying local governments that have adopted best practices for e-government, we visited a small number of them, interviewing local officials about the practices they follow to make their Web sites effective communication vehicles. During the course of the study, we met with a technical advisory panel of local officials involved with e-government in their own jurisdictions. This panel offered feedback to us as we conducted the research. More information on the methodology of the study is available in Appendix A.\n\n1 The Internet is a global collection of computer networks connected together to form a single, interconnected network for communications. Web sites are collections of related files (commonly with a beginning file called a \"home page\"), available over the World Wide Web, which is the \"universe\" of network-accessible information. E-mail refers to the exchange of computer-stored messages, most often using the Internet.\n\nThis report has three chapters. Chapter 1 describes e-government and provides basic background information about it. Chapter 2 recommends best practices that local governments should take to achieve the goals of e-government, if they decide to proceed with it. This chapter also offers examples of Minnesota counties, cities, and school districts that have used best practices in their e-government efforts. In Chapter 3, we describe what we learned about e-government in Minnesota and obstacles to it. We also provide information on the extent of individuals' access to the Internet.\n\n1 Background SUMMARY In this study, e-government is defined as information or transactions provided on-line by local governments to citizens using the Internet and Web sites. The complexity of Web sites ranges from those that merely provide information to others that allow electronic financial transactions. Costs of e-government vary but include the expertise and time needed to develop and maintain Web sites as well as the recurring costs of acquiring and replacing technology equipment. Benefits of e-government also vary but range from adding convenience, to enhancing citizen interactions with local government, to transforming the way certain services are delivered. Because Web sites require ongoing resources, local governments should assess the potential costs against likely benefits before proceeding with e-government.\n\nThis chapter provides background on electronic government, or e-government, in Minnesota. In this chapter we address the following research questions:\n\nWhat is e-government?\n\nWhat are the potential costs and benefits of adopting e-government?\n\nWhat infrastructure is necessary to facilitate e-government? To answer these questions, we conducted a literature review and reviewed information from Web sites pertaining to e-government. We also spoke with local government officials involved with developing Web sites for their jurisdictions. Additional information on the methodology for this study is in Appendix A.\n\nWHAT IS E-GOVERNMENT? E-government means different things to different people. For this study, we used the following definition:\n\n1 At the same time this study was underway, we conducted research on best practices in managing local computer systems. Although these two studies covered some similar ground, each was distinct enough to warrant separate reports. The report on managing computer systems is available at www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/ped/2002/pe0209.htm.\n\nE-government refers to information or transactions that local governments provide on-line to citizens using the Internet and Web sites. Our focus is on the electronic communications between citizens and the counties, cities, and school districts in which they live and interact. This definition excludes communications between and among government agencies, such as local governments reporting data to the state, or communications between local governments and businesses, such as that for procuring supplies on-line. This study excludes e-government at the state level, although the state of Minnesota has an increasing number of e-government services and is involved in a project to improve access to such services. 2 Services such as e-mail, on-line training, and employee telecommuting also rely extensively on the Internet and information technology systems. While these types of services are related to e-government, they are not this study's focus. Nor do we discuss intranets, the electronic networks that are based on Internet technology but are internal to users within an organization and not accessible by outside users.\n\nEven though we confined our definition to electronic information and services between residents and local governments, a wide spectrum of services falls within this definition. Figure 1.1 depicts this spectrum. At one end is a basic Web page, which simply conveys information. It is an electronic brochure providing directories of employees, lists of departments, news about events, or information about services.\n\nFurther along the spectrum, Web sites offer limited ways of transacting business. For instance, in addition to job descriptions, the site may provide a job application form for someone to print, fill out, and return. At the next step along the spectrum, transactions between individuals and local governments are completed electronically. Job applicants would not only fill out applications electronically but also submit them on-line, even if the submission is then processed just as a mailed or faxed one would be. At the far end of the spectrum, the Web site enables a transformation of traditional service delivery. Job applications submitted on-line would be integrated into the human resources department's database where they would be automatically coded by basic eligibility standards and organized for analysis. Ideally, financial transactions would flow smoothly and securely allowing convenience to the front-end user and efficiencies in the back-office systems. At this stage, operations that were once labor-intensive become more efficient digital processes.\n\nFigure 1.1: Spectrum of E-Government Web Sites\n\nSOURCE: Office of the Legislative Auditor.\n\nProvides forms that may be printed and mailed\n\nProvides information describing the jurisdiction and its operations\n\nOffers a means to submit information on-line Information Only Service Transformations\n\nOffers a means to complete financial transactions on-line\n\nE-government ranges from information-only Web sites to those that transform service delivery.\n\n2 For information on the state of Minnesota's effort to improve e-government services at the state level, see http://www.portal.state.mn.us/.\n\nAt each successive stage of the spectrum, the complexity of Web sites increases. In turn, the amount of planning, time for development, sophistication of the technology, and actions needed to maintain the sites also increase. For example, the extent of security needed to allow safe financial transactions over the Web is far greater than that for an information-only site.\n\nE-Government Is a Matter of Local Priorities In an October 2001 survey we conducted, many of Minnesota's counties, cities, and school districts indicated that they either already offer information or services on-line or expect to within the year. This pattern differed, however, by type of local government, as explained in Chapter 3, with some jurisdictions opting against on-line services. In this report, we do not presume that all local governments ought to provide e-government. Adopting e-government should be a local decision made in light of all other competing priorities. Its costs should be weighed against its benefits. Because e-government requires ongoing resources, local governments should have a clear understanding of what is needed before committing to it.\n\nPOTENTIAL COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ADOPTING E-GOVERNMENT\n\nLocal governments already offering e-government, or interested in doing so, should be aware that Web sites have life cycles with recurring phases for planning, implementing, and maintaining the sites. Ongoing commitments of time, equipment, and intellectual resources are necessary for successful Web sites. Consequently, to be realistic, costs should reflect these continuing cycles of activity. (Chapter 2 provides more details on the concept of estimating \"life-cycle\" costs when planning e-government.) Similarly, benefits of e-government accrue more over time as the user base expands and additional services go on-line.\n\nJust as the Web sites in the spectrum described above evolved in increasingly greater complexity, so too will costs and benefits vary. As Web sites progress in complexity from information-only sites to offering business transactions, the potential for rising costs and benefits also increases. Complexity is a function of many interrelated factors: the range of services the Web site is intended to provide, need for additional security, level of customization, amount of information provided, need for outside expertise, use of e-mail, integration with back-office databases, and frequency of updates. Sites that allow the use of credit cards to pay for parks reservations, for instance, collect nonpublic data and need higher levels of security than others. At the same time, benefits to the end user, in terms of saving time and reducing the hassles of making reservations, are also greater than those offered by a site that merely describes the availability of parks.\n\nBACKGROUND 5 Costs and benefits typically increase as Web sites grow incomplexity.\n\nPotential Costs This section lists the costs that governments are likely to encounter with e-government. It is difficult to list actual amounts of the costs for two reasons. First, the actual amounts will vary by the complexity of the site (as described above). Second, actual amounts will vary by what is already in place within a given jurisdiction; for instance, communities that have telecommunications infrastructure in place may not incur the expense of adding the cabling or other equipment needed to connect to the Internet for e-government. Despite the difficulties of making useful estimates, for illustration purposes we include cost estimates below based on a hypothetical, mid-size county (45,000 population) that recently released a basic Web site with the help of a private Web development and hosting company. The dollar amounts are estimates only, and costs for other jurisdictions will vary.\n\nExpertise and time for personnel, either in-house or contracted, to plan and implement an initial site, as well as to maintain and periodically revise the site. The ongoing resources needed for maintaining and securing a Web site are typically greater than those for the site's development. They include the costs of maintaining a service that people will expect to be accessible at all times. As a Web site offers more services, a local jurisdiction faces the support costs to ensure continuous 24-hour-a-day operations.\n\nIn our hypothetical example, the county contracts with a Web design firm that created the initial Web site for about $5,000. Now the county pays $5,500 a year for Web site upkeep, including posting new information and keeping the site secure. The county has a public information officer who spends about 15 percent of his time on Web-related duties, which include collecting information for the site and funneling it to the Web design company. In addition, a staff person in each of 18 county departments spends a nominal amount of time each month preparing Web site information. Ongoing expenses for the time of the public information officer and other in-house staff are estimated at $16,000 per year; this does not include the time for the initial Web site planning.\n\nResources for adding a process that parallels existing modes of delivering services. Local governments that offer services on the Web cannot drop their customary methods of distributing information and handling business. Unless a time arrives when all households have Internet access and all citizens use that mode of service delivery, jurisdictions offering e-government need to support both the digital and traditional business environments. This cost includes time for staff who have assumed additional tasks as a result of the Web site, such as processing on-line applications, at the expense of other duties. Over time, widespread use of e-government services has the potential to create efficiencies that offset some costs, but it is far less likely to ever eliminate the need for customary service delivery methods.\n\nThe ongoing expenses of maintaining Web sites are larger than the initial costs ofdeveloping a site.\n\nIn our hypothetical example, the county's Web site has shifted certain county employees' responsibilities to include responding to e-mail requests generated by Web site visitors. The county is paying for its usual ways of providing information as well as its new digital mode of Web-based information.\n\nInformation technology expenses that occur by virtue of adding a Web site, above and beyond a jurisdiction's normal costs of using computers. These could include: (1) hardware, such as a Web server and router; 3 (2) software, such as that needed to develop Web pages, create databases, or monitor Web usage; (3) security and privacy measures to protect data, users, and the Web site from internal and external threats; (4) infrastructure for connecting to the telecommunication network, such as cabling; and (5) monthly charges for telephone company connections and Internet service providers. Items such as hardware and software represent more than initial, one-time expenses because of the costs for upgrades and replacements as well as software licensing. While this report does not focus on e-mail, many jurisdictions with on-line services also have e-mail, which adds costs for hardware, software, and maintenance. As features are added to the Web site, such as viewing property tax information on-line (which requires data from a jurisdiction's own databases), technology expenses will also increase.\n\nBecause our hypothetical county relies on an external provider to host the county's Web site, the county did not incur additional costs for adding computer hardware, security, or Internet service provider charges, all of which were built into the annual fee paid to the Web hosting company. To help produce the Web pages, the county purchased two software packages for about $500, one for desktop publishing and the second for preserving printed documents as electronic images. One requires an annual licensing fee of $100 per user. The county also uses a digital camera and scanner for producing Web information, but it already owned that equipment for other purposes.\n\nTraining to develop and enhance technical expertise. Training is necessary both for the information technology staff and the front-line staff whose jobs are affected by the Web site. Especially because of the rapid pace of changing technologies, technology staff need ongoing training to stay current. In the hypothetical county, the staff person most directly involved with the Web site attends a Web-related conference at a cost of about $380 annually.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nE-government supplements, but does not replace, the customary methods of delivering services.\n\n3 Servers are computers that share their resources, such as files and printers, with other computers on a network. They may be powerful personal computers with large hard-disk capacity, minicomputers, mainframe computers, or specialized computers designed specifically as servers. Routers are specialized computers that direct and transmit bits of data from one network to another. They control the flow of messages between networks. Potential Benefits As mentioned earlier, e-government benefits tend to accrue over time as more users visit a Web site and become more comfortable using it. Further, many benefits are difficult to quantify and cannot easily be assigned a dollar value. Measuring citizen satisfaction with the Web site, for instance, is not a trivial task. As with costs, the nature and degree of the benefits will vary by the complexity of the Web site. They will also vary depending on how effectively the site is used as a communications vehicle. Web sites that are infrequently updated, for instance, may lose users' interest and stand to reap fewer benefits.\n\nIn addition, the benefits may vary depending on the characteristics of a given jurisdiction. For instance, a small city that is staffed only two days a week may be able to realize larger benefits per user for on-line city ordinances than a slightly larger city that is staffed five days a week. Without adding to staff hours, the smaller city's on-line codes provide residents with information about municipal ordinances on days when staff are not available.\n\nBenefits listed first are those more likely to be noticed by individual users and arise with even the simplest Web sites. Those listed last more directly benefit the governmental units and occur with more complex sites.\n\nExpand availability of information. Because users may access the Internet at any time of the night or day, they can retrieve information when it best fits their schedule. They are not limited to the customary 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. business hours.\n\nAdd convenience. The Web provides an easily accessible way of retrieving information from the comfort of users' own homes and offices. It provides a single access point for those who seek information provided by more than one division or department.\n\nAdd a new mode of service delivery. Web sites offer an additional way of delivering information and services that supplements the telephone, mail, and travel to a jurisdiction's headquarters. Individuals may choose the mode that works better for them.\n\nImprove the speed of delivering information or services. Using the Web site takes far less time than traveling to and parking at a government or school office or waiting for documents to arrive via the postal service.\n\nImprove timeliness and accuracy of information. Using a Web site allows the posting of up-to-date data, which is especially useful for information that changes quickly. Of course, data have to be entered accurately in the first place, but omissions and inaccuracies may often be corrected quickly on-line. On-line data may be more prone to correcting simply because they are on public view. At the same time, Web pages that are not kept current do not offer this benefit, and in fact, may be counterproductive if they offer inaccurate information.\n\nWeb sites allow citizens to receiveinformation 24 hours a day.\n\nExpose users to new information. As users visit Web sites, they are exposed to information that might not otherwise have caught their attention. For instance, a graphic display on the danger of radon in the home could attract the attention of a user who came to a site looking for the hours of the local recycling center.\n\nEnhance civic participation. The Web site can make local governments more transparent and understandable to their citizens. It has the potential to facilitate citizen involvement in local community issues, such as through on-line polling or soliciting participation on citizen task forces. Allowing citizens to interact with their local governments on-line gives them an added opportunity to participate as active members of the community. The city of Minnetonka's Web site (http://eminnetonka.com/) for example, provides opportunities for citizens to voice their opinions on city services, contact city staff or city council members, or participate in on-line polls. Greater transparency of local government can build trust between residents and local officials and enhance accountability.\n\nSave printing costs. Local governments may need to print fewer reports and other documents when files are maintained on-line.\n\nFree staff to focus on more complex requests. To the extent that Web sites provide the kinds of information most frequently requested by individuals, they allow government staff to focus on other tasks that require personal attention.\n\nTransform public services. With the Internet, local governments have the potential of fundamentally changing the ways they deliver services. For example, interactive distance learning via the Internet affords school districts an opportunity to educate nontraditional students or provide courses to remote sites. As another example, during Webcasts of board or council meetings, viewers may interact in real time by responding to issues and asking questions on-line. A third example might be social services\n\nBACKGROUND E-government can transform the way local governments deliver some services.\n\nE-government can enhance citizen involvement in local government agencies using the Web to educate their clients. Web-based licensing systems are a fourth example. An on-line guide could take restaurant managers, for instance, through a series of questions related to restaurant inspections, identifying the appropriate measures they need to take. Instead of relying exclusively on regulatory actions, local governments could offer recommended practices, thereby paving the way toward effective licensing.\n\nIntegrate data processes. The Internet could be used to integrate processes across departments, such as the processes of collecting data, providing information, and conducting business transactions. One example is collecting information for building permits on-line, integrating it with the processes of paying permit fees, and transferring relevant building information to the property assessment office. If not integrated, these separate processes require redundant data entry. When integrated, they add efficiency.\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE E-GOVERNMENT\n\nIn today's electronic world, almost anyone with a computer can have a Web site. Using Web sites effectively to facilitate e-government, however, requires thoughtful planning and execution (as is described by the best practices in Chapter 2).\n\nIn its most basic form, e-government requires the following physical components. Web sites with additional functions and services need additional devices, databases, and maintenance capabilities, such as higher levels of security. Because it is oversimplified, this list does not account for the many other types of equipment and systems needed for the Internet to operate, such as the \"domain name\" system. 4 Figure 1.2 illustrates some of the basic components.\n\nComputers and Web servers, first for developing the Web site and second for \"hosting\" it (making it available for others on the Internet). Although many local governments own Web servers, others contract with a business or another public agency to host their Web pages.\n\nSoftware for developing Web site pages and for protecting against computer viruses.\n\nFirewalls, which are devices to protect computer networks from unwelcome or unauthorized outside access.\n\nRouters to control the flow of data between computer networks.\n\nLocal goverments can improve services with e-government.\n\n4 Domain-name servers translate text, such as \"Microsoft. com,\" into computer-readable numbers that map to specific computer addresses. The domain name indicates where to forward a request for a Web page.\n\nInternet service providers (referred to as ISPs), which offer a \"point of presence\" or gateway connecting to the Internet.\n\nInternet browsers, which are software programs allowing users to navigate through files on Web sites.\n\nFigure 1.2: Basic Components Needed for Web Sites\n\nNOTE: The first set of components at top are for jurisdictions with basic Web sites hosted on their own servers. Nearly all computer systems will have additional components including computer networks, database servers, and multiple firewalls. Web sites with added features require additional components for functionality and security.\n\nSOURCE: Office of the Legislative Auditor.\n\nModem Software Telecommunications Infrastructure Internet ServiceProvider\n\nWeb Server Router Firewall\n\nUser Internet ServiceProvider\n\nAntivirusSoftware Personal Computer Internet\n\nModems, which provide a means to send digital data, typically over telephone lines, allowing communication with other computers on the Internet. 5 Infrastructure for connecting to and interacting on the Internet, such as telephone wires, cabling, or wireless systems.\n\nThe Internet and the World Wide Web, which comprise, respectively, the collection of interconnected computer networks that span the globe and the compilation of digital information accessible via the Internet.

Wireless modems convert data into radio signals for wireless transmissions.\n\nSUMMARY Local governments should get involved with e-government only after determining that they have the wherewithal to develop and, more importantly, maintain a Web site. They must think strategically about what e-government can do, decide which services are suitable, and assess their readiness for it. In the planning stage, local governments should look for partnership opportunities and explore work done by others. They have to plan how to implement and fund e-government. Security measures are essential; they should be based on a thorough assessment of security risks and tested. Local governments also need to set policies that will guide decisions on privacy, marketing, protecting sensitive data, and using the Web site to conduct business. In developing the site, local governments should focus on fulfilling users' needs and meeting their own e-government objectives. Local governments should evaluate their Web sites and be prepared to revise them periodically.\n\nThis chapter describes best practices for e-government. It lists the main goals of e-government as well as best practices and actions needed to reach those goals. The chapter also features local jurisdictions that demonstrate best practices in offering on-line services. In this chapter we ask:\n\nWhat are the primary goals of providing on-line information and services?\n\nWhat best practices are necessary to fulfill the goals of e-government for citizens? What is necessary for adequate security, integrity, and privacy of electronic data?\n\nWhat actions now used by Minnesota counties, cities, and school districts demonstrate those best practices? How feasible is it for other local governments to adopt the practices?\n\nWe based the goals and best practices on guidelines from leading organizations and agencies involved with electronic government. To validate the goals and practices, we discussed them with a technical advisory panel of 16 people involved with technology issues in counties, cities, and school districts. Appendix A provides additional information on the technical advisory panel for this project as well as the methodology we followed for the study.\n\nData reported in this chapter come from surveys on e-government we conducted in the fall of 2001 of Minnesota's 87 counties, a sample of 521 out of 854 cities, and a sample of 310 out of 345 school districts. About 90 percent of counties, 82 percent of cities, and 88 percent of school districts responded. The high number of jurisdictions responding to the survey suggests that the results fairly represent the state as a whole. The data were self reported and we did not independently verify them. The world of e-government is changing rapidly, but our survey could capture information only about a single point in time. Additional information on survey methodology is available in Appendix A, and survey results are available via the Internet at www.auditor.leg.state.mn.us/ped/2002/pe0208.htm. Information describing specific local governments and their best practices came from interviews we conducted while visiting a small number of counties, cities, and school districts. We selected the jurisdictions based on their answers to our survey questions about e-government best practices. Because we were interested in a mix of jurisdictions, we also considered size and geographic location in making the selection. The examples come from interviews in Aitkin County, Birchwood Village, Blue Earth County, Buffalo, Fergus Falls, Grand Rapids, Minneapolis School District, Pine Island School District, Plymouth, Ramsey County, Red Rock Central School District, Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan School District, and Stearns County. In instances where we mention examples of specific products during the course of describing best practices, we do not mean to imply endorsement of the products.\n\nGOALS Successful e-government should aim to meet three primary goals: Improve the quality, cost, accessibility, and speed of delivering government information and services. 1\n\nMake government more accountable by increasing the opportunity for citizen participation in the governance process and bringing citizens closer to elected officials and public servants.\n\nOrganize the production and distribution of public information and services in new ways, that is, to transform government services to meet citizens' needs in an automated world.\n\n1 Council for Excellence in Government, E-Government: The Next American Revolution (Washington, D.C.: Council for Excellence in Government, 2001), 4, 36. 2 Ibid., 36. 3 Harvard Policy Group on Network-Enabled Services and Government, Eight Imperatives for Leaders in a Networked World (Cambridge, MA: John F.

View on-line at http://www.ksg.harvard.edu/stratcom/hpg/.\n\nBEST PRACTICES AND ACTIONS FOR E-GOVERNMENT Seven best practices are necessary for effective e-government. Local governments that fail to consider all of these best practices may not reap the benefits of effective Web sites and run the risk of posting Web sites that are counterproductive. The best practices are cyclic in nature because e-government is not a discrete, one-time initiative. As shown in Figure 2.1, the seven best practices are:\n\n1. Assess whether to offer e-government\n\n2. Assess opportunities for collaboration\n\n3. Prepare to execute and fund e-government\n\n4. Provide security\n\n5. Set a policy framework to guide e-government\n\n6. Make the Web site function optimally\n\n7. Evaluate e-government\n\nThe following text defines these seven best practices and describes what actions a government should take in fulfilling each practice. Although listed in numerical order, many of the best practices and their related actions need to be done simultaneously, not sequentially. The section below also provides examples of local jurisdictions that have put the actions into use. By featuring these examples, we do not mean to imply that these local governments have the most visually impressive Web sites or that they are the only jurisdictions using the best practices. Rather, we want to illustrate how, even in the relatively new era of electronic services, some local governments have embodied the best practices related to e-government.\n\n1. Assess Whether to Offer E-Government Before deciding to proceed with e-government, jurisdictions should establish their vision for how e-government will work and serve citizens. To prepare for the decision, they should assess what resources they have available and what they would need.\n\nRECOMMENDATION In preparation for e-government, local governments should set strategic goals and objectives and determine whether they have the technology, skills, and funding for e-government over the long term. Local governments need a central authority for managing e-government, and they should align their effort with identified needs of those likely to use their Web site.\n\nBEST PRACTICES IN LOCAL E-GOVERNMENT\n\nEffective e-government requires seven best practices.\n\nFigure 2.1: Best Practices and Actions Needed for Successful Local E-Government\n\nNOTE: Although shown in numerical order, many of the best practices should be done simultaneously, not sequentially.\n\nSOURCE: Office of the Legislative Auditor.\n\n2. Assess Opportunities for Collaboration 3. Prepare to Execute and Fund E-Government\n\n4. Provide Security 5. Set a Policy Framework to Guide E-Government\n\n7. Evaluate E-Government 1. Assess Whether to Offer E-Government In planning, evaluate others' Web sites Participate in intergovernmental networks of e-government professionals Explore partnerships on e-government with other public or private agencies\n\nEvaluate how well the Web site is meeting e-government goals\n\nRevise Web site based on evaluation results and other feedback\n\nThink strategically about e-government Determine which services are suitable for on-line delivery Assess the government's readiness for e-government\n\nInvolve top officials and all participating departments Engage the public and determine whether public access to Internet is adequate\n\nState the purpose of a Web site for providing local government services Establish policies on public access to on-line records and on data archiving Establish privacy policy Determine marketing strategy\n\nDetermine adequacy of access to Web site Review and update e-government policies\n\nDesign the Web site to fulfill user needs and meet e-government objectives Follow industry guidelines for site presentation and content\n\nTest the site before public release Plan for ongoing site maintenance\n\n6. Make the Web Site Function Optimally Prepare plans to implement e-government Identify the needed dollars, people, and technology and analyze their full costs Develop funding strategy Assign responsibility for e-government Conduct a risk assessment and write policy based on it Install current security software and monitor the site Develop incident-response and disaster-recovery procedures Actively manage employee access to data and Web site Test adequacy of security measures and provide for outside assessment\n\nThink Strategically About E-Government Thinking strategically means a local government asks itself what it envisions e-government could do. In strategic plans, the jurisdiction should define its vision for how e-government will work and serve citizens. 4 Such plans force a local government to consider how it can use the Web site strategically to accomplish its goals. The plans should contain the government's objectives for e-government, which will subsequently guide the design, implementation, and management of the Web site. Throughout the strategic planning, a local government should consider the needs of its potential Web-site users. Over time, the strategic plan will need updating because e-government is a cyclic, ongoing process. Strategic planning paves the way for setting performance measures, which are important for determining later whether the Web site is meeting its goals. 5 Measuring things such as timesaving for personnel, waiting times for customers, and user satisfaction, help a local government track whether e-government is providing better, cheaper, or faster services. Using performance measures is part of the evaluation process described later in this chapter.\n\nIn our survey, few local governments reported having written strategic plans that include plans for e-government. We found that:\n\nOf the local governments that provided on-line information or services, 40 percent of school districts, 10 percent of counties, and 8 percent of cities, had written strategic plans covering e-government. An additional 23 percent of jurisdictions indicated they had plans for e-government, but they were unwritten.\n\nAs an example of strategic planning, the Pine Island School District, a district of 1,200 students in Goodhue County, has prepared and updated a \"Technology Integration Plan,\" which includes the district's goals for its Web site. (The Technology Plan is a requirement to be eligible for state and federal technology grants.) According to the plan, one of the district's goals is to have a Web site that provides information on daily announcements, academic and sports activities, and daily assignments. Further, the district envisions using technology to increase parental involvement. It specifically addresses the need for parents to be able to communicate electronically with teachers and the administration. The district also lays out the objectives it hopes to achieve with the Web site. For instance, the district wants the community to be able to obtain up-to-date information and students to be able\n\nA local government's e-government objectives should guide Web site development.\n\n4 National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, E-Government Strategic Planning from the NECCC Symposium 2000 held in Las Vegas December 13, 2000 (Washington, D.C.: National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and Treasurers), 20, (available on-line at http://www.ec3.org/InfoCenter/ 12_Conference_Information/2000_Conference/Documents_Released _in_Vegas/Planning_Document.doc); John O'Looney, Local Government On-Line: Putting the Internet to Work (Washington, D.C.: International City County Management Association, 2000), 7-8. 5 Center for Technology in Government, Developing and Delivering Government Services on the World Wide Web (Albany, NY: Center for Technology in Government, 1996), 32.

Not every bit of local government information, nor every locally provided service, can or should be provided via the Internet. When considering suitability, local governments should think how the Web site could improve delivery of both existing and new services. 6 Consequently, one of the first steps a local government must take is to answer what it wants to deliver over the Web, to fulfill which audience needs, and for what purpose. 7 As mentioned in Chapter 1, local governments that opt to offer services on-line still have an obligation to deliver services using their customary methods of delivery. All of the strategic planning should relate e-government to the jurisdiction's core services so that e-government supports the government's fundamental functions. 8 Offering e-government simply because the technology is available ignores the need to be cost-effective and can lead to poorly thought-out uses.\n\nGrand Rapids is an example of a city that studied what information and services would best meet its Web-site users' needs. For the initial planning of the Web site, a committee of city staff was convened with membership from each department. Among other things, the Web committee developed a mission statement for a Web site, laid out a plan for implementation, and identified a list of the likely audiences that would use a Grand Rapids site. With city council approval to continue the Web work, the committee sent a survey to all city department heads, asking about questions they typically fielded from citizens. Based on what it knew about likely audiences and commonly asked questions, the committee developed a directory of city services to be provided via the Web. The services include applying for permits related to zoning, burning, or utility cuts; issuing dog licenses; registering for golf passes and tee times; making park reservations; and using library services. Knowing that the city could not implement all the desired on-line services at one time, Grand Rapids is instead bringing the services on-line incrementally as time and resources allow, following the plan developed by the Web committee. For more information, contact Marilyn Isaac, IT System Administrator, at misaac@ci.grand-rapids.mn.us or 218/326-7620.\n\nE-government should support a jurisdiction's fundamental functions.\n\n6 Center for Technology in Government, A WWW Starter Kit (Albany, NY: Center for Technology in Government, 2000), 1.

Raumer, \"Strategic Planning for Technology Investments,\" Government Finance Review (December 2001), 32-35. National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, E-Government Strategic Planning, 12. Assess the Government's Readiness for E-Government Before deciding whether to embark on e-government, local governments should determine how ready they are to do so. 9 Assessing readiness means asking what will be needed to offer e-government and determining the jurisdiction's current capacities to fill those needs. Understanding the true costs of a Web site is important because, as described in Chapter 1, measuring its benefits is difficult, which prevents jurisdictions from quantifying a return on their e-government investment. Perhaps the three most obvious items to assess are (1) whether the jurisdiction has access to the necessary hardware and telecommunications equipment, (2) how available staff or outside experts are and what their competencies are in planning and maintaining e-government, and (3) what funding is available to pay for the needed equipment, staff, and training. Staff competencies include not only technological skills, but also administrative skills, such as those needed for good contract management. To the extent jurisdictions rely on vendors for Web-site development or maintenance, they need contract management procedures, such as examining vendors' financial statements for financial stability, requiring performance bonds, or designing an exit strategy in case the vendor fails to perform as expected. 10 This is necessary to protect local governments against substantial losses should vendors go out of business or fail to meet expectations.\n\nPerhaps less obvious, local governments should also assess their readiness in terms of adequate leadership support. A jurisdiction's leaders must support the e-government effort in order for it to succeed, as discussed more below. Further, local governments should consider their legal readiness. That is, they need the capacity to resolve legal issues, such as: what electronic data need protection because of their nonpublic nature; whether to enforce ownership rights (copyrights) of information published on the Web; and under what circumstances the Web space will be available for commercial advertising. Combined with strategic planning, assessing readiness in these areas prepares governments to decide whether to proceed with e-government. They should proceed with planning only if these initial analyses suggest the jurisdiction has the wherewithal to continue.\n\nWe found that: Most local governments reported assessing their readiness for e-government in certain areas before implementing e-government.\n\nAccording to our survey, 74 percent of counties, cities, and school districts that provided on-line services had assessed the availability of computers and other technical equipment; 73 percent had assessed their own staff competencies to plan and maintain the Web site; and 66 percent had assessed their ability to fund equipment and staff. Fewer governments assessed their readiness by appraising the leadership support that would be needed, their ability to articulate citizen expectations for e-government, and their capacity for dealing with legal issues. Table 2.1 shows the number of local governments that assessed their readiness for these factors.\n\nLocal governments should ask whether they are ready for e-government.\n\n9 National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, E-Government Strategic Planning, 20. 10 Public Technology, Inc., Local Government Checklist for Developing a Partnership With an E-Government Vendor (Washington, D.C.: PTI, June 2000), 3.\n\nInvolve Top Officials and All Participating Departments for an Enterprise-Wide Effort Local governments need support from top-level administrators and elected officials for planning e-government. This is important in order to set clear objectives for use of a Web site and to reach agreement on the funding and staffing for it. 11 Support of top officials also sets direction that brings other staff on board. A study of local Web site managers indicated that they believe one of the key factors in successfully developing and launching Web sites is obtaining support from top officials. 12 As part of the planning process, staff may need to inform elected officials about how e-government can be useful locally. The point at which elected officials are involved will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some cases, a mayor or board member might actually instigate e-government efforts; in others, elected officials might be consulted only after an initial proposal is under consideration.\n\nMost local governments comprise numerous departments, each with varying levels of interest in e-government. Successful Web sites, however, require coordination among these multiple departments. 13 Although not every department may be involved to the same degree, a strong network of staff involvement is needed to develop a comprehensive and cohesive Web site that accurately reflects the public services each department provides. Even in small jurisdictions where one person is responsible for Web design and maintenance, input on content needs to come from others to avoid an incomplete or disjointed result. According to our survey, More counties and cities than school districts reported they were successful in seeking support for e-government from their top elected and administrative officials. About 71 percent of counties, 82 percent of cities, and 48 percent of school districts indicated they were either \"successful\" or \"somewhat successful\" in seeking top-level support. A relatively large share of school districts, 38 percent, reported that they have not attempted to seek such support.\n\nTable 2.1: Areas in Which Jurisdictions Assessed Readiness for E-Government, 2001 All Jurisdictions Counties Cities School Districts (N= 339) (N= 49) (N= 123) (N= 167) Readiness Assessed # % # % # % # % Availability of computers and equipment 251 74% 35 71% 80 65% 136 81%\n\nStaff competency 248 73 33 67 85 69 130 78 Funding for equipment and staff 225 66 30 61 80 65 115 69 Legal issues 169 50 26 53 39 32 104 62 Leadership support 143 42 20 41 46 37 77 42 Ability to assess citizen expectations 97 29 14 29 36 29 47 28\n\nNOTE: The question read: \"Before implementing e-government, did your [jurisdiction] assess its readiness for e-government in any of the following areas?\" SOURCE: Office of the Legislative Auditor, Survey of Counties, Cities, and School Districts, October 2001.\n\nObtaining support from top officials is key.\n\n11 International City County Management Association, \"Local Government and the Internet,\" Management Information Service Report 28, no. 9 (September 1996): 2. 12 Center for Technology in Government, Untangle the Web: Delivering Municipal Services Through the Internet (Albany: Center for Technology in Government, 2001), 2.

Sixty-three percent of counties, 49 percent of cities, and 44 percent of school districts indicated they were either \"successful\" or \"somewhat successful\" in coordinating staff from different departments for e-government. Aitkin County, with 15,300 residents near north central Minnesota, uses a Web committee with members representing most county departments to coordinate its Web-related activities. Originally the committee was formed to decide what the community at large might need from a county Web site. Now the committee also ensures the site is updated, reviews ideas for adding new functions to the site (such as putting the property tax database on-line), and occasionally evaluates the site by reviewing other county sites. All county departments are invited to participate in the Web committee's monthly meetings (although active members may vary from meeting to meeting). Support for the Web site from the county administrator has encouraged department involvement.\n\nTo promote a consistent look on the Web site, the county's department of Management Information Systems controls the overall Web design, but committee members from each department decide the content for their pages, based on what they know from community members' inquiries and requests. Department representatives may choose to either use the county's Web design software or forward their material to the Web master who converts it. The Web committee has been instrumental in keeping the various departments involved without overburdening them. For a relatively small county like Aitkin, the committee is a vehicle for maintaining a coordinated Web site without hiring a staff person dedicated solely to that purpose. For more information, contact Steve Bennett, Management Information Systems Coordinator, at sbennett@co.aitkin.mn.us or 218/927-7373 or Cindy Bistodeau, Web Master, at mis@co.aitkin.mn.us, or 218/927-7345.\n\nJurisdictions with multiple departments need to coordinate staff involvement for cohesive Web sites.\n\nEngage the Public and Determine Whether Public Access to the Internet Is Adequate Focusing on organizational needs is only one part of strategic planning and assessing readiness for e-government. Equally important, local governments should identify the potential consumers of e-government and gather input from them to understand what likely users will need and want from the Web site. 14 Doing this from the beginning will help in defining the purpose and objectives of an e-government effort. Successful e-government is measured in part by how many people use the Web site over time. To attract users and keep them coming back, local governments have to continually think about what makes sense from users' vantage points. At the same time, they should take care to avoid creating expectations for electronic services that cannot be fulfilled.\n\nAccording to our survey, About 48 percent of all the local jurisdictions offering e-government reported that they believe their jurisdiction was either \"successful\" or \"somewhat successful\" in identifying potential users' needs and desires, enabling them to orient their Web site around citizens.\n\nAs part of looking at \"customer readiness,\" the local government should assess whether it needs to take steps to widen public access to the Internet, such as increasing the availability of computer terminals in libraries or other public locations. 15 Ensuring that citizens have sufficient access to computers and the Internet is not ordinarily a local government responsibility. Jurisdictions that would like to use their Web pages as major communication vehicles, however, have to consider in their strategic planning the extent of citizen access to the Internet.\n\nOnly about a quarter of the local governments we surveyed said they had written strategic plans for e-government. But we learned that: Of those local governments with strategic plans for e-government, 44 percent said their plans considered how citizens might gain access to their Web site. In building a Web site for Buffalo, a city of 10,000 residents located in Wright County, city staff collected information about potential users in several ways. One was a survey of city residents. Staff mailed a survey to a sample of citizens asking them about services they would like to find on the city's Web site. They learned that many citizens wanted on-line information about applications for services such as zoning permits. Second, staff developed a list of the questions most frequently called or faxed in to the city office's front desk. A third method was working individually with each of the city department heads to identify what information they thought would be of most use on-line. One criterion was putting on the Web the kinds of information that would allow department staff to focus their time on other issues that demanded personal attention. A second was stressing the quality of the on-line information as opposed to its volume.\n\nWeb sites should meet the needs of likely users.\n\n14 National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, E-Government Strategic Planning, 21; O'Looney, Local Government On-Line: Putting the Internet to Work, 27. 15 Public Technology, Inc. and National League of Cities, E-Government: City Hall Without Walls (Washington, D.C.: Public Technology Inc., 2000), 7. View on-line at www.pti.org/links/PTI_NLC_egovkit.doc.\n\nWith a direct e-mail link on the Web site to the information systems coordinator, the city invites users to provide their ideas for the site or describe difficulties they may have encountered. Since the Web site has been launched, information systems staff set time aside each month to examine in depth one segment of the site, looking for accuracy, timeliness, and possible additions. In addition, the city council was concerned about Internet access for residents who did not own computers. Using a $10,000 donation from a local business, the city installed three computers in the library and ran a fiber connection to the library building, providing on-line access. The city also installed a computer kiosk in city hall offering visitors on-line access to city information.

The Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan School District 196, located in Dakota County with 27,000 students, offers another example of developing a Web site with community members in mind. Although the district has had a Web site since 1996, its earlier sites gave the district a Web presence but lacked the perspective of users. To revamp the site, in 2001 the district convened a five-member staff group consisting of some technology and graphics experts and others with expertise in communications and public administration. Based on the objectives of the school board and superintendent, the planning group's intent was to orient the site around information that parents commonly needed. The planning group used several sources of information. From e-mails and telephone calls generated by earlier Web users, the planning group had a good idea of what information those users wanted and what they could not find on the old sites, such as student eligibility for bus service. The communications department knew from numerous telephone callers the kind of information people moving into the district typically requested. In addition, members of the school board offered input; they wanted a site that would keep district residents better informed and offer a means for residents to respond on district issues. The planning group also used software tools to monitor search engine queries for frequent searches and look at which Web pages were most heavily visited. Information from these various sources, combined with information from other jurisdictions' Web sites that the planning group had analyzed, gave staff the direction they needed to redesign the content of the district's site.

Some local governments have broadened public access to the Internet.\n\n2. Assess Opportunities for Collaboration Especially because e-government is still an evolving means of public service, there is great value in working with others and learning about what works from others. Local governments need not rely only on their own resources to build effective Web sites.\n\nRECOMMENDATION To benefit from others' expertise and to share resources, local governments considering e-government should evaluate others' Web sites, learn from other local governments' staff experiences, and explore formal partnerships for e-government.\n\nIn Planning for E-Government, Evaluate Web Sites of Other Local Governments Both newcomers and those with well-established Web sites can observe and learn from what others have done. By evaluating other governments' Web sites, a jurisdiction can judge what works well, and what does not work well, and decide what features to adapt for its own uses. 16 Governments should structure questions to ask about each site they evaluate, such as: Does the local unit appear to know who its primary users are? Can users easily contact the jurisdiction? How easy is it to navigate around the site? How useful is the information provided on the site? Is the site one that users are likely to revisit? Most of the 12 local governments we visited for this study indicated they took time to research and analyze other entities' Web sites before designing their own.\n\nLocal governments can also learn from organizations that have studied and compared Web sites. For example, an annual Brown University study assesses city Web sites based on the presence of 28 features that could aid average citizens logging onto a government site, including: contact information on who to call or write at the city, availability of search engines to make sites searchable, features to facilitate access by the handicapped and non-English speaking users, and statements to reassure citizens worried about privacy and security over the Internet. 17 The National Association of Counties has information about planning Web sites, including links to multiple resources and electronic discussion groups for staff working on Web sites. 18 As another example, in the past two years, the Center for Digital Government joined with Government Technology magazine to judge \"Best of the Web\" local government Web sites. Among other criteria, the center judged sites based on: amount of on-line information available, ability to fully complete transactions on-line, time saved for citizens, ease of navigation, and innovation in delivering services to citizens. 19 Minnesota jurisdictions also have local resources available. These resources have done much of the legwork needed to initiate a Web presence. They offer products that local governments can use to both reduce costs and simplify the Web design process. As one example, in 2001, the League of Minnesota Cities launched a \"Web for Cities\" project, a tool designed to help cities build and maintain Web sites. 20 The tool provides a template for Web sites and it is intended to allow cities with computers and Internet connections to create their own sites, even without programming or Web design expertise. To use it, cities up to 60,000 in population pay one-time licensing fees ranging from $200 to $2,000 depending on size and monthly maintenance charges ranging from $20 to $80.\n\nLocal governments can learn from others' Web sites.\n\n16 Center for Technology in Government, Untangle the Web, 4.\n\nAnother resource compiled on behalf of Minnesota local governments is the University of Minnesota Extension Service's \"Access E-Government\" curriculum. 21 In partnership with the Association of Minnesota Counties, the Extension Service developed the curriculum in 2001 to describe what local governments need to consider when offering e-government. The curriculum covers criteria for judging Web sites, suggestions on Web site content and design, discussions of privacy and disability issues, and numerous links to additional resources.\n\nA third example is a Web page tool for teachers, developed by Technology and Information Educational Services (TIES), a nonprofit consortium of Minnesota school districts focusing on technology. 22 The tool offers a template allowing teachers to create their own Web pages and communicate with parents and students without having Web design training. TIES members pay nothing extra for the service. Even teachers who are in districts that are not TIES members may use the tool for a fixed cost of $50 per year or $2.50 per student per year if all teachers in a school or district want their own pages.\n\nWeb site templates can reduce development costs.\n\n17 Darrell West, Urban E-Government: An Assessment of City Government Websites (Providence, RI: Brown University, Taubman Center for Public Policy, September 2001), 2-3.

Birchwood Village has fewer than 1,000 residents and employs two office staff working 10 to 20 hours a week. Because of its limited staff hours, the city wanted a Web site to provide information for residents when staff were unavailable. City staff did not have Web development expertise, but using the \"Web for Cities\" templates, they put together a Web site with minimal training. Working with the mayor, staff planned in advance what information the city wanted to display (such as the city's code book), making it easier for staff to pull together material for the site's content. Other cost estimates the city had received for developing and maintaining a Web site were higher than what the city could afford, but Birchwood Village is paying a manageable $360 per year hosting fee for its current site. Although the \"Web for Cities\" tool does not currently have all the functions that Birchwood Village would like, the city believes it would not otherwise have a Web presence. The same approach, however, may not be as desirable for larger communities with needs for highly customized Web sites. For more information, contact Jackie Hildebrand, Deputy Clerk, at bwood@spacestar.net or 651/426-3403.\n\nParticipate in Intergovernmental Networks of E-Government Professionals Staff who have responsibilities for e-government should take part in electronic discussion groups or other associations of e-government professionals, both Internet-wide and more locally within the state. Such networks offer a vehicle for sharing information, discussing common problems, learning what to avoid, and staying current on topics that change rapidly, such as security issues in information technology. 23 For instance, the League of Minnesota Cities offers \"listservs,\" or electronic discussion groups, including two focused on computer security and telecommunications. 24 We also learned about networking groups of local government staff around the state. One example is the Western Area City County Cooperative in west central Minnesota. This cooperative serves many functions beyond technology, but it also allows members with similar technology interests to jointly discuss issues of concern, such as how to collect payments via the Internet. Numerous resources like this around the country provide opportunities for local governments to avoid \"reinventing the wheel\" by capitalizing on what others have learned. 25\n\nThe template allowed city staff to post a Web site with minimal training and expense.\n\nExplore Partnerships on E-Government With Other Public or Private Agencies\n\nIn the early stages of the planning effort, local governments should explore whether resources can be shared for planning e-government and implementing or maintaining the Web site. Joining in partnership with other local governments may offer opportunities to reduce costs for technology and personnel. 26 For example, in exchange for other services, some jurisdictions just starting their Web presence have hosted their sites using Web servers owned by nearby jurisdictions. Partnerships between cities and school districts or counties and cities may also help build regional alliances that bridge traditional local government boundaries. 27 In addition, working with private agencies can provide necessary expertise that a government need not develop on its own, such as subscribing to an on-line check processing service to accept electronic payments. At the same time, partnerships and contract arrangements may require a give-and-take approach among participants. When working jointly with others, local governments need to be aware that the different decision-making structures and organizational arrangements of other jurisdictions will likely require additional time for planning and meeting. It will be important to define up front the objectives for the partnership and each participant's roles and expectations. To the extent that substantial resources are shared, or when local governments contract for particular services, formal agreements detailing the arrangements are necessary. This underscores the need for good contract-management procedures, as described above. Our survey suggested that local governments, especially school districts and counties, were more likely to work independently than in partnerships on e-government. Majorities of school districts and counties reported working independently on e-government in any of three phases from planning, to implementing, to maintaining e-government. For instance, 64 percent of school districts had worked independently during the planning of e-government, compared with 56 percent of counties, and 44 percent of cities. At the same time, between 37 and 49 percent of local governments reported working with others while either planning, implementing, or maintaining e-government. Some of the partnerships were with public agencies, some were with private-sector partners, and some were with both.\n\nPartnerships offer opportunities to share resources.\n\n23 Harvard Policy Group on Network-Enabled Services and Government, Eight Imperatives for Leaders in a Networked World Imperative 5: Protect Privacy and Security (Cambridge, MA: Kennedy School of Government, 2001), 6. 24 Information on the League's listservs is at www.lmnc.org/forms/listserv. cfm.

Fewer such partnerships were reported for maintaining e-government on an ongoing basis.\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nCounties Cities School Districts\n\nFigure 2. 2: Partnerships With Public Entities for E-Government, 2001\n\nPercentage of Jurisdictions\n\nNOTES: The question read: \"In undertaking e-government, did your [jurisdiction] work independently or with others?\" \"Public entities\" includes counties, cities, school districts, local libraries, community colleges, technical colleges, and universities.

About 34 percent of jurisdictions reported working in partnerships with businesses, consultants, or nonprofits in the planning phase of e-government, 36 percent in the implementing phase, and 25 percent in the maintaining phase of e-government. Some of these jurisdictions also had partnerships with other public entities at the same time.\n\nStearns County provides an example of a working partnership with the city of St. Cloud and the St. Cloud School District. Each entity wanted a tool to allow on-line payments through its Web site. The three jurisdictions had previous experience working together on joint projects, such as a file server shared between the city and school district, and technology solutions for a law enforcement center operated jointly between the county and city. The technology directors of the three jurisdictions reviewed vendors' proposals for payment engines and jointly chose one that met each one's needs. In so doing, their combined purchasing power lowered their overall costs; the vendor was eager to negotiate with them knowing that multiple customers were involved. Because of the partnership, Stearns County received on-line payment technology and a property tax payment application for $5,000 less than it would have otherwise paid on the first year of its three-year vendor agreement. Similarly, St. Cloud saved about $5,000 in its first year of implementing a mechanism for on-line utility payments. While effective partnerships are possible for other jurisdictions, the success of this partnership was due in part to previous working relationships the participants had established. For more information, contact George McClure, Information Services Director, at george. mcclure@co.stearns.mn.us or 320/656-6051.\n\nIn another example, the Red Rock Central School District in Redwood County developed partnerships to provide the telecommunications infrastructure needed for e-government services. The Red Rock Central School District has a small student body, but the 600 students are widely dispersed geographically due to past consolidations of four school districts. The school district wanted a way to connect residents of its five dispersed communities to the district's Web server in Lamberton, but no private firm was offering Internet access and support in the area. Teaming up with a local farmers' grain cooperative that provided financial backing, the school district developed a wireless, high-speed Internet access network. The farming cooperative also provided space on its grain elevators to locate the wireless Internet transmitters; because the elevator silos were the highest structures around the area, they proved useful for transmitting signals. In exchange, the cooperative received technical support and high-speed Internet access connecting its remote office locations around the county. The Storden City Council also participated by providing an Internet access site at the Senior Citizen Center. The Red Rock Central partnership worked because a large group of community members was committed to its success, and the school district had employees and students with the technical expertise to guide the project along. For more information, contact Leonard Runck, Red Rock Central Net System Administrator, at runckl@rrcnet.org or 507/752-7361.\n\nThe partnership allowed the school district to mount wireless Internet transmitters on the cooperative's grain elevators.\n\nA partnership's combined purchasing power can lower overall costs.\n\n3. Prepare to Execute and Fund E-Government Once the decision to offer e-government is made, a jurisdiction has to prepare itself to develop and fund it.\n\nRECOMMENDATION To prepare for e-government, local governments should develop an implementation plan, analyze the full costs of e-government, and plan a funding strategy to pay for the needed people and technology.\n\nPrepare Plans to Implement E-Government In contrast with strategic plans that lay out a vision for what should be done, implementation planning describes what actually will be done. 29 An implementation plan is important because e-government affords many opportunities, but not all can be accomplished at the same time. With implementation plans, local governments set priorities for their e-government projects.\n\nTo plan implementation, local governments should document the steps they need to undertake. For instance, a city may decide it wants to first use its Web site to provide basic information about the city's organization and services. It wants to progress to having users participate in on-line polls that may help set priorities among certain pending projects. Eventually, it wants to use the Web to allow on-line registrations for parks and recreation programs. Each of these steps should be laid out in a schedule that shows the order in which they will be done. The implementation plans should include an economic analysis of the different initiatives' costs over a specific time horizon. In these plans, the costs would be more specific than those estimated during strategic planning. To be complete, costs must take into account equipment purchases, staffing resources, and needs for outside expertise, and they should include both initial and recurring costs. Along with costs, the plans should propose funding sources to detail what revenues will be used to pay for the initiatives.\n\nImplementing e-government requires planning.\n\n29 National Electronic Commerce Coordinating Council, E-Government Strategic Planning, 21-22. In addition to costs and funding, the implementation plans should describe how the initiatives are expected to change the entity's processes for delivering services. In most cases, a jurisdiction cannot simply drop its customary way of providing a service. For instance, a city that offers parks registrations on-line has to decide which staff person has the duty to respond to on-line registrations and how to coordinate these registrations with those phoned or mailed. Therefore, implementation planning should consider how to integrate new ways of doing business in parallel with current methods. It should determine how the government may have to modify or reengineer existing business processes for electronic delivery, as well as the costs for doing so.\n\nImplementation plans should also discuss marketing plans and customer relations. As discussed more below, although some may view marketing as less important, e-government will not succeed if citizens are not aware of it. Potential users must also be comfortable using the Web site, which requires local governments to plan for customer-relations activities. Such planning will detail what activities are necessary to respond to users' questions and problems. As discussed in greater detail later in this chapter, part of implementing Web sites involves testing them before their release.\n\nOf those offering e-government in the fall of 2001, Only a small number of local governments reported that they had written plans for implementing e-government once they decided to proceed. About 26 percent of school districts, 11 percent of cities, and 6 percent of counties replied that they had developed such written plans. About half of school districts and counties, and 43 percent of cities, indicated they planned implementation of e-government but had not documented the plans. The remaining jurisdictions had not specifically developed plans for how they would implement e-government. Table 2.2 illustrates the extent to which local governments planned implementation.\n\nTable 2.2: Local Governments That Planned for E-Government Implementation, 2001 All Jurisdictions Counties Cities School Districts (N= 335) (N= 48) (N= 123) (N= 164) # % # % # % # % Yes, we had written plans 58 17% 3 6% 13 11% 42 26%\n\nWe planned, but did not write it down 160 48 24 50 53 43 83 51 We did not plan implementation 117 35 21 44 57 46 39 24\n\nNOTE: The question read: \"Did your [jurisdiction] plan how it would implement e-government, once it decided to proceed?\" SOURCE: Office of the Legislative Auditor, Survey of Counties, Cities, and School Districts, October 2001.\n\nStearns County planned a systematic approach to implementing its Web site. County staff researched effective Web sites, consulted with experts, formulated a plan, and prepared a strategy for communicating with county board members. The county's Web implementation plan contained a list of the features and services staff envisioned for the site, a timeline for implementing different phases of Web services, and projected costs for implementation. Through a series of six presentations to the county board over about 18 months, staff discussed objectives for the Web site and what was needed to achieve them. After receiving board input, staff implemented various features of the Web site during this time. At each successive meeting with the board, staff demonstrated the progress that had been made and solicited board members' feedback. With this measured approach, staff engaged the support of elected county officials and have been able to implement improvements to the site over time as outlined in the plan. For more information, contact George McClure, Information Services Director, at george. mcclure@co.stearns.mn. us or 320/656-6051.\n\nIdentify the Needed Dollars, People, and Technology and Analyze Their Present and Future Costs\n\nAs mentioned above, implementation plans for e-government should assess what resources (dollars, people, and equipment) the government will need to build and operate an effective Web site. Some researchers have estimated that the ongoing maintenance and operations costs of electronic business projects through their life cycles can be from 40 to 60 percent of their initial implementation costs per year. 30 Therefore, when estimating costs, local governments should examine the full life cycle of the expenses to understand their total costs. This gives them the information needed to help make wise investments. 31\n\nAlso known as recognizing the \"total costs of ownership,\" the concept requires analyzing, not just an item's initial purchase price, but also its costs for maintenance, energy usage, and disposal over its expected life span. For instance, in considering computer application software, a local government should include upfront purchase price, the user support needed to make the program usable, ongoing licensing costs, likely updates needed to keep the software functional, and whether it has resale or reuse value. When considering staffing, local governments should include the cost of not just salaries and benefits, but also training, recruitment, and hiring. Table 2.3 lists items for which jurisdictions planning e-government should consider total costs of ownership.\n\nAccording to our survey, Although the use of life-cycle costs was not common, local governments most frequently reported analyzing life-cycle costs when estimating costs for specific items, such as contracts with Internet service providers.\n\nLocal governments need to understand the full costs of e-government, not just the initial expenses.\n\n30 Barb Gomolski, \"The Cost of e-Business,\" InfoWorld (December 10, 2001), 12. 31 Information Technology Resources Board, \"Practical Strategies for Managing Information Systems,\" 2001; http://www.itrb.gov/; accessed August 27, 2001. Other items for which life-cycle costs were estimated included ongoing maintenance and software upgrades, hardware and software, and staff time needed for maintaining the Web site. School districts were more likely to report using life-cycle costs than either cities or counties. This may be in part because the techn"
