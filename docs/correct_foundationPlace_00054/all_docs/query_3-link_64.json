        "text": "Download BIC-to-LEI Relationship Files\n\nI herewith confirm that I read, understood and accepted the privacy policy. I hereby confirm that data which I typed and clicked might be sent to social network owners and saved and electronically processed by them.\n\nIn February 2018, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and SWIFT introduced the first open source relationship file that matches a Business Identifier Code (BIC) assigned to an organization against its Legal Entity Identifier (LEI).\n\nThe BIC (ISO 9362) is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for the identification of institutions within the financial services industry. SWIFT is the registration authority for the BIC standard appointed by ISO. In this role, SWIFT receives BIC registration requests, assigns a BIC, and publishes the related BIC data record.\n\nThe BIC-to-LEI relationship file is built upon a mapping process established by SWIFT and certified by GLEIF. It is published in CSV format and will be updated on a monthly basis. Please note that opening the CSV format file directly in the Microsoft Excel tool may produce some errors in the LEI codes. Please refer to the ‘CSV Import Guide’ available for download at the foot of this page.\n\nWith the launch of this open source file, GLEIF and SWIFT have pioneered a cooperation model that, for the first time, enables market participants to link and cross-reference these key entity identifiers free of charge.\n\nAvailability of the open source BIC-to-LEI relationship file will ease the process of gathering, aggregating and reconciling counterparty information based on interoperability across parallel ID platforms. This is particularly relevant to service providers active in the payments and over the counter (OTC) derivatives markets concerned with client relationship management, or due diligence relevant to know your customer (KYC) and know your supplier (KYS).\n\nThe open source BIC-to-LEI relationship file is an important step towards consolidating information. This will significantly reduce the cost associated with entity verification to date.\n\nFor further information on the BIC-to-LEI relationship files, as well as the cooperation between GLEIF and SWIFT, please refer to the factsheet and please take note of the license agreement available for download at the foot of this page.\n\nThe free of charge GLEIF Certification of LEI Mapping service ensures that organizations which map the LEI to their own identifiers use state of the art methodologies and / or processes to do so accurately.\n\nDate File June 2024 LEI-BIC-20240628.zip May 2024 LEI-BIC-20240524.zip April 2024 LEI-BIC-20240426.zip March 2024 LEI-BIC-20240329.zip February 2024 LEI-BIC-20240223.zip January 2024 LEI-BIC-20240126.zip December 2023 LEI-BIC-20231229.zip November 2023 LEI-BIC-20231124.zip October 2023 LEI-BIC-20231027.zip September 2023 LEI-BIC-20230929.zip August 2023 LEI-BIC-20230825.zip July 2023 LEI-BIC-20230728.zip\n\nRelevant Files for Download"
