        "text": "Robert J. Paradiso, partner and Chair of Lowenstein’s Life Sciences and Chemical Patent Practice, comments in IAM that AI will “revolutionize many applications in the life sciences industry,” from initial research and identification of candidates to regulatory approval and marketing.\n\n“The application of AI technology … will also provide enhanced opportunities in the development of intellectual property,” Paradiso says. “Patent-eligible subject matter will likely be available for new molecular entities, clinical trial results and post-marketing analysis, as well as other stages in the developmental and regulatory processes,” he continues, adding that “these opportunities will be invaluable in product-lifecycle management.”\n\nIn a two-part article in Cybersecurity Law Report, Mary J. Hildebrand CIPP/US/E, partner, founder and Chair of Lowenstein’s Privacy & Cybersecurity practice, discusses how companies should adapt their cyber programs in light of the recent amendment to the New York Department of Financial Services’ cybersecurity regulations. First, Hildebrand advises that “the CISO should gather information and begin talking points for leadership as a gap analysis proceeds;” then, she says, the CISO should “take the existing checklist and go through the new rules with the dates of implementation, and slot in the new requirements.” Hildebrand adds that company boards of directors should “make sure the CISO has the money and other resources to develop and implement the cybersecurity program.”\n\nCompanies should also consider increasing the frequency of their vulnerability scanning, Hildebrand continues, observing that “centralizing and managing vulnerability reports… an area where companies could do a lot better,” She also suggests that documentation from outside vendors and affiliates be “part of the material that a CEO may need to consult before certifying compliance.” (subscription required to access article)\n\nDoreen M. Edelman, Chair of Lowenstein’s Global Trade & National Security, talks to Export Compliance Daily about the Bureau of Industry and Security's shift towards more aggressive enforcement policies, noting that she views this as a “recommitment” to cracking down on illegal technology transfers “especially for exports to China and Russia. “\n\nEdelman further notes that an increase in enforcement may persuade more companies to pursue voluntary self-disclosure, which not only helps with “keeping the company out of the news,” but also demonstrates that “this is not a joke, that the government takes this seriously,.” She doubts the Commerce Department will start publishing charging letters immediately: “[Commerce is] always going to keep their discretion. They're not getting rid of the pre-charging letter discussions, so there's still going to be flexibility.” (subscription required to access)\n\nIn TIME, Doreen M. Edelman, partner and Chair of Lowenstein’s Global Trade & National Security group, and senior counsel Laura Fraedrich discuss the impact of sanctions on Cuba-based organizations and businesses that have been locked out of online services such as file transfer sites, social media managers, cloud services, development apps, video calling, and education platforms. Edelman explains that the complicated trade restrictions and inconsistent history of U.S.-Cuba relations discourages U.S. companies from finding workarounds for clients located there. She says: “I’ve worked with a lot of clients over the years who take a very conservative approach and decide they don’t want to run that risk. [Startups especially are] not going to want to pay for legal fees for stuff like this, so they’ll just follow the embargo and be done with it.” Fraedrich adds that the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets has lately been more “targeted at people who are in or have been in the government; …you really wonder why we couldn’t go to something like that for Cuba to mitigate some of these secondary and tertiary effects.”\n\nIn Supply Chain Management Review, Doreen M. Edelman, partner and Chair of Lowenstein’s Global Trade & National Security practice, and Laura Fraedrich address the recent rollback of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and the potential impact on supply chain challenges. Edelman advises companies “to stay engaged and hands-on. Make sure paperwork and advanced CBP filings are in order. Contact everyone in the import supply chain to ensure your products are a priority known to all parties in the import chain. Ensure your classifications, markings, and country of origins representations are accurate, complete, and don’t trigger CBP questions.”\n\nFraedrich says that the lifting of these tariffs “will help U.S. manufacturers be more competitive in the world market while at the same time helping the EU steel and aluminum manufacturers maintain their production. The move also reinforces the Biden Administration’s vow to re-engage our allies in bilateral and multilateral negotiations on commercial issues to create a more unified front related to threats from countries such as China and Russia. This deal may be the beginning of similar deals for other countries and deeper negotiations with the EU on trade issues.”\n\nForeign Investment Watch interviews Doreen M. Edelman, partner and Chair of the firm’s Global Trade & National Security group and number one on the company’s Top Advisors 2021 list, about President Joe Biden’s approach to China, the latest governmental trade appointments, a possible U.S. investigation into Chinese subsidies under Section 301 of the U.S. trade law, and other government actions that target China. “One example is Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act, which prohibits any U.S. government agency from buying or doing business with any company that uses telecom equipment that uses components from one of the targeted Chinese companies,” Edelman says. “These are broad provisions with the focus being to ostracize China.” She adds, “I don’t think either side wants … [a trade war] because of the market implications, and Biden has pledged to be more multilateral in his approach. Let’s hope that the ongoing bilateral discussions are substantive, and the new appointees can get engaged quickly.”\n\nEdelman continues: “U.S. business and consumers were, and are, the victims of the Section 301 tariffs. No one thought they would last this long. More tariffs would not be prudent. … The silver lining I see is that trade regulations and tariffs are now issues that senior management can take advantage of to optimize their business if they really understand their options. It is critical to every company’s growth strategy.”\n\nSteven E. Siesser, Chair of the firm’s Private Equity practice and Co-Chair of the Transactions & Advisory Group, comments in Bloomberg Law on the Federal Trade Commission’s recent announcement that it can no longer review mergers and acquisitions within 30 days, as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act; due to the high volume of deals lately, now an investigation may remain open and then subsequently be declared unlawful. “There is no indication of if and when the FTC will tell you the deal is good to go,” Siesser says. “And that leaves you in limbo, which is a real problem because it is an open-ended risk situation.” He adds that this may result in parties being less willing to close deals, requiring contractual changes to mitigate risk of possible future unwinding: “That’s a big deal and a matter of meaningful impact to M&A practitioners already looking to close mergers and acquisitions at a time when activity is so robust, and it’s just such volume in the market.”\n\nIn Foreign Investment Watch, Doreen M. Edelman, Chair of the firm’s Global Trade & National Security group, and Christian C. Contardo discuss a recent report by the Defense Critical Supply Chain Task Force and its recommendations for building U.S. supply chain resilience, including the possibility of requiring companies to disclose foreign capital they receive from adversaries. Edelman says, “I am advising companies, not just technology and defense providers, to focus on their supply chain.” Regarding the possibility of creating an inclusionary process that exempts “trusted partners” from CFIUS requirements, Edelman predicts “a formal or informal loosening of the requirements for trusted partners,” despite the fact that these relationships are always subject to “a fact specific transaction review.” Contardo observes that these recommendations “are in addition to voluntary incentive-based supply-chain security programs such as the Department of Defense Trusted Capital program, [which] matches vetted capital providers to U.S. businesses working with the DoD in key technology sectors as a way for the businesses to raise necessary funding to grow without risking investment from countries of concern to the DoD.”\n\nZarema A. Jaramillo, Managing Partner of Lowenstein’s Washington, D.C. office, is featured in Northern Virginia Technology Council’s (NVTC) member spotlight, where she discusses the firm’s growth and how it is serving technology clients in the Washington area. Jaramillo says, “The synergy of our core practices here in D.C. seamlessly complements the firm’s wide range of transactional work in technology, private equity, and life sciences, as well as others, and enables us to offer a multidimensional, global perspective to businesses operating around the world.” She adds that the D.C. office is rapidly growing “because we are attracting the highest caliber of attorneys who are able to collaborate in a great culture that encourages an entrepreneurial mindset. … As a woman-led office, we are focusing our efforts on making it a place where all lawyers can grow and succeed and shape their practices in a way that allows them to be all that they can be.”\n\nIn an HFM article on the increasing popularity of hybrid public/private funds, partner Benjamin Kozinn of the Investment Management group discusses how to structure these funds and their fees, as well as how to mitigate compliance risks. “One approach is to have opt-in opt-out structures where the investor elects whether they want to allocate a portion of their capital (e.g., 10%, 20%) to privates. In the opt-in/out model, whether you actually invest in privates becomes a function of how many people opted in or opted out,” Kozinn says. He adds that one common approach with these funds is to charge a lower management fee and a higher incentive fee: “Maybe you don’t have to worry about portfolio risk management every day as you would with public markets, but the costs and the complexity of private investments can be higher than public investments.” Kozinn also warns of possible MNPI (Material Nonpublic Information) issues with these structures: “If a private company you are invested in is getting bought by a public company, or it is entering into a significant commercial arrangement with a public company, the manager is potentially walking into MNPI problems if you don’t have a physical separation and appropriate information barriers between the private and public investment teams.” (subscription required to access article)\n\nIn an interview with Authority Magazine, Meredith Beuchaw and Chandra Shih talk about their work in the technology sector, what has influenced them, and why it is important to increase the number of women founders in this field. Beuchaw says, “We’re missing half the great ideas if women are not founding companies and getting funded. We need women because we are missing out on innovation if we do not have women-founded companies.” Shih adds: “Getting more women funded and seeing more women succeed will create a domino effect — it’s the whole idea that representation matters.”\n\nBoth Shih and Beuchaw are members of Lowenstein Sandler’s Tech Group, known for representing the underrepresented. Shih, who works with growth stage and early stage startups as well as venture firms and other angel and strategic investors, talks about having been recruited and mentored by her former law school professor and managing partner of the firm’s Palo Alto office, Kathi Rawnsley: “In addition to enjoying the work we do and the people I get to work with, it has been so fantastic to start and grow my career at a place where I could see women had a seat at the table at the highest levels of the firm.\"\n\nWhen asked to name her influences, Beuchaw, who leads M&A transactions and has counseled clients both on the buy and sell side through hundreds of deals for over 15 years, cites Michelle Obama’s quote, “When they go low, we go high.” “It is about not letting others’ poor behavior be an excuse for our own,” she says. “This is especially important as we see more women on boards and in decision-making positions. Sadly, most of us have been at the received end of bad behavior along the way, but it is important not to let that be the standard for our behavior now and realize we can bring our moral high ground with us.\"\n\nShih references Stacey Abrams’ book, Lead from the Outside, as a helpful guide that \"focuses on the challenges that women, people of color and those in the LGBTQ community might have in starting their career, as they are told, ‘to advance you must be a leader,’ but may not know where to begin because the system they’re trying to advance in was not built for them.”\n\nEd Zimmerman, Chair and co-founder of Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group), Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School, and a Founding Partner of First Close Partners LLC, speaks about The Diversity Dividend (#ElDividendodelaDiversidad) as part of a panel, “The Return on Investing in Diverse Fund Managers,” presented by Promoting Venture Capital in Peru (PECAP). The panel, including Susana Garcia-Robles of Capria/LAVCA, Anita Fiori of IDB Lab, Jose Fernandez of StepStone Group, and moderator Luis Narro of PECAP, addresses why it is important and lucrative to invest in underrepresented venture capital fund managers. “Diversity is not only an imperative from a human rights, civil rights, and justice perspective, … it is a financial imperative,” Zimmerman says. “There are unbelievable missed economic opportunities as a result of the myopia that comes from having only people who look the same, went to the same schools, and live in the same communities.” He encourages LPs to speak up by asking GPs to diversify their reference list in order to expose the flaws in their networks. Zimmerman notes that a lack of diversity in the VC world results in “massive costs and causes exclusion, discomfort, and inequity in the workplace.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on First Close Partners (tweet below from reporter Yuliya Chernova):\n\n\"Ed Zimmerman, chair of the tech practice at the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, says he texted Theresia Gouw, founding partner at Acrew Capital, in November about the idea of teaming up to invest in underrepresented fund managers.\n\nThe newly formed firm, First Close Partners, has already backed about two dozen venture funds and expects to invest in more than 60 by the end of the year, Mr. Zimmerman said. These include Avid Ventures, Base Ventures, Cleo Capital, Marcy Venture Partners and Slauson & Co., among many others. The majority of fund managers that First Close has committed to are Black and a majority are women, Mr. Zimmerman said. Some contacted First Close cold, with no prior introductions.\n\nFounding partners in First Close also include Regina Benjamin, a former U.S. Surgeon General, as well as Josh Kopelman, co-founder of First Round Capital, and Betsy Zimmerman, partner at GrapeArbor Ventures and Mr. Zimmerman’s wife.\n\n“We are trying to have an impact that exceeds our dollars, and also to make money with the underrepresented managers that we are backing,” Mr. Zimmerman said. “We’ve seen instances of our money being dramatically multiplied by other [limited partners] coming in, either where we introduced them or served as a reference,” he added.\n\nHe declined to state how much capital First Close Partners has in total, but said that his family is investing $1 million into it.\n\nWell-connected people in the venture industry can act on diversifying who gets to play in the market. While there’s an aspect of social good in the effort, Mr. Zimmerman says that it’s also about financial benefit: “When a fund has been successful, it’s hard to get into fund three or fund four. Being an early backer enables you to follow on.”\n\nEd Zimmerman, Chair and co-founder of Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group) and Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School, teamed up with Marie T. DeFalco (Vice Chair of Lowenstein’s Investment Management Group) to represent Avid Ventures in its $68 million-plus debut. Zimmerman tells Business Wire that managing partner Addie Lerner is “a brilliant, hard-charging, and charismatic force within the venture community. She will win deals by force of intellect, personality, and the reputation for excellence and integrity that she has already developed here in the States, in the UK, and in Israel. Having been opposite Addie in my role as counsel to startups, I’ve been impressed to see, more than once, founders rapidly transition from meeting Addie to making room for her in oversubscribed venture rounds.”\n\nIn Pitchbook, Zimmerman says: \"LPs back the person in a solo GP fund. … I'm excited to see how people react … [to Avid], and whether others say this strategy is different and I'd like to copy it, or at least pivot into it a little bit more.”\n\nZimmerman tells TechCrunch that Lerner has a reputation for being “extraordinarily thoughtful about deals” and that one entrepreneur called her “one of the smartest people she has met in a decade-plus in venture.” He adds: “I’ve seen it myself in deals and then I’ve seen founders turn down very well branded funds to work with Addie. … Addie will find and win and be invited into great deals because she makes an indelible impression on the people who’ve worked with her and the data is remarkably consistent.”\n\nIn Crunchbase, Zarema A. Jaramillo, Managing Partner of Lowenstein’s D.C. office and partner in the firm’s Antitrust/Competition practice, discusses the possible chilling effect on venture capital investments due to increased regulatory scrutiny under the new administration. Jaramillo observes that “additional scrutiny is being brought on by agencies operating under the general idea that technology companies have too much power.” She adds that regulators may be influenced by their prior reluctance to act against large acquisitions by companies such as Facebook and Google. “[T[he government says ‘we got it wrong with larger companies, we don’t want to get it wrong again. … They can’t predict if there is harm to competition, so they are erring on the side of ‘challenge it now’ rather than later. We see the new administration taking a stronger approach to these.”\n\nLaura Fraedrich is interviewed in Foreign Investment Watch about foreign direct investment requirements, CFIUS filings, and mitigation negotiations. Regarding the incoming administration, she says, “I anticipate that the United States will return to a more multilateral approach. … Specifically, I think we will see a return to a cooperative effort to restoring the dispute settlement arrangement at the WTO and to the negotiation of multilateral trade agreements.” Fraedrich notes that “during the past five years, the majority of mitigation agreements have related to preventing access to data or technology by the foreign investors,” and she advises companies to “carefully consider where the national security concerns may lie and determine the cost of potential mitigation arrangements when negotiating. This is because certain mitigation requirements might impact the benefit of the bargain and thus valuation. Finding this out after the deal has been struck can create a difficult situation.”\n\nFraedrich encourages companies to consider foreign investment and ownership implications early in the transaction: “A company organized in the United States might be a foreign entity if there is foreign ownership and control. A joint venture that is organized in a foreign country might be subject to CFIUS jurisdiction if a U.S. business has been contributed. The new rules for private equity funds are complicated, and if fund managers are not careful, a U.S.-organized fund can be a foreign person.”\n\nEd Zimmerman, Chair and co-founder of Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group) and Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School, is interviewed by CEO/Founder Mazy Dar on the podcast Openfin MVP. Entitled “Our Whole Selves at Work with Ed Zimmerman,” Zimmerman discusses his career as a lawyer, investor, and co-founder of VentureCrush, as well as his social/political advocacy efforts. Topics include Zimmerman and Dar having had lunch with Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris years ago (before the duo hosted her for a fundraiser for her successful 2016 Senate bid), as well as discussing common legal mistakes founders make and the more than 100 angel investments Zimmerman has made. The conversation also focuses on efforts to improve #Diversity in tech and venture, with reference to company culture and initiatives in which Zimmerman has personally been involved, including his Wall Street Journal Accelerators columns in 2013 (asserting that #VentureCapital was too white, too male, and too homogenous) and 2014 (Zimmerman published one of the earliest pledges against #GenderBias in Tech, a pledge he still follows).\n\nEd Zimmerman comments to Nasdaq in an article on the booming stock market and VC-backed growth companies going public via IPO and SPAC. Ed, who chairs Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group) at Lowenstein Sandler and, for the last 16 years, has been an Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School notes: “One of the things we’re seeing is a lot of performance – companies are actually performing. … They weren’t necessarily performing in the 90’s and during the dot com crisis.”\n\nOn the popularity of SPACs as a means of going public, Zimmerman tells Nasdaq, “When you have people who have made lots of money who are doing [SPACs], that enhances the credibility. They’re not in a cordoned off section of the market.” Zimmerman also remarks that more mature companies are turning to SPACs rather than IPOs: “These are companies that could IPO and are choosing a different path – that’s a meaningful difference as compared to SPACs we saw five to six years ago.”\n\nRossie E. Turman III explains to The American Lawyer his reasons for moving from Skadden to Lowenstein Sandler as partner and Chair of Lowenstein Sandler’s International Finance group, with seats in the firm’s Debt Finance group and Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group): “If you’re trying to grow, align yourself with someone else that is trying to grow. … [I]f you’re trying to succeed, align yourself with someone else that is trying to succeed.” The article notes that Turman “will work closely with the firm’s Tech Group in representing companies based in emerging markets that have interests in the U.S.” He will lead Lowenstein’s efforts with respect to companies and funds located in and doing business with Africa. He has also actively engaged in civic endeavors and supported several charities on the African continent for nearly 30 years.\n\nIn Westlaw Today’s story about his joining the firm, Turman says his “move to Lowenstein would facilitate building out the ‘three-legged stool’ of … [my] … practice, incorporating cross-border transactions, finance and technology.”\n\nPrivate Equity Wire, Law.com International/Middle East and Africa, Reuters, Bloomberg Law, and ROI-NJ also cover Turman’s transition to Lowenstein. (subscription required to view certain content) View Lowenstein's news announcement about Turman joining the firm.\n\nIn Bankrate, Ed Zimmerman and Meredith Beuchaw of Lowenstein Sandler’s Tech Group discuss 2020’s booming tech IPO market and SPAC trend. Contrasting the current IPO market with the over-hyped bubble, Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School and Lowenstein Sandler’s Tech Group Chair Zimmerman says: “The companies that we’re seeing going public in the tech world today are performing,” adding that SPACs may be more risky. “SPACs – what happens if they clock out before they can roll out a company? They may close deals, but they may catch falling knives to complete their mandate.”\n\nBoth lawyers anticipate an impact from the upcoming election. Zimmerman advises growth equity investors, VCs and management teams that are poised to IPO “to think carefully about the timeframe for their investments and how they might deal with fallout from November.” Beuchaw observes: “Companies are prepping for potential disruptions, even if they don’t come to pass….If capital dries up, that could lead companies to take an alternative path to get into the public markets…– IPOs, SPACs.” She says, “They’re dual-tracking an entry into public markets, perhaps through a merger or acquisition.”\n\nEd Zimmerman, Chair and co-founder of Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group), and Adjunct Professor of Venture Capital at Columbia Business School, is quoted in The Real Deal, discussing the lawsuit regarding the co-founding of Compass, a real estate tech startup that has raised more than $1.5 billion from investors, including Softbank. The lawsuit pertains to whether plaintiff Avi Dorfman (who, according to the court, was a co-founder of Compass), is entitled to shares of stock in Compass (reportedly recently “valued at $6.4 billion”) or solely cash damages. The case, which has been compared to the “Facebook/ Winkelvoss lawsuit,” is presently pending in New York. Zimmerman’s view: “The brokerage likely wants to avoid a fiduciary relationship with Dorfman. With shares, Dorfman would be empowered to request financial information, and it’s possible his vote would also be needed to approve a company sale. If the court awards him cash, their relationship is contractual and short-lived. They rip the Band-Aid off.”\n\nDoreen M. Edelman comments in Business Insider on the risks for venture capital firms under the Trump administration’s increased scrutiny of foreign investment, as illustrated by the executive order banning TikTok in this country and ordering its parent ByteDance to undo a years-old merger that led to the app's expansion around the world. \"I don't feel that enough of the venture companies and the [private equity] backed companies in tech and data understand that this ... could be a real issue,\" she says.\n\nShe explains the broad reach of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which can not only review but also force changes to deals closed long ago. “There’s no time limit,” she says. There is also no requisite size for a company to come under CFIUS review. \"There's no de minimis,\" Edelman continues. \"There's no lower threshold.\" (subscription required to access article)\n\nIn Built In, Ed Zimmerman, Kathleen A. McGee, and Kimberly E. Lomot discuss the confusion regarding startups' eligibility under PPP for SBA loans, including how venture capital-backed growth companies should consider certifying “need” under the CARES Act. “The reporting in the press was, ‘Startups are totally ineligible or almost totally ineligible,’” says Zimmerman. “But that’s not what the law says. That’s analysis under Section 103, and the proper way to do the analysis is under 301.” He goes on to clarify under what conditions “negative control” by minority owners may constitute affiliation so as to bar PPP loan eligibility, and how to avoid this through irrevocable waivers or amended charters.\n\nBoth Zimmerman and McGee emphasize the importance of documentation. McGee, former Bureau Chief at the New York State Attorney General’s Office, explains the potential risk of future prosecution for companies applying for PPP without having properly assessed the “necessity” certification: “If it is demonstrable on the budget in the Excel spreadsheet you’re keeping that things are going to get much tighter because of COVID-19, then I think you’re justified. … But you have to have that good faith justification. If you have a year of bank, it’s probably going to be a flag raised for regulators.”\n\nLomot, who has years of experience counseling both borrowers and lenders on SBA loans, also urges caution in taking the certifications seriously: “eagerness to claim available funds…could get startups in trouble if they’re not applying in good faith.”\n\nIn Corporate Counsel (February 25, 2020), Doreen M. Edelman, Chair of Lowenstein’s Global Trade & National Security group, discusses why GCs of financial services companies focused on cryptocurrency, payment systems, mobile banking, and insurance-related technologies need to understand the new changes in regulations governing reviews by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States [CFIUS] of foreign investment transactions. She says, “This is such an expanded group of companies because the way CFIUS looks at this now is like this is an episode of ‘Homeland,’” adding that “something else GCs ought to know is that the risk may be bigger for the buyer than the seller. It depends on how the agreement is written and what the investment is.” Edelman adds, “Also, there is no de minimis on this. If it is a $3 million investment, you still have to consider CFIUS.” She remarks that if she were an in-house lawyer, “I would want to have [the transaction] reviewed initially and get something in writing that I had someone review it and tell me what my risks are if I don’t file, or why I don’t need to file [for a CFIUS review] in case the government comes knocking on the door later.” Furthermore, another Corporate Counsel article (March 10, 2020) by global trade lawyers from Kirkland & Ellis references Edelman and Abbey E. Baker’s piece, “Did ‘Silicon Valley’ Get CFIUS Right? Can It Really Ruin Everything?,” where they observe how the HBO show’s writers misunderstood how CFIUS actually functions.\n\nBloomberg News, Yahoo! Finance, BNN Bloomberg, Financial Advisor Magazine, fin24, MSN Money , The Baltimore Sun, and Daily Herald include comments by Ed Zimmerman, Chair of Emerging Companies & Venture Capital (fka, The Tech Group) and professor of venture capital at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Business, in the article “A Prenup Is the Latest Must-Have for Tech Startup Founders in Love.” “We have companies where the founder is the brand, and trust and credibility are core to the business,” says Zimmerman. ‘“If you are investing in a company because you think the founder is amazing,” news of that individual’s distracting divorce or custody battle can be alarming. Zimmerman further explains other personal difficulties which can impact a startup: “It would be great if we lived in a world where people who had marital problems didn’t manifest those problems by hitting on or dating people who worked at their company…. Those kinds of things tend to be more problematic than who gets the shares.”\n\nBenjamin Kozinn points to a confluence of issues present in a cracked economy which led to the 2008 global financial crisis in an interview with the Hedge Fund Law Report. In the first of a two-part series, Kozinn provides an insider’s assessment of the crisis—the causes, the role that hedge funds played, and the regulatory changes in its aftermath (including passage of the Dodd-Frank Act)—and the new focus on counterparty risk. Kozinn also provides insight into the evolution of hedge fund managers as a result of the crisis and the issues behind increased levels of scrutiny. In part two of the series, Kozinn discusses the growing importance of chief compliance and chief operating officers since 2008, growing institutionalization and scrutiny of the hedge fund business, and factors behind a 2018 decrease in fund launches. In addition, Kozinn looks at the state of financial regulation and why the next downturn will reinvigorate hedge funds and spur a search for fresh talent."
