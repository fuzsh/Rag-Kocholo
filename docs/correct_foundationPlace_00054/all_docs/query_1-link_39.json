        "text": "Setting the Scene – The Data Arms Race\n\nIn today’s data-driven business world, asset managers are demanding access to an ever-increasing breadth and depth of data in order to stay on top, with 40% of large firms having an explicit goal to become an analytics focussed organisation. Meanwhile, over 90% of asset managers’ Data Operating Models are still in the “Frustratingly Fragmented” or “Getting Organised” phase of the journey according to historical Alpha FMC data. This article investigates Enterprise Investments Technology’s role in creating and provisioning high-quality data sets to their consumers.\n\nAddressing an Ever-Increasing Appetite for Data\n\nThrough the early 2000s Asset Managers tended to buy “Best of Breed” systems and integrate them; typically resulting in a spaghetti junction of flat files, custom reports and point to point data flows connecting the various systems across functions. This created a high dependency on support staff to manage and upgrade these interfaces and an operational burden in terms of frequent breakdowns or delays in data transmission.\n\nWith the increase in demand for high quality, real-time, API accessible data, Managers have been forced to double down on interface spend just to keep the lights on. Typically, this has exacerbated the issue by taking up hard-won change spend and allocating it back to BAU; forward-thinking Asset Managers are looking to Enterprise Investments Technology to solve the data challenges they face.v\n\nEnterprise Technology – The Foundation of a Solid Data Strategy\n\nEnterprise Technology is designed to cater to a broad cross-section of the business, dealing with all asset classes and business functions. While this may leave it lacking in certain cutting edge asset classes or nuanced analytics scenarios, it creates a hugely powerful data engine capable of holding a single view across the full range of funds.\n\nFrom front-to-back across all funds, this holistic view of data is seen by many as the key to unpicking the point-to-point architectures of old, even pushing into the opaque world of private markets with BlackRock’s acquisition of eFront.\n\n3. A Single Source of Data\n\nAlpha regularly sees Asset Managers with collections of systems providing the same capabilities but for different fund ranges. This solution often appears workable with many teams being split along asset class lines; however, it does cause a huge burden for those looking to have a single view of data. Enterprise solutions remove this issue by providing a single system capable of covering all asset classes and providing holistic views required by boards and senior management teams.\n\nGet on Board or Get Left Behind\n\nEnterprise solutions are already used by at least 70% of the top 30 Asset Managers; these managers are starting to see the benefit of a solid core built around an Enterprise Solution, providing them with a strong data model, API-first capability and a partner in keeping up with industry changes. All this allows these managers to allocate resources and capital to truly differentiating areas by building cutting edge front office tooling, advanced analytics capabilities or digital client experiences. In Alpha’s view, it’s time to get on board or get left behind.\n\nUnleash the Power of Your Data – How Alpha Can Help\n\nAlpha is uniquely positioned to help clients across the spectrum of data-related transformation projects.\n\nAlpha's Enterprise Experience\n\nAt Alpha, we have a wealth of experience supporting our clients with the full transition to Enterprise Technology.
