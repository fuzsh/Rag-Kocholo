        "text": "“We started as a newspaper ad publisher,” explains Enrique Sacau, CEO of Kneip. “At the time, our founder Bob Kneip had identified two areas where financial market participants faced critical needs: the legal obligation to communicate about instruments domiciled in Luxembourg and those distributed in the whole world, and the need for teams and clients to receive training and information via overhead transparency.”\n\nTurning challenge into opportunity\n\nThe company initially focused on producing annual reports and legal notices, but it soon expanded its range of services to include the production of biannual reports in multiple languages and presentation materials. As the business grew and prospered, the company faced a challenge with the advent of the digital revolution because until then most material was paper-based. “We had to adapt and use technology to make clients’ communication more effective, consistent, and relevant,” Sacau says.\n\nThe company faced another major challenge with the financial crisis of 2008 and the increase in regulatory reporting and transparency requirements that followed – a challenge that ended up being an opportunity for the company to better support clients. Since then, understanding the ever-changing regulatory landscape has posed plenty of obstacles for asset managers, one that Kneip helps them to navigate.\n\nIt is in crises that we need to be closest to our customers to help them meet their challenges.\n\nEnrique Sacau , CEO , Kneip\n\nKeeping abreast of regulation and ensuring data quality\n\nThe company is independent and acts as a channel for clients to address general regulatory questions to EU regulators while maintaining industry focus. With Kneip, financial institutions can ensure compliance across MiFID, PRIIPs, AIFMD and UCITS regulations. Sacau explains: “Kneip works directly with regulators and industry bodies to anticipate regulations and understand their impact on our clients so they always stay ahead of the curve.”\n\nAlongside assisting with regulatory compliance, Kneip also helps to ensure the quality of data published by financial institutions, data that is critical to success in fund distribution. The company’s internal research shows that nearly four out of 10 data points suffer from inconsistency – which obviously poses operational and compliance risk.\n\nAcquisition by part of Deutsche Börse Group\n\nOne of the company’s most notable developments in its history took place in 2022 when it was acquired by part of Deutsche Börse Group to create a leading fund data hub based in Luxembourg. “When we joined Deutsche Börse Group, we accelerated our investment in our teams and in Kneip’s growth, allowing us to unlock the full potential of the Clearstream Fund Services ecosystem for investment fund solutions. We can now deliver more value and place our clients on the best path for success,” Sacau says.\n\nWe guarantee the highest data consistency on the market, which means lower risk of inaccurate data and increased exposure to potential investors.\n\nEnrique Sacau , CEO , Kneip\n\nHelping to shape the future\n\nKneip sees itself as continuing to guide the industry toward better handling of data, particularly in relation to regulatory changes. Sacau says the five crucial steps are consolidating all necessary data in one place, inputting all data at once, sourcing all outputs from one location, ensuring data consistency, and validating all data.\n\n“For as long as Kneip has existed, every player in the fund industry has dreamt of having a true transparent golden source of data for its business,” says Sacau, adding that emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain have a role to play in managing data but need solid governance. He says that with Kneip, clients’ data can be reused, disseminated, turned into regulatory outputs, and be accessed and consulted in real time, transparently, by anyone on the team that has fed Kneip that data.\n\n“For 30 years, this has been the dream of our industry, and Kneip has made it happen,” Sacau says.\n\nTo find out more, visit our"
