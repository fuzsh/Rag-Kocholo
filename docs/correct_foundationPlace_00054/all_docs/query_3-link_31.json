        "text": "Asset Managers face a fundamental challenge in coming years, in addition to market volatility, changing regulation, competition, rising cost and delivering performance – it’s data management.\n\nThe data management challenge is exacerbated by:\n\n> outdated technology generating costs and output errors\n\n> changing regulation creating more and new data requirements\n\nThe Fund Information Hub portal provides Asset Managers with access to the latest fund data management and distribution technology which hosts core middle office functions, enabling connectivity, interoperability, and flexibility.\n\nWe optimise your funds’ speed-to-market, whether it be launching new funds in Luxembourg, or establishing passporting rights in new markets.\n\nThe foundation of our solution is validated and accurate fund data leveraged across the entire investment fund value chain.\n\nLegacy systems and sheer quantities and varieties make it very difficult for investment houses to maintain and process fund data ensuring quality, accuracy and timeliness. This means the data could eventually end up in the market, in front of investors, regulators and other stakeholders, in the form of reports, data templates and other documents, with errors. This is a major risk to asset managers and the market.\n\nIn the create stage, our Registration & Filing solutions facilitate unparalleled regulatory compliance, speed-to-market and enhanced sales. We achieve this through ingesting, verifying and validating your fund data to ensure it’s accurate and consistent across your whole value chain in our output and calculations. We then obtain the right permissions to distribute and market your funds in new and existing jurisdictions.\n\nQuantities and elaboration of required regulatory output make it very difficult for investment houses to keep the process in-house which end up resorting to several suppliers. To put this into perspective, we created a whooping 60,000 PRIIPs KID documents in 22 languages for just one of several of our clients, by the tight January 2023 deadline.\n\nIn the Report stage, our Document Production solution delivers, strictly to deadlines, complex regulatory reporting and marketing fund documents in accordance with your operational and brand requirements. To achieve this, we lean on our golden source fund database, our advanced technology and our technology and regulatory experts.\n\nThere are several players in investment markets and little consistency in how they share fund information. Constant regulatory developments drive changes to data sets resulting in increased numbers of data points that must be maintained. Such requirements put a huge strain on some business functions including Operations and Sales distracting them from their core responsibilities.\n\nIn the third and final Distribute stage, our Distribution solution facilitates dissemination of your fund data and documents across our vast network of 300+ data partners and institutions such as data vendors, platforms or banks, to name a few, as well as 3,900+ advisers. Our advanced technology capabilities, regulatory and technology expertise and relationships built in the investment marketplace for the past 20 years help us achieve this."
