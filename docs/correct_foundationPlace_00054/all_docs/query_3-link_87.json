        "text": "The never-ending pain of sourcing accurate company information is one we hear a lot about at FundApps. Clients sourcing exactly the same information and using the same data providers, each doing the same validation and checks to make sure that the data they have is correct. Duplication of effort is rife with no mechanism to utilise and share the work of others and, where data providers are notified of inaccuracies, days often pass before corrections are reflected in data feeds.\n\nWhat if there was a better way?\n\nPerhaps, a consolidated data product where clients could access the same database of company information. One that clients could update themselves, verify changes others have made and work together, collating a golden source of community powered data with continuous, live updates.\n\nIntroducing FundApps’ “Global Company Database”\n\nIntegrated with GLEIF and currently made up of 1.4m companies, the “Global Company Database” takes all of the information currently available in the initiative and then super charges this with data relevant to compliance and beyond, giving us:\n\nA global company identifier (the LEI)\n\nCompany websites with issued shares data\n\nFiling email addresses\n\nContact persons\n\nRelationships between corporate entities\n\nWith ANNA integration the dataset will expand to contain security level information, such as issuer specific limits or issued share figures - allowing clients to add new limits and amend existing ones. Once verified, changes are reflected for all clients instantly."
