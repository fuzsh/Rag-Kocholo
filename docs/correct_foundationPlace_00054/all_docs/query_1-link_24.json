        "text": "For an end-to-end data excellence approach, it is essential that the data structures from technical data models are also available in dataspot. Both the Golden Source and the SPOT must be available for mapping transformations and brought under governance. The JdbcMetadataConnector enables a direct connection with data sources and thus also an automated alignment of the extracted metadata with dataspot.\n\nThe JdbcMetadataConnector establishes a connection to the source database whose metadata is extracted and a connection to dataspot. in order to create or update the corresponding data models. Essentially, the definitions of tables, columns, data types, relationships, etc. are read from the catalog of the source database and mapped as corresponding data models and assets in dataspot.\n\nThe JdbcMetadataConnector can be used to connect with all common databases."
