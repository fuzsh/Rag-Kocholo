I hereby confirm that data which I typed and clicked might be sent to social network owners and saved and electronically processed by them.\n\nThe Golden Copy Files, published by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), provide information on Legal Entity Identifiers (LEIs) and related reference data in a ready-to-use format that ensures:\n\nData does not contain technical duplicates.\n\nAll LEIs ever published in a GLEIF Golden Copy File version as well as all new LEIs published by the LEI issuers since the previous release of a Golden Copy File are included in the file.\n\nEnriched reference data provides deeper insight into the global market place.\n\nGLEIF issues three sets of Golden Copy Files daily. With each updated version of the Golden Copy Files, GLEIF also makes available four delta files. The delta files identify only newly issued LEIs and / or revisions to an LEI’s reference data historically reported in a Golden Copy File published either:\n\nEight hours earlier.\n\n24 hours earlier.\n\nSeven days earlier.\n\nOne month (31 days) earlier.\n\nFor detailed information, including the aspects that distinguish the GLEIF Golden Copy Files from the GLEIF Concatenated Files, refer to this dedicated website page: GLEIF Golden Copy and Delta Files.\n\nThe GLEIF Golden Copy Files, which are available for download, include specific information on LEI records based on the relevant Common Data File (CDF) format.\n\nLevel 1 LEI-CDF Golden Copy File: Learn more\n\nIt contains Level 1 data, i.e. LEI records and related reference data that provide information on who is who, based on the LEI-CDF format.\n\nLevel 2 Relationship Record (RR) CDF Golden Copy File: Learn more\n\nThe Level 2 RR-CDF Golden Copy File contains the Level 2 data to answer the question of ‘who owns whom’ based on the RR-CDF Format. It allows the identification of the direct and ultimate parents of a legal entity whose direct and ultimate parents have an LEI.\n\nLevel 2 Reporting Exceptions Golden Copy File: Learn more\n\nThe LEI data pool includes Level 2 data to answer the question of ‘who owns whom’. Specifically, legal entities that have or acquire an LEI report their ‘direct accounting consolidating parent’ as well as their ‘ultimate accounting consolidating parent’. Exceptions are reported based on the Reporting Exceptions format. Exceptions include: The LEI registrant has no parent entity; the child legal entity opts out of reporting for exceptional reasons; the direct and ultimate parents of the LEI registrant do not have an LEI.\n\nThe content of the Golden Copy files is also available in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. GLEIF has partnered with data.world, who offer this graph representation of the Golden Copy files: data.world/gleif\n\nIf you find something you wish to question, you may submit a challenge to any LEI data record through GLEIF’s central challenge facility.\n\nPlease address questions on the Golden Copy Files and delta files to info@gleif.org.\n\nLatest Files"
