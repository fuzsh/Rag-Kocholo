        "text": "Landytech's solution - Sesame - has allowed our team to understand in- depth portfolios' risk and performance by security and industry (and numerous other factors). The analytical engine of the software is very robust, yet the product is easy to use. Landytech's proactive efforts to manage risk, attention to detail, and responsiveness to new matters is unsurpassed.\n\nFollowing an impressive demonstration of Landytech’s offering, we asked them to pitch alongside a reputable competitor. The decision to choose Landytech was unanimous. Their offering was far superior in terms of functionality, ease of use and presentation. During the course of our relationship, Landytech have delivered exactly what they promised and more. I cannot speak highly enough of both the platform and the team.\n\nEver since we started Tellworth, Landytech have been a business essential service for us. They have proved to be flexible, responsive, commercial and understanding of our changing needs as we grow the business. This year with the challenges we have all faced they have really stepped up; helping us to look at risk and exposures in new ways and enabling better client relationships in the process.\n\nEach family’s got to look at that reporting system and feel that it is theirs. It needs to be the right colour, it needs to be branded, it needs to be white-labelled, it needs to look like it's come from our office. Landytech have mastered that well for us. For reporting to evolve, you need to work with a dynamic team growing their business with the same enthusiasm as yours so the two grow together. Landytech tick those boxes.\n\nBrooklands have been using Landytech extensively for both Risk and Compliance. We have been very impressed with the service that has been provided and also the accuracy of the data quality. The platform has been very useful to monitor risk for all of our funds at a click of a button.\n\nFrom the first meeting with Landytech, we were highly impressed by their commercial approach, efficient operating platform and experience. They have provided us with a robust risk management function that would be extremely challenging and expensive to implement within our own organisation. We were most fortunate to discover this firm and I would have no hesitation in recommending them.\n\nLandytech have proven to be open-minded, resourceful and trustworthy in all that they do. From the outset, they have been able to provide suggestions as to how we can best achieve our client reporting goals in a timely and accurate manner, offering innovative solutions to the challenges we face of bringing together data from disparate sources.\n\nSesame makes my life far easier. I can see everything in my portfolio in the detail I require and updated in real time – rather than a series of disparate and intermittent snapshots. Working with better information makes my investment management more effective and less stressful."
