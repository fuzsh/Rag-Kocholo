        "text": "1. THE 15th CENTURY IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA: THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS’ REIGN\n\n2. Isabellala of Castile and Ferdinand of Aragón were members of the same family, the Trastámara, ruling dynasty in Castile and Aragón since the beginning of the 15th century.\n\n3. CROWN OF ARAGON John II of Aragon and Navarre Ferdinand of Aragón, future Ferdinand the Catholic Blanca II Leonor I, queens of Navarre\n\n4. Joanna of Castile (La Beltraneja) Enrique IV (The Impotent) Alphonse of Trastámara Isabella of Castile John II of Castile CROWN OF CASTILE\n\n5. CIVIL WAR IN CASTILE When king Enrique IV died, the partisans of his sister Isabella started a war against the partisans of his daughter Joanna. Joanna was supported by PORTUGAL, due to her marriage to king Alphonse V the African Isabella was supported by ARAGON, due to her marriage to Ferdinand, heir of the Crown Of Aragon\n\n6. The war finished with the signature of the TREATY OF ALCÁÇOVAS: -Isabella would be the queen of Castile. -Portugal got the control of the exploration of the African coasts of the Atlantic Ocean and Castile’s sovereignty over the Canary Islands was recognized. - Joanna the Beltraneja could choose between marrying Prince John, Isabella and Ferdinand’s son, one year old, or entering a convent. She chose the second option.\n\n7. FERDINAND OF ARAGON, King of Aragón between 1479 and 1516 ISABELLA OF CASTILE, queen of Castile between 1479 and 1504 MOTTO: TANTO MONTA, MONTA TANTO, ISABELLA OR FERDINAND. DYNASTIC UNION, NOT TERRITORIAL UNION. But only Ferdinand used his power to rule in Castile. Isabella never showed interest in Aragón’s affairs, because Castile was bigger and richer than Aragón and women couldn’t rule there.\n\n8. YOKE (Ysabel) FASCE OF ARROWS (Ferdinand) CASTILE ARAGON AND THE TWO SICILIES GRANADA THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS’ COAT OF ARMS\n\n9. REFORMS MADE BY THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS TO REINFORCE THEIR AUTHORITY In Castile: -They punished the nobles who hadn’t supported Isabella in the civil war and confirmed the power of the privileged who had supported them -They didn´t call the Cortes to avoid receiving petitions from the most important people of their kingdoms. -They created the Royal Treasury to make the tax collection more efficient. -They created the Holy Brotherhood (Santa Hermandad), a rural militia or police, to fight against bandits and keep public order in the countryside. -They created the Royal Courts of Justice (Reales Audiencias), the highest courts to have the last word in the most important affairs of the kingdom. -They created the post of corregidor, a representative of the kings in every municipality of the kingdom. Member of the Holy Brotherhood in his greensleeves uniform, which gave origin to the Castilian expression “A buenas horas, mangas verdes”\n\n10. In Aragón, they had more difficulties to impose their authority, because the power of the king was smaller. They created the post of viceroy, a representative of the king in the different kingdoms of the Crown. Later viceroys were also appointed in the Indies. They also established the election of the municipal posts through a lottery. Alphonse of Aragón, Ferdinand II’s bastard son, appointed 1st viceroy of Aragón by his father Sack and balls used to draw the names of the candidates to public posts.The papers with the names were introduced on the holes of the balls\n\n11. In addition to the reforms in their kingdoms, they created: -several specialized councils to give them advice in complicated affairs: Council of Castile (the most important one), Council of Aragón, Council of Navarre, Council of the Indies, Council of the Inquisition and Council of the Military Orders. The high nobility was moved away from the councils and replaced by a professional bureaucracy, formed by expert lawyers and members of the low nobility. -A permanent and professional army, so that they didn´t have to depend on the nobles´ armies. T -A diplomatic corps, with a network of ambassadors in the most important European courts, in order to defend their interests abroad. Consultative councils: Castile, Aragón, Indies, Military Orders, Inquisition and Navarre (created after the conquest of this kingdom)\n\n12. In Castile stockbreeding continued to be the main economic activity. There were big herds of Merino sheep owned by nobles and the Mesta continued to be a powerful organization that defended their interests. The wool was exported to Flanders and England and the Catholic Monarchs protected stockbreeding to the detriment of agriculture. ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES\n\n13. The impact of the 14th century crisis had been stronger in Aragón. King Ferdinand made some decisions in order to try to revitalize economy: - Laws to favour trade, navigation and the Catalan craftsmanship. High tariffs were established to protect and stimulate local production. - End of the conflict of the pagesos de remensa: the Catalan farmers had revolted against the abuses of the owners of the lands they worked. King Ferdinand ended up this conflict with the Arbitral Sentence of Guadalupe (Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe): the bad customs (malos usos) were abolished, the Catalan farmers were declared free, but they had to pay an economic compensation to the nobles and the king for all the disturbances and damages caused. Despite these decisions, the Aragonese economy didn´t recover medieval splendour. Arbitral Sentence of Guadalupe\n\n14. RELIGIOUS POLICY Isabella and Ferdinand wanted all the citizens of their kingdoms to be Catholics. They followed a religious uniformity policy: - In 1492 they decreed the expulsion of all the Jews of their kingdoms. All Jews had to convert to Christianity or leave. Around 80,000 Jews left the kingdoms (Sephardi Jews). - In 1499 they obliged all the Muslims that still lived in their kingdoms to get baptized. This is the origin of the Moorish. Forced baptisms in Granada\n\n15. They also reinforced the Supreme Court of the Holy Inquisition to chase and punish all those suspected of heresy. The Dominican monk Tomás de Torquemada was appointed as Grand Inquisitor and repression started. During the Catholic Monarchs’ reign 2,000 people were burnt at the stake and around 14,000 were judged and punished in public autos-da-fe. This was a very dark period in the story of religious persecutions Auto da fe, by Pedro Berruguete Torquemada, Grand Inquisitor\n\n16. TERRITORIES CONQUERED BY THE CATHOLIC MONARCHS\n\n17. CONQUEST OF GRANADA After a 10-year military campaign they occupied the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada and they ended up with more than eight centuries of Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula. Granada became part of Castile.\n\n18. They also financed the expedition of Christopher Columbus to the Indies. All the territories “discovered” by Christopher Columbus were annexed to the Crown of Castile.\n\n19. In 1494, the Catholic Monarchs and the king of Portugal signed the Treaty of Tordesillas, under the arbitration of the Pope Alexander VI: the treaty divided the world into two areas of influence, drawing an imaginary line 370 leagues to the West of Cape Verde Islands: the territories located to the East of this line would belong to Portugal and the territories located to the West of this line would belong to Castile. The Crown of Aragón was excluded from the wealth and businesses related to the Indies (America).\n\n20. FOREIGN POLICY King Ferdinand was personally in charge of foreign policy: - Following the model of the Aragonese consulates, they decided to create embassies in the most important kingdoms in Europe to defend the interests of the Hispanic Monarchy. - Their main goal was to isolate France, the traditional enemy of the Crown of Aragón. To reach this goal, they used their five children to sign alliances with France’s most important enemies\n\n21. JOANNA CATHERINEISABELLA JOHNMARY ALLIANCE WITH PORTUGAL ALLIANCE WITH AUSTRIA ALLIANCE WITH ENGLAND MARRIAGE ALLIANCES The Catholic Monarchs used their five children to sign alliances against France’s enemies. In several cases, they married their children twice to keep the alliances: -Isabella, the first born, was married to Alphonse, Portugal’s heir, but when he died, she married Manuel the Fortunate, the king of Portugal. When Isabella died in 1498, her sister Mary married King Manuel. This way they kept the alliance with Portugal. -John married Margaret of Austria and Joanna married Philip of Burgundy. Margaret and Philip were the children of Emperor Maximilian of Austria and Mary of Burgundy. This double marriage assured the alliance with the Holy Roman Empire. -Catherine, the youngest child, married Arthur of England, Prince of Wales. When he died, she married Arthur’s brother, Henry, future Henry VIII. This way, the alliance with England was kept.\n\n23. SUCCESSION Queen Isabella the Catholic dictating her Will, Eduardo Rosales, 1864 Philip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad Joanna the Mad, by Francisco Pradilla, 1867 Her husband’s corpse transport from Burgos to Granada lasted for eight months. When Queen Isabella died in 1504, the heiress of Castile was her daughter Joanna the Mad, married to Philip the Handsome. As Joanna was unstable and not able to rule (Joanna the Mad), her husband was in charge of the government of Castile. Ferdinand continued to be the king of Aragón. When Philip the Handsome died in 1506, King Ferdinand became regent of Castile, Joanna was confined in Tordesillas.\n\n24. King Ferdinand had married Germaine of Foix in 1505 with the intention of having a child who could inherit his reign, because women couldn’t rule in Aragón. Germaine of Foix gave birth to a child, but he died hours later and Charles, Joanna and Philip’s son, was the only heir. Ferdinand II acted as regent of Castile until his death in 1516. Germaine de Foix married Ferdinand II when she was 17, while her husband was 53. Their child John didn’t survive\n\n25. When Ferdinand II died in January 1516, Joanna was the legitimate heiress. Ferdinand II’s testament also designated his grandson Charles as general governor and the regents until his arrival: Cardinal Cisneros in Castile and archbishop Alphonse of Aragón. In Castile, there were intrigues to replace Charles for his brother Ferdinand, educated in the Peninsula by his grandfather Ferdinand II, but Charles proclaimed himself king in Brussels one week after his grandfather’s death, ignoring his mother’s right to the throne. The different parts of the monarchy accepted this fact (although in Aragón they conditioned Charles’ acceptance to the oath of their fueros in the Cortes). Cisneros was regent until his death in Roa (Burgos) in November 1517, when he was on his way to meet Charles. Cardinal Cisneros, regent of Castile between 1516-1517 Infant Ferdinand, Charles’ brother, and future emperor of the Holy Roman Empire Charles I"
