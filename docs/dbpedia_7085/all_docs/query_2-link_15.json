        "text": "Réne d'Anjou was the Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence, and is pretty well remembered as the last Angevin King of Naples before he was disposed by the Trastamaras of Aragon. He was also married to the heiress of Lorraine who brought those lands to the Capetian House of Anjou. The fortunes of his dynasty decreased as he got older: his son failed to reclaim Naples for his father, his daughter and the Lancastrian Party in England were decisively defeated, too. By time he died in 1480, both his son and grandson were dead and Lorraine passed to the Vaudémont branch of the House of Lorraine and Anjou and Provence were reincorporated into France after the death of Charles of Maine.\n\nNow, what if the fortunes of the Anjou's were reversed in the 1460s? During the Catalonian Civil War, Réne was elected by the Catalonians as King of Aragon over the unpopular John II, who had reigned as a tyrant and had violated several articles of the Ustages of Barcelona, as well as the Constitution of Catalonia and the Fur of Lieda. The biggest issue is that while John II was hated in Catalonia, he had made concessions in Sicily that insured money, but especially grain was available to finance and feed his cause. While Catalonia had revolted against him, the remainder of the Aragonese Empire essentially remained loyal. He was especially popular in Sicily as well as Sardinia, with his base of operations being in Valencia. A second issue is the Consell de Cent never decisively choose someone to oppose John II. During the civil war, Henry IV of Castile, the Constable of Portugal, and Réne were all considered potential kings. The Consell had even considered Louis XI of France before settling on Réne, who sent his son the Duke of Lorraine south to campaign in his name.\n\nWith a few tweaks, I think it's possible for the Duke of Lorraine to decisively secure Aragon for his father. If the Consell is more decisive in it's choice of Réne after the death of Peter of Coimbra, we could see the Duke of Lorraine sent south with more substantial French forces. Maybe have the Duke of Lorraine's victory at Vildamat be even more decisive, with the Prince Ferdinand of Aragon being killed in battle. That could buy the Duke of Lorraine some needed time to dislodge John II from Valencia, and could even work in the Duke of Lorraine securing popular support for his family: perhaps through the betrothal of his son Nicholas to Isabella of Castile. John II would probably maintain the rump Aragonese Empire of Sicily and Sardinia.\n\nThat alone could have some very interesting knock-off effects. If the Duke of Lorraine is more successful, he wouldn't die of poison in 1470. You'd most certainly save the life of his son, too, whether or not he is married to Isabella. She might accept the marriage though, when it's likely Réne of Anjou will take the Crown of Aragon, and her other suitors are Alfosno V of Portugal (who she already refused) and the syphilitic Duke of Berry, brother of Louis XI. There are also interesting repurcussions regarding Lorraine: I know Burgundy was eying the territory, and Louis XI will probably begin eying Anjou and Maine when it becomes obvious that Réne's grandson will be King of Castile and Aragon. But I could see them retaining Provence. There's also the idea of a resurgent House of Anjou using Aragon and later Castile as a springboard to reclaim Naples: Réne becoming King of Aragon would definitely alter Early Modern Europe's course -- but is it even possible?\n\nIf John II of Lorraine had decisively won the battle of Vildamat and killed Ferdinand in the process, then yes Rene could have become King of Aragon. The civil war in Catalonia was hard fought in OTL and Ferdinand played a pivotal role in defeating the rebels. Without Ferdinand, John of Lorraine would have a sizeable advantage over John II of Aragon and would be able to take control of the kingdom. John II would probably flee to Sicily and plot to regain his kingdom from Rene. In TTL, I could definitely see Nicholas of Lorraine marrying Isabella of Castile. I believe Louis XI would take advantage of Rene’s preoccupation with Aragon to seize the counties of Anjou and Maine. In TTL, I see Louis waiting until the inevitable Castilian civil war following the death of Henry IV of Castile to make his move against the house of Anjou. Louis would probably form an alliance with John of Aragon and Ferdinand I of Naples who both have reason to fear Rene ruling Aragon. Obviously in TTL, Louis will also ally with Alfonso V of Portugal who I see still marrying Juana.\n\nIn TTL, Nicholas would face a more difficult situation than Ferdinand of Aragon did fighting Portugal in OTL. Ferdinand was an experienced ruler and commander who had the resources of Aragon to help him against Alfonso. But Nicholas in TTL would have to fight Portugal with out the full support of his father and grandfather who would be dealing with the numerous enemies of the house of Anjou. Because of Isabella, I suspect Nicholas would still prevail in Castile but his eventual rule in Aragon would be precarious. Ferdinand of Aragon was a formidable ruler who effectively reigned over Castile and Aragon. I don’t think Nicholas’s rule in TTL would be as successful. I see Rene holding on to Provence and John holding on Lorraine with both territories passing to Nicholas. Although Charles the Bold definitely wanted Lorraine in OTL, he had good relationships with both John and Nicholas, so I believe he would be allied with the house of Anjou in TTL.\n\nA wild card in TTL is England’s role in a war between Louis XI and the house of Anjou. Assuming Edward IV loses and regains his throne the same way he did in OTL then he may want to form an alliance with Rene and Charles the Bold. However the animosity between Edward and Queen Margaret (Rene’s daughter) may prevent such a formidable combination.\n\nIf John II of Lorraine had decisively won the battle of Vildamat and killed Ferdinand in the process, then yes Rene could have become King of Aragon.

However the animosity between Edward and Queen Margaret (Rene’s daughter) may prevent such a formidable combination.\n\nThat's what I thought: I figured if Ferdinand was killed during the civil war, it'd give the French Party more leverage in Aragon. I also believe that Ferdinand was John II's lone legitimate son who was still alive. Charles of Navarre had predeceased him without issue. With John II fleeing to Sicily, it does muddle the succession a bit. He lost his second wife in 1468, so might he remarry a third time? The lack of a legitimate male successor may be an issue, but at least in Sicily, a woman could succeed him, so he does have a successor in his daughter Joanna, who married the King of Naples--he also had an illegitimate son, the Duke of Villerhermosa. There's also his daughter Eleanor, who is Queen of Navarre.\n\nSo legitimate claimants are in no shortage, but it may put a dent in the popularity of his party following his exile from Aragon. I think remarriage would be possible to secure allies against the House of Anjou. If Charles the Bold's wife lives a bit longer, Margaret of York might make a very suitable bride as I imagine Yorkist England would be pretty hostile to the House of Anjou in Aragon. It'd certainly become a home for Lancastrian exiles. I don't think Edward IV would be actively opposed to Réne as he had a pretty peaceful foreign policy overall, but he won't be super friendly. He might lend a caring ear to John II but wouldn't do anything to help him.\n\nI also agree with the House of Anjou having some trouble getting situated. But John II won a lot of popular support through the betrothal of Ferdinand to Isabella -- so I think it might work similarly... I know many Aragonese magnates were quite happy with the marriage. I think his rule in Aragon might be a bit difficult, but Isabella would lend some popular support, I think. We might see some proto-form of the Comuneros of Charles V's reign, especially if the Lorrainers bring in a large retinue of foreigners into the country.\n\nThat's what I thought: I figured if Ferdinand was killed during the civil war, it'd give the French Party more leverage in Aragon.
