        "text": "After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8th century the king of the territories around Pamplona was reduced to tributary status. Later the kings of Pamplona succeeded in winning back considerable terrain and the kingdom attained its largest power and extent under Sancho III the Great (reigned 1000/41035) and his immediate successors. In the following centuries its territory was steadily reduced by attacks from its neighbours and by dynastical strife. In 1512 the main part of the kingdom was annexed by Aragon and incorporated into the Kingdom of Spain after a complete defeat of the royal navarrese army in 1521.\n\nNorth of the Pyrenees the ruling Albret dynasty could maintain its autonomy but nevertheless the territory was annexed by France in 1620.\n\nToday parts of the former kingdom belong to the spanish Comunidad Foral de Navarra (1981) and the french Département des Pyrénées Atlantiques, itself a part of the region of Aquitania (1982)\n\nStrictly speaking the early empires to which Pamplona belonged, were the Roman empire and the Visigothic empire, the symbol of which was a sun. The later Muslim Empire of Cordoba had also a sun for emblem, a tree symbolizing its territory.\n\nIt is only from the reign of Sancho III (1004-35) that we have a few coins showing a square cross on a pole (a cross-sceptre), rising from some foliage that can be considered to have been the symbol of the christian domain. The sceptre apparently was copied from visigothic coins. The foliage, copied from omayyad examples, perhaps has to represent the territory, making the symbol: the emblem of the domains of Sancho (III).\n\nCoin of Sancho III (1004-35)\n\nHead of Sancho III within the legend IMPERATOR. On the reverse a square cross on a pole rising from some foliage.\n\nAfter the division of the empire of Sancho III in 1035, the emblem of the domains was continued by his successors in Pamplona, Sancho IV (1054-76) and Sancho V of Aragon (1076-94)\n\nCoins struck in Pamplona, 1054-94\n\nHead of king Sancho within the legend SANCIUS X and a cross, pole and foliage on the reverse.\n\nLater the same picture appeared in Aragon on coins of Sancho Ramirez (1069-94) Alfonso I the Battler (1104-34); of James I (1213-76) (in Valencia) and of Alfonso V (1416-58) (in Rousillon).\n\nIn Leon and Castile it appeared on coins of Alfonso VII el Emperador (1126-57). The foliage on a little globe, without the square cross, was later held in hand by him and his son Ferdinand, and the pole cross and foliage again appeared on coins of his grandson Alfonso VIII of Castile (1158-1214).\n\nÆ This is as much as to say that the foliage, pole and cross was a joint emblem of the domains of a spanish ruler, comparable with the globe crested with a square cross in the frankish domains.\n\nThe Ruler. In the same way the ruler of Pamplona was the Roman Emperor, the Visigothic king and the Omayyad Caliph who were represented by their official portraits. The king of Pamplona and later Navarre can only be considered to be a ruler when his status of a vassal of the spanish empire had come to an end and sovereignty was attained.\n\nThis occurred for the first time at the end of the 12th century.\n\nTombstone of Sancho VI, the Wise (made 1194-1200)\n\nMuseo de León\n\nOf Sancho VI, who was buried in Pamplona Cathedral, a tombstone has been preserved showing him in official dress with sword, emblem of armed autority, a crown, emblem of administrative rank and a latin cross, symbol of religious authority. The legend sums up his name and titles: H SITO SANCI REX PIRENEOR MONEV TOLOSE CIR and that he was brought there by his son: TRANSLAT E H A FILIO SVO.\n\nAfter 1234 the ruler of Navarre was represented by his dynastical arms. It was however, only at the beginning of the 14th century that he was finally also represented as a ruler, that is crowned, seated on a throne and with the royal regalia in his hands.\n\nThe state traditionally consisted of three sections: the armed forces, the administration and the church, in the christian iconography represented by a christogram, a square cross and a latin cross. In the muslim tradition these sections were represented by a hexagram, a cup and an octogram or rub el hizb.\n\nFrom the first centuries of the existence of a separate kingdom of Pamplona we may assume that the latin cross, the square cross and the christogram were also used there. No early examples of these christian symbols however are available.\n\nFrom about the establishment of the Cortes of Navarre in the 13th century a full-grown state organization appeared in Navarre, consisting of the king in his role of head of state and the representations of the nobility, the people and the clergy (thebrazo eclesiástico, thebrazo militar and thebrazo de \"las universidades), more or less corresponding with the former sections.\n\nFrom about 1234 the state was represented by the arms of Navarre, in fact being the arms of the commander of the army as a pars-pro-toto.\n\nA second type consists of a latin cross (crux immissa) and a rho and symbolizes episcopal authority.\n\nThis type, quite common in the Visigothic era, is not found as yet in Pamplona-Aragon.\n\nHowever, the P cypher is the origin of the episcopal crozier of the shape introduced at the end of the 10th century and replacing the former early medieval croziers in the shape of a common pastoral staff or crook. A crozier was the badge of rank of bishops and abbots and of course was also used in Spain. [1]\n\nThe picture shows a bishop at the beginning of the 11th century in the Libro de los Testamentos, a chronicle about the history of the kings of Castile and Leon.\n\nChrist and St. Peter with his crozier.\n\nOn a reliquiary with scenes from the Holy Bible\n\nThessalonica, 2nd half of the 4th cent..\n\nArcheological Museum Thessalonica., Inv. nr. 10070.\n\nÅ Spanish bishop with crozier. 1st half of the 11th cent.\n\nA third type is a combination of a crux immissa and a chi-rho cypher and symbolizes episcopal authority combined with armed authority. This emblem can be the emblem of a prince-bishop or an abbot.\n\nOf this type of cypher there can be seen many in Pamplona-Aragon, but sometimes the bar of the crux immissa is hardly visible or is placed in the middle of the cypher.\n\nSuch a cypher often is the center of an achievement, the supporters being lions or angels.\n\nXP cypher set with precious stones (gemmata), charged with an Agnus Dei\n\nOn the head of the tomb of Sancha of Aragon in the Royal Benedictine Monastery, Jaca. about 1100.\n\nAt the feet of the same tomb are two griffins respecting, being the badges of Doña Sancha ranking her between a royal eagle and a comital or ducal lion.\n\nIn 1068 Sancho Ramirez traveled to Rome for the papal recognition of the Kingdom of Aragon and to offer it as a fief to the Holy See. According to the agreement the tribute would be 600 mark gold to be paid by Aragon the the Papal state.\n\nIt is said that at the occasion the red and gold of the ribbons of the papal bullae were adopted as the colors of Aragon, and should symbolize the vassalage of Aragon to the Holy See.\n\nIndeed the ribbons may have been red and gold/yellow and the Papal umbrella was also striped of these colors. Red and gold however, symbolized the temporal power of the Roman Empire in general and were also used by the Byzantine emperor and his vassals as well as by many rulers in the western half of the empire. Therefore, the papal umbrella symbolized the temporal power of the Pope as a ruler of the Papal State.\n\nAt the same time the colors of the pope as a (roman) religious leader were red and white, the white being the color of spiritual power.\n\nTherefore white and red were the colors of the Western Empire as understood as a Papal fief (for example also adopted by Charles II, the Bald (875-877)), and the banners of the Ecclesia were also of these colors.\n\nIt was right in the time of the offer of Sancho Ramirez that Pope Alexander II (1061-73) presented three specially blessed flags, one to Roger of Sicily (1072-1101), another, said to have been white with a red cross, to Erembald, captain of Milan in publico consistorio vexillum S. Petri Herembaldo dedit eumque Romanæ et Universæ Ecclesiæ vexilliferum fecit; and a third to William the Conqueror for his expedition to England (1065-66). [2] No such banner seems to have been presented to Sancho Ramirez.\n\nThere may be a slight possibility that in the first years of his rule, when he was only a king of Aragon, which was in fact a conglomerate of several counties and only a part of the former kingdom of Pamplona, he had a griffin for badge symbolizing a rank between a king and a count or duke or what would later be an arch-duke. Such a badge may have been the badge of all his siblings, of which Doña Sancha was one and his brother Garcia Ramirez the other. In any case, a griffin is closely connected with Doña Sancha as it is on her tomb. Sad to say no badges of rank of Sancho Ramirez have shown up until now.\n\nSancho Ramirez was King of Pamplona as Sancho V. After 1076 the kingdoms of Pamplona and Aragon remained ruled in personal union until 1134\n\nAfter the death of his elder brother Sancho Peter succeeded in Pamplona as well as in Aragon. He was militarily active against the Almoravids and granted privileges to some important cities. In 1096 After his second marriage in Huesca on 16 August 1097 he transferred his capital from Jaca to that city.\n\nPeter was buried alongside his children in the monastery of San Juan de la Peña, a religious complex in the town of Santa Cruz de la Serós. Later his tomb was transported to the Real Monasterio de Benedictinas, Jaca, where it is now. [3]\n\nThe tomb is lavishly decorated, the most important decorations from the point of view of heraldry being a large christogram, charged in the midde with a paschal lamb, two griffins respecting and a battle scene.\n\nPeter I on his tomb in the Royal Benedictine Monastery of Jaca.\n\nThe sculpture is a part of a scene probably of the battle of Jativa which he fought with Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, (El Cid) in 1095. Behind him is his son Peter (*1086-1104), then of the age of 11, riding a lion. His adversary is an almoravid general by name of Mohammed ibn Tashfin and a nephew of Yusuf ibn Tashfin (1061-1106), who has a crescent on his saddlecloth.\n\nPeter I wears a shield of norman shape on which is a buckle and four rivets. Such shields are depicted for example in the Libro de los Testamentos, compiled in Castile in the beginning of the 12th century. Norman shaped shields are usually blue there, the number of rivets varies.\n\nA shield charged with an emblem of office was probably introduced by Alfonso I who ruled in both Aragon and in Navarra and, for a short time, was also a commander in León.\n\nOn his seal he is depicted bearing a shield charged with a thunderbolt within the legend SIGILLVM REGIS ALDEFONS X.\n\nThe thunderbolt, certainly not by accident, has about the shape of the combined XPÈ symbol symbolizing royal authority but leaving out religious authority.\n\nSeal of Alfonso\n\nFig.: Knight on horseback, Arms: Thunderbolt. L. XSIGILLVM REGIS ALDEFONSI. (Valencia, Cathedral). [4]\n\nÆ By Ignacio Vicente Cascante this seal is ascribed to Alfonso VIII of Castile and dated 1163 when he was eight years old. For different reasons a dating at the beginning of the 12th century is more likely.\n\nIn the first place the knight has a conical nasal helmet on his head which is typical for the 11th-12th century but absolutely out of fashion in 1163. In the second place the knight is armed with a spear which also became outmoded in the beginning of the 12th century. In the third place the shield has the large measures of the 11th century norman shields.\n\nLast but not least the knight on the seal is certainly a grown up man and not a boy of eight.\n\nA candidate owner of this seal is Alfonso I el Batallador of Aragon, the second husband of Queen Urraca who ruled Castile and Leon between 1109 and 1114. Only in 1127 Alfonso VII succeeded in defeating him and took power in Castile.\n\nIn his will Alfonso left his kingdoms to the three Orders, the Hospitallers, the Templars and of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem. The will reads:\n\nEn nombre del bien más grande e incomparable que es Dios. Yo Alfonso, rey de Aragón, de Pamplona [...] pensando en mi suerte y reflexionando que la naturaleza hace mortales a todos los hombres, me propuse, mientras tuviera vida y salud, distribuir el reino que Dios me concedió y mis posesiones y rentas de la manera más conveniente para después de mi existencia. Por consiguiente temiendo el juicio divino, para la salvación de mi alma y también la de mi padre y mi madre y la de todos mis familiares, hago testamento a Dios, a Nuestro Señor Jesucristo y a todos sus santos. Y con buen ánimo y espontánea voluntad ofrezco a Dios, a la Virgen María de Pamplona y a San Salvador de Leyre, el castillo de Estella con toda la villa [...], dono a Santa María de Nájera y a San Millán [...], dono también a San Jaime de Galicia [...], dono también a San Juan de la Peña [...] y también para después de mi muerte dejo como heredero y sucesor mío al Sepulcro del Señor que está en Jerusalén [...] todo esto lo hago para la salvación del alma de mi padre y de mi madre y la remisión de todos mis pecados y para merecer un lugar en la vida eterna...\n\nThe will of Alfonso leaving his kingdom to the three orders was dismissed out of hand by the nobility of his kingdoms, and possible successors were sought. Alfonso's only brother, Ramiro, had been a Benedictine monk since childhood, and his commitment to the church, his temperament and vow of celibacy made him ill-suited to rule a kingdom under constant military threat and in need of a stable line of succession. The step-son of the deceased king, Alfonso VII of León, as reigning monarch and legitimate descendant of Sancho III of Navarre, put himself forward but garnered no local support. The nobility of Navarre aligned behind Peter of Atarés, the grandson of Alfonso's illegitimate uncle, while the Aragonese nobility rallied around the abbot-bishop Ramiro. A convention was called at Borja to develop a consensus, but there Peter so alienated his own partisans with perceived arrogance that they abandoned him, yet were unwilling to accept Ramiro. The convention broke up without arriving at a compromise and the two regional factions then acted independently.\n\nThe choice of the Navarrese lords fell on García Ramírez, Lord of Monzón, descendant of an illegitimate son of García Sánchez III and protégé of Alfonso VII to be their king. The Aragonese took Ramiro out of a monastery and made him king, marrying him without papal dispensation to Agnes, sister of the Duke of Aquitaine, then betrothing their newborn daughter to Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona, who was then named Ramiro's heir.\n\nÆTo Aragon\n\nInitially the royal arms of Navarre were the arms of office of the supreme commander of the armed forces of Navarre. At first this office was symbolized by a thunderbolt which was the usual emblem of a alférez, bailiff or commander of the army. When in 1196/97 Sancho VII was granted the royal title by the pope, this emblem was replaced by an eagle which was the emblem of a consul or military commander of the first rank. When in 1234 Sancho was succeeded by his nephew Theobald I of Champagne, the thunderbolt, usually called a carbuncle, was reintroduced.\n\nAt the same time, the (dynastical-) arms of the house of Blois to which the new king belonged, was introduced in Navarre.\n\nFrom this time on there exists a difference between the arms of Navarre as such, and the arms of the king of Navarre.\n\nBy treaty of Tordehumos of 20 April of 1194 as a result of the intervention of Pope Celestino and his legate, it was tried to make an end to the continuing hostilies between Castile and León. The intention of the Pope was to unite all spanish christian kingdoms into one coalition to stop the advance of the Almohades.\n\nThe coalition was a failure because Castile suffered a serious defeat against the Almohades the next year of which Sancho VII profited by occupying several Castilian territories. Sancho also allied with Leon which came to be at open war with Castile, Pope Celestinus ending the excommunication of Alfonso IX (1188-1230) to help. Sancho at the same time was asked to ally with Castile and Aragon.\n\nBy mediation of Alfonso II (1164-´96) of Aragon a meeting was arranged between the three kings, not so much to change the alliances but to prevent further attacks of Navarre. Some weeks later, on 29 march 1196 Celestino addressed a bull to Sancho in which he proposed to make an alliance of the kings of Spain (regibus Ispaniarum) which guaranteed the inviolability of Navarre and offered the partion of the conquered almohad territories together with a free access of Navarra to its received territories and freedom to plunder the musselmen.\n\nAn other bull of 28 May from the papal legate cardinal Gregorio announced the grant of the title of Rex Navarre to Sancho and the recognition of the Navarese monarchy by the Holy See which was pending since 1134 (when the nobility had chosen a royal candidate of their own). The ratification of the royal title took place by another bull (of 20 February 1197) in which Celestino III explained to Sancho that the grant was a special divine favour, not awarded to his predecessors, which made him a privileged son of the church of great dignity. [9]\n\nAfter this papal recognition of the royal dignity of Sancho, an eagle appeared on the royal seal, on his arms and as a part of his signature.\n\nSignature of Sancho VII on a document of 1209.\n\nArchivo de la Corona de Aragon. Pedro II pergamino n° 325.\n\nEagle on a privilege of Sancho VII granted to the citizens of Viana.\n\nTudela, april 1219.\n\nOn the seal the king has a shield charged with an eagle on his left arm. Om the reverse is the same eagle. Two prints of the seal are known the first of 1214 and the second dated 1225.[10]\n\nAfter the death of Sancho the Strong the people of Navarra ignored his will by which James I of Aragon was appointed his successor. Instead they appointed his nephew Thibaut V Posthumus of Champagne who was in Pamplona at the time of Sancho's death. He became king of Navarre as Thibaut I.\n\nBecause of this irregularity, being not his legal heir, Thibaut did not inherit the arms with the eagle of Sancho. Instead he adopted a coat of arms resembling the arms from the time between 1134 and 1197 when the recognition of the royal title of Aragon was also pending.\n\nThis was a version of a thunderbolt on a red shield.\n\nAn early representation of this shield is on a statue of him riding on a horse, and dressed in coat of mail, completed with a helmet of the shape of the late Sancho. In front of him are representatives of the people of Navarra, probably of the jewish and muslim communities, paying homage to him.\n\nThe people of Tudela paying homage to Theobaldo I.\n\nSo-called Caballico de Santiago said to reperesent Sancho the Strong at Las Navas de Tolosa\n\nHospital de Tudela (Coll. Museo Decanal de Tudela.)\n\nOn a tomb said to have been for Alfonso X of Castile, coats of arms are carved which very much look like the arms of Navarre in that the are charged with a gyronny of narrow lines, with a diamond in the middle. The bordure in this case is quite wide. The tomb, from the Monastery of Huelgas, is an enigma because it is not documented how it came to be in Castile and for whom it could have been destined. In all probability it has been the tomb of Thibaut I in Pamplona cathedral and was transported or sold to the monastery at any time, for example during the reign of Charles the Noble (1387-1425) who let reconstruct most of the Cathedral at the cost of its bishop. The counterpart of the tomb is the socalled Tomb of Princess Christina in the Colegiata de San Cosme y San Damián de Covarrubias which is decorated in the same way but for the shields. Probably this tomb has been the tomb of queen Margaret of Bourbon (1256).\n\nSo-called Tomb of Alfonso X the Wise in Las Huelgas Monastery\n\nThe tomb supported by (royal) eagles.\n\nOn a seal of uncertain date the thunderbolt and the bordure are composed of besants or little discs, the diamond also moved upwards:\n\nSeal [and counterseal] of Thibaut I [13]\n\nSeal: Knight on horseback with sword and shield. Arms: Navarre. L.: X S' THEOBALDI / DEI:GRA[ ] BRIE:CO(m)ITIS:PALATINI\n\nCounterseal: Arms: Blois. L.: X PASSE.AVANT.LA.THIEBAUT.\n\nIn the middle of the 16th century the carbuncle composed of a gironny and an orle of besants was replaced by such a figure made up of golden chains. This goes back to the story telling that at the battle of Las Navas the encampment of Mohamed ben Yusuf was defended by a triple fence of a palisade linked by chains, waggons also linked by chains and negros chained together. After the battle Sancho the Strong returned home loaded with these chains which he distributed between Pamplona, the church of Roncevalles, the Great Chapel of Irache and the Santa Maria in Tudela. Since then, he charged the red shield of his predecessors with golden chains with an emerald in the middle. [16]\n\nThis story has its roots in a letter of Blanche of Castile, wife of Alfonso VIII to Blanche of Navarre, wife of Thibaut III which relates the storming of the palisades of Miramolin. The story was copied by the 14th century chronicler Garcia de Eugui in his Genealogy of the kings of Navarre (1409 ca) and later in the Chronicle of the Prince of Viana (1454 ca).\n\nIn 1556 the idea was adopted by the artist Juan de Villareal. He made the achievement above the entrance of the Hospital de Nuestra Señora de la Misericorda opposite the Royal Palace in Pamplona. This showed the arms with the chains, crowned and supported by two fauns. Somewhat later the story was canonized by Geronimo Zurita in his Annals of the Kingdom of Navarra (1562), and copied by Joseph Moret (1665) and others.\n\nPhoto Flickr\n\nAchievement of Navarra, 1556\n\nBy Juan la Villareal. Now above the entrance of the Museum of Pamplona.\n\nBy treaty of Barcelona of 1455, her father deposed her brother Charles of Viana (*1421) and her sister Blanche (*1424) as heirs of Navarre. Instead he proclaimed Eleanor and Gaston IV of Foix-Bearn as his successors and as regent and governor general of Navarre. When he died in 1479, she became the new queen of Navarre, and died two weeks later, at Tudela, Navarre, aged 53.\n\nThe arms of Eleonor were at all probability the same as those of her father being a tierced of Navarre, Evreux and Albuquerque. Those of her husband Gaston of Foix-Bearn were initially the quarterly of Foix and Bearn with the arms of Bigorre (Or, two lions passant Gules) on an escutcheon.\n\nAfter his proclamation as a successor in Navarre in 1455, his arms were augmented with the quarters of Navarre-Evreux but he died seven years before his father in law.\n\nArms of Gaston IV, 1455. [23]\n\nAs a heiress of Gaston IV, Eleonor could combine her own arms with those of her husband by adding the arms of Albuquerque.\n\nIn 1505 Ferdinand the Catholic married secondly Germaine of Foix, the daughter of Catherine's uncle John of Foix (1446-1500), who had attempted to claim Navarre over his deceased elder brother's under-age children. However, their son died shortly after birth, ending hopes of potentially inheriting Navarre.\n\nWhen Navarre refused to join one of many Holy Leagues against France and declared itself neutral, Ferdinand asked the Pope to excommunicate John of Albret, which would have legitimised his attack. When the Pope refused, Ferdinand fabricated a false bull and invaded Navarre in 1512. Unable to face the powerful Castilian-Aragonese army, Jean d'Albret fled to Pau, and Pamplona, Estella, Olite, Sanguesa, and Tudela were captured. Some months later king John returned with an army recruited north of the Pyrenees and attacked Pamplona without success.\n\nAfter this failure, the Navarrese Cortes (Parliament) had to accept annexation to Castile, which agreed to keep Navarrese autonomy and identity. In 1513, the first Castilian viceroy took an oath to respect Navarrese law (fueros).\n\nNevertheless there was a first attempt at liberation in 1516 supported by popular rebellion.\n\nThe arms of Germaine of Foix after her marriage with Ferdinand were:\n\nMedal with the arms of Germaine of Foix, 1505.\n\nArms: Per pale: I. ¼: 1&4: Quarterly of Castile and Leon. 2&3: Impaled of Aragon and Sicily-Trinacria.

And an escutcheon of Bigorre over all.\n\nCrown: A royal crown of seven leaves.\n\nThe arms are between the royal cyphers of Ferdinand and Germaine.\n\nThe legend on the medal reads: POVR LA ROYNE DARRAGON, continued on the reverse: GARDEZ VOVS DE MESCONTENTER (For the Queen of Aragon, beware of being dissatisfied).\n\nAchievement of Ferdinand of Aragon after 1512.\n\nIn its second great quarter the arms of Navarre are added.\n\nThe last independent king of Navarre, Henry II (reigned 15721610), succeeded to the throne of France as Henry IV in 1589, founding the Bourbon dynasty.\n\nIn the arms of Henry II as a king of Navarre etc. nine quarters were combined in the sequence of the first seal of his parents:\n\nMedal of Henri II, 1582\n\nHis arms were:\n\nArms: A chief per pale of four: 1.

The title of King of Navarre continued to be used by the Kings of France until the French Revolution in 1792, and was revived again during the Restoration, 181430.\n\nTo be Continued at Æ France"
