        "text": "http://en.fundacionmedinaceli.org/casaducal/fichaindividuo.aspx?id=618\n\n===============\n\nJuan II de Aragón, el Grande (Medina del Campo, Castilla, 29 de junio de 1398 - Barcelona; 20 de enero de 1479) fue duque de Peñafiel, rey de Navarra (1425 - 1479) y rey de Aragón, de Cerdeña y de Sicilia (1458 - 1479), hijo de Fernando I de Antequera y de Leonor Urraca de Castilla, condesa de Alburquerque. Juan II se destaca como uno de los monarcas más longevos y memorables del siglo XV.\n\nJohn II the Great (June 29, 1397 – January 20, 1479) was the King of Aragon (1458–1479) and a King of Navarre (1425–1479). He was the son of Ferdinand I and his wife Eleanor of Alburquerque. John is regarded as one of the most memorable and most unscrupulous kings of the 15th century.\n\nIn his youth he was one of the infantes (princes) of Aragon who took part in the dissensions of Castile during the minority and reign of John II. Till middle life he was also lieutenant-general in Aragon for his brother and predecessor Alfonso V, whose reign was mainly spent in Italy. In his old age he was engaged in incessant conflicts with his Aragonese and Catalan subjects, with Louis XI of France, and in preparing the way for the marriage of his son Ferdinand with Isabella of Castile which brought about the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile, that was to create the Kingdom of Spain. His trouble with his subjects were closely connected with the tragic dissension in his own family.\n\nJohn was first married to the Queen Blanche of Navarre of the house of Évreux. By right of Blanche he became king of Navarre, and on her death in 1441 he was left in possession of the kingdom for his lifetime. But a son, Charles, given the title \"Prince of Viana\" as heir of Navarre, had been born of the marriage. John quickly came to regard his son with jealousy. After his second marriage, to Juana Enríquez, this grew into absolute hatred and was encouraged by Juana. John tried to deprive his son of his constitutional right to act as lieutenant-general of Aragon during his father's absence. Charles's cause was taken up by the Aragonese, and the king's attempt to make his second wife lieutenant-general was set aside.\n\nThere followed a long conflict, with alternations of success and defeat, ending only with the death of the prince of Viana, perhaps by poison given him by his stepmother, in 1461. The Catalans, who had adopted the cause of Charles and who had grievances of their own, called in a succession of foreign pretenders. King John spent his last years contending with these. He was forced to pawn Roussillon, his possession on the north-east of the Pyrenees, to King Louis XI of France, who refused to part with it.\n\nIn his old age John was blinded by cataracts, but recovered his eyesight by the operation of couching conducted by his physician Abiathar Crescas, a Jew. The Catalan revolt was pacified in 1472, but John carried on a war, in which he was generally unfortunate, with his neighbour the French king till his death in 1479. He was succeeded by Ferdinand, his son by his second marriage, who was already associated with his wife Isabella as joint sovereign of Castile.\n\n[edit] Children\n\nFrom his first marriage to Blanche of Navarre:\n\n* Carlos of Viana (1421-1461)\n\n* Juana of Aragon (1423-1425)\n\n* Blanca of Navarre (1420-1464) married Henry IV of Castile. The marriage was never consummated. After 13 years of marriage, Henry sought and obtained a divorce. Blanca was sent home, where her family imprisoned her, and she was later killed by poison.\n\n* Eleanor, Queen of Navarre\n\nFrom his second marriage to Juana Enríquez:\n\n* Fernando II of Aragon\n\n* Infanta Juana of Aragon (1454-1517). Married Ferdinand I of Naples.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nOrigem: Wikipédia, a enciclopédia livre\n\nJohn II (Catalan: Joan II, Aragonese: Chuan II and Basque: Joanes II), called the Great (el Gran) or the Faithless (el Sense Fe) (29 June 1398 – 20 January 1479), was the King of Navarre through his wife (jure uxoris) from 1425 and the King of Aragon in his own right from 1458 until his death. He was the son of Ferdinand I and his wife Eleanor of Alburquerque. More: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_II_of_Aragon_and_Navarre\n\n(Wikipedia) Juan II de Aragón, el Grande, o Juan sin Fe según los revolucionarios catalanes que se alzaron contra él,2​ (Medina del Campo, Castilla, 29 de junio de 1398-Barcelona; 20 de enero de 1479) fue duque de Peñafiel, rey de Navarra (1425-1479), rey de Sicilia (1458-1468) y rey de Aragón, de Mallorca, de Valencia, de Cerdeña (1458-1479), hijo de Fernando I de Antequera y de Leonor de Alburquerque, condesa de Alburquerque. Fue padre, entre otros, de Fernando el Católico.\n\nJuan II fue uno de los monarcas más longevos del siglo xv —su enemigo Luis XI de Francia le llamó vieja «vulpeja»​. Padeció de cataratas por lo que durante varios años estuvo ciego, hasta que el 12 de octubre de 1468, a la edad de 70 años, recuperó la vista gracias al judío catalán Cresques Abiabad que le operó los dos ojos.\n\nNació el 29 de junio de 1398 en Medina del Campo (Reino de Castilla). Su padre era Fernando de Trastámara, segundo hijo del rey de Castilla y que cuando nació Juan contaba con dieciocho años de edad, y su madre Leonor de Alburquerque, tía de Fernando y sobrina del fundador de la dinastía Trastámara el rey Enrique II de Castilla. Fue el segundo de siete hermanos: Alfonso, Enrique, Sancho, Leonor, María y Pedro. Según Jaume Vicens Vives, «la circunstancia de que naciera en el corazón de Castilla y fuera segundogénito de un segundón, imprimió huellas indelebles en su carácter, su psicología y sus ambiciones. Fue un castellano de pura cepa, vinculado a Castilla por su nacimiento y por sus gustos y, asimismo por los intereses materiales que recibió en ella."
