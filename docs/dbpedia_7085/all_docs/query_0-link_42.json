They were half third cousin once removed. She a great x 3 granddaughter of King Edward III of England.\n\nLetters. 11 Jan 1513. Ferdinand King of Aragon (age 60) to Pedro De UREA, his Ambassador at the Imperial Court.\n\nShows that the treaty which the Cardinal of Gurk (age 45) has, with the consent of Urea and Vich, concluded at Rome, by excluding the Venetians, undoes all that has been done against France. Henceforth they must make no binding declaration without consulting Ferdinand. Had the English followed his plan they would now be masters of Guienne; and, like them, the Emperor has now hindered the accomplishment of his own wishes and made France stronger. Takes this as a command from God for Christian princes to unite in reforming the Church, and has therefore devised the measures explained in instructions sent by Beltrian. Gurk is to be shown the instructions, but not this letter. If the King of France (age 50) offers Madame Renée (age 2) as security, or offers to put fortresses in trust of third persons, Urea shall point out to the Emperor how little these offers are to be trusted. The marriage of Prince Charles (age 12) with the King of England's (age 21) sister (age 16) must not be broken off; or France will gain the King of England (age 21), to the detriment of Spain and the House of Burgundy. Another essential condition is that all acts of the schismatical Council be annulled. Is glad to hear of the meeting between the Emperor and the King of England, whose alliance is both the guarantee that France will keep peace if concluded and the most valuable support in case of war.\n\nHall's Chronicle 1492. Shortely after this Charles the French King concluded a league with Ferdinand King of Spain, and also being entreated and solicited with the orations of diverse princes, which, persuaded and mollified the stony heart of a frozen prince, caused him to come to communication and treaty with Maximilian King of Romans, and to conclude a peace with him for a season, to the intent that he might without disturbance of his neighbours adjoining, prosperously and safely make war on Ferdinand King of Naples, and on all Italy, as he before had minded and excogitated."
