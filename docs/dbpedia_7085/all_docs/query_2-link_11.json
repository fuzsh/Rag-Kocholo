        "text": "Part 2 – Principe\n\nChapter 8 – 1500 to 1502\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Viana remained in Navarre until the spring of 1500. On the 9th of march the preparations to leave for Aragon begun, with packing of clothes and possessions for both Fernando and Eleanor, while King Ferdinand would remain in the kingdom. While this absence from Queen Isabel was the longest one since the marriage, the importance of annexing Navarre properly was clear to both monarchs. Isabel had moved her court to the heart of Old Castile after Christmas of 1499. During the campaigns in Navarre, she had resided in Zaragosa to monitor the situation and she had taken care in welcoming the Archbishop of Toledo and the Duke of Nájera back with great pomp. and right now, she resided in Medina del Campo. Castile had cheered as Navarre fell and the marriage between Fernando and Eleanor was viewed with great favour by near all. Unlike Margaret of Austria, the new princess was of Spanish birth and custom and she had brought a third kingdom as a dowry.\n\nTraveling around in Spain was arduous, as the steep terrain, mountains and battered remains of the ancient roman roads did not help either. The royal family travelled by horses, mules or litters born by men or animals, as the four wheeled carriages of other European lands fell foul. While Fernando rode his white mare, Eleanor had been given a trusted mule for the road. The princess took a large circle of attendants with her to Spain, including several young ladies of good families that had been part the court of Navarre. Her request to bring her governess had been granted, and an assortment of courtiers and servants followed her. Their company seemed to cheer Eleanor up more, as she at least did not have to enter Spain alone with no friendly faces besides her. Leaving King Ferdinand behind was also a relief to her. Her father-in-law was an imposing and frightening man to a twelve-year-old girl in a conquered kingdom. Instead, she warmed very slowly up to her young husband. Prince Fernando might be stern at times to many, but Eleanor saw his softer side more and more. They had a shared interest in literature and animals, and while Fernando had little inclination to musical instruments himself, Eleanor was a skilled player of the lute, mandore and clavichord. Fernando seemed found of listening to her playing in the evenings and by the time of the departure, they had settled into a more companionable state. Perhaps as a result of the turbulence and loss of her family, Eleanor showed a greater interest in religion from 1500, especially the religious movement of Devotio Moderna that had originated in the Low Countries in the 15th century and had spread all across Europe. The movement aimed for religious reforms through practising humility, simplicity and community engagement. Prayers, reflections and contemplation was part of the everyday life of the followers, and many established religious orders encouraged it, such as the Augustinians, the Greyfriars and the Poor Clares. The movement had inspired the Dutch-German churchman Thomas van Kempen in writing his famous book: The Imitation of Christ. The book had been published in the Duchy of Burgundy and spread around the Low Countries in the 1470s and it reached Spain in 1490. Upon her arrival in Flanders in 1496, Juana of Castile had been given an illuminated manuscript as a wedding gift by Margaret of York, a noted follower of the movement and reformer in Burgundy. Isabel had commissioned a copy for all her daughters and now Eleanor would receive her own. The book was beautifully illuminated by artists in Castile that had found a patron in the queen, who commissioned paintings of the life of Christ and his death. In the beginning of the year of 1500, Isabel ordered another religious book made up for her daughter-in law; Garden of Noble Maidens. The lessons of those had been dedicated to Isabel in 1468 by Fray Martin de Córdoba. Isabel did not take all the lessons to heart, but it was a proper gift to Eleanor to prepare her for the future role as Queen of Castile.\n\nFernando and Eleanor were greeted by large crowds as they approached Medina del Campo, where a large royal entourage awaited them, dressed in rich clothes and holding banners of the catholic monarchs. The prince and princess stopped at the Saint Miguel’s church as they arrived in the city, both to give thanks for their travels and to change their clothes, as the dust of the roads clung to them. Eleanor found herself surrounded by royal ladies and maids, armed with new luxurious garments, shoes and headwear. Eleanor was used to the silks royalty wore, as travellers and merchants frequently passed through Navarre on pilgrimages or business. Silks, velvets and fine linen was worn by Catherine and John and their children, but the garments she was offered now was at another level. Isabel knew the importance of appearance and had ordered a whole new wardrobe for Eleanor in various Spanish styles. Fine linen chemises with blackwork decorating the collar and sleeves, gamurras in green, scarlet, purples and blues and gowns, Spanish farthingales, chopines and slippers, cloth of gold and silver garments, silk veils and lace mantillas. And jewelry. Large amounts of jewelry in all shapes and sizes worth a future queen. Necklaces of gold stuttered with rubies, strings of pearls, silver rings and gems set in pendants, brooches, gem encrusted girdles and others sorts of priceless objects was given to Eleanor, leaving the girl very dazzled.\n\nClothed in new garments and jewelry, Fernando and Eleanor left Saint Miguel’s church to proceed to the royal palace where the Queen and court awaited them. By this time evening had fallen. This suited the Castilian court just fine, as the natural drama of dusk provided a staging for the ostentatious affairs the court could turn on suddenly and explosively to overawe guests of importance. The city was lined with men and women of all classes, standing outside their homes or shops, many holding lanterns and candles in their hands, and torches had been lit in the city. Bishops, counts and knights welcomed them to the royal castle, and into the courtyard where the Queen awaited surrounded by numerous lords and ladies. The welcoming of Eleanor had been carefully choreographed for that of a future queen, but it also masked the reality of her situation. Unlike Margaret of Austria, who no doubt would have arrived with a mighty entourage made up of imperial and Flemish courtiers from Vienna and Malines, Eleanor’s smaller circle was not as impressive. The emperor’s only daughter would bring an imperial dowry and the riches of the Low Countries packed in chests and coffins, while the new bride came with few possessions and such a minor dowry it was almost pitiful in comparison. Eleanor came with no alliance, no riches and no military support. Her situation was not uncommon at this time, other heiresses had wed into ruling houses, such as Mary of Burgundy, Elizabeth of York and Anne of Brittany. Unlike those, Eleanor’s situation was far worse. Mary had brought the wealth of the Burgundian lands to her impoverished imperial groom, elevating the Hapsburgs into one of the greatest Houses in Europe. Elizabeth’s hand in marriage had launched the Tudors from exile in Brittany to the throne of England and Anne had brought her long-desired duchy to the crown of France. Upon her wedding to Charles VIII, Anne had worn a costly outfit described as:\n\n“dressed in a gown of black velvet and satin, costing over 60,000 francs, and swathed in a velvet cloak, trimmed with 139 sable pelts…. Even more extravagant was Anne’s wedding dress – of ‘drap d’or trait-enlevé’– a type of figured cloth-of-gold, at 7,350 francs the yard, trimmed with sables.”\n\nEleanor came with a complicated claim to Navarre as her parents and only brother still lived, even exiled in France and while her parents had provided her with a decent trousseau as she left Navarre for the French borders, it could not match the richness of either Burgundy, France or Spain. But to the Castilians, she was more than welcome and to Isabel, a solace. The death of Prince Juan four years ago had torn her heart in pieces and despite her love for Fernando, his elder brother had been the apple of their mother’s eye. The departures of Isabella, Juana and Maria had also been difficult ones as Fernando was the sole child remaining in Spain of hers. Isabella was easier to keep in contact with, as Portugal was the neighbouring kingdom and she had seen her more than once since the marriage. All the daughters of the Catholic Monarchs were flourishing for the most part, even as news came from Flanders about Juana’s difficult marriage to Philip. Isabella was happy in Portugal with Alfonso and their three children. Juana’s son had begun to toddle around in the nursery in Malines and Maria delighted in her life in Naples, and in her daughter. With Fernando’s marriage to Eleanor, all children had now found their spouses in their respective places. For Isabel, Eleanor became not only a daughter-in law, but a surrogate daughter to care for. Eleanor had been educated by her parents, but not to the same extent the Spanish infantas had been. She knew a little latin and could speak fluent French and Catalan, and some Castilian as well. Eleanor lacked no practical skill in running a household, but she was unprepared for such grand ones as Isabel and Ferdinand’s and thus she required extra lessons. In music and sewing she was every bit as accomplished as any princess, but her humanist education was poor. Being raised in a country in the middle of a civil war had not made things easier and Isabel saw to it that she was given Italian tutors and recalled Beatriz Galindo, La Latina to ensure that the future queen learned well. Another young woman that Isabel had taken under her wings was Luisa de Medrano, a well-educated young woman of 16. She was the younger sister of Catalina de Medrano, a cultured lady in Isabel’s service. In 1499 she married Hernando de Rojas y Sandoval, the brother of the Marquis of Denia and both became part of Fernando and Eleanor’s household later. Catalina and Luisa’s brothers Diego and Garci López de Medrano also came to court in 1500, and both young men, eight and seven years older than the prince became trusted friends of Fernando. Catalina and Luisa became both friends and tutors to Eleanor in her first year at court. Her circle of ladies also included two young women named Maria, Maria de Mendoza and Maria Salinas, and Eleanor’s cousin, Germaine of Foix who had come to Spain in 1496 with her brother. Gaston had quickly become a companion of Fernando and was amongst one of the people he trusted wholehearted. Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Zúñiga, the second son of the Duke of Alba, Luis Hurtado de Mendoza y Pacheco, the son of the Count of Tendilla and Pedro Pacheco de Villena, the nephew of the Marques de Villena also made up the companions of the prince.\n\nThe Italian humanist, Peter Martyr d'Anghiera became a tutor to Eleanor after her arrival, as he was well learned and had taught at the University of Salamanca. The princess seemed to find him an interesting person and she soaked up all the new education she was given. The Portuguese dancing teachers taught Eleanor well and she and her ladies delighted in the lessons. Her joy came crashing down in the beginning of summer as news came from France. Catherine of Navarre had successfully delivered a son in the end of April, but she herself had passed away days after the birth from fevers and uncontrollable bleedings. The news reached the court until the second week of June, as they were an route to Extremadura. Isabel was once more on the road as she always was and the destination was the moorish citadel of Alcazaba of Badajoz, where the catholic monarchs had expanded the palace complex in the past years. Isabel had just reached the Monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe when a rider arrived with a letter from her husband. The monastery had become an oasis that Isabel had discovered in 1477 during the War of the Castilian succession as she strode to take control of Extremadura and Seville against the rebellious lords. The monastery was beautifully seated in the eastern foot of the Sierra de Villuercas Mountain range and its warm reddish brick shone in the sun. The chapel of the monastery was a national shrine to the Virgin herself and the cult connected nationality and religion in Castile. Alfonso XI had fulfilled a vow to the Virgin before the Battle of Tarifa against the moors alongside King Alfonso IV of Portugal in 1340 and since then it had been not only a devotional centre, but also a bulwark by the Portuguese border. For the Castilian monarchs Guadalupe held many attractions; it was the Hieronymite Friars headquarters since 1389, an order that valued education and held influence in the court of Spain and Portugal, it served as a depository for valuables, a school and a library was housed there, and the monks served as lawyers in many ways. Guadalupe was a musical haven, especially for Isabel who loved the type of music played there. With its enormous amounts of sheep and cattle, manufacturing centre of fabric and leather, mills, timber, beehives amongst others, it was exactly the model of administration the Queen admired the most. The monastery also housed a medical centre with friars skilled in surgery, medicine and anatomy, at Isabel had consulted in her desire to have a son in 1477. Now that son was dead and she arrived with her current heir and Eleanor as well. Isabel found Guadalupe both a haven and a health clinic during her reign and called it “my paradise”. She wished for Eleanor to get to know it as well, and thus the court rested for a few weeks upon their arrival in the palace she had built from 1487 to 1491. Eleanor was very delighted to explore the immense monastery and the beautifully built palace, with decorated rooms and ornate halls. The view from her chamber was of the beautiful mountain range and the palace servants had decorated it with flowers from the nearby countryside, much to her delight.\n\nThe rider brought a letter from King Ferdinand about the death of the Queen of Navarre. At this time Isabel and Ferdinand had been separated for near eight months, the longest time in their marriage. Ferdinand had left Navarre for Aragon in beginning of April and planned to join his wife in Castile when the news reached him in Barcelona. While he would have loved for nothing less than go back to Isabel, the situation in Navarre required him to head back. While Catherine’s death was a victory for the Castilians, the birth of a second son was a blow. If the infant grew to adulthood, he could be another rallying point to retake Navarre with French support. Henri was sickly, but even he had lived past the cradle and now had reached the age of four. His betrothal to Helene of Valois worried the catholic monarchs as she would certainly bring a French army streaming across the Pyrenees in a few years. And should he die, the new baby boy would certainly replace him as a groom for Helene.\n\nEleanor found out about her mother’s death from Isabel, who got the letter first. The news came as such a shock that the princess fainted before the queen, much to her fear. Fernando came running as a messenger had rushed of to fetch him and he carried his wife to her bed. The court physician was quickly called to her side, and Eleanor remained in bed for the next few days, stricken with grief. As the eldest child, she had been closest to her mother and admired her greatly, especially as the raging civil war tore the kingdom apart. Eleanor had suffered a great deal over the turbulence in 1499 and Catherine’s escape to France, essentially abandoning her only daughter had impacted Eleanor deeply. All those feelings, bottled up and twisted into knots of agony came crashing down on the princess with the news. Not only would it never be resolved between them, but her brothers were now her main competitors for the throne and her father had forsaken her and Spain for a bargain with France. Eleanor’s grief that summer mingled with rage and she turned to her spouse for support. Fernando, she knew, would not hesitate to raise arms against King John if push came to show for Navarre. Neither would king Ferdinand, who spent the whole summer in the cities of Pamplona and Olite.\n\nBy autumn of 1500, more news came to Spain. Duchess Juana had announced her second pregnancy in late September, much to the court’s joy. In England, the betrothal between Henry, Prince of Wales and Infanta Eleanor of Portugal was announced in the middle of August in Richmond Palace. The negotiations between King John II and King Henry VII had been intense ones, but the marriage date had been set for 1506 when both children would be fifteen. In France, King Charles VIII began to seek the hand of one of Emperor Maximilian’s nieces for the dauphin, focusing on Sibylle or Sabina, both nearer in age to Charles Orlando then the oldest, Sidonie whom was four years older than him.\n\nEleanor lost another family member just before Christmas. Henri died, having caught pneumonia from sneaking outside to play in the cold rain at his grandfather’s castle in Tartas. The death of his eldest son was yet another blow to King John, as the sole child aside from Eleanor was the infant Charles Phoebus that remained of Catherine. Should he perish too, then the cause for retaking Navarre would be gone forever. True to his words, Charles VIII settled the betrothal of his daughter Helene to the baby claimant, but the whispers in court belied the rumour that the king no longer had his heart set on founding a war that rested solely on the health of an infant in the cradle. Helene’s hand could be given elsewhere, such as Burgundy, as Charles of Ghent was a better match for her. Philip the Handsome had begun to contemplate such an alliance after Helene’s birth as well. A French princess for his heir was a tempting thought and it would also sting in the eyes of his arrogant Spanish in laws who has sneered at his beloved sister for their son in 1496 and also had schemed to steal the king of Naples from Margaret as well. Maximilian had contemplated the match after Fernandino II’s death, as it would give the Hapsburgs much needed influence in the Italian peninsula and the papacy, but Ferdinand II had been quicker in arranging the wedding between his nephew and daughter. In 1500, Margaret found herself a groom for the third time. The king of Bohemia and Hungary had just become available as his fraudulent marriage to Beatrice of Naples was annulled by pope Alexander VI. Maximilian wasted no time in offering the hand of his twenty-year-old daughter to the king who desperately needed an heir and Vladislaus accepted it. For Margaret, once promised to the crown princes of France and of Spain, becoming the third wife of a king near twenty-five years older was a depressing prospect. Her step-grandmother Margaret consoled her as she herself had been the third wife of Charles the Bold in 1468 and while that match had been childless, she had enjoyed a good life despite all the strife she had endured. For her journey towards Prague, Philip made sure his sister would come with a proper dowry and trousseau, benefiting an imperial bride. Maximilian had promised his daughter a dowry of 100,000 Rhenish gulden and Margaret brought Flemish tapestries, illustrated manuscripts, and a sumptuous wardrobe with her to the wedding. Philip himself escorted his sister to Prague where the siblings meet their father once more and both father and son attended the royal wedding and the festivities that followed. Philip lingered in Germany for a few weeks and attended the Reichstag next to the emperor before returning to the Low Countries.\n\nThe question of whether or not to ally with France was a point of contention between father and son. Philip was leaning towards Helene of Valois for his toddler son, while Maximilian wished for a match with England or Giovanna of Naples. Maximilian was however considering one of his nieces for the dauphin as Eleanor of Portugal was no longer on the market. While Sidonie of Bavaria was promised to Louis of the Palatinate, Sibylle or Sabina would both be good options. While Maximilian had promised Sabina to Ulrich of Württemberg, she and Sibylle could be switched around depending on what Charles VIII decided on. As the only son of the king, Sibylle would be the preferable choice as she would be ready for childbearing when the dauphin came of marriageable age in 1506 and could provide children for France earlier. Albert IV of Bavaria was rather amendable for his one of his daughters to become queen of France as well, but wanted the emperor to aid in the dowry as Bavaria could not wholly appropriate for France and Maximilian accepted that. Charles VIII spent a lot of months in negotiations with Albret and Maximilian during the year of 1500 and the parties came to an agreement for the match. Sibylle would bring 150,000 Rhenish gulden to her marriage with Charles Orlando and the date of the wedding was to take place in 1506. Anne of Brittany was not happy with the match at all, as she loathed the prospect of having a uncultured German as a daughter in law and she made her feelings clear to the king, who shouted back at her at unless she could conjure a royal princess out of thin air for their son, she would have to be satisfied with Sibylle as an imperial proxy. Discontent in Brittany also erupted as the estates in the duchy did not like the idea of a Bavarian born duchess either and rumours spread around the court about the future match. The dowager duchess of Angouleme also caught wind and decided to return to court with a bold plan; to make her daughter a prospective dauphine. Her late husband, Duke Charles had left her with two children, Marguerite and Francois, now at the age of nine and seven. While the succession was secured with the Dauphin, should Charles Orlando die before having heirs of his own, Louise’s son stood to inherit the throne as the Duke of Orléans had no children. Even if Francois was not to be king, him being in a position in court would benefit the family and Louise had her eye on some plum heiress for her darling boy as well. As for her daughter, no one could call Marguerite uncultured or lacking as the German girl in Bavaria. Louise had taken her children to Cognac where the Italian influence was very strong and both had learned latin amongst other subjects. Knowing that Charles VIII had a taste for the Italian culture and arts, Louise felt her daughter would have the advantage to Sybille even if she was not a royal princess. Marguerite and Charles Orlando were also the same age so they could be married in 1506 with no trouble. Louise also benefited from her relationship with Anne of France, the former regent for Charles. She had educated Louise alongside Margaret of Austria, then betrothed to the young king and Anne still held influence over her brother.\n\nAnne de Beaujue, Duchess of Bourbon and regent of France\n\nDespite all that, Louise had to tread carefully when she returned to the court. She did have one figure who could prove a fatal enemy residing there: The Queen. Anne of Brittany was well aware of the ambitions and she did not like Louise much and while she loathed the idea of a German daughter-in law, the Angouleme girl being her son’s bride was just as bad. Louise would simply show herself as a humble woman seeking to secure her children’s future to avoid the queen’s wrath while she attempted to accomplish the goal. The king was the key, as it would ultimately be his decision. The Christmas celebration of 1500 was the perfect staging ground for Louise’s return to the royal court of Amboise and she came prepared. The Angouleme family came wearing festive clothes made up in the Italian style that was popular for the noble classes in the kingdom at this time. Marguerite wore clothes of costly fabric from Milan in silks and brocades, that set of her dark hair perfectly. The gifts she had prepared for the king and queen were carefully considered, for Anne she had produced a selection of books written by Italian humanists and for the king, an ornate goblet from Milan. Before the court she pleaded her cause, as a widow with young children that sought nothing else but to secure the future of her son and daughter. Her plan worked, as Marguerite got a place as one of the queen’s ladies and Francois joined the king’s household. While Anne would normally be suspicious of her motives, right now she felt pretty secure as the dauphin had turned eight and Helene had just turned one years old. She could afford to be gracious right now.\n\nAnother person who came to court was John III of Navarre, the fugitive king. He had come to personally meet the king to plead his own cause; namely the retaking of his kingdom. The deaths of Queen Catherine and Prince Henri had been near fatal blows to his ambitions, and the French alliance was being held by a thread. Charles Phoebus, Prince of Viana in mere name, had been named for the king himself and the glorious god of the sun of the ancient time as a way to honour and flatter him. Charles and Anne had stood as godparents to him as well, and the baby was still betrothed to Helene, their only daughter. But the death of Catherine and Henri had cooled the king’s interest in the match and it was known that French ambassadors had been instructed to inspect other potential grooms, in kingdoms such as Portugal, Burgundy and Lorraine. John himself was however not without value even without Navarre. As he was the heir to the Albret lands of his father, he was a great lord to be and now that he found himself a widower, another woman could become his wife. Preferable a rich one that could bring resources to retake Navarre as well. Alain of Albret decided to keep his eye on his son’s future, as John was mentally exhausted and grieving the loss of his kingdom, wife and children in such short time. While Eleanor was still alive, she was living in Spain as the wife of the Prince of Asturias and her claim was being used against him and Charles Phoebus. Unbeknownst to John, his father and the king were negotiating for another match as well; a second wife for him. While they both wished for the retaking of Navarre from Spanish hands, the other lands that John still held was of importance. While the Foix lands had come to him though his wife, the Spanish was primarily interested in Navarre itself and not the French lands. Alain was keen on annexing those lands to the Albret inheritance as well and Charles was supportive of it, as it would create a stronghold near the border between them and Spain. Alain also wished for a prestigious match for his son that would reinforce his claims to the Foix inheritance and also so that John could have more children to carry on the mainland of the Albrets. Charles did indeed have the perfect bride in mind for John, namely Anne of Foix-Candale. Not only had Anne been raised in the court at Blois and was well educated to boot, but she was as near a princess that Charles could find. Her pedigree was perfect for the match, as her father had been Gaston of Foix, Count of Candale and Benauges, as a member of the cadet branch of the Foix house and her mother was the Infanta Catherine of Foix, youngest daughter of Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Navarre and Gaston IV, Count of Foix. Anne was also a cousin of Queen Anne, as Catherine of Foix had been the younger sister of Margaret of Foix, the late duchess of Brittany. She was also a cousin of the late Queen Catherine as her father had been the eldest of the Foix children. Thus, Anne was the perfect match for John to secure the Foix inheritance with royal backing, and her future children came with a claim to the throne of Navarre as well. Given Anne’s standing with the king and the queen, no doubt she would bring royal backing to John as well. To Charles it was a better solution rather than to waste his only daughter on a cause that might be hopeless and Alain was pleased that Anne would be as near a princess as he could get for his son. John was not privy to these negotiations as he was still mourning, but as Charles Phoebus was still engaged to Helene of Valois, he did partake in the Christmas celebration and Queen Anne had discreetly sat him next to Anne of Foix-Candale during the feast. No doubt she had told her cousin of the king’s intentions before that. While the 32-year-old lord had lost his kingdom and carried the title of King of Navarre in mere name, he was still a very good match for any noble lady as heir to one of the most extensive estates and titles in France and Anne no doubt found him courteous and regal to her sight. After all he had triumphed over John of Foix in a civil war and the romantic charm of a fugitive king seeking the return of his crown held a strong appeal. John found Anne a charming and lively young woman, who managed to make him smile several times during the Christmas feasts, but he still longed for Catherine far too much to make any romantic overtures to a maiden just a few years older than is firstborn daughter. Out of respect for the late queen, the betrothal was not announced until May of 1501, a year after Catherine’s death. John proved to be a reluctant groom, but after pressure from his father and the king, he wedded Anne in a beautiful ceremony in the Palace of Fontainebleau in the middle of June, one that both the king and queen attended.\n\nAnne of Foix-Candale\n\nThe news of John’s engagement to Anne had reached Spain quickly, as Ferdinand II of Aragon kept a sharp eye on the former king’s actions in France. Neither liked what they saw, especially as Anne was his bride as she was of Navarrese blood. At the age of 17 she could also produce heirs faster then Eleanor, as the princess was still 14. The princess had hit a growth spurt in the summer of 1500, one that albeit had left her in bed complaining of aches, while Fernando also grew taller than both his parents during this time. His frequent horse-riding, sword fighting and other martial endeavours had made Fernando strong and at the age of 16 his interest in the fairer sex begun to appear. While not as prolific as his father, Fernando’s first relationship appeared to have been with Luisa de Medrano, a lady in waiting at court. It is not hard to figure out why the cultured and intellectual Luisa, with her striking looks and commanding personality drew the prince to her, but their romance seemed to have been kept mostly secret. No doubt Luisa, focusing on her educational career and the future prospects, wished for as few people as possibly to know of their affair. The relationship appeared to have lasted for a little over a year before they amicable separated to go their separate ways. Eleanor turned 15 in the beginning of 1502 and the marriage between her and Fernando was finally consummated in the Alcazar of Segovia. As Anne of Foix-Candale became announced her pregnancy at the Christmas celebrations in 1501, Ferdinand and Isabella no doubt urged their son to make his wedding legitimate to strengthen union and to hopefully soon have a child of his own. In the beginning of 1502, Fernando was the only child of the catholic monarchs still childless. Isabella had given birth to her second daughter, Infanta Isabella of Avis in November of 1501, but the infant died just after the new year’s celebrations, much to her and Alfonso’s grief. In Flanders, Juana had delivered a daughter in the spring, named for the late Empress, Eleanor of Portugal. Maria had given birth to a son in Naples in December of 1501, much to the whole kingdom’s great delight. Charles IV, a patron of the classics and keenly aware of the glory of Naples in history, named his heir Fredrick Ercole, as a nod to Frederick I Barbarossa and Frederick II, two of the most magnificent Holy Roman Emperors, whom both had reigned over Italy during their glory and the greatest of divine heroes, Heracles himself. In Bohemia and Hungary, the old king Vladislaus had finally became a father as Margaret of Austria had born a son less than a year after her marriage, and Stephen of Bohemia and Hungary was christened in the royal palace at Prague in February of 1501. Tudor England also saw a royal birth in 1502 as the Queen delivered a daughter in the tower of London. The birth was extremely difficult, and it nearly led to the death of Elizabeth of York, but fortunately she survived, even if her health never truly recovered from there on after. As the infant was born at the end of July near the feast of Saint Anne, she was christened Anne Tudor, in honour of the saint of pregnant women who had been invoked during the difficult delivery. Perhaps as a nod to the Breton lands Henry VII had lived in as young man as well, because Saint Anne was also the patron saint of Brittany. Henry VII, not a man given to displays of emotions, publicly wept of relief of hearing that Elizabeth would live and immediately rushed over to his wife’s chambers. Anne was the last child of the Queen and both parents doted on their daughter, who joined her brother Edmund in the royal nursery in Eltham Palace a few months later.\n\nThe end of the year came with another stroke of sorrow for Navarre. Charles Phoebus, the so-called Prince of Viana died at the age of two in the French lands of his grandfather on the 13th of November. With him died the Albret claim to Navarre in the male line and the succession landed squarely on his eldest sister, the Princess of Asturias and future Queen of Spain. Despite the effort to keep it secret, the news swiftly came to Spain and reached the court of Ferdinand and Isabel just before Christmas. While Isabel remarked somewhat sadly that “the inheritance of my son came through a lot of blood and grief” according to historians, Ferdinand II did not seem bothered by it at all. After all, Navarre had been sought by him for decades now and finally the Spanish had it in their grip. Princess Eleanor’s reaction was a subdued one. While her own indignation over her father remarrying so soon after the death of her mother had steeled her, she had not wished for the death of her little siblings and the guilt was mixed with joy. Her new half-sister had been born in the beginning of autumn of 1502 to John III and Anne of Foix-Candale, and named Catherine d’Albret-Foix. Her marriage had not born fruit yet, as her bleedings came regularly every month and the pressure to produce an heir was something she already felt. Fernando was the only heir to the Spanish kingdoms and if Eleanor did not provide heirs, then the succession would go to the crown princess of Portugal and her children. But the danger of being submerged into Portugal was not a great one yet, after all the princess was just 15 years old. This December was one of both celebrations and preparations as the young monarchs needed to leave for Navarre for their new reigns that was about to begin in 1503.\n\nEleanor II of Navarre, Queen Consort of Spain in 1510\n\nKing Ferdinand VI of Castile, III of Aragon and I of Navarre in 1520\n\nAuthor's Note: My eye suck, so here is another chapter in the Spanish saga."
