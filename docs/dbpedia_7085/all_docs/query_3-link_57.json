        "text": "Part 2 – Principe\n\nChapter 7 – 1499 to 1500\n\nThe Castilians found a pretty big surprise waiting for them as they crossed into the border of Navarre. Namely hostility. As they neared Olite, the city with the great royal palace, the tension could be cut with a knife. Unlike the royal welcome they would customary have received, no one had greeted them so far. Cardinal Cisneros was rightfully worried, while Mendoza and Nájera wanted to press on. During the weeks before their arrival, preparations for Eleanor’s departure to France had been intense. Catherine and John had not told the Courtes of Navarre about the secret betrothal with the Dauphin and only a handful of people knew of it. Nearly the whole kingdom was expecting their princess to wed into Spain and it held strong favour for many. Louis of Beaumont had not found out about it until the very last minute. The second Count de Lérin was a ally of King Ferdinand since long and a principal proponent of the marriage between Eleanor and Prince Fernando, thus, his exclusion from the deal with France. No doubt Beaumont was expecting to accompany the bride as head of her entourage until the marriage and win the favour of the future King of Aragon. It is unknown how Beaumont found out about the planned escape to France, but once he did, he immediately decided to prevent it. Such a foolish endeavour could lead to a casus belli and further destruction in Navarre. They had barely survived the infighting with John of Foix and now they would provoke the wrath of the Catholic Monarchs? This could not stand. Beaumont had fled Pamplona in the night in secret, accompanied by a smaller entourage to meet the Castilians before they entered Olite. He had ridden hard for nearly two days when he finally met the Spanish delegation, at that point mere hours away from the city. The count was a familiar face to the Castilians and he immediately spilled the news that they were about to be deceived by the Navarrese monarchs. The company immediately withdrew to the small village of Peralta to speak to each other and consider the best course of action. Beaumont had brought proof to his claim with a secret letter he had obtained, detailing the deal John had made with Charles. After hours of consideration, Beaumont and Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y Luna returned to Aragon accompanied by 150 men at arms and riders. They were to ride fast to Zaragoza, the city the catholic monarchs resided in at the moment in preparation for the wedding.\n\nThe Duke of Nájera and the Archbishop was to continue to Olite in order to prevent Eleanor from being whisked away to France and to demand that her parents abided by the terms of 1497. As they arrived at late evening, the castellan of the royal palace graciously greeted them and offered them food and beds, while assuring them that John and Catherine would see them at mass tomorrow morning. As Cisneros had feared, this turned out to be a trap. The rooms they had been given had turned out to be a comfortable prison, with locked doors and armed guards positioned outside. The men at arms had found themselves at sword point and fighting between them and the soldiers from France broke out in the middle of the night. About a dozen men perished before the rest were subdued and locked into the dungeons of the castle. About seven or eight men managed to escape, intent on bringing the news of their fellow companions to their monarchs. Several minor lords and ladies were also taken hostage and imprisoned in one the towers of Olite. To the Navarrese, it seemed like they now held the upper hand to the Spanish and Eleanor would be safely be leaving for her journey that would take her over the Pyrenees mountains to her father’s lands in Bearn where she could meet the French who would escort her into the kingdom and forever away from Spain. However, they did not know their plans had already been derailed.\n\nPalace of the Kings of Navarre of Olite\n\nDiego Mendoza and the Count of Lerin had ridden hard to Aragon and reached Zaragoza in the record speed of three days. The company was utterly exhausted and Beaumont’s horse died when they entered the city gates. More than one of the men at arms died from fatigue of the hard travel and Mendoza became ill and had to be taken to a nearby monastery to recover. Beaumont went directly to the Aljaferia Palace to seek out Ferdinand and Isabel and to let the catholic monarchs know that their daughter in law to be was about to escape to France. Not to mention that their envoys was being held hostage in Olite, including the archbishop of Toledo. Ferdinand was rightfully furious about the betrayal and Isabel swore that if they did not immediately release the Duke, Cisneros and their companions and handed over Eleanor as promised, then she would gather an army and march on the kingdom with the same determination as she had done with Granada. Isabel immediately called for Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba to come to see her and Ferdinand, while Ferdinand summoned knights, foot soldiers and riders to gather to prepare to advance to Navarre. The Duke of Alba was placed in charge of a company of 2500 men that would head straight to Olite, while Beaumont and Córdoba were to gather an additional 5,600 men and take Pamplona as well. The goal was to cut of the access over the Pyrenees and prevent Eleanor from departing to France. Ferdinand summoned the courtes of Aragon within days and declared before them all that not only had the kings of Navarre broken the treaty with Spain, but they had allied with France in a clear attempt to snatch the promised princess away. This provoked great rage in the courtes and even more so when they were told of the hostages in Olite and the men at arms that had been slayed during the nights. Beaumont and the soldiers that had escaped Olite gave testimony as well, and while Ferdinand normally would have punished them for fleeing, the men’s courage of making it all the way to Aragon by foot to bring the news and plead for the life of their fellow soldiers made him praise them as heroes. The king ordered that they would be provided with beds and food, as well as medics for their injuries. Isabel herself meet them and praised the five survivors for their steadfastness and loyalty to the crown.\n\nKing Ferdinand and Prince Fernando both left with the army, despite Isabel’s protest about her only son going into a war zone. But Fernando was determined to prove himself in his first battle, as brave as any Cabello in Spain. Fernando’s warlike nature, even at this young age impressed many and his mother eventually relented, but told the king that if her son would come to harm, she would bring down the wrath of the almighty on his head. Now at the age of 14, Fernando could finally exercise the martial lessons he had devoted himself to since the age of six and while he had outgrown his trusty pony, his new horse was a splendid white mare he had gotten for his birthday.\n\nThe Spanish conquest of Navarre had begun.\n\nThe campaign begun in late summer and the first city to fall was Tudela as Ferdinand’s forces took it in two days, while the Duke of Alba pressed forward to Olite after defeating a small army at Carcastillo. In Pamplona, the news of the monarchs’ double dealings with France broke out and it caused outrage, both with the populace and in the courtes. Several lords, most of them being pro-spanish declared themselves being on Ferdinand and Isabel’s side against Catherine and John, while others sided with the Navarrese to protect the kingdom. The kingdom itself was exhausted by the fighting in the past year and it was hard to raise men to fight the Spanish at this point, even without the outrage in the land. Eleanor had managed to leave Pamplona just before the calamity broke out in Olite and her entourage had been steadily making its way towards the Pyrenees. Catherine was pregnant at this time and the stress did not help, with fractures showing up in her marriage, as John took the lion’s share of the blame, while the queen found herself under heavy pressure to call her daughter back from the French border. To add to further tragedy, Magdalena of Navarre, their second daughter passed away as the Spanish advanced. After her death, John wished to send little Henri away from Pamplona to protect his heir from the Spanish. He also sent words to his father, Alain d’Albret in France for aid and for him to take care of Eleanor. The following weeks, more bad news came to John. Arguedas and Peralta fell to the Spanish, while Olite and Tafalla had come under siege by the forces of the Duke of Alba. An army had been gathered near Pamplona, where they clashed with Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba. Beaumont had taken 1,700 men with him to quickly head to the French border that Eleanor had neared. Should the infanta manage to reach the Albret lands, getting her back would be extremely difficult. Beaumont also knew Eleanor and she knew him, so he had a better chance at taking her back than if she was chased by foreign swords. Córdoba beat the army at Noáin handily, while King Ferdinand had joined Alba in the siege of Olite. The siege was successful and the city surrendered in return for clemency to the king. As a show of good will, the archbishop of Toledo and the Duke of Nájera was released and presented to Ferdinand and prince Fernando, both men being very relieved to see their sovereign. The remaining men at arms were freed and returned to their fellow soldiers, whom greeted them with joy in the camp, where they found food and beds waiting for them. John and Catherine had managed to flee from Pamplona with a small entourage before the siege started as the crushing defeat of the battle of Noáin had shown they were powerless against the Castilians. Little Henri accompanied his parents, as their only son, he was still the Prince of Viana and the hope of the kingdom. Unlike their daughter, the managed to escape the Spanish long enough to reach the city of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, where the Spanish nearly captured them, if not for the heroic near sacrifice of Pedro de Navarre, whom held them off long enough for the royal family to get away. John, Catherine and Henri arrived in the city of Bayonne days later, suffering from extreme exhaustion. They had lost most of their guards at this point, and two more attendants had died along the way. Catherine had been able to bring three large chests alongside her during the flight to France, containing gold, silver, jewels, fabrics and other valuables. Other than that, she and her husband had few things other than the clothes of their backs and their son with them. André d'Espinay, the archbishop of Bordeaux offered them sanctuary in the city upon their arrival and the family could catch their breaths for a few days. John sent word for his father to help after their arrival and Alain arrived ten days later, accompanied by an immense entourage of knights, soldiers, petty lords and ladies to meet the despoiled monarchs. Alain escorted them to safety to the Albret lands in Tartas, as the pregnant Catherine desperately needed proper rest and care. Little Henri had become sick from the hard travel, much to his parents’ despair and worse was to come. Pedro de Navarre was injured in the fighting against the Spanish and captured after. Beaumont on the other hand had managed to get to Eleanor in the city of Mauléon near Bearn and had taken her into his custody as Constable of Navarre. Pamplona fell to king Ferdinand less than a month after the monarchs’ flight to France and Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port had been taken as well.\n\nThe gamble to ally with France had failed spectacularly. In doing so, John and Catherine had lost their eldest daughter to Spain, their second daughter to death, their kingdom, their possessions and the crown itself. At this moment, only Prince Henri remained and the faint hope that he would one day retake what belonged to him from Spain. The child in Catherine’s belly was also there, and both parents hoped for a boy to secure their succession as Henri was sickly. Catherine was due in late April of 1500 and at the moment she and John resided in the Albret lands to recover their strength and to figure out what to do next. Charles VIII of France had followed the actions in Navarre closely and as Queen Anne was due with another baby in the middle of December of 1499, he offered another alliance to John. Should Anne’s baby be a daughter, she would be betrothed to Henri and France would give their full support in taking Navarre back properly. If Catherine’s child was a girl, then that child would be the bride of Charles Orlando. The dauphin had turned seven years old now, and had been sent to Pointers where his own household resided. His education had begun for real and Charles had trusted his eldest sister, Anne of France to supervise it. This had caused some friction between him and Queen Anne, but her pregnancy occupied her mind more. Charles Orlando was still the only child of hers to live past infancy and Anne occupied her time with the patronage of artist in France and the constructions of the chateaus of Amboise and Tours that she shared with her husband. The future of the dauphin was a question that both his parents shared a concern about, especially his future marriage. There was a disturbing lack of royal princesses in his age bracket in the kingdoms of Europe and since Eleanor of Navarre was taken, her sister Magdalena dead, only one princess remained that suited France’s standing: Infanta Eleanor of Portugal. But while she was the only royal princess on the market, other noble girls could work as proxies. Emperor Maximilian had nieces by his sister near Charles Orlando’s age and either Sidone, Sibylle and Sabina of Bavaria could work just fine should Duke Philip of Burgundy not have a daughter in the nearest years. There were plenty of candidates inside France as well, Françoise d’Alencon and her sister Anne, Marie d’Albret, Marguerite of Angouleme, Renée of Bourbon and the Auvergne sisters as well, but Charles and Anne desired a foreign bride first and foremost. Princess Mary of England had been lost to the Burgundians as baby Charles had been a far more desirable match for King Henry VII. The king of England had further cause to celebrate in the middle of the summer of 1499 as Queen Elizabeth of York had given birth to a son in the eleventh of July. Edmund Tudor had been christened in a splendid ceremony, much to the family’s delight. Prince Henry seemed happy to have a little brother and boasted that he would train Edmund in sword fighting himself when the baby became old enough to hold a wooden practice sword.\n\nQueen Elizabeth of York\n\nIn Spain, king Ferdinand took over the castle of Pamplona, to oversee the new Spanish rule in Navarre. Pockets of rebellion still resisted Spanish control, but the kingdom was far too broken to rebel against the new overlords and the absence of Catherine and John weakened things further. It was in Pamplona that Ferdinand and Prince Fernando finally met Eleanor of Navarre on the 7th of November. The Count of Lérin brought the twelve-year-old princess back from Mauléon where she would finally see her Spanish groom. For Eleanor, it had been an intense five months. First she had been nervous about leaving her family in Navarre to go to Spain and meeting the legendary Ferdinand II and Isabel I, and then all those plans had been cast aside for her secret flight to France where she was to wed a small boy who would one day wear the crown of her great-grandfather Louis XI, only for her arduous journey in the Pyrenees to be halted by armed men bringing her and the entourage back to her now broken kingdom where she was to meet the king of Aragon, a man who frightened her even more as the whispers of his cruelty and power had been dripped in her ears by anti-spanish courtiers. Beaumont had spent plenty of time ensuring the little princess was told many great stories about Ferdinand and Isabel and of Prince Fernando, whom she seemed very curious about. Eleanor hoped for that her husband to be would not be frightening at least, as she had lost her whole family at this point. Her parents were in France with her grandfather and little brother and her dear sister had passed away after her departure. Eleanor spent much of the last part of the year in sadness, thus her meeting with the Ferdinands was a joyless one. While she played the part of a court lady well, there could be no hiding the sorrow she bore. King Ferdinand did not display much interest in her emotional state, other than the usual curtsies and Eleanor was very frightened of him. Fernando seemed more attuned to his bride and spent more time with her. He also gave her gifts such as small pieces of jewellery, and even some hand carved wooden animals of dogs, horses and turtles that he made himself. Despite that, Eleanor still remained cloaked in sorrow and while she occasionally showed Fernando a bit of warmth, it would take longer for her to be happy again.\n\nOn the 25th of November the courtes of Navarre was once more summoned to the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption in Pamplona where they always congregated. While Eleanor could technically not be sworn in as Princess of Viana as her little brother Henri still lived and her mother might have another son in the spring, many considered Eleanor to be the rightful heir to her parents at this point. The Beaumont party strongly supported her claim and so did many in the Aragmont party, as the double dealings with France had disgusted many and been fatal to the cause of John and Catherine. The power of the monarch was vested in King Ferdinand II, but only as a regent and not as a king himself. Ferdinand accepted these terms, knowing that he would be king in all but name anyway. Despite Henri still living, the courtes settled the matter of the succession in Eleanor’s favour and she was sworn in as Princess of Viana and heir to the throne regardless. Prince Fernando also swore the same oath and was granted the rights of heir in jure uxoris, by the right of marriage to Eleanor.\n\nThe wedding itself took place on the 10th of December in the cathedral as Fernando was mere days away from turning 15 years old. While Eleanor made a pretty sight, dressed up in cloth of silver, white brocade and warm velvets, she remained sombre during the ceremony. Her voice did not quiver during the exchanging of the vows, but the tone was cold. To many of the onlookers, the prince and princess of Viana seemed like a good match, with Fernando being tall and sturdy, with glistering auburn hair while Eleanor was somewhat short still and of pale complexion with dark hair grey eyes. Due to the bride’s young age the marriage was not consummated after the wedding, but she and Fernando was symbolically placed in the marriage bed together to represent a union, before Eleanor returned to her new chambers in the castle. Ferdinand set to once more write to his wife Isabel of the victories, while Fernando got to know the young lords of Navarre and integrated many of them into his circle of friends. As for Eleanor herself, she remained in the palace for the Christmas celebrations, where several people remarked that the least cheerful person in the whole of Navarre seemed to be the princess of Viana herself.\n\nFrance spent the Christmas in great celebrations, as Queen Anne had been delivered of a healthy baby girl at last. Like her son, the naming of the little mademoiselle was an unorthodox one: Helene. Saint Helena was one of the queen’s patron saints and as while it was an uncommon one for a princess, both parents agreed. Saint Helena was the mother of the emperor Constantine the Great and a common figure in the medieval stories such as the Breton lai Emaré, a medieval romance poem that Anne certainly would be familiar with. The influx of Greek and roman history and literature also influenced the naming. The stories of Ilium and the city of Troy was very popular in Europe in the 15th century, especially as the Byzantium scholars had fled to Italy after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Fair Helena had after all been the daughter of the King of the Gods and Queen Leda of Sparta. The divine connections suited her just fine, after all, Helena had been the name born by many empresses in history as well. While some grumbled about the name being uncommon, little Helene’s parents both adored her and Charles was beyond happy to finally have a living child after the stillbirths and infants lost to the cradle. Helene of Valois would spend her first weeks on earth as the cherished darling of both her parents in the bright court in Amboise. As promised by Charles, her newborn hand was immediately pledged to Henri of Navarre, the forsaken heir to Catherine and John, now residing in the land of the House of Albret.\n\nAnne of Brittany as Queen of France\n\nThe birth of her daughter seemed to assure Anne of Brittany of her standing even further. As the year turned into the next century, the Christmas court in Amboise was a glorious one. Despite the loss of Naples, France itself was secured. The dauphin had reached the age of eight and Charles Orlando was shaping himself as a intelligent and robust boy. The marriage between Charles and Anne became more harmonious after Anne’s arrival as their old quarrels vanished steadily and both the king and queen seemed more in unison then ever.\n\nAuthor's Note: And so Navarre joins Castile and Aragon and Fernando marries Eleanor as planned, with some interruptions along the way. In England a spare to the former spare is born and Anne of Brittany gets a daughter to dote on. I really liked the name Helene, because I have the name Anne of France reserved for another character in the future. And now onwards to the 16th century!"
