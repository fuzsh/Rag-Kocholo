She was to have been buried on the following Monday, but the funeral was stopped by order of Coroner Hayes, of Simcoe, pending the result of an inquest, suspicious\n\ncircumstances having surrounded the girls death. A jury was empanelled and some evidence heard which went to show that the girl was engaged to a young man who had since left the country; that sometime before her death she began taking certain drugs, and that on Saturday, June 24, she gave premature birth to a child, which brought on convulsions. The inquest was adjourned until last evening, to allow of a post-mortem examination being made to ascertain whether Miss McCarrey came to her death by the use of drugs, or whether death was due to natural causes. At the adjourned inquest last night, the doctors who conducted the examination gave their evidence, but it was so\n\nconflicting that the jury brought in a verdict to the effect that Mamie McCarrey came to her death from pre-mature labour, but whether the result of natural causes or the use of noxious drugs could not be determined from the evidence given.\n\nGAYLOR (North Seneca) - Miss Fanny Gaylor, who has been lying ill at Mr. Wards for some time, died last Sunday afternoon.\n\nWILSON (Toronto) July 4 - Frederick Wilson, son of Jacob Wilson, manager of the India and Ceylon, Tea company, 48 East Front street, was killed yesterday morning at Cobourg, while attempting to board a moving freight train.

Funeral Sunday afternoon from the residence of his father, Frank Green, Stony Creek.\n\nWhen Samuel Green, Charles McCardie, and Hamilton Land left Stony Creek yesterday morning to come to the city with a load of berries, they little thought that when they returned to the village in the evening, one of the party would be missing, gone from this world forever. Such however, was the unfortunate circumstances which surrounded the homecoming of the young men. After selling their berries the three young men decided to go home by way of Fitchs and enjoy an hour or two fishing on the way. They drove to Fitchs roadhouse and, securing Mr. Fitchs boat, started out to try their luck at catching fish. After rowing around for a short time, they pulled in at Dynes where they stayed about an hour, and then started back for Fitchs. When they got into the inlet which leads up to the hotel they again dropped their hooks and allowed the boat to drift. When they got opposite Fletchers farm two of the trio started to change places in the boat, which capsized, and threw all of the members of the party into the water. McCardie was the only one who could swim, and as soon as he came to the surface he grabbed the upturned boat and got on top of it. Green came to the surface near McCardie and the latter called to him to catch hold of the boat and climb up. With McCardies assistance, he succeeded in getting partly out of the water, but being completely exhausted he fell back and sank, never to rise again. Land, the third member of the party succeeded in catching hold of the boat on arising to the surface the second time, and while he was too far gone to climb out of the water, he succeeded in holding on until assistance arrived.\n\nWhen McCardie got on top of the upturned boat, he yelled for assistance and Richard Fletcher, hearing his cries; put out in another boat and rescued him from his perilous position. Land was pulled out of the water in an exhausted condition, and some difficulty was experienced in reviving him. It was not until the two were safely ashore that Fletcher learned that a third man was missing, and he went out again to try and find some trace of him. He was unsuccessful and returned to shore to get further assistance. Fletcher, William Depew, and Charles Taafe, secured grappling irons and dragged the inlet and after an hours hard work brought the lifeless body of Green to the surface. Undertaker Green was telephoned for, and went down and brought the body up to the city to be prepared for burial.\n\nThe two men who were saved were taken to Fitchs hotel where their clothes were changed. Doctors Carr and Thompson of Stony Creek were summoned and hurried to the scene and soon had the men sufficiently revived to be taken home. After hearing the circumstances the medical men decided that an inquest was unnecessary.\n\nSamuel Green was the son of Frank Green, the well-known Stony Creek horseman. He was about 33 years of age, and unmarried. At the time of the accident his father was in Windsor and\n\nword was sent to him at once.\n\nThe body is now at Greens undertaking establishment, and will be interred in the Stony Creek on Sunday.\n\nWALLER - On July 7th, at her parents residence, Bartonville, Ada S., youngest daughter of George Waller, aged 21 years.

Conductor Griffin and the other brakeman, who were in the back coach, escaped uninjured. The engine cab was completely demolished and the remainder of the engine was hurled into the ditch upside down. The tender was turned completely over and four cars were piled up in front of the engine and four behind, all being completely demolished. The track was torn to pieces and the ties were made into toothpicks. The cause of the accident is unknown, but it is supposed that some part of the engine dropped, causing the engine to be lifted and hurled from the track. The condition of the track shows that something had dragged for nearly half a mile.\n\nBowens body was brought to the Delhi station where Undertaker Church was called. Bowen lived at Bridgeburg and leaves a wife and family to mourn his sad and horrible death.\n\nAn inquest is not deemed necessary.\n\nWhen the crew, which was left unhurt, found Fireman Perry, he exclaimed never mind me; find my mate.\n\nDr. R.B.

Mr. Atwell writes his letters in diary form and he states that while on the way across the divide to Fort Yukon his party met with some Indian guides, who told them of the death of A.D.Stewart on March 13. Scurvy was the cause of death, and the Indians said that other members of the Stewart party were very sick with the same disease, but would recover. They were at that time on the Beaver river, and were intending to go on by it to the divide. The Indians say it would be impossible for them to make the crossing in that way and that they would have to turn back as soon as the river opens.

On May 1 Atwell received work from Birely and decided to go on to Fort Yukon to meet him. The divide was reached on May 5, and Fort Yukon on June 6th. There he fell in with a Hamilton man named Anthony-a painter by trade-who was also on the hunt for gold. In the letter he says he expects to catch up with Brock, Duncan, and Irvine, and he also intimates that he will not go to Dawson City, as he thinks that place is overrun with officialdom.\n\nHe is now in Alaska and will prospect there. He says that he is now and will be in future within a months time of Hamilton, in the matter of communication and expects to write regularly. In the letter he mentions that he does not know just where French and Gardiner are. They were members of the same party.\n\nAnother letter was received today confirming the news of Mr. Stewarts death, and also stating that Messrs. Tallman, Brock, and Skynner, were seriously ill.

Vic was drowned on Jun 6th, 1899. We crossed the divide on April with hand sleighs, came down a little river about seven miles, and then went into camp, whipsawed lumber, and built a boat. On May 28 we started down the river about eight miles, when we came to another rapids, which we decided to portage, they being too swift and too rocky to try to run. We portaged about four and a half miles, in four days; then we decided to let our boat down with ropes. We let her down for about three miles all right, when the river seemed to get a good bit better. A couple of the parties ahead of us ran them from this point, so we decided to run them. Vic, took the sweep, Bill Brown road stroke, or, and Jim Beare next, Jack OHara next, and the fourth man was a chap named Louis; he was just giving us a hand to make up the crew as I had to get into the bow with a pole to help Vic in bad places. Well, they ran for about three quarters of a mile at a flying clip, when she struck. The first thing I knew I was out in the water, but had a good hold of the side of the boat, and was soon hauled in safe. As she struck the rock the current must have struck the sweep, and poor Vic, was thrown backwards eight or ten feet clear of the boat and out of reach of help. The water here was running like a mill-race the fellows did all they could in the short space of time they had before he disappeared for good; it was not long. He was carried about twenty feet from the boat in less than half a minute. The current just seemed to drag him down, because he only sank once, and never came up again. Jim Beare and I found the body in less than half an hour afterwards. Dr. Dillabaugh, with the assistance of the rest of the fellows, worked for three hours, but it was no good. Vic had gone. There were some nasty mark on his head where he had struck on the rocks. You have lost a brother, and we have lost a kind- hearted good-natured chum. We buried him on a point half a mile above where he was found. It was just good fortune alone that we ever found him, as the rapids are about seven miles long. He was in the best of health and must have weighted 170 or 175 pounds. We found a belt on him containing $196.00, which will be returned as soon as possible, along with his watch, and some other little things of his. There were 58 white men at the funeral. The rest of the boys are all well, and expect to find something farther down this river; but, of course, we are not sure. Now I must close, as this letter is to go out by a couple of fellows they are just about out of grub and have to skip.\n\nIf you know of any person from Hamilton going to the Klondike, tell them to go by the coast, or stay at home.\n\nSigned\n\nLOGIE DONALDSON, JOHN OHARA, W.J.

She leaves five sons - T.L.,\n\nJames, and William, of this city; John, of Baltimore, and Robert, of New York - and two daughters - Mrs. Caven, Poughkeepsie, N.Y. and Mrs. Book, of Grimsby.\n\nThe funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon from the residence of her son, James Dixon, 65 East avenue south.\n\nPENNELL - This morning the body of William Pennell, 38 Simcoe street west, was found floating in the bay just off the Bayview wharf. It was first seen about ten oclock and was towed into the wharf where it was made fast, and word was telephoned to the city. Coroner Philp was at once notified and drove to the scene. Constable Bainbridge also went out and took charge of the remains.\n\nIn the unfortunate mans hat, which was found near the body, was his name and address, and the remains were also identified by two young men from the city who knew the deceased. After a couple of hours delay this information was telephoned back to the city and the patrol was sent after the body, which was removed to the morgue. From the appearance of the body it was evident that it had been in the water for at least a day. The doctor gathered all the evidence he could and will consult with the crown attorney this afternoon regarding the advisability of holding an inquest.\n\nWhether Pennell met his death by accident or committed suicide cannot be determined as nothing can be learned concerning his whereabouts since he left home last Wednesday.\n\nMrs. Pennell had not been informed of the sad occurrence when the Spectator reporter called about two oclock this afternoon and almost became frantic with grief when he told her what had happened. From her it was learned that the unfortunate man left home last Wednesday and had not been working for some time and continual sickness had made him despondent, but his friends and relatives do not think that he committed suicide. Pennell was a labourer and was about 40 years of age. He, however, had been unable to work for some time on account of been troubled with\n\nrheumatism, which at times was so bad that he could not walk. It was no unusual thing for him to be away from home looking for employment for days at a time, and his wife was not worrying about his absence.
