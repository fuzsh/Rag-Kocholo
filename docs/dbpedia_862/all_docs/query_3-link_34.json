        "text": "THE GREAT JEWEL ROBBERY\n\nSERIES: A Front Page Mystery #1\n\nGENRE: Cozy Mystery\n\nRELEASE DATE: June 3, 2019\n\nPAGES: 204\n\nChicago Tribune reporters Emma and Grace have been best friends since college despite coming from different worlds. When Grace is assigned to cover an annual charity ball and auction being held at a lakeside mansion and her boyfriend bails on her, she brings Emma as her plus one. The night is going smoothly until Emma finds the host’s brother unconscious in the study. Though at first it is thought he was tipsy and stumbled, it soon becomes clear more is afoot, as the wall safe is empty and a three-million-dollar diamond necklace is missing. With visions of becoming ace investigative journalists, Emma and Grace set out to solve the mystery, much to the chagrin of the handsome local detective.\n\nWhat a delightful start to a new series! This is my first read from this author but it won’t be my last. Her writing voice instantly roped me into the story, the setting, and the characters. Bonus – it was completely clean but still introduced some great chemistry and sparks.\n\nEmma and Grace make a great crime-solving duo. They each are a little awkward in their own ways which leaves room for some fun comedic moments to help break the tension. But basically they could be any of us, especially Emma, and that makes them immediately relatable and endearing. I wasn’t quite ready to say goodbye to them yet when I reached the end (especially after that delicious last scene!) so I’m definitely looking forward to the next book!\n\nThe mystery was really well crafted too, I thought. It kept me guessing with several red herrings and well-timed twists – and the author did a great job of keeping the culprit’s identity just out of reach until the reveal.\n\nBottom Line: The Great Jewel Robbery is well-written with an engaging style that keeps you invested in the story from beginning to end. The characters are defined with some layers that will be most likely be explored in future books. A dash of swoony romance (hello, hunky Detective O’Mara!) adds just the right amount of chemistry without overpowering the story itself. If you’re looking for a new fave cozy mystery series, check out The Great Jewel Robbery!\n\n(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the author . All views expressed are only my honest opinion.)\n\nMy Rating: 4.5 stars / love it!\n\nKissingBook Level: 3 / may forget to breathe on occasion\n\nElizabeth McKenna’s love of books reaches back to her childhood, where her tastes ranged from Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys to Stephen King’s horror stories. She had never read a romance novel until one Christmas when her sister gave her the latest bestseller by Nora Roberts. She was hooked from page one (actually, she admits it was the first love scene). She combined her love of history, romance, and a happy ending to write Cera’s Place and Venice in the Moonlight. Her contemporary romance novel, First Crush Last Love, is loosely based on her life during her teens and twenties. The Great Jewel Robbery is her debut cozy mystery, and she hopes readers will like it as much as they have enjoyed her romances.\n\nElizabeth lives in Wisconsin with her understanding husband, two beautiful daughters, and a sassy Labrador. When she isn’t writing, working, or being a mom, she’s sleeping.\n\nwebsite | Facebook | Twitter | Pinterest | Instagram\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nThis giveaway is hosted by Great Escapes, not RimSP\n\nFollow along with the tour HERE\n\nWhat about you?
