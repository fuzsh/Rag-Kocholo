        "text": "Note: Because of the large size of the section for 1915, it has been subdivided into two parts.\n\nJanuary to June, 1915 ~ July to December, 1915\n\nJuly, 1915, Architectural Record, Vol. 38, 187-189. Of Spanish and Mexican Themes, by Bertram G. Goodhue.\n\nReview of “Rejeria of the Spanish Renaissance,” a collection of photographs and measured drawings with descriptive text by Arthur Byne and Mildred Stapley. Also review of book on Mexico by La Beaume . . . p. 189. “The Mission style at its best means Spanish Colonial, just as Spanish Colonial at its best almost means Spanish.”\n\nJuly, 1915, California Garden, 6. The Lath House:\n\nOwners of lath houses should visit the one at the Exposition (be careful to call it the Horticultural Building) and go through it inquiringly, that is with an idea of finding possibilities in planting. Naturally they will not grow huge Araucarias and bamboos in their lath houses, nor shall we after the Exposition is over in this big one, but it is very worth while to see with a size Cibortium Schieded can make, also how the Cyromiums Falcatum andRochfordianum or holly ferns like to be out in the ground and with root space. Hunt up these ferns and also Cymnogramma Sulphurea and Blechnum Occidentale and see if you would not like a specimen. There are one or two very good Aralia Elegantissima and Aralia Chabrierii.\n\nIt is by no means uncommon to see plants in the ground in lath houses doing much less development that ought to be the case and this is frequently due to a lack of moisture that is not apparent on the surface. The owner will say, “I water every day,” and probably does so, sprinkling by hand and getting a beautiful wet all around. This hand sprinkling is a delusion and a snare unless freely interspersed with a good soaking and this soaking is only possible in sandy, loose soil, unless the ground is periodically loosened down. Where the natural soil is of a heavy or easily compacted quality it would pay to haul in a more kindly medium, such as leaf mold, sandy loam and sharp sand in equal parts; this superimposed on a heavier soil will give good results with ferns and begonias and kindred growths. Drainage must be good and a sprinkling of charcoal added to above mixture might be a wise precaution.\n\nWhere growths are crowded, as is almost always the case in lath houses, frequent fertilizer should be given. If incorporated in the soil, it must be of non-heating kind, such as old cow manure, though liquid fertilizer seems to suit ferns. It cannot be too strongly emphasized that a lath house merely provides certain conditions of modified climate and not plant food and that the kind of things we plant therein require more water than ordinary outside residents of a garden.\n\nLath house evolution is proceeding rapidly, architecturally. It has gone from a chicken coop to a palace. In usage it has passed from a housing of nursery stock to a semi-tropical garden and now comes the lath house landscaping.\n\nThough the Garden did not succeed in getting a lath house covering acres which could have been built for the cost of the elaborate Horticultural Building, such a one is bound some day to be in Balboa Park. It will have groupings of shrubs and plants, ferny nooks and fragrant arbors and the visitor to our city shall find it a place to walk and a place to talk, a garden with sunshine tempered to order, wind changed to a whispering zephyr, a garden of Eden without a serpent.\n\nLet us be thankful for our Horticultural Building. With that title it could hardly be a true lath house, but let us think of ten acres under a lathed-in pergola, partly on the flat, partly going in steps down into a canyon, lighted cunningly as with fireflies, and let us think hard enough to bring the reality before some other place seizes the idea and reaps the reward of originality.\n\nJuly, 1915, California Garden, 12.\n\nPicking and Peckings by the Early Bird: Ask the visitor wherein lies the charm of our Exposition, and the unfailing answer pays tribute to the harmonious building and planting scheme. To wander around among the things that are pre-eminently fit has a charm that all feel and acknowledge, and our Exposition should do for San Diego what years of tears and prayers could never have done, demonstrate the commercial value of just beauty and harmony. Beautiful as the Exposition is, it is only one and a small one of San Diego’s diadem of jewels.\n\nJuly, 1915, California’s Magazine (San Francisco, Calif.), Vol. 1, No. 1. “The Panama-California Exposition,” by Mark S. Watson.\n\nJuly 26, 1915, Independent Magazine. “California’s County Fair,” by Geddes Smith.\n\nThere is just one place in the world where a cow carved from butter, a mermaid of _____ , a beeswax bear are entirely at _____. That is at a county fair. At the Panama-California Exposition at San Diego, they are all on duty — perfectly at home. Some of them have been famous at other expositions, but they were never so continually placed as here.\n\nFor this big fair — or small exposition — is redolent of the land, and particularly of California land. It is indigenous to an extent not at all approached by the Jewel City at San Francisco. Six hundred and fifteen acres are devoted almost wholly to a demonstration of the fact that if the world doesn’t revolve around Southern California, it ought to.\n\nBut you must not conclude that the men who built the Panama-California Exposition has an easy or a circumscribed task. It is no light undertaking to paint the portrait of Paradise and a Paradise — suitably advertised, to be sure — Southern California certainly is. The ____ rises easily to the lips of the western traveler and is, as one might expect, officially confirmed by such real ____ “literature” as this:\n\nParadise! What is it? It is man’s ultimate hope. His ideal of the place in which he shall spend eternity. . . . That he may enjoy it before death, the average man never even suspects. He would reject the idea, presented to him, with scorn; yet, in spite of this, we will offer a picture, not of some mystical land in the dim distance of eternity, but of a very material land in the sunlight of the present. When we have given this picture, you will have . . . Lemon Grove . . . The population of the Grove is 800.\n\nBut even shorn of its celestial attributes. Southern California is preeminently the land of out-of-doors, and it is natural to find the Exposition at San Diego, distinctly an out-of-doors affair. And since ____ reality there means a _____ of flowers, the Fair is a ____ of great beauty of a sort ____ at all traditional in exposition technique.\n\nBuildings of creamy concrete, all of that Spanish-Colonial type which begins with a bare white wall, sweeten it with a rounded arch, ___ as it develops more and ____ luxuriously adds ornate carving to windows and doors and cornices, though always with a reserve of simplicity where the solid surface remains unbroken; roofs of red tile; heavy curtains of dully green or blue or orange dropping from upper windows; bougainvillea clinging to the white walls and carrying its green leaves and crimson blossoms to the very cornices; and filling every vista, between and around and behind the buildings, gardens and lawns and riotous flower-filled hollows crowded with splendid color — that is the San Diego Exposition.\n\nBetween the palms of the Prado and the inner walls of the exhibit halls, cool cloisters show the way through the heart of the Exposition. Shaded from the hot Southern sun by day, softly lighted by reflection from the concrete walls by night, their rounded archways half-filled with palm branches, they make even that tedious pilgrimage by which one “does” an exposition, a pleasure. There was probably never a fair that offered so many alluring places just to sit and vegetate. Charming patios offer their unmatched blending of a cool porch, bright patches of greenery, and a courtyard filled with brilliant sunshine must far enough from your lazy chair so that you imagine rather than feel its warmth. Unconsciously your mind builds up a delightful concept of Southern California — false enough, probably — as a place where you sit on the edge of the sunlight and watch things grow.\n\nIf you wait long enough at any point of vantage some one will provide the music that alone is lacking. In one courtyard, dark-skinned Hawaiian lads, with purple sashes over their cloths of tropical white, will be strumming their ukuleles. Here and there about the Plaza de Panama or beside the Lagoon of Flowers (San Diego, of course, calls it La Laguna de las Flores) or down the Prado strolls a band of Mexican boys and girls who sing and dance and tweak their mandolins and guitars and then — just as the knot of watchers is most eager for more — wander on and away. It was odd to see them leading the way into the Home Economic Building — “La Bella Sevilla and her troupe” does not sound particularly domestic — but you may be sure they did not more than circle the booths and lead the way out again.\n\nWhy should anyone stay indoors? I was talking with a mild-mannered “booster” about the small compass of California’s ubiquitous bungalows. “But you don’t need many rooms,” he insisted. “I just can’t keep my wife indoors. She’ll lock the door and get out in the garden as soon as she can, and stay there.” And so at San Diego there is not a great deal to tempt the visitor out of the sunlight. As expositions go, there is little to be seen indoors, and what there is might be more effectively displayed. Compared with the profuse evidences of mechanical ingenuity at San Francisco, the showing here is a little monotonous. There are not many industrial exhibits, and only Japan among foreign countries is largely represented. Few of the county or state displays are sufficiently artful to make a distinct impression: Utah, with a big relief map and interesting statistical displays prepared by the State Agricultural College, is a leader in this respect. Some of the other exhibitors, after piling up their fruits and vegetables, go no further than to inform the public by placard that this county has domestic animals worth $2,000,000, while that has 428,417 grape vines in bearing — true and useful facts, but like many true and useful facts not especially amusing. And whatever may be the morals of the matter, people who go to expositions will persist in looking out for amusement and letting education take care of itself. More effective work is done by the moving pictures, which generously reinforce the story of the promoter.\n\nIt is the Southern California Counties Building, naturally, that most completely develops the county fair motif for which the butter-sculpture strikes the characteristic note. Here one finds the familiar little show-cases with the stubby compositions and squatty baskets of the Fourth Grade, Eureka District School; and Mrs. Ann Anderson’s china painting and Mrs. Betty Bacon’s hemstitched aprons (for sale); and the inlaid table made out of 2,866 pieces of wood by a fine old craftsman of seventy-eight years — all the things that link up the drifting, indifferent public with the few who care so tremendously and anchor the whole Exposition to the folks of Southern California.\n\nOne field the Exposition has filled particularly well. You hardly expect to find a community which has its eyes so firmly fixed on the future lingering over its history, but archaeology and ethnology have the place of honor here. The whole Fair is a record of Spanish architecture in the New World. Half a dozen types are shown. With admirable taste, the paintings gathered at the Exposition are hung in a building of the utmost simplicity, a reproduction of the fine primitive mission, with only the color of the roof and the sturdy grace of the round arch to save it from stark barrenness. The San Joaquin Valley Building, loaded with ornament, is a type of the municipal palace of Spanish America. The California Building, whose campanile and dome, pranked with yellow and blue, dominate the ground, is a Latin-American cathedral. Here at the host building one finds Central American antiquities — monuments and models for the Maya cities — and surprisingly beautiful photographs of the American Indian. In the Indian Arts Building, together with a little of that exploitation of native crafts with which the traveler through the Southwest is soon surfeited, there are more significant exhibits, such as a fine series of diagrams illustrating Indian symbolism.\n\nSan Diego has a double hold on Spanish and Indian tradition. It was the first of the Franciscan missions out of which California grew, and its position almost on the international boundary makes it the first United States port as you come up from Panama and the last American city of any importance as you go down the coast to Mexico. Indeed, Mexico is so near that law-abiding American citizens who wish to investigate contemporary antiquities have only to consult the billboards and slip over the line to Tia Juana, where bullfights and cockfights may be had almost for the asking.\n\nIt is natural that the Fair should borrow local color from these sources. On the “Isthmus,” small brother to the “Zone,” one of the largest concessions is the “Painted Desert,” where families from half a dozen Indian tribes may be seen busy at their primitive crafts in their primitive houses, and probably unconscious, during business hours, of the steamer trunks and kitchen clocks which somewhat mitigate their surroundings.\n\nBetween these adobe huts and the comfortable bungalow on the model five-acre ranch lies the whole history of the Southwest. Indeed the bungalow is rather prophetic than historic; such convenience and beauty can hardly be typical yet. This display, part of the exhibit of the Southern Counties, is aimed confessedly at the back-to-the-land city man. Five acres have been under cultivation since March, 1913, and now the fruit trees and vegetables and hen-yard and rose-hedges, all well established and under constant care, drive home in a more concrete form the message of salvation by real estate which California preaches in season and out of season.\n\nBut it was not t sell five-acre irrigated ranches that San Diego invested in this all-year show. The Exposition has a definite part to play in the city’s program. Indeed it is one of the five counts on which San Diego assures itself that she is “destined to become the greatest commercial city of the new southwest.” Of course, its advertising value is rather enhanced than lessened by the fact that San Francisco has another and a bigger fair at the same time. San Diego alone might not disturb the public imagination, but San Diego running a rival attraction to the metropolis of the coast piques one’s curiosity, and insures a degree of publicity not to be measured by attendance figures alone.\n\nSan Diego needs advertising. Her bid for greatness is a fairly recent affair. With a history dating from 1769 she has accumulated only 2,637 inhabitants by 1880, and had already lived through two booms and two relapses. The Santa Fe reached the city in 1884, and in that decade the population increased five hundred percent. The ten years from 1900 to 1910 saw the city more than double its size, and against its 39,578 at the last census, San Diego now claims 100,000. But all good Californians answer in terms of the census of 1920 or later when you ask them about population, and the truth probably lies between that and the census estimate for July 1, 1915 of 51,115. (This is based on the rate of growth from 1900 to 1910.) The increase in now phenomenally rapid, but that is true of Southern California as a whole, and Los Angeles, with its 400,000 and more, has rather cast its smaller neighbor into the shade.\n\n“Los” has people and railroads, but a poor harbor even if it did push its city limits nearly twenty miles to the coast, like Athens with the Piraeus, to get it. San Diego has a fine harbor; the people are coming; but she lacks railroads from her back country. The rivalry between the cities somewhat hampers the smaller in getting steamship facilities. Los Angeles merchants prefer to ship through San Pedro, their own port, though equally low rates can be had through San Diego. Even on the street corner, you feel the clash of destinies; rival newsboys, brandishing headlines against each other, thrust the San Diego Union and the Los Angeles Examiner at you simultaneously in shrill competition.\n\nBeside the Fair, San Diego pins her faith to the Canal (she is the nearest Pacific port on American soil), the “Harbor of the Sun,” her remarkable climate, and the S. D. & A. R. R. The harbor is the best on the Californian coast after San Francisco, and the city has already put a million dollars into docks and bulkheads. The climate is undeniably fine. The mean winter temperature of sixty is only eight degrees below the summer average, and only twice a year may the thermometer be expected to show ninety degrees.\n\nThe S. D. & A. R. R. may not sound familiar. At the close of the last fiscal year its rolling stock consisted of two locomotives and ninety-eight cars, and its total earnings for the year had been $11,828. But San Diego has no particular interest in the present. The San Diego and Arizona Railroad is intended to connect the coast with the Southern Pacific system at Seeley, California, in the Imperial Valley, and when that is accomplished it will be the shortest route to the Pacific and the cheapest route to the East (via the Canal) for a rapidly developing section of the Southwest. Forty-five of its 138 miles in the mountains are still to be built, and this project, like thousands of others, waits for peace. There are other railroad connections projected or rumored, but it is this which holds most hope for San Diego, which now has only a single track spur of the Santa Fe running down from Los Angeles.\n\nParadoxically, it is the desert which will enrich the city when the road is finished. It taps the Imperial Valley, in the southwestern corner of California, that miracle of irrigation which was utterly barren fourteen years ago, and now shows an assessed property valuation of $36,600,000. Cotton, first grown there in 1909, was in 1912 showing the highest yield per acre in the country, and the short-staple cotton raised in the valley took the prize cup at the American Land and Irrigation Exposition in 1911 as the best in the United States. Dates and melons can be grown well, and there are also alfalfa, barley, oats, wheat, corn, grapes, apricots, olives, and citrus fruits. To the south, in Mexico, and further east, lies land of the same sort waiting for development.\n\nSan Diego expects, of course, to ship from much wider areas than this, and in fact aspires to turn her location and California’s abundant fuel, petroleum, to account as a great manufacturing center. It is carefully explained in the official Exposition publication that “the prime object of the San Diego Exposition was not to help the city of San Diego by direct methods, as had been the case with previous world’s fairs, but first to the interest of the Western states on whose good feeling San Diego is, of course, dependent for future prosperity.” So Kansas, Utah, Montana, New Mexico, Nevada and Washington are guests at San Diego, with separate buildings which, one hopes, are substations of “good feeling.”\n\nAt least San Diego has put a most attractive portrait of herself on exhibition. IF the city’s expectations seem somewhat disproportionate to her present importance, one must remember the California habit of growing incontinently. The state claimed from twenty-first place to twelfth between 1900 and 1910, with a sixty percent increase in population, and still has only half as many people to the square mile as the average for the United States. The San Joaquin Valley — the great central garden of the state — is about the size of Italy; it holds 300,000 people to Italy’s 35,000,000. California can afford to draw on her future — even if her real estate operators have already discounted it pretty generously — for the cost of two big fairs, and San Diego’s investment in the garden city on the mesa is good business for a forward-looking seaport.\n\nJuly, 1915, Santa Fe Magazine, Vol. 9, No. 8. 36-39. San Diego Exposition Jottings.\n\nStolid red men and women from all sections of the Southwest, inhabitants of the Santa Fe’s “Painted Desert” on the Isthmus, gathered in wonderment in the Indian Arts Building and listened intently to the voice of the Great White Father. They heard President Wilson’s message to the American Indian given through a Columbia phonograph record, in which form the message was carried to every Indian reservation in the country by the Wanamaker expedition.\n\nOne of the visitors to San Diego is Mrs. Isa Maude Ilsen, a warm admirer of Thomas Edison. When she found that in San Diego there were Indians who were not on their reservations at the time of the expedition she gained permission to send the record here.\n\nThe message is significant, being an appeal to the redmen to take full advantage of their educational and industrial opportunities, and to consider themselves “not as children, but as brothers of the white man.”\n\nAttracting much attention in the entertainment of distinguished visitors to the San Diego Exposition is O. J. Stough, San Diego’s ninety-seven year-old young man. Probably no person in San Diego takes more delight in entertaining visitors than does Mr. Stough, a retired capitalist. He has appointed himself a committee of one on entertainment. Each morning he makes a round of the leading hotels in his automobile, becomes acquainted with visitors and either takes them to the exposition or places his car at their disposal. When the New Mexico Building was dedicated this youthful nonagenarian was a loyal New Mexican. When Missouri Day was celebrated he transferred his affections to this state and entertained visitors from there. When Governor Goldsborough and the Maryland party were here, Stough was a Marylander.\n\nImportant additions to the comprehensive display at the San Diego Exposition have been placed in the last few days in the form of thirty wall charts prepared by the United States National Museum to supplement the big collection of anthropological studies in the Science of Man Building.\n\nWith the placing of these charts there has been issued a pamphlet written by Dr. Alex Hrdlicka of the museum, one of the foremost anthropologists of the world, under whose personal supervision were collected and arranged the specimens from all parts of the universe. He features this display as the most complete in existence and calls attention to the fact that many of the most important features have never before been presented, even in part. The expeditions send out by the exposition and the museum for the specimens touched every continent.\n\nParticular attention is directed to this display as the most important single feature for the exposition summer school which opened on July 5 for a six-week session in which educators from all parts of country are enrolled as students. The faculty is made up of specialists in many fields of education, and the courses consist largely of lectures based on the exhibits of a scientific nature. There are enlisted also the skill of the Indians, used to demonstrate the existing arts and crafts of the Indian Southwest, supplement the display of old-time arts and crafts as practiced by Incas, Mayas, Aztecs, long before the coming of white men.\n\nSide by side in the room devoted to the history of the yellow-brown race, in which Dr. Hrdlicka classifies the Indians, are panels of the ______ found in southern Siberia. Stripped of their characteristic ornaments, the figures are identical. The juxtaposition calls attention of the probable oriental original of the American Indian.\n\nHow near San Diego came to ______ its commercial upbuilding to the exertions of the common people has been brought out in documents uncovered by the United States ____ Commission and the Daughters of the Mormon Battalion, in the arrangement _____ for the celebration on July 17, 1915 of Utah Day.\n\nOn this date it appears that the Mormon Battalion of five hundred men and women tramped overland from Fort Leavenworth to San Diego in 1846-1847 for participation in the Mexican War and after terrifying hardships in the _____, they remained in San Diego for several months. It is said that they built the courthouse, the first schoolhouse, the first cement paving, dug the first _____ wells and, in other ways, so won the admiration of the Spanish people here that when the regiment was mustered out, there was a request that they remain at San Diego. Part of the battalion went on to Utah, by way of the Sacramento Valley and is said to have discovered the first gold at Sutter Creek. In these and other ways the battalion contributed importantly to western development. It is worth mentioning that the inspiration for irrigation work was ____ by examination of the famous irrigation project at the old mission of San Diego de Alcala, built shortly after the arrival of the padres in 1769 — the first project of this sort in the country, and still being capable of operation. The Mormons did a good deal of work in this line in San Diego and on their arrival in Utah simply transplanted the idea, thus developing many thousands of acres in that new territory which, without irrigation, would have remained quite hopeless for agriculture.\n\nThe record kept by Chief Yeoman Pitkin, in charge of the United States Navy exhibit, shows that in one day there registered at his display visitors from forty-one states and a score of foreign countries.\n\nArrangements are being made for a visit by a big delegation of Indians from Glacier National Park, who wish to hold a pow-wow at the San Diego Exposition as a part of their stay on the coast.\n\nSan Diego already has the giant display of southwest Indian life in the “Painted Desert,” and also in demonstration work in the Indian Arts Building. But there is nothing in the permanent exhibits pertaining to Indian life of the northwest. With a view to filling this gap the exposition is cooperating with the Glacier National Park management in bringing the display to San Diego.\n\nAttractiveness of the San Diego Exposition and the realization of the benefits to be derived from exhibiting at it are the reasons why a plan has been launched to place an immense Chinese exhibit at the exposition. This exhibit will be made by the Chinese government. Interested in it are a number of influential Chinese merchants and government officials who recently visited here.\n\nThe scheme which these proposed was to have shipped here a great quantity of exhibit material originally intended for the San Francisco exposition but which was not placed for lack of room. The exhibits coming here will be about half as comprehensive as those at the northern fair, yet the whole will be featured in a manner which will make the completed display compare favorably to any ever seen at any exposition.\n\n“San Diego’s Sixty-One, are ______. For two brief days these bachelors occupied the highest pinnacle, being used as escorts for the sixty-one American beauties who were brought to the San Diego exposition direct from Union City, the mecca of their journey on the Santa Fe last month as guests of Universal Film Manufacturing Company. For two days they were _____. But on the next they were jeered at not only by unsuccessful rivals but also by the beauties of San Diego.\n\n“We’re going to organize a male beauty contest,” says the Bachelor Girls Protective Association. “If eligible young women are brought in to compete with us, we will retaliate by importing eligible young men.”\n\nAcross the bay from San Diego is the beautiful island of Coronado. Here congregate many people from all over the United States to spend the summer at the famous Hotel Del Coronado. . . . About half a mile from the hotel lies the great Coronado Tent City, wherein accommodations for thousands are afforded in spacious, clean tents and individual cottages with their comfortable equipment.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Union, 4:6, San Diegans plan to keep exhibits; museum association organized for preservation of displays in Exposition.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Union, 5:1. People’s Chorus (200 voices) under direction of Willibald Lehmann will give a concert as the concluding feature of Christian Endeavor Day with the Spreckels Organ tonight.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Union, 9:1. Aerial fireworks purchased by Fair; elaborate pyrotechnic displays to be shown July 3-5: Contracts signed yesterday between the Panama-California Exposition and the Wilison-Los Angeles Fireworks Company, provide what will probably prove the greatest program of aerial fireworks entertainment ever attempted in Southern California.\n\nBoth daylight and evening displays have been arranged for the afternoon and night of July 3, and the afternoon and evening program of July 5. The afternoon programs are replete with spectacular pieces and will prove quite as entertaining as those to be used in the evening, according to officers of the fireworks concern.\n\nAt 8 o’clock Saturday night the tower of the California Building, the tallest in the city, will blaze forth in light and color for a period of twenty-five minutes. Another feature will be the lighting of the entire grounds by a set piece with a series of the brightest lights known to the ingenuity of man. The entire center of the Exposition will be lighted as though the sun were at the noon-day position.\n\n“War,” represented by an immense modern siege gun firing shells at a fort which finally falls under the tremendous fire, is another of the big events prominent for Saturday night. Festoons of jewels will be suspended from the sky, American eagles will spread their wings in the air, Niagara Falls with a torrent of silvery fire will fall from somewhere above and the evening will end with a representation of the opening of the Panama Canal.\n\nMonday afternoon, another program of daylight fireworks will be given and Monday night another great pyrotechnic display will be given. Waterfalls, Jacob’s ladder, mystic wheel, butterflies and roses, an aerial thunderstorm, a fan fire which will cover an acre of territory in the sky, silver ______ and many other equally spectacular sights will be shown.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Herald, 1:5. Exposition Notes: The largest crow which the San Diego Exposition has entertained since the opening night New Year’s Eve surged through the tree gates to the Fair on a balmy evening of last week and crammed every available inch in the Plaza de Panama and the Plaza de los Estados, to hear the first of the summer evening recitals by Mme. Ernestine Schumann-Heink, the great contralto whose country place lies just east of the city of San Diego.\n\nMme. Schumann-Heink is extremely popular in Southern California, where she has lived for a good part of the time during recent years, and was accorded a great reception by the schoolchildren of the city early in the spring on her first visit to the Exposition. At that time she assured them that she would be back in June and would give a full evening’s concert for them. When her arrangements were completed she informed the Exposition that she was asking only one favor, namely, that every child under sixteen be admitted to the grounds free. The request was granted and the youngsters made up fully twenty percent of the enormous crowd which attended the recital.\n\nIn addition to the people seated in the Plaza de los Estados on benches and along the curbs of the Esplanade and standing on lawns and pavements, the roofs of the nearby buildings, even of the peristyles of the organ itself, were loaded down with people.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Sun, 14:4. La Jolla playground to open Saturday.\n\nJuly 1, 1915, San Diego Union, 19:1. Odd Fellows due tomorrow for three days fun.\n\nJuly 2, 1915. Board of Park Commissioners, Minutes: Secretary to advise Order of Panama that mounted cavalry would not be permitted on Stadium field, as such exhibitions will tear up the field.\n\nCommissioner Ferris said Board did not have sufficient funds to purchase the animals at Wonderland Zoo, but said Board would accept the animals, or any part of them, if the cost of moving them to the park and one year’s maintenance should be included; Recommendation accepted.\n\nJuly 2, 1915, San Diego Sun, 1:3-6. 5:7-8.

Tiny Broadwick to leap from sky: Interest which the public displays in aeronautical events, particularly when one is fraught with an unusually spectacular feature, was established yesterday when the Exposition was besieged with inquiries regarding the time at which Miss Tiny Broadwick, the daring young aviator, will give her demonstration of the aerial life preserver invented by Charles Broadwick, her father.\n\nConferring with the Exposition yesterday, Miss Broadwick announced her willingness to make these demonstrations at any time of the day or night, again expressing implicit faith in her father’s invention to carry her safely to the ground after she leaps from the aeroplane at a high altitude. Considering that this feat can be seen better by visitors during the day, the two demonstrations were set for 2 o’clock Sunday afternoon and 2 o’clock Monday afternoon. Each will be held on the big tractor field around which there is a great amount of space where spectators can stand and get a good view of the performance.\n\nOscar A. Brindley, government Aero instructor at North Island, will pilot the aeroplane from which Miss Broadwick will leap.\n\nMiss Broadwick does not appear worried or concerned about the hazardous feats confronting her at the Exposition Sunday and Monday afternoons. As she discussed the workings of this aerial life preserver yesterday, not a word which might indicate fear was in her conversation.\n\n“To tell the truth,” said the daring young woman, “I feel just as much at home jumping out of an aeroplane with my father’s life preserver as I would if sitting on the front steps. Of course, one must understand aeronautics to a certain extent to perform such a feat successfully, but I have had experience, and I know it is impossible for the device to fail. The exhibitions which I gave at North Island for army officers convinced me thoroughly of the dependability of the preserver.\n\n“In the demonstrations of Sunday and Monday, I intend to jump from a much greater distance than I have ever done before, as I want to demonstrate thoroughly to the public that the dangers of aviation will be greatly reduced through use of this device.”\n\nJuly 2, 1915, San Diego Union,, 8:1. 2,000 Odd Fellows ready to parade tomorrow.\n\nJuly 2, 1915, San Diego Union, 8:3.

Exposition to shatter attendance mark today; thousands of Odd Fellows, Imperial Valley delegates and others will invade Fair grounds as July 4th celebration begins.\n\nWith the arrival of about 3,000 Southern California Odd Fellows, several hundred members of the National Editorial Association, a large delegation from Imperial Valley for the celebration of Imperial Valley County Day and the beginning of the festivities in honor of the Fourth of July, it is predicted the Exposition will set a new attendance record.\n\nOne of the biggest events of today’s celebration will be the parade of Odd Fellows which will form at Lower Broadway and march to the Laurel Street entrance of the Fair via Sixth Street. The parade will be led by the Pacific Electric band, which has been engaged for the three-day’s celebration, the Pomona band, and the Santa Ana band. At the Plaza de Panama, Mayor E. M. Capps will welcome the visitors to the city and President G. A. Davidson will welcome them to the Exposition.\n\nThe next event of importance will be at noon at the Southern California Counties Building, where 20,000 cantaloupes will be given away as an advertisement for Imperial Valley. At noon the Cristobal Café will be crowded, for the members of the National Editorial Association will be guests of the Exposition at luncheon, and scores of Odd Fellows and their friends have reserved tables.\n\nBetween 1:20 and 5:00 in the afternoon the Pacific Electric and Pomona bands will entertain with concerts at the Plaza de Panama. The usual organ recital by Dr. Humphrey J. Stewart will also be given.\n\nAll Southern California cantons of Odd Fellows have entered the competitive drill contests, which will be held during the afternoon at the Plaza de Panama, and which will be judged by U.S. Army officers. At 3:00 p.m. a display of daylight fireworks will be given at the north end of the Alameda. Provision has been made for spectators on the tractor field.\n\nThe feature of the evening’s entertainment will be a great open-air ball to be held at the Plaza de Panama. Some time during the event President Davidson will present the winning drill team of Odd Fellows with its prize. Band concerts will be held on the Isthmus between 7:30 and midnight.\n\nAt 8:00 p.m. the pyrotechnic illumination of the tower of the California Building will be given, after which a display of fireworks will be given at the north end of the Alameda. A feature of the fireworks program will be a cruise of the warship San Diego to the first port of call. This spectacular piece is 500 ft. in length and the makers claim it will prove one of the most stupendous undertakings of the kind ever attempted.\n\nToday’s program includes amusements of every kind, and members of the special events committee believe they have formulated one of the best programs of the year.\n\nAs is well known, the Independence Day festivities extend over a period of three days — today, Sunday and Monday. The biggest feature of the Sunday afternoon program will be the leap from an aeroplane at an altitude of 3,000 feet by Miss Tiny Broadwick in her aerial alighting device. At 4:00 p.m., Ellen Beach Yaw will be the soloist at the daily organ recital. She will give another concert at 8:00 p.m.\n\nMonday, Miss Tiny Broadwick will repeat her trick from an aeroplane, a children’s parade of the “Sprit of ‘76” will be held on the grounds of the Exposition; there will be the usual band concerts and organ recitals, the day to be concluded with another but entirely different program of fireworks.\n\nVisitors are flocking to the city from all parts of the West and it is predicted that by tonight every hotel in the downtown district will be crowded.\n\nJuly 3, 1915, San Diego Union, 2:1. 2,000 schoolchildren will participate in Spirit of ’76 parade tomorrow; $150 in currency offered in prizes; free admission to Exposition promised for children in costume; hundreds of youngsters selected as bearers of huge American flag; parade leaves Pepper Grove at 2 p.m. and marches to the Plaza de Panama where it will be reviewed by society women of city standing on steps on Sacramento Valley Building.\n\nJuly 3, 1915, San Diego Union, 3:4.

Brazilian exhibit opened; description of products; vast resources shown; tireless efforts of Dr. Eugenio Dahne obtain coffee, rubber and other products; animals and birds procured; drinks given away\n\nA Brazilian exhibit in the Commerce and Industries Building, at the Panama-California Exposition, has been opened under the direction of Dr. Eugenio Dahne, who as been a tireless worker in his country for an exhibit at San Diego’s Fair.\n\nDr. Dahne came to San Diego several years ago with Brazilian commissioners and for a time prospects seemed good for a Brazilian building at the Fair. This was later given up, and since that time Dr. Dahne has been trying to get an exhibit here. He has finally succeeded, and a large space in the Commerce and Industries Building has been devoted to Brazilian products, pictures, birds, live animals peculiar to that country, manufactured goods and matter pertaining to a country in which at the present time there is a great interest by Americans. The exhibit was open for the first time Monday and will continue, with Dr. Dahne in charge, until the close of the Fair.\n\nBrazil is not represented at the San Francisco Exposition, and that it is represented at all at the San Diego Exposition is due entirely to the energy and perseverance of Dr. Eugenio Dahne, the former commissioner-general, representing the ministerium of agriculture, industry and commerce of Brazil in the United States and Canada.\n\nWar Hampers Plans\n\nWhen the Brazilian congress last year decided that on account of the severe financial crisis and the failure to raise the loan the government was negotiating in Europe, on account of the outbreak of the war, Brazil could not afford at the time to be represented at either of the California Expositions, Dr. Eugenio Dahne, who had been working hard for several years to arrange for that representation, resigned from office and set to work to arrange a private Brazilian exhibit.\n\nFor this purpose he left for Brazil, via New York, on January 3 and returned a month ago. He succeeded in getting the government of the state of Sao Paulo to contribute a certain quantity of its best coffee free. The government of Parana contributed about two tons of mate, the great Brazilian health tea. The rubber states of Para, Ohyaronas, Matto Grorro contributed a quantity of rubber, and Rio Grande de Sul its products. Other products, curios, skins and live birds and animals Dr. Dahne brought on his own account to make his show more interesting..\n\nThus the Brazilian exhibit is not by any means an official government exhibit, nor does it represent but a small percentage of Brazil’s enormous natural resources. It is entirely a private undertaking and an exhibit of a collection of interesting things from Brazil which Dr. Dahne was able to gather together in the shortness of time. Every praise is accorded to Dr. Dahne by the Exposition for his temerity and perseverance.\n\nGreat thought and taste was given to the arrangement of the exhibits, the fundamental idea being to impress the visitor with the manifold resources of Brazil, the great importance of some of them, and the interesting features and beauty of the country.\n\nThus, commencing in the north, there is the Amazon district, with its important rubber industry. One sees a wild jungle scene on the Amazon river, with a rubber-gatherer’s two-story hut, the “Roosevelt cabin,” covered with hunters’ trophies and animals. There is a collection of the different kinds of rubber produced in Brazil, and photographs showing the processes of extracting and preparing the same.\n\nNext is a collection of samples of fine cabinet woods, from the hardest to the softest, some of them beautifully grained.\n\nThis is complemented by a collection of nuts and fruit from the different palms and trees, bark and leaves. A miniature coconut plantation shows how the cocoa palms propagate and grow. A native basket, with great ground nuts, shows how the Brazil nuts grow in clusters inside the same. The most interesting, however, is the spaucai nut, a huge fruit containing about a dozen nuts. When green, a lid closes the bottom tight and holds the nuts in place. When the fruit is ripe, the lid dries up, contracts and falls out, allowing the nuts to fall to the ground.\n\nCoffee Section Represented\n\nThe central part of Brazil, the “coffee” section, is represented by the state of Sao Paulo, which produces four-fifths of the coffee grown in Brazil and supplies two-thirds of the coffee consumed in the world. Large panels on the wall show how the coffee is grown, how it is picked, and how it is shipped, while all along the front of the counter and along the background stand long lines of the original bags with coffee as they were shipped at Santos.\n\nOn a neat little “deer” roaster, the original Santos coffee, pure, without blending, will be roasted fresh every day and served free every day, prepared Brazilian fashion over the counter from 2 to 5 o’clock p.m. every day. The same coffee, roast and ground, will be sold in packages to those who wish to take some home or send some to their friends. Over the coffee counter sits a pair of beautifully plumaged birds, the trogan or “coffee bird,” which feeds on coffee berries and says that Sao Paulo coffee tastes best.\n\nNext is the “mate” counter. Mate is the tea prepared from the leaves of a tree, the ilex paraguavenases. The only place in the world where this tree grows is in the states of Parania and Rio Grande de Sul and Paraguay. It is an exceedingly refreshing drink, not a stimulant like coffee or tea, but a clamant and an excellent tonic for indigestion and weak stomachs.\n\nDrink Served Free\n\nThe Indians and the Gauchos, or cowboys of Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile ,use no other drink. And to judge by the fine, healthy-looking figure of the Gaucho in full Rio Grandiose cowboy costume, with rich silver trappings, that stands inside the counter, it certainly must be invigorating and health giving. Mate will also be served free in cups to visitors every afternoon from 2 to 5 o’clock and sold in small packages.\n\nAbove the Gaucho hang several of the beautiful ponchos or shawls made in Rio Grande de Sul, and at his side stands a table made of the beautiful cabinet woods of Brazil.\n\nNext to the mate are samples of cocoa and of the cocoa bean, grown extensively in the states of Bahia and Para, Brazil, the latter producing some of the finest quality.\n\nAnother most interesting product of the Ohuaron forest, as yet unknown in this country, is the guarana. The guarana is a bean or nut which grows, like the vanilla, on a creeper. The Indians collect and roast these beans and pound them into a pulp, mixed with water. Of the thick pulp they mold sticks which they let dry hard in the sun. To uses it they grate with the rough bony tongue of the pirarcucu fish, about a spoonful of the stick into a gourd of water, which they drink.\n\nIt is a wonderful tonic to the system and no Indian goes without his stick of guarana, which enables him to endure the greatest fatigue. A firm in Para has lately undertaken to make an excellent effervescent drink from the guarana, very much in taste like tonic water, bottles of which are also on exhibit.\n\nAbove the guarana hands a cigar of plug tobacco, about four feet long, wound around with fibers and bearing this card: “Cigar of plug tobacco made by the Indians of the Ohuaron and presented to Colonel D. C. Collier by his Brazilian friends in remembrance of the time when he smoked his way through Brazil.” Suspended from the cigar are the little black clay pipes in which Indians smoke this tobacco.\n\nNext are the foodstuffs, the most interesting of which is the maniok flour, one of the most important foodstuffs in Brazil. The maniok is a cultivated root, somewhat like a sweet potato, however with a very poisonous juice, containing much prussic acid. To remove this the roots are grated into a pulp, which is filled into long basket tubes. By pulling these, they contract and force out the juice. The pulp is then dried in hot pans and put into conical baskets. The maniok flour contains much starch and is very nourishing.\n\nThere are samples of arrowroot and of tapioca. Also of macaroni, vermicelli and noodles and cakes of fine chocolate made in Para.\n\nAn extensive collection of curios of all kinds, photographs, maps and books on Brazil, and live tropical birds and monkeys completes the exhibit, which is one of the most interesting and instructive in the grounds and does credit to its organizer, Dr. Eugenio Dahne.\n\nJuly 7, 1915, San Diego Sun, 7:1.

During the first six months it did not draw the crowds that it was reasonable to expect and which its excellence justified. However, the last few days showed a marked improvement in the attendance, and while the original expectations will not be fulfilled, the Fair will be a greater success than the first months indicated.\n\nDue credit should be given to the management for the successful manner in which the original plans for the Exposition were carried to a perfection never before attained at an Exposition. But it should not be forgotten that the stockholders, the men and women who furnished the money, are also entitled t consideration for the most important part they performed in furnishing the millions necessary to pay for work, material and supervision of the work during the time of construction.\n\nThe Exposition has already done wonders for San Diego by making it known in every hamlet of the nation, and from the publicity received the city has grown much faster than it would otherwise have done. This benefit has been general — which the shareholders paid for and from which they derive no benefit such as shareholders in other enterprises are supposed to enjoy. As Expositions are for the community benefit, it places a burden on the shareholders which is out of proportion to their benefit.\n\nMany of these shareholders are men and women who, to meet their payments, have deprived themselves of many comforts and some have even sacrificed the necessities. Would it not be a matter of justice that these shareholders should get some slight benefit from their investments? Some of them have been so heavily taxed during these hard times they cannot afford the expense to enjoy a visit to the beautiful Exposition which their money made possible.\n\nIn this connection, we wish to suggest that passes ought to be issued to all shareholders for the balance of the Exposition year. No doubt, many of the shareholders, in addition to paying for their stock, have bought season tickets, but more of them have not because they could not afford it. None of the shareholders expect any dividends from their investment, and all would appreciate such courtesies as was extended to them in recognition of what they had done for the Exposition.\n\nOf course, this courtesy would be most appreciated by those who cannot afford the cost of attending the Exposition as often as they desire. But even those who can afford the expense and have already bought their season tickets, would feel that it was a recognition of what they had done for the Exposition. It has been the policy of the management to discourage the given of passes, and, perhaps, wisely so. But furnishing season tickets to the shareholders is only furnishing them what they have dearly paid for.\n\nBesides doing justice to the shareholders, it will really benefit the Exposition, as these shareholders will naturally induce some of their friends to go with them. And, as a crowd always attracts, the presence of so many people would induce others to attend the Fair, and all these people would spend more or less money with the concessionaires.\n\nThe Order of Panama has also done good work for the Exposition and members of the Order have borne all the expense of their part of the work. It seems to use that the Exposition management should also show its appreciation of this work by furnishing season tickets to all members of the Order of Panama. Not that they have done as much as the shareholders, but they have certainly done enough to be given recognition.\n\nThe management was no doubt right in preventing a flood of passes to be issued. But it is right to discriminate between those who have earned recognition and those who have not. The shareholders have no reason to hope for a return of any great part of the money they contributed to the building of the beautiful Exposition, so they are entitled to his much and even more.\n\nJuly 8, 1915, San Diego Union, 2:2-3.

William Jennings Bryan, guest at Exposition, spoke to audience estimated at 6,000 on “The Causeless War.”\n\nBefore an audience estimated at 6,000 persons, William Jennings Bryan yesterday delivered his now widely-known lecture on “The Causeless War” from the platform of the Spreckels Organ. The address was an effort to show that the present European conflict is without cause and without justification. It was also a plea for peace and a warning to the United States to keep out of the struggle at almost any cost in order that this country, the greatest of the neutral powers, should be in a position to act as a mediator when the belligerents are ready to listen to overtures for peace.\n\nOn the platform were many of San Diego’s prominent citizens and when President Davidson, in introducing Colonel Fred Jewell as chairman of the meeting, referred to Bryan as the great apostle of peace whose presence was an honor to the Exposition, there were rounds of wild applause. Jewell added to the enthusiasm when he declared that Bryan had more friends and acquaintances than any man in the United States.\n\nThe great Commoner wore a black alpaca coat, similar t the one he made famous in the 1896 campaign, and during his talk of nearly two hours yesterday he kept on his head a gray silk cap, complaining that the sun of California has demonstrated its powers on his head on one occasion and he did not care to give it another chance.\n\nJust before beginning his address a pitcher of grape juice was placed before the speaker, and the great crowd was pleased when he drank a glass of the beverage. Praising San Diego for its progressiveness and its hospitality, Bryan lamented the fact that the beautiful Exposition should be destroyed at the end of the year and expressed his wish that it might be perpetuated for many years to come to the delight of thousands of visitors who will come to San Diego after the end of the year.\n\nUpon his arrival at President Davidson’s office in the morning, an impromptu reception was tendered the former secretary of stage and a performance by the Spanish dancers and singers was given in the president’s office for his benefit. After a tour of the Exposition in company with Mrs. Bryan and a luncheon at the Cristobal Café as the guests of President Davidson, Bryan expressed himself as astonished at the beauty of the buildings and the arrangement of the grounds. The Bryan party left last night on the midnight train after a banquet at the Cristobal.\n\n(From his introductory remarks)\n\n“I have enjoyed the Exposition today. I don’t know how you feel about it, but it seems to me that it will be a great sacrifice not only to your interests, but to the pleasure of those who are coming to San Diego in the future, to let your Exposition terminate this year.” (Applause.)\n\n“These buildings are too beautiful to be torn down when twelve months have passed, and I hope that you will find it possible to allow them to adorn this magnificent park and be a permanent attraction to your already attractive city.” (Applause.)\n\nJuly 18, 1915, San Diego Union, 1:3.

King Joy crowned by Elks host on Isthmus; great crowd throngs carnival street: One of the biggest and merriest crowds which every attended an Exposition jollification, swarmed the Isthmus last night when thousands of Elks from every part of the country held their joy carnival. Fun began early and lasted until late and the jolly members of the antlered tribe turned the joy way into a whirl of gaiety.\n\nThe great crowd, which has earlier in the day attended the Utah celebration at the Organ Pavilion and later heard William Jennings Bryan, was augmented last night by thousands of amusement seekers intent on having a good time. The half mile of light never blazed more brilliantly and never was the carnival spirit more pronounced. The good-natured crowd rambled from one amusement place to another, taking them all in and then going back for a second trip through those which had proven most attractive.\n\nAs early as 6 p.m. Isthmus eating places were filled to capacity. The rush was maintained throughout the evening, scores awaiting in line, in many instances to gain admission.\n\nThe Cristobal Café, always a popular resort, was the scene of two dinners last night, several hundred in attendance at each one — the Utah dinner and the William Jennings Bryan dinner. The Utah people occupied one section of the café and the Bryan admirers the other.\n\nJuly 18, 1915, San Diego Union, 7:2-3.

La Jolla playground is great attraction.\n\nJuly 22, 1915, San Diego Herald, 2:2. Preserve the Exposition Buildings: There is talk of having the Exposition through another year. The idea is an excellent one. Whether it is done or not, the buildings which adorn the grounds should be taken over by the city and kept as long as they can be preserved in good condition. The Santa Fe exhibit should be kept as it is, an attractive feature of any park.\n\nMany of the buildings can be devoted to educational purposes and nothing invites to a city a better class of people than great educational institutions. A Pan-American university, as suggested by Judge Glidden, would be of incalculable benefit, by its effect on the South American republics, and by drawing us into closer relations to them. Other educational institutions would also be of value.\n\nThese buildings, if sold for scrap, will bring little value. The city by becoming the purchaser, could have, at a nominal cost, what would be worth almost as much as the original cost of the buildings. Besides, their value for educational purposes, they would be an attraction which would bring many visitors to the city. Will the Mayor and Council give consideration to this suggestion?\n\nJuly 22, 1915, San Diego Sun, 1:4. Moose parade to mark gala night of entire week.\n\nJuly 22, 1915, San Diego Sun, 14:3.

Shriners storm Exposition Joy Way; nobles as spielers enrich show places.\n\nJuly 25, 1915, San Diego Union, 7:1-3. Indian sacred festival pictures were stolen from New Mexico Building.\n\nA forced bolt on a rear window, a rifled strong-box, and a rudely sprawled note of explanation, in primitive halting English, were the revelations of loss which confronted Waldo C. Twitchell, assistant manager of the New Mexico building, when he returned to his office last night about 8:30 to complete some work “on hand” after dining at the Cristobal.\n\nEvidence of a hurried search and quick work were observed by Twitchell as he unlocked the door and glanced hastily around to see if anything among the exhibits had been purloined, but when his search led him to the tower room, where the films of the motion pictures given daily at the building are stored, it became evident what had been desired by the intruders.\n\nThe note lying on the floor told it all — a reel of films had been taken because they depicted a phase of life among the Taos Indians in New Mexico which they considered too sacred to be thrown upon a screen for the entertainment of unbelievers and had been taken secretly and contrary to the laws of the tribe.\n\nThe film in question was one taken at the Fiesta of San Geronimo of Taos, New Mexico — a harvest festival, held usually on September 30 and October 1, of which some of the features are considered too sacred for reproduction by unauthorized persons. A quaint blending of the religious with something to amuse occurs in the ceremonial, among others, a relay race, the winner of which has the privilege of naming the governor of the tribe for the ensuing year.\n\nThe note, which bore evidence of the education received from the white man, combined with Indian cunning, read as follows:\n\n“Bad mediceen – indians have bad luck – all sick. Pichers of race must burn – indians all get weel.”\n\nThis explained the whole thing. The Indians learned that a picture of the festival had been taken including the forbidden features, and their superstitious nature led them to attribute sickness and ill fortune which visited the pueblo this year to the “jinx” cast on them by the picture.\n\nGovernor Unpopular\n\nAmong other things, the governor chosen by the winner of the race had proved unpopular, and this misfortune could have come only because the taking of the picture was “bad mediceen.”\n\nA number of the Taos Indians are among those at the “Painted Desert” concession of the Santa Fe Railway on the Isthmus, and all of them have been made welcome at the New Mexico building. When the building was dedicated, May 3, many of the Indians gave characteristic dances in the patio, and were allowed to use the tower room, where the films were stored, as a dressing room.\n\nThis was the opportunity which the ultra-religionists among them had waited for patiently, with the cunning of their race, and they evidently improved it well, to get a knowledge of the room and where the profaning pictures were kept.\n\nBelief Is Building Was Watched\n\nSince that night it is believed they have watched the building and studied the habits of those in charge until last night the opportunity presented itself, in the early hours of darkness, during Twitchell’s absence, to obtain possession of the “wicked” device of the white man which they believed had cast an evil spell upon the pueblo.\n\nSatisfied that in all probability the over-zealous and superstitious Indians had taken the film, and that in their anxiety to turn bad medicine into good medicine, they would immediately destroy the picture — doubtless had done so — Twitchell did some quick thinking. He recalled that the negative and one spare print of the film were safely stored in the vault of the state museum at Santa Fe and he immediately sent a letter to Paul A. F. Walter, in charge of the museum, explaining the details and asking that the spare film be sent at once, and at the same time suggesting redoubled vigilance over the negative.\n\nWalter is expected to ship the reel today, so that no interruption, or only a slight one, will result in place of what promised to be delay, and would have been if no duplicate had been obtainable.\n\nIndians Gave Warning\n\nSome of the Indians of the Painted Desert, whom Twitchell had known for years in Santa Fe, warned him sometime ago that the Taos Indians were wrought over the fact that pictures of one of their sacred religious rites had been made and that these pictures were being exhibited daily for the entertainment of scoffers, thereby offending the denizens of the spirit world, especially those of evil intent.\n\nTwitchell thought his friends were unduly nervous and apprehensive and paid little attention to the warning, beyond making sure that everything was secure about the building when it was closed in the evening.\n\nMuch sickness and bad luck had visited the Taos Pueblo, four miles distant from the town of Taos, New Mexico. The governor of the tribe had been unpopular, and things generally seem to have been at “sixes and sevens,” all of which the Indians laid at the door of the paleface’s pictures, taken in spite of watchfulness and against their time-honored laws.\n\nFilm Believed Destroyed\n\nIndian friends had told Twitchell that the film would be destroyed if the Indians succeeded in getting possession of it, and this prophecy no doubt came true last night, within a short time after the building had been entered and the reel taken. The destruction of the “jinx” inhabiting the film probably was accompanied with ceremonial incantations and religious rites to exorcise the evil spirits and restore health, peace and happiness to the troubled pueblo of Taos.\n\nMembers of the Painted Desert were absolutely true to all traditions of Indian stoicism when seen last night and did not betray by so much as a twitch of an eyelash that they knew anything of the theft of the film from the New Mexico building. Even those who had given friendly warning were silent. But by a process of elimination, reinforced by a note found by Twitchell on the floor of the film room, it seems indisputable that no other elements than religious superstition and zeal entered into the quiet, but effective work accomplished amid the shadows of the first hours of darkness last night.\n\nDuplicate Due Soon\n\nThe work was ineffective, however, in that the duplicate film will be on its way to San Diego within a few hours and the daily program at the New Mexico building will be interrupted by scarcely a ripple of delay. Twitchell felt assured on this point last night.\n\nThe pictures shown on the purloined film are considered wonderful and are the first and only ones of their kind ever made. Likewise, they probably will be the last, so long as Indian superstition remains, for eternal vigilance has been the watchword of the Taos ever since the fiesta of last autumn, when the pictures were secured in a remarkable way.\n\nWhat thousands of dollars had proven an insufficient lure to obtain came easily at the touch of friendship and a few trifling baubles and sweetmeats. A large motion picture corporation has offered $5,000 the year previous for the privilege of filming the fiesta of San Geronimo, but the offer was refused promptly and firmly on account of religious scruples.\n\nFriendship Wins Way\n\nWhile securing material for the New Mexico exhibit at the Panama-California Exposition, the Board of Education Managers for the Sunshine state cast covetous glances on the characteristic dances of the Taos Indians, realizing what an important asset such an attraction would make in presenting a passing phase of the life of the redmen.\n\nHere friendship came into play and a generous supply of grease paint, seen now as part of the personal adornment of the dancers in the film, was given out judiciously where it would do the most good. Anything which pleases the eye of the spectacle-loving aborigine, appeals to his vanity and that which tickles his palate also has an appeal to the primitive mind. Realizing this, the ambassadors from the New Mexico Board of Exposition Managers were lavish in gifts of watermelon, soda water and flattery. Lucullus proved strong where Crossus had been impotent.\n\nCaution Necessary\n\nWhen the time came during the festival for filming the display, great caution and vigilance were necessary as the ultra-superstitious might at any time smash the camera, destroy the film and inflict injury upon the “profaners of the temple.”\n\nAn experienced Connecticut Yankee, who knew the Indians and their customs as well as the camera gam, was secured as an operator and succeeded in filming the events of the fiesta without interference until the sacred relay race was started, when a watchful Indian discovered the camera and put a tin cap over the lens.\n\nThe resourceful camera man obtained another can, out of which the bottom was cut, and secretly substituted it for the other, then moved away from the camera to divert suspicion, first asking a white woman visitor to turn the crank of the machine without attracting attention.\n\nScreen “Scoop” Obtained\n\nIn this manner the picture was obtained, in the face of great obstacles, but at a small outlay of cash, scoring a decided scoop on the motion picture people who had offered a small fortune — a big one to an Indian — for the privilege. This latter fact may have worked upon the cupidity of some of the tribe, when they realized the wealth they had within their grasp, and instead has sold the privilege of a mess of grease paint.\n\nAmong the revelers at this feast of the Taos are the Koshare, or Chiffonetti, representing the spirits of the departed, who indulge in rough pranks and horseplay, such as tossing a man in a blanket, and other ministrations. On this day when the pictures were made the Chiffonetti were gaily daubed with the paint generously donated by the Board of Exposition Managers. Nevertheless, if they had fully realized that the evil spirits were to be angered by the white man’s intrusion, their horseplay would have been diverted toward the camera and its operator in deadly earnest.\n\nTruth Like Fiction\n\n“The story of securing that reel of films reads like a romance,” said Twitchell last night. “But it was a pretty serious business at the critical moments. The films never have been shown anywhere but in our chapel up to the present time. We did not dare to run them in New Mexico, much as it would have helped us in our work of arousing interest in the state’s exhibit at the Panama-California Exposition, for fear of stirring up the simple-minded and superstitious Indians to a frenzy of religious reprisal. We have four other reels of Indian life and customs, but not including anything placed under the ban, as is the stolen film. These were undamaged, showing how thoroughly the Indians had made themselves familiar with their ‘plant’ before beginning their work, and how they limited themselves strictly to the removal of the forbidden thing. I have do doubt that Paul Walton will have the spare film here in time for our next Wednesday program.”\n\nJuly 25, 1915, San Diego Union, 8:1. Governor W. S.
