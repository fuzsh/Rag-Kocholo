        "text": "1796 February 25\n\nJohn Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada, writes to the Duke of Portland, Secretary of State, confirming the need for a university.\n\n1798 December 1\n\nThe Upper Canada Executive Committee recommends that a university be established in the town of York and that half the education endowment be used for that purpose.\n\n1827 March 15\n\nAt the urging of John Strachan, Archdeacon of York, a Royal Charter is granted to establish the University of King's College at York. It was signed by Henry, 3rd Earl Bathurst, Secretary for War and the Colonies.\n\n1828\n\nKing's College Council purchases 68 acres of land in Park Lots 11, 12, and 13, but turns down the offer of 150 acres between St. George St. and Spadina Avenue. King's also acquires frontage rights on the present College Street and University Avenue, which permits it to control access to its grounds by installing gates at strategic intervals.\n\n1828 January 3\n\n225,944 acres of crown reserve lands are given to the College for its endowment.\n\n1830 January 8\n\nKing's College Council opens a secondary school, Upper Canada College, and its endowment is split with this school.\n\n1831 January 27\n\nUpper Canada Academy is established in Cobourg, opening on 18 June 1836.\n\n1840 September 5\n\nObservations begin at the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory, near what is now Convocation Hall.\n\n1841 August 27\n\nUpper Canada Academy's name is changed by provincial statute to Victoria College; teaching begins at university level in October 1842. Name changed to Victoria University on 25 March 1884.\n\n1842 April 23\n\nLaying of the cornerstone of King's College in what is now Queen's Park.\n\n1843\n\nRolph's School of Medicine is re-established by John Rolph. It had originally been established in 1832 and dissolved in 1837 following Rolph's conviction for involvement in the Upper Canada Rebellion of that year. It changed its name to the Toronto School of Medicine and incorporated in 1851.\n\n1843\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine occupies a small frame building that was constructed adjacent to the west wing of the Parliament Buildings.\n\n1843 June 8\n\nKing's College opens in the renovated Parliament Building on Front Street. 26 students sign the roll. Instruction commenced on 5 October in Arts, Law, Medicine, and Divinity.\n\n1843 Fall\n\nThe south-east wing of King's College building [site of east wing of present Legislative Buildings] in Queen's Park is completed. It remains vacant until 1845 when it opens as a residence. No other wing of the planned complex for King's College was ever built. Funds were in short supply, due to monies being spent on expensive renovations to other buildings and financial mismanagement. The latter involved, in particular, the endowment lands, the principal source of revenue, and other questionable transactions such as loaning John Strachan £5,250, of which only £1,875 was repaid.\n\n1844\n\nKnox College is established.\n\n1844\n\nJohn McCaul is appointed College librarian.\n\n1844 October 19\n\nChair of Hebrew and Oriental Languages is established at King's College but not implemented; it is succeeded two days later by a tutorship in Hebrew Language and Literature, filled by Jacob Maier Hirschfelder. When King's was replaced by the U of T in 1850, he was appointed Lecturer in Oriental Languages. Hirschfelder was the first Jew to hold a university professorship in Canada, though the exigencies of the time ensured his adherence to the Anglican Church. Howard D. Chapman, a prominent Toronto architect, is a direct descendant.\n\n1844 November 5\n\nKnox College opens under the name Theological Institution. It was established earlier in 1844 as the original Free Church College of the Presbyterian Church of Canada. The name was changed on 10 June 1846 to Knox's College.\n\n1844 December 20\n\nThe first Convocation of King's College is held in the temporary University building. \"The Hall presented one of the most gratifying scenes ever held in the Province. On the Dias were seated the authorities of the University, in full academic costumesﾅof scarlet, pink, and blue according to their degrees...In the centre, on the elevated platform, was the Right Reverend Doctor Strachan, Bishop of Toronto, as the President of the University, on whom...the duty devolved of conferring the Degrees...Five Degrees were conferred, and Four Prize Compositions were recited.\" Henry Boys, John King, George Herrick, and Joseph Hamilton were admitted ad eundem gradum (\"at the same degree\", ie., based on experience) to the degree of MD, while Frederick William Barron was awarded a Bachelor of Arts. William Ramsay is listed in Fasti Academi: annals of King's College, Toronto as being admitted ad eundem gradum to the degree of B.A. in 1844 but is listed elsewhere as an 1845 graduate.\n\n1846\n\nThe short-lived Maple Leaf, a College newspaper produced by the graduates and professors, appears.\n\n1848 July 30\n\nBowing to pressure, King's College passes a statute creating a Commission on Inquiry into the Affairs of King's College University and Upper Canada College. The final report was published in 1852.It was chaired by Joseph Workman, a prominent local physician and a lecturer at John Rolph's Toronto School of Medicine.\n\n1848 December\n\nKing's College residence closes, having continually lost money. The kitchen facilities were inadequate and the students complained about the food. Stewart Wallace, in his A history of the University of Toronto, wrote \"A variety of diet was difficult to obtain. Day after day the same pies and puddings made their appearance ﾖ apple pies being the great standby. Repeated muttering of dissent would at last arise from the students' tables, and on one occasion the inevitable apple pie from one of them was sent out of the room untouched, with a small stick in the middle of it bearing the words: ﾑThe table don't eat apple pie'.\"\n\n1849 May 30\n\nA Provincial act is passed abolishing King's College and creating the non-denominational University of Toronto, effective 1 January 1850.\n\n1849 November\n\nKing's College is forced out of the Parliament Buildings when the Canadian government returns to Toronto, and moves into the former Residence.\n\n1850\n\nTrinity College Medical Faculty is established.\n\n1850-1851\n\nThe Medical Building, designed by Thomas Young, is constructed in the University Park on the east bank of Taddle Creek. It was later (1880) named Moss Hall and was demolished in 1888 to make way for the Biological Building.\n\n1850 January 1\n\nJohn McCaul becomes the first president of the University of Toronto and a Board of Endowment is established. It lasts until 1874.\n\n1850 May 25\n\nFirst meeting of U of T Senate.\n\n1851\n\nAs a parrt of the reorganization, an expansion of the new University of Toronto, five new chairs are advertised for: history and English literature, modern languages, natural philosophy, natural history, geology and mineralogy, and civil engineering. The last was never filled.\n\n1851 May 7\n\nA Senate committee reports on the inadequate facilities for the University in its three buildings: the ﾑEast Wing' (old King's College residence), the Medical Building, and a house rented from George Ridout. The last was used by Convocation, the Senate, the Caput (the executive body of the University), and the Board of Endowment.\n\n1851 August 30\n\nAn Act to incorporate Trinity College; it opens on 15 January 1852. Degree granting rights are provided on 16 January 1853 with the issuing of a Royal Charter. The College buildings were constructed in what is now Trinity Bellwoods Park on Queen Street West.\n\n1852\n\nThe disruption to the University caused by the inadequate facilities and other challenges means that in 1852 and again in 1855 there was no commencement, as convocation was then called.\n\n1852\n\nThe Chair of Modern Languages is established and filled on 28 May 1853 by James Forneri, who had been a cavalry officer under Napoleon and who presented excellent textimonials from the father of the premier, Francis Hincks. When he retired from the chair at the end of the Michaelmas term in 1865, it was dissolved into three lectureships in French, German, and Italian and Spanish.\n\n1852 August\n\nThe Chair of History and English Literature is established and is filled the following year by Daniel Wilson, a Scottish antiquarian who had studied art under Turner and who was a staunch defender of non-denominational education.\n\n1852 August 3\n\nThe Chair of Natural History is established, to which Thomas Huxley applies. He receives testimonials from Charles Darwin and many other leaders of the scientific world but he does not get the position. It is filled by the Reverend William Hincks, who had the advantage of being a brother of the premier, Francis Hincks. This glaring example of political inference in university appointments was inevitable in an era when the provincial cabinet approved them. Though Hinck's ideas were even then out of date, he was liked by the students for he was affable and tolerated their practical jokes.\n\n1852 August 4\n\nThe Senate authorizes the construction of a gatehouse \"at the Eastern extremity of the Yonge Street Avenue\" (northwest corner of Yonge and College). The gates would probably have been in place since 1843. See the year 1879 for a photo.\n\n1852 September 15\n\nSt. Mary's Lesser Seminary (established 1852) opens. It was dissolved and absorbed on 14 February 1853 into St. Michael's College.\n\n1852 September 15\n\nSt. Michael's College (established 1852) opens. Incorporated 19 May 1855.\n\n1853 Spring\n\nJohn Bradford Cherriman succeeds Reverend Robert Murray, recently deceased, in the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy (physics). He was a Cambridge mathematician of some standing and was selected over John Tyndall, a man of much greater reputation. He resigned his position on 1 July 1875 to become the first Superintendent of Insurance for the federal government.\n\n1853 April 22\n\nAn Act amends the laws relating to the U of T by separating its administrative and teaching functions; the latter are assigned to the newly created University College. The title 'President of the University of Toronto' is replaced by 'President of University College'.\n\n1853 June\n\nThe Government expropriates for future Parliament Buildings the University's site in Queen's Park and the University is forced to relocate in August to the unused Parliament Buildings on Front Street.\n\n1853 October\n\nAlexander Thomas Augusta, the first black medical student in Canada West, enters the Faculty of Medicine at Trinity. An American from Norfolk, Virginia, he was refused a medical education in the US, so came to Canada. He remained at Trinity until 1855 (MB from Trinity, 1860). Before leaving for the West Indies about 1860, he was in charge of Toronto General Hospital. Later he was a surgeon in the American Civil War and still later taught at Howard University.\n\n1853 October\n\nEdward John Chapman arrives in Toronto to take up the chair of mineralogy and geology. He had previously held the chair of mineralogy in the University of London. He lasted longer than any of his contemporaries, retiring in 1895.\n\n1854\n\nThe Chair of Civil Engineering becomes the Department of Civil Engineering.\n\n1854\n\nTrinity College's medical faculty permits \"occasional students\" (non-Anglicans) to take courses, with the expectation that they would then write their examinations at U of T and graduate from there.\n\n1854\n\nToronto School of Medicine moves into the disused Medical Building. Victoria College invites the School to become its medical faculty, of which John Rolph becomes dean in 1855. The School moves to Lot Street (now Queen Street) in the summer of 1855.\n\n1854 January 1\n\nThe Faculties of Law and Medicine are abolished, under the terms of the 1853 Act, though the U of T continues to grant degrees in these disciplines.\n\n1854 February 22\n\nUniversity College Literary and Scientific Society, the first student society on campus, is established at the behest of Daniel Wilson, newly appointed professor of History and English Literature. Affectionately known as ﾑthe Lit', It is the longest continuously running student organization in English-speaking Canada.\n\n1855\n\nThe new stone building of Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory opens. A fence and a row of trees formed the boundary between it and University College.\n\n1855 October\n\nThe Canadian parliament returns to Toronto and the U of T is forced back into the old King's College residence which had been partially gutted by the Department of Works.\n\n1856 February 7\n\nThe Senate establishes a Building Committee, of which John Langton becomes the only active member though he informally consulted professors such as Daniel Wilson and Henry Holmes Croft, to oversea the construction of University College and appoints 34 year old Frederic Cumberland as University Architect.\n\n1856 May\n\nThe Senate complains to the Government about its decision to appropriate the old King's College Residence to establish a branch of the Lunatic Asylum, dubbed the ﾑUniversity Lunatic Asylum.' The University is also forced to pay for a new road (later known as Old King's College Road) to the site through what is now Queen's Park.\n\n1856 Summer\n\nThe U of T is forced to move to the old Medical Building, to which a temporary structure is added for \"the Senate and officers of the University, an examination hall, a laboratory, six lecture rooms\" and some other apartments.\n\n1856 Summer\n\nJohn Rolph's lecturers at the Victoria College Faculty of Medicine resign en masse and take the name 'Toronto School of Medicine' with them. Rolph sues to recover the name but the court decides against him. He moves his faculty into a building at 10 Little Jarvis Street (now Asquith Avenue).\n\n1856 July 2\n\nTrinity Medical Faculty folds when the entire faculty resigns over Trinity College's insistence on religious tests for students attending lectures.\n\n1856 October 4\n\nThe corner stone for the University College building is laid (Cumberland and Storm, architects). The first contract for its construction was signed four days later.\n\n1857\n\nThe Chair of Classics, Belles Lettres, Rhetoric and Logic becomes the Department of Classical Literature, Logic and Rhetoric.\n\n1857 March 30\n\nThe Building Committee, in the interests of economy, decides that a plain brick building will be erected at the rear of University College in place of the \"ornamental Chemical School now forming the South-west corner of the University buildings\". John Langton leaves Toronto for his home at Lindsay, Ontario. On his return at the beginning of July he discovers that \"the Architect had proceeded with the Chemical School and executed other potions of the work without their [the Building Committee's] authority\". Cumberland justified his action by claiming that the School as originally designed provided an anchor for the front elevation of University College (he also used it as his office during construction). An angry Langton, much to the chagrin of the architect, contractor, and sub-contractors, demanded numerous subsequent economies and ensured they were carried out to the letter. Construction of University College, early summer 1858, showing the Round Room (chemistry laboratory) completed. This photo, one of a set taken by photographers Armstrong, Beere & Hime, belonged to John Langton.\n\n1857 October\n\nDaniel Wilson begins teaching 'Ancient and modern ethnology', the first such course in ethnology in the British Empire.\n\n1857 October 1\n\nAt the Senate meeting on this day, Professor Daniel Wilson moved, seconded by Professor John Cherriman, that \"the following be adopted as the arms of the University of Toronto: Azure: Two open books, clasped : a beaver in base : on a chief argent, an imperial crown all properSupporters: Minerva and VictoryMotto: Velut arbor avoCrest: A maple tree Which motion was carried.\"\n\n1858\n\nEpiskipon, the secret student society at Trinity College, is founded. Over the years, it proves to be a periodic thorn in the side of the College authorities.\n\n1858 August 28\n\nAn Act formalizes the lease by the University to the City of Toronto a park of about 49 acres, to be called Queen's Park.\n\n1858 October 4\n\nThe Governor-General places the capping stone of University College on the summit of the turret of the tower, followed by a lavish banquet in the new Library in the east wing. The final cost was $355,907.\n\n1859 August\n\nA stone coffer dam is constructed across Taddle Creek, providing road access to University College from the east and creating McCaul's Pond.\n\n1859 October\n\nClasses recommence in the new University College building, and Professor Henry Holmes Croft begins using the first purpose built chemistry laboratory in Canada in the \"Round Room\", now the Croft Chapter House.\n\n1860\n\nIn 1857 Frederic Cumberland, University Architect, purchased land at the corner of St. George Street and College Avenue (198 feet on the Avenue and 598 feet on the east side of St. George) for $495 on which to build his residence, 'Pendarves'. Construction began in the July of 1857 and by the end of 1859 or early 1860 the Cumberlands had moved in. Subsequent sale of lots reduced the St. George St. frontage to 390 feet. Cumberland died in 1881 and in 1884 the property was sold to Alfred Morgan Cosby who renamed it 'Maplehearn'. His family lived there until about 1905 when the house was purchased by Walter D. Beardmore who lived in it until 1912, when he leased it to the Government of Ontario as a temporary residence for the Lieutenant-Governor until Chorley Park was ready in December, 1915. The house was then retrieved by Beardmore's widow (he died in 1913) and she resided there until 1919.\n\n1861\n\nThe Toronto School of Medicine begins teaching courses in the old Medical Building in the University Park. This arrangement continues into the 1870s.\n\n1862 May 5\n\n\"The University and College Rifle Company\" is gazetted as a direct consequence of the Trent Affair the previous November and December. It was incorporated in the Queen's Own Rifles on November 21 1862 and was designated No. 9 Company. When letters replaced numbers in March of 1872, it became K Company. Professor Henry Holmes Croft was the first captain of the Company, Professor Cherriman, the first lieutenant.\n\n1864\n\nIn the later years of the American Civil War, undergraduates from the Confederate States introduced the first Greek Letter Secret Society to the University of Toronto, Bond Sigma Phi. \"Its very existence was, so far as was possible, kept a profound secret known only to its members...No one could become a member through any application or effort of his own...[and] every living member had to be consulted...[before admission]\" though this eventually proved impractical. It flourished in the 1860s and 1870s and then faded from view. Members included A.B. Aylesworth, Arthur R. Dickey, Hugh John Macdonald (son of Sir John A.), Fred W. Haultain, and W.B. Northrup, all prominent and legal and political circles.\n\n1866\n\nSenate establishes Finance Committee which lasts until 1878.\n\n1866\n\nThe first gymnasium is constructed on the Back Campus. The shed at the end accommodates the gardener of University College's pig.\n\n1866 June 2\n\nThe Battle of Ridgeway. The Queen's Own Rifles, including students from 'K' Company (the 'University Company') and Trinity Company, engage the Fenians at Limeridge near Fort Erie. Three students, Privates Malcolm McKenzie, John Henry Mewburn and William Fairbanks Tempest are killed, and Rupert Etherege Kingsford, Ephriam George Patterson, Edgar Taylor Paul, and William Henry Vander Smissen (later professor of German and librarian) are wounded. David Junor and William Henry Ellis (dean of engineering, 1916-1920) are captured.\n\n1867\n\nThe Legislature adopts the policy, effective 1 July 1868 and continuing until 1964, of no longer making grants to denominationally controlled institutions. Victoria and Queen's had been receiving such grants since 1845; Trinity since 1855.\n\n1869\n\nThe University College Literary and Scientific Society publishes The Annual, the College's first student yearbook.\n\n1869 September 1\n\nThe University regains control of the former King's College Residence as the patients of the Lunatic Asylum are moved out.\n\n1870\n\nThe Volunteer Monument is erected on the western edge of Queen's Park, overlooking Taddle Creek, in memory of the Toronto men who fell in the Battle of Ridgeway (McKenzie is the only U of T student represented).\n\n1870\n\nThe first organized team sport at the University of Toronto was football. According to the Yearbook of the University of Toronto (1887), \"Originally, the only game played was known as the ﾑold University game'. In it, charging from behind, hacking and tripping were prominent features and although players were not allowed to carry the ball, they might bounce it along with the hand. No other club played the gameﾅVarious attempts were made to arrange a uniform set of rules until, finally, in 1876 the representatives of a number of different clubs met and adopted the entire Scottish Association rules.\"\n\n1871\n\nIn 1871 the Toronto School of Medicine had eight graduates.\n\n1871 March\n\nThe medical faculty is re-established at Trinity College; it includes five professors from the Medical Faculty at Victoria College. A building is constructed at 40 Spruce Street, and classes begin in October.\n\n1871 October 20\n\nUniversity College has its first documented Sports Day. There are no team events; rather individual feats of prowess are featured, ranging from ﾑthrowing the cricket ball ﾖ distance' to ﾑmile race'.\n\n1872\n\nJohn Edgeworth Thomson, University librarian (1868-1872) becomes unhinged and threatens to shoot the Minister of Education and Daniel Wilson.\n\n1872\n\nThe first 'Bob' at Victoria College, possibly the first recorded 'stunt night' in the history of the U of T.\n\n1873 March 29\n\nAn Act to establish the Ontario School of Practical Science replaces the College of Technology (opened May 1872). Though with its own board and funded by the province, it was, in effect, the Applied Science Department of University College until 1889.\n\n1873 March 29\n\nAn Act provides for alumni representation on the Senate and the chancellor is elected by the alumni rather than be appointed by the Government. The first chancellor elected under this system was Edward Blake, in 1875. He served until 1900.\n\n1874\n\nThe faculty and students at Victoria College Faculty of Medicine move over to the Toronto School of Medicine and the Faculty folds.\n\n1874 May\n\nCornerstone is laid for new Knox College building at 1 Spadina Circle.Designed by Smith and Gemmell, architects. In addition to being signed off by the architects, this plan bears signatures representing the following trades: mason, carpenter, stone cutter, plasterer, and painter.\n\n1874 May\n\nOntario Agricultural College opens in Guelph. It affiliates with the U of T in 1887 and the first BSA degrees are awarded in 1888. It becomes a founding college of the University of Guelph in 1964.\n\n1874 July 24\n\nHenry Woodward, a medical student, and his neighbour, Matthew Evans, a hotel keeper, apply for a Canadian patent for an electric light bulb, which was granted on 3 August. According to the Electrical World and Engineer in 1900, they had been working on the project since the early winter of 1873 when, experimenting with Woodward's Smee battery and induction coil, they noticed a light spark from the contact post. Unfortunately, they were unable to raise sufficient funds to develop a commercially viable light bulb and Thomas Edison purchased the patent from them in 1879 and refined the process. The rest, as they say, is history. Woodward is usually cited as \"a medical student in Toronto\" (he describes himself as a \"medical electrician\" in his Canadian patent application). As such, he would be registered at one of the Toronto medical schools of the day -- the Toronto School of Medicine affiliated with Victoria College or Trinity Medical School (the U of T then could examine in medicine but not teach courses), It does not appear that he attended the Toronto School of Medicine, for which there are records of attendees (though six names are missing from the 1873-1874 register). The records of students then in attendance at the Trinity Medical School appear not to have survived.\n\n1875\n\nThe Toronto School of Medicine, which had been renting the Old Medical Building and using University College facilities, purchases Victoria College's medical faculty building on Sackville Street.\n\n1875\n\nThe School of Dentistry is founded in Toronto by the Royal College of Dental Surgeons. It affiliated with the U of T on 25 May 1888 and the first DDS degrees were awarded in 1889.\n\n1877 January\n\nThe government of Ontario changes the terms of affiliation of medical schools with the U of T, the principal one being that no medical body that was part of another university could be affiliated with the U of T.\n\n1877 March 2\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine at Trinity College incorporates as the Trinity Medical School so that its students would remain eligible for U of T honours and prizes. The School is stated to be the largest medical school in the province.\n\n1877 May\n\nThe Protestant Episcopal Divinity School is established and opens 1 October 1877. It was incorporated as Wycliffe College in 1879, moved to the campus in 1881, affiliated with the University in 1885, federated in 1889, and constructed its first building on campus in 1891.\n\n1877 June\n\nThe U of T opens its matriculation examinations to women. They are allowed to receive scholarships at the U of T and theoretically to attend classes at University College, but the latter was not allowed.\n\n1877 June 27\n\nThe Senate approves the affiliation of Trinity Medical School and the Toronto School of Medicine.\n\n1878\n\nActa Victoriana, the student paper of Victoria College in Cobourg, appears. It is still being published.\n\n1878 May 6\n\nThe Senate's Finance Committee becomes the Board of Management.\n\n1878 June 24\n\nFirst meeting of the Board of Management. It is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor. This marks the beginning of a bicameral governing structure at the U of T which endures for almost a century. The Senate henceforth handles academic matters and the Board financial ones.\n\n1878 July 25\n\nThe Board of Management appoints D. B (David Brash) Dick as University Architect. He was the architect for the Biological building (1888-1892), the restoration of University College (1890-1892), the Library (1892), the third Gymnasium (1892, 1894) and the Chemistry building (1895).\n\n1878 October 1\n\nThe School of Practical Science building (\"The Little Red Schoolhouse\"), designed by Kivas Tully, opens and over the next few months chemistry, mineralogy and geology are moved from University College into it. A fence is erected between it and University College, through a hole miraculously appears to facilitate the movement back and forth of University College professors, who provided most of the instruction.The completion of this building enabled the School to expand beyond the teaching of civil engineering to include (28 June 1878) the departments of analytical and applied chemistry, and assaying and mining geology.\n\n1879\n\nThe University Gates at Yonge and College, 1879. The board at the entrance announces the following 'Prohibitions': Riding of driving immoderately, or on the green sward. / Carting over any of the roads or digging earth or land. / Climbing on or injuring the trees, shrubs, flowers or banks. / Depositing dirt (or those cleaning carpets)? / Allowing cattle or swine to run at large herein. / Playing football or any other game without permission. / Discharging firearms, setting fireworks or letting off the same. / Selling refreshments without permission (or erecting any table) ? whereon any game of hazard or chance can be played / Walking upon the grass when prohibited to do so, or injuring any...or other City Property. - P.G. Close, Chairman of Parks and Gardens Committee (City of Toronto)\n\n1879\n\nThe University College Literary and Scientific Society ('the Lit.') moves into the old Medical Building, dubbed \"Hades\" by an undergraduate. The name stuck until the building was officially named Moss Hall the following year in honour of the recently deceased and popular Vice-chancellor, Thomas Moss. It also houses the University's second gymnasium.\n\n1879 Summer\n\nMcCaul's Pond is drained because of the stench caused by pollution from tanneries and other businesses upstream in Yorkville. A \"rustic bridge\" across Taddle Creek apparently replaces the coffer dam.\n\n1879 July\n\nJohn McCaul announces his retirement as President of University College and chair of Classics. He lectured through the winter of 1880 as no replacement had been appointed. In his later years he was much afflicted with gout and did not attend any Senate meetings after June 1876. In 1879 Daniel Wilson wrote in his journal that 'the President is now in that stage of touchy irritable senility which makes him an obstruction in every way'.\n\n1879 October 7\n\nFirst issue of the White and Blue, the first undergraduate newspaper on campus, appears. It is published by the Lit. The last issue appeared on 20 March 1880.\n\n1879 October 27\n\nThe founding of the University College Glee Club is the harbinger of amateur dramatics by students at the U of T.\n\n1880\n\nThe name of the Department of Classical Literature, Logic, and Rhetoric is changed to the Department of Classical Literature.\n\n1880 January\n\nThe first issue of Rouge et Noir, Trinity College's first student paper, appears.\n\n1880 May 26\n\nThe Senate reports that the Chair of Chemistry and Experimental Philosophy is henceforth to be known as the Department of Chemistry.\n\n1880 July 29\n\nDaniel Wilson succeeds John McCaul as President of University College. On holiday in England contemplating retirement, he is instructed to hire a new professor of classics (Maurice Hutton) and a new dean of residence.\n\n1880 October 8\n\nThe first issue of The Varsity, published by the Varsity Stock Company, appears. This arrangement lasts until 1889 when the Company collapses and The Varsity is taken over by the Lit.\n\n1881\n\nKnox College is authorized to grant degrees in divinity.\n\n1881 March 4\n\nSt. Michael's College affiliates with the University of Toronto, and is entitled to offer some instruction in history and philosophy. Federation does not take place for another 20 years.\n\n1882\n\nThe Ontario College of Pharmacy's School of Pharmacy is established. It affiliates with the U of T in 1892.\n\n1882 April 11-12\n\nThe University College Glee Club presents the play 'Antigone' in Convocation Hall in the original Greek. The person behind this production was Maurice Hutton, newly appointed professor of Classics. Daniel Wilson wrote in his diary \"The enthusiasm of Hutton has been heedless of expense. My own share of outlay runs up to $60. But his may be hundreds\".\n\n1883\n\nThe Woman's Medical College is established. The name is changed to the Ontario Medical College for Women in 1890 when it affiliated with the U of T. It closed in 1906 when women were finally admitted to the U of T's Faculty of Medicine.\n\n1883 Summer\n\nFor sanitary reasons, Taddle Creek is put underground in a sewer.\n\n1884\n\nThe Chair of History and Ethnology is established with the separation out of the teaching of English Literature. It is cited as the Department of Modern History from 14 November 1891.\n\n1884\n\nThe lectureship in Rhetoric and English Literature is established, with David Reid Keys as lecturer. Daniel Wilson had hoped for an appointment in history so that he could continue teaching English literatre but he was stymied by the Vice-chancellor, William Mulock.\n\n1884 February 1\n\nThe Department of Civil Engineering in the Faculty of Arts is dissolved.\n\n1884 October 4\n\nA provincial order-in-council instructs President Wilson to prepare for the admission of women to University College. Classes are delayed a week to allow preparations for separate facilities for the women and for the appointment of a Lady Superintendent.\n\n1884 October 30\n\nFirst meeting of the Board of Trustees, which replaces the Board of Management.\n\n1885\n\nThe Varsity Publishing Company produces Varsity Book: Prose and Poetry, a compendium of poems and short stories written by students and former students.\n\n1885 March 3\n\nFirst meeting of the School of Practical Science Engineering Society.\n\n1885 June 10\n\nThe University College graduating class in Arts for 1885 was the first to include women; there were five graduands. Catharine E. Brown and Margaret N. Brown, daughters of the late proprietor of the Globe, George Brown, were tutored privately and never attended classes on campus. The images below are of the three women who took their courses at University College.\n\n1885 October\n\nThe YMCA building opens. It was designed by the architectural firm Gordon and Helliwell for a nominal fee, and built with funds raised by the members and friends of the University College YMCA. Prominent in the endeavour were Knox College students Angus Jones Mcleod, the moving force behind this project (he was particularly proud of the granite pillar at the entrance). and Charles William Gordon, better known later as the prolific author Ralph Connor.\n\n1885 December 22\n\nKnox College affiliates with the U of T; federation follows on 11 April 1889.\n\n1886\n\nThe Chair of Natural History is renamed the Department of Biology.\n\n1886 Summer\n\nOld King's College residence is demolished to make way for the new Legislative Buildings.\n\n1886 November 20\n\nThe Toronto Conservatory of Music, founded by Edward Fisher, is incorporated.\n\n1887\n\nThe first (and only) volume of the Year Book of the University of Toronto appears. Edited by undergraduates J. G. Miller and F. B. Hodgins and published under the authority of the Senate, it was designed to \"assist in keeping the work and needs of the University of Toronto before its graduates and friends\".\n\n1887\n\nUniversity College Young Women's Christian Association is established through the efforts of Sybil Wilson, daughter of President Wilson and \"a woman of strong personal characteristics and broad sympathies\".\n\n1887\n\nThe Chair of Mathematics and Physics is split to form the Chair of Mathematics and the Chair of Physics. Cited as the Department of Mathematics from May 1892; cited as the Department of Physics from October 1892.\n\n1887 January 22\n\nThe Varsity announces that the University College Glee Club has struck a committee of graduates and undergraduates to produce the University’s first song book. It advertised for submissions and over 3,000 were received. The book was published on December 9th: “The binding is unique, --a design by Howard, of this city, in peacock green and gold, than which nothing more attractive or in better taste could be imagined.” The University of Toronto Song Book sold extremely well. The 1887 edition went through several printings with different publishers, and new editions appeared in 1891, 1899, and 1918. It contained popular songs of the day along with some new ones, divided into categories. Students, graduates and faculty all contributed. The entries under “College Songs and Choruses”, in particular, displayed the talent at the U of T. Amongst the songs written by students were John David Spence’s ‘The freshman’s fate; or the perils of co-education’ (then a very lively and divisive topic), his ode (‘Our Irish bedel’) to the University bedel, Robert McKim, and John Jeremiah Ferguson’s ‘The marching song’. Of the many graduates who contributed, Frederick Elias Seymour (BA 1864) wrote ‘Sail, sail, my bark canoe’ while John Campbell (BA 1865) countered with the ‘Regimental song of the Queen’s Own Rifles’ and ‘The College Gown’. Students, graduates, and faculty provided adaptations such as ‘Honour old ‘Varsity’, collaborated to write songs and compose music for them, and to translate songs originally written in French, German, and Latin. President Wilson contributed three songs, ‘Alma mater’, ‘The undergraduate’s lament’ and ‘Commencement’, and Professor William Henry Ellis wrote the ‘Camping song’. One of the more singular titles chosen was ‘H2S 04’.\n\n1887 April 23\n\nAn Act respecting the Federation of the University of Toronto and University College with other Universities and Colleges [University Federation Act]. A University Council is created to oversee the work of the faculty and to supervise student societies and associations. Provision is made for the re-establishment of the faculties of medicine and law.\n\n1887 August 22\n\nThe Chairs of Clinical Medicine and Medical Pathology; of Sanitary Science; of Opthalmology, Otology, Laryngology and Rhinology; and the Departments of Anatomy, Gynaecology, Medical Psychology, Pharmacology and Theraputics, are established in the reconstituted Faculty of Medicine which absorbs the Toronto School of Medicine.\n\n1887 October 6\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine officially opens for business.\n\n1888\n\nThe Toronto College of Music is founded by conductor Frederick Herbert Torrington. It affiliated with the U of T on 12 June 1890 and disaffiliated on 11 April 1918, when it was absorbed by the Canadian Academy of Music, though the name 'Toronto College of Music' remained in use until 1923.\n\n1888 March 23\n\nRoyal assent for an act changing the name of Trinity Medical School to Trinity Medical College. Trinity Medical School had opposed the re-opening of the Faculty of Medicine at the U of T and was given an injection of money from Trinity College to enable it to upgrade its facilities. The change of the name was part of the process in the School's attempt to compete against the U of T.\n\n1888 spring\n\nMoss Hall is demolished to make way for the Biological Building; construction of the latter begins immediately. The east wing, for use of the Biological Department and museum, is completed the following year. The west wing, primarily for the Anatomical Department of the Faculty of Medicine, is completed in 1892 after being the subject of a major controversy that came within one vote of resulting in the resignation of Vice Chancellor William Mulock.\n\n1888 October 16\n\nWilliam James Ashley is appointed professor of the newly established Chair of Political Economy and Constitutional History. The Government carefully vetted the applicants; it wanted someone who was disengaged from party politics and who would not question its policies, especially its opposition to free trade. It therefore chose a foreigner, and Ashley, a proponent of the newly emerging school of inductive and empirical economists, fit the bill.\n\n1889\n\nVictoria University agrees to federate with the U of T; the University Federation Act with respect to Victoria University is proclaimed on 12 October 1890.\n\n1889 January\n\nThe lectureship in Rhetoric and English Literature is superseded by the Chair of English Language and Literature; the position was filled on 17 April 1889 by William John Alexander, whose appointment was apposed by the \"nativists\" because he was not a graduate of the U of T (though had taken courses at University College).

Touchdown, five points; convert, one point. The nearer the touchdown was to the touchline, the greater the distance from the goal-line to the kicking point - to get the angle. This was a 35-yard kick.\"\n\n1910 December 8\n\nSt. Michael's College federates with the U of T. The students produce their first Year Book the following spring.\n\n1911\n\nIvy G.

It was completed in 1911 in time for Varsity's defeat of the Argonauts by a score of 14-7 for its third Grey Cup, under the leadership of Hugh Gall and Jack Maynard, captains 1910 and 1911 respectively.Gall has been described as Canada'a greatest half back of the period and Maynard as one of its greatest backs.\n\n1912\n\nCanadian Academy of Music is established when the Columbian Conservatory of Music, established in 1911, changes its name. It was absorbed in 1924 by the Toronto Conservatory of Music.\n\n1912\n\nThe medical students, who had started a skit night, called Daffydil Night, in 1895 as a Punch and Judy show to caricature their professors, rent Convocation Hall; for the first time the event includes an elaborate program called Epistaxis that became ever more risqué as time passed. Daffydil Night became the model for other faculties and colleges.\n\n1912 April 16\n\nAn Act to establish a provincial museum, the Royal Ontario Museum, is passed. The force behind its conception and realization was Sir Byron Edmund Walker, Chairman of the Board of Governors, 1910-1923, and Chancellor of the U of T, 1923-1924.\n\n1912 July 1\n\nThe Department of Metallurgical Engineering is established.\n\n1913\n\nThe Household Science (Lillian Massey Treble building) opens; it provides a gymnasium and a swimming pool for all women students.

The formation of a Men's Dramatic Club in December 1907 was not successful -- it soon collapsed. The formation of the Players Club of the University of Toronto in the spring of 1913 was more propitious. Its first production, 'An Enemy of the People' by Henrik Ibsen, was presented on 12 December and provided further evidence of the move towards modern works. The Club early felt the impact of World War I but managed one more season under the direction of A.R.M. Lower before ceasing operations as men enlisted. The 1914-1915 season was an imaginative one in which two plays, seen in the city for the first time, were presented: Galsworthy's 'The Pigeon' and Shaw's 'The Dark Lady of the Sonnets'. The Players Club then suspended its activities for the duration of the First World War.\n\n1914\n\nThe Medical Research Fund is established as the first systematic attempt to support research at the University.\n\n1914 March 19\n\nRoyal Ontario Museum opens. It was part of the U of T until 1959, one result of which was that no University Museum was ever created.\n\n1914 April 29\n\nThe Senate approves Statute 730 creating a curriculum in social service, effectively the Department of Social Service.\n\n1914 May 1\n\nThe annual grant from death duties to the U of T is limited to $500,000 by a Provincial Act. This continued to be the case until 1964, though each year the Government made a supplementary grant.\n\n1914 May 1\n\nThe Antitoxin Laboratory is established at the insistence of Dr. John Gerald FitzGerald, with financial support from Sir Edmund Osler, Sir Edmund Walker and, especially, Colonel Albert E.

The Director is Dr. James Gerald Fitzgerald.\n\n1914 June\n\nThe Department of Social Service is established.\n\n1914 August 4\n\nThe outbreak of World War I. By this point the walls of Hart House were up and the roof on, but now construction slows to a crawl. The building is turned over to the war effort. The Great Hall became a drill hall for a time and the future theatre,as Ian Monatagnes described it, \"housed a macabre puppet show. At one end a ruined Belgian village rose in minature: from behind its wrecked buildings and its shattered windows, marionettes in German field grey popped suddenly in to view - life-like targets for student riflemen posted at the far end of the room in a sand-bagged imitation trench.\"\n\n1915-1919\n\nFrom 1915 to 1919 the Students' Administrative Council, assisted by faculty and other interested people, issued an annual Magazine Supplementcontaining illustrated articles on the University and the war effort.\n\n1915 March 26\n\nThe Canadian General Hospital No. 4 (University of Toronto) is established.\n\n1915 April\n\nImmediately following the establishment of Canadian General Hospital No. 4, two committees were formed to provide the equipment needed over and above government issue. One, representing the Board of Governors, the Senate, and the faculty and staff, \"arranged for the purchase of medical, surgical, and laboratory apparatus...The second committee, [which soon evolved into the University Women's Hospital Supply Association], which was composed of ladies connected with the University, proceeded to prepare the hospital clothing, bed linen, surgical dressings, and all similar articles...In the first year, 3340 cases containing 124,000 articles, were sent overseas.\"\n\n1915 October 14\n\nBoard of Post Graduate Studies replaces Committee of Post Graduate Studies; it in turn is replaced by School of Graduate Studies in 1922.\n\n1915 November 2\n\nThe U of T contingent of Canadian Officers Training Corps is authorized.\n\n1916\n\nThe Schonnenburg house (also known as the Schoenberger House) at 184 College Street is purchased for use by the COTC, with the Alumni Association occupying four rooms on the second floor.\n\n1916\n\nThe house at 79 St. George Street, erected in 1885, is acquired for the University College Women's Union. Renovations begin in May for occupancy by the beginning of October. In 1922-1923 a major addition by Darling and Pearson is added on the east side.\n\n1916-1919\n\nDuring the War and once the roof was on, certain \"afterthoughts\" were added to Hart House. These, noted by Vincent Massey in a letter to the Warden, Burgeon Bickersteth, included \"the theatre and its adjoining equipment, the Faculty Union (now the Gallery Grill), the chapel and the sketch-room (later the art gallery).\" The most ambitious, and almost accidental, of these was Hart House Theatre. Vincent Massey and his wife, Alice (married 1915), \"looking about the building one day, were seized with the idea that the great vaulted space underneath the quadrangle might be used as a theatre\". This occasioned further excavation, the cutting two additional entrances in the front of the building, designing a concrete arched roof to span the 50-foot width of the auditorium, and adding the necessary fitting and other rooms.\n\n1916-1917 Winter\n\nSome of the issues for returning disabled soldiers are addressed by Dr. E.A. Bott of physiology, who opens a small clinic for their 'functional re-education'. In May 1917 this work is re-organized and expanded by the Military Hospitals Commission and moved into Hart House. In 1918, the Canadian Amry Medical Corps assumes responsibility and created a School of Physiotherapy in Hart House. Massage therapy was carried out in the swimming pool. From 1917 onwards members of the faculty, especially from Applied Science and headed by Professor H.E.T. Haultain, run a programme for refitting disabled soldiers for civilian life. Classes for industrial instruction are carried out in the temporary gynasium (constructed for use while Hart House was being built) and courses in 'occupational therpay' for the more seriously injured soldiers. For soldiers whose faces had been disfigured, sculptor Frederick Coates used his modelling ability to make plaster models of faces so surgeons could reconstruct them. \"The doctors know how to graft flesh and bones; Coates knew what a remodeled face should look like.\"\n\n1916 February 8\n\nThe Faculty of Education Dramatic Club presents 'The Cricket on the Hearth' by Dickens and 'She Stoops to Conquer'.\n\n1916 April 27\n\nWycliffe College is authorized to grant degrees in divinity.\n\n1916 October 12\n\nThe first meeting of the the Women's Student Council of the University of Toronto, the first such university-wide body, representing University College, Victoria, St. Hilda's, St. Miike's and Medicine. The first president is Elizabeth Grant from University College.\n\n1917\n\nThe Imperial Royal Flying Corps (its official title) establishes a training centre for Canada with headquarters in Toronto. The cadets received their preliminary training on campus before being sent to flying camps at Leaside, Borden and Desoronto; the first cadets headed to Borden at the end of April. During the summer of 1917 a large number of Americans from Fort Riley in Kansas also arrived for training, and the RFC took over the front and back lawns, parts of the Engineering Building, Convocation Hall and Hart House; Wycliffe College, most of Burwash Hall, and Devonshire Hall. A number of airplanes (or parts thereof) were set up around the campus for instructional purposes, and in the gymnasiums of Hart House the RFC cadets \"mastered the principles of engine and aircraft construction by stripping down an old Curtis Jenny and re-assembling it again\". In 1918 the Back Campus and the quadrangle of Burwash Hall were filled with tents.\n\n1917\n\nThe Board of Governors budgets $15,000 for research; this leads to establishment of School of Engineering Research in Faculty of Applied Science in May.\n\n1917 January 15\n\nA lengthy column in The Varsity describes the founding meeting of the University of Toronto Sketch Club, attended by about 30 men. Amongst those addressing the students were the architect John M. Lyle and the artist and illustrator C. W. Jeffries.\n\n1917 October 25\n\nThe Connaught Laboratories are formally opened by Governor General the Duke of Connaught on a farm of 58 acres purchased by Colonel Gooderham at what became Downsview and was named the University Farm. It merged with the Antitoxin Laboratory to form the Connaught Anti-Toxin Laboratories on 8 May 1919. Renamed Connaught Laboratories in 1923, the name was changed again in 1946 to the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories. Sold to the Canadian Development Corporation, 29 Sept. 1972.\n\n1917 October 29\n\nThe Victoria College Women's Dramatic Club is formed. Its policy was a radical departure from the past for it expressed immediate interest in the burgeoning \"Little Theatre\" movement and presented, in the place of one long play, \"three charming short plays which are being produced by so many popular playwrights\". They were 'Overtones', a study of modern woman; 'Gods of the Mountains', a piece about idols; and a satire, 'Helena's Husband\". These plays were so successful that the following year Shakespeare comprised only a fourth of the program, sharing the season with scenes from the great novels, \"Little Theatre\" plays, and Mrs. Gaskell's 'The Ladies of Cranford'.\n\n1917 December 14\n\nThe Ontario College of Art affiliates with the University of Toronto and a Chair of the History of Industrial Art is established in the Faculty of Arts.\n\n1918\n\nThe Canadian Academy of Music absorbs the Toronto College of Music.\n\n1918 April 5\n\nThe Faculty of Music is established, with instruction beginning in 1919-1920. A provincial Act confirms an agreement between the Toronto Conservatory of Music and the Governors of the U of T whereby the university assumes financial responsibility and control of the Conservatory and its programs.\n\n1918 Summer\n\nUniversity College and the Faculty of Medicine acquire the house at 100 Queen's Park, for use as a women's residence known as Argyll House, \"so called in honour of the clan to which its recent owners\", the family of A. H. Campbell, belonged. Described as a residence \"imposing enough to be designated by a title, other than a mere numerical one\", it provided accommodation for 31 residents, medical students and Arts graduates and undergraduates. Because of the extensive renovations required, it was not ready for occupation at the beginning of term and the students were housed elsewhere in the interim. In the fall of 1930 it was demolished to make way for the east wing of the Royal Ontario Museum.\n\n1918 July 1\n\nThe Department of History of Industrial Art is established. The name was changed to the Department of History of Industrial Art and Archaeology on 1 July 1929 and to the Department of Archaeology on 23 February 1933.\n\n1919 June\n\nThe Canadian General Hospital No. 4 (University of Toronto is dissolved (demobilized). Its members are welcomed back in Toronto at a ceremony in Convocation Hall in July.\n\n1919\n\n71 St. George St. is purchased for use by the Department of Psychology.\n\n1919\n\n92-94 St. George Street is purchased for use as a residence for University College women students, capacity 38. It is given the name Hutton House in honour of Principal Maurice Hutton.\n\n1919 February\n\nThe University Veterans' Association of Toronto is formed. It is \"limited to those who had seen voluntary service in the actual theatre of war…As early as 1916 student-soldiers who had been wounded or otherwise rendered unfit for service overseas began to dribble back to the University….In January, 1918…about 300 veterans had returned to the University.\" It had a room on the second floor of the Schonnenburg house at 184 College Street.\n\n1919 April\n\nIn preparation for the opening of Hart House, the Hart House Committee, chaired by the recently appointed warden, Walter Bowles, meets for the first time and creates the first – library and finance – committees charged with running Hart House. J.E.H. MacDonald, one of the original members of the Group of Seven, is commissioned to design a bookplate for the library.\n\n1919 August 26\n\nOfficial visit of H.R.H. the Prince of Wales.\n\n1919 October\n\nThe Players Club is reorganized as an association of highly gifted amateurs with little room for any but the most experienced students, of whom Harold Scudamore, a returned soldier at Trinity College, was one. It ran Hart House Theatre for its first two years, becoming in 1921 an auxiliary body to it, providing \"a social organization for the men who are working in the theatre with drama as a common interest\". The members often showed great promise, presenting one-act plays that formed part of the fare of the Theatre in the 1920s. \"The presence of a professional theatre on campus occasioned an explosion of interest in dramatics. So many new clubs were formed by the mid-1920s that almost every interest group on campus was putting on at least one play a year. The older clubs were forced to define their areas of dramatic interest and to seek new means of support. Single-sex organizations outside the Catholic colleges tended to disappear and the barriers amongst the colleges continued to erode.\"\n\n1919 October 10\n\nThe Senate approves the curriculum for a Diploma in Public Health.\n\n1919 November 11\n\nHart House, built by the Massey family \"at a cost approaching two millions,\" officially opens; the ceremony begins at 11:00 sharp. Hart House Theatre, which is run separately, also opens. Designed as a \"Little Theatre,\" it is described as \"quite the best thing of the kind anywhere.\" Vincent Massey also provide $125,000 towards an athletic centre for women; this dream is not relized for another forty years.\n\n1919 November 13\n\nThe Department of Analytical and Applied Chemistry becomes the Department of Chemical Engineering on 13 November 1919. On 22 September 1921 the name was changed to the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry.\n\n1919 November 19\n\nA reunion of the University Battery, Canadian Expeditionary Forces, is held in Burwash Hall and the 67th (Varsity) Battery Association is formed.\n\n1919 November 28\n\nReturning war veterans brought new experiences and ideas to theatre on campus; these were first demonstrated in two war sketches presented at Trinity College, both written by students and the earliest known examples. \"'As We Are' by Ada Garrow and performed by the women of St. Hilda's was a war-time fantasy in one act. 'The Mudwallopers of Na Poo Corners' by Robert Hays, was a clever and highly amusing look at life in the trenches. It was presented by the men of Trinity who, under the leadership of Harold Scudamore….form[ed] the Trinity College Dramatic Society two months later.\"\n\n1919 Christmas\n\nThe Players Club presents 'The Chester Mysteries', with music by Healey Willan.\n\n1920-1921\n\nFrom autumn of 1915 the activities of the University College Literary and Scientific Society and many other student organizations were suspended. At war's end, due to \"the break in tradition, together with the changed interests of many of the students\", a re-organization of the Lit was necessary. \"A slow and difficult task\" it was carried out through a series of weekly meetings that resulted in a name change to the University College Literary and Athletic Society and a move away from a debating society to \"the blending of the two forces of College life, an adoption of a compulsory fee, and change in the nature of many of the executive officers.\" The membership was not expanded to include women students.\n\n1920\n\nThe dental students were the first faculty to take up the theatrical challenge posed by the medical students, forming the Dramatic Committee of the Royal Dental Society in the autumn of 1920 specifically to put on \"Dentactics Night\". This, the Society's dramatic night, was the spring counterpart to \"Noctem Cuckoo\", its annual stunt night held in first term. The students experimented frequently with the structure of the event, one year producing three one-act plays, so as to involve more students, and following it with a three act comedy the next. The quality of their productions gradually improved so that in 1938 a one-act play, 'Heaven on Earth', was entered in the University Drama Festival.\n\n1920 May 15\n\nThe Toronto Telegram reports that \"within a few days it is expected that Prof. Mavor's house will be ready for the 'scrapping' process\" to make way for the new home of the University of Toronto Press. The new building went up quickly; it was ready for occupancy by the end of September. The building the Press had previously occupied was the last out building left over from the Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory some eighty years previously. A third storey was added to the new building in 1926.\n\n1920 May 24\n\nHarold Scudamore and three others produce \"The P.B.I. or Mademoiselle of Bully Grenay' at the Princess Theatre, following two sold out performances in Hart House Theatre. It then went on tour through southern Ontario. 'P.B.I' stood for \"poor bloody infantry\", originally an expression of compassion arising from the horrors of trench warfare.\n\n1920 June 2\n\nThe Senate approves the curriculum for a course in Public Health Nursing.\n\n1920 June 30\n\nThe Faculty of Education is dissolved and replaced by the Ontario College of Education, entirely funded by the provincial Department of Education.\n\n1920 July 1\n\nThe Department of University Extension and Publicity is created. Divided in 1947 into the Department of Publicity and the Department of University Extension.\n\n1920 July 1\n\nA diploma course in Public Health Nursing is established on a trial basis, with the support of the Canadian Red Cross.\n\n1920 October 20\n\nThe Royal Commission on University Finances, chaired by Henry John Cody, is created to inquire into the financial structure and requirements of the University of Toronto, Queen's University and Western University. Its report, tabled on 10 February 1921, recommended increased government support for the universities.\n\n1920 November 2\n\nUniversity of Toronto Women's Athletic Association replaces the Toronto University Athletic League\n\n1920 December 4\n\nThose poor Argos! Varsity again defeats them to win the Grey Cup. This time the score was 16 to 3. George Westman and Frank Sullivan also played on the Senior Hockey Team and were the first and perhaps only U of T students ever to play on national championship teams in different sports in the same year.\n\n1921\n\nThe Women's Dramatic Club folds. It is replaced in 1922 by the University College Player's Guild which included both men and women and rapidly became the leading dramatic organization on campus. Its productions were for members only and it had its own facilities, the new Women's Union, in which to produce plays.\n\n1921\n\nThe Electrical (later named the Rosebrugh) Building is completed. It has been under construction since 1919. The architects were Darling and Pearson.\n\n1921\n\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science holds its first meeting in Toronto since 1889.\n\n1921\n\nThe Department of Civil Engineering becomes the Department of Applied Mechanics and Civil Engineering.\n\n1921\n\nThe Department of Hygiene is renamed the Department of Hygiene and Preventive Medicine. In 1924-1925 it was re-organized as a Faculty of Medicine department housed in the School of Hygiene.\n\n1921 February\n\nIn the autumn of 1920 two students, Keith Crombie and Joseph Easton McDougall, expressed interest in starting a literary magazine; they were joined by James Cowan and Clarke Ashworth who wanted to start a humour magazine, an idea popular in North American universities at the time. They soon attracted more followers with the result that \"Toronto's college comic, the generic term for such products at the time,..started with thirty-five editors, no business staff, and about the same amount of working capital.\" The first issue of The Goblin appeared in February 1921. Priced at 20¢, \"It was an immediate success. It had a first run of 2,000 copies followed by a reprint of 1,000 both of which sold out in a day….By November, 1921, sales had reached 8,500, 2,500 more than the undergraduate body at the time.\" Its cover, layout, artwork, and advertising set it apart and provided a professional look that made the whole package attractive.\n\n1921 March\n\nNot ones to be left out, engineers organize an evening of skits called \"SpAsMs Nite\", which became the \"Revue\" section of their annual variety night, \"School Nite\", once they were given access to Hart House in 1923. By the mid-1930s they were claiming it to be more popular than any other stunt night on campus but, unlike the medical and dental students, they made no attempt at serious drama.\n\n1921 March 21\n\nThe Senior Intercollegiate Hockey team defeats Brandon in Winnipeg to win the Allan Cup, the Dominion intercollegiate hockey championship.\n\n1921 April 1\n\nThe honorary degree of Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.) is established by Senate statute 843. The first two recipients of this honour, on 9 June 1921, are Wilfred Pirt Mustard, an 1886 graduate of the University College, a distinguished classical scholar and professor of Latin at Johns Hopkins University, and Duncan Campbell Scott, the Canadian poet.\n\n1921 May 12\n\nThe Department of Chemical Pathology is renamed the Department of Pathological Chemistry.\n\n1921 September 21\n\nThe Department of Chemical Engineering is renamed the Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry.\n\n1922 January 13\n\nThe degrees of Bachelor of Architecture and Master of Architecture are established by Senate statute 856.\n\n1922 February 10\n\nThe degree of Master of Surgery (Ch.M.) in the Faculty of Medicine is established by Senate statute 857.\n\n1922 February 10\n\nThe degree of Master of Surgery (Ch.M.) in the Faculty of Medicine is established by Senate statute 857.\n\n1922 April 27\n\nThe Board of Governors approves the establishment of the School of Graduate Studies which had been created by Senate statute 863 on 28 March 1922. James Playfair McMurrich its first dean. He resigned in 1930.\n\n1922 July 1\n\nThe Department of History and Ethnology is split into the Department of History and the Department of Ethnology.\n\n1922 July 13\n\nThe term \"Department of Law\" emerges once again.

A lengthy period of fundraising followed, and on 20 November 1922 the contracts were signed. Construction began three days later when \"two workmen with picks and shovels appeared on the ground and commenced to dig.\" The architects were Sproatt and Rolph, the architects of Hart House.\n\n1922 December 12\n\nAt 4:00 pm on this day the first sod of the new Trinity College building is formally turned by the Bishop of Toronto.\n\n1923 January\n\nProfessor J. P. McMurrich, chair of the Department of Anatomy, reports that the Department's new building is \"now practically completed and the Department, hitherto inadequately housed in the west wing of the Biological Building, will begin the work of the second semester in its new quarters.\" The architect was the firm of Darling and Pearson. The insurance file described the building as \"Stone faced – grey stock brick exterior, fireproof construction – no plastering. Mastic floors.\"\n\n1923 January 24\n\nA cyrogenics laboratory opens, shortly after Professor J. C. McLennan and his team succeed in producing liquid helium in quantity, the first such success outside of a laboratory in Leiden, Holland.\n\n1923 May\n\nThe Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research is established. The name was changed on 22 May 1930 to the Banting and Best Department of Medical Research.\n\n1923 July 1\n\nThe Department of Drawing becomes the Department of Engineering Drawing.\n\n1923 Fall\n\nWhen the YMCA vacated its building on the completion of Hart House, it was taken over by the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering for use by its Department of Architecture until the fall of 1923 when the Board of Governors made it available to the Insulin Department of the Connaught Laboratories and it was dubbed the 'Insulin Building'. Charles H. Best was put in charge of the laboratory and \"all the insulin used in Canada is produced, besides large quantities which are exported to Ireland, New Zealand, India and South Africa….The ground floor of the building is devoted to the manufacture of insulin. Here the beef pancreas is received and ground up. It is dissolved in alcohol and this is filtered and is treated with chemicals and is ready for use. The upper floor…is used as a laboratory.\" In December of 1926, having outlived its usefulness, the building was torn down.\n\n1923 October 25\n\nFrederick Grant Banting and John James Rickard MacLeod are awarded the Nobel Prize for the discovery of insulin.\n\n1924 October 25\n\nThe Toronto Telegram annouces that the \"nameless thoroughfare which lies immediately to the north of the Parliament Buildings\" is to be called 'Old King's College Road'.\n\n1924 February\n\nSimcoe Hall, designed by Darling and Pearson and erected at a cost of $378,082, opens.
