SINK THOU MY FOUNDATIONS\n\nDEEP INTO THY BOSOM UNTIL THEY REST UPON THE VAST\n\nROCK OF THY COUNSEL. LIFT THOU MY WALLS INTO THE\n\nCLEAR EMPYREAN OF THY TRUTH. COVER ME WITH THE\n\nM'INGS THAT SHADOW FROM ALL HARM. LAY MY THRESH-\n\nOLDS IN HONOR AND MY LINTELS IN LOVE. SET THOU MY\n\nFLOORS IN THE CEMENT OF UNBREAKABLE FRIENDSHIP AND\n\nMAY MY WINDOWS BE TRANSPARENT WITH HONESTY. LEAD\n\nTHOU UNTO ME, LORD GOD, THOSE WHOM THOU HAST AP-\n\nPOINTED TO BE MY CHILDREN, AND WHEN THEY SHALL\n\nCOME WHO WOULD LEARN OF ME THE WISDOM OF THE\n\nYEARS, LET THE CRIMSON OF MY WINDOWS GLOW WITH\n\nTHE LIGHT OF THE WORLD. LET THEM SEE, MY LORD,\n\nHIM WHOM THOU HAST SHOWN ME; LET THEM HEAR HIM\n\nWHOSE VOICE HAS WHISPERED TO ME AND LET THEM REACH\n\nOUT THEIR HANDS AND TOUCH HIM WHO HAS GENTLY LED\n\nME UNTO THIS GOOD DAY. ROCK-RIBBED MAY I STAND FOR\n\nTHY TRUTH. LET THE STORMS OF EVIL BEAT ABOUT ME\n\nIN VAIN. MAY I SAFELY SHELTER THOSE WHO COME UNTO\n\nME FROM THE WINDS OF ERROR. LET THE LIGHTNING THAT\n\nLIES IN THE CLOUD OF IGNORANCE BREAK UPON MY HEAD\n\nIN DESPAIR. MAY THE YOUNG AND THE PURE AND THE\n\nCLEAN-HEARTED PUT THEIR TRUST SECURELY IN ME NOR\n\nMAY ANY WHO COMB TO MY HALLS FOR GUIDANCE BE\n\nSENT ASTRAY. LET THE BLUE ASHLARS OF MY BREAST\n\nTHRILL TO THE HAPPY SONGS OF THE TRUE-HEARTED AND\n\nMAY THE VERY HEART OF MY CAMPUS SHOUT FOR JOY\n\nAS IT FEELS THE TREAD OF THOSE WHO MARCH FOR GOD.\n\nALL THIS I PRAY THEE; AND YET THIS MORE: THAT THERE\n\nMAY BE NO STAIN UPON MY STONES, FOREVER.

The\n\nmost important element in education is the creat-\n\ning in the student of an intense yearning for and de-\n\nlight in the Good, the True, and the Beautiful, and\n\nthe first essential for the creation of such a spirit is\n\nthe example set before him by the faculty. The ob-\n\nject of an Oglethorpe education is to furnish the stu-\n\ndent with deeper thoughts, finer emotions and nobler\n\npurposes to the end that he may more clearly under-\n\nstand, more fully enjoy and more excellently behave\n\nin the world. It has been the purpose of the Board\n\nof Directors in making their selection of members of\n\nthe faculty to choose them from as many different\n\nsections of America as possible, thus providing a rep-\n\nresentative and cosmopolitan American corps of\n\nteachers.\n\nTHORNWELL JACOBS\n\nA.B., Presbyterian College of South Carolina, Vale-\n\ndictorian and Medalist ; A.M., P.

After a while the long distance which\n\nmust be traveled by stage or horseback, suggested the\n\nbuilding of a similar institution under the auspices of\n\nPresbyterianism in the South. The movement began\n\nwith the spring meeting of Hopewell Presbytery in\n\nthe year 1823, and eventuated in the founding of a\n\nmanual training school, and this in turn, became\n\nOglethorpe College in 1835 when Midway Hill, in the\n\nsuburbs of Milledgeville, then the capital of the state\n\nof Georgia, was chosen for the location of the insti-\n\ntution. Old Oglethorpe College was thus the first de-\n\nnominational college or university between the Atlan-\n\ntic and Pacific Oceans south of the Virginia line, and,\n\nof a right, claimed to be the Alma Mater of all that\n\nbrilliant company of institutions which were bom\n\nafter her in this vast empire.\n\nThe facilities of the old Oglethorpe were adequate\n\nfor the time. The main building was probably the\n\nhandsomest college structure in the Southeast when\n\nit was erected, and \"contained the finest college chapel\n\nin the United States not excepting Yale, Harvard or\n\nPrinceton.\"\n\nIn the faculty of the institution may be found the\n\nnames of men who were world famous. Among these\n\nwere Joseph LeConte, the great geologist, James\n\nWoodrow, the brilliant and devoted Christian and sci-\n\nentist, Samuel K, Talmadge, the eminent administra-\n\n26 Oglethorpe University\n\ntor and many others. It is, perhaps, the chief glory\n\nof old Oglethorpe that after three years of instruction\n\nshe graduated Sidney Lanier of the famous class of\n\n1860 and that he was a tutor to her sons until the\n\nspring of '61 when with the Oglethorpe cadets he\n\nmarched away to the wars. Shortly before his death,\n\nLanier, looking back over his career, remarked to a\n\nfriend that the greatest intellectual impulse of his life\n\nhad come to him during his college days at Oglethorpe\n\nthrough the influence of Dr. Woodrow. Her other\n\neminent alumni include governors, justices, modera-\n\ntors of the General Assembly, discoverers, inventors\n\nand a host of honest, industrious and superb laborers\n\nfor the highest ideals of humanity.\n\nOglethorpe \"died at Gettysburg,\" for during the\n\nwar her sons were soldiers, her endowment was in-\n\nvested in Confederate bonds, and her buildings which\n\nwere used for barracks and hospital, were later des-\n\ntroyed. An effort was made to revive the institution\n\nin the *70's and to locate it in Atlanta, but the evils\n\nof reconstruction days and financial disaster made\n\nthe adventure impossible, and after a year and a half\n\nof struggle the doors were closed for the second time.\n\nOnly twenty-nine years have passed since the pres-\n\nent movement to re-found the university began and\n\nthey have been years of financial disaster and utter\n\nturmoil, yet the assets and subscription pledges of\n\nthe institution have passed the sum of one and a half\n\nmillion dollars as the result of unusual and self-sac-\n\nrificing liberality on the part of over five thousand\n\npeople.\n\nThe corner stone of Oglethorpe University was\n\nlaid on January 21, 1915, with her trustful motto en-\n\ngraved upon it: \"Manu Dei Resurrexit\" (By the Hand\n\nof God She Has Risen From the Dead).\n\nOglethorpe University 27\n\nThe Opening, September 20, 1916\n\nOglethorpe University opened her doors in the au-\n\ntumn of 1916. After 50 years of rest beneath the gray\n\nashes of fratricidal strife she rose to breathe the airs\n\nof a new day. Her first building, constructed of gran-\n\nite trimmed with limestone, covered with variegated\n\nslates and as near fire proof as human skill can make\n\nit, was ready for occupancy in the fall of 1916, when\n\nthe first class gathered on her beautiful campus on\n\nPeachtree Road. A faculty equal to that of any cog-\n\nnate institution in the country was formed. The work\n\nof raising funds and new construction goes steadily\n\non. All of this has been done in the midst of finan-\n\ncial disaster that has darkened the spirit of the whole\n\nnation.\n\nThe Romance of Her Resurrection\n\nThe story of the resurrection of Oglethorpe reads\n\nlike a romance. Beginning only twenty-nine years\n\nago with a contribution of $100.00 a year for ten years\n\nfrom her present president, it soon gathered with it\n\na band of great-hearted Atlanta men who determined\n\nto see that their city had a university, as well as a\n\nband of far-seeing educational leaders, who wished\n\nto erect a certain type of institution in this splendid\n\nmetropolis. The story of how dollar was added to\n\ndollar during the campaign of four years; of how no\n\nless than seventy Atlanta men gave each $1,000.00 or\n\nmore to the enterprise; of how the story was told in\n\n101 cities and towns all over the South from Galves-\n\nton, Texas, to Charlottsville, Virginia, and from\n\nMarshall, Missouri, to Bradenton, Florida, each one\n\nof them giving $1,000 or more to the enterprise; the\n\nsplendid triumph of the Atlanta campaigns; all this\n\n28 Oglethorpe University\n\nis well known. Since that time the same wonderful\n\nrecord has been maintained. There are now something\n\nlike five thousand men. women and children, all of\n\nwhom have contributed or promised from fifty cents\n\nto $1,000. They are the Founders' Club which is\n\ncarrying the movement forward so splendidly.\n\nHer Architectural Beauty\n\nAn idea of the quality of construction and design of\n\nthe institution may be gained from the illustrated\n\nmaterial accompanying this catalog.\n\nIt will be seen that the architects and landscape\n\nartists have spared no pains to make Oglethorpe one\n\nof the really beautiful universities of America. The\n\narchitecture is Collegiate Gothic; the building mate-\n\nrial is a beautiful blue granite trimmed with lime-\n\nstone. All the buildings are covered with heavy vari-\n\negated slates. The interior construction is of steel,\n\nconcrete, brick and hollow tile. The building given\n\nby Mr. and Mrs. Lupton and their son, our beloved\n\nbenefactors, is the one with the tower just opposite\n\non the left of the entrance. Lowry Hall, the gift of\n\nCol. and Mrs. R. J. Lowry, stands completed at the\n\nend of the main axis directly in front of the entrance.\n\nThe total cost of construction of the buildings men-\n\ntioned above with the land and the landscape work\n\nrequired, will be approximately $4,000,000. The build-\n\ning plan will be followed out in its entirety.\n\nThe Oglethorpe Campus\n\nBy the generosity of Mr. William Randolph Hearst,\n\nOglethorpe is the possessor of one of the finest college\n\ncampuses in the entire world. In the summer of 1929\n\nMr. Hearst gave to the University the entire Silver\n\nOglethorpe University 29\n\nLake Estates, four hundred acres of primeval forest\n\nsurrounding an eighty acre lake with something like\n\nfive miles of graded roads winding through it. As\n\nthis property immediately adjoins the two hundred\n\nacres already possessed by the University, the com-\n\npleted campus consists of a body of six hundred acres\n\nof land in one tract in the immediate vicinity of At-\n\nlanta, on Peachtree Road and on the main line of the\n\nSouthern Railroad. This gift of Mr. Hearst provides\n\nfor the University ample space for future develop-\n\nment and protects its growth from encroachment by\n\nurban Atlanta whose suburbs are rapidly surrounding\n\nthe campus.\n\nHermance Stadium\n\nDuring the summer of 1929 the first section of\n\nHermance Stadium was erected at a cost of something\n\nover $100,000. Like all the other Oglethorpe build-\n\nings it is constructed of granite, trimmed with carved\n\nlimestone. The seats are of reinforced concrete. This\n\nfirst section which seats about five thousand, com-\n\nprises approximately one-ninth of the total seating\n\ncapacity. When completed it will have cost something\n\nlike $750,000 and will have a seating capacity of ap-\n\nproximately that of the Roman Colosseum, 45,000. It\n\nis named in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Harry P. Hermance,\n\nHal Hermance and Miss Helena Hermance, the don-\n\nors.\n\nHer Spiritual and Intellectual Ideals\n\nBut it is not so much the magnificent exterior of\n\nthe institution about which the men who are founding\n\nOglethorpe are most concerned, it is the spiritual and\n\nintellectual life of their university. To that end they\n\n30 Oglethorpe Univbsity\n\nhave resolved to maintain a faculty and a curriculum\n\nthat will be of the highest possible quality, their\n\nthought being excellence in every department. They\n\nare taking the superb traditions of the Old Ogle-\n\nthorpe and adding the best of the present age to them.\n\nFounders' Book\n\nIn the Founders' Room at Oglethorpe there will be\n\na book containing the name of every man, woman and\n\nchild who aided in the founding of the University,\n\narranged alphabetically by states. That Book will\n\nbe accessible to every student and visitor who may\n\nwant to know who it was from his or her home that\n\ntook part in the doing of this, the greatest deed that\n\nhas been attempted for our sons and daughters in\n\nthis generation. The Book is not yet complete, be-\n\ncause the work is not yet finished, and each month is\n\nadding many to this roll of honor, whose names will\n\nthus be preserved in the life and archives of Ogle-\n\nthorpe University forever.\n\nClock and Chimes\n\nIn the tower of the building given by Mr. and Mrs.\n\nJ, T. Lupton, is installed a clock and chimes, with\n\nthree dials, ten bells and night illumination, the gift\n\nof friends of the University. It is interesting to note\n\nthat this is the only set of chimes on any college cam-\n\npus in Georgia. Concerts are given daily.\n\nImmediate Purpose and Scope\n\nThe purpose of Oglethorpe University is to offer\n\ncourses of study leading to the higher academic and\n\nprofessional degrees, under a Christian environment,\n\nand thus to train young men who wish to become spe-\n\nOglethorpe Univirsity 31\n\ncialists in professional and business life and teachers\n\nin our high schools and colleges, and to supply the\n\ngrowing demand for specially equipi>ed men in every\n\ndepartment of human activity.\n\nStudents who are looking forward to university\n\nwork are invited to correspond with the President in\n\norder that they may prepare themselves for the ad-\n\nvanced courses which are to be offered.\n\nAdequate library and laboratory facilities are pro-\n\nvided. Free use is made of the city of Atlanta, in\n\nitself a remarkable laboratory of industrial and scien-\n\ntific life, whose museums, libraries, and municipal\n\nplants are at the disposal of our students for obser-\n\nvation, inspection and investigation.\n\nGrounds and Buildings\n\nThe campus consists of approximately six hundred\n\nacres of land including an eighty acre lake which\n\nis situated in the northwestern section of the campus.\n\nIn front of the entrance to the campus is the term-\n\ninus of the Oglethorpe University street car line, and\n\nan attractive little stone station of the Southern Rail-\n\nway main line beween Atlanta and Washington. The\n\nfirst building to be located on the campus, the Ad-\n\nministration Building, contains in the basement a din-\n\ning room ; on the ground floor, chemistry and physics\n\nlecture rooms, and laboratories, the administrative\n\noffices and lounging room for young ladies attending\n\nthe college; on the second and third floors, the hospi-\n\ntal and dormitories. Lupton Hall contains the libra-\n\nry, the President's office, class rooms, dormitories, an\n\nAssembly Hall seating approximately six hundred,\n\nequipped also as a theatre for the presentation of stu-\n\ndent dramas, and in the basement, basketball court,\n\nswimming pool, lockers and showers, and quarters\n\n32 Oglethorpe University\n\nof the University Press. The University Press is\n\nequipped with a Babcock optimus press, linotype ma-\n\nchine and two job presses, with a number of type\n\nstands and other printing equipment given by a friend\n\nof the University.\n\nLowry Hall houses the Lowry School of Banking\n\nand Commerce, and the Art Studios. It is largely a\n\nreplica of old Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the\n\nalma mater of James Edward Oglethorpe. It contains\n\nclass rooms and dormitories, and will stand as a per-\n\npetual memorial to the generosity of Colonel R. J.\n\nLowry and Emma Markham Lowry.\n\nENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS\n\nIn the Schools of Liberal Arts, Literature and\n\nJournalism, Science, Business Administration,\n\nEducation, Secretarial Preparation, Fine\n\nArts, and Physical Education\n\nThe requirement for entrance to the Academic\n\nSchools of Oglethorpe University is a certificate of\n\ngraduation from an accredited high school.* Or in\n\ncase of non-graduation, if the candidate has fifteen\n\nunits from an accredited high school he may absolve\n\nhis deficiencies by standing entrance examinations on\n\nfour subjects, two of which shall be English and\n\nMathematics. A student who has completed in a sec-\n\nondary school two years of a foreign language will\n\nnot receive credit for a beginner's course in the same\n\nlanguage. The candidate must present at least three\n\n* students coming from outside the State of Georgia may be\n\nadmitted on fifteen units without a high school diploma and\n\nwithout examination, but a certificate must be presented.\n\nUnexcused absences will be counted against a student who is\n\nin arrears on the payment of dues, dating from the time when\n\npayment is due.\n\nOglethorpe University 33\n\nunits in English and two units in Mathematics. A\n\nunit represents a year's study in any subject in an ac-\n\ncredited high school.\n\nProspective students are requested to bring their\n\nHigh School certificates with them; better still, to\n\nhave them sent to the Registrar before applying for\n\nregistration.\n\nList of Entrance Units\n\nFifteen units may be selected from the following list:\n\nGroup I\n\nEnglish Grammar 1 I unit\n\nRhetoric I 1 unit\n\nEnglish Literature I or II 1 unit\n\nGroup II\n\nAlgebra (to quadratics) 1 unit\n\nAlgebra (quadratics and beyond) i/2 or 1 unit\n\nGeometry (Plane) 1 unit\n\nGeometry (Solid) i/4 unit\n\nGroup III\n\nTrigonometry i/^ unit\n\nAdvanced Arithmetic 1 unit\n\nLatin 1, 2, 3, or 4 units\n\nGreek 1, 2, or 3 units\n\nGerman 1 or 2 units\n\nFrench ___. 1 or 2 units\n\nSpanish 1 or 2 units\n\n(Not less than one unit of any foreign language will\n\nbe accepted).\n\nGroup IV\n\nAmerican History or American History and\n\nCivil Government 1 unit\n\nAncient History (Greek and Roman) and Me-\n\ndieval History to Modern Times 1 unit\n\n34 Oglethorpe University\n\nModem History (General History may be\n\ncounted as a unit, but not in addition to\n\nAncient, Medieval and Modern History) 1 unit\n\nEnglish History 1 unit\n\nGroup V\n\nGeneral Science 1 unit\n\nPhysics 1 unit\n\nChemistry 1 unit\n\nZoology 1/2 or 1 unit\n\nBotany i/^ or 1 unit\n\nPhysical Geography 1/2 or 1 unit\n\nPhysiology, Zoology, Botany. Any two of\n\nthese may be counted together as 1 unit\n\nSpecial Students\n\nstudents twenty-one years of age may be admitted\n\nfor special study upon satisfying the Faculty as to\n\ntheir ability to do the work of the classes which they\n\nwish to enter. Such students may become regular\n\nonly by absolving all entrance requirements.\n\nPersons under twenty-one years of age desiring to\n\npursue special courses not leading to a degree may do\n\nso as unregistered students upon the passage of an ex-\n\namination or examinations satisfactory to the Dean\n\nof the department in which the work is to be done.\n\nThe minimum number of subjects permitted is\n\ntwelve clock hours per week.\n\nStandards for Georgia Colleges*\n\nThe following standards have been adopted by the\n\nState Board of Education of Georgia. They are de-\n\nsigned to serve two purposes :\n\n(a) A basis of granting charters to new or pro-\n\n* These standards have been adopted by Oglethorpe Univer-\n\nsity and are effective as of September 23, 1931.\n\nOglethorpe University 35\n\nposed higher educational institutions under the pro-\n\nvisions of Section 14 of the Georgia Code.**\n\n(b) A basis for preparing an approved list of teach-\n\ner training institutions for the State of Georgia.\n\nIt is not proposed that these standards should op-\n\nerate to make it impossible for a worthy new enter-\n\nprise to be begun, nor for a worthy institution now\n\nin operation to be denied a fair opportunity for de-\n\nvelopment.\n\nIt is, therefore, agreed that:\n\n(a) In the case of proposed new institutions of\n\nhigher learning, if the Board of Education is satisfied\n\nthat such institution has a reasonable possibility of\n\nmeeting these standards within three years a provis-\n\nional charter for three years may be granted, such\n\ncharter to be made permanent if and when such in-\n\nstitution shall have met the conditions of these stand-\n\nards.\n\n(b) In the case of institutions now in operation,\n\nthe application of these standards shall not go into\n\neffect until after the expiration of three years from\n\nthe date of the adoption of these standards.\n\nStandards for Colleges\n\n1. Definition:\n\nA standard college, university, or technological in-\n\nstitution designated as \"college\" in this statement\n\nof standards is an institution:\n\n(a) Which is legally authorized to give non-profes-\n\nsional Bachelor's degrees;\n\n** Section 14. No charter giving the right to confer degrees\n\nor issue diplomas shall be granted to any proposed institution\n\nof learning within the state of Georgia until the proper show-\n\ning has been made to the State Board of Education that the\n\nproposed University, College, Normal, or Professional school\n\nshall give evidence of its ability to meet the standard require-\n\nments set up by the State Board of Education.\n\n36 Oglethorpe University\n\n(b) Which is organized definitely on the basis of\n\nthe completion of a standard secondary school\n\ncurriculum ;\n\n(c) Which organizes its curricula in such a way\n\nthat the early years are a continuation of, and\n\nsupplement the work of the secondary school\n\nand at least the last two years are shaped more\n\nor less distinctly in the direction of special,\n\nprofessional, or graduate instruction;\n\n(d) Which is separate and distinct, both in faculty\n\nand operation, from any high school.\n\n2. Entrance or Admission:\n\nA college shall demand for admission of candidates\n\nfor degrees the satisfactory completion of a four year\n\ncourse (15 units from a four year high school or\n\ntwelve units from a three year senior high school) in\n\na secondary school approved by a recognized accred-\n\niting agency or the equivalent of such a course, as\n\nshown by examination. The major portion of the sec-\n\nondary school course accepted for admission should\n\nbe definitely correlated with the curriculum to which\n\nthe student is admitted.\n\nPersons over 21 years of age, who do not meet re-\n\nquirements for admission, may be admitted to reg-\n\nular college courses if the authorities of the college\n\nare satisfied that such persons can carry the courses\n\nsatisfactorily. These shall be classified as special\n\nstudents and shall not be admitted to candidacy for\n\nbachelor's degrees until all entrance requirements\n\nhave been satisfied.\n\n3. Graduation:\n\nA college shall require for graduation the comple-\n\ntion of a minimum quantitative requirement of 120\n\nsemester hours of credit (or the equivalent in term\n\nOglethorpe University 37\n\nhours, quarter hours, points, majors, or courses) with\n\nfurther qualitative requirements adapted by each in-\n\nstitution to its conditions.\n\nA semester hour is defined as a credit for work in\n\na class which meets for at least one sixty-minute p'er-\n\niod (including ten minutes for change of classes)\n\nweekly for lecture, recitation, or test for a semester\n\nof 'eighteen weeks (including not over two weeks for\n\nall holidays and vacations). Two hours of laboratory\n\nwork shall count as the equivalent of one hour of\n\nlecture, recitation, or test.\n\n4. Degrees:\n\nSmall institutions should confine themselves to one\n\nor two baccalaureate degrees. When more than one\n\nbaccalaureate degree is offered, all shall be equal in\n\nrequirements for admission and graduation. Insti-\n\ntutions of limited resources and inadequate facilities\n\nfor graduate work should confine themselves to strict-\n\nly undergraduate courses.\n\n5. Permanent Records:\n\nA system of permanent records showing clearly all\n\ncredits (including entrance records) of each student\n\nshall be carefully kept. The original credentials filed\n\nfrom other institutions shall be retained. As far\n\nas possible, records of graduates should be kept.\n\n6. Size of Faculty and Number of Departments:\n\nA college of arts and sciences of approximately 100\n\nstudents should maintain at least eight separate de-\n\npartments with at least one professor in each dievot-\n\ning his whole time to that department. The size of\n\nthe faculty should bear a definite relation to the type\n\nof the institution, the number of students, and the\n\nnumber of courses offered. With the growth of the\n\n38 Oglethorpe University\n\nstudent body, the number of full-time teachers should\n\nbe correspondingly increased. The development of\n\nvaried curricula should involve the addition of other\n\nheads of departments.\n\n7. Training of Faculty:\n\nFaculty members of professional rank should have\n\nnot less than orie full year of graduate work, major-\n\ning in the subject taught, in addition to a bachelor's\n\ndegree from a fully accredited college, and should\n\nhave two years of training in an approved graduate\n\nschool.\n\nThe training of the head of each department shall\n\nbe that represented by two full years of graduatve\n\nwork or its equivalent.\n\n8. Faculty Load:\n\nThe number of hours of class room work given by\n\neach teacher will vary in different departments. To\n\ndetermine this, the amount of preparation required\n\nfor the class and the amount of time needed for study\n\nto keep abreast of the subject, together with the\n\nnumber of students, must be taken into account.\n\nTeaching schedules, including classes for part-time\n\nstudents, exceeding 18 recitation hours or their equiv-\n\nalent per week per instructor, will be interpreted as\n\nendangering educational efficiency. Sixteen hours is\n\nthe recommended maximum load.\n\n9. Size of Classes:\n\nClasses (exclusive of lectures) of more than thirty\n\nstudents should be interpreted as endangering educa-\n\ntional efficiency.\n\n10. Financial Support:\n\nThe minimum annual operating income for an ac-\n\ncredited college, exclusive of payment of interest, an-\n\nOglethorpe University 39\n\nnuities, etc., should be $30,000, of which not less than\n\n$15,000 should be derived from stable sources, other\n\nthan students, such as permanent endowment, public\n\nfunds or church support. Increase in faculty, stu-\n\ndent body and scope of instruction should be accom-\n\npanied by a corresponding increase of income from\n\nsuch stable sources. The financial status of each col-\n\nlege should be judged in relation to its educational\n\nprogram.\n\nA college that does not have such support from en-\n\ndowment, church, state or public sources must show,\n\nfor a period of three consecutive years immediately\n\npreceding its application for accrediting, that its\n\ncharges and expenditures are such as to show a min-\n\nimum average annual n'et surplus of not less than\n\n$15,000 from non-educational services, such as board,\n\nroom rents, etc., which may be used to supplement\n\ntuition fees.\n\n11. Library:\n\nA college should have a live, well-distributed, ade-\n\nquately housed library of at least 8,000 volumes, ex-\n\nclusive of public documents, bearing specifically upon\n\nthe subjects taught, administered by a full-time pro-\n\nfessionally trained librarian, and with a definite an-\n\nnual appropriation for the purchase of new books.\n\n12. Laboratories:\n\nThe laboratory equipment shall be adequate for all\n\nthe experiments called for by the courses offered in\n\nthe sciences, and these facilities shall be kept up by\n\nmeans of an annual appropriation in keeping with the\n\ncurriculum.\n\n13. General Equipment and Buildings:\n\nThe location and construction of the buildings, the\n\nlighting, heating and ventilation of the rooms, the\n\n40 Oglethorpe University\n\nnature of the laboratories, corridors, closets, water\n\nsupply, school furniture, apparatus, and methods of\n\ncleaning shall be such as to insure hygienic conditions\n\nfor both studients and teachers.\n\n14. Proportion of Students Candidates for Degrees:\n\nNo institution shall be admitted to the accredited\n\nlist, or continued more than one year on such list, un-\n\nless it has a college registration of at least 100 reg-\n\nular students. A notably small proportion of college\n\nstudents registered in the third and fourth years will\n\nconstitute ground for dropping an institution from\n\nthe accredited list.\n\nAt least 75 per cent of the students in a college\n\nshould be pursuing courses leading to baccalaureate\n\ndegrees; provided, however, that this shall not apply\n\nto students enrolled in extension, correspondence or\n\nother similar departments, not in regular course for\n\na degree, in an institution which otherwise meets\n\nthese standards.\n\n15. Character of the Curriculum:\n\nThe character of the curriculum, the standards for\n\nregular degrees, the conservatism in granting honor-\n\nary d'egrees, provision in the curriculum for breadth\n\nof study and for concentration, soundness of scholar-\n\nship, the practice of scientific spirit including freedom\n\nof investigation and teaching, loyalty to facts, and\n\nencouragement of efficiency, initiative and originality\n\nin investigation and teaching, the tone of the institu-\n\ntion, including the existence and culture of good mor-\n\nals and ideals, and satisfaction and enthusiasm among\n\nstudents and staff shall be factors in determining its\n\nstanding.\n\n16. Extra-Curricular Activities:\n\nThe proper administration of athletics, student\n\nOglethorpe University 41\n\npublications, student organizations, and all extra-cur-\n\nricular activities, is one of the fundamental tests of a\n\nstandard college and, therefore, should be considered\n\nin classification.\n\n17. Professional and Technical Departments:\n\nWhen the institution has, in addition to the college\n\nof arts and sciences, professional or technical depart-\n\nments, the colleges of arts and sciences shall not be\n\naccepted for the approved list of the State Department\n\nof Education unless the professional or technical de-\n\npartments are of approved grade, national standards\n\nbeing used when available.\n\n18. Inspection and Reports:\n\nFiling of Blank No institution shall be placed on\n\nthe approved list unless a regular information blank\n\nhas been filed with the State Department of Educa-\n\ntion. The blank shall be filed again for each of the\n\nthree years after the college has been approved, and\n\ntriennially thereafter, but the Department may for\n\ndue cause call upon any member to file a new report\n\nat any time. Failure to file the blank as required\n\nshall be cause for dropping an institution.\n\nInspection No college will be placed on the ap-\n\nproved list until it has been inspected and reported\n\nupon by the agent or agents regularly appointed by\n\nthe State Department of Education. All colleges ac-\n\ncredited by the Department shall be open to inspec-\n\ntion at any time.\n\nOglethorpe University was the first educational in-\n\nstitution in Georgia to be inspected and fully accred-\n\nited by the State Board of Education after the adop-\n\ntion of the above Standards, following the approval\n\nof them by all the educational institutions in the com-\n\nmonwealth.\n\n42 Oglethorpe University\n\nGeneral Information\n\nREGISTRATION\n\n1. Each student will first report of the Dean of the\n\nschool in which he wishes to register. With his\n\ncourse and schedule approved by his Dean, the stu-\n\ndent will present his schedule card to the Registrar.\n\nHe will then record his courses on triplicate cards.\n\n2. A student is not considered registered until he\n\nregisters his subjects in the Registrar's office, has\n\nthese courses approved by the Registrar, secures a\n\nbill from the Bursar, and pays the Cashier.\n\n3. No student is to be admitted to class without\n\na student card issued by the Cashier when he has set-\n\ntled his financial obligations to the University.\n\n4. At the beginning of each term, a few days after\n\nregistration, the Registrar sends to each professor\n\ncourse cards for each student who has registered.\n\nShould a student fail to appear in class before the\n\nten days allowed for changing, dropping, or adding\n\nsubjects, the professor is to notify the Registrar im-\n\nmediately. Failure of the professor to do so does\n\nnot excuse the student from the financial obligation\n\ninvolved.\n\n5. As soon as course cards are received from the\n\nRegistrar's office, each professor must check his\n\nroll and report to the Registrar immediately the\n\nnames of any students in his classes for whom he\n\ndoes not have a card.\n\n6. Subjects may be changed, dropped or added\n\nonly during the first ten days' of each term and only\n\nupon written permission from the Dean of the school\n\nin which the student is enrolled.\n\n7. Students are allowed to register up to one-third\n\nof the term. It is necessary that a student attend at\n\nOglethorpe University 43\n\nleast two-thirds of the term's classes if credit is de-\n\nsired.\n\n8. Each student is required to register in person,\n\n9. A fine of $1.00 per day (maximum limit one-\n\nthird of the duration of the term concerned) is charg-\n\ned for any student who registers after the dates set\n\naside for registration as per college calendar.\n\n10. As it is impossible to know how many hours of\n\nwork each student will register for at the beginning\n\nof each term, no bills are sent out in advance. The\n\nstudent is advised to get an estimate of his expense\n\nbefore the term begins.\n\n11. Deans of departments can require delinquent\n\nstudents to drop specific courses only at the begin-\n\nning of each term.\n\n12. In the Summer School students must register\n\nwithin six days of the beginning of each term.\n\nLATE REGISTRATION\n\nA charge of $1 a day will be made for students\n\nwho register after the time set for registration at\n\nthe beginning of the winter and spring terms.\n\nFINES\n\nA penalty of $1.00 will be charged each student\n\nmoving articles of furniture from one room to an-\n\nother without permission from either the Bursar's of-\n\nfice or the Cashier's office. This fine will also be\n\ncharged any student changing his room without per-\n\nmission from the office.\n\nA fine of $1.00 a day (up to one-third of the term)\n\nwill be charged for late registration, Winter and\n\nSpring terms.\n\nA fine of $5.00 is charged if any student attends\n\na class or examination without registration, which in-\n\ncludes payment of charges.\n\n44 Oglethorpe University\n\nCLASSIFICATION\n\nAs a basis for determining the classes to which a\n\nstudent shall belong, the following regulation is to\n\napply: a first year student must have fulfilled the\n\nrequirements for entrance to his class by one of the\n\nmethods specified. In addition to his entrance units,\n\na second year student must have completed fifteen\n\nyear hours; a junior thirty year hours; and a senior\n\nforty-five year hours. Special students will not be\n\neligible for admission to either of the four college\n\nclasses, or membership in any of the social fraterni-\n\nties or the athletic or forensic teams representing the\n\nUniversity. A student failing to receive sufficient\n\ncredits during any year to entitle him to enter the\n\nnext higher class must remain in the lower class un-\n\ntil the deficiencies are absolved. Back work in a re-\n\nquired subject must be made up within the next term ;\n\notherwise the student will be excluded from the class\n\nto which he would naturally belong.\n\nACADEMIC HOURS\n\nThe average number of hours a week for first year\n\nstudents is sixteen to seventeen, and is uniform for\n\nall schools of the University. The number of hours\n\na week for the upperclassmen differs. In order to\n\navoid errors in registration all students are required\n\nto arrange their courses and hours with the Deans of\n\nthe schools which they wish to enter. This also ap-\n\nplies to special students.\n\nFreshmen, Sophomores, and Juniors may not take\n\nmore than 18 hours a week unless they have made\n\nan average of B with no grade below C in the pre-\n\nvious term. If a student wishes to make more than 20\n\nhours, the written consent of the Dean must be se-\n\ncured, regardless of the average made. Seniors are\n\nOglejthorpe University 45\n\nnot limited, but the written consent of the Dean must\n\nbe secured.\n\nThere must be 66 minimum year hours (198 term\n\nhours) of regular standard work for every degree.\n\nOne hour per year may be selected by the student from\n\nMusic, Intramural Sports, Football, Debaters' Club,\n\nPlayers' Club and work on the Pfetrel, not on the\n\nYamacraw. The student must register in advance and\n\npay for these, and they must be certified to by the\n\nprofessor in charge.\n\nEXAMINATIONS\n\nFor a supplemental examination, whether on ac-\n\ncount of failure to pass or absence from the Univer-\n\nsity, the student is to pay a fee of $2.00, receipt for\n\nwhich must be secured from the Cashier and pre-\n\nsented to the professor before the examination is\n\ngiven. The examination must be taken in the term\n\nfollowing the regular term. In case the student is\n\nout of school one or more terms, he may take it in the\n\nterm in which he returns. If the grade is below 50,\n\nthe student is not entitled to a re-examination. A fine\n\nof $5 is imposed upon any student taking a re-exami-\n\nnation without having paid this $2 fee in advance.\n\nABSENCES\n\nA student accumulating a total of ten unexcu^d\n\nabsences from all classes in one term will forfeit one\n\nhour of credit and two quality points. A total of four\n\nabsences in one term from the Tuesday morning As-\n\nsembly carries the same penalty.\n\nAll absences concerning illness are to be referred to\n\nand approved by Miss Feebeck, head of the infirmary.\n\nAbsences concerning college affairs are to be referred\n\nto and approved by Dean Patrick. Reports on absen-\n\nces are to be filed in the Registrar's office, and stu-\n\n46 Oglethorpe University\n\ndents are not to be excused by any other faculty mem-\n\nber.\n\nExcused absences are those caused by illness, ab-\n\nsence from classes on account of college duties, or for\n\nother reasons approv^ed by the Dean,\n\nExcuses for absences must be filed in the Regis-\n\ntrar's office by the Monday afternoon following the\n\nweek in which the absences occurred.\n\nContinued and deliberate cutting of classes may in-\n\nvolve dismissal from the University.\n\nAbsences will be counted from the first regular class\n\nsession, whether the student is enrolled at the time or\n\nnot, unless excused by the Dean.\n\nFAILURE IN STUDIES\n\nA student who is failing in any of his courses dur-\n\ning a term will be given personal warning, and a let-\n\nter will be written to his parent or guardian by the\n\nDean of his school or the Registrar. If a student be\n\nseriously behind he may be required to withdraw from\n\nthe University.\n\nA student must pass at least 50 per cent of his work\n\neach term; failure for two successive terms shall au-\n\ntomatically cause the student to be dropped, provid-\n\ned however that if such student has registered for\n\nthe ensuing term he may continue until the comple-\n\ntion thereof, and if he shall have exhibited a marked\n\nimprovement in his studies, the Dean of his depart-\n\nment may recommend to the faculty the continuance\n\nof such student.\n\nWITHDRAWALS\n\nNo withdrawals from the University can be consid-\n\nered as duly authorized unless a student officially no-\n\ntifies the Dean of the University at the time of with-\n\ndrawal. Mere absence from school or non-attendance\n\nupon any classes cannot be construed as definite with-\n\nOglethorpe University 47\n\ndrawal. If the reasons for withdrawal are acceptable\n\nto the Dean, the student's withdrawal is approved, re-\n\ncorded, and dated ; and the student is entitled to \"hon-\n\norable dismissal.\"\n\nCourses of Instruction and\n\nRequirements for Degrees\n\nIn the session of 1940-41 Oglethorpe University will\n\noffer courses in the undergraduate classes of eight\n\nschools leading to the customary academic degrees.\n\nThe degree of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) in Liberal\n\nArts will be conferred upon those students satisfac-\n\ntorily completing a four years' course as outlined be-\n\nlow, based largely on the study of the languages. The\n\ndegree of Bachelor of Arts in Science will be confer-\n\nred upon those students who satisfactorily complete\n\na four years' course largely in scientific studies. The\n\ndegree of Bachelor of Arts in Literature and Journal-\n\nism will be given to those students who complete a\n\ncourse including work in languages, literature and\n\njournalism. The degree of Bachelor of Arts in Com-\n\nmerce will be conferred upon those students who sat-\n\nisfactorily complete a full four years' course in the\n\nstudies relating particularly to business administra-\n\ntion.

A diploma,\n\nbut not a degree, is given to students completing a\n\ntwo-year course in Art.\n\n48 Oglethorpe University\n\nThe degree of Bachelor of Arts in Physical Educa-\n\ntion will be given to those students specializing in that\n\ndepartment.\n\nBy a careful study of the courses outlined below,\n\nthe student will be easily able to make the choice most\n\nsuitable to his tastes and probable future hfe.\n\nIn g*eneral, it may be suggested that students pre-\n\nparing to enter such professions as the ministry or\n\nlaw, will choose the A.B. course in Liberal Arts ; those\n\nlooking forward to medicine, dentistry, engineering\n\nand other scientific work, the A.B. course in Science;\n\nthose expecting to enter the literary and journalistic\n\nfield, the A.B. course in Literature, and those who in-\n\ntend to spend their lives in the business world, the\n\nA.B. course in Commerce, or the A.B. course in Secre-\n\ntarial Preparation; those who expect to teach, the\n\nA.B. course in Education.\n\nWhile each of these courses is so shap^ed as to in-\n\nfluence the student towards a certain end, colored\n\nlargely by the type of studies, yet each course will\n\nbe found to include such subjects of general culture\n\nas are necessary to the making of a life as distin-\n\nguished from a living.\n\nGraduates of standard normal schools or junior col-\n\nleges are admitted to the junior class.\n\nQuality Points, Credits, Graduation\n\nThe following system of Quality Points has been\n\nadopted :\n\nSuperior A (90-99) 3 quality points for each year\n\nhour.\n\nGood B (80-89) 2 quality points for each year\n\nhour.\n\nFair C (70-79) 1 quality point for each year hour.\n\nPassing D (60-69) no quality points.\n\nOglethorpe University 49\n\nCondition E (50-59) re-examination allowed.\n\nFailure F (below 50) no re-examination.\n\nInc. Incomplete.\n\nIn the junior division of the college 30 quality points\n\nmust have been achieved before the student is recog-\n\nnized as being in the senior division. The student\n\nlacking the required 30 points will be required to re-\n\nmain in the junior college until the needed quality\n\npoints have been achieved through further studies.\n\nFor graduation in the senior college the student must\n\nhave achieved 30 additional quality points in senior\n\ncollege studies, or a total of 60 quality points for\n\ngraduation and the degree. Transfer students must\n\nachieve 15 quality points for each year spent in study\n\nin Oglethorpe University.\n\nNo fractional credits made either in Oglethorpe\n\nUniversity or by transcript from another institution\n\nwill be recognized for graduation in any freshman or\n\nsophomore subject.\n\nAll transfer credits in order to be acceptable to\n\nOglethorpe University must come from standard in-\n\nstitutions of at least junior college or normal grade.\n\nCorrespondence and extension credits combined will\n\nbe accepted to 25 per cent of the total requirements\n\nfor the degree.\n\nIn determining the rating of both high schools and\n\ncolleges for any year the university is governed by\n\nthe rulings of the department of Education of the\n\nState of Georgia.\n\nDefinite ofRjcial transcripts are required for admis-\n\nsion both to the graduate and under-graduate divis-\n\nions.\n\nA student who has had two years of a modern lan-\n\nguage in high school cannot receive credit for Fresh-\n\nman work in that language.\n\n50 Oglethorpe University\n\nAll diplomas and degrees of Oglethorpe University\n\nare granted upon the basis of credits for regular class\n\nroom attendance and the successful passing of exam-\n\ninations. No credits are given for any form of pri-\n\nvate instruction nor for any course in which the stu-\n\ndent was not formally registered. All courses for\n\nwhich credits are given must be advertised in the cat-\n\nalogue or filed in advance in writing with the Reg-\n\nistrar by the Dean of the Department in which they\n\nare offered and approved by the President of the Uni-\n\nversity, and must be announced by bulletin as avail-\n\nable to any and all students qualified to take them\n\nunder catalogue regulations. All classes must be met\n\nin regular class rooms provided therefor by the Uni-\n\nversity. No credit for any form of work done, other\n\nthan as described above, will be granted.\n\nAPPLICATION FOR DEGREES\n\nCandidates for graduation must file with the Regis-\n\ntrar, at least a month before the time of graduation,\n\na written application, by filling out a blank form pre-\n\npared for the purpose. The student is held respon-\n\nsible for filing this application.\n\nUniversity Expenses\n\nTuition\n\nNo charges are made for the usual College fees\n\nsuch as matriculation, laboratories, infirmary, con-\n\ntingent, and use of library.\n\nThe charge for tuition is $80.00 per term, $240.00\n\nper academic year of approximately nine months. For\n\nthis sum a student is entitled to take from 12 to 17\n\ncredit hours of work per week. No student is per-\n\nmitted to take less than 12 hours per week and those\n\nstudents who take more than 17 credit hours per week\n\nOglethorpe University 51\n\nare required to pay for the extra hours at the rate of\n\n$15.00 per hour. These sums are payable in cash in\n\nadvance, at the beginning of each term, but the Cash-\n\nier is given the authority, when a student has proven\n\nthat his credit is good, to allow that student to pay\n\none half of the charges at the beginning of the term\n\nand the other half on or before a date which the\n\nCashier will set and which will not be later than the\n\nmiddle of the term. This means of paying tuition\n\nfees is applicable also to charges for board and room\n\nrent.\n\nIn the Adult Education Department, charges are\n\n$13.50 for 1/^ course, subject to discount of one-third\n\nto teachers, $9.00 per half course, net. The summer\n\nschool charges for 1940 are the same as charges in\n\nAdult Education Department. No charge will be made\n\nfor room rent during the summer term to any student\n\ntaking 4 courses for the entire summer term or 2\n\ncourses for a half-summer term, and who boards\n\nat the college cafeteria, ($72.00 for the entire\n\nsummer term or $36.00 for the first half.) This free\n\nroom rent applies only to teachers in active service.\n\nRelatives and friends who do not attend college class-\n\nes may board in the dormitories by paying the regu-\n\nlar room rent and board charges.\n\nStudents holding self help positions are not allow*ed\n\nany additional discount on bills or permitted to hold\n\nany other self help job or scholarships. This does not\n\ninclude N.Y.A. Scholarships.\n\nBoard and Room Rent\n\nThe dormitory facilities of Oglethorpe University\n\nare among the safest and most comfortable of those\n\nof cognate institutions in America. All permanent\n\nbuildings of the University will be like those now\n\n52 Oglethorpe University\n\nfinished, which are believed to be entirely fireproof,\n\nbeing constructed of steel, concrete, and granite with\n\npartitions of brick and hollow tile.\n\nThe rates named are based upon two grades of\n\nrooms. The first of these compris'es the entire third\n\nfloor of the Administration Building, the third floor\n\nof Lupton Hall, and the second and third floors of\n\nLowry Hall, divided into individual rooms, with gen-\n\neral toilet and bath on the same floor. Each room\n\ncontains a lavatory furnishing hot and cold water.\n\nThe second grade is that of the second floor of the\n\nAdministration building, and is composed of bed-\n\nrooms with connecting baths. The price charged in-\n\ncludes first class board, steam heat and electric\n\nlights, water and janitor's service; all rooms are fur-\n\nnished adequately and substantially. Every room in\n\nthe dormitory contains ample closet and |or wardrobe\n\nspace. The rooms are large, airy, safe and comfort-\n\nable.\n\nThe furniture is of substantial quality and is ap-\n\nproximately the same for all rooms, including chiffon-\n\nier, study-table, chairs, single beds, springs and mat-\n\ntresses. Room linen, pillows and bed clothing are\n\nfurnished by the student. Application for rooms\n\nshould be made as early as possible. For r*eservation\n\nof room inclose $5.00 reservation fee (non-returnable)\n\nto be credited on first payment for room rent.\n\nAll students rooming in the dormitories are required\n\nalso to board at the college cafeteria and any student\n\nnot rooming on the college campus may take his or her\n\nmeals at the cafeteria. Students employed by the\n\nUniversity must board and room on the campus.\n\nOglethorpe University 53\n\nThe charge for board and room rent per term is as\n\nfollows :\n\nRoom rent: Administration Building, third floor,\n\nLupton Hall, third floor, and Lowry Hall, second and\n\nthird floors (two or more to the room) $26.00 per\n\nterm. Administration Building, second floor $46.00\n\nper term (two or more to the room). The charge for\n\nboard is $72 to $80 for the Autumn term, and $60 to\n\n$70 for the Spring and Winter terms, to suit the vary-\n\ning requirements of the students. This is furnished\n\nin the form of meal tickets. Additional tickets may\n\nbe purchased by the student if desired. No rebate is\n\ngiven on unused meal tickets, and no transfer of use\n\nof meal tickets from one term to another is allowed.\n\nThe University assumes no responsibility for, and will\n\nnot replace, any m'eal tickets which may be lost or\n\nmutilated. All charges are payable in advance by\n\nthe term, of approximately eleven weeks as per col-\n\nlege calendar, and no rebate is allowed for any rea-\n\nson. The particular attention of the student is called\n\nto the fact that the issuance of these meal tickets\n\nis for their convenience, solely; that they are good\n\nonly for meals taken during the term for which they\n\nare issued and that the minimum charge for them is\n\n$72.00 for the Autumn term, and $60.00 for the Spring\n\nand Winter terms, and is not subject to rebate of\n\nany kind on account of failure of students to use the\n\ntickets which are furnished them.\n\nCharges: The University reserves the right to\n\nraise or lower any and all charges, to discontinue any\n\nand all discounts and scholarships, to cancel any and\n\nall contracts for self-help work and to lower or raise\n\ncafeteria prices at will, as conditions may require.\n\nAll charges are based upon and payable by the term,\n\n54 Oglethorpe University\n\nin advance, not by the month or year. The lengths of\n\nterms are specified in the college calendar. When\n\npayments are permitted under special conditions the\n\nobligation of the student to meet deferred payments\n\nis not thereby impair^ed. Such special privileges of\n\npayment will be withdrawn in all cases where the stu-\n\ndent fails to make settlement without previous billing\n\nor notice. A penalty of $5.00 is assessed on all stu-\n\ndents attending classes or any examination without\n\nhaving settled their account in advance and $1 per day\n\nfor delayed registration of Winter and Spring terms.\n\nIf a student attends a single class, or occupies a dor-\n\nmitory room for a single night or purchases a cafe-\n\nteria ticket, the contract for that term is thus made\n\nbinding and no rebate of any kind will be allowed on\n\nboard (cafeteria meal tickets), room rent, tuition or\n\ncollege fees for that term.\n\nThe minimum charges for board and room rent\n\nare set at figures which years of experience have in-\n\ndicated to be suitable to the average student. This\n\nis especially true of board which is set low to suit\n\nmany students who so desire it. Those whose re-\n\nquirements are greater are expected to purchase ex-\n\ntra tickets.\n\nThe University discourages the occupation of one\n\nroom by more than two students and no reduction in\n\nroom rent is permitted on that account except in the\n\ncase of very large rooms furnished barracks style.\n\nThe University cafeteria furnishes a liberal assort-\n\nment of food at moderate prices, varying with the\n\nAtlanta market.\n\nACTIVITY FEE\n\nUpon petition of the Student Body, a special stu-\n\ndent activities fee of $10.00 per term will be charged\n\nOglethorpe University 55\n\nfor the session beginning September 1940. The con-\n\ntingent fee of $3.00 per term at present charged, will\n\nbe cancelled. The $30.00 fee will entitle the student\n\nto a subscription of the weekly student paper, THE\n\nSTORMY PETREL ($1.50 per year), to the student\n\nannual, THE YAMACRAW, ($7.50 per year) and to\n\nten tickets at $1.00 each to each of the three foot-\n\nball games played at Hermance Stadium during the\n\nautumn of 1940. These tickets, the students are at\n\nliberty to sell or use for their friends and guests.\n\nIn addition to the above, a season's pass will be\n\ngiven to each student, admitting him or her, without\n\nfurther charge, to all baseball, basketball and other\n\nathletic contests played on the campus of the Univer-\n\nsity during the above mentioned session.\n\nFINES\n\nA penalty of $1.00 will be charged each student\n\nmoving articles of furniture from one room to an-\n\nother without permission from either the Bursar's of-\n\nfice or the Cashier's office. This fine will also be\n\ncharged any student changing his room without per-\n\nmission from the office.\n\nA fine of $1.00 a day (up to one-third of the term)\n\nwill be charged for late registration, Winter and\n\nSpring terms.\n\nA fine of $5.00 is charged if any student attends\n\na class or examination without registration, which in-\n\ncludes advance payment of charges.\n\nInfirmary\n\nThe University maintains at all times an excellent\n\ninfirmary, with a nurse in attendance, for the prompt\n\ntreatment of accidents and of such cases of sickness\n\n56 Oglethorpe University\n\nas may occur. By this means prolonged and serious\n\nillness can often be prevented. There is a University\n\nphysician who can be s'ecured on short notice when his\n\nservices are needed. Students whose medical needs\n\nexceed the facilities of the infirmary find every re-\n\nquirement satisfied by the hospitals of the city.\n\nThe University makes no charge to thie students\n\nfor infirmary service, which includes also the attend-\n\nance of the college physician in the infirmary. In\n\ncase of special illness requiring operations or the ser-\n\nvices of specialists while the University frequently\n\nis able to secure reduced rates for students, yet we\n\nassume no responsibility beyond such services as our\n\ncollege physician and college infirmary are able to\n\nrender. This includes such accidents and injuries\n\narising from participation in inter-collegiate sports,\n\nas they may feel competent to treat, in which case a\n\nspecial consideration is offered as specified elsewhere.\n\nDirections to New Students\n\nstudents coming to Oglethorpe University from a\n\ndistance should remember that Oglethorpe University\n\nhas its own station on the main line of the Southern\n\nRailway between Atlanta and Washington. Tickets\n\nmay be purchased and baggage checked to Oglethorpe\n\nUniversity, Georgia, the station being immediately in\n\nfront of the campus. Students coming to Atlanta\n\nover other lines may either re-check their baggage to\n\nthe University station, or may have it delivered at a\n\nspecial rate by the Atlanta Baggage and Cab Co. In\n\nusing the latter method mention should always be\n\nmade of the special students' rate at the time the\n\norder is given.\n\nStudents arriving at any of the Railway or Bus\n\nterminals in Atlanta may board \"Oglethorpe\" street\n\nOglethorpe University 57\n\ncars at the points listed b^low. This method of trans-\n\nportation is much more economical than by taxicab.\n\nStudents arriving at the Terminal Station in At-\n\nlanta may walk a distance of four blocks (down Mit-\n\nchell Street to Broad Street, up Broad Street to the\n\nnortheast corner of Broad and Marietta Streets) and\n\nboard the street car.\n\nStudents arriving at the Union Station may walk\n\na distance of two blocks (down Forsyth to Marietta\n\nStreet) and board the street car.\n\nStudents arriving at the Union Bus Terminal may\n\nwalk a distance of two blocks (up Carnegie Way to\n\nPeachtree Street, up Peachtree Street one block to a\n\nsafety zone) and board the same car at this point.\n\nFares on street cars in Atlanta are ten cents for\n\none fare (cash) or four tokens for thirty cents. These\n\ntokens may be purchased from the street car operator.\n\nSummer Session\n\nThe summer term of Oglethorpe University meets\n\nthe requirements of regular students who desire to\n\nspeed up their courses or to make up work that is un-\n\nsatisfactory. It also serves a large number of teach-\n\ners working toward degrees.\n\nAll summer courses are credited toward the attain-\n\nment of a degree, and afford a convenient way to\n\nspeed up the date of graduation. The work is given\n\nin courses and half courses. One course is equivalent\n\nto one and two-third year hours or three and one-third\n\nsemester hours. Write for bulletin of Summer Ses-\n\nsion.\n\nGraduate School\n\nIt is the purpose of Oglethorpe University to de-\n\nvelop a thoroughly excellent Graduate School, offer-\n\n58 Oglethorpe University\n\ning courses in all departments leading to the Master's\n\ndegree. In supplying this need, the management of\n\nthe University will be content only with the very high-\n\nest grades of work and facilities.\n\nCourses leading to the Master's degree in certain\n\ndepartments will be found outlined elsewhere in this\n\ncatalogue, under the appropriate department headmg.\n\nThis degree is based upon that of Bachelor of Arts\n\nof Oglethorpe University or of some other approved\n\ninstitution. The candidate must carry an aggregate\n\nof fifteen hours or nine courses of graduate work,\n\nwith at least two professors. A course is equivalent\n\nto one and two-thirds year hours. One-half course\n\nequals five-sixths year hour. Transfer credits (max-\n\nimum three and one-third year hours) will be allowed.\n\nThe work must be of graduate grade, and must be ap-\n\nproved by the Dean of the Graduate School and the\n\nRegistrar. In addition a thesis is required. But the\n\ndegree is not guaranteed at the end of a fixed period\n\nof time. A certain amount of work must be accom-\n\nplished, and the quality of it must be such as to satisfy\n\nthe professors concerned and the whole faculty.\n\nStudents entering the graduate school in selecting\n\ntheir major courses must present not less than two\n\nyears (six year hours or 4 courses) of under-graduate\n\nwork in the same or closely related subjects evidenced\n\nby official transcripts from standard institutions, rec-\n\nognized as such by the Department of Education of the\n\nState of Georgia. In addition to this the student must\n\nhave had one year (three year hours or 2 courses) of\n\nwork in any subject selected as a minor.\n\nA minimum of fifteen college hours or 9 courses\n\nand a minimum of one year (nine months) of resi-\n\ndence is required for the Master's degree. A mini-\n\nOglethorpe University 59\n\nmum of one year or approximately nine months' resi-\n\ndence is required for the Bachelor's degree. Of the\n\nfifteen hours or nine courses required for the Mas-\n\nter's degree, not less than nine year hours or five and\n\none-half courses shall be devoted to the major subject\n\nand the balance selected by the advice and counsel of\n\nthe Dean of the department in v^hich the student is\n\nworking.
