        "text": "Richy's Blog\n\nIf you would like to comment on Richy's blog, please use the facebook page.\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\n2013\n\nNew Year’s Eve 2012\n\nSo that was 2012. A year anticipated like no other on an international, national and personal level, and to my mind it didn’t disappoint. The Olympics and Paralympics were generally considered a huge success, and along with the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee put Great Britain in a great light, but of course it was mine and Ruthie’s wedding which was the highlight of this marvelous year. That roasting hot August day already seems a long time ago with the all the rain and wind that winter (and to be fair ‘summer’ too) has thus far thrown at us, but the memories of that wonderful occasion remain fresh in the mind, and the new Mrs Munnings and I would like to take this moment to reiterate our gratitude for everyone’s gifts and best wishes.\n\nIt was a year that offered numerous PR opportunities for the Suffolk Guild of Ringers, with the Games, Torch Relay and Jubilee, which ringers took advantage of with much enthusiasm. The Guild Striking Competitions at Blythburgh and Leiston were a fantastic event, as was the AGM – though not as well attended as was hoped - at Boxford, and the Social at Sproughton, whilst the young ringers of Suffolk did tremendously well at the National Youth Striking Contest at Birmingham in a year that saw them generally and promisingly active and enthusiastic with quarters, peals, outings and other get-togethers. And as well as our own marriage, it was lovely to see the Guild Chairman and North-East District Ringing Master, Philip and Maggie tie the knot.\n\nNot that it was all good, as you would expect over the course of twelve months. It started badly for me, with a kidney stone taking me out for a few days, dropping The Vestey Ring on my head, and the sad passing of Uncle Eric, all within the first three weeks of 2012.\n\nAnd from a ringing perspective, Suffolk lost a number of ringers, Marlesford particularly hit with the deaths of Leslie Carter and Alan Rogers within a few weeks of each other, and a year after losing one former resident who had gone on to achieve worldwide ringing fame in the form of Rod Pipe, we lost another one in Harold Rogers, whose funeral was appropriately held at Chediston. As the year draws to a close, we also wish Mick Edwards of Essex, regular treble ringer to peals at The Wolery and Aldeburgh, all the best, as he has been admitted to hospital with a suspected stroke. Get well soon Mick.\n\nBut the overwhelming memories of the past 366 days for most, will be fond ones, and the final one today was up there with many of them, though it was a shame to part company with Mason after a great few days with him since Christmas Day.\n\nStraight after dropping him off, I partook in my final peal of the year and my 501st in total, as we succeeded in ringing quite a decent 5016 Grandsire Cinques at Grundisburgh, which took the Guild’s peal totals for the year up to an impressive 147, the highest for the SGR this century! I know I’ve said this before, but how about 150 next year?\n\nNot that peals are the only way of progressing ringing within our borders, and there was one last achievement this year from Clare Veal today, a girl who has achieved much since January 1st 2012. Well done to her on ringing her first quarter of Buxton Bob and Armitage-is-the-name Bob Minor in the success at Great Barton. More of it next year Clare!\n\nA pint in The Turk’s Head in neighbouring Hasketon was essential – though I somehow lost the Suggett’s along the way – but then it was time to pick Ruthie up from work and prepare for an evening to see out a memorable 2012 and see in a hopeful 2013 which has much to live up to.\n\nWe are lucky as ringers to have the chance to ring the New Year in, and I’ve enjoyed many such occasions at St Mary-le-Tower, Sproughton and Hollesley. This time though, we’d been invited to The Ship in Blaxhall by neighbours Toby and Amy. It was a wonderful night in the dark depths of the far east countryside of Suffolk, with some old faces from my days in nearby Tunstall caught up with, and much food and drink consumed either side of the big countdown at midnight. It was great to finish a wonderful year, in a nice place and with my wife by my side.\n\nHowever your year has been for you, however you spent tonight, Happy New Year and hopefully see you all in 2013!\n\nTop\n\nSunday 30th December 2012\n\nThe last Sabbath of the year was a quiet one. Ruthie was off work and with the choir of St Mary-the-Virgin, Woodbridge not in action again until 2013, she was able to join Mason and me for ringing at St Mary-le-Tower, though with Grundisburgh not ringing this morning, that was all the ringing we did today.\n\nInstead, the day was laid back, with a trip to Tesco to spend Christmas money on clothes for all three of us about as energetic as the remainder of this Sunday got.\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 29th December 2012\n\nRight at the beginning of the year, I set myself the challenge of ringing my five hundredth peal by the end of the year. I needed to ring thirty-eight to get there, not an insurmountable number considering I’ve rung at least thirty peals a year for the last six years. Three and a bit peals per month, that was all. Well doable.\n\nHowever, my problems with a kidney stone stopped me in my tracks before I even got going, and meant I didn’t get my first of 2012 until February was nearly upon us. I’d pretty much got on track by July when other things quite rightly took precedence. And with two miscalls and another loss in recent weeks, I thought I’d been tripped at the final hurdle.\n\nToday saw me achieve my aim with just two days of the 366 to go though, and in the end it was at an appropriate venue, with an appropriate band and – in my opinion – an appropriate level of difficulty.\n\nAlong with St Mary-le-Tower, Pettistree has become my home tower, a place almost as familiar and comfortable to me as my own home, and it was lovely to ring the big one with my wife, mother-in-law and three others who have played a big part in me reaching this total, though others also deserve credit, especially Simon Rudd who called my first, Stephen Pettman and David Salter. And the same composition which tripped us up a couple of weeks ago here, was certainly a test for Mike as the methods were for the band.\n\nWhat I’m most proud of with my five hundred peals is the eclectic mix of them. I’m very fortunate that it has introduced me to some of the best ringers in the world, such as the Pipes Rod, George & David, Alison & Mark Regan, David Brown, Michael Wilby, John & Steph Warboys, Robin Hall, Philip & Jennifer Earis, Andrew Mills, David Hull and even Robert Beavis, amongst others. I have been privileged to ring peals in some of the great ringing chambers, such as St Paul’s Cathedral, York Minster, Exeter Cathedral, Redcliffe and the Bullring, and participated in the kind of ringing that many will never get the chance to participate in.\n\nBut I also delight in the fact that I’ve helped some through their first peal, from Margaret Forrest who impressively rang inside to 8-Spliced Surprise Major, Annie Quilton, Joel Woolf and my brother. That I’ve also found myself ringing peals at places like the sixes at Farndon and Winthorpe in Nottinghamshire and Tushingham in Cheshire, the ten at Staplehurst in Kent as well as many here in Suffolk, such as the old four at Campsea Ashe, the five in picturesque Badingham and the location of my first ever peal Ashbocking. And that I’ve rung peals of Plain Bob Minor, all of which count the same as any of the spliced Surprise Sixteen I’ve rung.\n\nI’m not a prolific peal-ringer, at least compared to the likes of Colin Turner and Paul Pascoe. It’s taken me twenty years to ring what it takes them a couple of years to get under their belt. I hope to be able to reach a thousand peals one day in the future, but it’s highly unlikely I’ll get to two-thousand, let alone the six-thousand that Mr Turner is poised to hit in the next few months.\n\nBut peal-ringing remains for me the best and most enjoyable way of progressing one’s ringing, allowing you to ring with all sorts of people at all sorts of places, giving you the time to hone your skills and produce good ringing (though I’m aware that it doesn’t have a 100% success rate in that field!) in methods you might not usually get the chance to ring. So I’m very pleased to have reached this total and thank all those who have rung a peal with me, thus helping me get to this point.\n\nIt’s a point long since passed by Jeremy Spiller who today rang in his 1000th peal of Minor alone in the impressive looking hand-bell peal of 196 Plain Minor methods at his and Cherril’s home in Bacton. Congratulations Jeremy.\n\nHopefully it is a point that will one day – at the rate that he and his brother are ringing them, it will probably be by the end of next year – be reached by Colin Salter, who today rang his 25th peal in the success at The Wolery so amusingly liked by many on Bellboard. Well done Colin, and well done as well to Nicole Rolph who rang her first quarter of Treble Bob in the 1272 of Kent TB Major at Reydon.\n\nHowever they may have celebrated, we celebrated a worthy success at SS Peter & Paul which doubled up as a peal to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the first peal on the rehung bells with a band photo and a drink in The Greyhound before picking Mason up from Mum and Dad’s, whose generosity in looking after the li’l chap on a number of my five hundred peals is another thing to be grateful for. Thanks guys!\n\nTop\n\nFriday 28th December 2012\n\nIt’s not often that I get to take Mason peal-ringing with me, but that is an opportunity I’m afforded when I go to The Wolery at times like this when I have the li’l chap in my company. He is always delighted to go there because it means a couple of hours playing with the Salter’s youngest Henry whilst I play on the bells at the top of his garden.\n\nThat wasn’t the only good thing about this morning’s peal of Seven Surprise Minor methods. It was Colin Salter’s first of seven Surprise, so well done him. But it also offered an unexpected bonus peal, finally taking me to 499 some seventeen days and two losses after getting number 498 at Rendham, and had partly come about through reading my blog, as the Salters read it, saw my predicament and came to my rescue yesterday! With a re-run of the Pettistree attempt booked in for tomorrow and the traditional New Year’s Eve peal of Grandsire at Grundisburgh lined up for Monday, it gives me back some breathing space as my year-long project to reach 500 by the end of the year reaches a tight climax. Thank you to the Salters.\n\nWe weren’t the only ones ringing peals in Suffolk today, and although the other two were rung for the Society of Stowmarket Youths, well done to Cherril and Jeremy Spiller on ringing their 600th together in the handbell peal at Bacton and Julian Colman on ringing his 150th in the success at Great Barton. And although not for the first time, it was nice to see another all-Scase quarter rung at Ashbocking.\n\nOnce reunited with Ruthie after work, we three were visited by bridesmaid and good friend Fergie, before we then met up with more of Ruthie’s former school friends Mark, Vicky and her boyfriend Gavin at The Duke of York in Woodbridge. All good fun and all with Mason accompanying us!\n\nTop\n\nThursday 27th December 2012\n\nI am very fortunate that I don’t have to return to work until next Wednesday, but sadly for Ruthie – and Mason and me as we’re deprived of her company – it was back to Boots at the depressingly early and dark hour of seven in the morning, particularly tough after so much merry-making with family over the last couple of days.\n\nThat said, on this occasion she was finished for the day four hours later, enabling her to join Mason and me in enjoying our Christmas presents, before we spent the afternoon at Kate’s whilst Pete did some computer business at hers.\n\nMeanwhile, whilst it was a shame that he couldn’t ring it at Grundisburgh after all, well done to Henry Pipe on ringing his first tower-bell peal a little closer to home, as he participated in a 5056 of Cambridge Major at Great St Mary in Cambridge.\n\nAlthough Mrs Munnings had to return to her employers briefly after a few hours at her mothers, we then sat in and relaxed for the evening, consuming left over party food and taking in a night of Agatha Christie TV. We are both very fortunate.\n\nTop\n\nBoxing Day 2012\n\nI usually wake up on Boxing Day feeling slightly subdued, partly due to a hangover, partly because all the sense of anticipation is replaced by a morning-after-the-night-before sensation.\n\nBut there was still much to look forward to today, as we started and finished the day with my family and took in a repeat visit to Ruthie’s grandparents in between.\n\nAll bar Aunty Marian present at last night’s festivities rose in Ashcroft Road this morning, and having imparted our gratitude and bade our farewells, we briefly returned to our abode to unload our presents before continuing on our journey to meet my wife’s family again. There were one or two missing from yesterday’s meal, but otherwise it was the same place, same time, same fantastic food and amusing company.\n\nIt was then our turn to host my family this evening, as our home resounded to the company of Aunty Marian, Mum, Dad, Chris and Becky joining Mason, Ruthie, me and Pete Faircloth as he tries to come to terms with Suzanne’s absence over the holiday season.\n\nIt went pretty well too, with crackers pulled, buffet consumed and the evening – once the sleeping elders had left – climaxing in an entertaining game of Articulate. I’m ready for that subdued feeling in the morning again...\n\nTop\n\nChristmas Day 2012\n\nAs time has gone on, I’ve grown to appreciate just how much Christmas Day offers a snapshot of how life changes but also stays very familiar.\n\nMy earliest memories of 25th December are of Christmas round Chez Ashcroft with Mum, Dad, Chris, Nanna and Granndad from the Munnings side (or Nanna and Granddad Green Door as my brother and I called them due to the colour of their front door in their residence in Beechcroft Road), Aunty Marian, Uncle Eric and his sister Sheila. She was a timid looking lady with a stutter dating back to a bomb blowing up half of her bedroom with her in it when she was a little girl in a raid during World War Two, but was also an avid Ipswich Town fan who would often come out with amusing footy banter, usually against our feathered friends up the A140, and with a mischievous grin on her face.\n\nSadly we have lost a large proportion of that original crowd that for a many years were essential to my Christmas experience, with my Godfather Uncle Eric sadly the most recent to leave us back in January. It felt strange not to have him sat in the corner on wrapping paper duty today.\n\nMore happily, new faces have joined the fun in recent years, as Ruthie and Mason have come into our lives, and today we were delighted to welcome Chris’ girlfriend Becky to her first experience of a Munnings' Christmas.\n\nBack in the day, morning ringing for us would be at St Mary-le-Tower, St Margaret and Sproughton, before returning home to what was then my home for the rest of the day.\n\nSMLT and the six at All Saints that I learnt to ring on still make up my Christmas Day ringing in a link to those days gone by, with the sorry sound of just four ringing out at St Margaret from the edge of Christchurch Park as I made my way into the former for good measure, but the later ringing at Suffolk’s heaviest twelve means that my wife and I now make a habit of grabbing a ring at Pettistree first, though another new introduction this year to our celebrations saw the new Mrs Munnings head to St Mary the Virgin in Woodbridge to sing in the choir for the 10am service, meaning she was unable to join me in the rest of my ringing today.\n\nFollowing our morning duties, we met up again to undertake a part of the day that has changed in the last thirty years, but has in itself now become a very traditional part of our celebrations since Ruthie and I first started going out – Christmas dinner at her grandparents, her large family and Ron. This in itself has changed over the last five years, with Clare moving up to Scotland but numerous children being introduced to the festivities, but one thing that hasn’t changed is the superb food, company and hospitality, so many thanks again to our hosts.\n\nApart from a brief trip to our mechanic Bob and his wife Roz to pick Mason up, the rest of the day took on a familiar tone, with a tremendous buffet at Mum and Dad’s, the dangerously tasty punch, the Christmas beers collected since September and the mammoth present opening session complete with more beers and new Ringing World Diary, as Ruthie and I enjoyed our first Christmas as husband and wife. Familiar and different, I wouldn’t have had it any other way.\n\nTop\n\nChristmas Eve 2012\n\nWhilst Christmas Day is the day I usually enjoy most in a year (though 11th August definitely gets that honour in 2012!), Christmas Eve is perhaps the most magical. All that anticipation and build-up is pretty much complete, and then it’s just a matter of enjoying the day and looking forward to tomorrow.\n\nEven going into work was a pleasant part of the day, despite feeling like the only people going in on this odd Monday of a hopefully relaxing and fun week. As is customary, we were generously released by John Catt at lunchtime, and the time we did spend there was taken up with listening to festive ditties on the radio, everyone excitedly imparting their plans for the next few days and the traditional raffle to pass on the gifts kindly sent to the company by friends, clients and associates undertaken, which this year saw me win a 2013 calendar featuring Kent churches and a rather tasty looking bottle of red wine. One final generous act for the year from our generous employers.\n\nNonetheless, it was nice finishing up another successful year in the office and heading out into the world to begin the festivities. That said, I couldn’t really begin anything until Ruthie finished work at 5.30pm, as a rather more hectic few days for my wife came to an exhausted end.\n\nOnce she was freed though, the fun could really start, as we two enjoyed a lovely evening of drinking, eating and catching up with friends, beginning with a couple of pints at The Mariner round the corner from home, as we drunk to the season with Mason’s Godparents Toby and Kala, and their respective other halves Amy and Nick.\n\nMeanwhile, Alex Rolph was ringing her 25th quarter, her sister Nicole her first inside on eight and father Ed his first on eight, all in the 1260 Bob Triples at Halesworth. Well done to the ringing members of the Rolph family and well done north of the border to the half-Suffolk band that helped continue a long-standing tradition by ringing the fifty-eighth consecutive Christmas Eve peal at Long Stratton.\n\nAfter our crimbo tipple, Kala and Nick headed off for a family Christmas in Felixstowe, our neighbours returned home to cook sausage rolls, and Mrs Munnings and I were collected by Kate and Ron to be taken to Pettistree, where carols in The Greyhound were followed by ringing for and attendance at Midnight Mass very nicely led by Wickham Market – where ringing has now resumed again after a period of silence to accommodate building work at the bottom of the tower – ringer Rob Rose, before returning to lay our weary, but happy heads down in readiness for the big day much anticipated.\n\nTop\n\nSunday 23rd December 2012\n\nThe weather didn’t feel very Christmassy today. We are fortunate not to have had the horrific floods that some elsewhere in the UK have had, though the effects of yesterday’s constant rainfall could be seen in the puddles and lakes covering many of our country lanes and sodden fields today. But it was quite mild. In fact, I’m sure the 13ºC we peaked at on this Christmas Eve Eve was warmer than some days over the supposed ‘summer’ of 2012.\n\nThat didn’t stop us feeling festive by the end of a day that started for Mason and me where it usually does on a Sunday morning, St Mary-le-Tower. In theory I could’ve stopped on for the ringing forty minutes later for the Crib Service as there was no ringing at Grundisburgh this morning. Indeed, if you have any ambitions to ring on Suffolk’s lightest twelve over the Christmas period, then you’re likely to be disappointed, as there is no ringing there on Tuesday for the big day or next Sunday. However, I had promised myself to a needy Ufford this morning and so that’s where my excitable five-year old son and I headed for next, before a relatively quiet afternoon of last minute shopping and taking lunch to a frazzled Ruthie at an increasingly busy Boots.\n\nThe afternoon was hectic for other ringers across the county, especially – unsurprisingly – for those with the surname Salter. Colin in particular made good use of the day, ringing his first blows in Stamford Surprise Minor in the peal at The Wolery, his first in the method in the 1260 of Grandsire Triples at Bardwell and his twenty-fifth quarter in the success at Great Livermere. Well done Colin and well done too to his older brother George for also ringing his first blows of Stamford, David Rogers on also ringing his first in the method with Colin at Bardwell and to Nathan Colman on ringing his first of Double Norwich in the 1280 at Stowmarket on a busy and productive day of ringing within our borders, which also saw quarters rung at Hasketon and Pettistree.\n\nOur day wasn’t over though. One of the nice things my wife and I have been able to do this year, is get more involved in life at St Mary the Virgin in Woodbridge, when work and ringing commitments have allowed. For the last couple of years, Mason and I – and Mrs Munnings when she’s been able – have been attending Sunday services on roughly a monthly basis in anticipation of our wedding here back in August, and since Ruthie has begun having every other Sunday off work she has been able to join the choir. It has been an absolute joy, and this evening our integration was highlighted by the parts we played in the church’s Nine Lessons and Carols. I read the second lesson of the service, Genesis, vv.15-18, and have to admit to be being slightly nervous at reading to a packed house that included Ruthie’s grandparents and various VIP’s of the town. It seems daft having spoken to Lesley Dolphin and an audience of thousands on Friday, but at least I couldn’t see them and they couldn’t see me!\n\nStill, my brief and vaguely coherent cameo was nothing compared to my talented missus, who sang as part of a quartet solo from the balcony and played the flute magnificently to Candlelight Carol – as her mother said, it’s amazing what she’d do to get out of singing Rutter! The bellingers did their bit too, by playing I Saw Three Ships and Good King Wenceslas on handbells on a night that of course climaxed with the spine-tingling (certainly with a congregation as large as tonight’s!) renditions of O Come, All Ye Faithful and Hark the Herald Angels, all observed by an impeccably behaved (mainly!) Mason.\n\nEither side it was all about bells, as beforehand Kate and I helped man the eight bells in a ringing chamber wonderfully decorated by the daughter of Peter, one of the local ringers (and sporting one of the most ingenious uses of a model bell!) and afterwards enjoyed some Frosty Bells in Ye Olde Bell & Steelyard down the hill with Kate and Ron, the spirit of Christmas well and truly ensconced in us, no matter what the weather!\n\nThis is my final blog entry that will be written and read before the big day, so it’s a good point to send out Christmas greetings from Mason, Ruthie and me, especially as yet again, our Christmas card distribution has been so hopeless! I got to read the latest edition of Awl a’huld today, and thought that Gordon Slack summed up perfectly what it means to be a bellringer at this time of year. Bells are an integral part of so many people’s view of the perfect Christmas. Watch almost any adaption of A Christmas Carol, and bells will be heard ringing out as Scrooge awakes a new man on Christmas Morning, and many will be drawn to church by the sound of our ringing as they look to get in touch with what the festival means to them. We are privileged to be able to do what we do, not just now but all through the year. So enjoy the ringing you do over this period, think about how much joy it will be giving many people and above all else, have a very, very Happy Christmas!\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 22nd December 2012\n\nAh, those Christmas traditions. Visiting relatives, using the postal system for the first time since last December, Brussels sprouts, panto, Christmas ringing on all of Ipswich’s ringable town centre bells, John Girt at said ringing event telling us we need to get our cars out of St Margaret School’s car-park before he leaves or we’ll get locked in for the weekend, and stuffing the turkey. Though don’t get those last two the wrong way round. You won’t be able to understand the bird, and John will be uncomfortable.\n\nMr Girt was amongst many people who deserved thanks and credit for helping make this year’s festive ringing in Suffolk’s county town so, so successful for the umpteenth year running, as along with his wife Shirley and fellow St Margaret’s ringer Angela Cable, they watered and fed us superbly with tea, coffee, biscuits and mince pies, in the church attached to their home tower, once the fifty-one bells of the town had been rung simultaneously.\n\nThanks also have to go to those who – like John G – generously allowed their bells to be rung and arranged access at St Clement, St Lawrence, St Mary at the Quay, St Mary-le-Tower, St Matthew, St Nicholas, St Stephen and our post-ringing hosts St Margaret, as well as all those who travelled into Ipswich on the last Saturday before the 25th and on the occasion of ITFC’s final home match of 2012. But most of all, well done and an immense thank you to Brian Redgers on organising and arranging what remains for me a real highlight of the ringing year. Knowing how hard it often is just to get six ringers together at the same place at the same time, I am constantly in awe at how year after year Brian gets more than enough to man all of Ipswich town centre’s ringable, full-circle bells, especially at this hectic time of year for us ringers. He has had some bad luck in the past with snow, shootings and occasionally key holders, so I’m always delighted when everything works out so perfectly! He, and all those mentioned above, deserved the praise lavished on them by South-East District Chairman/woman/person-elect Mary Garner.\n\nMason, Ruthie and I were at St Mary-le-Tower where some Grandsire Caters was sandwiched with two lots of nice Call-Changes on Twelve as many of the usuals were joined by Chris McArthur and one of his learners from Brandeston and Kettleburgh.\n\nBeforehand, we had snuck a very pleasant traditional visit to my wife’s Nan to drop presents, cards and season’s greetings to her, and a not-so-pleasant visit to Ipswich’s shops for some last minute Crimbo gift hunting.\n\nAfterwards, the li’l chap was willingly whisked off with his grandparents to take in another of those aforementioned festive traditions, the panto at The Regent, which this year is Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, the world’s smallest Surprise Major band.\n\nWith Ruthie also occupied with choir practice at St Mary’s once we returned to Woodbridge, I took this afternoon as the best opportunity to raid Tesco for some food for the Christmas period, particularly for our planned evening as hosts on Boxing Day. It seemed everyone else from the area agreed, including my workmate Pete and his wife Mel, as we battled through the huge crowds.\n\nOthers found a better use for the day though, most particularly Harry Garrod, who today rang his first quarter in the success at Bardwell, which also doubled up as Ruth Young’s fiftieth this year! Congratulations Ruth and very well done Harry! Who knows, it may be the start of a new Christmas tradition for him!\n\nTop\n\nFriday 21st December 2012\n\nAt 11.11am GMT today, the world was supposed to end. Not that those of us left in the office at work seemed overly concerned. As one said, “If it doesn’t happen, it isn’t the end of the world.”\n\nAnd indeed it wasn’t. The appointed time came and went, without so much as the flimsy fencing around the building site for a residential home opposite the office falling. It meant some of us were able to accept a festive invitation for mince pies and mulled wine at eduFOCUS, one of the other companies at the Deben Mill Business Centre, where I met Tony Pinfold, acquaintance of ringers such as the McBurnie’s and my mother-in-law! Mind you, who in the Woodbridge area doesn’t know Kate?\n\nA lack of Armageddon also allowed me to speak with Lesley Dolphin on Radio Suffolk about Saturday’s Christmas Ringing in Ipswich, pick Mason up after his last day at school and join him and Ruthie in heading to Pete Faircloth’s to celebrate his birthday with pie. Thanks Pete and Happy Birthday!\n\nIn the days leading up to our apparently certain doom, I missed Tim Stanford’s impressive feat in ringing his first quarter of Surprise in the 1296 of Cambridge Minor at Pettistree on Wednesday, apparently only the third or fourth time he’d rung a touch of Cambridge. Well done Tim!\n\nIndeed, well done all of us on surviving the latest date of destruction!\n\nTop\n\nThursday 20th December 2012\n\nDisappointingly, after much build up and anticipation, Grundisburgh practice was cancelled this evening, with the Pipes unable to make it and a number of others put off by what was admittedly a terrible evening.\n\nThe wind and rain didn’t stop those quarter-pealing at Chediston from ringing their first of Oxford Treble Bob Minor with a 1272 rung in forty-two minutes. Well done guys. The conditions didn’t stop Ruthie making it to choir practice and then us two wandering down to The Mariners, which was looking typically festive and where we were joined by Toby and Amy. It’s just a shame we didn’t get to go to Grundisburgh as well.\n\nTop\n\nWednesday 19th December 2012\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, my plans to ring my 500th peal before the end of the year were going well and looking good. Following the successful peal of Yorkshire Major at Hollesley less than a month ago, I had five to ring to get to the landmark, and seven peals arranged that I was booked into before 2012’s demise. Well six if you believe the world will end on Friday. I had room for error, I could afford a couple of losses.\n\nEven as recently as last Tuesday when we scored that brisk peal at Rendham - one of those seven peals already lost, but still with room to manoeuvre - I still felt confident. The days since then, haven’t been good for my aims. The peal lost at Pettistree on Saturday still left me with two peals from two to score before the end of New Year’s Eve, but I was aware that going into this evening’s attempt of London Major at Ardleigh in Essex that we needed to get it. Sadly, we never really got going and the peal was lost in a big heap. The omens were perhaps not great. Alex Tatlow, who was in the band and was still searching for his first in the method, had seven losses in it to his name. And the peal itself had already suffered a number of setbacks before we even crossed south of the border. It was originally booked in at Henley, before a service was arranged for 8.30pm. With it being unlikely that we’d get started before 6pm, even I wouldn’t guarantee getting a peal of Surprise Major round in that space of time, so it was moved to St Mary-le-Tower, where it promptly came to our attention that The Evening Star would be holding their Carol Service there this evening, prompting Stephen Cheek’s very kind offer of the bells at St Mary the Virgin.\n\nThat said, we started well enough, but with something like London, you are rarely far away from a potential collapse. At least on this occasion, it was only half-an-hour in, but this of course opened the door for an attempt at a quarter, which went much the same way as the peal, though an injury to one of the band members finished it perhaps slightly earlier than it would’ve gone.\n\nAs I contemplated where, when and how I was going to fit another peal in over the next twelve days, we consoled ourselves with a pint at The Sun in Dedham. It is a lovely pub, particularly the side room, the walls paneled with wood, the lighting dimmed and at this time of year the Christmas tree sitting in the window – I could just imagine Hercule Poirot wandering in!\n\nAnd at least whilst we were losing our attempt, there was a peal rung elsewhere for the Guild, as Clare Veal and Colin Salter rang their first peal of Little Bob in the 5040 at The Wolery, an attempt which saw Colin’s older brother George ring his 75th in total. Well done to all three of you!\n\nOne time I shan’t be able to pick an extra peal up, is Saturday morning, when Brian Redgers’ brilliantly organized ringing round Ipswich will be on, with all ringers welcome. To help publicize this wonderful event to the public, I shall be on Radio Suffolk talking to Lesley Dolphin at about 1.40pm on Friday, so listen out for that.\n\nMeanwhile, I shall return to trying to arrange another peal…\n\nTop\n\nTuesday 18th December 2012\n\nBy the nature of the beast, things get quiet in the sales team during the last full week before Christmas. After all, we predominantly work with independent schools and most of them were closed for the festive holidays by last Friday, with some even shut down the Friday before. Indeed, most companies wind down slowly this week, with people taking early holiday and few major decisions taken, and in turn, so do we, with our last day at work until the New Year being next Monday.\n\nUsually, we are reduced to tidying up desks, shredding, or moving desks. This year, we’ve decided to box a little cleverer and use the time more productively, so this afternoon we found ourselves in a meeting room at Woodbridge Library – which was encouragingly busy - doing some sales training. It was quite dry, especially when I looked at the clock and considered what – God willing – I should be doing in exactly a week’s time, but it was useful and it did help pass another of those dull afternoons that this week normally throws up.\n\nEarlier, we had a visit from Lewis the plumber to replace our faulty kitchen taps, more than a little bit of a relief with our kitchen in use big time on Boxing Day. So tonight we enjoyed a quiet evening at home of cheese and biscuits, hanging our Christmas cards up, and watching festive TV, as well as using our taps lots!\n\nTop\n\nMonday 17th December 2012\n\nWith next Monday being Christmas Eve and the following New Year’s Eve, tonight saw the last St Mary-le-Tower practice of the year, and it is interesting to look at my blog on the last practice of last year, as it shows that progress has been made. 19th December 2011 was the culmination of a year of Monday evenings that had seen us push on our ten-bell repertoire, and we were disappointed a year ago not to have been able to ring London Royal (No.3) very well, but there were hopes expressed of moving into more twelve-bell ringing.\n\nFast forward to tonight, and it is clear that David has been successful in his aims for ringing at SMLT. Looking back, a lower attendance to the norm seems to be a pattern of the last practices before Christmas and New Year, and tonight was no different, so we were unable to ring the Superlative Max which has increasingly become the norm, but London Royal was rung – at least at the second attempt – very well, and we finished the year of practices with a decently rung touch of Stedman Cinques. The way we ring Stedman has been a particularly satisfactory aspect of our ringing in 2012. Stedman more than any other highlights a band’s attitude and levels of concentration. It doesn’t take much to learn Stedman per se. It is double-dodging from 4-5 above, and either quick or slow front work, on any number, bar singles of course. But with no treble ringing a set path and coursing order thrown about a bit more than in standard methods, it takes immense concentration, particularly on higher numbers. At the beginning of this year, we seemed not to have the ability to concentrate and we couldn’t even get through a plain course without a mistake on one occasion. It didn’t say much clever about us.\n\nEncouragingly now, we have moved on. Touches of Stedman Cinques – like tonight’s – represent little problem to us, even on a night where some ringers are missing. And when we get it right, it produces some marvelous striking. It all excites me greatly as I consider the prospects for Suffolk’s heaviest twelve in 2013. Keep up the good work David!\n\nAnd keep up the good work at Lavenham! As most will be aware, this grand eight in its imposing but spectacular ringing chamber, has a strong ringing tradition, so I was delighted to see that the first quarter-peal by a Sunday service band from SS Peter & Paul for ten years was rung there today. Well done and congratulations guys.\n\nAfter such an achievement, they would’ve been well within their rights to pop to the local afterwards, and we felt the same about ours, so of course we ended up in The Cricketers, as we reflected on the fact that there is still ringing to be done at SMLT before 31st December. Wednesday at 7pm sees the Evening Star hold their Carol Service at the church, and there will be ringing half-an-hour beforehand if anyone can and would like to help out. A bit harder to man will be ringing from 10.10-10.30am on Sunday for the Crib Service, as I’m aware a lot of people will be ringing at their own towers then, but if you are about, David would be delighted to see you, as he would be if you can help out with ringing for the Carol Service, from 6-7pm on Christmas Eve. And if you have intentions on coming along on the big day itself next Tuesday, ringing will be later than it usually is on a Sunday morning, running from 9.45-10.30am.\n\nOf course most people reading this won’t be able to join us, but it does highlight the busy and different nature of this time of year at most churches, with extra services and changes from usual times, so please do check with your local tower and help where you can. And regardless of how 2012 has gone for your tower, set yourselves some targets and make 2013 a year of progress.\n\nTop\n\nSunday 16th December 2012\n\nThe majority of people seem to be into the swing of the pre-Christmas period that is so enjoyable. Driving through the darkness of Suffolk’s countryside at the moment, the black is punctuated across the landscape by random displays of multi-coloured lights, the warmness of the season seemingly being enjoyed in isolated country dwellings, reassuringly.\n\nThough not exactly isolated in the suburbs of Woodbridge, Kate decided this afternoon to add her abode to the display, so we were invited round for Mason to help decorate her tree. As with helping with ours, it was lovely to see the li’l chap with a big smile on his face, hanging baubles, snowmen and characters from Winnie the Pooh as far up as he could reach.\n\nHe was already in a very good mood, having been to the sixth birthday of his schoolmate Samuel, held – as most celebrations seem to be – at St Audrys Sports and Social Club on the outskirts of Melton, where fairground games had been set up, allowing the li’l chap’s ingenuity to flourish. The first game he came across was trying to hook a duck out of a paddling pool. Having been told a prize would be awarded for hooking out the one with the number six written on the bottom, he promptly picked them all up until he found said duck, held onto to it trying to hook the stick to it, before giving up, waving it at the lady manning the stall, and amazingly being given a prize! Sometimes I’m not sure whether to be proud or embarrassed…\n\nI left him to it whilst I rejoined Ruthie, her mother and Ron for a splendid roast lamb dinner – thanks Kate – before picking him up in readiness for our afternoon of festiveness. Preceding all of this was a morning in church at St Mary the Virgin in Woodbridge, with my wife in the choir and me helping make up eight in the ringing chamber. The ringing got better and some very respectable rounds were produced to ring another large congregation in, a congregation which was treated to a presentation by a lady from the Salvation Army and a copy of the East Anglican, which this month gives bellringing a star billing on its front cover, with a brilliant article on the simulator at Helmingham on page five. It’s great PR for ringing in a magazine that will go to the people we’re still most likely to recruit from, and even ringer Peter Lucas from Gislingham gets in on the act opposite the Helmingham story, though he is photographed standing next to a toilet. Probably best to actually read the magazine.\n\nAnd whilst we missed ringing at St Mary-le-Tower this morning to go to church, we were at SMLT this evening for the last special practice there of 2012, where extensive practice was done of Superlative Maximus. Whilst not our best ringing, it should serve as a useful session, topped by a well-struck touch of Little Bob Max before we three returned to a much warmer home.\n\nMeanwhile, as we were doing all of the above, other ringers were busy in ringing chambers across the county, not least at Great Barton where Clare Veal and David Howe rang their most Surprise Minor methods and their first of Bourne and Caithness in the 5040 at Holy Innocents. Well done guys, and well done to Pete Faircloth who rang his first quarter of Yorkshire Major in the success at Ufford, no doubt imbibed with the Christmas spirit (happy chappy that he is!) by my mother-in-law, now she has her decorations up!\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 15th December 2012\n\nWe awoke to the continuing sound of running water, but thankfully nothing worse. We had a busy morning ahead, as I needed to pick Mason up from his mother’s and take him to Mum and Dad’s, who were very kindly looking after him whilst Ruthie and I rang in the annual mid-December Pettistree peal attempt. Part of me considered pulling out to get our tap problem fixed, but that would’ve been unfair at such short notice to the others in the band, however understanding they might have been of our circumstances, so instead Ron very, very kindly popped round – thanks Ron - whilst we were out to see if he could find any solutions. Try as he might, he couldn’t, so straight after ringing, I was on the phone to the letting agents and Lewis the plumber – an extremely friendly and likeable chap as it turned out – was on his way to ours.\n\nIn many respects, his visit was reassuring, as he struggled as much as we and Ron had to stem the flow, but it also identified the many problems with our plumbing, which will need sorting out. He at least managed to stop the tap running (though I’m not sure even he knew how!) after over twelve hours of it going, but we have no water in the kitchen until at least Monday when he hopes to return with a replacement tap. With the heating having been off all day, and a pile of washing-up we were unable to attack, Kate very kindly fed and accommodated we three tonight, but not before we had popped into Ipswich town centre for some more Christmas shopping and then paid Aunty Marian a visit.\n\nWe were particularly keen to do the latter, as today would’ve been Uncle Eric’s 85th birthday, but is sadly the first since his passing at the beginning of the year. We have missed him ever since of course, especially when he would’ve had a lot to say on the goings on at Ipswich Town, and obviously with his absence at our wedding, an event he would have reveled in. But starting with his birthday today, there will be a number of occasions over the next few weeks when we will particularly reflect upon him not being around, with our first Christmas without him and then the anniversary of his death in just over a month. Unfortunately with all our plumbing problems taking up more time than we would’ve care for, and darkness falling as we left the cosy home of my father’s sister, we had to abandon a visit to him in Ipswich Cemetery, but Happy Birthday Uncle Eric.\n\nThe peal attempt earlier in the day in amongst our other problems, is an unfortunate tale, as just a couple of weeks or so after losing a peal just minutes from the end due to a miscall, the same happened here, this time 2hrs15mins into a peal that would probably have come round in about 2hrs35-40mins. Whilst unlucky to have been struck by such misfortune twice in a short period, these things happen. It was difficult composition of 8-Spliced Surprise Minor which had been rung well and called brilliantly up to that point. And besides, if we scored them all, there would be no real achievement in the ones we do get.\n\nSo well done those who did score today, at least in quarter-peals, and particularly Neal Dodge who not only rang his first quarter of Plain Bob Minor in the 1260 at Polstead, but also his first of Major in the success at Boxford. Well done Neal, congratulations Maggie Ross on circling Halesworth to quarters three times, and although having no Suffolk connections at all – as far as I’m aware – very well done to the band which rang a handbell peal of Bob Minor in Dunstable on Thursday, as it was the first peal for ALL of them! Quite a feat, though I bet they’re glad they didn’t have to sit next to a constantly running tap the whole way through!\n\nTop\n\nFriday 14th December 2012\n\nWhat do you say to a famous person when you meet them? Not famous like Robert Beavis, but properly famous, or at least famous to most who have a TV.\n\nTonight, Kate, Ruthie and I met Alan Davies, the comedian and actor who appears on QI, my wife’s favourite show by far, which ironically we missed a new episode of to see the funny man’s show at The Regent in Ipswich this evening. Having done the show, he then signed autographs afterwards, so we queued with Scott from work who had also attended, eventually coming face-to-face with the star. A blurred photo taken by one of the attendants and the moment came to part with words of wisdom, words he would obviously remember for life. ‘Thank you Alan, and get some sleep.’\n\nIt was all I could think of to say, and to be fair he seemed to appreciate the sentiment as he smiled tiredly back and nodded gently. After all, he looked shattered, and perhaps understandably so, as bar a couple of randomly placed dates in February, this was the penultimate gig of a tour that started back in September, taking him across the UK. No doubt he’s been paid handsomely for it, and unlike most of us he can afford a couple of months break following his show in Brighton on Sunday, but a look at his tour schedule was enough to make me feel exhausted.\n\nMind you, that exhaustion may have had as much to do with a day of eating and drinking, as with typical generosity, John Catt Educational took all its employees out for its Christmas meal today. Like last year, we were at The Crown in Woodbridge, where the food and drink was great. I couldn’t resist getting into the festive spirit and having turkey, and sandwiched it with a terrine and a pannacotta (not literally you understand), but as nice as it all was, it was time spent with friends that was so enjoyable about this afternoon, and this carried on into The Anchor nearby once we’d finished, by which point Ruthie had joined me for an evening that was to be quite superb.\n\nWhilst we were enjoying comedy from sleepy stand-ups, Tim Stanford was ringing his first quarter on eight in the 1296 of Bob Major at Rendham. Since picking up ringing more regularly in the last couple of months, Tim has been a joy to ring with, keen, enthusiastic and popping up everywhere, and as a result, his progress has been really good. He is a great example of why it is worth persevering with young ringers, because even if they do give up – as many do when other ‘cooler’ things come along – they will still have a good grounding if and when circumstances bring them back to ringing. Well done Tim.\n\nSo a good night all round. That was until I made the ‘mistake’ of turning the hot water tap on in the kitchen when we finally got home. Because it wouldn’t turn off. And the stopcocks wouldn’t budge. We didn’t seem to have a number supplied by our letting agents for a plumber, and being 11.30pm, we couldn’t get a number. Unless we wanted to cancel Christmas, we weren’t prepared to call a random plumber out at that time, and we didn’t want to disturb any friends who might be able to help that late either. So with everything running freely and unlikely to flood, we left it going, the lesser of two evils, but still not ideal for a good night’s sleep. I just hope Alan Davies got a good night in.\n\nTop\n\nThursday 13th December 2012\n\nSome hit-and-miss Bristol, a decent initial attempt at London and some well-rung courses of Cambridge and Yorkshire, made up the last Surprise Major Practice at Ufford of the year. We were definitely helped by the later arrival of Ruthie and Kate as my mother-in-law picked up my wife from choir practice, but before and after their arrival, it was a typically useful and focused session. Mike is to be congratulated on running these practices so well, and Kate thanked for the use of the bells, and I certainly feel there has been progress made over 2012.\n\nOur presence at the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary of course meant we couldn’t make Grundisburgh practice tonight. Unsurprisingly – even considering the recent upturn – there was no practice at the county’s lightest twelve this evening anyway though. However, there will be next week, as four of the most famous ringers on the planet come to the village, with David and Cecilia Pipe bringing their talented sons Henry and Alfie. David Pipe is of course one of the best – if not the best – ringers in the history of the art, and although her achievements seem modest in comparison (whose wouldn’t?!), Mrs Pipe is an outstanding ringer in her own right. And of course the two boys have made headlines in recent years as first Henry and then Alfie became the youngest to ever ring a quarter-peal, and HJWP rang his first peal at the tender age of seven years old, two-and-a-half years ago. Now at the veteran age of nine, he has since rung five further peals, all - rather impressively – on hand-bells. In exactly two weeks time though, he will attempt his first ever peal on tower-bells, and Grundisburgh has been chosen as the venue.\n\nNow, on the face of it, much-maligned, l’il ol’ Grundisburgh may seem an odd place for such a momentous moment in an already famous ringing career, but it is rather appropriate actually. Henry’s great-grandfather Cecil ‘Jim’ Pipe was born and brought up in the neighbouring village of Hasketon, and was tower captain for many years at St Mary the Virgin. His son, and the young boys’ grandfather Rod – who raised the bar to what many thought was an impossible height to jump, and who we sadly lost last year – learnt to ring in the red brick tower. Although born and raised in the West Midlands, their Ipswich-Town-supporting father David has a great affinity with Suffolk and a peal board above the entrance into the ringing chamber, records that at the age of eleven he rang his first peal of Double Norwich Major - and indeed only his second peal altogether – on the back eight of what was then a ten.\n\nHowever, when approached about having the bells for this historic attempt, Stephen Pettman sensibly suggested that they pop over from Cambridge for a practice, before throwing a nine-year old onto bells that many bigger and more experienced ringers have struggled on, so next Thursday evening is that opportunity. So do come over and help if you can. Apart from being a chance to get another practice going, and hopefully in the long-run contribute to them getting up-and-running more permanently, it will be great to meet up with this wonderful family and for some of us to indirectly help the ringing career of a young chap, who may very well take ringing onto the next level.\n\nWhilst maybe the most famous, Henry isn’t the only young ringer making progress in our ancient art, and indeed closer to home we saw evidence of that today, as fourteen-year-old Hannah Stokes rang her first quarter at the first attempt in the success at Worlingham. Well done Hannah and ‘well done’ to the band who rang their first of Minimus in the 1272 at Stowlangtoft. And that’s all you can ask for in ringing. Keep trying new things, whether you’re a nine-year-old about to attempt your first tower-bell peal, a fourteen-year old ringing your first 1260, a seasoned band of quarter-peal ringers ringing their first of Minimus, or us lot trying to improve our Surprise Major.\n\nTop\n\nWednesday 12th December 2012\n\nIf I have the opportunity to read this blog on New Year’s Day, 2101, two things in particular will impress – no, amaze – me. One is the thought that my lifespan will have overlapped not just those whose own lives have crossed with people from as far back as the 1800’s and even the end of the 1700’s, but also with people whose lives will cross with those who will be tasked with taking humanity into the 23rd and even 24th centuries.\n\nMost amazingly is that I would be 122 years old, a victory for those of us who ignore the latest health advice telling us that everything we’re doing will kill us (as if we’re going to live forever if we listen to them), over those who obsess about their health and yet are just as likely to be knocked down by a bus tomorrow as anyone. I’m struck by the fact that each report of a centenarian revealing the secret of their long life is a glass of whisky and twenty fags every day since their fourteenth birthday, is generally balanced out by a tragic tale of a teetotal, fitness fanatic collapsing in their forties. So enjoy life, and if you’re reading this on you’re hover screen in just over eighty-eight years time future me, well done – but sort your eyebrows out!\n\nWhether I make the first day of the first month of 2101 or not, today is the last day until then when the date, month and year are the same (12/12/12 for those who haven’t worked it out yet), prompting an unusual number of weddings for a Wednesday in December, and a media rush to find out about babies who had been born at 12.12 today. However, as special and interesting as that all is, it wasn’t the most special and interesting thing about today for me.\n\nRather, the special part of my day came with a trip to Mason’s school to watch him perform in their Christmas production, Whoops-a-Daisy Angel, the telling of the nativity story through the eyes of a clumsy angel. The li’l chap performed his role as a snowflake, blown around by the wind to perfection, and the whole performance was sweet, spine-tingling festive magic at its very best, and as usual I was grateful to work for letting me out to watch it.\n\nThe interesting part of the day for Ruthie and me came after work, firstly in the pre-practice quarter at Pettistree, which saw us participate in a very well rung 1272 of Cambridge, Ipswich, Primrose, Norfolk, Norwich, Hull, Bourne and York Surprise Minor, and was also Mary Garner’s 100th this year – well done Mary! It was very enjoyable, but with nothing in the cupboard at home after a busy couple of evenings, and no time before the quarter to grab anything, we left SS Peter & Paul temporarily in search of food. We had intended to pop to the chippy in neighbouring Wickham Market, but with conditions again very icy and new people in The Greyhound, we decided instead to pop into the pub just yards from the church, rather than getting into the car again.\n\nThe new people running it are a nice couple called Stuart and Louise, who have come – in what must be a very daunting move for them – down from Scotland to replace Karen and Tony. It certainly seems quieter without Karen in particular, but then anyone coming in would probably have struggled with that! And they have changed the atmosphere a little too, with the pub lit simply by candlelight, a nice touch in my opinion. The food was nice too, though a little on the sparse side for my liking, and already they seem to be getting on with the locals, which is a good sign for the future.\n\nThey certainly didn’t put us off returning after the practice for a drink, by which time we had consumed much cake and chocolate on offer for Mrs Roger’s birthday, her grandson Alex continued his progress under my wife’s watchful eye and Tim Stanford rang inside to a touch of Cambridge Minor for the first time with some aplomb. It was nice too to see Bill again after his recent marriage, as well as James Whitby who paid us a visit and even rang down with us, on a night where elsewhere Colin Salter was once more achieving on the end of a rope. This time it was at home, as he rang his most methods to a peal in the success at The Wolery – well done Colin!\n\nThere is also good news from Beccles, where ringing has started up again after a few weeks out of action, which is great to hear. Hopefully the work done will keep them going until 01/01/2101 at least!\n\nTop\n\nTuesday 11th December 2012\n\nOn a freezing evening like this, at this time of year, our county’s village pubs are – in my humble opinion – at their very best. One such example is The White Horse in Rendham, the delightful village which hugs a corner along the main road between Saxmundham and Framlingham in deepest rural Suffolk, where Ruthie and I found ourselves tonight. In front of a roaring fire, tinsel adorning the walls and timber beams, old photos of the Home Guards of Sweffling & Rendham and the 8th Suffolk Battalion and the 1949 pub dominoes ‘final’ featuring characters with such wonderful names as Ringler Tye and Roy Churchyard, and a pint of Earl Soham Vic each in our hands, the cold outside felt a very long way away!\n\nWe also felt we’d earned it, having rung peal number 498 immediately across the road at St Michael beforehand, a feeling further vindicated by the positive remarks we received from the locals in the pub afterwards. Despite the entrance of the choir for practice partway through – which we had been forewarned about, and actually created a lovely sense of activity on a night when so many will no doubt have been cowering in their homes - the peal itself was a brisk and well rung effort, especially by young Colin Salter who was ringing his first of Yorkshire. Well done Colin, and thank you to the band for coming out on such a cold night to help me, and particularly to Jonathan Stevens and John Tesh for arranging for the bells to be available.\n\nHaving had a slippery exit from Sweffling in the car, we opted to take the main roads back, warmed by our experiences this evening on an icy night. We are very lucky in this part of the world.\n\nTop\n\nMonday 10th December 2012\n\nThe decorations are now up at work and the Christmas card ‘filing box’ is out at St Mary-le-Tower, where a decent practice was climaxed with a couple of leads of Superlative Max and topped off with a drink in The Cricketers.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s plenty to occupy ringers this week, with the North-East District Beyond Plain Bob Minor Practice at Worlingham and Midweek Ringers going to Henley and Offton, all happening tomorrow, and the Bacton Monthly Practice running on Wednesday night, before the week is topped off with the South-West District Carol Service at All Saints in Sudbury. It’s all beginning to feel very festive.\n\nTop\n\nSunday 9th December 2012\n\nI’ve mentioned once or twice before, that we in Suffolk struggle to get resident bands for peals of Surprise Maximus. We’re not alone, as Essex has a similar predicament. Every now and again, we like to join forces to meet our aims, so this afternoon, I parked up outside the Pipe’s abode in Ipswich and tagged along with them and David Potts for a lift to such an attempt at Chelmsford Cathedral.\n\nThe original plan had been to go for a peal of Jubilee Surprise Maximus, as we near the end of this most celebrated of years. However, a recent car accident involving Philip Wilding who was due to have rung in the attempt, put paid to ringing this out-of-the-ordinary method at short notice, though ultimately we were all more relieved to hear that Phil had come out of what was apparently quite a serious crash, with nothing worse than an injured shoulder. Our wishes go out to this popular and superb ringer.\n\nIn his absence and with Diana very kindly standing in, we changed the method to the more familiar Cambridge Max, and despite the indistinct sound of the finest Warner twelve in the world and the huge organ immediately below us practically obliterating the sound of our ringing throughout most of the fifth and sixth courses, we produced a decent 3hrs25mins - which we also rang for the sad passing of Jack Dear from Hertfordshire today, a man well known to many in our Guild, some of whom attended his recent 90th birthday celebrations - before eventually ringing a nice touch of Stedman Cinques for evensong.\n\nPredictably and understandably, most headed onto the pub, but David wanted to be back in time to put his Christmas tree up and I was keen to get back to Woodbridge to meet up with Mason again, who had very kindly been taken to see Thomas the Tank Engine and his friends near Colchester, as well as Father Christmas, by Kate and Ron. As if that wasn’t generous enough, they then fed me, the li’l chap and Ruthie who had by then finished work – thank you very much guys! We made our way home past the typically impressive display in Warwick Avenue, as a very satisfactory day drew to an end.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mason and I had rung at St Mary-le-Tower, and then given George Salter a lift to Grundisburgh to collect the keys in readiness for this afternoon’s peal of Freasley Surprise Major. And they weren’t the only successful peal-ringers in the county today, with a notable 5040 rung at Brandon which also saw David Rogers ring his most methods to a peal. Well done David.\n\nAnd well done Josephine Beever on ringing her fiftieth quarter in 2012 with the 1260 of Grandsire Doubles at Great Finborough. There was also a nice footnote for Peter and Wendie Summers at The Norman Tower, as they rang their first quarter together for thirty years! For all our difficulties in getting resident ringers for peals on twelve within our borders, it’s great to see that we still have plenty of ringing talent in the Guild achieving!\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 8th December\n\nChristmas shopping in Ipswich. We try to avoid it if we can, but having awoken at Mum and Dad’s and left them to depart to Northamptonshire for the weekend, we felt we ought to make the effort anyway.\n\nIt turned out exactly as we expected – crowded, cold and frustrating and the main town Christmas ‘tree’ that I was so impressed with when lit up was disappointing in the daylight, exposed as an ugly metal sculpture. Still, presents were purchased, so I suppose we can count that as mission accomplished.\n\nExhausted from that, and last night catching up on Ruthie, me and Mason (who had had his school’s disco before we went out last night), our afternoon consisted of much laying about, our slumber only lifted briefly as we wrapped presents and listened to Ipswich Town beating Millwall 3-0.\n\nThankfully, other ringers were more active in Suffolk today, with peals and quarters rung across the county, most notably at Great Finborough where Clare Veal rang her 25th quarter. Well done Clare, I’m sure you were having more fun then we were this morning!\n\nTop\n\nFriday 7th December 2012\n\nWhen I was living in my little pink cottage in Tunstall, I put a touring quarter-peal band up for the night, consisting of the likes of Tim Palmer, Dave Matthews and Simon Webb amongst others who I had got to know during my time in Birmingham. I’d joined in with a quarter at Grundisburgh, but during the evening we went to A Passage to India in Fore Street, Ipswich for a curry. Somewhere along the line, it seemed a good idea for some of us to have a phall. For those not entirely familiar with curry lingo, the phall is pretty much the hottest curry you can get from your average Indian restaurant, a sort of nuclear curry designed to burn your insides.\n\nPredictably, it was an uncomfortable experience and I couldn’t finish mine. Mr Matthews admitted to having an out-of-body experience. And it was lucky it was July and hot (when summers used to be hot), as an awful lot of windows needed opening. Curiously, I couldn’t stop humming a certain Johnny Cash song.\n\nTonight, I returned to the scene of that excruciatingly hot meal for the first time since that night, this time with Ruthie of course and for the second annual St Mary-le-Tower Christmas Curry. As with last year, we all started in The Cricketers, drinking festively named pints like Elf Esteem, which in couple of months time will probably be called Valentine’s Arrow and then Easter Bunny. Unlike last year though, we were missing a couple as Ian Culham was unable to get back from Leeds where he’d been for work and our esteemed leader David Potts, also due to work.\n\nStill, the rest of us made a good night of it, before Jed and Rowan very kindly gave us a lift to the bottom of Ashcroft Road where we were being put up (with) for the night, and where Mum and Dad were very kindly looking after Mason. Thank you guys!\n\nMeanwhile, well done to Tracey Scase on ringing her first quarter of Norwich Minor in the success at Earl Stonham today. I know a good curry house where you can celebrate Tracey, just be careful not to order the phall!\n\nTop\n\nThursday 6th December 2012\n\nRuthie was at choir practice and there was no Grundisburgh practice, so a rather normal, if slightly dull Thursday evening.\n\nHowever, not so for others! Well done to Glenys Fear, Ray Lewis and Anne Buswell on ringing their first quarter of Stedman Doubles in the successful 1260 at Campsea Ashe today.\n\nTop\n\nWednesday 5th December 2012\n\nThe first snow of this winter in this area fell today. As pretty as it is, experience worries me as I aim to gobble up those remaining peals that I need to ring in the next twenty-six days, as I continue to aim to get to five hundred by the end of 2012.\n\nStill, despite the soon-to-be-described-as-treacherous conditions today, I managed to knock one off tonight as we finally scored in a peal of Ewen Surprise Major at The Wolery, that we would’ve rung last month if I’d read my emails properly. It wasn’t our best, as we shivered in the shed in hats, coats and gloves, and Tom discovered part-way through that he’d stepped in something rather unpleasant, but there was some decent ringing over the 1hr46mins and it leaves me with just four more to get to reach the magic number.\n\nIt also transpired to be the 200th on the bells, so following the usual copious amounts of tea, cake and biscuits, the band posed for photos before we made our way back home in that winter wonderland.\n\nTop\n\nTuesday 4th December 2012\n\nA brass band belted out festive favourites beside the trolleys at Tesco, and Fairytale of New York playing on the radio on the journey home. We seem well and truly in the midst of the season, and with that in mind, it seems a good time to remind folk of Saturday’s ringing events with a seasonal theme. In the morning you can attend the North-West District Christmas Social at Buxhall, and then travel across our beautiful county to Benhall for the 4pm North-East District Carol Service.\n\nSadly, one thing you shan’t be able to do on Wednesday night, is go to the North-East District Ten-Bell Practice, as the third at Beccles has not been re-installed yet. So no Ding-Dong Merrily On High there this week.\n\nHowever, congratulations this evening to Caroline Bass on ringing her first quarter inside, achieved in the 1260 of Plain Bob Triples at Offton. Once in Royal Brian’s City…\n\nTop\n\nMonday 3rd December 2012\n\nSo we have a royal birth to anticipate. If all goes to plan, it will mean another summer of celebration, as the Royal Family continues giving us reasons to ring peals!\n\nTherefore, we began practicing ringing for the big event at St Mary-le-Tower this evening. Not that it was our best ringing. Little Bob Max took two courses to produce considered striking, but did indeed improve, London Royal (No.3) was again rung well off the cuff, and Stedman Cinques was reasonably decent and good practice for George Salter, who generally applied himself well.\n\nWhilst most headed to The Cricketers, Ruthie and I took up an invitation to visit neighbours Toby and Amy to catch up and watch TV that wasn’t just about a certain pregnancy!\n\nTop\n\nSunday 2nd December 2012\n\nYesterday was good fun, but today was the one that Mason in particular has really been looking forward since we told him about this trip on Friday night.\n\nIt began with a legacy of yesterday’s trip to the scene of the Battle of Hastings, as following breakfast, the li’l chap and I stood on the frosty lawn out the front of the Claverton Country House Hotel, testing his newly acquired bow and ‘arrows’, before the real fun began.\n\nPassing some Sunday morning ringing at the 7cwt six at Bodiam, our destination was the Kent and East Sussex Railway, a familiar location to all five of us, as it was here that Kate had been taken to drive a steam engine, as part of a birthday surprise arranged by Ron and her two daughters a couple of years ago, and where we had also taken the boy for a Thomas the Tank Engine Day. On this occasion though, it was to amalgamate two of Mason’s favourite things – steam trains and Father Christmas!\n\nFrom rides on the merry-go-round at Tenterden, to the actual journey on the train where Santa gave the li’l chap a present of a Star Wars jigsaw, something that kept us all occupied on the return train journey in between munching mince pies and sipping port!\n\nEventually though, it all came to an end. A quick bite to eat and we were homeward bound, Mason zonked out almost before we’d left the car-park! Thank you to Kate and Ron for a wonderful weekend.\n\nI returned home to a couple of emails, referring to events marking the contributions of two Suffolk-born men, which are both taking place on the same weekend at the end of NEXT year! Of all the weekends currently free in 2013, it seems a shame that two very worthwhile occasions are to be marked over the same weekend of 12th/13th October, but that is often how bellringing goes!\n\nThe first one to draw your attention to is the Rod Pipe Commemoration Week End in Birmingham, to mark the contribution of the great man we lost last year, and who of course was born, grew up and learnt to ring in Suffolk. There are various, yet unspecified, ringing opportunities in the central occasion being a reception and buffet at the Council House, a superb location for such an occasion and home to all the Henry Johnson Dinners I went to. If you’re not going to the North-West District ADM on the same Saturday, then I would certainly recommend going along, and it would be good to get some noticeable representation from his home county.\n\nThe second is in regards to Philip Broke, who was born in Nacton and educated at Ipswich School, and captained the HMS Shannon which captured the USS Chesapeake, an apparently significant moment in the War of 1812 (which actually ran until 1815) on 1st June 1813. Strangely, the bicentenary is being celebrated on the above October date rather than the earlier mid-summer date, but there will be significant celebrations on Ipswich waterfront nonetheless and via Jonathan Williamson, we’ve been asked by Tim Voelcker, former owner of Wines of Interest in Ipswich, keen studier of maritime history and even author of maritime-related writing, if we can do something to mark the occasion in October and possibly in June. I have to admit to not knowing about the history behind this until I swotted up on it today, and it is early days yet, but if you are unable to get to Birmingham, it is worth marking this in your diary, as it could be a very good PR opportunity for the Guild. Watch this space!\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 1st December 2012\n\nMason is at that age when he is soaking up those details which most of us don’t remember not knowing about. A few months ago it was Africa and the animals that live there, where it is, etc. Recently it has been London, learning about the sites, many of which he was familiar with already, through his Cars 2 video game (which takes you on a race through the streets of our capital) and our visit to the big smoke a few months back. I was impressed when by merely seeing a picture of the Houses of Parliament a couple of weeks back, that he was able to reference the gunpowder plot and what it was all about. Currently he is on the Great Plague and the Great Fire of London, and can tell you dates and that the latter started in Pudding Lane. No doubt, in the very near future, he will begin learning about the Norman Conquest, the Battle of Hastings, 1066 and all that, but today we gave him a head start and took him straight to where it all happened.\n\nOne of the most famous battles of this country’s history took place on an otherwise nondescript field next to Battle Abbey and town, built up in the years that followed and named after the events of mid-October of that famous year and it was here that Kate, Ron, Mason, Ruthie and I arrived at lunchtime having let in the ultimately successful peal-band at Grundisburgh – well done to Ian Culham on ringing his first of Royal on the tenth anniversary of his first peal and Neil Avis on ringing his 700th – and travelled down to East Sussex. Touring the impressive Abbey and the grounds that overlook the site where King Harold was killed, supposedly by an arrow to the eye, the boy darted around looking at information boards and making the noises of 11th century warfare, delighted and in his element.\n\nHaving had the obligatory (especially on such a cold day!) pot of tea in the Abbey’s café and purchased bow and ‘arrows’ from the gift-shop for the deserving five-year old, we wandered the lovely town and the church of St Mary the Virgin, where we took a pre-emptive look around the Christmas Trees Festival set up for tomorrow, all whilst a quarter of Plain Bob Major was rung on the 21cwt eight upstairs. We didn’t hang around long enough to see who was ringing, but it transpired there were in fact a couple of people I know in the band. Small world, bellringing.\n\nDarkness creeping up early, as we fast approach not only Christmas but the shortest day of the year, we made our way to our accommodation for the night, the Claverton Country House Hotel, a luxurious place to lay our head and prepare for an evening out, which ultimately took us to The White Hart in nearby Cripp’s Corner for some superb food, drink and company. Eventually we got to bed, exhausted but satisfied, not just with a grand day out, but also with Ipswich Town winning away, as our mini-revival (about the 200th mini-revival of the last few seasons, but still one to be enjoyed) continues.\n\nOn the downside, we had to forsake today’s South-East District ADM at Bredfield and Pettistree. It had to be a weekend as special as this, which fitted in with five people’s diaries at a busy time of year for us, to take the unusual step of missing a district event, but we still played our part, as Kate and I put Ruthie forward as the District Secretary to replace Jane Harper. Unsurprisingly, she was duly elected in her absence, but sadly, my attempts to persuade one prominent member to stand forward as Chairman to replace the outgoing Peter Harper failed. It was understandable, as this particular member is busy and already does much to help ringing at a tower, district and Guild level, but with seemingly no one else able and willing to step into this important but far from demanding role, it leaves a void for the SE at a worrying crossroads for its future. The attendances for most events have been reasonable, apart from the notable exception of the disgracefully low turnout for the September meeting at Orford, but it is still a small proportion of the district with the largest (by far) membership in the Guild and there is still the sense that things are being kept afloat by the same dwindling number of loyal attendees. We have a talented, young two-thirds of a top table now with Tom and Ruthie, but they could really do with a Chairman/woman to help them along and their most pressing and daunting task is now to find one. So please members of the SE, really think about this hard. Who is willing to be put forward? Who could be put forward? As fast as he’s learning, even Mason isn’t ready for the job just yet!\n\nTop\n\nFriday 30th November 2012\n\nUsually, even I don’t get properly into the Christmas spirit until December, but following last night’s festive activities, Ruthie on her work’s seasonal do this evening and us going on a very special trip tomorrow, Mason and I pre-empted the change of month and got the tree and decorations out and put up. It of course delighted the li’l chap and hopefully not for the last time this weekend, but as always, I enjoyed the tinsel, colour and shininess of it all.\n\nElsewhere in the county, the business of ringing was being undertaken and with particular effect at Wissett, where Nicole Rolph was ringing her first quarter of Minor inside today. Well done Nicole! What a nice note on which to leave November and enter December.\n\nTop\n\nThursday 29th November 2012\n\nThere’s still twenty-six days to go until my favourite day of the year and it’s only November, but it all felt a lot closer this evening as braved it into Ipswich on late-shopping night of all nights. The purpose of my visit wasn’t to get presents though, but rather to help ring in the start of the St Mary-le-Tower Christmas Tree Festival which runs until next Tuesday.\n\nPassing the ringers' tree, which was sitting resplendent with the Suffolk Guild badge made by Sean last year proudly atop, I made up eight which rang some decent call-changes for the masses both in the church and on the busy streets, before I ventured out to the Cornhill to view the town’s Christmas ‘Tree’. If I’m honest, I expected to dislike it. I’d heard this structure of metal balls and lights more reminiscent of an art sculpture, had been dubbed ‘The Marmite Tree’ – you either loved it or hated it and a fair amount of people hated it. But do you know what? I actually quite liked it. I still think I’d prefer a real tree and I wouldn’t like a version in my living room, but it looked spectacular opposite the brightly bedecked Town Hall as shoppers rushed around it gift-gathering.\n\nI left them all to it, as Ruthie needed picking up from choir practice, where their apparently complicated festive repertoire was further tested, before we settled down at home for a warming, November hot chocolate.\n\nTop\n\nWednesday 28th November 2012\n\nIn ringing, there is little more disappointing then losing a peal at or near the end. I’ve experienced it before a few years ago, when a group of us travelled down from the West Midlands to Long Ashton on the outskirts of Bristol for an attempt of the Surprise Major method named after the city. As you will see from a successful effort on this grand but heavy eight on Saturday, involving a certain Robert C Beavis, this is a three-and-a-half-hour jobbie, so you can imagine our despair when an erroneous member of the band wouldn’t be put right and we lost the peal just leads from the end. And of course, peals have been ‘lost’ even afterwards when found later to be false, though touch wood, God willing and all that, I haven’t been a victim to my knowledge yet.\n\nRuthie too has been the victim of a late peal-loss at St Mary-le-Tower, when a peal of Stedman Cinques collapsed a matter of changes from the finishing line back in 2006, and it was here that we experienced a similar feeling tonight, as a 5120 of Cornwall Surprise Major was miscalled four-fifths of the way in. It was frustrating obviously, but these things happen and ultimately it was an enjoyable evening of ringing. We were on for 2hrs55mins, which is swift for this slow-turning front eight of a heavy twelve, and it was all the better for it. I find that when ringing is moved along – within reason – that it improves greatly. As opposed to slower ringing where the bigger gaps give more scope for bad striking, with quicker ringing it becomes about going with the flow, ebbing to and fro and tapping along with sparkle. Often with slower ringing, bells get dragged out, there are inconsistencies and no life to it. It’s not always the case, as it largely depends on the quality of the ringers, where and sometimes what you’re ringing, but it won’t surprise any of you that I prefer to ring a sparkling, swift peal of Major at 2hrs30-45mins than a laboured one of over three hours.\n\nThe trade of with quicker ringing, is that you need to raise the concentration levels and think faster, and we didn’t always do that tonight (I include myself in that), thus making the conductor’s job that much harder, but otherwise there was some very good ringing and a jovial session in The Cricketers afterwards, where I enjoyed a seasonal November pint of Butcombe Brewery’s Christmas Steps. That helped get over the disappointment!\n\nTop\n\nTuesday 27th November 2012\n\nAs Suffolk Guild PR Officer, I have been delighted to see the publicity over the Redgrave project, which as well as yesterday’s airspace on Look East took up some well earned column inches in the East Anglian Daily Times. None of it has been done through me and that suits me just fine. I see my role as a point of reference for those who are unable or unwilling, for whatever reason, to arrange PR in the way that Christopher Davies and co have so brilliantly done in the last few days. So please let me know if you want to arrange some publicity – as someone has just this week – but also feel free to go ahead yourself.\n\nOtherwise there was nothing much to publicise about my evening, bar a quick visit to Kate’s for Ruthie and me to pick up some mail for someone called Miss Eagle who lives in Edwin Avenue and a haircut for me and a relaxing couple of hours listening to Ipswich Town winning another game! Pleasant, but probably not quite exciting enough to let the media know about.\n\nTop\n\nMonday 26th November 2012\n\nThere was an interesting report on BBC Look East this evening about the project at Redgrave, where I understand the six are to have two tenors and a flat bell added, and put in a new nine-bell frame which is to be placed where the old oak frame currently is, which in turn will be moved to lower down the tower. All made possible by an amazing bequest of £120,000 from the late, incredible Albert Driver, there was tremendous footage of him ringing from a previous story on the great man, a good interview with Christopher Davies and there is an article on the BBC’s Suffolk website too. Great PR and very satisfying to see that a family stretching back over 160 years into ringing’s past has offered something that will hopefully have a lasting effect for many more years than that into ringing’s future.\n\nThere was a satisfying sense of learning and looking to the future at St Mary-le-Tower practice this evening too. Like everywhere else, ideally SMLT needs to be teaching ringers and whilst latest learner Paul was in the corner on a tied rope running through exercises learnt by David Potts at Saturday’s apparently very successful ITTS Module One course at Reydon, Sonia was having her first go at ringing on ten and twelve and Sean continued his journey into change-ringing.\n\nThe learning at the other end stalled abruptly with a disappointing collapse of Superlative Max, considering the good ringing we had in the method just eight days ago. Still, it was a good night, enhanced by Ruthie actually getting served by the same girl who refused her last week in The Cricketers, with no questions asked this time, though my wife was slightly disappointed as she was poised with her passport!\n\nLooking ahead, this Saturday sees the last of this year’s district ADM’s as the South-East District holds theirs at Pettistree, with ringing at Bredfield beforehand. Please note the change of venue and please do attend if you can. There is much on offer in these villages with The Castle pub at the latter, The Greyhound at the former, wonderful countryside and all sorts of amenities in nearby Wickham Market and Woodbridge, so that even non-ringers can have a nice afternoon out accompanying their ringing partner/family. And ultimately, it is a very important meeting for the future of the district, as we shall need to vote in a new chairman and secretary to replace the outgoing Mr and Mrs Harper who have done a superb job.\n\nAs the project at Redgrave shows, we have a past to be proud of and a future to cultivate, and it is the various events put on by the Guild and its districts which help bring ringers together, get them involved and help progress ringing and cultivate that future. Events like the ADM’s, the North-East District’s Surprise Major Practice at Halesworth on Friday, Ten-Bell Practice at Beccles next Wednesday, Carol Service at Benhall on Saturday 8th December and Beyond Plain Bob Minor Practice at Worlingham on Tuesday 11th December. Those in the North-West District, such as their Christmas Social on Saturday 8th December and the Bacton Monthly Practice on Wednesday 12th December. The South-West District’s Carol Service at All Saints, Sudbury on Saturday 15th and the Midweek Ringing on Tuesday 11th December at Henley and Offton. All will need support, as Redgrave has needed support, SMLT needs support and indeed Suffolk ringing generally needs support. Let’s give that support.\n\nTop\n\nSunday 25th November 2012\n\nLast night was very windy, especially with our flimsy wooden windows and our position next to woodland on top of a hill that is barely protected between us and the coast at Felixstowe. So I was pleasantly surprised to wake and find no damage to our house or anything nearby, though one of our bins couldn’t stand up to the powerful breeze battering it overnight, strewn as it was across the grass like a Premier League footballer who had just been tapped on the shoulder.\n\nNot so lucky was one of the trees in St Mary-le-Tower churchyard, as Mason and I arrived to find our usual way in blocked by said tree and a friendly man from the council dressed in hi-vis orange and about to tackle the unexpected barrier with his chainsaw. He was efficient, as a couple courses of Little Bob Max, some call-changes on twelve and an aborted half-course of Cambridge Royal later and the path was clear and he was nowhere to be seen.\n\nNo such drama at Grundisburgh, the next port of call for the boy and me, both for a breezy visit to the park, and for me to run the ringing in Stephen’s absence. Although there was no service here this morning, we apparently delighted those manning and exploring the Crib Festival down in the church, a nice payback for them delighting my son and me beforehand, as we took a wander around the amazing selection of cribs from across the world.\n\nFrom here we went to meet Ruthie at Woodbridge’s parish church, after she’d sung in the choir for the morning service which also doubled up as the licensing of Canon Penny Brown, the assistant priest at St Mary’s. Present to carry this out was good friend of the Guild and Bishop of St Edmundsbury & Ipswich, the Right Reverend Nigel Stock. I’m always pleasantly surprised with all the people he must come across in his work, that he remembers Mason, Ruthie and me and it was nice of him to make a beeline for us over tea and coffee, especially at the end of a difficult week that had not only seen him involved in that big vote on women bishops at the General Synod, but then saw him having to criss-cross the west of the country as his personal and family plans were heavily disrupted by the terrible conditions in the south-west of England, and prior to him heading over to Hintlesham for a confirmation service. It strikes me that women and their multi-tasking skills could probably do very well as bishops!\n\nMind you, we three had a relatively busy afternoon ourselves, as the li’l chap and I returned to SMLT, this time with Mrs Munnings in tow as we rang for the St John Ambulance County Service. Though not a Christmas service, it is the first of many events that DO have a Christmas theme over the next few weeks that will need ringing for in Ipswich. For us, ringers are needed on Thursday evening to ring for the start of the Christmas Tree Festival, which then runs on through to 4th December, and there will be other services in the lead-up to big day itself in exactly a month, as well as ringers required at St Nicholas for the annual Carol Service there on the evening of Wednesday 12th December and the hugely successful Christmas Ringing at all the ringable Ipswich towers from 11.30am on Saturday 22nd December. No doubt there will be extra ringing around Suffolk at this busy time, including at Buxhall on the morning of Saturday 8th December for the North-West District Christmas Social, and later on the same day at Benhall for the North-East District Carol Service. Please do support ringing wherever you can, as it is often this time of year more than any other when what we do is appreciated most.\n\nFor now we did our bit this afternoon, which saw some superb ringing on eight and ten, before we returned home to be picked up by Mason’s Godfather Toby and his fiancée Amy, so we could all attend the li’l chap’s Godmother Kala’s birthday meal at The Black Tiles in Martlesham. It was as usual a wonderful social occasion with good food, good beer and good company and thank you to blog reader Amy for taking us!\n\nMeanwhile, it was good to see The Norman Tower doing some more for St Edmund with an impressive looking quarter of Stedman Caters on the back ten.\n\nWe returned from the pub as the wind got up again, and though we aren’t expecting anything anywhere as bad as what other parts of the country have experienced and will no doubt experience tonight, we’ll cross our fingers and say a quick prayer that we again escape unscathed from the weather.\n\nTop\n\nSaturday 24th November 2012\n\nThere is an interesting article in this week’s Ringing World by AJB, aka Anthony J Barnfield of Worcestershire, a long-time contributor to the RW well before Messrs Beavis and Tatlow filled the letters pages with their exchanges. On this occasion he was suggesting that despite communication being faster, easier and more encompassing than ever before, many ringers seem entirely unaware of what’s going on in ringing, not just with the fascinating and often exciting scene nationally and internationally, but locally. Many ringers of course don’t have the internet and some that do seem unwilling to use it. I remember one correspondent, who is online, blasting the Guild for having the temerity of using this cheap, fast and efficient way of communicating with its members. A charity, trying to save money?! Disgraceful!\n\nOf course, we mustn’t simply rely on electronic communications and we don’t. After all, as Anthony points out, the numbers taking in ringing online aren’t actually that big. Even the most popular performances on BellBoard are usually only viewed by hundreds rather than the thousands you may expect, and whilst there aren’t any such figures for Campanophile, one can probably assume similar numbers visit there too. Ringing Chat, the ringing forum which clutters up my other email address, essentially seems to consist of the same handful of people contributing, and usually on subjects completely unrelated to ringing. In fact, ringing contributions from anyone other than the ‘in-crowd’ often seem to go unnoticed or ignored. It is heartening that people seem to be kept in the loop by my blog, but I’m also aware that it isn’t read by that many people in the scheme of things, and as much as I believe we have the best ringing website about, I suspect there’s huge swathes of the membership who rarely or even never use it, which is a shame. Even our facebook page only has ninety-eight members out of a prospective 700-800 resident members.\n\nBut even disregarding that side of things, many ringers are terrible at staying in the loop, and they and ringing suffer for it in my humble opinion. As Mr Barnfield points out, the RW itself is subscribed to by a minimal number of the 40,000+ ringers around the world, though of course many couples, families and even belfries will share a single copy between them. Awl a’huld is a superb publication, distributed in physical form to the belfries of Suffolk. Whether via the internet, email or post, What’s Ons should be up in every Guild tower and indeed I see them in most of the places I travel to in the county. The dates that events take place on are fairly fixed. First Saturday of the month is the South-East District, second is the two northern districts, the third Saturday is usually put aside for Guild events and the fourth is the South-West District’s for events such as today’s ADM at Bures. The Guild Striking Competitions are ALWAYS held on the third Saturday of May and apart from the odd rare occasion, the Guild AGM has for years been undertaken on the Saturday after Easter weekend. Yet still I hear members claim they had no idea that an event was being held or that something important in ringing had happened. It certainly highlights to me in my role as PRO that we and I can’t just rely on people finding out about our events and what’s going in ringing generally – we have to take it to them, proactively tell them about things and encourage them to get involved.\n\nIt won’t surprise you to know that I rely mainly on the internet to keep up with most things ringing-related and don’t subscribe to the RW, so it was unusual for me to be reading an up to date copy of ringing’s most enduring and popular journal. Today though, I was taking in the above from the Hollesley tower copy as I stood in the ringing chamber of All Saints before an ultimately successful peal of Yorkshire Major, arranged as a belated seventieth birthday compliment to Peter Harper, which as I mentioned a few weeks ago is well deserved. It also marked exactly ten years since Ruthie’s first peal of Yorkshire and indeed her first of Surprise Major altogether, though she wasn’t desperate for that to be included in the footnote.\n\nOn top of all that, it also took the Guild past 2011’s peal totals with over a month of 2012 left, an achievement made possible in no small part by the enthusiasm of young George M Salter. And along with his brother Colin, he was at it again today, albeit in the name of the Norwich Diocesan Association as they partook in another one of those baffling-looking peals of Doubles, on this occasion at Huntingfield. Well done to the middle Salter brother on ringing his first peal of Doubles, of variations only and with asymmetric calls and to both of them on ringing their most variations and their longest length rung yet.\n\nThere was also some Doubles being rung at Old Newton, where congratulations are due to former resident member Hannah Khan (once Kidger) and her husband Nick on the birth of their first child Frank Patrik on a day of ringing in celebration. I hope they’ve got plenty of sleep in!\n\nOnce photos of the peal-band had been taken by the Reverend Ruth Hatchett, we took advantage of Mason helping his Nana and Granddad at the Sproughton Bazaar this morning, by having a pint in The Sorrel Horse in the village neighbouring Hollesley on this beautiful peninsula, Shottisham. It is ages since my wife and I have been here, but as usual it was a pleasant place to be with its fire going well, on another cold day, as we chatted on subjects ranging from the recent College Youth’s Dinner to how best Ipswich ringing can attract those attending the UCS into the ringing scene. It is something we ought to be discussing and any feedback from readers would be much appreciated!\n\nHaving picked the li’l chap up from Chez Ashcroft (thanks again Mum and Dad!), we headed round Kate’s for a roast and a couple of beers (thanks Kate!) before finally returning home, the wind getting up and ominous weather warnings for much of the country.\n\nTop\n\nFriday 23rd November 2012\n\nBad news from Orford, as a crack in one of the tower’s buttresses has been discovered to have got quite bad and ringing at this eight has been suspended for now. Hopefully it will be ascertained quickly whether it is ringing that is causing the problem, with proper input from ringing’s technical experts, rather than simply assuming that the bells are the problem, and it seems that Richard Moody is already looking to do this.\n\nOtherwise though, it was a quiet day today, as Fridays for Ruthie and me quite often are these days. Mason had enjoyed a party and some ten-pin bowling, with his school closed for teacher training day before I picked him up, but besides that and the news from Orford there was nothing much to distinguish it, bar Tracey Scase’s first quarter as conductor in the success at Ashbocking. Well done Tracey!\n\nTop\n\nThursday 22nd November 2012\n\nLights, camera, action!\n\nFollowing a power-cut that had knocked out the electricity at home and left St Mary’s Church Centre bathed in the dimness of their emergency lights, I was stood contemplating sitting in on Ruthie’s choir practice at the latter of the two venues, whilst they warmed up and mother-in-law Kate was trying to control a huge pack of Brownies in the corridor whilst dressed as a Scotsman. It was one of those evenings.\n\nAs I stood there though, power was restored and as nice as it would have been to sit on the choir practicing their forthcoming repertoire, I had an unusual event to attend for a Thursday night – Grundisburgh practice. So with my trusty camera, I grabbed a quick photo of the big Christmas tree on the Market Hill outside the Church Centre - now fully lit with its source of energy returned - and continued on with an evening of action that saw me opening up the ringing chamber for the twelve at St Mary the Virgin, the outside here also looking festive – or about as festive as you can expect for late November – with Cribfest in full flow until Sunday.\n\nBy the time I left mid-way through to pick my wife up and bring her to proceedings, five others had arrived, with Mum and Dad just pulling in, despite the eleven or twelve promised. By our return though, there was enough to ring on the ten, including Beryl from Burgh, who it was nice to see after such a long time. Grandsire Caters was rung – though we struggled – as was some Cambridge, Yorkshire & Superlative Surprise Major spliced, alongside some Bob Minor and Stedman Triples. Useful, varied and decent. In fact, it was a lot like practices used to be up here, only on this occasion superbly run by David Stanford.\n\nBefore anyone gets too excited (I know you were!), there definitely won’t be a practice next week as there is a concert rehearsal in the church, but this was the second practice in a few weeks (third if you include the one for our Lancashire visitors a couple of months back) after a year without one, so the signs are the practices MAY be getting back on track.\n\nWhilst Stephen wasn’t there tonight, hopefully he will be at future practices, as his presence would’ve made twelve, but he is still active and tonight sent out details of his 2013 Italian Ringing Trip, next year leaving on Friday 25th October and returning on Sunday 3rd November. Every year he says it will probably be his last one, but he seems serious this time, so if you’ve never been on this fascinating and highly enjoyable half-term trip, to take in the various different styles"
