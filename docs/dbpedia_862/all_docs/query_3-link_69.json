        "text": "Anastacia grew up here and attended high school. Her father was a singer and her mother was an actress who also appeared on Broadway. Her interest in show business was aroused at a young age and so she attended the \"Professional Children''s School\", where her talent was further developed. However, Anastacia received her first engagements as a dancer in various appearances in video clips. Recordings followed in which she was used as a background singer. When she finally arrived here, her talent initially proved to be a downfall, because in the recordings with her, her voice was so dominant that they had to keep it so quiet that it could hardly be heard. When there were no further orders and Anastacia did not receive a contract as a singer, she decided to write her own songs. After the first pieces were finished, she was able to choose between several contracts. However, this time she wasn't interested because with all the offers she wouldn't have been allowed to sing what she wanted and she would have had to give up her style.\n\nNot discouraged, in 1998 she took part in \"The Cult\", a singing competition on the music channel MTV. Although she was only able to take 10th place overall, the most renowned record labels were lining up for her and Anastacia was able to fully achieve her wishes. Anastacia decided on \"Epic Records\" and after careful work, her debut album \"Not That Kind\" was released in 2000, which also gave her her international breakthrough with over 5 million records sold. In the same year she performed at the \"SWR3 New Pop Festival\" in Baden-Baden. The album also won the \"Echo\" in the \"Best International Newcomer\" category in 2001. She finally became a star in 2001 with her second album \"Freak Of Nature\", with which she once again impressively underlined her talent. As a further highlight, Anastacia delivered the official song for the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea. The song entitled \"Boom\" was heard for the first time during the draw for the World Cup finals in Pusan.\n\nIn January 2003, she let her management announce that she had breast cancer. All further appointments were canceled because Anastacia had to seek medical treatment. After suffering from breast cancer, she founded the \"Anastacia Fund\", which is part of the \"Brest Cancer Research Foundation\" and is committed to early detection therapies for breast cancer. At the beginning of 2004, after her recovery, she published the piece \"Left outside alone\". She celebrated the stage debut of this song in March 2004 as part of the \"Echo\" awards in Berlin. At the end of March 2004, Anastacia released the accompanying album entitled \"Anastacia\", which was certified five times platinum in Germany. At the award ceremony of the German Entertainment Prize in Munich, Anastacia was awarded the German Music Prize at the end of January 2005. At the Echo Awards in April 2005 she was honored as \"International Rock/Pop Artist\".\n\nIn autumn 2005 Anastacia released her first greatest hits album entitled \"Pieces of a dream\". She also became active as a fashion designer. She created a collection that was released under her name by the s.Oliver label in August 2006.\n\nAnne Bancroft was born on September 17, 1931 in The Bronx, NY, the middle daughter of Michael Italiano (1905-2001), a dress pattern maker, and Mildred DiNapoli (1907-2010), a telephone operator. She made her cinema debut in Versuchung auf 809 (1952) in 1952, and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies such as Der Würger von Coney Island (1954), Die Gladiatoren (1954), Pantherkatze (1955), Wenn die Nacht anbricht (1956) and Das Mädchen mit den schwarzen Strümpfen (1957). By 1957 she grew dissatisfied with the scripts she was getting, left the film business and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to screens in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in Licht im Dunkel (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in Schlafzimmerstreit (1964), Stimme am Telefon (1965), Der junge Löwe (1972), Das Nervenbündel (1975), Der Elefantenmensch (1980), Sein oder Nichtsein (1983), Zwischen den Zeilen (1987) and other movies, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in Die Reifeprüfung (1967). Her status as the \"older woman\" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was only eight years older than Katharine Ross and just six years older than Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared onscreen more frequently in the '90s and early '00s, playing a range of characters in such films as Love Potion No. 9 - Der Duft der Liebe (1992), Codename - Nina (1993), Familienfeste und andere Schwierigkeiten (1995), Die Akte Jane (1997), Große Erwartungen (1998), Glauben ist alles! (2000) and Die Villa (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not disclosed her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and their son Max Brooks, who was born in 1972. Her final film, the animated feature Delgo (2008), was released posthumously in 2008 and dedicated to her memory.\n\nBaz Luhrmann is an Australian writer, director and producer with projects spanning film, television, opera, theater, music and recording industries. He is regarded by many as a contemporary example of an auteur for his distinctly recognizable style and deep involvement in the writing, directing, design and musical components of all his work. As a storyteller, he 's known as a pioneer of pop culture, fusing high and low culture with a unique sonic and cinematic language. He is the most commercially successful Australian director, with his films making up four of the top ten highest worldwide grossing Australian films ever.\n\nDuring his studies at Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art, Luhrmann collaborated with other students to create ''Strictly ballroom'', a stage production drawn from his childhood experiences in the world of ballroom dancing. Luhrmann later adapted the show into his 1992 film debut, Strictly Ballroom - Die gegen alle Regeln tanzen (1992), which premiered at Cannes to a fifteen-minute standing ovation. Thus began the ''Red Curtain Trilogy'', which would include the film William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) as well as the Oscar-winning Moulin Rouge! (2001). The latter also took home Golden Globes for Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Original Score. This first body of work was capped by Luhrmann's 2002 Broadway adaptation of the opera ''La Bohème'', recognized by two Tony Awards.\n\nIn 2004, Luhrmann collaborated once more with actress Nicole Kidman to create No. 5 The Film, a short film featuring the iconic Chanel perfume, as well as costumes designed by Karl Lagerfeld. With its success, the piece ushered in a new era of fashion advertising and became a landmark in the evolution of branded content. In 2008, Luhrmann worked with Kidman for a third time on the ambitious epic Australia (2008), the titular country's second-highest grossing film of all time. He later adapted F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''The Great Gatsby'' into a 2013 film, Der große Gatsby (2013), which went on to become the director's highest-grossing movie at over $353 million worldwide. The film was awarded with two Oscars and earned praise from Fitzgerald's granddaughter, who noted that \"Scott would have been proud\". The film's soundtrack pulled the Roaring 20s into the 2000s, blending early 20th century jazz with contemporary hip-hop. The album, produced by Luhrmann, Anton Monsted, and Jay-Z, hit number one on the Billboard charts and garnered several Grammy nominations.\n\nMost recently, Luhrmann created The Get Down (2016), a 2016 Netflix series and 1970s-set mythic saga of how the South Bronx, at the brink of bankruptcy, gave birth to hip-hop, punk and disco. In the interest of cultural authenticity and historical accuracy Luhrmann collaborated with some of the era's most legendary artists, including [linl=nm0334739], Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Nas, Kurtis Blow, and Hector Xtravaganza. The show was a critical success, certified fresh by Rotten Tomatoes, and described by Variety as \"a reclamation of, and a love letter to, a marginalized community of a certain era, told through the unreliable tools of romance, intuition and lived experiences.\"\n\nAdd further information about Elvis film release here. Needs to be in his bio.\n\nBruce Spence was born on September 17, 1945 in New Zealand. When he was growing up in Henderson, just out of Auckland, the last thing he ever expected to be was an actor. Bruce's family were winemakers, and he worked in the family winery from a very tender age, later attending Henderson High School then Massey University, where he studied horticulture. From this background he retained a passion for growing things, and has created a succession of beautiful gardens for himself and friends. At 20, Bruce moved to Australia, where to his surprise he was accepted into the National Gallery of Victoria Art School. Bruce's mother, Olga, was a painter and potter. In 1969 Bruce joined a ragtag group working at the tiny La Mama theatre in Melbourne. The group became the revolutionary Australian Performing Group, and Bruce's talent for acting was discovered. Forced to choose between art and acting, he decided to try his luck at the latter. He went on to perform in numerous plays with the group, then the Melbourne Theatre Company, the Sydney Theatre Company, the South Australian Theatre Company and several other companies, even the National Arts Centre of Canada where he played the lead in the award-winning \"The Floating World\" by John Romeril. He now lives in Sydney, where his recent acting credits with the Sydney Theatre Company include \"The Secret River\", \"The Harp in the South\", \"Endgame\" and \"Rules for Living\". Bruce has appeared in close to 100 films, including Mad Max 2 (\"The Road Warrior\") and 3 (\"Beyond Thunderdome\"), \"Ace Ventura\" Part II, \"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\", \"Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith\", \"Finding Nemo\", \"The Matrix Revolutions\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell no Tales\". He has also appeared in numerous television roles. When starring as the wizard Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander in the cult series \"Legend of the Seeker\", which was filmed in New Zealand, Bruce found he had come full circle, working directly opposite his old high school in Henderson. At home in Sydney he lives quietly with his wife, Jenny and an adoring tabby cat. They have two children and four grandchildren. Between jobs Bruce works on his own burgeoning garden and as a volunteer at the Royal Botanic Garden, where he and his group propagate plants. He is also currently chair of the NSW Actors' Benevolent Fund."
