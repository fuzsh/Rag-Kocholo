        "text": "\"More than just the king of sports, football is the king of all games. All the great competitions of man are ball games. What the ball is to life is what breaks away from life's laws. On Earth it has the uniqueness of a temporarily tamed sports car. Beyond its principle, beyond independence, or its huge impetus, the team gives the ball the drive of 11 vicious attitudes and of 11 imaginary projections…\" 1 Football is regarded as the most important sport of the modern age. It is the sport with the largest spread and the biggest popularity. Its unstoppable growth and its mass audience, surpassing any other competition in sport history, has made many people search for its origins by looking at ancient times. Of course, the ball is not one of humanity's recent inventions. There are various old writings throughout history that specify the action of kicking the ball. However, its role has remained insignificant during games in ancient and medieval times. Furthermore, only when football has been acknowledged as the legendary sport of this century, did its roots begin to be studied by scholars. We're permanently informed of archeological discoveries, which reveal drawings and texts that document the \"ancestors of football\". It's as if there's a competition between countries and people, made only with the purpose of proving that their land has the oldest traces of football. In reality, what does determine the importance of these discoveries is the present, football and its role nowadays. No matter how much information we would gather about the old forms the ball game played by foot, we couldn't explain the extraordinary popularity and spread football has, the most important sport of our times. And this is why the appearance and evolution of football in the last century doesn't find its origin within the game itself, but, as we will further notice, in existing political-diplomatic conditions from the end of the nineteenth century. These circumstances have transformed the ball game in a sport of the masses that was exported in all corners of the world. The study of the game's ancient forms can't offer us all the plausible explanations for understanding the evolution of fooball throughout the world, but this study allows football to be associated to a set of values that reflect society's needs, its aspirations and its hidden hopes. At the same time, the present work brings useful arguments, when trying to answer\n\nThis Handbook offers an analysis of the relation between football and politics, based on over 30 case studies covering five continents. It provides a detailed picture of this relation in a wide number of European, American, African, and Asian states, as well as a comparative assessment of football in a global perspective, thus combining the general and the local. It examines themes such as the political origins of football in the studied country, the historical club rivalries, the political aspects of football as a sports spectacle, and the contemporary issues linked to the political use of football. By following the same structure with each study, the volume allows for the comparison between largely investigated cases and cases that have seldom been addressed. The Handbook will be of use particularly to students and scholars in the fields of sport studies, political science and sociology, as well as cultural studies, anthropology and leisure studies.\n\nReview published in EuropeNow-https://www.europenowjournal.org (Aug. 4, 2020). The book under review deals with the footballing culture (men's professional soccer) developed in the greater Manchester (UK) area from 1840 to 1919. The original aspect of Gary James's study of the long-term development of football, which he clearly explains and justifies, is the way in which his methodology owes much to Fernand Braudel’s social historical analysis and 'longue durée' approach. The study is written in the context of academic work by others in the last two decades within the \"origins debate\" about the early years of football in Britain, which evokes disappointment from James. He shows, among other things, that the short lived Hulme Athenaeum football club - contrary to earlier studies - exerted important influence on the development of the sport of football through former club members going on to hold key positions of governance in the FA and the Football League. By the end of the beginning of a recognizable football culture in Manchester, i.e. by 1919, the key individuals developing football there included public schoolboys and also men from the lower-middle class-some from Manchester. He encourage other researchers to use his methodology to study other sites of football's development, at the level of city, region, or metropolis."
