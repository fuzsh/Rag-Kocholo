East of Yonge, the lots were laid out parallel to the Third Concession Road (St. Clair Avenue) and extended east to present day Bayview Avenue. A fledgling community developed at the crossroads formed by Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue. On mid-19th century maps, the area was marked \"Deer Park\" in recognition of the Heath Farm at the northwest corner of the intersection where deer were purported to wander. With the growth of the City of Toronto and improvements to Yonge Street, most of the land on either side of the thoroughfare was subdivided into building lots. An exception was Lot 19, north of the Yonge and St. Clair corners, which remained undivided under the ownership of the Cawthra family. In 1873, trustees of the Toronto General Burying Ground purchased Lot 19 as the location of Mount Pleasant Cemetery. It remains the only intact 200-acre lot to survive in the former City of Toronto.\n\nThe first non-sectarian cemetery in York (Toronto) opened in 1826 on a six-acre site near the northwest corner of Yonge and Bloor Streets. Officially named the York Burying Ground, but better known as Potter's Field Cemetery or the Strangers Burial Ground, the cemetery contained 6000 burials by the mid 19th century. With the continuing growth of the city, and the need for burial grounds removed from the urban core, the non-profit Toronto General Burial Ground Trust (later the Toronto Trust Cemeteries and now Commemorative Services of Ontario) was established to development new cemeteries. Most of the remains from Potter's Field were reinterred at the Necropolis, a 15-acre cemetery opened by the Trust in 1850. Unidentified remains were moved to Mount Pleasant Cemetery following its opening in 1876.\n\nIn 1874, Henry A. Engelhardt designed the new cemetery, originally encompassing the 53 acres closest to Yonge Street. Trained as a civil engineer in his native Germany, Engelhardt became a landscape architect who laid out parks and cemeteries throughout North America, including the initial plans for High Park. The design of the cemetery as a park-like space with walks, drives, fences and natural lakes was inspired by the garden cemetery movement and in particular, Mount Auburn Cemetery in Boston. Trees, shrubs and gardens were meticulously added and, today, Mount Pleasant has one of the most important collections of trees in North America, combining indigenous and non-indigenous species.\n\nThe first burial at Mount Pleasant Cemetery occurred in March, 1876, prior to the official opening in November, 1876. Scientist Sir Frederick Banting, Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and pianist Glenn Gould are among the noteworthy people buried in the cemetery where interments number 168,000. Following the annexation of the Deer Park neighbourhood in 1908, the City of Toronto absorbed Mount Pleasant Cemetery on June 27, 1914.\n\nMassey Mausoleum:\n\nIndustrialist and philanthropist Hart Alberin Massey (1823-1896) commissioned the Massey Mausoleum. In 1851, Massey took over the management of his father's foundry and machine shop in Newcastle, Canada West (now Ontario). Following its incorporation as the Massey Manufacturing Company in 1870, the firm relocated to Toronto in 1879, producing agricultural implements on a six-acre site on King Street West near Strachan Avenue. The company grew through a series of mergers, including one with its chief rival, the A. Harris, Son and Company in 1891. Hart Massey served as the president of the renamed Massey-Harris Company (it became Massey-Ferguson in 1958 and was absorbed by the Varity Corporation in 1987). By the close of the 19th century, Massey-Harris employed hundreds and was the largest producer and exporter of its type in the British Empire.\n\nHart Massey acquired his plot in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in the early 1880s. Plans for the Massey Mausoleum followed the untimely deaths of his eldest and youngest sons, Charles Albert Massey (1848-1884) and Fred Victor Massey (1866-1890). The mausoleum was completed in 1894, along with two other memorials to his children: the Massey Music Hall and the Fred Victor Mission. In addition to Hart Massey and the sons who predeceased him, eight Massey family members and close associates are interred in the Mausoleum. Hart Massey's only daughter, Lillian Massey Treble (1854-1915) is remembered for funding the University of Toronto's Household Sciences Building. Chester Daniel Massey (1850-1926) was the last surviving son and the administrator of Hart Massey's will. In 1918, Chester Massey oversaw the creation of the Massey Foundation, whose philanthropic endeavours included the funding of Hart House and Massey College at the University of Toronto (the latter sites are included on the City of Toronto Inventory of Heritage Properties). Other members of the Massey family are buried in the triangle of land surrounding the Mausoleum, including Hart Massey's third son, Walter Edward Hart Massey (1864-1901), who served as the president of the Massey-Harris Company prior to his death. The Massey Foundation maintains the Massey Mausoleum.\n\nHart Massey engaged Toronto architect Edward James Lennox (1854-1933) to design the Massey Mausoleum. Following an apprenticeship with architect William Irving, E. J. Lennox formed a short-lived partnership with Frederick McCaw. During this interval, Lennox and McCaw won a competition for their plan for Queen's Park, a project that was never realized but is an indication of the architect's familiarity with park design. Beginning in 1881, Lennox embarked on a solo practice that was one of the largest in Canada by 1885. While he closed his firm in 1917, Lennox's interest in the field remained intent and, in 1931, he received accreditation as a certified architect.\n\nLennox's association with the Massey family began in 1883 when he was awarded the commission for the Massey Manufacturing Company's head office building at 915 King Street West. At the same time, he devised the plans for a residence for Charles Massey at 519 Jarvis Street. Charles Massey died prior to the completion of the house. It was acquired by his brother, Chester, who raised his two sons there: Raymond Massey, the famed Hollywood actor, and Vincent Massey, Canada's first native-born Governor General. Beginning in 1886, Lennox was occupied with the design and construction of Toronto's Third City Hall (now known as Old City Hall) on Queen Street West. During this critical period in his career, the buildings of American architect Henry Hobbs Richardson, whose interpretations of Romanesque architecture became known across North America, influenced Lennox. Romanesque arches and decorative detailing marked Lennox's subsequent commissions through the end of the 19th century. His remaining projects for the Massey family, the Fred Victor Mission at Queen and Jarvis Streets (now demolished) and the Massey Mausoleum, bear the hallmarks of the style. The extant buildings are listed on the Inventory of Heritage Properties.\n\nCorrespondence between the architect and his client indicates that Hart Massey took an active interest in the plans for the mausoleum (Litvak, 38). Lennox consulted Massey on his decision to replace the simple Classical urn planned for the top of the structure with a sculpted figure evoking Christian symbolism. This detailing, combined with the church-like appearance of the structure, reflects Massey's position as one of the leading Methodists in Toronto society.\n\nThe Massey Mausoleum is one of 20 family mausoleums (seven of which are partially entombed) located in the west half of Mount Pleasant Cemetery. Classical temples inspired most of the designs. The Massey Mausoleum stands out among them as the largest and the most impressive of the two displaying Romanesque Revival styling.\n\nArchitectural Description:\n\nThe Massey Mausoleum is designed in the Romanesque Revival style identified by the use of round arches, heavy stone finishes and elaborate detailing drawn from the architecture of the 10th through the 12th centuries. Resting on a limestone foundation, there are ventilation grilles at grade. Combinations of rock faced and smooth blocks of granite are used for the walls, roofs, window detailing and carved decorations of the structure. The compressed basilican form is based on Romanesque church architecture. The plan features a central two-storey nave with a stepped roof. Flanking the nave are short single-storey side aisles (north and south) beneath stepped gable roofs with conical tops. A shallow single-storey porch on the principal (west) façade contains the entrance. On the rear (east) wall, the building has a semi-circular shaped apse protected by a conical stone roof with a dentilled cornice. A rounded false stair tower is asymmetrically positioned on the right (south) side of the entrance.\n\nOn the principal façade, four steps lead from the base of the mausoleum to the entrance. A pair of heavy bronze doors contains grilles with intricate patterns, panels with the letter \"M\", and hardware. The entrance is protected by a stepped roof, flanked by banded columns, and surmounted by a name band marked \"MASSEY\". The stair tower places a carved panel next to a single opening containing a multi-coloured stained glass window with floral motifs. Above, a round-arched arcade contains textured leaded glass windows in geometric patterns. Each side aisle displays a large round-arched opening with voussoirs. The opening holds a three-part window that is divided by columns beneath a transom with roundels. The upper part of the apse has an arcade of small flat-headed openings, divided by single, pairs and trios of columns and containing five multi-coloured stained glass windows with floral and leaf patterns. A horizontal band course divides the two-storey nave into roughly textured and smoothly finished parts. The corners of the upper wall display rounded buttresses that complement the shape of the columns and stair tower. On all four walls, the clerestorey contains a trio of round-arched openings. The windows hold leaded glass in a pattern of intricate interwoven circles with highly faceted jewels and roundels. Two of the windows include horizontal hinged ventilators for air circulation. A lantern surmounts the roof of the nave. It creates a base for a nine-foot-high figure symbolizing Hope. The anchor placed in the right hand of the figure can be interpreted as the symbol of the peaceful haven awaiting after the journey of life, or as the \"anchor\" of the Christian faith that remains unchallenged by death. The important Toronto sculptors, Holbrook and Mollington, carved the figure and the other detailing on the mausoleum. Their practice included noted Toronto landmarks such as the Bank of Montreal Building (now the Hockey Hall of Fame), the Ontario Legislative Building, and the George Gooderham House (now the York Club), all of which are included on the Inventory of Heritage Properties.\n\nThe interior rises two stories beneath a vaulted stone ceiling. A coloured mosaic tile floor contains a cast bronze grille. Beneath the grille, circular stairs lead down to the crypt with space for 15 interments. The area under the floor was filled in with concrete in 1967 (this is considered a reversible alteration). On either side of the nave, loculi with marble facings contain eight spaces for interments. The apse is entered through a round-arched portal supported on columns. At the east end, an altar is raised three steps.\n\nContext:\n\nThe Massey Mausoleum is located in Plot #116 at Mount Pleasant Cemetery. For the purposes of designation, the boundaries of the property are the structure are established by a limit of one metre around the exterior walls of the structure.\n\nThe ravine setting at the west end of Mount Pleasant Cemetery incorporates several rises of land. The Massey Mausoleum is elevated on a triangular-shaped parcel surrounded by roadways. With the height of the structure and its raised setting, the mausoleum is visible from many vantage-points within the cemetery and dominates the monuments in its vicinity.\n\nThe Massey Mausoleum is one of the three family mausoleums included on the Inventory of Heritage Properties in 1976. Dating to 1894, the Northrup-Gooderham Tomb and the French Tomb are built into the hillside in Section T near Yonge Street. The Mausoleum, a building containing chapels, a crematorium, and niches and crypts for interments, is located along the south side of the property off Inglewood Avenue. Designed by architects Darling and Pearson and completed in 1920, it is also identified on the Inventory of Heritage Properties.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Massey Mausoleum was constructed for the Masseys, one of the most influential families in the industrial development and philanthropic history of Toronto. It was built in1890-1894 according to the designs of E. J. Lennox, the most prolific Toronto architect at the end of the 19th century. The Massey Mausoleum is the largest and most visible mausoleum located in Mount Pleasant Cemetery, a landscaped garden cemetery noted for its size, design, and collection of trees.\n\nSources:\n\nDendy, William, and William Kilbourn.
