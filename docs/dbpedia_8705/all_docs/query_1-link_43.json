        "text": "As summer temperatures soar, homeowners face the challenge of keeping their homes cool and comfortable without breaking the bank on energy bills. With a combination of smart strategies, simple home improvements, and thoughtful adjustments, it’s possible to create a cool oasis even during the hottest months. Here are some practical tips to help homeowners stay cool this summer.\n\nAir conditioning is a primary tool for battling summer heat, but it can be expensive to run continuously. To optimize its use, start by setting the thermostat to the highest comfortable temperature.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy recommends setting your thermostat to 78°F when you are home and higher when you are away. Programmable thermostats can automatically adjust the temperature, ensuring energy efficiency and comfort. Some even allow you to set the temperature from your phone.\n\nRegular maintenance of your air conditioning unit is crucial. Replace or clean filters monthly to ensure efficient airflow and reduce strain on the system. Consider scheduling an annual professional check-up to keep the unit running smoothly.\n\nCeiling fans, box fans, and oscillating fans can complement your air conditioning system by circulating cool air throughout your home. Ceiling fans should rotate counterclockwise in the summer, creating a wind-chill effect that makes you feel cooler. This allows you to set the thermostat a few degrees higher without sacrificing comfort.\n\nPlace box fans in windows to draw in cooler evening air or use them to create a cross-breeze by positioning them opposite an open window. Oscillating fans can be used in living spaces to keep air moving and reduce the perception of heat.\n\nTaking advantage of cooler outdoor air during the early morning and late evening can help lower indoor temperatures. Open windows and doors to create a cross-ventilation effect, allowing cool air to flow through your home and push out warm air. Use window fans or attic fans to enhance this process.\n\nDuring the hottest part of the day, close windows, doors, and curtains to keep the heat out. Insulated or blackout curtains are particularly effective at blocking out sunlight and reducing indoor temperatures. Even though they are no longer popular, there’s a reason many homes have awnings over the windows\n\nGood insulation isn’t just for keeping warm in winter; it also helps keep your home cool in summer. Ensure your attic, walls, and floors are properly insulated to prevent cool air from escaping and hot air from entering. Sealing gaps and cracks around windows and doors with weatherstripping or caulk can also make a significant difference.\n\nInstalling reflective window film or solar screens can reduce heat gain from sunlight, making your home cooler and more energy efficient. For a longer-term investment, consider upgrading your windows. By doing so, you may be eligible for a tax credit of up to $600.\n\nAppliances and lighting generate heat, adding to the indoor temperature. To minimize this, avoid using heat-generating appliances during the hottest parts of the day. Cook with a microwave, toaster oven, or outdoor grill instead of using the stove or oven. When possible, use energy-efficient LED bulbs, which produce less heat than traditional incandescent bulbs.\n\nElectronics also generate heat, so turn off computers, televisions, and other devices when not in use. Consider unplugging chargers and small appliances to reduce heat output and save on energy costs.\n\nStrategic landscaping can provide natural cooling benefits for your home. Planting trees, shrubs, and vines around your house can create shade and reduce the amount of heat that reaches your home. Deciduous trees, which lose their leaves in winter, provide shade in the summer while allowing sunlight to warm your home in the winter.\n\nUsing ground cover plants instead of pavement or bare soil can also help cool the area around your home. A well-maintained lawn or garden can reduce the temperature and improve the overall comfort of your outdoor space.\n\nFinally, staying cool isn’t just about your home; it’s also about your personal comfort. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, as dehydration can make you feel hotter. Wear lightweight, loose-fitting clothing made of natural fibers like cotton, which allow your skin to breathe and help regulate your body temperature.\n\nTaking cool showers or using damp washcloths can provide immediate relief from the heat. Additionally, consider using a spray bottle filled with water to mist your skin throughout the day.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, homeowners can create a cooler, more comfortable living environment while keeping energy costs under control. With a bit of planning and some simple adjustments, it’s possible to beat the heat and enjoy the summer season to its fullest.\n\nValerie M.

With families moving before the school year, students seeking new accommodations, and professionals relocating for job opportunities, maintaining positive tenant relations is crucial. Here are some tips for fostering strong relationships with your tenants during this bustling time.\n\nOpen and Consistent Communication\n\nEffective communication is the cornerstone of any good relationship, and tenant relations are no different. Make sure you:\n\n• Respond Promptly: Address tenant inquiries and concerns swiftly to show that you value their time and issues — at least within 24 hours if not sooner.\n\n• Use Multiple Channels: Utilize emails, text messages, and phone calls to keep lines of communication open. Find out which channel your interface prefers and make a note always to use that one. Consider using a tenant portal for easy access to information and service requests.\n\n• Regular Updates: Proactively communicate about any upcoming maintenance work, changes in policies, or community events. This proactive approach helps in building trust and transparency and reduces surprises or feelings of not being kept informed.\n\nAddress Common Seasonal Issues\n\nAll seasons bring different challenges for renters. For example, Summer can bring maintenance issues, increased pest activity, and summer noise complaints. Be prepared to tackle these common problems:\n\n• Air Conditioning: Ensure all air conditioning units are functioning properly. Schedule regular maintenance checks in Spring and Fall to provide tenants with less risk of a breakdown. Consider sharing tips on how to efficiently use or maintain the AC in the rental to help prevent overloading the system.\n\n• Pest Control: Summer can see an increase in pest activity such as ants, roaches, beetles, mosquitoes, etc. As windows and doors are left open more frequently, these can get inside the rental. Remind tenants of best practices to keep pests at bay, such as properly storing food and disposing of trash outside on a regular basis, before the bin inside is full. Consider scheduling regular pest control treatments as a preventative measure.\n\n• Noise Management: With people naturally enjoying outdoor activities more frequently, noise levels can rise. Remind your residents to be good neighbors. Establish clear noise policies including shut-down times and communicate these to your tenants to ensure everyone can enjoy a peaceful environment.\n\nRecommend your renters inform adjacent neighbors well in advance of upcoming outdoor gatherings. This goes a long way and is appreciated. It also permits them to plan ahead to be out of their home during that time, or at least not plan a quiet day or evening in their own space when a potentially noisy event is happening next door.\n\nOffer Flexibility and Understanding\n\nSummer can be a hectic time for everyone, including your tenants. Show flexibility and understanding in these ways:\n\n• Know your Rights: Build policies or rules around your rights as a landlord while also keeping in mind the rights of your tenants.\n\n• Flexible Lease Terms: If possible, offer flexible lease start and end dates to accommodate varying schedules.\n\n• Grace Periods: Understand that moving can be stressful and sometimes delays happen. Offering a short grace period for rent payments or if their move is delayed. This is not uncommon during the peak season and your grace can go a long way in building goodwill.\n\n• Empathy and Support: Listen to your tenants’ concerns and show empathy. A supportive attitude can help in resolving conflicts amicably and maintaining a positive relationship. It can also prevent escalation of issues or having your renters seeking out different agencies or authorities to inquire or even report you as the landlord if they feel their rights are being ignored or otherwise feel taken advantage of.\n\nBy following these strategies, property managers and landlords can ensure a harmonious and productive peak rental season, leading to satisfied tenants and smooth operations.\n\nScott Bloom is owner and Senior Property Manager, Columbia Property Management.

For LGBTQ parents, this time can be both thrilling and challenging as you prepare your home and family for the new school year. Ensuring that your children are ready academically, emotionally, and socially is key, as is creating a supportive home environment. Here are some tips to help you navigate this transition smoothly and set your family up for a successful school year.\n\n1. Create a Structured Routine\n\nA structured routine can provide stability and predictability for children, which is especially important during transitions. Start by setting a consistent schedule for waking up, meals, homework, and bedtime. Gradually introduce this routine a few weeks before school starts to help your children adjust. Consistency is crucial, as it helps reduce anxiety and makes the transition back to school smoother.\n\n2. Set Up a Dedicated Study Area\n\nHaving a dedicated study space can significantly enhance your child’s ability to focus and succeed academically. Choose a quiet, well-lit area in your home where your child can do their homework and study. Equip this space with essential supplies such as pens, pencils, paper, and a computer. Personalize the area with items that your child loves to make it inviting and comfortable.\n\n3. Foster Open Communication\n\nOpen communication is vital in supporting your children’s emotional well-being. Encourage your children to share their thoughts and feelings about the upcoming school year. Address any concerns they may have, whether it’s about making new friends, dealing with bullying, or keeping up with schoolwork. Let them know that it’s OK to talk about their experiences and that you are there to support them.\n\n4. Promote Inclusivity and Diversity\n\nAs LGBTQ parents, fostering an environment of inclusivity and diversity is likely a core value in your household. Use the start of the school year as an opportunity to discuss these values with your children. Teach them about the importance of acceptance and respect for all people, regardless of their background or identity. This can help your children navigate social situations at school more confidently and with greater empathy.\n\n5. Connect with the School\n\nBuilding a relationship with your child’s school is essential. Attend orientation sessions, meet the teachers, and introduce yourself to school administrators. Share any specific needs or concerns you have regarding your child’s well-being. Many schools have resources and support systems for LGBTQ families, so don’t hesitate to inquire about them.\n\n6. Encourage Healthy Habits\n\nA healthy lifestyle is crucial for your child’s overall well-being. Encourage your children to eat nutritious meals, engage in regular physical activity, and get enough sleep. Healthy habits can improve concentration, mood, and energy levels, all of which contribute to academic success. Make these habits a family affair by incorporating healthy meals and activities into your daily routine.\n\n7. Plan for Extracurricular Activities\n\nExtracurricular activities are an excellent way for children to explore their interests, build skills, and make friends. Discuss with your children the activities they are interested in and help them sign up for clubs, sports, or other programs. Ensure that these activities are balanced with their academic responsibilities to prevent burnout.\n\n8. Support Mental Health\n\nMental health is just as important as physical health. Keep an eye out for signs of stress, anxiety, or depression in your children, especially during the back-to-school transition. Encourage open discussions about their mental health and provide reassurance. If necessary, seek the help of a counselor or mental health professional to provide additional support.\n\n9. Be a Role Model\n\nAs parents, your behavior and attitudes significantly influence your children. Be a role model by demonstrating resilience, empathy, and a positive attitude towards learning and growth. Show them how to handle challenges with grace and perseverance. Your children are more likely to adopt these behaviors when they see them modeled at home.\n\n10. Celebrate Achievements\n\nFinally, celebrate your children’s achievements, both big and small. Acknowledge their efforts and successes to boost their confidence and motivation. Celebrating milestones together as a family reinforces a sense of accomplishment and encourages a positive attitude towards school and learning.\n\nPreparing your home and family for the new school year involves more than just buying school supplies. It’s about creating a supportive and nurturing environment where your children can thrive academically, emotionally, and socially. By implementing these tips, LGBTQ parents can ensure their children are well-prepared for the challenges and opportunities that the new school year brings.

Now that the money is more expensive to get, many are sitting on the sidelines. But what is a missed opportunity to some, may be an opportunity to others. If a house was listed at $350,000 in the year 2020 or 2021, when the average 30-year mortgage rates were closer to 3% or 4%, that could also mean that the demand was higher. In terms of “supply and demand” – whenever the demand goes up for one house, the price of it will go up, too. So, if four people wanted that house in 2021, when they all had lower interest rate quotes from their lenders, then that house may have gotten bid up to closer to $400,000. Since the money was “cheap” – what did it matter if the loan was bigger? Or if the buyer used a combination of more cash and a bigger loan to compete with others and win the bidding process?\n\nBut now it’s 2024 and rates are closer to 7%. So maybe a $350,000 house will only get one offer. The money is more expensive, but the home price might be lower. Maybe a buyer will just have to offer the amount the seller is asking to get an accepted offer. Then they can do due diligence as buyers to have it inspected and negotiate any credits or repairs as they navigate toward the closing or settlement date. A higher rate, but a lower sales price may be the opportunity to look for now.\n\nIf you are a seller, you may want to consider what you think your home is worth, while looking at the data with your Realtor, and decide to price it not at the higher aspirational price you would love to get, but at the more realistic price you really hope you would get, in order to attract at least one good, solid buyer, who will help carry the whole sale across the finish line.\n\nThese days there is a lot of chatter over the idea of “What do I need a Realtor for if I have the internet and a basic knowledge of DocuSign?” And, as with most things in life, the decision in each circumstance is solely up to the person. However, many buyers have never navigated this process before, or are looking to buy in a new city, or a new part of town they haven’t lived in before. Many sellers remember the last time they bought that could have been 5-10 years ago. Markets change with latest economic indicators, the political cycles, the weather, and many other factors. A solid Realtor has been out in the streets with both buyers and sellers, and is hearing what many of them are thinking, THAT WEEK or THAT MONTH. Good Realtors are full of recent market knowledge, negotiation tactics, ideas and creative solutions to typical (and not so typical) snags in the process that could be due to the house itself, tax issues, county or city ordinances and regulations, or a plethora of other details.\n\nA good Realtor also understands the emotions that can get involved in a large transaction such as a home sale. The job of the Realtor can be to help navigate all parties to a successful settlement, while advising on a myriad of issues, utilizing deep listening skills, and offering emotional support, while a buyer and a seller navigate one of the largest, and at times complicated, transactions they may ever have.\n\nJoseph Hudson is a referral agent with Metro Referrals.
