Prospective students who are granted fee waivers must register for the Match by January 1, 2024. Any waiver not used by January 1, 2024 will be rescinded and may be granted by AGCPD to a different prospective student.\n\nProspective students who are applying for a Match fee waiver will be required to write a short essay and to upload at least one of the following documents demonstrating financial need:\n\nA copy of a letter verifying unemployment benefits received within the past two years.\n\nA copy of a letter on official letterhead from a government agency verifying that you or your family have qualified for public assistance based on low income criteria anytime within the past 5 years\n\nA copy of your financial aid award letter from another / previous institution dated within 5 the past years\n\nA copy of your approved GRE fee waiver (for tests taken within 5 years of the application deadline)\n\nA copy of your federal Student Aid Report (SAR) that verifies you qualified for financial aid within the past 5 years based on a family contribution of:\n\nNot more than $1,500 if the student is a dependent student\n\nNot more than $1,900 if the student is an independent student\n\nTo apply, click here: https://natmatch.com/gcadmissions/applicants/register.html\n\nPlease direct any questions about the Match Fee Waiver process or requirements to gcmatchwaivers@gcea.onmicrosoft.com\n\nOfficial transcripts are not required in order to apply to Sarah Lawrence College.
