The family are in London, preparing Grantham House for the busy social program. Not one to miss such a grand occasion, Martha Levinson arrives from New York with Coraâs recently disgraced brother Harold.

Meanwhile, Jack (Alec Baldwin) decides he must cheat mortality in order to teach his and Averyâs (guest star Banks) unborn son how to live. Elsewhere, Tracy (Tracy Morgan) is determined to be there when his wife gives birth, and a mystery man is making sure Kenneth's (Jack McBrayer) work at \"TGS\" is still getting done.

Brian Williams and Kelly OâDonnell guest star as well.\n\nYou Would Bang Her?\n\nA focus group of guys weighs in on the show, God helps Amy through a herpes scare, and a new secretary struggles to keep people from barging into her boss's office."
