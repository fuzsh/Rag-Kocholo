        "text": "Maurice Bernard Gran (born 26 October 1949, in London, England) is an English writer and one half of scriptwriting duo Marks and Gran. He co-wrote the sitcoms The New Statesman, Birds of a Feather and Goodnight Sweetheart with Laurence Marks. Their theatre works include Dreamboats and Petticoats, Save The Last Dance For Me and Dreamboats and Miniskirts.[1][2]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn to a Jewish family, Gran lived in Finsbury Park Road as a child and his father was the manager of a fabric shop in Soho.[3] He attended William Ellis School, a grammar school for boys in Highgate. He then rose to be the manager of the Job Centre in Tottenham, whilst writing scripts with Laurence Marks which they submitted to the BBC.\n\nThe duo had begun writing together after they met at a discussion group for writers that was held within the British Drama League.[4] They were given the opportunity to write a radio show for Frankie Howerd after a chance meeting with Barry Took.[5] Gran is also the co-author of Prudence at Number 10, a fictional diary supposedly written by Gordon Brown's P.A.\n\nWriting credits\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction Notes Broadcaster The Marti Caine Show\n\n5 episodes (1980)\n\nBBC2 Roots\n\n6 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1981)\n\nITV Holding the Fort\n\n20 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1980–1982)\n\nITV Shine on Harvey Moon\n\n25 episodes (1982, 1984–1985, 1995)\n\nITV Roll Over Beethoven\n\n12 episodes (1985)\n\nITV Relative Strangers\n\n3 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1985–1987)\n\nChannel 4 The Bretts\n\n3 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1987)\n\nITV Alan B'Stard Closes Down the BBC\n\nComic Relief special (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1988)\n\nBBC1 Young, Gifted and Broke\n\n7 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1989)\n\nITV Snakes and Ladders\n\n7 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1989)\n\nChannel 4 Birds of a Feather\n\n129 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1989–1994, 1996–1998, 2014–2017, 2020)\n\nBBC1/ITV Bullseye!\n\nFeature film (co-written with Leslie Bricusse, Laurence Marks, Nick Mead and Michael Winner, 1990)\n\nN/A So You Think You've Got Troubles\n\n6 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1991)\n\nBBC1 Screen One\n\n\"Wall of Silence\" (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1993)\n\nBBC1 Get Back\n\n10 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1992–1993)\n\nBBC1 Love Hurts\n\n30 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1992–1994)\n\nBBC1 The New Statesman\n\n29 episodes (co-written with Laurence Marks, 1987–1992)\n\nITV\n\nBBC1 A.
