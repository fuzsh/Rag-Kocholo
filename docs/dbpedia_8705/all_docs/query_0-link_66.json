        "text": "UCARE Ambassadors represent UCARE whenever and wherever they can.\n\nThey attend UCARE events, help with raising our profile, promote our work, use their social networking site to introduce us to new supporters and generally increase awareness of UCARE and issues surrounding urological cancers.\n\nJames Alexander-Sinclair\n\nJames Alexander-Sinclair is one of the foremost garden designers in the United Kingdom. He has designed gardens from Cornwall to the Western Isles and from London to Moscow.\n\nHe is also an award winning writer, a compelling speaker, frequent broadcaster and an elected member of the Council of the Royal Horticultural Society.\n\nHe has regular columns in Gardeners World magazine and Gardens Illustrated. He writes a blog for Fine Gardening in the USA and contributes a video diary to Crocus.

Other highlights include presenting series three of Small Town Gardens, contributing to Gardeners World and most recently as a judge in the new BBC2 series, The Great Chelsea Garden Challenge.\n\nJames has filmed some expert advice on planting UCARE tulips…\n\nMark Diacono\n\nMark Diacono runs Otter Farm, the UK's only climate change farm. As well as planting and maintaining the farm's vinyards, forest garden and vegetable patch, he also leads the Garden Team at Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage.\n\nMark is a food writer, grower and photographer, who has published seven books. In 2015, he won the André Simon Food Book of the Year 2014[1] for his book A Year at Otter Farm.\n\nTim Henman\n\nTim Henman is one of Britain’s most successful male tennis players of the Open era. He was Britain’s No. 1; reached four Wimbledon semi-finals and peaked at No 4 in the ATP World Rankings in a career that spanned 14 years, beginning in 1993 and lasting until his retirement from the sport in 2007.\n\nTim won a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and played Davis Cup for Great Britain from the age of 19. Tim won 11 ATP World Tour titles in the course of his career. Tim’s interests still include all sports and, in particular golf, where he plays off scratch.\n\nSince his retirement, Tim has been a member of the BBC Wimbledon commentary team which he joined in 2008. He is also heavily involved with ‘HSBC Road to Wimbledon’, a grassroots tennis programme which sees over 20,000 boys and girls from all over Britain and India play in tournaments throughout the summer in pursuit of playing at Wimbledon. Tim is a member of the AELTC Committee of Management and founded his own charity the Tim Henman Foundation in 2000.\n\nLaurence Marks\n\nLaurence Marks and Maurice Gran, the creators of Birds of a Feather, started writing together in the Seventies, penning several stillborn sitcoms. Then in 1978 Laurence found himself on a train opposite legendary comedy writer Barry Took. They began talking, and Barry generously offered to look at the lads’ efforts. He was sufficiently impressed to introduce them to Frankie Howerd, and within weeks they were writing the bulk of a Frankie’s radio series, whilst trying to hold down day jobs.\n\nAfter this baptism of fire they went full-time and migrated to television. Their first comedy series, Holding the Fort, was a top ten hit. They followed this up with the hugely popular Shine On Harvey Moon, one of TV’s first “comedy dramas”. This is where they first met Linda Robson and Pauline Quirke. Linda played Harvey’s daughter, Maggie, and Pauline played Veronica, Maggie’s best friend. It was clear from the start that Linda and Pauline had a magical rapport, and Laurence and Maurice could see that the girls had the ability to star in their own comedy series.\n\nAfter Harvey Moon, Laurence and Maurice worked in Hollywood on an American TV series. They returned home to join forces with Rik Mayall to create The New Statesman, an acclaimed political satire that won the BAFTA for Best Comedy, as well as International Emmy, and goodness knows what else.\n\nIn 1989 Laurence and Maurice set up Alomo Productions with Allan McKeown, one of TV’s smartest producers. Alomo’s first production was Birds of a Feather, for the BBC. This of course starred Linda and Pauline, with Lesley Joseph, who Laurence and Maurice had also worked with some years earlier.\n\nBirds of a Feather was a massive hit from the start, reaching audiences of nearly 20 million viewers. The show ran for ten years, amassing over 100 episodes. During the Alomo decade, Laurence and Maurice still found time to write/produce a host of other hit series, including Goodnight Sweetheart, Unfinished Business, Get Back, and Love Hurts, as well as Mosley, a controversial mini-series about Sir Oswald Mosley, Britain’s would-be Fuhrer. They also wrote Wall of Silence, a TV murder movie set in the orthodox Jewish community.\n\nIn 1993 they were awarded the British Academy Writers’ Award, British television’s highest honour. They surpassed this in 1997 when they featured in their very own South Bank Show, and were invited to give the prestigious McTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh Television Festival.\n\nAlways lovers of the theatre, a chance meeting with Sir Alan Ayckbourn led them to write their first stage play, Playing God, which premiered at the Stephen Joseph Theatre Scarborough in 2005. The following year they adapted The New Statesman for the stage – the first time they had rewritten a television hit for the theatre, but not the last. The New Statesman toured to great acclaim, and had a riotous Christmas residency in the West End.\n\nIn 2008 they fulfilled another ambition when they wrote the book for hit West End musical Dreamboats and Petticoats, for which they received an Olivier Award nomination. Four years later it continues to run in the Playhouse Theatre, London, and a second production is now touring nationally.\n\nIn 2010, their stage play, Von Ribbentrop’s Watch, received its critically acclaimed world premiere at the Oxford Playhouse. In 2011 the producers of Dreamboats and Petticoats invited Laurence and Maurice to write the book of a new musical, Save The Last Dance For Me, which is currently rocking the nation.\n\nThis live theatrical production of Birds of a Feather has been written with Gary Lawson and John Phelps, writers of many Birds TV episodes. It is Laurence and Maurice’s latest theatrical offering. They’ve had a wonderful time revisiting Chigwell and working with the Birds again, and when the show became a national sell-out it seemed that it was time to bring it back to television.\n\nThis they did and in January 2014 Birds of a Feather became ITV’s biggest viewed comedy show in 24 years, reaching an almost unbelievable audience of 12 million.\n\nSince there have been a further two series of Birds of a Feather, each finding an audience that ITV could have only dreamed of.\n\nIn 2105 Laurence and Maurice became castaways on Desert Island Discs. They were jointly castaway on adjacent desert islands, with four gramophone records each. We had always felt that this Robinson Crusoe-like fate remains one of the highest accolades the British establishment can bestow, far more satisfying than a mere knighthood. Though if Jeremy gets to Number 10, who knows.\n\nAnd in the late autumn we were awarded the accolade of Living Legends. During an astonishing afternoon, it was as if we were on four consecutive episodes of This Is Your Life. We were interviewed at length on stage by Louis Barfe, a frighteningly well informed cultural historian, and several clips of our work were shown, one of them, an untransmitted pilot entitled Still William, never seen before and unlikely to be seen again.\n\nLiterally dozens of stars – and when we say “literally” we mean literally – gave up their Sunday afternoon to join us on stage and reminisce about the shows we made with them. Many were kind enough to say we played a crucial part in their careers. Of course, they all played a crucial part in ours. Kenneth Cranham, Matthew Kelly, Michael Troughton and Nigel Planer were among those happy to praise us to our faces. Many others, including Patricia Hodge, Michael Maloney, Liz Carling and David Cardy were happy to just be in the audience…apparently.\n\nAfter the love bombing, Joan Bakewell conducted a question and answer session, with her usual warmth and aplomb. Since Joan helped to invent cultural broadcasting it was no surprise how well she was received by an audience delighted have so many luminaries sitting among them.\n\nThe event climaxed when two-thirds of the stars of Birds of a Feather, Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph, came on stage to present us with our Living Legends awards, which entitle us to free entrance to all cinemas, theatres and sporting venues throughout the world, and blue plaques at a home or workplace we may have lived in.\n\nRead more...
