        "text": "In the 2010s, as playlists swelled with unrelated tracks and algorithms shot listeners off in all directions, the full-length release started to feel on the verge of becoming an antique. But great artists will always want to create works that expand their visions, and this decade, they found new ways to push the LP forward. They pioneered the visual album, perfected the surprise drop, and stretched running times as long as they pleased, no longer beholden to physical media. So the form endures, and at the end of a turbulent decade, it is thriving. Here are our top 200 albums of the decade.\n\nFor more about how we put together this list, read this letter from our editor-in-chief Puja Patel.

Storming from the stoops of Harlem to the bustling storefronts of Canal Street are the gaptooth spitfire Wiki and the languid daydreamer Hak, whose relentless banter never loses steam. Producer Sporting Life’s abstract, sample-heavy soundscapes conjure the chaos of the modern concrete jungle—a sound that evokes the dissonance of ’70s no wave and the experimentation of ’90s hip-hop. Together, Ratking paint a compelling city portrait: “Remove Ya” addresses its rampant stop-and-frisk abuses, while the jazzy “Snow Beach” chastises gentrification for poisoning the Big Apple. So It Goes shows NYC as it really is: pretty, gritty, and gross, forever restless and forever alive. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n199.\n\nWu Lyf: Go Tell Fire to the Mountain (2011)\n\nIn the late 2000s and early 2010s, plenty of indie bands sprang up with crystalline guitars, cryptic lyrics, and an aversion to sharing basic biographical details. But those other acts didn’t have a singer like Wu Lyf’s Ellery Roberts. Go Tell Fire to the Mountain supported Roberts’ shredded growl with patient post-rock builds, and the result was pure catharsis. These songs were so cuttingly earnest—“I love you forever,” Roberts rasped on the opener, “L Y F”—that it almost came as no surprise when the group broke up afterward. Who could sustain such intensity; who would want to? It wasn’t always easy to tell what Roberts was hollering about, but Wu Lyf’s best songs, like the sweeping “We Bros,” could have you chanting along, caught up in a frenzy of oddball solidarity. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n198.\n\nJean Grae / Quelle Chris: Everything’s Fine (2018)\n\nOn Everything’s Fine, Jean Grae and Quelle Chris tackle a range of modern topics—from the mistreatment of black people by the police to the ever-growing influence of Instagram models—through dense skits, outrageous parodies, and sharp rapping. The conversations they begin don’t always reach a conclusion, but they’re thoughtful, and the duo never sacrifices style for substance. Grae is the steady force and more of a traditionalist: She’s technically precise, while Chris is the wild card. But despite their differences, they complement each other perfectly, whether rapping or producing. That balance carries over to their wide array of guests who all rise to meet their energy. Yet, in the end, the album is about Jean Grae and Quelle Chris, who make it clear that they’re not content to be “fine.” –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n197.\n\nFatima Al Qadiri: Genre-Specific Xperience (2011)\n\nFew documents of global music this decade were as interesting as the producer Fatima Al Qadiri’s Genre-Specific Xperience, an icy, minimal exercise in translating and flattening microgenres—juke, dubstep, digital tropicália—into a cohesive statement that tied to her international upbringing and youth as a gamer. Just five songs long, the record was high-minded—its videos, helmed by highly regarded artists like Ryan Trecartin and Sophia al-Maria, debuted in New York’s New Museum—but it also provided a template for what a cerebral dancefloor could look like. –Julianne Escobedo Shepherd\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n196.\n\nPortal: Vexovoid (2013)\n\nSome 21st-century death metal acts embraced digital technology and the clarity it brought; imagine listening to a jackhammer busting through concrete in hi-def. That modern crispness is nowhere to be found in the eruptive music of Portal, who instead update old-school death metal by making their music sound not like just one tsunami but dozens of them. The Australian group successfully shaded the lines of all instruments into one cumulative blast, with everything melting together: the slow, guttural growling of lead vocalist The Curator, drummer Ignis Fatuus’ rumbling percussive churn. (All the band members are anonymous and perform masked.) There are glints of familiar metal tropes—epic guitar solos, sci-fi-homage lyrics—but by boiling these elements into a tarry, punishing brew, Portal bring metal back where it started, as the sound of something terrifying, exciting, and new. –Matthew Schnipper\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n195.\n\nDowntown Boys: Full Communism (2015)\n\n“Why is it that we never have enough with just what's inside of us?” screams Victoria Ruiz at the start of “Monstro,” the highlight of Downtown Boys’ cyclonic debut album, Full Communism. It’s a fair question to throw at a capitalist country that's hell-bent on extracting every modicum of value from its people, especially its young and marginalized. With true punk fury—and the occasional stellar use of saxophones— Downtown Boys clear themselves a space to rage: Joey L DeFrancesco cracks bedrock with his guitar chords, while drummer Norlan Olivo agitates the whole band into breakneck urgency. With Full Communism, Downtown Boys established themselves as the harbingers of righteous frustration at a system that keeps people pinned down in a cycle of exploitation. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n194.\n\nTitus Andronicus: The Monitor (2010)\n\nThrow together the Civil War, Bruce Springsteen’s New Jersey, and Titus Andronicus singer Patrick Stickles’ self-imposed exile from mainstream American culture—plus some bagpipes—and you get The Monitor, the blueprint for a decade of emo rock bands. In Stickles’ fevered imagination, everything is a metaphor for everything else: high school is a battlefield, his anxiety and malaise is Abraham Lincoln’s, and tramps aren’t born to run as Bruce said, but instead were born to die. As the rhythm section storms along, Stickles screams himself hoarse about accepting your given lot in life and the folly of using spite for fuel. On one song’s chorus, he screams “You will always be a loser” over and over, which at least gives the losers an anthem, too. –Jeremy D. Larson\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n193.\n\nLil Peep: Hellboy (2016)\n\nHellboy was released while Lil Peep was a teen, just a few years before he died. The mixtape is focused on pain and how he hoped his might dissipate, and how he figured it probably wouldn’t. That he wasn’t wrong makes listening to the album feel like hearing a very loud alarm with a signal you cannot heed. The isolation at the core of his music wasn’t particular to him; he was just particularly good at distilling it. About the insistence of his depression, despite newfound success, he raps, “I used to wanna kill myself/Came up, still wanna kill myself.” It’s particularly bittersweet that he made it sound so tantalizing, the sound of his voice rich over the borrowed riffs of emo bands and electronic music producers. If you’ve ever felt that way, his music assures you that you’re not alone—and if you haven’t, he gives you a glimpse of what that suffering feels like. –Matthew Schnipper\n\nListen: SoundCloud\n\n192.\n\nKelela: Cut 4 Me (2013)\n\nWhen Kelela debuted with Cut 4 Me, she solidified an experimental bass movement into something that felt human, as if a team of extraterrestrial scientists finally made contact. The mixtape was welded by a group of producers from UK imprint Night Slugs and their L.A. sister label Fade to Mind who bent elements of drum’n’bass, dubstep, techno, grime, and footwork into sparse soundtracks for the club underground. Kelela was the skeleton key to the crew’s disparate styles, a siren who could unlock a matrix of synths, shattering glass, and sputtering bass to reveal the soul hiding in the pauses between. It’s rare when something is both so clearly reflective of its time and predictive of the future, and Cut 4 Me was just that. –Puja Patel\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n191.\n\nKate Bush: 50 Words for Snow (2011)\n\nOn Kate Bush’s only studio album of the decade, she sings about catching a snowflake out of the sky, warning a hunted yeti, and sleeping with a dissolving snowman. And she does so wide-eyed and full-heartedly, even painstakingly. 50 Words for Snow, named for the myth that the Inuit have such a vocabulary, boasts all of her trademark magical realism, fantastical lovers, and far-flung settings, but the songs are more quietly ambitious than past works—almost like chamber pieces. The material is more wistful: Where Bush’s best singles have often been about having something beautiful that you’re about to lose, much of 50 Words for Snow addresses things that are already lost. The wistfulness is often self-referential, as on “Snowed In at Wheeler Street,” a tale of star-crossed lovers with lyrics threaded with references to her old songs. It's music that rewards close attention in an age where that is increasingly rare. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n190.\n\nHuerco S.: For Those of You Who Have Never (and Also Those Who Have) (2016)\n\nHuerco S. got his start crafting techno that erased most of the things that typically make dance music tick: beats, basslines, forward drive. Within a few short years, those subtractive processes yielded For Those of You Who Have Never (and Also Those Who Have), an album of barely-there ambient music. Twirling grainy wisps of synthesizer around a hollow core, it’s hardly more substantial than wind chimes caught on corroded magnetic tape—and all the more captivating for it. Churning loops bubble up into a fizz of tape hiss, sounding like a lo-fi cassette dub of Berlin ambient-techno pioneers Basic Channel; bell tones and tinny synth riffs stumble down a delay-pedal hall of mirrors. It’s almost impossible to fix any of these ethereal pieces in your memory, but as long as the disc is spinning, it is an uncommonly enveloping listen. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n189.\n\nMiranda Lambert: The Weight of These Wings (2016)\n\nFor the first half of the decade, Miranda Lambert was a country superstar with a string of radio hits, a recurring spot on The Voice, and a picture-perfect marriage to fellow singer Blake Shelton. But when they divorced in 2015, the breakup encouraged her to go down a darker, more existential path. Her ambitious double album The Weight of These Wings carries on in a grand tradition of messy relationship statements: It has the grit of Tom Petty’s Wildflowers and the uncertainty of Bruce Springsteen’s Tunnel of Love, wrapped up in Lambert’s fiery, down-home charm. Its songs are torch ballads and highway anthems with a live band that feels borne of late night jam sessions, raw and unglamorous. For Lambert, redemption comes from buying a cheap pair of plastic sunglasses, by spending late nights alone at the bar, in knowing that she alone controls her destiny. Legend has it, she hung up on the first interviewer she spoke to about the record—the question was about Shelton’s new partner, Gwen Stefani—and decided that she would do no press surrounding the album, letting the music speak for itself. “All you had to do was listen,” she said. And the music says it all. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n188.\n\nPusha-T: Daytona (2018)\n\nAfter the breakup of the Clipse, his duo with his brother, Pusha-T spent this decade trying to find his footing as a solo rapper. He’s had plenty of highs—his verse on “Mercy,” all of “Numbers on the Board”—but he’s also had releases that didn’t live up to the high standard he once set. Daytona is the full realization of Pusha as a star. The drug dealing raps that fans first fell in love with on Clipse’s Hell Hath No Fury are just as rich here as he settles into a new corporate villain persona. Executive produced by Kanye West, Daytona closes with “Infrared,” an end-to-end thriller, famous for the petty shots at Drake that lit a new flame to one of this century’s defining rap beefs. And yet, for all the storylines and drama that surrounded Daytona, the music rises above. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n187.\n\nIceage: Beyondless (2018)\n\nWith limbs flailing and sweat matting his hair, Iceage frontman Elias Bender Rønnenfelt grew up before our eyes. He was only 18 at the top of the decade, when he and his childhood friends were dubbed the Next Great Punk Band, and across four albums and countless shows, they put in the work needed to uphold the claim. Beyondless, the quartet’s most recent LP, saw them once again expanding their sound in service of their ever-growing ambition, this time incorporating manic violins, honky-tonk pianos, and, for the first time, a guest vocalist in Sky Ferreira. The permanently anguished Rønnenfelt offers up a clear example of his dark philosophy in the cabaret stunner “Showtime,” narrating the onstage suicide of a handsome young singer. Over drunken drums that lead the rest of the band along by a rope, he snarls into the mic, grappling with the very public line of work that’s made him a minor heartthrob among the indie set. This is the latest, greatest Iceage: a bit more romantic but as fiercely droll as ever. –Noah Yoo\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n186.\n\nVarious Artists: Mono No Aware (2017)\n\nAssembled by PAN label head Bill Kouligas, the compilation Mono No Aware offered a referendum on what “ambient music” means in the streaming era and a who’s-who primer on the genre’s emerging voices. An immediate standout was Yves Tumor with the gossamer synths and vérité chatter of “Limerance.” But at 16 tracks and nearly 80 minutes, the comp feels like a fun house with trapdoors at every turn: Open one and tumble into the breathy murmurs and glacial drifts of Malibu’s “Held.” Open another and hear Kouligas’ “VXOMEG” morph from harsh squall to blurry drones. Enigmatic and patiently unfolding, Mono No Aware stands as an argument for appreciating everyday subtleties in an era prone to bombast. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n185.\n\nHailu Mergia: Lala Belu (2018)\n\nReissues of obscure albums ran rampant this decade, thanks in part to labels following the YouTube algorithms that guided listeners to styles they may have otherwise never found. But the MP3 blog-turned-label Awesome Tapes From Africa bucked that trend, diligently digging through physical artifacts to discover true gems. Take keyboardist/composer Hailu Mergia, a star in his native Ethiopia in the ’70s who moved to Washington, D.C. and became a taxi driver. Discovery of an old tape in Bahir Dar, a tourist hotspot in northern Ethiopia, in 2013 ignited Mergia’s dormant career in the West, capped by Lala Belu, his first new album in decades. On it, Mergia still sounds spry and roving on piano, accordion, and synthesizer, his melodic sense as acute and mesmerizing as ever. With Mergia at the helm of a jazz trio moving as a crackling, telepathic entity, Lalu Belu astonishes not by being a nostalgia trip but by sounding triumphantly in the present. –Andy Beta\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n184.\n\nSoccer Mommy: Clean (2018)\n\nClean is a breath of fresh air that will also knock the wind out of you. Nashville singer-songwriter Sophie Allison was far from the only former home-recorder making bittersweet indie pop in 2018, but she did it her own way, and with impressive craft. Released when Allison was 20, these endlessly replayable songs have the prickly slouch of ’90s indie rock, but with wide-eyed vulnerability and bright melodies in place of ironic distance; the sharp eyes and conversational delivery of vintage Taylor Swift, but with more of real life’s mess. It’s tempting to dwell on just the first three tracks: the relationship dysfunction of dreamy ballad “Still Clean,” the vicarious imperturbability of swirling anthem “Cool,” and, especially, the damn-she-just-did-that Stooges reversal “Your Dog.” But the rest is also revelatory; the subdued finale “Wildflowers,” where Allison intones that she “found God on Sunday morning, layin’ next to you,” is a sigh of relief that leaves you gasping for more. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n183.\n\nElysia Crampton: American Drift (2015)\n\nElysia Crampton’s experimental electronic music unearths deep personal truths in surprising places. Her earlier work as E+E turned heads by finding something sublime and alien in edits of pop hits by the likes of Justin Bieber. Crampton’s first album under her own name, American Drift, is a four-song, 30-minute set bringing together crunk, trap, cumbia, spoken word, crickets, and blaring radio station identifications. American Drift runs deeper when you learn about the ideas that inform it: The Bolivian-American producer described the album as an investigation of her adopted home state Virginia’s history, of brownness, of colonialism. As the bubble for mass-market electronic dance music was about to burst, this individualistic approach distinguished Crampton as a renegade on the rise. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen: SoundCloud\n\n182.\n\nG.L.O.S.S.: Trans Day of Revenge (2016)\n\n“T.D.O.R.” usually stands for Trans Day of Remembrance, a time to pay tribute to victims of violence in the community. G.L.O.S.S., the Olympia, Washington-based hardcore punk band, flipped the R to “revenge” on the only EP they released before breaking up in 2016. (Their acronymic name was equally bold: \"Girls Living Outside Society's Shit.\") With Trans Day of Revenge, G.L.O.S.S. railed against the cultural tropes that so often diminish a trans woman's life into a narrative of muted tragedy. Inflamed and incandescent, lead singer Sadie Switchblade's yowl scorches anyone who would tell her to shut up, stay docile, wait her turn. “When peace is just another word for death/It’s our turn to give violence a chance,” she screams in the opening bars against the roar of distorted electric guitar, just before a typhoon of drums crashes in. Continuing in the riot grrrl tradition of flashing sharpened teeth at embedded patriarchal violence, G.L.O.S.S. burned bright in their brief time together, leaving behind a relic of pure and righteous anger. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen/Buy: Bandcamp\n\n181.\n\nJamila Woods: LEGACY! LEGACY! (2019)\n\nOn her second album, R&B singer Jamila Woods grapples with the present by looking to the past. Each track is an ode to one of her inspirations, most of them women of color. Sometimes she writes directly from their perspective, but more often she draws from her subjects’ lives and adapts their words to her own life. She channels Eartha Kitt’s self-assuredness, then Frida Kahlo’s sense of balance in romantic relationships; Zora Neale Hurston reminds her that she is allowed to contain multitudes. Pulling from so many texts and thinkers, LEGACY! LEGACY! is theoretically dense, but it flows like honey. Woods’ voice is rich and velvety, and the album’s grounding in emotional truths makes it accessible and immediate. –Vrinda Jagota\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n180.\n\nChvrches: The Bones of What You Believe (2013)\n\nOn paper, it shouldn’t work: Two grizzled veterans of dour, navel-gazing Glasgow post-rock bands team up with a young singer raised on third-wave emo. They make bright, shiny synth-pop that is entirely self-written and self-produced, but is so immaculately constructed, it feels like it was built by a team of scientists. And yet, in 2013, The Bones of What You Believe served as the ideal wake-up call for those stumbling blearily out of the chillwave daze. On soaring songs like “The Mother We Share,” “We Sink,” and “Recover,” Lauren Mayberry’s crystalline voice deconstructs fractured relationships with beguiling poetics and brutal honesty, while the music swells with a mastery of dancefloor dynamics that nods to New Order and Depeche Mode. On their debut album, Chvrches ushered in a new era of dance pop with an indie soul. A thousand Spotify-core bands bloomed in their wake, but none could ever capture the same magic. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n179.\n\nShabazz Palaces: Black Up (2011)\n\nThere isn’t as much room for mystery in music now as there was in 2009, when Shabazz Palaces crept onto the scene. Two EPs, sparse cover art, conceptual experimental music—at first, this is all we knew. By the time Black Up dropped, we knew the group was led by Ishmael Butler (formerly of Digable Planets) and multi-instrumentalist Tendai Maraire, but their biographies didn’t matter; they had effectively let their music do the talking. Black Up is drowned in murky instrumentals and bombastic, introspective rhymes. The sounds flirt with jazz, but also root themselves in a firm understanding of silence, or the sparse magic of simplicity. The songs teem with unexpected climaxes, like when “Free Press and Curl” veers straight into gospel, or the way \"Recollections of the Wraith\" seems to wrestle with itself before settling on a rush of soaring vocals in the chorus. From great mystery exploded an album of impossible vision. –Hanif Abdurraqib\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n178.\n\nSavages: Silence Yourself (2013)\n\nThe post-punk hero of the decade wore pink stilettos onstage and made monogamy sound as appealing as anthrax. Jehnny Beth, frontwoman of Savages, sang with a sinister and a heavy-lidded hauteur, adding omnidirectional disdain for all things patriarchal and vanilla. Below her, terse, voluble bass and severe toms also nodded back to another era, one more restrictive to women as bold as the ones in this London band.\n\nSavages’ debut came almost secondary to their quick mythology—their live show was explosive from the jump, a salve for those who missed the dark, sweaty scenes that predated them. But Silence Yourself carries every bit of that adrenaline; in its coiled, sparking guitars and rabid screams, it warns of the dangers of technology while weaponizing its potential. Too loudly to be ignored, it disputes complacent norms: Maybe marriage isn’t idyllic, but asphyxiating. Maybe an endless stream of information isn’t edifying, but toxic. And maybe a clarinet solo does belong in the year’s most casually brutal rock album. Suddenly, the alternatives sounded ancient. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n177.\n\nMargo Price: All American Made (2017)\n\nMargo Price toiled for years to become an overnight sensation: Her acclaimed debut Midwest Farmer's Daughter, released in 2016 on Jack White's Third Man Records, came out after she had spent more than a decade in the Nashville trenches. But that album was a Trojan horse for the thornier sentiments she would smuggle onto the airwaves and stages with her follow-up, All American Made. Price mingles the political and the personal until they're indistinguishable on songs like “Heart of America” and the barnstormer “Cocaine Cowboys,” leading a band that draws on old-school honky tonk rhythms without coming across the least bit revivalist. “Pay Gap” couches its income disparity blues in flourishes of accordion and Lone Star guitar, while the Dylanesque title track wanders a desolate America as Price wonders if her pain—all our pain, actually—might be specific to this place. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n176.\n\nGil Scott-Heron: I’m New Here (2010)\n\nWhen Gil Scott-Heron sampled Kanye West, five years after having his own “Home Is Where the Hatred Is” hook used by West on Late Registration, it felt like a kindly nod from a mentor. Scott-Heron, whose spoken-word vocals so wisely distilled America’s racial and social turmoil in the ’70s and early ’80s, had already served as an invaluable forefather to hip-hop. He had nothing to prove. But even at 62, Scott-Heron still had his ear to the ground. On I’m New Here, his 13th and final studio album before he died in 2011, he doesn’t just swerve into icy, minimalist electronics for the first time—he, along with producer Richard Russell, uses them to bring new friction to his aching, burnished voice. Over 15 tracks of wry philosophizing and solemn reflection, Scott-Heron honors everything in his rearview, from the strong women who shaped his character to the many mistakes that cost him dearly. He seems deeply lonely at times—a secluded insomniac who’s seen it all and knows change is stubborn to come—but at times, he also sounds reinvigorated. It’s a beautiful note he bows out on. –Stacey Anderson\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n175.\n\nJessie Ware: Devotion (2012)\n\nArriving at the same time as industrial-strength belters like Adele and Florence Welch, fellow UK singer-songwriter Jessie Ware was an anomaly. After collaborating with post-dubstep acts SBTRKT and Joker, Ware synthesized her love of American hip-hop and R&B with dance music. The result was a preternaturally poised debut filled with a headrush of affection, all delivered in Ware’s elegantly airy voice. Devotion flits between sumptuous pop-R&B and sweeping power ballads, but it’s never missing Ware’s gentle, discerning touch: a surprisingly earworm-y Big Pun sample speeds behind “110%” (later replaced by a soundalike following a clearance dispute with Pun’s estate), while the anthemic “Wildest Moments” gave both Adele and Welch a run for their Top 40 money. Much of Devotion went on to soundtrack TV dramas and romance movies, which feels like a badge of honor: Ware provided a masterclass in mining the ups and downs of romance with an artful, featherlight touch. –Eric Torres\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n174.\n\nSharon Van Etten: Are We There (2014)\n\nAre We There was a great deepening—of Sharon Van Etten’s emotional range, of the power of her songwriting, and of the potency of her voice, which became an alarmingly physical instrument. The Brooklyn singer-songwriter’s vocals shake her body like a mighty engine, and on primal moments like “Your Love Is Killing Me,” it feels like we were hearing Van Etten literally come apart as she sings. She claws the walls off every word.\n\nHer fourth album, Are We There, was the first to rise from classic soul more than indie rock; the faint organ licks and slow, patient drums are designed to center a torrential voice, the kind that stands pleading at the footlights. That is Van Etten, and her performance is transfixing, exhausting, cleansing. –Jayson Greene\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n173.\n\nHurray for the Riff Raff: Small Town Heroes (2014)\n\nAlynda Lee Segarra had been releasing albums under the name Hurray for the Riff Raff for years before her ATO Records debut, Small Town Heroes, introduced the Bronx-born, Louisiana-based singer-songwriter to the world at large. A former freight train jumper and street busker, Segarra collects sounds and melodies like postcards from across America, mixing rhythmically lurching New Orleans R&B, rural blues, and Appalachian stomps into a new form of roots music. Small Town Heroes consists mostly of traveling songs—reflections on life as a touring musician—but also the thoughts of a woman who has spent most of her adult existence in transit. She's seen jubilation, tribulation, and cold-blooded murder, but Segarra keeps wandering, as though she can't wait to see what's over the next hill or around the next corner. “We might not be here when next year comes,” she sings on “Small Town Heroes.” “You better live it like you’re on the run.” –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n172.\n\nPopcaan: Where We Come From (2014)\n\nOn Where We Come From, Jamaican singer Popcaan’s soothing melodies shine over slick production from Dre Skull, Dubbel Dutch, and other in-demand beatmakers. Together, they jump from silky love ballads to grind-ready bangers. “Love Yuh Bad” is the album’s centerpiece, as Popcaan’s lovestruck lyrics anchor a hip-shaking dancefloor groove. Just as great are the moments when Popcaan fuses the rich sounds of his home with traditional pop bounce, like the scintillating title track. But through all the genre bending and lane-switching, Popcaan is clearly, deeply proud of his dancehall roots. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n171.\n\nJPEGMAFIA: Veteran (2018)\n\nBaltimore rapper JPEGMAFIA’s darkly humorous—and occasionally troll-ish—personality is on full display throughout his gleefully unfiltered breakthrough album, Veteran. The Air Force vet’s chaotic stream-of-consciousness flow includes odd references—like to Macaulay Culkin, and to the wrestling theme song that doubles as his producer tag—as well as things he detests, like Morrissey (on a song called “I Cannot Fucking Wait Til Morrissey Dies”). Sometimes he spits with aggression over an airy instrumental ready to be embraced by the SoundCloud community, other times he scream-raps about Tinder and political figureheads over noise music. No matter the specific sound or subject matter, this scatter-brained album can’t help but leave you energized and ready to fight. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n170.\n\nSkee Mask: Compro (2018)\n\nOn the surface, Brian Müller’s breakthrough album as Skee Mask is an attempt to meld furious drum patterns with gorgeous ambient passages, à la Aphex Twin. But keep listening, and Compro becomes more complicated. The German producer uses the last 20 years of electronic music as a massive sandbox from which to create textured tracks that are familiar enough to be enjoyable, yet mutate enough to constantly surprise. Album opener “Cerroverb” is built on empty space: Cosmic blips burble and then fade away abruptly, like the track is decomposing as you listen. Later, “50 Euro to Break Boost” offers up a gritty breakbeat smeared with foggy synths that hover like a beautiful, toxic rain cloud. With Compro, Müller doesn’t build a world as much as he soundtracks its weirdly beautiful end. –Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n169.\n\nParamore: After Laughter (2017)\n\nIt turns out, the incredibly personal connection that a teenage Hayley Williams of Paramore created with her fans back in the Warped Tour days—which many adult critics didn’t acknowledge at the time, as though her band’s pop-punk contained frequencies only teenagers could hear—was strong enough to last the decade and dynamic enough to grow and deepen with age and maturity. Call After Laughter “emo for adults”: Williams wrote an album that feels like a perfect window into the inner turmoil that defines millennials’ state of extended adolescence. Maybe modern Paramore feels as urgent as old Paramore did once because the confusions of young life have lingered longer than expected; maybe no one really ever grows up at all. Or maybe the feeling of release—of clenching your fists and singing along with “Forgiveness” in your bedroom—is just an essential and eternal pleasure, one conjured better by no one than Williams. –Alex Frank\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n168.\n\nJulianna Barwick: The Magic Place (2011)\n\nSinger and ambient composer Julianna Barwick has mentioned the importance of seeing Empire of the Sun, Steven Spielberg’s epic war film, at a formative age. Most crucially, she remembers its score by John Williams, which featured a boys choir singing the Welsh lullaby “Suo Gan.” Her breakthrough album, The Magic Place, summons similar moments of peace amid chaos. Her primary mode of expression is her voice and a loop pedal, layered to feel completely enveloping: the reverb-coated sound of singing and breathing, echoed until you forget where it’s coming from. Arriving early in a decade that would find other young artists drawing inspiration from the once-maligned New Age genre, the album represented a shift in how the underground could embrace the celestial. As the world was getting louder, Barwick was building her own sanctuary, full of light and space and strange enough to feel like home. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n167.\n\n(Sandy) Alex G: DSU (2014)\n\nAlex Giannascoli could never be called a frugal songwriter. Undeniably prolific by 2014, he’d amassed a cult fanbase but most of the world didn’t yet know him. DSU, his fifth proper album as Alex G, changed this. Self-recorded in his Philadelphia home, the characters in its 13 songs are often bleak—lovesick fatalists, regretful junkies, and self-proclaimed emotional voids—but in his hands, they transform into slightly haunted, subtly profound stories. His songs are built around catchy, intimate melodies evocative of Elliott Smith at his poppiest, with disorienting flourishes of freakiness, like a pitch-shifted baby voice or sharp blasts of dissonance. Insular without being inaccessible, addictive while still being idiosyncratic, DSU affirmed that the decade’s most singular voices were probably holed up in their bedrooms, waiting to be heard. –Quinn Moreland\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n166.\n\nNicki Minaj: The Pinkprint (2014)\n\nOn her third studio album, The Pinkprint, Nicki Minaj came closest to putting it all together: rapping and singing, EDM and hip-hop, seriousness and ridiculousness. She pared back her straight pop overtures like “Starships” and put her audacious versatility on full display. The Pinkprint’s all-you-can-eat buffet includes the raw autobiography of “All Things Go,” the campy raunch of “Anaconda,” and the Ariana Grande-featuring “Get On Your Knees,” as well as riotous flow showcases like “Want Some More.” Eccentric production is her co-star: There’s the Enya-inspired minimalist synth pop of “I Lied,” the fiery pan-Caribbean groove of “Trini Dem Girls,” and the feel-good dubstep-pop of “The Night Is Still Young.” No one will mistake The Pinkprint for a tightly-constructed masterpiece like its namesake, Jay-Z’s 2001 album The Blueprint, but the album helped add depth and dimension to Minaj’s image and blaze a stylistic trail for future rappers like Cardi B. It would also prove to be the creative high point in Minaj’s decade. –Jason King\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n165.\n\nJay Som: Everybody Works (2017)\n\nEverybody Works, the Bay Area singer-songwriter Melina Duterte’s first proper album as Jay Som, vaulted her to the main stages and into a new indie-rock vanguard. The songs represent a dizzying crash course in everything that makes the genre great. First single “The Bus Song” veers from coffeehouse strums to gleaming trumpets, from the unspoken dynamics of two friends’ particular relationship, to universally understood concerns like the odor of public transportation. Duterte’s vocals, hushed and conversational, hold everything together: Even when the arrangements plant a sly toe in near-funk territory, it sounds small enough to fit in your pocket and large enough to change your world. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n164.\n\nHop Along: Painted Shut (2015)\n\nListening to Frances Quinlan fray her vocals is like watching someone rip a gnarly run in their black tights: Instantly, the whole outfit is rendered punk. On Painted Shut, the breakthrough album from her band Hop Along, Quinlan is on glorious display; her voice scrapes viscerally against the word “picture” in “I Saw My Twin,” the phrase “to post a motivational video” is briefly lent the velocity of an asteroid barreling toward earth in “Happy to See Me.”\n\nBeing able to wring emotion out of any word is a gift, but then Quinlan has to rub it in by being one of the most compelling storytellers of her generation, too. In “Powerful Man,” she feels guilty for catching a father beating his child and not pressing the issue with an overwhelmed teacher. Elsewhere, she sings from the perspective of the ’60s folk musician Jackson C. Frank, alluding to tragic moments from his biography and invoking the general unfairness of life with a metaphor about horseshoe crabs. All the while, the rest of the band meets Quinlan’s sharp turns with their own clear-eyed intensity: Her brother Mark Quinlan takes cues from the simple but forceful percussion of grunge drummers like Dave Grohl, while the enthusiastic yet angsty guitars channel classic indie and pop-punk alike. In a decade where the lo-fi solo project often dominated indie music, Hop Along made a strong case for honest-to-goodness rock bands, one pummeling performance at a time. –Jillian Mapes\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n163.\n\nMeek Mill: Dreamchasers 2 (2012)\n\nIn May 2012, Meek Mill effectively broke the rap internet: Dreamchasers 2 caused the mixtape site DatPiff to crash en route to becoming the most downloaded release in its history. The project marked a turning point in the Maybach Music Group signee’s career, when he moved out of Rick Ross’ shadow and deepened his sound. Most notably, on “Amen,” with Drake and Jeremih, the Philly rapper slowed down his flurry of a flow; he had the wealth of time on his side.\n\nBut even on a project this victorious, legal woes haunted Mill. His contemplative rework of Drake’s “The Ride” devotes many lines to Philadelphia assistant district attorney Noel DeSantis, who would face off against him in the courtroom seven months after DC2’s release, when Judge Genece Brinkley prohibited Meek from traveling outside of his hometown to perform. (Brinkely’s decisions on Mill’s legal problems would only grow more troublesome.) To the hip-hop world, DC2 made Meek untouchable, as powerful a star as he’d ever been. But inside the criminal justice system, he was at the mercy of others, forced to fight like he’d been doing since he was a teenager. –Ross Scarano\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n162.\n\nSturgill Simpson: Metamodern Sounds in Country Music (2014)\n\nSturgill Simpson’s music is rooted in modern country, but he’s also part of the proud heritage of “cosmic country,” a spacey descendant of Rhodes scholar Kris Kristofferson and Kahlil Gibran-quoting Willie Nelson. On his breakout album, Metamodern Sounds in Country Music, Simpson braided together no less than Jesus, Buddha, and “reptile aliens made of light” in the very first song. From there, the Kentucky native managed to dig deeper into his earthy roots of while also wandering even further into galaxy-brain thought. Simpson still refuses to be penned in and Metamodern Sounds in Country Music is when he started to elevate. –Andy Beta\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n161.\n\nThe 1975: I like it when you sleep… (2016)\n\nThe 1975 have come a long way over the last decade. Matty Healy and co. have morphed from a spunky buzz band with a few bratty, glossy singles into the act that best captures the anxious modern condition—or, at least, has the ambition to try. The band’s second album, I like it when you sleep…, is the moment when their skills caught up with that ambition. Instead of sticking with sleek Phoenix-esque pop-rock, the band opens themselves to a wide range of influences: the sleek pop of the ’80s, neo-soul, shoegaze, and heartfelt acoustic balladry. Not every single lyric landed, but they met each clunker with a line that captured exactly what it’s like to live in this moment. Take this one at the center of “A Change of Heart”: “You said I’m full of diseases, your eyes were full of regret/And then you took a picture of your salad and put it on the internet.” That perfect balance between anguish and absurdity is what makes the 1975 feel so relevant, and so resonant. –Jamieson Cox\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n160.\n\nNoname: Room 25 (2018)\n\nNoname once quipped that her style is “lullaby rap,” in reference to her soft timbre and relaxed cadence. It was a great tweet, but lullabies didn’t deserve the co-sign: Room 25 isn’t putting anyone to sleep. She breathlessly details her inner life and the world with singular introspection and grace. Choice words for the prison system, wasteman boyfriends, pandering politicians, and Noname herself give the record a patina of seriousness, but she is as amused as she is agitated. From the frank sex raps to the constant boasts to the in-your-face cleverness, a giddy energy animates Room 25 and sells its free spirit. The album is the sound of a rapper realizing her powers and testing them for herself and no one else. When she says, “You really thought a bitch couldn’t rap?” it feels like both a wisecrack and a statement of purpose. –Stephen Kearse\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n159.\n\nPallbearer: Foundations of Burden (2014)\n\nArkansas doom metal band Pallbearer rose above the pack through sheer ambition. The emotional intensity and velocity of their songs suggest open spaces instead of dimly lit basements, singing along over solitary headbanging. For all the misery and pain conjured by their music, played at slow speeds with infinite layers of guitars, their records can feel oddly uplifting. Some of that is due to the soaring vocals of Brett Campbell, but the real magic lies in the band’s songwriting. Their epic song lengths become templates for dazzling melodies, classic rock choruses, and solos as memorable as the hooks. On their sophomore album, Foundations of Burden, Pallbearer cleaned up their sound, stripping away the murk of earlier releases. Near the end of the record is “Ashes,” the atmospheric interlude that’s a prerequisite for any serious doom metal album. Far from filler, it’s a masterfully composed, pop-leaning ballad. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n158.\n\nSleigh Bells: Treats (2010)\n\nThe intro to Treats is exhilarating: two quick cherry-bomb pummels, guitars and brass blown up huge enough to make engineers quiver and listeners thrill. The sound is physical, designed to rattle rooms. It wasn’t much like the previous music made by Derek Miller, who was in a metalcore band, or Alexis Krauss, who in her teens was part of a Cheetah Girls-ish girl group. In fact, it wasn’t like much else at all.\n\nThe newness of Treats lends itself to metaphors: It’s like you took an old issue of YM magazine, shot it, sampled the gunshots, then wrote lyrics out of the tattered snippets about braces, illicit drugs, “dumb whores, best friends,” and beach bashes. It was pure pop as concentrate. Come 2019, Treats still sounds like nothing else around, but for a different reason—unlike most pop music today, it has negative chill. (It also doesn't sound like Sleigh Bells these days, who have inevitably done a sonic pivot.) But echoes of it can be found: PC Music took the art-pop roots and a few of the sounds—the sonar-like pings of “Run the Heart,” the Jock Jams synths—and made them more candy-colored. Artists like Lorde and Billie Eilish revel in Sleigh Bells’ distortion, and in their upending and mocking the bubblegum tropes that, in another era, they may have become. –Katherine St. Asaph\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n157.\n\nThe 1975: A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships (2018)\n\nThe 1975’s Matt Healy described his internal monologue—actually out loud—to the New York Times thusly: “I’m Jim Morrison. Am I Jim Morrison? I’m sorry that I’m Jim Morrison. I’m [expletive] Jim Morrison!” On A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, Healy’s relentless self-belief paid off, his flailing coalesced into dramatic gestures, and he finally nailed the part he auditioned himself for. He is magnetic and empathetic and tender and unbearably silly, all at once and all of the time, and so is the music, which smears together Auto-Tune, orchestras, glam-rock guitars, and entire showrooms full of 1980s synths.\n\nAcross the album’s 15 songs, Healy wants to verbalize every racing thought in your fevered brain: your boredom, your callow judgments, your sudden bouts of existential terror and your equally sudden bursts of inexplicable lust, your opinions on how whiskey tastes and the sound of your Twitter feed imprinting itself on your neural cortex. On an album stuffed with wry quotables, the funniest might be “I’ve just got one more thing to say.” –Jayson Greene\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n156.\n\nJenny Lewis: The Voyager (2014)\n\nJenny Lewis’ third solo album is a nostalgic swan dive into past lives, as sprawling as Lewis’s own impressive turn from child actor to rock poet. Scattered memories appear like flipped tarot cards—plane tickets to Paris as a teenager, the Twin Towers falling, a punch in the drywall during an argument—melting into a colorful but weary montage over sunny ’80s new wave and ’70s rock. Some song hit close to home, like the dryly funny “Just One of the Guys,” a meditation on sexism and ageism in music. Others are far more distant, like Lewis gushing about a future wedding and the faded romance that follows it on the deceptively bubbly “Love U Forever.” Armed with a perfect rainbow Nudie suit, Lewis asserted herself as a mature, somewhat wistful rock veteran, and took her rightful place as a bona fide solo star. –Hazel Cills\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n155.\n\n21 Savage / Metro Boomin: Savage Mode (2016)\n\nIn the middle of the decade, Metro Boomin was the most bankable producer in hip-hop. He helped auteurs like Future flesh out their sounds and kept Drake on top of the world with beats that were pulsing, punishing, and ahead of the curve. So it’s strange that the greatest thing he’s done sounds nothing like his catalog of louder hits, and sounds like virtually none of the other mainstream rap produced this century.\n\nSavage Mode plays like a dream sequence, where 21 Savage’s half-whisper sinks into what sounds like fraying, muddy silk. It’s not dissimilar to ambient music, but things that exist as atmosphere are seldom this unsettling. Together, Metro and 21 make having sex in lavish hotels with jewelry swinging against your chest sound like a completely foreign experience—not just the price of the room or the chains, but the sensation of having things touch your neck, the unnatural feel of the bedsheets. It’s a terrible, tranquil body high that ends too soon. –Paul A. Thompson\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n154.\n\nMica Levi: Under the Skin OST (2014)\n\nWith her soundtrack to Jonathan Glazer’s 2013 body horror film Under the Skin, the electronic musician and composer Mica Levi drew on the dissonance of avant-garde icons like John Cage and Gyorgy Ligeti, adding her own, distinct chill. Throughout the score, violas, cellos, and drum machines are slowed down to grim effect, perfectly mirroring Scarlett Johansson’s performance as a seductive, murderous alien. Beyond amplifying the visuals, Levi explored the pure physicality of noise: the thrum of blood rushing to the head, the prickling of small hairs, a soft touch, or the sensation of an otherworldly lifeform drinking you down to your last drop. –Andy Beta\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n153.\n\nPurple Mountains: Purple Mountains (2019)\n\nDavid Berman’s final album followed a long period of silence, and his isolation echoed through the music. His comeback after abandoning Silver Jews in 2009 found him contemplating the struggles of maintaining relationships, faith, confidence, and hope as you get older. “Things have not been going well,” he announces wearily in its opening track, and the songs that follow prove this to be something of an understatement. Although bleak, the music never wallows, thanks to the cozily upbeat arrangements from his new backing band (featuring members of Woods) and his peerless lyrics. His writing remained as complex, funny, and smart as any of his classic work, from the songwriting-as-therapy spiral of “Storyline Fever” to the color-coded purgatory in “Margaritas at the Mall.” In the wake of Berman’s death—just a month after the album’s release and days before a scheduled tour—fans lit up the internet telling stories, sharing photos, and citing his best lyrics, many of which came from these songs. His voice never felt louder or more vital. –Sam Sodomsky\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n152.\n\nArctic Monkeys: AM (2013)\n\nThe influence of hip-hop acts—especially Mike Skinner’s the Streets—could be heard in the lyrics of Arctic Monkeys right from the start. But it wasn’t until their fifth studio album, AM, that the Sheffield band fully reflected that influence in their music. On AM, they bent these sounds to their will so casually it was breathtaking. Who could have foreseen that the Monkeys’ spartan guitar riffs would sit so well over a muscular, Dr. Dre-style beat on “Why’d You Only Call Me When You’re High?” Or that Alex Turner’s wily vocal hooks on songs like “Do I Wanna Know?” could have so much in common with the lyrical strut of the best MCs? AM was a giant, cocksure beast that seemed entirely happy with its place in the world, making it one of the few indie rock hits of the 2010s that sounded like it genuinely belonged in the decade’s pop mainstream. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n151.\n\nLady Gaga: The Fame Monster (2009)\n\nAt first, Lady Gaga seemed like a slightly smarter-than-usual dance-pop hopeful and nothing more. But then came “Bad Romance.” A gothic psychodrama draped around a titanic club banger, accompanied by an instantly iconic music video in which she stoically burns a man to death, the song announced Gaga as a true force to be reckoned with.\n\n“Bad Romance” kicked off The Fame Monster, a collection of eight songs released as a deluxe edition of Gaga’s 2008 debut album, The Fame. (Yes, we know: The Fame Monster was technically released in late November 2009. But for something that cast such a long shadow over this decade, we’re making an exception.) Other than the supremely fun, Beyoncé-featuring “Telephone” (originally written for Britney Spears!), none of these songs sounded like anything else released at the time. They’re bizarre and jarring, full of references to death, dangerous sex, Hitchcock movies, and eating brains. (There’s also “Speechless,” an unabashedly retro power ballad that Meat Loaf would have killed for.) The Fame Monster’s release kicked off an arms race of pop kookiness: Suddenly, it seemed like everyone from Katy Perry to Nicki Minaj to Kesha was falling all over themselves to out-weird each other. But nobody’s freak flag ever flew higher than Gaga’s. –Amy Phillips\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n150.\n\nPlayboi Carti: Playboi Carti (2017)\n\nBefore he emerged from the shadows with his eponymous debut mixtape, Playboi Carti was an enigma: The Atlanta native's SoundCloud page was a secret hiding in plain sight, spoken about with gatekeeping whispers, and his leaked tracks were passed around the internet like contraband. Playboi Carti brought substance to the growing mythology surrounding him, as he established himself as a rapper willing to bend genres and switch styles on a whim. On the tape, Carti emphasized his narcotized delivery and ad-libs while adding polish to his dreamy sound with help from producer Pi’erre Bourne. Songs like the hypnotizing “Magnolia” brought Carti’s ability to create an entire aura around snippets of songs to the mainstream, making rap that was just as enjoyable in a 30-second Instagram clip as it was blaring in full from a car speaker. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n149.\n\nMac DeMarco: 2 (2012)\n\nLove him or hate him, Mac DeMarco’s influence on an entire generation of bedroom-pop acts and would-be scum-rock wunderkinds is tough to overstate. His breakout album, 2, established his penchant for cigarettes, zany antics, and quietly compelling songwriting. Throughout, the then-22-year-old Canadian waxes drolly on addiction and suburban sedation, intertwining his laid-back voice with flanged guitar work. His devil-may-care attitude can be seen in live videos from the period, where he would walk out with a beat-to-hell guitar that was falling out of tune, its un-clipped strings dangling from the headstock, and proceed to make not giving a shit look like the most alluring—and even admirable—way of life. This was when he was at his most free, before he was saddled with the expectations of being indie rock’s class clown, before his music took him to high places no one could have ever foreseen. –Noah Yoo\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n148.\n\nNicolas Jaar: Space Is Only Noise (2011)\n\nAt the beginning of the 2010s, the echoes of peak chillwave lingered in the air, and a sample of rushing water typically indicated the onset of a feel-good, uncomplicated song. Nicolas Jaar's debut album begins with splashing sounds, but it quickly sidesteps the path toward easy bliss. There's menace lurking beneath the producer's work, a ghostly energy that opens up in his understated beats and sinewy basslines. Percussive guitars and close-miked vocals bleed into waves of reverb. During the early-’10s glut of bro EDM and bubbling chillwave, Jaar found magic in restraint, leaving enough space in his music to give the impression of a nefarious presence always lurking around the corner, of a young artist eager to play the notes that aren't there. –Sasha Geffen\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n147.\n\nThe National: High Violet (2010)\n\nHigh Violet has the swimmy quality that comes with making sense of a new reality. It was the first National album to really incorporate guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner’s experimental tendencies, making what was solid and plainly beautiful on Boxer fractious and unreliable—not a fake empire, but a treacherous one. Frontman Matt Berninger feels separated from lovers, from home, from the person he was and the one he is becoming. To survive, he makes depression, debt, and self-destruction into sublime cosmic jokes at his own mopey, myopic expense. It was the last time Berninger’s lyrics were perfectly congruent with the times, an existentialist eclipse before he became more character than chronicler. Once adulthood fits, it’s hard to remember how it once didn’t. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n146.\n\nSheer Mag: Compilation (2017)\n\nThere are two kinds of punk bands: nihilists and life lovers. Philly group Sheer Mag have spent their five-year existence attesting to the power of the latter. With shimmying, riffy protest rock and the coolest of neo-heavy-metal-style band logos, Sheer Mag became underground heroes this decade for their sticky songwriting and their principled independence. Like hardcore icons Black Flag and Minor Threat before them, Sheer Mag laid the foundation with a string of EPs, then rounded them up with the no-filler Compilation, still their high-water mark. It’s full of songs about gentrification, crooked cops, slumlords, yuppies, old-fashioned heartbreak, and other trials and tribulations that eat away at Generation Y’s more critically minded members. The music can be aching, swaggering, and celebratory—but it all feels designed to help us live. –Jenn Pelly\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music\n\n145.\n\nChief Keef: Finally Rich (2012)\n\nWhen Chief Keef’s major-label debut came out in 2012, it was scrutinized to a degree rap hadn't seen since the moral panic days of the ’90s. Here was a hardened teen from the most neglected corners of Chicago making music that reflected—and, yes, romanticized—the violence he came up around. Keef was more clever and more in control of his vision than his detractors gave him credit for, though, and his minimalist wordplay served to emphasize his monumental hooks. Finally Rich was drill’s great crossover event, polishing the rapper's nihilistic imagining of trap just enough for the radio without compromising its fundamental menace. Even after Interscope and the A-listers who'd been so eager to jump on his remixes cast him aside following this album, Keef continued to make inventive, influential music throughout the decade. But Finally Rich remains his pinnacle, and a best-case scenario for what can happen when a street-tested sound meets a big-time budget. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n144.\n\nPJ Harvey: Let England Shake (2011)\n\nOn her eighth studio album, released two decades into her remarkable career, Polly Jean Harvey explores England’s military history, from World War I to the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, with sharp, journalistic observance and poetic grace. Moving from English folk to Jamaican reggae, and from dark comedy to just darkness, she examines the nature of conflict itself and the raw human tragedy that lies at its center. A thread of weary nostalgia weaves its way through these 12 brief but devastating songs, shot through with despair at human inability to learn from our mistakes. It’s an album that hits right in the gut, timeless yet horribly timely, locally specific yet globally relevant. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n143.\n\nWeyes Blood: Titanic Rising (2019)\n\nOn Titanic Rising, Natalie Mering’s fourth album as Weyes Blood, she combats dread through empathetic songs that are propelled by a masterful understanding of lush, ’70s pop harmonics. Mering’s willowy voice gives her warnings about the most hellish aspects of life a graceful air, as best exemplified on Titanic Rising’s penultimate track, “Picture Me Better,” a letter to a friend who died by suicide during the recording of the album. “Waiting for the call from beyond,” Mering lilts, as old-world Hollywood strings swell underneath her. “Waiting for something with meaning to come through soon.” –Noah Yoo\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n142.\n\nFennesz: Agora (2019)\n\nUsing computers to turn sounds into alien shapes now feels like a given, but at the turn of the century, guitarist and producer Christian Fennesz’s audacious noise- and pop-smearing work suggested strange, glitchy new worlds. Two decades on, the Austrian ambient artist suddenly found himself without a studio space, so he resorted to doing what so many teens do, jamming away in his bedroom on headphones. But even in such homely environs, he operates like an old master, patiently layering guitars and electronics one downstroke at a time until it all accrues into a vast canvas of distorted bliss. Agora boasts both the most expansive and most finely detailed soundscapes of his career. Contemplative and visceral, blurred and acute, the album upholds Fennesz as the 21st century’s finest romantic futurist. –Andy Beta\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n141.\n\nRick Ross: Rich Forever (2012)\n\nRick Ross’ best work happens when he’s completely, utterly divorced from reality. Case in point: His 2012 mixtape Rich Forever, in which the former prison guard fully embraces his villainous kingpin persona, casting himself as the hardboiled antihero of his own blockbuster action franchise. Forgoing the decadent, red-velvet soul of his studio albums, Rich Forever emphasizes tight, IMAX-sized instrumentals. From the searing synthesizers of “High Definition” to the brutalist, grinding trap of “Yella Diamonds,” nearly every beat is as mammoth and monumental as Ross’ brontosaurus grunt. And at a time when rappers like Drake and Kendrick were prioritizing grounded, personal statements, Ross doubled down on fantasy. There isn't a single claim on Rich Forever that a fact checker could verify, and the mixtape is better for it. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen/Buy: Tidal\n\n140.\n\nParquet Courts: Sunbathing Animal (2014)\n\nIn an era when indie rock got cozier than ever with the pop mainstream, Parquet Courts preferred to be left alone. After breaking through with 2012’s delightful and funny Light Up Gold, their follow-up album, Sunbathing Animal, made the band an unlikely pillar of modern American rock. The record cultivates an air of hyper-rational individuals thwarted by modern mania; its surrealist screeds transform, upon inspection, into pleas for sanity. Andrew Savage and Austin Brown emit a flurry of barely formed questions: How do you navigate the enduring challenges of love and passion amid labor exploitation, political cruelty, and the specter and spectacle of American violence? The music runs then crawls, plays dumb then flaunts frills. To hide genius hooks in songs so slack is audacious, the mark of a band either certain you’re paying attention or the complete opposite. –Jazz Monroe\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n139.\n\nEmeralds: Does It Look Like I’m Here? (2010)\n\nWith Does It Look Like I’m Here?, the experimental Ohio trio Emeralds ascended toward more melodic, starry atmospheres without losing any of the density and power of their previous sound. In shorter songs full of rising arpeggios and drifting guitar lines, they layered loops and doused the stereo spectrum in glittering accents. Channeling the synth explorations of the ’70s and the dreamy ambience of the ’80s, they presaged the New Age pop revival that would flourish throughout the decade. Though they would only make one more album together, the subsequent solo work of Mark McGuire, Steve Hauschildt, and John Elliot continued to uphold the idea that soothing, space-bound music can be just as edgy and complex as harsh noise. –Marc Masters\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n138.\n\nAlabama Shakes: Sound & Color (2015)\n\nAlabama Shakes’ second album begins with a song about an astronaut who has been shot into space on a mission to find a new planet where the human race can settle and start over. And thus, Sound & Color subverted almost everything we’d come to expect about a band that had been positioned as saviors of back-to-basics rock’n’roll: what frontwoman Brittany Howard was singing about, how the music sounded, even which planets they visit. There’s something alien about songs like “Future People” (about meeting the you of 10 or 20 years on), but Howard’s concerns can be earthly as well: losing a lover with a Mickey Mouse tattoo on “Miss You,” paying the water and power bills on “Don’t Wanna Fight.” The Shakes groove and vamp like the Swampers from Mars, with Howard shouting and crooning and squealing like Bowie by way of Etta James. Sound & Color is grounded in Southern soul, but the band’s gaze is fixed on the heavens. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n137.\n\nA$AP Rocky: LIVE.LOVE.A$AP (2011)\n\nLIVE.LOVE.A$AP feels like one of the first hip-hop projects that could not have existed without the internet. Marked by A$AP Rocky’s straightforward delivery and “I’m the shit” attitude, the 2011 mixtape is rooted in the rapper’s Harlem upbringing, but the sound of the project is pulled from scenes across the country that Rocky and his crew fell in love with online: The chopped vocals are true to Houston’s lean-infused drip, the dark themes are directly influenced by SpaceGhostPurrp’s Miami-based Raider Klan, and the cloudy production is built on a style that was thriving in California through artists like Main Attrakionz and Lil B. Along with producer Clams Casino, Rocky brought a new flavor to these styles—not rehashing existing ideas, but entwining them with his own to create something unbound by regional lines. –Alphonse Pierre\n\nListen: DatPiff\n\n136.\n\nTim Hecker: Ravedeath, 1972 (2011)\n\nWhen Tim Hecker released Ravedeath, 1972 in 2011, critics interpreted the Canadian producer’s clash of organic pipe organ and synthetic corrosion as a comment on music’s chances of survival in a digital world. In 2019, that matter seems superficial compared to Ravedeath’s unavoidable contemporary resonance. Its grimy, eddying tundras are nothing less than an omen of our promised apocalypse, where decay has defeated living matter and noise has drowned out signal. The music, however, remains gorgeous and rooted in the metaphysical. While the forlorn cirrus wisps that writhe and glimmer through the static don’t offer anything so trite as optimism, they cast the ruins in the sobering relief that elevates Ravedeath, 1972 from ambient reverie to enduringly urgent confrontation. –Laura Snapes\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n135.\n\nFleet Foxes: Helplessness Blues (2011)\n\nThe making of Fleet Foxes’ second album was fraught, due in no small part to the success of their first. Robin Pecknold and co. wondered how to trust their instincts without leaning on formula, and fretted about the reception that awaited their new music. These worries form a backdrop for Helplessness Blues, the unmistakable work of uneasy hearts. Starting with the scene-setting intonation that opens the record (“So now I am older”), Pecknold’s melancholy tenor heralded a decade of discourse about millennial anxiety. He paints an indelible portrait of fading young-adulthood—diverging from the path set by parents, searching for place and purpose, falling out of relationships that have dried up. Above all, Pecknold questions his ability—and will—to be anything other than, as he describes it on the title track, “a functioning cog in some great machinery.” These complicated fears offer a foil to the swollen sound that envelopes them. Fleet Foxes’ maximalist folk, with harmonies stacked high as mountains and reverb that could fill caverns, makes feeling small seem epic. –Olivia Horn\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n134.\n\nM83: Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming (2011)\n\nAround the time Anthony Gonzalez wound down the tour for 2008’s Saturdays = Youth, the M83 frontman left France and moved to Los Angeles. The city inspired his biggest, best, and most cinematic album, Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming. These songs are steeped in a kind of magical realism stemming from the intensity of adolescent emotions, full of heart-on-sleeve choruses, slap-bass funk, vintage synth swells, and a desire for home or love or something just out of reach. The album contains a loose narrative that has something to do with brothers and sisters, but you don’t need to know any of the story to get swept up in the neon-lit groove of “Midnight City” or swept away by the tidal wave that is “Steve McQueen.” Gonzalez’s nostalgia is very specific, very personal, and very idiosyncratic, which makes Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming sound so universal and inviting, not to mention sturdy enough to withstand the wave of imitators that sprang up in its wake. –Stephen Deusner\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n133.\n\nFrankie Cosmos: Zentropy (2014)\n\nGreta Kline once quipped that the title of Zentropy, her full-band studio debut as Frankie Cosmos, meant a descent into “zen-ness”: an embrace of one’s surroundings. It’s a clever way of approaching the album, which collapses notions of big and small, sophisticated and rudimentary, serious and funny, until there’s little choice but to accept them all as the same. Zentropy doesn’t feel longer than its 10-song, 17-minute run time, but it feels like more. Tempos careen and stutter unpredictably, lyrical motifs bleed between tracks. Gigantic feelings go supernova out of notebook-worthy musings on being “the kind of girl buses splash with rain,” yearning to go dancing, and mourning the death of a dog. Beneath this, Klein filters a ’60s girl-group pop sensibility through the New York deadpan of ’00s anti-folk and the pajama-party whimsy of ’90s K Records. Later Frankie Cosmos albums would go longer, and run no less deep, but with Zentropy, Kline made us one with everything. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n132.\n\nAmen Dunes: Freedom (2018)\n\nThe fifth album from Damon McMahon’s hallucinatory rock project Amen Dunes pumps the vapors of bygone rock jams into half-seen visions of the past. McMahon has an eye for the antihero and his vulnerabilities, the fading conscience of modernity. “Pride destroyed me, man/Til it took ahold of me,” he sings over cresting bass on the luscious “Miki Dora,” a sympathetic homage to the surfer icon of hedonism and chaos. A master of the lyrical arched eyebrow, McMahon is capable of conveying total honesty in one line and ironic remove in the next. His band builds a warmly reverbed atmosphere, steadying psychedelic swells and loops against murky rhythm until the air feels rotten with insinuation. Freedom doesn’t feel like an album from this decade; it feels like an album suspended in time. –Anna Gaca\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n131.\n\nRun the Jewels: Run the Jewels 2 (2014)\n\nRun the Jewels were rap’s most thrillingly unlikely success story this decade: El-P, an indie-rap lifer and Killer Mike, an Atlanta rap vet finding new inspiration in each other. When they joined forces, they rapped as if their lives (and ours) depended on it. Run the Jewels 2 was where their uncanny chemistry reached Anarchist Cookbook proportions. It’s an album of virtuosic vulgarity, a pair of underdogs seizing their moment and reaching new heights, both in their cadence-shifting bars and El’s arena-quaking productions. But beneath the bluster, what sets RTJ2 apart is its humanity and prescience: on police brutality, on #MeToo, and on the burgeoning friendship between two world-hardened idealists. No wonder Marvel gave them their own comic books. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n130.\n\nTame Impala: Lonerism (2012)\n\nAt its core, Lonerism is a tightly wound, deeply internal album about what it means to always feel like an outsider. That it gained such a huge following and catapulted Tame Impala into the mainstream is ironic, but not surprising. Throughout the record, classic rock tropes are updated with reverence, memorable riffs are tossed off like they’re in endless supply, and moments of bliss allow for at least an illusion of catharsis: The tongue-in-cheek single “Elephant” is so sure of itself that it practically swaggers, while “Feels Like We Only Go Backwards” is built around blown-out cymbals and a communal hook that happens to be all about frontman Kevin Parker’s own indecision and dashed hopes. If there’s one idea to take away from Tame Impala’s second album, though, it’s that everything repeats itself and nothing is ever really in our control. Frustration never sounded so good. –Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n129.\n\nVarious Artists: Bangs and Works Vol. 1: A Chicago Footwork Compilation (2010)\n\nIn dance music circles, it’s hard to think of a more important recent document than Bangs and Works. While Chicago footwork had been percolating for over 20 years at the time of the compilation’s release, for many people outside the local scene, it proved to be their first experience of the genre’s marriage of breakneck beats with haunting soul samples. Alongside searing examples of the form by pioneers like RP Boo and DJ Rashad, who would go on to take footwork around the world, there’s a DJ Nate track that verges on the spiritual, and a succinct meditation on loving support by Tha Pope. A decade on, Bangs and Works still sounds as fresh and invigorating as the first listen. –Ruth Saxelby\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n128.\n\nRadiohead: A Moon Shaped Pool (2016)\n\nWhen A Moon Shaped Pool entered the world in May 2016, many of the horrors Radiohead had spent more than two decades warning us about were coming to fruition. Campaigns for Brexit and Trump were spreading odious strains of nationalism. The Earth’s temperature was reaching precipitous new highs. Nefarious companies were harvesting data from tens of millions of Facebook users in order to undermine American democracy. The record also arrived amid acute personal tragedy for Thom Yorke, who had announced a separation from his partner, Rachel Owen, the year prior. (Seven months after its release, Owen died following a long battle with cancer.) It’s no wonder that, according to one scientific analysis, A Moon Shaped Pool was found to be the infamously bleak band’s most depressing album.\n\nAnd yet the record does not wallow. The stubbornly forward-facing quintet allows itself to look back—most notably with “True Love Waits,” a live fan favorite since the mid ’90s, finally put to tape in the studio—while avoiding self-parody or indulgence. On the luminous ballad “Daydreaming,” Yorke sounds like he’s levitating when he sings, “We are just happy to serve... you.” It’s a nod to the symbiotic bond Radiohead keeps with their listeners through the worst of times, a bond that this album elegantly upholds. –Ryan Dombal\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n127.\n\nCar Seat Headrest: Teens of Denial (2016)\n\nLike his indie rock forefathers in the Replacements, Car Seat Headrest mastermind Will Toledo sounds sincerely undecided about embarking on any kind of grand search for purpose. He feels like a walking piece of shit, which is basically the default state for modern young people. On Teens of Denial, following a prolific run of Bandcamp releases, Toledo comes off like a passive avatar for the feelings he’s channeling. Even when he shakes off the doldrums long enough to rouse his audience into a singalong, it’s with a self-conscious—but nonetheless empowering—line like “I’ve got a right to be depressed!” The beautiful thing about this record is how it doesn’t demand our loyalty, only that we admit we feel the same way. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n126.\n\nPanda Bear: Tomboy (2011)\n\nAs a follow-up to 2007’s acclaimed Person Pitch (with Animal Collective’s even-more-acclaimed Merriweather Post Pavilion in between), Noah Lennox’s fourth solo album as Panda Bear often seems a vehicle to adjust classic sounds into a new, weird future. Covered in the singer’s rich self-harmonies, the Beach Boys references are almost too easy to make, with the wave-touched “Surfer’s Hymn” perhaps even acting as overt bait. But churning behind those echoing cries are any number of marginally identifiable sounds—fast-cycling bells? backwards pianos?—that flicker like reflections in dark water. Brimming with dubby modern psychedelia, Tomboy may be more like a VR beach than a surf-and-sand one, but it offers just as many pretty sunsets. –Jesse Jarnow\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n125.\n\nYves Tumor: Safe in the Hands of Love (2018)\n\nWith their third album, Safe in the Hands of Love, Sean Bowie took a hacksaw to the very idea of experimental music. They ripped into entrenched notions about its sound and audience, then stood back to admire the glorious mess. Still, the producer-singer’s opposing musical textures cohere astonishingly well: R&B grooves meld into sinister spoken-word interludes, sensuous cellos and militaristic chopper sounds share space. Bowie tugs at the ear with teases of pop before abruptly morphing into something far more severe. They often invert foreground and background, retreating to near-tuneless vocal melodies that act more as scaffolding than centerpiece within their heady brew of electronics. Amid the tumult, Safe in the Hands of Love examines the tension between being held, being confined, and the rare instances where the two conditions meet. The album itself occupies a similarly strange intersection: It is both remarkably beautiful and remarkably unnerving. –Olivia Horn\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n124.\n\nReal Estate: Days (2011)\n\nThere are albums on this list excavated from the darkest pits of despair, ones that irrevocably reshaped the sound of pop, and ones that will be commemorated by future generations as crucial documents of the decade’s political turmoil. And then there’s Real Estate’s second album, Days, which people turned to when they wanted something that just sounded good. If that seems like damning praise, consider how hard it can be to face the challenge of substantiating serenity, of finding validation for the ambient sadness and fleeting joys that make up most of life, of appreciating the past without being trapped in it. With this album, Real Estate casually perfected a novel form of crisp, interlocking jangle that could’ve been sourced from any point in the last 35 years. Days’ most enduring image is a pair of names carved into a tree—fitting for an album that will always be right where you left it, exactly how you remember it. –Ian Cohen\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n123.\n\nDeafheaven: Sunbather (2013)\n\nSinger George Clarke and guitarist Kerry McCoy recorded their first demos as Deafheaven while living with 12 other people in an old nunnery in San Francisco’s Mission District, their call-center jobs barely lucrative enough to cover a combined $500 in rent. Listening to the opening notes of their sophomore album, you can’t help but get the sense that they are trying to escape: Clarke screams like a man in fear for his own life as the song’s frenzied guitar tremolos and ragged blast-beats sound like they are trying to outrun each other. To the chagrin of black metal and hardcore purists, Deafheaven also seemed determined to evade any distinctions between one brand of wall-of-sound catharsis and another, teetering endlessly between ecstatic chaos and the melodic romance of ’90s shoegaze and post-rock. But focusing on Sunbather’s surface prettiness ignores the sheer scale of its compositional ambition, its brocaded sonic sub-plots and gut-punching crescendos channeling the go-for-broke ambition of people with nothing to lose. –Emilie Friedlander\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n122.\n\nSnail Mail: Lush (2018)\n\nHow does Lush manage to sound so radiant? After a series of defining teenage experiences—lust burning so bright you can’t sleep at night, crushing heartbreak, getting so drunk you can’t see straight—Lindsey Jordan immediately put those feelings to tape, capturing them at their greatest intensity. There’s more to Snail Mail’s debut album than her gripping guitar playing, whether she’s unfurling gentle melodies or slicing out unforgettable riffs. There’s more still beyond her clean, expressive voice, which conveys a sense of wonder and boundless curiosity. The root of Jordan’s precocious, multifaceted talent is her writing, and the way she can cut to the core of a complicated feeling with just a few words. Look at the chant that closes “Heat Wave”: “I’m feeling low/I’m not into ‘sometimes.’” What more needs to be said about someone who makes you happy occasionally but will never make you whole? –Jamieson Cox\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n121.\n\nThe Hotelier: Home, Like Noplace Is There (2014)\n\nEven for an emo record, Home, Like Noplace Is There is unflinching in its depiction of constant crisis. From beginning to end, it details one calamity after another—some merely deflating, others catastrophic, including incidents of addiction, abuse, and suicide. It’s a lot, and sometimes Home is almost too effective at conjuring the panic of barely holding it together when the people we care for need us the most. But the album balances its strife with jumpy pop-punk hooks, and never grows numb to suffering or loses its drive to uplift. Instead, what emerges is a portrait of contagious empathy. –Evan Rytlewski\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n120.\n\nTyler, the Creator: Flower Boy (2017)\n\nThroughout Flower Boy, Tyler, the Creator appears to recount the tale of a bygone romance with a male lover, describing their magical connection on “Glitter” and mourning their end on the wistful “See You Again.” He also uses their story as a device to reveal more about himself than he ever has before. Over sweeping, orchestral funk arrangements, he earnestly addresses his anxieties about fame, his paranoia about being canceled were he to come out, and the terrifying reality of police brutality. He takes stock of his emotional development, too, as he raps on “Where This Flower Blooms” with pride: “I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow.” It marks Tyler’s departure from the artist he was—a trouble-making scoundrel who used homophobic slurs and graphic imagery throughout his incendiary songs—to a more compassionate rapper, ready to embrace the softer parts of his personality. The album blossoms with hope, making it Tyler’s most expansive project yet. –Michelle Kim\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n119.\n\nGirlpool: Before the World Was Big (2015)\n\nGirlpool’s first full-length record is a study in tiny worlds and overflowing hearts. Avery Tucker and Harmony Tividad were still teenagers when they wrote these humble songs with bass and guitar, and there is something so profoundly young adult about Before the World Was Big. The album encapsulates what it’s like to walk through your hometown and realize you don’t live there anymore, or to suffer a serious heartbreak for the first time; on \"Chinatown,\" Tucker and Tividad pose question after question about their own existences and whether they are capable of being loved. The duo went on to make more ambitious records, but Before the World Was Big will always be their spare, indelible reminder to notice what it feels like to be alive while you still think you’re invincible. –Sophie Kemp\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n118.\n\nLeonard Cohen: You Want It Darker (2016)\n\nLeonard Cohen was too grand a figure to let death sneak up on him. Instead, he graciously accepted its approach and courted the void with one final masterpiece. You Want It Darker arrived just weeks before Cohen died at 82, still a goliath of his form. It is a profound work that addresses a man’s end, and what he must let go of once he gets there. Cohen’s legendary baritone is leagues deeper than before, perhaps sunk by the weight of his subject matter. On the title track, he sounds as though he’s been living off a steady diet of cigars and scotch; his grumbles are foreboding, even sinister, against the synagogue choir that echoes him.\n\nCohen’s repetition of the word “hineni,” Hebrew for “here I am,” is one of the record’s most chilling moments—his humble surrender to a greater power. You Want It Darker is full of these concessions: he sings of relinquishing life, love, and libido throughout its sparse yet rich compositions. His ability to examine mortality with such restraint is a testament to his elevated craft—when he sings of letting go and traveling light, it’s with relief. –Madison Bloom\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n117.\n\nDeath Grips: The Money Store (2012)\n\nThat ringing sensation in your head from the crossed streams of cable news and political discourse? That’s The Money Store. Every time you’re digitally assaulted by millions of loud voices creating nothing but noise? Pure, unadulterated The Money Store. Recorded (improbably) at the Chateau Marmont, and released (even more improbably) by the same label that puts out Mariah Carey and Meghan Trainor, Death Grips’ proper debut album captured the barking, unstoppable information overload of the 2010s in a burst of experimental rap and rock. It's a pure thrill to hear: throat-searing vocalist MC Ride, keyboardist Andy Morin, and drummer/producer Zach Hill assault the senses with blasted beats, brutally nonsensical sloganeering, and sour melodies that sound like squeezing a lemon onto a skinned knee. –Larry Fitzmaurice\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n116.\n\nJanelle Monáe: The ArchAndroid (2010)\n\nThe ArchAndroid, the debut studio album by Atlanta Renaissance woman Janelle Monáe, foretold her cultural impact on the decade. Its storyline about a messianic android is tied together by apocalyptic rock, jiggling funk, and psychedelic soul, all delivered with cinematic flair. Monáe’s star would continue to rise from here, from her guest vocal on fun.’s ubiquitous “We Are Young,” to her acting roles in Moonlight and Hidden Figures, to an Album of the Year Grammy nomination for 2018’s Dirty Computer. The ArchAndroid is the genesis of it all. –Ben Cardew\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n115.\n\nU.S. Girls: In a Poem Unlimited (2018)\n\nAs U.S. Girls mastermind Meghan Remy has evolved from one-person noisemaker to charismatic leader of a cracking rock band, her aesthetic priorities—simple melodies, rich textures, subversive lyrics—have remained steadfast. They’re all perfectly present on In a Poem Unlimited, an unabashed pop album that swings on the surface but gets thorny underneath. Complex verses about sexual dynamics and interpersonal conflict cut through music that reveres nostalgic styles like disco and glam without aping them. Along the way, Remy captures the tension of the times with a rapturous swagger, building a catchy, cathartic response to the world. –Marc Masters\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n114.\n\nSampha: Process (2017)\n\nWhen we need to give definition to tough feelings that have no clear shape and no end in sight, no word satisfies like “process.” Grief, sobriety, adulthood, etc. don’t feel so daunting and boundless when they’re “processes”; they take on a structure that they lack as experiences. As Sampha adopts the term to capture the tumult of his mother dying from cancer in 2015, he embraces both its clarity and its dizziness. His delicate, tender voice never disguises the despair at the heart of these songs, yet there’s a striking sense of wonder to his writing, a wide-eyed willingness to find a way to carry on despite the pain.\n\nAs hooded figures give chase on “Blood on Me,” a car takes flight on “Under,” and a lone gunman cries for his mother on “Kora Sings,” death takes on a dreamlike quality. The production froths with energy and verve despite the glum backdrop, constantly swirling around Sampha’s fragile falsetto or geysering into open air. Sampha grieves by expressing his sorrow as well as molding it into new forms. “It’s never gonna feel real,’” he once said of his mother’s death, skeptical of the allure of closure. Process takes that dread as a challenge. –Stephen Kearse\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n113.\n\nJapandroids: Celebration Rock (2012)\n\nOf course, an album called Celebration Rock begins with the sound of fireworks—a spectacle that is at once exhilarating and ephemeral, the ecstatic climax to an event that also signals it’s time for everyone to go home. Japandroids spend the next 35 minutes doing whatever they can to delay the moment when the highest of highs must give way to the cruelest of comedowns. The Vancouver duo’s second album condenses all the promise, excess, and regret of an epic all-nighter into an eight-song dusk-to-dawn cycle, like a Dazed and Confused that swaps out bored teens in the ’70s for directionless twenty-somethings in the 21st century. Nostalgia hits like a panic attack, the line between motivational anthem and break-up song gets blurry, and even the most starry-eyed declarations of devotion come embedded with escape clauses for when the thrill is gone. Back in 2009, Japandroids introduced themselves to the world by declaring “Young Hearts Spark Fire.” On Celebration Rock, their relentless effort to keep the flame alive only made them more conscious of the shortening wick. So, of course, an album so fervent yet fleeting also ends with the sound of fireworks. –Stuart Berman\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n112.\n\nDaft Punk: Random Access Memories (2013)\n\nThomas Bangalter and Guy de-Homem Christo spent more than a million dollars to make their triumphant comeback record, Random Access Memories. It showed. In rejection of the frictionless EDM sounds then at their commercial peak, Daft Punk went straight to the source in their quest to revive some of their favorite analog styles. They booked time in a handful of the world’s most renowned studios to record the disco pioneer Nile Rodgers, several hall-of-fame session musicians, and vocalists including Pharrell and Panda Bear, then painstakingly pieced together their work into songs that span poppy funk, prog, new wave, soft-rock balladry, and even spoken word (courtesy of electro godhead Giorgio Moroder). As a whole, the album plays like an eclectic radio transmission beamed in from an imagined past.\n\nThe highlight remains “Touch,” a psychedelic showstopper sung by ’70s songwriter Paul Williams, best known for his work with Barbara Streisand and the Carpenters. At one point in the intricately arranged song, a space-age choir gives way to Williams’ voice—delicate yet firm—backed by nothing but a grand piano. “Sweet touch, you’ve almost convinced me I’m real,” he muses, a mouthpiece for the mysterious duo who remind us just how tangible music can be. –Noah Yoo\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n111.\n\nEMA: Past Life Martyred Saints (2011)\n\nConfessional songwriting in the 2010s had a tendency toward extremes—you had your empowerment narratives, where struggles were introduced and then brushed aside to allow time to wallow in the fabulous now, and you had your nihilistic tales of pill-popping self-hatred. Past Life Martyred Saints, the debut album by Erika Anderson’s project EMA, lives in the complicated middle, a place where the pain is very real but so is the occasional flicker of hope.\n\nOver blues-scuffed alt-rock, Anderson’s characters pull up their sleeves to reveal open wounds and fading scars and speak of an emptiness that makes them want to vomit, but deep down they also believe that someone out there might love them. Later in the decade, Anderson would turn her eye to the political and cultural forces that drive people toward darkness, but Past Life is far too claustrophobic for that kind of perspective. When something heavy is on top of you and pressing down, the only thing you can think about is how to get out from under it. –Mark Richardson\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n110.\n\nWaka Flocka Flame: Flockaveli (2010)\n\nIn its gunshot ad-libs and aggressively escalating synths, Waka Flocka Flame’s debut still feels explosive. But with the benefit of hindsight, it’s easier to embrace how an album that once led to think-piecing and hand-wringing about authenticity and struggle is just pure fun, too. As much as you can draw a line from Waka and producer Lex Luger's steamrolling sound to Chief Keef and Young Chop’s gruesome Back From the Dead mixtape, you can also connect Flockaveli to the live-show antics of Travis Scott, rallying the teens to mosh. Though Waka eventually took the EDM route, playing shows at frats and shotgunning beers with undergrads, his debut struck the right balance between harsh realism and recklessness. –Ross Scarano\n\nListen: Waka Flocka Flame, “Hard in Da Paint”\n\n109.\n\nJulia Holter: Aviary (2018)\n\nNinety minutes long, with its billowing proportions blown out in strings, horns, choirs, harp, percussion, synthesizers, reeds, bagpipes, and more, Julia Holter’s Aviary revels in ecstatic excess. Meandering, shape-shifting, and often dissonant, its melodies diffuse into clouds of pure atmosphere, offering the opposite of the glib simplicity that so much pop aspires to in the streaming era. Playlist fodder, this is not.\n\nAviary’s references are among the most erudite and obscure of any of Holter’s albums, encompassing Dante, Pushkin, Occitan folk songs, and an academic tome about mnemonics and the Middle Ages; Vangelis’ Blade Runner score is in there somewhere, too. Nevertheless, Holter’s search for meaning in “destitute times” translates to an unmistakably contemporary record, her stream-of-consciousness lyrics gesturing bleakly at the nightly news (“Frequent missile talk/Slurping on the words I heard from the wretched zone/Fortune throwing candy slow in a death crawl”). And while its surfeit of feeling can mimic the shell-shocked sense of information overload that accompanies a long day scrolling social media, its moments of catharsis cut deliciously deep. –Philip Sherburne\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n108.\n\nKaytranada: 99.9% (2016)\n\nThe debut album from Montreal producer Kaytranada is a shining example of dance music as more than the sum of its parts. Blending soul, hip-hop, house, jazz, and disco, and featuring vocal turns from the likes of Vic Mensa, Syd, Craig David, Anderson .Paak, and more, the album is also a reaction against the relative whiteness of EDM circa 2016. For all the acrobatic weaving of glitchy beats with slinky, complex instrumentation, it never feels anything but warm; the athleticism isn’t necessarily beside the point, but it’s not meant to make a spectacle of itself, either. Moreover, the album is a benchmark for how pop music has commonly come to be thought of in this decade: If you blend enough genres together, they cancel each other out, and what’s left is just its own thing that doesn’t have any particular use for a tidy classification. –Steve Kandell\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n107.\n\nDirty Projectors: Swing Lo Magellan (2012)\n\nDirty Projectors used to be an inscrutable band. You’d read about how frontman David Longstreth conducted 18-hour practices in an airless Brooklyn studio, or reworked the chords of a Black Flag song to synchronize with the Fibonacci sequence or something, and think: This is music for people who make you feel like a moron for humming along to the radio. But on Swing Lo Magellan, their formal experimentation slowly gave way to an emotional generosity no amount of musical theory could obfuscate.\n\nThe album shines with the warmth and familiarity of a group of loved ones trading stories around a campfire. It’s unguarded, with “Impregnable Question” offering itself as a premier wedding song for former hipsters experimenting with sincerity. It’s funny, like when singers Amber Coffman and Haley Dekle clown Longstreth’s knotty lyrics on “Unto Caesar” (“Uh, that doesn't make any sense…”). Swing Lo Magellan ended up being the last album with this lineup of Dirty Projectors, making it a bittersweet listen. But we know it was real while it lasted. –Jeremy Gordon\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n106.\n\nMoses Sumney: Aromanticism (2017)\n\nOnly once a decade, maybe, do you get a voice like Moses Sumney’s. It is cotton-soft and canyon-wide, as crisp and ornate as frost forming on the window. A similar coldness—the absence of love—informs his spare, beautiful debut album, Aromanticism. It is not a lament for lost love but a guess that love may never arrive. His brand of blues is heavy with emotion, even as he wonders if he might not want to feel any of it. Maybe he’ll call you back; instead of sex, how about just a little making out in the car? On most songs, his falsetto hangs over spare electric guitar—except for the knockout “Lonely World,” around which the entire album spins. And though solitude haunts these songs, it also seems like a kind of relief: “To behold and not be held,” he sings, those words a blessing and a curse. –Jeremy D.

The brothers, who started DJing as teenagers in southeast England, may have relied on familiar formulas with Settle, but they still managed to fashion them into one of the most irresistibly inviting dance records of the decade. The duo supported their carefully curated patchwork of genres with a wide net of guest artists, many of whom turned into quick success stories themselves: the duo single-handedly launched Sam Smith’s career with the bombastic “Latch,” and the Nottingham pop group London Grammar began climbing after their slow-burning turn on “Help Me Lose My Mind.” Disclosure wouldn’t scale the same heights again, but Settle remains a vivid, ecstatic time capsule of early-2010s club music at its pinnacle. –Eric Torres\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n104.\n\nWaxahatchee: Cerulean Salt (2013)\n\nAllison and Katie Crutchfield’s scrappy teenage band P.S. Eliot was beloved far beyond the Alabama DIY scene they rose in. After the twin sisters broke up the group in 2011, Allison stepped out from behind the drums to lead the noisy guitar-pop band Swearin’; Katie holed up at their parents’ home with an acoustic guitar and recorded her debut as Waxahatchee, the stark, searing American Weekend. Its follow-up, Cerulean Salt, focused all that accelerated musical experience and added new color. Katie still recorded at home, but now “home” was a Philadelphia house she shared with Allison and her Swearin’ bandmates, who pitched in across the album. Backed by thudding drums and blown-out guitars, Katie’s heartrendingly vivid sketches of alienation and self-doubt sound almost triumphant, especially on the surf-flecked “Coast to Coast,” where she insists, in her faint drawl, “I’ll try to embrace the lows.” After this, Waxahatchee jumped labels to indie titans Merge, releasing two more remarkable albums and continuing to inspire a generation of acolytes to sing their own messy truths. –Marc Hogan\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n103.\n\nHelado Negro: This Is How You Smile (2019)\n\nRoberto Carlos Lange had been building toward This Is How You Smile for over a decade. Whether tinkering with vocoders or recruiting new collaborators, Lange has experimented under the banner of Helado Negro in a manner that is patient and community-oriented; people have always mattered most to him. He reached a creative apex on This Is How You Smile by washing his sound in tape hiss and soft-lit synths, casting a twilight glow over bilingual meditations on community, displacement, and loving the skin in which you were born. Lange’s fount of hope within This Is How You Smile is a balm for everyone, but for the black and brown people whom he singles out in heartfelt lyrics (“History shows/That brown won’t go/Brown just glows”), it feels like benediction. –Eric Torres\n\nListen/Buy: Rough Trade | Apple Music | Tidal\n\n102.\n\nJeremih: Late Nights: The Album (2015)\n\nDespite an attitude that ranged from nonchalance to outright self-sabotage, Jeremih quietly sustained mainstream success throughout the decade. Take Late Nights, an album that represents a triumph within the major-label system for its mere existence. Singles “Planez” and “Oui” became rap and R&B radio mainstays purely off the strength of the songwriting; Jeremih otherwise declined to engage in any sort of promotional tactics, from shooting music videos to performing on television. In touring the album, he immediately clashed with headliner PARTYNEXTDOOR—top-billed despite having far fewer hits—before being accused of sending out a body double at a show in Houston.\n\nWhile a dominant musical theme of the 2010s was the seamless fusion of rap and R&B, as employed by artists like Drake and Post Malone, Jeremih got to the same place from the other side; his R&B flows and flexes like rap music, but with a distinct melodic bounce that could only come from a singer. The music on Late Nights rates as some of the finest R&B of the decade, even if that genre tag fits loosely: Highlights “Pass Dat” and “Drank” are experimental celebrations of substances that travel along pathways carved by Lil Wayne and Young Thug, and ballads like “Actin’ Up” and “Remember Me” have a stoned spaciness that recalls the decade’s best hip-hop. The album’s most instructive song is “Paradise,” a gentle acoustic outro that begins with Jeremih still high from the night before, a girl next to him in bed, and ends with him alone in a jacuzzi toasting his great life. You get the sense he enjoys the solitude. –Jordan Sargent\n\nListen/Buy: Apple Music | Tidal\n\n101.\n\nChr"
