        "text": "A\n\nAirport\n\nNames of airports will normally be acceptable for air transport services. Objections will only be taken under section 3(1)(b) and (c) where specifications include non-air transport services such as shuttle buses, taxis etc and car parking services. It is likely that consumers would expect there to be more than one undertaking providing transport services to and from an airport and that the sign would therefore be seen as descriptive of the destination or the intended purpose of the services, for example. This also extends to other transportation services such as freight and cargo services.\n\nAnimals (Images of)\n\nImages of animals are often distinctive trade marks. However, care needs to be taken in respect of images of animals where there is a connection between the animal and the goods and services applied for. For example, a representation of a dog in respect of kennel services would be considered non distinctive. Some animals will be inherently non distinctive for certain goods e.g. cows or goats for milk, butter, cheese and other dairy products; sheep for wool products; and images of some animals in respect of leather, skin or hides. Such images are likely to be subject to an objection when used on corresponding goods unless the mark is presented in a fanciful way. For example, a laughing or dancing cow would be clearly fanciful for milk or dairy products and no objection will be deemed appropriate.\n\nCare also needs to be taken in relation to goods aimed at children such as e.g. clothing and bedding etc., where pictorial representations of animals are frequently used as decoration. As a rule of thumb, the more appealing the representation, the more likely it is to be attractive to children and be seen as mere decoration and the less likely it is to be seen as a trade mark. An objection will be raised under section 3(1)(b) where appropriate.\n\nArmorial bearings, heraldic devices and coats of arms\n\nTrade marks containing armorial bearings, heraldic devices and coats of arms are generally acceptable at the examination stage. However, the Registrar will always advise applicants seeking protection for such marks to contact the Garter King of Arms (who is responsible for granting arms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and the Lord Lyon (who is responsible for granting arms in Scotland). This is to ensure that there is no conflict with granted arms and insignia holders.\n\nWhere the holder of an earlier right submits observations, following the acceptance of a mark, on the basis that the application appears to conflict with their own granted arms or insignia, such information will be considered by the Registrar. A late objection under sections 3(5) and 4(4) may be taken in accordance with rule 10 of the Trade Marks Rule (2008).\n\nPlease note that this this practice does not apply to trade marks containing or consisting of either Royal coats of arms or any other Royal insignia. Such trade marks will be subject to other objections, as explained in the section headed ‘ROYAL MARKS’.\n\nAwards (Images of)\n\nRepresentations of awards, medals or coins are considered non-distinctive if used in isolation, unless they contain a distinctive element.\n\nWine labels often include images of medals or coins which represent awards that the wine has won. There is no requirement for the applicant to prove that the claim is valid. The award or recognition will be taken in good faith.\n\nB\n\nBio\n\n‘Bio’ is a well-known abbreviation for the term ‘biological’ and is commonly added to other words to indicate a biological factor. Whether presented alone or with a descriptive prefix or suffix, the term ‘bio’ will be treated as if it were the word ‘biological’ and an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) will be raised where the word ‘biological’ (together with any other elements present) is considered descriptive and non distinctive for the goods/services claimed.\n\nC\n\nCartoon characters\n\nA cartoon character can often function as a distinctive trade mark when used in relation to most goods and services. However when it is used in relation to goods or services such as clothing, soft toys, or nursery services etc, the following points will be considered and objections raised as appropriate under section 3(1)(b):\n\nthe image should be treated the same way regardless of whether it is two-dimensional or three-dimensional;\n\nthe marks must be sufficiently individual as to differentiate them from standard variations for the goods where animals/cartoons are commonly used as decoration e.g. children’s clothes, children’s blankets; paediatrician service\n\nthere is usually a wide range of product variation for toy shapes including plush toys (which often have cartoon-like features) in almost any animal. It is commonplace for animals to be given a human characteristic or to be dressed up in clothes. Therefore variation from the norm for these goods would rarely be sufficient for the mark to act as a badge of trade origin. However giving an inanimate object human characteristics is more likely to work, for example, a chocolate egg with facial features, arms and legs\n\nChartered\n\nTrade mark applications which contain the word ‘chartered’ normally take the form of an application to register the name of an organisation or other body, for example ‘The Chartered Institute of Surveyors’. It could also relate to an application to register the professional title of a member of a chartered body as in ‘Chartered Surveyor’.\n\nChartered status is granted by the King and therefore use of this word is controlled and is protected under an enactment of law. Any applications containing the word ‘Chartered’ would therefore be subject to an objection under Section 3(4).\n\nApplications containing the word ‘Chartered’ would initially face a deceptiveness objection under section 3(3)(b) as in the prima facie the mark merely infers a chartered status. This objection could be overcome by submitting a copy of the applicant’s signed charter proving that the applicant has been granted chartered status and is entitled to use such a qualification.\n\nWhere the application is intended to protect the name of an organisation e.g. Royal Chartered Society of Accountants, provision of an appropriate signed Charter document is sufficient to overcome the objection under both Section 3(4) and 3(3)(b). However, where the mark denotes the name of a professional title (chartered designation) of a member of the chartered organisation e.g., Royal Society Chartered Accountant, more information may be required. In particular, the applicant must not only hold a Charter document per se, but the document must also confirm the applicant’s entitlement to use the professional title. A list of designations approved by the Privy Council is available on the website: Approved Charter Designations.\n\nWhere the mark as a whole is also devoid of any distinctive character and/or is descriptive, an objection under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) will also be taken. For example, signs which denote professional titles used by members of Chartered organisations e.g., ‘Chartered Accountant’, would be seen to merely describe a quality of the service e.g., financial services provided by a member of a chartered body. It therefore lacks the capacity to act as a trade mark as it does not denote trade origin from a single source. Members of chartered organisation who have met the set professional standard would be entitled to use the chartered designation. Therefore, the designation relates to the providers professional credentials and services provided by a member of a chartered organisation would be expected to be superior to those from a provider who have not achieved the required professional standard.\n\nWhere the mark, as a totality, is considered distinctive, such as ‘Chartered Institute of Accountants’ an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) would not be appropriate, as this would be seen to denote a professional body, namely a single entity. However, the applicant will still need to provide proof of its entitlement in the form of its signed charter documents in order to overcome objections under sections 3(3)(b) and 3(4).\n\nCocktail names\n\nAs cocktail names can be produced without the need for any major manufacturing process, in theory anyone can invent and name a new cocktail. It is this ‘ease’ of naming cocktails and publishing recipes on the internet that creates difficulty when determining the distinctiveness of cocktail names.\n\nThe Registrar will conduct an internet search to determine whether the mark is capable of indicating trade origin. If the results of the search suggest reasonably widespread use amongst e.g. hotels, bars, and restaurants, then a section 3(1)(b) and (c) objection will be taken.\n\nColour(s)\n\nRepresentation of the mark The representation of a colour mark must consist of a representation of the colour or colours without contours in one single JPEG file or on one single A4 sheet. Where there is more than one colour, the reproduction must show the systematic arrangement of the colour combination.\n\nIn Libertel C-104/01 the ECJ confirmed that to be represented graphically, colour marks must be presented in a way that is “clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable and objective” as per Sieckmann C-273/00 (PDF, 722KB).\n\nIn the Libertel case the court determined that providing a sample of the colour(s) proposed for registration on paper is not sufficient by itself to satisfy the requirement for the clear representation of the sign. However, the court stated that the “Sieckmann criteria” may be satisfied by designating the colour using an internationally recognised colour identification code.\n\nSingle Colours\n\nA mark consisting of colour alone will be considered to be appropriately represented if it is filed with a sample of the colour together with a written description of the colour (e.g. ‘dark blue’) and is accompanied by the relevant code from an internationally recognised colour Fidentification system.\n\nThere are a number of colour identification systems in existence e.g. Pantone®, RAL and Focoltone®. This is not an exhaustive list and the choice of which system to use is for the applicant to decide. Where a sample of the colour and a description in words are used to represent a colour mark, the two must be integrated so as to disclose the mark applied for in an unambiguous manner - the colour shown and the stated colour code should not contradict each other.\n\nA degree of interpretation of the mark is permissible. For example, it is acceptable to assume that third parties have the capacity to look up the colour which corresponds with a particular colour code. However, there are limits to what can reasonably be expected of third parties. It must be reasonably practicable for persons inspecting the register, or reading the Trade Mark Journal, to be able to gain an understanding from the representation of what the trade mark is.\n\nAlternative ways of representing colour marks may be accepted as long as they satisfy the criteria set out above.\n\nRepresentations which are precise but impossible to interpret without costly specialist equipment or services, or which place too high a burden on third parties, are likely to be rejected because they are not easily accessible. Accordingly, a mark defined as “a blue bottle of optical characteristics such that if the wall thickness is 3mm the bottle has, in air, a dominant wavelength of 472 to 474 nanometres, a purity of 44 to 48%, an optical brightness of 28 to 32%” was rejected by The Appointed Person in Ty Nant Spring Water Ltd’s application (BL O/241/99 (PDF, 27.5KB)) because it would require third parties to use a spectrophotometer to ascertain whether a particular colour was or was not covered by the description, and in fact served to veil the identity of the sign (cobalt blue).\n\nCombinations of colours\n\nIn Heidelberger Bauchemie GmbH (C-49/02 (PDF, 549KB)), the CJEU introduced an additional requirement for marks consisting of a combination of colours in the abstract, without contours. In such cases, the Court confirmed that the representation must also include “a systematic arrangement associating the colours in a predetermined and uniform way”.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not very clear what this means in practice. The Court offered no examples of the ways in which the requirement might be satisfied. However, the following representation of EuropeanTrade Mark (‘EUTM’) number 2177566 appears to plainly fall within the guidance.\n\nMark Description: The distribution and ratio of the colours to each other is 50-50, whereby the colour blue runs horizontally above the colour red, forming a striped whole.\n\nIndication of colour: Blue: Ral 5015; Red: Ral 2002.\n\nAlternative ways of graphically representing colour marks may be accepted as long as they satisfy the criteria set out above.\n\nColour(s) in the Abstract\n\nThe CJEU has made it clear that there is no reason why, in principle, colour(s) cannot be registered in the abstract, as opposed to specific applications of colour such as being applied to the exterior of the goods themselves, or to their packaging.\n\nDescriptions such as “as shown on the form of application” have been found to be an inadequate means of limiting the mark to the precise form shown in the pictorial representation of the mark on the application form (see, for example, the Advocate General’s Opinion in Dyson Ltd v Registrar of Trade Marks (C-321/03 (PDF, 570KB)) subsequently endorsed in the CJEU’s judgment of 25 January 2007). Consequently, “as shown on the form of application” will no longer be accepted as limiting the mark. Instead, more precise wording such as, “in the [arrangement/position] depicted in the pictorial representation of the mark” should be used.\n\nApplications made for a colour per se, accompanied by a sample of the colour and a form of description which implies (rather than categorically defines) how the colour is intended to be used is not considered acceptable. The decision of the Court of Appeal in Société Des Produits Nestlé SA v Cadbury UK Ltd (Case [2013] EWCA Civ 1174 refers). The original application had been made by Cadbury for a specific shade of purple, and the sample of the colour was accompanied by the following description:\n\n“The colour purple (Pantone 2685C), as shown on the form of application, applied to the whole visible surface, or being the predominant colour applied to the whole visible surface, of the packaging of the goods”.\n\nThe Court summed up its view in paragraph 50 by stating:\n\nThe use of the word “predominant” opens the door to a multitude of different visual forms as a result of its implied reference to other colours and other visual material not displayed or described in the application and over which the colour purple may predominate. It is an application for the registration of a shade of colour ‘plus’ other material, not of just an unchanging application of a single colour, as in Libertel.\n\nApplicants should consider whether the way colour is used forms an essential part of the subject matter of their trade mark. For example, if evidence of acquired distinctiveness is likely to show that a specific colour has come to be recognised as a trade mark when used in a particular manner (e.g. on the sides of the overhead canopy of a fuel service station), it may be advisable to define the mark in this way from the outset. Applicants should note that it is not possible to amend one’s trade mark in ways which substantially affect the identity of said mark after the application has been submitted.\n\nAssessing distinctive character\n\nSingle colours\n\nIn Libertel (C-104/01) the Court decided that colour per se may have a distinctive character and may be capable of distinguishing the goods and services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. However, as colour per se is not normally used by traders as a means of brand identification (unlike, for example, words and pictures), consumers are not in the habit of making assumptions about the origin of goods and services based solely on their colour or the colour of their packaging. It therefore follows that single colours will only be deemed capable of denoting the origin of a product or service in exceptional circumstances. Marks consisting of a single colour will usually be liable to objection under section 3(1)(b) because they lack the capacity to distinguish. In some cases, single colours may also attract additional objections under section 3(1)(c) and (d) if the colour sends a descriptive message and/or it is customary in the trade i.e. the colour red for fire-fighting services, or the colour green for ecological goods/services. There may be occasions where colour applied to the goods themselves may be inherently more distinctive than when the colour is applied to the packaging; for example, blue for strawberries, in Class 31, would have the capacity to denote trade origin yet the same colour applied to packaging of strawberries, in Class 16, would be non-distinctive.\n\nThe examination of single colour marks requires careful analysis, not least because there is a public interest in not unduly limiting the availability of colours for other traders. Each case must be assessed individually.\n\nTwo or more colours\n\nA combination of colours may be registrable, but all will depend on how the colours are presented and what they are applied to. When applications consist merely of colours applied to the goods or their packaging, it will be necessary to consider how unusual the colour combination is in relation to the goods and whether prima facie the combination is likely to strike the relevant consumer as an indication of trade source. For example, it is unlikely that the average consumer of washing tablets would, without extensive and exclusive use, view colour combinations such as green and white or yellow and white as an indication of trade source; it is more likely that they would be taken to indicate the presence of two active ingredients and therefore be given no trade mark consideration.\n\nIf multiple colours are presented as a figurative mark (for example, two colours presented within a geometric shape such as a square or circle), then as few as two colours could be accepted; however if they are simply the colours of the packaging of the product they are less likely prima facie to indicate trade source.\n\nIn addition, when considering whether colour combination marks are liable to objection under section 3(1)(b), as with single colours, consideration under section 3(1)(c) and (d) must also be given.\n\nCompany names\n\nThe term ‘company’ or ‘limited’ paired with a word (or words) which describes the goods and/or services intended for protection is unlikely to meet the requirements for registration on the basis that the resulting combination would still be descriptive and/or devoid of any distinctive character. For example, the sign ‘Soap Company’ would not be acceptable as it merely describes a company that produces soap. Similarly, the sign ‘The Organic Food Company’ would also be unacceptable as there are likely to be a large number of organic food producers which would refer to themselves as being the definitive organic food company.\n\nThe addition of ‘company limited’ or ‘Plc’ may provide some capacity to indicate trade origin, rather than just as a generic reference to a particular type of business activity. For example the mark ‘The Puppet Company’ would be considered to be descriptive whereas ‘The Puppet Company Limited’ would indicate trade origin and considered to be acceptable.\n\nThe addition of a company name to words describing characteristics of the goods or services, rather than the generic name of the goods themselves, will usually be sufficient to bestow distinctive character e.g. the mark ‘Soft and Gentle’ would not be acceptable for soap whereas ‘Soft and Gentle Limited‘ would be seen as fanciful and therefore acceptable.\n\nThe Cultural Emblem\n\nAny image which consists of or contains ‘The Cultural Emblem’ will be subject to an objection under Section 4(3) of the Act as unauthorised use or misuse of this specially protected emblem is forbidden under international law. The Cultural Emblem comprises of a blue and white shield, also known simply as the ‘Blue Shield’, which is the identifying sign for the protection of cultural property in armed conflict (under the 1954 Hague Convention).\n\nAny application containing this protected symbol, seeking protection in respect of any goods or services, will be subject to an objection unless it appears to the registrar that consent has been given for or on behalf of the competent authority.\n\nD\n\nDeceptive marks\n\nSection 3(3)(b) states:\n\n(3) A trade mark shall not be registered if it is -\n\n(b) of such a nature as to deceive the public (for instance as to the nature, quality or geographical origins of the goods or service).\n\nIn Elizabeth Emanuel v Continental Shelf 128 Ltd, C-259/04 (PDF, 754KB), the CJEU stated in paragraph 47 of its judgment that the application of this provision “presupposes the existence of actual deceit or a sufficiently serious risk that the consumer will be deceived”. An objection under section 3(3)(b) should therefore only be raised where there is a real potential for deception of the public, regardless of the distinctiveness of the mark as a whole. In cases where a trade mark refers to a particular place-name, an objection under section 3(3)(b) will only be justified where:\n\nthe trade mark refers to a place-name which has a current reputation for, or association with, particular goods or services; and\n\nthe application seeks to protect those goods or services (either because they are explicitly listed within the specification, or because they are ‘caught’ within the scope of wider terms used).\n\nNature\n\nA mark is acceptable if there is no realistic possibility of deception. For example, the mark ‘Hartley’s Strawberry Jam’ for ‘jams and preserves’ would be acceptable, as would the mark ‘Britvic Orange Juice’ for ‘fruit juices’. It would be assumed that the proprietor would only use the marks on strawberry jam and orange juice respectively, otherwise they will fall foul of Trading Standards legislation.\n\nIf an applicant seeks to exclude goods or services from the specification in response to a section 3(1) objection, the mark should be reconsidered to establish whether it has now become deceptive under section 3(3). To illustrate, the mark ‘Titanium’, applied for in respect of ‘building products’ would, at first examination, face an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) on account of its capacity to describe the goods (i.e. those made of titanium). It would not, at the examination stage, face any deceptiveness objection under section 3(3), on account of the fact that it would appear to be against a trader’s own interests to use such a mark on anything other than building products made of titanium. However, if the applicant subsequently sought to exclude titanium goods as a means of overcoming the section 3(1)(b) and (c) objection, a section 3(3)(b) objection would be raised as it would now be deceptive for goods not made of titanium.\n\nQuality\n\nSection 3(3)(b) objections are applicable to marks which indicate a particular desirable quality of the goods. A desirable quality could be defined as something you pay extra for e.g. silk or cashmere clothing. It can also be based on a cultural distinction, for example, where one perceives halal or kosher foodstuffs to be of a superior quality. For some terms such as ‘organic’, there may be regulatory arrangements which must be adhered to before the term can be used in trade.\n\nIf the mark indicates a desirable quality and the goods or services do not comply with that desirable quality, then there is the real likelihood that consumer’s decision to purchase would be based on an expectation that the goods possess that ‘desirable quality’. In such cases, an objection will be taken.\n\nGeographical location\n\nWhere a trade mark includes reference to a particular geographical location, and it is being used in respect of goods or services for which that location has a particular association, it is reasonable to believe that the relevant consumer would genuinely expect the product to have originated from the referenced location. Consider, for example, the following:\n\nWHYTE’S SOMERSET CIDER Intended for use in respect of ‘cider’\n\nOn the basis that Somerset has a well-known reputation for producing cider, the relevant consumer would, at the point of selection and/or purchase, expect the product to have been produced in Somerset. Furthermore, the quality associated with cider produced in Somerset (as opposed to anywhere else in the world) may well influence the consumer’s decision to select and/or purchase that particular product over any other.\n\nIn such a case, where the geographical reference contained within the mark is understood to be an objective indicator of quality (resulting from Somerset’s reputation for cider), deception would occur wherever the product sold under the trade mark does not correspond to the geographical reference as presented in the trade mark. So in this case, the mark shown above would deceive the public if used in respect of ciders produced outside of Somerset.\n\nThis logic will apply in any and all scenarios where a trade mark seeks to take advantage of a known geographical reputation by protecting corresponding products. It is not limited to foodstuffs. The following examples reflect the practice in relation to both quality and geographical origin:\n\nLyon’s cashmere for ‘jumpers’\n\nObjectionable because cashmere is more desirable than other fabrics\n\nArtic leather for ‘clothing’\n\nObjectionable because imitation leather is inferior to the genuine article, and can be passed off as (real) leather\n\nBrassrite for ‘plumbing fittings’\n\nObjectionable because brass fittings are perceived as being a better quality than their plastic equivalents\n\nMoonsilk for ‘underwear’\n\nObjectionable because silk is more desirable than other fabrics\n\nStorm diamond for ‘jewellery’\n\nObjectionable because one would pay more for real diamonds\n\nPoh perfectly organic hampers for ‘sale of foodstuffs and beverages’\n\nObjectionable because one would pay more for organic produce\n\nSwisstex for ‘watches’\n\nObjectionable because switzerland has a recognised reputation for producing high quality timepieces\n\nHighland scotch for ‘alcoholic beverages’\n\nObjectionable because the consumer would have an expectation that the product is genuine scotch whisky (see dedicated section on scotch and scotch whisky)\n\nIn each of the examples listed above, the list of goods/services should be restricted to the specific goods/services contained in the specification otherwise the application would be refused, for example-\n\nMoonsilk for ‘silk underwear’\n\nPoh perfectly organic hampers for ‘sale of organic foodstuffs and organic beverages’\n\nBoth would be acceptable.\n\nWhere a trade mark consists of decoration to be applied to a shoe, the applicant may wish to show it in context i.e. showing its actual position on a shoe. It is commonplace for those elements which are not intended to be part of the trade mark to be shown in broken lines, which is an acceptable form of presentation. Alternatively this can be supported by inserting a mark text on the application form, for example-\n\nThe mark consists of five parallel stripes placed on the side of footwear as shown in the attached representation. The dotted lines do not form part of the mark and are entered to show the position of the mark on the goods.\n\nSuch marks will only be considered acceptable if they are sufficiently distinctive, as confirmed by the General Court’s decision in K-Swiss Inc v OHIM (T-3/15) which considered the trade mark as shown below:\n\nDescription of the shape of the goods\n\nSection 3(1)(c) excludes trade marks which consist exclusively of signs or indications which may serve, in trade, to designate characteristics of the goods. This would refer to words which describe the shape of the product, as well as a naturalistic representations of the shape itself.\n\nFor goods that may come in a variety of forms such as, for example, chocolate products, soap, and jewellery, an objection may be appropriate if it describes the shape of the product (as opposed to the generic name of the product itself). To illustrate, the word ‘bunny’ filed in respect of chocolate products, will face an objection under section 3(1)(c) because it is commonplace for such products to be in the shape of animals e.g. bunnies. Not all words describing shapes will be considered to be descriptive; one must weigh up the balance of probability. For example, although one cannot rule out the possibility that chocolates might be made in the shape of a tulip, the likelihood is less than, say, chocolates produced in the shape of bunny rabbits. As a consequence, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the word ‘tulip’, applied for in respect of ‘chocolate confectionery’ would not attract an objection under section 3(1)(c).\n\nDirect\n\nThe word ‘direct’ is descriptive when used in respect of services sold directly to the public, instead of through a broker or other intermediary, or for the specific goods themselves. It will be usual to object under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) when used alone or in combination with the name of the goods/services provided e.g. ‘DIRECT SWIMWEAR’ or ‘SWIMWEAR DIRECT’. However, this rule will not normally apply where the mark’s secondary element does not describe the product intended for protection (whether a good or a service). For example, the phrase ‘SWIMMING DIRECT’, intended for use in respect of swimming equipment, would not face an objection because the word ‘swimming’ denotes an activity, not a product. In contrast the phrases ‘DIRECT SWIMMING AIDS’ and ‘SWIMMING GOGGLES DIRECT’, would both face objection.\n\nDomain names\n\nGeneral guidance\n\nGeneric individual elements of top level domains (gTLDs) such as ‘.com’ or ‘.co.uk’ (whether a prefix or a suffix) are considered to be totally non-distinctive. However, domain names presented in their entirety (e.g. ‘www.ipo.gov.uk’ or ‘ipo.gov.uk’) can be registered as trade marks provided they are distinctive in totality. As a general rule, one should consider whether the remainder of the mark (i.e. the elements other than ‘www’, ‘.com’ or ‘.co.uk’ etc.) is descriptive or non-distinctive. If so, there is likely to be an objection under sections 3(1)(b) and (c). For example, the signs ‘cars.com’ and ‘www.soap.com’ would be unacceptable as they merely describe the provision of cars and soaps via the Internet.\n\nIn PHOTOS.COM (C-70/13), the following was stated at paragraph 25:\n\n” However, in paragraphs 24 to 28 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held as follows:\n\n24 It is appropriate to examine the word sign PHOTOS.COM as a whole. According to settled case-law, the distinctiveness of trade marks composed of words and a typographical sign, such as that at issue in the present proceedings, may, in part, be assessed by examining each of its terms or elements, taken separately, but must in any event depend on an appraisal of the composite whole. The mere fact that each of those elements, considered separately, is devoid of distinctive character does not mean that in combination they cannot present a distinctive character (see [judgment of 12 December 2007 in Case T‑117/06 DeTeMedien v OHIM (suchen.de)], paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).\n\n25 The parties agree on the fact that the word mark PHOTOS.COM, considered as a whole, reproduces the characteristic structure of a second-level domain name (“photos”) and a TLD [top level domain] (“com”), separated by a dot. As the Board of Appeal pointed out, that mark has no additional features – in particular, graphic features – because the dot is typically used to separate the second level domain from the TLD.\n\n26 Furthermore, the addition of the element “.com” to the word “photos”, which is descriptive and devoid of distinctive character, does not render the sign distinctive as a whole. As the Board of Appeal pointed out, the distinctive part of a domain name is not the TLD, which is generic, but the second-level domain – which, in the present case, is devoid of distinctive character.\n\n27 Additionally, it is important to note that, even if the registration of a sign as a Community mark is not conditional upon a finding of a certain level of linguistic or artistic creativity or imaginativeness on the part of the proprietor of the trade mark, the fact remains that – as the Board of Appeal found – there is no additional element to support the conclusion that the combination created by the commonplace and customary components “photos” and “.com” is unusual, fanciful or might have its own meaning, especially in the perception that the relevant public might have of the goods and services concerned (see, to that effect, [DeTeMedien v OHIM], paragraph 32).\n\n28 Accordingly, in the absence of special characteristics peculiar to the sign at issue, the relevant public’s perception of that sign will be no different from its perception of the combination of the two words comprising the sign. It follows that, as the Board of Appeal rightly pointed out, the relevant public will not be able to distinguish the goods and services covered by the trade mark application from goods and services of a different commercial origin. Consequently, the sign is devoid of distinctive character.”\n\nThe addition of ‘.com’ or ‘.co.uk’ to words which describe characteristics of the goods or services (as opposed to describing the generic name of the goods themselves), will usually be sufficient to bestow distinctive character upon the mark in totality. For example, even though the phrase ‘Twist and Seal’ is itself likely to be objectionable for storage jars on the basis of it describing a characteristic of the goods (i.e. storage jars with a ‘twist and seal’ action), the addition of an URL suffix such as ‘.com’ is likely to give the resulting sign i.e. ‘www.twistandseal.com’ in its totality a trade mark character.\n\nTop-level domain names introduced in 2014\n\nTo date, the average consumer has become familiar with a fairly restricted range of generic top-level domains (gTLDs), such as .com, .co.uk, .net and .org. However, the body responsible for managing gTLDs - the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) - is increasing the choice of gTLDs to promote innovation. The first new suffixes opened for registration in January 2014, and Icann plans to facilitate a measured rollout of new domains. Accordingly, new gTLDs will be introduced steadily over time, and will include:\n\nstandard or Generic TLDs - these will include generic terms such as ‘.culture’, ‘.music’ and ‘.trusted’.\n\ncommunity TLDs - these will include gTLDs such as ‘.catholic’, and ‘.thai’\n\ngeographical TLDs - these will include, for example, ‘.nyc’, ‘.berlin’, and ‘.toyko’\n\nbrand TLDs - companies and organisations will be able to apply for their own TLDs using their trade marks, for example, ‘.unicef’, ‘.motorola’, ‘.hitachi’, and ‘.tesco’\n\nAny trade mark containing a new gTLD will be assessed in its entirety, and its capacity to meet the requirements for registration will be based on whether or not it contains a distinctive element that will enable it to distinguish. For example, an application to register the mark ‘WWW.JAZZ.MUSIC’ in respect of musical entertainment services, digital content or broadcasting would face an objection under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) as it describes a category of music.\n\nE\n\nThe single letter ‘e’, when presented as a prefix, is commonly used to denote ‘electronic’ (for example, in the context of conducting business through an electronic medium). There are a number of well-established acronyms and terms which use the prefix ‘e’ in this way, for example, the expressions ‘e-commerce’, ‘e-mail’, ‘e-learning’ and ‘e-software’. Such use is supported by definitions for the letter ‘e’ as found in a number of established English dictionaries. For example, the New Oxford Dictionary of English defines it as follows: e - denoting use of electronic data transfer in cyberspace for information exchange and financial transactions, especially through the Internet.\n\nA sign consisting of the single letter ‘e’ prefixing a word which describes the goods or services applied for may be objectionable under sections 3(1)(b) and (c), and in some cases a section 3(1)(d) objection may also be appropriate. When considering such an application, the context of the mark and the specification is important. The Internet will be searched where necessary, but it should be remembered that the fact that a term is not already in descriptive use does not preclude an objection under section 3(1)(c) if the likelihood of normal descriptive use of the term is foreseeable at the date of application.\n\nIn general, it is more likely that an objection will arise where the letter ‘e’ is combined with a description of a product (whether a good or a service) used in e-commerce, particularly goods in class 9 and services in class 38. However, each case must be treated on its own merits. So, for example, there would be no objection to ‘e-doors’ or ‘e-soap’ because (i) there is no such thing as electronic soap (ii) such goods are not normally associated with e-trading, and (iii) doors and soap sold over the Internet are the same as doors and soap sold in any other way. All considerations are relevant. However ‘e-software’, ‘e-book’ and ‘e-learning’ are open to objection. It should be noted that the Registrar makes no distinction between the letter ‘e’ being presented in either upper or lower case. The guidance set out above applies to both.\n\nEnvironmental or ecological terms\n\nThe terms ‘ECO’ and ‘ENVIRO’ are commonly used as a combining form denoting ecology, ecological or environmental and are widely used in relation to both the environment and environmentally friendly products. Whether used alone or as a prefix, the words ‘ECO’ or ‘ENVIRO’ will be treated as if they were the word ‘ecological’ or ‘environmental’ and an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) will be raised where the totality is considered descriptive.\n\nSimilarly, the word ‘GREEN’ also has a meaning in relation to ecology and environmentally friendly products. Therefore, an objection may be appropriate under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) when ‘GREEN’ is presented alone, or combined with other descriptive words such as, for example, ‘green cleaning products’, ‘green packaging’ or ‘green energy’.\n\nEuro\n\nThe words ‘Euro’ and ‘European’ are interchangeable (see the Appointed Person decision EUROLAMB ([1997] RPC 279).\n\nWhether presented alone or with a descriptive prefix or suffix, the word ‘EURO’ will be treated as if it were the word ‘European’ and an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) will be raised where the totality is considered descriptive.\n\nThe Euro is also the currency of the EU and will therefore be considered objectionable for any services relating to the financial sector, and for printed matter.\n\nExtra\n\nThe word ‘extra’ means “being more than what is usual or expected; additional” (Collins English Dictionary) and as such has a promotional or laudatory meaning. This was confirmed by the General Court in EXTRA (T-553/14). This means that the word “EXTRA” alone would be objectionable as would a common misspelling such as ‘xtra’, under section 3(1)(b)&(c).\n\nF\n\nFamous (names, pictures and representations of well-known buildings)\n\nIn all cases, consideration has to be given to the type of building. If it is a tourist attraction and is open to the public, then an objection should be raised, for example Tower Bridge, Eiffel Tower, Edinburgh Castle. Buildings which are famous but are unlikely to be the subject of mementos and ornaments are generally acceptable for example Pentonville prison is a famous building but it is unlikely that anyone would want to produce memorabilia with the name Pentonville on it.\n\nMementos and ornaments bearing the name and/or representation of famous public buildings are commonly sold as souvenirs and commemorative merchandise, and have no distinctive character in their own right. Such marks will be objectionable under section 3(1)(b) for products such as ornaments, ashtrays, confectionery, biscuits, key rings, t-shirts, films, DVDs printed matter, photographs and tourist services.\n\nFamous fictional characters/stories\n\nNames of well-known fictional stories or characters\n\nThe names of fictional characters/stories will be accepted prima facie unless they are well known to the extent that they have passed into common language and culture. The level of recognition, fame and historical use associated with some fictional names means that they are unlikely to be perceived as indicators of trade origin. For example, ‘SHERLOCK HOLMES’ is a name that has been used by many traders over the years in order to describe both a series of stories and a character that appears therein. Because of the extent of its use, today’s relevant public would not expect products bearing the name ‘SHERLOCK HOLMES’ to originate from the estate of Arthur Conan Doyle. In this type of scenario, the name of the character is devoid of any distinctive character, and is descriptive of any books, films etc. which feature that character. Objections would therefore be taken under sections 3(1)(b) and (c). However ‘SHERLOCK HOLMES’ applied for bananas or wedding dresses for example, which have no association with the character, would not face an objection.\n\nThe Court of Appeal confirmed this approach in TARZAN ([1970] RPC 450). Although the applicant, Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc. of Tarzana, California, had been granted certain exclusive rights by the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of the Tarzan stories) to produce films, records and merchandise for distribution within the United Kingdom, registration was refused on the basis that the name of the lead character had passed into language and had become a household word. The word ‘TARZAN’ now appears in most dictionaries as referring to a strong, agile and virile man. It would not therefore be seen as a trade mark.\n\nOn the other hand, where a fictional character name has been used by a single undertaking, and/or where the Registrar believes that the relevant public perceives said character name to be under the control of a single undertaking, then there is greater likelihood that it will possess distinctiveness, and will have the inherent ability to denote commercial origin. By way of example, ‘SPIDER MAN’ is the name given to a fictional superhero who frequently appears in both comic books and films published by, produced by, or associated with Marvel Comics. The relevant public will be aware of the character’s long-standing association with the Marvel brand, and will assume that use of the name is either under the control of, or sanctioned by, Marvel comics, and so would recognise its capacity to function as a trade mark.\n\nIn cases where a fictional name has passed into language, the question of who coined it is not decisive in terms of assessing its inherent distinctiveness. Similarly, the question of whether the applicant has copyright or some other exclusive right to publish the printed material commonly associated with the title/character concerned is not of itself decisive. The question is whether the sign is likely to be taken as a badge of origin.\n\nDepending upon the nature of the mark in question, and although not an exhaustive list, an objection may be taken in respect of goods such as printed matter, posters, photographs, figurines, films, videos, TV programs, organisation of plays and shows, toys, badges and fancy dress costumes.\n\nIn deciding whether a fictional character is ‘well known and long established’ to the extent that it has entered the language, care should be taken to avoid taking into account the applicant’s own efforts to promote the name after the date of application. If the name in question has already entered the language prior to the date of application, subsequent concerted promotional activity by the applicant would not overcome any objection.\n\nRepresentations of well-known fictional characters\n\nSimilar considerations apply to representations (i.e. illustrations) of well-known fictional characters. However, it should be borne in mind that (unlike with a name) there are many ways of depicting the same character and a representation of even a widely used fictional character may be acceptable if it has distinctive stylisation.\n\nFamous names\n\nThe suitability for acceptance and registration of a sign consisting of the name of a famous individual or a well-known group very much depends on the goods and services covered by the application, and the level of fame enjoyed by that individual or group. It is possible that when used in relation to certain goods or services, the average consumer will merely see the sign as an indication that the goods or services are about the person or group rather than an indication of the trade origin.\n\nMedia\n\nThe names of famous individuals or groups may serve as trade marks for goods and services such as printed publications, musical recordings, films, videos, TV programmes etc. on the basis that they are likely to imply some form of commercial control, and that the release/marketing of such goods and services has been authorised by the famous individual/group. Consequently there will not normally be an objection to the registration of a famous name for these goods. For example, the sign ‘Take That’ would be deemed inherently distinctive for musical recordings.\n\nImage Carriers\n\nIn respect of image carriers such as posters, calendars, photographs, transfers and figurines, the name of the famous person or group is likely to be seen as the subject matter of such goods, and objections under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) will be appropriate. Factors relevant to the assessment of famous names in the context of image-bearing products were considered by Mr Richard Arnold QC (as he then was) sitting as the Appointed Person in Linkin Park (O-035-05 (PDF, 87.9 KB)):\n\nFirst, if one imagines a consumer who wants a poster depicting LINKIN PARK asking a shop assistant whether that shop stocks such things, he would be very likely to say “Do you have any LINKIN PARK posters?” I accept that he might use the alternative formulation, but in my judgment this is less likely. In the question “Do you have any LINKIN PARK posters?” the mark is clearly being used to describe a characteristic of the goods being sought, namely their subject matter.\n\nThe objection will, of course, depend on the fame of the person or group. As stated in the decision of the Appointed Person in respect of the mark ALEX FERGUSON (O-0946-06 (PDF, 46.8KB)):\n\nThe more famous the personage(s) or event(s), the more likely it is that there will be a market for such goods and the less likely it is that the name will be regarded as acceptable for registration in relation to goods of that kind on the basis of the approach currently applied by the Registry in the United Kingdom.\n\nIf the person/group has only enjoyed limited fame an objection may not be appropriate. An Internet search should be helpful in establishing the degree of fame enjoyed by that person or group.\n\nBadges of Allegiance/memorabilia\n\nA badge of allegiance is something worn or displayed by supporters to show their support to a particular team or musical group. This would include goods such as T-shirts, mugs, textile articles, scarves, printed matter, etc.\n\nThe name of a famous sporting club or musical group may serve to identify the trade source of badges of allegiance even if the possibility of other traders producing unofficial merchandise cannot be ruled out. Consequently, such marks will normally be accepted for such goods.\n\nIn the case of Arsenal v Reed [2002]EWHC2695(Ch) (PDF, 707KB), Laddie J. held that the trade mark ARSENAL was validly registered under the 1994 Act, even though it could and had been used by others in a non-trade mark sense. He concluded that this did not automatically make the trade mark ARSENAL non-distinctive for scarves etc. Although Arsenal is the name of a famous football club rather than the name of an individual or group, a similar point arises: namely, whether the name of a person or organisation which others wish to use in order to demonstrate their support/allegiance should be registrable as a trade mark for relevant goods. The decision in the ARSENAL case indicates that such protection should not automatically be refused or invalidated in these circumstances.\n\nNames of football clubs such as Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Manchester City only refer to the club as a whole when used on the type of goods and services expected from such undertakings, for example photographs and hospitality services. However care should be taken in relation to publications, as the name of the club would then be seen as purely subject matter.\n\nHowever, where the name of the sporting club is further qualified in some way, e.g. Manchester City 2013/14, then this clearly identifies the subject matter, i.e. publications, memorabilia about Manchester City’s team of 2013/2014 and as such, an objection may be applicable.\n\nNames of Deceased Famous Individuals or Defunct Groups\n\nIn these circumstances the name is more likely to be seen by consumers as merely an historical reference to the subject matter of the goods or services, rather than the trade source of the goods. However, each case must be judged on its own facts taking account of the length of time that has passed since the person concerned has died, or the group has become defunct, and the relationship (if any) between the goods/services in the application and those associated with the dead person or defunct group.\n\nIn respect of names of famous composers, such as Beethoven or Vivaldi, for musical recordings or entertainments services, the names are unlikely to be seen as a trade mark for such goods or services but merely a reference to the music being performed. However, the names are likely to be acceptable for goods such as paints or bathroom fittings for example.\n\nPictures and Photographs of Famous Persons (living and deceased) and Groups\n\nPictures and photographs of famous persons/groups present similar issues to famous names. However, depending upon the goods, they may be more likely (compared to a name) to be taken as mere decoration and therefore lack distinctive character. ‘Personality or image’ rights do not exist in the UK, consequently a photograph of a famous individual would not act as a trade mark in respect of image carriers such as photographs, posters etc as it would be seen as purely subject matter. If such goods are removed from the specification of goods the objection may be waived.\n\nSection 3(6) – Bad Faith\n\nSee Part A section 5.11 for further information.\n\nFamous painting (Representations of)\n\nWhen famous paintings or parts of paintings are contained within a mark it will be seen as mere decoration, for example the Mona Lisa on souvenir-type goods such as a t-shirt or mug. The sign will therefore fail to perform the function of a trade mark, namely to act as a badge of origin, linking the goods/services to a single undertaking. An objection under 3(1)(b) is therefore appropriate. On printed matter the image may be seen as subject matter and an objection under section 3(1)(b)&(c) will be taken.\n\nFigurative representations associated with the goods/services\n\nFigurative representations which are either a representation of the goods themselves or are indicative of the goods concerned, would be objectionable under sections 3(1)(b) and (c). For example,\n\nFor umbrellas would be objectionable under section 3(1)(b)&(c) as it is merely a representation of the actual product.\n\nFor milk, butter, cheese and other dairy products would be objectionable under section 3(1)(b)&(c) as the image would indicate that the goods are made from cows milk.\n\nFor timber etc would be objectionable under section 3(1)(b)&(c) as the image would indicate that the goods are natural wood.\n\nThe same principles apply to applications filed in respect of services. For example, simple representations of motor cars would not be acceptable for car repair, car leasing or taxi services; a head for hairdressing; clothed figures for hire of clothing and a house for estate agencies etc.\n\nWhilst the above representations would not be accepted, if they were fanciful, for example a laughing cow, the mark may be perceived by the relevant consumer as a distinctive sign that can serve to indicate origin.\n\nWhen considering services, images of human figures performing or connected with a given service, especially if dressed in commonly recognised uniforms or outfits, are not acceptable unless shown in a stylised, cartoon-like or fanciful way. For example, the device of a plumber or tradesperson for relevant services would not be considered acceptable if the marks concerned did not incorporate other distinctive matter.\n\nFirst\n\n`First’ can be descriptive, for example FIRST SHOES, in respect of footwear for children, as it is common to use the word in relation to children’s first shoes. In this context objections should be raised under sections 3(1)(b) and (c). The word ‘first’ may be acceptable in combination with other descriptive or non-distinctive words for example FIRST NATIONAL BANK, as the combination of the words do not describe the services being provided.\n\nFlexi\n\n‘Flexi’ is a well known abbreviation for ‘flexible’. Whether used alone or as a prefix, the word will be treated as if they were the word ‘flexible’ and an objection under section 3(1)(b) and (c) will be raised where the totality is considered descriptive. This will normally only apply when flexibility is a desirable characteristic of the goods/services applied for foe example ‘FLEXIPIPE’ (for pipes) would not be acceptable as it is desirable for pipes to be flexible.\n\nG\n\nGeographical indications\n\nSection 3(4) states:\n\nA trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that its use is prohibited in the United Kingdom by any enactment or rule of law\n\nProtected Designation of Origin (PDOs), Protected Geographical Indications (PGIs), and Traditional Specialities Guaranteed (TSGs) which are generally referred to as Geographical Indications (GIs), are terms used in the course of trade to establish an association between a place and certain goods in order to evoke a quality standard and to benefit from the region’s good reputation; for example, the PDO ‘Blue Stilton’ for cheese, the PGI ‘Scotch Beef’ in respect of fresh meat, and the TSG ‘Traditionally Farmed Gloucestershire Old Spots Pork’ for pork and all products derived from the pig.\n\nA GI constitutes a collective right, subject to certain conditions, to all those trading in the goods of the geographical area concerned. In order to avoid misappropriation, counterfeiting and misuse, international treaties and national law protect such geographical indications in respect of agricultural produce, foodstuffs, wines and spirit drinks.\n\nGeographical Indications are protected in England, Scotland and Wales (GB) under a UK GI scheme operated and administered by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). As a result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, Geographical Indications are protected in Northern Ireland under the European Commission’s GI scheme.\n\nApplications in Classes 29, 30, 31, 32 and 33 containing GIs which are protected in GB and/or Northern Ireland will face an objection under section 3(4) where the specification of the application contains the same or similar goods to those of the GI.\n\nIf the mark consists solely of a GI an objection will be taken under section 3(4) as the term is protected and under section 3(1)(b) and (c) as it is a geographical place name and/or the type of product. A section 3(3)(b) objection would also be taken as it would be deceptive if the goods did not originate from the area or contain the specific product.\n\nIf the mark contains a GI, an objection under sections 3(4) and 3(3)(b) is appropriate. This objection can be overcome by limiting the goods to those protected by the GI. Some examples are as follows-\n\nMark – NESCO Cornish Clotted Cream Goods - cream\n\nAn objection under section 3(4) and 3(3)(b) would be raised but would be overcome by limiting the specification to ‘Cream complying with the specifications of the PDO Cornish Clotted Cream’.\n\nMark - NESCO Cornish Clotted Cream Goods - Foodstuffs\n\nAn objection under section 3(4) and 3(3)(b) would be raised but would be overcome by limiting the specification to ‘Cream, all complying with the specifications of the PDO Cornish Clotted Cream’. If the applicant responds and requests that the goods should also include ‘Fresh Meat and frozen peas, this would be acceptable with a specification of ‘cream complying with the specification of the PDO Cornish Clotted Cream; Fresh Meat; frozen peas’.\n\nMark - SHETLAND LAMB Goods - Foodstuffs\n\nAn objection under section 3(4) and 3(3)(b) would be raised in respect of ‘lamb’ but would be overcome by limiting the specification to ‘Lamb complying with the specifications of the PDO Shetland Lamb’. If the applicant responds and requests that other goods should also be included, acceptability would depend on whether the goods are considered to be similar to those which are protected and if they could ‘include’ the protected product. For example, ‘pies’ would not be acceptable (unless they are limited to pies containing Shetland Lamb) as they could include Shetland Lamb as a main ingredient. Therefore, the specification should be amended to read as ‘Pies with lamb complying with the specifications of the PDO Shetland Lamb’. In contrast, a request for goods such as ‘butter’, for example, would be acceptable unqualified.\n\nThe Regulations protecting Geographical Indications also refer to ‘misuse’, ‘imitation’ and ‘evocation’ of GIs. Accordingly, the Registrar will raise an objection under Section 3(4) in instances where the mark ‘imitates’ (mimics, reproduces elements of, etc.) a Geographical Indication, with the result that the product designated by the PDO/PGI is ‘evoked’ (called to mind). By way of example-\n\nMark - GERSEE ROYALTY Goods - Potatoes; live animals\n\nThe mark clearly brings to mind or evokes the PDO ‘Jersey Royal potatoes’. An objection would therefore be raised under section 3(4) on the basis that the mark is evocative of the PDO ‘Jersey Royal potatoes’ in respect of ‘Potatoes’. It is acceptable, however, for ‘live animals’ as these are not considered to be comparable products.\n\nMark - BLU STILL-TON Goods - Cheese; dried fruit\n\nAgain, the above mark clearly evokes the PDO ‘Blue Stilton’ and an objection will be raised under section 3(4). However, ‘dried fruit’ is acceptable, as this is not a dairy product.\n\nIn both of the examples above, it is not possible to overcome the objection under section 3(4) by limiting the specification because the marks do not incorporate the precise GI or a significant element thereof. In the ‘BLU STILL-TON’ example above, a limitation stating, ‘Cheese complying with the specifications of the PDO Blue Stilton’ cannot apply, as the mark does not contain the registered Geographical Indication ‘Blue Stilton’.\n\nIn accordance with section 5(4)(a) of the Act, where marks consist of or contain a registered Geographical Indication which has attracted an objection under section 3(4), the details of the conflicting GIs will be provided to the applicant in the examination report.\n\nWhere a Geographical Indication is protected in Northern Ireland only (under the EU Scheme) or instead, is only protected in GB (under the DEFRA scheme), applicants may apply a territorial limitation under Section 13(1) of the Act, in order to overcome an objection under Section 3(4) and 3(3)(b). For example, where an objection is raised against a Trade Mark Application due to a GI which is protected in Northern Ireland only, an applicant may elect to apply a territorial limitation to their application, limiting their Trade Mark rights to England, Scotland and Wales only, thereby avoiding a conflict with the GI protected in Northern Ireland.\n\nGeographical place names\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe law regarding registration of geographical place names as trade marks has been explained and clarified by the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJEU’) in its judgments on cases Windsurfing Chiemsee v Boots Attenberger (‘Chiemsee’) C-108/97 and C-109/97 (PDF, 838KB) and by the European General Court in cases Nordmilch eG v OHIM (‘Oldenburger’) T-295/01 (PDF, 108KB) and Peek & Cloppenburg KG v OHIM (‘Cloppenberg’) T-379/03.\n\nThe circumstances around the two Chiemsee judgments related to commercial activity which took place on or around the shores of Lake Chiemsee in Bavaria, Germany and, in particular, attempts made by one provider of sports goods to prevent others from using the term ‘Chiemsee’ in their course of trade. On referral to the CJEU, the Court was tasked with determining the extent to which geographical place names (such as the name of a lake used for water sports) should be entitled to protection as trade marks.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the CJEU emphasised the need to consider a range of factors when assessing the inherent distinctiveness of such a sign, including inter alia the extent of any current association between the place name and the goods or services intended for protection, and the perception of those relevant consumers likely to encounter the sign when used as a trade mark.\n\nThe Court’s conclusions are effectively set out in paragraphs 31 through 36, which are set out below:\n\n“31 Thus, under Article 3(1)(c) of the Directive [equivalent to section 3(1)(c) of the UK Trade Marks Act 1994 or ‘UKTMA’], the competent authority must assess whether a geographical name in respect of which an application for registration as a trade mark is made designates a place which is currently associated in the mind of the relevant class of persons with the category of goods concerned, or whether it is reasonable to assume that such an association may be established in the future.\n\n32 In the latter case, when assessing whether the geographical name is capable, in the mind of the relevant class of persons, of designating the origin of the category of goods in question, regards must be had more particularly to the degree of familiarity amongst such persons with that name, with the characteristics of the place designated by the name, and with the category of goods concerned.\n\n33 In that connection, Article 3(1)(c) of the Directive [section 3(1)(c) UKTMA] does not in principle preclude the registration of geographical names which are unknown to the relevant class of persons or at least unknown as the designation of a geographical location or of names in respect of which, because of the type of place they designate (say, a mountain or lake), such persons are unlikely to believe that the category of goods concerned originates there.\n\n34 However, it cannot be ruled out that the name may serve to designate geographical origin within the meaning of Article 3(1)(c) [section 3(1)(c) UKTMA], even for goods such as those in the main proceedings [being, in that particular case, items of sports clothing], provided that the name could be understood by the relevant class of persons [to include the shores of the lake or the surrounding area].\n\n35 It follows from the foregoing that the application of Article 3(1)(c) [section 3(1)(c) UKTMA] does not depend on there being a real, current or serious need to leave a sign or indication free.\n\n36 Finally, it is important to note that, whilst an indication of the geographical origin of goods to which Article 3(1)(c) [section 3(1)(c) UKTMA] applies usually indicates the place where the goods were or could be manufactured, the connection between a category of goods and a geographical location might depend on other ties, such as the fact that the goods were conceived and designed in the geographical location concerned.\n\nThe judgment confirms that Article 3(1)(c) of the Directive (3(1)(c) UKTMA) will apply either:\n\nwhere the sign applied for designates a geographical place name which, in the minds of the relevant public, is already associated with the goods/services listed in the application;\n\nOr:\n\nwhere there is no current association, but the name is liable to be used in the future by undertakings as an indication of the geographical origin of the goods/services concerned\n\nThe decision confirms that when assessing whether the name is liable to be used as a designation of the geographical origin of the goods/services, the registering authority must consider the degree of familiarity amongst the relevant class of persons with the geographical name in question, the characteristics of the place designated by that name, and the nature of the goods/services concerned. At the same time, there is acknowledgement that it is not necessary for goods to be manufactured in a place before the name is liable to be excluded from registration as a trade mark for those goods.\n\nIn all cases, and notwithstanding the fact that the wording of section 3(1)(c) refers specifically to ‘geographical origin’, the ‘association’ between place name and product, which the Court has confirmed is central to the assessment, need not be limited to a consideration of whether the word designates the ‘place of manufacture’ (or, in the case of services, the ‘place of rendering’). It could equally apply to the place in which the product has been designed, or simply where it has been marketed and/or sold. To use an obvious example, the word ‘China’ used on a range of electronic products would undoubtedly be perceived as a reference to the place of manufacture i.e. quite literally, the product’s geographical place of origin. Equally, the word ‘Blackpool’ used on a t-shirt, novelty hat or other souvenir/gift is likely to be perceived as a reference to geographical origin (even though the relevant consumer is unlikely to assume the product was actually manufactured in Blackpool). Although in each of these examples the ‘association’ between product and place name is subtly different, both cases would attract an objection under section 3(1)(c).\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that objections will be taken against trade marks designating geographical locations on account of them denoting nothing more than a place of sale (if that were the case, almost any and every geographical trade mark would attract an objection on the basis that products can, in theory at least, be supplied from almost anywhere). Rather, it means that consideration of the geographical significance will be assessed in a fairly broad context and will seek to identify an association (or the future likelihood of an association), in the mind of relevant consumer, between the geographical place name and the goods/services applied for.\n\nGeographical place names with a known association to goods/services listed in the application\n\nIn situations where the examiner is aware of a known and established association between, on the one hand, a geographical area/locality (which is the subject of the trade mark application) and, on the other, the goods or services intended for protection, then an objection under section 3(1)(c) is likely to be raised.\n\nIn the case of names of countries (which, barring names of continents, will naturally denote the largest ‘type’ of geographical area), it is unlikely (although not inevitable) that a UK consumer will perceive such terms used in the context of goods offered for sale as being anything other than a reference to place of manufacture or commercial origin. To illustrate the point, the sign ‘Germany’ is unlikely to be deemed inherently distinctive for any type of product because of the extent of its commercial activity (and the reputation it enjoys because of that activity). From being used on a foodstuff supplied in a supermarket, to being used on a piece of highly specialised dental apparatus, to being used in respect of a financial service, the relevant consumer’s perception of the sign will be consistent.\n\nThe size of the geographical location will be a consideration under section 3(1)(c), although it may not always be the determinative factor. Applying the logic set out in Chiemsee, the name of a city, town, village or any commercial ‘area’ is just as likely to attract an objection under section 3(1)(c) as is the name of a country, provided it is understood by the relevant consumer as enjoying an association with the goods and/or services intended for protection (or is deemed liable to do so in the future). The city of London enjoys a reputation for all manner of products, be they financial services, tourist attractions, accommodation, fashion items and souvenirs, so the sign ‘London’ would face an objection for such goods/services and potentially more. At the same time, the city of Stoke-on-Trent, with a significantly lower geographical footprint and population count (36 square miles compared to London’s 607 square miles, and 469,000 people compared to London’s 8.5 million) has a disproportionately strong reputation for pottery products. As a result, and notwithstanding its relatively small geographical footprint, an application for the place name ‘Stoke-on-Trent’ would attract an objection where it relates to ceramics and pottery products.\n\nBeyond the more conventional forms of geographical place names (being countries, cities, and towns), section 3(1)(c) can equally apply to any other designation of geographical area be it inter alia a district, a mountain, a lake (see Chiemsee, for example), a commercial district, see Canary Wharf [2015] EWHC 1588 (Ch) a natural spring, a resort, or a place of natural beauty. Wherever it is considered that the relevant consumer will make an association between the place name and the product(s) intended for protection, then an objection will be likely. Equally, where it is considered that other traders may genuinely seek to use the geographical place-name in their future course of trade (most likely, again, because of the existence of an association between the place and the product) then an objection will apply. This means that a sign such as ‘the Brecon Beacons’ would be objectionable for leisure and sporting activities, and a sign such as ‘Padstow Harbour’ would be objectionable for seafood.\n\nGeographical place names without any known association for the goods/services listed in the application\n\nExaminers will often be required to assess a geographical place name’s inherent distinctiveness without the benefit of clear evidence to demonstrate an existing reputation. In Chiemsee, the CJEU confirmed that an existing or current reputation or association is not an essential requirement for finding a sign to be objectionable under section 3(1)(c), meaning that there will be geographical place names which do not enjoy the type of reputation mentioned above, but which nevertheless will face an objection.\n\nWhere the geographical place name intended for protection has no obvious reputation, it must still be considered how the mark will be perceived in trade. In order to do so, consideration will be given to all facts related to the place name including, but not limited to, the size of the location, and the extent and nature of commercial activity that goes on within its boundaries. Assessing the place name ‘Canary Wharf’ in the context of section 3(1)(c), Mr Iain Purvis QC, sitting as Deputy Judge of the High Court in Canary Wharf Group Plc v The Comptroller of Trade Marks [2015] EWHC 1588 (Ch)) stated the following:\n\nA large number of services falling with the Nice Classification (possibly most services)… are of a kind that one would expect to be available locally in any major centre of population in the UK. The names of most cities and towns would therefore be capable, when used in the UK, of designating the geographical origin of those services and therefore would be excluded from registration under section 3(1)(c) in the absence of acquired distinctiveness.” (Paragraph 22)\n\nThis paragraph, which specifically refers to services as opposed to goods, suggests that most, if not all, “major” centres of population within the UK will at least have the potential to be perceived as designating geographical, rather than commercial, origin. So objections against the names of most major UK cities and towns may be appropriate even where those locations are not shown to have demonstrable reputations for all the various services listed across the Nice Classification.\n\nAlthough the Canary Wharf decision makes it clear that the size of the location is not the exclusive consideration, it is arguably the most significant, and the size of the location will always be a dominant factor. The Canary Wharf judgement used the term “major centre of population”. When assessing place names which are not ‘major centres of population’ and which have no clear association with the goods/services intended for protection (or any basis for believing there will be a future association), there will clearly be a strong case for acceptance (see, for example, the European General Court’s comments in Peek & Cloppenburg KG v OHIM (‘Cloppenburg’) T-379/03 (PDF, 714KB). For example, Abertillery Blues Festival is prima facie distinctive, as it is such a small town (less than 12,000 population) that it is unlikely to be a) known UK-wide, and b) expected to have more than one blues music festival. However, Abertillery Estate Agents, for example, would face an objection as it is likely that every town and city, including the smaller ones, will have a dedicated local estate agents.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Canary Wharf decision explained considerations for services only. In relation to goods, it should not automatically be assumed that most towns and cities are likely to produce them. Whilst every town, regardless of size, would likely offer library services, not every town would produce tea bags, and so the consideration of reputation becomes more prevalent. For example, Oxford Leisure Centre would face an objection under 3(1)(c), however, Oxford Tea Bags would not.\n\nEach case will be assessed on its own merits. The examples above have been selected in order to illustrate the more fundamental principles for assessing geographical-type trade marks. In addition to the scenarios set out above, the following paragraphs provide tailored guidance in relation to some specific types of geographical trade marks.\n\nOverseas locations\n\nIn respect of place names which designate overseas locations, the assessment will be the same as it is for UK locations (see previous references to ‘China’ and ‘Germany’ above). Nevertheless, it should also be borne in mind that towns, cities and regions located in countries outside of the UK are unlikely to be as familiar to UK consumers as those which are within the UK. In practice, therefore, it may be easier to register the name of a small or medium-size location in (say) Poland, than it would be to register the name of a comparably-sized location in the UK for the same product. Again, each case will be assessed on its own facts.\n\nLocally-provided services\n\nWhere an application seeks to protect the name of a small geographical area with no apparent reputation for any particular product, there may be a case for raising an objection where the services claimed are of a local nature. Consider, for example, attempts to protect place-names such as ‘Christchurch’ or ‘Lydney’ (small towns in Dorset and Gloucestershire respectively) for dentistry services and/or local bus transport services. In each case, notwithstanding the relatively small size of the geographical area, the lack of a particular reputation, and the potential for the place-names to be unknown to those UK consumers based outside of either Dorset or Gloucestershire, there may still be a case for objection under section 3(1)(c) on the basis that such terms should be kept free for others to use - most notably, other dentists and bus service providers in Christchurch and Lydney. When considering the question of locally-provided services in the context of Canary Wharf, Mr Purvis QC stated the following at paragraph 24:\n\n(The names of small towns and villages) would cover many place names which are unknown to the majority of potential consumers of the services in question in the UK. Such names are capable of designating geographic origin to people living in or near the town or village in question, but perhaps not to the ‘average consumer’. The CJEU in Windsurfing Chiemsee noted in paragraph 33 that names which were ‘unknown to the relevant class of persons’ were not ‘in principle’ prohibited from registration. On the other hand, it could be said… that the public policy underlying the restriction on registration of geographical terms is not served by allowing monopolies to be obtained over the names of small towns for the kind of services already being provided by numerous traders in those towns.\n\nNatural Produce (in particular, processed and unprocessed foodstuffs)\n\nThe names of places which are likely to be the source of natural produce are unlikely to be registrable as trade marks for such goods even if the place identified by the mark has no specific reputation. A place will have to be obscure before its name can be registered as a trade mark for unprocessed products of the kind frequently sold from roadsides and farm shops, such as fruit and vegetables, flowers, potatoes, water, eggs and milk. This may not be the case in respect of processed foodstuffs, which are less likely to be associated with local producers and providers. In the case of such products, the names of a larger, more populous areas may be objectionable if the examiner considers them likely to be perceived as a reference to where the foodstuff was processed.\n\nPostal addresses\n\nA number of applications seeking to register postal address as trade marks have been made in recent years. This may reflect the growing trend to promote and market new commercial and residential developments by reference to postal address in which they are found. In most cases the sign intended for protection has commonly consisted of only part of the full postal address i.e. ‘5 Grand Plaza’ or ‘1 Central Square’. In such cases, and notwithstanding any intentions of the part of the applicant to use the sign as a trade mark as opposed to a mere address, an objection will be taken wherever it is found that the sign does exist as an actual postal location. Where the applicant contests that such a sign has been used as a trade mark (as opposed to a simple address), then they may use the proviso to section 3(1), which allows such objections to be overcome where it can be demonstrated that the sign has acquired distinctive character through the use made of it.\n\nIt should also be noted that full postal addresses (such as, for example, ’12 High Street, Kidderminster, KM6 8TR’) will be subject to an objection under section 3(1)(b) on the basis that they are devoid of any distinctive character. The objection will apply regardless of context.\n\nGet up (‘Surplus’)\n\nWhen considering whether a trade mark, has any distinctive character, one must consider whether the sign, as a whole, will identify the trade source of the goods or services to the average consumer.\n\nConsideration will be given to the impact of the configuration or presentation, the extent of the descriptiveness of the word element, and the interplay between the two. The more the word element appears to be a generic description of the product, the less likely it is that the average consumer will perceive the sign in its totality as being a trade mark, and the less likely it is that such perceptions will be changed by minor elements of stylisation and/or get-up. The distinctive element must also be of a sufficient size in the mark as a whole to be noticeable to the average consumer. The distinctive element must be visible and legible as a matter of first impression.\n\nConsider, for example, the following trade mark filed in respect of computer programming:\n\nThe stylised font used in the above example is reasonably generic and does not imbue the mark with a trade mark character.\n\nWhere the application is for a shape and includes a distinctive word or figurative element, the mark will generally be acceptable. This is because the mark cannot be said to consist exclusively of a sign which may serve in trade to designate the kind of goods, and cannot be said to be devoid of any distinctive character.\n\nThe following examples show marks which all contain a descriptive word element combined with a particular form of presentation and/or additional figurative elements. Although the word elements are descriptive when considered in their own right, the unusual presentation in each of these marks i.e. the ‘get up’ or ‘surplus’ renders the marks as a whole distinctive and therefore acceptable\n\nIn contrast, the following marks which also consist of descriptive words combined with an additional figurative element are open to objection on the basis that their additional elements are either imperceptible in normal use, or they reinforce the descriptive message of the words.\n\nGold\n\nWhere the word ‘gold’ will be seen in a laudatory or descriptive manner, an objection under sections 3(1) (b) and (c) will be raised. The Appointed Person has upheld the refusal of BONUS GOLD ([1998] RPC 859) for financial services, accepting that the word ‘gold’ is used in a laudatory fashion in that particular sector. Clearly, alongside its use as a laudatory term, the word ‘gold’ will have its literal and obvious meaning as a precious metal or colour, and so objections based on that characteristic will be equally valid.\n\nGreen crosses\n\nGreen crosses on a white background are generic for pharmacy and medical goods and services. White crosses on green backgrounds are generic for first aid goods and services. Such devices are not specifically covered by the Geneva Convention (see Red Crosses), but would be objectionable under section 3(1)(b). They would be considered to be non-distinctive if used alone for goods and services in those fields. Use in combination with additional distinctive elements, however, would not face an objection.\n\nH\n\nHolograms\n\nHolograms can operate as trade marks provided they are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings and can be represented via an MP4 file or a graphic or photographic reproduction.\n\nThe acceptability of holograms, like words or other types of trade marks, must depend upon whether it is, or has become, a distinctive sign; that is, whether the average consumer will perceive the moving image(s) as meaning that the goods or services are exclusively associated with one undertaking. Consideration should also be given to whether other economic operators are likely to need to use the same or similar image(s) in the ordinary course of their business. For example, a hologram of a teapot pouring tea into a cup will not be distinctive for e.g. café services or for tea, whereas a hologram showing a spinning gyroscope for tea would be.\n\nHouse of\n\nTrade marks containing the expression ‘House of…’ will normally be accepted even if accompanied by a descriptive or non-distinctive word unless the word ‘house’ is established within the relevant industry. For example, the sign ‘HOUSE OF FASHION’, intended for use in respect of clothing, would not be acceptable because the term ‘fashion house’ is well-known and in common use. The same would apply to a sign such as ‘HOUSE OF FINANCE’, for use in respect of financial services, on the basis that ‘finance house’ is a known term. In contrast, a sign such as ‘HOUSE OF SPEED’, intended for use in respect of, say, computers or kitchen appliances would be acceptable.\n\nI\n\nI or i\n\nThe single letter ‘i’, whether presented in lower or upper case, will be considered acceptable unless the examiner identifies (for example, as a result of undertaking Internet research) that the letter is being used in a descriptive way, either on its own or as a prefix in combination with other descriptive words.\n\nInternational civil defence sign\n\nThe International Civil Defence sign consists of an equilateral blue triangle completely surrounded by an orange background, as illustrated below:\n\nUse of this symbol within the UK requires the consent of the Secretary of State for Defence under the provisions of section 6(1) of the Geneva Conventions Amendment Act 1995. As a result, trade mark applications which consist of or contain either the symbol or anything which so nearly resembles it to the point of being capable of being mistaken for the symbol, are open to objection under section 3(4) for all goods and services.\n\nJ\n\nJust\n\nThe word ‘just’ has a number of meanings including ‘we specialise in’. For example, the mark ‘JUST EDUCATION’, applied for in respect of educational services, will merely indicate a specific specialism in educational services, see the High Court judgment Just Employment (a firm) v Just Employment Law Ltd [[2007] EWHC 2203 (Ch)]). For certain goods, the word ‘just’ also denotes purity or concentration, for example, the words ‘JUST JUICE’ in respect of fruit drinks would be objectionable. The same would apply to “Simply”.\n\nL\n\nLabels (Representations of)\n\nFigurative representations of labels are considered to be devoid of any distinctive character, and an objection under section 3(1)(b) will be appropriate in most cases. In certain cases, a composite label device may be found to be commonly used in trade e. g. a basic label shape decorated with grapes or vines may be seen to be common in trade where the goods concerned are wines.\n\nThe following mark would be open to objection under section 3(1)(b) as labels similar to the one depicted are commonly found on the necks of wine or beer bottles.\n\nLandscapes\n\nImages of landscapes for goods such as foodstuffs, especially pastoral scenes on milk and dairy products, mountain scenes on mineral water etc, are considered unacceptable because they are commonly used as mere decorative matter. An objection under section 3(1)(b) would be appropriate.\n\nLetters and numerals\n\nLetters and numerals may be acceptable where they have no meaning in respect of the goods and services claimed in the application, for example, the mark ‘X1’ for fruit juice. However, letters and numerals which designate characteristics of the goods/services and/or which are customary in the trade are excluded from registration by sections 3(1)(c) and/or (d). The following are given as examples:\n\ndate of production of goods/provision of services for example ‘1996’ and ‘2000’\n\nsize of the product for example. ‘XL’ for clothes, ‘1600’ for cars, ‘34R’ for clothing, and ‘185/65’ for tyres\n\nquantity for example ‘200’ for cigarettes\n\ndates for example. ‘1066’ for history books, ‘1996’ for wines\n\ntelephone codes for example ‘0800’ and ‘0500’\n\ntime of provision of the product for example ‘8-10’, and ‘24/7’\n\npower of the goods for example ‘115’ for engines and or cars where it denotes BHP (Brake Horse Power)\n\nmemory size for example ‘32GB’ for computer storage devices\n\nstrength for example. ‘8.5%’ for lager\n\nDistinctiveness - Well known practices of trade to be considered\n\nNumerals such as 18 or 21 are commonly used on jewellery to denote milestone birthdays. Similarly, single letters are often adorned on certain items of jewellery as mere decoration to signify the wearer’s name(s) through initials. Single letters can also be used descriptively on other goods, for example the letters ‘L‘ and ‘S’ are often used to denote performance characteristics of a range of cars or sizes on clothes.. Such non-trade mark use is unlikely to indicate the origin of the goods, and so an objection under section 3(1)(b) and or (c) would be appropriate. However, in instances where research or general knowledge fails to identify a history of non trade mark use of letters/numbers in a particular trade or for the goods/services claimed, the application will be accepted.\n\nAbbreviations, acronyms or initials\n\nTrade marks consisting of abbreviations, acronyms or initials will be accepted unless research indicates that the letters represent descriptive words used in trade to denote the goods and/or services intended for protection. For example ABS (Advanced Braking System) for braking systems, CAD (Computer Aided Design) for computer software, PMS (PreMenstrual Syndrome) for pharmaceutical products. In such cases an objection under section 3(1)(c) will be taken.\n\nAbbreviations, acronyms or initials coupled with their full meaning\n\nThe CJEU judgment in the combined cases Alfred Strigl Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt and Securvita Gesellschaft zur Entwicklung alternativer Versicherungskonzepte mbH v Öko-Invest Verlagsgesellschaft mbH (C-90/11 and C-91/11) confirmed that the trade marks ‘Multi Market Funds MMF’ and ‘NAI-Der Nature-Aktien-Index’ would be seen as descriptive for their respective goods and services. In respect of the term ‘multi market funds’ it had been established that this was descriptive for the services claimed, namely financial services, but the Court went on to find that the three-letter combination ‘MMF’ would be understood as an abbreviation for the accompanying word elements, but only if it appeared in combination with the word elements. The Court was unconcerned with determining whether or not the three-letter combination ‘MMF’ was already established as an abbreviation for the term ‘multi market fund’, or with the extent to which it might have other meanings. This identifies that there does not need to be current use of an abbreviation in order for an objection to be raised, so long as the abbreviation represents the additional descriptive word combination.\n\nTherefore where the mark consists of a letter and word combination and the letter sequence clearly and unambiguously represents the initial letter of each accompanying word in the mark, an objection under section 3(1)(c) will be raised. For example, the sign ‘MGS Missile Guidance System’, applied for in respect of ‘electronic apparatus’, would face objection under section 3(1)(c).\n\nIn instances where the word element is not descriptive but is considered to be devoid of any distinctive character pursuant to section 3(1)(b), the combination will be considered to be acceptable. For example ‘SFR Super Fast Ride’ in respect of ‘cars and vans’ would be acceptable because the term Super Fast Ride is merely non distinctive for cars and vans, it is not directly descriptive. Therefore the combination with the abbreviation SFR makes the mark acceptable as a whole.\n\nLink\n\nWhere the word ‘link’ is used as a prefix or suffix for a descriptive word, and where the resulting combination has a clear meaning, the resulting sign should be objected to under sections 3(1)(b) and (c) for example ‘LINK HEATHROW’ for bus or train services; ‘COMPUTERLINK’ for network communication apparatus; ‘FASTLINK’ for computer software and telecommunication services.\n\nOther combinations containing the word ‘link’ which do not create either a descriptive or non-distinctive whole will usually be acceptable. For example ‘TABLE LINK’ for tables; ‘BABY LINK’ for baby toys; ‘PAPER LINK’ for paper clips are acceptable.\n\nM\n\nM’ or ‘m’\n\nThe single letter ‘M’ used as a prefix (whether in upper or lower case) denotes the word ‘mobile’ in the context of conducting banking, bill payments and commerce via wireless handheld devices (Collins Dictionary refers). An application for a word which describes the goods or services applied for and is prefixed with the letter ‘m’ may be objectionable under sections 3(1)(b) and (c), and in some cases\n\nMagazines and magazines titles\n\nBy their very nature, magazine titles tend to contain descriptive elements. This is to enable the average consumer to know, more or less, the content of the magazine. Nevertheless, consumers are used to relying on them as indicators of commercial origin and so consequently they can function as trade marks.\n\nThis approach was confirmed in The Adult Channel (R772/2000-4)) to accept the mark in respect of entertainment services and publications. Whilst not binding upon the Registrar, the reasoning set out in this decision is logical, and reflects the IPO’s own practice The decision stated:\n\n24 Furthermore in the specific field of printed matter, and particularly in that of newspapers, the tolerance of ‘descriptive’ marks has been traditionally broader than in other sectors. This established trade practice should be taken into consideration when assessing the descriptiveness of the mark in relation to the nature of the specified goods, whose relevant consumers, in the case the relevant readers, are so familiar with this practice that they see marks, which they would not acknowledge as such in other areas of trade, as normal.\n\nWhilst consumers may be familiar with such trade practices, this does not mean that wholly descriptive terms intended for use in respect of magazines and closely related goods and services are always automatically acceptable. The most descriptive of terms will still be objectionable even where used on magazines. For example, the mark ‘SEA FISHING MAGAZINE’, applied for in respect of magazines would attract an objection under sections 3(1)(b) and (c).\n\nThe mark would also be objectionable for the following goods and services as they are considered closely related to magazines:\n\nClass 9: Electronic magazines (downloadable). Class 16: Printed matter; books; printed publications. Class 41: Publishing services; Non downloadable electronic magazines.\n\nThe signs ‘NURSES MAGAZINE’ and ‘NURSING MAGAZINE’ would be objectionable. This is because they are purely descriptive marks which consist essentially of the name of the subject matter (as plainly as it can be) plus the name of the publication type. The signs ‘NURSING TIMES’ and ‘NURSING WEEKLY’ would be acceptable, however, as they are not immediately and exclusively descriptive.\n\nMaster\n\nAccording to Collins Dictionary, MASTER relates to “a person with exceptional skill at a certain thing”, for example MASTER BUILDER and MASTER CRAFTSMAN. MASTER is consequently much more likely to be meaningful in relation to services rather than to goods. For example ‘MASTER BRICK’ would be acceptable in respect of bricks, but ‘MASTER BRICKLAYER’ would be objectionable for building services.\n\nA further meaning given for the word ‘master’ is “a machine or device that operates to control a similar one” (Collins Dictionary). The word therefore can also be used in trade to describe goods with a control function, for example, a ‘MASTER CONTROL’.\n\nAs a general rule, signs containing the word ‘master’ should be assessed as follows:\n\n‘master’ (alone) is acceptable for goods/services which do not have a control function (e.g. beds, or cleaning services), or for goods/services not provided by ‘artisans’ (that is, a worker in a skilled trade, especially one that involves making things by hand). Conversely, the word is objectionable for goods/services with a control function provided by artisans\n\n‘master’ combined with descriptive words is acceptable for goods which do not have a control function e.g. ‘MASTERBUS’ or ‘BUSMASTER’ intended for use in respect of buses, and ‘SWINGMASTER’ intended for use in respect of golf clubs. However, the word is objectionable when combined with goods which do have a control function for example ‘MASTERSWITCH’ for electric switches, or ‘MASTERKEY’ for keys\n\n‘master’ combined with a word which does not directly describe goods or services provided by an artisan is acceptable for example ‘OFFICE MASTER’ intended for use in respect of cleaning services. Conversely, the word is objectionable when combined with a word describing products or services provided and/or rendered by artisans for example ‘MASTER PRINTERS’ for printing services, or ‘MASTER BAKER’ for bakery services\n\nMotion marks\n\nMotion marks can function as indicators of trade origin provided that they are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings and are either graphically represented (as below) or held on digital files, ie namely MP4. Both of these criteria must be considered when deciding whether or not to accept the mark. In the example shown below of a coin being dropped into a money box, considerable effort had been invested in ensuring that the representation was acceptable in accordance with all the Sieckmann (PDF, 722KB) criteria i.e. the representation should be “clear, precise, self-contained, easily accessible, intelligible, durable, and objective”. This criteria applies equally to digital files in respect of a motion mark.\n\nMark description:\n\nThe trade mark is an animated sequence consisting of 35 still images that make up the sequence changing within a timeframe of approximately six seconds and which starts with the smiling pig device which then blinks, wiggles its ears, looks upwards with its eyes, receives six gold coins falling from above at regular intervals into the pig device’s coin slot, wiggles its ears as the gold coins fall inside and smiles, wiggles its bottom to shake the gold coins around inside and finishes the sequence with a broad smile.\n\nThis application was filed for a wide variety of goods and services in classes 4, 9, 35, 37, 38 and 39, with the core services being related to the provision of gas and electricity.\n\nIn this example, the mark satisfies both criteria, namely that it is suitably represented and is distinctive for the goods and services applied for.\n\nSimple animations are now used so extensively on websites and other digital media meaning that the consumer is less likely to perceive them as trade marks, than the more traditional word or figurative trade marks. An objection under sections 3(1)(b) and/or (c) would therefore be appropriate for non-distinctive and descriptive animations.\n\nMulti component marks (Trade marks made up of a number of components, each of which is descriptive)\n\nMarks which consist of a number of descriptive elements are themselves descriptive if the combination creates a descriptive totality. However there may be instances where the combination and placement of descriptive elements creates a distinctive totality. For example ‘THE SIX BLADED RAZOR’ for razors would be objectionable, whereas ‘RAZOR BLADED SIX’ would be acceptable.\n\nIn Campina Melkunie BV v Benelux-Merkenbureau (C-265/00 the CJEU determined that a trade mark composed of multiple elements, each of which is descriptive of the goods/services in the application, is excluded from registration under section 3(1)(c) unless there is a perceptible difference in the meaning created by the sum of its descriptive parts.\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether the ground for refusal set out in section 3(1)(c) applies to such a mark, it is irrelevant whether or not there are synonyms capable of designating the same characteristics of the goods or services referred to in the application for registration. This may apply even where the combination of descriptive parts creates a word or phrase which has not been seen before and is unlikely to be used by other traders.\n\nThese principles were confirmed in the CJEU’s decision in BioID v OHIM (C-37/03 P (PDF, 810KB)), where, taking into account that the fact that Bio is an abbreviation of the adjective ‘biometrical’ and ID is the abbreviation of the noun ‘identification’, the previously unseen combination as a "
