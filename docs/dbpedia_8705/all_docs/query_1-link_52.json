        "text": "The Chronicle May 14, 1999 Chronicle 3 3 join Cleo and John! Laine and Dankworth have spent four and a half decades at the top of the musical tree. The couple's association goes back 1 to the 1950s when she auditioned for a place in his band. Laine herself has branched out as a singer and actress, appearing in a variety of West End productions including Valmouth in 1959, A Time To Laugh in 1961 and a triumphant production of Showboat at the Adelphi Theatre in 1971. In 1961, she had a huge top five hit record with You'll Answer To Me followed in 1964 by the critically acclaimed album Shakespeare and All That Jazz. In 1972, she began her assault on the international market with a tour of Australia, concerts at New York's Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall and coast-to-coast tours of USA and Canada .\n\nIn 1979, she received an OBE for services to music and in the Queen's Birthday honours list in June 1997, she was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire. Her autobiography Cleo was published in September 1994 by Simon and Schuster and her second book, You Can Sing If You Want To, was published last year.
