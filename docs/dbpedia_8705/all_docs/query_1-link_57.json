        "text": "Countries around the world are becoming a real force when it comes to producing whisky, as our judges can attest.\n\nW­hile drinkers around the world have long professed their love for single malt Scotch, Irish whiskey, and Bourbon, the past few years have seen whisky made in places such as Taiwan or Finland giving traditional distillers a run for their money. The so-called ‘world whisky’ category, while broad, is showcasing innovative liquid that is often not as limited in terms of regulations on the production side.\n\nTo decide which countries are putting out top-quality drams, we staged the latest iteration of our World Whisky Masters competition at Stereo in London’s Covent Garden in July.\n\nSeven panels of judges gathered for the 2024 blind-tasting competition, which is sponsored by closures producer Talis.\n\nPanel one was formed of freelance writer Ian Wisniewski, Julia Nourney, independent spirits consultant, and David T Smith, writer and co-founder of the Craft Distilling Expo, who chaired the group.\n\nPanel two was chaired by Melita Kiely, editor of The Spirits Business, and chair of The Global Spirits Masters Competitions (GSMC). She was joined by Herchelle Perez Terrado, of Inside Zero; Will Meredith, director of Daisy Age Drinks; and Joe Wadsack, owner of The Drinks Coach UK.\n\nThe third panel was formed of Matt Chambers, spirits writer and co-founder of the Whisky For Everyone blog (who chaired the group), alongside Renata Malakauskiene, whisky specialist at Grain & Glass, and Nick Larsson-Bell, buyer at Harvey Nichols.\n\nAntony Moss, spirits judge and consultant, chaired the fourth group, which included Joyce Chou, localisation programme manager for the Wine and Spirit Education Trust; and Richard Legg, founder of Distilled Knowledge.\n\nGroup five was led by chair Bryan Rodriguez-Curtis, wine brand manager at Treasury Wine Estates. Tatti Sukamongkol, on-trade and consumer account manager at Wanderlust Wine, and Ruchira Neotia, drinks consultant and founder, Neo Margarita, joined him. The sixth group was chaired by Nicola Carruthers, deputy editor of The Spirits Business, who was joined by Graham McAteer, spirit partnerships lead at Craft Gin Club, and Dan Greifer, bar supervisor at London’s Black Parrot.\n\nThe seventh panel was formed of Cosmo Boardman, creative director at Moore House Cocktail Co, freelance drinks writer Caroline Roddis, and Billy Abbott, ambassador at The Whisky Exchange, who chaired the group.\n\nAll’s well that blends well\n\nThe competition kicked off with a flight of European blended whiskies, in which judges were enthused to find two Masters from the get-go. The first went to Bellevoye Rouge, lauded for being “sweet with lots of stone fruit and cherry”, while stablemate Bellevoye Prune took home a Master for “lots of cherry on the nose, like kirschwasser”. The French whiskies were produced by Les Bienheureux.\n\nA Gold and two Silvers followed, with Gold-winning DYC 8 from Spain described as having “nice smoke alongside a fruity, good finish and nice oiliness”.\n\nEuropean single malts were put to the test next with 10 Golds and eight Silvers discovered. Among the Gold winners were two from Swedish whisky brand Agitator, for its Chestnut Cask and The Swedish Malt. The former was praised for having an “aromatic nose, some rich smoky notes, smoked peaches and apples alongside wood smoke and cooking spices”.\n\nWelsh distillery Penderyn also walked away with a duo of Golds, including one for its Penderyn Rich Oak, described as “light and vibrant on the palate, sweet and fresh”.\n\nRomania’s Alexandrion Saber Distilleries 1789 also proved successful in this round with four Golds. One of its Gold winners, Carpathian Single Malt Whisky Peated Cask Strength, was lauded for its “lovely texture, bold spice, nutty, peanut brittle, popped corn. Great complexity, water brings more caramel, oak spice”.\n\nLes Bienheureux also made another Gold appearance with its Beauchamp whisky, while England had a Gold winner in White Peak Distillery’s Wire Works Whisky Caduro. One judge said of the English whisky: “Peatiness on the palate; maple syrup with some smoky bacon. Some stewed apple, biscuit, and burnt caramel.”\n\nMoving over to European rye whiskies, and a pair of Golds were found. Blind Seal Straight Rye Whiskey was described as: “Spicy marmalade and toffee leads the nose. This follows through to the palate with assertive spice and solid intensity.”\n\nMeanwhile, fellow Gold winner Goldwaescher Swiss Rye Whisky had “thick rich and chewy rye notes, bread and spice; touch of chocolate”. Three Silvers concluded the flight.\n\nThe Asia region was sampled in the next round, kicking off with Japan – New Make, where Distillery Water Dragon’s Moon Shine won a Gold. Kiely said: “Bready and fruity aroma. Palate brings sweetness, fruitiness, sharp fruit, sweet honey. Almost milk-chocolatey. A touch of orange. Lovely texture, complex.”\n\nA tasting of single malts from Japan resulted in a Gold and a Silver, with Kanosuke Single Malt taking the former. Malakauskiene said: “Floral start that moves towards creamy notes. Nutmeg, banana pudding, toasted oak. Dry lingering finish.”\n\nFantastic example\n\nBut it was the Japan – Blended segment where a Master was discovered in Shibui Pure Malt 10 Year Whisky. Kiely enthused: “Nuttiness on the palate, hazelnuts. Some sweetness, caramel. Gentle spice notes – lovely balance, very elegant and easy to drink. A fantastic example of a blend.”\n\nFour Golds were also awarded to: Kanosuke Double Distillery; Misaka Aged 12 Years Mizunara Cask; Misaka Aged 12 Years PX Oloroso Sherry Cask; and Shibui Nokoribi Kara Lightly Peated 10 Year Whisky. Greifer was particularly fond of the Kanosuke whisky: “Stone fruits at the forefront, with an almost cherry blossom aroma coming afterwards. The palate is thick, and full of stone fruits and breaded malty flavours. The end of the finish is incredibly light, with this bright, florality that lingers.”\n\nMisaka Aged 12 Years PX Oloroso Sherry Cask offered a “floral nose, lots of nice grain – delicious and very well balanced”.\n\nThe single grain Japanese whisky flight was also a success, with two Golds, including one for Shibui Whisky Company. Gold winner Shibui White Oak 10 Year Single Grain Whisky was described by Kiely as having a “slight umami character; quite interesting and unique for a single grain. This is balanced with sweeter caramel, honeyed cereal notes. Intriguing and different, but still delicious.”\n\nFellow Gold winner Kanosuke Hioki Pot Still “has the element of spice that I would expect and want from a single grain, and then this nice sweet malt that just balances out the spice”, said Greifer.\n\nFrom Japan the panels headed to India, with a Master found in the single malt flight for United Spirits’ Godawan Century. The whisky offered a “Sherried aroma, rich and creamy”, while Griefer noted: “Delicate, aromatic and sweet… yet complex with its malt and fruit”. Two more Golds went to United Spirits for its Godawan Single Malt Fruit and Spice Artisan Whisky, and Godawan Single Malt Rich and Rounded Artisan Whisky. The latter was said to have a “nice spiced element, sweet and malty, with a slight peppery hint, with lots of tropical fruit and red dark fruits pushing through”. Five Silvers concluded the flight.\n\nThe judges then took in a flight of blended Asian whiskies (excluding Japan and Ireland) with a Gold given to Thai whisky Silver Knight, said to have a “malty toffee-citrus nose with delicate spices and apple following through to a pleasingly soft, milky mouthfeel”.\n\nTropical fruit\n\nAsia – Single Malts continued the high standard seen in earlier flights with a Master for two whiskies from Taiwanese distillery Kavalan. Kavalan Podium Single Malt Whisky impressed Chambers, who found: “Whiff of burnt caramel and tropical fruit on nose, juicy and fresh but with some developing woody spice and tannin, toffee and runny honey, white pepper and peach with some caramelised pineapple.”\n\nThe other Master winner, Kavalan Concertmaster Port Cask Finish Single Malt Whisky, was described by Greifer as having an “intense burst of flavours, that explode in the mouth, this delicate and smooth maltiness that rounds out the mouthfeel as well as sweet fruit”.\n\nKavalan’s success in the round continued as an astounding 14 Golds were awarded to the distiller. Of particular note was Kavalan Concertmaster Vinho Barrique Finish Single Malt Whisky, which was called a “perfectly good whisky that has a good quality level and a lovely texture and definition”.\n\nMeanwhile, Kavalan Master’s Select Reserve No.1 Single Malt Whisky was “elegant, fresh and peachy on the nose, white peach and jasmine, sweet and delicate on the palate” and Kavalan Lán Single Malt Whisky had “soft fruit with apricot, tannic red wine notes and a dry finish”.\n\nSingapore’s Yomatsuri Single Malt Whisky was the final Gold winner in this heat, with its “lovely balance; a slight balsamic sharpness; fruitiness shines through, grapes, raisins, some cooked apples. Lovely gently oak spice. Elegant and tasty.”\n\nAfter Asia came Australasia, with two Silvers awarded in the Blended flight. One product stood out among the rest in the next flight, Australasia – Single Malt, where Archie Rose Distilling Co joined the Master ranks. The Australian distiller’s Heritage Red Gum Cask Single Malt Whisky was a high point for Chambers: “Caramel, toffee and eucalyptus oil on the nose, some burnt wood also, very charismatic on the palate. Vibrant fruit and spice with toffee and caramel, bitter orange oil comes through as does some milk chocolate and cocoa, lovely background minty menthol note.”\n\nA strong set of Golds were also awarded – 13 in total – with four going to Tasmanian distiller Lark. The company’s Chinotto Citrus Cask has “intense lemon-orange chocolate” leading the nose with “sharp, concentrated orange, milky chocolate and baking spices” on the palate. Stablemate Dark Lark 2024 had “barley and nuts on the nose, slightly meaty feel”. Hellyers Road Distillery in Tasmania also won four Golds, including one for its 7 Years Old Peated, which reminded one judge of Scotch, with its “slightly smoky flavours with some sea salt notes”.\n\nGold winner Lawrenny Homestead Single Malt Whisky from Tasmania offered “peach and pineapple, tropical bright and exciting; balanced flavour, superb texture”, while 23rd Street Australian Whisky from the South Australian town of Renmark had “excellent texture, nutty spice, vanilla and plenty of wood”.\n\nNew Zealand whiskies also impressed with Golds for People’s Cut – New Zealand Single Malt Whisky, and Scapegrace Anthem. The latter impressed with its “smoked apple and pear, smoked stone fruit” and “rich palate”.\n\nThe panels moved to single grain whiskies from the region, with another Master found in Archie Rose’s Rye Malt Whisky. It was praised for its “gentle and fruity palate, with well-balanced oak and lingering fruit”. Archie Rose’s Smoked Heritage Rye Malt Whisky was Gold-worthy, with its notes of “apricots and honey on the nose”.\n\nThe Canadian contingent was assessed next, with three Golds for Campari Group’s Forty Creek brand in the Blended flight. Gold-winning Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve Whisky had flavours of “almonds, hazelnut, butterscotch, caramel, silky texture, medium intensity and finish”. Fellow Gold winner Forty Creek Barrel Select Whisky offered “candied nuts and orange peel. Delicate palate with pecan pie and delicate caramel”. Five more Silvers were awarded during the flight.\n\nA lone entrant in the next flight, Canada – Rye, resulted in a Gold for Pendleton 1910 Rye. Rodriguez-Curtis particularly enjoyed this expression: “The whisky shows good barrel character with some wood smoke, nutty and fruity character showing. The palate is quite rich, it has a good texture and a level of flavour I enjoy. It shows chocolate and a touch of coffee plus some woody vanilla notes.”\n\nThe Canada – Corn round led to a Gold for That Boutique‐y Whisky Company’s Canadian Corn Whisky 8 Years Old. The expression impressed with its “lovely nose with caramel and toffee-like sweetness, creamy and soft palate with buttery texture, some earthiness and soft vanilla ice cream, late woody dryness and peppery heat”.\n\nForty Creek went home with another Gold, this time for its Honey Spiced Flavoured Whisky in a tasting of flavoured whiskies from Canada. One judge said: “Honey is there on the nose, but the whisky aromas really come through, and it feels very harmonious.”\n\nMoving past Canada and onwards to the next flight, the judges found two Golds in the South Africa – Blended heat. Three Ships 5 Years Old Premium Select had a “very gentle and delicate nose, with light fruits and gentle sweet vanilla”.\n\nStablemate Three Ships Bourbon Cask Whisky was a deserving Gold winner, being praised by the judges for its “fruity, honey, vanilla notes, some complexity, smooth texture and medium finish”.\n\nThe World Blend flight also produced another Gold for That Boutique‐y Whisky Company, with the judges enjoying its World Whisky Blend. One of the judges particularly liked its “confected fruits, leather and dairy cream” aroma.\n\nThe last flight, New Make, ended on a high note, with a Master for Pale Ale Mash from Vietnamese distillery Về Để Đi. Smith said about the spirit: “Fragrant and perfumed, some estery notes and a little biscuitiness, lots of complexity and a touch of grape.”\n\nStablemate Brown Ale Mash went home with a Gold, enjoyed for its smokiness.\n\nAfter a day of tasting some delightful drams from around the globe, the judges were then tasked with a highlight of the competition – selecting this year’s World Whisky Taste Master. A retaste of all nine Master winners provided a surprise result – two Taste Masters – following a tie. The 2024 accolades were given to Indian whisky Godawan Century and Taiwan’s Kavalan Podium Single Malt Whisky.\n\nThe result is a testament to Asian whiskies, which are able to go head to head with their counterparts in established whisky regions. Another exciting area for whisky innovation is Tasmania, where the judges discovered plenty of high-quality drams.\n\nThe world whisky category continues to thrill drinkers, and there are still so many countries left to explore, and hidden gems to be found. Perhaps even more will be unearthed in next year’s competition.\n\nEurope (excluding Ireland and Scotland) – Blended Company Product Medal Les Bienheureux Bellevoye Rouge Master Les Bienheureux
