I was searching for information about the town of Shilel, Lithuania, where my grandfather was bom in 1871 and lived for four years before the family left for America. Family tradition held that the town had been destroyed and no longer could be found on the map of Lithuania. At the National Library in Jerusalem, a librarian recommended to me the Hebrew book Yehadut Lita, Volume III (Tel Aviv: Associa- tion of Lithuanian Jews in Israel, 1967) as the \"best source on the subject.\" I asked her if she had such a book in English. She said she often receives that request and left me with the charge: \"The English version you’ll just have to write yourself . \" In Yehadut Lita I found an article on Shilel. The last Jewish residents had indeed been driven out or killed in the Holocaust. But something has been preserved about the for- mer Jewish community in Shilel; moreover, it can be found on a map. I also found articles on other towns where my ancestors had lived and where my husband’s family had resided in southem Lithuania. When I mentioned my work to íriends and acquaintances, I was surprised at how many English speaking Jews said that they too had roots in the towns of Lithuania. I wondered why. Each time I heard about another Lithuanian town, I trans- lated the corresponding article on that town from Yehadut Lita. Eventually, I began to see a pattem unfolding. In the last century, generally miserable economic conditions or a sudden tragedy, such as a large fire, motivated thousands of Jewish residents to begin leaving for other lands - a migration that continued well into this century. Vlll LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES The rate of Jewish emigration from Lithuania was higher than it was ífom other parts of the Pale of Settlement. At fírst nearly everyone went to the U.S. Later, when American restrictions tightened, Lithuanian Jews poured into South Aíríca. About 75% of all South African Jewry originated in Lithuania. A smaller number went to Canada, England, South America, and Palestine. During World War I, masses of Jews were exiled ífom Lithuania by order of the Russian high command. Entire Jewish communities were transported to Siberia. After the War, not all returned to Lithuania. Some left for other lands, while others stayed in Russia. Many Soviet Jews who have emigrated from Russia in the last few decades, as well as those still living there, are descendants of those Lithuanian Jews exiled during World War I. I found myself translating more and more from Yehadut Uta for people who said they were seeking information on Lithuanian Jewish communities. Eventually, Stuart and I took up the librarian’s challenge. We put together the kind of volume on Lithuanian Jewish Communities that I had been seeking at the National Library. We hope that others interes- ted in Lithuanian Jewry and family history will find it helpful in locating their families’ towns and in gaining some back- ground. The Association of Lithuanian Jews in Israel, the publisher of Yehadut Uta, was not involved in the translation of that portion of Volume 3 used in the book or in the preparation and publication of this book. The Association is not responsible for the accuracy or inaccuracy of the transla- tion or other materials contained in the book. The first chapter, \" An Historical Perspective, \" presents an overview of the history of Lithuanian Jewry coupled with a history of Lithuania itself, with an emphasis on the early period of Lithuanian history and the origins of Lithuanian Jewry. \"Litvak\" means Lithuanian Jew. However, Jews from PREFACE IX places outside Lithuania may be Litvaks. Chapter I explains why. Chapter II provides articles on individual Lithuanian towns and villages, arranged alphabetically by Yiddish name. The information gives an indication of the circumstances under which the Jewish ínhabitants lived. In many cases, it can help to explain what motivated them to leave. Most of the information in this chapter is based on the Hebrew book Yehadut Lita, Volume III, which emphasizes Lithuanian Jewry between the World Wars. Districts cited along with the towns refer to that period. The Hebrew volumes omit many of the towns detached ífom Lithuania during independence, 1919-1939. As a result, outside sources, as indicated, were utilized for material on several towns in Vilna Region (Gubemia). Some of the details relating to the Holocaust came ffom Volume IV of Yehadut Lita. Hebrew dates that appeared in the original text have been converted to civil calendar dates. However, as the Hebrew calendar year begins with Rosh Hashanah (usually in Septem- ber), the conversion may cause an error of one year if the date fell between September and December. As many readers will use this book for genealogical research, most of the family names mentioned in the articles on towns ífom Yehadut Lita, volume III, have been included. These names make up only a small percentage of the former Jewish population and are not intended to serve as a guide to names of residents. Moreover, family names, as well as place names, found in this book are transliterations from the Hebrew. The transliterated spellings given here may be very different ffom the way they are rendered today in English. For purposes of this book, we have established a stan- dardized list of town names by transliteration. Appendix 1 lists all of the towns included in Chapter II along with their map locations. When the map key is given in parenthesis, it refers to the location of the nearest known town. Town X LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES listings and the accompanying maps relate to present-day or ethnic Lithuania. Appendix I also gives alternate spellings of town names. If the town was once part of Poland, it probably has a Polish name; if Germany, a German spelling, etc. Some of the differences in spelling are due to the differ- ences in letters used in Yiddish, Hebrew, Polish, Lithuanian, German and English. The Lithuanian language, for example, has several letters that do not exist in written English. It is helpful to be aware of them since current maps generally use Lithuanian spellings. Some of the letters are as follows: c = ch, as in \"chow\" e = eh, as in \"effort\" 1 = zh, like the \"s\" in \"measure\" § = sh, like the \"s\" in \"sure\" j = y, as in \"your\"3 For a more in-depth discussion on the Lithuanian lan- guage, see Dr. Antanas Klimas, \"The Letters and Sounds of Lithuanian,\" Lituanus, Volume VI, No. 1, March 1960, Pages 21-24. In Polish, many \"w'”s replace \"v\"’s. In Hebrew the let- ters for \"p\" and \"f\" are the same, as are \"b\" and \"v,\" when pronunciation signs are omitted. Because vowels are omitted in modem printed Hebrew, other letters can also be unclear. These are just a few of the points that can lead to confusion. When reading transliterated names, one must anticipate spell- ing variations particularly when these letters are involved. Appendix 2 is devoted to lists of Lithuanian Jews that have appeared in various disparate sources. Appendix 3 offers additional sources and information that can be particularly useful in researching Lithuanian Jewish genealogy. Resources are rapidly expanding in this field. History, whether of families or otherwise, should not be limited to lists of names and dates. One must strive to create PREFACE xi a living image in the mind by understanding the environment and conditions that existed. It is hoped that the information on the towns of Lithuania will contribute to a feeling of closeness with past generations and a better appreciation of their concerns, their desires, and their fears. We are pieased to be able to make this material available to English speaking audiences. Lithuanian Jewish Communities CHAPTER 1 A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: A HISTORY OF LITHUANIA AND LITHUANIAN JEWRY What is a Lithuanian Jew (or Litvak in Yiddish)? Sources identify a number of mundane characteristics contrasting Litvaks ífom other Ashkenazi Jews including Yiddish dialect differences, culinary tastes, and food prepara- tion. They cite the practice of Litvaks in reciting the Friday Night Kiddish sitting,1 and point to the fact that when a Litvak prays, he stands rock still and only moves his lips. But, these are outward manifestations of a divergence of customs within the larger Ashkenazic Jewish grouping. In a more general sense, Litvaks are characterized as being more rational, dogmatic and authoritarian than other branches of Ashkenazi Jewry. Comprising one quarter of Ashkenazi Jewry, Litvaks could not all come ífom that small speck on a modem map called Lithuania. For a glimpse at the answer to the original question, we must first tum to the history of Lithuania and the ethnic Lithuanians. 4 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES LITHUANIAN HISTORICAL PERIOD The Lithuanian people are part of the Baltic branch of the Indo-European Language Group. They are neither a Slavic nor a Germanic people. Indications exist that they arrived in the Northeastem Baltic area from the Steppes as early as 1500 B.C.E. They remained for many centuries in primitive seclusion largely bypassed by the great Germanic and Slavic migrations. Although briefly mentioned by Tacitus, Ptolemy and Herodo- tus, only in the beginning of the tenth century C.E. do we begin to get a picture of the area and its inhabitants ffom documents written by German merchants. By the thirteenth century their history begins to be chronicled. Lithuania of the twelfth century was a sparsely populated wild area of forests, lakes, and rivers. No cities or towns existed, although small fortifícations were built for defense. Small groupings or tribes in semi-feudal organizations were under local mlers or dukes. Farming was conducted in forest clearings. The tribes were fierce and raided other groups in the area. The people were pagan, believing in demons and monsters and practicing human sacrifíce. The Northeast Baltic area was subject to incursions fforn two directions. From the east, the Westem Rus of Novgorod conducted ffequent campaigns against the Livonians, a people related to the Lithuanians. From the west, the Danes subjuga- ted Estonia and the Swedes conquered the Finns. Merchants, mainly from Germany, were attracted by amber, fur, honey, wax, and leather products available in the area, all valuable in Westem Europe. Also, they were interested in establishing trade routes to and through the interior of Russia. However, they were wary of entering the area without protection against the fierce, primitive, and warlike natives. In addition, the Catholic Church wished to AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 5 convert these pagans to Catholicism before they could be converted to the Eastem Orthodox religion by the Russians. From this commonality of interests, the Order of the Swordbearing Knights (the Livonian Qrder) was formed. In 1 1 8 1 , the Order landed in Latvia and established fortifications and a church on the lower Dvina. They founded the City of Riga in 1201 as a German town and proceeded to convert the Livonians to Christianity . Although successful near the shore, the Order was not able to penetrate into the Lithuanian interior. The German Knights of the Teutonic Order was a more ominous and formidable organization. Established in Palestine by religious fanatics during the Cmsades, it was committed to spreading Christianity to non-believers at the point of the sword. Driven from the holy land, they were later forced to leave Asia Minor, shifting their activities to the Baltic region in order to campaign against the \"Saracens of the North.\" Excluded firom Poland, the Order crossed the Vistula in 1226 and attacked the primitive and disorganized Old Pras- sian people, a group related to the Lithuanians, whom they proceeded to decimate to the point of extinction. The Teuton- ic Order reached the Nieman River and beyond, linking up with the Livonian Knights, which merged with the Teutonic Order in 1237. As a result of the threat from the Teutonic Order, Lithuania united under the leadership of Mindaugus, one of the dukes of a local clan. He accomplished the feat by defeating his rivals and murdering his relatives. The united Lithuanian armies were able not only to stand against the Order but also to expand to the South and East. Under Gediminas (1315-1341), Lithuania expanded into Byelomssia. Vilna was established as the capital. Gediminas’ two sons succeeded him. Algerdas, as Grand Duke, ruled firom Vilna and campaigned against Moscovy and the Tatars. In 1362, he took Kiev. Kestutis ruled firom Troki 6 UTHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES and defended Lithuania against the Teutonic Order which was again on the move; the Order captured Kovno in 1362. In 1377, Algerdas died and was succeeded by his son, Jagella. In 1 386, Jagella married Queen Jadwaga of Poland, was baptized at Cracow and became King of Poland under the name of Wladyslaw. The arrangement included an agreement to unite Poland and Lithuania on the condition that no person be both King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania at the same time. Vytautas, son of Kestutis, became Grand Duke of Lithuania. The agreement, however, was not fully carried out. Although a union between the two countries did not yet occur, a close alliance was established. As a result of the alliance, Lithuania became subject to Polish and therefbre Western influence in culture and religion as opposed to the eastem practices of Russia. Polish society would continue to exert a strong attraction on the more primitive and barbaric Lithuanians. In 1387, Lithuania officially became a Catholic country, converted through the Polish Church. However, the vast majority of the peasant population remained fully pagan until well into the sixteenth century and even later. The threat ffom the Teutonic Order ended when a combined Lithuanian-Polish Army commanded by Vytautas crushed the Order at the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) on July 15, 1410. The Germans, although defeated, remained and undertook colonization and settlement rather than expansion. Their country was named East Prussia after the people the Order had annihilated. The Teutonic Order was officially dissolved in 1525. The reign of Vytautas the Great marks the Golden Age of Lithuania. The border extended to the Black Sea, covering an area of 390,000 square miles and included the Ukraine and Byelorussia. It reached almost to Moscow. This vast area contained a population of only 2 million people; about one-eighth etlinic Lithuanians. The control of the captured AN HISTORJCAL PERSPECTIVE 7 lands was not rigorous. The local peoples maintained their identities, laws and customs. They paid tribute to the Grand Duke. The leadership and control was Lithuanian. At the time, Lithuania was the great military power of Eastem Europe. It was the bastion of defense for Westem Europe against the Tatars of the Golden Horde whom Vytautas the Great stopped in 1399. Vytautas the Great died without heirs in 1430. Jagella’s son, Casimer IV succeeded as Grand Duke. In 1447 he also became King of Poland. The period after Vytautas’s death saw the awakening of Russian power and its expansion toward the West. In 1514, Russia captured Smolensk from Lithuania. This was followed by a truce until 1562 when a new war broke out. In order to maintain itself, Lithuania needed Polish assistance. Poland refused unless Lithuania would agree to fully implement and expand the unity of the two nations as had been agreed upon two centuries earlier. The last of the Jagellan dynasty, Sigmund Augustas, wishing to strengthen the union between the two countries, caused to be passed a number of laws between 1563 and 1566, the most important of which granted to Lithuanian noblemen equal rights with the Polish nobility. Union was fmally effected in 1569 at Lublin. Under the agreement Kiev, Volkynia, and Pordalia were given to Poland and the two countries fused with a joint King and Parliament. A great deal of autonomy was permitted. Lithuania was allowed to maintain its own army, laws and law courts, fiscal organiza- tion and seal. Of significance was the position of the Lithuanian (and Byelomssian) nobility, which long envied and emulated the Polish nobility. Now granted admission and equality, they quickly ceased to be Lithuanian (or Byelomssian) and became part of the Polish nobility, leaving Lithuania without an ethnic leadership until the end of the nineteenth century. 8 LlTHUANlAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES The Union of Lublin ended the Lithuanian historical period. It was no longer independent but a part of Poland. In area it was reduced to 125,000 square miles which remained unchanged until 1772. The area was principally Ethnic Lithuania and ByeIorussia and the population was roughly divided equally between the two. ORIGINS OF LITHUANIAN JEWRY - THE SOUTH No evidence suggests that when Mindaugus united Lithuania in the thirteenth century, any Jews lived or had lived there. Jews came under Lithuanian rule either by immigration or by being resident in areas conquered during the historical period. This latter situation requires a brief review of the lands to the south. Major Jewish communities have existed from ancient times in the Middle East, Asia Minor, and on the north shore of the Black Sea. To the north of this area, the Steppes of the Ukraine and Volga Valley had seen many waves of conquer- ors from the East. One of the most unusual was the Rhazars, a Turkic people of Ugro-Finnic extraction, who appeared in the area in the seventh century C.E. They were fierce fighters and from 730 C.E. stopped tíie advancing hoards of Islam in the Caucasus and prevented their penetration into eastem Europe. The Khazars ruled over a vast territory extending from the Volga River west across the Don, Dnieper and Dniester Rivers, and from the Black Sea far into the forest area to the north. They were the third balancing power in the area between the Caliphate of Baghdad and Byzantium. What makes the Khazars unique was that about 740 C.E. the ruler (Khagan) Bulan and his court converted to Judaism. Littíe direct evidence exists conceming the Khazars. This has led to disparate interpretations conceming their influence on developing Jewish history. For example, Graetz2 charac- AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 9 terizes the Khazar conversion to Judaism as \"an event. . . which only slightly affected the development of Jewish history. \"3 On the other hand the popular writer, Arthur Koestler,4 advances the thesis that the vast bulk of Ashkenazi Jewry is descendent from the Khazars.5 A more reasoned approach is advanced by Baron.6 He points out that although the entire nobility and a substantial portion of the population was Jewish, the majority was a mixture of Christians, Moslems, and pagans. It does appear, though, that for many Jewish Khazars, the conversion was sincere and their commitment to Judaism deep. As Jewish communities suffered from persecution by Christians and Moslems, many very likely immigrated to Khazaria. Records of the time indicate that the practice was not uncommon. How many sought refuge in Khazaria is not known. All we can safely say is that there existed in a country of Jewish dominion a large community of both native converts and immigrant Jews who lived together and co- mingled. The Khazar State was gradually reduced by repeated blows from the Viking-Russian raiders of the Kievian civilization in the latter part of the tenth century . It survived in a reduced condition until overwhelmed in about 1250 C.E. by the great Mongol invasion set in motion by Genghis Khan. Most of the remaining population appears to have been absorbed into the Horde. Professor Baron concludes: But before and after the Mongol upheaval the Khazars sent many offshoots into the unsubdued Slavonic lands, helping ultimately to build up the great Jewish centers of eastem Europe...During the half millennium (740-1250) of its existence, how- ever, and its aftermath in the East European commu- nities, this noteworthy experiment in Jewish state- craft doubtless exerted a greater influence on Jewish history than we are as yet able to envisage.7 10 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES As the conquering Lithuanians moved south through Byelorussia, Volkynia and the Ukraine, they came upon towns with either established Jewish communities or a Jewish presence. These communities were established by a mixture of Jews who came via Khazaria, Khazarian Jews and Jews who came directly firom older Jewish communities. What was the proportion of each or their numbers is not known. The first Jewish settlements in Ethnic Lithuania were established during the historic period. The Jewish settlements were border outposts established for defense against the Teutonic Order. It appears that the Lithuanian rulers brought them in for military reasons as the Jews were known to be fierce fighters. Grand Duke Vytautas brought Turkic speaking Karaites firom the Crimea to garrison the Troki fortress. Troki later became a center of the Karaite community. The Mongol invasion, the rise of Muscovite power and the end of Khazaria mark the end of significant Jewish immigration into eastem Europe (including both Poland and Lithuania) from the south. From the fourteenth century Jewish immigration principally came ffom the west. ORIGINS OF LITHUANIAN JEWRY - THE WEST Although the Jewish immigration firom the south was important, it must be kept in perspective in relation to the immigration of Jews firom the west. It has been estimated that at the end of the fifteenth century, after southem immigration had practically ceased, the combined Jewish population of all of Poland and Lithuania did not exceed 30,000. 8 Most of this Jewish population was centered in westem Poland. It was estimated that at that time, there were fifty Jewish communi- ties in Poland and four in Lithuania. This estimate does not include small settlements or shtetls. From this time, the rate of Jewish immigration ffom the west increased markedly. AN HISTORJCAL PERSPECTIVE 11 The progress of civilization during the Middle Ages in Europe was marked by population movement and develop- ment in a west to east direction. In the early Middle Ages, the firontiers of civilization were in Bohemia, eastem Germa- ny, Selesia, and westem Poland. Towns would be estab- lished, land would be claimed for agriculture, and the population would increase. Jewish communities existed in the firontier of westem Poland since the ninth century. It is not known whether these early immigrants came firom the west or from the south (including Khazaria). These settlers were probably traders participating in the process of opening up the firontier. The development of Poland was severely retarded by the great Tatar invasion of 1240/41 which resulted in the death of half of the population and which utterly devastated the country. To help restore the economy, the kings of Poland encouraged immigration, especially by German merchants. With them came Jews firom German lands who established, re-established, or augmented existing Jewish communities in westem and southwestem Poland. Jewish emigres continued to arrive as a result of persecu- tion in and a series of expulsions firom westem Europe. The numbers increased commencing in 1348 with the German expulsions which were followed by expulsions from Bohemia, Moravia, Hungary, Silesia and, afiter 1526, firom the Czech areas. Jews also came firom Spain and Portugal following the expulsions of 1492-98 and firom Italy afiter the expulsions of 1492, 1511 and 1540, although most refugees firom these Mediterranean Lands found new homes in the Ottoman Empire. By the sixteenth century, the only major havens remaining for Jews were Poland and the Ottoman Empire. Jewish immigrants found westem and southwestem Poland to be a comparatively primitive land (compared to the lands firom which they came) with an even more primitive land, a great underpopulated firontier, to the east. In estab- 12 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES lished communities, the Jews were in economic competition with the descendants of German merchants who were in the process of becoming totally Polanized. This Burgher class became the main opponent of the Jews and a major source of trouble and persecution. In this early period, the economy was young and expanding. Institutions hostile to Jews, such as the church, were not yet entrenched. The position of Jews in Polish society was not seriously challenged. The kings of Poland found the presence of Jews to be profitable both to the country and to the royal treasury. A model charter for the protection of Jews and Jewish rights was first issued by the king in 1264 and later applied to other Polish provinces. It was extended to Lithuania in 1388. Although it is important to differentiate and distinguish the several communities that contributed to the establishment of the new community called Lithuanian Jewry, for an individual it is academic. As each group moved to an area, they were recognized as Jews by other Jews. The Jews originating from these different communities lived together and intermarried. After a number of generations, the designa- tions of origin lost meaning as everyone became identified as a member of the new Jewish community. We can see this process occurring today in an early stage in Israel and in a more advanced stage in the United States. An individual of Litvak origin living today more likely has ancestors firom all of the contributing communities rather than from only one. An exception, of course, is the Karaites, who were pro- nounced heretics and lived separate and apart from the normative Jewish community. AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 13 THE GOLDEN AGE OF POLAND As the older Jewish communities of westem and southem Europe were disintegrating due to expulsions and persecution, Poland, under the Jagellan dynasty (1385 - 1572), was experiencing its golden age. The military and economic power of Poland was paramount in eastem Europe and the country radiated influence in foreign affairs. Members of the Jagellan family reigned over Hungary, Bohemia, Poland and Lithuania, rivaled only by the Hapsburg dynasty with whom they were in close liaison. Economic prosperity resulted from economic expansion within Poland, trade, and the develop- ment of firontier regions, all invigorated and fostered by the policies of the Jagellan rulers. From the inception of the Jagellan Dynasty, the pro- nounced policy of the govemment was to settle the eastem frontier, mainly the comparatively empty but rich Ukraine, but also the forest regions of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Nobles and other favored people were given grants ín these areas. Sometimes, the receiver of such a grant was a favored Jew. These grant holders in tum had to find settlers willing to go to tlie new land to clear the forest, drain the swamps or plow the steppes as may be needed. Many of these settlers were Jews, who welcomed the opportunity to live where anti- Semitic institutions were not yet firmly established and where they were not limited in their occupations nor quartered in ghettos. The Jewish immigrants from Germany, as a result of their numbers, wealth and culture soon submerged the older Jewish communities of Poland. By the end of the fifteenth century any outward characteristics of southeastem European or Asian Jewish communities were no longer visible (with the exception of the Karaites). Yiddish was the language of usage and tíie culture and customs brought from Germany prevailed 14 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES and would continue to prevail both in Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. As new Jewish immigrants arrived from the west and south of Europe, many times they found that they were not wanted in the established Jewish communities of Poland. They would continue their travels to the frontiers to the east, primarily to the Ukraine but also to Lithuania. Immigration by Jews to the eastem ffontier was not limited to the new- comers, though. As the westem sections became more settled, Jews found themselves subject to more and more limitations, including where they could live and which occupations they could pursue. With these restrictions came limitations on how many Jews could be maintained within an established commu- nity. The excess as well as the dissatisfied joined in the trek to the frontiers to the east. When observing Jewish communities in pre-modem times, it is easy to see only the medieval concepts and practices of the surrounding gentiles. This overlooks the medieval concepts prevalent within the Jewish community. The communities were highly stmctured, with the leaders jealous of their positions. Jews írorn elsewhere were consid- ered suspect and were at times refused admittance and were even threatened with excommunication. As the Jewish communities of westem and southem Poland became estab- lished, they also became xenophobic which contributed to the trek of Jews to the eastem firontiers. As Jewish communities expanded and the older areas became settled, the burghers sought to limit the rights of the Jews. From some towns they sought to exclude Jews or to limit them to specified ghettos and suburbs. Mainly, they sought to limit their economic activities and ability to compete in the market place. The Catholic Church, unable to exclude the Jews because their presence was desired by the king, sought instead to impose the restrictions on Jews prevalent throughout the AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 15 Middle Ages and dating back to Roman Times. Their primary attack was to limit the number of Jews, both in individual towns and in the country as a whole. In some of these attempts they failed but at other times they were successful. For example, the burghers and the church were successful in preventing Jewish communities ffom legally being established in Warsaw until the eighteenth century and in Vilna until the middle of the sixteenth century . The Jews could only count on the protection of the king and the nobility, a scant 8% of the population. Even this protection was conditional. The king protected the Jews because they provided money for his treasury . The Jews acted as tax collectors and as managers of his enterprises. In addition, they maintained contacts with Jews of other lands, especially the Ottoman Empire, and thereby facilitated trade. The king would speak of bringing under his protection only those Jews who actually provided income to his treasury. Not all Jews came under the protection of the king. Some Jews were under the protection of an individual noble, one to whom he was useful either as a manager, trader or some other manner by which the Jew added to his material benefit. Some Jews were even under the protection of the church for the same reasons. And, some Jews found no protection. The sixteenth century saw an intellectual upsurge in Poland due to the influence of the Italian Renaissance and the development of the Protestant movement. The effect of these influences was not as great nor as long lasting as occurred in westem Europe. But, this period was the time of Copemicus, Celtes and Janiclri in Poland. Calvinism, ífom Switzerland, was the primary influence in Poland. Lithuania was principal- ly affected by Lutheran teachings emanating ffom the University at Konigsberg in East Prussia. The Protestant movement made deep inroads in both countries. Even King Sigmund Augustus almost converted. 16 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES Since Lithuanian society was more primitive, it did not experience the intellectual and cultural reverberations evi- denced in Poland. The Reformation did have an effect. It presented its teachings to the general population in the native Lithuanian language, a practice later followed by the Catho- lics during the Counter-Reformation. These religious tracts are the oldest extant Lithuanian writing. For the first time, the majority of the population was exposed to Christian concepts. From this period, Lithuania could be counted as a Christian rather than a pagan country, though aspects of paganism remain until the present. The humanistic movement did not build bridges between the Jewish and gentile worlds. The Jews remained a group apart and were neutral in the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants. The primary effect on the Jewish community resulted from the weakening of the Catholic authority which relieved pressure on the community for a time. In 1573, there was even a call in the Polish Diet for complete freedom of religion for all Christians, Jews and Moslems. The relief was only temporary as the Protestant move- ment became increasingly anti-Jewish, the Counter-Reforma- tion took hold, and economic conditions in Poland deteriorat- ed. JEWISH AUTONOMY - THE COUNCILS In 1519, a centralized leadership of the Jewish communi- ties of Poland was established. It grew out of the annual fairs held in Lublin, at which the leading rabbinic authorities met and decided cases. The organization, known as The Council of the Four Lands, acquired the status of a national beit din. The Council was the ultimate authority for Polish Jewry on question of Jewish law and practical questions relating to the welfare of the Jewish community as a whole. In relations AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 17 with the Polish govemment, it spoke in the name of the Jewish community . The Jews of Lithuania did not come under the authority of the Council of the Four Lands. Instead, they established their own Council which was called the Council of the Land of Lithuania. In structure and íunction, the two councils were parallel. The first documents referring to the Lithuanian council date ífom 1533. Two separate councils were established, probably because the secular authorities with whom the councils had to associ- ate were separate and autonomous in internal matters. Another reason could have been the great distances involved and the primitive state of transportation and communications. Clearly, the reason was not a separation or distinction between Polish and Lithuanian Jewry because such a distinc- tion did not then exist. The two Councils acted in coordination and consultation. The Council of the Lands was the sole authority by which the Council of Lithuania could be in contact with the central govemment, whereas the Council of the Lands looked to the Council of Lithuania for fínancial assistance in meeting necessary expenses of operation and defense of the Jewish communities including the cost of bribing appropriate officials. Sometimes the two Councils promulgated different mlings on the same question reflecting the different circum- stances prevailing in Lithuania and Poland. One example was the question of whether Jews should participate in tax farming. The Council of the Lands prohibited the practice as too dangerous while the Council of Lithuania allowed and even encouraged the practice. The Councils also served as administrative bodies for the Polish and Lithuanian govemments in collecting Jewish taxes, especially the capitation or head tax decreed in Poland in 1549 and extended to Lithuania in 1552. The govemments 18 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES would establish the total amount of the tax and the Councils would apportion it within the respective communities which would collect the tax and transfer it to the Councils which, in tum, would pay it over to the govemmental treasinies. The Councils would also negotiate with the govemments on the amount of taxes to be collected. The Councils passed ordinances goveming the lives of the Jewish community. They passed on such matters as economic relations with the non-Jewish community (especial- ly the nobility), credit operations and business ethics, and money lending. They were active in many areas. For exam- ple, they would assist poor girls in finding husbands. They were the final appellate court on religious matters and its mlings were even sought ífom communities outside of Poland-Lithuania. They would promote Jewish education. For example, in 1652 the Council of Lithuania decreed that all congregations with a rabbi must also maintain a yeshiva for adults and youth. They acted as self-defense organizations against threats ífom the outside and provided funds for Jewish defense against accusations such as blood libels. The Councils were far from democratic. They were constituted only from the principal communities. Elections to Council positions were held within these communities by the leadership of the communities and not by the common people. Moreover, the Council generally sided with the leadership of individual communities against the common man. It has been estimated that the leadership of the Council of Lithuania was elected by 0.7% of the Jewish households of Lithuania. The autocratic character was more pronounced with the Council of the Land of Lithuania than it was with the Council of the Four Lands. Originally, three communities constituted the Council of the Land of Lithuania, namely: Brest-Litovsk, Grodno and Pinsk. It is interesting to note that none of these communities were in ethnic Lithuania. Although smaller AN HISTORJCAL PERSPECTIVE 19 communitíes were occasionally represented in the business of the Council, these three communitíes jealously protected their prerogatíves. For a long tíme, the head of the beit din of Brest-Litovsk assumed leadership within the Council. This state of affairs led to much dissension as other communitíes demanded recognitíon and partícipatíon in the leadership of the natíonal Jewish Community. Different communitíes and individuals would at tímes tum to the civil, non-Jewish authoritíes for relief against the Council. After strenuous efforts, Vilna and Slutsk were added to the small list of leading communities. Because of the intemal dissension and a new method of tax collectíon established by the Polish authorities, both Councils were officially disbanded in 1764. They left in their wake huge debts and much bittemess, but also pride in these unique autonomous organizatíons. JEWS OF POLAND - CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT The Polish (and the developing Lithuanian) Jewish communitíes did not live in isolation. Contacts existed with other Jewish communitíes both commercially and culturally. The works of the great centers of Jewish leaming of westem Europe and Africa were known and studied in Poland. Jewish centers of study were established and grew. Beginning in the sixteenth century, the center of Talmud- ic exegesis passed from westem Europe to Poland.9 Among the great commentators contributing original methodology and approach to the Talmud were R. Meir of Lublin (1558-1616), R. Solomon Luria (Maharshal) (1510-1573), and R. Samueí Eliezer Edels (Maharsha) (1555-1631). Included in Talmudic exegesis was the study of Kabba- lah10. The Kabbalah, although a part of normative Judaism, was a subject generally leamed by only a select few along 20 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES with law and rational philosophy. The traditional Kabbalah contained elements of messianism and apocalypse-utopian eschatology. But, these elements were submerged in favor of a speculative approach in understanding the mystical cosmolo- gy- With the expulsion of the Jews firom Spain in 1492, the Mediterranean Jewish communities witnessed a new emphasis in messianic Kabbalah and a heightened popular interest in mysticism. Scholarly work on Kabbalah, centered in Safed, emphasized the redemption of the universe and the unification of the emanations of God with the redemption of Israel and its retum to the land. Although the fame of these teachings of R. Isaac Luria (not to be confused with R. Solomon Luria) and his disciples spread to Poland, the actual texts\" were withheld as being too holy for the diaspora. Some of the teachings, however, reached Italy and later Poland. Kabbalistic study became rife throughout Poland. Local writings came out under the names of the rabbis of Safed. Ancient texts, once held secret, were published. Mysticism, once the realra of the chosen few, became the domain of the many. The metaphorical redemption of Israel symbolizing the redemption of the universe was conceptually transformed to an actual redemption and return to the land severed ffom its cosmological parameters. Practical Kabbalah, that is, magic and incantations, came to the fore replacing traditional speculative study. As Kabbalah spread throughout Poland, the time for the arrival of the Messiah was thought near. From the ancient texts, the year 1648 was deemed the year of redemption. Instead it was the beginning of catastrophe. AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 21 TIMES OF TROUBLE The struggle between a centralizing kingship and a decentralizing nobility usually resulted in greater centraliza- tion, as occurred in westem Europe. However, in Poland the opposite transpired. During the Jagellan Dynasty the nobility and its center of authority, the Diet, were able to extend its hold on Poland. The death of Sigmund II in 1 572 ended both the Jagellan Dynasty and hereditary kingship in Poland. Thereafter, the kings of Poland were elected by the Polish Diet lfom among foreigners. Since the election required the unanimous approv- al of the entire Diet, elections were ffaught with maneuvering and machinations. It sometimes took years to settle on a consensus candidate. Aíter a brief fíve month reign by Henry of France, the Diet eleeted Steven Bathory ffom Transylvania who reigned from 1576 to 1586. Some historians cite the end of the Golden age of Poland with the death of Sigmund while others extend the era to the death of Steven Bathory who was an enlightened and strong leader. In any event, a series of weak rulers followed resulting in stagnation and economic decline. The decay in power and vitality became evident with the outbreak of the Chmielnicki Cossack uprising of 1648-52. This uprising also had dire effects on the Jewish communi- ties, constituting the greatest calamity for eastem European Jewry with the exception only of the Holocaust. The Cossacks, temporarily allied with the Crimean Tatars, burst out of the Ukraine. One of their main targets were Jews, who, as resident managers, represented to the Cossacks the hated Poland and all that was Polish. The Cossacks were intent not in just killing and indiscriminately looting, but in genocide. Jews that could not flee sought to surrender to the Tatars who would only enslave them, possibly selling them into the Ottoman Empire where they 22 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES could be redeemed by other Jews. The Cossack armies soon decimated the Ukraine, Galicia and southem Poland. Their depredations reached almost to Warsaw before being finally put down. It has been estimated that over 100,000 Jews died during the Chmielnicki massacres. There are two important observations conceming the effects of the Chmielnicld massacres on the Jewish communi- ties of eastem Europe. First, the Cossacks not only lrilled the Jews but destroyed the institutions of Jewish life. They destroyed the yeshivas and schools and Irilled the scholars and the teachers. For those Jews that survived, retumed or came later, organized Jewish life had to almost begin anew. The second point is that the Chmielniclri massacres largely bypassed Lithuania. Although Lithuania was spared from the Chmielniclri uprising, it was ravished by the northem wars between Russia and Sweden. The Jewish population of Lithuania was reduced to poverty and suffering. The wars continued until 1661 when Sweden and Russia agreed to relinquish their Polish gains. As much as the Lithuanian Jews suffered, they were not subject- ed to the genocide that occurred in the south. In fact, Lithuania became a haven for Jews fleeing the Cossacks. The Chmielniclri uprising slowed but did not stop the flow of people to the eastem firontier. With the retum of peace, the movement to the Ukraine and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania resumed at an increased rate. While Poland had become the center of European Jewry, Lithuanian Jewry remained on the outer firinges until well into the sixteenth century. Lithuania was still largely unsettled and primitive. It has been estimated that in 1578 there were 27,000 Jews in Lithuania and in 1676 there were 32,000 Jews. This latter estimate is probably low. Up to the seven- teenth century, the religious leaders of Lithuania were all Polish trained. Lithuanian Jewry could be viewed at this an historical perspective 23 period as an appendage of Polish Jewry.12 This was soon to change. SHABBATAI ZVI The survivors of the cataclysmic events in eastem Europe, full of despair and praying for redemption, eagerly awaited the expected arrival of the savior. Poland, even before the massacres, had been vibrating with the expectation of the near coming of the messiah. The events since 1648 would seem to be the prophetic apocalyptical summoning of the end of days. The great wonder was that the messiah figure did not arise in Poland but rather in the Ottoman Empire.1J Although Shabbatai Zvi had early visions of messiahship, the movement around him began in 1665 in Palestine. The year 1666 was declared the year of redemption. All of the signs appeared to signify that Shabbatai Zvi was the trae messiah of David who would lead his people back to the land. These signs were heavily weighted by the writings and propaganda of his followers. In Poland, as among all of Jewry, the people were ecstatic with the belief that not only was redemption near, but also revenge. Street marches took place and riots against gentiles occurred. Business was ignored as all classes of people joined in the euphoria. Religious leaders pondered what acts were necessary to hasten redemption. Opponents and doubters of Shabbatai Zvi were silenced. Lithuanian Jewry shared in this mad expectation of the coming redemp- tion. According to the Zohar (an ancient book central to Kabbalah), when the Messiah comes, he will reorder the rales by which Jews live. These rales had been promulgated and enforced by the rabbinate. A messianic movement could be 24 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES looked upon as an attempt to undermine the authority of the rabbis. It has been suggested that this was the agenda of some of the followers of Shabbatai Zvi. The euphoria of the Jewish people was shattered when Shabbatai Zvi converted to Islam in September, 1666. Although some continued to believe in him, the vast body of Jews went into deep despondency. Some, disillusioned with Judaism, converted to Islam or Christianity. Following the apostasy of Shabbatai Zvi, opponents of this messianic movement could again be heard. Rabbis tried to reestablish their authority. In Poland, too few leaders had survived the Chmielnicki massacres. The effort to reassert traditional authority only sapped what strength was left. The story in Lithuania, where the rabbis were more easily able to reestablish control, was different . The Council of the Land of Lithuania, meeting at Chomsk in 1667, enacted an ordinance forbidding any variation or alteration in the liturgy. Rabbis issued decrees forbidding a man to study Kabbalah until he reached the age of forty. Between the reaction to the apostasy of Shabbatai Zvi and the coming onslaught of the Hasidic movement, Lithuani- an Jewry became conservative and protective of tradition. Kabbalah and mysticism were de-emphasized, whereas rational study was accentuated. Innovation and change was ffowned upon. NEW JEWISH MOVEMENTS - HASIDISM The destruction of Jewish institutions caused by the Chmielniclri massacres, the increase in church persecutions occasioned by the success of the Counter-Reformation in Poland, the intemal divisiveness of the Jewish community caused by oligarchic rule, and the disillusionment engendered by the false messianic movement of Shabbatai Zvi, estab- AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 25 lished fertile ground for the rise of Hasidism. Founded by Israel Baal Shem Tov (1699 - 1761), tíie Hasidic movement originated in Volhynia and Podolia and quickly spread to the Ukraine, Galicia and other parts of Poland. The teachings emphasized that all were equal before God, the ignorant as well as the leamed. Purity of heart was considered superior to study. The leader or tzaddik (or admor) must always be followed. For many, the tzaddik was an intermediary with God. Many Hasidic tales grew up conceming the tzaddikim and their magical and mystical powers. The Hasidic movement swept unopposed through all of eastem European Jewry until it came to Lithuania. There, the established rabbinic leadership pronounced anathema on such concepts as elevating ignorance and putting emotionalism ahead of rational study . The only Hasidic movement that was able to establish itself in Lithuania was that of the Habad or Lubavitch in Lyady, Byelomssia. THE VILNA GAON The dynamic leadership of Lithuanian Jewry by the end of the eighteenth century centered around Elijah ben Solomon Zalman, the Vilna Gaon. He represented a synthesis between total immersion in Talmudic teachings, the inclusion of mysticism, and the infusion of secular enlightenment. The new school of the Vilna Gaon was postulated as a conservative reaction to Hasidim, a hardening of the line, and a reaction. At the same time, it was not just old doctrines with new wrappings but a natural continuation and advance- ment distinct from Hasidim which was looked upon as a departure. This new school emphasized individual study and hard work as the prerequisite to the attainment of spiritual 26 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES advancement. Everyone was encouraged to study, even those of lesser ability. The teachings of the Vilna Gaon led to the establishment of a new type of yeshiva for the total study of Torah and the pursuit of leaming as a self-contained goal. The first such institution opened in Volozhin in 1802 and was headed by Rabbi Hayyim, who established a fimd collected in all Lithuania to support the yeshiva. On this model, yeshivas sprang up throughout Lithuania. One of the great achievements of the Vilna Gaon was a new compilation of the Talmud and commentaries, the form that is in use today. The followers of the Vilna Gaon were called Mitnagdim (later called the Orthodox) meaning the opposers; that is the opposers of the new emotional, anti-rational Hasidim. In 1784, the Vilna Gaon ruled that the Hasidim were heretical and prohibited ritual slaughter performed by them and marriage with them. The animosity and hatred that existed between the Mitnagdim and the Hasidim was intense. At times, each would go to the gentile authorities with accusa- tions against the other. When the Vilna Gaon died, the small Hasidic community in Vilna held an open celebration which led to violence. It was during this period of intense conflict between the Mitnagdim and the Hasidim that the term \"Litvak” came into common usage to differentiate the Lithuanian Jews from the remaining, predominantly Hasidic Jewish world of eastem Europe. The antipathy lessened in the nineteenth century as the Hasidic movement began to establish yeshivas of their own and began to stress Torah education. an historical perspe CTIVE 27 THE PARTITIONS OF POLAND As discussed above, the end of the Jagellan Dynasty marked the beginning of a períod when the kings of Poland were elected by the Diet from candidates outside the country. Since unanimity was necessary, the final selection was so fully compromised as to leave the king without power. Poland lacked centralized leadership. Poland declined until it remained but an empty shell of a nation. At the end of the eighteenth century, the three surrounding powers acted. Poland was systematically parti- tioned between Russia, Prussia and Austria in three steps. The First Partition, in 1772, gave Byelorussia to Russia. The Third Partition, in 1795, gave Lithuania to Russia. Poland ceased to exist as an independent nation. On December 23, 1791, Empress Catherine of Russia issued a decree restricting Jewish habitation to specific areas. This decree applied to White Russia (Byelorussia), the Ukraine and other areas taken in the partition. After the Third Partition, the decree was extended to include the newly acquired territories along the Baltic Sea. Thus was born the Pale of Settlement, the area where Jews were allowed to live; an area that stretched from the Baltic to the Black Seas. Of the areas then inhabited by Lithuanian Jewry, ethnic Lithuania and Byelorussia became an integral part of Russia and the southem part, around Grodno and Suwalk, became part of the Duchy of Warsaw (Poland). Although Lithuania may have been divided, the Jewish Litvak community remained integrated until World War I. It has been estimated that, at the time of partition, 25 percent of all the Jews of eastem Europe were Litvak. 28 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES UNDER RUSSIAN RULE Russia, a country that had always excluded Jews, suddenly found itself sovereign over the largest concentration of Jews in the world. In addition to the innate hostility toward Jews held by most Russians, especially the nobiíity, the problem was compounded by the fact that Jews and the Jewish communal structure did not fit the feudal structure of Russian society. The Kahal (local Jewish communal organization) was especially anathema as it challenged the total authority demanded by a centralized and autocratic regime. A motif that would reoccur was the attempts of the Russian govem- ment to break the strength, standing, and control of the local Kahals over the Jewish population. The partitioning of Poland also occurred at a time when concepts of the enlightenment were beginning to be felt in Russia. Led initially by Catherine, who was of German birth, the court tended to take a liberal view toward govem- ment and to the Jewish questions in particular. Numerous plans were put forward to \"help\" the Jews and to solve the \"Jewish problem.\" Most involved altering the economic base because it was felt that Jews did not engage in sufficient physical labor for their livelihood. Another goal, in keeping with the enlightenment, was to educate the Jews and integrate them into society as part of the peasant, artisan or merchant classes. Some of the proponents of these schemes were well meaning but many harbored a loathing for Jews and reflected their prejudices in the programs. Although there was ambivalence in the govemmental attitude toward Jews during the early period of Russian mle, the overall signs were positive. It was felt that the court of the Czar had manifested good intentions. When Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, the Jewish community largely supported Russia. Although it was known AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTTVE 29 that Napoleon had emancipated the Jews of westem Europe and material benefits would accrue as a result of a French victory, it was felt by Jewish leaders that the Jews would lose their connection with God if they supported the French. After the Congress of Vienna, the reaction that set in all over Europe also evidenced itself in Russia. Many Jews who had loyally supported the Czar were soon disabused. The court was no longer favorable to Jews. The period between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and World War I, roughly called the Nineteenth Century, was a profound period for the Jews of Russia as well as a time of dramatic changes within Russia. This period is one of the best documented in Jewish history, as opposed to the scant material extant for prior periods. Although well known as a period of persecution, official- ly sanctioned pogroms and poverty, the Nineteenth Century was also a period of great change and development within the Jewish Community. One important manifestation was the phenomenal Jewish birth rate coupled with a relatively low infant mortality rate, which resulted in a large natural increase in the Jewish population. It has been estimated that in 1820 there were 1.6 million Jews in Russia (including Poland). In 1851, the number had increased to 2.4 million and, by 1880, it had reached 4 million. During this 60-year period, the Jewish population increased by 150 percent, whereas the general population increased only 87 percent.14 The main reason that this large natural increase could be maintained was that the Pale was at peace; Russia’s wars were fought elsewhere. No marauding armies traversed the Pale of Settlement. Such events as the forced conscription of Jewish boys into the army through kidnapping (by \"khoppers\"), which resulted in most of them being lost to the community by death or conversion, and the numerous pogroms resulting in 30 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES death, injury, and destruction were certainly traumatic to the Jews and remembered with horror. However, from a demographic point of view, they were insignificant. The Nineteenth Century witnessed an extensive shift in the economic base of the Jewish communities caused partially by official policy, but also by the changes occurring within Russian society. This period saw the beginning of the industrial revolution in Russia as well as all Europe. Although some Jews had lived in the urban areas and had been involved in commerce, both domestic and intemational, most Jews lived in small, rural, close-lcnit shtetls. Few were active in agriculture although most rural Jews had gardens. Most acted as middlemen between the peasants and the merchants of the towns, dealing in crops and exchanging them for merchandise. In the Pale, Jews exclusively distilled liquor, ran tavems and inns. Clothing manufacture and tailoring was also exclusively in Jewish hands, an industry originally developed to meet the needs of Jews for special religious clothing. Jews were also cobblers, carpenters, barbers, fisherman and transporters or porters, to name a few of the traditional trades. The Czarist regime sought to end the middleman status of the Jews for several reasons. First, it was then thought that this was not productive and the Jews should become farmers or merchants for their own good. Secondly, the autocratic regime did not wish direct contact with peasants, especially by Jews, who might upset the established order. One target was Jewish involvement with spirituous liquor. It was felt, wrongly, that Jews were getting the peasants dmnk. This policy of expelling Jews from their traditional shtetls was periodically enforced and rescinded. Some, however, were dispossessed and forced into urban ghettos under poverty conditions. Even in the areas in which Jews long held monopolies, they began to find themselves in heavy competition from non- AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTTVE 31 Jews. This was accelerated after the edict of 1861 which freed the serfs. The former peasants took on trades and crafts including those formerly performed only by Jews. Within the Pale, the population was increasing so fast that Jewish competition among themselves was intense, resulting in less compensation and shoddier work. With the support of the govemment, Russia was industri- alizing. Many of the enterprises were owned and organized by Jews. However, the number of Jewish capitalists was small compared to the great mass of Jews. As conditions became poorer in the shtetls, Jews would migrate to the urban areas seeking jobs in the industrial enterprises. Some of the traditional activities simply no longer existed. For example, the transport business rapidly declined with the advent of railroads. The process of urbanization of the Jewish masses due to competition, population increases, and official govemment policy, accelerated. The urbanization of the Jewish population was intense. In 1897, Jews accounted for 52 percent of the urban population of Lithuania and Byelorussia, followed by Russians with 18.2 percent, Poles with 12.8 percent, White Russians with 11.8 percent, and Lithuanians with 1.7 percent. 15 Many westem Jews, in searching their family roots, may well find that their ancestors lived in a shtetl and briefly moved to an urban area before they emigrated to America or another country. Job creation by new enterprises was insufficient to keep up with the rapidly increasing Jewish population. Poverty continued to increase during this period and the urban areas became holes of depredation. Within the Pale of Settlement, the farther north one went, the poorer was the area. The poorest portion of the PaSe of Settlement was Lithuania. As economic conditions deteriorated, Litvaks moved to better areas seelring to better 32 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES their conditíons. Some settled in Latvia. Others went to the Ukraine, northeast Poland, or other parts of the Pale. As the century progressed, tíie official policy of the govemment was to assimilate and convert the Jews. One of the methods used was the inclusion of Jews within the Russian school system. At first, Jews hailed this as a grant of freedom and a ray of hope. It did aid in opening the hori- zons of young Jews beyond the fence of traditíonal religion. Some did assimilate but others sought secularized activities within a Jewish context. The irony for the govemment was that this attempt at assimilatíon only led to the inclusion of many Jewish youth in the revolutíonary movements endemic in the century. The pressure of repression and economic depravatíon became sufficiently great that a westward emigratíon began in the 1840 to Germany and Austria. With the assassinatíon of Czar Alexander II in March, 1881, all pretense of liberal- ism ended and the repression of the Jews intensified, only to be ratcheted up again with the ascension of Czar Nicholas II in 1897. Vast Jewish emigratíon to the West sharply in- creased in the 1880’s. Between 1880 and 1914, over 2 million Jews had emigrated. However, even this vast exodus did not equal the natural increase during the same period. The Jewish populatíon continued to increase. The emigratíon was heaviest from Lithuania. Whereas Litvalcs had constítuted 25 percent of the Jewish population at the beginning of the century, due to migratíons and emigratíon, they only constítuted 20 percent of the Jewish populatíon at the end of the period. Although most left for the United States, some settled in Palestíne, South Africa, South America, Canada, Britain and other places into which they could find entry. an historical perspective 33 NEW JEWISH MOVEMENTS - ENLIGHTENMENT The traditíonal manner of meetíng the challenge of a hostíle gentile world was for the Jewish communitíes to turn in unto themselves. They would be part of the economic world of the surrounding community, but would be immersed in their studies and be closer to God. This practíce was challenged by the Haskalah, the enlightenment, which came into Lithuania firom the west. The movement had its roots in Italy and Holland but first took hold as a movement in Germany in the eighteenth century. It was based upon the belief that Jewish emancipa- tion could only be achieved by modernizing and westemizing Jewish religion and customs. It also advocated the literary use of the Hebrew language. While the Vilna Gaon and his circle cultivated Jewish partícipatíon in westem culture and the study of science as an aid in more fully understanding holy text, the Haskalah movement elevated such actívity to the main goal. They looked upon themselves as a mediator between the old rigid Orthodoxy and the radical assimilation- ists. Moving through East Pmssia, the movement took hold in Lithuania, especially in Vilna and Minsk. It also took on a different character in Lithuania from that in westem Europe, Poland and southem Russia. Rather than manifestations of national disavowal and assimilatíon, it centered around the people and the language. It developed Hebrew poets, novel- ists and scholars. Lithuanian Jewry, with its tradition of reason and study was fertíle ground for the enlightenment. The Haslcalah movement was vehemently opposed by the Mitnagdim as a further intmsion into the traditions of the Jewish people. In this oppositíon, the Mitnagdim were joined by the Hasidim. As Haskalah ran its course in the 1880’s, it paved the way for two other movements, Zionism and Socialism. 34 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES With the first emigration of disciples of the Vilna Gaon and of Hasidim at the end of the eighteenth century to Palestine, strong ties to the land of Israel were established. Leading Litvak Zionists were already preaching Jewish nationalism and settlement of the land of Israel in the 1870’s. In 1902, the second convention of Russian Zionists was held in Minsk, the only open convention held during Czarist times. Until 1912, the center of Russian Jewish Zionism was in Vilna. The second movement was the Jewish Socialist move- ment which was founded in Lithuania. It arose fforn the plight of the many thousands of Jewish proletariat and rapidly developed into a revolutionary socialist movement. In order to mobilize the Jewish workers, the Bund was organized. The Bund not only played a major role in overthrowing the hated Czarist regime but also in destroying traditional Judaism and in opposing Hebrew culture and Zionism. RISE OF LITHUANIAN N ATION ALISM With the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, the former territories of historic Lithuania were divided by the Russians into provinces or gubernias named Vilna, Kovno, Grodno, Minsk, Mohilev and Vitebsk. Vilna and Kovno gubemias covered ethnic Lithuania and became known after 1832 as the \"Territory of the Northwest. \" The provinces were ruled by an appointed Russian govemor seated in Vilna. Until the 1880’s, the stmcture of Lithuanian society under Russian mle consisted of an ethnic Lithuanian peasant- ry and a Polish gentry. This gentry may have been largely of Lithuanian origin but had long since become completely Polanized. They were regarded as Polish by both the Lithua- nian peasants and by the Russians. AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 35 Lithuanian society continued to be stagnant, influenced by and reacting to activities arising elsewhere. In 1830-31 and 1863, uprisings against Russian rule originated in Poland from where it spread to Lithuania. Jews participated in both of these uprisings. In 1861, serfdom was abolished in all of Russia. For the first time, the Lithuanian peasants were freed ffom the land and could develop. By the 1880’s, a new Lithuanian intelli- gentsia of peasant origin began to emerge and with it a perception of Lithuanian nationalism. Lithuanians utilized the historic period as a base. This period of great military expansion was idealized and Vytautas was deified. The union with Poland was regarded as the great betrayal of Lithuania. Poland was regarded with hostility. Pagan origins were looked on with pride and eontemporary manifestations of paganism were commented upon with enthusiasm. Links were emphasized with the Indo-European race and the close relationship with Greece was established on linguistic grounds.16 These factors were utilized to bridge 400 years of societal non-existence, allowing Lithuanian intellectuals to talk of 700 years of Lithuanian history. This searcb for national identity led to calls for territorial autono- my and finally independence. LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE World War I provided the opportunity sought by Lithua- nian nationalists for independence. During the War, Germany occupied most of Lithuania, taking Vilna on September 18, 1915. Under German auspices, a 20-man Council of Lithuania (Taryba) was established in September, 1917. On February 16, 1918, the Taryba proclaimed an independent state which 36 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES was immediately recognized by Germany . A govemment was formed on November 11, 1918. On January 5, 1919, the Germans evacuated Vilna which was immediately occupied by the Red Army, installing a communist govemment. The Lithuanian govemment first fled to Kovno but again had to flee when the Red Army occupied that town on January 17th. The army of newly emergent Poland took Vilna ffom the Red Army on April 20, 1919, which enabled the Lithuanian army to recapture Kovno soon after. The major point of contention between the new govem- ments of Poland and Lithuania was Vilna. Although ethnic Lithuanians constituted a minority of the population, they based their claims upon the large Jewish population living in Vilna. However, Poland also claimed Vilna and had posses- sion of the city by military conquest. Poland offered two altematives, either (1) an independent Lithuanian state based upon ethnic boundaries without Vilna, or (2) an expanded state including Vilna but federated with Poland. Lithuania rejected both altematives. An inter-allied commission was established under Marshal Foch to fix a demarcation line. His line gave Vilna to Poland. On March 15, 1923, the Confer- ence of Ambassadors accepted the Foch Line. Lithuania rejected the decision. The border remained closed with Poland until March 17, 1938, when Poland demanded and received recognition of Polish sovereignty over Vilna. The borders with Latvia and Estonia also remained closed. During this period of indepen- dence, Lithuania remained isolated from its surrounding neighbors, maintaining normal and close relations only with Germany. On September 22, 1921, Lithuania was accepted as a member of the League of Nations. On August 1, 1922, a constitution was adopted providing for an 80 member assembly (Seimas) elected by proportional representation AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTTVE 37 (vote by party, each party receiving a number of seats in proportion to its size of the vote). Elections in November, 1922 failed to produce a majority. New elections in June, 1923 established a right-center majority. Elections in May, 1926 gave a majority to the left wing which was followed in December by an army coup d’etat which instituted an extreme nationalist government and totalitarian rule. The constitution was soon abolished and with it many democratic provisions and rights. The program of the nationalists was based upon xeno- phobic nationalism and the church. Education was controlled to further these ideals. One of the objects of derision were the Jews who were considered foreigners. Lithuanian newspapers in the ’30’s were so anti-Semitic, they easily rivaled Nazi publications in vitriolicity. The secret German-Russian Treaty of August 23, 1939 allowed Germany to invade Poland on September 1, 1939, initiating World War II. In the treaty, it was agreed that Lithuania would go to Germany which anticipated that Lithuania would be an ally and join in the invasion of Poland. When Lithuania refused and declared itself neutral, the Treaty was revised and placed Lithuania within the Russian sphere of influence. On October 10, 1939, Lithuania was forced to sign a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union which provided for the stationing of Soviet troops on Lithuanian soil. The Soviet Union severed Vilna from Poland and gave it to Lithuania. With the establishment of a puppet communist government, Independent Lithuania ceased to exist. 38 UTHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES THE JEWS DURING WORLD WAR I AND INDEPENDENT LITHUANIA The Jews, having suffered under the Czarist persecutions, sided with Germany in World War I. With the front lines in Lithuania, the Russians in 1915 expelled the Jews ffom the provinces of Suwalki, Kovno, Courland and Grodno into the interior of Russia. As the German armies advanced, whole towns were destroyed. Many Jews came under German occupation before they could be expelled. Others moved to different locations. Many but not all Jews were expelled. The times were devastating for an already poverty stricken region. During this period, the last great rabbinic work emanat- ing from the Litvak community was completed. Rabbi Yisroel Meir Kagan-Hacohen, known as the Chafetz Chayim, published the Mishnah Brurah17 which is now the normative standard of Orthodox Jewry. With the Russian revolution and the end of World War I, the Jews of Byelorussia found themselves behind the border of Soviet Russia, cut off ffom the remaining Litvak Jewish communities. Their development thereafter is part of the history of Soviet Jewry. The new borders also cut off the Litvak Jews living in Poland. For the first time, Litvaks were divided and following different paths of development. Following the War, many Jews retumed ffom inner Russia to ethnic Lithuania. But many did not, forming a segment of the present community of Soviet Jews. The Jews that did retum, had to rebuild both buildings and institutions. A number of shtetls inhabited by Jews before the war were not resettled. The Jews supported Lithuanian aspirations for indepen- dence. In 1919, the Lithuanian delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference sent a letter guaranteeing the Jews of Lithuania the \"right of national-cultural autonomy . \" This was followed by laws allowing Jewish autonomy and a constitu- AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 39 tional provision protecting the rights of large minorities. Jewish communal institutions were established and national conferences were held. The period 1919 to 1922 was the golden age for modem Jewish autonomy. Thereafter, it decayed due to pressure firom reactionary clerical groups and because the Jews were no longer needed to further Lithuanian nationalism. In the economic sphere, Lithuanian cooperatives were formed under govemmental auspices which had the effect of cutting the Jews out of their traditional middleman merchan- dizing positions. Many Jews eamed their livelihood in crafts, some in the professions and a number in the import-export trade. As time passed, the numbers in each declined with the places taken by Lithuanians. The slogan was Lithuania for the Lithuanians. Coupled with the cutoff frorn traditional markets by the new borders, the Jews lived in poverty. Many Jews emigrated to Poland, the Ukraine and abroad. With the restrictions on immigration by the United States, the Jews leaving eastem Europe largely went to South Africa and South America. Many Jews were maintained in Lithuania by individual and institutional charities ffom abroad. The census of 1923 showed 153,743 Jews in ethnic Lithuania. In 1935 about 93,000 Jews lived in Latvia, mostly of Litvak origin. There were approximately 400,000 Jews in Byelorussia and another 400,000 Jews lived in portions of Poland. The proportion of Litvak Jews compared to all eastem European Jewry had declined from 25% to 20% . The birthrate of Lithuanian Jews, as well as Polish Jews, was one of the highest in the world. The decline represents a greater emigration firom Lithuania than from any other Jewish region, mainly due to economic factors. The census of 1937 showed that the number of Jews in ethnic Lithuania had increased to only 157,527 again showing continuing emigration. 40 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES WORLD WAR II AND THE HOLOCAUST After the German invasion of Poland on September 1 , 1939, some Jews were able to flee the Nazis. Lithuanian Jews received refiigees and these poor communities helped the best they could. Although the handwriting was on the wall, few tried or were able to leave Lithuania during the \"phony war’ period. On June 22, 1941, the Nazis attacked the Soviet Union. On the Lithuanian front, Battle Group North smashed through Lithuania, the blitzkrieg achieving complete occupation within days. The Jews farther to the east, including Byelorus- sia, had more time and some were able to escape into the interior of Russia. Freed from any constraints, the Lithuanians tumed on the Jews and began to slaughter them. As the Nazi occupation took control, the slaughter continued, but in an organized manner. Enthusiastically help by their Lithuanian assistants, the Germans would transfer Jews firom the small shtetls to larger towns where ghettos were set up. Out of these ghettos, the Jews would be killed. By the end of 1941, the job in Lithuania had been substantially completed. The Jewish community had been wiped out. Afiter the War, 18,000 Jews remained in Lithuania centered in the cities of Vilna and Kovno. This community and the other Litvak communities in Latvia and Byelorussia were able to establish the modem Soviet Jewry movement. The first activities centered in Riga. Since that time, most Lithuanian Jews have emigrated to Israel leaving only a handful behind, not sufficient to maintain a viable Jewish community. AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 41 CONCLUSION Lithuania is now a part of the Soviet Union as an \"autonomous republic.\" At times in the past 50 years, rumblings of nationalism were heard. Russification policies, however, prevailed and ethnic Lithuanians were decreasing in number. In 1989, Lithuania again declared itself independent. How these events will play out cannot be foretold. We retum to the original question: What makes Litvaks different? As can be seen, the answer is many things and many events. One contributing factor was that Lithuania was, during the period of the development of the Jewish communities, a poor and backward country of peasants. The union with Poland robbed the country of its upper classes that could have provided cultural development. The Jews felt superior to the ethnic peasant population and made no attempt to emulate them. Therefore, the development of Litvak communities were more inward and Jewish and less tempted by outside forces. The great Litvak community of eastem Europe ended. It had been the bastion of the three disparate movements so important in modem Jewish history: Orthodox Jewry, Political Zionism and Socialism. The few survivors moved on, ending the 700 years of physical contact with Lithuania. 42 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES NOTES 1.

Graetz, History oftheJews, volume III (Philadel- phia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1894). 3. Ibid., 138. 4. Arthur Koestler, The Thirteenth Tribe (New York: Random House, 1976). 5. These positions resulted in the Khazar period being controversial. Adding to the controversy, the Palestin- ian Arab movement latched on to the theory of Jewish descent from the Khazars to argue a negation of Jewish rights to Israel. They claim that modern Jews lack an historical connection with the land, being solely of Turkic origin. These extreme positions should be rejected. Too many established facts and rational historical evaluations must be ignored to sustain them. Some of the arguments against these positions are as follows: To sustain Graetz’s position, one must con- clude that a major power, ruled by Jews, existed for half a millennium neighboring older centers of Jewish population where the Jews were being persecuted and these Jews failed to migrate to this haven in substan- tial numbers and establish viable communities. Such a conclusion is further negated by: (a) other examples from diaspora history where Jews moved to places of relative safety: for example, Poland, the Ottoman Empire and the United States; and (b) the existence of AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE 43 enough Jews in Rhazaría to effect the conversion of the nobility and a portion of the population. To sustain Koestler’s theory of the \"descent from the Khazars, \" one must conclude that traditional Jewish communities, existing from time immemorial under adverse conditions could convert a portion of a super power of the time and suddenly lose its vitality and disappear. Koestler’s theory appears to be based upon two observations: (a) the 20th Century disparity in num- bers between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish commu- nities; and (b) racial differences between separate Jewish communities. The disparity in numbers between Ashkenazi and Sephardi communities only began to manifest itself at the end of the 17th Century, while the Khazar Empire ceased to exist at the end of the 13th Centuiy. Where was this large block of Khazar Jews during the ensuing 400 years? No evidence exists of such a large body of Jews wandering through western Asia and eastern Europe during this period. Further, no evi- dence exists of the discontinuity which must have oc- curred if such a large body of Jews were suddenly integrated into existing \"small eastem European Jewish communities. Clearly, the existence of Khazar genes among Ashkenazi Jews does not negate the existence of a Jewish people continuous back to biblical times. A converse conclusion would create a standard of racial purity no people on earth could meet. Khazars con- tributed to the Jewish gene pool as has every host nation during the diaspora. After such a long period of exile, the lack of racial disparity between separated Jewish communities would have been surprising. 6.

Originating as oral com- mentary on the Bible, it was collected, organized and reduced to writing as the Mishnah during the Second Temple Period. Further commentary and additional oral traditions were added in the Gemorah, compiled in Palestine (Jerusalem) and Babylonia. Continued exegesis was produced in the Babylonian centers until they declined in the eleventh century to be replaced by two Jewish centers: the Maghreb (North Africa and Spain) and Europe (Italy, France and Germany). The difference of approach of these schools led to the distinction between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. With the persecutions and expulsions occurring in westem Europe, new commentaries failed to appear for several centuries until undertaken in Poland. See R. Adin Steinsaltz, TheEssential Talmud (New York: Basic Books, Inc., 1976). 10. Kabbalah or mysticism was divided into two parts: the Act of Creation, and the Divine Chariot. The first, more theoretical, dealt with the creation of the world and the first divine revelations. The latter, derived firom the prophet Ezekiel, dealt with the prevailing an historical perspective 45 relations between God and the world and was the source of practical Kabbalah.

CHAPTER II JEWISH COMMUNITIES OF LITHUANIA ABEL (OBELIAI) - Rakishok District E1 Abel is near Rakishok (7 miles) and is situated beside a large lake near the Latvian border. It is on the Radvilishok- Dvinsk train line. Abel had an old Jewish settlement. In the Jewish ceme- tery there were tombstones over 400 years old. In 1897, there were 652 Jews and in 1921 - 760, 67% of the general population. Prior to World War II, 300 Jewish families lived there. Most of the Jews were merchants. Market day was once a week, when hundreds of farmers and salesmen would come firom the surrounding areas. In 1937, there were 17 skilled craftsmen who were Jewish: 4 needle-workers, 3 shoemakers, 4 butchers, a baker and 5 others. There were also Jewish firuit growers, who sold their produce in Warsaw and Riga, and flax and wood merchants who had trade with other countries. The Jews were divided between Hasidim and Mitnagdim. Each group had its own prayer house. Before World War I, Note: indicates killed in the Holocaust; \"R.\"=Rabbi 50 LI7HUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNTTIES schooling was in cheders. Some children studied at the Rus- sian elementary school. Around the time of World War I, the town burned down. After World War I, a Tarbut school was established. Part of the student body continued in a high school in the region. The library, founded in 1923, had a drama club. In 1923, the first community council was chosen. Its members included: Leib Zalcstein, Zalman Meller and Boruch Kadish. The youth were in Scouts and Hechalutz (Pioneers). There were branches of Hapoel Hamizrahi, Young Zionists, Socialist Zionists and General Zionists. Among the first Pioneers to emigrate to Palestine were: Lipa Friedman, Boruch Klas, Arye Gurvitch and Yonah Musel. From the rabbinate: R. Shlomo ben Gershon [the rabbi at the end of the eighteenth century[; R. Haim ben Shlomo [from Grodno; replaced R. Shlomo ben Gershon]; R. Zalman Segal; R. Shabbetai Haim Shochet [author of \"Zahav Sha- hut\"]; R. Bunim Zemach Silver [father of Rabbi Eliezer Silver]; R. Beiylka; and the last rabbi, R. Avraham Meiro- vitch* [ffom 1928]. Natives: R. Eliezer (Zilber) Silver [born 1882; to U.S. in 1907; rabbi in Harrisburg, PA, Springfield, MA and Cincinnati, OH]; Benjamin-Gutel Zak [writer and journalist]; Abraham Harit [educator].

AKMIAN (AKMEME) - Mazhaik District B1 Akmian is near Shavli (33 miles), Kurshon, Veckshna and Mazhaik. It is situated on the Davikina and Akmiana Rivers. THE COMMUNITIES 51 In 1874, this Jewish community numbered 667 persons. In 1897, there were 543, out of a general population of 1501 . During World War I, the Jews were expelled to the interior of Russia. In 1921, there were 150 Jews. Just before the Hol- ocaust, there were 25 Jewish families. The Jews engaged in small businesses, crafits and agricul- ture. They had a beit midrash and a rabbi. The last rabbi was R. Nahum-Mordechai Verbovsky*. Additional references: Clein Famity History has a chapter on the family’s town of residence, Akmene. Pinhas Shavli by Eliezer Yerushalmi, 1958 (Hebrew), for events in the Holocaust. ALEKSAT (ALEKSOLAS) - Kovno District C3 Aleksat is a suburb of Kovno (located across the Nieman River), which Napoleon took from Prussia in 1808 and made part of the Principality of Warsaw. The Jewish population had close ties with the Kovno community. Natives: Yakov Dolnitzky [1855-1933; teacher and mas- kil]; Yosef-Shlomo Frinovitz [writer]; Yenta Serdetzky [1877-1962; writer]; Judge Miriam Ben Porat. ALEXANDROVOL (ALEKSANDRAVELE) - E1 Rakishok District Alexandrovol is near Abel (7 miles) and the railroad station of Abel. During Independent Lithuania the population of Alexan- drovol was about 200, including 10 Jewish families. 52 LITHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES ALSHISHOK - Troki District D3 Alshishok was a village near Visokidbor (3 miles), where a few Jewish families lived before World War I. [See Viso- kidbor for additional information.] ALSIAD (ALSEDZIAI) - Telz Distríct B1 Alsiad is near Telz (8 1/2 miles), Plungian (12 miles), Plotel (8 1/2), Lieplauka (4) and Kalvaria-Zhamot (4). The nearby Jewish settlement of Godnova (5 miles) was liquidated during Independent Lithuania. The nearest rail station was at Mazhaik (27 miles). The site at one time had been a bishopric settlement with a castle. Near two rivers, the landscape was rich in hills and pine forests. In 1897, there were 70 Jewish families (295 individuals) out of a general population of 1088 people. There were 231 houses. Prior to the Holocaust, there were approximately 50 Jewish families (200 people). Because of its distance ffom the railroad, the town did not develop. The new Shavli-Memel line was opened during Independent Lithuania, bringing the railroad to Lieplauka, and the town benefitted. Market day was Wednesday, and there were also 4 fairs per year. In the summer of 1920 nearly the entire town bumed down. With support ffom abroad and with the help of loans from the Joint (JDC), all the Jewish homes as well as the beit midrash were restored within a short time. The Jews made their livelihood mainly ffom trade in produce and flax, as small shopkeepers and as craffsmen. The block and nail factory belonged to Zondel Klein, and his sons sold its products in faraway Russian towns. There were 2 tanneries belonging to Kloria and the Paktor/Faktor brothers and 2 flour mills with Jewish ownership. Many of the Jews emigrated to America, South Affica or Palestine. Quite a number were supported by relatives living abroad. In the beginning of the last century the Gaon R. Zvi Braude served in the rabbinate. A story is told that once a THE COMMUNITIES 53 young lad of 12 was brought to him to study Torah. The boy, named Yisrael, was a child prodigy. When the rabbi discov- ered the uncommon talents of the boy, he gave him the title \"Little Alfas.\" Later, R. Zvi became the Chief Rabbi of Salant and became well-known by the name R. Hershel Salanter (also R. Hirsch Braude). His student became known as R. Yisrael Salanter, founder of the Musar Movement. There were Shas, Mishnayot, and \"Orach Haim\" Socie- ties. During Independent Lithuania there was a Tarbut Hebrew School and a Talmud Torah. A number of distinguished students came ffom elsewhere and married into families in the town. Among them were Avraham Kamitz, Feivel Yaffe, Shalom-Tuvia Patt [students of the Telz Yeshiva], Yosef Levinsohn [a student of the Novharodok and Lida Yeshivas], R. Sholom-Tuvia Horowitz and Abba Gefen [pharmacist] . Natives: Yosef Yaffe [received money ffom his son Max Jaffe from South Affica and divided it all between the yeshiva and charities]; Efraim Aaronsohn [teacher and maggid; presented the page of Gemora at the Shas Society]; Baer Klein [flax merchant]; Zondel Klein [son of Baer Klein; a student of the poet Yehuda Leib Gordon in Telz]; Eliezer Braude: Moshe-Leib Velman; Mordechai Braude; Moshe Gimark [grandson of the town rabbi, R. Avraham Kamitz; a merchant who also served as rabbi]; and R. Avraham-Abba Hacohen Zack* [died in the Holocaust at age 83] .

ALYTA (ALYTUS) - District Capital D3 Alyta is located 44 miles ffom Kovno and 50 miles ffom Suwalk. The Nieman River divides the town in two. Polish Alyta (west side) was in SuwaUc Province and used the laws 54 LTTHUANIAN JEWISH COMMUNITIES of the \"Code of Napoleon.\" Before World War I Russian Alyta (east side) was in Vilna Province and was govemed by Russian law. It was a railroad junction point for the Warsaw- Petersburg line and the Suwalk-Vilna line. In the Middle Ages, the town and its environs were a passing point for the Teutonic Knights in their assaults on the pagan Lithuanians. Alyta and Meretsh were in the first line of defense against the invaders. In 1377, the Germans captured Alyta, wiped out some of its residents and destroyed many of the villages in the vicinity. Knights from England took part in an attack on the Alyta region in 1392. Among them was Lord Parsi, son of the Prince of Northumberland. In 1536, the town and its environs were given by the Polish King and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Sigmund-August, as a gift to the Lithuanian Janas Zabrzezinski (Govemor of Troki) for his lifetime. After the death of Zabrzezinski, the Grand Duke transferred it to his wife, Queen Barbara (daughter of Jorgis Radzivill). After some time, it passed back to the King in the form of the \"Ekonomia of Alyta.\" In 1581 , during the reign of King Stefan Batury, it received the rights of a town (which were authorized a second time in 1740). In 1775, the regional courts were transferred from Troki and Meretsh to Alyta, which helped the town to develop and expand the population. It became an important economic center of Southem Lithuania. Merchants of the Hanseatic League traded there and put up warehouses for salt along the Nieman River. During the Polish Rebellion of 1863, it was a battlefield. As a result of its strategic position, the Russians tumed it into a third-class fortified city at the end of the nineteenth century; they put up barracks and fortífications in the surrounding area, paved roads to Kalvaria, Sieni, and Daug, and laid the SuwaÚc-Oran-Grodno rail lines. These activities THE COMMJJNITIES 55 brought an economic awakening and an improvement in the material conditions. In 1909, a fire swept the town, destroying most of the homes. During World War I, Alyta was saved from the fate that befell other cities, when the Russians surrendered to the Germans without opposition. During Independent Lithuania, the two parts of Alyta were united into one District City. The govemment offices were in the Polish section which was more developed. The city continued to be recognized as a strategic point and a military center. The Jewish community of Alyta was one of the earliest in Lithuania. The cemetery contained tombstones dating back 400 years. According to Head-Tax lists, the Jewish popula- tion was 360 in 1765. In 1847, the number dropped to 262. In 1897, there were 482 Jews, 33.6% of the general popula- tion; in 1923 - about 5000; and before the Holocaust, approximately 4000 Jews. Before World War I, some Jews in the area were large property owners. However, in Independent Lithuania they were dispossessed of their land and only a few small gardens and vegetable patches remained. Most of the Jews of Alyta made a living through trade.
