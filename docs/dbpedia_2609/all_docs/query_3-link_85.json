        "text": "25 March (Saturday) @Louis Koo Cinema, Hong Kong Arts Centre\n\nTimes are tough. What is left to desire when we are feeling drained? No matter – life is a journey with all the flavours to meet our palates. Life is a feast, and how it tastes is how we experience the full spectrum of desires – mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs. Let’s escape to our delicious desires!\n\nThe Hong Kong Arts Centre (HKAC)’s signature programmes Opening House and Late Night Series – Art X, with the theme “Craving for…” to kick off 2023, present a full-day journey with diverse arts and culture on 25 March, 2023 (Saturday). Three food-related films will infuse your day with surprises and imagination: Heavy Craving – awarded at the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival, The Zen Diary – latest film starring Sawada Kenji and Matsu Takako, and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover – a sight and sound feast with Peter Greenaway, Michael Nyman and Jean-Paul Gaultier.\n\nTickets are available at www.popticket.hk now.

She works at her mother’s childcare centre and has a harder time fitting in than a T-Rex in a petting zoo. On her birthday, Ying-Juan’s mother signs her up for a weight loss programme. To earn her mom’s approval, Ying-Juan reluctantly joins the class.\n\nBut things change when Ying-Juan meets Wu, a deliveryman who bears a checkered past underneath his radiant smile. Encouraged by Wu, Ying-Juan becomes more determined to lose weight. Meanwhile, Ying-Juan discovers Xiao-Yu, a straight-A student at the childcare centre, is a secret cross-dresser, and a special bond begins to form between them. Just when things are getting on the right track, Ying-Juan’s passion for cooking and life seem to be fading away due to her over-aggressive diet. Bitterly, Ying-Juan finds herself standing on the brink of a meltdown, both physically and psychologically…\n\n25/3 (Sat) 9:00pm\n\nThe Zen Diary\n\nFestivals: San Sebastián International Film Festival 2022 – Hawaii International Film Festival 2022\n\nDirector: Yûji Nakae\n\nCast: Kenji Sawada, Takako Matsu\n\nJapan | 2023 | 111’ | In Japanese with English subtitles | Colour\n\nWriter Tsutomu lives alone at a mountain cabin in Nagano.
