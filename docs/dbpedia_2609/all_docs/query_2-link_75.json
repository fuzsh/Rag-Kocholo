        "text": "He would have been 36 today.\n\nI remember how shaken I felt when I heard the news less than a year ago. It felt so unreal, and so unfair. I still feel a wistful pang when I recall his memory, knowing he was taken far too early. He had so much more to be here on Earth.\n\nI believe it was the 2007 TW-drama I Want to Become a Hard Persimmon (我要變成硬柿子) where I first laid eyes on him. If I recall correctly, his Mandarin wasn’t too great back then, but it was part of his charm, what with his soft-spoken personality. Down the rabbit hole I went: frequently perusing this Tumblr fanpage, lingering on his every gaze in the 2012 C-drama The Queen of SOP (勝女的代價), and forcing myself through the atrocious 2013 film The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones in aggravatingly low resolution for what felt like only a few minutes of Godfrey screentime. I think I was more enamored with the type of person he was offscreen, rather than the characters he portrayed.\n\nBut then came the 2013 C-webseries Never Give Up, Dodo (錢多多煉愛記), which solidified my love for him as an actor. I’ve written at length on the show in years past so I won’t delve any further, beyond this: farcical, hilarious, bursting at the seams with so much heart on what it means to be a silly young couple on their way to the altar. I had never seen anything so simultaneously crude yet wholesome, and I will love Godfrey forever for letting me experience such a brilliant tongue-in-cheek story in full bloom. It is a shame that he ran out of time to experience such a marriage in his own life. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to bring myself to watch any of his posthumous works, but I’m sure he approached every single one with a hardworking, professional attitude as we all knew him to have.\n\nIn my early days of discovering Godfrey, I came across one of his English-language interviews on YouTube. Hearing him speak in such a humble, gentle manner was so refreshing, like music to my ears. He was so inexplicably soft and sweet, different from the usual celebrity vibe. And granted, he was still a relative newcomer at the time, but I think he continued to carry that kind of humility in himself throughout his entire career.\n\nGodfrey is the only person in the whole wide world who can make me enjoy listening to the process of cutting onions [2:40-4:15]. The first time I watched this, I knew right then and there that he was something else, because as a self-proclaimed onion hater, I would never ever give anyone the time of day for anything onion-related. But I was simply mesmerized by how earnestly he explained every single step, like he really wanted to help you not cry while cutting an onion. He was also asked in the interview what his last meal would be if it were the end of the world [5:25]. It may have just been a spur-of-the-moment response, but I really hope he got to have that teppanyaki. Happy birthday and rest in peace forever, Godfrey. I hope there’s unlimited teppanyaki up there.\n\nI had this post planned for some time now but I realize it comes on the heels of the sudden passing of another Taiwanese celebrity, Alien Huang, which has also left me completely torn and heartbroken. Such wonderful, kindhearted, good people are leaving us, but hopefully to a better place. With so much tragedy in the world in this truly solemn year, all I can say is—please take care of yourselves, everyone. Life is fleeting, so hard as it may be… live it to the fullest."
