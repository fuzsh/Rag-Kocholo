        "text": "high concentrations in the previous studies of potentially toxic constituents of ambient PM, the air pollution literature that focused on PM and gaseous pollutant co-exposures was considered relevant to the potential morbidity of military personnel at JBB and at other sites in the Middle East. (IOM, 2011, p. 4)\n\nBased on that report, the Volume 11 committee focused on several specific pollutant categories. The following section explores the literature pertaining to the reproductive, developmental, and transgenerational effects of PM, PAHs, and PCDDs/PCDFs. Given the overlap between VOCs and solvents, relevant VOCs are discussed in the chapter on solvents.\n\nThe Volume 3 committee reviewed the literature on combustion products through 2004. It approached its task by identifying the most common components in combustion emissions, including PM, sulfur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and VOCs and then assessing the possible health effects associated with each of these agents. The Volume 3 committee considered preterm birth, low birth weight, very low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, birth defects, and childhood cancers as relevant outcomes. These outcomes were assessed in epidemiologic studies of ambient air pollution—frequently conducted in or near heavily polluted cities—or in case-control studies based on residence or parental occupation. Generally, these studies were limited by a lack of control for other risk factors, such as smoking, and the use of overly broad exposure classifications. The Volume 3 committee concluded that there was:\n\ninadequate/insufficient evidence of an association between parental combustion product exposure and any childhood cancers or any birth defects,\n\nlimited/suggestive evidence of an association between combustion product exposure during pregnancy and preterm birth,\n\nlimited/suggestive evidence of an association between combustion product exposure during pregnancy and low birth weight or intrauterine growth retardation, and\n\ninsufficient/inadequate evidence of an association at any specific time during pregnancy (e.g., first trimester) and preterm birth, low birth weight, or intrauterine growth retardation (IOM, 2005).\n\nThe 2011 IOM report Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan examined the epidemiologic literature on firefighters and people living or working near incinerators and health endpoints identified by authoritative reviews (e.g., the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry [ATSDR], the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the Hazardous Substances Database) of the 56 chemicals that were measured above the detection limit in burn pit environmental sampling data. Because data on the health of veterans or active-duty service members who were exposed to burn pits were scant, the committee reviewed studies of firefighters and incinerator workers because of their relatively similar exposure to combustion products. That committee found that there were known reproductive and developmental toxicants among the burn pit chemicals and that they should be further studied. The literature at the time included no “key” studies on reproductive or developmental outcomes, and “supporting” studies presented mixed results or showed no elevated risks. Thus, that committee concluded that there was “inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists between parental exposure to combustion products and adverse effects in their children and other adverse reproductive and perinatal outcomes in veterans, firefighters, or people living/working near incinerators” (IOM, 2011, p. 88).\n\nParticulate Matter\n\nParticulate matter is a general term used to describe a large group of chemically diverse substances that exist as particles in ambient air (Spektor, 1998). The particles are derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources; they may form in the atmosphere from a variety of sources or be emitted to the atmosphere with gaseous emissions. Coarse PM (10 μm or less in diameter; PM10) originates from sources such as mining, construction operations, and the resuspension of soil on roads and streets. Fine PM (less than 2.5 μm; PM2.5) and ultrafine PM (less than 0.1 μm) are found in emissions from the combustion of motor-vehicle fuel; smelters and steel mills; the combustion of wood, oil, and coal; and the atmospheric alteration of SO2, organics, and NO (NRC, 2010). The size of the particles is one of the major determinants of its toxicity. Only inhaled PM10 and smaller particles are deposited in the lower respiratory tract (i.e., below the vocal cords). Toxicity concerns are greatest for fine PM and ultrafine PM that may be deposited in smaller airways and alveoli (IOM, 2005). Ultrafine particles may even pass through the alveolar-capillary membrane into the circulatory system.\n\nThe daily exposures of service members to windblown dust and frequent dust storms increased their concerns about the possible health effects that might result from these exposures. In response to those concerns, the Department of Defense (DoD) designed and implemented the Enhanced Particulate Matter Surveillance Program to characterize and quantify the PM at 15 sites in the Central Command Area of Operations in the Middle East, beginning in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Iraq in 2003. PM sources in the Middle East included dust storms (which would carry the particles considerable distances), agricultural activities, emissions from vehicles and burn pits, battery-processing facilities, cooking stoves and fires, flaring at natural gas and oil extraction facilities, and fertilizer plants (NRC, 2010). DoD monitoring at JBB in Iraq in 2007 and 2009 found that PM10 levels ranged from 2 μg/m3 to 9,576 μg/m3 (with averages of 126 μg/m3 in 2007 and 709 μg/m3 in 2009) (IOM, 2011). Another study of three military sites in Kuwait in 2004–2005 found that the average PM10 concentrations fluctuated between 66 and 93 μg/m3 (Brown et al., 2008). In its review of the DoD Enhanced Particulate Matter Surveillance Program, a National Research Council committee determined that ambient PM10 concentrations in most areas of the Middle East exceeded the World Health Organization’s annual average air quality guideline of 20 μg/m3 (NRC, 2010). As a point of reference, PM exposure in the United States is subject to great variability as well, with some areas such as southern California, southern Arizona, and central New Mexico reporting average annual PM10 concentrations >50 μg/m3 (EPA, 2009).\n\nIn 2009, EPA issued an Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter that described the human health effects associated with ambient PM through 2009. EPA concluded that the “epidemiologic and toxicologic evidence is suggestive of a causal relationship between long-term exposures to PM2.5 and reproductive and developmental outcomes” (p. 2-13). Epidemiologic data showed effects on birth weight, infant mortality, and fetal growth, with less consistent evidence for preterm birth, growth restriction, birth defects, and decreased sperm quality. The available toxicologic data also supported those associations but added little to the mechanistic understanding. EPA also noted that some PM studies had shown epigenetic effects (i.e., changes in DNA methylation), but their relevance to human health was unclear (EPA, 2009).\n\nAlthough the data presented in this chapter focus on PM, it is just one of many constituents of air pollution determined by the EPA to cause adverse health effects, a so-called criteria pollutant. Other EPA criteria pollutants include O3, CO, NOX, and SO2 (EPA, 2018). Because air pollution is a mixture whose composition varies depending on the source, with emissions from combustion sources generally regarded as the most toxic, it is difficult to distinguish the contributions of specific pollutants from the effects of the overall mixture. Furthermore, PM concentrations are often correlated with other pollutants\n\nemitted during combustion, and so the committee recognizes that PM toxicity does not exclude effects of co-pollutants.\n\nLike the Volume 3 committee, the Volume 11 committee did not examine the chemical and physical composition of particles because of the wide variation in particle components across geographic locations and sources, including differences in the relative amounts of elemental and organic carbon, sulfates, nitrates, pollen, microbial contaminants, and metals. Furthermore, the bioavailability and toxicity of such chemicals is affected by adsorption to the particle so that the toxicity of a chemical alone does not represent its toxicity when adsorbed on the particle (IOM, 2005). Rather, the Volume 11 committee focuses on studies of the toxicity of PM, not studies of the individual chemicals that might be adsorbed onto or incorporated into the PM.\n\nThe literature on the reproductive and developmental effects of PM is varied and extensive. The committee’s search identified 340 relevant publications of reproductive and developmental effects associated with PM published in 2004 or later (combustion products are reviewed in Volume 3 through 2004). Because EPA conducted an extensive review of the literature on the health effects of PM through 2009, the Volume 11 committee limited its review to studies published in 2009 or later, which totaled about 300 publications. No specific studies were identified on the reproductive or developmental effects of PM exposure in veterans. Given the volume of data, the committee paid special attention to evidence synthesized in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as well as to studies on preconception or first-trimester exposures because they were considered to be most relevant to potential veteran exposures.\n\nReproductive Effects\n\nSeveral recent publications have explored possible associations between PM and aspects of reproductive health or fertility in men and women—including endometriosis, fertility and fecundity, offspring sex ratios, and impacts on sperm. With the exception of fertility studies that rely on self-reports of contraception use, most of the studies on reproductive effects in women rely on outcomes documented in birth certificates, hospital discharge records, and registries.\n\nReproductive Effects in Men\n\nA systematic review by Lafuente et al. (2016) evaluated 17 studies on the impacts of air pollution on sperm quality. Although the studies examined a range of windows of exposure before semen collection, all included the 90 days before sampling. The authors also noted a wide variability in the degree to which confounders such as age, smoking, body mass index (BMI), and socioeconomic status (SES) were controlled for. Thirteen studies measured air pollution exposure, six used biomarkers of air pollution exposure, and two did both. The authors concluded that PM2.5 was not associated with sperm DNA fragmentation, decreased sperm count, or alterations in sperm morphology.\n\nFour cross-sectional studies examined the effects of PM exposure within 90 days of semen collection with mixed results, as discussed below (Hansen et al., 2010; Jurewicz et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2014). Most of the studies had negative findings.\n\nSignificant detrimental effects on sperm count and concentration were reported by Wu et al. (2017) in association with PM2.5 exposure 70–90 days before sample collection and with the highest quintile of exposure over the whole exposure period of 0 to 90 days (sperm concentration β= –0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] –0.67– –0.16; sperm count β= –0.40, 95% CI –0.66– –0.14; adjusted p-value for trend=0.018 for both). These data showed that there were no effects on sperm motility. The authors also noted no effect of PM10 on sperm centration, count, or morphology. Hansen et al. (2010) found that PM2.5\n\nhad no effect on sperm morphology, cytoplasmic droplets, DNA fragmentation, or immature sperm in an occupational cohort of 228 fertile men. Zhou et al. (2014) reported a positive association between PM10 and sperm concentration (β=0.08, 95% CI 0.02–0.11) and a negative association with sperm morphology (β= –0.21, 95% CI –0.80– –0.003) and some, but not all, measures of motility (motile sperm curve linear velocity β= –0.16, 95% CI –0.80 to 0.68, and motile sperm straight line velocity β= –0.21, 95% CI –0.82– –0.016); PM10 was not related to semen volume, progressive motility, total motility, or linearity.\n\nJurewicz et al. (2015) examined the relationship between PM and the percentage of sperm with chromosome disomy (X, Y, 13, 18, and 21). The authors observed significant relationships between PM2.5 and disomy Y (YY18 β=0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.85), sex chromosome disomy (β=0.78, 95% CI 0.59–0.99), and chromosome 21 disomy (%2121 β=0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.97), with no relationship to XY18, XX18, %1818, %1313, and total disomy. PM10 was also related to chromosome 21 disomy (%2121 β=0.58, 95% CI 0.46–0.72), but not to any of the other chromosome disomies.\n\nReproductive Effects in Women\n\nOne systematic review examined the human and animal literature published through early 2014 on fertility in association with PM (Frutos et al., 2015). Ten studies on live births, miscarriages, pregnancy, implantation, and embryo quality were assessed. The authors identified PM10 as having a detrimental effect on live births, implantation rates, and miscarriage, while PM2.5 was reported to adversely affect pregnancy rates. The authors also noted that impacts were greatest among sub-fertile women undergoing assisted reproduction.\n\nThree cohort studies examined the association between PM exposure and the ability to conceive. The Nurses’ Health Study II, a large prospective cohort study of female nurses, examined associations between fertility (defined as attempted conception for ≥12 months without success) over 10 years and PM2.5, PM10–2.5, and PM10 levels based on residential address. Those investigators reported elevated hazard ratios for all three sizes of PM expressed as 2-year, 4-year, or cumulative averages, but all were nonsignificant after adjustment for confounders (Mahalingaiah et al., 2016). In a study that examined a cohort of 1,916 births in Teplice, Czech Republic, fecundability (the probability of pregnancy among noncontracepting couples each month) was found to be significantly related to local PM2.5 levels. Exposure in the previous 30 days was significantly related to decreased fecundability (fecundity ratio=0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.97 per 10 μg/m3 increase). Fecundability was slightly reduced with PM2.5 exposure in the first month of unprotected intercourse, but not significantly. Both average PM2.5 in the previous 30-day period and the 2-month average exposure to PM2.5 were significantly related to decreased fecundability (adjusted fecundability ratios per 10 μg/m3=0.86, [95% CI 0.77–0.97] and 0.78, [95% CI 0.65–0.94], respectively) (Slama et al., 2013). Conversely, Nobles et al. (2018) reported on fecundability, over a year compared to modeled PM 5 days before and 10 days after ovulation in 501 couples living in Michigan and Texas but did not find evidence of adverse effects of PM2.5 or PM10 on fecundability. Nieuwenhuijsen et al. (2014) compared annual averages of PM2.5, PM10–2.5, and PM10 per interquartile range (IQR) change with birth rates at the census tract level and found a significantly decreased birth rate in association with PM10–2.5 that remained after adjustment for multiple covariates (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=0.88, 95% CI 0.83–0.94; PM2.5 IRR=0.98, 95% CI 0.95–1.02; PM10 IRR=0.99, 95% CI 0.97–1.02).\n\nEndometriosis, which can impair fertility, was investigated in one publication of the Nurses’ Health Study II (Mahalingaiah et al., 2014). No associations between PM2.5, PM10–2.5, or PM10 and confirmed cases of endometriosis were reported in this cohort.\n\nMerklinger-Gruchala et al. (2017) reported on associations between pollutants and changes in menstrual cycle length in 133 Polish women as a possible contributing factor to fertility problems. While\n\nPM10 was not associated with overall cycle length or follicular phase length, mean PM10 was associated with a shortened luteal phase length (β= –0.02 day per 1μg/m3, 95% CI –0.04– –0.00).\n\nSex Ratio\n\nTwo studies of sex ratios indicated that increased exposure to PM favors female births. In a Chinese birth cohort study that examined concentrations of PM10 in the 13 days before conception versus sex ratios, Lin et al. (2015) found a significantly higher probability of female births with increased PM10 exposure 2 days before conception (excess risk = 0.64%, 95% CI 0.35–0.93 for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10), while controlling for confounders such as maternal age, parental education, and weather conditions. One ecologic time-series study found a negative association between the ratio of male to female births and annual average PM10 levels at the district level (β= –0.001, p=0.02), although no potential confounders or other pollutants were included as covariates in the analysis (El Khouri Miraglia et al., 2013).\n\nAdverse Pregnancy Outcomes\n\nThe relationship between exposure to PM and adverse pregnancy outcomes has been studied by numerous researchers assessing a variety of maternal and fetal outcomes. The Volume 11 committee identified several studies of pregnancy outcomes that affect the health of the mother and child; these include 2 studies of placental problems, 3 studies on gestational diabetes, and 12 studies on preeclampsia1 and gestational hypertension. Several studies also examined the associations between maternal exposure to PM during pregnancy and effects on the uterus and placenta and also on fetal biomarkers that are thought to represent inflammation at the time of birth.\n\nThe Volume 11 committee then focused on the effects of PM on birth outcomes such as preterm birth, low birth weight (less than 2,500 g), and fetal death. In the sections on preterm birth and birth weight, the committee evaluated numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were not available for outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirths (fetal loss after 20 weeks of gestation), and spontaneous abortion (fetal loss before 20 weeks of gestation), and therefore the committee considered individual studies for these events. For the most part, the committee considers studies that include appropriate statistical adjustments for potential confounders and indicates instances when a study may not have accounted for common confounders.\n\nUnderstanding the effects of prenatal PM on birth outcomes requires an appreciation of several confounding issues, such as SES and maternal health. Erickson et al. (2016) found that 49% of the between-neighborhood differences in birth weight were related to neighborhood SES and the interaction between SES and PM2.5. SES modified the effect of PM2.5 on birth weight in such a way that the most pronounced effect was in neighborhoods with lower SES. Mendola et al. (2016) reported significantly increased risks of preterm birth among mothers with asthma exposed to PM10 in the last 6 weeks of pregnancy but no association between preterm birth and PM10 among women without asthma.\n\nPlacental Problems Two studies examined placental problems and prenatal PM exposure. In Japan,\n\n___________________\n\nMichikawa et al. (2016) found a significantly elevated risk of placenta accreta2 and placenta previa associated with exposure to suspended PM (equivalent to PM7) in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy (placenta previa odds ratio [OR]=1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.23; placenta accreta OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.07–1.66, per 10 μg/m3), but no associations were found for exposure during gestation weeks 5–12 or in the second trimester. Ibrahimou et al. (2017) examined placental abruption as recorded on Florida birth certificates (884 placental abruptions among 100,495 births) and found an increased risk was associated with PM2.5 exposure throughout pregnancy or during the first trimester. Slightly elevated and significant risks were identified for first-trimester exposure to specific components of PM2.5 (aluminum and elemental carbon).\n\nGestational Diabetes Gestational diabetes was the focus of three U.S. cohort studies. In a large cohort study of 219,952 births, Robledo et al. (2015) found no association between gestational diabetes and PM2.5 or PM10 in the 3 months before pregnancy or in the first trimester. However, Hu et al. (2015) reported an increased risk of gestational diabetes with PM2.5 exposure in the first trimester (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.06–1.16), but not in the second trimester, after controlling for other pollutants although not for prepregnancy weight, an important risk factor for gestational diabetes. Investigating PM2.5 exposure in the second trimester, Fleisch et al. (2014) found a significant increase in impaired glucose tolerance when comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of exposure (OR=2.63, 95% CI 1.15–6.01) but no association with gestational diabetes as a clinical diagnosis.\n\nPreeclampsia and Gestational Hypertension One systematic review and meta-analysis of literature published between 2009 and 2013 examined the association between PM and preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, with seven studies on exposure and five on PM10 exposure (Pedersen et al., 2014). Pooled estimates showed significant increases in all hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, combined, with each 5 μg/m3 increase of PM2.5 (OR=1.57, 95% CI 1.26–1.96) and each 10 μg/m3 increase of PM10 (OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.02–1.26).\n\nAmong the studies discussed below, one found increased risks of preeclampsia with PM10 exposure (Lee et al., 2013), while four did not (Dadvand et al., 2013; Mobasher et al., 2013; van den Hooven et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011). Four studies of PM2.5 found positive associations with preeclampsia (Dadvand et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2013; Mobasher et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011), and two studies did not (Rudra et al., 2011; Savitz et al., 2015). One study of preconception exposure by Rudra et al. (2011) found no relationship between PM2.5 and preeclampsia.\n\nLee et al. (2013) found no significant relationship between preeclampsia and first-trimester PM10 or PM2.5 exposure. However, among mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy, the risks of gestational hypertension were elevated with PM exposure (PM10 OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.25; PM2.5 OR=1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.24, per IQR change); this elevation was not seen among mothers who smoked during pregnancy.\n\nIn a cohort study in Spain of 8,398 pregnancies (including 103 cases of preeclampsia), Dadvand et al. (2013) found no association between first- or second-trimester PM exposures and preeclampsia or between third-trimester PM10 exposures and preeclampsia. However, IQR increases of PM2.5 in the third trimester (OR=1.51, 95% CI 1.13–2.01) and over the entire pregnancy (OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.02–1.71) were both related to preeclampsia, as were increases among late-onset (OR=1.42, 95% CI 1.01–2.00) but not early-onset cases.\n\n___________________\n\nAmong 81,186 births in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Wu et al. (2011) found no elevated risks of preeclampsia with PM2.5 or PM10 exposure throughout the entire pregnancy using regression models and PM measured at air quality monitoring stations. However, when an air dispersion model (CALINE 4 model) was used for PM2.5 exposure, significantly elevated risks were found (LA County OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.15; Orange County OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.04–1.17). Another study in LA County used a case-control design (136 cases, 162 controls) to examine the roles of pollutant exposure and BMI on preeclampsia and found a significant interaction (p=0.02). Results showed an increased risk of preeclampsia with PM2.5 exposure in the first trimester among women with BMI <30 (OR=8.63, 95% CI 3.10–24.1) but no significant increase among obese women (BMI >30) or related to PM10 exposure (Mobasher et al., 2013). A cohort study of pregnant women in the Netherlands showed no relationship between PM10 exposure in any trimester and preeclampsia (van den Hooven et al., 2011).\n\nRudra et al. (2011) examined PM2.5 exposure from prepregnancy through the last month of pregnancy in 3,509 Washington State births and found no association between PM2.5 and preeclampsia. Savitz et al. (2015) also examined PM2.5 exposure in the first and second trimesters and found no association with gestational hypertension or with mild or severe preeclampsia among 268,601 New York City births.\n\nSeveral studies discussed below reported a positive association between maternal blood pressure or gestational hypertension and exposure to PM (Lee et al., 2012; van den Hooven et al., 2011; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2014); however, one study found no such effects (Hampel et al., 2011).\n\nXu et al. (2014) reported on the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia) among 22,041 pregnancies in Florida. Although there was no association between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and PM2.5 exposure in the first trimester, elevated risks were reported for exposure in the second trimester (OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.13–1.46) and across the entire pregnancy (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.08–1.43).\n\nIn a cohort of 1,684 pregnant women in Pennsylvania, investigators compared blood pressure measurements taken in the first 20 weeks of gestation with those measured late in pregnancy and found increases that were associated with first-trimester PM2.5 exposure (systolic β=0.84 mmHg, 95% CI −0.33–2.00, and diastolic β=0.60 mmHg, 95% CI –0.27–1.47, per IQR) and PM10 exposure (systolic β=1.88 mmHg, 95% CI 0.84–2.93, and diastolic β=0.63 mmHg, 95% CI –0.50–1.76). No associations were seen with exposures during the second or third trimesters (Lee et al., 2012).\n\nHampel et al. (2011) measured blood pressure longitudinally in a cohort of 1,500 pregnant French women and assessed associations with PM10 exposures in the preceding 7 days. No significant changes for systolic and diastolic pressure changes were associated with exposure on each day in the week before blood pressure was measured. However, a significant decrease in systolic pressure was observed when PM10 exposure was averaged across the 7 days before measurement (–0.3 mmHg, 95% CI –0.6–0.0).\n\nAmong 7,006 Dutch women, van den Hooven et al. (2011) reported that 10 μg/m3 increases in PM10 concentrations were associated with a 1.11 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure in the second trimester (95% CI 0.43–1.79) and a 2.11 mmHg increase in the third trimester (95% CI 1.34–2.89), but there were no associations with first-trimester exposure or diastolic blood pressure. The authors reported a significantly increased risk of pregnancy-related hypertension (OR=1.72, 95% CI 1.12–2.63) for each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10.\n\nVinikoor-Imler et al. (2012) found increased risks of gestational hypertension with IQR increases in PM2.5 and PM10 averaged to represent the entire pregnancy in 222,775 North Carolina births (PM2.5 RR=1.11, 95% CI 1.08–1.15, and PM10 RR=1.07, 95% CI 1.04–1.11). The associations remained significant after adjustments for neighborhood poverty. However, this study did not control for maternal weight gain, prepregnancy weight, or hypertension.\n\nPrenatal exposure to PM2.5 has also been associated with an increased systolic blood pressure in the child at birth. Each IQR increase in PM2.5 estimated for the 2–90 days before birth was associated with a 1.0 mmHg increase in systolic blood pressure (95% CI 0.1–1.8) (van Rossem et al., 2015).\n\nMost of the studies cited above controlled for prepregnancy weight, BMI, or maternal weight gain, all of which are important risk factors for gestational hypertension and preeclampsia (Dadvand et al., 2013; Hampel et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2012; Mobasher et al., 2013; Rudra et al., 2011; Savitz et al., 2015; van den Hooven et al., 2011). Three studies did not adjust for maternal BMI (Lee et al., 2013; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011), thus limiting their usefulness.\n\nBiomarkers of Oxidative Stress and Inflammation at Birth Thirteen studies identified by the committee investigated various measures and markers of stress and inflammation in the uterus, placenta, and cord blood in relation to prenatal PM exposure. Toxicologic data suggests that adverse health effects in offspring may be mediated by a greater susceptibility of the mother to the oxidative and inflammatory effects of PM during pregnancy; for example, inflammatory or immune response in pregnant mice has been associated with health effects in the offspring (EPA, 2009).\n\nEffects of PM on the uterus and placenta have been studied in four cohorts. In a large cohort of 5,059 mother–child pairs in Boston, increased risks of intrauterine inflammation (intrapartum fever and placental pathology) were reported with the highest quartile of PM2.5 exposure compared with the lowest quartile in the 3 months before conception (OR=1.52, 95% CI 1.22–1.89), first trimester (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.55–2.40), second trimester (OR=1.67, 95% CI 1.35–2.08), and third trimester (OR=1.53, 95% CI 1.24–1.90) (Nachman et al., 2016). Placental 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NTp; a marker of oxidative stress) levels increased with each IQR increase in PM2.5 (29%, 95% CI 4.9–58.6) and black carbon (23.6%, 95% CI 4.4–46.4) in the first trimester in a birth cohort in Belgium (N=90) (Saenen et al., 2016). A study of 3,614 Italian women did not find an association between PM10 and placental weight (Giovanni et al., 2018).\n\nTo investigate whether placental oxidative stress could affect fetal growth and maternal hypertensive complications, van den Hooven et al. (2012b) measured growth factors that are important for placental growth in maternal and cord blood as well as placental vascular resistance and placental weight in 7,801 pregnant women in the Netherlands (known as the Generation R Study). Throughout pregnancy, PM10 exposure (10 μg/m3) was associated with decreased maternal growth factor levels as measured by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1= –4.5%, 95% CI –8.4– –0.5) and changes in fetal growth factors (sFlt-1= 35.8%, 95% CI 25.6–45.9; and placental growth factor= –16.3%, 95% CI –21.9– –10.7%). Although PM10 was associated with the umbilical artery pulsatility index in the second trimester (difference= –0.10, 95% CI –0.17– –0.03), it was not associated with the uterine artery pulsatility index, uterine artery notching, or placental weight (van den Hooven et al., 2012b). These findings indicate that PM may affect placental and fetal growth.\n\nSeveral studies documented changes in immune markers in cord blood associated with PM exposure. Ashley-Martin et al. (2016) reported an association between the highest quartile of exposure to PM2.5 in the first trimester and immunoglobulin E (IgE) in cord blood among 582 female births (OR=2.37, 95% CI 1.23–4.58) in Canada, although there was no association among 671 male births or with other markers (IL-33 and TSLP). The prevalence ratios of elevated cord serum IgE for each μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 indicated decreased risks in the first month of pregnancy and elevated risks in months 4 through 7 in a study of 459 births in the Czech Republic; the results were modified by maternal IgE levels and cigarette smoke (Herr et al., 2011).\n\nLevels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, have been studied in association with PM exposure. Lee et al. (2011) found an increased risk of having elevated C-reactive protein (≥8 ng/ml) in maternal blood collected before the 22nd week of gestation and PM in the month before sample collection (PM10 9.2 μg/m3 increase OR=1.41, 95% CI 0.99–2.00; PM2.5 4.6 μg/m3 increase OR=1.47, 95% CI\n\n1.05–2.06) in a cohort of nonsmoking pregnant women in Pennsylvania. In the Netherlands, the highest quartile of PM10 exposure in the 2 weeks before maternal blood sampling had increased risks of elevated C-reactive protein levels (≥8 ng/ml) among pregnant women (OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.08–1.61), but there was no association at 1 and 4 weeks before sampling. This study also found that high PM10 throughout the pregnancy was related to elevated fetal C-reactive protein at delivery (>1 mg/L) (OR=2.18, 95% CI 1.08–4.38) (van den Hooven et al., 2012a).\n\nChanges in newborn cord blood lymphocyte subpopulations associated with PM10 exposure before and during pregnancy were reported among 370 women giving birth at a hospital in France (Baiz et al., 2011). Preconception exposure to PM10 (per 10 μg/m3 increase) was associated with increases in CD8+ cells (β=1.52, 95% CI 0.05–2.99) and decreases in CD4+CD25+ cells (β= –0.82, 95% CI –1.45– –0.19). First-trimester exposure was associated with decreases in CD3+ cells (β= –3.10, 95% CI –6.02– –0.18) and increases in natural killer (NK) cells (β=0.22, 95% CI 0.008–0.43), and exposure across all three trimesters was associated with decreases in CD4+CD5+ cells (1st β= –0.71, 95% CI –1.37– –0.05; 2nd β= –0.88, 95% CI –1.30– –0.17; 3rd β= –0.59, 95% CI –1.15– –0.04) (Baiz et al., 2011). Another study of 1,397 births in the Czech Republic also showed changes in lymphocyte subpopulations with PM exposure in early and late pregnancy. First-trimester PM2.5 exposure was associated with increases in CD3+ and CD4+ fractions and decreases in CD19+ fraction and NK cells; whereas, third-trimester exposure was associated with decreased CD3+ and CD4+ fractions and increased CD19+ fraction and NK cells (Herr et al., 2010).\n\nIn the cord blood of 197 newborns from the Belgian ENVIRONAGE (Environmental influence ON early AGEing) study, Martens et al. (2017a) measured oxylipins as a marker of the oxidation of fatty lipids. The investigators found that oxylipins, representing the lipoxygenase metabolic pathway for inflammation, were significantly associated with PM2.5 in the second trimesters for both the 5-LOX and the 12/15-LOX pathways, but only the 5-LOX pathway was significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure throughout the pregnancy. Reductions in telomere length, a marker of oxidative stress and inflammation, were studied in 730 newborns from the same cohort study (Martens et al., 2017b). Each 5 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 in the second trimester was significantly associated with shorter telomere length in cord-blood leukocytes (-9.4%, 95% CI –13.1– –5.6%) and placental tissue (-0.1%, 95% CI –11.6– –2.4%).\n\nFetal Growth and Preterm Birth There is an extensive literature surrounding birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal death) associated with PM, often with conflicting results. The committee’s search identified 96 studies on preterm birth and birth weight (70 studies on birth weight, small for gestational age, and intrauterine growth retardation, and 44 studies on preterm birth) published since 2009. To best describe this volume of literature, the committee examined relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses and selected publications that described special issues of interest such as confounders and preconception exposure. The systematic reviews and meta-analyses reviewed here are summarized in Table 6-1. Fetal death, including stillbirths and miscarriages, associated with PM exposure has been the subject of relatively few extensive reviews and meta-analyses, and those studies are reviewed individually.\n\nEight systematic reviews and meta-analyses have assessed the consistency of the literature on adverse birth outcomes associated with PM exposure. These assessments cover the literature on preterm birth and birth weight through 2015 and small for gestational age through 2014. All these reviews noted difficulties in assessing the evidence due to the various studies’ heterogeneity in study design, exposure assessment methods, windows of exposure assessment (each trimester, only specific trimesters or time periods, or the entire duration of the pregnancy), the ability to adjust for confounders (e.g., SES, smoking, and maternal nutrition), and the level of increase reported in analyses (IQR=1, 10, 50 or 100 μg/m3; low versus high exposure; distance from an air quality monitoring station, etc.). Furthermore, there are\n\ninconsistencies among trimester-specific results. All the meta-analyses express pooled estimates as ORs per 10 μg/m3 increases in PM. These inconsistencies make the interpretation of the results challenging and highlight the need for additional work in this area.\n\nPreterm birth associated with PM2.5 was the subject of two systematic reviews and four meta-analyses. The two reviews reported significantly elevated risks of preterm birth in association with prenatal PM2.5 exposure (Bosetti et al., 2010; Shah et al., 2011). Of the four meta-analyses that reported pooled estimates of preterm birth associated with prenatal exposure to PM2.5 throughout the gestational period, all reported slight but significantly elevated ORs (Lamichhane et al., 2015; Sapkota et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015a), which ranged from 1.10 (95% CI 1.03–1.18), based on eight studies (Zhu, et al., 2015a), to 1.15 (95% CI 1.14–1.16), based on six studies (Sapkota et al., 2012). First-, second-, and third-trimester-specific estimates were less consistent. Sapkota et al. (2012) found positive associations in all three trimesters (ORs=1.04, 95% CI 0.73–1.34; 1.07, 95% CI 1.00–1.15; and 1.15, 95% CI 1.15–1.16, respectively), but only the associations for the second and third trimesters were significant. By contrast, Zhu et al. (2015a) found that none of the trimester-specific estimates were elevated (ORs=0.96, 95% CI 0.77–1.21; 0.90, 95% CI 0.79–1.03; and 0.97, 95% CI 0.89–1.05, respectively), and Sun et al. (2015) reported elevated but not statistically significant estimates (ORs=1.08, 95% CI 0.92–1.26; 1.09, 95% CI 0.82–1.44; and 1.08, 95% CI 0.99–1.17, respectively). Lamichhane et al. (2015) did not report trimester-specific estimates for PM2.5.\n\nFewer studies have examined the risk of preterm birth in association with prenatal exposure to PM10. Four systematic reviews reported 1 of 1, 1 of 2, 3 of 9, and 5 of 10 studies that found statistically significant elevated risks (Bosetti et al., 2010; Jacobs et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2013; Shah et al., 2011). Such heterogeneity leaves unanswered questions related to the effects of PM on the risk of preterm birth. Two of the meta-analyses calculated pooled estimates for PM10 throughout the gestational period and preterm birth; the first found an OR=1.02 (95% CI 0.99–1.04) based on eight studies (Sapkota et al., 2012), while the second calculated an OR=1.23 (95% CI 1.04–1.41) based on three studies (Lamichhane et al., 2015). Regarding trimester-specific pooled estimates, Sapkota et al. (2012) found significantly increased ORs for the second and third trimesters (OR=1.02, 95% CI 0.97–1.06; OR=1.02 95% CI 1.01–1.03, respectively), whereas Lamichhane et al. (2015) found no significant increase with PM10 exposure in the first trimester (OR=0.98, 95% CI 0.94–1.03), a significant decrease in the second trimester (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.95–0.99), and significant increase in the third trimester (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.01–1.05).\n\nTwo systematic reviews and four meta-analyses assessed decreases in birth weight and low birth weight in association with prenatal exposure to PM2.5. The systematic reviews identified two (out of four) and two (out of three) studies that reported effects on birth weight in association with PM2.5 (Bosetti et al., 2010; Shah et al., 2011). Three of the meta-analyses calculated pooled estimates of decreases in birth weight associated with 10 μg/m3 changes in PM2.5 exposure throughout gestation with statistically significant results: β= –15.9 (95% CI –26.8– –5.0), based on 32 studies (Sun et al., 2016); β= –14.58 (95% CI –19.31– –9.86), based on 12 studies (Zhu et al., 2015a); and β= –13.88 (95% CI –15.7– –12.06), based on 8 studies (Lamichhane et al., 2015). Of those that reported trimester-specific pooled estimates, Sun et al. (2016) found significant decreases in birth weight for the second and third trimesters (βs= –12.6 and –10.0, respectively) as did Zhu et al. (βs= –8.0 and –14.91, respectively). Pooled estimates of the association between low birth weight and prenatal exposure to PM2.5 throughout gestation showed significant increases: OR=1.09 (95% CI 1.03–1.15), based on 19 studies (Sun et al., 2016); OR=1.05 (95% CI 1.02–1.07), based on 6 studies (Zhu et al., 2015a); and OR=1.09 (95% CI 0.9–1.32), based on 4 studies (Sapkota et al., 2012). By trimesters, Sun et al. (2015) reported increased but not statistically significant risks of low birth weight for PM10 exposure in all three trimesters (ORs=1.026, 1.035, 1.233,\n\nrespectively). The Volume 11 committee notes that these findings are mixed and indicate the need for additional work in this area.\n\nChanges in birth weight and low birth weight associated with PM10 throughout gestation were examined in two systematic reviews that reported statistically significant effects in 4 out of 12 studies (Bosetti et al., 2010) and four out of seven studies (Jacobs et al., 2017) as well as in two meta-analyses (Lamichhane et al., 2015; Sapkota et al., 2012). Lamichhane et al. (2015) examined changes in birth weight in 16 studies and reported β= –6.50 (95% CI –10.94– –2.5). The authors examined trimester-specific risks stratified by whether the study adjusted for smoking in its analyses and found that among smoking-adjusted studies the risks were significantly elevated for the third trimester (trimester effect sizes –1.43, –6.50, and –5.11), while the opposite was true for smoking-unadjusted studies: the first and second trimesters had significantly elevated risks (trimester effect sizes –3.31, –1.24, 1.36). Residual confounding by smoking was about 6.73%. Sapkota et al. (2012) reported a pooled estimated OR for low birth weight of 1.02 (95% CI 0.99–1.05), based on 11 studies, with trimester-specific estimates close to 1 (ORs=1.0, 1.0, 1.02, respectively).\n\nSmall for gestational age was assessed in two systematic reviews, both of which had three studies (out of three and four studies, respectively) finding significant effects associated with PM2.5 (Bosetti et al., 2010; Shah et al., 2011); Bosetti et al. (2010) found one (out of three studies) that reported significant effects associated with PM10. The Zhu et al. (2015a) meta-analysis found an association between small for gestational age and PM2.5 exposure throughout gestation, with an OR=1.15 (95% CI 1.10–1.20) based on six studies. Trimester-specific estimates were all slightly elevated and statistically significant (ORs 1.07, 1.06, 1.06, respectively). Collectively, the data suggest that PM may have a slight but significant effect on small-for-gestational-age pregnancy outcomes.\n\nOne recent publication that reported on 499 participants of the Belgian ENVIRONAGE study found that PM2.5 was related to thyroid hormone levels in cord blood, which may mediate effects on birth weight. For an IQR increase in PM2.5 (8.2 μg/m3) in the third trimester, cord blood levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) declined 11.6% (95% CI –21.8– –0.1), and the free thyroxin/triiodothyronine ratio (FT4/FT3) decreased by 62.7% (95% CI –91.6– –33.8%). Only FT4 was significantly associated with decreases in birth weight, and the analysis estimated that FT4 levels explained 21% of the association (-19g, 95% CI –37– –1) between PM2.5 and birth weight (Janssen et al., 2017).\n\nFetal Death, Stillbirth, and Miscarriage Fetal mortality was not adequately captured by the systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Several studies have examined the associations between spontaneous abortion/miscarriage and stillbirth and PM exposure using hospital discharge data or birth records and registries. A number of studies on the relationship between exposure to traffic-related air pollutants (which includes PM2.5) and fetal death (spontaneous abortion and stillbirth) have reported significant associations (Arroyo et al., 2016; DeFranco et al., 2015; Enkhmaa et al., 2014; Faiz et al., 2012, 2013; Green et al., 2015; Hwang et al., 2011; Moridi et al., 2014).\n\nTwo studies examined the risk of miscarriage/spontaneous abortion with PM exposure. Candela et al. (2015) examined the risk of miscarriage (1,375 miscarriages among 11,875 pregnancies) in association with PM10 from local incinerators in Northern Italy. Although ORs reflected an increasing risk of spontaneous abortions with increasing quartiles of PM10 exposure (p-value for trend=0.042), none of the estimates were significantly elevated (highest quintile [PM10>1.33 ng/m3] versus no exposure OR=1.29, 95% CI 0.97–1.72). Although there was no significant interaction (p=0.19), risks of spontaneous abortion with high levels of PM10 exposure were observed among women with no history of previous spontaneous abortion (4th quintile OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.08–1.94; 5th quintile OR=1.44, 95% CI 1.06–1.96; p-value for trend=0.009). Enkhmaa et al. (2014) examined the correlations between monthly\n\nhospitalizations for spontaneous abortions in 1,219 women and monthly PM2.5 and PM10 levels in Mongolia and found them to be significantly correlated (R=0.92 and 0.64, respectively, both p<0.001).\n\nStillbirth was reported by five independent studies. Faiz et al. (2013) examined 1,719 stillbirths in New Jersey in a cohort study (n=343,077) using a case-crossover design to investigate the effects of pollutants in the week before delivery; it found no significant associations with PM2.5. Green et al. (2015) reported on 13,999 stillbirths in several areas of California (compared with more than 3 million live births) and found no significant association between PM2.5 and stillbirths in any trimester. However, stratification by maternal demographic variables revealed significant effects of maternal age (25–34 years OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.0–1.16; ≥35 years OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24) and maternal educational level (college or beyond OR=1.32, 95% CI 1.19–1.47). DeFranco et al. (2015) examined Ohio births (349,188 live births, 1,848 still births) within 10 km of an air monitoring station and found that high levels of exposure to PM2.5 (≥mean PM2.5 + IQR range) were associated with stillbirth in the third trimester (OR=1.42, 95% CI 1.06–1.91), with the association stronger for births within a 5-km radius (OR=1.54, 95% CI 1.08–2.20); however, no significant associations were found for the first or second trimesters or estimates when PM2.5 was analyzed as a continuous variable. A case-control study (9,325 cases and 93,250 controls) in Taiwan found that the risk of stillbirth was only associated with first-trimester PM10 exposure among preterm births (OR=1.03, 95% CI 1.0–1.07) after controlling for other pollutants (Hwang et al., 2011). Black smoke (PM <4 μg/m3) exposure during any trimester of pregnancy, which was studied by Pearce et al. (2010) among 812 stillbirths and 90,537 live births in the United Kingdom, was not associated with stillbirth. One study of cause-specific stillbirths (n=5,377) in California found no association between PM2.5 total mass and congenital malformations, fetal disorders, or maternal complications; however, PM2.5 was significantly associated with stillbirths caused by fetal growth (OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.06–1.44) and obstetric complications (OR=1.13, 95% CI 1.03–1.24), although not for those caused by maternal complications, congenital malformations, or fetal disorders (Ebisu et al., 2018).\n\nIn a study of 385 infant deaths before the age of 1 year among 465,682 births in Massachusetts, no association was found between PM2.5 throughout gestation or in each trimester and respiratory death, sudden infant death syndrome, or all causes of death (Son et al., 2017).\n\nAnimal Studies\n\nIn EPA’s review of PM (EPA, 2009), toxicological evidence supported an association between PM and adverse reproductive outcomes. However, there were few data on biological plausibility to explain the link between PM exposure and reproductive outcomes, although systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were implicated. The Volume 11 committee identified several animal studies that examined PM exposure and reproductive effects that have appeared since the 2009 EPA review. These studies provide some additional mechanistic information and are discussed below.\n\nCao et al. (2015) showed decreased fertility (reduced sperm count, increased rates of sperm abnormalities, and testicular damage by histomorphology) with evidence of oxidative stress mediated by the PI3K/Akt pathway in male rats exposed to PM2.5. An additional study by Cao et al. (2017) indicated that PM2.5 causes reproductive injury by compromising the blood–testes barrier integrity in such a way that affects mating success, sperm parameters, epididymal morphology, the expression of markers of spermatogenesis, superoxide dismutase levels in testes, and the expression of blood–testes barrier junction proteins. Similarly, Liu et al. (2017a) showed that PM2.5, particularly in the winter time, adversely affects sperm motility, sperm malformations, testicular tissue injury, and testicular apoptosis—effects believed to be induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress.\n\nReduced gestational length and birth weight were reported by Blum et al. (2017) in mice exposed to ambient PM2.5 throughout gestation (6h/day on gestational day [GD] 0.5–16.5). This period aligns with milestones in human development.\n\nAn in vitro study found that cytotoxicity and genotoxicity differed by the size of the PM (<0.49, 0.49–0.97, 0.97–3 and >3 μm), with the smallest particles having the greatest bioactivity (Velali et al., 2016). Another in vitro study found that the chemical constituents bound to ambient PM, particularly PAHs, affected the cytotoxicity of PM in JEG-3 human placental cells (van Drooge et al., 2017). The PAHs were associated with the burning of biomass in rural areas.\n\nDevelopmental Effects\n\nThe Volume 11 committee considered a wide spectrum of developmental effects that are evident in infants at or after birth and in children as they continue to develop. This section includes any developmental outcomes in infants and children, including birth defects, childhood cancer, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), neurodevelopment and behavioral outcomes, and respiratory effects, in relation to parental preconception or prenatal exposures that were reported in the literature. No studies of outcomes in adult offspring were identified by the committee.\n\nBirth Defects\n\nA number of studies have investigated the associations between in utero exposure to PM and congenital anomalies, with heterogeneous findings (Chen et al., 2014; Vrijheid et al., 2011). Because of the wealth of data on PM exposures and birth defects, the text below summarizes the results of epidemiologic studies; the details about these studies (design, population, and exposures and outcomes) are summarized in Table 6-2.\n\nAmong studies that reported on congenital anomalies, two conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Chen et al., 2014; Vrijheid et al., 2011). Vrijheid et al. (2011) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 studies of congenital anomalies and air pollution published between 2002 and 2011. The authors reported an elevated summary estimate for atrial septal defects (OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.28) with continuous exposure to PM10, but the association was not significant in a binary analysis comparing high- to low-exposure groups (OR=1.23, 95% CI 0.91–1.67). Other defects (ventricular septal defects, coarctation of the aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot) were not associated with PM10 exposure. A second systematic review and meta-analysis by Chen et al. (2014) of 17 studies published between 2011 and 2014 found no significant association between any congenital anomaly and PM10.\n\nThe committee reviewed 25 publications from 22 individual studies that investigated associations between PM exposure and congenital anomalies, particularly congenital heart defects. Most studies examined exposure to PM10, used registries of birth defects, and were large population-based, case-control studies from countries around the world—China (4), Spain, Australia, Israel (2), Italy, Taiwan, and England (4)—as well as from several states in the United States (California [4], Massachusetts, New Jersey, Texas, and North Carolina) and the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) (3). Exposures were modeled on the basis of residential distance to air monitors or roadways, or on land use. Many studies controlled for other risk factors such as SES, maternal smoking, and alcohol use; none of the studies assessed any paternal or occupational exposures. All the studies examined exposure in the first trimester, generally weeks 2 or 3 to week 8 of gestation. Two studies examined preconception exposures (Yao et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2015b). The results of the studies are briefly summarized below, and the details of the location, study population and size, and other characteristics are presented in Table 6-2.\n\nAmong studies that examined PM in association with any birth defect, no increase was reported with PM2.5, PM10, or black smoke in the first trimester (Liang et al., 2014; Rankin et al., 2009; Schembari et al., 2014). Yao et al. (2016) examined the relationship between 398 children with birth defects among 16,332 births in Anqing City, China, and PM10 exposure during preconception and in the first, second, and third trimesters and found no associations. However, Liang et al. (2014) reported that birth defects in Hainan province, China (509 birth defects and 63,391 controls), were associated with PM10 exposure in the second and third trimesters (second-trimester OR=1.039, 95% CI 1.016–1.063; third-trimester OR=1.066, 95% CI 1.043–1.090).\n\nCongenital heart defects were the most widely studied group of congenital anomalies, but the results were not consistent across studies. PM10 exposure throughout pregnancy was associated with significantly increased risks of all congenital heart defects (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.0–1.14) (Farhi et al., 2014), ventricular septal defects (OR=1.18, 95% CI 1.01–1.39) (Farhi et al., 2014), and atrial septal defects (OR=2.52, 95% CI 1.44–4.42) (Hwang et al., 2015). Exposure to PM10 in the first 3 to 8 weeks of pregnancy was associated with multiple congenital heart defects (OR=1.05, 95% CI 1.01–1.10) (Agay-Shay et al., 2013). Another study that examined 10-day intervals in early pregnancy found significant increased risks of ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects, and patent ductus arteriosus with the second quartile of PM10 exposure, but not the third or fourth quartiles, for days 31–40 and 41–50 (ORs ranging from 1.19 to 2.17) (Liu et al., 2017b), indicating that the response was not monotonic. Other studies reported no significantly increased risk of these outcomes in association with PM10 (Agay-Shay et al., 2013; Dadvand et al., 2011a; Gianicolo et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2009; Hwang et al., 2015; Padula et al., 2013b; Schembari et al., 2014; Stingone et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016) or a significantly reduced risk of ventricular septal defects with exposure in the first 3 to 8 weeks of pregnancy (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.97; Schembari et al., 2014). Thus, the Volume 11 committee found the results to be mixed, and no clear explanation for these increases could be derived from the reports.\n\nFor PM2.5, seven studies reported no increased risk for any congenital heart defect or for most of the specific heart defects examined (Agay-Shay et al., 2013; Girguis et al., 2016; Padula et al., 2013b; Schembari et al., 2014; Stingone et al., 2014; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2013, 2015; Warren et al., 2016). However, PM2.5 exposure was associated with increased risks of certain specific defects: namely, dextro-transposition of the great arteries with first-trimester exposure (3rd quartile of exposure OR=2.6, 95% CI 1.1–6.5) (Padula et al., 2013b), pulmonary valve stenosis with exposure on day 53 of gestation, and tetralogy of Fallot on days 50–51 of gestation (estimates not reported) (Warren, et al., 2016). PM2.5 exposure in the first 3 to 8 weeks of gestation was associated with reduced risks for ventricular septal defects (OR=0.83, 95% CI 0.72–0.97) (Schembari et al., 2014), septal heart defects (OR=0.79, 95% CI 0.76–0.83) (Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2015), obstructive heart defects (OR=0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.98) (Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2015), and patent ductus arteriosus (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.68–0.91) (Agay-Shay et al., 2013). Two studies found that exposure to black smoke was not associated with significant risk of congenial heart defects (Dadvand et al., 2011b; Rankin et al., 2009). Together this mixed evidence suggests that additional work on the risk of prenatal exposure PM for heart defects is needed.\n\nMany studies investigated the associations between orofacial clefts and PM2.5 or PM10, and most found no significantly elevated risks (Farhi et al., 2014; Girguis et al., 2016; Hansen et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2010; Padula et al., 2013a; Rankin et al., 2009; Schembari et al., 2014; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2013, 2015). Two studies noted an association between PM and cleft palate but not cleft lip with or without cleft palate during certain windows of development. Zhou et al. (2017) reported an OR=1.43 (95% CI 1.11–1.86) per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 between 5 and 10 weeks of gestation among 2,609 cases and more than 4 million control births in the NBDPS. In a study of 159 cases and 188,102 live birth controls in the Consortium on Safe Labor cohort in the United States, Zhu et al. (2015b) observed an association\n\nbetween cleft palate only and PM2.5 exposure in the first 3 to 8 weeks of gestation (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.15–2.64), but the association did not extend to exposure to PM2.5 in the 3 months before conception. Conversely, Hansen et al. (2009) reported a reduced risk of cleft palate with PM10 exposure in the first 3 to 8 weeks of gestation (OR=0.69, 95% CI 0.50–0.93) among 145 cases and 150,308 controls in Brisbane, Australia. Yao et al. (2016) found no elevated risk of cleft palate or cleft lip with PM10 exposure in the 3 months before pregnancy among 16,332 births in Anqing City, China.\n\nNo increased risk of neural tube defects in association with PM has been reported for the U.S. general population. One study in California reported an interaction between PM10 and socioeconomic factors for the risk of spina bifida, with the risk elevated among people with low income and low education (Padula et al., 2015). Other studies have reported null findings for PM exposure and neural tube defects (Dolk et al., 2010; Girguis et al., 2016; Padula et al., 2013a; Schembari et al., 2014; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2013, 2015).\n\nTwo studies examined chromosomal defects (specifically, trisomy 21, the cause of Down syndrome) in association with PM10. Farhi et al. (2014) found an increased risk in the first trimester (OR=1.14, 95% CI 1.01–1.28), whereas Dolk et al. (2010) did not. No obvious difference between the two studies has been identified.\n\nLong lists of other congenital anomalies have been studied, with no significant effects reported in more than one study. Increased risks have been reported for abdominal wall defects with both PM10 and PM2.5 in the first 3 to 8 weeks of gestation (PM2.5 OR=1.33, 95% CI 1.0–1.76 and PM10 OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.14–1.62) (Schembari et al., 2014); esophageal atresia with quartiles of ambient PM10 concentration in the first trimester (2nd quartile OR=4.1, 95% CI 1.2–14.8; 3rd quartile OR=3.9, 95% CI 1.1–14.0; 4th quartile OR=4.9, 95% CI 1.4–17.2) (Padula et al., 2013c); nervous system anomalies with black smoke in the first trimester (OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.03–1.18) (Rankin et al., 2009); and omphalocele (a gastrointestinal defect) with PM10 exposure (RR=2.17, 95% CI 1.0–4.71) (Dolk et al., 2010). Padula et al. (2013c) reported decreased risks of hydrocephaly for specific quartiles of both PM2.5 and PM10 exposure in the first trimester: PM2.5 2nd quartile OR=0.2 (95% CI 0.1–0.7) and PM10 4th quartile OR=0.3 (95% CI 0.1–0.9). Also, a negative association (OR=0.78, 95% CI 0.64–0.96) between craniosynostosis and PM2.5 exposure in the first 3 to 8 weeks of gestation was reported by Vinikoor-Imler et al. (2015). Other studies reported no significant associations for these outcomes and others with exposure to PM10 (Dolk et al., 2010; Farhi et al., 2014; Padula et al., 2013a,c; Schembari et al., 2014; Yao et al., 2016) and PM2.5 (Padula et al., 2013a; Schembari et al., 2014; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2013, 2015). Yao et al. (2016) investigated a range of birth defects with exposure to PM10 in the 3 months before conception and found no significant effects.\n\nChildhood Cancer\n\nThree studies assessed the associations between childhood cancer and prenatal exposures to PM (Badaloni et al., 2013; Heck et al., 2013b; Lavigne et al., 2017). Badaloni et al. (2013) found no association between childhood leukemia and exposure to PM2.5 or PM10 in an Italian case-control study of 620 cases and 957 controls. Heck et al. (2013b) examined 3,590 cases of childhood cancer from the California Cancer Registry and compared them with 80,224 health children born in California and found no relationship between IQR increases in PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), ependymoma, astrocytoma, intracranial and intraspinal embryonal tumors, medulloblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms’ tumor, or hepatoblastoma in children under 6 years of age.\n\nAnother large registry-based study in a population of 2,350,898 children born in Ontario, Canada, also found no significant association between IQR increases in PM2.5 during pregnancy and ALL, AML, NHL, ependymoma, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, PNET, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms’ tumor, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or germ cell tumor. However, a significant association with astrocytoma was reported for exposure in the first trimester and throughout the entire pregnancy (first-trimester hazard ratio [HR]=1.40, 95% CI 1.0– –1.86; second-trimester HR=1.26, 95% CI 0.95–1.67; third-trimester HR=0.96, 95% CI 0.71–1.28; entire pregnancy HR=1.35, 95% CI 1.0–1.85; first-year HR=1.07, 95% CI 0.79–1.28) (Lavigne et al., 2017).\n\nNeurodevelopmental Outcomes\n\nIn recent years, many publications have described studies of neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children exposed to various air pollutants, many of which have focused on ASDs. Therefore, the committee discussed the literature on ASD together, followed by studies that examined other neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as measures or scores to quantify the effects on intelligence quotient (IQ), cognition, motor skills, attention, memory, and behavior.\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorders Nine studies examined ASDs in association with prenatal PM exposure (Becerra et al., 2013; Gong et al., 2014, 2017; Guxens et al., 2016; Kalkbrenner et al., 2015; Kerin et al., 2018; Raz et al., 2015; Talbott et al., 2015; Volk et al., 2013). Three of these studies considered preconception exposure (Kalkbrenner et al., 2015; Raz et al., 2015; Talbott et al., 2015).\n\nBecerra et al. (2013) conducted a large population-based case-control study in Los Angeles County with 7,603 cases of children with a primary diagnosis of autistic disorder and 76,030 controls. No significant effects were reported in single-pollutant models, but increased risks were found for PM after controlling for NO2 exposure throughout the entire pregnancy per IQR increases (PM2.5 OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.01–1.12; PM10 OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.03–1.13). Trimester-specific estimates were inconsistent. Kerin et al. (2018) studied the severity and functioning of 327 children with ASD in California and found that PM10 and PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was not associated with greater severity or decreased functioning.\n\nGong et al. (2017) conducted a large population-based case-control study (5,136 cases and 18,237 controls) in Sweden and found no association between PM10 exposure during pregnancy and ASD, either with or without intellectual disabilities. Another study by the same investigators examined ASD and attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 9 to 12 years of age among 3,426 Swedish twins and found no associations with PM10 exposure during pregnancy, the first year, or the ninth years of life (Gong et al., 2014). Guxens et al. (2016) analyzed four European cohorts totaling 8,079 children and found no association between borderline or clinical ASD and prenatal exposure to PM2.5 or PM10.\n\nKalkbrenner et al. (2015) examined the risk of ASD in 979 cases and 14,666 controls from North Carolina and San Francisco versus PM10 exposure starting 80 days before conception through the child’s first birthday. The only significantly elevated window of exposure was the third trimester (OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.13–1.63), and this association remained significant after further adjustment for covariates, but only among cases and controls in North Carolina, not San Francisco. No explanation for the site differences was presented. Preconception exposure was not associated with ASD (OR=0.94, 95% CI 0.82–1.08). Raz et al. (2015) conducted a nested case-control study of 245 cases and 1,522 controls using the Nurses’ Health Study II cohort to look for associations between ASD and exposures to PM2.5 and PM10–2.5. No significant association with PM10–2.5 exposure was found, but ASD was found to be related to IQR changes in PM2.5 exposure in all three trimesters (first-trimester OR=1.23, 95% CI 1.01–1.49; second-trimester OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.05–1.54; third-trimester OR=1.49, 95% CI 1.20–1.85). When\n\ncomparing exposures during the 9 months before pregnancy, during pregnancy, and after pregnancy, the authors found that exposures to PM2.5 during the preconception period or during the postnatal period were not related to ASD.\n\nTalbott et al. (2015) reported a case-control study of 217 cases and 226 controls in Pennsylvania that assessed PM2.5 exposure from preconception through the second year of life. They found elevated, but not significant, risks for ASD per IQR changes for windows of exposure that reflected preconception through the first year of life (ORs ranged from 1.07 to 1.37), but only exposures in the second year of life were significantly associated with ASD (OR=1.45, 95% CI 1.01–2.08).\n\nAll of the studies described above measured exposure based on maternal residence at birth, except Volk et al. (2013), who collected data on the place of residence beginning 3 months before pregnancy until the time of assessment in order to account for residential mobility and better examine risk by trimester. In the study of 279 cases with full syndrome autism in California compared to 245 children with typical development, increased risks of autism were associated with elevated PM throughout pregnancy and the first year of life (PM2.5 per 8.7 μg/m3 increase: first-trimester OR=1.22. 95% CI 0.96–1.53; second-trimester OR=1.48, 95% CI 1.40–1.57; third-trimester OR=1.40, 95% CI 1.11–1.77; first-year OR=2.12, 95% CI 1.45–3.10; and PM10 per 14.6 μg/m3 increase: first-trimester OR=1.44, 95% CI 1.07–1.96; second-trimester OR=1.83, 95% CI 1.35–2.47; third-trimester OR=1.61, 95% CI 1.20–2.14; first-year OR=2.14, 95% CI 1.46–3.12). Volk et al. (2013) used two approaches to assigning exposure—regional air quality monitoring data and dispersion modeling—and found elevated risks with both approaches.\n\nOf the three studies that considered preconception exposure, none reported an increased risk of ASD in association with PM2.5 or PM10 (Kalkbrenner et al., 2015; Raz et al., 2015; Talbott et al., 2015).\n\nA meta-analysis of the studies summarized above reported a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies (Flores-Pajot et al., 2016). Still, the authors concluded that PM2.5 in the first trimester and in the postnatal period was significantly associated with ASD, although prenatal PM10 exposure was not. Pooled estimates for PM2.5 and PM10 for each window of exposure are reported in Table 6-3, derived from Flores-Pajot et al. (2016). A systematic review by Suades-Gonzalez et al. (2015) found an association between prenatal and postnatal PM2.5 exposure and ASD based on several high-quality studies. The significant impact of postnatal exposure on later ASD development is an important consideration when weighing the evidence on prenatal exposures.\n\nTABLE 6-3 Pooled Estimates (95% CI) for Risk of Autism per 10 μg/m3 Increases in PM2.5 or PM10 Exposure\n\nWindow of Exposure OR PM2.5 (95% CI) P-Value for Heterogeneity OR PM10 (95% CI) P-Value for Heterogeneity Entire pregnancy 1.34 (0.83–2.17)* 0.000 1.03 (0.77–1.37)* 0.003 1st trimester 1.10 (1.02–1.19) 0.717 1.01 (0.86–1.20)* 0.008 2nd trimester 1.21 (0.88–1.66)* 0.000 1.12 (0.90–1.40)* 0.001 3rd trimester 1.33 (0.99–1.77)* 0.022 1.23 (0.97–1.55)* 0.000 Postnatal (1–4 yrs) 2.43 (1.61–3.68) 0.723 1.33 (0.86–2.05)* 0.002\n\nNOTE: A significant p value for heterogeneity (*p<0.05) indicates the presence of heterogeneity among the studies in the meta-analysis.\n\nSOURCE: Flores-Pajot et al., 2016.\n\nOther Neurodevelopmental Outcomes The committee identified nine studies that reported on associations between exposure to PM and a variety of neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes (Chiu et al., 2016; Eenhuizen et al., 2013; Guxens et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2014; Lertxundi et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2014; Stingone et al., 2016; Yorifuji et al., 2016). This section focuses on all neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes other than ASD. A systematic review by Suades-Gonzalez et al. (2015) evaluated 16 studies on PM and neuropsychological development and concluded that there was insufficient evidence of associations with cognitive and psychomotor development.\n\nLertxundi et al. (2015) studied cognitive and psychomotor development in 438 15-month-old Spanish children and found that reductions in motor scale scores were significantly associated with 1 μg/m3 increases in PM2.5 throughout pregnancy (β= –1.15, 95% CI –1.76– –0.54), but there was no association with mental-scale scores after adjustment for confounders and NO2 exposure. No adjustments were made for postnatal exposures, but results stratified by residential distance to metal processing plants showed significant relationships. Guxens et al. (2014) examined cognitive and psychomotor development among 1- to 6-year-olds in six European birth cohorts (n=9,482) and found no relationship between prenatal PM2.5, PM10, or PM10–2.5 exposure and either cognitive or psychomotor development.\n\nKim et al. (2014) conducted a cohort study (n=520) of cognitive and psychomotor development in South Korea. Using a general linear model, they found that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 was significantly associated with decreased cognitive scores (β= –4.60, 95% CI –6.71– –2.49) and psychomotor scores (β= –7.24, 95% CI –9.79– –4.69) at 6 months, but not at 12 or 24 months. General estimating equations showed significant associations for both measures across 6 to 24 months of age (cognitive β= –2.83, 95% CI –4.71– –0.94; psychomotor β= –3.00, 95% CI –4.86– –1.14). Lin et al. (2014) conducted a cohort study of 533 Taiwanese children exposed to PM10 throughout pregnancy and up to 18 months of age and found that prenatal PM10 exposure was not associated with gross motor, fine motor, language, or social-personal scores at 6 and 18 months of age.\n\nYorifuji et al. (2016) examined motor and verbal developmental milestones in 2.5-year-olds and behavioral milestones in 5.5-year-olds in Japan in association with PM (<7 μm) exposure estimated for the entire pregnancy (n=46,039). Parents responded to questions about their children’s attention, self-regulation, and socially appropriate behavior as part of the national Longitudinal Survey of Babies in the 21st Century. Exposure in the 9 months before conception was adjusted for using regression models, but no adjustments were made for any exposures after birth. While no significant associations were found for milestones at age 2.5, there were several significant associations with 5.5-year milestones per IQR increases in prenatal PM (inability to listen without fidgeting OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.04–1.17; inability to focus on one task OR=1.06, 95% CI 1.00–1.13; inability to express emotions OR=1.10, 95% CI 1.05–1.16; and inability to keep promises OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.14).\n\nChiu et al. (2016) reported on IQ, attention, and memory in a cohort of 267 children (average age 6.5 yrs) in Boston and found differences between specific prenatal windows of exposure by sex. Children were administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)-IV, the Conners’ Continuous Performance Test-II, and the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, 2nd Edition. While PM2.5 was not associated with these outcomes overall, among the boys significant associations were found between PM2.5 and lower IQ scores at 31–38 weeks of age, errors of omission at 20–26 weeks, slower reaction time at 32–36 weeks, and variability in response time at 22–40 weeks. Significant associations with PM2.5 among girls included decreased visual memory index at 18–26 weeks, decreased attention/concentration index at 8–18 weeks, and decreased general memory index scores at 12–20 weeks.\n\nHarris et al. (2016) conducted a cohort study (Project Viva in Massachusetts) and reported on executive functioning and behavioral problems in 1,212 children around 8 years old in relation to PM2.5 and\n\nblack carbon exposures estimated for the third trimester, first 3 years, and first 6 years of life. Although some problems were associated with mid-childhood exposure, no executive functioning or behavioral problems were associated with prenatal exposure.\n\nImmune Outcomes\n\nThe association between exposure to PM and eczema in children was studied by Jedrychowski et al. (2011a,b) and Lu et al. (2017), while Orione et al. (2014) examined juvenile dermatomyositis, an autoimmune disease.\n\nJedrychowski et al. (2011a,b) used personal monitors to measure PM2.5 for 2 days in the second trimester of pregnancy. The risk of infantile eczema in a cohort of 469 Polish children was associated with a variety of risk factors (Jedrychowski et al., 2011a). While prenatal PM2.5 exposure alone was not significantly associated with eczema, elevated risks were reported among children exposed to high levels of PM2.5 and environmental tobacco smoke. In a follow-up study of 322 children through age 5, prenatal PM2.5 exposure alone was not associated with eczema, but when combined with maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy, the risk of eczema symptoms doubled (HR=2.7, 95% CI 1.01–4.34) (Jedrychowski et al., 2011b).\n\nLu et al. (2017) reported on eczema in a cohort of 2,598 Chinese children ages 3 to 6 years and found no association with PM10 exposure in the 6 months before pregnancy or at any time in the prenatal period. Exposure measures for both mother and father in the 6 months before pregnancy were calculated based on air pollution monitoring results for the time period of interest, but they were not related to parental reports of eczema on their children.\n\nOrione et al. (2014) conducted a small case-control study of 20 cases of juvenile dermatomyositis and 56 controls in Brazil to identify environmental risk factors, including those experienced during the prenatal period. There was no association between prenatal PM10 exposure and a diagnosis of juvenile dermatomyositis.\n\nAsthma and Other Respiratory Outcomes\n\nThe Volume 11 committee considered 16 studies of PM and respiratory outcomes in children, most of which predominantly focused on asthma, but there were also explorations of wheeze, allergy, and lung function. Asthma was assessed in five cohort studies (Clark et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2015, 2016; Hsu et al., 2015; Tetreault et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016) and one cross-sectional study (Liu et al., 2016b). Positive associations between prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and asthma were reported in three of the cohort studies (Clark et al., 2010; Hsu et al., 2015; Tetreault et al., 2016), and one of those reported an association with PM10 (Clark et al., 2010), although two did not observe an association between PM10 and asthma (Deng et al., 2015, 2016; Liu et al., 2016b). One meta-analysis examined prenatal exposure to pollutants and asthma or wheezing in children up to 14 years old and found no association between prenatal PM2.5 exposures and either outcome. However, the pooled estimate for PM10 was significant for childhood asthma (OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.05–1.12) (Hehua et al., 2017).\n\nHsu et al. (2015) studied a cohort of 736 children in Boston and found that prenatal PM2.5 exposure between 16 and 25 weeks of gestation was associated with a diagnosis of asthma in boys up to age 6, but not in girls. There was a significant difference between the sexes and a significant interaction between prenatal PM2.5 exposure and sex (p=0.01; ORs not reported). The sex differences were not explained.\n\nTetreault et al. (2016) reported a significant association between time-varying prenatal PM2.5 exposure and diagnosed asthma in children up to 12 years of age (per IQR increase HR=1.33, 95% CI\n\n1.31–1.34). This large cohort of more than 1 million children in Quebec included 162,752 cases of diagnosed asthma. A subgroup analysis indirectly adjusted for secondhand smoke and found a much smaller effect of PM2.5 (per IQR, HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.02–1.06).\n\nClark et al. (2010) examined the incidence of asthma in 37,401 children ages 3–4 years in British Columbia in association with PM2.5, PM10, and black carbon. Two methods were used to estimate prenatal exposures. Regulatory air monitoring data and land use regression models for temporal variability were used to estimate individual exposures. PM2.5 was significantly associated with asthma incidence (per 1 μg/m3 increase, OR=1.02, 95% CI 1.0–1.03), as was black carbon (per 10–5/m increase in filter absorbance, OR=1.08, 95% CI 1.02–1.15); PM10 was not analyzed. Exposure, as determined by the inverse distance-weight summation of emissions from point sources, showed no association between PM2.5 and asthma incidence (per 1 μg/m3 increase, OR=0.95, 95% CI 0.91–1.0), but there was a significant association with PM10 (per 1 μg/m3 increase, OR=1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.13); black smoke was not analyzed using this model.\n\nYang et al. (2016) studied 3,701 Dutch children through age 14. Those investigators found that exposure to PM2.5 estimated at the time of birth using a land use regression model was not associated with asthma or asthma symptoms in childhood.\n\nIn China, Deng et al. (2015, 2016) reported no association between prenatal PM10 exposure and asthma among 2,490 children ages 3 to 6 years. A separate Chinese cross-sectional study by Liu et al. (2016b) also found no association between asthma in 4- to 8-year-old children and prenatal PM10 exposure (n=3,358).\n\nYang et al. (2016) , Liu et al. (2016b), and Deng et al. (2015, 2016) also assessed respiratory allergy. Yang et al. did not find any relationship between PM2.5 concentrations at a child’s birth address and hay fever, rhinitis, or allergic sensitization in a cohort of Dutch children up to 14 years old. Liu et al. (2016b) found no association between allergic rhinitis and prenatal PM10 exposure in Chinese children who were around 5 years old. Deng et al. (2015) reported no association between prenatal PM10 and allergic rhinitis or eczema throughout pregnancy or in any specific trimester among Chinese children ages 3–6 years old (Deng et al., 2016).\n\nChiu et al. (2014) reported significant associations between repeated wheezing among 708 Boston children up to 2 years of age and high prenatal exposure to PM2.5 and black carbon versus low exposure to these two pollutants (PM2.5 OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.20–3.40; black carbon OR=1.84, 95% CI 1.08–3.12). These investigators also reported that psychosocial stressors such as community violence were important contributors to the occurrence of wheezing. Jedrychowski et al. (2010b) found a significant effect of prenatal PM2.5 exposure on wheezing at 2 years of age (high versus low IRR=1.377, 95% CI 1.252–1.514) but not at 4 years of age (high versus low IRR=1.063, 95% CI 0.923–1.223) among a cohort of 339 Polish children. Exposures were determined by mothers using personal monitors for 2 days in the second trimester. Rosa et al. (2017a) studied wheezing in 552 children in Mexico City in association with prenatal PM2.5 exposure and maternal stress and found a significant interaction. PM2.5 exposure in the first trimester was associated with the risk of current wheezing in children in the presence of high maternal stress (per IQR increase RR=1.35, 95% CI 1.00–1.83), but not in the case of low maternal stress. No associations were noted for other trimesters.\n\nRespiratory system infections were examined in four studies. Liu et al. (2016b) found no association between pneumonia in 4- to 8-year-old Chinese children and prenatal PM10 exposure. MacIntyre et al. (2014) conducted a meta-analysis of 16,059 children from 10 European cohorts (ESCAPE project) and found significant associations between pneumonia in the first 2 years of life and PM10 (per 10 μg/m3 increases, OR=1.76, 95% CI 1.00–3.09) and PM2.5–10 (OR=1.24, 95% CI 1.03–1.5), but not for PM2.5. No associations between PM and croup or otitis media were found. In a study of 1,617 children ages 3–4\n\nyears in Changsha, China, prenatal PM10 exposure was found to have no association with otitis media (Deng et al., 2017). Recurrent broncho-pulmonary infections (≥5 episodes) in 214 children through age 7 were associated with prenatal PM2.5 exposure (OR=2.08, 95% CI 1.08–4.06) (Jedrychowski et al., 2013). Exposures were determined by mothers using personal monitors for 2 days in the second trimester.\n\nLung function was reported on by six studies. Liu et al. (2016b) found no association between prenatal PM10 exposure and lung function in 4- to 8-year-old Chinese children (n=3,358). Gehring et al. (2013) analyzed the lung function of children age 6 or 8 years from five European cohorts and found no association with PM2.5, PM10, or PM10–2.5 at the birth address (n=5,921).\n\nAmong healthy 5-week-old newborns in Switzerland (n=265), Latzin et al. (2009) found that maternal exposure to PM10 during pregnancy had affected tidal breathing (minute ventilation β=24.9, 95% CI 9.3–0.5), but not multiple breath washout or inflammatory markers; no effect was found for postnatal exposure. Jedyrchowski et al. (2010a) reported decrements in lung function in a cohort of 176 Polish children with maternal personal monitoring conducted in the second trimester. Lung function was significantly reduced at 5 years of age among children exposed prenatally to the highest quartile (>52.6 μg/m3) compared to the lowest quartile of PM2.5 (FVC β= –91.92, 95% CI –159.60– –24.24; and FEV1 β= –87.71, 95% CI –151.85– –23.57). Although there was a step-wise trend across the quartiles, the lung function of children in the second- and third-exposure quartiles were not significantly lower than in the first quartile.\n\nPrenatal exposure to PM10 reduced respiratory function in 232 children with asthma ages 6–11 years in the San Joaquin Valley. Notably, the subgroups most affected by prenatal exposure to pollutants were children who were African American, diagnosed before age 2, and exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy (Mortimer et al., 2008).\n\nOther Outcomes Studied in Children\n\nSingle studies have reported on vitamin D levels, metabolic function, body weight, and pubertal development in children with prenatal exposure to PM.\n\nIn a French birth cohort of 370 pregnant women (EDEN study), Baiz et al. (2012) found that decreased vitamin D levels in cord blood were associated with maternal exposure to PM10 in the first trimester (10 μg/m3 PM10; β= –0.35, 95% CI –0.78– –0.03) and in the third trimester (β= –0.43, 95% CI –0.72– –0.14). In a Canadian cohort (MIREC) study of 1,257 mother–child pairs, researchers examined the correlation of maternal PM2.5 exposure with the levels of leptin and adiponectic—two measures of metabolic function—in cord blood (Lavigne et al., 2016). IQR increases of 3.2 μg/m3 in PM2.5 exposure throughout pregnancy were associated with increased adiponectin levels (β=11%, 95% CI 4–17%) and leptin levels (β=11%, 95% CI 1–21%); however, when birth weight was included in the adjustments, the increases in leptin levels ceased to be significant, although the increases in apiponectin levels retained significance.\n\nKim et al. (2016) studied changes in body weight measured from birth to age 5 in relation to prenatal PM10 exposure in 1,129 South Korean children. They did not find a relationship between prenatal PM10 exposure and changes in weight-for-age. However, a significant association was found in Bangladeshi children under 5 years old between the second, third, and fourth quartiles of mean PM2.5 exposure throughout pregnancy and stunting, wasting, and underweight (RRs ranged from 1.109 to 1.272). Exposures after birth were not significantly related to the outcomes studied (Goyal and Canning, 2017).\n\nA few studies have reported increases in markers of obesity with PM exposure. A study of 239 children about 4 years old in the Boston area reported increased anthropometric measures associated with prenatal PM2.5 exposure estimated weekly. In boys, increased PM2.5 during gestational weeks 8–17 was\n\nsignificantly associated with increased BMI z-scores, and PM2.5 in weeks 15–22 was significantly associated with fat mass. In girls, increased waist-to-hip ratio was significantly associated with increased PM2.5 in gestational weeks 10–29 (relative risks not reported) (Chiu et al., 2017). Mao et al. (2017) reported increased risks of childhood overweight or obesity among 1,446 children ages 2–9 years in the Boston area as a function of PM2.5 in each trimester (per IQR increases RR=1.1, 95% CI 1.0–1.2 for each trimester). Significant associations were also reported for exposure in the prenatal period (per IQR increase RR=1.1, 95% CI 1.0–1.2) and the first 2 years of life (per IQR increase RR=1.1, 95% CI 1.0–1.2).\n\nThiering et al. (2013) examined the relationship between estimated PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at the mother’s residential address and insulin resistance in children at age 10 in two German birth cohorts (n=397). A two-standard-deviation increase in PM10 was associated with a 17.5% increase in insulin resistance (95% CI 1.9–35.6).\n\nIn a study of 4,074 children about 11 years old in Hong Kong, China, prenatal PM10 exposure was significantly related to later pubertal development in girls (Tanner stage [a measure of puberty] mean difference= –0.05, 95% CI –0.08– –0.02), but no differences were noted in boys (Huang et al., 2017).\n\nAnimal Studies\n\nIn EPA’s 2009 review of PM, toxicological evidence was found to support an association between PM and adverse developmental outcomes. However, there were few data on biological plausibility to explain the link between PM exposure and developmental outcomes, although developmental windows of susceptibility and systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were implicated. The Volume 11 committee identified a few animal studies published since that 2009 review that examined PM exposure and developmental or generational effects.\n\nTang et al. (2017) found decreased lung volume parameters, compliance, and airflow on expiration and also lung damage related to oxidative stress in rat pups on postnatal day 28 after in utero exposure to PM2.5 (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, or 7.5 mg/kg once every 3 days from GD 0–18).\n\nIn rats exposed in utero to PM2.5 (0.375, 1.5, or 6.0 mg/kg on GD 10, 12, 14, and 16) researchers found various signs of cardiotoxicity, including a disordered arrangement of myocardial fibers, irregular-shaped cardiomyocytes, increased apoptotic rates in myocardium, and altered expression of mitochondrial fusion/fissure genes (Wang et al., 2017b). The exposure of pregnant rats to PM2.5 at levels corresponding to ambient levels in an urban Chinese environment for 24 hours per day throughout gestation and lactation resulted in changes related to cardiac development in the offspring. PM2.5 was associated with reduced levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and the proteins associated with cardiac precursor cells and cardiac development (GATA4 and Nkx2-5) and increased levels of TNF-α and IL-1β (inflammatory cytokines) in plasma, and it exacerbated the negative effects of homocysteine on cardiac development (myocardial apoptosis and structural abnormalities) (Chen et al., 2017a). Cardiac dysfunction was observed in adult rats after in utero exposure to PM2.5 (average 73.61 μg/m3 for 6 h/day throughout pregnancy), including an acute inflammatory response, chronic matrix remodeling, and an altered expression of Ca2+ handling proteins (Tanwar et al., 2017a). In mice, exposure to PM2.5 throughout gestation (average 91.78 μg/m3 for 6h/day, 5 days/week) resulted in adverse functional cardiac changes in early adolescence, including fractional shortening, impaired cardiomyocyte functioning, and reduced calcium transport amplitude and fluorescence decay rate. The authors stated that gestational exposure to PM2.5 alters calcium-handling proteins, which is responsible for the cardiac dysfunction observed in neonatal nice (Tanwar et al., 2017b).\n\nAn in vitro study found that cytotoxicity and genotoxicity differed by the size of PM (<0.49, 0.49–0.97, 0.97–3 and >3 μm), with the smallest particles having the greatest bioactivity (Velali et al.,\n\n2016). Another in vitro study emphasized the important role of chemical constituents on the cytotoxicity of PM in placental cells (van Drooge et al., 2017).\n\nEpigenetic and Other Effects on DNA\n\nStudies that focused on the genetic and epigenetic effects of prenatal PM exposure are summarized in Table 6-4. The section below provides an overview of the studies, and Table 6-4 provides additional study details, such as the tissue and cell type examined.\n\nThe epigenetic literature on PM has relied on relatively large sets of samples and studies, including ENVIRONAGE (Grevendonk et al., 2016; Janssen et al., 2012, 2013, 2015; Saenen et al., 2015, 2017; Wincklemans et al., 2017), the Children’s Health Study (Breton et al., 2016; Salam et al., 2012), PROGRESS (Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors) (Rosa et al., 2017b), and various consortiums and group studies (Pedersen et al., 2015; Silva da Silva et al., 2015). Three tissue types—cord blood, placenta, and peripheral blood lymphocytes—have generally been evaluated. These tissues represent a collection of different cell types, each with very different epigenomes, including different DNA methylation profiles. These studies of PM epigenetic effects have not accounted for the variability associated with heterogeneous cell types in samples. Differences in cell composition across different samples may result in what appear to be methylation differences but which actually are reflections of differences in cell purity or differences induced by immune responses (Houseman et al., 2012, 2015). Such complexities were interpreted by the Volume 11 committee to result in equivocal results.\n\nAnother challenge in interpreting results from these observational studies is that estimates of exposure are often confounded with other potential modifiers of the epigenome, as PM is frequently estimated longitudinally through source-distance models. Potential confounders, such as smoking or other environmental exposures that have been reported to be associated with altered DNA methylation (Jenkins et al., 2017; Knopik et al., 2012), are often not accounted for in these analyses, illustrating the complexity of the problem. Furthermore, the mutagenic activity of organic extracts from PM2.5 has been associated with increases in genomic DNA fragmentation (Silva da Silva et al., 2015) and higher DNA adduct levels as PM2.5 exposure increases (Pedersen et al., 2015).\n\nEffects that change with the developmental timing of the exposure have also been reported, as different tissues are susceptible in different developmental periods. For example, during the last month of pregnancy a 16.1% decrease in the placental DNA content of cord blood (95% CI –25.2– –6.0%, p=0.003) has been reported, but no such decrease in the mitochondrial DNA content (Janssen et al., 2012). In that particular study, PM2.5 exposure over the entire pregnancy was positively associated with mitochondrial DNA methylation (MT-RNR1: +0.91%, p=0.01 and D-loop: +0.21%, p=0.05), but the exposure was inversely associated with the mitochondrial DNA content (relative change of –15.60%, p=0.001) in placental tissue (Janssen et al., 2015). Others have measured levels of oxidative stress induced by PM10 and PM2.5, as measured by 8-hydroxy′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in mitochondria. Maternal PM10 and PM2.5 exposures are both associated with increased 8-OHdG through the entire pregnancy (18.3%, 95% CI 5.6–33.4%, p=0.004; and 13.9%, 95% CI 0.4–29.4%, p=0.04, respectively), which is heightened in the third trimester (28.1%, 95% CI 8.6–51.2%, p=0.004; and 28.1%, 95% CI 3.6–58.4%, p=0.004, respectively) (Grevendonk et al., 2016). An association between 8-OHdG in cord blood and PM10 was observed only in the first and second trimesters (23.0%, 95% CI 5.9–42.8%, p=0.007; and 16.6%, 95% CI 1.8–33.5%, p=0.03, respectively). The Volume 11 committee notes that those statistically significant results do not account for the presence of multiple comparisons, nor were any sensitivity analyses performed.\n\nIn principle, DNA methylation can also vary depending on temporal and spatial measurements. For example, global changes in genome methylation in placental tissue and PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy are correlated, particularly with first-trimester exposure. A multi-lag model found significant associations between lower levels of global DNA methylation and PM2.5 exposure in the first trimester (–2.13% per 5 μg/m3 increase, 95% CI –3.71– –0.54%, p=0.009), and exposure during implantation (6–21d) showed an even stronger association (–1.08% per 5 μg/m3 increase, 95% CI –1.80– –0.36%, p=0.004); both of them led to an increased hypomethylated state (Janssen et al., 2013). During the first trimester of pregnancy, each 5 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 was associated with a 15.9% decrease (95% CI –28.7– –3.2%, p=0.015) in the expression of placental brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) at birth and a 24.3% decrease (95% CI –42.8 – –5.8%, p=0.011) in synapsin-1 (Saenen et al., 2015), two genes involved in neurodevelopment. Using newborn blood spots, Breton et al. (2016) found that PM2.5 exposure during the first trimester was associated with a reduction in repetitive element methylation (i.e., LINE1, AluYb8). The degree of methylation was found to be genotype-dependent when 11 SNPs for DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT1), DNA methyltransferase 3 Beta (DNMT3B), Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) genes were assayed (Breton et al., 2016). Furthermore, differences in response have been reported with differences in the duration of exposure and infant sex. Wincklemans et al. (2017) reported differential gene expression to be associated with PM2.5 exposure—in particular, whether the exposure was short or long term (a month or a year before birth)—and also sex. For example, RNA expression reflecting DNA damage was altered in infants of both sexes with both short- and long-term exposure, whereas expression of RhoA pathways was affected in boys with short-term exposure, and defensin expression was altered in girls with long-term exposure.\n\nThe impacts of in utero PM exposure on gene expression in placenta have been studied in several populations (ENVIRONAGE, Rhode Island, and China) focusing on different genes. PM2.5 has been reported to affect the expression of LEP (leptin, an energy-regulating hormone) (Saenen et al., 2017), insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2), MEG3, MEST, and PLAG1 (all associated with infant birth weight); PM10 decreased the placental methylation of LINE1 (to represent global methylation) and increased the methylation of HSD11B2 (which encodes for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2, involved in glucocorticoid metabolism) (Cai et al., 2017).\n\nThese reports of changes in the methylation status of both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes, globally as well as at specific sites, in response to PM stress during pregnancy are intriguing and provide possible basis for the impact of PM on early development (Soto-Martinez and Sly, 2010; Teng et al., 2016). However, this body of evidence has several limitations, including small sample sizes and the heterogeneity of cell types, which affect both the reliability and the interpretation of the data. Biochemical mechanisms for how these exposures result in methylation changes have not been fully described, nor have these findings been confirmed in animals.\n\nAlthough some research has shown that PM has epigenetic effects, including DNA methylation and mitochondrial DNA methylation, the impacts of those changes on the health of children are not clear, and the understanding of the mechanisms is incomplete. Research in animals has emphasized the role of gene–environment interactions, the modulation of effect as a function of development (Soto-Martinez and Sly, 2010), and exposure to multiple mixtures (Silva da Silva et al., 2015). In utero PM exposure has been reported to play a role in early cardio, orofacial, and other defects (Teng et al., 2016); the transgenerational inheritance of ovarian disease (Nilsson et al., 2012); cardiovascular disease in adulthood (Tanwar et al., 2017a); brain defects (Chao et al., 2017); and many pathways, including antioxidant response, xenobiotic metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and endothelial dysfunction (Thomson et al., 2013). While using animal models makes it possible to control exposures and permits the study of defined compositions of multiple elements and tissues from multiple organ sources, it lacks the temporal resolution and cumulative exposures that are observed in humans and their individualized responses.\n\nSynthesis and Conclusions\n\nThis literature for PM includes data on populations from around the world, often with relatively high exposures as a result of traffic or industrial pollution. Most studies examined environmental exposures, with only a few of them assessing occupational exposures.\n\nThe relevance of any of these studies to the exposures likely experienced by veterans is unclear. Exposures described in this literature are primarily continuous environmental exposures, whereas some veterans’ exposures ceased upon their return from deployment, such as exposure to burn pits, while others may have continued, such as exposure to diesel exhaust and PM. Thus, the studies reviewed here do not necessarily address the long-term effects of concern to veterans. There is also a lack of data on the reproductive or developmental outcomes that may be expected following male or female exposures to combustion products prior to conception or, in the case of female service members, exposures in early pregnancy before they would have left the war zone. Because there are so few data on preconception and first-trimester exposures, particularly in humans, the committee’s conclu"
