CALIFORNIA Saturday, 31 December, 1949 “NOW I KNOW ABOUT POLIO” Editor's Note — What does a parent feel when his child is stritken with Polio ? 1 housands 6/ parents learned first-hand last year when the nation was visited with its worst polio epidemic in history. Here, one of those parents, E. H . Heller, managing editor of the Marshfield ( Wis.) News-Herald, tells about it in a story written in connection with the 1V50 March of Dimes drive of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The Foundation faces a critical shortage of funds this year to carry on its work. By E. W. HELLER All I really know about polio is what thousands of other parents learned last year— how you feel when a word becomes a tenor that enters your life— how you feel when the doctor looks up, says, “I’m sorry. I’m afraid it's polio!” We were a thousand miles from our home in Marshfield, Wis., on our first vacation trip in two years. My wife, our three daughters and I had enjoyed the pleasant motor trip to — Commanding Marine Visits Leatherneck Patients Here visit my wife's parents in Easton. Pa. Anita, 17, our eldest daughter, had driven part of the way. We thought little of her complaint of eyestrain on the way out and we were not per- turbed when she said she was tired at the end of the trip. We had been in Easton two days when she complained of a throbbing But he estimated at least six months of hospitalization would be necessary; he could not even guess what degree of control over stricken muscles might be restored. That is the terror of polio, the grinding worry that persists until the worst is known— relieved slightly by heartfelt gratitude when unselfish friends message their anxiety and of headache.

There you have laid before you in plain un- varnished words, undecorated with . h<J mystic adjectives of terror used y novelists, a case of infantile pa- ralysis striking in a family. It could happen to you, or me. or anyone. It is no respecter of creed or race. It is no respecter of wealth or rank. It is no respecter of social position or political influence. In fact, it is one of the truly democratic things on this earth. It respects nothing. It can strike anyone anytime, any- where, anyway. Modern science with its Cyclopean eye has yet to divine the workings of this dreaded maimer and killer of young and old, rich and poor. With all the “miracle drugs ” science still has only one weapon against polio— money. In this one in- tance, can money buy that most prec- ious of all earthly commodities, hap- piness. 1 So the next time you go to a show give that little fellow in braces be- side you one-eighth of vour ticker t he next time you buy a box of candy, give the gnl on crutches outside the door a few pieces; the next time you have a steak dinner, invite that per- son in the iron lung at the next table to join you for a few bites The March of Dimes starts on Jan- ing military and civilian govern- mental leaders participated in the formal dedicatory services.

For the Jews, the Jubilee year was a year of special kindness and consideration. During this year all debts were canceled and all slaves were freed. At least that was the ideal in the minds of men cognizant of the Jubilee. Here in California the year 1949 commemorated the 100th anniversary of gold finding. Yet! An historical fact uppermost in the minds of the Amer- ican people and of the population of the world in 1949 was not Gold. It v/as the Berlin air-lift. Hungry mouths received bread, not stones. Young men lost their lives for an ideal. Within the last decade, men and women around the world have known the scourge of war. They realized, to a devastating degree, the futility of it as a medium for settling the differences of human groups. In age there Is wisdom— we have played with fire and we were burned. It is the desire of spiritual leaders that we truly enjoy Peace. This is possible to men of good will. AD MULTOS ANNOS. —FRANCIS J.

Incidentally, the carolling was led by the forceful voice of GEORGE BLACKBURN, veteran. The crackle, color, and disarray of Christmas wrappings at the Red Cross Lounge — the smell of taffy cooking — Santa hanging onto his slipping stomach — the energy, sta- mina, and vibrant personalities of the officers' wives who ran the joint- ly-sponsored wrapping service — the invasion of the nurses to wrap the kiddies’ presents, a grand bunch, speedy and efficient!— the mingled aromas of evergreens, oranges, ap- ples, fruit cake and pretty Christmas cookies. P AT PATTERSON, the gifted pup- peteer who was the lilt of the chil- dren’s party at the auditorium, play- ing a whole special show for ONE little three-year-old boy on the pedi- atrics ward and little MARK S touch- ing response to his lifelike, puppet playmate.

He took the place by storm, reindeers, sleigh bells, and all, and dumped the prize packages on our maternity ward here. There actually were sLx. as a matter of fact, since Mr. Claus came on duty early, at 2321 on the 24th and deposited a baby girl with Mr. and Mrs. Clayton, just about the time most of the world was commemorat- - Ing the birth of another Infant, born nearly 2000 years ago.

Page Three Saturday- 31 December, 1949 Page Five Who's Who — Resolved— Hailing from the fr£e and sovereign state of Oklahoma, although he en- listed in Texas, Glenn \\V. Oberlln, HN. of 71 B, first became interest- ed in his hobby of cartoon draw- ing in that state. In addition to his cartooning, Glenn was also a plumber’s helper and student prior to his enlistment. Although he is an, ardent student of all the sports, he claims pool and bowling as his favorites, and his fre- quent wins in both contests will speak for the effectiveness of being liked by him. Knoll ites Make Vows to Break LeGrande J. Phelps, HN, 75B, was a pharmacy worker before joining the Navy, so naturally he was surprised when asked if he wanted to go into the Hospital Corps by the en- listing officer in his home town of Salt Lake City, Utah, when he joined in Octo- ber of 1948. \"Flip,” as he is called by those who know him well, recalls “he almost won the tennis championship, in Salt Lake City. BUT In addition to his tennis, swim- ming and auto mechanics occupy his time, with just a few of the many hours in a week spent on liberty. After enlisting in Texas. Kirby G. Anthor. HA. assigned to special watches was returned to that grand and glorious state after Boot Camp and Corps school in San Diego before ar- riving at Oak Knoll in April of 1949. A, three-year letter man in alt four major sports, Anthor was an invaluable addition to the Oak Knoll basketball team where he now plays center. He Ls currently living in Koman- dorski Village with his wife, Imogene. Ered, born and raised in California. Alden L. Boucha, HN of the OOD’s office, also enlisted in this state, al- though he did travel freely be- fore deciding up- on his spot of en- listment. Bom in B r a w 1 e y . he moved to Mo- desto before en- listing in San Francisco. Since reporting to Oak Knoll in dA April of 1943. the which Every January 1st. there comes into each man’s heart a desire to do better deeds and act better actions for the coining year than he has for the last 395 days. That is why New Year Reso- lutions were begun; to enable persons with weak moral characters to vow something and then not be too ashamed for breaking that vow. “Everyone else did it: why shouldn’t I!” Here are a few of Oak Knoll’s reso- lutions. A story lies behind each one. and where possible it shall be given. In some instances, however, for ob- vious reasons, *he story cannot be given. In such cases, just use your imagination and everything will be fine. “Resolve to get a college education and then make third class,” says J. R. Stokes, HN, of Pediatrics, while his co-worker, L. E. Wallace vows, per- haps jokingly, “Resolve to receive my discharge with two stripes on my arm.” E. Cardinez, looking obviously un- dernourished, vows to confect that by \"Eating three meals a day instead of my usual one.\". J. E. Hawkins, HA, 75B, gave as his resolution, “Never to work again.” When reminded that the Navy frowns down upon vows like that he hastily amended it to read. “Never to work again — in civilian life.” Andrew L. Hubbard, Veteran on 75A. displayed an oft-punctured vein and promised solemnly to \"Get better veins so these corpsmen can hit them easier.” Still on 75A, ENS Dorothy Garber held up several thermometers which had been inadvertantly immersed in hot water and said soulfully, “I here- by resolve to never again sterilize thermometers by boiling them.” Joan Smejkal has one of the few resolutions which dealt with others instead of herself. “I resolve to share more and live more for hu- manity.\" Arthur E. Belknap, Veteran on 75B thought of others more than himself for his New Year course. Said Mr. Belknap. “I resolve to get well as I watch the others get better, too.” Anyone who has seen Billy Grif- fin’s back can well understand the reasons behind the promise of Billy Holliday, HA, on 71A. “I resolve to refrain from making the initial in- cisions on patients I prep.” Said Phyllis Shea, HM3(W) with- out cracking a smile, “I resolve to do something to make a resolution against.” The following resolution was given by a doctor fr- a nurse on 73B. As was warned at the beginning, some stories just don’t get in. This in one of those stories. \"I resolve to wear two slips with my nylon uniform.” Need more be said? R. T. George, HA, on G'JA, “I re- solve to get to work on time.” D. E. Kimmens, also on 62A, looked at him sharply before giving his resolution, ran. “I firmly resolve to aid Captain S. s!

Not only did Dick Tracy and Tess Truehart knock the pins out from under the nation, as did Sylvia and Clark, but our own Ruthie Ford is sporting a very lovely diamond on her third finger, left hand. That’s all I’ll say, since I promised to be subtle, for once, but we all think it’s wonderful, and wish the happy couple much joy ih their engagement. Edna Peters, ex-WAVE, played the role of Mrs. Claus, and made a fine job of transforming our rumpus room into a Holiday Delight. Lighted tree, little chimney, stockings and presents for all. “Pete” certainly must have had the real spirit this year. I believe her heart is still in the Navy, since so many of us at the WAVE Quarters benefited by her thoughtfulness. We could use an atti- tude like that all year ’round. All of us thank you, Pete, for your gen- erosity. Most every department in the hos- pital had their own party with re- freshments gifts and Santas. OPD put on a gala affair, with Dr. (“Dar- ling\" » Hammon portraying the Jolly Gent to perfection. It called for the aid of pillows, fore and aft, a great necessity, since Dr. H. is more on the Gregory Peck type than the Sid- ney Gieenstreet. However, he carried J. W. Howell and W. F. Davis, both SAs on 62B tin idered simultaneous- ly, “Resolve to be out of the Navy by next New Year’s Day ” Another untold story from ENS F L. Bryant. “Never to go with men again.” A. G. Hardman, patient on 11A, “Resolve to never again make a New- Year’s resolution or give llassan any gull.” That is a story in itself. Bill Gerlitz, HA, \"resolve to keep my locker clean.” That is obviously an attempt at humor. off the whole thing beautifully, mark- ing his entrance by the reading of a very clever (I think mostly original) poem that took in the vices and vir- tues of all the staff of this depart- ment. At the record office party on the 23rd, a little fellow by the name of “Peanut” caused quite a commotion, especially among the ladies. This was the mouse that must have been over- looked in the famous Christmas poem, for he “stirred.” all right, and made himself quite outstanding. LT Stutler found the friendly, brown - coated little beastie in his garage, and brought him to the office to find him a loving home. He was adopted im- mediately by Mrs. Ruth Cohoon (OPD) and her young daughter Judy, who was most enthusiastic about him. II they can just keep the cats away. He must really have a charmed life, since he has had two close calls in his young life. Christmas dinner here on the base was something to write home about, as most of us did. You’d really have to go far to find the equal of such a sumptuous spread. It would be very nice to have candy and cigarettes with every meal. We can skip the cigars. A great and pleasant surprise was the big turnout for midnight mass here on the base at the Chapel. The singing and music were beautiful, and Chiel Simms at the organ proved that there is no end to some of our buddies’ talents. And so, until 1950, “Auld Lan\" Syne\" J. Michell, Veteran on 41A, resolvi to “Turn over a new leaf that reac exactly as l he old one does.” And from all of us should come tl i esolution ol Elmer H. Jernigan, Vet eran on 75B. which goes like this- I res olve to follow the Golde Rule, that others may profit froi my example, and to follow the e> amples of others myself, by follow ing the paths ol famous men and dc touring from those taken by in famous men.” Page Six OAK LEAF <D E o X LL < LU < o LU X ~D c <D 00 •mm mmm C 5 o a ~ </5 • « a c E c u &« C H JhsL HCO Ssucd, By MAC Was Santa good to you this year? He left me so much coal in my stock- ing that John L. Lewis sent me a wire ordering me to go on a thirty day strike. All kidding aside, though, the old man with the white whiskers was really good to me and I hope that everyone else had as wonderful a time. Why is it that the “WAVES choice,” P. A. Moormeier, is going around telling everybody he is mar- ried, has two children, and that his wife is going to divorce him? From now on. if you want to enter the Record Office you must know the secret password. For the benefit of all those who don’t know it, the magic most of the others in my dorm were awakened when this strange conver- sation took place. “Lesh go out un have some fun.” 'But none of the buses are run- ning.” Thash all ri’, we kun take uh taxi.” \"But we haven’t enough money for a taxi.\" “Then we’ll jusht take a bus.” From the grapevine I’ve learned that the person who was so hot for taking a taxi was none other than “Surgery 2” Blunier. I believe that I have now seen everything life can possibly give me. The other night “Whitey” Campbell waited in a long line to buy a ticket to the movie. After purchasing his ticket, he handed it to the doorman, watched while he tore it in half, and then took off for parts unknown. I know what you readers are thinking, but will someone please tell me what he was thinking of? Another thing that makes the cashier in the ship’s service theatre go batty is the following little inci- dent. I shall not mention the party’s name to save them some explaining to the NP doctors (besides, I don’t know it). Anyway, this certain party went to the cashier’s cage and asked for “twelve cents worth of tickets.” Dah, which way did they go, George, which way did they go? I know this is a bit late and not news any more, but the medal of the week goes to \"Rembrandt” Martin for the wonderful job that he did on drawing and designing the Christmas decorations on Ward 66. It is a must for all art lovers. Things that will never hoppen: One corpsman admitting that an- other corpsman works harder than he does. words are “seven come eleven.” It seems that Chief Schultz is carrying around with him a portable “Reno” (including Harold’s Club) and you have to show the color of your money before you can enter. Stopping at a popular night club near the hospital for a bed-time nip, I was wondering whether “MGM” Zeigler was working there as a bar- tender or not. I guess that when he left the base he forgot to remove his apron, because printed all over the apron was “Property of USNH.” I be- lieve that was just in case he got lost, the person who found him would know where to return him. If you should ever happen to bump Sunday, 1 January THE 1IASTV HEART (Comedy -Drama) with Ronald Reagan, Patricia Neal, and Richard Todd. “Richard Todd is an un- happy, distrustful yet proud Scotsman who is about to die but who never learns of his fate until, time running out, he is told the truth. Five invalided men — an American, a New Zealander, a London Cockney, an Australian and a Basuto Negro are en- trusted with the assignment of making his remaining days as comfortable and as happy as possible. He finally learns the truth and reverts to his original distrust and bitterness. Locale of the -torv is Burma during the last war. Finally convinced by liis companions that their deeds toward him are out of true friendship and not pity, the film ends on a happy note, temporarily overshadowing the impending tragedy.’* Warner Brothers, 99 minutes.

He has enough lipstick there to supply every WAVE on the base with a year’s supply. My interview of the week was with J. B. Lowry. The question I asked of him was how he liked night duty. “Ah, it’s alright,” was his academic reply, \"But those darned goldfish in the nurses’ office keep me awake all night.\" After finding that he is on Ward 51 A, I could understand his answer.

Everything is included; the time he started in a summer hotel working for room and hoard ; his struggle up the ladder, always the brash, cocky Broadway character disliked tor us- ing other people’s material; his chance at the big time when Bert Lahr is stricken, and when he has established himself as a star.” Warner Brothers, 116 minutes.

Over two weeks ago, the Public Works department was auth- orized to give it a face-lifting and make it habitable for Archives and the thousands of records which be- long to that department. . Formerly housed in Building 132. Archives will assume occupancy as soon as practicable, thus allowing the Record Office more ready access to the files. The long trek now necessary has long been a source of irritation to those who had to obtain the Re- cords from, and return them to. the building across the compound Topside from the Record Office, in the Administration Building, other changes are being made. The Oak Leaf, formerly between the Exec’s of- fice and the Administrative Assis- tant s, has been moved . across the passageway to share an office with Organization, making that depart- ment momentarily one of the most disorganized on ‘he compound. The space vacated by the paper will soon be occupied by a secretary to the Ex- ecutive Officer. A light green paint has been applied to the walls to give a bright new interior. - Offi cers Turn Out to Welcome New Year Trio oj Be t hies Greets New Year 1949 was already just a memory, and the new year was seven hours and 50 minutes old when Marguerite Wheadon presented her husband Johnny, with their first born, a girl, weighing five pounds, six ounces!

California Dear Sir: T/v wife, Mrs. Mildred F. Brazen, was discharged from Ward 73B. C. S. \\az’al Hospital, Oakland, on 13 December, 1949, following the birth of a daughter, Sally Anne Brown. My wife received prenatal care from Dr. Pease and actual delivery, with very little time to spare, was performed by Dr. I rank. It is a most pleasant task to heartily commend the services of Drs. Pease and Frank, as zee 1 1 as A arses I itillo and Adams, the latter being, I believe , associated with the Red Cross. 7 he services rendered from the lime of admission as a pre- natal patient through delivery, hospitalization . and ultimate discharge, were of the very finest. Nothing was left undone in the matter of professional attention, and all services, on behalf of doctors, nurses, corpsmen and attendants. \\ were rendered with the greatest courtesy. Will you be so kind as to extend the profound gratitude of myself and my zvife to all of your personnel ? Most sincerely, E. N. BROWN Commander (SC) CS X f f CHAPLAIN’S CORNER t t Jesus was an advocate of and an example of unselfish love, and a firm believer that it and it alone could solve all the ills of the world. He told a story once about the sort of love He exemplified and advocated. A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. They beat him. robbed him and left him half dead beside the road. By chance a priest came by and when he saw him, passed by on the other side. Like- wise. a Levite when he saw the place, came and looked on him and passed by on the other side. But a certain Samaritan when he came to the place saw the man and had compassion on him. He bound up his wounds, set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said, “Take care of him and if you spend more, when I come again, I will repay thee.” Charles R. Brown, famous Yale teacher and preacher, used to say that this story reveals that Jesus knew the kind of men in this world. There are those like the priest and the Levite. whose philosophy is, “What’s mine is mine and I’ll keep it.” There are those like the thief who say. “What is yours is mine and I’ll take it.” There are those like the innkeeper who say, “What's mine is yours if you can pay for it.” And finally, there are those like the Samaritan who say. “What is mine is ours, we’ll share it.” Jesus believed not only that the world needed that sort of love as shown by the Samaritan, but that it was the only way that we could show God that we love Him. Hence the close connection between His two great com- mandments— “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all they heart and mind and strength, and thy neighbor as thyself.\" Hence the Golden Rule- “Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.

I never thought that when I left home for the life of a Red Cross recreation worker that I’d be here in 1950! Im- agine. Well, funny things happen, too. The other night I met a fellow on the compound when I was on the way to the wards and he looked a little strange, sort of silvery, but then It was a bright moonlight night any- way. So he said, “Are you the Red Crocs?” \"Yes,” I said, “Could I direct you somewhere — are you a patient,?” “No.” he answered, \"I just got in from the Moon. First trip, in fact. My U-239 point 7 pocket adapter worked just fine with no hasseling around in interstellar space!” “Oh. you’ve been playing games!” I observed brightly. \"The Red Cross has lots and lots of them, and cards, and puzzles, and arts and crafts, and muscial Instruments and records, not to speak of — \" “Lady,\" he said patiently, \"Tell me omething. Is this the Ends of the Earth?” “Certainly NOT!” I answered in- dignantly. “This is the finest hospital in the United States and it’s in the midst of thriving communities, Oak- land, Berkeley, and Alameda where our wonderful volunteers come from. The Red Cross Gray Ladies of Oak Knoll are practically famous, and the Motor Corps. Production and Supply, Entertainment and Instruction, Can- teen Service, Home Service, besides all of the — ” ' “Must have missed my landing by at least 3 milledrips.’’ he muttered. \"Besides my initial PPHLT is getting a little low, so I have to start back pretty soon.” “Oh, that’s too bad,” I said. “Is everything all right at home — do they need any help? If you really have cause to worry the Red Cross can send a wire, and find out how things are. Then if it’s really an emergency the social worker will help you ar- range transportation, and if you’re broke — ” There was a strange popping sound like a champagne cork and I was alone in the cold silvery moonlight. So I hurried on to that nice warm ward. No, honestly Zelma, I'm not kid- ding and it wasn’t the holidays either.

Sailor Santa Claus; Friends Give Orphans Third Party By Armed Forces Press Service This is a post-Christmas story. It’s a simple, heartwarming yarn about the generosity of officers and men at the U. S. Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Md. — and of a young seaman who never forgot. Joseph Peter Pestana, SN, USN, is an orphan. The orphanage operated by the Mission of the Immaculate Conception at Mount Loretto, Staten Island, in New York, had been his home for 13 years. lie remembered the meager Christ- mases as a child. None but a person who’s spent his youth in an orphan- age knows what it means to be re- membered at that time — the “per- sonal touch,” he’ll tell you. Two years ago he decided to do something about it. The 25-year-old sailor, as a self- appointed Santa Claus, distributed small cash donations, candy and toys to youngsters in one of the orphan- age’s cottages. In 1948, still from his own meager funds, he repeated the process. the 74 boys, between six and eight years. There still remained money for candy, a Christmas tree, the dec- orations— and all the other Yuletide accessories. Pestana was overwhelmed. Women in the ship’s service store wrapped the presents in gaily colored paper. The Navy contributed a Santa Claus suit. A buddy provided the trans- portation to New York. To Pestana it was all convincing evidence that there is a Santa Claus. “They're all Santa Clauses,\" he says of his shipmates and NAS personnel. This past Christmas season Pestana « k iin i/ , had a real problem. Instead of the i/th Nfi Keqlers smaller number of children to whom q • t i he’d played Santa Claus, he now had D6QII1 ^^OnuQV 74. That’s a lot of good little boys to ^ good take care of at Christmas time for a seaman in the U. S. Navy. Pestana, quiet and reticent by nature, discussed the matter with a buddy at Patuxent. Before he knew' what was going on station personnel were calling on him in the ship’s service tailor shop where he works. They didn’t leave until they had left cash donations with him. The entire project had been spread by word of mouth throughout the station. From the skipper on down to children of naval and civilian personnel the contributions poured in. When the cash hit the $100 mark, Pestana figured he should quit ac- cepting it. But still it came. Eventually there was enough to purchase a combination radio-phono- giaph set. In addition there was enough to get individual presents for The Twelfth Naval District bowl- ing league to establish credit toward the Commandant's Trophies will be- gin on Monday. 9 January, with matches being bowled every Monday at 1930. A perpetual team trophy will be presented to the activity which the championship team represents, and individual awards will be made to the team members.

Marines passed over, dribbled through, and waltzed past a disorganized quintet from Oak Knoll to the tune of 70 to 35 in the local gym on Monday, 3 January. Led by their giant center, Charles Dickerson, and a fighting, slippery, dead-eye guard, Jim Haupt, the Ma- rines were headed for a short time only after J. T. Brandt had put the Bugs ahead. 5 to 4 and 8 to 7. From then on till a merciful end, the Leathernecks had complete control of the ball game. Clem Cahall started the scoring for the victors on a set-shot early in the game. Gerald Zilch tied it quickly, but Dickerson then put the Marines ahead again with, the first of his 17 points. Cliff Hodge and J. T. Brandt put together a free throw and field goal to forge into the front of a 5 to 4 score. Larry Holland and Tom Hendrickson pushed the Marines ahead again, and Brandt retaliated with three quick points to enable the Bucs to lead for a brief period. Although fighting gamely all the way, the Pirates weren't in the same class with the tall, tricky Leather- necks. Complete backboard control provided the winners three shots to the losers’ one. and the local team’s slippery fingers— caused by sub-zer<* weather or post -New Year s fatigue- added materially to the Mariint chances. Johnny Carsten again led the loser in the scoring column by sinking fivi field goals. Brandt ran a close secou- ■ with nine points. Little J. C.

Paramount -‘>S minute 1949S LOONEY LARCENY PARADE Armed Forces Press Service For the cops and robber boys, 1949 was a gay year with both sides of the law sharing in the zany antics. Greediness was the downfall of many a star burglar. Take, for ex- ample, the Philadelphia felon who was caught stealing a 20-ton crane. Or the Phoenix professional who made off with a sign reading. “Dog for Sale,” then came back the next day for the dog. And the Florida lad who swiped 23 alligators from a me- nagerie. Smart sleuths were a match for the year’jJ best crime addicts. Out in Mis- souri, police tracked down the cul- prit who ransacked a grocery through one clue — his tecthmarks. Seems the careless crook had munched on some cheese, then left the evidence be- hind. Moral: Don’t eat on the job. Police made the easiest capture of the year in Leeds, England, when they got a phone call from a man trapped in a clothing store. After the rescue, the hobbies wondered how he had gotten in, thought it over, and marched him off to jail. Shrewd citizens' made the cops’ lot a happier one in *49. In Malibu, Cali- fornia, a woman’s purse was snatched from her parked car as she ap- proached. When she picked up a fa- miliar looking hitchhiker later sin saw the light and drove to the near- est police station. Of course, there were soriTf who worked both sides of the game. Like the Tokyo cop who stole clothing from police headquarters. Or the De- troit policeman who was accused ot lifting his fellow officers' lunches Bu* (he candidate for sheriff in Indian, polis takes the cake. He got two year in prison for campaigning in a stolen automobile. Oh, well, another year. Vol. 9. No. 3 UNITED STATES NAVAL HOSPITAL. OAKLAND.

People judge by externals and are often misled — such is the case when they jump from a particular premise and derive a universal con- clusion. That’s poor logic, now and always. There was a time when it was considered necessary for an American whose integrity had been called into question to challenge his rival to a duel. This was known as an “affair of honor.\" Such a duel was often fought with a deadly weapon and at times resulted in death or serious injury to one or both of the participants. We no longer fight duels to settle problems of personal honor. To do so is forbidden by law. This does not imply a decreased interest in keeping our names or honor clean. Our courts today are busy with many cases, such as thefts, broken contracts and the like. Honor deals with the practice of virtue, and it demands first of all, that we as individuals have certain principles of moral worth. It is said that there is honor among thieves. They do not “squeal on each other”; that’s their code. They are friends with one another, but enemies to society. Their moral obligations of honor extend only to a small group; hence they share only a meager portion of honor, if any. Ideals must be rooted in a sense of what is right, just, and true, if we want to achieve honor. \"Honor” in the sense of high-minded character calls for three primary ingredients of personal morality; namely, keeping one’s word— doing one’s duty — and following through. Since men include in their codes of honor the understanding that their word is their bond, many of the contracts today are verbal and written. A failure to keep one’s word makes for poor business.' Conforming to ideals of what is just, right, and true is really performing of one's duty, another outward manifestation of honor. \"Following through” shows the courage and determination in you. An example of following through in spite of obstacles can be found in the life of John Augustus, a Bostonian, who a century ago, believed that something should be done to help both juvenile delinquents and older criminals, wher- ever possible, to become readjusted to honest and honorable living. John was frowned upon in police courts by many judges and lawyers. Some even accused him of obstructing justice. Nevertheless, John Augustus acted as counsel for prisoners; he went bail for them; he found homes for “dead end kiddies”; he started men and women anew in better lives. Today he is considered the founder of the parole system and the father of prison reforms. FRANCIS J.

TuMev of ward 50B for the meager sum of 25 dollars —on terms, of course. Knowing the varied career of Tulley. it is easy to see why he can out-hag- gle an old hag- ^ gler like Ed. Born in Ta- coma, Washington, Paul played tuba for a Dixie quartet, sailed in the Mer- chant Marine, and tore two pilings out of a ’Frisco dock while at the . wheel of one of his vessels. He joined the Navy in California in January of 1949 and arrived at Oak Knoll in December of the same year. “Where\" he says, \"I've been content to listen to my radio and records, during my spare time, and add to my collection of the latter.\" Does anyone have a good, simple definition for the term “roughneck- ing in an oil field?’ Terry L. Tarrant, HM3, of the Cast Room, worked in that capacity J • before joining the Navy in 1947. but chooses not to elaborate on 0 ^ ^ , his experiences. Born in Los Angeles, Terry journeyed to Amarillo for work and enlistment in the Navy, and after a short sojourn in San Diego, reported to Oak Knoll in March of 1948. Wail (A WceS By JEAN SHARPE. HM1 Well. I’m at it again, but only be- cause I sorta missed seeing my name in print last week. / on Moore is frock front the I. .and of Oranges, haring had a happy holiday in her home Iowa, Pasadena. She actually seems pleased at being frock among her old haunts and cronies. I here are people wh<> cnioy their fitfrs and make some- thing special of them. Kay Robinson, one of our She- Chiefs, has been laid up on 69A for a couple of weeks now, and we hope she will soon be back to duty. It’s amazing how you can miss the quiet ones. too. II V welcome aboard Teresa Hawk, HMl. from the Dispensary at Moffett, where she was a familiar figure for some three years. I know how Terry must miss her old friends and the duty she had. but it's happened to all of us. Happily for her. her detail in ODD is in Peds with Doctor Kurcrok. That should take the edge off the howling babies, as there isn’t a nicer, pleasanter doctor around. ( Xope . he doesn’t give me my quarterly marks.) Laura Matz, YN2, imported from NAS for temporary duty on the Evaluation Board, is also a newcomer to quarters. I remember in the old days Pharmacist’s Mates and Yeo- men feuded like Martins and Coys. We used to run ’em out of the chow hall with our elaborate stories about gory operations, but we won’t do that to Laura. Kay Cass is tone gracing OPD. Jenny Rhoades and Feral Ycarout hair be- come bedpan commandos on 69 . 4 . ,/r- lene Xormington and Lucille Berstler are still on leave. I finally had the pleasure of meeting the reason for Ruthie Ford's smiles and blushes — Ray Tackett. a very nice young man who heartily agrees zvith me that he has fine taste in zoo men. Each New Year most publications print a list of outstanding personal- ities and achievements. I wanted to do this too, and I have some great ideas. However, that can lead to mis- understandings. So ... I shall boil my choices down to one person. The fact that she just happens to be a WAVE is not my doing. I guess I know good stuff when I see it, no matter where. There are very few people who would have had the in- testinal fortitude to see things through as well as this gal has. Handicapped by an injury resulting from an auto accident, suffering con- stantly from terrific headaches, she works tirelessly without gripes, and with many laughs. A lot of us could benefit by her example, but before I sound too preachy. I’ll put away my soap box and present Julie Clouse with the Oscar for '49. Doctor Gets Citation LCDR Jack C. McCurdy, MC, USN, resident in surgery, this week re- c.« ived the Navy Unit Commendation ribbon and congratulations from the Commanding Officer. The award came as recognition of Dr. McCurdy’s service with the Twenty-Second Marines, Reinforced, Tactical Group One, Fifth Amphibi- ous Corps. The Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy was given for that group’s \"outstanding hero- ism In action against enemy Japa- nese forces during the assault and capture of Enewetok Atoll.

Who said that \"Variety is the spice of Life?\" No doubt ’twas first said by a Navy Wife For the poor girl never knows Just where he’s at— AT home is wherever he parks his hat. She moves every two years into new sets of quarters. During which time she births sons and daughters. She packs up to move to the plains of Nebraska, Then orders are changed and they go to Alaska, Her house may be a hut with no room for expansion, It may be a tent or perhaps it's a mansion. Then she uncrates the furniture in snows or in rains, And lays the linoleum between labor pains. She wrangles saw horses and builds all the beds, Makes curtains of target cloth she last used for spreads. And during each move— now isn’t it strange? The brats invariably catch mumps, measles or mange! She no more than gets settled when she must dress up pretty. And go to a party, and be charming and witty. On every subject she must know how to discourse. She must swim, ski, and never be nervous. She must know songs and traditions of the Service. She fast learns the dope on how HE won the War. She jitterbugs with Lieutenants who always are glamorous — Then waltzes with Captains who are usually amorous. She must drink all concoctions, gin, whiskey and beer. But — of course, moderately or she’ll wreck his career. He insists on economy, questions every stub, Yet her house must be run like a hotel or club. For she entertains at all hours, both early and late. For any number of guests— eighty or eight. The first of the month there is plenty of cash, So she serves turkey and ham — but the last week it’s hash. She juggles the budget for his new tropical worsted. Though the seams on her own outfit have bursted. One year she does her own work and has a new baby, The next she has servants and lives like a lady. That there’ll be a bank balance she has no assurance, It all goes for likker and some damned insurance At an age to retire, he is still hale and hearty. Fit as a fiddle, the life of the party. While she is old and haggard, cranky and nervous — Really a wreck after his thirty years service. But even then when all’s said and done. She still believes that Navy Life’s fun. She has lived every minute— and why, good grief — She’d have been bored with a barber or merchant chief. But there’s one fancy Medal, and Navy men wear it ; It’s their Wives who should have it, THAT LEGION OF MERIT! NSU Checks +o Start Rolling Washington iAFPS> — \"The middle of January,\" still remains the tenta- tive date for mailing National Service Life Insurance policy dividend checks, the Veterans Administration has announced. The VA also announced that at least 1,175,000 of the estimated 16 million World War II veterans eli- gible for the dividend payments have failed so far to file claims. Veterans who have not filed appli- cations, the VA states, are simply delaying the date they will receive their checks. Veterans can apply at any time, and the amount they re- ceive on war-time insurance they hold or once held will not change with the delay. Interest earned on unclaimed dividends will revert to the VA Insurance fund as profits. At the present rate of filing, 1,500 a day, three years will elapse before all eligibles have claimed their share of the dividends.

We have \"Archives\" Chappel, who really knows how to tickle the ivories, to offer. His rates are very reasonable, and he plays for all sorts of sad activities such as weddings, women’s birthdays, and reenlistment dates. How observing can a person be? \"SDT\" Bostrom has been sleeping in the same dormitory for ni?h onto two years, and he still doesn’t know how to turn the lights off. <Ed's note: Mr. B, it is really quite simple, all you have to do is push a little button.) If any of you are wondering what the “SDT\" means, ask Bostrom. He’ll be glad to tell you. The next little case I want to tell you about is a tragic case of a person who’s been working (?) too hard lately. The other day, I saw “Scratch\" Forrest walking around the com- pound singing and playing with his yo-yo. The only thing that has me worried is that the yo-yo was of the imaginative type. Que tion of the week: How come we got up at 0545 instead of 0600 last week? Maybe \"Lamplighter” Ever- hart was lonely and wanted to have some fun, but doesn’t he realize that we corpsmen need our beauty sleep? Everyone has heard of men giving their best girls flowers and corsages. Well, when H. E. Wells gives his girl a flower, he believes that any second hand, artificial rose that cost a dollar (new) which he bought for four-bits (with dust, of course) is just as good. Now, don't think that Romeo, Jr. is cheap, because that is what she wanted, so that is what she got. Speaking of the Battle of the Sexes, Wha’ Hoppen to Wave’s Woes last week? Don’t tell me Jeannie couldn’t stand some competition and gave up in despair. Would anyone like to see some grade A basketball, get transporta- tion, and the best seats in the house all for free? Although the Pirates got off to a bad start, they have the promise of being a great team, and the season hasn’t even really begun as yet . It is a great help to the team's morale to know that somebody in the stands is on their side. Let’s get out en masse at the next game and sup- port our team. If you would like to have more information about the transportation and the schedule of the team, give either Chaplain Mc- Comas or ‘‘The Oak Leaf\" a buzz, and they will be more than glad to help you. I’m dying of curiosity to know what the joke was that made “Horse Laugh” Baronie"
