Last year, the i cases zoomed to 54 per cent i over 1958. The Salk vaccine < : has been proved safe and I effective in preventing para- ] , lytic polio. The first two < , years after it was introduced, ^ the number of cases fell off ] spectacularly. Why the < i change? What's gone wrong? ( When the Salk vaccine was f first released five years ago, < there wasn't much available, < not nearly enough to go < around. All over the country, people rushed to get immun- < s ized before the supply ran out. As a result, paralytic , polio cases nosedived sensar tionally. Then apathy set in. Right now, 60 per cent of our s population is not properly pro- ' -j tected against polio, though there's more than enough vaccine for everybody. Though most of those not -1 fully protected from paralytic :1 polio are adults, 8,500,000 are children under five.

They can decide for themselves. But the children can't. Somehow, they must be protected against the crippling, pain, and death which :an be avoided. It is up to us as ClintonLydia Mills parents to make certain that our children receive this life saving serum. The shots are available without cost at the Health Clinic on North Woodrow Street in Clinton each Tuesday from 10:00 A.M.? 12 noon, and each Thursday from 2:00 P. M.?4 P. M. i he State Hoard of Health has reported that South Carolina has had 72 cases of polio and four deaths from the crippling disease thus far this year. Dr. G. E. McDaniel, director of the Division of Disease Control, said there have been three times as many cases thus far this year as in a corresponding 1959 period."
