        "text": "A beautiful Corot portrait – once owned by the actor Edward G Robinson and the shipping tycoon Stavros Niarchos – has been left to the nation by its most recent owner, the late Lucian Freud. L'Italienne ou La Femme á la Manche Jaune (The Italian Woman or Woman with Yellow Sleeve) was painted around 1870 when the French painter was in his seventies.\n\nJean-Baptiste-Camille Corot (1796-1875) was best known for his landscapes. On Monday the portrait was unveiled in room 41 of the National Gallery. Nicholas Penny, the gallery's director, said he was delighted the painting was entering the collection. \"People will be quite surprised, I think. Corot has this reputation of doing things which are easy on the eye, and this is a robust and almost aggressively painted picture.\"\n\nThe National Gallery said Freud's motivation in leaving the painting was his gratitude to Britain for welcoming his Jewish emigré family into the UK in 1933 when they fled Nazi Germany. Freud, the grandson of Sigmund Freud, was 11 when he arrived and became a British citizen in 1939.\n\nThere is also a pecuniary benefit for his estate. Along with three bronze statues by Degas that Freud also left to the nation, a total of £2.34m liabilities to inheritance tax have been met.\n\nPenny said Freud was a regular visitor to the National Gallery. \"He never told me what he liked – he was the most unpredictable visitor.\"\n\nThe two men discussed Freud's wish to leave the painting before his death, aged 88 in 2011, with the artist anxious that it would always be on display. Penny said a painting of this quality was always likely to be, although he stressed it was not gallery policy to fix pictures to a certain wall and leave them there in perpetuity.\n\nThe painting is a welcome addition to the National Gallery's collection. \"Although we have a very strong collection of Corot's works, we have no example of a late figure painting like this,\" said Penny. \"Its rough-hewn monumentality and abrupt transitions anticipate Picasso's exercises in the classical manner and make it one of the most modern looking pictures in the collection.\"\n\nThe Corot portrait was bought by Freud at auction in 2001 and was owned for 20 years, up until 1957, by Robinson who, with James Cagney, was one of the two leading gangster actors of his generation. Yesterday's unveiling represented its first public exhibition since a show at the Louvre in 1962.\n\nThe three Degas sculptures – Horse Galloping on Right Foot, The Masseuse; and Portrait of a Woman: Head Resting on One Hand – have been allocated temporarily to the Courtauld Gallery in London, where there is every chance they may end up permanently."
