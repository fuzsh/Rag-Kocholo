        "text": "Through legends, the Jewish collective memory awards a significant place to the builders of synagogues, as it does to the painters of synagogue murals and the carvers of Torah arks. These narratives played an important role in the Jewish community's perception of and its self-identification in the townscape. Tales about masters, both Jewish and Christian, full of oddities, didactics, and miracles, believably circulated in Jewish traditional society, although they were not recorded until the early twentieth century. Sometimes a tale echoes an inscription left by a master on his work, but most often it is an independent form of collective memory. The legends live according to the rules of their genre, often making use of universal subjects, so that their understanding is difficult without the context of non-Jewish folklore. The Israeli School of Folklore Studies is deeply involved in the study of the international tale types and their adaptation to Jewish religious texts and daily life, to the Jewish addressers and addressees in their historical mutations and geographical variety. Such adaptation leads to the production of new narratives, called oicotypes in accordance with the theory and terminology transferred by Carl von Sydow from biology to ethnography. The present paper is dedicated to the adaptation of the Tale of a Giant as a Master Builder (AT 1099), which is popular in Jewish folklore and belles-lettres. The paper deals with the main components of this tale as rendered in a traditional society, its transformations in the writings of European acculturated interpreters, Jewish national romanticists, and those who abandoned this latter trend to embrace the artistic avant-garde.\n\nThe relationship between the freedom of creation and the commitment to religious commandments is one of the most common dilemmas in the world of the believing creator. This article discusses these dilemmas, from the status of art in religious eyes, to practical questions that mainly concern the sexual fields, but not only. At the end, a curriculum is offered that gives the young religious creator an introduction to the various issues, and a guide to dealing with them.\n\nThe 27th volume of the international series Jews and Slavs, entitled Jewish-Slavic Cultural Horizons: Essays on Jewish History and Art in Slavic Lands, dwells on the political, cultural, literary, and artistic interaction between Jews and Slavic peoples from the Middle Ages to the World War II aftermath. The volume accomplishes a joint cooperative project of the Center for Slavic Languages and Literature of the Hebrew University, the Center for Jewish Art of the same university, and the Scientific Research Center of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts in Ljubljana. The volume’s twenty-one essays elucidate the protection of Jewish movable and immovable heritage and memory, the destiny of Jewish cultural heritage in the Holocaust and its aftermath, an image of a Jew in Christian and Jewish cultures, Jewish ethnography and historiography, history of Jewish art and artists’ biography, Jewish artistic life in Slavic public milieu, the methodology of Jewish art history, the search for “Yiddishland,” and a Jewish contribution to the Slavic cultures. The scholars of diverse backgrounds and research interests from Belarus, Israel, Poland, the Russian Federation, Slovenia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the USA contributed to this volume."
