        "text": "When Frank Auerbach was a few weeks away from his eighth birthday his parents put him on a train from Germany to Britain, his luggage neatly packed and labelled. It was April 1939 and he would never see them again. Within little more than a decade this orphan of the Holocaust would be exhibiting bold, pungent, paint-laden pictures that fascinated critics and fellow artists. In the 1950s the art critic David Sylvester already thought young Auerbach might be a \"great painter.\"\n\nAnother fan was Lucian Freud, nine years older and already established, who came to an Auerbach exhibition and simply said to the artist: \"Thank you.\" They were to be close friends until Freud's death in 2011. Freud has left his friend an extraordinary gift. The bequest is technically to the nation. Freud's collection of 15 paintings and 29 drawings by Frank Auerbach has come to the government in lieu of inheritance tax. It is now on view at Tate Britain and will be allocated to public galleries.\n\nFreud's choice of his friend's art is superb. The troubling, profound masterpieces he owned open up new ways of seeing Auerbach and will surely win him new generations of fans as he prepares for a Tate retrospective in 2015.\n\nIn one painting, a woman stares into a fire – says the title. Yet it's hard to see a face in the chaos of massed ripples and strings of paint. Freud owned a drawing done \"to elucidate\" this painting – it seems the great realist painter wanted a key to his friend's near-abstract image.\n\nSuch shocking and strange accumulations of paint are what make Auerbach so radical and disconcerting. The ripe, raw textures of his thick, heavy creations make them almost impossible to photograph as he takes painterliness to a visceral extreme, laying on great rivers, mounds, twisted braids, spiky hardened drips and straight-from-the-tube loops of colour. In fact Auerbach is very different from Freud as an artist and has far more in common with the American abstract expressionist painter Willem de Kooning or the Swiss existentialist Alberto Giacometti.\n\nAuerbach was nevertheless a big part of Freud's life, testifies the art critic Martin Gayford, who got to know Freud well while sitting for his portrait by him. The first time he visited Freud's house he was struck to see Auerbachs hanging everywhere – in the hall, the kitchen, the living room.\n\n\"I asked, 'Are you a Frank Auerbach collector?' Lucian was slightly offended by the idea of being a collector. He said: 'No, I just love Frank.'\"\n\nLovely, intimate relics in the Tate Britain display of Freud's Auerbachs reveal how that love was reciprocated. Freud treasured his annual hand-drawn birthday cards from Auerbach. One is a crazed sketch of Rubens's fleshy painting Samson and Delilah in the National Gallery while another portrays a tiny Freud gazing entranced at an immense nude – a caricature of Freud's Benefits Supervisor Sleeping.\n\n\"They were very good friends for a very long time\", confirms Gayford. \"Lucian would always consult Frank about the hanging of an exhibition.\"\n\nThey had plenty in common besides being exceptional painters. Frank Auerbach was born in Berlin in 1931. If his artistic talent is innate it seems to have come from his mother, Charlotte Nora Burchardt, who had studied art. His father, Max Auerbach, was a lawyer. He had a very comfortable, bourgeois early childhood (\"frantic coddling and knickerbocker suits\") in the heart of Berlin and in this is the younger double of Lucian Freud, who was born in Berlin in 1922. As adult friends they shared memories of the same German children's books. While Freud came to Britain with his family in 1933, the year Hitler attained power, Auerbach's fate was more desperate and brutal as his parents stayed on hoping against hope that things would be all right for German Jews.\n\nHe does not even know for certain in which camp his parents were murdered. How deeply has this early crisis in his life shaped his art?\n\nDavid Glasser, chair of the Ben Uri Gallery and London Jewish Museum of Art, is concerned that \"third parties\" should not glibly offer interpretations of how an artist may be affected by the Holocaust. But he has no doubt Auerbach's \"forced journey\" from Berlin to Britain must have influenced the kind of artist he became. \"That break of continuity – coming from one childhood in the very centre of Berlin to another childhood on his own – shunted around as a piece of human luggage\" may explain why, in Auerbach's early works, \"there is a sense of emptiness\".\n\nThe most disorienting things in Freud's collection are portraits and cityscapes done in the 1950s and early 1960s in which Auerbach masses up almost monochrome layers of colour that somehow never conceal the hollow eyes, skulls and grave-like pits lurking in his labyrinthine surfaces. His portraits of his regular model Estella Olive West, always named in his titles E.O.W., include a dark charcoal drawing in which she seems burdened by some unnameable grief. In two paintings Freud owned from the same period in the mid-1950s her face is built up in yellowing scums of waxy colour. These awe-inspiringly horrific paintings (one of which is tiny) are like relief sculptures made of rubber that have been left to rot in a canal. You expect to see flies crawling on them.\n\nAuerbach at this time was emulating the dark hues of Rembrandt, yet his colours resemble urine and excrement rather that some old masterly smoked shadow. There are holes and caves in the dried fecal face of E.O.W. that open \"lanes to the land of the dead\", to quote WH Auden. I for one can't shake off the fact that he painted these terrible masterpieces only 10 years after the killing was stopped at Auschwitz. Similar horrors lurk in his paintings of building sites in a postwar London where concrete and glass were filling the voids created by German bombs. Freud owned Auerbach's great 1962 painting Rebuilding the Empire Cinema, Leicester Square. In this epic scene of sludge and mud marked by the bloody streaks of red girders painfully thrusting a new life into the old ground, an empty cavernous space yawns below the busy building site – a glimpse of hell.\n\nBy this time Auerbach was deeply connected to the city where he has lived and worked most of his life. He studied art at St Martins from 1948 to 1952, then went to the Royal College of Art until 1955. He got a studio in Camden Town – it had previously been used by his friend Leon Kossoff – and has kept it ever since. His painting To The Studios in the Freud collection is a tumultuous celebration of simply walking to the studio to work on an early morning through the riotous streets of Camden. Auerbach reputedly works all day, seven days a week, in his studio and drawing his local landscapes including Mornington Crescent and, for rustic relief of a quintessential urban kind, Primrose Hill.\n\nAs he settles deeper into this routine from the 1950s to now, you can see happiness bloom in the art of Frank Auerbach. In the 1960s he started using brighter colours, partly because he could afford them. Simon Schama even sees Auerbach as a joyous artist, a fantastically \"self-indulgent\" enthusiast of paint who escaped postwar austerity with luscious art. \"His studio is like some sort of place where rationing has just been abolished. It's the ultimate sweetshop. It's full of touchy-feely paint. Freud talked about not wanting to paint nudes but to build them. It's Auerbach who's really building things, layering it on in a sort of party of impasto.\"\n\nHere we may be getting to the heart of the artistic friendship between Freud and Auerbach, and Freud's dedication to the younger man's art. Schama believes Auerbach helped Freud see a new way to paint. There was a great leap forward in Freud's art when he abandoned the early, precise, almost clinical style of such 1950s portraits as Interior at Paddington (1951) in Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery and instead became freer, looser, more \"painterly\" – like switching from Raphael to Titian.\n\n\"Freud at that stage was so anal and guarded\", says Schama. He thinks Auerbach's sticky, gooey, almost monstrously rich painting style helped Freud escape his \"anal\" tendencies and embrace \"some of Auerbach's meatiness\".\n\nIn Auerbach's jokey birthday cards you see the level of artistic play these painters shared when they met for breakfast at the Cock Tavern, Smithfield Market, laughing at how they were remaking the baroque in stupendous nudes and faces built out of paint.\n\nIf Freud was indebted to Auerbach he has repaid it magnificently with his posthumous lesson in the troughs and peaks of genius, his painter's eye for great painting. Gayford says Freud had \"the highest opinion\" of Auerbach. As this painter's painter looks forward to his Tate retrospective, who can dispute that authoritative verdict?\n\nPotted history\n\nBorn 29 April 1931\n\nAge 83\n\nCareer Auerbach has been exhibiting paintings since 1956. His style is instantly recognisable owing to his heavy application of paint.\n\nHigh point Representing Britain in the Venice Biennale (1986) and sharing the the Golden Lion with Sigmar Polke; also a solo exhibition of his work at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2001.\n\nLow point In 1939 Auerbach was sent to England to escape the Nazi regime. His mother and father died in concentration camps in 1942, and he spent most of his childhood at a boarding school for refugees.\n\nWhat he says \"It seems to me madness to wake up in the morning and do something other than paint, considering that one may not wake up the following morning.\""
