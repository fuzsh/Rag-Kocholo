        "text": "An English artist of German-Jewish origin.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary and popular painters of the twentieth century. A grandson of famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud.\n\nHe was born into a Jewish-German family. Before the Second World War, the family moved to London, where Lucien studied at the Central School of Art, the School of Painting and Drawing in East Anglia and Goldsmiths College. Since his childhood, he had demonstrated great abilities for the fine arts. One of his drawings was chosen for an exhibition of children’s art at the London gallery Peggy Guggenheim. Because of bad behavior, he did not finish his studies and went to work for the merchant navy.\n\nLucien Freud mostly painted portraits and nude models in the interior. He was notable for his unusual approach to the depicted objects and rejected all canons in painting. The artist is known for images of celebrities, among which there are popular actors, musicians and even Elizabeth II, the Queen of Britain. The original manner in which the artist worked was often criticized, although it provided him tremendous success. One of his paintings, “The Sleeping Social Worker” – was sold at Christie’s auction for record 17.2 million pounds sterling. In addition, Lucien Freud entered history as one of the central figures of the “London School of Painting” – a movement that contrasted itself with popular abstract art and became the basis for the emergence of a new generation of British artists.\n\nKey ideas:\n\n– The main object of the artistic research of Lucien Freud was naked women and men. He chose non-standard poses for his models and depicted their bodies and faces in his own way, not embellishing or romanticizing them.\n\n– The painter’s art can be called ultra-realistic. His images of human figures are distinguished by naturalism, sharpness and somewhere even gross frankness. Not thinking about the aesthetic component and not caring about the external attractiveness of the model, Freud displays the inner essence of a person, exposing not only his body, but also his soul. The artist’s works have a strong emotional charge, which causes bright impressions of the viewer.\n\n– Freud’s early works are distinguished by a restrained color scheme, smoothed strokes and careful study of details. In his paintings, just like under the microscope, all facial features and flaws are visible: wrinkles, bags under eyes and pigmented spots.. Some portraits even resemble grotesque or caricature.\n\n– In the second half of his creative career, the artist moved on to thicker, larger strokes, like sculptors, made shapes in a pasty way and paid special attention to the psychological content of his works. The author’s mature works are distinguished by increased emotionality and even anxiety.\n\n– The main theme of the paintings of Lucian Freud is a human figure in the interior. Most often, that is one person (less often, that is a couple) lying in a loose relaxed pose and even sleeping, sitting or standing naked people. The master often uses the reflection motif, introducing additional figures in self-portraits (one of his favorite subjects). In many paintings, there are animals: dogs, rats and cats.\n\n– The artist chose models with expressive faces and non-standard forms, depicting them as frankly as possible. Shock and rejection of many was caused by too naturalistic depictions of genitals, which in many scenes were directly in the center of the canvas. Some critics said that Freud could make even a beautiful person ugly, like it happened with the portrait of famous model Kate Moss. The artist himself said that he depicted people not as they looked, but as he wanted to imagine them."
