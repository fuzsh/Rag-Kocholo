        "text": "Throughout his tumultuous life, Lucian Freud painted his protean visage with startling intensity, capturing his features and expressions with a raw honesty that suggested secrets at the naked core of his life.\n\nNow, for first time, visitors to the just-opened “Lucian Freud: The Self-Portraits” at the Museum of Fine Arts can gaze directly into the face and genius of one of the great painters of the last century.\n\nOrganized by the MFA in conjunction with the Royal Academy of Arts, London, this must-see exhibit brings more than 40 works on canvas, paper and etching plate to the first exhibit in Boston dedicated to Freud and the first anywhere to focus on his self-portraits.\n\nAssociate curator Akili Tommasino said visitors to “this unprecedented exhibition” can explore Freud's nearly seven-decade long career by viewing the changing ways he portrays himself.\n\n“We are thrilled to bring the self-portraits of this virtuosic painter, who relentlessly mined the human condition to the MFA, a museum whose treasures include works by artists deeply important to his development,” he said.\n\nVisitors will see dozens of Freud's varying depictions of his own shifting face – and others – presented with informative references to a remarkable life that pursued its own twists and turns.\n\nWant news like this sent straight to your inbox?

You pick the news you want, we deliver.\n\nDisplayed in roughly chronological order, the exhibit ranges from Freud's earliest self-portraits from his 20s to the transformative works of his 30s as he evolved into a darker style of realism to the unsettling portraits of his mature years.\n\nSome of the exhibit's many highlights include:\n\nFreud's first major self-portrait, “Man with a Feather,” from 1943, signals a key transition to his developing, artistic maturity.\n\nIn “Hotel Bedroom,” from 1954, Freud uses his second wife, Caroline Blackwood, in one of his rare double portraits and the last time he painted sitting down to adopt a more vigorous approach.\n\nProbably done in 1985 at night for which Freud had a separate studio, “Reflection (Self-Portrait)” displays an extraordinary gradation of paint and light.\n\nCompleted shortly before Freud's 80th birthday, the discomforting “Flora with Blue Toenails” reveals tensions between the artist and his subject and complex attitudes toward young women.\n\nBorn in Berlin in 1922 to the youngest son of pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, he moved with his Jewish family to Britain in 1933 to escape the rise of Nazism. A sometimes unruly student, he studied drawing and painting at several schools and later attended Goldsmiths College, London in 1942-1943. Freud served in the Atlantic on convoy duty with the British Merchant Navy during World War II.\n\nAs a young artist, Freud was influenced by surrealism and German Expressionism. But by the 1950s, he gravitated from an alienated style of painting to the signature psychologically penetrating look of his mature work.\n\nAn intriguing view of Freud as a craftsman and artist emerged during an opening day tour of the exhibit.\n\nDavid Dawson, an English artist who worked as Freud's assistant and model from 1991 until his death 20 years later, described him as “the most charismatic, brilliant and single-minded man man I've ever known.”\n\nIn a film describing his role as a model in Freud's last painting, Dawson said Freud did not want “to be a detached observer but to occupy the imagination of the sitter” and “load his psychological energy into every brushstroke.”\n\n“The studio became (Freud's) whole world...,” he said. “That very intense looking for long periods would give him the right information for his truth-telling to become transferred into the painting.”\n\nTommasino said Freud, influenced by British painter Francis Bacon, switched in the mid-1950s from sable to coarser hog's hair brushes that he used to forge a new style with a greater range of motion and bolder strokes that gave his work their distinct texture.\n\nWhile Freud publicly “disavowed” any influences in his work from his famous grandfather, Tommasino said he was likely “aware” of his writings on the power of the subconscious and suspected they manifested themselves in as yet undetermined ways.\n\nPerhaps of greater significance, he said Freud never used photographs as aides to paint self-portraits but “innovatively” employed variously-sized and placed mirrors to create unusual perspectives.\n\nDavid Wells Roth, an award-winning painter from Framingham, said changing to hog's hair brushes would have helped Freud paint “not just the surfaces of his subjects' skin but beneath it” to suggest their innermost character.\n\n“Freud's brushwork is so honest he can even get into the folds of his subjects' flesh. His sensitivity to color and light is extraordinary and lets him create the atmosphere he wants” he said.\n\nRoth added that relying on photos to paint self-portraits “defeats the purpose when the artist already has a model, himself” who exudes more genuine feeling than a static image.\n\nLooking at a nude self-portrait Freud completed in his mid-60s, Roth observed that the gaunt, tormented-appearing man on the canvas was not conventionally handsome as typically painted by an artist like John Singer Sargent.\n\nBut it's honest and beautiful,” said Roth. “Freud captures life with raw paint. You don't have to paint pretty. It's beautiful because it's true.”"
