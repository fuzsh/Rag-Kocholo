        "text": "Hello!\n\nI am mostly curious about the impasto painting technique of Lucian Freud and its layering.\n\nHe often put thick colours on top of eachother, even thin over thick like Rembrandt did.\n\nI wonder if he used Painting-Medium or only Terpentine and Linseed-oil.\n\nAlso if he premixed it into the color or how exatly this process was.\n\nDo you think that for example he really added more Linseed-oil from layer to layer?\n\nOr did he mostly use the paint purely?\n\nBut besides the very thick areas there are also smoother lines and even very thin background washes.\n\nThanks for comments!\n\nFrom what I’ve read on the internet and the videos I’ve seen I don’t believe he used a medium – his paint looked short which would fit in with this. I’ve read in a couple of places (one Michael Harding quote) that his main white was Cremnitz White (mainly winsor & Newton, for other colours too). I’ve also seen Mussini, Rowney Artists and Blockx oils in his studio in a later video, too\n\nI believe the smoother passages of paint are just solvent diluted."
