        "text": "July 22, 2011\n\nLucian Freud: Ave Atque Vale\n\nFrom the news release: 'Lucian Freud, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest, most influential and yet most controversial British painters of his era, has died at his London home. News of his death, at the age of 88, was released by his New York art dealer, William Acquavella. The realist painter, who was a grandson of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, had watched his works soar in value over recent years and, in 2008, his portrayal of a large, naked woman on a couch - Benefits Supervisor Sleeping - sold at auction for £17m, a record price for the work of a living artist. Born in Berlin, Freud came to Britain in 1933 with his family when he was 10 years old and developed his passion for drawing. After studying at art school, he had a self-portrait accepted for Horizon magazine and, by the age of 21, his talent had been recognised in a solo show. He returned to Britain after the war years to teach at the Slade School of Art in London. Over a career that spanned 50 years, Freud became famous for his intense and unsettling nude portraits. A naturalised British subject, he spent most of his working life in London and was frequently seen at the most salubrious bars and restaurants, often in the company of beautiful young women such as Kate Moss, who he once painted. A tweet from the writer Polly Samson last night reported that Freud's regular table in The Wolseley restaurant was laid with a black tablecloth and a single candle in his honour.'\n\nThe director of the Tate gallery, Nicholas Serota, said last night: \"The vitality of [Freud's] nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th century art. His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period.' And surely anyone who has had the privilege of standing before Lucian Freud's art in museum exhibitions will attest to the power of his work. Freud, as much as any painter of the figure today, observed the model not only as a posed subject, but also as a representation of humanity. Often his models were massively overweight as though excess flesh was enchanting to him. But no matter how we each see Freud's work, it does impact us in a visceral way. From his very tiny portrait of Francis bacon's head to the memorable portrait of Queen Elizabeth II to the multiple images of the Leigh Bowery 'portfolio' or his infamous 'Benefits Supervisor Sleeping', his ability to sculpt with paintbrush and palette knife was extraordinary.\n\nThis book gives a fairly wide spectrum of the artist's output, though it is in no way complete. Freud's output was enormous - in size and in quantity - and we are left with the works of an artist who will always be remembered for his bravery and even audacity to paint what he saw coupled with what he felt. as art critic Tim Marlow stated 'Freud was a very special man. He looked at the world was as if he was painting it but when you saw his paintings you saw how he really saw it.' He will be much missed.\n\nGrady Harp\n\nMarch 27, 2016\n\nIt is a trite enough sentiment that I'm sure its been said before, but between Sigmund and Lucian, the grandson is the more acutely aware psychological observer of the two. Sigmund Freud listened to his patients, prodded with intimate questions in search of more intimate answers, then reduced his findings to the data which would sustain his revolutionary theories on the workings of the human mind. Lucian watched his subjects, his models, many of whom he knew, and painted them. Not since the Neue Sachlichkeit artists of the twenties and thirties, particularly Otto Dix, Max Beckmann, and George Grosz, had portraiture been so brutally vivid in its' psychological complexity. Interestingly, Freuds' initial reaction to 'The New Objectivism' was one of utter scorn and repulsion, owing more to a general aversion to all things German than any true artistic dislike.\n\nWilliam Feaver and the books' publisher, Rizzoli, have produced an informative and beautiful volume that sheds light on the biographical and artistic development of one of 20th century Englands' greatest painters. Only Francis Bacon, his friend and occasional model, is considered to be more important. With a long career spanning several decades, Feaver has selected hundreds of Freuds' key works from every stage of his oeuvre, providing a visual feast for new admirers and old. Clothbound covers with gilt-embossed text, highest quality paper-stock, unassailable hi-res reproductions, and a stylish cloth-ended slipcase all contribute to make this 10.25\" x 12.25\", 488 page monograph a must-have for any artbook enthusiast interested in the art of Lucian Freud."
