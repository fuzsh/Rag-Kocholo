        "text": "Lucian Freud, German-Jewish born grandson of Sigmund Freud, was one of the greatest portrait painters of the last century and brought remarkable worth ethic, and uncompromising honesty, to his art. Freud painted right up until just a few days before his death at 88 in 2011.\n\nHis devoted assistant of two decades, photographer David Dawson, who has published a book on life with Lucian Freud and being involved in the production of several documentaries about him.\n\nI suggest a viewing of the full 90 minute awarding-winning documentary Lucian Freud A Painted Life if interested. Below is a link to part of it, with the reminder in other YouTube uploads. Note that the plenty of unhesitant nudity in the documentary, as reflecting his subject matter, and some frank dialogue: nothing prurient and entirely of the sake of understanding of the most important artists of recent times. The art critic Martin Gayford, who sat for a portrait by Freud and wrote a an excellent account of the experience (an abstract is read for class), appears too.\n\nFreud was famously private so the documentary offers a rare insight into his character and approach to painting and was produced after his death. It with scenes from what happened to be the last day he painted before he passed away. Lucian Freud’s paintings set records for the highest prices paid for a then living artist.\n\nAnother doco, of about half an hour in length, that features Freud in conversation and more fully reveals him at work in his last days, produced by David Dawson."
