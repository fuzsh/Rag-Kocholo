        "text": "Born: 1922 Berlin, Germany\n\nDied: 2011 London, England\n\nYear of Migration to the UK: 1933\n\nBiography\n\nPainter and draughtsman Lucian Freud was born into a Jewish family in Berlin, Germany in 1922, the son of architect Ernst Freud and grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Following Hitler's accession to Chancellorship in 1933, the family moved to Britain to escape racial persecution. Freud was educated at Dartington Hall, a liberal boarding school in Totnes, Devon (1933-36), Dane Court Preparatory School and, finally, Bryanston School (an independent public school in Devon), where he became a leading member of the Oil Painting Club. He became a naturalised British citizen in 1939. Between 1938 and 1939 he briefly attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts, before enrolling at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, Essex, run by Cedric Morris and Arthur Lett-Haines (1939-42). In 1939 a self-portrait by Freud was published in Horizon, the literary magazine founded by poet and novelist Stephen Spender and Cyril Connolly.\n\nIn March 1941 Freud sailed for Halifax aboard the SS Baltrover before being discharged at Liverpool and classified as unsuitable for military service. He subsequently shared rooms in Abercorn Place, Maida Vale with fellow painter John Craxton before moving to rooms in Delamere Terrace, Paddington. His first solo show took place at the Alex Reid and Lefevre Gallery in November 1944. Post-war travel restrictions meant that it was not until the summer of 1946 that Freud found himself in Paris, where he met Picasso and Giacometti, before joining Craxton on Poros, Greece. On returning to England in 1947 his work was exhibited alongside Craxton’s at the London Gallery. Soon afterwards Freud embarked on a series of paintings of Kitty Garman, daughter of the sculptor Jacob Epstein and Kathleen Garman and also took up etching, using tools given to him by Graham Sutherland. He married Kitty on 3 July 1948 and moved to 28 Clifton Hill, St. John’s Wood. He exhibited at the Hanover Gallery in 1950 and in 1951 won the Arts Council prize at the Festival of Britain for Interior at Paddington, 1951. In 1954 he shared the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale with fellow painters Francis Bacon and Ben Nicholson.\n\nAs a visiting tutor at the Slade School of Fine Art Freud taught intermittently between 1948 and 1958 during which time, he began a relationship with Lady Caroline Blackwood (the subject of Hotel Bedroom, 1954) whom he married on 9 December 1953 following his divorce from Kitty Garman. The marriage broke up in 1957 and they divorced the following year. In 1958, 1963 and 1968 his paintings and drawings were exhibited in solo shows at the Marlborough Gallery. He worked slowly and almost always from life, reflecting that: ‘I didn’t want to get just a likeness […] but to portray them, like an actor. As far as I’m concerned the paint is the person. I want it to work for me just as flesh does’ (Gowing, p.190-91). Aside from anonymous sitters, self-portraits, portraits of his lovers and a series of his mother, Freud also painted a number of eminent figures: Charles Clore, the Duke of Devonshire and Jacob Rothschild. In 1974, the Arts Council staged a retrospective of Freud’s work at the Hayward Gallery which included portraits of his friend and fellow painter Frank Auerbach. During this period, he also repeatedly painted his son Ali and daughters Rose, Isobel and Susie Boyt, as well as Bella and Esther Freud, his daughters with Bernardine Coverley. In the 1980s he resumed etching (initially to provide prints to help pay for the production costs of Lawrence Gowing’s monograph on him) and acquired 138 Kensington Church Street, where he filled the garden with ‘entanglements of buddleia and bamboo’ that served as a motif, devised with the advice of his close friend Susanna Chancellor, who was also an ‘exceptionally animated sitter’ (William Feaver, Lucian Michael Freud, Oxford DNB).\n\nIn 1987–8 the British Council organised Freud's first international retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC. In his catalogue introduction the critic Robert Hughes pronounced Freud 'the greatest living realist painter' (Hughes, p.8). The tour that followed, to the Hayward Gallery, the Centre Pompidou, Paris, and the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin, brought Freud widespread attention. Recent Work at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1993 was followed by a retrospective at Tate Britain in 2002 to mark his 80th birthday. Lucian Freud Portraits at the National Portrait Gallery, London, in 2012, planned for his 90th year, became his memorial exhibition.\n\nIn the 1990s Freud produced a number of large paintings of Australian performance artist Leigh Bowery and Sue Tilley, manager of a branch of the Department of Health and Social Security, the subject of Benefits Supervisor Resting,1994 and Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, 1995, which in 2008 sold at auction for £17.2 million to become, for a while, the most expensive painting by a living artist sold at auction. Freud, unlike Francis Bacon, accepted honours. He was appointed Companion of Honour in 1983, and a member of the Order of Merit in 1993. Partly to show his appreciation but more as a self-imposed challenge he undertook to paint HM Queen Elizabeth II, 2001, now in the Royal Collection. Lucian Freud died at his home in London, England on 20 July 2011 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery. His work is held in numerous UK public collections including the Arts Council Collection, the British Council Collection, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate and the V&A.\n\nRelated books\n\nWilliam Feaver, The Lives of Lucian Freud: Youth 1922-1968 (London: Bloomsbury, 2019)\n\nPeter Wakelin, Refuge and Renewal: Migration and British Art (Bristol: Sansom and Company, 2019)\n\nMark Holborn and David Dawson eds., Lucian Freud: a Life (London: Phaidon, 2019)\n\nGiovanni Aloi, Lucian Freud Herbarium (London: Prestel, 2019)\n\nLucian Freud: The Self-Portraits (London: Royal Academy of Arts, 2019)\n\nMartin Gayford, David Dawson and Mark Holborn eds., Lucien Freud, 2 Vols.
