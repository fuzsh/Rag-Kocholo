        "text": "In a Victorian house in North London on a recent afternoon, Frank Auerbach, one of Britain’s foremost painters, was working in his spartan, paint-spattered studio with a vigor belying his 91 years. The face of a self-portrait in charcoal, begun that day, looked out from an easel next to him with a mixture of vulnerability and stoicism. It was an impressive start, but the drawing was destined to be erased and recommenced, perhaps 50, a hundred times or more — like all Auerbach’s works.\n\n“It’s been going on like that for the last 70 years,” the reclusive artist said. “I’ve found myself simply not being able to accept what had come out on the canvas or the paper,,” he said. That process of destroying the works and trying again and again involved “a lot of swearing, a lot of anger, a lot of moaning,” Auerbach said. “I start always in the hope of picking up my brushes, putting an amazing momentous image on the canvas, and finishing the painting — and it’s never happened yet,” he said.\n\nSince the 1950s, Auerbach has been producing intense portraits and vivid London landscapes in thickly encrusted paint, often depicting the same model or scene over decades. At one time, he had six regular models. Now he sees two a week, for two-hour stints: William Feaver, the author of a monograph on the artist, and Catherine Lampert, an art historian and curator. Feaver has been coming to sit for Auerbach for 20 years; Lampert for 45.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
