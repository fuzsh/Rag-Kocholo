        "text": "British visual artist Lucian Freud died in London, on July 20th, after a long and successful, but controversial career, which left an unparalleled mark on the history of 20th century art.\n\nOne of the most representative talents of his generation, author of impactful and portraits disturbing, was one of the greatest expressions of figurative painting today.\n\nGrandson of Sigmund Freud, Lucian Michel Freud was born in Berlin on December 8, 1922. William Acquavella, trader and longtime friend, described him as “one of the most representative names of his generation, he managed to record individuals and landscapes with the same depth, drama and energy. He was an exciting, modest, warm and witty personality. He lived to paint and he painted until the day he died, away from the noise of the art world.”\n\nLucian dedicated his life to what he loved most: painting brilliant and unforgettable portraits of both celebrities and ordinary people. Queen Elizabeth II, his friend Lord Jacob Rothschild, Jerry Hall, singer Mick Jagger's ex-wife, and model Kate Moss were some of the personalities he immortalized in his portraits.\n\nThe painting of the English monarch (2001) – an unflattering portrait marked by a severe look – provoked controversial reactions. Praised by some, criticized by others, it generated the following comment from Arthur Edwards, photographer for the tabloid The Sun: “It should be hung in the bathroom.”\n\nWith his talent fully recognized, in 1989 he received the Turner Prize. His works reached very high prices at international auctions. The sale to the Russian tycoon, Roman Abramovich, during an auction in 2008, of the painting “Benefits Supervisor Sleeping”, from 1995, for US$33,6 million, made international headlines. Until then, no one had ever paid so much for a painting by a living artist. Lucian was not afraid to be bold in this work, portraying a morbidly obese woman without clothes. It would be the portrait of Sue Tilley, manager of an employment agency in Denmark, who weighed 127 kilos.\n\nAmong the awards and honors received, Lucian Freud was a member of the Order of Merit, one of the most prestigious orders of knights awarded by the Queen of England for great achievements in the fields of arts, literature and science. The honor is restricted to 24 members, including Florence Nightingale, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Elgar and Mother Teresa.\n\nThe early years\n\nHis trajectory could have been completely different and he could have become one more name on the list of victims of Nazism. In 1933, after Hitler's rise to power, his parents – architect Ernst Ludwig and Lucienne – made the decision to leave Berlin and start life again in Great Britain. His father, the last of Sigmund Freud's four children, was a committed Zionist and in 1927 visited what was then Palestine to build the house of Chaim Weizmann, who would become the first president of the modern State of Israel.\n\nThen aged 11, Lucian and his brothers Clement (who would later become a radio presenter and parliamentarian awarded the title of Sir) and Stephen accompanied their parents on their move to England, beginning a new chapter in the family's history.\n\nLucian, like his entire family, became a naturalized British citizen in 1939, definitively assuming the country as his home. During World War II, in 2, he joined the Merchant Navy for a brief period of time. But art has always been his passion. In 1941 he enrolled at the Central School of Arts, in London, the following year at the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing, in Debham, then run by the famous Cedric Morris, where he stayed until 1938, when he began studying at Goldsmiths's College (1942 -1942). Despite his love of art, Lucian attended few classes and, as a justification, said he felt lonely. Furthermore, he had difficulty with English and, above all, was considered temperamental. About this, he once said: “I confess that it made me very proud”.\n\nOwner of an undeniable talent, Lucian quickly began to have his works published. Between 1939 and 1943 he collaborated with the literary magazine Horizon, then edited by Cyril Connolly. He was only 17 years old when Connolly, already anticipating the success that was announced, agreed to publish his self-portrait. At the age of 21 he held his first solo exhibition at the Lefèvre Gallery. In 1946, the young artist decided to broaden his horizons, spending a year outside England between Paris and Greece, painting. From 1949 he began teaching at the Slade School of Fine Arts in London. With his return to the country, there was a new rise in success in his career. In 1951, he received the Festival Council of Great Britain Award for the work “Interior in Paddington”, then exhibited at the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, abstract painting was the dominant trend in art. milieu of the British avant-garde. Freud, however, was looking for his own style. His initial surrealist configurations of disproportionately sized animals and plants placed in domestic environments gave way to a mature realist focus translated into portraits and nudes. But Freud was neither alone nor outside the dominant movement in his search for the figurative. Among his artist friends were Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Leo Kossoff and RB Kitaj – a group that was later called the London School by the latter. Many of them were Jews, and for all of them the human figure was a significant concern.\n\nAlthough his friends in British art circles were Jewish and he spent his youth as a Jewish refugee, it is difficult to see Lucian Freud as a “Jewish artist.” And claiming this label for his art would be a very reductive search for a Jewish essence or, what would be more likely, a Jewish stereotype. Unlike Kitaj, Lucian did not explore Jewish issues or history; His figures show little ethnic identity and his paintings depict scant social or personal spaces beyond his studio.\n\nIn fact, his paintings seem like a softer echo of the movement of Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) from interwar Germany, in which tense figures of men and women embody the prevailing social and existential malaise. Judaism in the artist's career mainly exemplifies the modern success of the Diaspora: acculturation, secularism, national recognition and international approval.\n\nThe naked and raw reality\n\nPaddington was the London neighborhood chosen by the painter to set up his studio, where he remained for more than 30 years, then moving to the Parque Holland region.\n\nLucian's early works redefined British art and his later works are comparable to the work of the all-time greats of figurative art. Defined by close friends as being “a great companion” and “terribly intelligent”, he never worried about being modest, always just being himself. When he talked about his early works, he used to say that they had been the product of “concentrated and detailed observation”, of the act of opening one's eyes as close as possible to the object being examined.\n\nUntil the 1950s, flirting with surrealism, his paintings were considered relatively refined, both in technique and content, using thinner brushes and thinner paints. From the second half of the 1950s onwards, he began to modify his style and use more rustic brushes and thicker strokes, and bolder themes, resulting in works such as “Woman Smiling”, from 1959, defined by the curators of the Tate Gallery, in London, as a milestone in his work. Lucian's new style provoked different reactions from critics. Some considered it “shocking”, “violent” and “affected”.\n\nLucien met Francis Bacon in 1945, introduced by a mutual friend, the artist Graham Sutherland. Bacon had a great influence on his work, being credited with liberating Freud's style and stimulating his desire to portray human life. Bacon also painted several portraits of him, the first in 1951. Once, when referring to his friend's work, Lucian admitted to being impressed by Bacon's work and personality.\n\nOne of two portraits of Bacon painted by Freud (the other was stolen from an exhibition in Berlin in 1988) was sold in 2010 by Christie's auction house in London for US$9,4 million. The canvas, painted in 1956-57 offers a glimpse of the friendship between two of the greatest British artists of the 20th century.\n\nPortraying raw reality became one of the artist's most striking characteristics. In his quest to capture what he calls “another side of the human”, he exposed obese, disproportionate and wrinkled bodies in his works, in a kind of intensification of reality. Fat, ugly and old characters were recurrent in Lucian's paintings. They express the realization of the inexorability of aging, the weight of time on the body, the scars of personal histories. Between penetrating gazes and strong facial expressions, the artist captured Humanity in its raw state.\n\nHis creations were inspired by the people who were part of his life: family, friends and acquaintances, painters, lovers, children. His mother and daughters, Bella and Esther, posed for him. Lucian preferred amateur models to professionals who, in his words, really wanted to be there more than someone paid for this role. “I could never transmit something that wasn’t actually in front of me, physically and emotionally. It would not only be a lie, but also a huge fraud.” Therefore, for him, maintaining a close relationship with the models was important.\n\nThe creation process could last up to a year. During this period, the central focus of his life was the character in the work, but he was quickly replaced by someone different, for a new project. As he used to say, “the essential thing in a theme is autobiographical, it has everything to do with hope, memory and involvement in fact. I paint people I know, who interest me and care about, who I think about, in environments where I live and that I know well.” That's why he highlighted the importance of trust and intimacy with models and environments, a principle that accompanied him throughout his career. And he said: “For me, the painting is the person. I paint people not precisely as they appear, not precisely as they are, but as they should be.”\n\nIn 1974, he held his first retrospective, organized by the Arts Council of Great Britain, at the Hayward Gallery. In 1987, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington held an exhibition of Lucian's works and the event was considered, by The New York Times, a milestone for the painter's success in the United States.\n\nIn 2002, the Tate Gallery in London once again held a new exhibition of the artist, with great public and sales success. Currently, his works are mainly part of private collections, but some can be seen in public collections, such as the Southampton Art Gallery and the National Museum of Wales. There is a consensus among experts that he was one of the most important painters in contemporary English art, with his impactful works and disturbing portraits. For Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate group of British galleries, Lucian Freud has a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th century art."
