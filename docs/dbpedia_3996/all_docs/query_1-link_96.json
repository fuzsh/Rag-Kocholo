        "text": "This fascinating and bold study for Lucian Freud’s impressive 1946 oil on canvas, Man with a Thistle (Self-Portrait) (Tate collection) fleshes out the finished composition with detailed accuracy and artistic spontaneity. All aspects of Tate’s painting (purchased in 1961) are incorporated into this small monochrome design, so that the viewer is presented with an insightful snapshot of the artist’s working process.\n\nLucian Freud, ,Man with a Thistle, 1946 ,\n\n‘The artist shows himself looking through ,a window at a spiky thistle resting on a ,ledge in the foreground. At the same ,time, the thistle may also be read as an ,emblem occupying flattened space at the ,bottom of the painting. This ambiguity allows the thistle to be interpreted as a real object, but also as a device which ,suggests the mood of the painting and ,Freud’s own psychological state. (Tate Gallery label, September 2004) ,\n\nLucian Freud was one of the most significant portraitists of the last century, acclaimed Internationally. His portraits are both ruthless, coldblooded examinations and yet also intimate and impartial. This seemingly contradictory approach stemmed from seeing himself as “a sort of biologist”, interested in “the insides and undersides of things.” ₁\n\nHe refused to work from photographs as he stated, “the aura given out by a person or object is as much a part of them as their flesh. The effect that they make in space is as bound up with them as might be their colour or smell.”₂ Sitters had to be patient and prepared to be nocturnal, so inevitably this led to self-portraits. Freud depicted mirror images of himself throughout the breadth of his career and often referred to this process in titles, such as in the etching, Self-Portrait: Reflection. ,\n\nThis etching is an extraordinary portrait and display of technical command, the artist as in so many portraits, naked, filling the large plate from the chest upwards. Freud stood his copper plates upright on an easel from the mid 1980’s onwards and found he was able to work with greater force and fluidity. He claimed to find etching easier than drawing.\n\nSelf-Portrait: Reflection is uncompromising, the irregularities of the surface and lack of balance to his features are laid bare. The artist’s eyes scarcely visible but piercing, self-examining and yet also boring into the viewer. , ,\n\nFreud stated, “Many people are inclined to look at portraits not for the art in them but to see how they resemble people. This seems to me a profound misunderstanding.” ₃\n\nFrank Auerbach began to unravel this ‘misunderstanding’ in the Tate catalogue that accompanied Freud’s retrospective of 2002:\n\n‘When I think of the work of Lucian Freud, I think of Lucian’s attention to his subject. If his concentrated interest were to falter he would come off his tightrope, he has no safety net of manner. Whenever his way of working threatens to become a style, he puts it aside like a blunted pencil and finds a procedure more suited to his needs.I am never aware of the aesthetic paraphernalia. The subject is raw, not cooked to be more digestible as art, not covered in a gravy of ostentatious tone or colour, nor arranged on the plate as a ‘composition.’ ,The paintings live because their creator has been passionately attentive to their theme, and his attention has left something for us to look at. It seems a sort of miracle.’₄\n\n₁ Royal Academy Blog, 22nd October 2019\n\n₂ Lucian Freud: A Life, David Dawson and Mark Holborn, published by Phaidon, 2019\n\n₃ Freud cited in Cape, J., ,Freud at Work, Alfred Knopf, New York, 2006, p. 32\n\n₄ William Feaver, Lucian Freud, Tate Publishing, 2002, p.51\n\nLucian Freud was one of the most significant portraitists of the last century, acclaimed Internationally.
