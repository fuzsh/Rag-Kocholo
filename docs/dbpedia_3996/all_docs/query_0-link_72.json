Admission is free and open to the public and a reception with the artist will be held immediately after the program.\n\n“Jane McAdam Freud is an accomplished artist in her own right, and the daughter of Lucian Freud, one of the leading British painters of our time. She is also a direct descendant of the founder of Freudian psychoanalysis,” said Lewis Kachur, professor and fine arts program coordinator, Kean University. “Continuing in the tradition of the Arts Dialog series, the Fine Art and Art History programs bring leading contemporary artists to campus to share their ideas and creativity,” painters of our time. She is also a direct descendant of the founder of Freudian psychoanalysis.”\n\nJane McAdam Freud is an internationally acclaimed sculptor and multi-disciplinary artist with a career spanning over thirty years.
