        "text": "Family photographs, interviews, portraits and testimonies draw a detailed, intimate and complex portrait of the British painter in \"Lucian Freud: A life\", a biography signed by Mark Holborn and David Dawson, his assistant and heir.\n\nThe publication of this work (Phaidon, 2019) coincides with the opening this Sunday, October 27, of an exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London of his self-portraits and comes a year after the publication of a double object book on the work of the painter.\n\nCreated in close collaboration with the Lucian Freud Archive, the biography is divided chronologically, by decades, in a journey that begins in Germany, which he abandoned with his family fleeing the Nazis, and traces his youth, the uneven development of his career. , and the success of his last days.\n\nGrandson of the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, the artist is considered one of the best portrait painters of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, with a work marked by a strong psychological component.\n\n\"My mother said that my first word was 'alleine', which means 'alone',\" includes one of the quotes included in the autobiography, which throughout his life compulsively made portraits of both himself and others. people.\n\nFreud became obsessed with portraits, his own and those of other people; He only painted the people he wanted, he dedicated 12 months to each piece and always looked for the individuality of each person and each body.\n\nHe felt a strong attraction for naked bodies, which he captured through folded, flabby flesh, in raw and merciless tones.\n\n«I am interested in the animal side of people. Part of my taste for nude portraits comes from there, he admitted. This way I can see more, it is exciting to see the shapes repeat themselves throughout the body (….). \"I like people to look as natural and physical as an animal.\"\n\nThe book collects snapshots of Freud taken by celebrities such as Cecil Beaton, Clifford Coffin, Lord Snowdon and Brassaï. In others she appears alongside some of his most famous models such as Queen Elizabeth II, David Hockney or Francis Bacon.\n\nHe shared a strong friendship with Francis Bacon and always recognized that he was very influential in his career. \"Francis's free way of painting helped me be more daring,\" the artist explained. The publication includes 18 paintings by Freud about Bacon's work.\n\n«I want a painting to work like skin. My idea of ​​portraiture comes from dissatisfaction with how portraits look like people. “I want my paintings to be about people, not like them,” the publication states.\n\nThe book includes 150 illustrations of Freud's work, accompanied by texts that explain the historical framework in which he lived and worked. Among the texts are an interview with Leigh Bowery, a regular protagonist of his paintings, and a text by Rose Boyt, his daughter.\n\nThe biography is signed by the writer Mark Holborn and David Dawson, who was the long-time director of Freud's study and the Lucian Freud Archive. Last year he visited Madrid for the presentation of the double volume that brings together the artist's work.\n\n\"Freud loved meat and skin, even the skin of dogs, and he saw people as if they had an animal inside them,\" explained Dawson at the Thyssen Museum in Madrid, which is preparing a major exhibition of the artist for 2020.\n\nFreud's work, enigmatic and complex like his own character, is one of the most valued on the current market. In June 2018 one of the portraits of him reached the record of 22 million pounds (25 million euros / 28 million dollars).\n\n\"I'm not afraid of death, but rather that my work lasts,\" he used to say.
