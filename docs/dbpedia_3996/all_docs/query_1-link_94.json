        "text": "The undisputed master of the modern nude, Lucian Freud was also a prolific painter of plants. This exhibition will show how integral plants were to Freud’s work, exploring his ability to capture their elusive essence in original ways while giving them the same life as his human subjects.\n\nFreud was not a gardener but had a close and respectful relationship with plants, from rarely-seen drawings from his childhood in Berlin to his garden in Notting Hill, and the straggly potted plants that followed him from home to home throughout his life. The exhibition also explores why, and when, he chose to paint plants, and not people.\n\nExplore films, articles and more in our Lucian Freud: Plant Portraits online exhibition.\n\nIn Freud’s plant paintings yellowed leaves, blemishes, and tears are celebrated, distinctive traits demarcating the true identity of individual plants: and unique portraits capturing a history of shared growth entwining artist and plant.\n\nLucian Freud: Plant Portraits is curated by art historian and author of Lucian Freud Herbarium, Giovanni Aloi.\n\nHeader image – Two Plants, 1977-80 (oil on canvas) by Lucian Freud; Tate Modern, London © The Lucian Freud Archive.
