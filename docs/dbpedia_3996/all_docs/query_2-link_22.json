        "text": "Psychoanalysis describes searching the subconscious mind to find the origin of all thoughts, behaviors, and desires. Authors of many notable works of literature have used Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytical approach to further analyze their character 's inner thoughts and desires, and to give reasons for their faults and flaws. People tend to repress their shameful desires in the present, because they cause dissonance and because it makes them feel uncomfortable. Freud believed conflicts occur due to one’s repressed desires, which cause inconsistencies in the id, ego, and superego. The id describes the part of one’s unconscious personality which contains the primitive impulses, thrives off of the pleasure principle, and aids in helping people achieve their basic needs. The id serves as a part of one’s deep subconscious and exists as an inaccessible part of one’s personality, which one cannot control Contrary to the id, the superego describes the conscious part of human personality, which contains the morals and values of the society and tries to restrain one from engaging in behaviors that go against those values. Between the id and superego lies the ego, the mediator of “instinctual pleasure and societal authority” (Baym 210). The ego determines which desires to satisfy. When in harmony, the three create a stable and healthy personality, but when one offsets others and disobeys commands, guilt and shame occur. In the psychological romantic novel, The Scarlet Letter,\n\nQuite often psychobiography is dated as start with Freud’s Leonardo da Vinci and memory of his childhood (1910/1957). (Schultz, p. 23)All of this was lead o by Freud’s work on the “Delusions and Dreams” that was founded in Jensen’s novel titled “Gradiva”. (Schultz, p. 23) Beginning approximately four months after Freud’s “Delusions and Dreams” was published in 1907; Freud had decided to take a well needed trip to Rome. (Valedictorian) While in Rome Freud saw the sculpture (basso-relievo) that represented “Gradiva” on display at their museum called “The Museum of the Vatican”. (Valedictorian) Freud then purchased his own personal copy of the basso-relievo. (Valedictorian) Freud did this as others such as the author Wilhelm Jensen and the fictional Norbert had done previously before him. (Valedictorian) Freud had this great idea to hang this item, which is to be remembered, in his office that happened to be located in Vienna. (Valedictorian)This sculpture stayed in his office until he left Vienna and took it with him to London in 1938. (Valedictorian)\n\nAnna Freud was born on December 3, 1895 in Vienna, Austria. Freud was the sixth and last child of Sigmund Freud and Martha Bernays. She followed the path of her father and contributed to the newly born field of psychoanalysis. Alongside Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of Psychoanalytic Child Psychology. Freud appeared to have a very unhappy childhood. She had a very tense and disturbed relationship with her mother. As a baby, her mother didn't really take care of her, she was really nurtured by her Catholic nurse, Josephine. Her mother wasn't the only one she had trouble with, Freud had issues with her siblings as well. Her sister, Sophie Freud, had the good looks while Anna had the “brains”. As well as a rivalry between the\n\n“Every emotion must be dealt with artistically, if it is to succeed in being serviceable in a sure, lasting and appropriate way. “(Novalis, Fragmentserie 1798) If symbolisation in human expression is closely related in human development to internalized images in one’s self, then imagery in dreams and in Art, must be composed of various internalized images. Fascinated by Freud’s ‘Dream-work’ study; the study that dreams serve as valuable clues to how the unconscious mind operates, I then compared it to similar assumptions of artwork. And that artwork can represent the repressed or internalized ideas of the subconscious. The lecture given by Anna Madison on Dreams and Nightmares in art sparked my interest on this topic, leading me to build my own analysis of an artist depicting the subject of\n\nSigmund Freud believed that humans are innately aggressive and sexually driven beings from birth. Therefore, he determined that parents play a crucial role in managing the inappropriate urges a child has, as well as teaching them appropriate ways to express their urges. To further explain this idea, one must understand Freud’s three personality structures, the id, ego, and superego. The id is the unconscious part of our mind where a person’s primary instincts are held, as well as where inappropriate desires are stored. The superego is the level where a human stores morals, ideals, or standards that are placed on them by their parents or society. The ego, otherwise known as the “reality principle” (Sougstad, 2017),\n\nFreud and Erikson have similar but at the same time different ways of covering the Theories of Development. They may be from different backgrounds, different schools, worked at different jobs, but they both viewed development as something of importance. They both thought that they had the correct theory, and they both thought that they new best at what was suppose to happen between the different stages. Sigmund Freud had only five stages of development whereas Erik Erikson had eight. Erikson went through adulthood and Freud did not. They both can make some good points in their stages but, like any theory, there are complications or problems.\n\nFreud was born into a wealthy Jewish family. He was the eldest of six children, and was know to be the family favorite, nicknamed the “golden child.” At the age of four, Freud was forced to move from the Czech Republic to Vienna (Sigmund Freud Biography). There, Freud and his family lived in a crowded Jewish ghetto. As Freud grew older, he drifted further from the notion of an “average” child. Rather than playing, Freud preferred studying and learning during his free time. He soon grew interested in the way the mind works and how dreams are formulated. As a result, he kept a detailed dream diary, and in the morning, when Freud got up, he wrote down his dreams while they were still fresh in his mind (Chiriac). Later, in 1873, he started studying to get his medical degree. He studied the sexual organs of eels, which drove Freud to become a research scientist. Sigmund Freud then started to work at Vienna’s General Hospital where he became engrossed in the study of human\n\nI have always considered myself to be an “out of the box” thinker. I usually look on the bigger picture and all the possible “what ifs” my mind could conjure. However, I have learned some things this semester that really put me in check. Things that caused me to stop and think and readjust the way I view the world. I still think that Freud’s theories are absurd but now I don’t dismiss them. I have learned through the tenure of the course that everyone has a story and even Freud is worth the benefit of the doubt. I even realized that as soon as I allowed myself to start seeing things differently, I started finding aspects of his theories that were applicable to my life and to the youth I work with in my placement. Despite my ill-feelings towards Freud and his absurdity, I must say that because of his work I have become more aware of myself. For example, I am an avid doodler, I doodle anytime and everywhere, and I never get embarrassed if I am caught. Now I look at my doodles differently, I find myself stopping in the middle of my doodling to become mindful of what I was scribbling because according to Freud, doodling is a kind of visual free association, a way of tapping into the deep reservoir of self-knowledge contained not in words but in images. Prior to this new insight, doodling was just something I do when I was bored or when I wanted to stay awake during a long meeting or lecture."
