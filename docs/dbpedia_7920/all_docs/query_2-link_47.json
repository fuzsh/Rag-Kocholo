        "text": "You Are Here: An Immersive Film Experience\n\nNew York is one of the most filmed cities on earth. Generations of moviegoers have seen New York depicted and distorted, celebrated and denigrated, idealized and mocked, built up and demolished over and over again on the big screen. Over the past 100 years, legions of filmmakers have drawn attention to New Yorkers’ joys and struggles, shaping our ideas of what the city is—or could become.\n\nYOU ARE HERE draws on this rich archive of movies set in New York, combining thousands of cinematic moments across 16 screens. Sources include Hollywood blockbusters, independent films, documentaries, and experimental works. By juxtaposing these multiple visions, the dazzling montages of YOU ARE HERE make connections and contrasts that allow movies to comment on each other across time and space. Together, they shed new light on the varied New Yorks of our collective imagination.\n\nSometimes New York stars in these movies; sometimes, a studio set or even another city stands in. In the introductory room, Scenes from the City explores the city as a film set, showing how movies have been captured on location throughout the five boroughs. From there, we invite you to enter the immersive central space, where you can explore a narrative tapestry woven from hundreds of films—one impressionistic storyline that strives to represent the multifaceted realities of our countless New York stories.\n\nSCENES FROM THE CITY: FILMMAKING IN NEW YORK\n\nSince the birth of the film industry over a century ago, New York has been one of the world’s most popular settings, subjects, and sources of inspiration for moviemakers of all kinds. But New York has not always been the location of the actual shooting. In the early 20th century, silent films were shot on location all over the city, but the arrival of sound in the late 1920s shifted feature film production almost entirely to Southern California, where an extraordinary invented New York was brought into being on the stages and backlots of Hollywood studios. It was only in the years after World War II that filmmakers returned to the streets and sidewalks of the real city, and a New York-based film industry arose again.This gallery highlights behind-the-scenes stills of feature films being made in the city since the 1940s. The images reveal how advancing technology, the creative aspirations of filmmakers and performers, innovative governmental agencies, and the abiding worldwide appeal of New York as a filmic setting have combined to produce a dynamic, ever-evolving portrait of the city’s physical landscape, cultural richness, and social complexity.\n\nTop\n\nPlay Ball\n\nUnknown photographer, 1925\n\nReproduction\n\nMarc Wanamaker – Bison Archives\n\nIn the movies’ silent period, lightweight cameras, the extensive use of natural lighting, and the absence of sound equipment allowed filmmakers to roam freely across the real city’s landscape. In this view the actress Allene Ray hangs from a false parapet atop a roof in the West 40s of Manhattan, with only a mattress below to offer some minimal protection.\n\nLeft\n\nThe Fountainhead\n\nUnknown photographer, 1949\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nTo recreate the Manhattan skyline on Hollywood soundstage sets, art directors produced colossal scenic paintings called “backings.” In this shot, taken between setups at Warner Bros., grips remove a backing behind the desk of the New York press baron played by Raymond Massey.\n\nMiddle\n\nLife with Father\n\nJack Woods, 1947\n\nReproduction\n\nMarc Wanamaker – Bison Archives\n\nIn the studio era of the 1930s and ’40s, every Hollywood backlot included a “New York Street” set, with false facades lining a central street and sidewalk. For Life with Father, set in the 1880s, Warner Bros. built a stretch of Madison Avenue rowhouses on their lot in Burbank, California.\n\nRight\n\nBroadway Melody of 1936\n\nUnknown photographer, 1935\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe Hollywood studio era’s “mythic city” came to a pinnacle in the glamorous rooftop nightclubs that seemed to top every skyscraper in Manhattan. Here a crew films Eleanor Powell on an MGM nightclub set, surrounded by a curved scenic backing known as cyclorama.\n\nHOLLYWOOD COMES TO TOWN\n\nIn the years after World War II, a handful of pioneering Hollywood filmmakers began shooting movie scenes—and in some cases entire movies—on location in New York City. Their work was enabled by technical improvements in cameras, film stock, and lighting and sound equipment and encouraged by the changing tastes of audiences, who sought a greater degree of realism after exposure to wartime newsreels and documentaries and postwar neorealist features from Europe. Hollywood studios brought directors, actors, and crews to the streets and spaces of New York City to capture their fictional narratives on the real urban landscape.\n\nTop\n\nThe Naked City\n\nStanley Kubrick, 1948\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe first studio feature to be made primarily in New York in two decades, this film was shot over the summer of 1947 on 107 locations (including this chase on the Williamsburg Bridge). The logistics pushed the film a half million dollars over budget, but its enormous popular and critical success demonstrated the appeal of New York as a film location.\n\nLeft\n\nOn the Town\n\nUnknown photographer, 1949\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThough the film was made mostly at MGM studios in Hollywood, its ten-minute “New York, New York” number broke ground as the first to synchronize music and dance on location. The sequence follows three sailors (Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin) energetically touring the city—including Rockefeller Center, where crowds lined up to watch the filming.\n\nMiddle\n\nThe World, the Flesh, and the Devil\n\nUnknown photographer, 1959\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nAn interracial Cold War parable about the three survivors of an atomic attack, the film included haunting scenes of its star, Harry Belafonte, wandering the empty streets of Manhattan. They were either filmed between 5:30 and 6:00 a.m. before workers arrived or filmed upward, like this view in the Financial District.\n\nRight\n\nNorth by Northwest\n\nKenny Bell, 1959\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThough Alfred Hitchcock generally preferred to work in the controlled confines of a studio stage, he brought a crew to the real Grand Central Terminal to film Cary Grant trying to board a train unnoticed among the busy crowds of the Main Concourse. Hundreds of New Yorkers watch the shoot from the balcony, unseen by the camera.\n\nTHE MYTHIC CITY\n\nBy the 1950s and early ’60s, many of the most celebrated scenes in American movies were being created on location in New York. Iconic filmic moments once received by New Yorkers from a mysterious place a continent away—Hollywood—were now carved from the city’s own days, months, and seasons. From the frigid winter piers of On the Waterfront to the hot summer playgrounds of West Side Story to the balmy September sidewalk of The Seven Year Itch, legendary directors and famed stars transformed New York into a mythic urban place. Designed to appeal to national, largely white audiences and produced mostly by mainstream Hollywood studios, the new “movie New York” captured the world’s imagination—even if rarely reflecting the growing ethnic and racial diversity of the city itself.\n\nTop\n\nWest Side Story\n\nErnst Haas and Phil Stern, 1961\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nChoreographer and director Jerome Robbins demonstrates a dance move to George Chakiris (left) and Jose De Vega. Shooting on tenement blocks about to be demolished for Lincoln Center, the filmmakers used the city’s locations to bring a documentary-style authenticity to their Hollywood production. Like nearly all studio-made films of the era, it cast mostly white actors (like Chakiris) to play its Puerto Rican and other non-white characters.\n\nLeft\n\nWest Side Story\n\nErnst Haas and Phil Stern, 1961\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nBefore the cameras rolled each morning, New Yorkers were amused to see the film’s supposedly violent teenage gangs performing classical ballet exercises, using a tenement railing as a makeshift barre.\n\nMiddle\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nUnknown photographer, 1954\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nFor his film about corruption in the Port of New York and New Jersey, the director Elia Kazan brought his crew to Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, to shoot on its streets, its piers, and a tenement rooftop—where in this image Kazan, kneeling at center, speaks with the film’s star, Marlon Brando.\n\nRight\n\nThe Seven Year Itch\n\nSam Shaw, 1955\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe most famous location shoot of the era was the September 15, 1954, nighttime filming of Marilyn Monroe on Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street, as the breeze from a subway grate lifted her summer dress. Thousands watched as director Billy Wilder (left) called for take after take—only to later replace the footage with a studio-shot version of the scene.\n\nA NEW ERA IS BORN\n\nBy 1965 location shooting in New York was slowing down. Major studios—deterred by union pressure, costly police handouts, and uncooperative city agencies—produced only two features fully in the city. In May 1966 newly elected Mayor John V. Lindsay established the world’s first government agency of its kind, the Mayor’s Office of Film, Theatre, and Broadcasting, along with a special Motion Pictures Unit of the Police Department. The result was a sudden explosion in film production and the start of a new New York-based film industry, whose leading figures included independent filmmakers, directors from abroad, and a new group of Black directors, including Gordon Parks and Ossie Davis.\n\nTop\n\nA Thousand Clowns\n\nUnknown photographer, 1965\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nOne of only two features produced in New York that year, the film sought to “open up” the Broadway hit it was based on through extensive location shooting of its stars (Jason Robards and Barry Gordon) wandering around the city, including the aging East River piers shown here.\n\nLeft\n\nUp the Down Staircase\n\nUnknown photographer, 1967\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nIn the first years after founding the Mayor’s Film Office, Mayor Lindsay made regular visits to New York shoots, including the East Harlem set of Up the Down Staircase, where he posed for photographs with the film’s young cast, star Sandy Dennis (pointing), and writer Bel Kaufman (seated).\n\nMiddle\n\nCotton Comes to Harlem\n\nUnknown photographer, 1970\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nDirected by the pioneering Black actor and filmmaker Ossie Davis, the film follows two detectives across the length of Harlem, offering a sympathetic portrait of the legendary district. Here a local crowd gathers to watch the filming of a charismatic funeral director in an old-fashioned morning suit.\n\nRight\n\nMidnight Cowboy\n\nMartin Munkácsi, 1969\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe flood of films shot in New York after the founding of the Mayor’s Office included many showing the city in a decidedly unflattering light. Directed by the Englishman John Schlesinger (in a dark shirt in the foreground), Midnight Cowboy portrayed a hustler from Texas (Jon Voight) whose attempts to solicit women include this moment on Park Avenue.\n\nTHE NEW YORK AUTEUR\n\nThe growth of a New York-based film industry soon gave rise to a new kind of American moviemaker, whose personal, location-shot films—which they often wrote and acted in as well as directed—turned the city into not only a setting but a subject. By the 1980s, three distinctively “New York” filmmakers, Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, and Spike Lee, seemed to embody the breadth of the city—from Scorsese’s lower Manhattan to Allen’s Upper East Side to Lee’s Brooklyn—as well as its range of Jewish, Italian, and Black cultures. Meanwhile, a fourth New York auteur, Nora Ephron, began bringing her own glowing vision of the city to the screen.\n\nTop\n\nDo the Right Thing\n\nDavid Lee, 1989\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nSpike Lee, the film’s writer, director, and leading actor—as a pizza delivery worker—is captured in a dolly shot as he walks down the Bedford-Stuyvesant block that is the film’s sole setting.\n\nLeft\n\nAnnie Hall\n\nBrian Hamill, 1977\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe now-controversial writer and director Woody Allen was also a leading actor in his Oscar-winning film, playing opposite Diane Keaton in the title role. In this view the two are filmed walking down East 70th Street on the Upper East Side, one of Allen’s preferred New York settings.\n\nMiddle\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nJosh Weiner and Paul Kimatian, 1976\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe film’s location shoot across the summer of 1976—just months after the city skirted bankruptcy—was one of the most fraught and intense in the city’s history. In this view Martin Scorsese directs Robert De Niro and Cybill Shepherd in front of a pornographic movie house on West 42nd Street.\n\nRight\n\nYou’ve Got Mail\n\nBrian Hamill, 1998\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nThe film’s director and co-writer, Nora Ephron, instructs the romantic leads, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, for the film’s climactic scene, shot in the 91st Street Garden in Riverside Park.\n\nTHE STREET AS STAGE\n\nAs actual New York streets replaced the backlot “New York Streets” of the studio era, the ordinary city block became a primary arena of movie New York, compressing the vastness of the five-borough metropolis into a compact, comprehensible, and surprisingly scenic setting. For filmmakers the street offered an ideal platform to capture the daily texture of life in the city—or serve as an impromptu stage for larger-than-life happenings. It could also provide an effective marker of the profound forces driving urban change—from disinvestment and abandonment to revitalization and gentrification.\n\nTop\n\nDog Day Afternoon\n\nMartin Munkácsi, 1975\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nDirected by veteran New York director Sidney Lumet, the film was shot almost entirely on a single block in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn—not far from the site of the actual bank robbery that inspired the story. Lumet transforms the street into a kind of outdoor stage, with the robber Al Pacino as the star, detectives as supporting actors, and the raucous crowds of Brooklyn onlookers as the audience.\n\nLeft\n\nThe Landlord\n\nUnknown photographer, 1970\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nAs cinematographer Gordon Willis (with framing lens on chain) looks on, a wealthy suburbanite (Lee Grant) warily greets the tenants of a rundown rowhouse on Prospect Place in Brooklyn’s Park Slope—still a poor, largely Black neighborhood at the time— that has been purchased by her son, played by Beau Bridges.\n\nMiddle\n\nJumpin’ at the Boneyard\n\nUnknown photographer, 1991\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nA camera and dolly follow two brothers (Tim Roth and Alexis Arquette) on their journey through the burned-out streets of the South Bronx, still devastated from the epidemic of arson and abandonment of the late 1970s.\n\nRight\n\nIn the Heights\n\nMacall Polay, 2021\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Director\n\nJon M. Chu shoots Lin-Manuel Miranda—the film’s composer and producer—playing a struggling piragua (shaved-ice) vendor on 175th Street in Washington Heights, a Dominican and Puerto Rican district at the northern end of Manhattan.\n\nSTELLAR GLIMPSES\n\nAs filming in New York grew ever more popular—propelled by the efforts of the Mayor’s Film Office, improvements to technology and logistics, the creative aspirations of directors, and audience preference—location shoots became a regular part of the urban landscape. New Yorkers and visitors commonly came across the production trucks, lights, cranes, booms, video playback equipment, harried production assistants, armies of craftspeople, and, not least, world-famous movie stars that marked a feature film in production. Some grumbled at the imposition. Others lingered excitedly to watch the stars, not only during the active scenes but, even more tantalizingly, during the quiet moments in between.\n\nTop\n\nThe Pick-up Artist\n\nBrian Hamill, 1987\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nTaken between setups by the noted stills photographer Brian Hamill on a side street off Columbus Avenue on the Upper West Side, this view captures a contemplative moment between the film’s two leads, Molly Ringwald and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nLeft\n\nDesperately Seeking Susan\n\nAndrew Schwartz, 1985\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nDuring a break on location in the East Village early in the film’s shooting, Madonna—still a downtown cult figure—autographs a fan’s skateboard. During the ten weeks of filming, director Susan Seidelman later recalled, the popularity of Madonna’s music videos exploded and the set soon needed extra security.\n\nMiddle\n\nInside Man\n\nUnknown photographer, 2006\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nBetween setups on a nighttime shoot on Beaver Street amidst the stony canyons of the Financial District of lower Manhattan, the film’s star, Denzel Washington, enjoys a private joke with director Spike Lee.\n\nRight\n\nOne Fine Day\n\nGemma LaMana and Myles Aronowitz, 1996\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nIn an off-camera moment while filming in SoHo, the film’s star, George Clooney, relaxes with a basketball and chats with a crew member while sitting in a folding wood-and-canvas director’s chair that has been a fixture of location shoots for a century or more.\n\nALTERNATIVE TRADITIONS\n\nEven as studios increasingly produced their major releases in New York, alternative traditions flourished on its streets. Dating to the start of postwar filmmaking in New York, low-budget, independently financed features provided an invaluable avenue for city-bred talent, including New York University film graduates Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee, Susan Seidelman, Ang Lee, Jim Jarmusch, Darnell Martin, Peter Smollett, and Eva Vives. Alert to alternative ways of making films—from Italian Neorealism and the French New Wave to pioneering cinema-verité documentaries made in and around New York—these indie filmmakers recognized that the city itself could serve as an inexpensive yet visually compelling set. Transcending their tight budgets, independent filmmakers ingeniously transformed a wide range of urban locations into filmic settings and employed a diverse range of New Yorkers—in front of and behind the camera—to realize their visions.\n\nTop\n\nCity Island\n\nPhilip Caruso, 2009\n\nReproduction\n\nPhoto by www.philipcaruso.net\n\nFor a story inspired by his own family in the Bronx, writer and director Raymond De Felitta found independent financing to work in the self-contained northern Bronx community of the title.

In the early 1960s New York filmmakers including the Maysles, Robert Drew, Ricky Leacock, and D.A. Pennebaker, pioneered ways to synchronize sound recording to lightweight 16mm cameras, allowing them to capture scenes of daily life almost anywhere. Their free-ranging documentary style—known as cinema-verité—soon exerted a profound influence on the city’s independent filmmakers.\n\nRight\n\nOne People\n\nAli Santana, 2007\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nCombining documentary-style footage with a fictional story of two sisters on a search for the contemporary relevance of the Black playwright Lorraine Hansberry, the short film One People was shot largely on the streets of Harlem, where in this view the director Alfred Santana (at right) oversees a modest crew.\n\nLOCATION AS SPECTACLE\n\nEver since feature films began shooting on location in New York in the late 1940s, crowds of curious onlookers have themselves provided a compelling urban spectacle. The gathering of New Yorkers at locations for The Naked City in 1947 proved an irresistible subject for the young LOOK magazine photographer Stanley Kubrick (who was also observing the filming process for his own later career as a director). Where location shoots were once happened upon accidentally or by local word-of-mouth, in recent years websites and social media have drawn fans and paparazzi from around the city to high-profile shoots—a new kind of New York tourist attraction that is also an integral part of the city’s media machinery and culture of celebrity.\n\nTop\n\nSex and the City: The Movie\n\nCraig Blankenhorn, 2008\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nFor the feature-film version of the popular New York-based television series, hundreds of onlookers—alerted by social media and websites— fill both sides of Fifth Avenue to watch Sarah Jessica Parker in bridal attire ascend the steps of the New York Public Library.\n\nLeft\n\nThe Lost Weekend\n\nUnknown photographer, 1945\n\nReproduction\n\nMarc Wanamaker – Bison Archives\n\nIn early October 1945, New Yorkers witnessed the first studio location scene shot in the city in nearly two decades: an alcoholic writer (Ray Milland) staggering down Third Avenue to find a pawnshop to sell his typewriter for drink money—unaware that all the shops have closed for Yom Kippur.\n\nMiddle and Right\n\nThe Naked City\n\nStanley Kubrick, 1948\n\nReproduction\n\nMuseum of the City of New York.

For LOOK magazine a young Stanley Kubrick captured portraits of New Yorkers watching the climactic chase on Delancey Street on the Lower East Side.\n\nACTION IN THE STREETS\n\nSince the birth of modern location shooting in the 1940s, filmmakers have taken advantage of the extraordinary urban landscape of New York, whose busy streets, towering skyscrapers, elevated and underground subway lines, and soaring suspension bridges offer a dynamic, three-dimensional setting like few others in the world. Over the decades, ever more ambitious action scenes—including stunts, chases, and flying sequences that were once the near-exclusive province of studio lot—have been carried out on location in New York, aided in recent years by sophisticated digital techniques that can clean up filmed sequences in post-production to make them appear entirely realistic.\n\nTop\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man\n\nNiko Tavernise, 2012\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nTo stage a spectacular fight scene in the Marvel-produced sequel, filmmakers received permission from the Mayor’s Office to close Park Avenue for a Sunday morning location shoot.\n\nAbove Far Right\n\nFourteen Hours\n\nUnknown photographer, 1951\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nBased on a real-life 1938 incident, the film focused on a disturbed man (Richard Basehart) threatening to jump from a hotel window ledge, photographed with a stunt double on the face of an actual office building at 140 Broadway.\n\nAbove Left\n\nThe Other Guys\n\nMacall Polay, 2010\n\nReproduction\n\n© 2010 Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.

The effect was to turn New York into the grandest possible stage for musical numbers. For decades since, the city’s public spaces have come alive with performances large and small, from the unstructured energy of Fame or Blue in the Face to the precise choreography of West Side Story or In the Heights—whose main character, Usnavi (Anthony Ramos) tells us that in New York, “the streets were made of music.”\n\nTop\n\nWest Side Story\n\nNiko Tavernise, 2021\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nFor their remake of the original 1961 film, Steven Spielberg and his production team, unable to find suitable late-1950s period locations in the West 60s blocks of Manhattan—long since demolished for Lincoln Center—transformed the Harlem intersection of 113th Street and St. Nicolas Avenue into the setting for the film’s exuberant “America” dance number.\n\nLeft\n\nFame\n\nHolly Bower and Catharine Bushnell, 1980\n\nReproduction\n\nCourtesy of Photofest\n\nAs startled Midtown office workers look on, actors playing students from the High School of Performing Arts spill out onto West 46th Street, bringing traffic to a halt with an impromptu music and dance number.\n\nMiddle\n\nBlue in the Face\n\nK.C.
