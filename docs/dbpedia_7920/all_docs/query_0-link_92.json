        "text": "In November 1928, The Terror came to Britain’s cinemas, and things would never be quite the same again. The Jazz Singer had ushered in the era of sound cinema with a few scenes of synchronised dialogue and music, but The Terror, a murder mystery set in an English country house, was the real deal: the first continuous “all-talkie” to show in Europe. Many of the London critics loathed it, labelling it “so bad that it is almost suicidal”. In the Observer, CA Lejeune approached the trouble with talkies head on: “We may deplore limitations of language for the hitherto universal cinema,” she wrote in her review. “We may dread the invasion of more sound into an already rowdy world.” But she knew that resistance was useless. “A new chapter of film evolution is beginning … I cannot think that, once having heard the voice, we shall ever be satisfied with the dumb figures of our favourites again.”\n\nAt the 18th British silent film festival, which was held in Leicester earlier this month, we had the chance to experience the turmoil of the coming of sound for ourselves. A broad strip of the weekend’s programme was devoted to Britain’s response to the US invasion of talking pictures – from faltering experiments to the first sound successes. Laraine Porter and Geoff Brown, who are leading a research project on Britain’s silent cinema and the transition to sound, guided us through a series of bewildering and often brilliant films.\n\nThe advent of the talkies was gradual – much slower than it looks in Singin’ in the Rain in 1952. Sound films had been around since 1926, thanks to sound-on-disc technology (using a device such as a phonograph to play music in sync with a film) rather than optical sound (which combined audio and visual information in one film strip). But sound was used mostly for music, effects or short sequences of dialogue. Continuous talking features were another matter. New equipment, studios and methods were required to make such films and cinemas needed new speakers and projectors to show them. When The Terror opened in London, British studios had a slate of silent films already made or in production, and at that point only one cinema in the city – the Piccadilly on Denman Street – was wired for sound. It had just been bought by US studio Warner Bros.\n\nThe “talker wave” quickly became an British-American conflict. The rush to accommodate the new innovation was combined with efforts to stop it from leading to a glut of American films and electronics in British cinemas. The Cinematograph Films Act of 1927 aimed to protect the UK industry with a quota system, and it soon became imperative that Britain should make its own talkies to compete with US imports. As a stopgap, silent movies were retrofitted with dialogue sequences to perk them up. (These were called “goat-gland” pictures in a reference to a notorious treatment for male impotence.) But there was increasing pressure on the British film industry to produce its own full-length sound features, and the first studio to do so would win all the glory.\n\nThe “year of the big upheaval”, in Geoff Brown’s words, was 1929. British studios scrambled to assemble soundstages, proofed against the cacophony of silent film production; cinemas dithered over whether to invest in speaker systems (and if so, which system to buy); film-makers grappled with the difficulties of using a new method of production; actors fretted about how their voices “recorded”; musicians across the UK faced the imminent loss of their livelihood; and cinema audiences attempted to make sense of a new – and struggling – form of entertainment.\n\nIt’s notable that amid all this pressure, many of Britain’s first talkies, from Alfred Hitchcock’s masterful 1929 thriller Blackmail onwards, were lurid potboilers crammed with sex and violence. Britain’s first sound films were much headier than the sparkling backstage musicals that US studios offered during the same period and the British silents that preceded them. In Leicester, we saw clips from two silents remade as talkies: an exotic thriller called White Cargo (1929), which was set in a rubber plantation and appeared to be both a clunky treatment of a mixed-race love affair and a study of the terrors of wet rot, and To What Red Hell (1929), in which a young man with epilepsy is racked with murderous impulses.\n\nWe watched sound feature The W Plan (1930) in full, with dashing Brian Aherne as a British spy behind German lines. His conversations with lost love Madeleine Carroll are disappointingly static, but the film warms up as he gets stuck into some serious sabotage. A nightmare about facing the firing squad is particularly chilling, with a diagram of the enemy scheme he is trying to thwart distorting the faces of the German soldiers. Domestic horror Dark Red Roses (1929), in which jealousy drives Stewart Rome to violence, benefited from much more naturalistic dialogue, despite its histrionic plot. Director Sinclair Hill saw how well the improvised lines of the child actors (an early role for future director Jack Clayton and his sister) went over and also allowed the rest of the cast to “gag” or ad lib. “The idea came to him straight from heaven,” revealed Nerina Shute in Film Weekly.\n\nFar more successful, and charming, were two films by Jack Raymond. Splinters (1929) was an occasionally risque musical reconstructing a popular army revue or “concert party” from the first world war – complete with saucy gags and “supported by beauty chorus of 40 and everyone of them a perfect gentleman!” – including famed female impersonator Reg Stone. The Great Game (1930) was a heartwarming football drama filmed at Stamford Bridge and Wembley with top-flight soccer players in supporting roles.\n\nThe most intriguing film shown from this period was Windjammer (1930), in which two young journalists intended to be a silent documentary record of one of the last commercial sailing ship voyages, following the Grace Harwar from Australia to England. Precious little of their stunning footage remains in the dramatic talkie that was spun out of it in a Soho brainstorm. Still, the narrative is genuinely moving, with a shy upper-class Brit (Tony Bruce) joining the crew for the journey home with a rough-edged company providing comic relief. One of the journalists lost his life during the voyage of the Grace Harwar, and his burial at sea is woven touchingly into the drama.\n\nTony Bruce’s name is all but forgotten now, partly because he died so young, but he reappeared in the best of the festival’s talkies: Anthony Asquith and Geoffrey Barkas’s Gallipoli drama Tell England (1931). Based on the same novel by Ernest Raymond that inspired Peter Weir’s picture Gallipoli 50 years later, this is a blistering film, with grandstanding action sequences strung together by the story of a friendship between two public schoolboys destined for the “most thrilling front”. The beach landings sequence – which must surely have influenced Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan – is a furious collage that combines the best silent cinematic techniques with a bombardment of deftly handled sound. A contemporary review in the Times saw quite rightly that the film was best when sound was used “impressionistically”, rather than to “convey information or to illustrate character”.\n\nTwo years after the “big upheaval”, film-makers and critics alike had reached a point where sound was no longer a novelty and talkies had become movies. Tell England is one of the era’s first British masterpieces and should really be more widely shown.\n\nHere are three great British movies from the cusp of sound, which are a little easier to find.\n\nBlackmail (1929)\n\nAlfred Hitchcock directed Britain’s first homemade talkie, which remains one of his greatest films. This dark, London-set thriller was to be a silent film with sound scenes inserted, but the ambitious young director shot two complete versions instead. Both are excellent films. Despite the limitations of the technology and the cast and crew’s inexperience, the talkie Blackmail boasts pacey dialogue and sophisticated sound design, such as when repeated mentions of the word “knife” weigh heavy on our heroine’s conscience. One less impressive technique was the dubbing of star Anny Ondra’s Czech accent with the plummy tones of Joan Barry. The dubbing was performed live, with Ondra mouthing her lines on set and Barry projecting her voice from a few feet away off-camera. Remarkably, it works. And Ondra’s awkward voice test reveals why Hitchcock thought it necessary.\n\nHigh Treason (1929)\n\nThe trade press reported that Maurice Elvey – still Britain’s most prolific film director – was racing Alfred Hitchcock neck-and-neck to produce Britain’s first full talkie. This stylish drama about the threat of a second world war decades in the future may have lost the race to Hitchcock’s Blackmail, but has far more synchronised dialogue. As Hitchcock did with Blackmail, Elvey shot a silent and a sound version of High Treason (both of which are available to stream on the BFI Player). In both cuts, High Treason offers an abundance of retro-futurist joys, from outlandish costumes to now-familiar innovations such as video calling, synthesisers and the Eurostar.\n\nA Cottage on Dartmoor (1929)\n\n“Would you like to go to a talkie with me tonight?” is the key chat-up line in this romantic thriller by Anthony Asquith. And go to a talkie they do, with unpleasant results, in this “goat-gland” film from late 1929. The soundtrack for A Cottage on Dartmoor’s two talkie scenes have not survived with the rest of the film, which doesn’t dent one’s understanding of the plot. In the first, Sally, a manicurist portrayed by Norah Baring, plays piano while her infatuated colleague watches and attempts to pounce on her. In the second, she takes up that offer and goes to the pictures with a more suitable suitor, while her admirer lurks nearby in the dark. But Sally’s love life is nothing to the ructions that take place in the cinema when the sound film begins to play. As the orchestra performers yawn and eat their sandwiches, the baffled audience, who were a moment ago united in giggles in front of Harold Lloyd, strain to follow the action, becoming, angry, distracted and bored. Asquith’s attempt to show the superiority of silent films chimes with the direction of his career. His silent films, such as this one, are far more exciting and experimental than the bulk of his output in the sound era, Tell England excluded."
