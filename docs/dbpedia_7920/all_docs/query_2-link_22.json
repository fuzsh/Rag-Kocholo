        "text": "Before I write anything else I need to make sure that you know what sort of exam question this unit is preparing you for.\n\nSection C is a 20 mark question which you should spend about 25 minutes on. In that time you should be able to write about 700 words (two sides, possibly a bit more).\n\nThat’s not a lot of time to work in.\n\nThe question will very probably ask you to write about a sequence (I have note on what this actually means here) and you will have to explore some aspect of the core areas (these are explained here) or the specialist study area which is, for the silent film unit, critical debates (in this case the tension between the realist and the expressive as modes of film making.\n\nIn the 1940s, the French film critic André Bazin set in motion a major debate when he argued that both German Expressionist and Soviet Montage filmmaking went against what he saw as the ‘realist’ calling of cinema. This opposition between the realist and the expressive has informed thinking about film from the beginnings of cinema when the documentary realism of the Lumière Brothers was set in opposition to the fantasy films of Méliès.\n\nEduqas Syllabus Notes.\n\nThis page will draw together lots of material to help you make sense of the type of question this is, how to construct an answer and some specific material to help you use Sunrise to do this.\n\nIf you are not studying Sunrise there should be useful things here to help you with the film you are studying (scroll down till you see a picture of Nick Cage) and if you are studying F.W. Murnau’s film – fill your boots!\n\nSunrise: 1927. Director F.W. Murnau\n\nF.W. Murnau was a German director who is most famous for his 1922 film Nosferatu.\n\nThe BFI have put together a great introduction to Murnau – find it here.\n\nThe board have a useful introduction to the film here. There is a good section in the textbook too.\n\nAnd New York’s MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) has a page on the film here.\n\nSilent film.org has some great notes too.\n\nOne of the things you need is an artistic context to place the film in:\n\nAnd this . . .\n\nThis is a lovely visual introduction to the film.\n\nAnd finally here’s the whole film. Get some snacks. Settle in. Enjoy.\n\nOh – but before you do here are a few things worth noting:\n\nThe film was really, really expensive (which means nothing unless you know that it cost a lot of money, and it never made that money back). Where did the money go? Into the sets! $200,000 for the city set alone. Look at all the city scenes and the fairground scenes.\n\nThose are huge sets built with forced perspective (to make them look even bigger). Even the tram section chugs around a flippin’ set! All of this is of no importance unless you recognise that this gives Murnau complete visual control – look at the way there isn’t a right angle visible in some scenes! This means that he can create unsettling imagery through location alone rather than using a canted angle, or Dutch tilt, (my fave are the steps of the church – watch out for them).\n\nLook out for Murnau’s famous “fluid camera” or “unchained camera”. Murnau used complicated dolly tracks to move the audience through scenes. Here is a look at the difference between dolly and zoom shots.\n\nBack in 1927 this was state of the art stuff (it’s what attracted William Fox to offer Murnau a contract – nobody else was making films that flowed like his). It would become a staple of film noir which is why you see Spielberg using it so much in his 30’s flavoured style. In the picture below you can see the huge rig that they had to set up to make these shots.\n\nLook at the way the intertitles are animated, and how few there are – this is a visual experience and the story-telling is based on the look of the film.\n\nWhen it comes to the look of the film there’s a ton of chiaroscuro lighting. This is an Italian art term (it literally means light and dark) and Murnau has taken renaissance art tricks and used them to give artistic depth to the film. Murnau was an art historian before he became involved in film and his understanding of paintings underpins much of his cinematic work.\n\nJan Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring – a classic use of ciaroscuro lighting in paint.\n\nHere’s Murnau’s version in silver halide crystals!\n\nGuess what? This becomes the signature aesthetic effect of film noir. Dark and light people, dark and light.\n\nTo add – You can see Sunrise as being an attempt by Fox and Murnau to create democratic art – art for the masses. Walter Benjamin (German cultural theorist and philosopher) wrote an essay entitled “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” in 1936 where he attempted to work out what happened to art works when you photographed them and made them available to lots of people, but this is something different; this is a mass produced object which was being presented to the audience as a work of art. Murnau is one of the first feature-film directors to use the full potential of the camera as a tool for creating art.\n\nNotice the symbolism. The sub-title, “A Song of Two Humans”. Notice the casting: The Man, The Wife, The Woman from the City. Notice the way that the city is very much America but the countryside is pretty old-world and very rural-German (look at the thatched roofs, The Man’s boots and The Wife’s hair – every flippin’ thing in the village – what country are we actually in?). This film is one big SYMBOLIC ALLEGORY (a story with an important secondary meaning).\n\nReally this film is a huge take on what we call in arty circles THE PASTORAL (I’m releasing the power of caps lock ‘cos this is soooo important). The pastoral is a feature of plays, novels, films, poems etc. from the time when people invented cities to now. Basically the pastoral is the set of artistic impulses that says that the countryside is nicer than the city, but you wouldn’t want to live there for long. City folks have pictures of the countryside on their walls, they might even visit. Country folk might venture into the big smoke. What they both know is this; city people are smart, savvy, confident, fashionable, sexy – even, but immoral. Country people are moral, good, honest, reliable, pretty – even, but a bit thick. That’s why The Woman from the City looks like this,\n\nand The Wife looks like this\n\n#\n\nThe allegory digested? – In this modern world (of 1927) people have lost their moral bearings. They are having affairs! Wearing their hair in bobs! Heck women are even smoking and standing around in their underwear! Men are thinking of selling the farm, murdering their wives and running away to the bright lights! But. . . By looking back, to the traditions of the country lives they have, only recently, left behind (especially those who refer to somewhere in Europe as “the old country”) the audience can regain some of their goodness. It’s a redemption story folks – but one for the whole auditorium!\n\nVFX shots. There are lots of really tech-heavy shots in this film. Glass projection, matte shots (where film is sandwiched together to create multiple layers) and animation. This is a continued part of Fox and Murnau’s approach. The audience are going to get the most expensive artistic experience possible; this is democratic, machine-age art. Consumer art. Not nickleodeon cheap, but not so expensive that you had to be one of the upper classes to enjoy it.\n\nSynch sound. Everyone knows that The Jazz Singer was the first film with synchronised sound right? Well Sunrise actually has a synchronised soundtrack. It was released on September 23rd 1927. The Jazz Singer was released on October 6th 1927. Sunrise has music and sound effects synchronised to the action. So why are we studying it in the Silent Film unit? You probably already worked it out. The Jazz singer may only have about 20 minutes of synch sound but in those 20 mins it invents a new genre, the musical (‘cos before that it would have just been people flapping their gums a bit) and has a few minutes of synch dialogue – which changes the way performance and narrative work in cinema. It’s a huge technical achievement, but it isn’t an artistic achievement. It’s a popular, mainstream, film. Sunrise doesn’t use sound in the same way – it is still, really, a silent. But it also isn’t a populist, middle-of-the-road entertainment spectacle. It has bigger aims – which would lead to it over-reaching and tanking at the box office! – but it fails in style!\n\nOh yeah. And you get this instead of a sex scene.\n\nI’m not really sure what that is!\n\nNow you can watch the film!\n\nGood wasn’t it?\n\nCritical Debates – Expressionist vs Realist.\n\nThere’s lots I could write but Wisecrack have done a bang-up job in this film. Watch. The. Whole. Thing.\n\nSummity-sum-sum-main points summarised? There is a fork in the road in the history of film where a choice was made in direction. Naturalism, or realism – where performers behave in the way that real people behave, against expressionist performance, where people behave in ways that express their inner emotional existence. Hollywood chose realism, and the rest of the world had to follow.\n\nTo develop this point:\n\nYou might be thinking – well that’s just logical. Films have to be realistic otherwise the audience wouldn’t invest in them. Hmmm. If you think that there is no way that expressionist approaches can be successful then explain song-and-dance musicals to me (and therefore most of Bollywood) – where the singy-singy, tappy-tappy bits stand in for realistic emotional content. Explain animation. Explain Scott Pilgrim!\n\nI hereby give you permission to watch Scott Pilgrim Vs The World. Again. Unlike a musical it’s a fightcicle – every time there’s an emotional crisis there’s a fight scene!\n\nIn some ways this state of affairs is supa-weird because even in the biggest fantasy product (a Marvel or Star Wars thing say), the high-concept artwork and world-building all serves to power stories which are realistic in performance style and tied to realistic ideas about responses and actions (there’s a reason Star Wars used to be referred to as a space-opera).\n\nAudiences are therefore habituated to want to see realistic performance styles, unless there are genre cues which allow them to accept a different mode of performance, and can react badly to films which don’t give them that. Recently I watched Richard Kelly’s 2006 follow up to Donnie Darko Southland Tales.\n\nThis film tanked at the box office and was mauled by the critics, but it has its defenders and was recently streamed by Mubi as one of their “Perfect Failures”. What interests me is the impressionistic way the film feels all messy and fucked-up, like the end of the world. It doesn’t make sense because the end of the world doesn’t make sense. And then there’s the performances.\n\nThis is Dwayne Johnson’s nervous look in the film. He does it lots. It’s not realistic in any way but it is expressionistic. It’s how we feel when we are scared. But it’s not how we look. To get performance-y here usually actors are trained to play the cover-up. The character feels an emotion but they don’t show it. It leaks a bit, and the audience see it and that feels realistic, “Oh look he’s upset but he’s holding back the tears.” Expressionism gets the actor to play the emotion – all the emotion! It’s a different mode of performance, in fact it’s more performative (a show).\n\nSilent film tends towards this mode of performance and German Expressionism just takes it to a high point. So in your silent film unit you need to think about the way the actors work to express emotion at the audience rather than feel emotion at the audience.\n\nHow to tackle a question. Exemplar answer:\n\nFirst let me give you a short-cut to getting a few more marks.\n\n1; Plan. Do it properly now. Take a few minutes to sort out your shit.\n\n2: Start your answer with the words, “what this question is asking me to do is. . . ” and then build your answer. Most shitty answers I see are shitty because they don’t answer the actual question written on the actual paper. They veer off quickly into being answers to the question the student either wanted to be there or the one they kinda remember when they glanced at it a while ago.\n\n3: Identify your sequence (in the case of this question it will be one) and stick closely to it. Make reference to details. Show you know the material.\n\nSo lets imagine you get a question like this:\n\nExplore how your film option might be considered as either a realist or an expressionist kind of cinema. Make reference to a particular sequence in your answer. [20]\n\nYou need to answer a bit like this . . .\n\nThis question is asking me to explore the ways that F. W, Murnau’s 1927 film Sunrise is an example of expressionist, rather than realist, film-making. In order to do this I will make reference to the seduction scene, early in the film, where The Man meets The Woman from the City and they plot to kill The Wife.\n\nThe most strikingly expressionistic element of the sequence is the way that both George O’Brien and Margret Livingstone, as The Man and The Woman from the City respectively, demonstrate their character’s emotions through movement and heightened displays of those emotions. This is partially down to the restrictions placed on performers working without dialogue but it is also a key element of German expressionism. This is demonstrated in Livingstone’s wild and exuberant gyrations once she has convinced The Man to undertake her plan. In some ways this is designed to allude to a sex scene that the film maker cannot show but it adheres to the rules of expressionism as her character is exulting in her success.\n\nAnother performance choice is O’Brien’s dream-like walk to the marshes which reminds the audience of the somnambulist in Robert Weine’s film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. A key thematic element in German expressionist films is the compulsion of individuals to act against their judgement. This was a response to the terrible events of The Great War only in this film Murnau uses a family drama rather than a fantasy as the mechanism to explore this theme.\n\nIn the scene itself the characters move from enacting strangulation to embracing and the heightened haptic elements of the performance as well as their wild movements (kinesis) are dance-like and rooted in expressionistic rather than realistic modes of performance.\n\nThe mise en scène is similarly adapted from Murnau’s background in German Expressionism and takes on symbolic meaning in a film which wants the audience to read it as an allegory. The use of mist and moonlight give the sequence the feel of an allegorical painting, underlined by the use of chiaroscuro lighting which enhances the feeling of darkness, to present the audience with a scene of temptation and betrayal. This scene contains some striking compositions, Livingstone waiting in the moonlight is one, and adheres to the expressionist desire to create high art, rather than simply diversionary entertainment, on the screen. Later in the film there are more hints of Weine’s work in the use of set as the film avoids right angles to create an unsettling experience for the viewer.\n\nAnother expressionist element of this sequence is Murnau’s “fluid camera” which follows, sweeps past and even leads The Man on his fateful walk towards the marshes. This use of technical elements, in this case a hugely ambitious dolly shot, to help the audience feel the emotional content of the film is very much part of the wider expressionist movement and underlines the serious intent of those involved who were attempting to create a new form of artistic expression, and explore the opportunities in the medium, rather than simply replicate earlier forms such as plays.\n\nThis is also why, in the sequence, there are so many VFX shots. These include the animated intertitles (the words, “couldn’t she get drowned” wash down the screen) and the way the city is revealed to The Man in a set of shots that begin with the use of a matte technique to overlay the life he desires onto his current situation (the entertainment in the city is also shown as a kaleidoscope of bands and dances). This is part of the expressionist mode of film making and is another way we can consider this to be an expressionist kind of cinema.\n\nMurnau’s strand of expressionist film making (Nosferatu and The Last Laugh being other examples) tended towards the use of technical experimentation in order to have an effect on the audience and whilst American cinema-goers were not ready to accept expressionism (the film fared very poorly financially) the camera movements and use of light which William Fox, of 20th Century Fox wanted at his studio are key elements in Film Noir. The sequence in the marshes is noir in feeling but also reminds the viewer of Hitchcock’s work in Vertigo (another film maker who used expressionist techniques to draw the audience into the emotional world of the film).\n\nChecklist for your own answers:\n\nAnswer each one with either: Yes or Oh my goodness! Was I supposed to think about that?\n\nI have included details which demonstrate knowledge of the film (names, dates, statistics) in my answer.\n\nI have included material which demonstrates understanding (explanation of German Expressionist elements) .\n\nI have included clear evaluation (consideration of the question concept).\n\nI have included clear exploration (developing points and ideas).\n\nMy spelling, punctuation and grammar allow meaning to be clearly conveyed.\n\nEXTRA NOTE-Y NOTE! There’s a whole other film movement to consider!\n\nThere is another film movement which you can talk about when writing about Sunrise – Kammerspielfilm.\n\nKammerspiele, or “Chamber Plays” is the name given to plays with small casts which happened in domestic (home) settings. There were popular in Germany at the end of the Nineteenth Century. The name is derived from the idea of chamber music, which was music played by small groups of musicians in intimate settings. Therefore Kammerspiele echoed that idea in size of cast and setting. They tended to feature middle-class or lower middle-class characters and emphasized the relationships and the psychology of the characters.\n\nKammerspielfim was a film movement that produced relatively few films but one of them was Murnau’s 1924 film “The Last Laugh.” It’s about a hotel porter whose age makes him unsuitable for his job.\n\nLook at these images from the film and notice how similar they are to Sunrise.\n\nIn this film Murnau attempted to do away with intertitles (text) and produce a film that could be understood through cinematic techniques alone. One of his innovations was the “unchained camera” whose movements in The Last Laugh take the audience through scenes, create an epic sweep through locations and create a sense of pace without editing. In this respect Murnau is a key figure in the advancement of film as a medium and as an art form.\n\nAnd notice that the plot is a domestic, and psychological, drama about a lower-class family. Very kammerspiele!\n\nIn kammerspielfilm the femme fatale is a recurring character (sound familiar) and the theme of a male character who is unsatisfied with his lot in life is a similar trope. In some ways you could argue that kammerspielfilm is part of another strand of cinema (and drama) history that focuses on people’s lives as opposed to fantasy and spectacle. The irony is that Murnau is quite a spectacular film maker and even when he is making a film about a lowly hotel porter he shoots it in a way that renders it epic in scale. This is also what he does in Sunrise; a drama about a simple couple, an affair and redemption is shot in such a way that requires the biggest budget the world had ever seen. Kammerspielfilm, in Murnau’s hands, was an approach to character, theme and subject rather than a style.\n\nKammerspielfilm, therefore, is a little film movement which had a big impact on the narrative, and style of Sunrise."
