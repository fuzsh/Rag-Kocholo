        "text": "In a genre in which body language was more important that good diction, foreign language movies may have been more universal before the development of talkies, as the 20th annual Kansas Silent Film Festival will demonstrate Feb. 25-27 by including features from France and the Soviet Union with silent flicks from early Hollywood.\n\nSergei Eisenstein’s 1925 Soviet masterpiece “The Battleship Potemkin” and “Gribiche,” a 1926 feature produced in France by White Russian exiles from the Russian Revolution, will share screen time with Clara Bow in “It,” the 1927 movie that made her the “It Girl”; Douglas Fairbanks Sr.’s 1924 “Arabian Nights” fantasy “The Thief of Bagdad”; and 1926’s “Beau Geste,” starring Ronald Colman in the title role; as\n\nwell as shorts starring Charlie Chaplin and Kansas-born\n\nBuster Keaton.\n\nIn the 1920s, film distributors were able to substitute foreign language intertitles with ones in English. There was no need to dub dialogue or provide subtitles to it. The actors could convey their scenes with gestures and facial expressions, and live music helped move the story along, too.\n\nThe Kansas Silent Film Festival will continue the live music tradition with scores created and performed by pianists Jeff Rapsis and Rodney Sauer, organist Marvin Faulwell, percussionist Bob Keckeisen and the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Film historian Denise Morrison will introduce the films.\n\nMost of the films will be screened in White Concert Hall on the campus of Washburn University, and festival sessions there are free, although donations are encouraged to support the not-for-profit organization that organized the festival.\n\nThe 20th annual festival will introduce a new event and venue by having its opening night at the Jayhawk Theatre, 720 S.W. Jackson, a historic movie palace that supporters desire to restore and reopen as a theater and meeting place. The Feb. 25 opening night event, admission to which is $15, will begin with “Those Awful Hats,” a five-minute short directed by D.W. Griffith, and “The Immigrant,” a 1917 short starring Charlie Chaplin.\n\nThe opening night feature will be “It,” in which a salesgirl (Clara Bow) with plenty of “it” — that is sex appeal — pursues a handsome playboy (Antonio Moreno). Seating is limited to 120 for this special event.\n\nThe White Concert Hall showings will begin at 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 26, with “The Thief of Bagdad,” the 1924 American film directed by Raoul Walsh and starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. at his swashbuckling best in a script freely adapted from “One Thousand and One Nights.” “Thief” will be preceded by “Call of the Cuckoo,” a 1928 short featuring Max Davidson with guest appearances by Charley Chase, Laurel and Hardy and Jimmy Finlayson.\n\nThe Saturday, Feb. 27, morning session will begin at 9 a.m. with a documentary about the history of the silent film era introduced by Kansas Silent Film Festival director Bill Schaffer. “Chess Fever,” a rare 1925 Russian comedy, will follow. It is about a young man who is so completely absorbed by chess he misses his own wedding, but marital peace is restored with the help of Jose Raul Capablanca, an actual world champion chess player.\n\n“The Battleship Potemkin” will conclude the morning session. The movie, which often makes lists of all-time great movies, offers a dramatized version of the mutiny that occurred in 1905 when the crew of the Russian battleship Potemkin rebelled against its officers.\n\nAfter a lunch break, the festival will continue with “The Cohens and the Kellys,” the first of a series of films about the dealings between a Jewish family and an Irish one. After an intermission, special guest David Shepard will introduce “Gribiche,” also known as “Mother of Mine,” which is about a Gribiche, the 13-year-old son of a war widow, who gets adopted by a well-meaning philanthropic millionairess from America who promises his doting mother that the boy will have the finest education. The rich woman wants to turn Gribiche into a perfect gentleman, but soon he feels unhappy.\n\n“Gribiche” was produced by Films Albatros, a French studio established by Russian exiles. Shepard will talk about the studio at the festival’s eighth annual cinema-dinner from 5:30 to 7:15 in the Bradbury Thompson Alumni Center across the street from White Concert Hall at a ticketed event.\n\nThe Kansas Silent Film Festival will resume at 7:30 p.m. with the final session that includes a 1917 Keystone short, “Her Torpedoed Love,” and Buster Keaton’s most popular short, “Cops,” produced in 1922 and featuring hordes of police officers chasing Keaton all over Los Angeles.\n\nThe festival finale will be “Beau Geste,” a silent film classic described this way on the Internet Movie Database: “Michael ‘Beau’ Geste leaves England in disgrace and joins the infamous French Foreign Legion. He is reunited with his two brothers in North Africa, where they face greater danger from their own sadistic commander than from the rebellious Arabs.”\n\nA more detailed schedule of events can be found on the festival website at www.kssilentfilmfest.org."
