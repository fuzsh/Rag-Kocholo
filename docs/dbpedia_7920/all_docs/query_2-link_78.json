        "text": "Clara Bow (born July 29, 1905, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.—died September 27, 1965, Los Angeles, California) was an American motion-picture actress, called the “It” Girl after she performed in It (1927), the popular silent-film version of Elinor Glyn’s novel of that name. She personified the vivacious, emancipated flapper of the 1920s. From 1927 to 1930 she was one of the top five Hollywood box-office attractions.\n\n(Read Lillian Gish’s 1929 Britannica essay on silent film.)\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nClara Bow was born into a poor family; she was sexually abused by her father and neglected by her mother, who suffered from mental illness. She became a Hollywood actress while still in high school by way of a beauty contest held by Motion Picture Classic magazine. Her first part was a small role in Beyond the Rainbow (1922), but her scenes were cut out of the release print. (After Bow became a star, the film was rereleased with her scenes restored.) A supporting role in the whaling drama Down to the Sea in Ships (1922) brought her considerable attention. She had prominent roles, usually as a flapper, in such films as The Plastic Age (1925), Mantrap (1926), Kid Boots (1926), and Dancing Mothers (1926).\n\nIn 1927 Bow was chosen by Glyn to star in It, which proved a tremendous box-office success. Thereafter known universally as the “It” Girl, Bow was the embodiment of beauty, abandon, and sex appeal for the moviegoers of the Jazz Age. She starred in the World War I drama Wings (1927), the first film to win the Academy Award for best picture. Others of the 30-odd movies in which she starred include Rough House Rosie (1927; now lost), Ladies of the Mob (1928; now lost), Three Week Ends (1928; now lost), Dangerous Curves (1929), and The Saturday Night Kid (1929)."
