        "text": "This site is intended to serve as a gathering place for information on some of more underappreciated silent film stars--the \"emotional actresses,\" as they were called in the trade, those who specialized in drama. Comediennes and sex symbols seem to remain in the minds of fans for years, and are particularly popular to new generations of silent film lovers. Yet dramas were a staple of the silent screen and produced some of the brightest and most beloved stars. These special women have been largely forgotten by later generations, and their films are seldom revived. This is my own personal selection of divas (as well as my own subjective definition of \"diva\"), so if your favorite is not here, check my links below for other silent film actresses. So far, I have concentrated on stars of American films, since they are the most accessible and familiar to me. However, since silent film was an international art, I intend to include divas of other lands. As films from other areas of the world become available, perhaps we will have the opportunity to rediscover more of the great ladies of the silent screen.\n\nNOTE: This site is no longer being updated as of April 2024 as it's no longer easily accessible to me. It's long been impossible to keep up with the broken links. Remember that if you find a broken link that you wanted to follow, copy the URL and paste it into the Wayback Machine, and look at a cache from a few years back. And you might want to bookmark the URL for this page since it site itself will doubtless go offline at some point when Stanford pulls down the legacy webspace, so it may also only be available via the Wayback Machine\n\n.\n\nThe Unsung Divas\n\nHere you will find my websites devoted to four of these silent stars. The sites include old and new articles, pictures, filmographies, contemporary reviews, and reviews of videos.\n\nThe Norma Talmadge Website The Clara Kimball Young Website The Pauline Frederick Website The Alice Joyce Website\n\nTest your knowledge! Take the Diva Pop Quiz\n\nOther Divas on the Web\n\nSome of these stars are still well known, some are now obscure. Each page contains a little information about the actress, links to information about her on the web, and further information in print sources.\n\nGloria Swanson Pola Negri Mae Murray Alla Nazimova Theda Bara Greta Garbo Lillian Gish Blanche Sweet Mae Marsh Elsie Ferguson Corinne Griffith Anita Stewart Geraldine Farrar Priscilla Dean Louise Brooks Asta Nielsen Francesca Bertini Lyda Borelli Pina Menichelli Henny Porten Vera Kholodnaya Ruan Lingyu\n\nOther Silent Actresses of Note\n\nThese actresses, while never achieving the top rank of stardom and often overlooked even in their own time, are here celebrated for their exceptional dramatic talent. Their presence often gives distinction to an otherwise nondescript film, and in a great film they have a real chance to shine.\n\nBessie Love Betty Compson Irene Rich Lois Wilson\n\nOther silent film actresses on the web\n\nSites and articles on groups of actresses\n\nSilent Ladies\n\nSpeeding Sweethearts of the Screen, by William Drew\n\nThe Tragic Flugrath Sisters (Viola Dana, Shirley Mason, and Edna Flugrath, by Tim Lusser\n\nFrom Demure to Tempestuous: The Leading Ladies of Chaplin's Silent Features, by Tim Lusser\n\nPretty, Funny Ladies, by Tim Lusser\n\nSingle Actresses, A-Z\n\nOlga Baclanova, the Ultimate Cinemantrap\n\nVilma Banky, the Hungarian Rhapsody\n\nEleanor Boardman\n\nOlive Borden, the Joy Girl\n\nChile Bouchier, by Michael Grantside, in Classic Images\n\nThe Clara Bow Page\n\nA Tribute to Betty Bronson\n\nThe Silent Film Career of Bartine Burkett\n\nAlice Calhoun\n\nJewel Carmen, Shaded in Scandal, by Billy Doyle, in Classic Images\n\nThe Virginia Lee Corbin Scrapbook\n\nJoan Crawford Heaven\n\nGoddess of the Silent Screen: Dolores Costello Barrymore\n\nLil Dagover\n\nThe Marion Davies Home Page\n\nMarlene Dietrich Silent Film, 1923-1929\n\nDelectable Dollies, the Dolly Sisters\n\nMarie Doro, A Forgotten Star\n\nMarie Doro Home Page\n\nDorothy Dwan, by Billy Doyle, in Classic Images\n\nJeanne Eagels, Myths about the Legend\n\nHelen Gardner, Silent Film Pioneer\n\nWhatever Became of Neva Gerber, by Billy Doyle, in Classic Images\n\nThe Dorothy Gish Project\n\nJetta Goudal, by Charles C.
