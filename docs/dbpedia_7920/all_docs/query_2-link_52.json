        "text": "​Saturday, May 25, 2024 at 7:30 p.m. at\n\nThe Woman's Club of Redondo Beach\n\n400 S Broadway, Redondo Beach, CA 90277\n\n​\n\nMARION DAVIES\n\nin\n\nTHE PATSY (1928)\n\nWITH LIVE, ORIGINAL MUSIC BY\n\nCLIFF RETALLICK\n\n​\n\nThe screening will be introduced by Lara Gabrielle, author of the book Captain of Her Soul: The Life of Marion Davies, who will also be on hand to sign copies of her book.\n\n​\n\nMarion Davies delivers a tearfully funny performance in her first collaboration with director King Vidor, The Patsy (1928), costarring the equally brilliant Marie Dressler.\n\n​William Randolph Hearst may have wanted her to act in dramas, but we are fortunate that Marion Davies went against his wishes, teaming with King Vidor to create this unforgettable comedic masterpiece. Davies reinvented herself as the first \"screwball\" comedian with this film.\n\nSharing the spotlight in The Patsy is the formidable Marie Dressler, a force to be reckoned with in every scene. Portraying the mother of Davies' character, Dressler's comedic and dramatic timing foreshadows the greatness she would later be known for in talkies.\n\nKing Vidor, known for directing dramatic classics like The Big Parade (1925) and The Crowd (1928), proved his versatility by crafting a film that can be compared to the works of comedy legends such as Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. The physical comedy in The Patsy is pure gold, a testament to King Vidor’s impeccable direction and the perfect synergy of the cast. The Patsy stands as one of the wittiest, craziest, and quirkiest films of its time.\n\nDon't miss the chance to witness this unforgettable silent film experience. Coming Saturday, May 25 at 7:30 p.m. to the Woman's Club of Redondo Beach!\n\nComing to the\n\n​Lumiere Cinema at the Music Hall\n\n9036 Wilshire Blvd, Beverly Hills, CA 90211\n\n​\n\nSunday, May 19, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nLon Chaney\n\nstarring in\n\nThe Penalty(1920)\n\nWith live, original music by\n\nCliff Retallick\n\n​Set against the shadowy backdrop of San Francisco's underworld, The Penalty unfolds with a palpable sense of dread, drawing viewers into a web of intrigue and moral ambiguity. The film boasts a genuinely disturbing performance by Lon Chaney, which transcends even his own astonishing physical transformation into the character of a deformed criminal mastermind driven by a burning desire for vengeance.\n\nLon Chaney immerses himself fully into his role, inflicting upon himself a physical agony similar to that endured by his on-screen counterpart. With his lower limbs bound, forcing him to walk on his kneecaps, the harnessing of his legs was so painful he could endure it for only a few minutes at a time, and it is said that his knees and back sustained permanent damage.\n\nYet, it is not merely Chaney's physical feat that mesmerizes audiences. As the embodiment of pure malevolence, Chaney's countenance strikes fear into the hearts of viewers with each menacing glare. His facial expressions and entire physicality masterfully convey the emotional emptiness that consumes his character.\n\nDirector Wallace Worsley and cinematographer Donovan Short complement Chaney's performance through meticulous attention to detail. The film's elaborate sets and costume design further immerse viewers in its atmospheric world, evoking a sense of gritty realism that heightens the tension and suspense.\n\nEvery aspect of The Penalty coalesces to deliver a cinematic experience that lingers long after the credits roll. As a seminal work of early horror cinema, The Penalty remains a testament to the power of storytelling and the enduring legacy of Lon Chaney's unparalleled talent.\n\nDon't miss this rare chance to see The Penalty as it was meant to be seen - on the big screen, with live music! At the Lumiere Music Hall Theater, May 19, 2024 at 2:00 p.m., with live accompaniment by Cliff Retallick!\n\n​\n\nComing to the historic\n\n​Woman's Club of Hollywood\n\nMay 4, 2024 at 7:30 p.m.\n\nTraffic in Souls(1914)\n\nWith live, original music by Cliff Retallick\n\nA trailblazing silent drama and a huge hit in its day, Traffic in George Loane Tucker's Traffic in Souls (1913) was a groundbreaking exploitation classic/ police procedural about sex trafficking, and one of the best early American feature films!\n\n​\n\nAudiences lined up for blocks to see it in 1913, making Universal into a major studio almost overnight! Traffic in Souls (1913) delves into the harrowing depths of forced prostitution in the United States. Directed by the visionary George Loane Tucker and produced by the Universal Film Manufacturing Company, its story is set against the backdrop of bustling New York City, capturing the essence of early 20th-century America.\n\nPartially filmed “guerrilla style” on location at iconic sites such as Ellis Island and Manhattan, the movie sheds light on the plight of immigrant women and others who found themselves ensnared in the dark world of prostitution. Released during a period of moral upheaval, the film ignited conversations about the exploitation of women and the urgent need for reform. The film was passed by the National Board of Review by virtue of its suggesting methods of \"controlling\" prostitution.\n\nThrough skillful cinematography, Traffic in Souls draws audiences into the heart of its narrative. One of the film's most striking features is its innovative use of camera movement.\n\n​\n\nDon't miss the opportunity to experience this cinematic gem firsthand. Join us for a special screening of Traffic in Souls, where you'll be transported to a bygone era that witnessed the birth of a new cinematic language.\n\n​\n\nComing to the\n\n​Lumiere Cinema at the Music Hall\n\n9036 Wilshire Blvd, Beverly Hills, CA 90211\n\n​\n\nSunday, April 28, 2024 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nJoan Crawford\n\nstarring in\n\nOur Dancing Daughters(1928)\n\nWith live, original music by\n\nCliff Retallick\n\nIn the annals of cinema history, some films truly capture a moment in time. If you're looking for a cinematic experience that transports you back 100 years to the dazzling world of the 1920s, look no further than Our Dancing Daughters (1928).\n\nDirected by Harry Beaumont, Our Dancing Daughters rocketed Joan Crawford to stardom, while at the same time encapsulating the essence of the Jazz Age. A colossal hit for MGM, it grossed over six times its production cost, raking in a staggering $1.1 million against a modest budget of $178,000.\n\nCentral to the film's success is Joan Crawford's electrifying performance. Born Lucille Le Sueur in 1904, Crawford's journey to stardom was anything but conventional. After a challenging upbringing, she found her way to the lights of Broadway before catching the eye of MGM executives. Renamed Joan Crawford, she quickly became a fixture of the silver screen. However, it was Our Dancing Daughters that first showcased her star power, as she brought to life the character of Diana—an ambitious, liberated young woman navigating the complexities of a rapidly changing society, whose unexpected experience of love leaves her genuinely heartbroken.\n\nAlongside Crawford, the film boasts a stellar ensemble cast, including Anita Page and Dorothy Sebastian, whose performances add depth and nuance to the narrative. Together, they navigate a world of decadence and desire, where love and ambition collide amidst the backdrop of glittering soirées and pulsating dance floors. Page had just turned eighteen, but she seems to have fully grasped the worldliness and duplicity her role demanded.\n\nJohnny Mack Brown plays Diana’s love interest, football star Ben Blaine. Prior to his acting career, Brown had excelled as a halfback for the University of Alabama's championship-winning football team in 1926. Brown's prowess on the field was exemplified by his outstanding performance in the 1926 Rose Bowl, where he clinched the Most Valuable Player title by scoring two of Alabama's three touchdowns in a surprising victory against the University of Washington.\n\nScreenwriters Josephine Lovett, Marian Ainslee, and Ruth Cummings paint a vivid portrait of the first generation of women to assert itself through fashion and lifestyle amidst a rapidly changing world.\n\nThe film's sumptuous set design was crafted by the visionary Art Director Cedric Gibbons. From the sleek Art Deco interiors to the flamboyant fashions, every frame is a visual ode to the Jazz Age, replete with flasks, flappers and period slang. The film paints a vivid portrait of the first generation to assert itself through fashion and lifestyle amidst a rapidly changing world.\n\nGeorge Barnes' cinematography brings it all to life, capturing the energy and excitement of the party scenes with vibrant visuals and dynamic, mobile camerawork. Barnes later shot several Hitchcock classics, including Rebecca (1940).\n\nDon’t miss this rare chance to see Joan Crawford and Anita Page in Our Dancing Daughters on the big screen of the Lumiere Music Hall, with live, original music by the one-and-only Cliff Retallick!\n\n​Tickets are available now for\n\n​\n\nGreta Garbo\n\nAntonio Morenoand\n\nLionel Barrymore in\n\nThe Temptress (1926)\n\nComing Sunday, February 25 at 2:00 p.m. to Lumiere Music Hall Cinema, 9036 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, California ​\n\nThe Temptress (1926) is a testament to the brilliance of silent cinema, starring the incomparable Greta Garbo in her second American film. Directed by Fred Niblo, this cinematic gem transports audiences into a world of passion, intrigue, and undeniable charisma.\n\nThe heart of The Temptress lies in Greta Garbo's mesmerizing performance. Only 20, Garbo is simply, spectacularly beautiful. But her talents extend far beyond her striking appearance. A contemporary Photoplay reviewer wrote, \"Look back and think if you can of any actress who had made a more profound impression than Greta Garbo in but one picture. You can't. Neither can I.\"\n\nIn The Temptress, Garbo portrays a character who is alluring and enigmatic, with a hint of vulnerability beneath her facade of confidence. As the plot unfolds, her nuanced performance draw viewers into a world of forbidden desires and hidden agendas. Her performance transcends language, speaking through subtle gestures and expressions, showcasing her as one of the finest actresses of her generation.\n\nThe storyline transports us from extravagant Parisian masked balls, a dramatic suicide during a banquet, and clandestine romance in a park, to the rugged landscapes of Argentina for a thrilling duel of honor involving whips, acts of sabotage, and catastrophic floods, all portrayed with impressive visual effects. The film's visuals are a testament to the brilliant craftsmanship of the silent film era.\n\nA shocking spectacle for 1926, the gory whip scene is one of many highlights of The Temptress. It’s hard to imagine a more savage encounter between hero and villain. Antonio Moreno, one of the original Latin Lovers, delivers a standout performance as the male lead.\n\nDirected by Fred Niblo, renowned for his work on Ben-Hur (1925), Blood and Sand (1922) and The Mark of Zorro (1920), The Temptress is a masterclass in visual storytelling. Niblo's direction infuses each scene with a sense of grandeur and drama.\n\nWith stunning visuals and thrilling plot twists, The Temptress remains both a testament to Greta Garbo's unparalleled talent and a shining example of the artistry and allure of silent cinema. Don’t miss this rare chance to see it on the big screen of the Lumiere Music Hall Cinema, with brilliant live music by a master of live film accompaniment, Cliff Retallick.\n\n​\n\nMARION DAVIES\n\nin\n\nTHE PATSY (1928)\n\nWITH LIVE MUSIC BY\n\nCLIFF RETALLICK\n\nNOTE CHANGE OF TIME!

Portraying the mother of Davies' character, Dressler's comedic and dramatic timing foreshadows the greatness she would later be known for in talkies.\n\nKing Vidor, known for directing dramatic classics like The Big Parade (1925) and The Crowd (1928), proved his versatility by crafting a film that can be compared to the works of comedy legends such as Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. The physical comedy in The Patsy is pure gold, a testament to King Vidor’s impeccable direction and the perfect synergy of the cast. The Patsy stands as one of the wittiest, craziest, and quirkiest films of its time."
