This course examines the six aspects of film form—narrative, mise-en-scène, cinematography, editing, sound, and acting—to understand better how summer blockbusters communicate, what makes for a successful blockbuster film, and how the genre of blockbuster functions.\n\nFILM 229 Studies in Film Form\n\n3.00 credits\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to elements of film form and grammar, including narrative, mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, sound, and acting. Students taking this course will learn how to describe a film's formal qualities and will use these descriptions to make analytical claims about film.\n\nFILM 230 Hollywood Cinema\n\n3.00 credits\n\nSimultaneously an industry, an entertainment, and an art form, Hollywood cinema is a system that has produced the predominant mass culture of the last 100 years, shaping the way that Americans (and the world) think about American history, culture, and identity. This class examines Hollywood as a business, as an aesthetic, and as a cultural force, considering in particular the following questions: What are the formal and ideological markers of the Hollywood film? How have the poetics and politics of the Hollywood film developed over time? Why has the Hollywood film endured over time? What voices have been neglected by Hollywood history? What does Hollywood history have to teach us about our own moment? In exploring these questions, we will draw on film studies, American studies, cognitive science, economics, cultural theory, history, critical race theory, feminist theory, aesthetics, and ethics to develop a comprehensive understanding of what Hollywood has meant and what it means today.\n\nFILM 231 African-American Cinema\n\n3.00 credits\n\nW. E. B. Du Bois famously described the African-American experience as a kind of “double-consciousness, [a] sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others,” torn between two identities: “an American, a Negro.” This course reflects this same duality, existing in tension between two simultaneous classes. The first half of the course examines the way that American popular cinema has represented the lives and humanity of black citizens—the “looking at one’s self through the eyes of others” that Du Bois refers to. This portion of the course will consider how the industry of Hollywood—a largely white, straight, and male institution—depicted and shaped the lives of black Americans for the movie-going public. The second half of the course examines how black filmmakers from the earliest moments of American filmmaking to our own moment have used cinema as a form of self-expression and meaning-making. This portion of the course considers black filmmaking both as a response to historical representations of African-Americans and as a cinematic history separate from a relationship to white America. In combining these two separate intellectual impulses, this course aims to instantiate Du Bois’s “double-consciousness” and do justice both to the need to examine Hollywood cinema’s history of racial injustice and to the desire to explore the rich tableau of black filmmaking in the United States.\n\nFILM 239 Studies in Film History\n\n3.00 credits\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to the history of film as a medium, ranging from its origins to the current moment. Students taking this course will learn how to situate a film in its historical and cultural contexts and will use these contexts to make analytical claims about film and history.\n\nFILM 240 World Cinema\n\n3.00 credits\n\nThis course takes the concept of the projected image as a machine for reflection and metamorphosis as its starting point, considering the ways in which film both reflects ourselves and our culture back at us while also influencing and changing the very things it reflects. In particular, this course examines the ways in which world cinema—defined as cinema not in English—creates meaning, examining the movement, the auteur, and the society as particular loci of meaning. This course examines films from the beginnings of cinema to movies released quite recently, all in the service of considering what the cinema is, what it has to say about culture and society, and what we should think, say, do, and feel as viewers looking into our own distorted reflections.\n\nFILM 249 Studies:Film, Nat'l Identity\n\n3.00 credits\n\nThis course examines the connection between film and national identity, studying at least one non-US cinema in order to explore the relationship between film art and national culture.

Content includes films from the United States and from world cinema, from the beginnings of film to the current moment, all in the service of considering what the horror film is, what it has to say about gender and sexuality, and what we should think, say, do, and feel as viewers looking into our own distorted reflections.\n\nFILM 260 Design Process\n\n3.00 credits\n\nFundamentals of the process of designing for the theatre - developing the design from the initial script study through the collaborative process in design meetings.

Using these narrow chronological and geographical boundaries, this course explores ways of reading this singular moment in history, interrogating local demographics and neighborhoods, national culture, and the visions of a variety of filmmakers to understand what is important and distinct about New York City, about the 70s, and about film. In particular, these movies document the city’s racial and ethnic populations, emergent queerness, elite enclaves and decaying districts, and the vicious eruption of neoliberalism. In considering these films, this course also studies the reciprocal relationship between film and culture, as well as a variety of parallels between the 1970s and our own moment.\n\nFILM 332 The American New Wave\n\n3.00 credits\n\nThe word “interregnum” refers to an interval of time between the reigns of two monarchs, a liminal moment between one ruling system and another when possibilities flourish, and this political term gives us a perfect metaphor for the moment of film history—sometimes called “New Hollywood” or “the American New Wave”—students will study in this course. In the mid-sixties, the studio system of Hollywood collapsed, and in the late seventies, a new blockbuster era emerged, an era we still live in today.
