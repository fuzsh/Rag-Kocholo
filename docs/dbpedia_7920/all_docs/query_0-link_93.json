        "text": "Cinema’s First Nasty Women\n\nWe the curators of Cinema’s First Nasty Women stand in wholehearted solidarity with the campus protesters at Columbia University and Barnard College, who take to the streets in the same spirit as Léontine, the striking nursemaids, and other collective feminist resisters of the early film archive. Our project is all about exploring the unrealized and evocative possibilities of feminist film history. Yet again, history is unfolding before our very eyes! We unequivocally condemn the actions of Columbia University to suppress, suspend, and criminalize the peaceful demonstrations of student protesters, who demand divestment from Israel’s US-backed genocide in Gaza and the West Bank. We oppose settler colonialism and Zionism. We uphold the continued struggle of the Palestinian people for land, life, and liberation. We join the protesters’ calls for divestment and for expunging all suspensions and charges against student activists, who have been unjustly punished for speaking truth to power. Nasty women, unite–past, present, and future!\n\nThe Cinema’s First Nasty Women set is now out!

The collection includes 99 European and American silent films, produced from 1898 to 1926, sourced from 13 international film archives and libraries, and spotlighting slapstick comediennes and cross-dressing women of the silent screen. The women included are indeed very “nasty”—they organize labor strikes, bake (and weaponize) inedible desserts, explode out of the chimney, electrocute the police force, and assume a range of identities that gleefully dismantle traditional gender norms and sexual constraints. The films span a range of genres including slapstick comedy, genteel farce, the trick film, cowboy melodrama, and adventure thriller.\n\nFollow Cinema’s First Nasty Women on Twitter & Facebook!\n\nDisc Summaries\n\nDisc 1: Disastrous Domestics & Anarchic Tomboys\n\nVengeful kitchen maids and rambunctious teenagers conspire to leave the domestic sphere in total shambles. Housemaids combust through the chimney, fiancées weaponize their inedible baked goods against the patriarchy, while recalcitrant daughters flood and incinerate their family homes. This disc also spotlights the forgotten films of Léontine, an internationally popular French comedienne character and star of a Pathé Comica series that produced over 21 titles from 1910-1912. (But her identity remains unknown to this day!) It also features anarchic, hilarious performances by Lea Giunchi, Bertha Regustus, Laura Bayley, Florence Lawrence, Berthe Dagmar, Gilbert Saroni, and Lili Zeidner.\n\nFilms\n\nLéontine\n\nLéontine deviant trottin [Léontine Becomes an Errand Girl] (France 1910), with Léontine.\n\nLes Ficelles de Léontine [Léontine Pulls the Strings] (France 1910), with Léontine.\n\nLa pile électrique de Léontine [Léontine’s Battery] (France 1910), with Léontine.\n\nLéontine en vacances [Léontine on Vacation] (France 1910), with Léontine.\n\nLéontine en apprentissage [Léontine’s Apprenticeship] (France 1910), with Léontine.\n\nRosalie et Léontine vont au théâtre [Rosalie and Léontine Go to the Theater] (France 1911), with Léontine and Sarah Duhamel.\n\nVentilateur breveté [The New Air Fan] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nLéontine enfant terrible [Léontine, the Troublemaker] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nLe bateau de Léontine [Léontine’s Boat] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nUn ravalement précipité [A Hasty Renovation] (France 1911), with Léontine and Sarah Duhamel.\n\nLéontine s’envole [Léontine Gets Carried Away] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nLes malices de Léontine [Léontine’s Pranks] (France 1912), with Léontine.\n\nLéontine garde la maison [Léontine Keeps House] (France 1912), with Léontine.\n\nAmour et musique [Love and Music] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nLa peur des ombres [Fear of Shadows] (France 1911), with Léontine.\n\nLea\n\nLea sui pattini [Léa on Rollerskates] (Italy 1911), with Lea Giunchi.\n\nRiposo festivo [A Lively Day Off] (Italy 1912), with Lea Giunchi.\n\nLéa bambola [Léa as a Doll] (Italy 1913), with Lea Giunchi.\n\nCatastrophe in the Kitchen\n\nVictoire a ses nerfs [Victoire is on Her Last Nerve] (France 1907).\n\nFinish of Mr. Fresh (US 1899).\n\nThe Dairymaid’s Revenge (US 1899).\n\nLa grève des bonnes [The Maids’ Strike] (France 1906).\n\nLa grève des nourrices [The Nursemaids’ Strike] (France 1907).\n\nLa ruse de Miss Plumcake [Miss Plumcake’s Ruse] (France 1911), with Mistinguett.\n\nHer First Biscuits (US 1909), with Florence Lawrence.\n\nHow Bridget Served the Salad Undressed (US 1898).\n\nNora’s 4th of July (US 1901).\n\nHow Bridget Made the Fire (US 1900), with Gilbert Saroni.*\n\nThe Finish of Bridget McKeen (US 1901).\n\nMary Jane’s Mishap (UK 1903), with Laura Bayley.\n\nCatastrophe Beyond the Kitchen\n\nLaughing Gas (US 1907), with Bertha Regustus.\n\nMadame fait du sport [Madame is Athletic] (France 1908).\n\nLes femmes cochers [The Coachwomen] (France 1907).\n\nFille de bain indiscrète [The Indiscreet Bathroom Maid] (France 1902).\n\nEugénie, redresse-toi!

They demolish the home, tyrannize their spouses, and wage feminist revolution in the streets. This disc features three French comedienne characters, Cunégonde (Little Chrysia) and Rosalie and Pétronille (both played by Sarah Duhamel). The actress who appeared as Cunégonde was recently identified by Elif Rongen-Kaynakçi as Little Chrysia, a traveling stage performer and prolific film comedienne who also starred in the Cunégonde spinoff series Arabella and Zoé. Duhamel’s films similarly embrace the joy of social protest and anarchic physical destruction, exemplified by Rosalie Has Sleeping Sickness, Rosalie and Her Phonograph, and Pétronille Wins the Big Race. Duhamel’s body is a force of nature and absolutely anything is possible in the world of her films. This disc also includes a curated selection of films on “Tyranny at Home,” turning Hannah Arendt’s warning on its head with the feisty antics of Florence Turner, Alma Taylor, Chrissie White, and Indigenous actress Minnie Devereaux.\n\nFilms\n\nCunégonde\n\nCunégonde trop curieuse [Cunégonde is Too Curious] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde ramoneur [Cunégonde the Chimney Sweep] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde femme cochère [Cunégonde the Coachwoman] (France 1913), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde femme du monde [Cunégonde is a Woman of the World] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia\n\nCunégonde femme crampon [Cunégonde the Nasty Woman] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde aime son maître [Cunégonde Loves Her Employer] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde jalouse [Cunégonde is Jealous] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nCunégonde membre de la SPA [Cunégonde is a Member of the SPCA] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nGisèle a manqué le train [Gisèle Missed Her Train] (France 1912), with Little Chrysia.\n\nZoé a la main malheureuse [Zoé the Unfortunate Housemaid] (France 1913), with Little Chrysia.\n\nZoé et le parapluie miraculeux [Zoé and the Miraculous Umbrella] (France 1913), with Little Chrysia.\n\nRosalie\n\nRosalie et son phonographe [Rosalie and Her Phonograph] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nRosalie emménage [Rosalie Moves In] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nRosalie a la maladie du sommeil [Rosalie Has Sleeping Sickness] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nRosalie et ses meubles fidèles [Rosalie and Her Faithful Furniture] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nLittle Moritz demande Rosalie en mariage [Little Moritz Wants to Marry Rosalie] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nLittle Moritz enlève Rosalie [Little Moritz Runs Away With Rosalie] (France 1911), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nC’est la faute à Rosalie [It’s Rosalie’s Fault!] (France 1912), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nPétronille\n\nLe singe de Pétronille [Pétronille’s Monkey] (France 1913), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nPétronille gagne le grand steeple [Pétronille Wins the Grand Steeple Chase] (France 1913), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nPatouillard a une femme jalouse [Patouillard Has a Jealous Wife] (France 1912), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nGavroche à Luna-Park [Gavroche at Luna Park] (France 1912), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nLe désespoir de Pétronille [Pétronille’s Despair] (France 1914), with Sarah Duhamel.\n\nTyranny at Home\n\nLa fureur de Mme Plumette [Madame Plumette’s Fury] (France 1912).\n\nFatty and Minnie He-Haw (US 1914), with Minnie Devereaux.\n\nDaisy Doodad’s Dial (UK 1914), with Florence Turner.\n\nHypnotizing the Hypnotist (US 1911), with Florence Turner.\n\nTilly’s Party (UK 1911), with Alma Taylor and Chrissie White.\n\nMarie est trop obéissante [Marie is Too Obedient] (France 1912).\n\nOnésime et la toilette de mademoiselle Badinois [Onésime and Mademoiselle Badinois’ Outfit] (France 1912), with Ellen Lowe.\n\nNon!

This disc includes the surviving films from writer/director/actor Gene Gauntier’s girl spy series and the best of Edna “Billy” Foster’s work at Biograph, where the young assigned-female actor played almost exclusively male roles. On the Western frontier, young women disguise themselves as boys to seek their fortune; other films show the rambunctious gun-toting femininity cultivated out West. This disc also spotlights performances by actor-producer Texas Guinan, Indigenous star Lillian St. Cyr (Winnebago), lesbian comedian Fay Tincher, and Japanese-American sensation Tsuru Aoki.\n\nFilms\n\nThe Girl Spy\n\nThe Girl Spy: An Incident of the Civil War (US 1909), with Gene Gauntier.\n\nThe Further Adventures of the Girl Spy (US 1910), with Gene Gauntier.\n\nThe Girl Spy Before Vicksburg (US 1910), with Gene Gauntier.\n\nEdna “Billy” Foster\n\nA Country Cupid (US 1911), with Edna “Billy” Foster.\n\nThe Adventures of Billy (US 1911), with Edna “Billy” Foster.\n\nA Terrible Discovery (US 1911), with Edna “Billy” Foster.\n\nThe Baby and the Stork (US 1912), with Edna “Billy” Foster.\n\nGender Frontiers\n\nThe Red Girl and the Child (US 1910), with Lilian St. Cyr (Red Wing).\n\nAn Up-to-Date Squ*w (US 1911).\n\nThe Death Mask (US 1914), with Tsuru Aoki.\n\nA Range Romance (US 1911).\n\nMaking a Man of Her (US 1912), with Louise Glaum.\n\nThe Planter’s Wife (US 1908), with Claire McDowell and Florence Lawrence.\n\nDollars and Sense (US 1916), with Ora Carew.\n\nRowdy Ann (US 1919), with Fay Tincher.\n\nThe Night Rider (US 1920), with Texas Guinan.\n\nDisc 4: Female Tricksters\n\nThis disc sets out the perils and pleasures of boyish and boisterous young women in urban and modern spaces. Cross-dressing provides myriad opportunities for accidental same-sex attraction, and women look to male attire to brave the mean streets of the early 20th century metropolis. Evelyn Greeley moonlights as both Sapphic dancer and male Latin professor in Phil-for-Short, while theater star Mabel Taliaferro plays a headstrong society girl who disguises herself as a boy to win her father’s land from a “woman-hating” French trapper in the frontier BDSM fantasy, Snowbird. Other films play with the rapid changes to gender and sexuality unfolding at this time, from a topsy-turvy comedy set 100 years in the future when “men are like women” and “women are like men” to the disorienting rituals, masquerades, and mistaken identities unleashed by a sorority initiation in She’s A Prince.
