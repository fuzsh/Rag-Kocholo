If you don't find something suitable below, we've also got the best sci-fi movies and TV shows to stream on Netflix, Amazon Prime and Paramount Plus to peruse, as well as our round-up of the best streaming deals on offer right now. For now, let’s embark on a journey through the best sci-fi movies and TV shows to stream on Disney Plus this August.\n\nStar Wars\n\n1) 'Star Wars' original trilogy\n\nWatch or watch not, there is no try. Disney Plus is home to one of if not the biggest franchise in cinematic history, \"Star Wars.\" Starting with \"A New Hope\" in 1977, the saga begins as a young Luke Skywalker meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, begins to learn the ways of the force, joins the Rebel Alliance and eventually blows up the Death Star. The start of a cinematic dynasty.\n\nThe story continues with what many consider the best film in the franchise's history, \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" In this installment, Luke meets Master Yoda for the first time to enhance his Jedi training, The Empire fights the Rebel Alliance in the epic battle of Hoth and Darth Vader captures and holds Han Solo hostage before dropping one of the biggest bombshells in the history of cinema … But we're not going to spoil that; you'll have to watch it yourself.\n\nFinally, in \"Return of the Jedi,\" this epic trilogy comes to its conclusion as the Emperor and Darth Vader try to coerce Luke over to the dark side while Han Solo, Princess Leia and the rest of the Rebel Alliance defeat the Empire in the battle of Endor, which results in the destruction of the second Death Star.\n\n2) 'Star Wars' prequel trilogy\n\nDisney Plus also houses the entire prequel trilogy, the story of how the galaxy fell into civil war. \"The Phantom Menace\" stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor and Samuel L Jackson, and the film is best known for the antagonist, Darth Maul and his double edged lightsaber, as well as the epic battle between the Sith and two Jedi knights featuring one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the franchise, \"Duel of the Fates.\"\n\nThe second installment, \"Attack of the Clones,\" gives viewers their first look at a grown up Anakin as a Jedi. It's best known for its love story between Anakin and Padme Amidala and the battle of Geonosis, which sees a host of Jedi fighting side by side against a wave of droids.\n\nThis trilogy comes to a close with what many people consider the best of the three films, \"Revenge of the Sith.\" This film sees Chancellor Palpatine fully transition into the Emperor and Anakin transform into Darth Vader after killing Count Dooku and all the Jedi younglings. The film ends in an emotional battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin.\n\n3) 'Star Wars' sequel trilogy\n\nThis trilogy includes some of the most recent \"Star Wars\" films and tells the epic tale of what happens after the events of the original trilogy. It relays how, despite the Empire's defeat in the galactic civil war, The First Order rise to power and features the first female lead protagonist in the \"Star Wars\" movies.\n\n\"The Force Awakens\" is the first film in this trilogy and the first since Disney bought Lucasfilms. It was a hit with most fans, who enjoyed seeing a whole host of new characters introduced to the franchise as well as the return of some old favorites including Han Solo, Princess Leia and a shock cameo in the final scene from Luke Skywalker.\n\nEpisodes VIII and IX continue the journeys of Rey Skywalker, Po Dameron, Finn and Kylo Ren as the Rebellion continues its struggle against the First Order and questions are answered around Supreme Leader Snoke. We also learn of Kylo Ren's path to the dark side, Luke Skywalker's involvement in it and a surprise return of the Emperor as the trilogy comes to a thrilling end.\n\n4) 'Star Wars' anthology movies\n\n\"Star Wars: Rogue One\" is the story of how the rebels obtained the Death Star plans in the first place and gives fans one of the most menacing impressions of Darth Vader since the original trilogy. An epic story ends as \"A New Hope\" begins, with Vader boarding a rebel ship while R2-D2 and C3PO escape with the plans.\n\n\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" is Han Solo's origin story and we see how he meets characters like Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian for the first time.\n\n5) 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'\n\nEwan McGregor is reprising his role as the famous Jedi Master, Obi-Wan Kenobi in this TV series set between episodes III and IV. This series will tell the story of Obi-Wan watching over a young Luke Skywalker while evading the Empire's Jedi hunters during his exile on Tatooine.\n\nThe series began streaming back in 2022 and was initially due to be released on the anniversary of \"A New Hope\" but the launch was delayed. With the series finale was released in the Summer of that year, so you'll be able to binge watch this series, meaning you'll have your Disney Plus and Star Wars fix through the month.\n\n6) 'The Mandalorian'\n\nThe hit series is set five years after \"Return of the Jedi\" and tells the story of the Mandalorian, a bounty hunter and his sidekick Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian, or Mando for short, works in the outer reaches of the galaxy, where he is far from the reaches of the newly formed Republic.\n\nThis TV series is a great way for fans to get their \"Star Wars\" kick, and it's also a good introduction to the franchise as it features a lot of action and adventure, plenty of sci-fi and plenty of comedic moments. \"The Mandalorian\" has been very well received by fans and critics alike and all three seasons are available to stream in their entirety.\n\n7) 'The Book of Boba Fett'\n\nReleased on December 29 2021, The Book of Boba Fett is an exciting addition to the Star Wars universe. A spinoff from \"The Mandalorian\" this new series sees Boba Fett navigate the underworld of the universe with \"Fennec Shand\" as they return to Tattooine to stake their claim on the territory formerly owned by Jabba the Hutt.\n\nEpisodes six and seven came fresh for February 2022 with seven being the series finale. This series has proved a hit with fans and critics alike, and we think is reason enough to try Disney Plus if you haven't yet.\n\n8) 'Star Wars: Andor'\n\nThis story tells the tale of Cassian Andor, one of the heroes from 'Rogue One', but five years before his antics alongside Jyn Erso.\n\nWe find our protagonist as a thief without too much going for him while plans to act out in rebellion against the Empire aren't on his agenda. We knew the least about this show that's new to our screens and it's been a huge success with fans. It premiered initially with two episodes, and new installments were then released weekly. All episodes are now available to binge.\n\n9) 'Ahsoka'\n\nThis new series tells the story of former Jedi Knight Ahsoka Tano following the collapse of the Empire.
