Each dog tag represents an individual life lost in the conflicts since\n\nSeptember 11, 2001. Included are 300 special flag dog tags specifically representing each\n\nindividual service member from Pennsylvania.\n\nTo formally observe the solemn occasion “Taps” will be sounded at dusk on\n\nSeptember 11, 2021.\n\nThe building will be closed at this time.\n\nThe open-air memorial is free to visit and open 24 hours a day through September 30th.\n\nSpotlight On: The Society of the Honor Guard, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier\n\nSeptember 9, 2021 7PM – Virtual Event\n\nJoin us on Facebook or YouTube\n\nThis year marks the 100th anniversary of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, located in Arlington National Cemetery.

Generals, including George Washington, planned army movements around the delivery of beer rations for the troops. Soldiers have longed for a taste of their local beer as a reminder of their home and normality. Soldiers and sailors have exercised great creativity and daring in their efforts to bring beer to their comrades in arms. Focusing on the Civil War through Afghanistan, this presentation will examine how beer has impacted war and how war has changed beer.\n\nJoe McAllister\n\nJoe McAllister spent much of his career developing programs and services for not-for-profit organizations.
