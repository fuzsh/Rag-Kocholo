        "text": "With the evolution of video games into a more impressive visual medium, the writing that goes behind the creative process has become increasingly prevalent. Along with this great writing are some great quotes. I present to you:\n\nThe Top 100 Video Game Quotes of All Time\n\n1. “I’m Commander Shepard, and this is my favorite store on the Citadel!” – Mass Effect 2\n\nThis classic quote comes from the second Mass Effect, in which you can endorse a store on the Citadel for a discount. The player can quickly discover that you can do this for nearly every store on the space station, creating a humorous chorus of the above quote booming out all over the citadel.\n\n2. “It’s time to kick ass and chew bubble gum…and I’m all outta gum.” – Duke Nukem\n\nDuke Nukem is the crazy, macho protagonist of the titular game series of FPS games involving crazy aliens, explosions, and more.

A Miserable little pile of secrets!” – Castlevania: Symphony of the Night\n\nUttered by the infamous Dracula, this quote comes as a melodramatic, somewhat corny, and overblown exclamation before Richter fights Dracula in the prologue of this Castlevania title.\n\n4. “We’re not tools of the government or anyone else. Fighting was the only thing I was good at, but at least I always fought for what I believed in.”– Metal Gear Solid\n\nGray Fox was the intimidating cyborg ninja that becomes Solid Snake’s ally throughout the game. A masochistic warrior, Gray Fox is constantly looking for his match when it comes to the battlefield.\n\n5. “They were all dead. The final gunshot was an exclamation mark to everything that had led to this point. I released my finger from the trigger. And then it was over.” – Max Payne\n\nThe neo-noir masterpiece Max Payne is filled with beautiful, dreary quotes.

It is safe to say that it broke a lot of tension from the terrifying presence of the mansion.\n\n7. “It’s a-me, Mario!” – Assassin’s Creed II\n\nThis in-joke for video gamers is said by Ezio’s uncle Mario after meeting on the road. It quickly became one of the more iconic quotes within the game for its reference to our favorite Italian plumber.\n\n8. “The sun went down with practiced bravado.

Front row center.” – Max Payne\n\nThis dark quote appears right before the murder of Max’s wife and baby, setting off the crazy course of events that define Max’s journey and motives for years to come.\n\n9. “The right man in the wrong place can make all the difference in the world.” – Half-Life 2\n\nThe mysterious G-man says this at the beginning of Gordon Freeman’s second adventure.

But I think that’s a luxury, not a curse. To know you’re close to the end is a kind of freedom. Good time to take… inventory.” – Call of Duty: Modern Warfare\n\n13. “Some trees flourish, others die. Some cattle grow strong, others are taken by wolves. Some men are born rich enough and dumb enough to enjoy their lives. Ain’t nothing fair.” – Red Dead Redemption\n\n14. “You can’t break a man the way you break a dog or a horse. The harder you beat a man, the taller he stands.” – Far Cry 2\n\n15. “War…war never changes” – Fallout\n\n16. “The world fears the inevitable plummet into the abyss. Watch for that moment and when it comes, do not hesitate to leap. It is only when you fall that you learn whether you can fly.” – Dragon Age: Origins\n\n17. “Most test subjects do experience some cognitive deterioration after a few months in suspension. Now you’ve been under for… quite a lot longer, and it’s not out of the question that you might have a very minor case of serious brain damage. But don’t be alarmed, alright? Although, if you do feel alarmed, try to hold onto that feeling because that is the proper reaction to being told you have brain damage.” – Portal 2\n\n18. “Nothing is true, everything is permitted.” – Assassin’s Creed franchise\n\n19. “It’s dangerous to go alone, take this!” – The Legend of Zelda\n\n20. “I raised you, and loved you, I’ve given you weapons, taught you techniques, endowed you with knowledge.

Everything has led to this, as the quote exhibits, and it’s an extremely powerful scene.\n\n21. “Boss… you were right. It’s not about changing the world. It’s about doing our best to leave the world… the way it is. It’s about respecting the will of others and believing in your own.” – Metal Gear Solid IV: Guns of the Patriots\n\n22. “Endure and survive.” – The Last of Us\n\n23. “Praise the sun!” – Dark Souls\n\nThis is Solaire the knight of the sun’s motto, which quickly became a favorite quote online amongst Dark Souls gamers.\n\n24. “Do you like hurting other people?” – Hotline Miami\n\n25. “I’ve struggled a long time with survivin’, but no matter what you have to find something to fight for.” – The Last of Us\n\nAfter the death of his daughter, Joel has to keep scraping to survive after 20 years of a plague-infested America.\n\n26. “Tell me Bats.

Me, in a thong?” – Batman: Arkham Asylum\n\nJust one of the humorous classic lines challenging Batman, the Joker steals the show in all of his appearances.\n\n27.

It is what we fight with when all else is lost.” – God of War 3\n\n30. “Stop right there, criminal scum!” – The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\n\nNefarious players will be hearing this more than others, but this classic line is delivered with such gusto and passion that it borders on parody.\n\n31. “Hey!

Some rent-a-clown with a gun who puts holes in other bad guys. Well, that’s what they had paid for, so in the end, that’s what they got. Say what you want about Americans, but we understand capitalism. You buy yourself a product and you get what you pay for, and these chumps had paid for some angry gringo without the sensibilities to know right from wrong. Here I was about to execute this poor bastard like some dime store angel of death, and I realized they were correct, I wouldn’t know right from wrong if one of them was helping the poor and the other was banging my sister…” – Max Payne 3\n\n35. “A man chooses; a slave obeys.” – Bioshock\n\nThe maniacal Andrew Ryan emphasizes this philosophical line near the end of the game when the player finally meets him in person.\n\n36. “Snake?

I mean, you may think to yourself that you’re happy. But you don’t believe it. You focus on the petty bull ****, or the next job, or whatever.

Through speech, music, literature, and movies… what we’ve seen, heard, felt… anger, joy, and sorrow… these are the things I will pass on. That’s what I live for. We need to pass the torch, and let our children read our messy and sad history by its light. We have all the magic of the digital age to do that with. The human race will probably come to an end sometime, and new species may rule over this planet. Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of life we can.

When he is gone, the world will speak for him” – Halo\n\n80. “DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM” – Fallout 3\n\nThe finished robot, Liberty Prime, accompanies the player to defeat the enclave, all while spurting hilarious anti-communist propaganda.\n\n81. “…it is merely an observation on the nature of reality. To say that nothing is true is to realize that the foundations of society are fragile and that we must be the shepherds of our civilization.

Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? ‘No!’ says the man in Washington, ‘It belongs to the poor.’ ‘No!’ says the man in the Vatican, ‘It belongs to God.’ ‘No!’ says the man in Moscow, ‘It belongs to everyone.’ I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible.

We give it meaning by choice.” – Bioshock 2\n\n87. “War has changed” – Metal Gear Solid IV\n\nThis quote goes against Fallout’s signature quote, as Solid Snake describes the futuristic advancements in war and conflict throughout the world.\n\n88. “If our lives are already written, it would take a courageous man to change the script.” – Alan Wake\n\n89. “There are two ways of arguing with a woman, and neither one works” – Red Dead Redemption\n\n90. “Had to be me… Someone else might have got it wrong.” – Mass Effect 3\n\n91. “Waka Waka Waka” – Pacman\n\nThe iconic sounds of Pacman gobbling down those dots can be heard if you think about it enough!\n\n92. “[silence]” – The Legend of Zelda\n\nLink’s famous ‘lines’, in which he doesn’t speak, even when spoken to, has become an integral part of the franchise as a whole.\n\n93. “Now is the time to choose!
