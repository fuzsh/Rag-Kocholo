        "text": "There are three different property tax exemptions available to veterans who have served in the U. S. Armed Forces, including veterans who have served in the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.\n\nObtaining a veterans exemption is not automatic – If you're an eligible veteran, you must submit the initial exemption application form to your assessor. The deadline in most communities is March 1—please confirm the date with your assessor.\n\nYou must attach to your application either:\n\nProof that you were discharged or released from service under honorable conditions (usually Form DD-214; see the complete listing of Acceptable military records for veterans property tax exemptions) or\n\nA letter you received from the New York State Department of Veterans' Services (DVS) stating that you now meet the character of discharge criteria for all of the benefits and services listed in the Restoration of Honor Act.\n\nYou must also provide proof of the times and places served in active duty, if not already included on the documentation described above.\n\nSee Publication 1093, Veterans Exemption Questions & Answers – Partial Exemption from Property Taxes in New York State for more information.\n\nWhichever exemption you choose, it will apply only to county, city, town, and village taxes; it does not apply to special district taxes. School districts also have the option to offer the alternative veterans and cold war veterans exemption.\n\nYou can only receive one of the three exemptions listed below.\n\nAlternative veterans exemption\n\nAvailable only on residential property of a veteran who has served during a designated time of war, or who has received an expeditionary medal.\n\nCurrently available in over 95 percent of the county, city, town, and village taxing jurisdictions across the state. The remainder of these jurisdictions may choose to offer this exemption in the future. School districts also have the option to offer this exemption.\n\nCheck with your assessor or clerk to see whether the alternative veterans exemption is offered.\n\nAuthorized by Real Property Tax Law, section 458-a.\n\nCold War veterans exemption\n\nAvailable only on residential property of a veteran who served during the Cold War period.\n\nCounties, cities, towns, villages, and school districts have the option to offer this exemption to qualified veterans.\n\nCheck with your assessor or clerk to see whether the Cold War veterans exemption is offered.\n\nAuthorized by Real Property Tax Law, section 458-b.\n\nEligible funds exemption\n\nProvides a partial exemption.\n\nApplies to property that a veteran or certain other designated person purchases. Such owners must purchase the property with pension, bonus or insurance monies."
